“You really want to know?” Steve asks, grunting softly as he pushes himself up into a sitting position. Tony steps in to assist. “Thanks,” Steve tells him, wincing again when he shifts.
His stomach churns and he stops in the entrance of the kitchen, taking a deep breath to calm himself.
The news has mixed reactions among the team. Natasha was bummed about the team getting another boy when they were clearly in dire need of more girls, but she was still happy and excited to be an aunt, promising to spoil her nephew.
“Not yet. You need a lot of training before that, kiddo. After our run we’ll go down to the training room-”
“Honey, stop. Kids act this way. Remember how Harley-no, wait that’s not a good example. Sarah! When she turned two she had this issue. She still does.”
Bucky eyes him closely and steps further into the room, sitting down on the bed beside him. “Look, Pete, I don’t mean to be so-”
Peter’s brows furrowed in confusion. He expects to see footage of his dad flying around the city as the famous Iron Man, but then he hears a familiar voice.
“You’re not wrong. I’ve had other...guests up here before. But it’s not what you think. For one I’ve never let anyone raid my closet and steal my old college sweatshirt.”
Peter wanders around the decorated space, forcing a smile when he passes by someone he knows. He sneaks away from the party, needing some air and a moment to himself. He doesn’t go very far, taking the stairs until he’s out of view and able to catch his breath.
“Steve, let me remind you that this room is a safe place. Whatever you say to me stays between us. You’re safe here. No one can hurt you.”
“Look, Steve I know i said anything but I can’t get involved with this kind of stuff anymore. The team is yours now.”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “You’re one to judge. You cried last night because I wouldn’t get you Burger King at 3 A.M.”
From the beginning he had promised Steve protection and security. He was going to be there no matter what to make sure Steve and their son were safe. It was a promise he repeated multiple times a day until Steve finally believed it. That promise was sealed in stone the moment he placed his mark on Steve. He was Steve’s mate, his alpha, his protector. And he failed him.
This time Steve does whine and his eyes clench shut. His body protests but he ignores his discomfort and keeps going.
“Fuck…” Tony’s body seizes up, his hips stuttering as he fills Steve up. He continues to thrust until every last drops has been released.
Peter gasps and his eyes widen in shock. He’s not the only one left speechless, Tony is pretty sure his mouth is hanging open.
One particular hard cramp hits and Steve can’t help the small scream that rips through his throat. He leans against the wall again, eyes squeezing shut and groans leaving him when the pain intensifies. There’s a building pressure deep in his pelvis, adding to the discomfort he’s already feeling. Something pops inside of him and gushes out, relieving the pressure. Steve glances down, eyes widening at the sight of the shower water tinged a bright pink.
“Let me go,” Peter tries to shrug the bully off. Flash’s entourage laugh and mock. Peter stares at Flash with pleading eyes, and to his surprise, Flash lets him go. He shoves him forward, but Peter’s fine with that. It could’ve been worse.
Peter quickly glances in the direction of the front doors, his heart racing at the sight of Flash. He was used to his heart rate increasing whenever he caught sight of Flash; he was terrified of being pummeled or mocked. But Flash was different toward him now. He wasn’t super friendly, but he was learning to be civil. Peter would take what he could get.
Now that the alarm has been set off, Steve expects every single alpha in the vicinity to come for him. He has nothing but his bare hands to defend himself, but that’s the least of his concerns. He needed to find the person responsible for his suffering before he ran away and hid like the coward he is.
Steve sighs and takes the offered seat. He doesn’t sit very close, making sure to keep some distance between them. It hurt. Just the other night he was curling up beside Tony.
Peter is still on the couch when Tony enters the living room. He turns away from the screen when he hears his daddy come on, dark eyes lighting up and a smile appearing over his face.
Tony nods. He noticed Peter didn’t say if Barnes was okay with it. He hopes they don’t meet face to face.
Tony doesn’t get any sleep that night, not that he was expecting to in the first place. He was usually pulling an all-nighter on a new project or celebrating his success at a party. It was a lifestyle he knew he couldn’t continue having. And after the last party he went to, he vows to never go out to a public event like that again.
“Do you want me to get Pete?” Tony’s question snaps Steve from his thoughts and he nods his head in response. Tony presses another kiss to his head then he’s leaving the room to get their oldest son.
Peter wishes he could turn around and have the apartment locked up, but it was uncles and aunt that decided to clean up the space.
He looks like...well, Peter doesn’t want to say shit but it’s all he can think of. It’s rude, but the truth.
“One cup won’t hurt right? And it’s not like you’re nursing right now. Unless you want to visit him today?”
Steve shrugs Tony off. “If this is all because you feel guilty, then I don’t want it. I don’t want your clothes or your muffins.” Steve slams the muffin into Tony’s chest, creating a mess on the floor.
“I’m really sorry, Pete,” Bucky apologizes. He doesn’t know how many times he said those words, only for them to go ignored each time. He hopes they don’t this time.
Sam chuckles. “Hey it’s okay to be nervous,” he says as he follows Steve out of the room and into the hall. “Marriage is a big step.”
Steve nods, but it’s difficult to believe those words. He had gotten used to trying to figure out how to take care of one baby, and now he was adding another to the mix and throwing everything off. It was terrifying. He couldn’t imagine doing something wrong and hurting his children.
A few days later, Tony and Steve are free to go home. Natasha and Bucky stop by to help them gather their belongings or hold a baby when their arms are too full. Bucky takes Harley like he said he would while Natasha coos and smiles down at Peter.
A scene is starting to form. Cars are blaring their horns and bystanders are watching with curious eyes. Tony prays no one records a video. He’d be accused of hitting someone. He can already see the headlines on tomorrow morning’s paper.
Finally the doctor appears and Tony immediately begs her for relief. He’s only at three centimeters and had a ways to go, but at least it would be pain-free.
Steve nods and he allows Tony to pull him to his feet. He staggers, relying on Tony to hold him upright. Tony eyes him closely, first starting from his tear-streaked face and all the way down to his bloodied thighs. There was so much blood. It couldn’t be normal.
Steve moves quickly, grabbing the nearest trash can in the corner of the room and rushing back to his husband, thrusting it in his lap. Tony ducks his head in the can and the room fills the sound of his retching. The team can only stare with wide eyes as their teammate vomits. The only one amused with the situation is Clint.
A baby shower had been the last thing on Steve’s mind. His son would be arriving soon and all of Steve’s time went into preparing for the birth and what was supposed to come next. It was scary to imagine what his life was going to be like with a newborn, but at the same time he couldn’t wait to hold his son for the first time.
Now that Tony’s learned the truth about the pup, he finds himself growing attached. He starts to picture his life with the baby. It was going to change drastically and a part of him was still worried about becoming a father, but the other half was excited.
“But that doesn’t mean you get pushed aside. We’ll do better. No more Spider-Man-” Tony begins to say and Morgan quickly shakes her head when she catches the hurt expression on her brother’s face.
“Peter Benjamin,” Steve tests out the name, smiling at the sound of it. Tony must like it too because he smiles just as brightly.
He didn’t have his best friend anymore. The memories were the only thing he had left, and he’d hold onto them as long as he could. At least he still had the ability to revisit those moments with Bucky. Hydra couldn’t take everything away.
His papa is lying still, but it’s not the lack of movement that has Peter’s blood running cold; it’s the sight of his father’s blood. It’s everywhere, covering the lower half of his suit, the fabric stained a dark red. Blue eyes are still open, but there’s fear and pain in them, a look Peter hasn’t seen before.
“Sometimes it’s too big. Sometimes I wonder if I should go off the grid, live somewhere quiet and away from this.”
Tony nods, but hesitates to return to the room. “You’re going to stay, right? I can’t imagine you flying back now. I have a room.”
“You wanna run that by me again, Cap?” Nick questions, his good eye narrowing. The man hated being interrupted, but Steve figured he’d get a pass.
“He’s a good kid,” Sam defends. “He wouldn’t hide anything from us. We already made it clear we’re all here for him.”
“Easy there, kiddo.” Steve chuckles when Peter continues to eat like it was his last meal. Steve watches his son eat for a moment before tipping his head back against the chair and letting his eyes fall shut. It would be so easy to fall back asleep, but he fights the exhaustion.
Steve is eventually forced to comply and once he gives up the fight, the fingers wrapped around his throat ease off and Steve greedily gulps down air. He goes limp and his eyes fall shut for a moment, only to shoot open when lips are on his own. He struggles again, pushing back against the alpha, but then pain radiates through his face, and he stills.
“Right. I guess it’s a little hard to believe since you’re...you know…” Tony gestures to Steve’s uniform.
Sam rushes to the opposite side of the jet, flipping buttons and working on getting the jet in the air. He returns a few minutes later to help. Peter assumes the jet was placed in autopilot.
“I kind of figured that much. Guess we’re not good at having a relationship or ending it,” Steve says.
The doctor catches on quickly and she helps remove the clothes from his lower half, then she settles between his spread legs. He hears a gasp from beside him; it’s one of the nurses. Her surprised reaction has Steve opening his eyes and glancing down, panic setting in at the sight of the blood between his legs.
Tony sighs. A part of him is regretting ever letting Steve into his car. None of this would have happened if they never met. He was just fine living his life without the knowledge of Steve and some insane occult. But the other half is relieved that he knows the truth. He couldn’t imagine living his life while Steve and their child suffered.
He doesn’t mean to hurt the ones that he loves. That’s the last thing Steve ever wanted to do. His family and friends always came first. They were the ones that always mattered more than himself.
“J, where is he?” Is the first thing Tony asks when he enters his penthouse and finds it quiet. It’s too quiet for his liking. There’s a moment where he ponders the idea of Steve running off and taking something valuable with him. But then his A.I. is answering and Tony feels like an asshole.
“I don’t think you can. This hurts, Pep. This hurts bad. God I’ve never hated myself more than I do now. I’d give anything to go back and do the right thing.”
He finds Steve still asleep and curled up in a ball. He looks so small and vulnerable. It’s heartbreaking to see him this way. There was more that still needed to be revealed about Steve and his past, but it was a delicate topic and Tony wasn’t about to push him. He’d patiently wait for Steve to get more comfortable.
Steve moves quickly out of the room and back into the corridor. The sound of screams fills the empty halls, and much to Steve’s relief, they don’t belong to his teammates. He pushes through, ignoring the burning smoke in his eyes and lungs. All that mattered was getting out.
Steve pulls out and collapses beside Tony, panting heavily as he tries to regain his breathing. “How was that?” he asks, turning to Tony for approval. Tony can only give him a thumbs up in response. Steve chuckles and rolls over onto his side, propping his head up on one arm. “Feeling better?”
Tony scoffs and allows his bodyguard to lead him up the steps toward the entrance. “I’ve lasted longer than that.”
As if in que, the clouds turn a dark shade of gray and bolts of lightning flash across the sky. No one even bats an eye, the only one still uneasy about the sudden storm is the toddler in Natasha’s arms. She hugs him close, and assures him that everything was fine.
“It’s not your fault, Tony,” Natasha assures. “Don’t blame yourself. We didn’t know how severe his pain was.”
Steve hesitates to answer the question. He would be lying if he said their breakup didn’t leave him confused and slightly bitter, but it wasn’t worth voicing his feelings if it meant jeopardizing a friendship with Tony. He’d rather have him as a friend, as a teammate, then not have him at all.
Then it clicks. This was Morgan's time with Steve. Sure Tony had taken over feedings every now and then but it wasn’t the same when Steve would feed her. It was their bonding time.
“Please don’t be mad,” Tony mutters to himself. He turns his attention back on the road, a curse leaving his lips at the rows of cars he’s greeted with. He wonders if he should’ve brought the suit with him. He would be home by now if he did.
“What’s wrong, princess?” Tony asks. He drops his current task of making cookies to attend to his daughter, only to stop himself when he realizes his hands are sticky with dough and not acceptable to touch Sarah’s favorite outfit.
First I want to apologize for the short chapter! These two have a lot to figure out still but it’s coming together! Thank you for being patient with me! I love you all! ❤️
Steve takes another deep breath and lowers himself down on one of the steps. He can feel tears gather in his eyes and he blinks rapidly to keep them at bay. Today wasn’t supposed to be about him panicking and getting worked up. He was supposed to be celebrating his son.
“I’m so sorry!” Peter apologizes. He can’t see how flustered he comes off but he’s positive she can.
The master bedroom now had a side dedicated to Steve and his belongings. His clothes are neatly put away in a drawer of Tony’s dresser, and a side of the large walk-in closet has a spot meant for him. His art supplies also get their own space; one of the extra rooms becomes Steve’s office/ art studio.
She’s not so fast this time around and he’s left taking care of the fussy newborn. Steve takes Peter into his arms, immediately checking for a wet diaper, and when he’s met with one, he sighs and gets out of bed. He makes the small trip down the hall to the nursery and gets to work on getting Peter changed.
“I know,” Pepper rubs a hand along his back, “I know it hurts. But it’ll get better. You can’t go back but you can go forward. You can be better for yourself and your son.”
“Yeah!” Steve gets just as excited for his little girl. Seeing his mother and sister happy piques James’ interest and he crawls off the bed. Steve notices him and gestures for his son to come over. “It’s okay, James. Do you want to meet him?”
“Hey, hey,” Tony makes sure his tone is calm. “Kid, I don’t know why you’re getting upset. If it’s because of me-”
Tony awakens to the sensation of the sack being ripped away from his head. The next thing he becomes aware of is the stabbing pain in the back of his head and the tight pressure around his wrists. Tony’s eyes flutter, his vision blurry and unfocused. His eyes shut from the exhaustion and his head lolls to the side.
Bruce sighs. “Promise me if something happens, whether that’s with the pregnancy or your situation, that you tell me.”
Steve is gripped again by his shoulder and forced against the wall, his arms splayed wide on the cool tile. The hot water burns his skin and he hisses behind gritted teeth, eyes squeezing shut.
But the voice in his head argues against that. If he was dead then Steve might as well be too. It was up to him to get his mate and son out of this.
“Sorry it’s kind of empty. We were cleaning some stuff out,” Peter explains. He gestures to the couch. “You can sit down and stuff. I’ll be right back.”
“Poor thing’s worn out,” Tony says and he sits down in the chair beside the bed, cradling his son and pressing a kiss to his head.
“Should I not trust you?” Tony asks and he takes his hands off Steve’s face, only for the omega to take them and squeeze them gently.
His right leg continues to shake as he glances around the small waiting area. He reads posters that bring awareness to STD’s and what he can do to prevent them. The next poster is similar, though this time it relates more to his situation. Peter quickly turns away and glances down at his lap.
Peter nods and curls up against his papa, resting his head on Steve’s chest, and immediately finding comfort in the soft beating he hears.
“Go for it. It’s going to be your room,” Tony says and he rises to his feet, stretching his arms over his head until his shoulders pop. “I have one more thing to show you.”
“Yeah.” Bucky sighs sadly and folds the shirt. He rises to his feet and heads toward the door. “I’ll let you get some sleep now. Goodnight, Pete. I love you.”
Tony brings Steve’s hand back up to his lips, kissing the soft skin and letting his lips linger for a while. He doesn’t want to let go, he never wants to leave Steve’s side. He thinks about the conversation they’re supposed to have, wishing they didn’t have to.
Steve knows Tony doesn’t regret their son, but he knows Tony regrets how they conceived him. It was supposed to be Steve to do it all. He’d give anything to switch places with Tony. And God did he wish he could.
The alpha growls and bites down hard on Steve’s neck, breaking the skin and creating a bond between them. Steve gasps, eyes rolling into the back of his head and his body convulsing from the intense pleasure that shoots through him.
, Tony thinks to himself but it’s difficult to listen to that thought when the omega thrusts up again. He gives in, situating himself between the omega’s spread legs and rubbing himself against the omega, staining his expensive suit pants with slick.
Tony is snapped out of his thoughts when the car behind him honks. He hadn’t realized the traffic was moving at a faster rate and there was now a large gap between him and the car in front. Tony moves forward, pleased to find that the heavy traffic was clearing. He still would be late, but not as late as he originally thought.
Tony sighs and gives up. Perhaps Steve was ignoring him. They hadn’t said much since that day with Happy. Steve had every right to be upset. It seemed the only person who was taking him seriously was...well, Jarvis. Tony had his doubts just like everyone else. He wishes he didn’t.
“I don’t know how to tell you,” Steve admits. He pauses, waiting for Tony to say something. When he doesn’t he continues. “I didn’t tell you everything about me. The things I went through-”
“That’s our baby,” Steve says softly, eyes bright and full of happiness. A happiness Tony had only seen a handful of times during their relationship. It only makes Tony feel worse.
Tony finds it on the next thrust, curling his finger to stimulate the sensitive gland. Steve cries out, back lifting off the bed and eyes squeezing shut. Tony fucks him harder with his fingers, plowing them through the abundance of slick that leaks out of Steve’s hole. Tony carefully slides his fingers free, marveling at the wetness coating his fingers.
“Shield will deal with them. Steve-” Tony takes his original seat and sets the water bottle down on the glass surface of the conference table so that he can take Steve’s hand again. “-they won’t find you. No one will. You’re safe now. I know you’re scared and unsure, but I won’t let anyone hurt you anymore. I screwed up the first time but I won’t do it again.”
Peter is fussy the moment Tony takes him out of the stroller. He’s searching for food, showing the signs Tony has come to recognize. It’s difficult to hold Peter securely in one arm while trying to get a bottle from the diaper bag. Tony huffs. He should’ve left Peter in the stroller before attempting to retrieve the bottle.
Morgan is carefully placed in her father’s arms, and that’s when Tony’s world changes. She was tiny, fitting perfectly in the crook of his arm as if she was meant to be there all along. Her head is covered in a hat, but it can’t fully contain the hair underneath, giving him a glimpse of her dark strands.
Tony huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. “Believe it or not that’s been all Steve,” Tony says and turns the camera to the pile of new baby items in the corner. “He keeps buying this kid stuff.”
He glances back at the screen, wishing that the little fluttering in the center would stop. It sounds bad, he knows this, but it would be saving the kid a whole lot of heartache in the future.
Then Tony does it. He gets down on one knee, just like Steve had imagined him doing. Reaching into the pocket of his jacket, Tony retrieves a black velvet box and opens it, showing the ring that’s nestled inside.
The silence that lingers over them is heavy and uncomfortable. Ever since that confrontation between them things had changed. Tony was distant, and Steve blames himself.
Tony scrambles to his feet and rushes toward the bathroom, only to stop when Steve takes his hand and pulls him close. Steve brings him into a kiss.
Movement from behind him captures his attention and Steve spins around, just in time to catch Rumlow crawling for his gun. He’s not quick enough and the alpha fires a couple of rounds; Steve rushes toward Tony and throws them both down to invade the attack. Rumlow’s aim is off and he misses. The bullets stop flying and Steve lifts his head to sneak a peek in the alpha’s direction. Rumlow is up and rushing out of the room.
Bucky actually smiles. It’s small, barely even a hint of one, but Peter catches it. Sam does too and he reaches for his husband’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze.
“Can we not do this? It’s Steve’s birthday and Peter wouldn’t want us...” Tony gestures between himself and Bucky.
“I thought I’d find you two here,” Steve says. Tony turns around and smiles. Steve steps into the room, his eyes scanning around the space his son would soon call his own.
Steve whines, his cries growing louder. Tony makes another attempt to wake him, only to terrify the omega instead. Steve starts screaming.
“Look at me, baby,” Steve says. He recognizes the same scared look in Peter’s eyes that he had seen in his own. He too had been terrified when he found he was pregnant. “Pete, we’re going to help you.”
“It happens. False negatives can occur if hCG hormones are too low. And though they’re not very common, a cryptic pregnancy could be another factor.”
“I’m not expecting you to like me,” Tony continues, “to be honest I don’t even like me. What I did was wrong, and I’m sorry.”
Or maybe he was drugged. Steve hadn’t said for sure, but it made sense. Tony wouldn’t have done what he did willingly. Someone forced him to do it. But who?
I’m so sorry I’m taking forever to update! Work has been difficult. I hope everyone is doing good during these struggling times! Here is the next chapter 😊
“Maybe you two should move in together?” Sam pipes up from his spot in the kitchen. “Save us all the headache.”
A low rumble forms in Steve’s chest. The alpha growls back and presses the gun harder against Tony’s head, his finger hovering over the trigger.
“It’s not fair. I did everything right. I made sure I ate healthy, got plenty of sleep. I never missed any of my vitamins. Why…Tony, why? What did I do wrong?”
He sneaks a peek at the bouquet of flowers sitting on the passenger side seat. It was meant as a sweet gesture, something to cheer up his husband, but instead it was probably going to do the opposite. Steve was going to be furious with his tardiness. He had promised that he wouldn’t be late for their plans, and he hadn’t kept that promise.
But maybe it wasn’t as bad as Steve liked to think. He was finally somewhere safe. He was also near the pup’s father, and though Steve didn’t know him and they didn’t share a bond, he felt comforted by his presence. Maybe it was just his omega side finding reassurance in an alpha. Whatever the reason, Steve felt safe.
They never really fought, at least not in front of them. If they did, Morgan never really knew about it. They must have forgotten to keep their voices down this time.
“Are you kidding? Sweetheart, this is the best gift I’ve ever gotten. I can’t believe you did this; it’s amazing.”
“I’m sorry. I wish I could take everything back. Believe me I wish I could, but I can’t. I can’t and it kills me. Please don’t give up on me. Everyone else has.”
“But you’re the key. I don’t know how it works; they don’t tell me anything. They lock me into a room and trap me to...a breeding bench. That’s why I didn’t fight you off; I couldn’t. You think I wanted this? You think I wanted to wake up into a world I don’t know and be forced to breed? I’d give anything to have my old life back. I didn’t ask for this.”
Steve pushes forward like he does best. He focuses on the team and building them up to what they need to be. He continues to fight and save the world as the fearless Captain. Tony Stark isn’t on his mind as much anymore.
“It’s okay,” Peter tries to soothe, but it’s a lie. Nothing was okay. Nothing would ever be the same.
“I needed you both. And now I have no one. I left my family thinking you’d be enough and honestly, I don’t think you are.”
He needs to fight back. He can’t let this happen again. The first time was brutal, a nightmare. He couldn’t suffer through it again.
Steve’s body stills and his whimpering dies down. Tony keeps his arms around him. He can’t help but trail one hand down until it’s hovering over the small bump Steve keeps hidden under his clothes. He pulls back when he gets too close.
He wishes he had retired for good. His hiatus was good for him but not for anyone else. Pepper had to take up extra work and he figures her phone calls was her telling him she was burnt out and ready to quit. He couldn’t lose her. He’s lost enough already.
I finally got around to updating this one! I swear I haven’t forgotten about it! Also sorry that it’s not the greatest 😞 Hope you all enjoy it!
Tony straightens his tie for the tenth time before giving up and letting it hang around his neck with a muttered curse. His stomach churns and his palms grow sweaty at the thought of having to attend a party. He usually wasn’t this nervous when it came to events, but this party stood out among all the rest. This was Steve’s birthday party.
He can hear Morgan, the sound of her cries concerning. He listens carefully, ears straining to hear Steve calming her like he always does.
His eyes are shooting open at the new voice. Instead of those steel blue ones he’s always been forced to meet, brown eyes are staring back at him. He stops struggling when the scent of coffee fills his nose.
Seeing the Winter Soldier walking toward him had to be one of the scariest experiences in Tony’s life. He’s faced a variety of bad guys in his lifetime, but never has he crossed the famous assassin. Truth be told he never wanted to. He had hoped he never would. But now he wasn’t so lucky.
Tony knew this was coming. Sooner or later his son was going to wonder where the hell he had been after Steve’s death. He didn’t want to tell his son that he was drunk off his ass and hiding away instead of growing up and facing his issues head on.
“Nat,” the man comes back and Steve growls again. They lock eyes for a moment before he turns back to his partner. “Nick ordered a medivac. ETA ten minutes.”
“Hey.” Tony lifts Steve’s chin up. “He’s safe. They’re not going to get him. I’m not letting you out of my sight.”
Tony follows soon after, forcing his knot inside and locking them together. He grunts, hips stuttering as he reaches his release and fills Steve up. He keeps moving, riding out his orgasm until his body gives out.
Peter’s leg hasn’t stopped shaking since he’s sat down in the uncomfortable plastic chair. He lays a hand over his thigh and steals a glance at the young woman behind the desk, hoping she doesn’t pick up on his nervous energy. Maybe she has noticed but doesn’t even bat an eye. She probably sees this often and it no longer fazes her. For a moment Peter wonders how many others have been in a similar situation and have sat where he’s sitting now, their minds racing with too many thoughts.
The woman-another beta- is screaming and Tony quickly lowers his gun and places a finger to his lips, signaling her to be quiet.
Tony rolls his eyes and rises to his feet, stumbling momentarily before Steve is catching him. “I’m fine,” he assures again. “I think I’m gonna sit this one out.”
“Don’t know.” Steve’s brows furrow. He gathers the last bit of ice cream and brings the spoon up to his mouth, savoring the taste before it’s officially gone. With a sad sigh, he puts the empty container on the coffee table. Then his eyes land on the logo on the front of the container and an idea comes to mind. “Ben?”
It was beginning to look like he would be raising this child all on his own. He hadn’t broken the news to Tony yet. Being removed from assignments gave him extra time during his day, and none of it goes to calling up Tony and telling him about the baby.
Tony frowns and holds up a finger. “Just one more? Wait why am I asking you for permission. We’re doing it.”
“He looks a lot like you,” Tony smiles and he reaches out to place a hand over the top of his son’s head. “You did it, Steve. And look, he’s here and he’s healthy.”
It was a shame he wouldn’t get a happy ending. Well, that was a lie. It may not be like theirs, in fact it would be better. His child was his happiness. He may not have Tony, but he wasn’t completely alone.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony assures and rises to his feet. “I think I can order us something...if you want.”
“Hey, Pete,” Happy’s voice comes through. He doesn’t sound angry, but Peter picks up on the bit of suspicion in the man’s tone. “Were you planning on having friends over? I’m only asking because I know your friend and the guy standing right in front of me isn’t him.”
Tony was scared. He was a coward and he had no problem admitting that. He didn’t want to bring a helpless kid into the world and fuck up their life like his father had done to his. Tony suffered from the hands of his father. He didn’t want that for his children. They deserved better.
Peter chuckles and shakes his head. “No. He did love hot cocoa though. He always wanted extra whip cream.”
The door opens and the doctor enters the room. Doctor Patterson is a petite woman with dark, shoulder length hair and hazel eyes. Tony had only spoken to her briefly, but already he can tell she was going to be someone he could trust.
“Two months is enough time, right?” Tony asks, the sound of his voice snapping Steve from his thoughts. The omega peers up at him, a small frown already forming. “What? Too soon or not soon enough?”
Peter is fast asleep the moment Steve lays him down. He lingers nearby, watching his son sleep, his eyes glued to the soft rising and falling of Peter’s little chest.
“I’m so sorry.” Tony takes Steve’s hand and intertwines their fingers. He wants to pull Steve closer.
There’s no answer to his question. He opens his mouth to ask another one just like it, but the only sound that leaves his lips is a small scream. The burning between his legs has intensified. He knew what pain felt like. He’s lost count of the times he’s been banged up because Iron Man had too many enemies. But getting blasted out of the air or punched and kicked didn’t compare to what he was suffering through now.
The rest of the night goes exactly like Tony expected. Peter is up every few hours demanding food, cuddles, or a new diaper. Though Tony enjoyed their cuddling sessions more than the smelly diapers, he had made a promise to both Steve and himself that he would be the best father he could possibly be. He wanted to be hands on and do all the dirty work. It was part of the job description.
They’ve never experienced something like this before. They had been lucky when it came to Peter. The pregnancy had its uncomfortable moments like all do, but at the end of it all they were blessed with a healthy, baby boy.
Tony pulls off Steve’s lips and trails kisses along his jaw, down to his neck and kissing the mark he had put on Steve’s skin. The omega whines softly and bucks his hips, rubbing himself against his mate’s thigh.
Tony swallows the lump that’s formed in this throat. He knew Steve was hurting, but he didn’t know his pain was this severe. He wishes he had seen the signs sooner. Maybe it wouldn’t have come to this if he had.
Peter smiles. There was no denying that Ned would be the best uncle in the whole entire world. His uncles were the coolest, and Ned would definitely be right up there with them.
“You feel so good,” Tony groans and increases the pace of his thrusts, punching out moans and gasps from Steve. “Does it feel good for you?”
Bruce begins looking over Steve. He checks his eyes, ears, throat; everything he had done with the pups. He takes extra time studying the faint bruises and cuts along Steve’s face. He doesn’t ask about them, which Steve is grateful for. No one knew the horrors that went on. Steve wasn’t ready to tell them yet.
“Look,” Steve smiles and lifts his shirt, showing off the bump. Tony peers up from where he’s lying on the bed, and sets his tablet down to give his husband attention. Steve’s belly is on display. “The baby’s growing.”
Tony pauses zipping up his bags to peer up at his mate. “It’s a bad idea, huh? I’ve already put so much on her and...I don’t know. I’ll talk to her about it.”
Regardless of what the man’s secondary gender was, Steve coils back and growls at him. He didn’t know these people or what their agenda was. For all he knew they could be another threat.
Tony’s eyes follow the beta man’s every move, his blood boiling when the order is followed out and his son’s blood is drawn. Peter’s piercing screams fill the room, the sound only angering his father even more.
“But I need your help. You promised you’d be there if I ever needed you...and I need you now. Your weapons have gotten into the wrong hands...there’s a base in Siberia where they’re being traded; I need to shut it down, but I can’t do that without you. Take my place. Please, Tony. I’ll never ask for anything again.”
Peter eventually finds his destination. He stares up in awe at the unique skyscraper. He had seen it before, but never had a reason to visit.
The woman nods her head frantically and leads the way. Tony stays close behind her, his hand gripping the gun tightly in case someone is waiting for them.
“I’m glad to be home, I really am. But I’m scared. What if I can’t do it? What if I can’t be good enough and I screw up again? I don’t want to hurt her or you. I’d never live with myself.”
But he doesn’t have a choice. He was meant to be used for what Hydra needed. He was their puppet. He was theirs to control and use however they pleased.
“Yep! Dodger can help me.” Peter throws his arms around Dodger’s neck, giggling when he’s given slobbery kisses.
The stranger is still standing near the front of the car, a look of fear written on his face. Tony scans him for any signs of injury. The last thing he needs is to have hurt someone, or a lawsuit. Pepper would kill him for sure.
It’s late into the evening now, just hours away from a brand new day. Tony’s labor was progressing a little faster now that his water had finally broken, but there was still some time before their son was born and in their arms.
Tony’s gaze falls on the bump, his heart fluttering at the thought of the life growing inside of Steve’s belly. The life they created.
He’s reminded that he’s not completely alone. Bucky was just outside the door. He had to step out when a message from their friends came through, but he’d return and be by Steve’s side, just like he had promised.
Dodger seems happy with that answer and he barks again. Tony can’t help but smile and he reaches out to scratch behind Dodger’s ear.
“You’re a good father, Tony,” Steve says, smiling softly when Tony peers up at him. “Honest,” he adds when Tony appears unconvinced.
Understanding, Ned let’s Peter go and makes him promise to tell him everything tomorrow. Peter promises, though he can’t promise if it would be worth telling. The last couple of encounters with his dad had been...interesting.
Tony frowns at the sound of his tone. The day their daughter was born, Steve had been gushing over her. Tony remembers how excited he had been when he brought up the possibility of Morgan’s eyes matching Tony’s. When they first discovered they were expecting, Steve had been hoping for their child to take after Tony.
Steve should be grateful, and a part of him is, but the other half of him can’t help but wish that something was wrong. It would be painful to lose another pup, but at least it wouldn’t have the chance of being born and brought up under Hydra’s care. It would be spared.
But it wasn’t meant to be, and at least Tony was willing to do it all. Steve loved him even more because of it.
He takes a few steps down before stopping and sitting down on one of the steps. Above him he can still hear his party going on without him.
With her quiet and content in his arms, Steve allows himself to rest. He rests his head against the wall and closes his eyes. He’s still on high alert, listening for any sign of the dangers lurking outside.
Steve inhales and exhales slowly, following Tony’s instructions. The third time he does this, his belly spasms painfully, causing him to choke on the air. He grips Tony harder, fingers twisting the fabric of his mate’s shirt.
“Something just flew toward the base,” it’s Bruce who replies. Steve suddenly wishes he had the green guy with them and not on the jet.
Steve cries out and reaches for the band of his pants, shoving them down his legs until they’re around his ankles. A part of him feels ashamed for being this exposed to Happy, but the other half of him can’t bring himself to care. He was giving birth. No one said it was going to be pretty.
“I know. Breathe, Cap. Come on.” Tony makes an attempt to move again, only to stop when Steve refuses to budge.
“I think he’s ready for bed,” Steve says and he holds out his arms for Tony to take their son. Steve stretches his arms over his head and groans softly when his back pops. “I’m ready for bed.”
“I’m trying to figure everything out. I miss you so much and I wish you could be here to see everyone. We all miss you. And now dad’s back so...it’s what you wanted. I promise to keep everyone together. I promise to make you proud.”
“She was hungry. What was I supposed to do? It’s not like you were going to take my suggestion and pump.”
“Eh.” Tony gives a small shrug and downs the drink. He misses the way Alexander eyes the now empty glass.
Steve shuts his eyes, not wanting to see the look on the alpha’s face when he enters him. The gasp Steve emits is muffled from the large palm splayed over his mouth. He’s forced to let Alpha take what was his.
She huffs out a small laugh and hangs her head, shaking it in a way that makes Steve believe he did something wrong.
“It’s getting kinda cramped in there, huh?” Tony chuckles softly. “Almost there, kiddo. Your Papa, big brother, and I can’t wait to meet you.”
There’s no response and one glance down shows why. Tony is already asleep and snoring softly. It’s tempting to lie beside him and snuggle him until he wakes up, but Steve finds himself growing tired. It takes a lot for his body to feel any kind of fatigue. He blames the missions and training he’s been focusing on lately.
With a huff Tony plops back down in the chair. He pulls out his phone while he waits, shooting a quick text to Natasha to check in. The last update he had gotten about Morgan was thirty minutes ago. She was probably still asleep, but Tony can’t help but check in anyway.
Tony doesn’t waste any time. He knows what to do now and how to do it. If it worked the last time then he knows it won’t fail again.
Steve nods, liking the idea. For years he had kept everything bottled up, and now he was finally starting to open up. There were still details about his life that he hadn’t said, but that was going to take time. Tony assured him he’d be there and listen whenever Steve was ready to talk.
“I guess I felt like you were only being nice to me because you felt guilty. I don’t want you to feel anything for me.”
“Hey, Buck,” Sam greets when he enters the apartment. Bucky looks up, a deep frown etched on his face.
Tony shrugs off his suit jacket and approaches his mate. Steve senses him then and glances up, smiling tiredly.
“Don’t,” Steve warns. He doesn’t mean to lash out, but the anger is taking over. They should be able to have a family. They deserved one after everything they’ve been through. “I just really want this.”
Tony was a wonderful partner and an even better father. He’d make an amazing husband, Steve was sure of it.
“No. No!” Steve fights. He could easily overpower the two alphas if he really wanted to. He was stronger than they were. But he knows what will happen if he were to go up against them. A hard jab to the ribs has him gasping and falling still.
“Tell them, Bucky or I will. I can’t keep hiding it anymore. And I know you can’t either. The person you are now isn’t you.”
“Prepared. I know. Tonight, though, I want you to relax. This our first night away from him-” Tony pauses when Steve makes a nervous noise. “-but it will be fine. He gets to stare at a new face and we get to enjoy a few hours of not changing dirty diapers.”
“What if I do become him?” Tony pulls away so that their eyes can meet. “What if I’m not good enough? What if I can’t be a perfect father? What if I’m not a perfect alpha?”
He finds the strength to open his eyes and glance down, mesmerized by the sight of Steve’s bobbing head. Tony moans, the sound snapping Steve’s eyes up in his direction. Just the look in his husband’s eyes brings Tony closer to his release.
“Don’t remind me. I should’ve gone with you. At least then you wouldn't have been dropped off in the middle of the night by Mr. Pierce and looking like this.”
Tony relaxes but keeps his hands over Steve’s shoulders, needing to feel him there. “It’s not too bad,” he says. “I’m glad I can’t really feel it.”
Peter shakes his head and pulls away, putting space between them. “No. He went in with the team. I saw him.”
“Wait,” Tony says when Steve tries to get up. “Don’t. You can’t drop a bomb like that on me and not expect me to react the way I did. You’re accusing me of-of fucking raping you! I’d never do that to anyone.”
Peter knew this day was coming. Sooner or later he’d have to return to his old apartment. For the past couple of weeks his uncle’s home had been home. The guest bedroom that was reserved for his future cousin now held some of his belongings. A part of Peter hated that he took that space and tainted it. He hopes one day he’s not living there anymore and a new baby takes his place. He keeps his fingers crossed.
“Tony! It hurts!” Steve cries. Tears fill his eyes and roll down his face, leaving behind wet tracks. He clings to Tony tighter, whimpering and crying when the contraction peaks.
Steve sighs heavily and gives in. He makes sure to give Peter another kiss before passing him over to Tony. Peter whimpers from being moved and Tony freezes, afraid that he had disturbed his son. He waits for the wailing to come, but then Peter is falling back asleep.
Steve chuckles. “I know. Not any time soon. I don’t want a heat yet and I want the pups to be older.”
“If they did it would definitely be you. I’m really sorry about how selfish I’ve been lately. I don’t want you to feel left out. We’re a team, remember?”
“I miss you.” It’s words Steve has been keeping to himself since the day they ended their relationship. He had thought he’d be able to get over Tony, but sharing the same living space made it difficult. And now the life they created only made Steve’s heart yearn for Tony more.
“Tony-” The gun is pressed a little harder into the side of Tony’s head and Steve cries out. “Okay! Okay. Just don’t hurt him. Take me instead.”
No. Steve wasn’t going to think like that. Not all alpha’s are bad. This one wasn’t like the others. He had already proven that the night of their mating and then again when he offered Steve a place to stay.
“I know. This call wasn’t just about business, Tony. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay. You haven’t come by in a while. Happy misses you.”
He sniffs and takes a deep, slow breath to calm himself, not wanting to give in and show up to school with red eyes and a stuffy nose. His appearance would be excused. The death of his father was still fresh.
“Damn,” Bucky sighs and places one hand over Steve’s shoulder. Steve already knows his friend can see right through him. Bucky was always great at reading him when everyone else failed. “Hey, Steve, it’s okay.”
“I guess...I guess I don’t know how you can love me. Look what I’ve done, Tony. Look at the horrible things I’ve done to you and...and our daughter.” Tears are streaming down Steve’s face now. Tony doesn’t understand how in such a short amount of time Steve went from happy to this.
“I told you to stay,” he tells her. Natasha nods and works quietly on freeing Morgan from the carseat. Once she’s unstrapped and in her arms, Natasha gently passes her into Tony’s. She’s immediately calmer.
Bruce’s lack of response makes Tony wonder if he’s unhappy with Tony’s response. He doesn’t blame Bruce for being upset.
“No! No, no I’m not scared. I know you wouldn’t hurt me. I’m just...mad. My dad didn’t do anything wrong and all of you treated him like shit.”
They’re left panting and pressed together. Tony lays his head down on Steve’s chest, finding comfort in the soft beating of his heart. Steve smiles and buries his fingers in Tony’s damp hair, massaging his scalp. It was something Tony enjoyed after sex.
Tony turns to look at Steve over his shoulder and shoots him a smile. “You couldn’t even if you tried.”
The abundance of diapers made sense, though at the same time it made Steve uneasy. How many was he going to need? What he received so far appeared like enough but he knew babies required more than this. This would probably only last him a week or more.
“Yeah.” Steve smiles and reaches out to scratch behind Dodger’s ear. Dodger thumps his tail harder against the wooden floor and turns to lick Steve.
If Steve is bothered by it he doesn’t voice his complaints. He stays quiet as he reads through the menu. Tony orders a bottle of wine for them, shooting his husband a smile of reassurance when Steve eyes the bottle warily.
Steve eventually comes over and Tony smiles at him. “Morning, beautiful,” he greets, patting the spot beside him for Steve to take.
He was at least grateful that he had Laura to give him advice and answer any questions he had. Steve wanted to know anything and everything when it came to having kids. The books he read were nice, but speaking with someone who's experienced parenthood firsthand beat reading a page out of the baby books.
“Shh, it’s okay. It’s okay,” Tony soothes. He cradles Steve’s head and continues to hold him tightly against him.
Sam takes a moment to think of an answer for the difficult question, but before he can voice how he feels, Bruce is adding his two cents.
Maybe they would have talked and Tony for once, would have listened. He’d give anything to go back and change everything. Maybe then, the scene playing out in front of him would have never happened.
“He’s beautiful, Tony.” Steve smiles, his own tears of joy are rolling down his face. He leans forward to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “You did so good.”
Steve gives up on deciding on an outfit and goes with a pair of jeans and a simple black t-shirt. He slips on the black leather jacket Bucky had given him for Christmas and adjusts the front, giving himself a good look in the mirror.
“I can’t say I’m not surprised,” the alpha says and takes a sip from his glass. “You were always stubborn, never obeyed anyone. It was difficult to get you to behave. I guess I’ll have to try a little harder.”
Tony lets out a sigh of defeat. Pepper, as usual, was right. He was still feeling off and he had the worst headache of his life. He’d been hungover before but never like this. Work was a good distraction but he couldn’t focus. It was pointless to even try.
Poor Steve though 😞 He was so excited and did all these nice things for Tony. Tony has a lot of explaining and apologizing to do!
“At least we can mark the venue off the list,” Steve says as he makes his way over to sample some of the cookie dough.
Apparently that day was today. Steve knew the risks when he made the decision for them to go shopping for their son, but it wasn’t enough to keep him from enjoying this moment. They had a series of firsts ahead of them and baby shopping wasn’t being skipped.
“Not relationships. This is why it’s hard for me to...get close to someone. Especially someone like Steve.”
“He really liked that place, huh? I used to think maybe it was because he had missed so much, but he was just a big dork.”
“Anyway,” Tony begins and rises to his feet, making sure Harley is still secure in his arms, “mama has somewhere important to be and you kiddos are staying with Uncle Happy.”
“Well don’t bother.” Flash rises to his feet and heads toward the door, stretching a hand out for the handle. The door opens suddenly and he jumps back, eyes wide in surprise.
They were friends...or at least Tony wanted them to be. They still had a lot to learn about each other, but there was no denying the chemistry between them. Tony didn’t want to jump ahead and assume they could be possible mates, but the idea of them as a couple wouldn’t leave him alone.
Natasha is able to read his mind. “Clint’s on his way and the lovebirds went to get some coffee. I was going to wait to hold him until you woke up but I couldn’t help myself.”
“I don’t know,” Steve replies, his own voice just as breathy. He turns toward Tony, their eyes meeting. “Should we do this?”
Tony sighs harshly. “I’m still trying to figure that out. I thought I could hide out here with you until we both could go back but...it’s not looking that way. I won’t leave you alone. If I have to go then...then Happy can be here and of course Jarvis. Lord knows he loves you.”
He blames the sudden nausea on his nerves. They would be landing in New York soon. Steve couldn’t wait to be home and start the next chapter of his life. He should be happy and excited to finally be free from that monster.
“You do.” The warm smile is back on the doctor’s face. “It’s okay to feel like this. It’s completely normal.”
“Oh my God,” Steve says, his voice shaky and breathless. He stares down at the baby laying on his chest, an array of emotions flooding through him.
“Why are you apologizing?” Tony grows braver and steps closer to his omega. “That was amazing. I guess saying that was hot would be...weird...right? Forget it. You totally kicked their ass.”
They both step inside the apartment and are immediately greeted by Alpine. Peter smiles and picks her up, cradling her like a baby and chuckling when she purrs loudly. Sam just rolls his eyes and goes in search of his husband, not having to search very far. Bucky comes down the hall to greet them in the living room.
But he’s reminded that it was too late for any of that. The scene was merely a memory. Tony couldn’t alter it, he couldn’t change the outcome.
He doesn’t tell her about Steve. No one talks about him anymore. Everyone assumes Tony is broken up about the divorce. They’re not wrong. But it’s his guilt that’s killing him.
“Hey, you’re putting too much pressure on yourself. Or...maybe we put too much on you. Peter, I’m sorry. If we ever made you feel like you had to pick up the shield and follow in Steve’s footsteps-”
Natasha nods and continues to play with Peter’s messy hair. It was something that Steve always did to soothe him as a kid. Whenever he was scared or sick, this would be the only thing to calm him down. She could never replace Steve, but she’d do her best to always be there for her nephew.
“Didn’t we, though? You heard what Bucky said. We saw how different Steve was and we didn’t do anything, or at least not enough. I could’ve done more and instead he’s...well, you know how he is. I swear if I lose him…”
He remains by Steve’s side until he’s sure the omega is content again before slipping away. He leaves the door open in case he needs to listen for him again. JARVIS would likely alert him again, but Tony doesn’t want to take the chance. He can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if he didn’t get to Steve on time.
“I know, sweetie.” Natasha wraps an arm around his shoulder and brings him close so that she can kiss his head. “He would be so happy to see what you did for him.”
Steve nods. “I want to get better. I have a family now and...and how can I be there for them when I’m falling apart? I just want my life back. That’s all.”
Bucky waves Steve off. “Don’t mention it. I love that little guy. And seriously, talk to Tony. Trust me on this one.”
Steve chuckles softly and presses a kiss to the side of Tony’s head. “It was for both of you. I just wanted you to have fun.”
“Hey.” Tony reaches across the island for Steve’s hand, taking it in his own. “You’re safe now. It’s been what...three, almost four weeks and we haven’t heard anything. Now I know that’s not a lot but it’s a start. He’s giving up.”
It’s not for long. Peter was improving, and the doctor assured him that it would be a few more days at least until he could go home. It could be worse. At least, that’s what Steve tries to tell himself.
The next present is from Sam, which Steve is quick to thank him for. They were going to need a diaper bag and plenty of diapers to go in it.
Steve’s breath hitches. They had talked about marriage, but Steve wasn’t sure if he was ready for that. He was already bonded to Tony in more ways than one, and though it appeared marriage would be the next step to take, it was a step Steve was hesitant about.
“I don’t know,” Bucky responds. It’s not good enough. Tony needs a better answer than that. “Too many of them. He tried to hold them off.”
Steve sits nervously on the exam bed, nervously playing with his fingers while he waits for the results. Tony has started to pace the room, hoping the movement would calm the fussy baby in his arms.
They take a few moments to gather themselves before joining Peter in the living room. Peter had obviously grown tired of waiting because he’s put the tv on and is engrossed in the cartoon. He looks away from the screen when his parents enter the room.
“Tony, he didn’t have a home,” Steve says, as if that was going to be enough to convince his boyfriend to reconsider. “Look how happy he is.”
Tony moves closer, almost as if the omega is some kind of magnet that’s drawing him in. Up close, Tony is able to get a better view. The omega is massive, his frame unlike anything Tony has ever seen. He could put some alphas to shame.
Bucky’s expression softens and he slants in his seat. Peter’s eyes fill with new tears and he fights the urge to let them fall.
“It’s not. I...I like them too. But Happy still intimidates me. I know he’s just looking out for you but I can tell he still thinks I’m a threat to you.”
Steve notices the lack of response coming from his team after he asks a question, and he sighs when he finds them distracted. He glances at his son, who smiles cutely, then to Nick. He doesn’t get a cute smile in return from the Director.
Steve didn’t want to rush into bonding with Tony. They still had to learn more about each other. Tony was careful with his past, and Steve even more so. He kept his past close, probably closer than anyone should. The past had parts that weren’t always bad. Bucky, his old life, his mother; all of them were in there, hidden behind all of the trauma and abuse. Steve couldn’t let go completely.
Maybe one day he could show his dad his new discovery, but for now Peter keeps this spot a secret. It would be his place to escape when life became too much. It would be his hiding place.
“I’m really sorry. Trust me I’d rather watch her than do this but the team’s really short without you two.”
Steve worried and cared about all of his teammates, but he couldn’t help but care a little more when it came to Tony. Tony was more than just another member of the team. He considered them friends, but most importantly Tony was the father of his baby. He was the person Steve couldn’t imagine living without. He loved him deeply.
There’s a pause and the sound to the electric toothbrush buzzes from the bathroom. Tony goes back to work, more interested in the upgrades for his suits than participating in the current conversation. Anything related to the baby ruined Tony’s mood.
Tony steals another glance at his son. The sad expression was gone, and in its place a determined one has appeared. Damn. He was like Steve. Stubborn as hell.
He doesn’t know all the details, but he knows enough. He knows about the fallout his parents had and the big decision his papa made to keep him and raise him. He knows that his dad is Iron Man and is some billionaire hotshot that resides in Manhattan. He knows his dad had walked out on them and never bothered to even try and be a dad.
Tony’s not the only one excited for the new arrival. The team has showed their excitement in various ways, mostly with the amount of gifts they’ve been showering. His son wasn’t even born yet and already he was being spoiled.
“I do too.” Steve’s voice is quiet. He sniffs again. “I love you. I got scared. I was afraid you’d throw me out and he’d-he’d-”
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers and forces himself to look into Steve’s pain filled eyes. “I’m so sorry.”
“Good morning, Mr. Rogers,” The AI’s tone was cheery, and for a moment Steve forgets Jarvis isn’t human. “How can I be of service?”
But all of the outgoing calls never get returned. Steve’s lost count of how many times he’s called Tony during the span of a day. If he’s not putting together missions and going over training tactics, then Steve was on his phone.
“You finally did it.” Bucky smiles and he steps closer to his friend to properly congratulate him. “Congrats, pal.”
“For what? It’s normal to feel like this. At least, that’s what I’ve heard. Having a baby is scary.” Pepper’s voice is calm and soothing and it has Steve relaxing almost instantaneously. He turns around to face her, not caring about the tears and blotchy spots on his cheeks. “Oh, sweetie. It’s okay.”
The weekly visits become the highlight of Tony’s week. He’s only given a few hours with Steve, but he’d take what he could get before he’s forced to walk out the front doors and wait until he’s allowed back in.
Tony checks each room, searching for the one his son had been in. He remembers being in an elevator at one point and searches for that instead. Once he finds it, he presses the button to call it and hopes none of Pierce’s men are inside.
With a sigh, Tony loosens his tie and lets it hang around his neck. The first day back had been exhausting and there was still more work waiting for him in the morning. Pepper had done a phenomenal job keeping the company afloat during his spontaneous hiatus. Her hard work only pushed him closer to the idea of signing SI over.
Maybe Tony was right. Maybe once Peter is with them, then everything would be okay. At least, that’s what Steve hopes for.
Tony smiles up at him and slips the ring over Steve’s finger. Tony rises to his feet and pulls Steve into arms, then he connects their lips in a gentle kiss. They break apart and Tony leans forward, resting his forehead against Steve’s.
Tony peers up at him. The fear on Peter’s face was infectious. Tony didn’t even know the situation but he could feel the same fear. Maybe because he’s seen the same terrified and concerned look before.
“Shit, Steve,” Tony groans, eyes falling shut when Steve’s rubs and squeezes his cock. Steve pulls back, smirking when Tony whines.
To say the team was shocked would be an understatement. They wore more than just surprised faces when they were finally allowed to greet their friends. Their expressions were a mix of surprise and confusion. .
His stomach growls again, reminding him of the food he’s been deprived of. Steve pulls the blankets away and swings his legs off the side of the bed, stretching his arms high over his head, the muscles popping and he releases a pleased sigh
Steve eventually writes out his message, keeping it simple and straight to the point. He reads it over, huffing at his own words. It wasn’t perfect, but it would have to do. He rips the paper from the book and folds it up, then lays it on his nightstand.
“Like it belongs to someone else,” Peter replies, eyes filling with tears. “I don’t think I can do this.”
Tony scoffs and finishes the water. He tries to stand and that’s when Steve rushes toward him, gently pulling him to his feet. Steve leads him to the bedroom, not letting go until he has Tony on the bed.
Tony pulls Happy aside until they’re further away from Steve but still nearby if the omega needed him. One glance toward the living room shows Steve still curled up on the sofa and oblivious to the rest of the world. Tony has never seen him so scared.
I just wanted to say that I hope all of you are doing well during these crazy and difficult times. Writing is an escape for me so I'm trying to find more time for it. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. I love all of you!
“Don’t be.” Tony keeps both hands on Steve’s face. He’s finally able to see the faint bruises up close. “What did he do to you?”
And maybe one day Peter would get to meet his dad. Peter has asked a few times over the years about his other father, and initially Steve struggled to properly explain the situation. Eventually Peter got older and stopped asking. He knew the topic was difficult and confusing to understand.
Pepper lays a hand over his shoulder when she notices the tears that gather in his eyes. Steve welcomes the touch, happy to have her comfort again.
Tony pulls himself to his feet, a small grunt slipping past his lips when he discovers it’s not just his head that aches; his whole body is sore. That could be pushed aside, but then a new sensation takes over, and that’s where he struggles.
Sam waves a hand dismissively. “Man, don’t worry about it. I know how moving is. And with four pups. Yikes. I can’t imagine that.”
With a shaky breath, Peter rolls over and shuts his eyes, soft sobs ripping through him. Maybe it’s his imagination, or maybe his grief has conjured it up, but he swears he feels fingers brushing through his hair.
It’s difficult to attend to a fussy baby with only having just one sip of coffee, but Tony manages. It’s easy to forget about his exhaustion once she’s in his arms and staring up at him. Her eyes are still that dark blue that all babies are born with, and Tony hopes they only get lighter. Her dark hair was something she inherited from him, but he wanted her eyes to resemble those of his husband’s. Steve wasn’t convinced, and was positive she was going to have brown eyes.
Steve shrugs and sits down in the chair opposite of Tony. He takes his napkin and lays it neatly over his lap. “I said I can cook but nothing fancy. This-” he waves his hand over the food they’ve prepared. “-isn’t fancy, Mr. Stark.”
With a sigh of defeat Tony gives up on the designs. Right now all he had was a basic blueprint. He still needed to know the type of powers his son possessed in order for the suit to work for him.
For the longest time it seemed like he and Tony would never be anything but past lovers. They had broken up, and maybe some guessed it wouldn’t have lasted, Steve couldn’t say he agreed. He had been certain that he and Tony would never be together. But now here they were, together again and happy with their son.
“Thanks. Um we can get you new clothes. Whenever you want to go just tell me. And if you want to borrow anything else I don’t mind.”
Peter smiles at the pictures covering the page. He’s seen them all, but it’s been so long since he’s gone through the album.
Tony’s not expecting Peter to answer the question, though he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t curious. He had dated throughout the years. Well, he wouldn’t go as far as to use the word dated. The relationships he had were meaningless and would never amount to anything other than sex. It was just another pathetic coping mechanism.
Then Bruce is glancing over at Tony and their eyes meet. There’s no hatred or disgust or anything that makes Tony feel unwelcomed. Bruce had been one of Tony’s closest friends. They weren’t known as the Science Bros for nothing.
“No offense but...you don’t get to decide. Sorry,” Peter quickly apologizes and glances down at his lap. He’s never spoken to an adult like that before, let alone his parents.
“I’m sorry,” Bucky apologizes, his voice soft and laced with hurt, the words Peter had said still stinging.
Steve panics and pulls back quickly. He moves too fast, causing the water to spill from the glass and straight into Tony’s lap.
“You good?” Tony asks his son, one hand trailing up and down the toddler’s back. Peter responds with a small hiccup. Tony glances up at his mate and they share a look. “Guess it’s starting. The terrible twos are upon us.”
“I’m going to miss you too, Petey. I promise I’ll be back soon and then we’ll do something fun okay? We haven’t been to Disney World in a while.”
“Please? I’m sorry. I didn’t think he’d actually go. I wasn’t in the right state of mind. I was just trying to help.”
Tony’s still frowning. “But why? You couldn’t-“he stops himself quickly, knowing if he were to continue he’d start a fight. “Are you sure?”
Tony curses to himself before asking Jarvis to replay the voicemail. Peter grows excited and sits back in his seat, waiting for his papa’s voice to escape the surrounding speakers.
“I know.” Steve cranes his neck to make sure his son was where he was supposed to be, then he directs his attention back on his husband. “I don’t know how. This isn’t fair, Tony. This isn’t fair.”
The alpha standing above him screams and Steve’s eyes shoot open. Pierce screams again and he staggers, losing his balance and Steve quickly rises to his feet, ignoring the pain in his side. He quickly rips his pup out of the alpha’s arm and lets Pierce fall.
“We’ll be back later,” Steve says. He has Morgan secure in the stroller and her favorite pacifier in her mouth. She’s already drifting off to sleep. Steve smiles and adjusts the blanket around her, making sure she’s comfortable before they go. “You sure you don’t want to come?” Steve asks again.
Tony doesn’t stick around much after that. Bruce had offered him to stay and work with him, but for the first time in his life, Tony was saying no to work. His mind was occupied with the worst thoughts possible, and even working alongside Bruce couldn’t rid him of the horrible things his brain conjured up.
Peter frowns and his eyes roam over the purple bruise on his father’s cheek and the blood around his nose. He’s gentle when he stretches out his hands to cup his papa’s face.
It’s hard to imagine that it has been almost a year. She had grown significantly since then but it was evident her time spent under Hydra’s care was harsh. She’s tiny and her blond hair is long and matted. There’s a couple of bruises on her legs and arms. The other pups weren’t in any better condition. They too were dirty and had proof of abuse on their skin.
“No, don't do that to him. He loves being Spider-Man and Harley loves-” Morgan pauses to glance down at her baby brother and ruffles his hair. “-he loves being spoiled.”
“I know it’s difficult,” Nick continues, “but I need you to tell me everything you know. Alexander was an old friend of mine.”
They don’t say anything, and even if they did, Tony doesn’t stick around to hear it. He needs to be with Steve.
Steve answers anyway. “A lot. He had other alphas for when I was in heat but...sometimes...sometimes he wanted me for himself. He’s very jealous. I was his property...he could do whatever he wanted and I had to do it.”
His prayers are answered when the door opens and Steve is being wheeled into the room by a nurse. Tony’s never been so happy to see him.
Steve takes another deep breath and wipes his sweaty palms over the front of his slacks. In just a few minutes Pepper would come in and announce that it was time. It was nerve wracking.
“Go right ahead,” The alpha encourages, sensing Steve’s hesitancy. “Did you get all of me? Let me turn around.” Sam smiles and turns around, peering over his shoulder at Steve. The omega smiles back.
The subject of Tony’s dreams is left for another time. With their pups asleep and not appearing to suffer from another nightmare any time soon, they’re able to have one night without interruptions.
With a sigh, Steve slips the letter in an envelope and tucks it away in the drawer of his desk. Maybe one day he’d have the courage to mail it off. And maybe this would be the letter Tony responded to.
They talk about Steve’s new life and the friends he’s made during his stay. Steve shows off all of his new sketches. He’s happier. He’s finally at peace with himself
“It hurts like a bitch,” Tony answers Bruce’s question. “Please tell me you have something to help him out.”
Steve falls asleep soon after that. Tony gently strokes along Steve’s face, then he leans in to place a kiss to Steve’s forehead.
The nurse lingers nearby, checking the monitors the baby is still connected to. She offers help when Steve needs her, but otherwise she’s giving the new father space to bond with his baby.
“I don’t know.” That was definitely not the right answer because Tony is reaching for Steve’s shirt and throwing it at him. “Tony, I’m sorry.”
Peter squeezes his eyes shut. He waits for the beating to stop. He waits for the fingers to stop threading through his hair.
Steve ducks his head down to place a kiss on the top of Tony’s head, then he leaves the room to call the doctor and get more blueberries.
Tony was known for staying up for hours and avoiding sleep. Steve has scolded him more times than he can count. So one night when Tony is found passed out on the sofa in the communal living room during movie night, it doesn’t go unnoticed by Steve or their teammates. Tony was quick to defend himself, blaming his lack of caffeine as the issue. But Steve didn’t buy it.
Steve realizes just how scary that thought actually is now that he’s said it out loud. Peter was growing so fast and showing signs of walking. Steve had been thrilled when his son increased his motor skills, but now he couldn’t help but feel anxious.
“Our friends, sweetheart.” Tony sits up to stretch, the muscles in his shoulders popping. “They like you,” he adds when he notices the look of uncertainty on Steve’s face. “Honest. If it’s Happy you’re worried about-”
Alexander joins him, his thin lips splitting into a smile across his face. “Mr. Stark, it’s a pleasure to finally meet you.”
Steve knew his boyfriend was hiding something. Tony was good at keeping things to himself, but Steve knew the alpha well enough. It’s worrisome, and as much as Steve wants to question his mate about the shift in his behavior, he knows he needs to be cautious. Tony rarely opened up; it was still a struggle and the alpha was working hard to achieve the confidence to be more open.
“But I need your help. You promised you’d be there if I ever needed you...and I need you now. Your weapons have gotten into the wrong hands...there’s a base in Siberia where they’re being traded; I need to shut it down, but I can’t do that without you. Take my place. Please, Tony. I’ll never ask for anything again.”
He doesn’t get very far. His thoughts are once again plagued with Steve and the painful regrets. He’s reminded of his second chance sleeping on the floor above him. He doesn’t know much about the kid that’s forever turned his life upside down, but he knows he’d do anything for him.
Steve brings his baby close, and places a kiss along his wet, sticky hair. Peter’s cries die down; he senses his mother.
Steve offers a smile, hoping it would bring some sort of reassurance to his friend. It seems to relax Sam a bit, at least enough for him to drop the conversation and allow Steve to walk away.
The room breaks out into a flurry of activity. The baby is passed to one of the nurses and whisked away. Steve’s gaze follows after her, hoping to catch another glimpse of the baby. He doesn’t.
“I’m fine with that. I always wondered what they were like. I never...well, you know the story. Yeah. Yeah I think we should do that.” Steve smiles and rubs at his belly. “I think he likes the idea too. He’s moving.”
“Right. Because bleeding is a good sign.” Tony rolls his eyes. He pulls out the contents he needs from the kit and gestures for Steve’s hand. Steve huffs and allows him to take care of the wound. “What did you do? Smash your hand through the frame?”
Peter peers up at his father, brown eyes full of confusion and curiosity. He glances down, deciding that his toys were more interesting. Peter babbles happily at his building blocks and tries to stick one in his mouth. But Steve is faster and he takes the block away.
This was supposed to be the last chapter but I’ll add one more short one just to show what happened after Steve left. A lot of you guessed correctly 😉
“What was I supposed to do, Pep! He was cold and alone and-and I couldn’t just leave him. He also said he knew me and now there’s a baby involved.”
“Petey,” Steve soothes, reaching into the crib to take his son into his arms. Peter reacts to the touch with a whimper, his eyes opening for a moment before squeezing shut and his bottom lip jutting out. “Shh, it’s okay. I’m sorry.”
Steve chokes out a sob and casts his head down. Tony urges him to lift it and their eyes meet again.
“This is your fault too,” Tony continues. His eyes fill with tears again. “You should’ve told me the truth. I’m sorry I didn’t respond but you could’ve done more! Why didn’t you! Why didn’t you just tell me!”
The images of Steve’s face is all he can see. But his mind is a lot crueler than he thought. He’s forced to relive the moment he knew he loved Steve, the night after they slept together, the way he left and never came back, their last night together. He’d give anything to go back and fix his mistakes. Maybe Steve would still be alive if he had stopped caring about himself.
“Yeah well this is...let’s start fresh tomorrow. I think we both need to...think things through. And no that’s not me blowing you off. We’re both nervous.”
“Good. He’s with Pete now. We’re trying to get ready for this move on top of dealing with a newborn so it’s been crazy. He’s good, though.” Tony can’t help but smile at the thought of his mate. Steve was probably more than good, but Tony didn’t want to take up anymore of Pepper’s time.
“He’s okay,” Tony tells them. He knows they don’t believe him. How could they when he doesn’t even believe his own words?
“I can only go so fast. Do you see the traffic out here?” Happy gestures to the line of cars in front of them. “You’re going to be late. Later than you already are.”
Steve sighs and leans back in his seat. He’s definitely not hungry now. “I know. I’m trying to figure out how to do it.”
“Hang on. I don’t want to be near you-I mean not like that but I can’t-” Tony sighs. “I don’t want to hurt you. Not again.”
The nurse is coming back, and for a moment Steve fears she’s going to take the baby away and place him back in the incubator, but instead she’s coming over to assist with feeding.
Steve smiles and glances down to quickly wipe the tears that escape. For the first time in a long time, he had control over his body. It was an incredible feeling knowing that the strings had been cut and he was finally free. He was nobody’s puppet. Not anymore.
Tony hums against his lips and pulls Steve closer. Steve follows willingly, the urge to be near his mate too strong to ignore. They break apart and Tony lovingly strokes the side of Steve’s face.
Steve quickly glances down at his lap, finding the small hole in his faded jeans more interesting. “Everything,” he finally says.
“Yep!” Tony grins and leans back in his seat. “I’m still working on it but I think I have a basic design so far.”
But that wasn’t reality. Leaving Steve was not an option. Tony loved him too much. The baby was another story.
Morgan nods and plops down in one of the stools at the island. She does her best not to worry and convinces herself that for once she would come first. Spider-Man and her baby brother would have to wait this time. It was her turn.
The door to his side is thrown open and Happy is there, ready to assist in any way he can. Steve screams again and one hand flies out, finding purchase in Happy’s arm and gripping it tight.
Steve nods and continues eating the ice cream. He’ll regret it later, but Natasha was right, ice cream does help. And so do friends.
Peter shakes his head and hugs Tony tightly. He pulls away so that their eyes can meet. “Daddy,” he says with a frown on his face and sad brown eyes. “I couldn’t find a costume.”
“I’ll call him,” Natasha decides and reaches forward to grab her phone off the coffee table. “I’m sure he’s going to love this.”
It was a beautiful sight to witness Steve so happy when he was with Morgan. She had managed to awaken something inside him, something that Steve claimed died out years ago. That simple life he wanted was starting to become a reality.
“Submit,” Steve growls and with his free hand, uses it to hold the alpha’s head down. The alpha puts up a struggle and Steve responds by slamming Rollins’ head into the wall. He had only meant to do it once, but something courses through him, a strong energy shooting through his arm and forcing him to keep slamming the alpha’s head into the wall. He doesn’t even realize he’s screaming through it, all he cares about is hurting one of the bullies that’s picked on him.
“I can assume by that goofy smile on your face that it’s good news,” Tony says and Steve looks up at him, finding a similar smile on his own.
Happy pulls the vehicle toward the back. It’s a smart move. Entering SI from the front entrance with a complete stranger following Tony Stark around would only bring unwanted attention.
The sound of Morgan’s cries reaches his ears, distracting him from the battle he was having with himself. He sets the knife down and wipes his hand clean with a dish towel before making his way upstairs to get her.
“Jesus.” Tony runs a hand through his hair. He’s beginning to lose his cool as he absorbs the words Steve is telling him. He was always curious about Steve’s past, but hearing it for the first time makes him regret wanting to learn. “I’ll kill him. If I see him I swear to God-”
It’s a bittersweet moment. Steve got his wish, but he didn’t get to experience his pregnancy like he had used to envision he would. He missed out on the first ultrasound pictures, the first time he felt the baby moving. He missed out on picking names and having a baby shower thrown for him.
He never gets the chance. The urge to fuck is overwhelming. He doesn’t waste any more time and he thrusts a finger inside. The omega moans in delight, his back arching off the bench. He’s so tight and wet; Tony can only imagine how great he’s going to feel wrapped around his cock.
Steve frowns in confusion. He’s heard those words before. Natasha has said them to him the night he was rescued. It didn’t make sense then and it didn’t now. Why did SHIELD want him?
Tony takes longer than he needs to when it comes to saying goodbye to his son. Peter is alert, staring up at him with the eyes Tony can’t get enough of. If all goes well-he’s crossing his fingers that it does-he’d be back tomorrow and able to spend more time with Peter.
Steve finishes up and emerges from the bathroom. He climbs into bed and curls up beside Tony, a content sigh leaving his lips. Tony leans down to kiss the top of Steve’s head.
But Peter was letting himself get carried away. He needed to think and think and think until he was a hundred percent sure about what he wanted. He thought he could make a big decision alone, but maybe he needed another person.
“Isn’t it? Tony, the signs were right there and I let my stubbornness get in the way and now...now I don’t even know how our son is.”
Steve flushes with embarrassment and hides his face in the crook of Tony’s neck. Tony huffs in annoyance, but he knows the AI was right. The pups were healing nicely. The last thing they needed was another traumatic event.
When he returns, he’s relieved to find Tony finished and leaning against the wall. Steve steps further into the room, purposely avoiding the mess he knows he needs to clean up and flush away. He puts the seat down quickly to avoid it a little longer.
“I don’t love him.” Those were not the right words to say. The table falls silent and all eyes fall on Steve. He shifts uncomfortably under their gaze, and with a clear of his throat, pretends to be interested in his now cold breakfast.
Rumlow is pushed to the ground, Steve pinning him down and punching him repeatedly in the face, decorating the skin with dark bruises and blood. Steve places both hands over the alpha’s head, digging his nails deep into the sides, emitting a painful scream from the alpha.
“It was,” Steve admits. He reaches out with one hand to gently stroke Morgan’s cheek. “But it was worth it.”
“Hey, Petey-Pie,” Tony coos and drops the gun to touch his son. Peter stirs and his face scrunches up, a soft whimper escaping his pouty lips. “Shh. I know, kiddo. Daddy’s here. Mommy’s here too. We’re gonna get you out of here.”
“Just don’t hurt him again,” Pepper points a threatening finger in Tony’s direction, then she turns on her heels and heads toward the door. She opens it, turns back around and says, “And call Rhodey.”
Hi, guys! Ugh I'm sorry for this late post and probably not so great chapter. I hope the pace of this story isn't too slow. I don't want to rush in some things because Tony and Steve are still learning about each other. This chapter is pretty much some more backstory and them being cute. They're figuring things out I guess.
The effects of the alcohol and their mating session was enough to wear the alpha out. Steve had contemplated falling asleep just to escape the nightmare he’s found himself in, but he forced himself to remain awake.
“Stop!” Peter screams. “My name is Peter! All you refer to me as is ‘kid’. Do you even think of me as your son? Or are you doing this  because you screwed up and feel guilty?”
“Why? It doesn’t affect him,” Peter grumbles and rises to his feet, taking a step away from his bed and running a hand through his hair. “This isn’t about him! It’s about me!”
“When did you get here?” Steve decides to ask. He knew that Tony informed the team about the situation, but more details still needed to be shared.
“Really?” Peter’s face lights up and his eyes flicker in the direction of the Stark pad laying on the bench. “Can I see?”
Peter rolls his eyes playfully and throws an arm around his sister’s shoulders, steering her out of the bedroom.
“I know, I know. But this is how I cope. I make jokes. Honestly, I’m terrified. I can’t have a kid. Look who I am.”
“Keeping this to myself isn’t working anymore. That’s why I’m doing this, remember?” Steve asks, his tone growing bitter. Tony knows better than to upset him, especially when he was already in such a fragile state.
“I’m sorry,” Peter whispers, followed by a sniff. The tears in his eyes don’t go unnoticed and Tony scoots closer to wrap him in a hug. Peter clings to him tightly, missing the comfort. “I’m sorry, dad. I’m sorry I screwed up.”
“No. He wouldn’t let them. He was the only one who got to...mate with me.” Steve’s stomach churns at the memories, at the nightmares. He hated using the word mate to describe what they used to do. It wasn’t mating at all. It was abuse.
“Shh, it’s okay.” It’s far from it, Tony knows this, but he doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say. Any ideas he does have doesn’t seem like the response. The only thing he can do is hold Steve.
But all of that changed once Peter came into his life. His family was the most important thing. They would always come first. The tech, the company, none of that mattered anymore. The whole reason why he signed over SI was so that he could be a devoted father and mate.
Their glasses clink and they both take a drink. Even the champagne tastes expensive, but Steve’s not about to bring up money and the simplicity he asked for.
Peter slants in his seat and peeks Ned’s way, finding him frowning again. It’s not just him. Happy has a similar expression on his face.
Steve pauses his packing when his belly spasms. He cries out and grips the side of his stomach, taking deep, slow breaths as he waits it out. They were closer now and the intensity was increasing.
“When is Bruce arriving?” Steve asks and he reaches for the glass of orange juice Tony’s poured for him.
“Don’t worry about it. I’m here for you. You know that, right? If you ever need me, for anything, I’m here. You mean a lot to everyone, Steve. I hope you know that.”
Steve frowns but continues to sip the tea anyway. Tony hands him the vitamins and Steve takes them without a fight. Tony hides his pleased grin behind his coffee cup.
“You have to remember Steve probably didn’t have half of the things Peter has today. He’s just trying to give him more.”
“I think I know what it is.” Steve leans down to connect their lips, moaning softly when Tony reaches up to thread his fingers through his hair.
“Yeah.” Nick agrees, and Steve notices the smile tugging at his lips. Peter was a favorite among nearly everyone he came across. He had won Nick over almost instantly. The Director never admitted how attached he was to the kid, but Steve knew Nick was growing soft.
Tony tries not to worry when Steve ignores his calls and texts, and again when hours pass and he’s still not home. He convinces himself that Steve was fine, probably out on a run or beating a few bags down in the gym. Those were usually the activities he did when he needed to clear his head. This was just another one of those times.
Tony’s confused as to why he was dragged away to meet with Alexander, but the nicely decorated room is the perfect escape from the party. For once Tony was getting tired of mingling and talking about himself.
Tony was so used to being alone when he worked that he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to share the space with him. He stayed up too late and consumed more coffee than a human should, and not to mention the change of persona when lack of sleep and too much caffeine mixed together. Pepper couldn’t stand him when he worked and made sure to stay far away when he got in his headspace. But Steve was different. Steve liked staying with him.
“Did you do this so that I’d have something to be happy about? I’m happy that we’re having a baby. I don’t need a party.”
The security footage appears, showing a black SUV pulling up the tower’s entrance. Alexander Pierce appears first, followed by a very drunk and stumbling Tony. The image of him is cringe worthy, but he’s seen worse.
Steve hesitates. He’s not sure if he can. He reminds himself that he’s opened up to Tony before, but his nightmares hadn’t had the chance to come up. There was more that he wasn’t telling the alpha. He honestly wasn’t sure how Tony would feel about him if he knew the truth.
“Yes. You can use whatever you want here and if you need something else just let me know. This will be your personal space, lab, whatever. I just really need your help.”
“I think I have to push,” Steve says, a little unsurely. The next contraction hits, followed by pressure between his legs. Steve gives into the urge and bears down, grunting softly from the strain. “Tony, I’m...I’m pushing. Get Bruce.”
Thank you guys for the lovely feedback and for sticking it out with me. I really do have the best readers in the world :)
“Um.” Tony frowns as he studies his own drink, forgetting most of the ingredients he had put in. “I don’t know. It’s healthy so…”
Steve is woken up before the sun has even risen. He grumbles and pulls the blankets over his head when someone shakes him again.
They watch the video a few more times. Peter cries initially, but then he’s laughing and smiling. Tony shows him the other videos he has. He can tell it beats any movie Peter has ever seen.
“Exactly. I didn’t do anything and now Pete...now he’s...Tony, I wish I knew. I wish I took better care of him.”
“But I am, Tony. Me not being there means I’m missing important milestones. What if I miss her first steps or first word?”
Now that wasn’t to say that Steve didn’t love his children. From the moment he held Harley and Peter, his heart swelled with joy and a promise had been made to protect and love them for as long as he lived. He loved being a mother. It was the greatest, most rewarding job in the world.
He doesn’t want his friends to see him like this. They have already been worried about him since he started feeling off. His stomach churns at the thought of having to tell them the news, of having to tell
Peter sighs but backs off. He makes himself comfortable on the sofa, making sure he doesn’t mess up the clothing his dad has thrown on the cushion beside him. He turns in his seat so that he can continue to watch his dad work.
“Hey.” Comes Tony’s voice and Steve lifts his head, connecting his eyes with those of his alpha. Steve smiles warmly at him and gets one in return. “Is he asleep?” Tony asks when he comes over, making sure his voice is low enough to not disturb his son.
“Hey I’m not judging,” Sam holds up his hands in defense. “I think it’s awesome what you did. There needs to be more people sticking up for what’s right. You’re a hero.”
Natasha rushes to his side to comfort him, wrapping him in her arms and hugging him close. “I know. He’s all I think about too.”
Steve’s eyes shoot open when the jet rocks roughly, his body jerking in his seat. He gasps and he forces himself to look out the little window. He half expects to find the jet going nose first into frozen water, but he’s quick to remind himself that this wasn’t like that. He was safe now. Tony was keeping him safe.
Steve huffs out a laugh and moves toward the bed, taking a seat on the edge and letting out a heavy sigh. He glances down in his arms, smiling when Morgan peers up at him to show off her own small smile.
“You thought what! That you would take that away? You know that’s our time together. You know feeding her was my thing, Tony! Mine!”
“I guess I’m worrying for nothing,” Steve continues their previous conversation. “The baby’s healthy.”
Tony digs the bottle out of the bag and hands it over to Natasha. She doesn’t complain about feeding him. The smile on her face proves she’s more than happy to spend some time with her nephew. She moves to the couch, carefully lowering herself down. Tony takes the spot next to her, letting out a heavy sigh and tipping his head over the back of the couch.
Peter eventually calms down enough for Tony to resume his other projects. Peter doesn’t offer to help like he normally does, instead he sits quietly beside Tony and watches him work. Tony decided to bring out the designs for his son’s suit in hopes of cheering him up.
Sam rolls his eyes. “Fine. But if he is then it’s not a big deal. This one-” Sam jabs a thumb in Peter’s direction. “- has the serum and he came out just fine.”
“You ready for some breakfast?” Steve asks as he carries Peter down the stairs and toward the kitchen.
Tony pays attention to the way the omega’s body reacts. Steve’s breathing picks up, he grows tighter around Tony’s cock.
They should be back at the party with their friends, basking in the glow of their victory. But after a couple of drinks, they’re sneaking away from the guests and up to Tony’s penthouse.
Steve was nowhere in sight, but any questions regarding his absence is quickly answered when Tony gets a whiff of freshly brewed coffee. He makes his way toward the kitchen, mentally preparing himself for what scene he’s going to walk into today. To his surprise and amazement, Steve is lounging on the sofa, quietly reading the paper.
He goes through the pages until he finds what he’s looking for. The picture is of Peter when he was no older than two and playing in the bathtub. A very wet and annoyed Steve is frowning up at the camera.
Steve huffs. The book wobbles and falls over when the baby decides to switch positions. Steve chuckles and rearranges the book, only for another strong kick to push it off again.
“Me? Oh yeah. Steve has made sure of that. Did I tell you we’re mates now? It sort of happened...a few weeks ago. Okay, maybe I suck at communicating.”
“Hmm.” Tony hums and he strides over to investigate for himself. “Maybe. Or maybe…” Tony grunts softly as he too struggles with the belt. “Maybe you need a new suit. You could’ve had a growth spurt.”
Tony smiles softly. “I’ll be fine. I don’t want you doing a damn thing while I’m gone. If you need to nest then fine but don’t worry about anything else. I don’t want a phone call in the middle of the night because you’ve gone into labor.”
“I’ll save you, Papa!” Peter declares, raising his shield in the air. He zooms around the room, pretending to fight the bad guys and making his own fighting sound effects.
“He wasn’t perfect okay? He...he did things that I didn’t understand but I loved him anyway. Yeah his job was...probably the hardest job there is...but he only did it because he wanted to keep me safe. Every day he would tell me that he loved me and that he wanted me safe and happy.
He’s practically leaning on Tony for support while they make their way upstairs. They move slowly and cautiously, careful not to disturb any of the injuries Steve had. Tony honestly wasn’t sure what kind of damage Steve has sustained. The super solider was too damn stubborn.
Steve turns and makes his way toward the door, pausing when he has one hand on the knob. “I’ll calm your dad down. Just take it easy okay? Let me know if you need anything.”
“We’re gonna go,” Natasha says and she passes Peter back to Tony. Clint whines behind her and she whips her head around to scold him again. “You ruined it. Let’s go.”
“Yeah,” Steve says. Though his words don’t ease Tony’s worried mind. He shifts in his seat and his eyes squeeze shut. “I’ll be right back.”
Peter is passed out, head resting on Steve’s shoulder and small fingers barely hanging onto the handle of his trick or treat bag. The red tie hangs loosely around his neck and the gel in his hair has lost its hold. The makeup on his face has faded, leaving behind brown smears of paint.
Now...Tony wasn’t sure what was going on inside his husband’s head, and if he was still truly excited about their daughter.
He doesn’t voice his complaints, not wanting to dampen the mood. He sneaks a glance in Steve’s direction, finding a bright smile and twinkling eyes. It’s been too long since he’s seen Steve this excited and happy. The negative results they’ve been getting lately was taking a toll on Steve. Tony is relieved that they’re finally able to have the one thing Steve has been desiring.
Ned nods in understanding and he releases his own sad sigh. “I’m sorry, Peter. Is there anything I can do?”
Steve smiles softly. “Thank you, Tony,” he says and he places a hand over his belly. “I think we’re warming up.”
“He’s okay, buddy,” Tony assures the dog, earning a bark in response. Dodger is growing impatient and he tugs on Tony’s sleeve again. “Okay, okay. We’re going.”
Tony shuts down the lab and leads his son back toward the elevator and up to the penthouse. Peter is looking at his phone, yawning some more as he scrolls through his messages.
“You know…” Tony says after a few minutes of silence passes between them. “I think I could go again.”
“You shouldn’t be. Fuck!” Tony groans and throws his head back against the pillows. “You just had a baby.”
As far as birthdays go, Peter’s 16th was just as he imagined it. Well, except for the heartbreaking fact that his papa wasn’t there to see it. The day was bittersweet. But his uncles and aunt still managed to do what they could to make Peter’s day special, not wanting another incident like the one at Steve’s party to occur. This day was strictly about Peter and Peter alone.
Sam doesn’t squeeze his hand this time, but instead brings it up to his lips and places a soft kiss to Bucky’s knuckles.
Tony curls up closer and it’s not long before he’s relaxed and drifting off to sleep. Steve remains awake, wanting to be ready in case Tony needs him again.
Tony winces and takes the spot on the couch beside his mate. “I might’ve let him skip nap time so we can hang out in the lab.”
Tony pulls back slightly so that he can press a kiss to Steve’s forehead. Tears are running down Steve’s face, and Tony gently wipes them away. He kisses Steve softly on the lips.
“As I was saying,” Jarvis continues, his tone laced with annoyance. Tony rolls his eyes but allows him to continue. “Once mated your bond will be stronger, of course that would be true if you two were to properly bond. He’d have your mark and you’d have his.”
Poor Steve still has a lot of issues to work through. The next chapter will focus on the therapy, and him healing. Maybe some smut? Tony will make it romantic of course 😉
! I’m the worst person he should ever meet. I shouldn’t even be in his life! I’m a fuck up and all I did was hurt the one person I loved. How can he even want to meet me, Pep? I ruined his life.”
Steve glances over his shoulder and narrows his eyes, then he continues to get dressed. Tony comes closer, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist and placing a kiss to his bare shoulder. “I love you.”
Steve smiles and trails a hand between them to get to the small bump he can’t get enough of. He rubs along the curve of Tony’s belly.
“Sorry, Papa,” he sighs again and takes his original spot beside the gravestone:sitting crossed legged in front of it. He wipes away the bit of dirt that has covered his father’s name. “I messed up the flowers. I hope you like them anyway. Auntie Nat said you probably would. She’s doing….”
Peter was special, and Steve wasn’t just saying that because that was his son. Peter had proved at an early age that he wasn’t going to be like most children. Steve knew children went through some phases, but Peter’s wasn’t a phase or a normal one at that.
“I love you so much. You know that, right? I know sometimes...it doesn’t seem like it but I promise I love you more than anything. I’m going to get better okay? I may not be a perfect father but I’m trying.”
“I made him an appointment to see Bruce next week,” Steve says as he starts rinsing off the plates to stick them into the dishwasher.
“I think you’re thinking too much about it. Obviously you went out and had a good time and that’s the end of it.”
Tony drops the topic and continues to follow his son until they’re stepping into the common room. It’s decorated in Independence Day colors, but all Tony can see is Steve. He wonders if Steve really did stick around to check on his family. Maybe he’d be lucky to feel Steve’s presence the way Peter can.
When Bucky shifts in his seat, Sam quickly squeezes his hand again. He’s met with a gentle squeeze back.
Tony has no choice but to give in. “Okay,” he says with a fake smile. Steve smiles back. “Let’s have a baby.”
For the most part she does. The only time Morgan makes any signs of discomfort is when Tony shifts his arm. It’s easy to calm her down and soon she’s drifting back off to sleep.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Steve sobs and Tony pulls him into his arms. Steve buries his face into Tony’s neck, sobbing. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
Steve doesn’t even wait to watch the jet take off. He usually stayed behind until the jet could no longer be seen, but as soon as it’s lifting off the ground, he turns around and takes Peter back inside.
Shutting everyone out wasn’t his best move, but the last few years had been difficult to get through. Turning to alcohol again was also not his brightest idea, but he didn’t know how to deal with life when it got too rough. Hiding away from it all was how he coped.
“She’s a daddy’s girl, huh?” Steve jokes and crawls onto the bed to join them. Tony smiles and gives a small shrug in response. “I knew it. The boy’s love you too.”
“California. I have a mansion in Malibu that we can lay low in for a while. Maybe until the baby is born.”
“I won’t. I’m not like the alphas that will have you cook and clean all day. This isn’t the fort-never mind. Sorry.”
Now that he has some alcohol in him, he gets back to work, needing a distraction from the chaos that is his life. He doesn’t want to think about the omega upstairs and the heavy baggage he has with him. He doesn’t want to think about the pup. He doesn’t want to think about the pain he’s caused.
Morgan is placed back in Tony’s arms and Happy leaves to notify their friends of the newest arrival. Tony takes his original spot beside Steve, smiling when his husband curls up close.
“And there can be limited photography. If you don’t want the pups to be featured then I can request that,” Pepper says.
This was Tony’s chance to tell him how he felt. But Tony stops himself. What they did could never happen again. They were just too different and it was painfully obvious that they worked better when they were drinking. Tony didn’t want that. He wanted Steve, but he didn’t want the clashing and fighting. They were going to butt heads no matter what and the last thing Tony wanted to do was put Steve through that. That wouldn’t be a healthy relationship for either one of them.
Rumlow steps toward the pair, raising his baton to issue an attack to the disobedient omega, but he’s forced to stop when his superior orders him to back down.
Alpha comes over with the glass of his favorite alcohol in his hand. Steve’s gaze lingers on the glass a little longer than he means to. He doesn’t like when the alpha becomes intoxicated.
Tony nods and lets go of Steve’s hand to reach up and wipe the tears that are still falling down his face.
Sam sighs sadly. “He was a pararescueman working alongside me. Long story short, an RPG knocked him out of the sky. Nothing I could do.”
Steve is passed out the moment they’re back in his private room. Tony stays by his side, gently stroking his face until he can no longer fight his own exhaustion. The chair isn’t the most comfortable place to take a nap in, but it would do. He can’t imagine leaving Steve’s side.
This chapter focuses on Tony and his grief. I’m sorry but he needs to suffer a little...right? Or is that too harsh? He did make Steve suffer for years so... 🤷♀️
Peter doesn’t go home right away. He swings by the cemetery to talk to his papa, staying longer than he means to. A part of him doesn’t even feel guilty about returning home later than he’s expected. Stopping by his papa’s grave and talking to him has become a routine for Peter. He can’t imagine skipping the best part of his day.
Steve finds his old sketchbook and one of his fine pens, then he begins to write. It’s not as simple as saying two words like Sam had said; it’s a lot harder than Steve thought.
Tony takes a deep breath and steps away to put some distance between them. Their mixed scents were strong, the foul, bitter stench penetrating the air.
They hadn’t decided on a name for her. Tony liked the name Morgan whereas Steve wasn’t sure what to name their daughter. Tony insisted on calling her Morgan whenever he spoke to her, and eventually he created the nickname and began using that.
His fingers drum nervously on the wheel of his Audi R8. He had purposely told Happy not to bother being his chauffeur today. His friend had been hesitant to leave Tony alone, but Tony was quick to assure him. Peter was just a kid. Not scary whatsoever. But in reality he was the most terrifying person to walk into Tony’s life.
“It’s not!” Steve snaps and with a huff and he joins Tony on the bed. “I don’t know what we’re doing wrong. I just can’t get pregnant. I was sure this was it.”
They were all dealing with their own shit, some maybe dealing with worse. Peter didn’t want to say that his issues were harder than anyone else’s. There was always someone who had it harder.
“He’ll be fine.” Tony assures. He knew how much his boyfriend worried when Peter wasn’t with them. “We’ll be back soonish.”
“Eat,” the alpha instructs. He takes the seat opposite of the omega and brings the glass to his lips, grinning behind the rim. “I can assure you that this isn’t some kind of trick. It’s a celebration. You’re carrying the next generation of Hydra.”
“That’s today? I almost forgot.” Steve yawns and he sits up to stretch. The sweatshirt he has on rides up, exposing smooth skin and the bump growing underneath it. Tony’s eyes are immediately drawn to it, and his heart flutters. That was his baby.
Tony is up before Steve. It’s something he’s started doing lately on purpose. He was usually the one sleeping in until Steve woke him and dragged him out of bed. But as of late, it’s Tony getting up before the sun to make a fresh pot of coffee and await for Steve to awaken from his slumber.
“Right on time,” Tony says when Steve and the pups approach him. “I wanted to introduce the kids to J.”
The flight is long, giving Steve a lot of time to think. His stomach coils, his anxiety getting the best of him and making him sick. He couldn’t even finish the briefing and let Sam take over, another sign that he was ready to step away from this life and let someone else take over.
Tony screams again. His eyes flood with tears, a few of them escaping and rolling down his face. He blinks the rest back to clear his vision. He can still hear the medical staff encouraging him, but it’s not enough. He needs Steve.
He approaches the desk and sits down in the chair, a heavy sigh leaving his lips. His eyes are immediately drawn to the first drawer and he slides it open, his vision blurring at the sight of the sketchbook inside.
He makes sure no attention is on him when he approaches the vehicle. Of course he can’t be too sure if anyone’s noticed or not. It’s not everyday a car like this shows up.
It makes him sick just thinking about the way they created that baby. It was all wrong. It was disgusting. It was evil.
The door is opening and Tony jumps up from his seat. Steve steps out of the room, shooting Tony a small smile when their eyes meet.
Sorry this chapter is a little on the short side. I wanted to get this one updated before focusing on other works that need my attention. Thank you so much for all the love and support! You guys are amazing and I love each and every one of you 😊 ❤️❤️❤️
“Okay.” Steve nods, a little unsure. His eyes land on the pizza that was forgotten. “Guess I kinda ruined dinner, huh?”
After Peter’s exam, Steve takes him in his arms and works on calming his baby down. Peter senses comfort almost immediately and his wails soon die down until they’re little whimpers and hiccups.
They’re back at the safety of the compound. The mission had been a success and they were lucky enough to walk away with only a few scraps and bruises. Steve appears in the worst condition, but he shrugs it off. He’s used to the cuts and bruises that come with the assignments.
So when the day of the appointment arrives, Steve can’t seem to keep his nerves under control. He’s worried about the baby’s health and he hopes everything is going smoothly. He’s also excited about finding out the gender. He crosses his fingers that the baby cooperates.
The bear is blue and wearing a version of Captain America’s uniform. It had been a gift from both Bucky and Sam. It was Sam’s idea to get the bear, knowing it would help cheer their nephew up whenever Steve needed to go. And Sam had been right. Bucky hated when his husband was right because it usually led to bragging.
Steve is out of his seat in seconds and rushing toward his son, pulling him into his arms and hugging him close. One hand rests on Peter’s back and the other cradles his head, comforting him the way he used to when Peter was younger.
The only item furnishing the room is a single mattress, laid out in the center of the stone floor. It’s dirty and torn from obvious wear and tear.
Steve rushes to the door and his hand wraps around the knob, but he can’t bring himself to turn it. He wants nothing more than to run after Tony and tell him everything, but he doesn’t. What good would that do? Tony was engaged. He was happy.
“I’m serious! Let me take you out on a nice dinner and then we can come back here and cuddle all you want.”
“Was he different when you two…never mind. I wish you could answer me. I hate not knowing what to do. You always knew what to do. I miss you so much, Papa.”
“I never said that. He can stay here until we figure it out. But first I have to talk to Mr. Pierce.”
“Yes yes I know. I’m just kidding. At least yours will probably go away soon. I still have months of this torture.”
Steve jumps up to his feet and Tony backs away. “Tony, please? You’re not him. Believe me you’re not.”
“Dad!” Peter groans and sags in his chair. He glances over at Flash, noticing how pale and terrified he looks.
Both babies are fast asleep by the time they make it to the elevator. Steve carries Harley while Tony takes Peter. The doors shut and both men rest their heads back against the wall.
This time Steve does feel it and he gasps in surprise. The kicks their son produces aren’t very strong, but regardless of their strength, they’re bringing a smile to Steve’s face.
Steve is sitting up in the bed when Tony enters the room, clutching onto Bucky and sobbing uncontrollably. Tony meets Bucky’s steel blue eyes, not missing the hurt that floods through them. Sam is nearby, rubbing Steve’s shoulder soothingly.
“I’m sorry, honey. I know that you wanted them. I know you wanted Peter. But I didn’t. I had to get rid of them.”
Steve nods in understanding and keeps the drive silent. Well, as silent as he can. He peers in Peter’s direction every few minutes, wishing he could read what was on his son’s worried mind. He has a vague idea about the thoughts swimming in there, but he doesn’t want to pry. That would only make Peter more uncomfortable.
Peter is sleeping peacefully when Steve enters the nursery. He hates that he has to disturb him from their first good night together.
“If you’re training him then I know he will be. It’s a shame you’re leaving. You’re one of the best.”
“I think you need to go home and sit down with him. He’s holding things in, too. Go talk to him. And really listen. Because he’s in pain and sometimes, all he probably wants is for you to just listen.”
Before Tony can even respond to the question, it’s being answered for him when Steve enters the room with Sam and Bucky trailing behind him.
Tony nods and leaves in search of his bodyguard. He doesn’t have to look very far, Happy is coming toward the door with the two bags.
“Whoa! Easy there, kiddo,” Tony says when he enters the kitchen. He keeps the test behind his back and out of view. He doesn’t know how he’s going to ask his son about it, knowing if he’s too rough then he’ll have Steve to answer to.
Tony is too lost in the feeling of finally being inside Steve that he doesn’t notice the lack of physical contact. He moves faster, increasing the pace and roughness of his thrusts. Steve is vocal, moans and whimpers slipping past his lips with each hard thrust. The sound only urges the alpha on.
Her words are like a punch to the gut. All of the air in Tony’s lungs vanish and he’s left gasping. Time has seemed to stop. They stare at each other for God knows how long, it almost feels like hours, but it’s probably only a few seconds.
They break apart and Pepper keeps her hands on his shoulders, studying his features careful. The tears haven’t stopped and for a second he feels like shrugging her off and telling her to get back to the party. But he doesn’t. It’s humiliating to be found crying alone in the kitchen. Lord knows it hasn’t been the first time he’s been found like this, and during another party.
“Damn,” Tony mutters to himself and rubs at his head, forgetting about the bump he finds there and winces. “Must’ve been a hell of a night.”
“I didn’t have a choice. I’m sorry for leaving but you were-Steve, don’t go.” Tony knows his attempts at making Steve stay wasn’t going to work, but he had to do something.
Tony prepares a pot of coffee and cleans up around the kitchen while he waits. The whole time his thoughts are swirling. He doesn’t have a clue as to how they’re supposed to tell their son that his sibling was gone. It wasn’t a conversation Tony pictured himself ever needing to have. They were supposed to have that baby and be happy.
“Yep.” Comes Steve’s voice and both Tony and Peter glance over at the stairs. “Don’t. You. Dare.” Steve warns when he notices the growing smile on his husband’s face.
Tony doesn’t push, not wanting to start a fight in front of their teammates. Natasha must sense the tension between them and she shifts uncomfortably in her seat. Morgan is growing fussy again and before Tony can take her back, Natasha offers to calm her down and she gets up from the couch to take Morgan for a little walk.
“That’s not true,” Tony stands, ready to reach out for his son in case he tries to leave. He couldn’t let him go. Not after everything they’ve been through. “Pete, please? I didn’t know he was there.”
Steve’s hand trails down to his swollen belly, the fluttering from inside reminding him of why he did what he did. The pup in his belly didn’t deserve this life. He had to run away, get somewhere safe. But he had failed.
Steve’s head tosses and turns, his chest rising and falling rapidly. His heart is about to burst out of his chest.
It’s Morgan’s whimpers that force them apart. Steve adjusts the bottle and she’s latching on again, greedily taking her fill. Steve can’t help but chuckle at her eagerness.
The alpha sighs heavily and sets his utensils down. He wipes at his mouth with the napkin, then he’s rising to his feet and crossing the room to the bar to pour another drink.
Peter pulls away and quickly wipes away his tears, wishing for once he could get it together and stop crying. He needed to be strong. Just like his papa taught him.
Harley lies back down and it’s not long before he’s drifting off to sleep. James smiles when it’s his turn, his eyes lighting up when Steve kisses him and nuzzles their noses.
The elevator doors open and Steve steps out, walking briskly through the corridor toward the medical wing. He spots Natasha first, relief washing over him when he finds her alright. Her hair is disheveled and there are a few scratches and bruises on her face, but nothing she hasn’t endured before.
Steve is giddy with excitement when they arrive for the first doctor’s appointment. Apparently peeing on a stick and getting a stupid happy face wasn’t enough. The moment Steve had broken the news to Tony, he had rushed off to find a doctor and schedule his first appointment. Tony had taken that time to run to his workshop and lock himself inside until Steve realized he had been missing.
“Sweetie, I already added the chocolate chips. How about tomorrow we make blueberry waffles? Sound good?”
At those words, the lump in the bed moves and throws the blankets off. “Yes. But why does it have to be so early?”
“It’s a little funny, yeah. I’ve never seen a baby shower that was...this.” Steve waves one hand around the room. “No blue? We are having a boy.”
“I’m coming. But are you eventually going to come out here? I know you can practically run SI from wherever you are but-”
At those words Tony is giving him his attention. He lets out a sigh. “Don’t worry about it. It was my fault. Sometimes I say stupid things.”
But yet he still can’t help but feel uneasy about the other alpha’s presence. He decides to let it go for now and keep his attention entirely focused on the omega sitting across from him. He was so interested in him.
Steve blinks a few times, snapping out of his thoughts and back to the conversation. Pepper had removed her hands from his belly and had taken her wine glass again.
The stabbing pain in his head is what jolts Tony awake. He groans and reaches up with one hand to inspect the damage, finding a bump on the back of his head. He forces himself up into a sitting position, still rubbing at the bump that he knows will be there for the next few days.
