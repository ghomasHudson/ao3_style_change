Thirty minutes later, the taxi stopped and the four got out. "Welcome to the good life." Cas smiled. They were standing in front of Gordon Ramsey's steakhouse. "I've only eaten here once just to see if the dude really is as good as they say, and he is."
There was a knock on her window. She sat up to see Cas outside. She got up and ran to the window. "Cas? What the hell? It's the middle of the night."
"A few weeks. We have to rerecord our demo and send it in. If all goes well, we get signed then record our first album, then go on tour promoting it."
Dean opened his eyes and looked at him. “Because this is dangerous and I need you to help Sam. That's how you can help.”
The crowd went nuts. Cas looked at Dean. Holding the mic away. "It's not like you haven't sang with me before."
Cas didn’t hear his father pull up to the house. He didn’t even see him. But Zachariah saw Castiel. He fumed as he realized what was happening. Not to his son. Not to his family. They had a reputation to keep, and this would bring it tumbling down.
"Yes he did. Sorry to tell ya like this. But this man is a douchebag. You know what, he can stay away from us. I don't want him at my doorstep."
"Thanks again Sammy, for watching Ben." Dean had said it about a thousand times since he walked in the door.
God, he loved it. Dean bit his lip. The tiny amount of pain was enough to distract him temporarily, to keep himself going just a little longer.
Dean slipped out of the bed and suddenly remembered that he had only a towel with him when he came in. He wrapped it around his waist and started to leave, casting one last glance at Cas, who was already fast asleep again. Dean shook his head and went to his room. Once there, he pulled on old jeans, a tshirt that had seen better days, and grabbed his hat off the dresser. He put the hat on, stopping to tip it at a picture of his parents that hung on the wall by the door.
As he opened the desk drawer and pulled out the false bottom, grabbing a little baggie of coke when his phone rang.
"Like father like son. You think you can intimidate us?" Dean's laugh held no humor. "If I was trying to intimidate you, I wouldn't be wearing my tux." John moved in front of Dean. "Look, there's no need for any of this. My son doesn't want you here, neither does my future son in law. So please just leave. I won't allow you to ruin this day." He said calmly.
He walked to the kitchen. "Got a nice little set up in the kitchen here. Little table with a built-in booth and a window that looks out to the city." He walked to the fridge and opened it.
"I'm out of the house, my husband managed to sneak away from his team long enough to bone me... which was awesome, by the way... and I can work again. It's a pretty good day."
John walked out and stood next to Dean. "Is there a problem here?" He folded his arms over his chest. "It's okay dad, they were just leaving."
"Okay. See you in a bit."   He hung up and grabbed his keys and helmet off the coffee table and walked out the door, locking it behind him. He walked over to his motorcycle and got on. After starting it, he pushed off and darted out of the driveway.
"Did you plan that or did it just come to you?" Dean smiled. "Just came to me. Like it?" Cas smiled. "You're a dork Winchester." Dean smiled. "How much of this did you plan anyway?" Cas asked. Dean's smile grew.
“Alright guys, calm down. No need to make a scene. “ He said calmly. Cas felt a little bad for Sam. He had probably been their voice of reason all his life. Alec just put a hand up and walked away.
Alec threw his arm out at his side. “So what? Everyone's pushing me to find a mate and settle down. See me getting pissed about it? No.”
Dean sat in the silence with his eyes closed for a few minutes before he heard footsteps heading his way. “Well, well. Where were you at at this hour?” Dean sighed. “Hey, Benny. I was… thinking.” Benny sat down beside him.
"To Dean!" Everyone chimed raising their glasses. Dean raised his bottle of beer at them, smiling. "Thank you everyone. Really. It means a lot that you're here and you're gonna see me off in the morning." He put the bottle to his lips and drained the rest of his beer. "And now...I gotta get some sleep." He hugged everyone and thanked them. He clapped his dad on the shoulder and told everyone goodnight.
"Nothin. Just, you're actin like you never left is all." He moved to grab a brush and began brushing Pandora.   "Oh." Castiel turned back to RJ and pet his neck as the horse ate. He looked at Dean out of the corner of his eye and sighed. "Dean, listen. I really am sorry for leaving the way I did..."
“Okay, we can play that.” He said. He ducked down, ramming Dean with his shoulder and lifting him off the ground then slammed him on the floor. He got on top of Dean and started hitting him in the face. Dean grabbed his arm, swung his leg, pinned Alec down, and got him in an arm bar. He pulled until he heard a pop, dislocating Alec's shoulder. Alec yelled out and hit Dean in the leg repeatedly. When Dean loosened his leg hold, Alec maneuvered so he had Dean's arm. He pulled Dean up, twisted his arm behind his back and slammed Dean's face into the table while breaking Dean's wrist and dislocating his shoulder at the same time.
He went to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of whiskey and opened it, taking a long drink as he walked back to the room and sank to the floor again.
Cas flipped his guitar back around and began to play with his band. The next shots were of Jeff on drums, Adam on bass, and Benny playing rhythm guitar. There were even some slow motion shots of them playing.Then Cas got of stage and jumped on beat with the crowd, then back up on stage.Cas joined Josh at the mic he was using and sang the rest of the song together.
Suddenly, a lot of people got up and started clapping and cheering. The group looked towards the entrance. Dean was standing there, Ellen was close by followed by a man Cas hadn't seen yet.
Dean pulled into the parking lot and shut the car off. He reached in the back and pulled out a box and handed it to Cas. "Aww, you shouldn't have!" Dean rolled his eyes. Cas opened the box and stared at the contents for a minute before looking at Dean. "Call me old fashioned." He smiled. It was his home game football jersey. Cas took it out of the box and smiled. "You are so cheesy Winchester." Dean leaned back in his seat. After everything that happened to Cas, nothing about him changed. He was still Cas. "Cheesy, but effective." He smiled.
"Well, for our final project in tv production, we're doing a music video and I want to get the school involved and film it during school."
Gabriel gave Dean a thumbs up, to which Dean responded with a nod. Dean looked back at the Novaks. As he turned to walk out of the house, Zachariah yelled after Dean.
"I told you." The only response Dean got was a low moan. Dean kissed Cas' neck, then bit him lightly. Cas moaned a little louder, pushing his dick against Dean. "Dean...please..." He breathed into Dean's ear.
"Cas...so good... so..." Dean bit his lip and slowed his pace slightly. A few thrusts later and Dean was coming as well.
Dean looked at Cas again and squeezed his hand. Nothing. He leaned in and whispered in his ear. "I'll be right back. I love you, Castiel. I'm so sorry I got upset like that." He kissed Cas on the forehead and paused for a moment before heading toward the door. He turned around. "Charlie, if he so much as groans you come and find me. No excuses." Charlie gave Dean a thumbs up.
“Honestly? I don’t know. It’s like he just woke up one day and was himself again. That was about a year ago.”
“I put myself on the radar to give Benny and his family a chance. We met up there and we realized it was crawling with Betas. At first, we thought about going around, but Andrea is expecting their second pup. They had to go in to Lawrence for supplies and get out unnoticed. So I made myself a diversion. I knew they were looking for me anyway so it was pretty easy. Sorry about hiding in your place and dragging you in to it by the way.”
In the kitchen, Dean doesn't bother with lights. He plates up two slices of the sweet blueberry pie he'd bought earlier—he'd cut back on the baking recently—in the grey dark. He takes a bite of one and turns to the fridge to get the ice cream.
But as Cas nestles back against him, Dean thinks that maybe this is what they were waiting for. Maybe this is what comes next. And maybe that’s enough.
I try to shrug it off despite my eyes going wide. “Oh… that was nothing.” Out of the corner of my eye, I see Dean raise his eyebrows. I
With an aggressive shove, Cas snatches the leftover napkins from Dean and Dean finds himself pressed up against a side street to one of the shops. Cas lets his arms roam over Dean's chest before ending up around each of his shoulders. Dean pulls out of the kiss when Cas’ arms are around his waist, hoisting him almost on top of him.
Dean rubs his hands together, hair still standing up in the back, “Okay… Let’s wrap this up. I'm hungry.” He leans down to the phone, still in the centre of the table, “We’ll talk to you soon, at the latest it will be Monday.”
When we finally do get back to the bunker, just as promised, the five of us all have a Rice Krispy Treat in the kitchen. Jack, pointing out the special green and blue sprinkles he dumped on top; beaming from ear to ear the entire time.
When Dean zones back in, he finds himself leaning against Castiel on one of the bunker’s many seats in the library. It was subtle, not enough to raise too much of a commotion, but close enough to be able to feel the warmth of Cas’ body.
The little boy shrugs, "Yeah, but Moosey knows I love him even though I only see them at night night time." He holds up the moose stuffed animal to further prove his point.
At this Dean’s brow furrows. “Listen. I know you’re not the most comfortable with me and Cas, but I’m stuck with
“Yeah, well…” I turn to the bunker’s doors, a fond smile working its way to my face. “It was good to see the old girl again.”
Later that night I find myself sitting alone with Sam. The both of us sipping on a pot of decaffeinated coffee and each reading a book; mainly just enjoying each other's company.
Momentarily, I almost forget that I’m anaemic in the first place. The warmth of the boys embracing me was something I hadn’t had in over a year.
failing at that. “Long story short, my plane was supposed to depart at 12. I was of course there on time but it turned out the plane was not. It was delayed by-”
Picking Morgan up bridal style, he carries her into her own room. Despite being a skilled hunter, she was one of the deepest sleepers he knew. (Besides Dean of course.) He tucks her in the same way she had previously done for Jack. At least this way she wouldn't wake up with a toddler’s foot to the face at 3 am.
Grumbling the most colourful sentence I could come up with under my breath, I end up with my head in my hands. Just like Dean, I had an “irrational” fear of flying, and the fact that this was my first time going alone didn’t really help. I didn’t care what other people say, planes crash; they’re scary.
, and Castiel leans over him again, sucking at his throat and eliciting more shocked, eager sounds as he aligns his cock along the wet cleft of Dean’s ass.
Dean wants to sob. He might be sobbing, actually. He also wants to unbutton his damn shirt and climb out of these clothes, but he can't seem to uncup his hands from his crotch anymore. He realizes too late that's because he's already massaging the heel of one hand into his hard on. It feels too good to knock it off. "Fuck," he bites out. "Cas, you gotta go. I . . . have a thing I have to do."
He lets go and swats Dean's hand away too, pushing their bodies back together and thrusting messily, the head of his cock grazing the crease of Dean’s hip, sliding in next to his balls. Dean lets go and lets him, happy to lay back and take it, but then Cas's voice breaks from above him.
Anyway, there's always Cas and a kitchen and some kind of food and kissing. Despite the fact that it's his own subconscious at work, Dean blames all this solely on Cas.
When they stop for too long—too long being anywhere from thirty seconds to five minutes—it gets painful. If they stop for longer than that it gets really painful. Unless Dean conks out. Sometimes he lets himself, and sometimes Cas makes him, just to give his body a break from the endorphins. Dean's communicated most of how it seems to be working to Cas, not that the pattern's hard to pick up on, but what he doesn't tell him is that the good, warm, glowy feeling flares up every time he looks at or even thinks about Cas. And if that feeling isn't paid attention to, that's when pain kicks in. Dean's pretty sure somebody once did an experiment like this with dogs and drooling, or maybe it was rats and food. Sam would know.
The real mystery is that the outlets work perfectly well each time Castiel plugs in the small desk lamp that came from New York in his filing box of belongings. Working off that knowledge, he purchased a new phone charger, which made no difference. He even used precious battery life to call the service provider to inquire about design flaws and ask advice. The customer service representative advised him to call an electrician. He’s now systematically tested every outlet in the house, always with the same
"Nah, I'm good, Sam. Really," he says with a fake smile that turns into a frown the moment Sam hangs up.
Once there, he’s greeted by another helpful sign. This one is taped to a faux stone pillar at the end of a shelf row and reads CARD CATALOGUE with an arrow pointing down to a computer station below. Castiel frowns at it.
He does think he sees a way to compromise with Dean on furniture arrangement, though. After all, he doesn’t want to have to drag his furniture back into place every time he wants to watch television.
He rifles through the plastic bins of bathroom junk in the hall closet until he finds the razor and the right cord for it. He forgets to knock before going back into the bathroom, but Cas is dressed. At least, he took Dean up on the pants but left off the shirt. Or maybe he just didn't make it that far—he's still seated on the toilet, eyes closed for a two-minute nap. He opens them when he hears Dean and watches him plug in the razor.
He hears an annoyed sigh, but then Dean comes into focus with his hand around the refrigerator door. He yanks it open and digs a pack of bacon Castiel had forgotten about out of a drawer.
The Castiel of right now wraps his hand around Dean’s warm, firm cock and listens to him cuss, “Love it when you touch me, Cas. Fuck, yeah, just like that,” then has his mouth seized in another searing kiss.
He steals a look out the screen door as he passes and sees Meg hovering in the shadow to one side. She raises a hand in a careful wave but knows to stay silent. This is Sam’s show now.
"Not days," Cas answers, his eyes following Dean's hands as he cleans the blade one last time and drains the sink. "Without my grace intact it's difficult to sense. It would be the equivalent of healing a limb."
“I miss what it felt like to work together, part of a team. I think I could build that again, hopefully here. But my experience of family wasn’t what you— Well, what you’d call normal, I suppose.”
“Nice night,” says a voice from above him, and Castiel almost drops his beer. He opens his eyes to find Dean leaning against the railing to his left. He’s in the same henley and jeans but wearing his green shirt this time, sleeves rolled to the elbow.
And the thing is, he’s right. Castiel follows instructions and ends up with a sweet and salty sandwich that makes his mouth water for more.
wants it. He, him, himself. Not the curse. His mouth waters at just the thought. But the curse makes him crave release, not offer it. He can't stop right now, he can't concentrate long enough, so instead he says, "Fuck me, Cas. Please, fuck me. I'll make it good. I'll make it—" He clenches his teeth as the curse demands more, flaring through him. "It's the only way I can get you to— I want you to— I want you," he says out loud.
Cas slips off his barstool. "I think this," he motions to the bare chicken bones and assorted sandwich stuff "—cooking—makes you feel useful. Needed. But also in control," he flashes Dean one of those small, almost-ironic smiles, "which you like." Dean feels his pulse pick up as Cas makes his way around the counter. "It's another way for you to do what it is you always do, Dean: provide and protect."
Cas's eyes narrow. "What's wrong?" He puts a hand to Dean's chest again. Dean covers it with his own, makes Cas's thumb rub rough over his nipple. That hurts too but he can't have it any other way. "Your heartbeat is too fast. Tell me what's wrong, Dean," he orders, going full-on angel of the Lord.
"Yeah, yeah okay. We're headed to—" He blanks. In fact, he's not sure he knows. "Hey Sammy, where we headed?" he calls back over his shoulder, eyes never leaving Cas.
Cas sucks in air and writhes, hips bucking forward but immediately pushing back against Dean's touch. Dean moves his fingers slowly, drags them down then up, greasing the whole area. He finds the knot of muscle and strokes over it with just his middle finger. Cas groans long and low and pleased. Dean feels himself get a little harder too.
Pleasure crashes over him, and he moans, suddenly wanting more and more, for Cas never to stop, for this never to end. He whimpers because it has to, it
Dean comes in the sheets, in the grooves of Cas's hips. He comes with their cocks in his fist, in Cas's fist. He comes without being touched. He comes against the small dip of Cas's lower back. He comes when Cas tells him to, voice raspy and reassuring. He comes in the shower, barely still standing. He comes with Cas inside him. He comes inside Cas, once. He comes hard, sometimes slowly, sometimes a quick hot surprise. He doesn't count how many times he comes. He comes with Cas's name and cuss words falling from his mouth, with his lip between his teeth, with his face buried in Cas's neck. He comes on his knees. He comes between Cas's thighs.
Dean curls around him, tracing the curve of one bruised wing and dropping a kiss to Cas's shoulder before he settles in, snug against his back.
"Get your mind out of the gutter." Cas dusts his hands before planting them on the countertop and fixing a stare on Dean.
Dean sits up when he comes to. He rubs at his eyes and decides he feels, well, sticky, but also almost normal. Not that it'll last long.
Holding the rush of saliva under his tongue, he makes fast work of stripping off his boxers, then spreads Dean’s cheeks with his thumbs and deposits the spit there. Dean chokes out a surprised
Castiel isn’t sure what he expected. He’d guessed the ghost was male from the few husky chuckles and the late-night sports network watching, but whatever else he’d imagined was not this. Ghosts in the popular imagination are always in Victorian-era sleep shirts or uniforms from wars long over. They don’t dress like grunge rock rejects.
Dean kicks off in the direction he's facing, thinking maybe the trees thin out that way. He has to figure out where the fuck they are, find transportation, find Sam. But first he has a broken angel to put back together.
The realty website had said the house was partially furnished, but he hadn’t expected to find antiques. There’s a freestanding console cabinet with the futuristic lines of ’40s-era design in the opposite corner from the door that he suspects might be hiding a radio and maybe a turntable.
Two days later, Dean's exactly where he was two days before—on the couch, in a blanket, in the half dark. He's got a book in his lap that he can't quite focus on reading, but Cas fluttering into existence isn't what he'd call a welcome distraction.
Rows of buildings in a neat patchwork of brick line Massachusetts Street in particular, each with its own colorful awning. Some of the business names are the same—Starbucks, Borders, etc.—but local names outnumber the chains, and there isn’t a skyscraper in sight. As a result, the sun casts and chases shadows in a way it can’t in New York, and the sidewalk trees seem healthier for it, spring buds just on the verge of unfurling.
Every time he comes it's the best sex Dean has ever had and he hates that about it, hates that he has a curse to thank for that. But Cas just rolls his body with Dean's—patient and steady and willing—and makes him come again.
He settles on an arrangement just before noon. Repositioning the couch in the center of the room divides the space in two nicely. Situating his desk toward the front of the house leaves the floor space open in front of the bay window, while the back half of the room, just beyond the window and the staircase, becomes the lounge area. The radio console anchors the couch, functioning as a sofa table along its back, while the television now sits along the wall where the radio had been. It feels homier this way, less like a railcar.
"My leg," Dean gestures to the bloody denim above his right knee. "I can't run. Losing too much blood, hurts like a bitch. I wouldn't get far enough away. They'd get me anyway."
Cas shifts and pulls out of Dean—an awesome, awful pain; Dean rolls his lips and hates himself for savoring it. He settles on his side, facing Dean, his fingertips reaching to gently play over the crown of Dean's cock, readying for next time without Dean even having to ask. Dean winces. Cas thinks he's doing what he can to keep the needy pain away, Dean knows, but this time is different. This time—
She takes it and shakes weakly, still distracted, but when he tries to release her, she squeezes tight, not allowing him to let go.
Dizzy and hard and not at all sure he's not dreaming this, Dean grips the shoulders of that damnable trench coat, his body thrumming
"No one's coming back for an hour. It's cool. Just," he claps a hand to Cas's shoulder and the canister of shortening to his chest, "measure that. A cup and a third."
“I see.” He’d considered researching how to summon a reaper to give Dean a second try, but obviously he wouldn’t need to pursue that avenue if what Sam said was true. “Does that mean there’s nothing to be done?”
He puts up placating hands but Cas launches and there's not time to protest before his mouth covers Dean's.
So fuck the curse. Fuck the pain. Fuck it all. This need is fake, this want isn't real. None of it is his or any part of him. Dean has something he wants a hundred times more. Dean has Cas.
“I’m sorry, Dean.” That’s hardly enough, but it’s the only thing Castiel can think to say, so he weighs down the words with as much empathy as he can. He’d made a lot of guesses about Dean’s cause of death over the last few months and a car accident had been one of them, but the circumstances surrounding it—that Sam had been driving Dean’s baby, that Dean had just been injured trying to protect Sam. A random tragedy, Dean called it, and yes. That’s exactly what it was, and the injustice of that claws at Castiel.
as an infinite whole—Dean's success, Dean's protection, Dean's acceptance, Dean's forgiveness. This desire for touch is so strangely specific by comparison.
Angels don't dream, but Castiel dreams of Dean rushing back precious steps to slay the beast who threatened him. He dreams of shouting for Dean to go, to leave him. He dreams of Dean turning around too late, his blade unready. He dreams of watching Dean die, of being unable to stop his death.
Castiel scowls around his empty kitchen, but there’s no sign of a ghostly presence. He hesitates to move. It’s one thing to be generally aware you might be under surveillance; it’s another for the camera to talk to you.
"I know. Cas, hey," Dean tries to reach for his arm but only gets his fingers around a fold of trench coat. He tugs at it to get Cas's attention. "I get it. It's okay," he swallows, "I know it's different now, I do. I just . . ." he shakes his head. The words never come out, even when he wants them to. "Look, you can go if you want. All I get to do is sleep, apparently. No big party. You won't be missing out."
“We have a good thing going, I think. I mean, it’s not normal. Like, in a lot of ways. But I want it to be good, and”—Castiel wriggles his keys out of the lock and takes the mail from his mouth, managing to close the door with his foot—“that means I can’t be an asshole and make everything about me. So, I’m sorry.”
“Seen it happen before, you know. Years ago. Some teenagers thought it’d be fun—call me up, get me to say hi to dear, dead grandma, you know the deal. Didn’t go down like that, though. Those dark sonsabitches are like gum stuck to your shoe. Friggin’ impossible to get rid of. Big huge mess. Poor girl.”
—complex risk scenarios and pushy trading-desk jocks. His coworkers had several jokes about his stare and its unsettling effect. Ava fidgets under it too. She’s omitting something, but Castiel can’t find it in himself to be suspicious. He should be.
He waits for Meg’s outrage but instead she asks, dangerously calm, “What’s wrong with your electricity, Clarence?”
From the pocket opposite the matches, Castiel pulls out the slim plastic canister of salt they’d purchased with the flashlight and cracks open the seal. He dumps a circle of grains around the footlocker and then into it, over it, covering the contents in white until the canister is empty. And then he reaches for the matches.
Cas kisses the corner of Dean's jaw, nips at his lips, fingers still roaming. "Ninety-six. That was ninety-five."
Sam’s upright now, and he grabs a fistful of Castiel’s coat to hold him back. Dean roars one last time and doubles over. His whole body heaves with deep breaths, even though he doesn’t need any, and when he looks up his forehead is sweaty. But his eyes are green.
"You too," Dean adds as Benny adjusts his cap and turns away, whistling as he retreats through the trees. Dean sighs and looks down at Cas's sagging neck and shoulders. "We made it, Cas. Just you and me now. Home sweet home." He thinks about that for second, earth being at least a plane of existence away from Heaven. "Well, you know. Close enough, I guess."
Dean flicks a look at Cas and rolls his eyes. Cas smiles indulgently. Just for that, Dean kisses him once more before hefting his duffle off the bed and heading out of the room after Sam. Cas follows at his heels.
For the first time in the two weeks he’s been in his new home, Castiel feels like listening to music.
Cas kisses him this time, surging up and in, surrounding Dean, swallowing him. Dean didn't know how much he wanted this until he got it. He knew Cas
Cas just nods, so Dean goes for it, pressing the razor to his skin and guiding it over the scruff. He works slowly down his cheek, down around his jaw, up his neck. Cas's eyes are closed the whole time, but he tilts his head at Dean's direction, and Dean finds himself absently smoothing at Cas's face with his thumb as he works.  He brushes off the first side when he’s done and continues onto the other.
and continues to avoid the simple question. "C'mon, you're telling me you haven't peeked in to find out? Not even once?" He waggles his eyebrows. "I thought angels were always watching over me."
He flicks off the light, forgets the mess, and pulls Cas with him out the door and down the dark hall because if this is happening—and it is—it's happening someplace Dean can get Cas horizontal.
Dean starts to laugh into Cas's kiss. "Dude, we are so alone right now." Cas nods against Dean's mouth. Dean strokes his thumbs over Cas's hipbones. "So're you thinking what I'm thinking?" Cas growls something that can only be an affirmative and Dean kisses him more, picturing what it will be like to really get his hands on him, to strip him down and stretch him out on—
Dean crosses his arms in a defensive pout Castiel recognizes from his own teen years and shrugs a shoulder.
There's spare razors under the sink and a half used can of Barbasol in the mirror cabinet. He'd used them earlier himself.
"Yeah, hey, no problem. Don't  worry about me, I'm good. I'm— You guys just, uh, fix Dean. I'll check back?"
"Cas," Dean pants, "Cas, hey." Dean grabs a handful of Cas's hair and tugs, but in response the angel just sucks harder and Dean has to smack the table and think about changing the oil filter on the Impala to keep from coming. This cannot be over yet. He hasn't even gotten any of Cas's clothes off, and the situation is so damn typical—Cas does all the work, gets none of the reward. If Dean's coming, he's at least bringing Cas with him, damn it.
Dean does the math, decides no one's lying to him—there was no heart-to-heart with Sam about Lisa, about Dean moving out.
Castiel has no idea what to say next. The appropriate thing, were Dean a regular guest, would be to invite him to stay for coffee, or dinner. But those aren’t exactly feasible options in this situation. He defaults back to one of the questions on his list. “Why did you move my furniture?”
"It wasn't my own safety I was concerned with," Cas mutters, but Dean ignores him, pawing around the collar of Cas's coat. It's soaked.
, always Cas. So he has to say the important stuff. The stuff Cas should know before it's over. Before Dean locks it away again.
When he looks down, Dean is still standing there silent, forehead wrinkled. It’s the first time Dean’s appeared at all awkward in their week of acquaintance and Castiel’s anger relents a little.
Castiel remembers to breathe, and then to close his dropped jaw. The thud of his heart echoes in the tremble of his hands.
Dean thinks, just as Sam says it out loud. "No genies, no leprechauns or fairies or demigods. Nothing that casts spells. And we've been on the move—there's no way it's a hex bag, I checked our stuff and the Impala."
Dean shifts up onto his elbow and leans all the way over Cas to grab the tin of petroleum jelly from the floor where it got chucked last night. They'd gone fast and hard, desperate for proof of life and each other. It did the trick, and Dean would always take Cas however he could get him, but this morning he wants something to commit to memory.
“I— Yes,” he manages and wipes his sweaty palms on his thighs before stepping over the wrench to welcome the windows contractor.
“Yeah, everybody thinks it’s all Dickens. But a freaking lot of people have died since like eighteen-whatever. We can’t all be two hundred years old.” The ghost shrugs (shrugs!). “So you gonna put that away, or what?”  He nods at the ouija board. “Because leaving a line open is almost as dumb as calling everybody in to dinner time.”
I point into the hallway, “I'm gonna go back out and hang out with Uncle Sam.” Jokingly, I tap my watch, “Not just my bedtime yet.”
Cas shakes his head, if Dean wasn’t going to open his stubborn mouth and admit it, Cas would open his mouth for him. “I realize we’re out in the open like this Dean,” He finds the strength to finally say after a minute, “but may I kiss you again?
Cas pulls out of the kiss and leans back far enough to look Dean directly in the eye; his brows furrowed and head tilted in his signature look. “Babe?” He asks, hesitant.
Sam, still sitting, looks around at the four of us in disbelief, “Really?! We just agree on food and now everyone is alright?
Dean leans over and steals a lick. Wiping his mouth with a napkin he makes a face. "Is that...pineapple flavour? They make that?" He chuckles, taking another lick.
Still pressing him against the wall, Dean can see Cas’ cheeks flush down to his neck. Before Dean can even finish he is quickly shut up with a kiss. It’s meant to be soft, but Cas’ voice comes out hard and rough, “You never have to apologize to me for that Dean.”
In the heat of the moment, Dean didn’t remember what his response was. Probably something all grumpy like "No I'm not."
Catching the both of us off guard, around the corner we hear a quiet shuffle of footsteps. Immediately, Sam and I are on our feet, my knife unscathed from where I kept in my boot, and Sam with his hand resting over the gun in his waistband.
Dean can't stop smiling. "Alright, alright, I get it." He cuddles atop Cas, then pulls the blanket over them.
Dean can visibly see the words hitch in his brother’s throat. “It’s just the way you act all the time around each other…”
Now that Cas was human, he wanted to live his new life to the fullest. Most of all, he wanted Dean. Ever since he gave up his grace to be with his friends-- to be with Dean, he finally felt as if he could do anything he could put his mind to. But whenever he wanted to reach out, to caress every inch of Dean’s body that he had stitched together atom by atom from top to bottom… he felt... restrained.
In a wide arc Dean casually throws Cas the keys as he makes his way out. “You can pull her around to the front, but DON'T YOU DARE SCRATCH MY BABY." He points a threatening finger towards the direction that Cas had left. But the former angel hadn’t heard him. He was already out the gone; the thickness of the bunker’s metal doors clanging shut behind him.
It had been at least a couple of months since I had last seen them: Sam, Dean, Cas, even baby Jack. It had been even longer since I had seen anyone else: like Jody, Bobby, or even Claire for that matter.
Dean lets out a whole-hearted chuckle, “I was gonna say don't hesitate to call us if you need us, but yeah that too.”
“Dean…” Sam claps his brother on the shoulder, “Listen, I’m just happy that you’re finally happy. We’ve saved the world enough, Cas is the least you could have that begins to make up for that.” Sam’s hand slides off Dean’s shoulder and drags through his hair. “Hell, if I have to listen to bee facts and
“Look. I didn’t mention anything when all of Cas's belongings somehow ended up in your room.” Sam starts out, “I didn't mention anything when I would find his toothbrush sitting on the sink next to yours. I didn't mention all of your
Tapping my hand to my forehead I sigh at my slowness, “Right… I always forget that you can teleport.” I pause, processing what he’s saying.
Eventually, I end up back in the same section of the airport that I started. Pulling out my phone I check how long it’s been since I sent that text to Dean.
Dean thinks back to the first time he had actually kissed Cas; how blushy and defensive he was after they pulled apart. How Cas had just smiled at him and shook his head and said something like "You're blushing, dean."
When he finally speaks it comes out at about 4 octaves higher than normal. "That's fine Jack… Um,” He tries at clearing his throat, “your Dad and Papa are…" Sam turns to me with a silent "
Cas had learned a lot of new things after becoming human; the ability to read a room was not one of them. “That sounds like a great idea Sam. We are also low on coffee grounds so I assumed we would have needed to make a trip soon anyways.”
I hear a huff on the other end of the phone. The call had connected. Checking the time on my phone I wince, Yasmina was probably already asleep. Time zone differences are a bitch. “Hey, Yasmina!” I say in my brightest tone, placing my phone on speaker and set it in the middle of the table.
Dean grunts, fighting back the smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. "Shut up and gimme the blankets back"
However, within a blink of an eye, Sam’s back to normal, chipper and happy; pasting on the fakest smile Dean had ever seen from him as if nothing had happened. Sam claps his brother on the shoulder for a second time and tries to ignore his concerned looks he was giving him. “But when you go out
Still balancing Jack on my lap I reach across the table and playfully nudge him. “Speaking of that…” I pull out my phone from my back pocket. “I promised to call Yasmina as soon as I landed… guess that happened a little sooner than later.”
I can’t help it, you can never stay mad at Castiel for long. I smile and bring him into a hug. It takes me a second, but I realize that he’s not wearing his trademark trenchcoat. Instead, he’s in (what I guessed to be one of Dean’s) flannel, an old Led Zeppelin tee, and jeans with spilt knees with boots. It was good to see that he was taking in the “Winchester aesthetic” nicely.
Jack and I end up spitting a simple American burger. Since I was planning to eat on the plane and wasn't that hungry.
I laugh, bending my back in a wide arc while simultaneously clapping Sam on the shoulder, "Come on little monkey," I say towards Jack, "let's get you some warm milk and tucked back into bed."
Jack furiously nods, and tightens his grip on the stuffed animal; already taking his “official” job to heart.
In typical Winchester fashion, Sam throws up both of his hands in an (over) exasperated sigh. “Can you
Instead of returning his half of the blanket that Cas had stolen, he decides to splay over Dean’s body like a starfish instead. "Better?"
Dean slightly moves his collar to expose the blocker patches on either side of his neck. “Y'think I’m an idiot?”
“Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass, you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you out to the hospital, you ‘member that?”
The picture leaves very little to the imagination, but then, it's not like his imagination could've come up with
Dean can’t help the dumb sense of pride he feels at that. “Sorry, not sorry," he quips. Castiel levels him with a confused look, hands stilling in the process of taming his hair. “Y-you said, you look…” he flounders.
Traffic is what you’d expect at rush hour, but he doesn’t mind being behind the wheel. Besides working on cars, driving them is his favorite thing to do. It's like second nature, muscle memory taking over and leaving his mind free to reflect. He usually takes this time to go over mental to-do lists, like next steps in a business venture or what groceries he needs to pick up from the store. Tonight, however, his brain takes the unusual route of sending him on a trip down memory lane, pushing every choice he's made in the past ten years to the forefront.
“Hael used to say every person is just a walking mess waiting for a matching one to come along," Cas muses.
Dean growls when the elevator screeches at the obstruction, hands moving to hold Cas’s face until the doors physically force them to break the kiss. He catches a last glimpse of Castiel laughing into his hands, eyes sparkling with mirth.
One, he probably shouldn't have passed on a nightcap with the gang if he was gonna end up drinking at home anyway. Two, late-night TV sucks. And three, he can’t stop thinking about Cas.
“You made quite the impression on my cousin, but please, go easy on him. He hasn't dated in so long, there's no telling if things are still in working order in his pan—”
"Yeah, whatever…” he acquiesces, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Steak for me. I don’t do any of the hippy-dippy vegan crap you're into."
Cas talks him through setting up the livestream, but it won't stop buffering. Dean stands up, reaching for the internet cable and plugging it directly to his laptop. That's usually enough to boost the speed.
“Cas, I’m real." Dean leans back against the wall, his own panic swirling in the pit of his stomach.
His phone buzzes a few hours after he starts working on the car. He pulls out one glove, using it to wipe sweat off his brow as his free hand reaches into his pocket.
"I’ll work on it myself, so let the crew know," he says, feeling the sort of excitement to start a new project he hasn't had in years. Nowadays his job consists mostly of administrative pencil-pushing, and while he doesn't
“Nah, personal stuff to handle," he says, a hand leaving the wheel to palm ‘personal stuff’ through his pants - a parting gift from his little make out session with Cas.
Castiel scoffs, pulling away from his arms and tugging at his hand, urging him to follow him to the couch. He gives him a little push, which Dean gladly collapses under, then just stands there, watching him.
An elegant figure stands out like a sore thumb down at the garage, gracefully making their way past burly techs and disassembled vehicles. Dean cranes his neck to get a better view, something familiar in the way they move. He shoots to his feet when he catches a glimpse of profile.
“So are we gonna stare or make out?" Dean goads after a moment, mirth dancing between them. "Kinda gettin' some mixed signals here."
A whine drips from Cas's lips and he snaps, lifting him off his feet. Cas wraps his legs around him like he’s been doing it forever, like fitting so perfectly against Dean is in his DNA.
"Um. Thanks?" Dean says, exactly like the dipshit he is. Castiel scoffs. “So..." He nervously rubs the back of his head, a burning question in his mind. "Not to be nosy, but who did you think you were texting anyway?" he asks, trying to strike a casual tone. It fails, a detectable note of resentment in his voice.
Dean leans back in his chair, tension rolling off his shoulders. It's been a long, nasty bidding war for one of the nicest condos in Lower Manhattan. He managed to weed out most of the competition in a couple of weeks - all except for Judge Dickhead. He sent Billie in for the kill today, and a kill it was. People don't call her Ice Queen for nothing.
Castiel elbows his side at that, typing in a hefty tip for the driver before cancelling the trip. "I could use that ride now."
They’ve been texting nonstop since the whole nude incident a few weeks ago. In hindsight, it sure made for a great icebreaker. Dean's caught himself smiling at his phone like a damn fool more times than he can count, and while he won't admit it to another soul, his new favorite pastime is listening to Cas's voice recordings, from short
"God..." Castiel groans when their eyes meet across the room, burying his head back in his hands. "You’re still here."
Dean folds in on himself, mortified. “Crap, my blocker probably wore off. I got worked up back there and—”
“It’s like a sound, running through you,” Dean cuts in. “And right now, it feels like a damn symphony.” Castiel nods, stunned. “Back there, I felt high, like—”
“And who the hell are you?” 'Randy' barks out. He looks like your typical gym rat, and while exceptionally broad and tall, Dean beats him both in size and stature. If it comes to it, he can easily rearrange his stupid face.
"Cas, wait—” He instinctively reaches out, stopping just short of touching his knee - with how wildly uncomfortable Cas looks, it's better not to push it. Then, Dean's rambling, "You’re probably freaking out about last night, God knows I am too, but there’s something about this,
“Yeah, dunno why,” he says, holding out the pint of Ben&Jerry’s he got from the 7-Eleven a couple of blocks back. “Hope you like Pistachio.”
“The hell took you so long to call?” Dean asks as his brother's face freezes idiotically on the screen. “I’ve been on red alert for
“Ugh.” His forehead bumps against the cool surface of the bar. “He’s so damn beautiful, Vic. You’ve gotta see him.”
“Not this much. It got worse around the time I met Cas,” he explains, running a palm down his face. “I dunno, man. This whole thing is crazy. I thought you could help, 'cause you've always been into crazy.”
“I need to show you something," he says, an edge of urgency in his voice. Dean perks up - this is gonna be good. “Have you heard about the Rosetta spacecraft?”
He spins around to find Cas standing across the room in short, silk pajamas. The sight makes his blood rush to all kinds of places it shouldn't.
Dean's arm shoots out to hold the elevator door when it starts to close. “I’ll see you again, right?” he asks, breath caught in his throat.
As far as his knowledge on the subject goes, sterility exists on a spectrum, but broadly means not fully developing into your biotype. It’s rare and without a single cause, and while modern medicine debunked most misconceptions around the condition, a lot still isn't understood.
“Alright, we're done here,” Dean grouches, disabling the screen-sharing mode. Showing Cas embarrassing baby pictures of Sam backfired epically, his freckled 4-year-old self making quite a few guest appearances.
“I understand I'm at fault here, and I'll gladly pay for damages, but under no circumstance will I allow you to speak to me that way.”
Before his brain can catch up to what he's doing, Dean hunches down, nose brushing Cas’s temple. He’s so lost in the intoxicating electricity dancing between them he almost fails to notice two hands hovering his chest, ready to push him away.
" He throws a thumb over his shoulder. “Kansas Customs, right? I own the joint—saw you back there from my office.”
“What the f—you—” the man stutters, color draining from his face. “Y'know what, man? I'll just text you my Venmo.”
Dean's not kidding anybody - he’s freaking enamored. Besotted, even. Which is why calling Cas in the middle of the night after drinking through a six-pack is probably not a good idea. But hey, phone's in his hand already, and
,” Cas retorts, but it falls flat. Dean bites the insides of his cheeks - maybe he’s coming on too strong. “You look good, too,” Castiel humors him, a playful spark in his eyes. “And huge.”
As to his personal life, well. He has a small, tight circle of friends, and he doesn’t date much. Work, savings, investments, Sammy - that’s been his modus operandi for as long as he can remember. Now, at 30 years of age, he can’t help but wonder if this truly is all there is to his life.
“It's forgotten.” Castiel studies him for a moment. "But I still want to know. What did you mean by that?”
Cas gives a knowing shake of his head. “Noah—my brother. He enjoys using me as a guinea pig for random stuff he finds online," he explains. Relief washes over Dean, soothing his rattled nerves. Part of him can't help but feel stupid for jumping to conclusions. “Dean..." Cas starts, worrying his bottom lip. "You should probably know there's no one else."
Dean chuckles. "Mom brought us to the planetarium a couple of times when we were kids. Sammy used to love it."
“Hello, Dean. I’m Castiel.” The unusual name sounds fitting in ways he can’t explain. “Your eyes look fine to me. Are you in pain?”
“Dammit,” Dean grunts, parting their lips with a wet noise. “S'not fair, I can only hear you when you’re thinking
"I see..." Castiel says, sounding almost disappointed. Dean's keenly aware of his warmth radiating against his body, and whoa, when did they start standing this close in the first place?
Dean vividly remembers Mom marking him and Sam as kids as a warn off to strangers. Then there was the side of it he’d only learn about in his early teens. He'd always assumed the occasional whiffs of his father's scent he would catch on Mom came from innocent, prolonged contact. He'd later walk in on a scene no kid should have to witness and find out just how little innocence there was to it.
Castiel quirks a skeptical eyebrow, eyes shifting downward. Dean follows them to find his hands still all up his sweater dress, fingers digging into the supple flesh of his thighs like he
“Um.” Dean scratches the back of his neck, inadvertently licking his lips as he gives his delectable frame a brazen once-over.
Frowning, Castiel pinches the wrinkled bag at the corner, making an effortless tear across the top end. He blinks, stumped, then looks into the camera like he’s on The Office.
He scrolls down his contacts, finger hovering Victor's name as he ponders how much of a dick move dragging him out of bed this late would be. He ultimately hits call - being a pain in the ass is kind of what the whole best friend contract is about, anyway.
Castiel bows his head. “I have baggage, Dean," he says, voice barely above a whisper. "I like you, and it does feel right. But I just can't do this with haste."
“Great...” Dean mutters, signaling the bartender over. “Wouldn't be weirdest thing to happen tonight.”
," he says, eyes flicking back to the screen. "You're all Castiel talks about lately. It's sad, really."
, in the way they move around each other and the look on Cas's face at the impending goodbye - a look Dean knows he's mirroring.
Dean chuckles at the pavement, feeling the tips of his ears burn. "You uh, wanna grab lunch or somethin'?"
Riding in the car with Cas is... intense. Dean gives up on small talk about five minutes in, putting on some music instead. He doesn't miss the way Cas's lips move around the Zeppelin lyrics, head bobbing along.
“How come I never heard of this guy before?" she presses on, tailing him up the stairs. "I mean, how long have you even
“Oh, please. Spare me your rational lectures." She waves him off dismissively, starting toward the apartment. “He’s different, honey. You'll see."
An odd giddiness takes over his senses as he steers through a sea of luxury vehicles. He finds the right parking space after what seems like forever, pulling into it before he kills the engine. He just sits in the car for a while, trying to will away the weird feeling of imminence that has the hair on his arms standing up.
Castiel beams as he listens to the recording, and Dean implodes a little. He places two fingers between his lips and whistles, blue eyes snapping in his direction.
Dean hums, hand tracing the back of his neck, fingers carding through soft, raven hair. Cas leans into the caress, expression much like that of a happy drunk. Fondness blooms inside Dean, threatening to seep through his ribs and split his chest open. He just wants roll him up in bubble wrap and stick a ‘handle with care’ sign to his forehead, hell, even mark him with his scent to fend off any harm he may come across. It’s a preposterous thought, but true nonetheless.
Dean bites back a laugh. "Not much of a tech wiz, are ya?” He watches the image shake and flicker before refocusing on Cas's face, big blue eyes taking most of the screen. “Hey there. Lookin' good.”
“I’m officially out of good ideas,” Castiel confesses. That would make two of them. “Maybe we could just… do this?” he suggests, leaning in to brush their lips together.

Dean bolts out of his office and down the stairs, running into Benny at the bottom. “You see a guy down here just now?”
“You’re Alpha," Castiel says matter-of-factly. Dean opens his mouth, but nothing substantive comes out. “Pardon, would you like some ice cream?”
“Like you were in some sort of trance," Castiel completes. "Me too. That's why I hit that car. And then I saw you—”
"Yeah well, things change." Sam arches an eyebrow, unconvinced. There’s no way to ease into this, so he just dives right in. “I met this guy, and it turns out we can tap into each other's thoughts. It happens when we kiss, and—”
“Alright, calm down," Sam says, holding up a placating hand. "You said Castiel is sterile, right? So it’s not like he's actually going into heat."
He's working from home, meaning he's down to his underwear and one more espresso short of going nonverbal. But a call from Cas is a call from Cas, so he quickly throws on a shirt and hits accept.
Cas makes a little noise of protest, but pulls back anyway. His pupils are blown wide, lashes drooping low and lips obscenely kiss-swollen. Dean's eyes follow his pretty blush crawling all the way to his collarbone to find the strap of Cas's top slipped down his shoulder at some point, exposing a breast. It’s small and lovely, a pink nipple crowning the perky mound. His mouth waters, strained cock reflexively leaking in the confines of his jeans.
Cas laughs his classic crinkle eyed laugh as he pulls me in for my final hug before he would fly me back home. “You spoil him
Wrapping his hand around the back of Cas’ neck he kisses him until the taste of pineapple is gone; only replaced with the taste of Cas, which was
Meanwhile, Jack’s getting harder and harder to hold. He is bouncing up and down now, excited to talk to his “sissy Yasmi.”
Castiel quickly found out that Dean was most intimate and vulnerable in the shroud of darkness, though he had yet to figure out why. His first guess was that Dean found comfort in the dark, a sense of backwards safety; which was ironic considering their whole job was fighting creatures who lurked in the dark.
Dean thinks, mentally kicking himself. He gives Cas his own signature cocky smile, shrugging, “Yeah, it’s like a-- fuck-- like a pet name?
Sam is actually the one who scoops him up, laughing as he gathers the little boy in his arms, “Woah, slow down sport.
After about two seconds of deliberation, we finally decide to head to the Bigerson’s down the street from the bunker. Dean orders his usual bacon burger with steak fries, and much to his own disappointment, Cas orders a burger loaded with garlic and onions. (“There goes someone’s plans for later tonight,” I think to myself.)
I swallow down the salty taste of bile and continue. “Let’s just say it’s a good thing you’re an angel cause if not… I
A few hours later Dean wakes up first for the second time. "Mornin' Cas," He sleepily mumbles, pressing a kiss into the former angel's tousled hair.
Glancing down at the title of the book he laughs, "The adventures of Moose, Squirrel, and Giraffe by
It was a nickname for baby Jack after we quickly found out that his favourite position was climbing up the side of someone.
“I didn't mention your deep stares as you talked, literally about anything, like each of you could see into each other’s souls through your eyes.”
That sometimes happens when you move into a different time zone from the rest of your family for school.
I jokingly throw a hard glance over towards Cas, but we both knew I didn’t mean anything bad by it. Quickly, I dial Yasmina’s number and wait for her to pick up.
I readjust the guitar on my lap for a second time. The better part of my conscious tells me that I should send Jack back to bed, that it was already late as it is; but I can’t bring myself to do it. Being able to play for someone, and for them to enjoy it like this, it had been years since I had gotten that.
“Hey MJ...” She pauses for a yawn, “Are you already there? I thought you didn’t land for another 6 hours?”
“Just… if you could just give me a little reassurance?” It comes out as a question as I wince at my own voice. God, I sounded stupid. “I don’t know Cas, I’m just a little nervous about this whole… all of it, actually.”
They eventually ended up cuddling, even though Cas knew Dean thought that kind of stuff should only happen in chick flicks. Cas ended up curled on his side, Dean spooned protectively behind him; This was home.
Early the next morning, his back hurts a little from sleeping all cramped up, but with his ear to Cas's chest all night, listening to the soothing beat of his heart, Dean's never had a better night's sleep.
A shadow passes over Dean’s eyes and for a moment Cas thinks he has pushed too far, but a second later Dean’s face explodes-- metaphorically… literally exploding is not a pleasurable feeling speaking from experience-- the corners of his eyes crinkle and immediately Cas knows his heart is lost. “Oh Cas,” Dean smirks, eyes already on his lips, “you never have to ask me, you sap.”
They don’t do much, they don’t have to, but Dean and Cas just lay together hugging; holding each other. They toss and turn slightly, having not figured out their perfect sleeping position yet.
“So…” Sam tries to start some conversation as he makes another pot, turning to me, “I overheard you last night.”
By now, Sam's had enough of the three of us bickering. In one solid motion he stands from his chair and sweeps his hand, hitting all three of us on the back of our heads.
Upon realizing this, Dean bursts into a coughing fit and-- platonically-- makes do with a ruffle of Cas' hair before pushing him towards the door, "I’ll, uh, meet you in the car.”
I smile, the kid really knew how to warm a person’s stone-cold heart. “I love you, Jack. Sleep tight.” I pull up the covers to his face and gently kiss his forehead.
To show me his “beefy Daddy arms” Jack snatches my bag from my hands and hurries off towards the spare room. “Just don’t go through it, Jackie!” I call back to him with a smirk, “If you’re good enough this weekend you might get a surprise at the end!”
Despite his multiple protests, Cas doesn’t let his husband get pie after we all finish with our lunch. Saying that they had dessert at home that he and Jack had previously made.
In mock-salute I nod toward Sam, Dean and Jack; who had now taken back to his usual spot in his Daddy’s arms. Cas places his hand on my shoulder as I take one final look to the angel, “Alright Cassie… there’s no place like home.”
Despite having most of the day together, Dean is slightly disappointed when he finds Cas already asleep on one of the couches. He figures the least he could do was make the--
Sam only waves me aside, returning to his normal spot at the table. “No, it’s really good kid!" He pauses for a moment, "You should continue it-”
Cases had slowed to a lull, and for the first time in a while, Dean found himself in the library actually enjoying a read with his-- with Cas.
Dean nods at the cashier and pulls out his wallet, trading two dollars for the ice-cold soda. He pops off the cap, shoves it in his pocket, and chugs. After swallowing with a satisfying sound, Dean turns to see Cas holding an ice cream cone from a vendor a couple of stores down.
“Well…” I lean back down to Jack’s ear, making him giggle, "I’m sure your Daddy and Uncle Sam will absolutely
“Easy there tiger,” Dean smiles into the side of Cas’ neck, pressing a gentle kiss to the red spot that he had proudly made, “unfortunately, we
In a solid push, Cas shoves Dean off the side of the couch and rolls over in an attempt to get more sleep.
still in public… we have to keep it slightly PG-13 babe.” The last word falls out of his mouth before he can even correct himself.
“So…!” I say, trying to change the subject as soon as possible, “You guys wanna play a game or somethin’?” I turn my gaze towards Dean, wiggling my eyebrows, “I’ve been practising on my poker game.”
With a creak and slam, Dean climbs out of the Impala and slouches to lean against its door, surveying his new digs. All right, so it's not winning a prize from Martha Stewart anytime soon, but it's a roof over his head.
If he’d never seen photos of them side by side in their youth, Castiel wouldn’t have guessed this man to be Dean’s brother. But there are hints of Dean, even now, around his eyes and in the set of his jaw.
The motel room door closes behind Sam and Dean sends a pitiful look up at Cas. "You can whammy this away?" he asks, voice a dry scrape.
Lacking the focus to work on small, detailed projects, Castiel takes to clearing away big things, organizing what was left in the boxes, breaking down the boxes, slowly resigning himself to his fate.
It isn’t exactly necessary to keep it charged, or even on. He’s long since deleted work-related applications and avoids his email account. Why torture himself with stock tickers when he’s no longer required to check in on what the market’s doing? What use does he have for email, or phone service, when there’s no one from his old life willing to break Angelus ranks and contact him? But it’s the principle of the thing. He should be able to charge his cell phone in his house. He should be able to rely on his electrical outlets.
"I know," Dean nods, really, really distracted by the fact that Cas still has his hand in a really, really good spot. "I know, I know. It's just . . . they live here, and this is— I don't want—"
They’d called ahead, at least. Or, Meg had, since she’s more convincing when it comes to twisting the truth. She’d spoken with Sam and said she’s been researching the old Campbell place—not, strictly speaking, untrue—and would like to interview him about his memories of the place. When Sam made an excuse about not having time at the moment, Meg took it as an opportunity to make sure he wouldn’t be able to just hang up on a second phone call and invited herself and “a colleague” over. “We’d love to get a photo to include in the piece,” she’d cooed.
Cas just shakes his head more. "There is no bargain to be made, Dean. Whatever this illness—this affliction—is, it's preventing me from healing you. I can't take the pain away, I can't heal any wounds you sustain. Your body isn't repairing its damage the way it should. My grace is of no use."
Dean pushes in more with small circling motions and is surprised to find Cas doesn't clamp against the intrusion. It's like instead of fighting it, Cas's body is eager for Dean. He gets two fingers in before long, stripping them in and out, always pushing, nudging, circling.
The scissors clatter into the sink as Cas crushes Dean's hand until it opens. He snatches a bandage from the counter and slaps it over the oozing red slice on Dean's arm, then pushes Dean's own hand over the compress to hold it in place while he gets the tape. He's glaring.
Questions about Dean stream through Castiel’s brain like a news ticker across the bottom of a CNN broadcast. When did he die? How did he die? Did he die here, in the house? Is that why he stays? Or can he leave any time? What did he mean about protecting his property? What’s death like? Does everyone become a ghost? Surely not or the world would be overcrowded and with them and sightings wouldn’t be rare—right? So then what’s the afterlife? Dean appears to have the free will (can ghosts truly have free will?) to choose how and when to haunt, but Meg had told him about spirits or energies that are trapped repeating moments or behaviors. Why is Dean different?
After losing faith in everything he’d ever put his confidence in, convincing himself of a new belief seems out of reach. It’s hard enough to believe in himself, let alone ghosts. He shrugs. “Let’s say I’ve become something of a doubting Thomas.”
He takes over for Cas, trying to mimic his hand motion and concentrating hard on keeping it all together even as Cas falls apart beneath him—these are the only times Dean has ever seen him give up all control, let go until all those rigid rules he wraps himself in unravel. He brings Cas off, arching and gasping, and smiles as the white spill hits Cas's skin, spatters hot on Dean's hand. Cas comes open-mouthed but near silent and Dean feels it, feels his body clench and tense around him. He drops forward, crashing into Cas with a kiss.
Because if Cas is fine and hasn't been whammied by witches, Dean has to start facing the fact that Cas made out with him on purpose. And if that's the case, he really has no freaking clue what the next move is.
He explains to Cas how to apply shaving cream, monitoring from over his shoulder, then hands him the razor. It's a pretty crappy Bic one, but it'll get the job done. "Go with the grain," he advises. Cas looks perplexed, but leans in close to the mirror to give it a try. It goes okay for a few strokes, but then he hisses and a spot of red grows at the base of his cheek.
The toy army man sits on the countertop nearby, pointing his gun at the toaster. “Looks like you’re stuck with me, soldier.”
had been Ava’s word for the house’s electricity. Castiel had assumed that meant it would flicker occasionally, or the main breaker might flip off at random. And over the last few days those things have indeed happened, though it’s rare he turns on overhead lights or uses electronics other than the toaster oven. But he also finds that almost no outlet ever works twice, particularly for charging his phone.
suffer." He adds a dramatic hand motion there with his name, like its in lights on a cosmic billboard somewhere. "Unless it's just for some kind of sick joke," he amends. "In which case, I want to kill the bastard who did this myself. Maybe stab
"Cas, did you just offer to get me off?" He has to ask it with his eyes closed. He cracks one eyelid just enough to see Cas shrug.
He shoves that thought aside fast. He can't feel bad about that. No way he was leaving Cas in that place. He wouldn't just give up on Cas. He'd done that once before and it nearly killed him. It
“Ghost?” The figure crosses his arms at his chest and leans his weight back on one hip. Except he doesn’t really have weight, does he? “Yeah, that’s me. One hundred percent dead and haunting you.” He couples a cursory wave with a sardonic smile, all without uncrossing his arms. “Howdy.”
It’s all the invitation Dean needs. “So those Wall Street bigwigs that keep making the news—you worked for them?”
"Nineteen," comes Cas's voice from behind and beside him. Dean turns to see him propped against the headboard, legs outstretched.
He tips his head to get a look at Cas or, at least, the back of his head. He's still sleeping, dead to the world judging by the slow drag of his breaths. His hair's rucked up every which way, which isn't much different from usual, except Dean remembers last night and knows he had a hand in making it that way. Same as he knows Cas is naked as jaybird under that sheet. He smiles to himself and rolls onto his side, slipping close in along the long smooth length of Cas's bare spine, rising sun be damned.
“No.” Castiel looks down at his hands and stifles the memory of Dean’s cool fingers linked with his own. “No. He said he liked that I was fixing up the place.”
But her rebuttal is almost drowned out by a laugh. An honest-to-goodness belly laugh. Only without a belly—or, rather, a source. Castiel flinches as it reverberates around him.
They have a plan. It’s risky. Riskier than anything Castiel would have attempted on his own. But it also makes more sense than everything he’d read in the past two days, and Sam’s been thinking about it for over two decades. “I considered it back in the day,” he’d explained, “But, honestly, it got to the point I didn’t want to stick around whether Dean was there or not. So I just took off.”
He could choose to be pissed about the possibility of Cas planting ideas in his head, but instead he goes straight to the sexy side of things—Cas was apparently digging on Dean's fantasies.
Dean's brain feels sloppy, soupy even. His movements are numbly uncoordinated from the marathon of hormones. Too much dopamine. He's sorta drunk on it. He can't see straight, let alone think straight. He doesn't remember why that's a problem, or if it's a problem. It seems like a thing that should be a problem.
Because Cas shows up, helps Dean make food for Dean's not-girlfriend, and never gets any of what comes after—seeing the food fill plates and bellies, sitting around a table, sharing, talking, being part of something.
No luck in drawer number one, just a bunch of maps or some shit, Dean doesn't know. Feels like paper. But he comes up triumphant from drawer two, holding a jar of generic handcream in his fist like a trophy. This place is so definitely a bachelor hunting cabin, and thank fucking god.
"Can you get your head wet?" Dean asks, returning to his seat at the edge of the basin. "Take a dunk?" Castiel frowns at the filth that's replaced most of the suds in the water. He hears Dean chuckle. "It'll wash off again, don't worry. Come on," Dean coaxes, offering his hands for Castiel to lean into. He accepts the opportunity for Dean's touch.
"Boo, you whore," Cas says, sticking out his tongue, and for a second Dean regrets picking out 'Mean Girls' to watch last night.
Cas wipes away invisible tears, a mocking hand on his heart. Dean chuckles, moving on to the next song in his small repertoire.
"My little brother—he used to be into this weird, paranormal crap,” he explains, unpocketing his phone to shoot Sam a quick text. “I never took the stuff seriously, but now...”
,” he retorts, hand dropping to his side. Dean immediately misses the touch. “I have no idea what this is," Castiel confesses, voice barely above a whisper.
“Yeah, just a little dust...” He winces, pushing the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Sorry, didn’t mean to make a scene there.”
. For some stupid reason it cracks me up whenever I watch it, it's legit one of my favorite comfort videos. I just needed something silly for that scene and immediately thought of it 😂
Besides his day job at the museum, he writes a science column for the NYT and co-chairs the Institute for Strings, Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics at Columbia. He's half-Brazilian and speaks fluent Portuguese, Spanish, French and German. Learning new things about the guy feels like a never-ending easter egg hunt, every piece of information blowing his mind in unexpected ways.
Dean sees red. He grabs the asshole by his jacket and slams him so hard against his truck the shock alarm goes off.
He eventually gives up on sleep, reaching for his phone on the nightstand. No word from Sam yet. He actually hasn't heard from him in a couple of days, only now he knows better than to haul ass across the country just to find his brother passed out atop a pile of books, stinking of absolute death. After that first incident, they came up with a system - as long as Sam checks in with him every week, Dean stays out of his unnecessarily long hair.
Before you start this chapter, I recommend reading about the mechanism of scent-marking under the VNO topic on the
“Okay?” Dean asks, so low and rough he almost doesn't recognize his own voice. Castiel nods in the crook of his neck, completely boneless against him. “C'mon, lemme look at ya.”
Dean can’t help checking Castiel out from behind as they walk to the elevator. His baggy sweater fails to conceal wide hips flaring out from a deliciously small waist, skinny leather pants hugging a shapely pair of legs and an ass to beg for. He stands at a solid 5’11’’ – average height, but substantially shorter than Dean. Towering at 6’8’’ comes with a fair share of nuisances, but the thought of dipping down or lifting Castiel for a kiss makes all that fade into insignificance.
Castiel looks away, but it does nothing to hide the way his cheeks fill with color, a small smile playing on his lips.
“Speaking of heats...” She sits on the edge of his desk, a smirk tugging on her lips. “I’m taking that leave we talked about.”
Even Dean's most debauched sexual experiences pale in comparison to the absolutely maddening thrill of Castiel on his lap, grinding down ever so slightly as he ravishes his mouth. It’s like High School all over again, when having clothes on can't stop you from getting off.
Surprisingly, Dean manages to be productive despite his hangover. He checks on suppliers, reviews spreadsheets and sends out important emails. Burying himself in work proves pointless after a while though, thoughts helplessly returning to Castiel. He finally caves when noon rolls around, grabbing his phone and typing up a text. He reads it over several times before hitting send.
Blue eyes, barely-there smiles and a sagacious yet blunt demeanor chase Dean’s every thought as he lies awake in the dark.
“So that happened,” he says, starting to turn around, but a bite of pain in his eyes stops him short.
The living room is limned in a soft, mellow glow from the city lights outside the window, the air of intimacy it provides causing a flutter in the pit of his stomach.
Dean rolls up his sleeves and whips up a batch of Mom’s magical recipe, pouring it into a thermos before ordering a ride. He tips the driver extra for his trouble. It's about an hour later that he gets a new text from Cas.
Castiel blanches, mouth hanging open as Dean approaches. "Hey, Cas." His eyes sweep over him appreciatively. "Lookin' good.”
Cas nods, angling his head to expose his neck. Something about the gesture stirs something inside Dean as old as DNA. Instinct takes over. His lips trace a slow, careful line up Cas's throat, leaving wet kisses in their wake. He juts out his jaw when he finds his pulse point, flexing his tongue. Two jets of clear liquid stream out, and he uses his lips to coat as much skin in it as possible. Cas trembles against him, hand fisting in his hair as a string of whines get caught in his throat.
- The two songs the boys sing at the beginning of the chapter are Home by Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros and I Want To Know What Love Is by Foreigner.
“Alright, I'm nothing if not practical, so let's try this out." He walks over, crouching down to meet Cas at eye-level. “Think something, anything, and I'll try to catch it.”
“Not sure where to judge you here—stinking up public places with your horny musk or going to Olive Garden.”
Dean's not sure how long he stays pinned under Castiel's unimaginably vast gaze, but it feels like years. Decades, even. Despite his most basic instincts, he doesn't feel the need to hide here. He lets himself be seen - his fears, vulnerability, and the sinking feeling that if he lets whatever this is slip through his fingers now, he'll have a lifetime of regret.
Contrary to the epic cocktease that is Dean's subconscious, this is what most evenings are like between them now. It's like before Cas went away—which is A Thing Dean Does Not Ask About—only with less running commentary from Dean. It's  . . . weirdly good. Comfortable, even. And Dean pretty much thinks he could do this forever.
: demony demigod thing summoned from the depths to do your bidding, until it decides to eat your soul instead. It has nothing to do with the war in Heaven and it's not—as Dean guesses Sam had been hoping—connected to whatever's fucking with Dean.
Now that Cas isn't a flight risk, Dean lets go of his hand and moves around to take his trench coat, tossing it over the back of one of the chairs and prodding him toward the kitchen table. "All right," he rubs his palms together, "We got burgers to eat and a bunch of shit to unpack. You want a beer?" He takes out his key ring, pops the lid off a bottle, and holds it out.
He waits until night to talk to Cas, until everyone has gone to bed and Cas has slipped in under the covers next to him. He wants to get it all out before he falls asleep, in case he doesn't wake up again.
“This is the price we agreed on,” he states as he scratches out the check. He rips it from the book and holds it out to Ava. “I assume you have some paperwork for me to sign.”
. Cas drags his fingers up Dean's sides, lifting Dean's shirt as he goes, rucking it up just high enough to—
"Your—" Dean eyes go wide. "Oh." He drops heavily beside Cas. "How bad is it? Did one of 'em get your sword?"
“Yeah. Sam was pissed I left and pissed I wasn’t there when dad died, so when I got back I made a promise—never take off again. Stay put. See it through. And I did. I kept up my end.”
"I'll take that as a yes," Dean grunts, getting to his feet. "I saw an electric razor in the closet in the hall. You put pants on, I'll go get it."
Castiel pulls the string on the bare lightbulb that illuminates the basement and sure enough, over by the fuse box he finds two screwdrivers, his plumbing snake, a level, and several pencils. He sighs. Dean stops talking and grins.
Keys jangle as they hit the counter in the back room and Dean snaps from one kind of panic into another. He's still frozen where he stands, but evidently that switch from dopey desire to crazy-eyed dread is all it takes for Cas to get the message.
It doesn’t seem impossible. He spots a number of Asian restaurants worth trying and independent bookshops with Pride flags tucked in windows. Overall, Lawrence seems welcoming, manageable.
Cas peels up and blinks at him, hair destroyed, eyes blurry. Dean smiles. He could get used to waking up to that.
"So what's with the band-aids?" he asks, gesturing to the gauze taped over the spot on his stomach that's raw and throbbing. "You couldn't just—" he taps two fingers at his forehead, mimicking the gesture Cas has made dozens of times.
He’d never been the brave one. That was the joke about risk analysts, right? Always scared of the uncertainties. All prediction, no action. Just carefully plotted courses for other people to take. He’d borne the jibes of his brash, back-slapping coworkers, moved in their circles as more of an orbiting satellite than a star. But if he envied them anything it was their confidence. Observation of and appreciation for work well done had been its own reward, what he staked his sense of self on. He’d withstood the powerful tide of Wall Street because he was good at his job and knew its—and therefore
Dean wavers where he stands. He tries to concentrate on not falling forward and accidentally catching himself with his lips on Cas's mouth, but that only makes it more of a possibility. Cas is all wide eyes and parted lips and
” he exhales. “Oh, Dean. Oh, yes.” It floods through him, fast and intoxicating. He leans forward and lets his come drop hot on Dean’s abdomen as he captures Dean’s mouth with his own—it’s a plunging, sloppy kiss, with Dean’s fingers gripping tight in his hair, Cas’s cock pulsing hard in his fist between them. He sags against Dean’s chest when he’s spent.
"Okay, come on," he prompts, helping pull Cas to his feet. Cas wavers immediately. He grabs his head but  it's his knees that give out. "Whoa!" Dean catches him before he drops straight down.
“No!” Ava shakes her head. “No problem! I— Yes, I have paperwork for you,” she wrestles with her folders for a second then stops. “Um, maybe we could go outside to finish up?”
“I didn’t realize it until moving here, or even more recently than that, really. But now . . . this is good. I don’t know how it’s possible, exactly—how you’re possible,” he squints, slightly embarrassed, “But I’m glad you’re here.”
She hadn’t said everything she wanted to, Castiel senses, but he doesn’t push. It’s clear enough she’s happy to be free of the property, and he knows he has a lot of work ahead. Never mind gardening, he’d never (well, hardly ever) picked up a hammer, let alone refurbished a house. He’ll need all the luck he’s offered.
"I don't feel well," Cas informs him, half clutching one of Dean's arms, legs still tangled below him.
He tells himself it hadn’t been real. He attends both job interviews and gets an offer the very next day. He celebrates alone and tries not to feel disappointed by that. He shuts his eyes and shivers with memories of sensation he tells himself there’s no way he could have experienced.
Dean hears him hiss into the heat. When he turns back, Cas is reclined along the back of the bathtub, eyes closed and mouth slack in relief. The tub runs the length of one wall, but full of angel it looks small. Cas's knees stick up, but the rest of his pale, bare skin looks even whiter under the sheen of soapy water. Dean keeps his eyes from the dark patch of scruff he knows is there, barely hidden by bubbles, just because that's not what this is about. Sometimes a body's just a body.
"He's . . . " Sam stops, choosing his words carefully. "He's got an arousal problem. It's painful, apparently."
Dean leans against a nearby radiator. “So I tell this chick, ‘Yeah, no shit I’m dead.’ I mean, I’d noticed I was invisible, that was a pretty big hint . . .”
