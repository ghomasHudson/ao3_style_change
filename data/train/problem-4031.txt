Cas meant as much to him as Sam did. He was family. Dean thought about the way that the angel showed he cared, he noticed things. He'd died for them more than once. Hell, he'd told them outright and neither brother had the courage to say it back. He'd put up with Deans rages and hadn't left. His son was living in a different state, yet he still split his time to make sure the brothers were safe. Maybe it was time to notice every little thing about Cas too.
Hanging up the mic, Dean ran his hand down his face, he wasn't comfortable with Cas going up against Uriel, he'd only just recovered from the last fight in which he'd nearly lost his life. He knew that leaving Uriel to his own devices was not an option. If he had gone so far as to kill the Omegas and children, well, who knows what he could be capable of. So Dean had given Cas his blessing, knowing that Cas would face him no matter what he said, if he'd disagreed, Cas would go into the fight distracted. At least this way, he'd be focussed on Uriel.
All of them quickly scanned the menu’s and Dean spotted a sharing platter of ribs with corn on the cob, baked potatoes and coleslaw, he pointed it out to Cas who nodded. Whenever they went out to eat, it had become customary for Dean and Cas to “share” food to avoid drawing attention to the fact that Cas didn’t eat. Dean was more than happy to eat the whole thing himself, with Cas picking at it for show.
Dean sighed as he realised he would have to go and get him himself. He wasn't looking forward to seeing the angel, he wasn't sure how to act around him now, and he constantly worried about hurting him. Even in his worst rages, when he had thrown insult after insult at his best friend, he hadn't wanted to hurt him, not really. He hadn't realised the angel was capable of such complex emotions.
“I know, but it started out as creepy and went downhill from there. Let's just change the subject.” insisted Dean, an annoyed expression on his face. “C'mon, we got shit to do. Start packing up your crap, so we can get goin' while we're still young.” He began to clear away his bedroll.
The whole clan knew of his views, they called him weak because of it. His older brother Gabriel had felt the same then as he did now, he had also been mocked. Right up until the day he had left the clan. Castiel had only been a child then, too young to understand fully. But he understood now. He only stayed to try and make the Omegas and Betas lives a little better. So they knew that at least one Alpha wasn't an dick. He would take all the jeering and mockery so that he could offer them what little protection he could provide. He wished Gabriel had done the same, but he had abandoned them and run away instead.
“I nearly broke character when he started crying though. I hate it when he cries.” said Cas, looking heartbroken.
Sam rolled his eyes. “I guess you learned your lesson about bug repellent though. I doubt you'll forget again.” he said, twirling spaghetti around his fork.
Dean nodded in understanding. “You didn't think I'd ever even look at an Alpha? I never did before 'cause Dad always kept us movin' 'cause we attracted a lot of attention, and it wasn't safe. Met some real asshole Alphas, but I met some good ones too. Cas is one of the good ones. Not just as an Alpha, but like, as a person. Like I said to Sam, I can't live like I'm still in that place, Y'know? None of us should.” Charlie nodded and Dean hugged her closer to him.
“Okay, I’m not great with words, but I just wanted to say that.. I.. love you.” he said, his face flaring up in a fierce blush. If he kept blushing like this he’d have to invest in some ice packs to cool his burning face.
Cas knew what he was doing, like he’d been doing this his whole life, all several million years of it. Dean threw his head back and gasped and Cas’ tongue dipped into the slit before dropping down again and sucking hard.
They crept towards the building, stopping underneath a window. Only one of the panes was intact, it's glass was pitted and cracked with age. The other pane was gone and in it's place was a rough board wedged into place. Cas signalled for Dean to keep watch as he began to pry the board loose, they both cringed as the board suddenly shifted with a squeal and Cas lifted it free, laying it gently on the floor to one side of the window. He peered inside before turning to Dean and nodding and then climbing through the opening, Dean followed seconds later.
Cas finally looked up and into his eyes. “I'm afraid- No, I'm terrified that this is the end of our friendship. That it'll be to difficult to be around each other and either you'll ask me to leave, or I won't be able to take seeing you with someone else. Because you deserve someone to love you, Dean. Even if it's not me.” he said, breathing heavily, his eyes glossy.
Several tarps had been lashed to the surrounding trees creating a windbreak, and Benny had boosted Charlie into the lower branches to string several larger tarps over the entire camp. The fire was built up and the smoke funnelled up and out of the gap in the centre. Several bedrolls were laid out on one side and Amy had busied herself using a branch to sweep any small stones and rocks outside of their temporary dwelling.
“Okay, now that is fucking disgusting.” said Dean, looking appalled. “Wait a second.” he walked off leaving a visibly sickened Charlie, who looked like she might pass out any second.
“Nice, he makes it with a little honey. Heat tea is disgusting without it.” he said with a grimace and Charlie hummed in agreement. All of the Omegas had begun to drink the heat tea in preparation for their heats that were due any day.
Cas took off his shirt and kicked off his boots, leaving his t-shirt and jeans on, before sitting on the edge of Deans bed.
“Fuck sake, Bobby would fuckin' skin me alive if I left you all with nowhere to go, and Sam would help him salt and burn my body.” Dean suddenly blurted, sitting up angrily as if offended that they thought he would abandon them. “It's simple, we make a stop at the Roadhouse to pick up the strays, and head to Bobby's. He'll put us all up until we figure shit out.” Dean said decidedly, sitting back and crossing his arms, clearly considering the matter closed.
Dean laughed out loud “Shut up, you'll ruin my reputation. I thought it was kinda weird and dorky at first, but turns out, it's kinda nice having an Alpha wooing you properly. Bein' all respectful and shit.” he said with a shrug.
A few hours later he was in position, the sun had set a while ago and Castiel was waiting for the guards to relax into their duty. Timing was everything, if he moved too soon the guards would still be alert enough to notice him.
Also, I swear I wrote this before the latest episode aired, I finished this chapter almost a week ago and I'm part way through the next. Any similarities are pure coincidence, but still frickin spooky.
Cas sat back against a large fallen tree, his eyes closed and a smile on his face, he pulled his knees up and rested his arms on them, he looked utterly at peace.
“Yes, we grew up together. He's outgoing and sarcastic, considered much to opinionated for a Beta. After my brother, Gabriel, left the clan, he became another brother, of sorts. He looked out for me and my twin sister, Hannah.” said Cas, looking appraisingly at his food creation. “This needs some onion and tomato to be perfect, but I suppose this will do.” He took a huge bite and his eyes rolled back in ecstasy. “This makes me very happy.” he smiled.
They were rewarded with the sight of a slight framed young man with blonde hair huddled behind a boulder, his arms hugging his knees, leaning back against the canyon wall. He was asleep.
Cas took a seat and opened a beer for himself, he sat slouched with one arm draped over the back of the chair as he took a deep gulp of the cold brew. Dean and Sam began to eat with appreciative noises.
“Kind of sad our trip is almost over, but man, I’m looking forward to a decent shower and my own bed.” said Dean, loading the last of their things onto Cas’ truck.
“Not so funny now, is it?” laughed Dean as he rubbed the offending underwear all over Sam's face and hair.
“I guess it's good you have him to talk to. He's a good guy, from what I've seen and heard. I think if he didn't have to leave we'd be friends.” said Sam, with a smile.
“Only it didn't work out that way, Raphael and Uriel had more opposition than they anticipated. When you didn't come back from the canyon, instead of attacking Lucifer in vengeance like he was supposed to, Michael backed down and concentrated on defence only. He refused to send anyone else to die. He wanted Lucifer to come to him. I kept to the plan, I thought we had time. But no, Michael shut down and, well, that put a crimp in Rafe's plans, so he outright challenged Michaels leadership in front of the clan. Calling him a coward and a traitor to those that died in the canyon. He brought to light some of Michaels terrible behaviour behind the scenes.” Balthazar reached for the flask again, taking a swig before offering it to Cas who sighed and took another drink.
Cas took it from his outstretched hand and sipped it looking thoughtful. “It’s not too bad.” he said with a shrug.
Amy came running in, looking sheepish and relieved. “I'm so sorry. I put him down for a nap on the couch and went to wash his diapers. I thought he was asleep. I'm really sorry if he bothered you.” she said nervously.
Cas nodded. “All the more reason to make your home fit around you. It seems ridiculous that you should suffer for no reason.” he said, moving to place two fingers on Sam's temple and healing the cramped muscles in Sam's back.
Cas chuckled. “No. I'm fine. It only hurts when I move now.” he pointed to the flask on the table next to his bed. “Perhaps you should drink some water, or you'll feel awful in the morning.”
“Hey Cas.” said Sam, grinning as he saw Cas looking alarmed. “ Don't worry. This one can't hold his drink. Ellen literally drank him under the table.” he chuckled and then frowned as he noticed Dean in the chair.
Benny huffed a laugh “Y'know, Bobby was grumblin' about Ellen takin' over his kitchen an' orderin' him around in his own house. He shut up quick when she handed him a plate of food. Thought the old Alpha was gonna start cryin'. Now he's outside with a list she gave him of things she needs for the week. He threatened to fill my ass full of lead if I said a word. It's only 'cause I'm more scared of Ellen that I stopped laughin'.” he said, clearly amused.
Snagging a handful of flatbread and bowl of stew, Dean dodged Ellen as she snapped a cloth at him crossly and ducked into the radio room where Charlie was elbow deep in radio parts with a frown on her face, her tongue poking out as she concentrated on soldering something that looked complicated.
“Castiel! You have news, I hear. I'm surprised, I know you have worked yourself tirelessly on this task, but I didn't think it would be this quick. I see my faith in you was not displaced. This pleases me.” said Michael, his pleasure showing on his face for once.
Dean looked thoughtful. He sighed and ran his hand down his face. “Fine. But if he doesn't back off, I'm gonna punch him. Then when Jess kills me,
“Joking is one thing, Dean. But those were things I only told you in confidence. When I was with those other people, it was at low points in my life, when I felt alone. To hear you saying those things, like that.. it hurts.” Cas said, he looked to be on the verge of tears as he pulled away from Dean.
“Okay, I get it. I'm allowed to have a breakdown. I'll make a note in my diary, maybe pencil one in once a week.” said Dean, jokingly.
Cas huffed an embarrassed laugh. “You're not so bad yourself. I'd go so far as to say that was the best kiss I've ever had.” he said with a twinkle in his eye.
“Relax, Dean. If you relax it doesn’t hurt.” Cas murmured. Dean did his best to relax as Cas began pushing in, to his surprise it didn’t hurt, there was a bit of a burn, but no worse than when Cas had first started fingering him open.
“I was taken off guard by that because A, I've never felt like that about another man. And B, you are my best friend and I felt like I was betraying you by feeling like that.” He risked a look at Cas who looked dumbfounded.
Dean dutifully made his checks every fifteen minutes, making sure to carefully write down everything in the notes. There was no change for several hours and it began to get light outside.
Cas sighed. “He's sleeping, but only for a couple of hours. Then he will come and eat dinner with us and then we will talk.” he rumbled out, reaching for the coffee next to Sam.
Dean felt the awkwardness seep back in and he flushed a little. Cas looked just as awkward and uncomfortable.
Dean was confused. Who the hell was that whispering about helping him? He didn't recognise the voice, then again, Alistair's guards were not known for whispering. Or talking for that matter, they mostly communicated with a series of grunts in the presence of the Omegas.
Dean could feel himself getting hard, his dick pressing against Cas ass as the angel pushed back, giving him a little friction to work with. Dean broke the kiss, moving to the soft skin of Cas’ neck, just behind his jaw. Cas’ breath hitched as Dean nipped it and his hips twitched automatically, pushing forward and revealing that he too, was hard as he pressed his cock against Deans stomach.
Dean felt a rush of affection for the Alpha. He was willing to do whatever it took for things to work for the both of them. He figured he should probably do the same.
Pulling to a stop, Cas sat open mouthed as the children swarmed the truck, giggling and climbing over each other to say hello to the new arrivals, their little hands banging on the windows and the body of the truck. There were at least a dozen of them.
They'll have a proper conversation in a later chapter. For reasons (I do actually have a plan, pinky swear!).
Sam took his hands out of his pockets and turned as Jess suddenly yelled from the porch of Bobby's house on the other side of the yard, he couldn't make out what she was saying but she seemed excited. Bobby stopped his quiet mutterings and looked up, Jess was running across the yard towards them squealing almost incoherently.
Cas shook his head, “No, he told me he felt bad that I was left out of the festivities. So he came to keep me company. He fell asleep a little while ago.” he whispered to Sam, who rolled his eyes.
Daddy came through the door to the kitchen, he had a glass of wine in his hand and smile on his face.
Jack couldn't sleep, he sat up in his big boy bed and toyed with his stuffed bee, aptly named Bee-bee, running the springy antennae through his chubby fingers as he resisted the urge to call for his Daddy and Papa again.
Ellen appeared first, looking just as exhausted as Amy had. She nodded a greeting and then hurried out to wash her hands, which were bloody to the elbows. Jess followed, her apron and arms were bloody, but she had a smile on her face.
Bobby nodded slowly. “Maybe make some copies too, just to be on the safe side. Like you said, it ain't just your clan at risk. Anythin' goes wrong on your end, we all end up in the crapper.” he said, solemnly
Dean couldn't help it, he smiled. “You've come a long way, buddy. Me and Sam wouldn't know what to do without you now.” he said, scratching idly at his neck.
“Where are you, Dean? We're gonna come get you, me and Bobby. We've been looking for you for months!” Sam was openly crying now. Jess and Bobby were standing either side of him, Jess stroking his hair and Bobby with a hand on his shoulder.
Cas murmured gently in his sons ear and kissed his head gently. He looked over and met his husbands eyes with a look of pure guilt and shame.
Between them they eased Cas out of his jacket, trying not to disturb the blade before they could pull it out safely. Amy joined them after leaving Matthew with Charlie who was watching over a still groggy Jo. Cas was pliant, the strength had gone out of him now that the adrenaline from the fight had waned. Gently they laid him down on his side and Amy gasped at the sight of his blood soaked shirt and the knife handle sticking out from the bottom of his ribs, the handle pointing down towards his hip, which meant the blade was in his chest cavity.
“Why...why were they drinking?” asked Cas, frowning and looking over at the hungover Omegas worriedly.
Bobby sighed but nodded in agreement, patting John on the shoulder he said “You can't keep running forever John. Those boys want families and a home. They will never get that on the road. I kinda get why you don't want them to stay at mine, although it's unwarranted, I'd die to keep 'em safe, you know that, but you should find somewhere. Just think about it.”
“Dean, did you think I would forget? That just because you've avoided me all day that I wouldn't find you?” said Sam angrily, coming to a stop and crossing his arms a few feet away from where Dean was standing.
Dean shook his head. “No- No. I meant, don't apologise. You were tryin' to be kind. Like you always do. An' I shit all over it, like I always do. You didn't do anything but rightly call me out on it.” he said, his voice hitching.
“I also want a list of the un-mated Omegas in the clan. It almost goes without saying that they are what the rogue clan is really after. With winter almost upon us, they will be gunning for our food stocks and medical supplies. But they really want the Omegas. They cannot be allowed to take what is ours.” With that he abruptly stalked away to talk quietly to another Alpha, Raphael, who had been standing off to one side throughout the entire speech.
“Relax, man. It's fine. I need that radio to call Bobby. I need to find out if my brother is ok.” said Dean, who was trying to seem as he wasn't spooked by the truck almost going off road and into a ditch, but not doing a very good job of it.
I'm pleased that some readers are happy that I wrote Charlie into the story, I kind of love her a lot. I still feel robbed that she was taken from us *sob*. I also have a huge soft spot for Garth, the idgit really does kind of grow on you.
Half of the table was covered in initials by the time they were done and Dean’s hand was starting to cramp a little from how he held the knife, but it felt right. This was how the table was supposed to be: This was their family.
Too deep in Cas’ mind for Jack to reach, they started back to where Dean had come in. In doing so, they passed by memory after memory: telling Eileen about his deal, movie night, his time as a human when all of the angels fell, the innumerable times that Naomi had stuck her drill in his head…
His family, immortalized in the wood of the table. His fingers traced his mother’s initials absently in thought. Family didn’t end in blood, and the Bunker had been a home to far more than just the Winchesters. They deserved to have their legacy remembered, too.
Castiel leaned back in their bed, looking up at the ceiling as though it had never occurred to him to ask himself that.
this time. All I had…” Dean let out a bitter laugh. “All I had was your bloody handprint on my jacket and a couple creased photographs. It was like you had never existed.” Dean lost his voice for a second, caught in the memory of what came after.
The Winchesters settled in their respective spaces—Dean in the kitchen and Sam in the library. The stash of alcohol in the kitchen was gone. Had he really drunk it all already? Dean sighed and took a beer from the fridge instead while he made dinner. He managed to find some solace in it, as he always did. It was nice to cook and bake, to wear a silly apron and ask people to “try this!” After years of living on the road and killing monsters, Dean was able to flip the script. He was able to use his hands, hands that had become accustomed to being covered in blood and gore and dirt, to do good in another way. He didn’t need to be violent anymore; he could care for his family, or what was left of it.
“That he did,” other Dean said, walking by with bags in his hands on his way to the kitchen. “And he bought seven dollars worth of nougat.”
“I miss you, Cas. We all miss you. Please can you... Please wake up, man. I don’t know what to do without you.”
“If Cas was human, he wouldn’t go to the Empty when he died. It wouldn’t have a claim on him because he wouldn’t belong there anymore.”
[Softer moment, let's talk about the Empty. World build a little. Maybe the silhouettes Dean saw come to life. Maybe that's what happens when you're dead there. There's no mythos to follow, so go wild.]
“I saw your face when the abomination was killed,” the woman in blue retorted. “You had doubt. You wavered in your faith and wanted to protect the nephil.”
“The Empty is made for angels and demons. It wants to keep them especially; it’s not going to let them go. Trying to take one out is probably just going to kill everyone involved.”
“Sam.” He looked up to his brother and discretely nodded towards Cas. He saw comprehension flit across his face before nodding to the dog still in his lap. “Wanna help me get her out of here?”
Come morning, Dean awoke alone on the couch, though the blanket covered him nicely. What had happened? Did he scare Cas off? Worse than that, did he leave again, like he always did?
Was this how Cas had felt, all those years ago when he brought Sam back? He had rescued him, certainly, but not his soul. Dean was starting to wonder, more and more, if maybe he had left something crucial in the Empty as well. Maybe he had been too hard on him, too harsh over the years—no, he definitely had. Castiel’s heart was always in the right place; he always tried to do the right thing. It wasn’t his fault that it always came around to bite him in the ass.
“He was at peace with his choice, Dean.” Jack’s gaze shifted to Castiel, seemingly still at peace. “He just thought he would have more time.”
“I could hear everything... the screams. The bastards were torturing them. They wanted to know where you were, Castiel. They knew we were coming and that you were our leader.” Alfie sobbed out.
Cas relaxed marginally but refused to let go of Dean, but nodded at Jess, giving her permission to approach.
Sam reeled as if he had been slapped. “Given the fucking choice, Dean will always choose to put himself last, Cas. We can't let him! I won't let him!” he hissed angrily, his hair flying wildly around his face as he shook with anger.
“She took a kick to the head, she's awake now. But she has a pretty bad concussion. She's seein' double, blowin' chunks, the works.” said Charlie, who was looking pretty green herself.
“I guess you're right. I was just worried that you're not really dealing, that you're forcing yourself to be okay. I don't want you or Cas to get hurt. Anyone can see that you two really like each other, the fucking heart-eyes are sickening, dude.” she said, snuggling into Dean's side and wrapping her arms around his middle.
“Dean looked up and grinned. “Yeah, I’m okay.” he said, sounding surprised. He ran his thumb over the sensitive underside and up over the head, marvelling at how Cas’ eyes fluttered and his mouth dropped open. He suddenly felt powerful.
Twenty minutes later he was in the clan house studying the only topographical map they had. It didn't cover the entire area he wanted, but enough of it for his purposes. It was far more accurate though and showed a lot more detail. He marked the settlements on the map and realised they had something in common.
I had a super productive week in which I got THREE chapters written. So for once I'm actually ahead of schedule.
“We missed you too, Dean. I swear, we tried to find you. We didn't give up. I promise.” Sam choked out.
Bobby looked impressed. “Well then, you're hired. Congratulations.” he said dryly, making everyone chuckle.
Bobby finished stacking the firewood and looked up at the sky, the sun well on it's way to setting, a glorious sunset just beginning. He walked to the other side of his house towards the animal pens, it would probably be a good idea to start putting them inside the small barn for the night. The cold weather would be here soon and the winters could be harsh in this part of the country. He petted one of the nanny goats who playfully butted his hip as he leaned up against the enclosure, scratching her under the chin as she bobbed her head with pleasure. He smiled into his beard and murmured praise at her antics.
“Oh, I’m not gonna last!” Dean warned. “It’s too good.” he said, his stomach tensing, trying to hold off from coming in Cas mouth.
The Alpha medic was a pleasant girl named Jessica, who had studied her entire life to be of use to her clan, her skills, though rudimentary compared to pre-collapse medics, were light years ahead of most other people. Sams health had flourished under her care. Her rare designation was an asset when dealing with Sam's stubbornness, she stood firm during his frustrated rants and her sunny personality refused to let him wallow in his grief for long.
Bobby sat at the kitchen table, carefully putting his favourite rifle back together. He'd managed to bring down two large Deer yesterday morning, more than enough meat for a little while. It had taken him the rest of the day to get back and strip and preserve it. So he'd left cleaning his gun until today.
When he came to, he was propped up next to Charlie and his right arm was splinted and strapped to his chest. It throbbed with dull agony. He could detect the sour taste of vomit in his mouth and he groaned as he sat up slowly. Charlie was on him in seconds.
Cas raised an eyebrow. “Yes, I can see how romance is at the very core of your being.” he dead panned.
“Dean, please wake up. You're safe, I promise” soothed Cas as Dean sobbed in his sleep, the scent was overpowering and Cas gagged again. “Dean, please.” begged Cas, half leaning on Dean as he reached up and ran his hand through the Omegas hair.
Deans smile grew even wider and his eyes shone with pride “Yeah, they are. C'mon, lets go reassure the others of a warm welcome.”
Dean looked shocked. “Oh.” he exclaimed. He thought back to the grief and guilt he'd felt over leaving Cas in purgatory. From an outside perspective he guessed it would have looked like that. Maybe it was that and he'd been so wrapped up in the guilt he hadn't noticed.
“Okay, but my legs feel like rubber still, so just give me a minute.” Dean agreed, then yelped as Cas picked him up, carrying him to the lake.
Dean shook his head. “Nah, Bobby taught me that one. My baby is an old lady now, I keep her runnin’ alright, but older cars like this need a little more TLC than newer cars. I’m gonna cover her with a tarp, protect her paintwork from the tree sap and bird shit.” Dean said, climbing out and shaking himself out, stretching his back and legs, cramped after such a long drive.
Mary shrugged. “Not sure, I can ask at the desk. The guy seemed helpful when I booked a couple of rooms for you boys.” she said, staring at Castiel who blushed self consciously.
“So, are you feeling up to doing anything today? I've done most of the chores, I promised Bobby I'd go through some of the salvage on the west side of the yard. He got some pre-collapse stuff in a trade a few weeks ago and hasn't gone through it yet. I can do that today, unless you still need me? I can do it tomorrow instead?” said Dean as he ripped off a piece of flat bread and stuffed it in his mouth.
Sam had discovered the full extent of Bobby's plans included turning the Singer homestead into a full sized settlement. Garth and Jess already had plans for cabins on the property. During Sam's recovery, Bobby, Garth and Jess had sat up into the night discussing the forming of a clan and a militia to protect it whilst Sam slept. The settlement that Sam and Dean had been born in had been nearby, but when the rogue clan had attacked, the residents had scattered. Bobby had been the only one to stay, as a widowed Alpha he didn't need to fear a raid.
Jack fell asleep just like his father, heavily and suddenly. Just like Cas, he could sleep through anything once he was out. Dean had always been envious of that particular skill.
“He's an Alpha, we tend to heal faster. But yes, it is a little fast. It's the poppy syrup, it can make him vomit. If he's lying down flat, he could choke. If we prop him up correctly, it shouldn't hurt much more than it already does.” said Jess, reassuringly.
“Well, thank you. But you can thank my Dad for it, he drummed it into us from the time we were old enough to drive. Which for me, was aged twelve. I could only just reach the pedals with the seat pulled all the way forward, but I could still take care of my baby.” he said patting her dash affectionately. “I’m gonna have to hike out here every day to start her up, I don’t want her battery goin’ flat and stranding us out here.”
Mary nodded. Taking out her phone and shooting off a text to Sam before she stepped out. She smiled to herself. Dean was his own worst enemy, he would need all the help he could get to make it work. Thank goodness Cas literally had the patience of an angel.
“Yeah okay. I think it's time for bed for my white knight. You alright if I call the others back in?” he checked with Cas, who nodded gritting his teeth.
Dean lined up the cans along the nearby fence and grinned. “We can’t do any real target practice, firing a gun along a public highway has a tendency to bring unwanted attention. But, we can play with rocks.” he said with a grin. “As I’m playin’ against a couple of celestials I’m gonna give you guys a handicap. You guys are gonna play blindfolded.”
Ten minutes later Jess and Sam were curled up on one of the bedrolls, Jess was already asleep and Sam was dozing. Amy had flopped down next to her son and had passed out. Charlie was whispering quietly to Jo. Benny and Bobby were sitting near the fire drinking Bobby's beer, and Dean was getting his first lesson on patient care.
Sam only just stopped himself laughing out loud. “I can bookmark some stuff, if you like?” he offered.
“Hey! I'm injured. If this is you fussing over me, I may have a few more objections.” whined the Alpha playfully, rubbing his shoulder.
Dean stepped forward and took the mic from Bobby, who nodded and patted him on the shoulder as he stood, giving Dean the chair.
Bobby heard a click of a gun cocking behind him and cautiously looked behind himself to see a tiny red haired Omega holding a gun pointed at his back. A gun he recognised.
Several days had passed since Benny had talked to Castiel. The Alpha had been quiet and withdrawn since, not even smiling when Jess had happily declared that he was now free to wander the house as long as he was careful and didn't overdo things. Cas had never really been talkative, but the change was so obvious, the rest of the occupants of the house were on edge.
This chapter gave me a little emotional whiplash. I can't wait to get the next chapters out, because you are going to LOVE what is coming up. When I finally get to Castiel's backstory (already planned out), there are going to be some major surprises. *ominous music*
“Fuck.” Dean muttered. “I can’t get what you were talking about earlier out of my head.” he admitted, leaning back as Cas kissed his neck.
“Whooo-hooo!” Dean crowed, throwing his hands up in victory. “Still got it.” he said smugly, throwing up finger guns and winking at Cas as he clicked his tongue.
“Ugh, like hammered crap. You know how it is, tired, sweaty, and itchy. I dunno why some Alphas still think Omegas are like sex crazed ninja zombies when we're in heat. I just want to nap in a cold bath for the entire week. The last thing I feel like doing is chasing and pinning some 'poor defenceless Alpha'. I mean, yeah, it'd be nice to have someone, but they'd have to do all the work. I feel too lazy to do much of anything when I'm in heat.” said Sam tiredly, slumping into his chair and reaching for his tea.
Jack nodded. “Yeah.” he whined as he began to sob. Daddy and Santa shared a soft look over Jacks head as Jack pressed his face into his Daddy's neck and gripped tightly to his robe. He immediately felt better.
“That's a familiar sight where I'm from on the coast. Huge cities underwater. Hundreds of years of hurricanes and no-one left to care, they just got swallowed up by the ocean. I used to sail my boat around the buildin's tryin' to picture what the city looked like before. Me and my buddy used to explore the more stable towers. Never found anythin' other than concrete an' bird shit though.” drawled the big Alpha staring wistfully at the flooded city and Dean huffed a sad laugh.
needs to decide what he wants to do next. He has had enough of his autonomy taken away just recently, don't you think? I will not participate in any decision about Deans future or well-being without his input. Not again. We need to take our cues from him on how to deal with this. It may be that he simply wants a break, he may feel the need for getting away from here for a while or even stopping hunting altogether. But the decision will be his, Sam. Not ours.” Cas said, his voice hard.
Sam carefully checked the rest of the room, making sure none of their belongings were left behind. Hidden weapons checked and packed carefully or distributed about their person. Mental checklists ticked off. It wasn't likely they would be back any time soon, if ever. They worked like a well oiled machine in almost everything they did, even the mundane things like packing.
Dean gave Sam a long look. “No, Sam. Cas and Jack need to experience real camping. But, we ain't sleepin' on the ground. Not if we wanna function.” he stipulated.
It was slow and sweet and just the right side of dirty. Deans stomach curled with warmth as he realised the truck smelled of arousal from both of them, even though their hands stayed decidedly above the waist.
Stepping through the door, Cas spotted Dean straight away. He sat at the bottom of the stairs hugging his knees looking miserable. Everyone else was conspicuous in their absence.
Charlie looked guilty for a moment as she realised she hadn't considered that Ellen was still grieving the loss of her mate. “Shit, that's gotta be awful for her. I feel kinda bad for being a bitch about it.” she said, adjusting her collar as if it was too tight.
“Dean, I was upset because even though I knew you might never love me back, I just didn't realise that you would be so disgusted by the idea.” Cas burst out. “Let me go. Please.” he begged, trying to push past Dean and get to the cab of his truck.
Deans mouth dropped open. “Oh. Wow. I..uh ...I don't know what to say.” he stammered, reeling from the shock.
Cas rolled his eyes and pulled himself out of the recliner. “I’ve got this.” he said, taking Jack by the arm and guiding him into Sam’s room.
He moved slowly, watching the guard post at the gate, the two guards had a small fire pit burning, protection against the cold night. They stood on opposite sides, illuminated by the flames and warming their hands and chatting. Perfect.
Cas tugged the beard down under his chin and gave Dean his best smoulder. “Once Jack is asleep, I think I can arrange that.” he said huskily.
“What was left had been got at by animals and there wasn't even enough left to bury or identify. There were so many different scents, from them, the bandits and the animals, I couldn't even pick one out, let alone identify hers. But I found the bracelet I made her.” his eyes looked hard and cold.
“Alright then, you feel like helpin' me get to the truck? I need to call the cavalry. They'll have to come get us anyway. Me and Jo ain't up for driving anytime soon.” said Dean, getting up on wobbly legs.
He headed to the kitchen where he knew Sam would want to discuss the whole thing. Although he loved Sam, considered the man a brother to him, he could be exhausting, even to an angel. He would worry every point to death and blame himself. He would insist on having a plan to help Dean before the man even woke up. Cas had no intention of deciding for Dean, there had been enough people making Deans decisions, it was time the man decided for himself. With that in mind, he walked a little faster to the kitchen in order to interrupt Sam's brooding.
“Thank you, now can I get some help getting this stuff to the camp? I also need an update on my patients condition.” Jess had clearly fallen into her medic persona and was now shoving crates into Benny's arms as everyone else scrambled to help.
“Hey Cas, You need some water?” said Dean, gently. At Castiels nod, he reached for the small flask and held it to the sleepy Alphas lips as he drank greedily.
“Yeah, Sam’ll teach Jack, and I’ll teach you. You can borrow a pair of my shorts.” Dean offered, rolling with it.
“Yeah, grab some painkillers, we're low on ibuprofen and aspirin. Oh, and I need toothpaste and deodorant.” Dean said, screwing up his face in thought. He was so tired. The research part of a hunt had never been particularly thrilling, but these days it was akin to torture and even the physical parts of the hunt didn't hold much for him now. He had seen enough bloodshed for several lifetimes.
This chapter is mostly fluff, but a set up for some future chapters. I have the next 4 or 5 chapters outlined.
Cas lifted his arm and twisted slightly to look down at the scar. “No, not bad at all. I would say I've had worse, but that wouldn't really be true.” he said, dropping his arm and shrugging.
He drank down greedily, unable to stop until he almost choked. He pushed away the flask, coughing and spluttering.
“I knew something was wrong straight away, So I crept back towards camp and when I saw what was happening, I didn't know what to do. So I..I hid.” Alfie looked ashamed.
Sam brushed his hair back off his face. “Yeah, it’s gonna take some work, but I think we can make it happen if we decide to do it.” Sam agreed.
“Not as bad as you thought, is it?” Cas chuckled as he again drew back a little, pushing in again, a little further each time.
“Nah, that sounds good, actually. We’ve only got one more day here before we go back, might as well make the most of it.” Dean agreed.
Gabriel stood a few feet away, his hands on his hips and a stern look on his face that was spoiled by the twinkle in his eye. The children began shrieking anew and ran at their father. Squeals of “Papa!” drowned out Gabriel's laugh as he vanished under a pile of wriggling children.
“I know, I just wanted to know how to do that stuff she talked about. If I wash up, maybe you could show me? You guys look exhausted, I can take a turn and then you can catch a nap, maybe?” said Dean, earnestly. “I swear, I'll do everything I'm told, to the letter.”
Hesitantly, he pulled on the waistband of Cas’ shorts, Cas shifted to make it easier and Dean reached inside, looking Cas in the eye the whole time. He flinched when his finger came into contact with the head of Cas’ dick, already wet with precome. Bolstering up his flagging confidence, he wrapped his hand around the shaft, pulling the waistband down and breaking eye contact to look at the dick in his hand.
“Are we buying it for our trip?” Cas asked, looking completely overwhelmed at the gear surrounding him. Almost everything had buckles and straps and came in various types of camo.
“That's why I'm helping you, you big baby.” Dean said, rolling his eyes. “Now, what size pants do you wear?” he asked.
Dean had always had a temper, and he never backed down from an argument, ever. He'd apologise later if he was wrong, but during an argument? No way, he'd keep escalating until someone walked out, or worse, died. For him to break down in the middle of a fight meant that something was wrong. For him to admit something was wrong, meant that something was
“Yeah, he's a cutie alright.” Benny agreed “Feelin' up to food an' company, chief? I can provide both.”
Castiel had noticed that there were only nine bodies. The original number of the group sent to the canyon had been twelve, counting him and Balthazar, so someone was missing. The damage done to the bodies made them impossible to identify, so they could only wonder who it was.
“Presiding over what's left of the clan. He's named himself Clan Alpha and by the looks of it, isn't a very good one. He's pretty much only got his hardcore supporters left. The rest are dead, or they've fled. I can't really tell without getting too close.” said Balthazar uneasily.
He flexed his fingers, the persistent ache in his broken arm had given way to a persistent itch. Jess had assured him that it was healing well, and the splint would be off in a matter of weeks, but he found his frustration and impatience growing with each day. He was not used to being idle or being limited for so long.
Cutting off the engine he checked his weapons and climbed out of the truck. Approaching the mouth of the cave, he squinted into the blackness, trying to see who was inside.
Castiel slept late, the sun was high in the sky and the temperature was unseasonably warm for February. It looked like spring would be early this year. Stretching and and rubbing his eyes, Castiel groaned, his back protesting at sleeping on the hard ground these last few weeks. His temporary camp site was a tiny cave, barely more than an overhang and too small to lay out fully in order to comfortably sleep. He blinked in the gloom and took stock, his pack was leaning against the wall of the cave, next to it was a canvas bag that twitched and rolled occasionally. Castiel had caught the rattlesnake last night, along with two others and they were more or less happily snuggled together in the bag.
Finally, with the promise of a flask of hot chocolate of his own, Jack calmed down. He sat on the tailgate of the truck with Sam as they programmed the GPS on their phones, co-ordinating fuel stops and coffee breaks. Dean checked over the truck one last time. Everything seemed fine, and now the new brakes were fitted, he felt confident the truck would make it. It would probably handle some of the roads better than Baby, he thought privately, sending a silent apology to the Impala parked alongside the beat-up truck.
(He's shy) Dean mouthed at the older lady and winked. She giggled and patted Deans hand sweetly. She smelled of violets and trouble.
Three chapters in a week? Oh yeah! Make the most of me being super productive. I guarantee it won't last.
“That’s- that’s really good, Dean. I’m happy to support you.” Sam stammered out awkwardly, making Dean roll his eyes.
With everyone around the map table, sipping on sodas and talking over each other about their trip, Sam allowed himself to really feel that retirement was the right thing to do, not just what Dean wanted. He knew he could stand to see more of this in his future. Maybe he’d find himself someone to share it with too. Mary had already agreed to help train new hunters, she planned on moving into the bunker permanently, to help Sam get set up.
Now I'm borrowing the business laptop, my husband thinks I'm doing invoices and I'm working really hard.
“You're God-damn right I did.” said John with no embarrassment whatsoever and everyone at the table burst into loud laughter.
Sam laughed and slapped Dean on the back. “I told you, Bobby took your idea and ran with it. This place is going to be a full settlement. There's gonna be a school and a clinic and everything!” he said excitedly.
She finished bandaging and patted him on the shoulder. “There, all done.” she said, standing up and pointing at Dean. “Okay, I know you have the surprise for him today, but don't let him overdo it. He doesn't need poppy syrup anymore, but no matter what he says, he's still in pain and he still needs rest. So just take it easy.” she said sternly.
There are some heavy chapters to come, I have 4-5 chapters outlined already and the overall story arc is complete now. I have some surprises in store and I hope you will like them (or not mwahahaha!). Finding time to write is difficult at the moment, I live by the beach, so summer is busy for me when the fam descends on me for a free holiday every year. I'll try.
Dean looked offended. “Jesus, Sam. What kind of bastard do you think I am? No, I didn't!” he almost shouted.
“Sorry, Cas. It sucks that you can't. Maybe we can find something you can enjoy. Doesn't have to be food, even.” Dean suggested.
“You’re welcome.” Cas murmured. “I believe we were coming up with ideas for if you retire from hunting. We realised that a cowboy slash rock star slash astronaut was a little unrealistic, so you thought about maybe opening a classic car repair business. You fell asleep as you described selling the cars in the bunkers garage to fund it.” Cas answered helpfully.
“Alfie...” breathed Castiel, relief flooding through him. “Oh thank god.” He rushed forward and had to restrain himself from dragging the younger man into a hug. After all he had been through, he wouldn't appreciate being woken like that.
“Oh yeah, that's what attracted me to Sam. Once I heard those ear splitting moose snores, I was a goner. I had to have him.” she joked, laughing again as Cas winced in sympathy.
Cas took a deep breath. None of this was Balthazar's fault, taking his anger out on the poor Beta was unfair. He sat down on the log opposite his friend and took several calming breaths, his angry Alpha scent going down a few notches.
“Grab some supplies, things we can eat and drink on the move. We are going to have to put a great deal of distance between us and this place before we can stop. It'll be light soon, so hurry.” whispered Cas. Dean nodded and motioned for Jo to help him.
Jack looked thoughtful. “I guess. Sam said he’ll teach me how to make a hammock and Dean said he’ll show me how to cook on the fire.” he looked at Cas. “Cas will show me all of the different plants and animals. How they are all connected.”
Dean looked down and bit his lip. “I got a ways to go before I can do that for you, but I wanna make you come.” he said shyly.
worse and survivable, Cas.” said Jess from the doorway, making both Cas and Dean jump. “As it is, this is going to affect the rest of your life. You have to be super careful about infection now. A rusty nail could kill you.” her face was serious as she dropped a bag on the table and sat down.
“Uh, I'm not sure that we can get you one of those anytime soon, baby. Papa and I will talk about it and we'll see about maybe a brother or sister in a few years, Okay?” said Dean, trying not to panic.
“No, no. I'm not mad anymore. Like I said, I get it. Jess was right, I kind of made it about me, and it's really not. There is a bigger picture. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry I made you feel bad about it.” he sighed. “This is why you've been quiet this week, huh? You were tryin' to figure out how to tell us. You made yourself sick worrying about it.” Cas nodded and Dean huffed a laugh. “See, I thought it was because you were embarrassed about your instincts going nuts so you were avoiding me. I guess I made that about me too, huh? Man, I really think a lot of myself, don't I?” he said bitterly, looking down.
Cas allowed himself to drift as Balthazar talked him down from the edge, the spots in his vision slowly cleared and the breath returned to his lungs. The nausea was persistent though and he swallowed over and over as he fought the urge to empty his stomach. Realizing he was fighting a losing battle, he pushed Balthazar away and staggered to the cave mouth and vomited.
“If I'd have known you kissed like that, I'd have done it ages ago. You have been holding out on me.” said Dean, looking a little put out at not knowing this essential information.
Nodding dumbly, Cas got out of the truck. Looking around he saw Hannah step out of the large vehicle and squeal, her hands covering her mouth in shock.
“Here, hold these ones, I'll put these back and get the others.” Dean said, handing Cas the outfit he had tried on. Cas gave a small nod.
“Well, if you change your mind. I'll be around.” he said in what he probably thought was a seductive tone before walking back out the way he came.
Sam and Dean sat outside for a while and cried together quietly, finally allowing themselves to grieve a little for their father. Sam wisely didn't push when Dean refused to discuss what had happened to them all at the compound. The brothers were just enjoying each others familiar scents again after such a long separation. Dean asked questions about Jess and Sam couldn't stop himself from gushing like a teenager over his mate. Sam couldn't help but notice that Dean shied away from physical contact, and unless he initiated it, he flinched or froze. It made him sad, Dean had always been a tactile person. He still gave affection, but seemed to stall over receiving it. He decided to leave that question for another day and just concentrated on being with his brother again.
Dean looked miserable, and Sam could smell the sorrow in his scent. It wasn't the same as the sorrow that had permanently tainted their fathers scent, it was a mere hint in comparison, but it was there. He vowed to himself that he would make time for his brother, who for all intents and purposes was separated from his mate. Sam was pretty sure that Dean and Cas were a foregone conclusion. It made him happy to know that his brother had found someone, and Cas was a good Alpha for Dean. Sam liked him, he came across as aloof, formal and a little terrifying at first, but after getting to know him, Sam had realised that Cas had hidden depths and was in fact, a gentle soul.
Charlie just cried and burrowed further into Dean's arms. Dean looked up and met Bobby's eyes as the Alpha looked furious in the doorway. Dean stiffened and Charlie looked up at Dean and turned to face Bobby.
For one brief moment last night he had thought Dean was going to kiss him, their faces had only been inches apart. But Castiel had hesitated and the moment had passed. The problem wasn't that he wasn't attracted to Dean, because he most certainly was. It was that he felt the possibility of
Sam was thrilled for them, even picking Cas’ pocket to steal the keys to his truck so Cas would have to ride with Dean for the drive back. The fact he was beginning to feel nauseated by them was only a tiny part of it. Sam was just a big old romantic, really.
“A few days ago. Once we knew you were alive and coming home, we were celebrating and, well, it sorta happened.” said Sam awkwardly.
Cas walked over to the door, unlocking it and opening it to find Mary on the other side, her eyebrow raised and a smirk on her lips.
I'm still trying to find the balance, but I guess that's what I'm here for, to learn and grow as a writer.
Cas gave him a soft look. “Good morning, Dean. I’ll get some coffee going in a moment. Did you sleep well?” he asked.
“Fine, you won. But I want a rematch when we come back through here.” Dean warned, only half jokingly.
Jess looked up and her eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Infused oil for the lantern? That is absolutely genius, Bobby.” she beamed as Bobby blushed a little.
Cas looked around at the understanding looks he was receiving with surprise and gratitude, but it was clear he was waiting for Deans approval over anyone else.
“The others...they...oh god.” stammered Alfie, as Castiel tried to sooth him. “We know, we saw. How did you get away?” said Castiel gently, letting Alfie go and kneeling on the ground next to him.
Cas leaned out of the window and opened fire again, forcing the guards to duck and roll out of the way as the truck burst through the gateway and thundered down the cracked and split road, out into the desert, the sound of gunfire dropping off as the truck turned out of sight.
Deciding that putting the toiletries away could wait, he filled the coffee machine and flicked the switch, listening to the gurgling as the machine brewed a fresh pot. He leaned against the counter and chewed his lip as he worried about his brother.
“But I couldn’t see myself with a dog before her either. I guess it was more… She needed someone. And I think we needed—
The next memory was a good one, thankfully. They stayed in that field for a little while, surrounded by flowers and bees and brightness. Dean could feel the sunshine penetrating his skin and knew it had to be helping Castiel, too, as he brought his hands away from his ears, stopped wiping away blood that didn’t exist, in favor of toying with the stem of a wildflower. He came back to himself, bit by bit, until at last they could move on.
Ahead, Dean made out a faint, dark figure and froze. It didn’t move, didn’t make a sound, and but it looked familiar. He drew closer and the prone figure became recognizable even before he could make out the tan of the trenchcoat.
With Sam in Hell, Dean and Jack spend some time together. Dean realizes that losing Cas left a bigger impact than he thought.
Dean neither knew nor cared how long he sat there. His grief only grew deeper with each minute, especially with the sheer despair of realizing that Castiel’s true happiness was what had killed him. His happiness was coming out, speaking his truth, and now he was dead. Dean ran out of tears, but ugly, breathless sobs still racked his body when he found it in himself to pull back onto the road.
Around them, the bunker flickered a few times before it collapsed and vanished, leaving them standing in the cold emptiness between memories. It bit deeper than before, after so much time in the warmth and security of the fantasy. Dean felt Castiel shudder as he pulled away, but he wasn’t worried about it. Castiel had faced so much, so many hardships that Dean hadn’t even known about before entering his mind, but he was strong. He kept fighting. More than that, Cas had something to fight for: Jack, the Winchesters, love, his own agency... Castiel could make it out of his own mind.
Dean’s head snapped up from the expressionless face of his best friend to his brother and son. There was too much to say, so they left it unsaid, settling instead for “Bring him home.”
Cas shrugged and opened the fridge, bringing out the cheese and setting it on the counter before reaching back in for the beer.
“I ain't blind. I ain't mad either, so cut the Alpha crap.” he said looking at Jess, who blushed and relaxed her posture. “Sorry Bobby.” she said
An idea came to him. “Hey, Jack. Find some little rocks, Cas, I saw some empty cans in your truck, grab ‘em. We’re gonna play a game to pass the time.” he said with a grin.
“I'm worried about you Dean, even before last night. You won't tell me what happened to you at that compound, it must have been bad for you to have a nightmare about it that stank out the whole house and almost caused an Alpha brawl! I want to help you, you're my brother and I love you. Let me!” Sam ranted angrily.
Talking about the future was difficult, they were only too aware that with things as they were, making any plans or promises were impossible. Instead they discussed hopes and dreams in vague terms. Although Dean had quietly confessed that he had already picked a place to build his own home and also had a rough idea of the design. When he had gotten carried away describing exactly how he imagined the sun striking the back deck on a summer evening, he'd looked up to see the softest look on Castiels face and had blushed and refused to talk about it again, no matter how much Cas had encouraged him to continue.
Despite Cas healing him the night before, Dean still walked with a slight limp the next morning. Sam had done his best not to laugh at Deans predicament after Cas had glared at him in warning. Sam had learned from Deans mistake about pissing off the nerd angel.
“Not if you don't mean it. Otherwise that's just cruel.” said Dean, pouting as he looked up at the Alpha.
It was a sure sign that he and Jess had made a baby or two. They were going to be parents. He was equal parts thrilled and terrified at the prospect. Jess was her usual calm self, but her scent had betrayed the fact that she too, was apprehensive. The whole household was aware of the situation, no-one had said anything, but it was obvious by the way everyone watched him like a hawk, as if a sign would appear over his head saying “PREGNANT”.
“What? Sam what's wrong? I can feel when you are worried about something, tell me. Please?” said Jess, sounding almost desperate to help her Omega, like it was causing her physical pain that Sam was unhappy about something.
Claire crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes. “I can see that, dumb ass.” she said snarkily. “When did this happen?” she asked, pointing between them, her face like stone.
Ellen shrugged and sat down opposite him with a cup of tea for her and Amy. “Who else was gonna do it? It wasn't a big deal, hon.” she said, dismissively.
“I dunno. I'm just tired. Ain't been sleepin' too well.” Dean said, his voice hoarse. “Probably slept about 2 hours in the last three or four days.”
“The shed will take me a week to go through. Have you been in there recently? I have no idea where Bobby finds this stuff” said Sam not-so-secretly itching to explore and categorize the wonders of the shed.
anything.” Cas burst out. “I just realised something today, that's all. I just need to accept it. It's not anything you did, per say. It's personal.”
On the drive home, Dean cast his mind back to previous times he'd been mistaken for gay. He wasn't enough of a liar to deny that some of those instances were his own fault. Aaron had even used it against him to throw him off. He'd made himself an easy target on more than one occasion.
Jack let go and stepped back. “Thank you for bringing me. This is already amazing. It’s so beautiful here.” he said, looking up and turning around, his arms up and a smile on his face.
“It ain't exactly comfortable for us right now, so we deserve to know why we ended up with an infestation of bandits” snarked Dean as Amy sat down the other side of them, Matthew curling into her chest falling asleep.
Cas hesitated for a split second before launching the rock at blistering speed, hitting the fence itself and knocking all of the cans down at once as well as the post holding it up.
Jack shook his head, that would take too long. Santa might have to leave before Jack got to see him, he had a lot to do tonight, after all.
“Okay,but just wait 'til I tell the whole story, before you judge me too harshly.” Said Benny, shifting to get comfortable, he began.
The cop smiled. “Well, of course he is. Just gotta be patient with ‘im, that’s all. Is your fella there his real Pa? They look like peas in a pod.” he said, looking at Cas who was straightening Jacks collar as they chatted between themselves.
Cas looked proud. “Your idea could save a lot of lives, Jack. I’m very proud of you.” he said, smiling widely.
Dean nodded. “Cas overheard and asked me why I didn’t correct them, I told him the same thing I told you, and.. well...” he squirmed in his seat.
Cas laughed and Dean chuckled as he playfully shoved the Alpha towards the door. “C'mon, daylights burnin'. You are gonna love this, man.” said Dean excitedly.
All three had been taken in a raid on Jo's mothers roadhouse. They had never met before that night, Charlie and Amy had been travelling separately but had chosen to stay at the roadhouse on their journey. The place had been burned to the ground and Jo's father, a burly Alpha named Bill Harvelle had been murdered trying to protect them. They had no idea what had happened to Jo's mother or Amy's son.
“Cas, I wasn't disgusted, man. I was surprised. You have to believe me.” he said. Not yet willing to make his own confession just yet. He had a lot of thinking to do. Finding yourself attracted to your very much male best friend, who confessed themselves in love with you all in one day, was a lot for anyone to take.
During this Jess examined Cas with Ellen's help, his condition had worsened and he was now completely listless and almost unresponsive. Dean had hovered nervously, until Jess asked him politely to stop blocking the light. So he had busied himself entertaining baby Matthew instead.
“Sorry, Bobby.” mumbled Dean as Sam looked abashed and also mumbled an apology. Both boys turning to the food again, with remarkably improved manners from Dean.
“I wanna get some fluids in you and warm you up a bit before I move you, son. I'll get some things from the truck, the dog will stay with you. Let him lay down next to you, his body heat will warm you up a bit.” Bobby stood and walked back to the truck. Sam barely registered Rumsfeld flopping his enormous body down next to him, placing his head in Sam's lap. Sam absently began stroking the dogs massive head and Rumsfeld was almost giddy from the attention, his tail stump wriggling madly and his tongue flicking out at intervals to lick Sam's hand.
“I don't know who was more shocked. There I was preparing to die because the woman I loved was murdered, and she walks in the room. Then I noticed the mating bite. I broke. I begged her to tell me who her Alpha was, I told her I'd kill him and we'd leave together. We could be a family at last. I wanted to save her from being a slave. It's been known to happen before.” Benny's voice was wobbling now, and he choked back a sob.
“I'm in love with you.” Cas blurted. His eyes bulged in horror at his own outburst and he clapped his hands over his mouth.
“I fuckin' hope so, Charlie. He doesn't deserve this.” his anger and sadness bleeding into his voice.
Dean felt something he'd never felt before. Attraction to his best friend. Full on, want to touch all over, kiss with tongue, attraction.
They finished breakfast and cleaned the dishes before each of them left the kitchen to begin the discussed chores. Sam stripping the bedclothes and emptying the laundry hampers and piling everything up on the concrete floor of the scrub room off the kitchen. Two large tubs sat in the middle of the room, next to a mangle. Drying rails were fixed all around the room, some with linens already draped over them. As Sam dropped the last of the laundry down and began to sort it, Dean walked in carrying a pot of steaming water.
It was a vehicle of some kind, it looked like a two storey building on wheels. It was painted in various bright garish colours, had been patched several times over and had clearly been in place for a while, judging by the faded bunting and lights strung up in the surrounding trees. There were awnings covering a seating area to one side, with a well used fire pit that was stacked with wood, but not yet lit. Several dark haired, golden skinned children ran around playing a game, their shrieks of laughter could be heard over the sound of the truck engine.
“You’re a fucking pig.” Sam scowled at his brother, who waggled his eyebrows and grinned, showing the food in his mouth.
Cas felt strange driving the truck without Dean beside him. The silence was almost unbearable. He found it strange that he had spent months in complete isolation, without talking to a soul, without any human contact and it hadn't really bothered him. Whereas now, he missed Dean and his new friends intensely and it had only been hours. Part of him wished he had taken Benny up on the offer to come with him. But he knew he'd made the right decision in that regard. Benny would not do well in the politics of Michaels clan, the strict hierarchy and rules would quickly become a problem for the outsider Alpha.
Cas sat by the fire, gently feeding the flames with the impressive pile of firewood Jack had collected. The sky was beginning to lighten, but the sun had yet to make an appearance. The last of the stars faded in the pink early morning light. The birds were waking up, calling to each other in the surrounding trees and the morning dew covered every surface, giving everything an ethereal, magical look.
“Three, it makes it easier to unload and reload all of our shit.” he said, putting the car into park and killing the engine.
Without the stop in Ohio, the drive back was long and tedious. Deans back was screaming at him and his neck and shoulders felt like bunched rocks as they drove into the motel that evening.
Cas looked devastated. “A month? I can't stay for a month! That's ridiculous. I have to get back to my clan. They need me! I can stay a week at most.” he said desperately.
Your comments and kudos, as always feed my poor, withered ego. I get so excited when I see a new message in my inbox, thank you so much for your support.
“You- you were attracted to me?” Cas asked, his voice was surprisingly squeaky and his eyes were alight with hope.
Dean staggered and laughed. “Whoa, not that I don’t appreciate a good old attack hug, but why, Kiddo?”
Dean shrugged. “A little sore, my back hurts a little, legs feel weird.” he said, his cheeks going red.
Deans eyes were dry and beginning to itch, the book he was reading supposedly had an easier way to trap a variety of monsters, but he was finding it difficult to get past the dry text to get to the really useful info. He sat back and rubbed his eyes, then rubbed his sore neck and shoulders with a sigh.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, Dean’s pretty competitive, but Cas never backs down from a challenge. This should be fun.” he grinned.
He took a moment to watch Deans face relax, the tension falling from his features and making him look younger. He was suddenly overcome with the urge to drop a kiss onto Deans now smooth brow. He chuckled at the absurd image it brought up and stood.
