“They moved the auction back three weeks so it's going to be a bit longer till we can get Cash back.”
His sub has always gotten off best with dirty talk, usually a mix of humiliation and praise, and he whimpers softly. “Yes, Master.”
So it’s time to have “the talk” about whether you wanna pursue another contract with your dom. Billie and I have talked and we wanna be sure you two are alright with whatever decision you come to. Would you be open to meeting here at the club? We can schedule it on Friday night if you’re free, just let me know and I can have Billie reach out to your dom.
Castiel wheels him out of the room and down out the front entrance. He squints at the bright sunlight and jumps a bit when he feels something tickle his ears, but it's just Castiel putting a pair of sunglasses on him. Castiel places a feather light kiss to the top of his head that Dean can barely feel. His Dom thinks of everything.
Castiel scowls and takes a long sip of his beer. Hannah seems to realize he’s not really in the mood for teasing, because she says, “Sorry, not important. Tell me about the…”
He opens it to find what looks like a medical office, with an eye chart on the wall, a rolling stool, and a medical table. There is no sign of his dom. He feels anticipation building, nerves on edge as he peers around, seeing a large, simple cot on the far side and a short counter with cabinets on it. If he didn’t know better, he would think he was in any medical examination room, about to get a physical.
“Yeah, I think so.” Dean shrugs a little. “We went through the same events again but I dunno it just didn’t feel as…weighted? I didn’t get that tight throat feeling and the panic that always comes just…wasn’t there.” Dean sounds a bit miffed by the whole thing and Castiel tries to stifle a smile.
He catches sight of Sam standing awkwardly by the doorway before he slips out of the room. He gives Castiel’s arm a quick squeeze and whispers, “Cover me.” He ducks past his yammering family and moves to find his brother. He doesn’t need to search far—Sam is waiting for him in the front hall, pulling him in for a bear hug. Dean wonders if Sam has had another growth spurt.
They soak in silence, legs tangled together and his eyes end up fluttering shut. His body feels heavier and before he knows it Cas if guiding him up and out of the tub, toweling off every inch of his skin with the softest towel in existence. He begins to think he needs to read the tag and make a trip to Bed Bath and Beyond next weekend.
“Bye, Michael.” There’s a distinctive click on the line as he hangs up. Dean stares at his feet a second, all of this impending deadline of doom feeling far too real. “Thank you for finding me,” Castiel’s voice is rough and sincere.
“Gorgeous,” Castiel breathes, fighting the urge to cover his sub with light and reverent touches. But he’ll save that for aftercare. “Kneel,” he instructs, then turns his attention briefly back to Cain and Benny, their eyes blown wide at the sight of the sub in a snug pair of panties and nothing else. “What do you think of my whore, gentlemen?”
There's a sharp snarl on the other end of the phone. “If anyone lays a hand on you, I will tear their throats out.” Castiel’s terrifying threat only makes Dean smile.
“Jo,” she says, sticking out a hand and he takes it giving it a good shake. “Missouri asked me to keep an eye out for you. Come on.” She nods her head, leading back into the house. There seems to be an entry room with small cubbies for shoes and coats, and then they head into an industrial-sized kitchen.
, and okay, he’d done the rivets by hand and maybe if he'd measured them more evenly, but he liked the natural look to it. Castiel leans in to him now, hand still firmly on his neck. “Would be completely perfect if you were laid out on it for me.”
“Castiel, you need first-aid. Maybe stitches—” Missouri begins, but Cas interrupts, his patience wearing thin.
Dean gasps as he feels the press of Castiel’s lithe body against his own. One hand sinks into Dean’s damp hair, pulling his head to the side as Castiel buries his face in the crook of his neck. Dean squirms as he feels the press of a leg between his own, and god help him as his bowed legs widen easily. Warm lips ghost over his cool damp skin, and he feels the swift intake of breath.
Castiel hums, nosing at his neck where Roman's hand was, and suddenly a warm wet mouth has latched onto him, arms pulling him into his chest. He lets out an audible gasp.
, exactly, he didn’t realize. There are too many things to count. He didn’t realize his father couldn’t be trusted? He didn’t realize love was more important than biology?
“Hey Dad, you remember Castiel.” Dean nods over his shoulder as his dad looks up at both of them, taking them in.
Castiel grins, a rush of excitement burning in his body, his cock already hardening at just the thought of being with Dean. But he wills it down and takes Dean’s hands, kissing his knuckles as they walk hand-in-hand towards the falls.
Dean blushes, as if they’re sharing the same memories…and maybe they are. He scoots closer again, this time their thighs and hips brushing, and throws a hand behind Castiel’s shoulder. He leans in hesitantly, lips dangerously close to brushing Castiel’s ear.
“Maybe,” Dean replied quietly. Castiel’s eyes went wide at the first sign of Dean’s voice but he didn’t comment on it.
“Wow,” Dean mutters, meeting Cas in the middle as they walk towards each other. The honeycomb on Castiel’s hand is sticky and a little runny, his hand certainly needing a proper wash once their tasting is done.
“Bobby says you took it for a drive around the block to see how it ran, and you didn’t come back. He went looking for you and found you and the car in a ditch.” Sam looks at him expectantly, waiting for him to fill in the blanks.
“Not in college,” Dean says gruffly, “and don’t have a resume, really. Got my GED and I’ve been workin’ at the family business since I could hold a wrench.”
“Good boy,” the dom purrs, fingertips gently pushing on Dean’s shoulder blades, steadying him before moving away. Dean keeps his head still and eyes down as his dom moves to the bed and comes back to stand in front of him.
“I believe you, but…” He looks away, gazing at the pond. “Seeing you with someone else really fucking blindsided me, ya know?”
Castiel leans into his office chair, attempting to sort through his email inbox. He’s trying to concentrate on work, he really is, but his mind keeps wandering. At the forefront, there’s the memory of how it felt to be buried inside of Dean—last night
“I don’t know,” he admits, “we haven’t reviewed the security footage yet. But Sam, I swear, they’ll never have the opportunity to touch you or Dean again.”
His body still feels funny, weak and loose, so he works to keep his balance as he follows his Dom. Castiel’s strides are infuriatingly smooth and confident. You would never know looking at Castiel that he had just spent what felt like hours torturing Dean to the brink of orgasm and pulling him back only to fuck him into submission. He thinks Castiel must’ve wiped him down while he dozed, but he thinks he can still feel some of his come inside him.
“Holy shit,” Dean gawks as Castiel runs to catch Cash who has trotted away and is now trying to reach the grass through the fence. Abby runs to her daughter and seems to be easing her to her feet, cradling her arm.
“Just to make sure you know it,” he reminds the sub gently. Dean sighs in relief, then falls to his elbows, hands clasped at the wrist and head down, ass on full display and ready for spanking. “Very enticing…very sexy, Dean. It would be difficult to punish you like this, gorgeous boy, though considering how much you’ve enjoyed your previous spankings, it’s not a punishment, is it?”
Dean picks at some more bacon before making a plate for his lazy brother. He brings the food to the suite, plopping it on the small table and going to put on some comfy clothes for the day. He digs out his favorite soft jeans that he can’t give up—even with the rip in the knee—and his old AC/DC shirt.
Castiel feels some inkling of strain begin to settle into his hand, an injury forming, but he pushes forward. “I should have known you would handcuff Dean to a table, would bite him against his will, would leave him alone and sick to die. What else did you do to him, you filth?”
“That’s excellent, Dumah, thank you for that update,” Chuck says from the head of the table, scribbling notes in his portfolio. “With growth like that, I fully expect for Purgatory to expand into a second facility within the next three to five years.” He looks around the long table at all the department heads and board members, and smiles gratefully. “We are all going to be part of something very exciting! I look forward to working with you all.”
“Surely you’ve hit subspace before? You presented five years ago.” Castiel is looking at him again, but this time more with concern then disapproval.
“One question, and you can’t fly off in an alpha tizzy.” Crowley tears his eyes off his screen, folding his hands on the surface of the desk. “I know you’ve got ‘pitcher’ written all over you, but are you sure you don’t secretly like catching, dear? Because Dick Roman has thoroughly fucked you.”
The door to the patio opens behind them, the sounds of Kevin and Jo carrying down the largest of the coolers, each holding a handle. Castiel takes a stumbling step backwards, trying to look casual, as if they weren’t just having a private lover’s talk. Lost on what to do next, he heads in the direction of the grill. He drops the food off on a free surface, watching out of the corner of his eye as Dean grabs a towel and dries off.

The sub slouches in his chair. “Oh, um…sorta forgot about it.” He grins sheepishly, adding in a rush, “Sorry, Sir,” though his tone is still light and amused.

“Get your ass out here right this minute,” the woman practically spits. Dean blocks the doorway instinctively, sparing a quick glance back to see Amy clinging to Sam’s side looking downright terrified.
“They are gonna love you, babe, just like I do.” He squeezes Cas’ knee, wanting to laugh at the sub comforting the dom, but he knows their relationship is bigger than just that. They’re there for each other in whatever way they need to be, and it fits. It’s everything he could want, and he’s ready to share that with his family.
and immediately. He doesn’t stop to clean up the come, but makes his sub lick his fingers clean with desperate precision.
“Is Sam okay? Are you okay?” he asks, bracing himself for the reply. He doesn’t have the stomach to answer Castiel’s question just yet.
“I know,” Castiel says with a long exhale. “I just—I don’t want to go without Dean, and he isn’t fully healed yet.”
“But I...I never missed any of the school's art shows,” he says, his voice going soft. “I went to every single one.”
“Tell me,” Castiel demands, feeling on the brink as his balls begin to draw up, the electricity growing in his lower belly. “Tell me you want my come, my good boy, my best boy.”
“What?” Castiel asks, flabbergasted. “No, Dean, absolutely not.” His eyes revert momentarily back to his brother, who gives him a slight frown. “Gabriel is right, unfortunately, but not because I don’t trust him. I suppose, after everything Lucifer has done to us, I’m just…”
Sam turns red again with the attention put on him now. “Actually, I did kinda meet someone, but we’re still figuring things out.”
“Jesus, Dean, I’ve missed you.” Castiel sighs, leaning back against the pillows. His hand still grips Dean’s hair, but he lets Dean lead for now.
The next hour passes in a blur, with Castiel showering and dressing in record speed and then sliding into the passenger’s seat of Hannah’s car as they head towards Copley Square. The traffic is tedious and busy, but nothing they weren’t expecting, and they park a few blocks away, carrying empty tote bags in their arms. The produce is fresh and vividly colorful and Castiel’s stomach growls so loudly that Hannah laughs and nudges them towards a sandwich stand. All the surrounding benches are taken, so they stand against a column and eat their early lunches in companionable silence. He really does enjoy spending time with Hannah—she’s sweet, reliable, kind. An ideal coworker and friend.
The table has been set for two, though there are two pillowy kneepads on the floor beside each chair. Becky lowers herself to the pillow closest to the head of the table, and Chuck takes his seat as well, reaching for his cup of coffee. Castiel looks at the kneepad next to his chair thoughtfully and asks, “Expecting company?”
“Get off, you motherfuckers!” Dean struggles to free his hands, but the knots are tight and there's a heavy boot pressing into his now bare back, holding him down.
He limps a little now toward his own bed, too tired to even take his clothes off. He burrows under the covers, pulling the phone from his pocket. He stares at the voicemails, wondering if he should listen or not. His fingers decide for him and press play on the first one, Castiel’s rough scared voice in his ears.
“You’re still healing, Dean. I won’t leave you.” Castiel looks at him, teeth grinding and obviously stressed.
“But hey, at least he was cool about it,” Dean says reasonably, hand sliding on Castiel’s shoulder. “He’s gotta be like, the least judgmental person ever.”
Castiel turns in his chair, then lifts Dean’s chin up roughly, their eyes meeting. “I don’t appreciate your tone of voice, boy,” he says in a low, steady grumble, gripping Dean tightly. “You don’t want to rest on your pillow? Okay then. Go stand in the corner.”
“Oh, hell yeah. But we changed up from Monopoly to Acquire or Settlers, depending on Charlie's mood, mostly. You should come to the next game night.” He hopes he isn’t being too pushy with Cas, but he
“You are now, and will always be, the sexiest, most beautiful thing I have ever seen,” Castiel tells him, and Dean can hear the earnestness in his words. He blushes a little before planting a chaste kiss on his alpha’s lips.
Dean’s face pales for a moment, some of his earlier joy at being reunited with his brother vanishing off his face. “Yeah, well, s’not like you’re paying for it.”
“D-Dean…” Castiel pants, pulling away as the omega lets out a low whimper at the loss. “We need to get to work, I have a meeting in ten minutes.” Castiel looks down at Dean, regret in his eyes.
He lets the sentence hang in the air stiffly, internally angry at himself for ruining the mood so early on. Dean is still gazing at him, a bit of worry etched on his face.
“Uh, hey Cas,” Dean replies, apparently unable to avoid seeing them. The ache in his chest returns immediately.
The office is surprisingly busy when Castiel hobbles in. He’s never been to a physical therapist’s office before, but as the receptionist guides him further into the back, he sees the space resembles a gym more than a medical office.
“—can’t believe this case is even going to trial, right?” Dean looks up at Sam and realizes he had been talking.
He bottoms out and Dean gasps—whether from the impact of finally being penetrated or from Castiel’s words, he isn’t sure. The feeling of finally being inside of Dean is overwhelming, warm and stimulating and damp with slick. He doesn’t begin to move immediately though, allowing Dean time to adjust as he tries to get his own impulses under control. He sees tears forming at the corner of Dean’s eyes and begins to fear the worst.
He uncoils the rope a moment, evening it out before looping it around the back of his neck. He pulls down, feeling the tension on his skin, and smiles from it. He really needs to have a talk with his dom about fitting bondage into one of their scenes. He goes to work carefully, wrapping the rope under his pecs and around his back. It’s a classic tortoise shell pattern and the only one he feels comfortable doing to himself. With each snug pull and stretch of the rope on his skin he feels his nerves easing.
Castiel considers their pitch, keeping his face an unreadable mask. “And how much does his stock sell for?”
“Night Dean.” Sam heads upstairs and he listens till he hears the bedroom door shut before pulling out his phone.
“I love seeing my marks on you. It's so beautiful,” Castiel whispers, nuzzling at Dean’s ear. “Come. I think it's time we get you something to eat and drink.”
Dean’s stomach gives another painful twist, and he growls at the uncomfortable itch under his skin. It almost feels like the end of a heat cycle, though without the temperature spike and his mind is clear. His omega feels like its pacing inside his chest and clawing at the bars trying to get out…but for what?
“There now, that's better. They told me you were off-limits to contract trainers, a real screw-up of a submissive. Already knew you were a terrible sub. I see none of my lessons stuck with you, did they? Still a disrespectful failure, aren’t you? Look at you, covered in all these marks. Stupid soft Dom doesn’t know you won’t learn anything till you're made to bleed, will you, Deano?”
Castiel lets out a long sigh, staring out the window. Dean takes pity on him, reaching a hand across the seat and placing it on his knee. Castiel turns and gives him a tight-lipped smile, worry still creasing his eyes.
, but in his stubbornness, he hasn’t permitted Castiel to attend. The thought of Dean not advocating for himself or his best interests makes Castiel’s stomach churn. He knows Dean inside and out, the way you can only know someone you’ve fallen deeply—and terribly—in love with. Castiel has no doubt that Dean is being reckless right now, that he’s not vetting these Doms properly before agreeing to a year-long contract with one of them. Castiel should be in the negotiation room, explaining Dean’s needs, how he reaches subspace properly, the way he challenges his Dom before submitting fully, how he likes his coffee and will do anything for pie and secretly loves cuddling during aftercare and how soft his lips are—
“Of course. It may be something you do for just an evening after a hard day at work, or over a weekend with your Dom. However often feels right for you, sweetheart. There is still a vast world of kinks to explore that can help meet your needs.” Castiel’s smile is warm and earnest.
he’s gonna get. He wants to have as little reliance on this Dom as he can. If they can be friendly roommates who scene once in a while, keeping feelings out of it, then he might be able to get through that.
Castiel’s hand softens then and cups his face, his features softening. “I wish I had more time for you, but I am sure you need to go attend to your cart.” Castiel sounds regretful now.
Castiel’s hearts softens considerably at the words. He thinks for a brief moment about his sub, the gorgeous green-eyed man, and hopes he’s reaching out to a friend if he’s experiencing subdrop. There’s nothing Castiel can do to help him outside of a scene, but at least with ‘67, he can coach his friend through this.
He glances around, taking in nearly double the amount of implements and tools in the room than he’s used to seeing. Impact toys, stockade, suspension rigging, spanking bench, and the typical blanket-less bed.
“Jo, you're not supposed to talk to him,” Anna said with a sympathetic tone once she caught sight of Dean.
“I'll be downstairs on the couch. I left you some water. Just yell if you need anything, okay?” He waited a second before turning to go and was halted by a quiet voice behind him.
Castiel beams down at him. “I’m pleased to hear it, Dean. Seeing you well-fed and in a better mood makes me feel much better, too.” He grips the back of Dean’s neck, touching his smooth, freckled skin. He really is gorgeous—and just being in his presence makes Castiel’s feel more alive somehow, like he’s opened his eyes for the first time in years. But when he glances up, he sees Alfie heading past their table, and calls him over.
“Sorry to interrupt,” the blonde alpha begins, looking a little rumpled and unkempt, like she rolled out of bed and put on the first clothes she found, “but Cas—have you heard the news?”
Dean then began to tell Castiel all about his baby, when he got her from his dad at sixteen, what engine she had, the time he showed Sammy how to drive in a parking lot, the many times she was what they called home as a kid. The more he talked the more he began to feel a sensation of homesickness set in and lost his motivation to continue his story. He could be wrong, but thought maybe Cas sensed this and didn't push he when he suddenly went silent.
“So…” he begins, hoping to sound as nonchalant as possible. “What’s your next step? In seeking out this new type of relationship?”
“—all I’m saying is, you help me, I help you,” he says oily, a small smirk playing on his lips. He glances up and spots Castiel standing behind an armchair, chest heaving as he takes in the despicable alpha sitting in front of him. “Listen, Asmodeus, my next appointment just arrived. Can I call you back…? Oh, you’re busy? Well, between eating buckets of fried chicken and getting some omega to suck your greasy cock, how about you make time for my proposal, too?” Roman chuckles, teeth white and gleaming. “Yeah, yeah, I hear you, old friend. I look forward to using that bitch’s mouth real soon. Tomorrow, then.”
“For someone who violates and assaults people, I figured it would be obvious.” Castiel tightens his fist and punches his face again, and again, as Roman’s face begins to swell. “You lie and cheat—”
Castiel’s eyes are watery—his sight bleary at best—as he fights back a deep yawn and leans over his laptop. It’s nearly dinnertime, but he hasn’t stopped to sleep, much less eat or drink.
“What Sam said,” Charlie says, nudging Castiel’s elbows impishly. “Though I’ll add that, when you’re packing for the camping trip, don’t forget… The best sex is safe sex.”
“Um, the one where you manhandled me against the wall and had your dirty little alpha way with me,” Dean retorts, grinning suggestively. “Though, from what I felt against my thigh, there’s nothing
“Shit!” he curses, adding in a big ladle of broth that splashes over the edge of the pan and hurries to stir the rice and salvage the meal.
Henrickson stands up and walks closer. “Here are some pamphlets for you,” he says, passing little folded packets into his hands. Dean looks down at the cover. A tall, handsome man stands in a sharp navy suit, his hair neatly parted and cool blue eyes staring right at the camera. His hand rests on the head of another man kneeling next to him, naked and hands covering his cock, head tipped down in submission. Dean can’t take his eyes off the dominant in the picture. Something about that look makes his stomach drop.
Castiel looks between Alastair and Dean, wondering if he’s being overprotective…but he can’t help himself. He warns, “I would appreciate if you didn’t try to intimidate my sub,” in a low and steady voice. He feels some of Dean’s tension release slightly, like he’s put his trust back into Castiel. Alastair seems surprised by the rebuke and doesn’t answer.
Any ounce of hope Dean held in his chest is drained right out of him. “How are you even here? They blacklisted you,” Dean snarls, moving into a crouch and getting ready to defend himself, which might be the biggest joke of all. At this point, he’s fairly certain a strong breeze would knock him over.
“Yes, Master, thank you,” the man breathes with relief, and Cas isn’t sure if he’s referring to the end of his spanking, the medicine he’s being sent home with, or the burn of his belt seared in his skin. Possibly all three.
He goes over the paperwork one more time for the new horse coming in tomorrow. He’s concerned with what the owners told him about the gelding. He thinks there might be a lot of baggage to unpack and he hopes the owners are patient enough to let Castiel have the time he needs to figure the horse out. The way they talked about the horse sounded like they’d already written him off, and Castiel was the last chance before he was shipped off to auction.
“Apologies,” he mutters, grabbing a napkin to wipe off the excess water. “I have to admit, you’re more distracting in this outfit than I anticipated, Dean. My goal in having you cover up was to avoid getting any sort of sunburn on this gorgeous, freckled skin…” He brings his hand to Dean’s neck, rubbing his thumb over a tight knot in his neck, and making Dean’s eyes close. “But maybe you’ll wear sets like these inside as well. Be my pretty boy, all enticing and silky and ready for me to worship you. Would you like that?”
“There’s a problem with that, Dean,” Castiel says in a shaky voice. He looks behind him, their eyes meeting. He’s glad to see Dean’s gaze is open and interested, eager to hear what Castiel is going to say next. “I’ve never been able to keep a level head around you, have I?”
“Oh, oh, oh yes, Cas! Harder!” he pants, and relishes the growl and feel of teeth grazing the back of his neck.
Dean can barely stop the tremors in his body. Everything hurts, and he thinks he may have broken a bone in his hand. He sits down on the empty cot farthest from the other cellmates and pulls his knees to his chest. He doesn’t know how much longer he can keep this up. His body is exhausted, and he still feels sick with worry about his brother.
“Yeah, um, about your brother…” Dean swallows, looking at Castiel unwaveringly. Cas frowns but listens closely, missing the warmth of his omega in his arms. “That’s actually why I came to see you. I was talking to Sam about the party last night, and he mentioned that he ran into Lucifer.”
He hesitates a moment before responding with a small nod of the head. “I heard someone outside was looking for you.”
“Damn right you are,” the dom huffs out and leans over his back, slamming down hard right into Dean’s prostate. He cries out at the shocks it sends ricocheting through his body. He can’t take much more before he collapses under the onslaught, soaring higher and higher with each thrust into him. “Come for me, come now!” and just like that he’s spilling hard and filling the white lace, shaking and gripping the bedding like his life depends on it.
He almost puts a question mark at the end of the sentence, but thankfully catches himself. He isn’t that desperate or fishing for compliments. He begins to fidget as he watches the three typing dots appear and disappear several times without a reply. Fucking
“I have you, Dean. We will get this all sorted out,” Castiel tells him calmly as he maneuvers Dean toward a spanking bench.
“We were identical twins. But when we presented during our junior year of high school, I was an alpha and he was an omega,” Castiel says levely, finding a spot on his comforter and staring at it pointedly. “That’s unusual for twins, but my family took it surprisingly well. He used blockers constantly, of course, and we had money—which meant Jimmy wouldn’t have to face the same sort of persecution you do. At least, not blatantly.”
“It’s much better when they struggle, though,” Lilith says, the others nodding along in approval. “Even when they say ‘no,’ you know that’s omega for ‘please, alpha, fuck me harder.’”
“Yes, alpha. Want it, fill me up,” he answers, his own hands now gripping hard onto Castiel’s shoulders for support.
Dean obliges instantly, watching dutifully as Castiel swallows down the strongest over-the-counter meds they have. The water tastes so good that he drinks the glass in a few gulps, and Dean refills the glass and sets it on the table again. Then he kneels back down and really goes to work. He retrieves a washcloth, wets it with soap and water, and begins washing the blood off Castiel’s cracked knuckles. It feels so soothing to be touched like this—warm and gentle and cleansing—tended to with such affection, that it makes Castiel’s eyelids feel heavy.
He fishes his key out of his pocket before letting Sam in. He watches as Sam drops his bags and stares at the clean and bright living space. His brother’s eyes rove over everything slowly, taking in the kitchenette and the living room and walking back toward the bedrooms.
“What’s got you all worked up? You know Ellen won’t actually care if we’re a few minutes late.” Dean rolls his eyes, grabbing his keys as they head out.
CB: Awww it kinda feels like we are at the end of our contract. Time to renew up, bestie! Does forever work for you?
“I do not have dep–dep…” He swallows around the lump of bagel traveling down his throat, coughs, and adds, “
“You’ve barely said two words since we got done with that call. Did…did something trigger you?” she asks in a low voice.
“That sounds more than reasonable to me, so long as you're home for dinnertime,” Cain agrees, and Dean notices the Dom has a deep, calming voice.
Castiel begins to buckle his wrists into the restraints before stepping away. Dean shivers a bit at the sudden loss of contact. He can’t believe he’s really trying this. A little voice in his head tells him he’s crazy, but the voice doesn’t know what it's talking about, ‘cause the rest of him is so
The shower did feel good, soothing his aching muscles even if the pressure wasn't great and the temperature wasn't as hot as he wanted it. To his humiliation, he had slick between his legs. Fucking Alpha growl. He toweled off and got dressed for the following day, jeans and all, before climbing into his sleeping bag that now sat on top of the pads Sam had given him. It was markedly better and he passed out the second his head hit the pillow.
But he can’t bring himself to remove his hand from Dean’s cheek, who leans into the touch, breathing heavily. “When will I see you?”
“I wasn’t…uh,” he grumbles, busying himself suddenly with reaching for the game instructions. “Which haunt are we doing, anyways?”
Cain shakes his head, smiling ruefully. “No offense, but I think that registry of yours is broken. No way that boy was a good fit for me.”
“What?” Dean asks incredulously. “No I’m not! Man, did you hear Charlie at dinner last night, invite me to go LARPing with her next weekend? I didn’t even make fun of her once!”
Castiel has no clue where all this flirting has come from, but these are things he’s been imagining himself saying to ‘67 for a long time. Dirty talking them both to completion twenty minutes ago has clearly broken down all the carefully crafted boundaries Cas spend months setting up.
“Can you send me Purgatory’s registry results for the last six years?” Marv had started sending in the registry results to Purgatory around then, so if there’s a discrepancy in the numbers, Castiel figures it’ll begin around there. “Be sure to send them to me, not Marv.”
Dean shoots up his hands, grinning. “Can’t help it. Even the game knows I’m a bad boy.” He gives Castiel an outlandish wink that should be absurd, but seeing as it’s
Castiel exhales, trying to keep the rage at a minimum so he doesn’t trigger Sam. He had sprayed his scent blockers this morning, of course, but he’s no doubt sweated most of them off during the fight.
“Charlie,” he whispers, pulling the beta aside during a commercial break, “did you ever figure out who sent me that photo? The one of Dean…?” He hates talking about, hates acknowledging the forced bite and the scar on Dean’s scent gland. But he has a feeling all the pieces are about to come together, and he needs this information.
Dean nods a second, taking in a deep breath. “H-he was a great soldier, and one of the… one of the finest men I ever knew.”
“Whaddya mean?” Dean grumbles, reaching for the whiskey and pouring himself another cup. Ellen and Jo exchange careful glances, as if they’re not quite sure how to word the question.
“Yeah, he has a black eye and sore hand, but he’s fine,” she replies, and the tone of her voice calms some of his nerves.
He feels like he should go crawl into a hole when Pam gives a long sigh on the other line. “Don’t turn this in on yourself, Dean, I mean it. You know we keep things confidential but if both parties choose to share their information, that is their decision. Give yourself some time, alright? I know for a fact how much he has enjoyed your scenes seeing as he immediately books a room for next time after every session. Take some advice from me—maybe if you let him in a little, he may feel more willing to do the same.”
Seeing Dean like this, being able to pleasure his omega in this way, it brings Castiel more gratification than he ever thought possible. It makes every difficult day, every nightmare, every secret worth it.
“I have yet to meet your brother, but based on what you have told me he is a very accepting, open-minded young man who loves you dearly. I know it can be hard to share this side of yourself with your family, but I will be with you every step of the way. If anyone treats you with anything less than respect they will answer to me.”
“I’m sure I could have some ordered for us,” Castiel says dryly. He swats Dean’s ass playfully, kisses him one last time, then ushers him out of the room. Castiel shuts the door with a sigh, hoping that moment of intimacy will help him get through this evening. Jo’s muffled voice comes out from the other side of the door, and she snorts. “Nice shirt, Winchester… It’s on backwards, by the way.”
“No!” Dean says, a panic rising to his voice. He blinks, seeming to regroup, and says in a more even tone, “I mean, it’s okay. Believe me, I know you can’t help that shit. One time I went into such a bad heat, I was begging the mailman to bend me over and—” Dean pauses, cheeks flushed red. “Yeah, that story probably won’t help, will it?”
I promise I will write the next chapter ASAP, I know I am a monster with cliff hangers but maybe I am a lovable monsters?? <3 <3
“I’ll wait for you in the truck, Son,” he says, putting his hand on Dean’s neck and squeezing possessively. The gesture makes Castiel feel murderous, and he has to look away, coils of rage rippling through him.
“I’m sure you’ll more than make up for it with a ride in your car once it's roadworthy.” Castiel places a hand on Dean’s knee he only just noticed was bouncing. He stills and feels his cheeks heat a bit, telling himself to just suck it up and get through this. Cas adds, “It's okay to be nervous, you know.”
“Oh! Oh! Oh!” Sam starts flapping his hands at Dean, looking utterly ridiculous and trying to find his words.
“I um…I want to talk with you, believe me I want to, but I kinda gotta go take care of some things tonight.” Dean feels guilt crash on him like a wave.
“Yes,” Castiel says dismissively, slightly irritated at being disrupted, “please keep an eye out. It could be as soon as this afternoon. Or perhaps tomorrow morning.”
He tightens his grip again and Dean winces, though Castiel notices with some satisfaction that his eyes are flickering to his lips, his pupils slightly dilated. This man is certainly a submissive, though he’s clearly done everything possible to suppress and ignore his own biology.
Castiel releases a mirthless chuckle. “No, they’ve been gone for two days now. Charlie’s tracking them, of course, but they’ve scattered—Daytona, Seattle, Scranton.” He runs a hand over the armchair, focusing on the fabric. “At least one thing went right.”
“You still seem pleased, my pet,” he comments, undoing the straps and helping him out of the stirrups, stepping down off the table. “Go to the bed so I can relax you further.”
“You threatening me?!” John’s voice sounds a bit more strained, and he gasps as Castiel tightens his grip on his arm.
“They treating you alright at that place?” John asks, sounding calm. “I’m sure you're doing everything they tell you to.”
“Dean, do not interrupt me. You will wear your collar because you are my submissive and it makes me happy to see a symbol of that on you where others will see it too. Not only does it bring me pleasure, but it should help you to remember that you are my sub and have trusted me with your obedience and care.” Dean opens his mouth to object but Castiel holds up a finger to silence him. “Collars are perfectly normal submissive clothing, and a submissive is what you are, Dean. Hiding this from your family would be dishonest. You are a submissive and should be proud to be so. I am very proud of the submissive, and man, that you are.”
The house goes a whole new kind of quiet once Sam is gone. The kind of quiet that makes Dean’s skin itch.

“You can’t take our house!” Dean’s eyes go wide in shock, and he looks at his dad, praying he’ll see denial there. Instead, his dad just stares at his shoes.
“Please, Master…” The man is bordering on incoherence and Castiel has barely even touched him. What a stunning submissive—truly a gift.
Pam and Gabriel exchange a look of pity, and on another day that might’ve made Castiel feel aggravated. But he can’t seem to muster the energy right now—not when he has a pounding headache and he’s emotionally and physically exhausted and he just wants to hold Dean one more time.
“I’ll look and see what parts I can get ordered for you, though I think I have a good amount out in the yard.” Bobby scratches his head, obviously mulling over the project.
Dean gasps at the filthy possessive words, and while his body screams with flight responses telling him to run and fight, his submissive brain is cheering with lust and joy. There’s a snarl sound and Castiel is pushing his legs apart, and oh god, he really is going to fuck him right here on the floor of the goddamn lobby.
CB: Cause I’m psychic like that, just call me Pam. Also we’re basically the same person at this point
He shivers as the gloved hand moves down his chest and circles his left nipple before giving it a testing squeeze. He gasps at the sensation, feeling his cock twitch in response. He’d been so distracted he’d hardly noticed his semi was well on its way to fully hard. “Hmm, interesting,” his dom hums to himself as he moves to pinch and roll his other hard nub between his fingers. Dean pulls in a shaky breath feeling the muscle in his stomach tighten as the pleasure-pain sensation runs through him. “Very responsive to nipple stimulation,” he adds, moving to make a note on his clipboard. “Can become erect without direct genital stimulation.”
His mouth moves from Castiel’s lips to nibble at his ear, before they trace and kiss down the long beautiful column of his neck. He finds his mate’s scent gland right where his neck meets his shoulder, and he sucks and licks over it, enjoying the harsh, indecipherable cry of his mate. Castiel’s hips begin fucking up into him, and with one hard thrust, Dean feels the knot locking into place…his body spasming around the large intrusion.
“Very good. Thank you, Dean,” he replies, finally taking a seat. “Alright, let me just see which trainers we have available. We took on several new clients last week and we are near capacity.” Victor clicks around on his computer, squinting and frowning, seeming frustrated. He eyes Dean a few times before he picks up his phone and hits a speed dial.
But now that he's had a taste of being with the most amazing Dom he’s ever met, he wants it. He wants Castiel. Being with him in Sioux Falls at his home and seeing him with his family and friends, fitting in so seamlessly, how could he not want to keep that? Castiel fills every need he has, most of which he never even realized he was lacking. Castiel makes him feel confident, bold, brave, and important. It's the exact opposite of how he felt with his one weekend Doms.
“So, what brings you in today, Dean?” Tessa grabs a rolling stool and sits in front of him. He’s thankful she isn’t just staring at a clipboard.
His phone buzzes in his hand, and he sees yet another text message from his dad. Since Sam moved in John has sent the occasional drunk text to Dean. Usually some rant about how he “better be taking care of his brother” or how he “thinks Sam should come home.” Sometimes he can tell John is real drunk when he starts threatening Dean, telling him he better not fuck things up with Novak. He grinds his teeth a bit, opening the message and reluctantly reading.
seen you not stand up for yourself in any capacity. When Alastair attacked you, you fought him with all you had—even though you were bound and at a disadvantage. You stood up to Cain, who was your Dominant at the time, and you never gave up in that facility. You always kept fighting to survive. You are the strongest fighter I have ever met.” When Dean doesn’t answer, Castiel takes a deep breath and adds, “Let me ask you something. When you were in that facility and that piece of garbage hit you…did you want him to do that?”
“Naughty pet wants a good punishment, don’t you? Want me to turn this round plump ass of yours bright red? Bet you’d come all over your pretty red panties wouldn’t you? So hot for it.” He
“There’s no timeline on this shit, alright?” Dean scowls. It's been six months since he’s gotten home from his last tour in Afghanistan. Honorable discharge when injured in the line of duty is never how he intended to end his military career. But how often do things ever turn out how he expects them to?
He isn’t sure how far they drive before the truck comes to a stop and Cain is opening the back tailgate. He twists to look and sees the sign,
“Shhhit,” Dean breathes unsteadily. “Well, this is more of a request than a question. But since you probably won’t kiss me for a while, as a dog’n’all, will you—will you kiss me?”
“You could use the registry results,” Sam suggests, practically picking the idea right from Castiel’s brain. “Dean signed the contract under false pretenses, right? Thinking Cain was his perfect match? That should be enough to invalidate the contract.”
Bobby just nods and flashes him a sympathetic look that Dean hates. “Why don’t you take Sam out back and do some shooting practice?” Bobby stands and slams down two pistols, then tosses the magazines at him, which he just barely catches.
"Tempting offer, handsome, but I gotta get up early, and plus, I wouldn't want to put that new bed to waste, would I?"
Billie eyes them from the reception desk as they come in, a brow raised. “Well, you two forget to tell me something?”
He feels another pang of regret that he can’t dominate Dean himself, but he brushes it aside, suppressing his feelings. It’s a familiar act for him—it’s never mattered how he
Considering the man has been wearing a cock cage for a week, Cas expects him to most want to receive oral rather than give it. Which is why it surprises him when his sub bawls, “Your cock! Please Master, give me your cock.”
For the first time all day, some of the tension leaves Dean’s shoulders. “Yeah, uh…okay. Where’d you park her?”
“That's me,” Dean answers, standing up and tossing the beaten up magazine he was holding onto the side table.
Castiel beams a little, whispers, “Come here,” and Dean stands to his feet. He straddles Castiel’s lap carefully, hands wrapped around the back of Cas’ neck.
“Mmmm, fuck, feels full sir.” He arches his back, clenching down on the plug that's stuffing his hole. Breathing deep, his body strains against the leather. Right as his body goes limp into the straps he feels Castiel hit a little switch, and the plug begins to vibrate, low and steady. He can’t help but groan and rock in his restraints. Thighs shaking, he gasps for breath.
So you all met Jimmy, I have never written him before but always wanted too. Obviously he is not like Jimmy Novak in the show (a character we don't know terribly well) so I took liberties creating his personality, I went for light hearted teasing, but overall supportive. Hope you like him :)
Castiel shucked off his coats and rolled up his sleeves as his phone buzzed. He sighed as he lifted it to his ear. "Hello Jimmy."
“Couldn’t have found something a bit more, uh, manly for me to wear?” he grumbles, still standing, then adds, “Sir.”
“Sorry I’ll just bang a U-ey up here,” he mumbles, finding a spot to do a u-turn and head back to Ellen’s house. He can feel Sam’s eyes on him, but for some reason he doesn’t press the issue about what has him so distracted. They pull up to Harvelle’s and drive around to the house in back. Both the roadhouse and Ellen’s house look just the same as they always have. The old bar and restaurant, with its tough brown siding and tinted windows, are a stark contrast to the bright white ranch home that sits back along the drive. Regardless, both places feel like home to Dean.
“There, there now little omega, don’t worry. Your alpha is here,” Roman’s shark-like voice cooes in his ear, a tongue licking over the wound. Hands rub gently at his shoulder in a mockery of comfort. There’s a snapping sound of a phone camera but it barely registers.
“Hmm, sweet boy, it’s been too long since I’ve seen you come,” Castiel confesses, wrapping his hand around Dean’s dick and stroking. Dean’s eyes close as he shudders, leaning into Castiel’s touch. “Should I suck your cock tonight, as a special treat for being so good and keeping your cock cage on without complaint?”
“You know we can wait to start that treatment till you're ready, Dean. This moves at your speed and no one else's.” The doctor leans back and gives him that look that says he sees right through him.
“Such a polite patient,” Castiel comments, his tone pleased, leaning closer to get a better look at his finger entering and exiting. “Your Master must be very happy with you.” He pauses for more lube and adds a second finger, and the man moans low in his throat.
“Not exactly how you keep things discreet, Cas,” Dean whispers lowly, though Castiel knows he’s likely alone at his desk, with no one to eavesdrop. “But maybe someday.”
“Thank you,” Castiel whispers lightly to him and he wants to melt into that firm touch. He can do this for Cas. He thinks there isn’t much he wouldn’t do for Cas.
Dean carefully slips out of bed without waking Cas, taking a few deep breaths. What if his dad heard him beg his Dom? Shit—he’s gonna think Dean's some weak, pathetic submissive. What kind of person enjoys getting slapped after they just got the shit kicked out of them? A horny little cockslut, and that's why he’s been so much trouble. Is he
“Alright, well let's get this tarp off and see how she's doing under there.” Bobby nudges Dean's shoulder and he blinks a little before he moves to pull the cover off. Gleaming black metal greets him and he lets out a shaky breath at the sight of her. His beautiful 1967 Chevy Impala hardtop powered by a 502-cubic-inch big-block, sitting on a Hotchkis performance suspension. Even slightly crumpled and with broken glass he can see the car she used to be.
“Enough, Walker,” Victor hisses, and that does make Dean feel a little better. “Just take a few deep breaths. Okay, Dean?” Victor tells him, and Dean manages to nod and tries to take the advice, but it's a struggle.
He checks his phone and sees a text from Sam—apparently he took the trash out on his way to school and Dad never came home. The guilt twists Dean’s stomach over his good night's sleep. He wishes Sam could stay here with him. The high-speed wifi, the gym, the comfortable bed, a room of his own. Sam deserves that kind of stuff. He’s not making much of anything working for Novak, though he is getting free room and board and working off the debt. He thinks he can send home all of his paycheck right to Sam though, since he really won’t need much of anything here. Maybe he can get Sam a new mattress for his birthday.
It’s rounding on lunch time and he's almost finished with his shift when he reaches the tenth floor. He hates this floor, the executives. Some of them are polite, but some of them, like Zachariah, are grade A assholes. The second the elevator opens and he pushes the cart onto the floor, the balding, older man steps in front of him.
Castiel laughs, the sound airy and light. “The toast I made myself, actually. It’s a favorite snack of mine before playtime.”
"Can't afford to be picky, the Fist isn't. I'm eighteen myself, or have you forgotten that? Come on, Sam, I'll introduce you around." She grabbed Sam's coat sleeve and dragged him down a narrow hallway that opened up to what looked like a makeshift command center. There were wires and extension cords everywhere, and old computer monitors lined up on folding tables. This was what Sam had been waiting for - a chance to do some good, a chance to find Dean. He needed the rebellion’s help to find his brother, so he was making it his mission to make the rebellion need him.
“Well, if you know anyone interested in a farm hand position…” The woman taps the paper, giving him a nod and heading back toward the drive. He glances over at the sheet.
He’s a jittery mess the whole way there. He texts Cas to call him ASAP, not wanting the first time he says the big four letter word to be in a text. He doesn’t hear back but the message isn’t read yet. This was really dumb, like epicly dumb. Charlie flies through traffic, making scary good time. They pull up to the curb for departures at terminal C. Charlie does a little sleuthing to figure out what flight he was likely on.
They talk for a few more minutes before separating to go get changed. Castiel feels a sliver of anxiety leaving Purgatory without Dean, even for a few hours, but he knows Dean is capable of taking care of himself. Plus, he’s warmed up to some of the other Doms in the facility lately, especially since Benny joined them during puppy play. If there are any issues with Dean while he’s gone, he knows some of the other Doms are willing to intercede.
"Yeah, I'm Dean. Nice to meet you." He thought he should offer the guy a hand, but that would mean getting up in his personal space and Dean knew that sure as hell wasn't an option. He drew in a deep breath through his nose, seeking out the scent of this man when he was met with ozone, and fresh cut grass and ... ALPHA. He instinctively sunk in on himself, the fear rolling his stomach into a knot.
“Nah, it’s already done. Eat up.” She smiles, patting him on the cheek and moving some dishes to the sink.
Castiel sighs. He feels his phone vibrating in his pocket, but ignores it, figuring it’s just the text chain at work. “I’m sorry, Gabriel, but this is a big night for us. We’ve barely had any time alone to talk.”
“It’s fixable, but it's gonna take a while to find all the parts,” Bobby says, breaking the silence as he peers in at the car.
Ellen clicks her tongue disapprovingly. “I know we haven’t known those boys long, but to think of where they’ve come from, what they’ve had to deal with…”
“Yes Sir, please Sir,” he begs, and he’s barely been touched yet. Ten times—he can do that. Edging can’t be that hard…he’s had his orgasm ruined before. He’ll be good for his Dom.
“You didn’t, because I’m not asking, I’m telling, so you guys better go shower,” she nods toward the house as she starts dumping grain buckets. “Sam can help me finish up here,” she adds as Castiel and Dean stare at each other. He can’t tell if Cas is okay with this but then again Cas is likely wondering the same thing.
“Figure you can whip him into shape.” Castiel smirks a little and Dean feels heat creep up his neck.
Castiel snorts. He hadn’t been stroking himself at the moment, but he’s tempted to start back up just to spite him.
I struggled so hard to get this chapter posted tonight. Lost my first attempt after 30 mins of editing and clean up, tried not to cry, failed, whined to my fan fic friends, put on my big girl pants and tried again. Topping it off with a cracked cellphone screen today and my computer froze mid edit and needed a reboot, its a miracle this is posting tonight. I bring this too you with love, now I am gonna go cuddle my pets and try not to break anything else.
“Yeah, okay. Maybe we can watch a movie or something. I can bring home steaks?” Sam smiles at him, genuinely hopeful.
“Panties were a nice touch.” Dean wiggles his brows as he saunters past him. “Ouch!” he yipes as Castiel gives his ass a passing smack.
“Mostly just gave Sammy the creeps. Called him pretty, asked him a bunch of questions…” Dean bites his lower lip harshly, tipping his head back as he thinks. “Maybe I’m overreacting, but after some of the shit he’s said to me and about me, I don’t want him anywhere near Sammy.”
“Knot me, please, knot me, alpha!” Dean cries out, and with a loud growl Castiel slams into him one more time before locking them together, hitting just the right spot so Dean is spilling all over the floor and desk. A warm sensation runs through him as Castiel pumps him full. He feels like he loses some sense of time as he floats on his orgasmic high.
“But that’s laying off two hundred people,” Dean interjects, because apparently he can’t control his mouth today.
They all continue chatting and bantering until the adults have been poured generous glasses of red wine. A moment later, Jo heads for the kitchen and returns with Ellen in tow, family-sized bowls of an impressively tossed salad arranged on a tray. The Harvelles sit down after Castiel’s urging that everyone can serve themselves just fine. As Castiel digs into his salad, he can’t remember the last time he was served dinner at the dining room. He’s taken to sneaking meals at odd times in the kitchen, usually so absorbed with his work that his stomach gets ignored. Friday nights are generally his most lonely—much of the staff takes off on weekend evenings, having significantly better things to do than keep a grumpy, workaholic alpha company. But this Friday, quite miraculously, nearly everyone was still milling around inside the manor when he decides to have a proper dinner for Sam. He’s not sure why he decided to do this—it’s a bit out of character for him—but something about Sam’s frantic arrival and black eye makes Castiel wonder if the young man is in trouble.
“I don’t know what kind of game you’re playing here, but I want nothing to do with it. I’m taking my dad and we’re leaving.” He stares the man square in the eye. Something dark and dangerous passes over Roman’s calm, cool exterior before his smile snaps back into place. Dean hears a small snort and glances over at the other man, still seated at the table. Blue eyes watch him, obviously amused by something.
“Yeah? That sounds really cool, Sammy.” Dean smiles, thinking it sounds boring as hell but that it's perfect for his dorky little brother.
“S’great,” Castiel agrees, taking another bite of his salad and wishing he had ordered something a bit more substantial to soak up all the alcohol in his system. He’s just drunk enough not to care about the impending hangover, though, so he happily takes another bite.
“When you’re ready to talk, you’ll tell me?” Castiel asks hesitantly, knowing he sounds pathetic but he can’t find it in himself to care. He feels revitalized for the first time in days and he doesn’t want to lose this feeling.
“No,” Castiel answers impatiently, remembering now why he can only handle his brother in small doses. “And you constantly trying to get me to ‘rebel’ with you is just irksome, Gabriel, so can we please discuss something else?”
Once the salad is halfway demolished, they transition to the toast. Dean eats it heartily, licking all traces of honey and peanut butter off of Castiel’s fingertips.
Hearing that one word gives Castiel a sense of exhilaration. Maybe he can still give Dean what he needs… Though, that certainly won’t be baked beans, since they’re burnt to the bottom of the pot by the time Castiel remembers them on the stovetop.
The other has Horse trainer Dean who runs a farm with Sam helping get wayward kids back on their feet and out of trouble, along with therapeutic riding. Castiel will show up with an injured niece Claire looking for help to get her back on the right track. I think it will be a really sweet fic and I can use my knowledge as a horse owner on this one.
“I dunno…” He sighs, biting his lip. “I’m bored…I’m tired. I hate being stuck inside with nothing to do. Sam keeps looking at me like I’m a wounded puppy, and you’re walking on eggshells around me, and Bobby hasn’t called me an ‘idjit’ all week. Even my dad is acting like he gives a shit, which means I’m really fucking broken, right?”
On Tuesday evening, once Dean has finished his homework, Castiel brews them an extra strong pot of coffee—he knows by now how much Dean likes to taste the bitter notes of the Columbian roast—and they sit at the table. Dean sips at his coffee awkwardly, clutching the mug as if it’s a lifeline.
