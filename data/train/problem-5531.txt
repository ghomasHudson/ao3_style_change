“You know, I spent two whole months in jail back when I was fourteen,” something flickered inside Loki’s eyes. “Rehab sucks, but at least your doing it for yourself.”
Meanwhile, the new tenant isn’t so bad. Steve doesn’t shut himself in his room 24/7, but he does spend a lot of time
Make friends? Open up? Socialize? She’s not so sure, all she knew was she was about to do something.
Loki glared at him. “Do you even know why he’s here? Why he’s alone in this godforsaken place? Why father wouldn’t even answer any of his calls?” Bruce just stared as the wind suddenly picked up. “Of course not, all you see is some puppy you shouldn’t kick!”
It took three more minutes, maybe even more, before Bruce found the strength to continue with his morning routine. Not thinking, and not ignoring—absolutely not ignoring—the reason behind Natasha’s actions. Of course, he doesn’t think that it’s not a good thing, it’s just that he also believes that it could be a bad thing.
Thor found himself a little angsty, which was new and he had concluded that it is a very uncomfortable feeling, he doesn’t like it. He left Loki another message that morning, which wasn’t answered until now (nothing new), telling him about his newest task. But even with the absence of his brother’s voice at the other end of the line, he could hear him laughing at him.
. He should be pissed, he should be angry, but honestly, Clint wasn’t, and in fact, he couldn’t really feel anything. As if a part of him knew they were bound to find out about it.
The kid glared at the blond in front of him, his eyes narrowed, “I didn’t ask for your inconsequential opinion.”
Yeah, yeah. I know most of the writers here have jobs and they're still able to update weekly. And honestly, I can't really give you an excuse. It's just that, I write really, really slow. In a day, I'll only be able to write for an hour, which usually ends up consisting one paragraph, before giving up and deciding to continue it tomorrow.
Tony made a beeline towards the fridge and pulled out his now empty milk carton. He gave it a little jiggle before cursing, “It already has a fucking name on it dammit” before throwing it in the trash bin.
“I’m new here and I have no idea what is it that I should do,” Thor immediately said before losing his chance, Clint immediately shut his mouth, his jaw clicking. “I tried everything and until now I have not been able to converse with anyone,” he paused. “Except for one, but she was the one to reach out, not me. I don’t know this place and I just really want to fit in.”
Bruce rummaged through the cabinets, aware of the voices from the living room, and of Natasha’s presence near him. As soon as he found the water boiler Tony had bought a few days ago, he straightened up and proceeded to fill it with water.
Steve twisted from his seat and stared at his professor. A streak of yellow paint was on his left cheek, a few splotches of red, violet, and blue above his left eye and his hands were a mess of colors. For once, Steve wasn’t having a hard time painting something new, and he didn’t know whether to feel bad or not about that small fact.
Both heads snapped up towards the entrance to see a tall well-built blonde male standing by the doorway, holding what could possibly be the heaviest looking box Bruce saw in his entire life. Strangely, something about this guy just screams ‘All Hail America’.
Natasha stared at the notes taped on the fridge then glanced down at the note she made, debating if she should tape it or not.
He hasn’t had the chance to apologize to Tony about the incident that morning after the first time they all spent together in front of the television, and he realized that this movie night he’ll finally have the chance. It wasn’t like he wasn’t trying for the past week, the guy wasn’t that hard to find considering that their schedule seems to overlap all the time, but Steve knew when a person is trying to avoid him.
Peggy sighed. “You have got to stop doing that,” she said. “You know, I don’t get you sometimes, you’re not that awkward bloke that keeps to himself every class and tries to act small when it’s physically impossible,” She gestured at Steve and his massive frame. “Try reaching for other people, and not wait for them to reach for you—like what I did—and maybe you’ll find out that you’re not awkward,” she said. “or friendless,” she added.
Jane fought of the embarrassment growing in her stomach, she’s talking to Thor for heaven’s sake. Of course, he didn’t mean it like that. She really needs to stop assuming.
“I guess you should remove Ghost Busters out of your speed dial,” Bruce told Tony while continuing to sip from his tea.
“Yeah, sure,” Tony shrugged, the guy may not know he’s a Stark and probably owns at least one gadget with his name on it, he might as well just take the offer. “Help me move this big one then.”
“No, you listen.” He dropped the pen he was holding and leaned back on his seat. “I’m not good with people, I’m good with faking it in front of people, but other than that, none.”
Steve would give nervous glances every now and then, Tony for his part looks really uninterested, Clint was the only one the kid would talk to—in all honestly talking wouldn’t even be the word to describe the how they communicate—Bruce was never really good with reading people, therefore he doesn’t really know where Natasha stands. But everyone never asked, never spoke anything with why Loki was even staying with them.
After successfully putting Bruce under the sink, Natasha immediately pulled out a handcuff and locked Bruce’s right hand on a metal pipe under the sink. Both Steve and Thor let go of Bruce and watched him trash on the floor, trying to free himself while he pulls on his wrist until it turns red.
The young man’s face scrunched. Giving your car, or any robots—especially robots, a gender is acceptable. A building, not so much, to him that’s just borderline weird.
But that night, Tony had successfully made the deaf wide awake with his racket. He was making such a commotion, Clint’s whole room was vibrating. And since he had never actually shown himself to anyone, (except for Bruce who he didn’t notice standing in the kitchen staring at him one morning, then again he was bound to slip at least ones) he decided to keep it that way, for now. Even if the urge to bang on Tony’s door was so strong it could rival the Hulk.
“She’s something else, isn’t she?” The owner said, a man in his late 40s who only acquired the building because the original owner—which was a relative he wasn’t even aware off, died way too early.
He wasn’t that much of an asshole when he was a kid, right? Barney maybe, but he was pretty sure he didn’t reach this level. Or maybe they both did but they didn’t notice.
He glanced at the wall clock Tony had placed near the stairs and stared: it was too early for any class to start.
Out of them, Tony and Clint were the hardest to read. And it’s not like she was even trying to read everyone, it was just one of the things she does automatically. She doesn’t understand the fact that Clint was trying so hard, he doesn’t seem so interested in the first few weeks. The sudden fixation threw her off.
The guy continued to glare at Clint before moving his eyes to glare somewhere else with a scoff that sounded so much like “insufferable human beings.”
Bruce didn’t hesitate, with his injured hand, he punched the kid straight on the face. With his lanky body, Loki instantly fell down on the ground, clutching the middle of his face and eyes glaring murderously at the college student.
He grabbed him by the arm and turned the other guy to face him. Tony stared at him with both of his eyebrows raised as Clint pointed at the box and said, “Why?”
It was simple, the painting was basically screaming what it means. And yet Steve stared dumbly at it.
But as soon as the Heir of Stark company started placing food with his name on the fridge, Natasha instantly knew it’ll be a thing around here.
He glanced at Loki, the kid, and at Thor, then decided to keep quiet about the fact that they look nothing alike. But gazing on the look the others were sporting, he knew he’s missing something. Is there something they knew that he doesn’t?
Anything but fathers, unless it’s not obvious, he’s not really that interested with anything related with the word father, or dad, heck throw in Papa as well. His record and the broken furniture in the building says it all.
She hadn’t expected for it to stick though. Mainly because she expected the other tenants to use the place as a place to sleep, not to actually consider it as a home. That’s how she considers it. Her schedule consists of sleeping and taking a bath there, and the other remaining errands were always done outside.
“If your reason to leave is just because you’re not normal, then I’m gonna start packing my bags,” Clint explained in a shrug, Steve only stared at him, he didn’t have enough time to grasp the situation when Tony spoke.
She stared at him, her eyebrows furrowed but she was smiling as if she was looking at him like he’s an interesting species. “You know, I thought you weren’t capable of smiling, with that look that you have moments ago,” she said shrugging as she turned straight ahead. “For a moment, I thought you were planning to get hit by a truck or an RV or something,” she paused. “Then get tasered by one of the people riding it.”
He was too busy being embarrassed at the fact that everyone knew he used to be a thief that he forgot how Bruce would feel. The guy just broke a door.
Either he’s losing his ‘early-bird’ thing going on, or the people in that building decided that sleeping isn’t necessary when you can win over Steve’s cooking.
“Ooookay…” He muttered finally breaking eye contact as he closed the fridge. “Not the talking type, I could live with that,” he added heading straight towards the bathroom.
He considered texting the others whether they were lucky enough to find Loki, but at the same moment his phone pinged. Pulling it out of his pocket, he stared at the text Clint sent on the group text (“Add Tony” Steve said from his spot as he ties his shoes. “He’s a jerk, but let’s not leave him out.”) and sighed again.
Biting his lower lip, Tony closed his bedroom door and grabbed the first pair of clean clothes he laid his eyes on.
“Were you faking it?” Bruce found himself slightly shaking his head and Thor beamed. “Well then, I should leave you to your doings.”
Thor liked to think that he did pretty well with his interaction with Steve. He didn’t act too interested right? He followed Jane’s tips positively accurate. Now if he could only find a way to communicate the other four tenants, he did try though, asking what this ‘Shit-List’ is that Tony was talking about.
Steve looked away and stared at his work as he felt his face turn red. It still wasn’t enough, but when everyone keeps remembering your works, he guessed the professor’s bound to know him at some point.
With as much strength a half awake person could muster, he swung the book and hit the stranger square on the head.
Jane did her best to hide her smile at the big Golden Retriever in front of her. “Hm, first is you need to act like seeing him or her—okay, them—doesn’t bother you
He also creates his own nest, a nest of dirty clothes and piles of junk in his room. Not that he’s a couch potato or anything, but to him, having a clean room doesn’t feel like you own it, having it muddled up shows that it's yours.
Steve basically lost the plot by this part, when did Thor became a subject of the conversation? Apparently just now. “Uhh what?”
Ignoring the pain from his head, Clint bolted down the stairs. Hearing aids cost a fortune, especially Stark hearing aids, he can’t handle losing one. He could barely sustain himself with his lousy part-time job. Even though he wanted to give up so bad at some point, he just can’t. Going back there, to that kind of life, he can’t do that anymore.
“You said so yourself, this is a punishment, so do something about it. You never know, this punishment could be your second chance.”
So, remember the time where I mentioned that I'll be posting twice a month, turns out it actually meant I'll be posting twice a month at most. But you did notice that I try to update monthly, I try not to leave a month unattended, except maybe for the month of November.
Jane fought off the relieved smile finding its way up her mouth, she had realized that this particular advice was too straightforward when they haven’t even done any normal conversations. Thank god it didn’t work.
) before looking back at Thor. “She doesn’t like nicknames,” he supplied as the others greeted her, Bruce with a sheepish wave and Steve with simple “hey.” Tony seemed to be more interested at glaring at the DVD player.
“Why are you so against Hammer Tech?” Bruce asked, closing his book. “It’s the second leading brand in technology right?”
panicking. He was pacing back and forth, cursing at his phone whenever the line was cut off. Steve entered the building in a panting mess, the bigger blond looked at him as if to ask
“Scared of a little underwear are we?” Tony teased. “Don’t worry, you might be an endangered species at this day of age, but I’m pretty sure cohabiting with one isn’t so hard.”
Steve blinked, which he realized he has been doing a lot lately, and turned to look at Peggy before looking back at his painting.
“Mind giving me the rules around here?” He asked glancing around. “I don’t actually have enough experience living with a lot of people”
“Oh, right, magic word,” Tony said when Steve had obviously failed to comply him. “Steve, would you please open the door and see who’s the asshole at the other side?”
Tony shrugged and reached for his. “I’ll pay for Cap’s part, considering that his memories can rival my dads’, who couldn’t remember that he left me at the park,” (Natasha noted that bit of information, even when it seemed like a joke) he said before turning to Steve, “You can pay me later.”
Tony glared at the stupid kettle as it took forever to boil water before glaring at the mug he was holding with the contents of the cheapest coffee mix his shameful allowance can buy.
After staying for almost a month with ghost-like companies and just a week of having Tony as a sign of any living organism—and Tony’s suspicious carton of milk that always seemed to be empty (
“Thor openly wants to reach out, unlike you guys who would still rather walk on eggshells.” She spoke as if giving a class presentation. “You should start with Thor, he’s more or less just like you.”
With a twist, the engine roared to life, “If having thirty-three messages and counting isn’t exaggeration, then I don’t know what is.” She replied while backing up the car and swiveling  a U-turn. “And besides, I’ll get new shoes out of this.”
“No, he keeps saying he never ran away from home,” Steve said as he folded the wrapper of the sandwich he had just finished and tucked it inside the pocket of his messenger bag.
Bruce’s frown went back to his face, “But seriously, do you really talk like that? It’s the 21st century.”
Being a thief himself—well, a retired one—getting robbed was embarrassing, especially getting robbed by a kid. He was smart, Clint could give him that, he got himself free food for at least a few days, then once his cover was blown, he could run away with the victim’s wallet. He was a good liar, excellent maybe, making him wonder if all the things the kid said were lies.
“Are we getting on with the tour or not?” The man asked instead, running a hand through his brunette hair.
notice, h also looked down at the boy’s feet, only to find it barefooted. He didn’t notice it before, due to the fact that the slacks was too long for the boy, but now he did. Clint groaned and rubbed his temples, he’s having a Thor episode again. “You know, you shouldn’t have ran away from home.”
Okay, he admits that he may have been a little bit rude, but Tony was even worse. Who even leaves their dirty underwear lying around for everyone to see? And he wasn’t a prude, not even close.
“No, I get it,” Steve said walking towards them. “Just that, I heard that a lot to last a lifetime.” He added setting down the box he was carrying on the dining table. “Are you two the only—"
His eyes roamed over the happy expression of the man eating the pasta as he blatantly ignores his surroundings.
Clint’s not stupid, he wants to prove that he’s just like everybody else. That even if he’s a freak of nature: raised in a circus, a brother who wouldn’t give a shit about him, a thief, and the fact that no one would be waiting for him anywhere, he still wants to prove that he’s like anybody else. He wants to leave his previous life, forget it rather, prove that he can reach so much more. Even when he’s well, not…
The young man turned sharply and raised a brow—he’s been doing that a lot now that he noticed. “What makes you think I’m taking the room?”
He pointed at the biggest box in the truck, it contained his bed, considering that the given bed in his room was pathetic. The man strolled beside Tony and visibly paled when he saw the size of the thing they were supposed to move.
It was odd, yet amusing, watching how each room slowly gets occupied by different people, and how each and every one of them had a weird way of arriving there. Except for the red-headed lady whose name he didn’t catch, he actually has no idea how or when she moved in, he just woke up one morning spotting her exit the bathroom.
boxers before registering the situation. “Hey, this is mine,” He said before grabbing it from Steve’s hold, then the situation registered even more.
It only started on Bruce, then Tony, then Steve, then the next thing he knew, he was secretly watching all of them wander around the building. He watched them create stories about him and the lady being a ghost, how Tony asked Bruce about his milk being empty again, how Steve always follows his inhuman schedule and how Thor, well, be Thor. Everything about the guy was already amusing.
Picking at the note, she stared at it for a very long period before folding it up and slipping it in one of her notebooks. Maybe showing this to her therapist could help and finally loosen up his lectures about her ‘tendencies to push people away’.
He couldn’t really say that he and Tony were in friendly terms, more like if-I-see-you-then-I-see-you-but-we-don’t-talk-like-we’re-friends kind of relationship. They barely see each other, but it was still something. Unlike the other two, who were starting to look like real ghosts, at least he could still see Tony.
Bruce’s plan on spending his whole weekend in bed was immediately put in flames when Steve called everyone to stay first before they could even retreat back to their rooms.
“Did you actually believe I’m like this due to my own accords?” Loki laughed ignoring Bruce, this time hysterical, and Bruce didn’t know what to do, he was never built for this kind of conversation. “He’s a self centered bastard who’s willing to leave me behind to frolic with people who hates me, a selfish person who couldn’t even see that he was leaving me behind when he promised that he’ll always be there! So don’t even go and express me he meant to do good!”
“Dude, stop that,” Clint groaned. “Did any of the information I said last night register inside your head? We’re—” then he just immediately stopped talking.
It was never supposed to get out, it was supposed to be a secret, but thanks to the news, tabloids, and the paparazzi, things turned for the worse. Howard called it a punishment, Tony called it a way to make it seem like he’s not his son.
Thor, bless the big guy, even though obviously not knowing the situation, jogged to grab his bag, living the poor boy outside holding the stack of pizzas.
Steve turned to glare at Tony. “Will you stop saying things before you even know them,” he retorted.
Then a distant memory of Loki watching in front of the TV with rapt attention resurfaced from his head, the view of being on top of the mountain was illuminated through the screen. Bruce found himself slowly backing out from the scene when he heard Loki say something about how beautiful the world looks and what would it feel for people to kneel before him.
Before the others could even reach them, Bruce heard Loki whisper so low he almost didn’t heard it. “He’s not even my brother.”
“Bruce calm down,” Steve said, grunting. Bruce’s bloody fist managed to hit him on the stomach, and Steve was starting to wonder where he takes his energy from this kind of body.
Tony raised his eyebrows at the action before decided to acknowledge the words instead. “Well, then he’s a lying liar who lies—”
My sister flat out rejected my calls for help with this chapter because she was also busy, school and with her story, you should check her out sometimes.
“Tony?” Steve asked. The number of times he had a conversation with Tony could be counted on one hand—two fingers actually. Though if the notes don’t count then he only had one. Steve realized it was pathetic.
Apparently the boy doesn’t have that much skills in keeping it together, he snapped immediately. “For the love of christ! I just want you to acquire me a hotdog, what’s so difficult with that?”
“Good,” he said. “We’re good.” Wanting to change the topic, his eyes landed on Bruce’s bag. “What’s with the bag? It’s a weekend.”
Bruce gave a small smile. “It’s okay,” he paused. “Just… tell me, anything, anything at all, if you feel weird living with me. I don’t want to be a...” He trailed.
Jane’s words made him realize what he didn’t manage to notice, and when the words registered in his head, he realized that it didn’t sit well on the bottom of his stomach. “I need more advice.” Thor said gloomily “I have not made any improvements these past few days.”
Thor immediately stilled, his cup of coffee (which suspiciously looks more like milk) a few inches away from his mouth. He was silent for a moment. “Not by blood, no,” he finally answered. “He’s the son of one our family’s rival, I am not aware of the entire story, but… nonetheless, he’s still my brother.”
Bruce didn’t have enough time to think what just happened, he himself being dragged out of his room by Natasha, holding his arm tightly just above his injury. He silently thanked that it was dark enough to cover his slowly reddening face.
“Calm down?” He yelled, “You want me to calm down?” which was ironic considering that his voice doesn’t seem to waver by the second, Bruce thought, “I left my brother alone once—”
“I was angry,” Bruce replied “I was angry when I killed him, I was angry just like earlier,” as if to say he could kill one of them if something like this happens again.
Thor thought for a moment, of course, he was interested to befriend people, was that what she meant? “You can say that I’m interested in a lot of people.”
Clint blinked, then looked down at the flowers shoved on his chest, then slowly looked up at Thor. “Are you high?” He asked.
Natasha was never a fan of showing emotions, but at the moment her eyebrows must have disappeared from her hairline already. Maybe she’s wrong again. Maybe Steve didn’t want to stay in his room tonight. But the previous events says otherwise.
Before the kid could do so much as kick him on the face, Thor crouched down beside them and yanked Loki away by the collar. Bruce took Clint’s hand as he helped him up, before proceeding to inspect his nose.
Clint frowned “Wow, imaginative,” he threw a wrapper at the kid. “Will you stop being a dick for a moment,” he said. “Or I swear that will be your last burger, ever.”
Not that he wasn’t expecting it, he knew the guy was bound to complain about it and it wasn’t that hard to figure out he was the culprit (The nameless lady doesn’t seem like the type to steal food—or to actually participate with anything), but that was just grade A skills with changing topics.
“Mother of—!” He exclaimed staggering back—almost loosing his balance— as both of his hands flew straight to his nose.
Natasha still likes to people watch, but she may be getting a little rusty with reading other people
“I like her,” Natasha whispered beside Bruce which made the hair at the back of his neck to stand up.
Jane laughed and gave him back his phone. “Of course not,” she said before gesturing back at the phone that was now currently on Thor’s hand. “I placed my number there, in case you want to talk sometime. I realized it was a little stupid that we didn’t exchange last time when you told me that we’ll see each other around. I’m guessing you also go to SHIELD?”
Natasha sighed and tried to focus on the film, on which she was rapidly losing interest, and not because the plot was uninteresting.
Bruce frowned, he wasn’t really expecting that the guy to still be in college, because he looks like his already in his mid-twenties. Then again, the owner did say that he was preferably taking in college students.
Thor paced back and forth in the Living room, a hand full of handpicked flowers in his hand. He really wants this time to work, he got a whack on the head for these flowers and he would really want to have a worthy outcome. His original plan was to buy some in that flower shop down the block, but he realized he had spent most of his money on Pop Tarts.
Steve sat up, if possible, more rigidly than before, looking alarmed. “That happened ones.” He defended.
It was an obvious reminder that he’s so far away from others, at some days he feels like it’s not a big deal, but most of the time he can’t help but feel like that. It was stupid, and Steve hates it. The only helpful thing that came out last night was the fact that he should never order Hawaiian Pizzas again.
Well, Thor gave Bruce the mug, but he guessed that Bruce grabbing it from his hand counted. “Yes,” he moaned. Everything doesn’t seem to work. “But I told you, he had left immediately.”
“D-don’t you think ‘bombarding’ is a bit, I don’t know…” Bruce said rubbing his nape, “Exaggerated?”
Honestly, the hearing aids incident hasn’t really crossed Thor’s mind since that morning. But mentioning that seemed like a bad idea. “Ah, yes?”
Edit: okay, technically I didn't edit the chapter, because no matter how hard I try and correct wrong grammars or add missing words, they don't seem to disappear. So pardon for my grammatical errors.
Steve found himself furrowing his eyebrows before looking around, looking for anything that could have soured the brunette’s mood. “Did I do something?”
Clint’s eyes were wide with shock, but Natasha wanted to kick him straight on his jewels when he couldn’t keep his mouth shut. “Tony, I think Bruce solved the peephole problem.”
Tony paused with whatever it that he was doing and stared at Bruce before clicking his tongue. “Before you go there, I’m gonna stop you right now and tell you to shut up,” he said.
“No there’s four of us, five, now that you’re here,” Tony replied while taking a huge bite from his toast. “A redhead lady and a guy named Clint."
It also didn’t help that she was the only one bothered, or that she was the only one recognizing him.
Grabbing a bottle of water, with a sticky note labelled ‘Steve’ in the front, Steve nodded at Bruce and padded his way up the stairs.
Natasha stared at her therapist, looking like she wasn’t going to answer the question anytime soon, and was visibly wanting to finish the session. But apparently, her therapist was already immune under her gaze as he continued to smile at her as if they were talking about the weather and not Natasha’s future plans for his funeral.
Bruce must have noticed his sudden change of reaction, because he visibly tried to tone down and started taking deep long breathes. He closed his eyes and rubbed his temple. “I’m just, bathroom… yeah, bathroom.” He dropped his bag, and proceeded to go to the bathroom.
Clint frantically waved at the small box he was holding, and Natasha may have squinted at the said box before finding herself smiling. This time, she knew she was smiling and she did nothing to stop herself.
They stayed like that, waiting for Bruce to calm down. But he never calmed down, in fact, they suddenly noticed that the small noises he was making were whimpers. Turning to look at him, they saw that Bruce was finally seated on the floor while his other bloody hand covers his face.
When it started to move, Bruce snapped up. Suddenly Tony’s claim of ghosts living in the building seemed pretty convincing now.
Telling how much of a shit he used to be was starting to sound like a stupid decision now that Clint was revisiting the memory of Bruce’s breakdown in his room.
It was funny how they all seem to come out when the other was there only a few minutes ago. How they were all so close to seeing each other, and yet not so much.
Peggy squinted at Steve’s work, leaned in a bit then patted Steve on the back. “I don’t think so,” she said, a playful smile ghosting her lips.
Pepper did mention that he tends to acquire hatred from people after a few seconds of talking. He wonders why.
Thor thought back to his lonely lunch hours, the always busy students, Loki’s unresponsive behavior, and finally, the unanswered notes. That got him thinking at the weird place he was living in and the strangers that reside with him.
As soon as Steve sat his butt down on the chair, Clint immediately fished out his phone.  Tony peered at it and instantly frowned. “Really? Even your—”
It’s not like he’s bored and looking for company, but it had been weird coming back only to see the place feeling empty and very unwelcoming. Most of the time Bruce spends his days in his room, unpacking or, when Tony finally moved in, asking him to keep his tinkering to a minimum.
Loki ended up staying with them and moving into Thor’s room while the other decided to claim the couch downstairs. Claiming that if Loki takes the couch, the door was literally a few feet away, and obviously Loki has tendencies of running away. And if no one would be left at the building, Thor would drag him along in his classes.
The next morning, after having another long jog, Steve entered the usual empty building that he currently lives in. No one was there as usual, to his dismay, even no matter how big the event that happened last night. It’s not like things will change between all of then in an instant. They’re not yet friends after all.
Clint jumped and had almost thrown a punch at the intruder when he realized that it was just Tony, hands raised as if to say he meant no harm.
Steve rolled his eyes—something people thought he couldn’t do or to act like a youth in general (“You’re a sixty-year-old man in a nineteen-year-old body” Bucky had once said), and went back to stare at his work. Only this time, he noticed what Peggy noticed.
“He awake?” Clint asked poking out his head from the doorway, Bruce had this short thought that for a moment, Clint was a bird. Natasha jerked her head to right, pointing at a very visible standing Bruce Banner beside her, “Ok good, bring him down stairs.” he said before disappearing.
He never found out why Loki wasn’t taking classes, or why he lived somewhere else than the building Thor was living in, but he promised not to ask questions and just finish this. Whatever this was.
“That’s the point, it’s how you see it, people doesn’t see the same thing as you do, so stop making assumptions to things you don’t even know,” Steve said as Bruce started to shrink from his seat.
Everyone glanced at each other, then all eyes ended up on Natasha. She raised one of her eyebrows threateningly. “What?” She asked.
Peggy snapped and pointed a finger at him. “See, even your childhood friend’s saying that. And you know I have other friends, right? Not that I don’t like hanging out with you, but—why are we stopping at the grocery store?”
Bruce said the fifth time Tony asked him about his milk carton), Bruce found himself quite giddy with the prospect of having another human being joining their…complex? Apartment? Dorm? Whatever.
Days passed, she realized she was currently living with two other males, one of which was actually decent at hiding (Read: decent). She caught him spying on her when she was exiting the bathroom on her first night. When she moved in, she wasn’t expecting for a third one to move in so quickly—or for anyone to move in earlier than her actually. Classes don’t start for a month, and yet here they are.
“Well that didn’t work,” Bruce muttered backing up as the stranger stood up, only to find that whoever this is was way bigger than Steve, and Steve was already huge.
Jane shrugged. “I don’t really know, but they say it works if you act like you’re not too desperate. Like, you know, talk to them, but make it quick and act like you’re just fine when you see them.”
“Or maybe coke?” The boy immediately tensed. “Mary Jane? Brown Tape? Was that right, they call Heroin Brown Tape, right?”
Everyone in the table looked at Bruce, and that’s when he realized that he was the one that spoke up. Clearing his throat awkwardly, Bruce took a bite from his bagel before looking back at them again. “I just want to eat,” he said.
Thor huffed out before shaking his head. “I am aware that he would not respond, I just thought if I try enough…” he sighed before turning back to Bruce with a smile. “But you should not even be worrying, it’s not as horrid as it seems. How’s you’re hand?”
Bruce blinked for a few moments, studying Clint. He was never gonna be that type of person, the one who could sympathize or read people, he’d rather just keep to himself actually. But looking at Clint, he could see the same look he used to always see in front of the mirror.
“No wonder the kid’s got issues,” Tony muttered, earning him a piercing glare from Steve. The shorter man only shrugged, as if trying to get a raise out of him. “Sooner or later he’s gonna have a relapse.”
“But you’re just a puny little kid,” Bruce stated crouching down in front of him. “And frankly I don’t care, it could be your fault, could be Thor’s, bottom line you need help. And I know, because I’ve been there.”
As much as possible, I'm trying to make the characters here as normal college students as possible. So don't get confused when their characteristics are somewhat inaccurate.
Natasha turned and stared at the big blonde guy standing at the bathroom door. She furrowed her eyebrows at him as she turned off the faucet and dried her hands on the towel hanging by the side.
Flipping through the pages, she realized there was no name or any form of ownership. Other than a few body sketches, she found the notebook boring and a waste of her interest. Not really caring, she threw it at the shelf in case anybody from the five was looking for it.
What Tony did next was not what he was expecting, he smirked and Bruce must have blinked too much to be even considered as a normal human reaction. “ Sorry Brucie bear, but I’m pretty normal myself.”
Clint isn’t really the quiet type, just like any other birds, he’s actually chirpy. But after living with a girl who you actually just saw ones, and it was morning in an ungodly hour, he found himself, well, quiet.
Bruce rubbed the back of his neck, seems like Tony’s not the only one with a habit. “I dunno, it’s just, I know they’re here, it’s just that I don’t see them a lot.”
“I’m Thor,” Bruce raised both of his eyebrows. Thor sighed. “I believe my parents were intoxicated when they named me and my brother.”
In the end, he didn’t back out, which was all Tony needed to know what kind of person he was. The guy's gonna get eaten alive out here.
Steve stumbled back, his right eye burning from the hit as he tasted blood, though he was pretty sure it wasn’t his blood. For a guy like Bruce, he could really pack a punch. Steve’ could vaguely hear Clint cursing from the background.
Bruce visibly gnawed at the inside of his cheek which led Tony to raise an eyebrow—he really needs to stop that habit. “I haven’t actually met the others yet.”
Glancing at the fridge behind him, Clint asked if he was going to look for something inside it, only he didn’t hear his own voice. His hands shot up to his ears and realized that he wasn’t wearing his aids. Which was funny because he should have noticed that while using the bathroom.
Bruce frowned, but she didn’t elaborate, instead she grabbed a plate and proceeded to fill it with cups of tea. But before leaving, she turned to Bruce, “Jane likes Thor, it’s pretty obvious.”
There was a moment of silence where everyone tried to decode what Pepper just said, then Clint started snickering from his seat.
Clint paused, his hands freezing from toying his earphones, and looked at the kid in front if him. “Nosy, aren’t you.” it wasn’t a question.
When he got back, even later than yesterday after having another row with the Archery club president—something about stop using the archery range as a hotel (“I slept there ones! And that was just today!”), he found the fridge with exactly four more notes.
Bruce stopped midway from turning on a corner and blinked—honestly, he’s been blinking way too much and it’s starting to worry him, and the fact that he’s worrying over things like blinking too much is another thing to worry about—before realizing that what he heard was Thor.
She was convinced she finally made her therapist confused because for once he wasn’t writing anything down, he was just waiting for her to say something.
Another wave of silence enveloped the room, and finally, Bruce wasn’t angry, nor sad, he was just back to being Bruce. Something in Natasha’s message gave them something, hope? Possibility? No one really knew.
“Hey Pep, how about a little hand? No Tony, I already found you a U-Haul. As if I can’t rent a freaking U-Haul for Christ sake! It’ll help you mature, she said. In what part of the universe will you mature in moving your—”
There was an awkward silence as the two of them fidgeted at their spot, Thor at the couch, and Clint standing looking like he would really want to be in his room. Which might actually be true.
Pepper and Rhodey were the only people who knew about his inability to apologize, or to accept apologies. So, when Tony bugged Pepper at ass o’clock to grab him a pair of hearing aids because he couldn’t really stomach going back at the moment, she didn’t ask why and what for. She did throw a fit, but it was for the sake of making it seem normal, before telling him to wait for her after his last class.
“Something good must’ve happened then,” The professor gestured at the painting and left before proceeding to check the other students.
And as stupid as it sounds, Bruce thinks that Tony’s a vampire, either that or Tony have a very strange sleep and eating pattern.
“I pick pockets for a living,” Clint nonchalantly informed all of them, earning all eyes on him. “Well no, I used to work in a circus for a living,” He corrected raising his index finger, as if reminiscing. “I only pick pockets for extra cash.”
It appears that another tenant had arrived, a guy named Thor—she had heard weirder names, the mountain of pop tart boxes taped with a note that says ‘THOR’ was an explanation enough that he wanted to include himself with such silly antics.
As if not hearing the question, Natasha closed the fridge an apple in hand before staring right at him, “I don’t have classes today,” She replied flatly, but the way her eyes stare at him tells differently, as if daring him to ask her for an honest answer. And Steve, well Steve would rather not ask because of two reasons 1.) Natasha looks like a person who would hit you in the most vulnerable parts (physically) and 2.) Steve is a person who would not want to be hit on his vulnerable parts.
She was never really good at giving advice, much less to a person interested in a polyamorous relationship. Plus, giving advice in a very public place is easier said than done, they should really start hanging out in a café or something.
Sure, he needs to take other classes that need brains—which he’s failing miserably at, but he can manage. There’s nothing he can’t manage apparently. And that’s exactly not a good thing.
“Whoa,” Clint said standing up, causing for the boy to take a step back. “That’s a bit of an attitude coming from a fourteen year old.”
He wasn’t an art major because he was stupid, he’s just lacking knowledge after everything that has happened. It may not look like it but Steve really did like art.
Thor turned and saw Clint standing by the door, obviously having just entered, who was looking at him. Well, he assumed it was Clint, given with the two purple hearing aids on each of his ears.
Anyway, I am here to inform you that I might be updating at least twice a month until the end of 2018. *dodges rotten fruit*
Bruce rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to—I thought you were a burglar,” he frowned then saw the mountain of boxes—though it was still a lot less than Tonys', sitting on the living room floor. “Are you the sixth tenant?” Bruce asked pointing at the stairs
It had been weeks since he last moved, and yet he was still unsuccessful. Still alone in Lunch, and still feeling left out in each conversation with the notes. He had always been positive, but now, he could feel a twang of frustration settling on the pit of his stomach.
“It’s okay,” he paused. “Just… tell me, anything, anything at all, if you feel weird living with me. I don’t want to be a...” Bruce trailed off, not really bothering to finish the sentence.
“There’s this movie night that we’re trying, the place where I stay, and I thought that snacks wouldn’t hurt.” He didn’t really ‘thought’ of it, he actually planned it.
Clint stared at their front door that was covered in duct tape to cover the hole Bruce created. He blinked at the drawn peephole on the gray surface of the duct tape and stared at the note taped next to it.
“He’s currently not in a great place, I know, ” she said as they both strolled out the shop. “The point is, if you don’t know me, then who would go shopping with you?” Peggy rambled, her hands flailing. “Let loose a little, try interacting with other people. You’re like an old man stuck in a younger body.”
Steve wondered, everyone already know this, why does she need to narrate it? And by the looks of everyone in this room, they all seem to have the same question.
Natasha noted that like Thor, Clint was trying to give this thing a go, whatever it is this thing is. Natasha bit on her apple, her expression still impassive.
“What’s going on?” The girl asked, and Clint couldn’t agree more. He was used with seeing Thor like a giant puppy or something, as far as  he knows, this Thor doesn’t even exist. “Thor, who is he?”
Sighing, Clint took all the taped notes, including his, and threw it on the trash bin. He grabbed his notebook inside his bag and ripped a page.
Unlike the previous night, sitting with the others to watch the film Clint borrowed was as awkward as ever. And Natasha found herself looking at four men that would rather touch each other with a five-foot pole than sit on the same couch. The ridiculous space between them was an obvious indication.
Taking a few calculating steps backward, Bruce cautiously grabbed a book from the shelf—none of it was his, leaving him to believe that Tony owned way too much, and slowly made his way towards the unidentified organism. Then again, it could probably be a cat burglar—not that that sounded better.
“More like, used your name as an expression.” Clint mumbled under his breath, but was left unheard by everyone.
There was a pause that made Bruce look up. Natasha was staring at him with this look he can’t read. “Not enough, apparently,” she said.
The door opened and Thor found himself staring at a lady with red hair. She stared back at him then at Clint and Tony who was just staring at the TV, not bothering to greet her.
Bruce was reading a book, and Steve was sitting stiffly on the middle of the coach who was failing miserably as he tried to relax. Thor was trying to start a conversation, which was also failing miserably. If she wasn’t there, Natasha would have never thought that they were able to spend a whole evening together.
“My first choice was lady Natasha, but I have not met her until now, and I have concluded that the flowers won’t stay pretty once I met her,” He said. “But you’re a lady, and I like you. So, do you like it?”
He knew it was stupid, and he never should have done it. But Thor just looked so much like a kicked golden retriever that he couldn’t force his stupid mushy self to ignore Thor's obvious hard work in getting to know them. It just reminded him of the days he was in the circus, where no one would take a kid seriously. Next thing he knew he was asking people about the next movie-thing-whatsoever, tracking each one of them to get physically involved unlike his brother, Barney, who he spent most of the time imagining back then, and having to actually buy a DVD player that fits his budget.
Thor smiled a sad smile. “Being sent to a different country, not allowed to call or keep in touch, is as bad being banished. It’s hard to know that they are there, and yet you can not do anything about it.” He turned to look down on his feet. “I felt alone, and suddenly I knew how Loki had felt.”
Steve shrugged. “I don’t know which brand is better. I mean they’re both cheap, but there’s cheap with good quality and cheap with awful qualities.”
Bruce paused, suddenly wondering if Clint’s having a small breakdown and realized that he wouldn’t want to be living with a freak of nature such as himself. Sure he admitted to being a thief back then, but he never killed anyone, and nothing’s really wrong with living with the circus. No one can really chose the situation that they’re born into.
Starting up a new day, Thor kept thinking about that sweet woman, Jane, wondering if he would see her again today.
“I swear to god I quit drugs months ago, ask Pepper,” was the words that instantly slipped out from Tony’s mouth, much to Bruce’s confusion.
“Does electricity exist in that house?” Peggy asked falling in step next to him. “How about internet connection? Or was the house situated at the top of a mountain because you could only be a hermit if you’ve never heard of this song.”
If he hadn’t stayed in the kitchen, Bruce wondered if he would have taken part in this funny interaction—well as much interaction as it would get. Even though he hadn’t seen them all together, seeing that there are actual people living in the building, Bruce found himself not feeling like he’s alone anymore.
Natasha watched Tony and Clint talk from her window, or as much as a conversation the two could possibly have as it appears that Clint wasn’t wearing his hearing aids—considering that Tony was using his phone.
“Hey, I volunteered making coffee so that I could skip a couple of minutes with you guys yapping about stuff,” Tony pointed out carrying a plate of mugs with coffee. It wasn’t the just the fact that Tony knew who owns which mug surprised Bruce, but also the fact that he actually knew what type of coffee the others would drink.
He’s not the only one feeling like that though, but that person’s not there, and it seems like he won’t be for a while. It wasn’t really his fault he feels like he’ll never catch up with everyone when he’s all alone. A part of him keeps telling him that he should try, but another part of him was telling him he couldn’t.
Everyone knew what he meant by that. Broken glasses were scattered across the floor, and if Bruce doesn’t seem to look like he’ll do suicide, self harm does.
She knew for a fact that Bruce never seems to drink coffee, just tea. Wherever he keeps his supply was his business. But now, Natasha’s staring at it. A small note with the name ‘Bruce’ was taped at the front and the lid had a label that says ‘tea’—probably because at first glance it looks like marijuana.
Natasha blinked at the small jar placed on the counter next to Thor’s ridiculous supply of pop tarts.
Tony found himself unable to say anything but a small “Huh.” He glanced around again, “you think they’re here? Should I put the Ghost Busters on speed dial?”
In the background, Tony snapped his head up and pointed a finger at Steve. “told you,” he mouthed in which the other guy gave him a look that practically says:
“I actually spent a few days with that asshole,” Clint supplied. “Before running away with my wallet.”
It was one of those moments where Thor wasn’t with them, hence the absence of Loki. Therefore, for some reasons Tony thought it’d be best to spend it gossiping, much to Steve’s chagrin. Tony claimed it was for Thor’s well-being, Bruce wanted to point out that his statement has a few (a lot) of holes in it, but decided against it.
Clint glared at him and Natasha fought down the urge to leave and proceed to her room, she had just concluded that the four walls of it were better company. “We’re watching a horror film, I ain’t going to answer the damn door. They usually die first.”
Steve watched as Tony unlocked Bruce. Steve watched as Clint called for a taxi to take Bruce at the hospital. Steve watched as Thor searches for the first aid kit. Steve watched as Natasha tries to cover Bruce’s bleeding hand. And Steve, Steve sat besides Bruce for comfort.
Bruce glanced around, noting that the pretty lady, who was apparently Thor’s friend, Jane, was sitting awkwardly at one of the stools, probably feeling more awkward than him. He couldn’t help but note that she was avoiding to make eye contact to everyone, but chose to examine her hands instead.
I promise, give this story a chance because I have never been this excited whenever I thought of a story.
Sighing, Bruce dropped his stuff on the bathroom sink and stared at his bandaged hands. The sad part was knowing that his episode last night wasn’t even one of his worsts, to put it lightly, it was one of his more tamed moments. It was his fault anyway, he never should have tried visiting his grave.
Sitting up, she made a mental note to buy a pair of earplugs—because apparently the guy still makes a racket even when class already started, and grabbed her slippers. Opening her door, she glared at Tony’s bedroom in front of her before throwing one of her sleepers at the closed door.
Steve peered down on the game, something he wasn’t familiar with, but it looked newly released because, well, he wasn’t familiar with it. “What’s wrong with it?” Steve asked. “You know, the game.”
At first, he thought his life couldn’t get any shittier after losing his sense of hearing, but he realized that maybe the accident was a blessing in disguise. For one, he could just leave the other guy, Bruce, to handle Tony and his racket. Also, it’s a good perk when he’s talking to a very annoying acquaintance from campus. All he needed to do was nod and smile and no one will know he wasn’t actually listening.
It was hard to forget that she wasn’t living in a world where she needs to sacrifice anything just to gain something. Every time she closed her eyes she felt as if she was back there again as if she never left.  Being awake was the only thing she could use to ignore it.
He rushed down the stairs and ran straight towards the bathroom, praying that no one was occupying the only toilet. He thanked the heavens when no one was—though a very, very (like, really) small part of him was hoping he’d bump into Natasha using the toilet. He’s a man, after all, it also doesn’t help that the first time he saw her was in the bathroom.
“Oh poor Thor, poor older brother of mine!” He yelled turning to the view of the city before standing up and taking a step away from the edge, turning to stare at Bruce. Well, at least he was away from the edge“Did he forget to mention the mayhem he caused last year? Where it went too far he had to go to court? God, he’s so full with himself, all I ever sought was an equal, and he just couldn’t turn his head to look. He’s the one with the problems, and yet I’m still the freak! I’m still the disappointment! So stop defending him!”
“I don’t read people,” Clint said. “I watch them, I got great eyesight, and you leeching on me was a bad move on your end.”
The last person he talked to was Natasha, that really weird girl—only girl—living with them, and it took him quite a while before he actually persuaded himself to thank her for finding his notebook. But whenever he’d look back at that short interaction, he couldn’t help but smother himself with his only pillow in his room.
“It’s you’re brilliant idea anyway, you open the door.” Clint said and Tony gave have a incredulous look.
“What exactly is this place?” The man asked. “Is this a dorm or something? Because I don’t think this is an apartment or a boarding house.”
The older man winced, “I honestly have no idea,” he said. “I just inherited this place, and no one wanted to buy it from me so I used it instead.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, remembering Bucky, “The last thing Bruce needs is being alone, especially after what he’d done to the mirror.”
There were a few seconds of silence before Tony found himself laughing. “Oh my god,” he managed in between laughs. “I’m living with a prude!”
When he left, she thought that was the last she’ll ever see of him, only to be surprised when he actually moved in. She spent the whole day frowning in her room, wondering why the sole heir of Stark Industries was even there.
It was either coincidence or the boy had the sixth sense or some other crazy thing the people seem to claim they have these days,  but either way the guy turned his head sharply and glared at Clint without so much as a pause from glaring at the hotdog stand. As if the he knows he was starring.
Anyway, I just turned a year older last... few weeks Hahahaha! I kinda hoped that'll mellow down the furry of my late update. I mean, birthdays, you should enjoy it before it becomes something you'll hate to even think about.
That moment, when Natasha saw the foods in the fridge with the name ‘Clint’ taped at the front of each, she only raised a brow and rolled her eyes.
Groaning, Bruce fumbled for a bit before finding the switch to turn on the lights. “Turning on the light’s would’ve woken me up better,” he muttered yawning.
“I can’t acquire my own,” the boy retorted back, as if Clint not buying him the hotdog doesn’t make any sense.
Tony opened his mouth only bite his tongue, he had almost mentioned his mother, which was the last thing he needs at the moment.
Maybe he was trying to pay Tony back, but in a weird twisted way where he tries to recreate this amazing thing that asshole did to him— that amazing thing being his hearing aids— and tries to do it to someone else. That someone else being Thor, and this runaway kid who he found himself feeding, apparently.
Last month had been one hell of a month, I swear. I never knew school was capable with dumping us with a shit ton of school works. Just looking at it makes my head spin, and I never like doing anything so yeah, it was torture. Again, so sorry for the mega late update.
For a moment, she thought he caught her looking at him, but the guy appeared to be more preoccupied at judging the place.
Tony stared at the bright screen of his phone as if staring at it long enough would make it stop flashing 6:47 a.m. and change it to 8:00 p.m. He was pretty sure it was still 8:00 p.m. five minutes ago, where the hell did all the time go?
“Like you said, Thor… he’s sent here as a punishment, right?” Bruce said. “How about you?” Rehab of course, though Loki doesn’t knew that. What Loki doesn’t know wouldn’t heart.
Jane was pretty sure she couldn’t flirt to save her life, but a compliment’s a compliment. “Okay, fine, forget it,” she said waving her hands. “So you’re asking me for tips, right?”
Everyone frowned and turned to the door, and truth to be told, a pizza delivery boy was standing outside the door holding a two boxes of pizza.
Steve, who saw his scars, hisbig ugly scars, and all can Tony think was act like Steve saw nothing, or act like the scars never existed. Again, it's easier to ignore it. And ignoring is easier when you act like an ass.
The thought that Thor had experienced a similar occasion in both of their lives made Steve wonder that maybe: he’s not so faraway after all. That maybe: there’s people just as far as him.
The painting in question was of six people, talking to each other as if they were friends since birth, gathered around a table, but with each of them wearing a blindfold.
As soon as his eyes landed on the note taped on the fridge, he was dead set on ignoring it and just go find his hearing aid. But it was nowhere.
You know there’s something wrong with you when you’d rather be in jail or in some institution rather than the outside world.
“—And that is why we need a peephole in this place,” Clint declared after listing of reasons that were all taken from the film that they were watching.
He’s not really hiding per say, he’s basically just not part of their field of vision, just like a bird perched on top of an electrical wiring, you wouldn’t notice it unless you look up.
Tony watched him walk down the hall until he disappeared into his room. As soon as he was out of his sight, Tony whipped out his phone and contacted Pepper. She picked up on the first ring.
After finishing all of his classes for the day, he didn’t return home—is that what he needs to call it? Instead, he walked around campus and tried making friends. It was easy to start a conversation, but it was hard to maintain it. It was like trying to hold water. After what felt like hours, Thor huffed and thought that maybe he’d try making friends tomorrow.
Bruce blinked as he put his arms down and Tony made a noise that sounded like realization. “Yeah, yeah this is building A.” He said rubbing the back of his neck, embarrassed. “I’m Bruce, this is Tony.” He added introducing Tony with a jerked of his head. “I’m guessing you’re one of the tenants?”
“I can’t see the connection with living in this dump and actually living in a livable place,” Tony said, opening his ‘room’, only to deflate when it was as narrow as Judy Hop’s apartment.
I'm really, really sorry, but if it helps, my twin sister's giving me hell because of my laziness. Yeah, she also reads my story then insults it afterwards (she's supportive that way).
Tony stared at their hard work and wondered if he could persuade Pepper to buy him an apartment instead—it’s not that late to change minds right? He could barely drop a needle in the room without hitting anything.
“No, yeah, of course I know that.” This time Steve physically scratched his nape out of embarrassment. “W-why, I mean, walking on eggshells? Do you think I’m secretly trying to reach out on everyone?”
The kid tapped an offbeat rhythm on the table and Clint found himself staring at it, before looking at the kid’s eyes that was darting everywhere.
, having a sexuality crisis—but by the fourth time he had tried to talk to Tony at school—and that was a huge step for him—he finally realized that Tony’s avoidance might not be because of the underwear. It had to be the scars. Bucky wouldn’t even stay in the same room as Steve for a whole month because of his arm, and until now he still refused to go outside.
She wanted to correct him that they weren’t roommates, they don’t share a room after all. Instead, Natasha found herself saying: “I threw my slipper at Tony the other night.”
“And Thor wouldn’t be so paranoid with leaving him near an open door if he never had any history with running away,” Tony continued on, ignoring Steve. “For Christ’s sake, the guy padlocks his own windows just so that kid wouldn’t leave at night.”
Steve blinked a few times, and Natasha was halfway from volunteering herself to show how much of a coward the men in this building where, when Thor bounded from his seat, suddenly fully awake, and ran towards the door.
Bruce was silent, but his breathing was ragged, it’s like all of his pent up energy’s finally gone and he was left with nothing but emptiness. “What are you, my therapist?” He asked Natasha, to Steve’s surprised, in a mocking voice. “Who are you guys for me to tell you? We just live in the same building, we’re not friends, we’re nothing but strangers.”
Clint leaned down on his chair, already immune with the kid’s ability to glare like he could kill. “Nothing’s free you know.”
There was an awkward moment of silence between the three of them, until the uninvited guest frowned and oddly enough, he stepped out of the door and stared at the building before returning back inside, as if making sure he’s at the right place.
It was a free period and Steve, having no idea what just happened, sighed his way out of the building. The professor from his Graphic Design was young, and he can’t seem to stop from using different references in any form of media. And he couldn’t do anything but sit there and act like he just understood everything.
A friend of his invited him to a party, who was he to decline? Only when he woke up the next morning, nursing a massive hangover, did he notice that there was only one hearing aid on his nightstand.
Looking back, the action makes sense. You have to live with five different strangers, it was normal to label your own stuff. But she just couldn’t find herself including in.
Clint is basically a bird, minus the wings and the eating of worms. He tends to spend his time hanging on high places: rooftop, terraces, trees, vents (especially vents), and whatever he could reach and fit himself in while eating anything that’s edible. The feeling of staying hidden from others while you have the luxury to watch them gives Clint this strange satisfaction.
Natasha stood silently as the others continued to talk over each other. Apparently, she was wrong, the silence previously was because of an entirely different reason. Usually, when she’s wrong she hated it, and yet at the moment, though hating the fact that she had concluded was wrong, she still had to bite back the smile threatening to worms its way out.
Even without his glasses, Bruce can still see pretty well, just not in the dark. He squinted at the large clump of darkness sitting on the dining table. He should be panicking, but he was practically half asleep, leaving him blinking at whatever it is he was looking at.
Okay, i know creating a college based story when you're not a college student seem stupid, but in my defense, I am stupid. Also, that fact that I wrote the first draft of this story at 3 in the morning hiding from my parents gives credit. And yeah, I should be updating I'm Not A Menace, but I'm currently fighting off writer's block with that story.
Natasha snorted, Fury was her uncle as much as Tony’s ever going to be quiet with his projects. She’s just fortunate enough that guy took pity of her and took her in, and the fact that he’s the dean in SHIELD and enrolling in wasn’t that hard, it was just a bonus.
“Well that’s heartbreaking,” Tony really tried, really, really tried. But his mouth seems to have a mind of its own.
Blinking again, Bruce looked up and was face to face with the biggest man he’d ever seen, other than wrestlers in WWE—
At times, he’ll end up with Banner or Thor in the kitchen. He’ll think that it’s the perfect time to talk, to get to know them, but a small part of him was begging everyone to leave and ignore him. Most of the time Banner just leaves without a word, which Steve finds annoying and relieving at the same time.
. And the longer he stayed, Bruce, noticed that the guy follows a tight schedule. It’s like his whole life is a routine: wake up, jog, exercise, take a bath, go out, return, eat, and sleep. And he did every one of it at a certain time, never missing a minute.
It was nearly five in the afternoon and Tony, having emerged from his room after unboxing most of his tools, made a beeline towards the kitchenette to make his afternoon breakfast (one toast and a mug of coffee). He found Bruce at the dining table drinking Oolong tea (
Bruce blinked when the stranger just turned to look at him unfazed—though the dark surroundings weren’t helping.
Bruce’s head twitched to the side, his eyes not meeting anyone, and his breathing was ragged. If the broken door wasn’t enough evidence, then the manic look Bruce was sporting was more than enough that the guy was definitely not having a good day. After seeing all Bucky after the incident, and not leaving his side every time he so much as twitch, Steve knows what an episode is when he sees one.
For a moment she thought she just mistook Tony Smith as Anthony Stark. But she was never wrong, she knew he’s the same guy.
for educating me about college life because I'm a high school kid and know next to shit about college, and
, then go to your mom and ask her for pocket money,” Clint said, sitting back down on the bench. “And when you do that, go ask her some fashion advice, while that blouse is pretty, it doesn’t work for you.”
Thor opened his mouth to reply immediately, then paused. He never really thought about it, he was too eager to want to meet this other person it never occurred to him to wonder why he even owned a hearing aid in the first place. No wonder his brother calls him an idiot most of the time. “Yes, I guess,” Thor replied.
Ignoring the unnecessary comment, the girl named Pepper clasped her hand and told them to enter the car, walking home this cold and early in the morning would be bad for the skin.
Pepper clicked her tongue and nodded. “Sometimes I feel more like his secretary most of the time,” she said, but there was no anger behind it. She glanced at Clint’s ears, and recognition flashed across her face before smiling. “But I know there’s a reason behind it.”
Bruce wondered if living with a vampire, two ghosts, and a robot is a good thing to tell his children someday.
“It’s not like he needs everyone to look after him.” Tony commented after taking a sit, surprisingly, beside Steve. “I mean we could take turns.”
Peggy turned to him and stared incredulously. “Steve, we’ll be moving from pencils to charcoals, to pastels and then we’ll move to paints, and we would still be drawing apples and bananas.”
“Huh? Oh, Biochemistry and Nuclear Physics,” Bruce replied as he continued to rummage inside his bag.
“To be fair, no one asked you to come here,” Loki said still in the midst of suffocating from Thor’s embrace, “We don’t know you.”
Steve glared at Tony’s retreating figure, sweat still clinging from his bangs. Bruce looked down, before glancing back at everyone, Thor looking like this shouldn’t even exist, but apparently it does. Looking at the bathroom door, thinking about the missing mirror, his bandaged hand, Steve’s black eye, and the two broken door, Bruce realized that maybe it’s his turn.
Bruce was the last to come, and he looked like he was going to drop dead any minute. But as soon as his eyes landed on the group of people huddled in front of the Television, Bruce snorted and made himself comfortable next to Steve on the floor.
“I waited, in fact, I was what people describe as ‘geeking out’—did I use the term correctly? Nevertheless, I was excited. The whole day I daydreamed of the answers that will come forth to my question. Alas, when I came back, the refrigerator was bare and it holds no answers to my question.”
Jane glanced at him and bit the inside of her cheeks. Thor looked like a kicked Golden Retriever and being able to look like that should be a crime against the law. “Well, I still have one last advice,” She said, “if it doesn’t work, I’m sorry.”
Thinking that the conversation was over, Steve was about to take a step back when Natasha spoke “Thor’s fun to talk with, you should try sometime.”
“No, no, no, Steve you’re an embarrassment, I take back my good deed, pay up, now. God, you’re worse than Clint.”
The statement left Bruce raising both of his eyebrows, and actually found himself peeking at the commotion. But before he could so much  as see a strand of any of their hairs, there was a loud “Shit!”, something heavy dropping on the ground, and he got as far as peeking with one of his eyes before registering the color green then pain exploded from his nose.
He could have just written where he placed the hearing aid, or he could have just left it in the bathroom. But no, he just had to ask the whole building.
Steve mentally slapped himself when he saw the amount of spaghetti he ended up making. Maybe next time he shouldn’t get too distracted and end up using all of the ingredients. And here he thought he’ll be able to make the ingredients last for at least a few days.
Her eyes followed Steve’s water supply, with each having his name labeled at the front. Then at Clint’s, slowly decreasing, food supply complete with his name and…
He would have called and asked Rhodey for help, but the guy was too busy off helping with the military.
“And I doubt there’ll be a hot girl about to enter through that door!” Tony exclaimed while pointing at the entrance with too much exaggeration.
As if on cue, a red-headed girl walked down from the stairs wearing a black tank top, ripped jeans and a baseball cap. She didn’t acknowledge any of them or even spared them a glance. She just went down the stairs and out towards the door as if three pairs of eyes weren't staring at her.
He was thinking any logical explanation why a hearing aid was on the bathroom sink when his too idle brain realized something.
He didn’t know what came over him, it was probably because of his sleep deprived consciousness that made his mouth move without even thinking, “He said you’re not his brother.”
It’s not that Steve needs to have sessions like hers, in her opinion therapy’s a stupid waste of time and money, but the guy is weird. As if he won’t get a grasp on what’s going on, like he can’t catch up or something.
“So what,” Clint said. “You’re going to be a nameless kid forever? I gotta have to put a name on the person who owes me you know.”
Being deaf isn’t really a huge hazard for Clint. Sure it can really be annoying at times, but being deaf for most of his life, it’s only normal to get used to it. Clint wasn’t really born deaf, it’s just like any other cliché childhood story where he got it from an accident.
There was a crash, that sounds like glass braking, and Steve immediately found himself knocking on the bathroom door. “Bruce,” another knock. “Bruce, are you alright!”
Thor jerked awake and the others snapped their heads towards the door, except for Natasha who was more interested at the fact that Thor was woken up by a knock. She was starting to think that even when World War III was raging on, he’ll just sleep right through it. Apparently she’s wrong, and she hates being wrong.
Tony must have stayed silent longer than necessary because Bruce started to backtrack. “But it’s okay if not, I mean,” he gestured at Tony’s disorganized belongings that covers the whole table. “Yeah, sure, see you around.”
She wanted to bathe at the fact that she finally made her therapist frown, but she was too busy thinking. “You were about to what exactly?” he asked.
For a moment, he thought she was going in a different direction, only to realize that they were going on the same path.
Comments and Kudos are much appreciated. And If you like, leave some ideas that you'd like to see in this story, maybe I'll end up liking it and putting it in.
That feeling when you feel like you’ve timed travel into the future and everything you once knew had changed, and now you’re stuck in that timeline that no matter how hard you try to keep up it felt as if you’re falling backwards instead. That’s basically Steve’s life, everyday.
“Are we friends now?” Thor asked.  He was still holding the flowers because Clint wasn’t grabbing it for some reasons.
Thor pointed at the stairs. “I believe he’s annoying Clint as we speak,” he said not taking his eyes off his his phone.
“It’s the reason why I was only looking for college students,” he said as the brunette opened the door near the kitchenette. “I like to think that this place’s a mix of a boarding house, an apartment, and a dorm.”
Finally, Bruce looked him in the eye, and Steve realized that Bruce could be scary if he wants to be. “I’m fine,” he gritted out.
“The last time my brother had done something such as this, I found myself waiting by the ER.” Thor told Tony crossing his arms over his chest, Steve stiffened from the familiarity of his story. Thor’s sudden demeanor changed, he doesn’t seem to look like the innocent happy go lucky huge blond guy they always encounter. He seems more serious and matured.
She turned to Thor who was looking at her sympathetically, which caused her to shove off the sudden urge to roll her eyes, and at Clint who was looking at her with a blank expression before glaring back at the door. Natasha decided to pointedly not look at Bruce, not wanting whatever it is that he schooled his face with, and glared at Steve who was about to say something to her.
“Sulking alone in your room, working out, like a crazy person,” she answered as the cashier punched-in their purchases. “You know, botched and all.”
“Oh I’m sorry, didn’t mean to interrupt your starring competition with Casper the friendly ghost.” Clint snapped. And for once, Steve get that, though it went over his head a little.
Bruce wanted to point out that it wasn’t, not even a little, but the statement threw him off for a loop. “Uh, what?”
Natasha did her best not to roll her eyes. Stereotyping is an awful thing to do, but she couldn’t help it whenever she’s around him. “No, he was making a racket and I couldn’t sleep.”
That morning, Clint went to his class wearing one hearing aid. Sure it was a pain that he could barely hear the professor on top of his hangover, but maybe he could handle it for just a day. When he got back, he saw his hearing aid exactly on the place where he asked Thor to leave it.
Clint didn’t say anything for a minute and to Thor, it felt like hours. “Is this about the hearing aids?” he asked, “because it’s fine, I’m not mad.”
He’s one of the greatest minds, built his own circuit board when he was four, graduated MIT when he was seventeen, the only heir to Stark Industries, and probably the most egotistical jerk to walk the planet. No human at his age had reached his accomplishments and yet here he was, going back to college when he already got himself a Ph.D.
Steve stared at his painting before running a hand over his face, only to realize that it was covered with acrylic.
The stranger shuffled and flipped a switch on the wall, bright lights almost blinded Bruce that left him squinting. The first thing he saw was the number of pop tart wrappers littered by the toaster, then at the mountain of pop tarts on the dining table.
Tony looked away from the piles of blueprint spread across the table and saw Bruce standing before him, carrying a number of papers that rivals Tony’s blueprints.
Running a hand through his hair, the young man shrugged and followed the owner towards the second floor. This time, it consists of nothing but a very long corridor with three doors on each side. The bedrooms, the man concluded.
“You know, there’s no one stopping you from using the bathroom,” Tony commented as the bigger guy continued to shuffle from his spot.
Bruce had half a mind to ask Tony if he was serious, but he found himself staring at Tony then back at the stranger, then back again at Tony, then back at the stranger, before raising both of his arms, as if surrendering. He doesn’t know if Policemen usually barge in carrying heavy boxes, but he’s not asking. “I promise you, I barely know him.”
A few days passed and Clint found himself starting a new tradition—other than putting your name on your food. He didn’t mean it to stick though, it was just supposed to be a message.
He took the risk and spoke, “Am-am I? Uh.. Am I missing something?” When Natasha narrowed her eyes, Bruce thought that he should elaborate. Rubbing his nape he said, “I mean, ok, he’s Thor’s brother so, uh, he gets the attention but uhh…” he’s been using the ‘uh’ word a lot, smashing his head on the counter seems like a pretty good idea right now. “Why does everybody, uh, seem to— I don’t know,  feels like he’s going to explode at any second?”
Thor smiled and Steve wondered how his mouth was able to show all his teeth on one smile. Steve could practically see the gums sticking out. “I look forward to the next one,” He declared slapping a friendly hand on Steve’s shoulder before leaving. “See you around!”
He then proceeded to grab some mugs, even more aware of Natasha looming behind him. Even with the proclamation with helping him with making tea, she doesn’t seem to show any indication that she’ll actually do it considering how she only stood there with her arms crossed over her chest. Bruce leaned his hips on the counter as he waited for the water to boil, having no idea if he should just ignore her piercing stare or start up a conversation.
Tony stared at him, then shrugged. It was obvious the guy needs a few lessons with lying, but Tony couldn’t really care. Steve’s business is his business. “There’s this thing called exaggeration, our generation tends to use that.”
“Dude, what the hell?” Clint exclaimed clutching his chest. “StarkAids are sensitive, you know that right?”
Bruce doesn’t usually jump to conclusion, but what normal person would move and eat an ungodly amount of pop tarts at the break of dawn.
Bruce scratched the back of his head, not really knowing what to do. He usually distances himself from everyone, he completely forgot what to do in these situations. Even in a crowd, he has always been by himself.
Jane sighed again. “Then give them gifts, like flowers or chocolates, show them you’re interested,” a pause “but do it one person at a time.” She could only imagine the horror if Thor asks all of them (whoever they are) out, it’s not really easy to start a polyamory relationship, especially in Thor’s state.
It was nearly four in the morning when he decided to give up trying to sleep and just start the day, maybe the archery range at the campus was already open.
“Get him under the sink.” Natasha suddenly ordered, Steve didn’t tried to question how she got here. Tony on the other hand whipped his head towards Natasha then back at the others, his face obviously screaming ‘When the hell did she get here?’.
Thor enthusiastically took out a post-it paper, writing down a question of who owns the device before sticking it on the fridge. He intentionally kept the device so that he’ll have a chance to give it to the owner face-to-face. More likelihoods of making a friend. He’ll just hand whatever it is over and ask the person to be his new friend! What else could go wrong?
Climbing back to his room, Steve glared at the finished painting perched on the middle of his bedroom and wondered if he should just throw it away. It looked worse than ever, it just felt so blank. Like it was telling an empty story.
Natasha continued to stare at the weird painting hanging behind her therapist. It wasn’t famous, but staring at it was way better than looking at him.
Natasha raised a brow at the nickname. No one has the right to call her other than her real name, even Fury. And these people, calling her like they were something more than acquaintance, is…
“I understand,” Steve suddenly voiced out, earning all eyes on him, he suddenly wants to shut up and hide but there was a nagging feeling that he needs to elaborate. “My friend, Bucky, he also  have episodes like this.”
“Shit,” she cursed. “I think I have a napkin somewhere,” she added opening her purse before rummaging inside it, successfully pulling out a blue cloth, she started dabbing lightly on Bruce’s bleeding nose. “Are you a friend of Thor’s?”
Natasha’s brows furrowed. She tilted her head and studied Steve, then glanced around the room before settling her eyes back at him. Apparently, one of them would still rather spend the evening alone in their room.
Putting his fist down, Clint couldn’t help but notice that the other guy was studying him, then he realized it was technically the first time they saw each other.
Banner paused, and for a minute Tony wondered what he said wrong. It was a joke, it was obviously a joke,
He never had any problem with drawing or painting before. But now, every time he stares at all of his recent artworks, he can’t help but notice that it holds nothing. Ever since that day, ever since he woke up, everything was just so empty.
It took Steve a few seconds to register what the bigger guy had said. “Oh, right, yeah,” he scratched the back of his head. “Glad you liked it.”
Before anything else could happen, Natasha slammed the note at the fridge and hurriedly left for her class.
Everyone was standing still, their eyes still locked on the closed bathroom door. Then Natasha suddenly turned and left as she climbed up to the second floor.
She was fine with restarting a new life, changing her name, forgetting everything she left behind. She already had a plan, get a job, any job would do, get a flat and spend the rest of her life without needing anybody. But her therapist—which name she never bothered to remember, insists that she needs to ‘explore the world’ as if she hasn’t explored it enough.
Natasha just stared at the note taped on the fridge, an amused smirk on her face. Turns out, she wasn’t the only one avoiding human contact.
For the past month, I was nothing but a sack of potatoes doing nothing but sitting on the corner. I was feeling comfortable you know, I promised to update every month and all I can think was "I still had a whole month to update my story, it's fiiiiiiiiiine." Then one day I woke up and it's April fools already. A whole month went by with me writing nothing.
He thought moving in with other people would bring a little bit of inspiration when he’s painting, and maybe help him get a grip on everything. He wasn’t expecting to feel like he’s living alone in a big place. Granted, he was following his own schedule—the schedule he’s been following ever since it happened, and he wouldn’t expect anyone to adjust for him. But when you don’t see the people you live with for more than a week, that’s not a coincidence.
“Oh no,” Natasha grinned. “You won’t be spending your time in you room, the two of you’ll be outside in the dark for the rest of the night.”
Tony blinked, then slowly, a smile started to creep up his face. He had no idea what the hell just happened, but he can’t say he hated it. Turning back to Bruce, who still looked a little confused, Tony went back to their previous conversation as if the little shenanigan moments ago hadn’t happened. “So yeah, I’m actually taking my Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering.”
“And I specifically said that if we’re not watching Back To The Future, then I’m not watching at all,” Tony fumed.
Natasha looked down at her lap. Friends, no, nothing to be surprised about there. But for some reasons, she was brought back to the memory where she tried to leave an apple with her name on the fridge. She didn’t know why she remembered it suddenly, but it made her frown.
They were told to create anything that day, and for some reasons, Steve was brought back to the note he read that morning. And now he ended up painting Clint—or what he thought looks like Clint, for some reasons.
Surprisingly, all of Steve’s belongings were in that one box. For a big guy, he barely owns anything, contradicting Tony’s mountain of belongings.
The girl snapped off from her trance and immediately retracted her hand. “Sorry!” she said before going back on dabbing at Bruce’s nose, this time more careful. “I just—”
There was another long pause as Tony realized what he had just gotten himself into “You’ve got to be kidding me.”
“It’s Steve…” Steve muttered at no one in particular in the crowded hall. He was still wondering whether Tony was still angry with the milk situation—apparently he still was, with the conversation (does it even count as a conversation?) he just had with the other guy, when he suddenly registered Tony’s last words. “Pecan pie?”
“He killed my mother by smashing her head on the floor.” Bruce told them but not in spite, not by anger, but as if he was finally breaking down a few of his walls. “Ten years later, I bashed his head on her grave.”
Peggy groaned as before scanning the shelves herself and grabbing a, to Steve’s opinion, better brand, and much more above Steve’s budget. “Why do I even hang out with you?”
That day, her therapist took a double take when she answered him that she was feeling good, and that same day, Natasha ignored Thor’s loud declaration that he finally found Natasha’s name on an apple in the fridge. She couldn’t help but grin at Thor’s lone note on the fridge the next morning.
“You know what, I have this—uh, thing, that I need to get back to,” the guy said as he hurriedly packed his stuff. “But it’s, uh, nice to meet you, Don.”
“What are you doing here?” Thor bellowed, and Clint found himself taking a step back. He wasn’t expecting that, especially from Thor.
As soon as the person at the other end of the call picked up, the man wasted no time. “Pepper what the hell!” he hissed.
“Well then there must be a reason why you’re angry then,” Natasha said nonchalantly adjusting on her sit.
Exams just ended and even though I lost most of my brain cells, I'm still glad it's finally over. So, as  a celebration, here's a new chapter.
“Music?” Steve asked confused then listened at the up beat music playing from the speakers. “It’s not that bad.”
“Yes, go ahead and invite everyone,” Tony said dryly. “It’s not like I sat here to do anything,” he gestured at the table stacked with blueprint.
And because of Steve’s unbelievable schedule, Bruce found himself unable to start a conversation with him.
“Hey man, I get it, but I did not spend an hour understanding this thing if you’re all going to bail in the end,” Clint said.
“If hanging out means people invading your privacy, then yes, we’re hanging out.” Tony replied way too seriously that Steve was starting to wonder if it was just a joke or not.
Before he knew it, Steve was back at Building A and was opening the front door. He made a beeline towards the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water, finishing it off immediately. He was about to throw the now empty bottle only to find Natasha standing in front of him.
Clint smiled and patted him on the shoulder. “How about just give that to some lady that you like,” he said, then he was gone.
“Kid, trust me,” he said grabbing the kid by the collar before hoisting him up. Sure, Loki was taller, but he almost weigh nothing. “I know.”
Clint clapped. “Awesome,” He said standing up. “Now where the hell is Steve.” And just like that, he was gone.
“It’s like he didn’t want to meet me, Jane,” Thor told the brunette beside him before taking a huge bite off his burger. Strange at it sounds, the street where they first met became their usual hang out spot.
“I’m taking that as a yes to knowing each other,” Clint said, the weird phrasing suddenly made sense now.
“I’m Bruce, I also live here.” He said about to raise his hand for a shake but decided not to. The guy could probably crush his fingers in one go.
Loki closed his eyes and sighed. “Fix myself, huh,” he muttered, and without looking back, he headed straight for the doors, with Thor fumbling behind him. His posture was stiff, but it was a start.
Bruce stood by the threshold, with a bloody fist covered in splinters, his whole frame shaking all over Natasha could see it from where she was standing, looking like hell.
“Look kid, I’m just trying to eat lunch,” Clint said when the kid made no attempt on leaving. “If you’re hungry, go home, apologize, and eat your mother’s cooking.”
“Are you his best friend or something?” Bruce asked, because in all honesty, he couldn’t see it happening.
It used to have a name plastered on the front of it, either the owner was too lazy or just plain cheap, because through time the letters disappeared—mainly because the place was a close friend of any visiting rainstorms that loves to take a souvenir, and the only thing that’s left was the letter A. The place became known as Building A.
“Sorry,” he said as he accidentally bumped with a man on his phone—three a.m. and some people are still awake… or finally awake. Apparently people barely sleeps in this place.
He didn’t notice, but the next thing he knew, Thor was helping him with the task. Which was scary and brilliant at the same time. Thor was bigger, therefor he would be more effective. But, it’s Bruce that they’re stopping, not a WWE wrestler, and it’s terrifying to think that even with the both of them, they’re still having a hard time to contain him.
Anyway, I know the first part doesn't really hold any plot-and so does the next few chapters, but that doesn't mean this story would suck. The plot would probably start after a few chapters.
Turned out, Walking Dead’s a television program about Zombies. Thor fell in love with the series immediately, even though he couldn’t really understand the plot most of the time.
He told them those things to calm Bruce down, to make him realize that no one’s rattled or teriffied of him, that he’s not the worst person in the room. And Clint wanted to kick himself when he only registered the fact that he had just told everyone the freak that he was.
“I think I fed you enough burgers and hotdogs to finally get a name,” he said when he didn’t received an answer.
“But everyone takes them, yes?” Thor asked, the tips of his fingers raw. He found out that even boiling water he would still fail at it.
“The feeling’s not mutual,” Clint told Tony before turning to face everyone. “What the hell was that?”
The bad side of being unable to hear is being unable to know if your pronunciation was correct. Sure, he’s not like the others, he was old enough when he lost his hearing, but he can’t really assume he said everything correct.
Clint, bless him, stayed oblivious as he glared at the DVD player that he was trying to set up. Natasha blinked at the mechanism and concluded that no technology that old should even be on Clint’s hands, it deserves to be in a museum. Glancing at Tony, she registered the disgusted expression on his face as he eyed the device.
Tony turned and saw mister blonde and muscle standing by the stairs. Tony wondered how he looked like, must be stupid enough to make this hundred pounds of muscle stand awkwardly by the stairs. Steve, was holding a bundle of clothes and a towel hung on his shoulder, and it didn’t really help the situation.
The man huffed out another laugh, “I just remembered how I had a hard time moving my stuff here, so I thought why not.”
“You guys hang out now?” Was the first thing he said and just thinking about it, it sounded like he’s jealous. Steve wanted to slam his head on the table right then and there.
But nobody knocked on Tony’s door. Clint could already see the sun shining through his window and his bed was still vibrating. Granted, his room was next to Tony’s, and therefore the only one who can feel the vibration, but what about the noise?
“Ex,” she said, and the bewildered expressions she received made her laugh. “It’s not that weird, not all relationships ends up bad.”
Thor stared at Steve and nodded, with great effort they placed Bruce under the sink having their faces punched and ribs elbowed. He could hear Clint’s comment on how that’ll leave a mark in the morning and Tony’s audible unnecessary wince.
Whenever Steve shows up near Bruce, he would slowly retreat back towards his room and spend the rest of the day until Steve retreats back to his own room.
Tony turned towards the unnamed man collapsed on the wall beside him. If he hadn’t known better, he would have thought the guy took a shower with his clothes on. But it’s not like he was one to talk, Tony was absolutely sure his white tee’s basically see-through from the amount of sweat he produced.
Natasha stared at the juvenile banter as she made herself comfortable next to Bruce—who was sitting on an armchair… for one. Natasha decided that the red color creeping up Bruce’s neck was a good look on him, therefore she decided to ignore it.
Natasha, not looking up from her phone, shrugged. “You started it,” she said. “I’m just too tired to search for a free table.”
No one asked, and Bruce found himself deciding to not ask  why he was with Loki in the first place. Maybe it wasn’t an important question, to begin with, Clint used to be in Loki’s position, maybe he found a common ground.
“It’s some shit that got so popular last two years ago,then lost it’s popularity the same year because it’s literally shit. Even I can create something much cooler than that,” Tony explained before frowning. He stared at Steve with a pinched look. “Did you grow up without electricity, because it’s the only reason I can think off why you’re not aware with a lot of shit.”
Tony crouched down in front of Bruce and smiled. “You seem like a man of science, why don’t we do some of that? And the day after, and the day after that and so on and so forth.” He said patting Bruce on the shoulder, Bruce only stared at him, startled by Tony’s actions. “How’s that sounds?”
The kid paused mid chew and stared at him, blinking. He was still wearing the same blouse and slacks, but finally, about a week ago, he was  able to wear loafers. Clint decided to ignore the fact that it was probably stolen.
“Your advice! It worked!” Thor declared. “Not on just one person, but all of them! I owe you so much, Jane!”
He knew everyone had their own demons, but maybe he’s not the only one with the worse once. It’s not something to be happy about, in fact he’s not. But, knowing that you’re not alone means you can face it with someone, and do it vice versa.
ONE MORE DAY AND IT'S HALLOWEEN YA'LL!!! *throws confetti* Even though we don't really celebrate it by trick or treating, instead we spend the whole day at our ancestor's graves, i still wanna celebrate because why not?
It was the lady’s turn to frown then blinked at an unnecessary amount of time, “Are you a foreigner?”
And just like that, Loki was snatched away from his grasped, the latter being crushed by Thor in a bone crushing hug.
Steve blinked and readjusted his messenger bag. He was halfway towards his next class when Thor’s words registered inside his head. Steve frantically turned around, as if he was expecting to see Thor’s blond head against the see of heads, his eyebrows raised.
He was still trying to process what the hell was happening, but Tony found himself replying nonetheless. “I’m not gonna spend my entire evening sitting next to you if it’s not Back To The Future.”
In all honesty, she wasn’t expecting the others to reply, considering that the note Clint left was for Tony alone. And now, staring at the other notes, her hand itched to leave her own comment.
Tony gave smiled, not bothered at the fact that he was practically begging for war against someone twice his size. But this is Tony, life’s nothing when there’s no thrill in it.
Tony bit back a snort. "And he's listening," He said and Bruce gave him a look that could rival a confused tourist. "I was joking, who the hell even takes a Master's degree at nineteen?"
Steve just stared from his position next to his bag and blinked as Thor paid for the pizzas. Natasha hates it when she’s wrong, so she’s going to do something that she likes.
Tony turned towards the guy and concluded that he looked worse than him. “Something tells me you don’t do this kind of stuff.”
“So you’re still using that no-talking-until-my-forty-five-minute-session-is-up strategy?” Her therapist asked. “Fine, but you know, you’re uncle’s not going to be happy when he finds out.”
That’s when Clint realized he was only wearing his boxers and a very loose tank top in the middle of the road.
Clint turned sharply towards Tony and pointed an accusing finger. “And I told you a hundred times that I don’t give a fuck if you ain’t watching tonight!”
Tony winced as Bruce produced a crumpled set of papers, and by the horrified look the other guy was giving, Bruce wasn’t expecting for said papers to meet its destruction from a very worn out bag that looks older than himself. The guy could do nothing but sigh.
She had that look again like Thor was an interesting specimen. “I was joking,” she laughed. “But, that must’ve been some kind of problem, to get you looking like that.”
Thor’s eyes grew wide, how stupid of him not to say his name when there was a lot of opportunities. “I’m Thor,” he said, but it sounded more of a declaration of war.
“You still think I’m like you guys?” Bruce asked staring at Steve, but he knew the question was for all of them.
Bruce wondered if he was just dreaming, but the moment his eyes landed on the mountain of pop tart boxes on the counter with a sticky note that says ‘THOR’—something tells him Thor got it from the numerous amount of sticky notes with the name Clint and Tony plastered on every food inside the fridge, he realized he wasn’t.
Just then, Bruce heard people shouting for his name. It was funny how for some reasons, everyone ended up coming at the same time. Talk about coincidence.
Groaning, Natasha opened her nightstand drawer and grabbed the pair of earplugs she managed to buy that morning. Now she understood why Bruce gave up on Tony, he just doesn’t listen.
No one asked why was he on the streets, why wasn’t he at home, what happened and why are they so tense around each other? Aren’t they supposed to be brothers, sure there’s instances where they’re not close and it’s just plain awkward around each other, but this is different. Loki was adamantly ignoring Thor, that everyone can safely assume, and Thor was… he was trying.
Sure, Loki had some problems, but to Thor, he’s not a problem. Sometimes, maybe, but he would never be a burden. “It was just my brother, he wouldn’t talk to me.”
“Shut up,” Clint immediately said. “So, the thing is, one’s a god, one wears an armor that could rival any weapon, another is the peak of human perfection, one is a shape shifter who could turn into a monster when angry, and an assassin that was trained when young.”
Steve turned to Tony with a glare. He studied him for a few seconds before hardening his glare. “You’re actually serious,” he said unamused.
And he can’t just buy any other cheaper brand than Stark’s. Stark’s the only brand that can actually let him hear, not garbled sounds his old hearing aids used to supply. If he wants to graduate from college and avoid going back to his old life, he needs to hear.
Steve shrugged, they were too close to the topic that he’s been avoiding ever since he woke up in the hospital, and he wasn’t liking it one bit. “I guess I just missed it.”
Not that it wasn’t his fault, but Clint drank more than one carton of milk. And then suddenly, just because of one, Steve found himself on Tony’s bad side. These are one of the reasons why reasoning with a person you hardly know is useless.
Other would have taken this as a sign and ask themselves if they just gave their number to a lunatic, but not Jane. Jane just laughed. “I’m glad then,” she smiled then gestured for the two of them to continue walking. “So, how’s it been?”
Anyway, Clint's chapter was basically just an introduction for Loki and I hope you like my characterization on him. So far, he had the most changes comparing to the others with their comic book counterparts. I had fun playing around with his character, but I've been really busy this last few weeks so I wasn't able to really give my best on this chapter. I got a Thesis paper, a Research paper, and an Investigatory project lined up this sem and I'm three seconds away from committing murder. Seriously, we have three papers to finish and I'm wondering if High School's in different countries also have that because I need to encourage myself that we're not the only ones suffering.
Tony glared at the mountain of boxes he placed on the side of the truck and glared at the other boxes still inside the truck. It wasn’t the fact that he had a lot of stuff—the boxes barely contained any of his clothes, it’s just that most of them just contained his tools and ‘creations from hell’ (Pepper’s words). If possible, he’ll box Dum-E up in a heartbeat.
Steve glared at him, his jaw clicking, before pivoting around and barging his way towards the bathroom. Tony shrugged, suddenly not all that embarrassed that he never grew out from his Captain America phase. Maybe he won’t hate living in this place after all.
After a few month’s of living in the city, Bruce has known a lot of secluded areas around here, but that could take him hours before (if possible) he finds Loki, and if he adds in his embarrassing health, he might probably find himself face planted on the middle of the road, completely passed out.
Tony snatched the bowl of popcorn from Clint and placed it on his lap. “No one cares,” he said. “And swallow before you start talking.” Tony added hissing.
Bruce barely heard Tony muttering about his allowance getting wasted on someone he doesn’t know before finally noticing Bruce, his tea still half way to his lips
Honestly, his first choice was Natasha, after realizing that she wasn’t a ghost like how Tony seems to assume. But, he hasn’t seen her, or even caught just a glimpse of her yet. And he concluded that by the time he could give him the flowers, it’s already wilted up to its tips.
The boy didn’t bother to reply, instead he just continued on looking down at he feet. Clint rubbed his temples and was about to leave the kid, having already reached his limit. But he caught the look on the kid’s face, and for some reasons, it reminded him of the time he was living on the streets.
When Clint didn’t receive any response other than a very long, very weird stare, he glanced around awkwardly before staring back at Bruce.
Clint came out from the bathroom a few minutes after Tony left. He gave Bruce a nod, acknowledging him, along with a face that says ‘Why are you still standing there?’ before climbing up the stairs.
Then again, he just saw the red-haired girl yesterday morning. He woke up in an ungodly hour with an angry bladder and he saw her leaving the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel. She didn’t even acknowledge him, but Bruce was too busy holding it in to bother.
“Oh, right, I, umm, sorry.” Steve replied sheepishly as he edged away from the fridge for Natasha. Suddenly conscious about the time, Steve looked over his wrist watch and found that it's still too early for any of the classes to start. And for some odd reasons, the thought made him strike up a question—considering that Natasha’s the kind of person you would rather not ask anything—Steve wondered why he had the sudden guts to do it.
They haven’t had the chance to talk since most of the time they were too busy grunting and catching their breath, and sending a few boxes crashing down the stairs—Tony’s doing. But now that they were done, Tony realized a random passer-by wouldn’t just lend him a hand. That only happens in movies.
Thor turned and found himself staring at a small lady—well, everyone seemed smaller than him anyway, then glancing at the green light indicating that it was safe to cross the street. “Oh, of course,” he fumbled as he pockets his phone.
Bruce glanced at the girl in front of him, she stopped her ministration with his nose the minute Natasha spoke and was looking at her as well, but was still holding the napkin directly at his nose, before glancing at Clint and Thor, who he now notice were cornering the kid that seemed to be the cause of the current situation, then back at Natasha. He was pretty sure something inside himself died when he saw her glaring at him—glaring like that should really be illegal. Which confused him, a lot.
It took a few seconds for Bruce to realize that the guy was serious. “Um, what? No, I— sorry but, do you actually speak like that?”
Tony stared gobsmacked at his phone, a little betrayed that Pepper left him like that. But, then again, he knew better than to wake her up at ass o’clock when he perfectly knew she wasn’t a morning person.
“Yes, indeed,” Thor replied with a broad smile. He couldn’t help it, he was so happy, even though he was feeling a little down, seeing Jane was perfect.
In the end I may have enjoyed writing Thor a bit too much. He ended up having the longest chapter so far.
Natasha allowed herself to furrow her eyebrows. She didn’t like the situation, and that’s because she didn’t know what just happened. One minute they were all sitting awkwardly around each other, and now she could sense a banter between Hammer Tech and Stark Tech.
Sighing, he placed the extra food on a Tupperware and left it in the fridge. It’s not milk, but its still food.
And just like that, Bruce had a hunch on where Loki might be, he crossed his fingers and hoped that he was right. Standing up, he made a run for it.
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. College professors don’t usually remember their students, considering that there’s a ton of them. Technically, they’re all strangers sharing a class.
If you guys haven't noticed, I'm giving each character a chapter, something I thought was a great idea at first. then I realized I have no freaking idea how to write Thor Hahahahaha. so if I ended up writing Tony's POV next, don't be surprised. Though I really want to write Thor's, I just don't feel really confident.
Once they reached the list flight, Bruce finally noticed, for the first time since he moved here, that Thor was panicking,
The conversation immediately ended, not that Bruce was surprised, it happens every time. When it became apparent that the atmosphere was getting awkward, Bruce did the only thing he could think off.
Natasha stared at the living room, watching the dispute Thor was having with Loki while the other three watch, “You don’t,” she simply said. “Sometimes, others would,” she paused as she continued to stare at the others. “Thor told us the last time he left his brother alone, he ended up waiting outside the emergency room.”
Clint was two seconds away from punching the kid on the face. “Kid, can you hear yourself? You ran away but you didn’t ran away?” he asked not amused. “I’m this close in committing child mistreatment.”
Maybe it just instinct moving, but there was a flurry of movement as the teenager tried to bolt. Bruce was only able to recognize Thor shouting something—maybe his native language, and Clint cursing like a sailor, but one thing’s for sure, whoever this kid is, he’s not suppose to get away.
“Just because the damn university doesn’t require first years to live in the campus means I don’t have to, it doesn’t make sense why you’re sending me in this dump when there are perfectly good rooms in the campus dorms,” Tony complained. “I should know because I checked your dorm once—cute roommate by the way.”
Until Tony stood up, Clint was about to pull him down again but Tony took a closer step at Bruce, as if what had happened earlier didn’t scare him. Steve was surprised why Tony wasn’t scared of Bruce when everyone seems to be.
When the shaking finally stopped, his first class was about to start in an hour and he barely slept a wink. At first, Clint thought it was just a one-time thing. Ignoring the sudden urge to complain or two hang the man up the flagpole in nothing but boxers, he decided to just get started with his day.
He turned off his phone and leaned back. He stared at the trees, the empty playground, before looking at the street. He’s first and last conversation with Loki was when he asked if he wants some tea, most of the time he just watch him interact with other—or to insult to put it simply. He was the same as Tony, he doesn’t really know the guy. He knew a few this and that about him, but not anything concrete to know what’s going on inside his head.
Steve entered next, and Thor found himself staring at the other blond that was suddenly sitting on the floor, watching the start of the second season with rapt attention.
Everyone flinched back, except for Natasha who was looking at him with a calculating look. “Dude,” Clint started, but thought better of it and decided not to finish whatever it is that he’s about to say.
“You’re just making fun of me,” Steve huffed, which earned him a chuckle from Peggy. How can someone so big act so cute?
Peggy stared at Steve, who was shuffling on his spot, before hitching up her bag. “Nope, I’m fine. I wanna tag along.”
Thor turned, almost dropping his phone—first and the only phone he ever had—and smiled as he saw Jane standing next to him. “Jane!” He exclaimed, and for a moment Jane thought he was going to engulf her in a hug.
Clint turned and saw Bruce with his too big of a bag. “ls it weird that this feels normal?” Clint asked pointing at the door.
“Okay,” Tony squeaked quickly, which was funny considering who he was, before jerking his head back towards the door.
Bruce had just finished drinking his tea when the front door opened. In came Steve in his jogging clothes, his hair sticking on his forehead.
Loki’s underage, meaning dark alley’s are dangerous for him. The kid’s not that stupid to wander off on his own, that part is obvious considering how well he is on foreign words.
Loki ran away from them because he hated them, no, not just them, he hated being around people there. Thor mentioned about Loki being a diva, but if you used to be in rehab, who wants attention? Bruce would know because of Loki’s daily complaints about being in a crowded area had been stuck in his head like a song that wouldn’t get out, which completely contradicts to the fact that he likes bossing around on people.
Tony raised his eyebrows at Steve as if asking a silent question as the other man just continued to stare at him. It wasn’t like this was the first time they saw each other after a very long time, he specifically remembered the blonde sitting on the floor last night (morning?) as they watch The Walking Dead. Then he registered the rapid reddening of Steve’s freakishly pale face.
Bruce yelped as two hands grabbed both of his ankles and pulled him off his bed. Face planting on the cold floor was never a good way to wake up, never. “Fuck,” he muttered.
“No, shut up,” he immediately said, cutting Bruce off. “I’m not walking on eggshells or trying to act all heroic here, the reason why I’m not running for the hills is because I realized that you’re normal. You can say  that wrecking the bathroom mirror and the door had its perks.”
Peggy furrowed her eyebrows. “I don’t think you’ve noticed it yet, but they’re currently seeds.” She glanced back at the two packets before looking back at Steve. “You have to cook it first.”
“Calm down my friend,” Thor tried to reason but Bruce only smashed his head backwards hitting Thor square on the face. Impressively, Thor’s hold didn’t budge. “Ouch, that hurts.” He said, not at all even hurt.
Tony is not one of those people who try so hard to make small talks that end in disasters, he's usually the person that people tries to engage in small talks, but the guy looked like he’s about to face three board exams in three minutes at the same time. Tony’s pretty sure it’s illegal to look stressed like that at the first month of college.
“I have classes, idiot,” Clint retorted. “I can’t make time just to put a peephole on the front door. And besides, I’m not the carpenter in this building who keeps everyone awake building junk.”
