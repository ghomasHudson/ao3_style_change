When Sherlock remains silent he continues, “Every morning I’ll remind you of the way you drag me out of bed at all hours of the night when there’s a case. I’ll remind you of the way you read my whole life story the moment you met me. I’ll remind you that even though I shot a cabbie for you, you were the one who saved me. And every night I’ll remind you that even though you can be the most annoying arsehole on the planet when you set your mind to it, you’re still my best friend and the best man I’ve ever known.”
Rosie had been twirling around the living room in a red tutu, which had prompted Sherlock’s mum to dig up a video of 16-year old Sherlock as the Nutcracker prince, despite the fully-grown Sherlock’s protests. Rosie had been fascinated and spent the rest of the evening watching the video on repeat until she drifted off to sleep in the Land of the Sweets on the third time through.
John didn’t answer but sat down in the space beside the tree Sherlock had just cleared and leaned back so that he was staring up through the branches.
John finally managed to get her to sleep by promising that they could decorate the remaining gingerbread people tomorrow, but only if she went to bed without a fuss.
“Of course not.” Lestrade says with a smile. “Anyway I’ve got to go. Just be sure to come by the Yard tomorrow.”
When he reached the seats John had pointed out, Sherlock was surprised to see a makeshift sign on each:
With a shock of horror, John remembers the man’s raw knuckles and the woman’s scratched fingertips, “They were trying to get out.”
Chapter 2: "Wish list", In which Rosie writes her letter to Santa. Of course, John only has one thing on his wishlist.
John smiles sympathetically and pulls a stack of papers toward himself as Lestrade gets up to rescue his unfortunate subordinate.
Sherlock didn’t respond immediately but Greg saw the look on his face as he took Rosie’s hand and started leading her back the way they'd come.
“Judge Randolf’s wife left him and he was hoping to hook up with one of the jurors, apparently,” John said.
John chuckled. “Well, yeah, I guess it would be nice, but I don’t expect it. Don’t think she expects anything either. It’s just a nice gesture. Bit traditional, you know?” He looked back at his reflection.
The photo was a perfect embodiment of their little family, not posed with awkward smiles like the ones he’d gotten when his nieces and nephews were young.
But a couple of days before his employers returned, Hastings lost his nerve and went to take the body out. He knew he wouldn’t be able to move it very far so he waited until late at night and, dragged it into a bunch of trees where he buried it under a bunch pine clippings.
When they reached the restaurant however, there was a sign posted on the door indicating that the owners had been on vacation since the end of November and that they would be open for business again next weekend
“You and me,” John continued, “Not just roommates. Not just friends. I want us to be together. The way everyone thinks we already are.”
“I mean it, Dr. Watson,” she says. “Besides, I’m sure my boyfriend would be the same way if anything ever happened to me.”
recently been able to admit it to himself – that what he really wanted from Sherlock, the reason he put up with all the crazy adventures, was something more than friendship. Still, it was getting rather costly having to keep bailing Sherlock out.
Anyway, he figured out that Alexandra Garrideb was named Elizabeth Saunders and Howard Garrideb was really Roger Prescott who was one of the best mechanical manufacturers in the country until he lost his job and opened a locksmith business instead.
There was a knock on the doorframe. Sarah poked her head around the corner and the amused look on her face told him that she had overheard the entire conversation. John cringed inwardly. While the two of them had ended things on good terms he realized that his fumbling half lie about his relationship status was probably something she didn’t need to hear.
Sherlock shrugs, not looking up from his slides. “It reminded me of someone,” he says, “That particular cultivar anyway.”
Sherlock’s voice draws him back to the present, “Go through it step by step,” he says, “You’ve decided you want to die, you’ve decided that this is a peaceful way to do it. What next?”
Holmes half-rose from his chair. “Anything you have to say to me can be said in front of Watson or not at all.”
Slight change in the schedule for this coming week: next chapter will likely be posted on Thursday due to some other projects I've got going on.
“Want some help?” John asked as Sherlock gripped the rail around the edge of the rink trying to steady himself.
John steps forward, cupping one hand to Sherlock’s face and resting the other on his hip as he kisses him fiercely.
Holmes slumped against the wall with a sigh. I knew how much he hated not having an answer. If only I could see him I would know what he was thinking. I leaned back beside him and pounded my fist against the wall in frustration. The second I did I felt a rushing sensation and a sense of being spun around and flung forward. Holmes’s hand closed tightly around mine and we were pressed side by side as the world around us spun, flashes of light and colour swirled around us, growing slowly brighter.
“Good afternoon, Dr. Watson,” she greets him, “I’m Dr. Montgomery. We met last night, but I’m afraid you were a bit out of sorts.”
“Here.” Sherlock says, thrusting the screen toward Lestrade. John catches a glimpse of a short man with a round, clean-shaven face. He recognizes the area in the photo as one of the streets near the warehouse.
“It’s basic physics,” Sherlock said, glancing at the teenagers zipping past them, “I’m sure I can figure it out.”
Sherlock is seated at the kitchen table waiting for him with a box of pastries and the roses from the past couple of weeks clustered around him.
An hour later John has taken over squinting through the binoculars while Lestrade checks in with the rest of his team - no sign of anyone approaching the area except a couple of teenagers sneaking past for a river-side snog.
“It wasn’t very efficient. It took over an hour before they arrested me. I realized that there are quicker ways to get your attention.”
So the police got a warrant to search the property, which was a warehouse near the river, and we tagged along only to find...nothing! There was nothing in the warehouse except some old furniture, dust and abandoned boxes. But Sherlock had that look in his eye that he gets when there’s a really good puzzle that he thinks only he can solve.
He noticed it first when Sherlock was staying with him while Mrs. Hudson made arrangements to rebuild the flat. He had seemed uncomfortable at the house and John didn’t blame him - even he is haunted by the memories of Mary and the wedge she had driven between them time and time again. After about a week Sherlock had gone to crash in Mycroft’s spare bedroom until 221B was fit for habitation and John had let the matter drop, but now that he’s home he can’t ignore it.
Thankfully she took this as a cue to leave and John breathed a sigh of relief before adding a short note to her chart.
John looks up at her in surprise. She chuckles and hands the old roses to John, who places them into a jar and sets them aside in case Sherlock wants to keep them for some reason.
Lestrade takes the phone and looks closer at the photo. “This is down near the garage from yesterday?”
At this, the corners of Sherlock’s mouth twitch upward into a faint smile and he grabs his laptop from the desk before disappearing into his room. When he emerges fully clothed an hour later his icy demeanor has melted away and soon he’s dragging John along to Brixton to investigate an apiary. They find themselves racing through the back alleys of London and end up flashing Lestrade’s badge to get answers from a reluctant business owner.
Finally, Lestrade pulls John aside as Sherlock bends to examine a letter presumably written by a missing woman.
Sherlock bunches a section of the blanket into little waves and smooths it out again before he speaks.
John chuckles and steals a glance at Sherlock. Instead of returning the smile, Sherlock turns to Dr. Montgomery.
All the signs were there but John had been too scared of rejection to allow himself to hope. Now his head is spinning with possibility and his heart fills with warmth as he accepts what he should have known a long time ago:
“As if I didn’t have enough to do with an ongoing counterfeit case. Now I’ve got to investigate a murder and babysit a consulting detective.”
He pulled Sherlock to his feet once more, but caught the look of uncertainty in his friend’s eyes as he glanced toward the edge of the ice.
“Here,” he said, draping it over John’s neck, “Don’t worry. I’ll call you at the usual time with an emergency in case you want a more exciting way to spend the evening.”
Sherlock heard the bathroom door open and busied himself shuffling notes on his desk. He tried not to stare as John emerged, clad only in a towel.
John swallows two of the pills and settles back onto the bed. Sherlock busies himself arranging the extra pillow and some blankets to prop John’s leg up then uses the ice pack to massage gentle circles across his swollen ankle. John sighs in relief and feels himself relax into the soothing chill of the ice and the occasional warmth that comes when Sherlock’s fingers brush against his skin.
Lestrade shakes his head, “No, they’ve still got wallets, phones and a decent amount of cash. As far as we can tell, nothing’s missing.”
“I like a lot of movies,” John said, examining a model dinosaur kit, ”You’ll have to be more specific.”
Before he'd met Sherlock, his Christmases had progressed from shouting and loaded silences at home, to drunken parties at uni, to simply surviving during and after the war.
John smiled and gave Sherlock’s hand a squeeze before setting off again, leading them on a meandering path around the rink.
“But what about your reputation?” he pressed on as they made their way across an intersection, now heading toward Baker Street, “I swear, you get arrested more than most of the criminals we track down.”
Sherlock nods and turns his gaze back to the window. “It’s okay you know,” he says softly, “whatever’s in the past...it can stay there. But I need you here. Present. Now.”
They lay there in silence, John hoping Sherlock couldn’t feel how quickly his heart was beating, hoping he couldn’t deduce how badly he wanted to bridge the distance between them. He’d only
Later that night as the faint strains of a slow lullaby drifted in through the window his mother pulled him close and told him not to worry. She told him that the music on the wind was the sound of his soulmate calling for him across space and time and that someday, when the universe was ready, the pull of the melody would bring them together.
An hour later, Sherlock arrived at Hyde Park, Rosie in tow. She was staring up at the giant observation wheel in awe but waved happily at Greg when he joined them.
Then John was struck with an idea. Maybe it was crazy. Maybe it was just wishful thinking inspired by the sappy Christmas shows that kept playing on the telly. But there was only one way to find out.
A hansom was waiting on the street for us and after a word with the driver Holmes climbed in after me. The streets were still crowded but our driver wove in and out with precision and we had soon left the busy streets behind.
John cups his other hand against Sherlock’s face and Sherlock freezes but doesn’t pull away. They stand there, barely breathing, each afraid to move, afraid that even the tiniest breath will cause this moment to shatter after all it took to get them here. Afraid to close the gap between them because despite the facts, the roses, the long looks and lingering touches, the brain can’t do logic when all these messy emotions are involved.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up. This was exactly the sort of case he lived for - a murder, no known motives or suspects, and now to top it off, a frozen corpse despite the mild winter weather they'd been having.
Sherlock remains silent but leans into John’s touch. They stay in this awkward half-hug for several minutes until Sherlock pulls back and his eyes find John’s.
Yup, there's a part two in the works. Originally it was supposed to be all one story but as I was writing the idea just decided to bloom (haha) and I realized it made more sense to split it up. So...yeah, keep an eye out for that!
“Unnecessary,” she agreed. She had just finished coating the roof of her house in the thickest layer of icing John had ever seen. The gumdrops she shoved onto it were almost completely submerged.
Sherlock looks at him in surprise and Lestrade explains, “I arrested him five years ago for a series of bank robberies. I heard he was released several months back and told them to keep tabs on him, but as far I heard he’d gone straight. Got a job at a copy center.”
“He’d probably want more eyeballs to experiment on,” he said automatically before remembering he was addressing his four-year-old daughter, “Wait, no. You can’t write that.”
“There’s only one bed,” John said, the moment he opened the door, too tired and hungry to care that he was stating the obvious.
With everyone he’s dated before there was a certain social protocol, a script to follow. There was the romantic dinner complete with candlelight and wine, the walk home with increasingly suggestive touches, the lingering on the doorstep followed by an invitation to come in for a cup of coffee or to look at a pet tortoise or something else ridiculously transparent. Even the few one night stands he’d had were prefaced by an evening of heated flirtation and a whisper of “my place or yours”.
After a month of dating she seemed ready to take their relationship to the next level. They seemed to fit. It should have been perfect. But as they walked hand in hand through the rose gardens in Regent’s Park a soft breeze swirled around them. She sighed with contentment and nestled into his arms.
Sherlock reached for his mug, letting it warm his hands. It has been a bitterly cold day and he’d spent most of it wandering the streets, checking in with various members of his homeless network, trying to find a lead on the missing person case Lestrade had yet to solve.
Lavender Rose meaning: love at first sight. Also shares some of the symbolism of the fabled blue rose: mysterious and unattainable.
“So you were just interested in getting into her bed? Sorry John, I don’t think there’s a flower for that. Although I suppose coriander could work. It’s supposed to symbolize lust.”
He looked over at Rosie in alarm but she was stacking a pile of cushions into a fort for her stuffed animals and looked entirely unaffected.
Really, John? Now who’s being dramatic? I was just being helpful. Isn’t that what one is supposed to do in this sort of situation?
John buys a couple of sandwiches from a cafe around the corner. When he returns, Sherlock is seated in the same position, alternating between tapping at his phone and frowning at the list of real estate agents. He places one of the sandwiches in front of Sherlock, who ignores it as expected.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You’ll never let that go, will you? I told you it doesn’t matter if the earth goes around the sun. Besides what’s the
He had returned later than expected after dinner last night. Sherlock was already in his room, though John suspected he was sulking rather than sleeping. It had been nice catching up with Harry and for once they made it through an entire evening without more than a bit of good-natured bickering. Her newly reclaimed sobriety certainly helped. She’d told him a bit about her progress, showed him her 90 day chip, then talked excitedly about her new job at a local publishing company. For his part, John had spent most of the night talking about their most recent case and complaining about Sherlock and his ridiculous experiments, much to Harry’s amusement. “I mean, what kind of experiment can he possibly be doing with one rose?” he’d asked her. Harry had just smirked at him, but uncharacteristically let the subject drop.
“I’ve got a shift at the surgery. One of their doctors is on holiday.” John says as he begins clearing the table.
I’m not sure how it happened, but these are no longer stand alone chapters. If you haven’t at least read Ch. 10, I suggest you do that first.
John smiles and takes a few steps forward until he’s standing at Sherlock’s elbow. “Rather fitting isn’t it? Sometimes I have trouble believing you’re real too.”
Sherlock turns his gaze on Lestrade and narrows his eyes, “Last night was supposed to be your first date with your mystery woman. You’re unnecessarily apprehensive, probably because you’ve been out of ‘the game,’ as you call it, for so long and you’re worried that your first foray back into the dating world will be unsuccessful. Looks like there’s a bit of an age difference too. You’re frustrated with the case and annoyed with yourself for cancelling but don’t seem too worried that she’ll refuse to reschedule so that means you’re already acquainted with her on a fairly friendly basis and that she understands the demands of your job. Possibly she has a similarly demanding occupation with odd hours. Maybe you met her through work-”
“I - I’m sure we could have spared a few shillings for her,” I stammered, opening and closing the pouch to give myself something to focus on.
I followed my friend’s advice and left to visit my patient. After seeing that he was doing well I strolled down the street and took a detour past the Old Bailey. Even though the trials were on hold for another fortnight reporters milled about asking passersby for opinions while newsboys wandered in and out of the crowd trying to sell the most recent papers.
I had just sent word to my wife not to expect me home that night when Holmes returned, flushed with excitement, smudges of dirt on the knees of his trousers. He greeted me, ducked into the bedroom and emerged again moments later dressed in fresh clothes with his hair hastily smoothed into place.
So he waits. And waits. And my god, it’s a good thing they’ve been so busy with cases or John would be jumping out of his skin by now.
Sherlock doesn’t answer right away. His eyes flick over John’s face, taking in his raised eyebrow, the stubble on his jaw, and the question in his eyes as he peers through the wall of roses.
His smile disappears as soon as they enter. There are abandoned display cases half covered with ratty fabric, some tables adorned with sheet metal and a few stray tools, but nothing remotely resembling a machine that could be used in a highly organized counterfeiting scheme.
He shook his head to clear it and pulled out his phone. Usually there were a dozen texts from Sherlock throughout the day - requests to add things to the shopping list or random thoughts that were too important to discard but not important enough to file in his mind palace. But today there had just been one text shortly after Rosie finished school saying that they were going to the Winter Wonderland, then another half an hour ago informing him that they were back home.
John should be used to finding unexpected things on the kitchen table. It’s an occupational hazard of living with Sherlock Holmes. He’s gotten used to the severed heads in the fridge, eyeballs in the microwave and toxic chemicals on the drainboard but this is different. Less hazardous, yes, but also more...confusing.
This was supposed to be a quick and easy day trip to the country - head out before sunrise, solve a crime, grab dinner and a pint at the local pub (Greg had waxed nostalgic about the shepherd’s pie he’d had when he went on holiday there), then take the last train back to London.
“I want that too, Sherlock,” he whispered against his lips, “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.”
Sherlock thought back to his conversation with Greg during their last case. He knew about the pool at the Met that had been reinstated after John had moved back to Baker Street. It seemed that Greg had finally decided to put money down and his chosen date must be approaching rapidly; it was usually Molly who asked those sort of things, not him. Sherlock didn’t care that Greg now had confirmation about his feelings for John, but it wouldn’t make this evening any easier.
, for the first time in ages. But now? Loyalty? Yes. Friendship? Certainly. But as they climbed the stairs to 221B, John couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that there was something more.
“But how will you solve your little murder if I leave?” says Sherlock, one hand behind his head, the other making the fighter jet rise and fall on a lazy path in front of him.
His phone rang but he ignored it as he searched his mind palace, retrieving similar memories from the past few months.
Still, every time a soft breeze ruffled his hair John listened hopefully for the swell of sound and emotion. When the gusts did no more than send the autumn leaves swirling, John hung his head and whispered to whoever might be listening,
. You have a little over an hour to go home and get ready before he picks you up for your dinner reservations. It would be more efficient to just meet there but I suppose that’s part of the romance or something.”
We had arrived at the entrance to Brompton Cemetery. As Holmes led us on a meandering path through the headstones he rested a hand upon my shoulder so that if any late night mourners saw us we would seem like a concerned man comforting his grieving companion instead of a detective and his partner.
This is what has been haunting Sherlock, even more than the chaos Eurus, and Mycroft by extension, wreaked on his mind palace - the idea that John will leave him. It kills John to know that his fears are not unfounded. They both have a terrible habit of leaving each other but something always pulls them back together, like a magnetic force, or a planet orbiting its sun.
“So,” he says, a smile creeping across his face, “does this mean you want me to stay here with you instead of giving my statement to Lestrade?”
“What? No, I’m not -” she bit her lip, “I guess I’m sort of in the same boat as they are. I mean. This guy...we’re friends and all, but I have no idea if…” she trailed off.
“I...I guess you could say I’m completing your experiment.” John says, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
Yeah, I know this isn’t the way most 4-year olds would write a Christmas list, but remember who she’s being raised by. Haha. That’s actually just a convenient excuse for the fact that I have very little frame of reference for what a child that age would actually write.
John looked up and saw a row of identical dolls with red bodies and Santa hats looming over them. Their large blue eyes that were all stuck looking to the right created an unnerving effect.
“Well, another flower then. Perhaps if you found one that more accurately expresses your intentions instead of lying to your dates they’d be more inclined to continue their romantic association with you.”
Sherlock stayed where he was, fingers tangled tightly in rust coloured fur, feeling desperately for the heart he knew would never beat again.
“No one else sees how incredible you are and I’m sick of it. You can be an arrogant arsehole most of the time and you act like you don’t care what people think, but no one, yourself included, understands how lucky I am to have you in my life.”
It’s been one month since the end of Sherlock’s “social experiment”. One month since John Watson kissed Sherlock Holmes for the first time and all the loose ends in their lives fell into place. Sometimes John still has trouble believing that this beautiful, amazing man he’s wanted for so long, is really his.
He hears Sherlock shuffling around in the kitchen and takes a few deep breaths in an attempt to calm himself down. However, this plan backfires because with each inhale John breathes in the scent of
John chuckled and went to work repairing his own house. After a bit of work it looked passably stable, thanks to the peppermint sticks he’d placed at the corners. He lined the roof with alternating rows of red and green candies but most of his attention was focused on making sure Rosie didn’t ingest too much sugar or she’d be up all night.
It was this last desperate plea drifting across Sherlock’s brain between one high and the next that forced him to finally call Mycroft.
He turned to the desk and began to re-stack the piles of notes, not really looking at what was on them. He could sense John hovering behind him, seemingly teetering on the edge of saying something. Finally, he spoke.
Inside with the door closed, the darkness was disorienting and I found myself wishing I had thought to bring a lantern. But Holmes, seeming to read my thoughts, wrapped a hand around my wrist and led me forward until my eyes adjusted to the faint moonlight seeping in through the openings near the ceiling. In the center of the room was a dias in which a trapdoor stood open revealing a set of stairs. Holmes’s eyes found mine. I nodded and we descended the stairs together.
“You choose a place.” John says, his throat tight, “One where you won’t be interrupted.” He senses Sherlock trying to meet his eyes but averts his gaze.
They keep at their vigil in silence - Lestrade is watching for a sign of Winter but John finds himself scanning the dark corners for Sherlock instead. He’s not aware of shifting anxiously in his seat until Lestrade unlocks the doors and tells him to get out.
John shook his head but felt a smile creeping across his face in spite of himself. This was what he loved about life with Sherlock - these small, thoughtful gestures blended with the pure unpredictability of everyday life. He still wasn’t entirely sure that Sherlock felt the same way about him, but he’d never know unless he tried again.
I knew of course, the rumours that had followed the two of us when I’d first begun publishing our adventures in the Strand - two bachelors living alone, sharing nearly every aspect of their lives. It was only when I married and returned in earnest to my medical practice that the whispers stopped and the public began begging once more for stories of the great detective.
He was about to slide his phone back into his coat pocket when it rang. Alice nodded for him to take it while she flagged down the waiter to ask for a dessert menu.
“Sorry about him,” John says, nodding toward the door, “hope he wasn’t terrorising you all too much while I was crashed out.”
Sherlock’s eyes sweep up and down the papers and he frowns, “Nothing in his business records showing what the job was.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Holmes said, “There’s a youth named Hopkins at Scotland Yard who shows great promise. Also, Inspector Lestrade is a decent, if unimaginative, investigator. I’m sure either one of them would be able to locate some missing keys easily enough, if they have indeed been stolen.”
He glanced down the street teeming with vehicles then pointed toward a familiar clocktower in the distance.
He nodded and felt the blinding pain tear through the haze. The music acknowledged his will to live and also his agony. Silky melodies wrapped themselves around him and John felt the pain recede into darkness.
Holmes rose and began pacing the room. “They’re using his novel against him. Since when is fiction used as courtroom evidence? It’s absolutely ridiculous.”
“That is unimportant,” Holmes said. “Pray tell us why you are here, Lord Queensberry, and I will see if your case warrants our attention.”
Before John could ask how any of this was relevant, Sherlock added, “I couldn’t risk you getting arrested too. There’d be no one to bail us out.”
When he was young the music came and went without warning - a few notes while he brushed his teeth before school, disjointed chords on the bus ride home, and sometimes a few minutes of frenzied screeching that made him fling his hands over his ears. But the music quickly improved, the squeaky chords becoming steadier as the weeks went by. It was almost always the violin, though for a few months the melodic strings were interspersed with bouts of rich but disjointed scales on a grand piano. While Harry ran about getting into mischief with the other neighbourhood children John could spend hours listening to the music on the wind.
I'm back, guys! Sorry for the long delay with this. Thanks so much for all your comments on the first chapter - they truly make my day and really motivate me to keep going with this.
John looks over and sees Sherlock staring down at the floor, his right thumb and forefinger folding and unfolding the cuff of his dressing gown.
"Blending the friendly association of the yellow rose with the romantic implication of the red rose resulted in a much subtler, more intriguing meaning of love emerging from friendship." [
John didn’t bother responding. He’d given up trying to convince the officers that there was nothing between him and Sherlock around the fifth time he’d been forced to post bail within his first few months of living at 221B. He’d lost track of how many times it had happened since.
“You know that, right?” John leans forward, “You matter.” He takes a breath and continues, “more than anyone I’ve ever met.”
Holmes strode down the street, eyes darting back and forth taking in the new sights, already cross-referencing them with the London he knew.
John takes a seat on the edge of the bed. “Sherlock, whatever happened in the past was terrible and I know you’re still trying to sort through it all but nothing like that will ever happen again. I promise.”
At five years old Sherlock’s violin concertos were the most beautiful anyone had heard in living memory but he couldn’t light fires like his father did when his fingers flew across the strings of his guitar. Nor could he divert water with the lilt of his voice like his mother. Sherlock wanted more than the gentle breeze that flowed from his strings and disappeared quickly into thin air. Try as he might he couldn’t make the wind do his bidding.
“She’ll be expecting you to wear it at Christmas,” Sherlock said as he stood and pulled on his own navy blue scarf. Then he reached into the tin and took the last cookie before walking out the door.
“She wanted to ask Santa for a nice murder for you,” John explained, his expression flickering between disapproval and amusement.
John watches the even rise and fall of his friend’s steady breaths and feels a sense of contentment wash over him. Every now and then there’s a slight wrinkle in Sherlock’s brow as he peruses a piece of information before his lips quirk upward in an amused smirk or a look of satisfaction. John doesn’t write about these things either.
When I woke some time later, I was surprisingly warm considering the gray drizzle falling in ripples on the river’s surface. Holmes, who had likely remained awake pondering our situation, had draped his cloak over my shoulders while I slept and wandered off. A moment of panic passed through me at his absence, but my fears were allayed when I scrambled up the embankment and found him on a bench, chatting with a homeless girl who looked to be in her late 20s.
As we walked Holmes explained in a whisper that his various contacts reported seeing a man matching Ross’s description coming and going in this area late at night for several weeks.
He remembered little of the next few weeks, just vague sensations of being simultaneously too hot and too cold, flashes of anger, hallucinations and whispered words that he’s not sure were real (
Beside me Holmes was turning on the spot, his eyes wide with wonder at the towering city that had evolved around us.
Sherlock had called this a ‘social experiment’ but this creates more questions than it answers. What could drugged flowers have to do with...what was it he said, ‘the effect of symbolism on interpersonal relationships’? Could Sherlock be asking-?
And this, my friends, is why you should always have your phones turned off during a romantic dinner.
John blushed, glad the lights were out and that Sherlock was staying on his side of the bed unlike the last time they’d found themselves in this situation.
“Well, I’ve got to get to work. But I’m sure you can manage your experiments, social and otherwise, without me.”
Another short update today. The next few chapters have a lot more meat to them though, I promise. Chapter 5 will be posted by Thursday at the latest.
“Oh, come on,” says Lestrade, “maybe they weren’t dating but what makes you think someone forced them in?”
He’d heard of Roger Prescott and introduced himself by having a copy of the stolen warehouse key made and, after a bit of chatting, brought up the construction job. As luck would have it, Prescott was desperate enough to take him up on the offer to build Ms. Garry’s counterfeiting machine no questions asked. While negotiations for the property were still underway Winter was sneaking into the warehouse every night with Prescott to get the machines up and running.
Dr. Montgomery leaves shortly after, assuring John that he’ll make a full recovery and should be discharged soon. The nurse, a woman in her mid-thirties, steps forward and begins checking his vitals - all normal. She’s efficient and John can tell she’s passionate about her job.
He winces as the kettle clatters much louder than expected when he sets it back down. The violent symphony stops and both brothers turn to look at him in unison.
“Why would I need them to navigate the city? You can hardly see them here and anyway I have an impeccable sense of direction.”
Another horn blared and a second carriage zipped past. Its occupant shouted out the window, “Can’t you see the bloody signs?”
He flagged the waiter down for the check without getting dessert. For her part, Alice took it in stride, though John knew the chance of a second date was almost non-existent.
John watched Molly and Greg descend the stairs together and tried to ignore the prickle of jealousy as they stepped out into the street hand in hand. He was happy for them of course, but their easy flirtation that had intensified as the night wore on made it difficult for him to deny that what they had was what he wanted with Sherlock. The knowledge that they both felt the same way, the rising euphoria of falling in love.
John laughed. “No, idiot. I mean here, in this moment.” He paused for a beat, in which he brushed his fingers against Sherlock’s wrist. When Sherlock’s hand twitched but didn’t pull away, John continued, “I wish I could stay like this, with you, forever.”
John sighs and tries to tell her it’s not like that, that he’s just helping Sherlock through a tough time but his heart isn’t really in it. He can’t help wishing that this change was permanent, then feels guilty all over again because what he really should be wishing is for Sherlock’s insecurities to ease sooner rather than later even if it means sleeping apart.
Despite the cold rain still falling outside, Greg felt himself warming up as they left the shop huddled under Molly’s sunflower umbrella.
John turns to stare at the flowers on the table to make sure that they’re real, that he’s not imagining this. Memories flit across his mind - the way Sherlock slipped his arm around him as they walked the night before, the terror in his eyes when he thought John had been shot, the smug look of satisfaction when John once again cancelled a date to join him on a case, and the look on his face the very first night at Angelo’s when John asked if he had a boyfriend.
Sherlock nods and reaches for his phone as Lestrade swipes back to the photo of the real estate agent.
He wants to ask Sherlock who this person is but can’t bring himself to form the question. Instead he grabs his laptop, props his leg up on the coffee table, and types “floribunda rose” into the search engine. He’s met with images of the ruffly flower in all combinations of colours and patterns.
Sherlock continues, “Also, do they look calm? At peace with the world? Ready to die with the great love of their life by their side? Maybe they had a change of heart. Unlikely, if you assume a love suicide or an escape from the law.”
Sherlock had no idea. He couldn’t think. Another hit. That would make everything better. Whenever the drugs wore off the voice returned again and again and again. Sometimes the voice was hopeful (
After a week of their new sleeping arrangement Mrs. Hudson asks John if they should turn the upstairs bedroom into a proper nursery for Rosie now that her boys have “finally sorted themselves out.” She shows him a sample of wallpaper with cartoon elephants being held aloft by hot air balloons.
The next morning John descends the stairs from his room with trepidation. He’s learned to sense Sherlock’s moods and is 95% sure his flatmate is in one of his sulks, and has been since John turned down his dinner invitation yesterday, though he’s not quite sure why.
He trails off as he scans her from head to toe, eyes lingering on her new haircut, freshly trimmed nails, the faint natural blush on her cheeks and the corner of her mobile peeking out from the pocket of her lab coat.
Sherlock points to a spot between the rooftop of the building next to them and a taller apartment in the distance.
“Any luck finding Evans?” Sherlock asks when they return, his eyes sweeping over the information on the papers and screens scattered around the table.
Sherlock is nervous. That much is clear from the way he keeps tugging at his cuffs and rambling about flowers and symbolism and socially acceptable dating practices he probably spent hours Googling. John just smiles.
When he pulled back again, he said, “Just don’t make a habit of it. We can’t both keep getting arrested. There’d be no one to bail us.”
“No. Go away.” John reaches out as if to hit the snooze button and catches a handful of curls instead.
There was a pause during which his eyes flicked upward at John who was looking at his wallet, wondering how much bailing Sherlock out of jail would cost this time.
Life has been crazy (mostly in a good way) since I last updated. Please excuse any inaccuracies - this hasn't been beta'd or brit-picked and my knowledge of London comes from books, tv shows, and the 5 days I spent there at the end of summer.
As the ground levels out Winter twists and manages to land on top of him. John hears a crack, feels a sharp pain in his ankle and cries out. He must have loosened his grip because Winter has scrambled to his feet and is already several yards away, following the curve of the river downstream. The next second, Sherlock is there, leaping on Winter from above like a great bird of prey, cloak flying out behind him. As he wrestles the gun from Winter’s hands his eyes meet John’s for a second, sharp grey clouded with worry, then he knocks the butt of the gun against Winter’s skull. Winter slumps forward from the blow and Sherlock rushes to where John is curled, cradling his ankle.
“I asked my mother to send over her recipe,” Sherlock said, “I forgot she had to take Mycroft’s cookie consumption into account when she used to make these. He always ended up eating the equivalent of a gingerbread
He drew the bow across the strings, trying at first to imitate the solemn requiems he’d heard at village funerals, the ones that made flowers bloom in wreaths around the headstones of the dead but it felt forced, too common for the extraordinary life he had lost.
“Wrong. Who are you anyway?” asks Sherlock. The young man opens his mouth to reply but Sherlock waves his hand. “Never mind. Go away.”
John continues to put the dishes away, stopping to shift a few stray mould samples in the cabinet. Sherlock has been vigilant about keeping his experiments out of Rosie’s reach but it does result in unpleasant discoveries each time John flicks one of the child-locked doors open. He adds that to the mental list of things they need to discuss eventually. When he can delay no longer he turns to head upstairs. Sherlock is still sitting crouched in his chair but looks up as John pauses beside him.
His limp disappeared as he began to walk faster, chasing the music as if it would vanish if he fell behind. He barely noticed the street names as he rushed past, following the music as it led him through back alleys and over fences.
Sherlock deposits the dishes in the sink then hovers near the doorway fiddling with the sleeve of his dressing gown.
“I’m sorry,” he said, “I didn’t mean anything by it. She’s not just my daughter and I love that she’s interested in your work.”
Holmes shot me a look. “Call it what you will, his only crime is falling in love with the wrong person.”
Sherlock sighed. He was trying to focus on the images that a girl in his homeless network had sent him - a lead on Lestrade’s missing person case, but his mind kept returning to his conversation with John last night at Angelo’s. They’d talked about their first case, the fact that John considered Sherlock his family, and...there was something else he’d been about to say, but they’d been pulled away on a case with Hopkins before he’d gotten the chance.
“Late?” John cracks an eye open and sees the still-dark sky outside the window, “Sherlock, I haven’t slept properly in days. Can’t it wait til morning?”
Sherlock gasps but continues, “Well, a proper experiment has many variables. You have to test different circumstances and in this situation it’s not only my assessment that counts -” he trails off as John nibbles lightly on his lower lip.
Of course when Sherlock learned the name of the famous counterfeiter he called all the investigators on the case morons for not making the connection between that case and the Garridebs sooner. Nice to know his sympathies don’t extend beyond the walls of this flat. I’d be a little worried if he was suddenly being nice to everyone.
Don’t you read the papers? The counterfeit cases have been in the news for several months because that’s how long Scotland Yard takes to solve anything on their own. If you’d bothered to do any research you would know that banks check their bills before dispensing them. It is highly unlikely that a bank, even one idiotic enough to accept counterfeit notes, would be unable to detect them before they are released back into circulation.
John found himself glancing across at Sherlock more than usual as they worked their way through the meal Angelo had prepared for them. Sherlock was always fascinating, but the flickering light dancing across his face made him seem ethereal and John wondered, not for the first time, whether what he wanted was even possible. Whether he should just be happy with what he had.
Uncle Rudy pounded a slow drumbeat that served the dual purpose of funeral dirge and grave digger while Mummy, Daddy and Mycroft each said a quiet goodbye. But Sherlock turned away, unable to watch as the red fur disappeared below the earth. Instead he raced toward the woods where they had spent hours pretending to sail the high seas. He didn’t remember grabbing his violin but when he reached Redbeard’s favourite spot by the stream he found it in his hands.
“Oh, we don’t need -” he reached for the candle to nudge it back, but John placed a hand on his wrist to stop him.
After meeting Sherlock, his holidays had consisted of faked deaths, loneliness, reluctant wedding planning, lies, murder, and now the challenge of raising a child without her mother.
“Who are you?” a voice broke through the odd sensations as the world righted itself. Holmes was still by my side, blinking in the light of a lantern held aloft by a trembling young man.
Then there’s the fact that he doesn’t sleep. John is used to Sherlock’s odd hours and insatiable energy when he’s on a case but they haven’t taken one in over a month. Besides, during breaks between cases, it’s not unusual for Sherlock to stay in bed until late into the morning but since he’s moved back, John has yet to see Sherlock spend more time in his bedroom than the time it takes to change his clothes.
His first thought after he turns off the lamp is that he needs to find something to do with his hands because his left keeps straying toward Sherlock’s side of the bed. His second thought is that perhaps Sherlock would appreciate a gesture of comfort tonight. His third thought is interrupted when Sherlock’s fingers gently encircle his wrist. His fourth thought isn’t so much a thought at all, but rather, a jumble of confused and bittersweet feelings as he slowly drifts off to sleep.
There's one more chapter (a brief epilogue) which will be posted by next weekend. Have a wonderful week!
“It’s...nice,” John replies warily. He’s still not sure where this experiment is going or how he’s meant to be involved. “I think I liked the orange one better though.”
They dropped her off at the room next door that was serving as a backstage area, then made their way back to the main chapel to wait for the Christmas program to start.
So...a date? Yes, a date. But of course neither of them is acknowledging that fact. Sigh. They’re getting there...slowly.
A horn honks on the street below and John jolts out of his reverie only to realize that he’s been staring at his blank screen for an hour. Or rather, he’s been staring over the blank screen at Sherlock for an hour. His cursor blinks accusingly at him. He sighs and returns to the kitchen to replace his now cold tea. When he returns to his desk he brings the lavender rose with him.
Sherlock drops onto a chair with a dramatic huff and prods the small collection of fingernails on the table, sorting them by thickness.
“Several of the children were singing the same insipid Christmas song. Coincidence, you say? No. They were in different houses, were different ages, and judging by the toys, had different interests. So why would they be singing the same song unless they’d all heard it earlier that evening. None of the residents were playing Christmas music. So, carolers. Ridiculous tradition but not uncommon in a neighborhood like that.”
of learning the names of planets when they might all turn out to be asteroids or moons or stardust instead.”
Sherlock nodded toward Rosie, who was wandering toward the carnival rides, “I thought she’d like to see this.”
“No, Sweetheart,” he said, “Remember I told you Santa gives gifts to people when they’re children so they learn how to give to others when they grow up?”
“Restaurant. Family owned and run. Your missing man was seen there several times in the company of this man.” He flipped to another photo, taken the day before, of a man outside the restaurant. The blurry picture quality made it difficult to make out any distinguishing features.
He shoves his own pillow over and curls up on his side using a corner of the bedsheet to wipe his nose. John sighs and rummages in the bedside table until he finds a handkerchief. He passes it over and rubs gentle circles on Sherlock’s back as he snuffles into it. When he tosses it aside John pulls him over gently to face him again.
John feels the heat rising in his cheeks. “I - we’re -” he doesn’t really know what he plans to say but is saved the trouble when the door opens, revealing Sherlock holding a pink rose, and Lestrade, who looks moderately well-rested and happier than John has seen him in quite a while.
He remained silent, reading the street signs and watching the coloured lights direct the carriages. Then without warning he strode away toward the crowd of people at the corner waiting for their turn to cross.
“We don’t get to control how these things work,” his father said, laying a hand upon his shoulder. “There are some things we’ll never understand.”
“But it wasn’t ‘worse’,” John says, “I’m okay. We both are. That’s all that matters. You should know by now that I’ll always come to find you.”
“Ah, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft says, “good of you to join us. Perhaps you can add some much needed rationality to the room.”
This was obviously a lie. The sheep case was months ago. Other than the case from last night, there hadn’t been anything of note. And John’s schedule at the surgery had been sporadic at best. If John had wanted to go out, he certainly could have.
“Sherlock, I don’t know what you’re thinking, but I’m not going to leave. Not for a girl, not for anyone.”
“That sounds like fun,” said Greg. He smiled, remembering the photo Donovan had sent him of John leading Sherlock around the rink. “I heard your Daddy’s a good teacher.”
“Maybe they were making a run for it,” a junior officer suggests, “The facial recognition isn’t pulling anything up in our database but that doesn’t mean they haven’t committed a crime, just that they’ve never been caught.”
Does anyone still send Christmas cards? I'll admit that I don't (my excuse is that I don't have a kid) but honestly I think we should bring back just sending fun cards to friends and family regardless. It's so much fun getting mail that isn't an advertisement or a bill.
A moment later the Marquess was in our sitting room. He was around 50 years of age with close-cropped hair and heavy-set eyebrows and was clearly a man who took pride in his social status. He seemed to have a look of perpetual disapproval on his face, though perhaps I imagined it, my conversation with Holmes fresh in my mind.
John reluctantly forces his eyes open and sees Sherlock sitting on the coffee table, already wearing his coat and scarf, with a pile of John’s clothes beside him.
He didn’t mind as much as he thought he would though. The music on the wind was just as beautiful, and so much more intriguing than even the most celebrated violinists John could find in this world. And whispering his problems into the wind like a quiet prayer was easier than returning to the house where his sister snuck out the window every night to see her girlfriend, leaving John alone to deal with a father who refused to accept his children for anything but “normal” and a mother who had given up on reality.
The Yard is a hive of activity when they arrive. A couple of techs are running the images of the victims through a database and several others are searching manually through vehicle records, missing person reports, and immigration visas. Lestrade is in the conference room, annoyed by the lack of help the forensics report provided.
John relaxed, then realized how odd it was for Sherlock to be sitting here talking to him calmly instead of dragging him down to Molly’s lab to look at the body.
“Been doing it since I was little,” John said, “There was this lake near our house that used to freeze over during the winter. Harry and I used to go out there every weekend for as long a the ice was thick enough.”
Chapter 7: "Christmas Cards", In which Mrs. Hudson convinces her boys to take a family photo for the holidays.
John sighed. Now that the day was over and he had no more patients to focus on, his mind automatically replayed the events of the previous evening. The candlelight, their conversation, his hand on Sherlock’s. He’d been so sure in that moment, so ready to take the plunge, to ask if they could be something more, but then Sherlock had run off on a case, without a second thought. And John didn’t know what to feel.
Molly shook her head. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to meet anyone. It was just that she always seemed to fall for men who were unavailable, liars, or just entirely the wrong person for her. Besides, she was perfectly fine on her own. Though she had to admit on cold nights like this it would be nice to have someone besides Toby to warm the other side of the bed.
Stella nodded, “Of the 18 houses on that street, there were 8 break-ins and 4 unsuccessful attempts. But only 5 reported something missing.”
This morning when he limps into the kitchen he finds Sherlock hunched over his microscope and a reddish-orange flower sitting next to a freshly brewed pot of tea. Like yesterday’s rose it looks more like a garden variety than the type usually found in flower shops.
I shook my head in disgust and set the paper aside. “They say they have proof. Does it not implicate them both?”
Red rose meaning: a true love that is stronger than thorns and can outlive all obstacles. The red rose expresses the throbbing heat of new love, a passionate expression of attraction. Red is the color of consummation, of raging desires and craving passion. [
It was colder here than in the sitting room, where the glow of the fire and John’s presence had kept the winter chill at bay and he shivered slightly as he slipped under the covers for warmth. He could hear John shuffling around in the kitchen and tried to focus on details of the case to distract him from the ever-present fear that he was a replaceable element in John and Rosie’s lives.
John continued before Sherlock could properly delve into his mind palace to find the answer. “It was before the sheep case.”
“Real crowd pleaser,” John grumbled. She had indeed seemed charmed when he’d handed it to her and he was sure the evening would have ended quite differently if he could have just kept his stupid mouth shut and his mind off Sherlock.
After several yards though, he stopped, set Rosie down, then glanced uncertainly between her and the trees on the left. It was clear that the trail continued that way but Sherlock was reluctant to let Rosie leave the path.
When they arrived in Hampstead half an hour later, Stella extricated herself from the crowd of residents on the sidewalk and waved them over.
He let his gaze wander from the precise movements of Sherlock’s fingers to the look of concentration on his face as he wiggled a tree-shaped cookie into place.
When John entered 221B, he found that Sherlock had pulled everything out of the freezer. The space was now occupied with several large cubes of meat instead.
Sherlock had called this “an examination of the effect of symbolism on interpersonal relationships”.
“-missed so much during our travels, I hardly know what day it is,” Holmes remarked cheerfully to her as I approached.
He felt Sherlock shift beside him and turned on his side so they were facing each other. Sherlock’s pale eyes were visible in the faint light from the window.
“It’s a bit silly, but after we figured out the whole Father Christmas thing, we came up with our own tradition. We used to sneak out of our rooms after mum and dad went to bed, turn the Christmas lights back on, and lay under the tree and tell each other our secret wishes.”
Back at Scotland Yard, one of Sherlock’s contacts sent him a photo of a man who had been seen in the area, presumably our elusive Evans. For once Sherlock had no clue who the man was but DI xxxxxxxx immediately identified him as James Winter. He had been previously arrested for bank robbery but it looked like he’d found a new way to make money after his release. A stakeout was arranged and Sherlock managed to get invited along. Of course he wasn’t too pleased with the way things are officially done so he went off on his own, leaving me to chase after him as usual.
One tiny part of Sherlock’s brain wanted to roll its eyes at the cliche of Christmas love confessions and first kisses under the tree. But the rest of his brain was busy cataloging exactly what it felt like to finally have John’s lips on his, knowing that they both wanted exactly the same thing.
But things are different now. It’s not just that he’s sharing the upstairs bedroom with his baby daughter or the rounded corners on all their furniture, and the childproof locks on the cabinet doors. It’s not even the absence of Sherlock’s usual experiments with human body parts littering the kitchen, though that’s part of it.
Sherlock tightened his grip in response and shook his head. He probably didn’t need the support anymore but John didn’t need to know that.
“And you fear this fact will prevent the official police from aiding you for fear of upsetting the balance of the trials?”
“I’m not the one full of nostalgia right now,” Sherlock pointed out, “Besides, I see Mycroft far too much for my liking.”
He moves unconsciously toward the mantelpiece as if to recreate the scene and feels his eyes slide closed. In his mind’s eye he sees a ghostly image of a single red rose on the table. Sherlock’s voice echoes in his head:
The elders said his music could transcend space and time and that it would reach other worlds. But at the moment all Sherlock wanted was to be like everyone else, or at least to be able to use his music to whip the snow Mycroft created with his keyboard into snowballs to fling back at him.
Sherlock is seated at his microscope, completely absorbed in the sample he’s examining. John finds he’s a bit disappointed, especially after last night.
Seriously though, props to you if you’re a parent who does this for their kid. I would never be able to do it (mostly because that elf creeps me out).
John himself had been just as enthralled by the graceful lines of Sherlock’s body, the way he made every movement look effortless, and the passion that radiated from him during his performance. Still, there was a different element once ice skates were involved.
“So, now we’re stuck here with no leads, no usable money and no idea how to get home?” I asked, “What on earth are we supposed to do now?”
Sherlock doesn’t respond but releases his hold, allowing John to turn off the lamp and slide under the covers. John hesitates for a moment - they’ve been sleeping together for almost a month now but usually it’s just fingers brushing and a comforting warmth nearby, but John senses that, for whatever reason, this new closeness is what Sherlock needs tonight. He pulls him in closer so they can both rest their heads on the pillow and Sherlock wraps his fingers lightly around John’s wrist.
As he was leaving, John spotted Lestrade in a heated discussion with a well-built middle-aged man, who he assumed was the Superintendent.
John chuckled, “Yeah, well I said ‘no’ when she asked me for gold. What’s the betting she asked Mrs. Hudson for myrrh?”
“Look,” she says, “I can set these aside for you to look at tomorrow but I really do need to leave now.”
“Really?” Sherlock says, “If you knew you were going to die, would you want this to be the last thing you saw?” He gestures around at the flickering lights, oil-stained floors, and the slightly pornographic graffiti, “Real romantic place, hmm? You think Romeo and Juliet would agree?”
“I’m not talking about this,” John nodded toward the gingerbread houses, “but of course it’s just like you to make the perfect gingerbread house.”
John turned. He felt the blood boiling as his hands clenched inside his pockets. As he drew level with them, Lestrade caught his eye with a warning look.
was one of the people whose jobs you saved during that big financial case two years ago. Melanie Rosetti ring any bells?”
All the florists seem to have stocked up in preparation for Valentine’s Day but he tries four different shops before finding lavender and burgundy roses. None of them seem to have the particular floribunda Sherlock brought home three days ago but he figures he’ll have time to find a replacement later if necessary.
“Okay, and the houses excluded were 2 with owners out of town and 3 with dogs in the backyard.” John continued, counting them off on his fingers.
“Even after all this time, every day with you seems like some kind of dream. And I’m sorry that I may have screwed it up a hundred times over. But...dinner the other night. And the case last week. When I saw the gun aimed at you...I couldn’t think. I don't know what I would have done if he’d already pulled the trigger because I can’t imagine a life without you.”
John supposed it was partially his fault. He’d disappeared upstairs as soon as they’d returned home from the case last night, knowing that Sherlock wouldn’t follow for fear of waking Rosie. Then he’d left without saying goodbye that morning. It was a cowardly move, but John hadn’t been able to face him just yet. What if he’d been wrong. Maybe Sherlock didn’t need more than John’s friendship so long as he had his work to keep him happy.
“Right,” John said, shifting uncomfortably, “Well, be sure to follow up with us if you don’t see any improvement in a week.”
Ever since John was a child he could hear things other people couldn’t - a whisper on the wind, a melody in the afternoon breeze, a quiet sonata drifting through the silent midnight hours.
Apparently while he was in jail James Winter met a woman named Deborah Garry who was a genius counterfeiter, known in criminal circles as Garridebs. He managed to get the plans to build a replica of her machine and upon his release, set to work finding a place and a person to build it. One of his contacts tipped him off about the warehouses. When Miss Saunders showed it to him it was clear that she had no idea there was a secret room and he saw his chance.
John was more than a bit annoyed. Sherlock had dragged him out of bed early that morning and, after an incomprehensible journey zig-zagging through several neighborhoods, had shimmied through an impossibly high window to search a missing woman’s flat for clues leaving John standing alone in an alleyway like an idiot. Again.
John smiles as an image of himself bringing flowers to Sherlock, not because of some experiment but ‘just because,’ drifts across his mind.
So, John finally gets it. FINALLY. Why do these two idiots make things so complicated? Seriously though, this story had a mind of its own.
The song ended as he pushed the sitting room door open and there in front of him stood the person he had been longing for his whole life. The music he heard for so long was no longer just in his head. It was real. It was
John realizes that Mycroft must have told him at least some of the story but doesn’t know how to explain what’s going on with Sherlock and their...arrangement.
Sherlock somehow deduced that the man was a locksmith and the woman was a real estate agent. Neither were reported missing so we had to sift through records of all the locksmiths and real estate agents in London. Not an easy task, nor a very exciting one. Needless to say Scotland Yard was not pleased. DI xxxxxxxx allowed us to stay and help even though Sherlock almost got arrested five times for throwing away evidence reports he deemed irrelevant or just being himself in a room full of police officers. He refused to leave so we ended up sleeping there. Or rather, I crashed on a couch for a couple of hours while he kept at it all night.
Thanks for sticking with me and these two idiots on this longer-than-expected journey. When I first started writing this I didn't realize just how much the story would grow. And yes, it's a bit late for a Valentine's day fic but I did initially come up with the idea for this in February. It just took me a while to get it all edited and posted.
John’s heart sank. Of course he’d misread the signs. He’d been stupid to let himself believe that they could be anything more than what they were. He sat up and tried to swallow the lump in his throat and opened his mouth, unsure if he should apologize or make a joke about having too much to drink. But before he could say anything, Sherlock continued.
Sherlock was stretched out on the sofa, hands steepled beneath his chin, ostensibly filing the details from last night’s stakeout away and searching for connections in his mind palace. In reality though, all he’d been able to think about was John. The way he’d kept one hand on his back longer than necessary when he directed him toward the cramped hiding spot between storage containers, the way John’s breath tickled his neck when he’d leaned in to whisper a question that should have been obvious. Then there was his own reaction - to draw in a breath and fumble for a reply instead of scoffing at the obvious nature of the question and the way John hadn’t pulled away afterwards, but instead leaned in closer. Was it an unconscious reaction to the wind or something else?
I have been cautioned against setting this story down on paper for a variety of reasons. The most obvious being that, if found, this entire manuscript will likely be dismissed as fraudulent - a cheap and badly planned hoax with little to no credibility. But the real fear is that this tale, fantastic though it seems, could be believed by the wrong people who would take the facts and use them for their own malicious ends.
John feels his heart beat faster as he waits for the definition of orange roses to load then feels his breath catch in his throat.
Lestrade called him down to see about a man found dead in a library reading room. It looked like an interesting case - locked door, no signs of a struggle, but that day Sherlock couldn’t quite bring himself to focus.
Molly was about to put her phone away when the three dots in the corner of the screen caught her eye. She smiled and felt the cold fading away as she crawled beneath the covers and let Toby warm her feet while she waited for the conversation to continue.
I decided to go back to the previous chapters and add the meanings of each color in the notes so feel free to go back and check those out if you hadn't looked them up already.
Lestrade frowns, “It seems pretty straightforward. There was a line running from the exhaust to the cabin. Forensics has it. They’re trying to see if they can get anything from it.”
“Fine, but it better not cost more than 50 quid because that’s all I’ve got to spare at the moment.”
The earnest look on Sherlock’s face made John laugh in spite of himself. The corners of Sherlock’s mouth twitched up they spent the rest of the ride giggling uncontrollably, much to the confusion of their cabbie.
John smiled and he was near enough that Sherlock could smell the peppermint on his breath. Strange how the scent that had caused him to roll his eyes earlier was now so intoxicating. He shivered and pulled the blankets closer around him.
. He turns the pillow over and lays flat on his back instead of on his side as he usually does but it doesn’t help. He groans in frustration and slides his hand under the covers, finally allowing himself release before he falls asleep.
Dimmock shot him a suspicious look but all he said as John paid Sherlock’s bail was, “Just keep him away from my crime scene.”
I reached into my own coat, certain I had some coins to spare - I knew Holmes was often in the habit of giving his sources a small token of appreciation especially if, like this girl, they were less fortunate than most. But Holmes slid his fingers around my wrist to stop me and simply bade the girl good day.
“Hey,” John said softly, laying a hand on his arm, but Sherlock rose, mumbled something about sleep and retreated to his bedroom, closing the door behind him. It was childish, he knew, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to care.
Lestrade steps in before Sherlock can open his mouth, “Just let him ride with you. He won’t cause any trouble. Right, Sherlock?” He shoots a look at Sherlock who nods quietly. The paramedic shrugs and turns back to John.
“Look,” John says, “I’ve been trying to figure out how to do this. I’ve wanted this for so long but I just kept convincing myself it wasn’t possible.
They catch a cab back across town. The sky is just starting to lighten as they pass Millennium Bridge and they watch the sunrise from the steps of New Scotland Yard.
The day had started out as expected. They arrived at the station a little after 8:00 and were greeted by a man in his late 40’s named Cooper, who explained to them that half of his sheep had been swapped with those from neighboring farms over the course of the month.
The amount of frosting she had used on her house made it look like a snow storm had hit, and the gingerbread family she'd placed in the front yard stood knee-deep in marshmallows.
Sherlock glances at a set of petri dishes on the counter which are filled with samples of water taken from various locations along the river.
“They won’t,” Sherlock says, “You’re still missing one key thing...unless your lot have taken that too, which I don’t doubt, given their incompetence.”
It’s well into the afternoon before Sherlock emerges from his mind palace. He turns to John and glances at the flower next to him with a slight raise of his eyebrows, no doubt noting its new location, and begins scribbling furiously in small notebook.
John waited until he heard Sherlock’s bedroom door close behind him before whispering his answer to the empty room.
When we reached the top of the stairs the light seeping in through the crack in the door was a bit brighter than it had been before, though there was no way we had been inside long enough for the sun to be rising.
“It says here ‘red roses signify a true love stronger than thorns and can outlive all obstacles. It also has the connotations of desire, a throbbing heat of new love and consummation.’”
So, I’ve been laid up for the past few days as a result of our most recent case. Nothing serious, just a rather badly sprained ankle but I swear Sherlock’s been acting like I’m on death’s doorstep. Can’t say I’m complaining though. It’s nice to have him take care of me for a change.
Greg nodded, but there had been something in his tone that told Sherlock there was more to the story.
John continues to scroll through the page, looking for anything that could give him a hint about Sherlock’s emotional connection with this rose. Most of the varieties on the list have more fanciful names like “Gilded Sun” (a deep golden yellow), “Sultry Sangria” (a unique purple-pink combination), “Candy Cane Cocktail” (a pink flower that would not look out of place at a princess tea party), and “Rainbow Sorbet” (which looks exactly like one would expect with that sort of name).
But he didn’t have time to finish the thought before John took his hand. Not the way he had when they shook hands upon first meeting, or when Sherlock led them crashing through back alleys at midnight, or during moments of quiet reassurance in darkened rooms. John’s touch was hesitant but determined. Sherlock’s gaze traveled from their hands to John’s face. In the afternoon light John’s eyes were the color of the stream that ran behind Sherlock’s childhood home.
Once he saw the evidence they had against him, Hastings confessed that Davies had owed him a large sum of money. He’d gone to confront him about it but Davies had turned violent and in the resulting fight, Hastings killed him. Not knowing what to do, he’d shoved Davies’ body into the freezer and made his escape, hoping that it would look like a break-in gone badly.
“Oh, never mind him,” Sherlock says, “Think. Really think - If you were going to kill yourself, not just try for attention, but actually succeed, how would you do it?”
Rosie was delighted to have all her favourite people in one place and refused to go to bed while everyone else was still enjoying the party. Finally, after Mrs. Hudson bade them goodnight and returned downstairs, Rosie fell asleep on the couch with her head in Sherlock’s lap while John, Molly and Greg shoved the leftover food into the fridge.
I scrambled to my feet and hurried after him. Years of following Sherlock Holmes on cases had made his habit of running off without explanation familiar, but no less annoying. I had just thought that the last thing I wanted was for us to be separated in this unfamiliar place when a long, two-story carriage came to a halt in front of me, blocking my path. A crowd of people rushed out and I earned myself several glares and shouts as I pushed through them to chase after my companion.
“The stripes are too wide,” Sherlock said, “Wear the blue one. The one with navy and charcoal stripes. It’ll complement your shirt, won’t clash with your jacket and it matches your eyes.”
“It’s nothing.” He glared at Greg then looked down at the ground, “John doesn’t see me that way. I’m his best friend who’s helping him raise his daughter.”
Instead, John ducked behind a large potted plant and waited, peering through the leaves at the front door. Minutes later he saw a tall, curly-haired figure being led out the front door in handcuffs.
“Still, it’s generally considered rude to cancel a first date so you’ll probably want to do something to make it up to her.” Sherlock continues, “Perhaps you should give her a rose. Apparently they make everything better, though I would recommend
“But it’s not really your fault,” he continued, “You know, I used to read her the stories from my blog at bedtime. I mean there’s only so many times you can say goodnight to every object in a fictional room. I think that’s how it started.”
“Fine,” Sherlock says, pulling out his phone and flicking through the last few messages, “Alexandra Garrideb.” he says, turning the screen toward Lestrade and revealing a photo of the woman, “Real name: Elizabeth Saunders. She was a real estate agent who dealt mainly with commercial assets. Her most recent sale was a warehouse near the river, sold to a man going by the name Jonathan Evans. Payment was made in cash.”
His day took a turn for the better when Molly Hooper greeted him brightly and waved him over to her table. She had clearly made quite a dent in her Christmas shopping because she had to shift several bags aside to make space for him to join her.
Despite, or maybe because of this, the elders began to take a greater interest in Sherlock’s music which had developed into his own haunting style. The master violinist who could make water dance as gracefully as a swan offered to teach him to make the wind do his bidding and a famous music theory teacher from the neighbouring town offered to take him on as her protege. But Mummy always said it was up to Sherlock to decide what he wanted to do with his life so he closed the door in their faces.
This must be it, he thinks, after several minutes of searching. He clicks the link and finds the definition of red roses just as Sherlock read out all those months ago. This time though he continues to scroll down the page. Yellow roses are for friendship. He’d already known that - once he had made the mistake of giving one to a girl because he thought it was her favourite colour and she’d burst into tears thinking he was breaking up with her.
He didn’t have to watch them leave to know that they would be continuing their evening together - a walk hand in hand to the coffee shop a few blocks over, followed by a shared cab ride to one of their apartments, ending in bed with passionate words and whispered confessions.
Not that John had bothered mentioning anything to Sherlock ahead of time. It had been obvious the second John walked through the door though. The usual weariness that hovered around him at the end of a long day at the clinic was absent and in its place was an air of excitement. A last minute invitation then, Sherlock mused as he listened to John climb into the shower down the hall.
Official police stakeouts, John realizes, are not as interesting as Sherlock’s usual brand of suspect surveillance. As night falls over London they sit in Lestrade’s car, keeping watch over the streets around the warehouse, which is barely visible in the distance. It makes sense - a car parked any closer in this area would certainly draw suspicion but the lack of immediacy makes John relax into a half sleep.
John opens his mouth to ask again what exactly the experiment is about but is interrupted when Sherlock’s phone rings.
John paused for a moment to take in the scene in front of him. Sherlock was stirring something in a large bowl while Rosie stood on a step stool beside him and poured in a cup of flour.
It was stupid, Sherlock thought, the idea that if he just got out of his village he would immediately find his person, the one the music spoke to. He had been naive to believe it would be as easy as going out into the world with just his violin in hand.
John sighed in resignation when he saw DI Dimmock step into view instead of Lestrade. At least Sherlock’s message to disappear from the scene made sense now.
Sherlock stumbles across a murder scene while on an outing with Rosie. The way he handles it surprises both him and John.
Sherlock is unusually quiet as they eat, and John makes it to the entertainment section of the paper before he feels the need to break the silence.
They are arranged left to right in the exact order he set the originals out. The colours are identical except that the fusilier rose is replaced by a deep blue.
I confess that I am, myself, still in disbelief of all that has transpired though it has been several years (or depending on your perspective, several lifetimes) since the events recorded below took place. Time is a strange thing, as we discovered on this most peculiar case. Very strange indeed.
“Yes, I did. I even wrote my schedule on the calendar because I knew you’d delete that information.”
Can anyone list all the "easter eggs" from the original Three Garridebs story that I snuck into these past few chapters? There are several more obvious plot-related things but there are also a bunch of smaller references that have to do with people and places. Let me know in comments or as a tumblr ask at
Sherlock breathes a sigh of relief but still looks concerned. “You don’t look fine,” he says, taking in John’s pale face and rapidly swelling ankle.
“What, you didn’t see him in there?” John asked, nodding toward the door Sherlock had just emerged from.
John sighs and goes back to his blog. He manages to type up the rest of the case in time for an early dinner and they spend the evening eating leftover Chinese food and watching crap telly. When a criminal investigation show comes on Sherlock spends the entire episode pointing out everything the forensics team got wrong and yelling about the amount of evidence the investigators overlooked. John counts how many times he calls one of the characters or the writers an idiot. 42. Not an all time high, but it’s close.
When John wakes, he feels long fingers wrapped gently around his wrist and in the dim morning light he sees Sherlock’s pale eyes staring back, filled with doubt and longing. John remembers the words whispered into the night and finally realizes that this has little to do with half-forgotten memories. It has everything to do with him, John, and the future. Their future.
It’s one of those strange in-between hours after the clubbers have gone home, but before the early commuters have risen so it takes a while for Sherlock to find them a cab. John struggles to remain vertical and sighs with relief when a black cab comes trundling toward them.
When they return, the conference room table is spread with copies of bank statements and business receipts. Sure enough, Elizabeth Saunders’ company account shows a large cash deposit on the day the property title was signed over to Evans.
“I’m not concerned,” says Sherlock. You shouldn’t be either. She’s an intelligent woman whose personality and interests complement yours. She’s obviously learned what she needs in a companion and has figured out that you’re a worthy candidate of her affections.
Lestrade clicks his tongue impatiently to indicate that he’d rather skip to the facts pertaining to the case instead of listening to the victim’s entire life story, but Sherlock presses on.
“By giving her a red rose you implied you wanted a future together,” said Sherlock, “or at the very least, to consummate the relationship.”
I found him crouched just outside the warehouse door but someone else had found him too. Winter was there and had a gun pointed straight at him. I managed to drag Winter away but in the scuffle I injured my ankle rather badly. Still, it could have been much worse. I don’t even want to think of what could have happened if I hadn’t found him when I did.
Then Sherlock Holmes stepped out of the shadows and strode down the street dodging around strange mechanical contraptions and blinking signs.
John shakes his head. “You still saved me first. The day we met at Bart’s. If you hadn’t come into my life when you did…” he gazes at the flickering candle between them, “you saved me the moment we met, Sherlock.”
On day five John wakes to find Sherlock rummaging through his wardrobe. Before he has time to ask what the hell he’s doing, Sherlock thrusts a shirt and a pair of jeans at him and races downstairs, talking a mile a minute about dead bodies, love suicides, and “Graham” being “wrong, wrong, wrong!”
John gasped in surprise. For a split second, Sherlock began to panic, wondering if somehow, despite John’s words, he’d misread the situation. John was the experienced one in this area after all. But then John returned the kiss. Tentatively at first, then he deepened the kiss, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist, pulling him closer.
It was still night but the sky was ablaze with thousands of coloured lights. Beyond the boundaries of the cemetery impossibly tall buildings rose, cutting a path across the night sky and piercing it with specks of light.
There was every indication that the man in question had run off on his own, but something about it still nagged at him and he couldn’t bring himself to close the case. He’d even brought Sherlock in to consult, but the frustrating man hadn’t found it interesting enough to be worth his full attention and had pawned the legwork off onto his homeless network, none of whom had found any leads.
John follows and is surprised when Sherlock actually leads him into a diner instead of on some meandering investigation. He orders the breakfast special and a second cup of coffee for good measure. Sherlock doesn’t order anything himself but steals a few sausages from John’s plate as he watches the morning commuters rushing past.
At this point Sherlock would normally be jumping up and down with excitement, like a child at Christmas, but this time he had an actual child with him. Not knowing he was about to stumble across a murder case, he’d taken Rosie with him to the Winter Wonderland. Yes, I know what some of you may be thinking and there’s a reason I don’t talk about my daughter on here much, but Sherlock really is an amazing parent.
He shook his head and forced himself to focus on the task at hand. With some difficulty, he shoved the groceries into the crowded fridge. Then, seeing the mess of experiments and notes covering the kitchen table, reached for his phone and typed a text:
John’s breath catches in his throat but then he feels the mattress shift as Sherlock rolls over to face away from him and he knows better than to reach out this time even as Sherlock sniffles quietly into the blankets.
“So, it’s got a camera?” Sherlock took the box and squinted at the doll through the plastic, “Sounds like Mycroft, only slightly less creepy.”
“Sure,” John said, “but you’ll have to convince her to give up some of her other ones. She’s run out of space on her bed so they’ve started migrating over to mine.”
It’s always worse in the mornings. Something about the transition between sleep and waking seems to disorient Sherlock and even with John there it takes him a while to comprehend the reality of where he is.
At this, Sherlock turned away to stare up through the branches in silence, refusing to meet his eyes and John felt a sense of panic rise in his chest.
John opens his mouth to apologize again but she cuts him off, “Don’t worry. If it wasn’t Sherlock Holmes last night it’d be a screaming parent somewhere down the road. Trust me, I’ve seen worse. Better those kids learn now while they have time to switch to another career, than 4 years from now when they’re buried in student loans.”
“I’m pretty sure you saved my life on that case last month, you know, the one with the superstitious salesman?” John says.
John opens his mouth to protest that when Sherlock is involved conventional meanings go out the window but then he stops. He barely notices when Mrs. Hudson disappears down the stairs because he’s just remembered the last time he brought roses back to 221B.
“Yes, of course,” Queensberry nodded, “But I only wish to recover my property. There are some keys to items of a very sensitive nature and I do not wish to have them inspected. Nothing illegal, I assure you, but highly personal items, as I’m sure you’ll understand. I simply need you to find Robert Ross and retrieve the keys. You will of course, receive compensation for your services.”
Still, there was nothing more we could do at the moment so we went back home for the night. I was looking forward to sleeping but of course Sherlock figured something out at 3am and dragged me back to the warehouse to have a look. Turns out there was a hidden trapdoor behind a stack of boxes and inside, a couple of machines set up to print counterfeit bills!
He pushes the door open and for a moment all he sees is the flickering fire. Then he notices that the flowers from his experiment are missing. Instead the mantlepiece is lined with fresh roses, each in its own vase.
“Here,” says Sherlock, guiding John’s hand to a spot on the floor and John feels it - a small groove in the concrete. With a little difficulty they lift the camouflaged door up and peer inside. There are several steps leading down to a shallow basement.
But it also has a sense of being incomplete until you add one more to make a perfect dozen which has the meaning of “be mine”.
“Okay, okay.” Molly interrupts before he decides to deduce the probability of her getting some action tonight, “One last deduction and then you’re leaving.”
Instead John steps into the shower and closes his eyes as the water slides over his body. He contemplates sliding his hand downward but decides against it. The only thing more mortifying than waking up hard in his best friend’s bed would be having said best friend pick him up off the floor after his ankle gave out while wanking in the shower. So he turns the water as cold as he can stand and lets the icy sensation numb his body.
He nods at the fingernails. “I thought I could test the rate of disintegration in various fluids. Maybe I’ll write a monograph on the subject. I’ll need some phosphoric acid also.”
There are a few others with names like “Playboy” (a firey orange and yellow bloom) and “Passionate Kisses” (a delicate salmon colour), that make him blush to think about Sherlock in the same breath, but he realises that neither of these are the shade he’s looking for.
Also, if you watch Grey's Anatomy, that's where I got the whole lying under the Christmas tree thing. I've been doing it every year since I saw that episode and there really is something magical about it.
John searches his brain, a task that proves difficult as he feels the blood rushing to other parts of his anatomy.
John felt a twinge of guilt as he slipped down the side alley but then had to choke back a laugh as he heard Sherlock asking loudly when they were leaving as if he were a child being dragged along on a road trip. He considered waiting for the phone call, if only to keep up appearances, but recalled the potentially time-sensitive nature of the case and decided against it. He flagged down a cab one street over and arrived at the station just as Sherlock was being escorted out of the patrol car, in through the side door that led to the holding cells.
“You should call her,” Sherlock said, “the holidays are apparently supposed to be spent with family.”
“That’s because you’ve been complaining about John for two hours.” She says as she locks the cabinet.
John paces the perimeter of the room, keeping watch at the windows and stopping to listen near the door. Meanwhile, Sherlock is on his hands and knees, muttering about the relative thickness of dust. It doesn’t take long before John hears a soft shout of triumph and Sherlock calling his name.
“Can’t say the same of that young lad he’s accused of being with,” I continued, “Apparently the prosecution isn’t permitted to speak his name aloud in the courtroom due to his status.”
John took a steadying breath and started up the stairs, savoring the rich melody ahead of him and the way the air around him shivered with anticipation.
“Ten quid should do it,” Sherlock says in response. John sighs. It’s the last of his cash but he pulls out two five-pound notes and hands them over. As they round the corner Sherlock drops them into a homeless woman’s tin.
“Case,” he said without looking up, and pushed some packets of ice into the empty spaces in the freezer.
“It’s called ‘Elf on the Shelf’,” he replied, taking one down and examining it, “One of the mums at Rosie’s nursery school was talking about it.”
No sooner had these words left his mouth than the landlady appeared at the sitting room door with a card upon a tray. I glanced at it and did a double take. It wasn’t unusual for the aristocracy to seek assistance from my friend but I could not imagine what services the Marquess of Queensberry could require. The coincidence of his visit immediately following our discussion of his involvement in the Oscar Wilde trials was unsettling.
Once the last batch of gingerbread was finished baking, the three of them sat around the kitchen table amidst a mountain of sweets.
Sherlock shakes his head. “It could have been so much worse. If - if something had happened to you, I -” his voice trails off and he looks away, refusing to meet John’s eyes.
John handed him a piece of paper and Sherlock smiled as he read. Rosie had alternated between red and green crayon with each line. She’d insisted on writing the list on her own, he noticed - the faint pencil outlines that John used to write for her to trace were missing. Sherlock wasn’t familiar with the standard developmental milestones, but young Watson seemed ahead of the curve. He couldn’t help but feel a rush of pride as he read on.
Sherlock hands him the flower and steps aside so John can see past him into the bedroom. There are candles here too and the path of rose petals leads to the neatly made bed.
Hours pass slowly as they wade through the records and Sherlock agrees to accompany John for a walk when the rest of the team breaks to grab lunch. The cold air refreshes John a little and he leads Sherlock into a cafe where he orders a steaming bowl of soup and pretends not to notice when Sherlock steals all his crackers.
Mrs. Hudson adds these into the arrangement and shuffles them around the vase, making sure all the colours are evenly mixed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but Mycroft caught the fond smile on his face. Despite his apparent indifference to human emotions, Sherlock had always been the sensitive one in the family. No matter how many times Mycroft had tried to warn him that caring was not an advantage, Sherlock’s big heart and desire to be loved had always been his greatest weakness. Or so he’d thought. True, he had watched many times as Sherlock’s unconditional devotion to John Watson had almost destroyed him, but seeing them now, raising this child together, made Mycroft think that perhaps he’d been wrong after all.
John sighed. “It’s one of those confusing things, Sweetie. It’s...well, Sherlock likes puzzles. And that murder was a puzzle. He helped Uncle Greg find the bad guy.”
John goes to the kitchen and dries the dishes just to have something to do. There’s something bothering Sherlock. John knows it has something to do with what happened at Sherrinford, but every time he’d asked about it Sherlock had brushed him off, even going so far as retreating to Mycroft’s for hours on end. Perhaps it’s for the best, John had thought during the first of these excursions - Mycroft would be able to provide some much needed answers about their past, though John’s not sure he trusts him to be entirely truthful, especially now that he knows the lengths Mycroft took to shield Sherlock from his memories.
? He hadn’t gone anywhere. It was the voice that had left him in the first place. It had left him and then he stopped playing his violin and turned to the drugs. Or was it the other way around? Had he stopped playing first, or taken the drugs first?
Lestrade nods and turns back to his team. As he glances over his shoulder he sees Sherlock rest a hand protectively on John’s arm as the paramedic wraps a blood pressure cuff around the other.
He adds “social experiment” to his search but all he gets are videos of people standing on street corners giving roses to strangers and articles about wooing your date. He hits the back button and returns to his previous search. Several minutes later John finds himself perusing a horticultural directory. He scans the cultivar names looking for a corresponding image that matches the flower on their table but he can’t seem to find it. He breathes a sigh of relief when he sees that the few plants on the list which are named after actual people are nowhere near the same shade as the flower in front of him. Then he scolds himself - first, for being jealous of some hypothetical past lover, and second, for believing, even for a moment, that Sherlock would be that obvious.
He’d taken DI xxxxxxxx with him as a precaution, which is something he’d never have done before, and I later found out he didn’t even stop to examine the body - his first instinct was to pull Rosie away so she wouldn’t see it.
Queenberry stood, affronted and I rose from my seat as well, prepared to escort him out of the room by force if necessary. He glanced between Holmes and myself with a scowl then turned to me.
Months passed. Even amidst the rush of London the silence stretched on. John felt the absence of the music like a missing limb. His friends put it down to exhaustion. He had just started his residency program, which would be enough to wear anyone down. But John thought that he could manage if only he could hear the music again.
“Sure, sweetie,” John said, and shot Sherlock a look before he could say anything else about his brother.
When there was no case on hand, Sherlock resorted to texting him a sort of stream of consciousness that more often than not made John picture a web browser with a dozen different tabs open at the same time. Still, tonight’s texts seemed even more random than usual:
Of course Sherlock remembered. He filed everything about John carefully away in one room of his mind palace, painful though it might be sometimes.
Sherlock disappears into his mind palace for a while, only emerging when Lestrade slams a stack of papers down in frustration and exclaims, “It’s got to have something to do with the case. Why else would he have killed them?”
“It’s almost midnight,” John said in answer, “I’m surprised she didn’t wake you when we came down earlier. She wanted to show you her Christmas letter.”
Sherlock appears at his side immediately, checks that John’s ankle is elevated at the proper angle then looks at the clock and asks if he needs another dose of pain meds.
I apologize for my absence but my current inquiries are taking a bit longer than anticipated. Kindly help yourself to this excellent meal. I expect we will have little time to dine once I return.
He takes a breath. There’s no going back and maybe it’s selfish but he needs to say this as much for himself as for Sherlock.
Then of course, he had Molly in his life, so perceptive in her own way, always so good at observing the feelings people tried to keep hidden, even from themselves.
He bites back a moan and pulls himself out of bed. Usually when this happens he’s able to clear his head with a brisk walk, but the slight twinge in his left ankle tells him that’s not an option today.
They stood there, John staring up at him, Sherlock trying to deduce what he meant by it, but as always, John was the one person whose thoughts he couldn’t seem to read. He prayed that John couldn’t hear his heart beating double-time in his chest, hoped that if he noticed the flush in his cheeks, he’d attribute it to the heat from the fire.
How meeting him was like waking up, like learning to run again after sleepwalking through life. That he’s not a sociopath or a machine - and that being human is not a weakness, but his greatest strength. That they’ve been through so much together and they will make it through this. How much Rosie adores him. How glad John is to be back at 221B. That the world is a better place because Sherlock is in it.
Sherlock glanced out the window. As far as he was concerned, a night alone with John would be a far better way to spend the evening than filling their home with unnecessary people. At least this year it would only be Molly and Greg joining them. Mycroft had thankfully declined John’s invitation; they’d see him at Christmas anyway and that was more than enough.
When they arrive at an abandoned parking garage, Lestrade’s team has already done their initial sweep of the scene but Sherlock insists on having John examine the bodies. Lestrade sighs but allows John to confirm that the pair had most likely died of carbon monoxide inhalation from the sealed car they’d been found in.
John stopped mentioning the music to his father, learned to tune it out in his presence, but when he found himself alone he let the sounds wash over him, taking comfort in the way the gentle breeze seemed to find and speak to him.
Molly looks up from the brain she’s examining. Sherlock is leaning back against the counter with his arms crossed, looking for all the world like a pouting child.
relevant, you know,” said a voice behind them, and John turned to see a disgruntled Sherlock being led by a guard who somehow managed to look simultaneously annoyed and amused.
I still don’t know how you go around the whole world in one night. Daddy says it’s magic and Sherlock told me that it is different times at different places in the world so you can visit them all. If you could tell me I would like that.
Sorry, not much fluff in this chapter, but we’ll get back to it. They still need to finish their conversation after all ;)
“Nah, it’s no trouble.” Lestrade says, “I’ve been feeling a bit guilty to be honest - it’s not your job to be chasing down criminals and yet you’re the one laid up in here.” He holds up a hand as John opens his mouth to protest. “Besides, I had to come down and remind Sherlock to give us his statement since he’s refusing to answer his phone.”
The next day there’s no new rose on the table when John makes his way into the kitchen. It’s hard to tell initially with the small army of roses in various beakers and jars but he counts and confirms that there are still only eleven flowers, same as yesterday.
“Oh, it was.” Sherlock leaned back in his seat. “But even that lot should be able to figure it out now that they’re in there.”
Hope you all had a happy Christmas! I'll still be updating regularly even though these chapters will be a bit after the fact now that Christmas is over. Thanks for following along!
They made their way to the towering spruce tree in the corner. The upper branches were draped with garlands but the lower ones were hung with colorful baubles that each of the children had decorated the week before. They searched for Rosie’s and eventually found the glittery silver orb facing the window as though the bright red flower Rosie had drawn on it was reaching for the setting sun.
“The key, Watson. He needed a key to get in. Ghosts don’t exist and if they did they wouldn’t need keys to enter a house for the dead.” He seemed to be trying to convince himself as much as he was trying to reassure me.
Of course, he knew ignoring Sherlock wouldn’t work for long and sure enough, a steady stream of text alerts punctuated the conversation as they worked their way through the appetiser sampler.
“Sherlock, I’ve got to leave soon or I’ll be late. Just go Bart’s and try not to drive Molly mad. I’ll see you tonight.”
John sees tears glimmering in the corner of Sherlock’s eyes. His hands are curled into tight fists around the blanket as though trying to hold onto reality.
"One meaning of the orange rose is fascination. When you are totally besotted and completely bewitched by somebody, send them an orange rose." [
“What?” Sherlock shrugs with feigned innocence, “Geoff’s not stupid enough to actually arrest me. Besides, it’s not really me he’s angry at. He’s just upset he had to cancel his date last night.”
heyhey! it's finally done! sorry for the massive delay but thanks for sticking with me and these two idiots :)
“Not what I meant,” Greg muttered but took Rosie’s hand and watched as Sherlock disappeared into the thicket of trees.
John should have known better and just booked a room ahead of time. It would have made this whole thing a lot less awkward.
“So, both banks were hit with a high volume of counterfeit bills!” Lestrade exclaims. “Look! These two cases are connected. Whoever this ‘Evans’ is, he’s either the counterfeiter or a key player.”
“Of course. She was annoyed because you couldn’t spend the night since we had to leave early the next morning.”
“I suppose,” he said after several minutes, “I could try doing something that even the me in your mind would never do. Would that convince you?”
Mrs. Hudson would be there too, of course, but she would probably head back downstairs by 9. And with the combination of alcohol and the supposed “magic” of the holidays, there was a 87 percent chance that Molly and Greg would leave early to enjoy each others’ company. But then that would leave him alone with John and all the things still left unsaid between them.
“I don’t want things to stay the way they are. I want more than this. More than spending my days with you, knowing that you might leave. More than spending my nights imagining things that will never happen. I want to be more than Rosie’s godfather and your best friend. And I want more than to look at you and know that you’ll never want me the same way.”
“Hush, Watson. There is much I need to do. I believe you mentioned a patient you had to see this afternoon. Perhaps now would be a good time to attend to him. If you will be good enough to meet me here for supper I would be most grateful for your company.
“We’ll be there in seven minutes,” Sherlock says. He hangs up and sweeps out the door. John drops some money on the table to cover the bill before rushing after him.
Also, I really struggled with whether to include the bits about suicide, but in the end it fit with the case. That being said, no matter how bad things seem, there is always another option. You are important. You matter. If you or someone you know are ever considering suicide, please talk to someone.
It was a rhetorical question and when Sherlock didn’t answer, John took his silence as permission to enter.
end up solving it. You probably didn’t notice thanks to John’s inability to write a decent blog post.
John shifts uncomfortably. An image he hasn’t seen since Sherlock entered his life rises unbidden to his mind - a loaded gun in a bedside table - not protection, but a quick and easy escape. There were nights back then, after Afghanistan, when he’d done more than just think idly about the possibility of oblivion. There were nights, when things got really bad, that he’d found himself lying awake, staring at the ceiling debating what method would be the least painful for him and the least trouble for the people he'd leave behind. He hadn’t exactly had a plan, but given a few more months...
Blue rose meaning: A tantalizing vision that cannot be totally pinned down, a mystery that cannot be fully unraveled. Since the blue rose itself is a rarity in nature, it stands for something that is hardly within one's grasp. Thus the blue rose is admired and revered as an unrealizable dream.[
When they arrive at Baker Street, John is grateful for Sherlock’s help up the stairs. The meds they gave him at the hospital are wearing off and he feels a dull throbbing in his ankle and a faint headache beginning to form. When they reach the landing John glances wearily at the stairs that lead up to his bedroom but Sherlock steers him forcefully down the hall to his own room. He all but lifts John into the bed then whisks out of the room. He returns minutes later, arms full of supplies - a bottle of painkillers, water, an extra pillow and an ice pack.
The previous night his father destroyed all his tapes of classical music saying that it was time for John to man the fuck up and stop listening to that pansy ass nonsense.
The loud scraping of the chair against the floor rouses Sherlock. He glances over at John who wills his body not to betray him and forces himself to maintain eye contact for what he hopes is long enough to allay suspicion. After a few seconds Sherlock rises and crosses to the kitchen. He reaches into the throng of flowers, extracts a new one - yellow with orange stripes, and places it on the desk in front of John with a smile.
Sherlock tried again, trying to imitate John’s stance and focusing on the placement of his feet, but the blades on his skates didn’t seem to want to stay parallel and he stumbled over to the side once more.
“Oh, come on.” Sherlock said, seeing their blank looks. “Carolers ring the doorbell. People disable their alarm system, open the door and stand at the front of the house while they sing two, maybe three songs. Then, depending on their level of holiday spirit, stand there chatting for another 5 minutes.”
John lays a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and feels him lean into his touch. This is new too, the way Sherlock seems to crave physical contact, though John can’t say if this has more to do with the aftermath of their reconciliation or whether it’s Sherlock’s way of affirming the reality of the world around him.
Then he remembers the circumstances under which Sherlock set out his yellow rose. The declined dinner invitation of the day prior, Sherlock’s sulking response to John’s admiration of the flower and his subsequent uptick in mood when John admitted to liking the orange rose better.
Instead he focused on chemistry and logic, only diving into his music to explore the strange connection he seemed to have formed with a mysterious friend who existed only in his mind.
They both looked at him, John with visible relief and Cynthia with annoyance. John nodded and placed a hand on Sherlock’s arm, pointing to the seats in the third row near the aisle.
“You’ve met before but she was more acquaintance than friend. You’ve not seen each other in years so she’s either just moved back to London or is visiting for a short while,” Sherlock said, “Other than that, there are too many variables. You’re clearly in a hurry so you might as well answer my questions so you can get on with getting off.”
Sherlock takes Rosie to the Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park and helps Greg chase down a lead on his missing person case.
He waited and Sherlock placed both hands in John’s. Even through their gloves he imagined he could feel a bit of warmth.
“So, let’s go over this again,” he said once they had returned to Stella's office, "some of the houses were broken into but nothing was taken."
The church behind Rosie’s nursery school was covered with a thin sprinkling of snow, making it look like something out of a Christmas card. Rosie herself was dressed up in her costume - a floor-length burgundy robe with a gold sash and a headpiece adorned with plastic jewels.
Halfway through his last year of medical school John noticed a change in the music. There was a stretch of melancholy, a chaotic crescendo, a flash of brilliance, then silence.
Sherlock smiled but didn’t answer. He always seemed to gravitate toward this melody when he was thinking about John, to the point that he’d begun to think of it as John’s song. It contained all the things he wanted to say but could never put into words.
As Lestrade’s team departs, Sherlock grabs John’s sleeve and leads him down several alleys. They walk in silence until they reach a row of old storefronts where Sherlock spends 20 minutes circling a closed up locksmith’s business then hails a cab to New Scotland Yard without explanation.
When he descends the stairs he can’t help the way his heart beats a little faster seeing Sherlock standing before the mirror fixing his collar. John feels an urge to run his hands through the perfectly arranged curls. Sherlock’s eyes meet his in the mirror.
John shook his head. “Dad made it clear that he wouldn’t have any of that under his roof. Our Aunt Jo brought her girlfriend ‘round to the house when she was in town a few years before and they had a big row about it. He said she was a bad influence for Harry and me and basically told her to sod off. ‘Course it didn’t matter by then.”
Sherlock led the way into the trees, stopping every so often to peer at the ground or poke around in the bushes. Meanwhile, Rosie skipped along beside Greg, telling him about all the things she wanted to see at the Winter Wonderland.
Sherlock disappeared into the kitchen to check on his latest experiment - something to do with the strength and density of icicles infused with various substances.
When he wakes for real, the first thing he notices is the empty chair beside his bed. He feels a bit abandoned until he hears Sherlock’s voice on the other side of the closed door. No doubt he’s harassing the nurses making sure John is treated like royalty or trying to get someone to violate hospital policy and ignore the rule that only family gets information. John knows he should feel bad for the hospital staff but can’t keep from smiling as he lays back against the pillows, allowing Sherlock’s voice to wash over him. He’s never felt as safe as he does with this man watching over him. Surely, he thinks, that must mean something to Sherlock too.
“Oh please, they’re in an album somewhere. I’m sure my mother would be happy to show you, but it’s not that exciting. I was adorable, Mycroft was fat. The photographer made us stand in the same position while he took an unnecessary number of photos that all looked the same.”
“Holmes!” I reached for my companion, pulling him out of the way as the lights continued their dance and a pack of carriages surged forward. “Where on earth are we?”
“Around the other edge of this,” Sherlock said, gesturing at the Winter Wonderland festivities around them.
Just as John is slipping off to sleep Sherlock speaks, so softly that John wonders if he’s meant to hear, “I could never forget you, John.” Sherlock’s voice breaks and he continues, “but someday you’ll leave and I’ll wish I could.”
Still, I feel compelled to set this story down, if only as an attempt to make sense of the confusing series of life-altering events that transpired. Certain precautions have been taken in the intervening years and Sherlock Holmes has assented to let me recount the case for my personal files, though only after I swore that it would never be published. On that account he should not have to worry, as my days of serializing our adventures in the Strand are long gone.
There’s no way he could afford the house in the suburbs on his own even if he wanted to stay there, which he doesn’t. Even before everything that had happened with Mary, that place had never truly felt like home and John knows the years he spent there were just marking time. It’s only when he finally settles Rosie in his old room, surrounded by a small menagerie of soft toys that he feels like he’s back where he belongs.
Pain ripped through John’s shoulder. Gunfire continued to erupt around him. As if from underwater he heard Bill Murray’s voice, felt strong hands holding pressure, keeping him from bleeding out. People surrounded him, shouting orders, telling him to stay with them. But it all felt dull in comparison with the music encircling him, wrapping him in love from a stranger he would never meet.
She laughed, “I can try talking to John next time he comes by to drop off Rosie alone, but you’ll need to talk to Sherlock.”
“Nothing unusual. Just Christmas dinner. You know Father likes Christmas carols so we were forced to listen to him humming off-key for the entire month of December. Mummy would usually make me play something on the violin to drown him out after a few days. And I’ve already told you about the ridiculous family photos and Mycroft’s gingerbread mansions.”
“John, before you, I never had a reason to think someone could appreciate me for anything other than my work. When Mike introduced us, I asked you to move in because I thought it was what we both needed, but -” he looked up into John’s eyes, “I never imagined you would stay.”
Sherlock gave him a few minutes to get dressed, added an extra minute to account for any indecision in date attire, then followed him up and took a seat on the bed. John examined his reflection in the mirror as he buttoned his shirt.
“I can think of no way to help the unfortunate Mr. Wilde. But cheer up, dear boy. It seems we have a client. Let us pray he has something interesting for us.”
“‘There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book’.” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat together over breakfast one morning at Baker Street.
Annoyed, Sherlock tossed the box aside and flung himself down on the couch. He’d hoped John would be around to bounce ideas off of but he’d been upstairs with Rosie since Sherlock returned. Something about writing a letter to Santa. If he concentrated he could hear her laughter and John’s soft voice. Sherlock let his eyes slide closed and he let himself imagine, not for the first time, that this little family was all that mattered in the world.
At midnight Lestrade sends his team home, but Sherlock won’t budge. Eventually Lestrade finds a couple of spare blankets and John helps him set up a camp bed in his office before returning to the conference room and curling up on the sofa.
Sherlock waves a hand casually. “I’m getting there. But I do know that the man was a long-time mechanic who had been working as a locksmith for the past year. He lived alone and was recently low on funds which is probably why he took on a large mechanical job shortly before his death. He drank too much but tried to keep up appearances so he could maintain visiting rights with his children from a failed marriage.”
“You see, John, my dislike of Christmas carols is justified,” said Sherlock. Then he turned on his heel and swirled out of the room. John chuckled, bade Stella goodnight and followed in his wake.
John reached around him to straighten one of the baubles on the tree and Sherlock felt his breath catch in his throat as their arms brushed. Everything about this holiday season made him long for something more, despite how dangerous he knew it was to hope. But even after John had finished adjusting the ornament, he didn’t pull away.
In desperation Sherlock turned to his music but the connection had dimmed. His ‘friend’, for lack of a better word, seemed to have moved on, or at the very least, had found someone else to confide in. So when a young man called Wiggins offered him a way to escape, he reached without hesitation for the needle.
But that night after Rosie is in bed, the unspoken question hangs between them until John leads the way into the bedroom, makes a show of pulling back the covers for Sherlock, then slides in beside him.
“What?” said Sherlock, “Sleeping together? You have an odd definition of habit - we’ve only done that once before.”
“Sorry?” I asked, emerging from the newspaper article that had caught my attention for the past quarter of an hour. It was May of 1895 and it seemed the entire population of London was swept up in the ongoing trials of Oscar Wilde.
Every morning John wakes first and waits. As Sherlock stirs, John brushes his fingers lightly down his arm and gives his hand a gentle squeeze. Sherlock wraps his fingers around John’s wrist to feel his steady, if slightly elevated, pulse while John whispers all the things he wants Sherlock to remember when waking:
“Of course,” Mrs. Hudson continues, “I didn’t know until later that was how his associates paid him sometimes - hiding money in the wrappings. Pity he always took it out before giving them to me.”
travels through time has yet to be confirmed but perhaps I'll find out when I'm in London for a visit next month ;)
Sherlock falls silent again, picks up one of the menu inserts, and begins folding it as John tries to process the meaning behind his words.
John smiled. This was one of the many things he’d learned after he and Rosie moved back to Baker Street. Of course, he’d known Sherlock could waltz ever since those lessons before his wedding to Mary, but it wasn’t until they spent Christmas at the Holmes family house that John learned that his friend had been quite a talented ballet dancer in his teen years.
When the noise persists he ventures downstairs and enters through the kitchen, hoping he won’t have to play peacemaker. Sherlock is slumped in his chair like a petulant child, drawing his bow across the strings erratically, creating a frenzied maelstrom of sound. Mycroft is standing near the fireplace, umbrella in hand, glaring down at his younger brother. John admires Mycroft’s willpower not to fling his hands over his ears, an impulse he’s currently fighting. Instead he settles for preparing a cup of tea and hopes he can slip back upstairs before getting dragged into whatever problem Mycroft is here about.
The music settled into a slow melody of wavering tears and John remained there until the wind quieted itself to a gentle breeze that stayed with him as he walked home.
Sherlock scrambled up to sitting and opened his mouth to apologize but John shook his head and nodded toward Rosie, then stood and led the way downstairs so they could talk without waking her.
They each go about their own business for the rest of the day but at 6:00 pm sharp, Sherlock disappears into his room to get ready. John retreats upstairs to do the same and is struck by the odd sense that he’s preparing for a date. Which is ridiculous of course. They’ve gone out to dinner together like this countless times.
“So just the two of you. Like old times, yes?” Angelo smiled, “I will bring something for you. Make the evening more special.”
John shook his head. “I don’t mind. I would have let you sleep, but I just...well, it’s still early. I thought maybe we could talk?”
About halfway down the page there was a scribbled blob, covering up some words, that might have passed for a drawing of an avalanche or a sideways christmas tree depending on how you looked at it.
But with Sherlock none of the old rules apply. Going out to dinner is more or less the same as it was before except now when Angelo places a candle on their table John smiles and reaches for Sherlock’s hand. There is the walk home of course - wandering through the twisting streets of London hand in hand, and stolen kisses under the moonlight. But when they return to Baker Street there’s no lingering on the doorstep - they simply climb the stairs together laughing.
Some nights were best spent chasing criminals down darkened streets, but others were best spent like this - side by side on his bed drinking holiday tea while imagining the taste of peppermint on John’s lips.
Sherlock shrugged and went back to assembling the base of Rosie’s house while she selected the candies she wanted to use.
John smiled at the sound of his name, but at the same time, he seemed to be wavering on the precipice of a decision. He swallowed and his eyes flicked toward the glow of the streetlights streaming in through the window before he settled his gaze back on Sherlock.
Lestrade returns with two cups of coffee, a crease in his brow and dark circles under his eyes. He hands one of the cups to John and snatches a half-folded paper from Sherlock’s hands. “Sherlock, stop that or I’ll have you arrested.”
John makes his way up the stairs. Sherlock had just wrapped up a case the day before and said he wanted a date night to celebrate. He’d sent John down to talk to Lestrade in his place while he got things ready but offered no hints about what the night would entail other than saying he wanted it to be ‘special’.
“But where did he go?” I repeated. There had been no side tunnels, I was sure of it and yet here we were at a dead end, alone.
Thanks for the reminder! Got to remember to make reservations for me and the wife. How about you, John? Got a date this year, Casanova?
“Maybe you could play something a bit more festive,” John said, “it’s supposed to be a party, after all.”
“And if I hadn’t come to find you, where would you be now?” John asks, trying desperately not to think of that possibility.
Now it’s John’s turn to try to catch Sherlock’s eyes as the latter stares at a large crack in the concrete.
As always, thanks for reading! And extra thanks to those of you who left comments and kudos. Love you all <3
Sherlock reached down to grab the plastic bag of his belongings still clutched in John’s right hand, slid his mobile out and began scrolling through the messages before handing the bag and the rest of its contents back to John.
John sets the peach rose among its fellows and bites into one of the muffins, savoring the warm center and juicy blueberries. Sherlock seems to be contemplating something as he sips his tea. As John helps himself to a second pastry Sherlock speaks.
Finally, one night about two weeks after moving back, John comes downstairs after checking on Rosie to find Sherlock perched on his chair, knees hugged to his chest, staring into the dying fire.
“How many times must I tell you, once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.”
He had hoped, at least, to find a friend but London was just as lonely with nothing to calm his racing mind. There was too much to take in - so many mysteries to solve, but also so much tedium.
John glances at where Sherlock is lying stretched out on the sofa and realizes that the shirt hugging his slim frame is an almost identical shade as today’s rose. Sherlock’s eyes are closed so John allows his gaze to sweep up and down his still form. Sock-clad feet brush against one armrest, freshly washed curls spill over the other. His elegant fingers are tented below his chin - most likely he’s filing the details of yesterday’s case away in his mind palace.
Sherlock takes the long route home. He doesn’t see a reason to rush. John has been acting oddly for the past two days, slipping out of the flat alone for hours at a time. Normally it was easy enough to deduce where he’d gone but John had strayed from his normal patterns. He’d even taken to wiping his internet search history. Sherlock sighs and thinks that perhaps John had managed to get a last minute Valentine’s date after all. He wraps his coat tighter around himself and takes another unnecessary detour.
