“We can share a room I don’t mind.”
“Well…”
“It was going to be a ”
It took everything to keep the smile off his face but Sherlock saw right through that.
"I want to go home!" She cried as she made it look like she was struggling to keep the chair over her head. "I'll have that please." A blond man said evenly as he walked into the room and pulled the chair out of her hands. "Oh you poor child! You don't have to be scared! We aren't going to hurt you! Oh I know! How about a compromise! I'll take you to Lucian but you aren't going home...how about it?" The mad man crooned gently as he pat her on the head. "I want my brother and I want to go home!" she cried as the man placed an arm around her shoulders and guided her towards the door. "It will be alright, Come on now I'll take you to him."
"SHERLOCK!" came a feminine shout of joy as everyone dropped their bags. Lily struggled not to laugh as she saw her father try to hide behind John. "Oh come here and let me look at you!" The older woman cried as she forcefully dragged the detective out of hiding. "You've gained weight since I last saw you! And also…oh…hello." The woman stopped and stared at the five people in the room. "And who might you all be? Mycroft don't be rude!" She snapped, noticing the elder brother trying to slide out of the room.
right to speak to them without a barrister present or a consenting parent.” John said as he stood up.
"But...The man...he survived by eating insects and using leaves as an insulator to his clothing...But...The violin..." He finally responded then dropped onto his chair in defeat.
“Hello there you must be the Holmes children. Good afternoon I’m Julia Verone. You can call me Julia. Now please have a seat and we can get started.” She smiled then watched as both twins sat down then simply stared at her.
"I don't know I kind of like the idea of eveyone knowing you're taken."
Every word spoken was like a knife in John's heart. Sherlock's words of being useless ringing in his ears as he meekly gave a nod of his head and walked out the flat.
The next morning john woke to find Sherlock still wrapped around him, snoring lightly in his ear. This must be so exhausting for him John thought to himself as the man in question snuffled lightly against his neck. "Time?" the detective rumbled as he cuddled into john.
“Girl I consider anyone who saved my life more than once a friend.”
Any ideas for the sequel are more than welcome The first chapter will be about the twins birthday...cause it was asked of me...

Greg stood in the middle of the living room clad only in a towel. A white towel. A white towel that did not look secure. An unsecure towel that looked dangerously close to falling off.
That night Lily crept into Lucian's room and shook the lump beneath the blanket. "It's all done" she whispered making him chuckle. "Yea, you got your gizmo and I got my ear talked off by a criminal mastermind… I wonder what it's like to be normal."
John was pretty sure that it he didn't get Sherlock to stop he was going to die…or explode. Fortunately he was able to pull the detective back up his body to kiss him with everything he had; eliciting one of the most pornographic moans he has ever heard. "GOD JAWN!" the detective growled and began to rut against the blogger beneath him. . "Sh-sh-sherlock…Oh god…I-I-I want…." John stuttered and panted as he wrapped his legs around his waist. This caused Sherlock to pause.
Lily grinned at that, Mrs. Hudson always knew what was going on in her head.

"Donovan?"
From: Blond Sniper
Next Thursday
Sherlock turned and before John could say anything replied to the insulting man. "Sir if anything, Scotland is the Canada of England."
"Sherlock…Dad, we've never worried about…well THAT with you and John." Lucian rasped after he stopped giggling. "And I'm still sorry about throwing things at you and yelling at you." He whispered and sent his father a pleading look.
John gave a laugh at that, knowing his fiance's disdain for ties. "Alright lets times up!" Lucian smiled as he came running into the room with a wide grin on his face making John smile at the sight of the two twins together.
This story is currently under revision and will be published under the name Accidental Daddy Take Two.
Lily and Lucian sat on the couch staring blindly at the television. They had already explored every inch of the wing they were allowed in and were very bored. "Alright I've had enough of this." Lily said as she pulled herself off the couch. "Where are you going?" Her brother asked immediately curious. "I'm going to go and make my own fun…" She smiled evilly before heading out the door.
"Canada!"
“About you not having any rights to the kids because you aren’t a biological parent or spouse.”
"Really?" lily sneered as she stepped over the unconscious man only to sprint through the restaurant kitchen ignoring the shouts of horror and the demands to stop the followed her until she got onto the street.
“While that is true, what I was
"What is going on you ask? I was just informed by my dear brother that those two children sitting on the couch just happen to by my BIOLOGICAL offspring." He yelled at his blogger who then paled. "What's more is that he knew about them for…oh I'm sorry what was it again? Five years?" He snarled lunging for his brother only to be held back by his flat-mate.
_._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._._.
"Exactly Mycroft we would rather not scar them for life."
“How do you plan on doing that? I can’t exactly pop out a kid Sherlock.”
Sherlock, John and Greg were sitting at the (surprisingly clean) kitchen table having tea when the children came down stairs. "You called oh mighty overlord?" Lily snarked at her father making John smile.
Coming to realize how much I miss you and your brother I am reconcedering my action to give you to Mr. Holmes for such a small price. After all you are both priceless and I am your mother after all. I raised you two and as your mother I have custodial rights and demand to be able to see you and Lucern. Plese make sure that Mycroft is there as well. Be a dear and pass the news onto him would you? I'll be by tomorrow around noon to come and fetch you and your brother
"Yes I am now as a Detective Inspector I hereby demand you dance a song with me then take me home to take advantage of me...which I will thoroughly enjoy. Understood sir?"
"I believe they are testing their boundaries which I have done a time or two…" Sherlock muttered comfortingly to his blogger. "I say we sell them to the Chinese…cheap labor and all that." John groaned as Sherlock started stroking his back. "Ha…Other than that how was your day?" Sherlock asked as John snuggled impossibly closer.
"WHAT?" came a yell from the other room making the army doctor jump up from his seat as Sherlock came barreling in. "Sherlock calm down!" Mycroft yelled at his younger brother and grabbed his arm only to be shaken off.
Unfortunately their contentment at being back with their fathers was short lived as they could hear whispering coming from the door.
"Yes Madame?" the flight attendant asked in the face of the woman's scowl.
Halfway through the class riddled with homophobic remarks Lucian jumped as a small piece of paper fell onto his open text book. Inside it contained a single word.
“Sherlock how are we…?”
"John the only person I would think about doing something like that with is you. Which makes the whole celebration thing pointless if my sources are correct."
John walked into 221b with a smile on his face. That smile then fell when he took in the chaos inside.
Mrs. Hudson squealed at that and clapped her hands. “Oh! That’s just spectacular! Where is the baby?!” She laughed then blinked rapidly as John pointed to the twins. “Oh, that’s even better! Hello you two! I’m Mrs. Hudson Sherlocks landlady and aren’t you two just precious!”
"What's a loch?"
I catch my breath with just one beating heart
John sighed and placed a hand on Sherlocks shoulder, only to be pushed off. "Sherlock I didn't say that."
~~__~~!
Sherlock stared at his fleeing flat mate before turning his attention towards his offspring. "So what do you wish to watch?" He asked then frowned at the knowing look in their eyes. "I chose the last movie we watched…Lily-lie?" Lucian asked sending her a look. "Err…I know I heard about the dead poets society and with was supposed to be a really good movie…with Robin Williams last I knew he was a comedian…" Lily smiled at her father and elbowed her brother into agreeing with her. "Yea…Robin Williams is hilarious…" He said then hunkered down to quietly chat with his twin.
“They don’t say but I always found it helpful.” John remarked as he watched Lucian agonize over sketchbooks.
Thankfully they were close to the house and the twins and dog were let out of the confinement of the car. "Hey Lil, I have a question." Greg remarked as they were getting the bags out of the boot of the car. "And the question would be?" Lily asked as she grabbed her suitcase and looked up at the Detective Inspector. "Why did you name the dog Gladstone? I heard that you told Sherlock that you chose the name specifically but never said why."
"You're a weirdo."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
over four thousand words.... lots happening...I suck at summaries also Scottish joke stolen from a scot...
"When are you leaving?"
Lily and Lucian looked at each other. The man was obviously scared of the 'big house' and they did not want to frighten him. "No No big house...water?" Lucian asked as he patted his throat in the universal sign of thirsty.
What surprised them most was the fact that there seemed to be no one else in the building. It was just empty room after empty room until they finally found the front door.
“I think we should get married.”
Two: No one would willingly watch them as Mycroft was out of the country, Greg was with him and Mrs. Hudson was off visiting her sister.
"I don't think I have ever seen Sherlock this happy." Greg smiled absentmindedly as he leaned into Mycroft who just showed up. Both were watching the two drunks sway together in an imitation of a dance.
John and Sherlock looked at each other and the detective gave the army doctor a nod. "Alright. You win." He said before wrapping his kids in his arms. Though he tried he knew that he cannot save them from what was going on in their minds.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Tried to eat Lucian”
With this Mycroft turned to give Greg a considering look. "What of her?"
He opened the door to find Sherlock standing on the other side, dripping wet. 'Oh hell no' John thought as he moved to slam the door closed.
Lily may be many things but stupid is not one of them so she ran. Only it seemed that ever five or six strides apart another bullet was shot only to explode right behind her. This made her uneasy, so she ducked into one of the alley ways to think about what was happening.
"Are you alright you look a little…" Greg trailed off not knowing the word he wanted to use.
When his vision cleared the first view he had was of the ground between his feet. Greg had pressed his head between his knees.
Squeeze.
Mycroft sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Mummy…these are his children and John is his lover…you can even run DNA tests if you still don't believe."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
are waiting outside."
"What in god's name were you two thinking? I mean in the last week you two have put glycerin in the fountains, switched the lavatory signs, covered Tinsdales car with Post-its and somehow managed to put lockers in front of his office! What were you doing?" John asked evenly which scared the twins more than shouting ever could.
"Are you expecting someone?" John asked as he popped his head out of the kitchen. "No John I am not expecting company but its only my brother. Make him go away." Came the response from the detective on the couch who was trying very hard to be a chameleon and blend into the sofa.
“Two days ago I was approached by a woman named Lavonia Kingsdale. She explained that she had given birth to your twins and after a rather thorough DNA test it was confirmed. Congratulations Sherlock. You’re a father.”
"They can't be in here!" came Andersons snarl as they passed by Donovan's desk. Sherlock turned to find the ME perched on his lover's desk. "Oh and you suggest I leave them home unattended?" He remarked lifting one brow at the man. "I think this is Anderson." Lily whispered to her brother and they stepped back to watch the show. "Leave them with a friend…oh wait you don't have any friends besides your pet" Anderson snarled triumphantly but Sherlock only huffed a breath at him. "Do you have any kids?" Lily asked suddenly making him jump. "no…why?" Anderson asked suspicious of the girl in front of him.
But what surprised Sherlock was not the fact that they dressed as differently from each other. It was the fact that they had almost identical facial features and the way they stood as close as possible to one another meant that they were most definitely related.
________________________________________
“What?!” Came the indignant cry from under the table where the detective was no doubt pretending to clean.
Yep :) See you tomorrow
"Why...I have to get to John, I have to apologize." Sherlock sounded as lost and confused as a child.
"It's a small hamlet in the highland.
“But some people”
“Why thank you John! I speak two languages, English and bad English.”
The twins flinched at the shriek and started to back up slowly, hands clasped. "Their mother isn't in their lives and if I have my way she never will be again and I don't care how this looks they are MINE and nothing you can say or do will change that fact." Sherlock growled even as his head snapped back as if his mother had slapped him. "nonsence Sherlock every child needs their mother and to be honest you wouldn't make a good father, you can't even take care of yourself. Now sweeting where is your mother?"
When Sebastian and Lily walked into his office he had her sit down. "Alright I've had enough of this fight between the two of you. Now you will end this fight or I swear I will lock you both in your rooms and you won't come out." Jim snarled at the twins who stared at him.
Greg sighed, not liking what he was going to have to do.
"What is it with you two? Of course I approve of her!" Amalee shrieked. "Really? Then why did you not correct her? After all it was you who taught me that not deigning is just like agreeing with a statement." He retorted and swept from the room. "Amalee, come into the sitting room, now." He heard his father say making him smile a little. Perhaps Trymman finally took of the blinders concerning his wife.
Lily was walking home from school when suddenly the wall next to her exploded. What was that? She thought and ever her father’s daughter she walked over to investigate. Bullet hole? She pondered when another hit the wall to her left.
“Since when has Sherlock had kids?”
Lucian sighed and sat down next to her, placing an arm across her shoulders. "And how do you break out of a gilded caged Lily?"
~~__~~
Salcone Destrivina
"Do I want to know?"
"Right, he did a project on electrical current and how you can modify it too...OH!"
I have done the same thing only with a baby squirrel...his name was Squeekers and i managed to hide him from my parents for at least a week before they found out...and they didn't 'find out' so much as 'baby squirrel ran up my fathers leg'... My dad let me keep him though! he was so cute!
Sherlock shrugged as he sat down on the couch and pulled his lover into his lap. "No idea. But there isn't any explosive of any kind in that machine. So it's safe and the fog is non-toxic." He murmured and started to kiss down John's jugular vein.
Had to take away his phone and unplug the hotels phone
John and Sherlock sat up from the couch, their lips red and swollen from their obvious snogging session. “Alright the main thing to remember is that it wasn’t my fault.” Lily began with making them frown.
"Hey Sebastian." Lily said as she walked into his room. "What are you doing?" She asked as she sat down right next to one of his guns and to her credit didn't flinch or even acknowledge its existence. "I'm cleaning my weapons."
John left the group of Holmes's and walked forward to join the small group of men standing next to the coffin. He then joined them in lifting the coffin up to shoulder height and carrying it into the Church where the priest was waiting.
"Who was the kid?" Sherlock suddenly asked making them blink. "Carey said his name…Kyle something or other…."Lucian remarked. "Yea Kyle…Lestrades kid we were talking about it when Carey was talking with you." Lily remarked.
John stood silent and stared at the coffin. His eyes never leaving the sole white rose that adorned the mahogany wood. at the moment he wasn't grieving, he wasn't anything. He was just numb as they lowered the coffin into the ground. He didn't hear the priest as he droned on about his uncle Shamus. He didn't even realized when the people who came to mourn the man silently dispersed.
"Mmm."
The bed was empty and there were no clothes in the closet. But there was a trace of John's cologne on the pillow. "He left?"
“If you don’t know by now…” John smiled making Sherlock grumble.
She too spoke Greek at them.
to say is that it’s probably a good idea to let other people know about the twins. Just so this doesn’t happen again.”
She had found a toggle switch and insulated copper wire in a random supply closet at the end of the hall and ran into the garden.
"Now, we three have talked this through and wish to make it known to all of you that the only reason you are not grounded for an Infinite amount of time is that you were fighting In defense of someone, namely Lucian. Now normally you all would be in horrible trouble for engaging In...Well In a brawl. But In this case we're letting it go. Honestly we can't really punish any of you for doing something that we, ourselves, would do."
"Yes love?"
“And those Barristers”
? or the security guard who decided to tell two impressionable teenagers to break the law for his own amusement?” Sherlock interjected as he leaned back and steepled his fingers. He had drawn the metaphorical line in the sand. Now all that remains to be seen is if they would toe the line or just jump over it with both feet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yea he did." Lucian said then winced as Lily elbowed him.
"See I told you it would get their attention!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“No, I want to talk to this security guard who told my children that they could only go someplace if they broke into it themselves.”
"Music and Calculus."
Lily rolled her eyes and waited for her brother to put on his shoes. "You got everything?"
"Unless we wanted too"
"Sorry."
Sherlock thought for a moment before giving a nod of his head.
Chapter 43 DE PLANE DE PLANE!
Mycroft was having a lovely conversation with his father and brother when he leaned over to grab his tea cup and take a sip…only to spit it out all over the table. "Mycroft? Really?" Amalee scoffed as he dabbed at his mouth then turned an accusatory eye on his brother. "Don't look at me Mycroft, you are the one who gave Lily the tea…and the tray." He smiled making his father laugh. "I saw her playing with the sweeteners but I didn't see her switch the cups!" He laughed making her blush and his eldest son scowl. "Why is it always my cup?"
"Yes..."
Sherlock laughed at Johns glare and growl. "Come John"
"Experiments-"
No I kid I'm not that mean it continues…haha
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Hey John?"
This was going to be a huge mess. All he wanted was to get the two settled in a bit before Lestrade and the others poked their noses into the children's lives. "No we know that you kidnapped them because who in their right mind would let the freak and his boyfriend babysit their children?" Sally snarled making the twins blink.
Lily sat by the waterfall and using a flat screwdriver, gently pried apart the disposable camera. She noted where the Electrolytic Capacitor was located before she rewound the film back into its spool.
"Uh huh, so random question, which one of you is older?" John asked sincerely.
"You mean sleeping on the lube." John said and watched as Sherlock blushed again. John never knew that Sherlock could blush so much and aimed to keep making the man do it over and again. At least until his face was permanently red.
John had been waiting for them to come back and walked over to sit in his chair, he looked over and the puppy was still asleep in Sherlocks chair, snoring lightly. Nice now the stage is set.
"Lily! Lucian!" Sherlock called up the stairs as they entered the flat and proceeded to ignore Harriet.
Sherlock sighed then rolled his eyes before extending his tongue against Johns hand making him with draw it.
“Sherlock. Please tell me that Mycroft sent that woman down the deepest darkest hole imaginable.”
please tell me what you think so far. I would really like feedback.
“Sherlock has kids.”
"LESTRADE THERE ARE CHILDREN UP HERE!" Anderson shouted suddenly making Sherlock pale, he didn't even see Anderson sneak up the stairs to John's old room.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Yes. We have a case for you. We’ve found a few bodies…Do the kids need to be here for this?” Lestrade cut himself off realizing that this might not be appropriate for the kids in the room.
"Withdrawal starting already Lavonia? What are you on now? I see you've been shooting cocaine and heroin but you must have taken a lot of cocaine for the bugs to be hitting you now… that's why you're so jumpy right now. Now what kind of father would I be if I left my children alone with a known drug addict?" Sherlock remarked making her grit her teeth. "Don't act as if your any better SHERLY after all you forget. The last time I saw you, you were passed out in the back of an alley too drugged out to even remove the needle from your arm!" She snarled then grunted as Lily slammed her open palm against her cheek.
"Two reasons. One: if Sherlock and John kidnapped them then it would be important to listen to them.  However, the boy has said that they were not kidnapped. Two: you do not put your hands on a child at all. Never mind the fact that they’re Sherlock's children.
"You swear what John?"
"I fail to see your point love."
"I do not know what you mean John."
Lucian shrugged in response and slid over to his sister to inspect the skull. “Is this real?”
"LUCIAN!" she almost screamed as she was led into a blue room holding her brother. Quickly she threw herself into her brother's arms, silently letting him know what game they were playing. Luckily they had played this game many times before and he knew exactly what to do and what part to play.
"Well it started out fine. Lexy took us on a tour and showed us the loch, the black and white phone box, where Mrs. Mundy ran over her husband because he had a thing with his secretary. Then she bought us ice cream and we sat here. Then she ran across the street because she needed to talk to some guy about something or other. She's been running back and forth for a while now…"
“Harry…I will always love you. You’re my sister. And as for Clara? Give her a call. I think you’ll be surprised.” John said as he gave his sister a hug.
Text Message from: Sherlock
"It's sugar glass John!" He grinned even as he licked it. Greg made sure to get a few pictures of Sherlock sucking on the magnifying glass like a lollipop, he even got another of the detective offering his new husband a lick of his sweet treat. "Alright people! First dance of the married couple!" Greg announced then motioned for everyone to evacuate the dance floor as the husbands took center stage. John had left the music choices up to Sherlock with only a small list of what NOT to play. Among them were: the llama song; the hamster dance song; What does the fox say or anything by any (including former) Disney child stars. Sherlock had tortured John playing the hamster dance song trying to figure out how it pertained to a case (it didn't) and the detective had changed Greg and Mycrofts ringtones to the llama song and only after extensive bribery did he change them back. "Relax I think you'll like this." Sherlock smiled down at John. "It's a classic so I believe it's safe."
Just then Lily popped up from behind the couch to grab her father's shoulder. "Gladstone is Lucian's."
15 years old.
Lily was dressed in a short black skirt with fishnet stockings and steel toe boots. Her t-shirt was ripped in several places and had a picture of a unicorn being eaten by zombie gnomes. Her black hair was down for the first time in a while and she was wearing a multitude of jelly bracelets and one spike one. Her hair was held out of her face by a barrette with a small skull on it. Hanging from the black belt was a small blue duck with a chain around it's neck.
"I'll think of something but I know what I want."
Both men stared at the two but when Sherlock opened his mouth he closed it as his lover knelt in front of his children. "Why didn't you tell anyone?" He asked gently making them frown. "We did…we told the principal who only said 'you have no evidence so it cannot be proven' and we figured if we can't prove it why bother you guys?" Lucian remarked watching Sherlock's face go red. "John where is my phone?" He rumbled darkly making John wince and before he could voice the 'no' on the tip of his tongue Sherlock continued with his own. "No John, NO ONE treats my offspring in such a manner this will be solved NOW!" he growled as he leapt to his feet.
Lucian looked up to find the radio exploded and their father standing at the threshold holding a smoking gun.
"…yes…"
"I hope Kyle didn't get into trouble for all this." John started off as he poured the tea for his lover and the Detective Inspector, making them both smile. "No we just went over what happened and since they were the ones to throw the first punch and he was defending a girl, he wasn't in any trouble." Lestrade smiled then cast a worried look at the stairs. "I get the feeling that silence from three children is not a good thing." Sherlock announced as he tried to see what Greg saw on the stairs.
As soon as they returned to the embassy The twins were fed and put to bed with their fathers watching over them.
“You never know. I’m going to keep an eye on both for the time being.” She said and squeezed her brothers hand, jumping when the detective turned and shouted for them not to be slow pokes which earned him an elbow from John.
Lily and Lucian ran down the street with their back packs flung over their shoulders. "Okay I know we're not wanted there but where are we to go Lily-lie?" Lucian asked and they pounded the pavement.
"Alright so summer under a canopy which means light weight suits." Sherlock said as he wrote it down.
"LILY!"
~~__~~
"So we are here for a reason?" Lily asked as her fathers led them into the bed and breakfast. "We missed you and figured that you two would like to have a small vacation of your own." John smiled as he rubbed her hair making her glare. "So that's it then. Just one big happy family then?"
"Sherlock must have been some kind of desperate to marry that man. I mean did he think about the scandal to the Holmes name because of this? Not only is he marrying a man but marrying a commoner as well?!"
A sulking detective and two rambunctious children in the backseat were a little much for him at the moment.
“Because no one uses those machines!” Sherlock grumbled as he stood up to glare at his brother. “What do you want?”
"Yes but we aren't allowed to call it stalking."
VOTE!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suddenly Sherlock jerked and pulled his hand from Johns mouth to wipe it on the doctors shirt. "That's it, I'm telling Mrs. Peabody that you were the one that took out her shed."
Quickly both the detective and blogger's faces were smeared in green icing, even getting some in their hair. But both men (and everyone else attending) were laughing.
"Why would you want to do that?"
After five minutes of searching Lily found a large waterfall. "yea this place is really weird." She muttered before going to look for her brother, dragging him back to the waterfall.
Oh shit the twins thought and looked around to see if they could make a quick escape.
After getting Lily calmed down Sherlock walked back over to his former lover. "Listen to me very carefully Lavonia…I know her and she would NEVER attack someone without reason and I KNOW you threatened Lucian in some way for it was Lily who attacked…Now WHAT DID YOU SAY?" He roared finally letting some of his control slip.
"Okay thats...sweet...but what would you suggest? I'm not walking around with a diamond ring Sherlock."
John quickly wrapped himself around Sherlock arm in an effort to keep him upright as the shock tore through his friend. "You're…You're welcome…"Sherlock stuttered, his words lacking their usual venom.
"I am coming with you, or are you opposed to such actions?"
Sherlock lifted an arm and slammed his hand on the edge of the door, keeping it open. "I don't blame you for not wanting to see me. But please let me speak, and then tell me what you think. But please let me speak."
“I’d have to tell the clinic for sure. Speaking of which, do we know if they are up to date on their immunizations?”
"NO just no. Sherlock you can't abandon the flat for a month to prove that some insane man managed to survive in the woods for a week!" John responded as he slammed himself into his chair. "Hello children."
Chapter 20
“Who’s violin?” Lucian asked.
From: Boss
Again she started to argue. “No Lily, you have always been the rock for Lucian but stood on your own. Which admirable as it is, isn’t healthy. A rock that stands on its own while as strong as it is is liable to crumble. No John and I have spoken about this and we honestly think it will help.” Sherlock spoke as he knelt by her legs to take her hands into his, at how someone so inwardly strong could have such delicate hands. “Please just try, we are worried about you.”
“Yea what gives lady.” Lucian remarked as he managed to squirm between the two.
"WHAT THE HELL?! He's a HOSTAGE WHY WOULD HE HUG ME?" He screamed as he flew into a confused rage and started to wreck his office.
Sebastian shrugged and eyed the door. "No idea but that probably wasn't the best plan in the world. Let's not let them fight again."
“No. Now take your team and find out what is going on.”
Sherlock just sighed and looked up at his husband. "Wait is this why the tailor made me wear a garter?" He growled in his husband's hair. "I'm not going to answer that question."
Many people would believe that he is over shadowed by his sister because he is quiet where she is anything but silent. But it was the exact opposite in fact. He loved it when his sister got the attention she deserved because that meant he was free to analyze if that person was a threat from the shadows. After all no one expects the quiet ones.
"Lets see the tea set would be for John, a flask for Aunty Harriet, the handcuffs for him and John (You're totally right to not want those back by the way) and I'm pretty sure the monocle would be for Uncle Croft as his birthday is coming up and I'm not really sure what the baton was for...Unless the copper was harassing him or John in some way." Lucian smiled as he thought about his father.
small chapter. I really didn't want to leave the story hanging on such a bad note for too long.
"Fine…Sherlock please let us out." He asked emitting an air of defeat. "Thank you dear brother…I came over to see how you and the twins were fairing but I can see that you are doing fine…Gregory when can I expect you for dinner?" Mycroft asked collecting his phone for John. "I'm not coming to dinner."
“That’s just how they are Myc. They are both very volatile people in their own way and this is just how they are. They like it like that for some reason.” Mycroft looked at his boyfriend through the side of his gaze. “Well they are odd…”
"Ah...And I assume this is going to be what happens."
"Never mind dear brother, the spy found out that Moriarty has a house in southern Greece and more than likely that is where the children are being kept." Mycroft smiled at his brother. "Now have a team already set up but I know that you two would sneak over anyway. Instead of doing that, I am going to allow you to come with us but I want you two to hang back while the team clears the house. Are you actually going to listen?"
Immediately there came a sound of two pounding footsteps as the twins came running.
Sherlock lifted himself up with a growl and went over to the door to find the doctor standing there with large eyes.
"But it's a skirt."
"And we're going with you."
"Leverage to ensure Sherlock's absence, a failsafe of sorts...but why would he need a failsafe? What is he planning?"
"She wants money." Sherlock said as he finished reading the note left by their mother (spelling and grammatical errors being ignored) trying very hard to stay detached. "Obviously." John scoffed then grumbled as Sherlock picked up his phone. "Mycroft…No Its not about that…Lily came home with a letter. She found it in her locker at school and it's from her mother…Yes her mother…No idea who told her but she said that she will be here tomorrow around noon to 'come fetch Lily and Lucern'…Yes I know she got his name wrong. Anyways she asked for your presence specifically. Yes I am aware that she's only after more money…Good we'll see you tomorrow then…Of course I'll be on my best behavior!" Sherlock responded as he hung up the phone. "Now where is Lucian?"
Deborah blinked slowly at that.
"Here you go! Roast beef!" Jim smiled at the twins as he pushed the plates in front of them. "You simply MUST tell me absolutely EVERYTHING about the two of you! What are your favorite subjects in school? What are your hobbies? What was your child hood like? do you have many friends?" He rambled on before coming to a sudden stop, as if someone hit took the needle off a vinal album.
What it says on the tin
John stared at Sherlock in disbelief. "They've located the twins?" He asked astounded.
“No they were taking advice from someone in authority, Mr Rawson here. Now he instructed my children that they had to break into the tower control in order to see it. And seeing as he is part of the security force here, they took him at his word. Now who do you really think is at fault here? The children who were taking point from a security guard, employed by you. ”
Lily Vs. Therapist
"I know, it's now or never right?" she grinned and snapped another picture of her brother, making sure to get the sky line behind him.
"Which works in our favor now. We already know where the fuse box is...Now all we need is..."
"NO."
“Hey you’re lucky I speak English A Ghrà”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Alright then." Greg said as he suddenly remembered John chinning the chief.
"Hello my name is Lily, what's yours?" She asked offering the woman an outstretched hand.
Text Message from: Sherlock
So he continued to pace back and forth while his mind whirled around trying to find the answer for this vexing riddle.
"Because Jim is a good guy."
Lexy's eyes went wide and she made a pleading gesture with her hands. "Oh come on John that was forever ago and she just stopped glaring at me!"
"John's in the park."
What's a good word solid word for need?
"Neither do I but we survived... raspberries!" Lily exclaimed as she ran over to one of the bushes only to jump as she frightened several birds and squirrels away.
"No, not really." Lucian responded for the two of them as Jim led them back to the recreation room. "Alright you two unfortunately I absolutely HAVE to get some work done. Sometimes being an adult  SUCKS! But I will be done soon...ish. I'll be done soonish. Have fun!" Jim smiled insanely before walking off.
“Expecting someone?” John asked as he headed to answer the door.
Lily smiled as she thought on the past week. Sure they had been kidnaped but by the look of things they were not going to be here long. The blond guy had taken a liking to her 'Sweet and Innocent' disposition like white on rice. It had become a daily thing to grab a book, take it to the recreation room and sit quietly with him. While he thought she was just quiet she was actually plotting against him, just like he thought.
Squeeze
"No idea, she's magic." Lucian responded to Jim's surprise. "Alright this has gotten out of hand." Jim sighed and walked over to his phone to call up Sebastian. "Seb, get Lily and bring her into my office." He snarled into his phone.
Lily giggled sweetly and pressed against his arm making him smile. "Now I question for you."
"You think their still asleep?" Lucian asked as he slapped lily's hand away from their father's laboratory set. "…No they probably heard us come down stairs …want to make them breakfast?" She asked as she started poking through the cabinets, her long hair swinging freely down her back. "Let's see what they have and this time try not to set your hair on fire…"
~~__~~!
"Why in my orchard?"
John sighed as he rubbed the bridge of his nose. “Alright alright you’ve made your point now please stop…But it’s still not right to take these…”
"Well people are assholes." Lucian responded making Lily smile. "Who want everything."
He’s never been happier to take a song suggestion in his life and gladly played the song.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No she links up with Anderson two much."
Then some kid ran over. He gave the guys hoody a yank which knocked him down. On the way down the rugby player hit his head on the lockers which knocked him unconscious. Lucian then kicked out at the other boy (In his own defense!) catching him in the stomach. The boy promptly vomited which luckily missed Lucian and the other kid. One boy had a concussion another had a dislocated arm and the other just a really sore stomach. The teacher saw fit to send them to the hospital even though one was fine except for some bruising.
"Hello."
By now John was a little freaked out, they were obviously plotting and the fact that they were not including him generally meant that they were plotting against him.
"Not French."
“You might want to sit down again brother mine. I have something to tell you” Mycroft said as he pushed two children into 221b.
“surprise. Everyone likes”
They ended up raiding the gift shop for a while (Lily and Lucian were now no longer allowed out of their sight and had pleaded to get a smoothie) and ended back at the gate, each with a bag.
"We didn't not get seen…there was a receptionist who was more than happy to distract that Medical Examiner thing while we went by. Then there was that man who distracted that woman…Doberman? For us then again he seemed a little off. It's just a matter of distraction and not a little bit of sleight of hand." Lily remarked as she flipped through a medical journal, unaware of her father's smile and her brother's headshake. "Modest isn't she?"
"Right, survival...that always wins every argument I guess."
“Oh nothing. When did Mycroft say that the beds will be here?”
Sensing his shyness Lily took control, grabbing his hand and dragging him up the stairs, not seeing the blush staining his cheeks. She quickly disregarded the order to keep the order to keep in the door open, wanting to interrogate the new person in her life.
Shut up will you? Lily thought to herself as Professor Munch droned on while he wrote a complicated problem up on the blackboard. "Anyone who can solve this problem will automatically be given an 'A+' for the year and will not have to do any work for the rest of the year." Professor Munch said smugly leaving the students to stare at the Taylor polynomial on the board.
"Alright it started a few days ago when Lily came into my room and sat on my bed. Then she started asking all these questions and I couldn't help it. I snapped at her. After that every time I turn around one of them is just there…staring at me….and it's not just her…its both of them…and they chatter."
"Well my child doesn't go around accosting women!" the man almost screamed, his face turning a brilliant crimson.
John smiled as he lifted his head to press his lips against Sherlocks, their mouths moving together in a slick slide of tongues and saliva. "John."
Thankfully he was saved from answering as two pairs of feet came running down the stairs. "Alright stop messing around the kids are awake." John tried to snap but all that came out was a breathy reprimand. Sherlock rolled his eyes and ran the tip of his nose up his bloggers neck to settle behind his ear. "Who's messing around?" he smiled and started to nuzzle his ear. "It's not my fault that you're so… cuddly." He whispered sending shivered down Johns spine. But before he could react he rolled out of the bed and pulled the blankets off the bed in one smooth motion. "And you're right the children are up so let's go Jawn."
John was saddened by this but nodded his head. “We expected as much. You’ve seen their records. Their mother only brought them in as a last resort.”
"Like everyone else."
The twins started to fight between themselves but stopped when John enclosed both of them in his arms. “I love both of you very dearly, neither of you broke me. Now lets get this placed cleaned up. Actually where is your father?” John laughed as he gave them both a hug. Then the door opened
Both twins looked at each other then back at her. Both remained silent.
Wood on wood but concentrated into one contact point, rounded object held by hand, umbrella handle…Mycroft. Sherlock quickly deduced then rolled his eyes. "Someone please let my brother inside before he chews through the door." Sherlock said making the twins stare as he went to get his violin.
Yea now he needed to know what they didn’t want him to see if they were going to try and be sneaky.
An hour later John and Greg found out that playing cards with the Holmes's was not such a good idea. For while Greg and John folded rather quickly the Holmes' were stubborn and refused to let the other brother win.
They spent the rest of the day in the living room, Lucian drawing while Lily read a textbook on ancient mythology and its effects on archaeology.
"Hush."
"I'm going to talk to her." Sherlock said as he wiped his mouth with his napkin and started to stand but halted at his fathers raised hand. "I don't believe anyone can help her with whatever is going on in her head right now. Otherwise her brother would know what is troubling her." Trymman said then gave his youngest son a pointed stare. "Sit, now John you were saying?"
John felt the bed dip beside him and a long arm get tossed over his shoulder to pull him into an embrace. "It will be alright…err…there there?" He heard Sherlock say awkwardly as he was patted on the back.
"Alright lets either find shelter or water..." Lily said as she pumped a fist in the air. She knew that being lost in the woods isn't the worst thing out there and sometimes a little morale can go a long way.
"Now when we get to the manor I want you to keep in touch at all times so…pay attention!" Mycroft snapped when he realized that he was being ignored by everyone but John. "Thank you, now my brother and John have cell phones so keeping in touch isn't a problem the problem lies with you two." He said giving a nod towards the twins. "Here you go, now these cell phones have already been programmed with John and Sherlock's number as well as my own and I've taken the liberty of downloading some apps that you may find useful, Lily yours is purple and Lucian yours is green…I believe you both favor these colors. Now please be careful and UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE YOU TO EXPERIMENT ON THEM!" he said looking at his brother while pulling out two brand new iphones out of the bag making Johns eyes go wide and he started to smirk.
The next four months flew by in a blur for all four of them. The twins were still learning the ins and outs of living with Sherlock and John. Sherlock was learning (slowly but surely) what NOT to do with children and John was getting more comfortable with the affection that Sherlock was showing. Though there were verbal rules (mainly for Sherlock) there were some unwritten rules that were not broken. For instance: any dangerous chemicals were stored in the blue locker (always locked) that John got him, No body parts were stored in the fridge anymore and everyone always knocked before going into any room (the bathroom especially Sherlock still hasn't gotten over walking in on Lily in the shower especially the shrieking he still won't go into her room after that). So when John was woken from a sound sleep but two quiet voices from the hallway nothing was new.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and yanked on Johns arm. "Shower then a cab home..."
“No, I’m a doctor.”
Sherlock took the advantage of John's confusion at the woman to kiss him on the cheek, angering the woman further.
“Evening John, where is…What happened here?” Mycroft asked staring at the three figures covered in white powder.
“School is starting soon and while your father has voiced his opinion on the matter, he is wrong. You have to go to school.”
The second day was a complete disaster as Sherlock had been up all night researching about being a parent and had gotten the age wrong. So, the next morning the twins and John had woken up to the kitchen being baby proofed and several different kinds of baby food and snacks in the cabinet. It took a few minutes to explain that those types of things were not age appropriate. John then spent the afternoon stripping out all the baby proofing and listening to Sherlock grumble on about how he did research and how John was ruining it.
"Lost in orchard?" Now it was the man's turn to be confused.
"You ATTACKED  John. The only person who has put up with you for so long. You knew EXACTLY which buttons to press and you pushed them until you pushed John to his breaking point!"
“We’re all set for school next week and the kids are actually excited to go. I think they were getting bored not doing anything around here.” John remarked with a fond smile.
"'old on….you're…you're their da?" Raz asked suddenly looking as if Sherlock had just told him that he was an archangel and the devil wasn't really that bad. "yes…thank you for taking care of them. As for you two…I'm sorry for my behavior but none of that was directed at you…that was all towards Mycroft….will you return with me?" Sherlock practically begged of the two then watched as a silent discussion went on between them.
"Always looking to meet new friends. Now…what are you two running from if you don't mind my asking?" Raz asked and smiled at their amazed faces. "You both have that look about you like you're a second away from bolting…see that look on mice a lot."
“John the boy was obviously lying but I’m not exactly sure about what. I mean he is smarter than to just punch a bully in the face when insulted I’m just curious as to why he felt the need to lie for Lily this time.”
That night Moriarty and Sebastian watched as the twins sat as far apart from each other as posible and spoke only though glares.
All in all he was nervous as well as grief stricken.
"My, come along it won't be as bad as you think. God knows you might have a bit of fun." Greg smiled as he walked over, jokingly pushed John out of the chair and sat down to give his lover a pointed look. "I still don't understand the need for this." Mycroft hissed as he walked over to where Gregory was sitting. "Just be glad that they didn't toss the bouquet to you love. Now, I don't think the garter is going to put itself on. Do you?" Greg's eyes danced as he waved a leg at his lover. "Fine but this is dull."
“John.”
Lily sighed at him then moved to glare at her father. "Father told me that it was Gregoravich, that liar." She growled then moved to help her brother start packing the bookcase. Well I say 'helped' when she mainly just pulled everything off the bookcase and just shoved it into random boxes, much like her father was doing at the desk.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“It was all Skynet’s fault”
Suddenly he stopped and smiled at the image before him that was an almost exact duplicate of another from years ago.
“I’m going to go and order dinner.” John said as he awkwardly left the room, leaving the two alone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John and Sherlock walked down to the dining room where Mrs. Kinsley was still setting up for breakfast. "Oh hello dears! I am sorry but we are not ready for breakfast as of yet." She fluttered at them. "Oh is there anything I can do to help?" John immediately offered his service while Sherlock simply slunk away. "Oh that's alright dears. I have this under control. Now how about you two take a nice morning stroll? My husband used to take one every morning, did wonders for reveling aches and pains." She said meaningfully making John blush. "Yes, right come along then Sherlock."
Lily walked through the streets of London with a small smile on her face. She could see the CCTV camera's turning slightly to watch her progress.
Sherlock wanted to reach out and comfort him but knew that if he did then he would lose it as well. "Sherlock, your vows please."
Salcone Destrivina
"Oh nothing much...I'm just useless and this is just another case to me..." John muttered making Greg seethe. But John didn't even see his friends face as the clouds of doubt and depression swirled around to obscure his vision. Before he knew it he was hyperventilating
After a long day John liked to settle down with a good cup of tea. He’s always been a big believer in the healing powers of tea. Had a bad day? Tea. Had a good day? Tea. Issues at home? Talk it out over tea. So once they got back to the flat with dinner John immediately put the kettle on as the kids showed off their new school supplies to Sherlock.
"Don't be a git. I'm talking about having Anthea or whatever she calls herself today march all the way through Scotland yard and right in my office to tell me that
So much, so young I've faced on my own
Sherlock stared at the floor for a good minute before answering. "So I can find out what he wants. Or at least apologize for what I said. I didn't mean those words I was just so frustrated and so angry with myself..."
When she finally stopped, Sebastian gave her a one armed hug. "Sounds to me like you two need some time apart from each other." he said sadly then tipped her face up to look her in the eye. "Want me to beat him up for you?" He grinned making her laugh. "Thank you but no." She smiled up at him.
"Damn I actually liked that tea set."
"Oy!" came a yell that had the two turning to find a short man dressed as a skater. "You two are the strangest looking couple I've ever seen." He smiled at them. "Names Raz, who might you be?"
Mycroft simply sighed at the childish insult before smacking his little brother in the head with his umbrella. "Hmm I would have thought it would have made different sound as your head is as hollow as your heart is. You're an idiot Sherlock. You are not the only one suffering the loss of the twins. But you just cannot see that can you? Do you know what you have done? Do you even care?" Mycroft growled as Sherlock rubbed his head.
"He would. But you shouldn't." Greg could see the vein in Mycrofts temple start to throb. "Why shouldn't we? I mean we learned all about sex in school...kind of disgusting to be honest." Lily made a face at that making Greg laugh. "Well it is disgusting and I don't recommend you ever having sex...perhaps you should wait until you are forty." Mycroft responded as his eye started to twitch when he thought about all the suitors that would inevitably come knocking at Sherlock's door. Yep his brother was definitely going to jail once the world population of boys figured out how beautiful and untouchable his niece was. "You're odd." Lily remarked making the minor government official want to pound his head on the steering wheel.
Mycroft stared at his lover in disbelief. "Sherlock's children Gregory. Where are they?"
That was how Sherlock found them an hour later, John sandwiched between his offspring and all three of them watching a movie on the telly. "What are you watching?" Sherlock asked making them jump and John blush guiltily. Something he knows I don't like and probably won't approve of he thought as he took a seat next to lily who eyed him suspiciously. "Really?" he growled as Orlando Bloom filled the screen. "Why the hobbit?" He growled making them laugh. "Sherlock…love…this is Lord of The Rings not The Hobbit…." John tried to snicker at his friends? Lovers? Perturbed look.
“No But it’s just my brother. Tell him to sod off.” Sherlock said as he flopped down onto the couch.
Can you see that I'm bound in chains? I've finally found my way
Hello?
Somethings never change.
"That's alright after all no one expects the Spanish inquisition!"
"W-why?" Sally asked gently.
Soon John had the venue, suits, flowers, the guest list and color scheme picked out. The only part left was the food they would be serving and what kind of cake they wanted.
"I wonder what they're doing."
"Just great Sherlock I bring them all the way here and you frighten them off." Mycroft muttered as Sherlock stared at the empty couch. "Where did they go?" he asked softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Breaking Barriers"
“Hello” they toned together, keeping a hold on Sherlocks coat.
"Throat hurts?"
Should not be separated from each other unless with a parent or they choose to
(See the end of the chapter for
John sighed as he walked through the doorway of 221B and dropped the groceries on the counter. "Bugger." He grumbled finally noticing the absence of a certain lanky detective who was usually underfoot. "At least this time I KNOW where he is for sure." he muttered darkly as he headed up the stairs to the twins room. "I knew it. I knew he wouldn't be able to leave her alone." He said as he opened the door only to stare at the Image before him.
When everyone was seated with a cup of tea and Lily recounted her story for the second time Sherlock told them about the threatening texts, which Mycroft exploded over. "YOU PUT JOHN AND THE KIDS IN DANGER SHERLOCK AND FOR WHAT? A GAME? A CLEVER PUZZLE FOR YOU TO SOLVE? LILY COULD HAVE DIED OUT THERE TODAY!" he roared making John jump to his feet. "First of all Mycroft, He isn't at fault here if anyone is I am." John shouted over Mycrofts roars of stupidity and responsibility. "Sherlock told me about the texts last night and we both know that Moriarty wouldn't strike right away as he likes to play with his targets. He likes his prey good and terrified before he springs his trap remember? So I told him not to say anything to you and the kids until we figure out the best course of action. That way the kids would be safe at school and wouldn't have to look over their shoulder or wonder why there are men following them everywhere they go, essentially freaking them out." the army doctor said as and he moved to wrap Lily in his arms. "Well that was stupid." was the only response Mycroft gave.
please enter in the comment section below...it will help greatly...Please...?
“He scruffed us”
Lily and Lucian pouted as they road in the back of Mycrofts car. Lily held a struggling Gladstone in her lap and glared around her. "I still don't understand why-"
Sherlock and John nodded and turned south-west. “So they escaped Moriarty and started to venture out…”
"The north star."
"Tell me why you helped." She questioned as she waited for Kyle to take his turn. "He tried to hit you."
Moriarty frowned at the girl's odd request. "Disposable cameras? Wouldn't you rather a digital camera?"
"Not to do that."
"Alright we need to head north."
"Thank you for this by the way..." John said absentmindedly as he dropped into an old ratty chair. "No problem. Oh, about the rent, that's paid up for the year." Greg said and before John could protest, ran out the door.
if you see a double like line this
“Sherlock?”
"John I have some..." Sherlock groaned as he threw his body sideways and scrambled for his coat. "Thank god all I could find was lotion with menthol in it..." John remarked as Sherlock drew up a triumphant hand grasping a small tube of lubricant making John smile.
“Simple, we’ll give them your room and you’ll move into mine.”
“How old are you?” John asked the twins as he shooed Sherlock out of his chair.
Alright peoples, this is the Beginning of the chapter (I know Duh, but the chapter notes thing kind of disappeared on my computer...)
Vows: Made up during a car ride
John chuckled and hugged him back. "Of course love, now get off the twins are turning a bit green."
their fault. The fault lie with the security guard who instead of bringing them back to their family by any means, decided to just let them try anyways.
The next few days were tense to say the least. Lavonia was charged with prostitution, possession of illegal narcotics, child endangerment, and possession with intent to distribute and just about everything that they could think of. But the twins were now Sherlock and John's complete with the last name and everything. Peace returned to 221B Baker Street…well almost.
I don't know other languages!!
"No they wear kilts sometimes."
“We’re flatmates.”
Where Amalee Holmes was bright and flashy the man at the top of the stairs was dressed in an understated suit and tie and he was leaning heavily on a cane. "Father…what happened now?" Mycroft asked with a pointed look towards his father's cane. "Sword fight. Now we did not raise you to be rude Mycroft, introduce us to our guests."
“I like to draw; Lily likes to read. She’s into mythology at the moment.”
"Come along Mycroft."
"Yes?"
"Wait…you said these are your children." Deborah said with a confused smile.
TRIGGER WARNING
________________________________________
Sherlock tried not to let it show how much that look affected him, tried and failed miserably as he was immediately by the boys side, wrapping his arms around him. "It's alright I understand why you did it." He said not noticing his lovers smile, nor the fact that John took out his phone to take a picture.
"Just needed the company I think I need a pet or something. My apartment is too quiet sometimes." Lucian sighed as he sat down on the couch.
Sherlock glared into the phone with malice. I'm going to switch them into an academy that does not ALLOW their TEACHERS to bombard them with homophobic remarks as well as making incestuous comments about them. And when those children complain about the abuse laid onto them by their TEACHER the HEADMASTER doesn't even look into the remarks instead CALLING MY CHILDREN LIARS! So if you think that this is the end of it think again. I'm not only going to submit your name to the disciplinary board but I'm also going tell your wife about what you do when you spend nights at the school, actions that I'm sure most parents don't want their children exhibited to…now have a pleasant evening.
"Is it not uncomfortable?"
"Why?" Lily asked obviously suspicious of Lestrade. "Oh just curiosity mainly. Here you go." He replied and handed Sherlock a manila folder with the contents of a case inside. "Thank you, come along children we have to go to st. Barts."
Its up to you to decide whether or not they take the plane or they are kicked out of the airport…
Sebastian stared at the empty air for a moment before running over and looking down the side of the cliff where the waves smashed against the wall. "Oh my god…James is going to kill me." He said before standing up and walking back to where his rifle was laid against a tree, picked it up and then ambled off towards the house.
Lily and Lucian did not know why they went with the man. So they blamed it on their curiosity to know exactly why the man interfered with their lives.
Lily goes head to head with the therapist...sort of in a very Lily way. After all why argue with someone when you can just scare the living daylights out of them?
Sherlock looked down at John with look of horror before his expression turned dark. "If that's how you want to play it..." He smiled darkly before grabbing another slice of the cake and splattering it on his husbands face, making him laugh.
"Congratulations brother you broke John."
"We really did fall asleep on the couch…" John's gruff voice cut through the darkness of the room making the twins jump and stare with fear in their eyes. What had they been through in their short lives to make them so suspicious of everyone? John thought to himself and pitied them. "Listen…I'm not going to lie to you. There was a time when your father…had some drug issues and besides some experiments that had some…well gaseous effects and the odd cigarette now and again… he's been clean and if he wasn't…There is NO way in hell I would expose you to that…I swear that all you saw were signs of exhaustion." John said vehemently watching the twins grow less weary of him. "We figured that if he wasn't a junky then he was a former one…That's the only kind of person our mother hung around with…" Lily said watching Johns eyes grow sad.
"You will leave my children alone!" Sherlock shouted making everyone jump and Mycroft stare. "No Sherlock I will not. Look at them they can barely function without the presence of the other and it is extremely unhealthy." Mycroft argued and John saw that he was not trying to be mean or cruel. He was honestly worried about the twin's mental health. "Mycroft I've taken each of them out separately and their fine as long as they aren't nervous." John remarked thinking back to some shopping trips with Lucian and Lily. "You will leave my children alone they are not unhealthy! They are just having a reaction to a new environment by clinging to something familiar which happens to be each other so LEAVE THEM ALONE!" Sherlock shouted and continued when Mycroft started to speak. "No, you are not their father I am. You saw to that by bringing them here. So now John and I will make the decisions concerning the twins!" He announced making them said. "Well said Sherlock. But my concern is not about Control Sherlock I am honestly worried about the two of them." Mycroft started then sighed as his phone went off. "Please be sure to have them at St. Barnabas by nine o'clock to take the entrance exam." He said then left with a sigh.
Alright peoples because this chapter was SUPER long (because I totally forgot about the bachelor party...) you guys get another chapter! Hurah!
"Lily-lie…do you think Sherlock's strange?" Lucian asked making Lily laugh. "Of course I do Luce…But we like strange! Hey do you think Johns going to try and feed us tea again?" he retorted making him smile in return. "After your performance not very likely…Do you think he'll keep us?" he asked tentatively, this was the one question that was on both of their minds but neither wanted to ask.
"So your head and joints hurt you the most?"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This made Sherlock angry.
“Ah, they have a tendency to do that…Should probably replace them since I took out the sensors a while back.” Sherlock said absentmindedly then regretted it at the glare from John. “In that case you get to help.”
Sherlock stared back at his blogger. Did he just ask? He did... Sherlock thought then nodded vigorously only to growl when Johns tongue found his navel. Is he really going to? He asked himself and then his mind went blissfully blank as John took him in hand and started to stroke.
“Does this mean we are staying here?”
Lily and Lucian sat in the back of the car dressed in black, Lily unhappy that she had to wear a real dress but did not say anything because she did not wish to upset John.
"Children and a wedding in less than a year. I'm impressed." Mycroft sniffed as he took a small sip of his wine. Sherlock gave his brother a slight nod of his head before turning away. "Congratulations Sherlock and before you ask, yes I mean it." Mycroft intones as Gregory came over to lead him away.
“Good.” Lucian replied sending a questioning look towards his father who shrugged in response.
ONE WEEK LATER
“Don’t think too much into it. Perhaps she actually just wants to spend time with you?” Sherlock asked, reading the look on his friends face.
"Oh my god Lil, I haven't seen you in ages! What have you been up too?!" He asked as he let her down to take her hand.
“In that case you get to help.”
ME: ermergerd So do I!
Lucian smiled as he held wandered through the college campus, his mind somewhere in oblivion where colors swirled and lines connected. He was too busy thinking about his next art project to notice exactly where he was going. But his feet knew the path to take to get to his class, having traveled there many times before.
"Yes."
"I am afraid you misunderstood before when I said that you have your fathers coldness. You see both you and Sherlock have the ability to detatch yourself from a situation to analyze it in its entirety. This makes you seem cold and if you are not careful you may get stuck like that. That was all I meant. If people look hard enough, anyone can see that you feel too much and that is the reason you do this…just like your father."
"Sherlock CALM DOWN YOUR GOING TO FRIGHTEN THE…where did they go?" John asked as be pulled the detective off of his brother and only just noticing the empty couch.
“Of course I’ll…I’ll call you.”
They were clean and probably the newest thing they had ever had.
and strange question but how do you know if someone comments on your work????
employees.”
Text Message from: Unknown
"Thank god." Sherlock said as they finally exited the plane. He hates being stuck in a confined place to begin with but then to throw his brother into the mix… What was it the twins said? It was bad Juju. “Alright so he gave us very general coordinates. The only thing he knew was that Moriarty has a house somewhere near here. Now I know Sherlock and I know Greek but what about you two?” Mycroft asked.
“Thanks. So what’s going on?” John asked as he took a sip.
"Alright that's enough. First of all, Sherlock you took that amazingly well for finding out that Mycroft had known about them for five years. If it were me you would be dead or dying, so yes, he took that amazingly well. Now Sherlock…what do you wish to do with them?" John asked gently.
Killing is WRONG!
"Lily we've been running for forever, we need to stop to at least get our bearings." Lucian said as he ran alongside her. "Alright lets climb one of these trees and see if we can see a town or something." She replied and started to climb.
“I swear to god Sherlock, if you don’t stop I’m going to push you out of the car.”  John growled at his lover who gave him a calculating look.
John had never done the marketing so quickly and would be loathe to take Sherlock anywhere for a while…especially after the man managed to bean him with an over ripe tomato.
Both twins leaned forward to see the puppy asleep and snuffling gently. They then gave each other the 'Oh-Shit' expression which made John nod his head.
"Hi dad."
John jumped as he felt a pair of arms wrap around him from behind and gave a grim smile when Sherlock pressed his forehead against the nape of his neck.
Moriarty sat at his desk, staring into space for a good half an hour before Sebastian walked in. "Boss?" He asked highly confused.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“But the machines turned on us”
John melted at the words even as his lover rolled his eyes. "I love you, you git."
“Shit.”
As much as he loved Sherlock John couldn’t stand him during long car drives. The plane was fine because they were able to entertain him long enough to touch ground. However, a car has closer quarters and there is no possible way to play a board game in one.
"Not here. In 1666 a man named Tomas Farynor was the baker to King Charles II. A fire started in his bake shop and didn't take long to expand to the rest of the street. Because London was made mainly out of wood the fire spread quickly, burning down The Church of St. Margaret then onto Thames Street. In only seven hours the fire had spread to London Bridge and the only reason that the fire did not spread to Southward was a gap caused by the fire of 1633. By the time a Royal Command came down to create a fire-break the fire was too out of control to stop... The fire raged for three days until it halted near Temple Church. Then it started again continuing towards Westminster. The Duke of York destroyed the Paper House to create another fire-break, ending the flames. Sixteem people died and as much as 80% of the city proper was destroyed including 1300 houses, 89 churches and 52 guild halls." Sherlock spoke as they looked over London.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide as he realized that in the middle of his apology he confessed to John. But there was no way to backtrack without hurting John even more. "Yes, yes I do love you John...What's not to love?" He asked and turned his head away so John didn't see him blush.
"Listen midget...Shut up!" Lucian jokingly snarled making her grin.
“Who did she bribe to get past the psychological exam?”
"It's English which is weird because it was originally Chinese." Kyle offered and struggled not to laugh as Lily began putting everything on the tray into her cup…in massive quantities. "Sugar, Agave saccharine and almost an entire lemon?" He asked making the girl smirk. "And cream, don't forget the cream!"
Lily stared down her grandmother and repeated that she wasn't hungry.
"Mother, enough. Lily had had a very trying day yesterday to say the least, even by adult standards. Now she only wanted the comfort of the only thing stable in her life, which happens to be her brother." Mycroft said from the doorway, surprising everyone with his presence.
After an hour of shouting on the phone Sherlock joined his lover on the couch only to glare at him. "That was all your fault." Was all he said as he laid his head in John's lap. "Well it's all over and done with now so hush." John murmured running his fingers though his lovers hair.
From Lily
The weeks that proceeded the twins illness seemed to fly by until a series of texts stopped Sherlock's entire world.
John had long stopped questioning their fashion sense. Now he just questioned where they got the clothes…but not out loud. "Are you two going to be warm enough?"
The Eastern Kingfisher is also found in the west and birds don't recognize any symbols of authority
“Kids?” He called then heard them whispering in the other room. “We’re fine, go back to packing!” came Lucian’s voice.
John and Sherlock walked through the small village and John pointed out all the small stalls on the roads. "It's very quiet here." Sherlock announced while they were in the small market. He announced it very loudly gaining the attention of more than a few people. One of which was not to happy about him. "Why are the english always invading us? Oh I know probably because England is the Mexico of Scotland." He sneered at the detective.
"okay dishes are done!" Lily announced as John jerked away from Sherlock's warmth. "Do either of you want to watch a movie?" John asked hurriedly making Sherlock frown at him. "I guess…" Lily stared at the two before curling up with her brother in Sherlock's chair. Why couldn't they sit on the couch? John thought to himself then saw an opening. "Who wants popcorn?" he asked with a smile as the twins raised their hands simultaneously. "Alright you three decide on a movie while I make the popcorn…with or without butter?" He asked then fled at the 'butter and salt please'.
Suddenly one car swerved violently and skidded to a stop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock was kneeling on the bed, moaning obscenely as he used one hand to start opening himself up, making the doctor harden even more. They hadn't done it this way before and John was, admittedly, curious about the difference. "God Sherlock." John muttered as Sherlock started to crawl over towards him. "I think I need help, I don't think I did it right." His eyes glimmered at his words and he grinned as John was immediately behind him, slicking his fingers. "Hold still love...There we go." He growled as he pushed two fingers into his husband and started to thrust his digits in and out before scissoring them, making the detective squirm and wriggle. "More John."
“Yes, the man that was interrogated told us of a house a few miles out that Moriarty owns. It’s near a little town called Oligos. Now do not get your hopes up as the twins may or may not be there. It is only a long shot.”
“Everything alright?”
"Or someone with a phone would be nice."
The fight continued for several days, Lily running to Sebastian for advice while her brother went to Moriarty. Both men, when asked for advice, would do whatever they could to widen the rift between the twins.
“they're delicious!”
“Of course. We’ll be right outside if you need anything. Just call and we’ll come running.”
"Sorry about them Sherlock…. and congratulations on your kids…they do look a lot like you but in a good way." Greg joked and held out a hand to Sherlock who looked at him in confusion but shook it anyway.
"Testing John"
And I embrace myself, please don't tear this apart
Sherlock didn't need him to finish that sentence so he stopped John from talking by covering his mouth with his own, kissing the man deeply.
"The male…Oh and Sherlock if you bring them to any crime scenes you will not like the consequences…" John threatened casting his eyes to the skull on the mantle place then left at his friends curt nod.
"Sherlock are you sure you are alright? We were a little rough last night." John worried over his husband who only turned and gave him a smile. "Yes I am sure. It was only the way I was sleeping that did it."
Sherlock and the twins immediately gathered around John and tried to sooth the man who smiled gratefully.
John sighed and rested his head on the back of Sherlocks shoulder. "Sorry I forgot how much of an airhead she can be."
The twins however, were having the time of their lives. Lexy had bought them ice cream and they were sitting on one of the benches and people watching while Lexy ran around town looking for them. "I like it here, it's quiet."
I am, ooh I am
A week later Sarah cornered him at the clinic, the twins’ files in hand.
Salcone Destrivina
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he watched John out of the corner of his eye. “Just let Anderson know that if he touches my daughter again, they will never find his body.” He said and watched John speak quietly to the kids. “Now if you excuse me, I have to go calm my children down from the scare you gave them.
“Nope now we get to disinfect everything.”
Sherlock was in the act of gently placing his violin in the case and the twins were both curled up on the couch, fast asleep.
“We wanted to try”
"Hopefully tower of London if not the bottom of the Thames." Lily's voice made even the iceman flinched. She did not like this woman not one bit.
"I Do"
"You'll be moving into my room it's big enough for the both of us and besides…I'll be lost without my blogger….now more than ever it would seem." Sherlock corrected to everyone's surprise and no one saw Lily tap Lucians hand in their silent code for 'I told you so' "well you both will be attending school which is obvious. But you already missed more than three fourths of the school year and I'm told that you did not attend high school with your mother, so you both will be taking the placement tests and be placed in your prospective years." Mycroft announced to the displeasure of his brother.
“What have you two been eating?” John asked as the twins licked their hands.
"Alright so what do we do while we're here?" Lucian asked as they walked through the small field next to the loch.
"FIND THEM!" Moriarty roared as he shoved everything off his desk. "I want them hunted down and found!"
"A shirt…why?" Lily sighed at the question knowing that no matter what she said it would not be the right answer. "We'll get you some real clothes...are those combat boots? Really? We'll get you some heels and a pretty dress! Why we'll even have your hair done, maybe some highlights…"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I don't know…"
Lily stole a glance through her hair to find her father kneeling in front of her, eyes worried. Suddenly she gave a hiccup and started to cry again…making the world's only consulting detective panic.
Panicked at the sight of my presence...A bit not good... eyes keep shifting towards the stairs, hands wringing. Not exactly panic but close...fear? He's trembling but moving closer towards me so not afraid of me...that is good. There's definitely something wrong, something up stairs has him afraid...where Is lily? Lily Is always with him but did not descend...his fear has something to do with her the way he keeps eyeing the staircase...That smell...sweat? why would he be sweating he just got out of the shower...not his sweat...Lily's...Lily did not come down stairs with her brother who's terrified of something upstairs and the smell of sweat on him...Something Is wrong with lily!  Sherlock thought quickly as he bolted up the stairs to throw open the door.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yes you did love."
"And how do you propose we do this Mycroft?" Sherlock snapped at his brother as they were crammed into the car.
“Most of the time was them arguing over what type of pen was best. Apparently Lily prefers the uni-ball pens while Lucian likes Ener-gel pens. And there’s a difference between them. But they both hate bics.” John sighed and sipped his tea.
Dr travis pursed his lips before offering the shaking girl a glass of water. He knew that there was more to her dreams than just drowning in blood. But to his credit he wasn’t going to push her into revealing what really went on in her nightmares…not yet anyways.
the llama song...is epic the hamster dance song not so much.
When they walked in Trymman could see the red in the girls eyes and (though he would be loath to admit it) felt a little guilty. "Lily come here please." Though the statement was posed as a question it still rang with authority. "Yes sir?" She asked, her eyes downcast.
"Me too."
"Well at the moment you are the most formidable person in her eyes so she's testing you…that's all. But from what I hear at least she isn't putting living things in your room or surprise attacking you…" Greg said handing the government official another glass of water. "True Sherlock was a handful at the best of times and luckily has mellowed out some as he got older and Lily definitely cannot compare with him at that age." He said making Greg stare. "Mellowed out?"
"What John?" The detective sounded exasperated when he turned around to find John's eyes dancing. "What is it John?"
The baker sighed again then tried a different tactic. He pulled four new plates and placed a few dollops of different icing on the surface. "Alright going from left to right the outer ring is all buttercream icings. Vanilla, chocolate, lemon, cream cheese, strawberry, raspberry, almond and honey. The ring inside of that is the same flavors only in glaze form and the inner most ring is also the same flavors but the style is called 'boiled frosting' and is a denser then the other icings." The baker said and backed away slowly. John liked all of them while Lily stayed away from the chocolate flavors. Lucian and Sherlock both said that the boiled frosting tasted like flavored marshmallows and everyone but Lily thought that the glaze was too sweet.
"I am so sorry for the delay but I just came back from talking to the captain and he agrees that such despicable persons should never have been allowed on board at all and you shouldn't have to sit next to them. This is highly degrading, so if you will please follow me we are upgrading you to first class."
"So they wont jam up when I try to use them."
Lily and Lucian stared at John before turning towards each other and making odd gestures and facial expressions. John assumed it was their version of twin speak and ignored it. Sherlock on the other hand, decided to try and decipher the language. He’s been trying to decipher their language for the last few weeks but every time he thought he had done so the twins had proven him wrong. John was extremely glad that he had been there when Sherlock started flailing and the twins asking John if their father was having a stroke or heart attack.
"Alright you talked me into it." He laughed.
"She didn't put anything in it. She's just standing there looking evil to make people think that she did. Smart that one."
"Damn just a sprite then." Lily pouted as her father (john) told her that no she could not order wine.
"What is going on between you and Anthea?" Mycroft asked suddenly and blamed the foul towel that caressed his lovers hips for distracting him.
~~_~~!
"Come on children or we will leave you here." John called out as he leaned back into his detective.
"Molly…I need some soil samples from the victim's fingernails…" Sherlock announced his eyes never leaving the microscope. "Yea…not molly she's a bit strange." Lucian said making his father visibly jump. "You two are not allowed in here…" Sherlock said knowing that his argument was going to be weak. "And Molly thinks we're five…so I fail to see your point…" Lily remarked as she hoisted herself up to sit on the counter. "Yea please don't leave us with her…she keeps trying to feed us tea!" Lucian begged. Sherlock mentally ran through his options before sighing. "Alright but don't touch anything!" he relented making the twins grin.
John stared open mouthed at the detective until he lifted one elegant hand and gently pushed his bloggers jaw closed. "So the reason you don't…is us?" Lucian asked unbelieving. "Yes…I just said that…were you not listening?" Sherlock asked then winced as John popped him on the back of the head making his little girl laugh. "Ow…and now that's cleared up I'm off to bed…come along John." He said almost dragging him out of the room/
Lucian looked at his plate and mumbled an apology for upsetting John while Sherlock reached over and held his hand.
Soon the woman began making noise which drew a flight attendants attention.
"We've been over that before. As much as I would like it I don't think any partner I choose would. 'Oh hey want to come home with me? It's alright just ignore the two gay guys on the second floor...not their fine it's just my dad's." Lucian snarked making John choke on his tea with laughter and Sherlock sulk.
"When I was about eleven or twelve my parents got into this huge fight. They were throwing things and everything. Well my father threw a glass vase at my mother and missed her but hit me. I had to go to the hospital and get stitches in my arm and head the cuts were so deep. Well the officer knew what kind of family I had so he placed me in my uncles care. I lived with him until I was eighteen when I went into the service…we actually had a big fight about that before I left. Actually this is the same house…"
"Did he talk to John?"
"Still can't believe that he sank down to this level." Amalee Holmes sneered at her sister even as they took their seats in the front row. "I know! I couldn't believe it myself when I heard Sherlock was getting married!"
"Easy a perceived threat is always more effective than a real threat!"
"Yes and I honestly think they were trying to make you laugh..." Sherlock said as he walked over to cuddle his blogger close to his chest. "I know but."
Mycroft looked up at his boyfriend in confusion. "Alright…next week then?"
Sherlock was about to just shrug off his concern before thinking twice about it. “Kids can you wait outside for a moment?”
Sherlock walked in to find both of his children hugging his friend in the kitchen. “Sweet as that is why does it look like a cocaine lab exploded in here?” He asked while backing away from the children and his John.
Colonial Moran closed the phone and with a sigh started dismantling his sniper rifle, thinking about how odd the teenage girl was, pretty but odd.
So far they had not spoken a single word to the man and from the looks of it, the man was not surprised.
. We made a pact along time ago. It’s always been us against the world so there can be no secrets between us.” Lily hung her head even farther with Lucians words and winced as her brother continued. “When did this even happen Lily?”
From Lucian
Sherlock and John flew the twins home as soon as they were able. Normally they would both be loathe to leave Moriarty to Mycroft but they had something far more precious to them to take care of. Both of them had spoken of their plan of action when the twins had been asleep and knew they had made the right decision by the look on the kids face when they stepped into 221B.
Then the lights went out.
Sherlock had always thought that sex with John was a gently thing. Easy friction, gentle hands and a slow build. But this time it was different. This time had harsh bruising hands, teeth that nipped and bit and they rolled around to increase skin to skin contact.
"No I actually figured it out on my own. At the moment Gregory trying to take John to the emergency clinic to treat his PTSD symptoms combined with the massive panic attack that the sociopathic arsehole that he's currently in love with brought on."
John sighed and felt the need to bang his head against something but the only thing in front of him was the steering column. So using his common sense, he dropped the conversation knowing that it would only lead to a sulking detective.
He did not like these people; he did not like them touching his John. But if he put up a fuss he knew that his John would get angry at him so when the man let go he placed his arms around John's waist.
"Sherlock it's only been a week and we are already set to kill each other. Now lets start packing so we can go home."
"221B."
“Alright, let’s get going.” Mycroft sighed as his boyfriend walked over to wrap an arm around his bicep. “Sorry love, we don’t get to poke at you very often. So we kind of leap at the chance.” Greg said making Mycroft smile a bit. “Well that is true…”
"Digital pictures always come out to... clean. I like the slight blurriness of the disposable camera." Lily whispered and moved to hide behind her brother.
John watched in awe as Sherlock fought with himself then shook his head with an angry glare that was aimed towards him.
"And do you promise to keep him, love and comfort, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, and to be faithful until death do you part?
. Those two are only 15 years old. You have
"Oh good you're all here." Mycroft announced as he settled onto Johns deciding not to ignore the fact that the twins immediately joined hands. "Relax children I am not here to spirit you away from here. Just to remind your father that your entrance examination is tomorrow." Mycroft said then brushed imaginary lint off his trousers. "Why do you feel the need to tell me what I already know?" Sherlock almost snarled the words only to calm after john placed a hand on his arm.
"I don't know…they were kind of a package deal." Lucian remarked, not lifting his head from his sketching.
"NO...I mean...tea?" Sherlock suddenly demanded looking a little panicky.
Before she could open her mouth to spew more venom John simply stood, drawing everyone's attention immediately. "Before you say anything else… Lily, Lucian, we're going to your room… don't worry it will be a cold day in hell before any of us lets this evil bitch harpy get her claws into you again." John gave a cold smile at the woman before leading the twins up the stairs. He had seen a look passed between the twins and after living with them for a while he could tell when something was 'a bit not good' between the two of them.
"A horror show. The man decapitated his wife by breaking a window and shoving her neck into the shards dad. He killed her simply because she lost her baby after HE hit her in the stomach..." She said as she pulled her knees to her chest.
"Hello?"
"I know Luce…at the moment your sister is ill and therefore defenseless. Being her twin this brought out your protective instincts that are connected to her. But I hope you understand that neither John or I would EVER harm either of you…Neither physically nor sexually. Your too short for John and I prefer blond army doctors." He added making them giggle.
From Lucian
"Brother."
“Your father is a chemist. Particularly brilliant one at that” He said out loud then leaned in to whisper “Don’t let him go on about tobacco ash unless you’re having trouble sleeping.”
Everyone they asked said no.
Lily and Lucian shrugged at each other the silent symbol for 'why not'. "Our mother sold us to our uncle who then tried to pawn us off on our father…he didn't want us so we took off." Lucian responded, his inner turmoil prevalent in his eyes as they were washed in emotion to look like a mirror image of his beloved sisters eyes.
The twins immediately turned around and walked outside towards the garden. They had seen all the cameras that laced every room and they needed to talk where it wouldn't be overheard.
“But still.”
"It's a secret..."
"What the…STOP THE CAR!" he shouted making the driver jump and swerve into the breakdown lane.
"What the hell?" Mycroft asked himself as he walked into his brother's bedroom only to hear the lock flick behind him. "HEY!" He yelled and pounded on the door only to hear John and Sherlock snicker from the other side. "That's not going to work." Greg said from behind him making him turn quickly. "What the?" He whispered and groped for his phone before remembering that John had it. "That sneaky son of a …" He groaned making Greg glare. "Really? You would rather call someone then be locked in a room with me?" He asked sounding hurt. "I don't really have time for this…" Mycroft growled hurting Greg even further.
John sighed and rubbed his forehead. “Come on we’ll help you pick them out.”
“So each class needs a different color binder and notebook?” Lily asked as she picked out a few notebooks, filler paper and binders.
"Of course I Do"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John nodded and thought about how he was going to tell Sherlock.
"Hello Lavonia I don't believe we've met, my name is John and I'll give you some free advice. You don't want to come here again. You see Lily and Sherlock might beat the living shit out of you but I'll just fucking kill you. You see I have killed for Sherlock and I won't give a second thought to shooting you if you ever come near those children again. And I wonder how long you'll last when the Holmes's find out exactly what Bill has tried to do to those children…with your permission. If I were you I'd run as fast as I can…" John's voice was even and quiet as he threatened the woman who paled and fainted.
She was abruptly let go as Lucian balled up a fist and slammed it into the boys nose. "Don't you EVER touch my sister!"
"Why is that brilliant?" Lucian asked with a frown.
"What is what John?"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“And why did they think that we were kidnapped?”
Greg sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. "That would explain it…Have you sat down with the twins and told them that wouldn't happen?" he asked then mentally slapped himself as he realized the answer would be a 'no'. "Well you may want to do that before Lily sends you into a sugar coma." He said at the guilty look that passed over Mycroft's face for a split second.
"You mean they heard EVERYTHING?" John gasped in horror wanting to strangle his friend. "OF course not, our room is sound proofed...why?" He asked gently as he managed to get his angry blogger to lie back down on him and smiling at the disgruntled growl that followed.
"Everything but the tea set and the handcuffs...the handcuffs he can keep." Lucian blushed.
The girl looked up upon hearing her name then settled farther back into the tree roots. Hopefully her father would pass by and not notice her, she could not deal with his anger at her action at this point. Not when she was feeling so fragile that a simple gust of wind could break her.
~~~~~~______________~~~~~~
“Alright…” He heard as the twins left the doorway.
“When they eat cake”
Mycroft watched as the two men bickered back and forth, glad to see that they had their equilibrium back.
~~__~~!
"And what is it that I was supposed to have done?" The younger Holmes growled back.
On and on he droned while Lucian smiled and made re-assuring noises. That was his talent.
John glared and whatever was said was muffled by Sherlocks hand, which made her laugh.
John smiled and went to give his love a kiss when Sherlock suddenly became tense and agitated.
John had never gotten over the fact that Lucian was now a professor.
Three of the adults looked at her with shocked eyes. John just shrugged after all what did they expect from Sherlock's children?
They walked for hours as the sun dipped behind the trees. They still had not found shelter.
“How about you take turns asking questions and try to get to know each other?” John said as he came down.
Lucian was wearing a black t-shirt with the words Whisky Tango Foxtrot on the front and dark blue bondage pants with a multitude of safety pins going down one leg and along the straps in the back, he had pinned a small orange rubber ducky with a Mohawk. He too was wearing steel toe boots.
What it says on the tin :)
It was not entirely unpleasant.
Text Message from: Sherlock
Sebastian smiled and quickly sent a reply and soon they had a conversation going.
"Who the devil are they?" Sherlock snapped at his elder brother who sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
"Did you just call me an animal?"
Even if he is covered in flour.
John held up a hand seeing the warning signs of an argument brewing and said two words to stop it in its tracts. "Baking incident."
Ideas?
Greg knew she didn't mean anything by it, she was only curious. "Mycroft and I want to be closer and moving in was simply the next step in our relationship."
Kyle smiled gently and stroked a hand down her arm until he was grasping her hand, entwining their fingers. "It's going to be alright. Go to sleep I won't let anything bad happen to you." He smiled and held her hand until she fell asleep.
Bed? HE SAID BED! Sherlock's mind screamed and he lifted his blogger up into his arms and carried him into their bedroom, his lips never leaving Johns skin lest the spell be broken and John would remember that he's not-gay.
Finally, John had had enough.
"Oh my god! HEY!" they shouted and started waving their arms to get the attention of passing vehicles.
Greg sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose with one hand. "Yes and my name is GREG not Gregoravich."
Lily grumbled as she sat up and gave the men a heated glare that only managed to look sad. "I don't want medicine I don't want soup I just want Lucian and to sleep." She said on the verge of tears. "Alright I'll make a deal with you, take the medicine AND the soup and Sherlock will get Lucian for you alright?" John said as he rubbed her back. "And if you're good about it I'll make him read to you as well."
That night Sherlock crept from his bed to sneak upstairs into Lily's room, finding her awake and reading a book.
So while Lucian distracted the short psychopath, Lily snuck into Sebastian's room, locating and grabbing the required items with ease. How she missed them before she did not know.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You also get to see some of the old characters that come back into play (Mrs. Holmes I presume?) So here's a synopsis of the last three chapters of this story not including the sequel (or the chapter notes)
"How could I not?...Did you?" John asked as he lifted his head to look at Sherlock's shocked expression. "Of course I liked it, it was with you." Sherlock growled rolling his eyes at John's stupidity not knowing that his words made John melt.
~~_~~!
"Have a nice nap?" John asked from the kitchen making Sherlock jump. "Yes...Why do I have the urge to hold her close until she feels better?" The detective asked making the doctor chuckle. "Sherlock all you want to do is make her hurt go away right?" Sherlock nodded. "Sherlock...that's one feeling I can't explain very well... it's a parental feeling...Love I guess."
Sherlock turned towards the officer, words of venom on the tip of his tongue. But before he could unleash them, Lucian and Lily both tugged on his coat.
"What it's a natural bodily function and the male of nearly every kind of animal goes through it so why be subtle?" Lily asked him making Sherlock blink. "Point proven very nicely thank you." He smiled at her.
~~__~~
"See? He walks past Donovans desk, stops for a second to give her the 'puppy dog' eyes then walks away. They are obviously fighting about something." Lily whispered to her brother as they stalked Anderson throughout his day. Suddenly they ducked as Anderson turned around.
?” Sherlock snarled at the man who visibly gulped.
"Hush you, now…" Mycroft droned on as they went down the highway making John sigh and stare out the window, honestly curious about their surroundings.
Both men stared at the government official before they sat down on the floor backs together. "I'm sorry… we have Colonel Moran on camera…he took the twins…"
The detective tilted his head at John before it dawned on him what the blogger meant. "No john… they are mine and they will be staying here…they are mine after all…" Sherlock responded.
Mycroft stood still for a second as it finally sunk in that John was going to have words with him brother and it was not going to be a pretty sight. "Of course…" Mycroft responded and fled the room with the words of 'Seriously?!' and 'if you think I'm going to clean this up..' ringing in his ears.
"Well yea."
By the time Sherlock and John went to bed they were exhausted from Lily's quick switch from anger to sadness. "How does she do that?" Sherlock asked as he curled around his doctor. "She's a sick teenager...its ingrained in them to have mood swings." John smiled as he lifted his head for a quick kiss. "True...I'm just glad we got the flu shot this year."
"Everyone is someone else's weirdo."
“I still don’t understand how this will work Sherlock.”
Lucian smiled and shook his head. "What did he take this time?"
"What is going on?" Lucian asked frowning down at the angered woman then moved back when she tried to touch him. "She thinks we kidnapped you two." John sighed as he rubbed his temples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John moaned beneath him so wantonly that Sherlock had a lot of trouble holding back from thrusting into his blogger. "Hold on John I don't want to hurt you!" Sherlock said through gritted teeth as John gave a subtle thrust of his hips. "And that's fine but I WANT YOU TO MOVE!" John growled and pulled him down for a sloppy kiss and soon they were moving in tandem. John panting as Sherlock pounded himself into him, each thrust hitting that sweet spot inside of his anus. And too soon for their liking they were racing towards that cliff and jumping off almost simultaneously, Sherlock spilling into John while John spilling across both of them.
“No offence to your father but he forgets to feed himself never mind another living person!” She remarked and shook a finger at Sherlock. “I hope you realize that you cannot keep your lab up here anymore young man. There are children here now and that makes it even more dangerous than usual no matter how old they might be. Now you are more than welcome to use the basement for whatever experiments you wish but you are
"Yep they also have a black and white phone box."
"I know."
"Alright I know you wish to talk." Sherlock sighed giving john his best put upon expression.
"So you purposely manipulated her into speaking even though it made her angry at you?" John asked missing the fact that Sherlock scooted closer. "Yes she clearly was not going to speak while her brother was going to do it for her. She is too careful for that and now she knows that she can speak not only to you but to me as well." He reasoned as he lay against his John, only to jump up as the door opened to reveal the Detective Inspector with Sally and Anderson following. "Alright you know the drill." Lestrade said.
"Yes sir they chatter."
"Sherlock."
Warning C: mentions of prostitution
"Alright Mr. Holmes, Mr. Watson...children. This first one is a simple french vanilla cake with a ganache icing with chocolate liquor and cocoa instead of vegetable oil. It has a luxurious shine when hardens."
"Not helping Luce."
"You might be right but we have no blanket or anything..." Lily said as she shivered silently.
Both twins sighed before turning to look at John and Sherlock. "Explain, Lucian?"
Lily sat stiffly on the small stool, holding her brother’s hands in hers as John tended to the wounds on her back, cleaning them out and sterilizing them before starting to tape gauze over them. Long wounds crisscrossed her back, some deeper than others. Some were fully healed, scars left by wounds long since healed. Her entire back was covered from the nape of her neck to the small of her back. Only a few inches didn't have either a scar or an open wound. John thanked his time in the army for his steady hands most days. Today he thanked that time for it keeping him from openly crying at the pain she must have gone though at the hands of her mother.
"Oh aren't they cute?" Lexy smiled at the twins ignoring the looks she got. "Oh they are very cute…unless they're plotting." John smiled and leaned into his Sherlock, resting his head against his shoulder, which put Sherlock in a good mood. "Oh I remember plotting many things with you while you were here. Actually I believe we are still banned from the library." She laughed making him grin.
“with a chair”
“Demanding everything”
"Yes. Especially because we have officially lost a few of the party goers and the owner looks ready to throw us out." He grinned up at his boyfriend who smiled down on him.
“We get off here.” She snarled and lead them to one of the many park benches.
Suddenly the man lowered his gun. "You speaks English?"
Also feel free to point out any mistakes you find on here. I had a bit of trouble because my computer suddenly went dead (At least some of it's keys did) so I have to write it on notepad on another computer, transfer it to this one paste it on a word document, then upload it to the web… which I cannot do on this site as I have to copy and paste...which sucks! they should allow you to just grab a file from your phone/computer!
Mycroft smiled gently as Greg came over to wrap the army doctor in a hug. "Congratulations man! You finally nabbed the bastard!" He laughed and patted John on the back making him grin.
I rather did hope that you wouldn't get TOO attached to those two cretins. But I do have to admit that the thought of a young pliable mind at my mercy is just…Delicious. M
"Agreed."
Now all that was left was to locate a toggle switch, some wire, solder and solder items. But that couldn't happen until tomorrow. So she hid the camera behind a rock and went back inside.
"John."
“Why are we here?” Lily asked looking around at the store.
"Tired? But he…" Lucian stated but Lily finished. "Looked high and slurred like a drunk?" She almost snarled making him nod his head. "Well we have been up here for a while who knows what they were doing." Lucian whispered clutching her hand in desperation. He knew that if Sherlock were to come in here with the intention to do either of them physical harm they had no way of getting out of there and if HE came after Lucian…Lily would automatically try and get the detective to take out his aggression on her instead. It had always been this way, if someone came after Lily Lucian would jump in and the reverse if someone came after him. But Lily had always been the tougher one even though she was the smaller of the two.
