“She’s a solicitor, Mr Chatterjee,” Sherlock says over Janine’s amused snort. “I have a business proposition for you.”
“That’s very reassuring,” John says, sarcasm heavy in his voice. But he knows, and Sherlock knows, that John will try, because there’s a few people up there who are likely to die otherwise.
“I have a bad feeling about this,” he says, more loudly than necessary, the almost-humming nearly deafening by now.
It screamed through his head while he taught John how to dance, while he was composing the walz. It was nearly deafening on the stag night, during the pub crawl, during that ridiculous game they’d played, drunk and happy and content in front of their fireplace, once more just the two of them, in their chairs, in 221B. John’s hand on his knee, John looking at him with a question in his eyes.
Sherlock looks at John smiling at him, and he knows that John is joking, lightly teasing, taking the piss. He looks down at his hands. “I don’t want her to be like me.”
Mid-day traffic isn’t too bad, and they’re out of London in good time. John falls asleep against the door before they even reach the end of Baker Street, hopelessly wrinkling his shirt, but Sherlock doesn’t have the heart to wake him. The shower, coffee and strudel somewhat revived John, but a 12-hour shift is a 12-hour shift and John often complains about how he’s really too old for A+E night shifts. But there’s a spring in his step when he goes to work, so Sherlock doesn’t take his griping too seriously.
“How is he?” he asks. He knows that John’s kipping on Harriet’s couch after he stormed out of Baker Street three weeks ago.
Sherlock grins into John’s shoulder. John’s post-coital voice is divine, deep and rough, and his vocabulary during and after sex is delightfully flithy.
Is it his duty to try to return so he can die for King and Country, like he always thought was his destiny? Or is the fact that it looks like they’re stuck here his guilt-free escape?
I’ve never had home-made Punschkrapfen before, come to think of it. We all just buy them. But never, NEVER pre-packaged in a supermarket, because these don’t have a sugar icing, they just sort of dunk them in a fat-based red glaze, and that’s not what it’s about at all.
John kisses him back. He tastes of gunmetal and danger, of home and tea and London fog. Of everything good and right in Sherlock’s life.
Generally speaking, emergency meetings at the manager’s office first thing aren’t especially encouraging signs. Two weeks to press night, you just know it’s going to be bad. So John is unsurprised to see glum faces when he walks into Mrs Hudson’s office on Monday.
Sherlock starts a bit at that, because he realises John is right. Sherlock drove them to Baker Street on Sunday, and John went home briefly on Monday, but came to Baker Street directly after work, and today is Thursday, and he’s been here ever since. And the smart part of him, the reasonable part, is saying
It strikes John again how different Sherlock is. Even a year ago, he would have come right out and said whatever he’s thinking, but he’s learned to be cautious. And as nice as it is that Sherlock has learned a bit of tact, a part of John hates that caution because it shows him that there’s still something between them that’s not completely back to the way it was. Sherlock always spoke his unfiltered thoughts to John because he knew John wouldn’t judge him for them and wouldn’t think any less of him, love him any less. Somewhere between Mary and Magnussen and all that endless nightmare of a year between Mary shooting Sherlock and Mary dying and them finally managing to put both those things behind them, that certainty was lost. The last year was good, mostly. John’s back in therapy, there have been cases and adventures and quiet times with Rosie and without her, and slowly, very slowly, they’ve reached a sort of equilibrium again. But they’re not quite there yet.
Now he’s working steadily, and he even gives Sherlock an occasional small smile when he catches his eye, but he’s far from his usual cheery self.
Mary leans back and rests her head on his shoulder. “I don’t know. I just know I don’t want to fuck this up.”
John grips his aching hard cock, watching Sherlock watch him with hungry eyes, and it only takes a few short strokes and he’s coming, and Sherlock thrusts up a few times and then still and shakes apart beneath John.
John blinks at the woman he almost ran over; she’s apparently on her way out the door. She hands him a filled-out questionnaire, and John drops it automatically on a pile of clipboards by the door.
He’s in Devonshire and married to an artist. Both have affairs on the side. Sherlock becomes one of them. It ends when John refuses to leave his wife, who’s pregnant with their second child. Sherlock goes back to London alone.
The room is eerily quiet as the bakers all concentrate on stretching their pastry as thinly as they possibly can. Some of them, like Moriarty and Irene, have no problem, but Anderson’s has torn twice already. Of course he made the crucial mistake of using his KitchenAid, and Sherlock is writing another video in his head about how not to use a KitchenAid.
. He doesn’t really care about the head in the fridge and the Petri dishes in the sink, he just uses them to defend himself against being completely bullied over by Sherlock, which he will never, ever, allow.
It takes every ounce of self-restraint for John not to flinch. “If he’s here he might just do it, but you need to ask him yourself. He’s always liked you,” he notes, sidestepping Mrs Hudson’s implied question.
He sets the bread to prove and feeds up his sourdough starter before putting it back into the fridge.
“Look. Our association has a clear end date. Once either of us is off the show, we’ll never see each other again. So let’s not make this any more complicated than it is,” Sherlock says, gesturing at John with his scone. “Chemically speaking, sex isn’t any different from a good piece of cake. It’s a mistake to attach any particular feeling to either a piece of cake, or to sex. It’s just dopamine, John. You should know that. Chemical reactions in the brain’s pleasure center.”
John finally enters the tent about half an hour before shooting commences, looking stressed. Mary enters directly behind him, looking equally stressed.
"You're excellent godfather material, and you know it, so don't go fishing for compliments, John," Sherlock answers, voice sleep-roughened and deep even through the tinny laptop speakers.
Sherlock swallows and visibly shakes himself out of whatever he was hung up on. “You need to come with me. There's something you need to see.”
The lodestone has started spinning again, and it points directly at the gap between the two largest of the stones.
The snipers hit Sherlock in the shoulder. He remembers this. He remembers pain, and water, and impact, and darkness.
The filo is crisp and browned perfectly, the filling is tasty. It’s a perfect bake, surely good enough to win on Sunday.
John shrugs. “Three days to tech, stage is not even half done, and I’ve got a new cast member. Plus, you know, it’s been a long season.”
Sherlock just grins and sets to work reducing John to a writhing mess of moans and whispered encouragement. He uses his hands and tongue and a tiny bit of teeth and John curses and wraps his hands in Sherlock’s hair and chases his pleasure with his hips, until Sherlock has to pin him down to the chair with strong hands on his hips and just
Well, if he’s entirely honest with himself, he’s having a smoke because he wanted to stop himself from going to look for John right away. And because he’s nervous about going to look for John at all. Flirting in the tent is one thing, deliberately seeking out someone for what can only be described as a booty call is something entirely different.
“He shouldn’t even be here,” Anderson says and gestures at Sherlock. “He makes money from his YouTube channel.”
Sherlock is quiet for so long that John's sure he won't answer. When the answer comes it's so quiet John barely hears. “My father.”
Retracing their steps into the Forest after more than three years feels decidedly odd. It’s farther to walk than John remembers, and he has no idea what to expect when they get there.
Mr Chatterjee sighs. “Nowadays, if you’re not part of a chain, you have to be exceptional, otherwise the tourists will just go into a Costa’s or a Starbucks because they know the taste from back home.” He sighs. “It breaks my heart to think that this place might soon be one of these soulless sameness machines. But I need the money.”
“They’re just as dead if I don’t enjoy my work,” Sherlock answers. “Really, how many times do we have to have this argument?”
Sherlock rolls to face John. They aren’t touching, but Sherlock can still feel the warmth of John next to him, and he knows he won’t wash these sheets for far too long because they’ll still smell like John. John looks tired, more than anything. Tired, and sad. Unhappy.
John rolls his eyes and doesn’t rise to the bait, which means he’s either very tired or very angry or both. Slowly, he takes something from Sherlock’s nightstand.
“Well, it smells absolutely delicious,” Mrs Turner enthuses. “But you do have a lot of work to do, so we’ll leave you alone.”
Six years. It should make a difference that it’s been six years. Six years should have transformed John Watson into a footnote. A side note. A fleeting, fond remembrance.
“How many more times do you intend to say ‘what’ in this conversation?” Sherlock snaps, apparently irritated at John’s stupidity.
John turns his head, and the kiss this time is neither quick nor easy, it’s hard and hot and dirty. “Anything,” John breathes against Sherlock’s lips. “As long as it’s you.”
“I know,” Sherlock says, restraining himself from taking the phone from John to call Mrs Hudson himself and threaten grievous bodily harm if she lets John enter the theatre tonight. “But you have a very competent crew who can do this without you for one night. Or even several.”
“Fuck indeed,” Sherlock agrees, and John snorts a laugh, an unattractive sound that’s ridiculously endearing.
John feels an overwhelming sadness well up in him because this brilliant, unique genius of a person has genuine trouble believing that people love him. “That’s what friends do,” he answers gently, because he can’t force the truth past the lump in his throat.
Sherlock huffs a laugh and straightens from where he was leaning against the side of the catering tent. “Tea, I think.” He nods at John and walks away, and finds to his surprise that the need for a cigarette isn’t as pressing anymore.
“I know,” John mutters, pressing a feather-soft kiss against Sherlock’s brow. "Try not to think about it too much, though. Trick I learned when I was deployed. Try to keep your attention here and now. Makes it easier."
Sherlock nods and lets John go, painfully aware of his own reluctance. “Come on, they’re filming the judging.”
They go back to the theatre, and Sherlock spends the entire cab ride trying not to a) maul John in the back seat of the cab or b) drag John off to his flat and forget about press night altogether.
Sherlock takes John all the way home this time. It’s still raining cats and dogs when they reach London, and John gives Sherlock directions to the block of flats his bedsit is in.
Instead he bakes another cake, and this time he watches it collapse in the oven, and when he tastes it, he wonders how something so imperfect can be so good.
Sherlock shakes his head, still not looking at John. “I don’t… I don’t want to die. Not anymore. And the last thing I want is to hurt you again.”
He has to admit that she’s clever, though, because two seconds ago, he wasn’t going to come to the party, but John’s presence there will practically guarantee his attendance. “Anyway, did he say that he was coming?”
“Thank you, but it’s ridiculous that I co-won with Sherlock. My bake was perfect, and much more difficult than Sherlock’s. His bake shouldn’t have been classed together with mine.”
Molly and John are both examining the body, trying to determine time and cause of death, while Sherlock is pacing, rubbing the crystal fragment between his fingers.
The insecure contestant - whose name Sherlock gleans to be Molly - is insecure for no good reason and actually a very competent baker, as it turns out, her pumpkin spice coffee cake is a hit with the judges, and it looks perfect.
The door bangs open and the other bakers stream in, followed by Mycroft, Harry and Molly's fiancé. There’s a commotion around the table, but Sherlock can’t see what they’re doing, and he doesn’t especially care.
John sits down on the floor next to Sherlock’s head, and Sherlock turns to watch John warily. John smiles. “Trust me,” he says, and he knows it’s unfair to use this knock-out argument, but Sherlock needs help and John won’t be out-stubborned by Mr My-Body-Is-Transport.
There’s a feeling of vague dread rising within John as they walk towards the forest and the almost-humming gets louder, and more noticeable, and this time it's not just coming from the strangely vibrating stone, but from the depths of the forest.
It’s a dark alley and John is unconscious, Sherlock’s hands are slick with blood and he has spent the last eighty-seven seconds breathing air into John’s lungs and willing his heart to start beating again.
John bites at his neck. “I think about you when I’m bored at work, I think about what you do to me, what I want to do to you,” he whispers into Sherlock's ear before taking the lobe into his mouth. “I miss you so fucking much, I miss your stupid violin and your silences and the way you dissect every bloody thing I do.”
“Well, look at him. He’s... “ John makes a vague gesture at the air representing Sherlock, and then gestures at himself. “And I’m…”
“This is riveting telly,” John remarks as he looks around the room of bakers, lounging around, waiting for their dough to prove.
“Of course, of course,” Mr. Musgrave says, gesturing around the room invitingly. “I’m somewhat of a scholar of local history, you know, and I’ve been showing Sherlock some of my findings. He was the first boy to arrive, and in the beginning we had only each other to entertain. Now of course he has you all for company, which is infinitely better.”
“Boring.” Sherlock dismisses John’s patients with a wave of his hand. “Want to come with me to visit Wiggins?”
He tries not to think of the probabilities of them holding John in a similar room. So far, he’s held out, held fast to his cover story, but if they hurt one hair on John’s head, Sherlock will gladly give them everything.
Sherlock shrugs, even though he knows John isn’t looking at him. They’re keeping a carefully polite distance between their bodies, no sleeves brushing or shoulders bumping. It’s oddly unnatural, given the shortness of time they’ve actually known each other. “It’s fine, but it won’t get me the money I need in time. I’m going to have to get my trust fund from out of Mycroft’s clutches somehow.”
“If you have to,” Sherlock answers, and for the first time John has known him, he actually sounds tired.
Sherlock feels his face heat and his skin tingle, as if John’s eyes on him were a physical weight, dragging over his skin. He turns off the heat under his filling and turns to John. “What do you suggest we do in the meantime?”
between them, something electric and dangerous and possibly fantastic, something that has the potential to make them into so much more or wreck them completely, something they both might want.
“What…” John has trouble finding his voice. He clears his throat, tries again. “What…” Apparently, his brain can’t deliver any more than that. In fact, his brain is currently offline.
“Food is pleasure. And emotion. And memories. Why is this week’s challenge nostalgia? Because food is culture, not just science. Food is art, emotion, it’s a way we differentiate ourselves from animals. If it were just ‘A+B, heat, eat’, we’d still be roasting wild boar over the fire.”
He turns back to Sherlock, who’s looked up from his microscope and is staring at them, frowning. “See you later at home?”
John pauses as a thought occurs to him he hasn’t had before. Maybe Sherlock really doesn’t remember him. Maybe Sherlock’s deleted him from his hard-drive of a memory, maybe John’s space in the Sherlock Holmes Mind Palace was taken up by a play, or a new boyfriends, or several new boyfriends, or a wife, or husband, six children…
John laughs. “It goes on like this for another three paragraphs, then he talks about making meringues and never answers the question.”
"Never heard of it," Sherlock says and picks up his box again. "Do you want me to drop you off somewhere or not?"
The display cases are filled with bone fragments, spearheads, arrowheads, pottery shards, barely legible scrolls, animal teeth, human skulls and dozens of other things. The maps on the walls are mostly of the area, marking burial sites and ancient settlements.
“Oh, come on, language isn’t logical. Look at Worchestershire, and explain to me why we pronounce it any differently from Chester, even though it contains the exact same letters in the exact same order,” John retorts, clearly enjoying himself immensely.
And then Sherlock went and broke them back into individual pieces. Granted, he had no choice at the time. And John eventually forgives him, but he’s made a new whole with another person, and even though there are plenty of empty spaces where Sherlock still fits easily, it’s not the same, in fact it is so much
Slowly, Sherlock becomes aware of what exactly he is doing. He becomes aware of his body, of the stiffness of his limbs, that he’s thirsty, and freezing. He places the photo back where he found it, between the well-worn pages, and carefully closes the book. He drinks a glass of water and goes back to bed, trying to ignore the warmth in his chest and the smile that tucks into the corner of his mouth.
Sherlock shrugs. “It was a fair decision. Her pastries were dry and tough, and by far the worst of the bunch. I like Janine personally, but Neela deserved to stay. Her samosa-inspired pasties were much better.”
The crew and bakers eat the leftover loaves while John reads out especially flowery excerpts from Moriarty's blog. Sherlock laughs along with the rest at gems like ‘the milk tasted faintly of the sweet-smelling herbs I had seen the cows eat on our neighbours’ fields’ and ‘among my earliest memories standing in my grandmother’s low-ceilinged simple farm kitchen and helping her make cream cheese is one of my fondest’.
“Nostalgia is a warm hug. This is a very competently made handshake,” Lestrade says, and grimaces at Moriarty, obviously thinking he’s been too harsh. “No offence.”
Sherlock lets out a huff of frustration. Six long weeks, and six weeks of rehearsals before that, and he still hasn’t gotten John Watson to kiss him. He hasn’t been subtle about his interest, either, but John just hasn’t caught on yet.
“Come on, darling, let’s give Daddy some space,” he tells Rosie, who stopped crying when John started vomiting, and is looking at him with an almost academic fascination that Sherlock finds ridiculously endearing for the situation.
It’s a photograph. Washed-up, browned with age, barely recognisable. It’s a girl of maybe six, seven years of age with a handsome soldier in a British Army Infantry uniform from the Great War.
He busies himself with packing up his camera when Irene walks over to his side. “Well, you win some, you lose some.”
“Go on, then,” Sherlock says, desperate to get back to the safe ground of arousal. “Start without me.”
John shrugs. “It was just a random woman I met on the bus. It wasn’t even important. I just…” he sighs, looks down at his hands as if they’re not even a part of his body. “I was bored.” Then he shakes his head. “No. That’s not it. I was lonely. Unhappy. Stuck.”
They finish their stew with John and Mrs Hudson chatting about some of the boys John played football with, most of whom attend their school.
If it were up to him, he would never mention Mary ever again. He knows John feels similarly, and since Rosie has no memories of her mother, she wouldn’t think to ask on her own. But everybody always asks about Rosies’ mum, and Sherlock hates that, almost as much as John does. It’s not even that Mary’s death is so difficult to explain without going into a whole lot of things that nobody needs to know about. It’s the assumptions people make about how John feels about Mary’s death, and how Sherlock feels about it. They assume John is devastated and Sherlock is being noble by helping the poor widower raise his daughter.
The denial is on the tip of Sherlock’s tongue, but then he realises how ridiculous it is to lie to himself. “They won’t kill me.”
John is about to argue - Sherlock’s privileged upbringing sometimes shows, because it never occurs to him that many people just never had his wealth of opportunities - when Sherlock suddenly, triumphantly cries, “I knew it!” and a floorboard comes loose.
He pauses briefly when the waitress deposits his coffee, then busies himself with stirring in too much sugar. Sherlock smirks a bit, because apparently, some things never change, and Victor is still trying to give himself a side of diabetes with his coffee.
John’s at the theatre at three, checking in with box office and catching up on emails and all the things he didn’t have time for during the last few days.
It’s all the permission Sherlock needs. He would like to strip John naked and touch him all over, drive him insane with his tongue and his mouth and his hands, and maybe he’ll get to do all of this later, but now he needs to
“John, you want to join us for breakfast?” Molly says from the other side of the door, and both Sherlock and John exhale in relief.
“Enough!” Lestrade doesn’t yell, but it’s a close thing. He points at Sherlock and John. “Out, both of you. And I don’t want to see you near this case again!”
John gets in about a quarter before midnight. He’s just a bit on the happy side of drunk; his rugby mates were in a generous mood this evening, and he didn’t refuse the pints they put in front of him.
Harry snorts into John’s shoulder and turns her head to look at Sherlock. “He’s such a bloody hypocrite sometimes,” she says, and there’s the same mixture of bitterness and affection in her voice as before. “He can go to Afghanistan and get actually shot, but I can’t have a pint or a fag, otherwise I’m killing myself.”
“You two are adorable,” Molly states, and Sherlock is about to snap at her, but then all of their oven timers announce the end of proofing time, and Sherlock is relieved to be able to go back to baking.
The thing is, Sherlock plays the violin constantly. At six in the morning, in the afternoon, in the middle of the night, he plays while John is trying to eat, sleep, watch telly, work, have a conversation on the phone.
But then he hears the unmistakable sound of a hand mixer scraping over the bottom of a plastic bowl and suddenly he knows where John is and what he’s doing.
Sherlock would like to argue, really, but he feels weak as a kitten, plus John has his determined face on, so he just lets himself be led back to bed, and all but tucked into the sheets.
Two hours later, they’ve done the first run-through, and Sherlock already knows this won’t be a challenge at all. The play is basically four people sitting in a living room and talking, so the blocking isn’t very complicated, and Sherlock knows all his lines. He could probably go on tonight and be good enough. But Lestrade and Moriarty chose the most boring interpretation of his character, a mistake Sherlock intends to rectify.
Sherlock snaps back to the present and Lestrade, who’s standing in the middle of the set. He briefly tracks back through the conversation he was listening to with one ear. Lestrade was explaining the way he sees the characters, and amazingly only half the things he said were stupid.
Sherlock is exhausted. Reaction interviews took forever, and all he wants now is a shower and some food.
Outside, Molly Hooper is leaning against the wall. She’s apparently here to check on Sherlock, but John shakes his head at her. She nods and gestures for him to follow her. Now that Sherlock has pointed it out, he notices she’s a little taller than the other Fey’a he’s met.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Now I know who to turn to if I ever decide to go into the fortune cookie industry.”
At lunch - cheese sandwiches - John doesn’t see Sherlock, so he goes into the library, a large, rather stuffy room, with shelves somewhat untidily stacked with books, some of them obvious schoolbooks, other volumes more ancient and leather bound in locked glass cases.
Sherlock rushes towards the bed and gently presses him back into his pillow. “Tell me what you want and I’ll get it for you.”
He’s sitting against the opposite wall of Sherlock’s cell. Sherlock managed to keep him locked away in his mind palace for the last two years, but sometime during the last few days the wall around the part of himself he’s had to lock away to survive this, the part of himself that
As Sherlock leafs through the book again, he realises that what he holds in his hands isn’t just a recipe book. It’s a slice of John’s childhood. A few recipes were amended in English, substituting ingredients and correcting baking times. Nearly every page is decorated in some way. Stickers of dogs, of cars. Crayon drawings, mostly of cakes. A few recipes that were clumsily torn out of magazines and glued lopsidedly onto empty pages. A picture, used as a bookmark. It’s a faded snapshot of an elderly woman and two children sitting in front of a birthday cake, lit with seven candles. One of these children is obviously John, he’s grinning broadly into the camera, showing an impressive tooth gap. The other child must be John’s sister, she looks about three years older, and from the resentful boredom on her face, it’s obviously not her birthday. The elderly woman is also smiling into the camera, and she’s got an arm around each of the children. She’s a small woman, but her wiry frame speaks of a lifetime of hard work.  The three of them are sitting in front of a small formica table in a drab little kitchen. The entire decor and the faded, brownish quality of the photo dates easily into the seventies.
“So far you don’t disappoint, Sherlock,” Moran adds, and Sherlock smiles in what he hopes is a genuine way and hopefully not expressing what he’s thinking, which is,
Sherlock seems frozen, staring at Sarah's hand on John's arm, and then at John, and there's  an uncomfortable edge to his gaze that John isn't used to. Normally he enjoys the attention, now he feels a curious urge to squirm.
Oddly enough, Moriarty seems to be waiting for him, leaning casually against the back of the catering tent.
A short silence falls, and Sherlock becomes aware that everybody is looking at him. Molly’s near tears. “Oh, thank you, Sherlock,” she says, and takes an abortive step towards him, but seems to think better of it.
Sherlock shakes his head. He lets John go, and John goes to shower, and then John gets dressed, and then John goes for dinner, and he doesn’t come back, and Sherlock doesn’t go after him.
“I think that whoever wins will deserve it, and I’ll be happy with any outcome the judges will deliver. It’s been a joy to bake with these people, and I think I’ve found some friends for life here.”
“You and Ms Adler had quite the chemistry on stage,” the latest reporter asks Sherlock. “Any backstage romancing going on?”
They return the way they came, Sherlock finding his way unerringly. Apparently while John was stumbling after Mr Lestrade in an exhausted daze, Sherlock was paying very close attention, because he leads them straight to the gate they used last night to get into the city. The watchmen pay no attention to them as they walk out of the city gates, and soon they’ve left the city behind. It’s a sunny day, a breeze is blowing from the sea, and John feels invigorated by the sun and the fresh air.
Sherlock is lying on his back next to John, still unconscious. The long gash in his shoulder where the shrapnel hit is clean and bandaged, but he’s pale and looks an absolute mess, scrapes and bruises everywhere, clothes dirty and torn. There’s a large bruise on his forehead, and John supposes he either hit his head when the blast knocked them down or a piece of shrapnel is responsible.
For a moment, Sherlock has trouble finding his voice. Something unspeakable is sitting on his tongue, clogging up his throat. “No problem,” he finally presses out, glad that he manages to sound relatively normal.
Sherlock turns and looks. At first he can’t see what John is talking about, and then he can see a dim shadow slipping into the tent. “Only one way to find out,” he says, and sets off towards the tent.
On Friday, he packs for the competition with no doubt in his mind that he’s going to win, it’s just a question of getting through the days without crawling out of his skin with boredom.
Without letting him think about it too much, he opens John’s blog on his phone, and hates himself a little for the thrill that goes through him when he sees a new entry.
The water is very loud. Sherlock didn’t consider this when he picked the location for their meeting. He picked it for its sentimental value, not its practicality, which was a mistake he would never have made if John wasn’t involved, and it’s the type of mistake he can badly afford if he wants to stay alive through all of this.
“If she came through the Gate, and not that long ago, that isn’t very surprising,” Sherlock observes, looking through the closet holding her few meagre possessions. He takes out a dress that looks suspiciously like a Land Girl uniform. “Further proof, not that we needed it.”
Unfortunately, the grinder stops once the coffee is ground, and silence falls as Sherlock fills the espresso maker and puts it on the hob.
He closes his eyes and lets himself sink into a deep sense of wellbeing as the familiar smells and sounds of 221B saturate him with contentment. In moments like this, between sleeping and waking, he can admit to himself that this place feels like home to him in a way that other places he’s lived in just never have. His childhood home was unpredictable, depending on his dad’s mood and state of sobriety and his mum’s state of health. He remembers feeling content there as well, but the place didn’t wrap around him like a soothing cocoon the way 221B does.
Sherlock helps him sit up and pats his back as he retches into the dewy grass. The sun is shining into his face.
“It’s a foreign language with no resemblance to any language you already know, and you learned it well enough to read a newspaper in the three months we’ve been here,” John points out. He doesn’t say that he himself still has problems with childrens’ books.
John, who’s standing next to him slicing vegetables, humming absent-mindedly along to the sound of music from Mrs Hudson’s radio drifting up the stairs. The tops of his ears are reddened and the skin is peeling a bit, and Sherlock wants to touch, right there, run his fingers along the ridge and feel the softness of John’s skin under his fingertips.
Next, a light coffee cake with a slightly spicy bite, probably Molly’s. The lemon yogurt sponge with kiwi is probably Mary’s, and is honestly not Sherlock’s taste at all. Mike’s offering is a liquid center chocolate cake with a Sacher style chocolate icing, very heavy and far too sweet for Sherlock’s taste. The light cheesecake almost has to be Janine’s, and the hazelnut-caramel is almost certainly Neela’s.
He and Sherlock both sit, and the woman they don’t know gestures at a small tray with wooden bowls on them. “Please have some refreshments. The walk must have made you thirsty.” Her voice is deep and dignified, and her English is perfect.
Victor hasn’t changed much. He’s still tall and blond and handsome and broad-shouldered. The only difference that six years have made is that his eyes are clear and his skin is glowing.
There. Chatting with Sherlock’s mother. He’s wearing a dark blue suit, a white dress shirt, his regimental tie. He’s smiling distantly and there’s an expression of polite interest on his face.
“Anything,” Sherlock breathes, and the part of him that can still think is scared of the absolute nature of that statement, because he means it, right this very moment, John can have
Sherlock looks at him as if he’s punched him in the face, stunned and nakedly fond. Then he fists his hands in the lapels of John’s jacket and presses their lips together.
“War? Weren’t that over when our folks first come here?” Billy asks, scratching his probably lice-infested head in confusion.
“What’s two dead girls more or less to you? Maybe I can even put in a good word for you with Jim. You boys want to go home, right? Well, Jim can make it happen.”
Except Sherlock. Sherlock never seems to be nervous, never seems to have doubts that he’s going to be perfect. Sherlock rarely makes mistakes. Things go wrong, of course. The odd thing is, in the rehearsal room, Sherlock can be a pest about things going wrong, actors messing up, props not fitting, wardrobe malfunctions, but during performance, Sherlock rarely minds, and John knows it’s because Sherlock is fascinated by the unpredictability of theatre, its immediacy, and John knows because it’s the reason he loves theatre himself.
It’s why, when John was told he wasn’t going back, that he’s been released as an invalid, that he’s going home, when he faced the void of a ‘normal’ life, dispensing pills to old ladies, curing flues and coughs, giving shots, he found that when he tried to get out of bed for the first time, his leg wouldn’t hold him anymore, and he fell flat on his face.
“I am well aware how many people are dead, but my point remains. Hope was of limited intelligence, therefore a minor pawn, so catching him, while satisfying, doesn’t get us anywhere with regard to Jim,” Sherlock says, tone still academic but slightly impatient now.
. I was homeschooled until I was nine, John. And I’ve been reliably informed that I’m an obnoxious, irritating know-it-all. I don’t
Sherlock rolls his eyes and turns around, facing John, who’s lying on the bed of Sherlock’s hotel room. John is grinning at him suggestively, and his tone has switched from bored to teasing to flirtatious very quickly. He’s angling his hips towards Sherlock and spreading his legs a bit. “Might have to start without you,” he mutters, voice low and seductive, as he starts to trail his hand slowly over his body and traces the outline of his cock in his well-cut jeans.
Mrs Hudson’s already looking at the Wall, a giant cork board featuring the head shots of every actor who’s ever done a production at Baker Street Theatre and is worth re-hiring. “It was difficult to cast in the first place,” she muses, looking at the thirty something male section of the Wall.
The other bakers greet him cheerfully as he approaches the table. Sherlock nods at the others, then he locks eyes with John, who’s looking at him like he’s simultaneously the person he wants to see most and least, and it tugs at something in Sherlock’s heart, something painful and real.
“Yes, I did. Dr. Sholto was sceptical about trying it out, but he let the patients make the choice in the end, and we had a few that were willing. They’re all on the mend, and now he’s trying it out himself.”
And just like that, Sherlock knows what he was missing. Crunch. Texture. He nods silently to himself and thinks of how he can get a bit of crunch. And then it occurs to him. Filo pastry instead of shortcrust or puff pastry.
He didn’t mean to fall asleep. Shooting and cutting the video took longer than anticipated, and he hasn’t yet uploaded it. Producing new content is vital now, he needs as many social media interactions as possible if he wants to attract serious attention.
He clears his throat. “We spent a lot of time together. We were both young and practically lived at the theatre.”
John just stands there, a small frown line between his eyes, looking at Sherlock expectantly. He doesn’t point out that it’s the middle of the night, and he doesn’t ask what Sherlock wants and he doesn’t complain about Sherlock waking him up. He just stands there and waits for Sherlock to say whatever he wants to say.
John raises his head to look at Sherlock, and Sherlock has the feeling that John knows he’s speaking from personal experience. Track marks scar, after all, and John has had his hands over every inch of Sherlock’s body. Oddly, that knowledge doesn’t scare Sherlock nearly as much as it should. “I guess I just wish it could ever be enough, but I know it doesn’t work that way.”
“Why, because I was intoxicated?” Sherlock says, and he can’t help the acid that creeps into his voice, the irritation that John can dismiss Sherlock kissing him this easily, like it’s an everyday occurrence, like it doesn’t matter, like it doesn’t
He can still feel it, all that ugly, dark, heart-rending grief he carried around with him for the last two years. And the fact that he knows Sherlock is alive doesn’t make it go away. On the contrary, it only makes it worse because it was entirely pointless. It’s a bit like the scar in his shoulder. The bullet is out, but the wound was real and it still hurts when it rains.
John grins at Sherlock and congratulates him, and then goes to comfort Dimmock with the rest of the contestants, save Irene and Moriarty.
Dusk is falling as they walk back into Temera. The Fey’a who brought them to the Midnight Queen none too gently deposit them back on the road to Temera, and made it clear that they are to stay out.
“And when were you going to tell me that you took this job?” Mycroft asks in his most long-suffering tone.
When John comes back (Sherlock doesn’t know why he comes back), the sun has risen. Sherlock is sitting in the living room with his violin out. John doesn’t say anything, just settles down in his chair with his laptop and a croissant. He puts another one on the table before Sherlock. Sherlock eats it even though it tastes like ashes and sand. Then he plays Mendelssohn.
“What I’m trying to say,” John says, a bit impatient, but Sherlock gets the impression the impatience is self-directed. “Thank you.”
Sherlock doesn’t even try to pretend he isn’t distracted, and doesn’t even bother answering Mycroft.
Slow-simmering warmth turns to heat when Sherlock feels John’s growing erection rub against his own. “John,” he whispers against John’s lips, rocking his hips down. “John,” he mutters against John’s throat as he mouths his way down to John’s collarbone, biting, kissing, licking, tasting, enjoying the way John squirms under him, the way John pants into his ear. “I want…”
John’s eyes snap open and his gaze locks on Sherlock’s. “You like that?” he asks, voice husky with arousal, as he strokes his cock in a leisurely, all-the-time-in-the-world way.
“Probably,” Sherlock agrees. “I’ve observed that many people confuse nostalgia for their childhood with a general belief that life was simpler or easier or better then, simply because they were children and had all their needs catered to by adults whose job it was to look after them. Stupid, really.”
John doesn’t answer for a moment, staring into his tea, thinking of that Christmas Day at Sherlock’s parents’, and Magnussen, and that bloody plane, and how all the while he had felt like there was a weight pressing down on him, and another pressing up, and that he was going to be crushed in-between. The rock and the hard place. Forgive his wife, try to make a family with her, with Rosie. Or not forgive her, and take the risk of her just vanishing into thin air, taking his daughter with her.
“No ego problems here,” Mrs Turner says into the camera, and Sherlock can hear John huff a little laugh in amusement.
Molly won this round, her first win, to her great surprise and nobody else’s. Her loaf was perfect. Sherlock’s, Irene’s and Moriarty’s were perfect too, but the others all had issues. John’s was decent but not perfect, Janine’s was underbaked, Neela’s didn’t rise properly, and Mary’s was an unmitigated disaster. If she doesn’t shape up for the showstopper, she’s going home tomorrow, and Sherlock won’t be sorry to see the last of her. She’s subtly flirting with John, and it sets Sherlock’s teeth on edge, even though a) John has so far shown zero interest in her and b) it’s not like he’s in a position to complain even if John did flirt back. The irrationality of the sentiment doesn’t stop it from existing, however, and it’s one of the reasons why Sherlock avoids emotional entanglements.
“I’m sorry,” John whispers, closing his eyes against the tears welling up again. “I’m just really scared.”
“You passed out two minutes after we left the airfield, Sherlock. You’ve been out for over 36 hours. You think I put in an IV line for the fun of it?” John gestures at the IV bags. “So I don’t know if you were trying to kill yourself and failed, or if you thought you were taking a calculated risk and were okay with that outcome, but it was still incredibly, actively, forcefully stupid!”
It’s six in the morning, and Sherlock is woken by the sounds of activity in the house. For a moment, he lies still, listens to the others moving around, bathroom doors opening and closing, the grinding of coffee beans from the kitchen, accompanied by the smell of fresh coffee floating upstairs. He turns his head and buries his nose in John’s hair. John smells of sweat and cheap shampoo and vanilla.  Sherlock is filled with a drowsy sort of contentment, lying here listening to the house wake up, feeling John’s chest rise and fall against his own.
John separates the sponge into three different tins, and adds food colouring to one of them. Then he puts them into the oven and sets the timer.
“So. Last night. Pity you didn’t stay,” Irene says, and the tone in her voice, light and flirty, does nothing to alleviate the knot in John’s stomach.
“The fight against temptation?” John points at the whiskey glass. "Though admittedly this doesn’t seem to be your usual brand of stupid. I don't think I saw any alcohol at all at your flat. Not even a beer in the fridge."
“Sherlock?” Lestrade sounds hesitant, tentative. Like he has something to say that Sherlock won’t want to hear.
He looks around briefly. Most bakers are either passing the time by looking at their phones or have gone to the catering tent for a cup of tea. The camera crew is filming outside with the judges, and nobody is paying them the least attention. So Sherlock beckons John over with a crook of his finger.
“Of course.” Steadying John with one hand, Sherlock bends over and picks up the cane. He hands it to John handle first, and John takes it with a slight unhappy grimace.
John swallows hard around the lump in his throat, relieved that they’re finally, finally having this conversation, and he has a chance to say what’s been weighing on him for six years. “No. No, you were right to take that role. But if you’d taken five minutes, if you’d sat me down and said, look, I need to do this, this is the chance of a lifetime, I would have bloody understood, and I might not have gone six years questioning whether you ever really cared about me at all.”
“Taste isn’t rational, Sherlock,” John answers, and Sherlock knows he’s not talking only about the cake anymore. “Not everything has to make logical sense.” He smiles at Sherlock and takes another bite of his cake. “This is still delicious, you know.”
John curses himself for about the sixteenth time today. It is none of his sodding business if Sherlock decides to shag Irene. It’s none of his sodding business if Sherlock shags the entire company, separately or together.
John nods gratefully and closes his eyes, leaning back against the wall behind his bed. He drifts a bit, not paying much attention when the door opens and closes. He only opens his eyes when he hears the door again and Sherlock comes in carrying a mug and a sweet bun. He hands over both to John with a look that dares him to comment. John wisely doesn’t, but he smiles to himself behind his mug, because trust Sherlock to consider bringing his injured friend breakfast an embarrassing weakness not to be mentioned on pain of immediate withdrawal of the favour.
The small frown line on John’s forehead deepens. “Happens to the best of us sometimes,” he says with a small smile, his voice rough with sleep. “But just so I know, what am I wrong about?”
They stay like this for a long time. Sherlock has lost all sense of time and place, and it takes him a while to realize that he just had sex in an elevator, but that’s quickly eclipsed by the mind-boggling realization that he just had
, no matter what Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson say) a flatmate comes down to his last landlord and the fact that he had Sherlock evicted.
John throws his last stone. It skips, and Sherlock can tell from the first skip that he’ll reach ten.
Something of this must show on his face, because John’s eyes flick to his lips, then meet his gaze, darkening with implicit promise.
“Yes, fine,” John mutters, wiping mud off his jacket and… No. No, no, no, no! “My watch! My watch is gone!” Oh, no, no, no.
“I’m clean. Now.” John hears the finality in Sherlock’s voice and doesn’t ask any follow-up questions.
John lets out a deep breath. “I’ll talk to Mrs Hudson. But first I need to get through tech week, all right?” He downs his shot of vodka. “May I have just one more?”
They walk towards the road arm in arm, not speaking, and he’s eternally grateful for her silent company.
“Um,” John starts, scratching the back of his neck, but trying not to smile. “We… well, we’ve sort of got something for you.”
He traces John’s skull, naming the bones in his mind, wonderful names, lovely names. Occipital, Parietal, Temporal, Mandible. John hasn’t shaved this morning; Sherlock can feel the rasp of stubble when he slides his fingers over the skin of John’s face. It’s entirely fascinating.
They both sit up and look at each other. John’s a spectacle of depravity, and Sherlock is sure that he doesn’t look any better.
John shrugs, a bit embarrassed. “I told her I’d quit if she didn’t do something about Mike. She put Mike on leave and made me stage manager. I’m to hire a new DSM for next season, whoever I like.”
They look at each other in silence. Dusk is falling quickly, making it more difficult to gauge Sherlock’s expression, but John can see an obsessive gleam in his eyes that he doesn't like.
“Your instincts are usually good at this sort of thing, Lestrade, so if you think I won’t want to hear it, you’re probably right,” Sherlock snaps.
Sherlock shrugs. “He’s all right,” he mutters, not taking his eyes off his batter, but he knows there’s a smile tugging at his lips and he doesn’t especially mind.
“Because it means the bridge is still there, we just have to find a way to access it. The mirrors and the metal are obviously a stabilising field, all that's missing is an energy source. That's what was removed! We find out what the energy source is, we can replace it and re-open the Gate.”
Their lips are already parted when they meet. It’s a good kiss – it should be, it’s the fifth time they kiss, after all - real and solid and breathtaking, hot and heavy. John’s lips are soft and wet and feel amazing against Sherlock’s. John’s hands are in his hair, and Sherlock is gripping at John’s clothes, holding him in. His heart is beating wildly, and he thinks that right now he could defy gravity and actually fly.
John looks over and beckons him with a nod of his head, and Sherlock goes over to join the group with surprisingly little reluctance.
“I'm going to the Gladstone for a birthday drink,” John points out. “Seeing as it's, you know, my birthday.”
Sherlock tries to hide his smile unsuccessfully behind his mug. “Shut up,” he says, fondness in each syllable.
The lorry is big and fast and the passer-by who grabs him and pulls him back before he gets hit by six solid tons of moving metal is the only thing that saves him from becoming road kill.
When John wakes up in the morning, Sherlock is still there, right next to him. It’s a bit cramped, but not uncomfortable. Sherlock’s staring at the beamed ceiling, obviously deep in thought.
But all that happens is that he asks himself whether London was always this dull, this damp, this empty, if food was always this bland, if life was always this meaningless before, and he simply never noticed because he was used to it.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “That’s why the show is completely ridiculous, of course. You’d need a bigger sample size for the show to be truly representative. If the jury consisted of a hundred people, individual taste would matter less.”
“We don’t have the budget for bespoke Armani or any of that shit,” Sally grates out through her teeth. “I can’t believe I have to spell this out for you. I thought you were supposed to be so very clever.”
“You didn’t make one,” Sherlock answers after a moment. “It happens. Rarely, but it happens. It probably won’t happen again.”
“No, just a little longer, I need to figure this out,” he mutters, concentrates, and he’s in Baker Street again. The lights are too bright, and he already has an enormous headache, but he can do this, he can sustain it a little longer, he needs an answer. “I can’t go back now, Moriarty’s henchmen would kill him, or use him as bait to make sure I never tell anyone what I’ve found out and all of this would be for nothing, I did all this to keep him out of danger. I need more time, but if I give him more time he won’t wait for me. I need to figure out what to do to fix this.”
John rolls his eyes and gives Sherlock an apologetic look. Sherlock quirks a humourless smile. “Both these things can be true at the same time,” he says.
He is doing his utmost to restrain himself from snapping at anyone, but apparently he isn’t doing a very good job of it, because when the sponges are in the oven, John returns from the catering tent with a second mug for him.
“Sherlock, for the millionth time, I’m not using my patients as guinea pigs!” John protests, but he takes the vial from Sherlock. “What is this, anyway?”
Listra, the pharmacist, walks in from the store room. “What did you do to my mice?” she asks, narrowing her eyes at Sherlock, her wings snapping up, a clear sign of irritation. She’s tiny, but everybody is afraid of her, even Sherlock.
When he finally thinks he won't actually cry, he turns his gaze to Sherlock's face, who looks as shell-shocked as John feels. “John,” he whispers. “I...”
“Yes, well, I’m making an Austrian specialty, Powidltascherln, it’s like Tortellini, only sweet, and I’m doing three different fillings.”
And then John is pulling him in, and Sherlock all but collapses into John’s lap, and then they’re kissing, really kissing, deep, slow, long kisses, and Sherlock wants to die because it can’t get any better than this, ever.
John nudges him with the phone and Sherlock opens his eyes again and looks directly into John’s, and he doesn’t look angry right now, not even a little bit, but Sherlock knows that doesn’t mean he isn’t.
Time slows. Sherlock feels his skin crack. There’s a noticeable distortion in the air, a screeching, humming, ugly sound that seems to come from somewhere inside his head.
Then, slowly, so as to not spook Sherlock, John shifts a bit and places gentle fingers on each side of Sherlock’s temples. He gently splays his fingers along Sherlock’s scalp and starts to gently massage.
“What does that have to do with anything?” Sherlock snaps, irritated at how everything always seems to lead back to this.
They break apart for breath, and John looks up at Sherlock, smiling at him like he’s a winning lottery ticket, hair mussed from Sherlock’s fingers. There’s green bodypaint on his face, on his hands, all over his clothes.  It looks insanely good on him.
There's an audible pause and Sherlock can hear Janine pressing buttons on her mobile. "Added you to the contestant group chat and the extra one for John's birthday. Tomorrow from eight at the Anchor, it's a pub in Camden. Neela and Mary are coming up from Bristol especially, and Molly's in town as well."
He wraps his coat more tightly around himself and shifts to a more comfortable position on the sack of grain that’s currently serving as his seat.
It’s hot and hard and immediate, no hesitation, no false starts. Sherlock’s hands are on John’s arse and John is crowding him against a nearby tree. Sherlock leans against the rough bark and pulls John in, hooking a leg over his and bringing their hips together. He’s hard enough for it to be painful, and he wants John’s hands all over him, he’s starving for it.
And when John’s done wringing the thoughts out of him and replacing them with sensation, overriding Sherlock’s galloping mind with pure physical stimuli, Sherlock sleeps.
“I wonder,” she says, in that way she has, where she sounds cool and detached but is actually angry. “Why did you come after me, if you don’t think I’ll stay?”
The vomiting leaves a giant mess and it’s disgusting, and they need to switch out a few props every other night or so, because the moisture of the porridge mix they use for vomit ruins them. But the run-throughs are going extremely well, and Sherlock is so much better than Jim that even Seb has made his peace with the switch. Mrs Hudson was in on Friday, and today they did a props-only run for the crew on stage, and everything went swimmingly. Lestrade even provided a much-needed laugh when he told everybody to do a “no vomit” run, which definitely goes into John’s collection of things you only hear in the theatre.
John affects Sherlock like nobody else ever has (or very likely will). John makes him feel, John makes him care, John makes him
Lestrade clears his throat, and Sherlock whips his head around, annoyed at both the interruption and at Lestrade’s mere existence.
“Angelo’s, obviously,” Sherlock says, closing his eyes and thinking of the way the buttery risotto melted on his tongue the few times he let himself actually enjoy his food.
Sherlock is gone, the kitchen table is spotless, and the cook is making a fire in the Aga to cook a large portion of porridge for the children.
It's been tough, especially because of the time difference. They text and talk on the phone and over Skype, but one or the other is always tired or at work or has just woken up. But in three days Sherlock will be home for Christmas, and in February John has a week off and will visit Sherlock in Sydney, and in the meantime they'll make do.
“What’s this, then?” John asks, reaching for the container with the shrimp noodles and gesturing at the wall behind the couch.
Sherlock makes a face that John knows means he isn’t entirely satisfied with the words that just came out of his mouth. “There’s a ridiculous amount of snogging going on as well, all very unprofessional,” he adds, and John smiles.
“I brought you something,” Sherlock is saying, holding up something between his fingers, turning slowly, apparently trying to find Jim in the darkness.
“It’s delicious, no doubt. But it’s far easier than some of the other bakes we’ve seen today,” Moran says, frowning with obvious scepticism.
John laughs and leans back down to kiss Sherlock, and Sherlock squirms underneath him, his shirt only half off, pants down to his ankles. He can feel Sherlock’s erection nudging his arse, and he grins into Sherlock’s mouth, rocking against it. Sherlock gasps, and John pulls back. Sherlock’s eyes are dark and wanting, and he moves his hips suggestively against John’s. John feels desire bubble under his skin, making him feel like he can barely contain it, like he’ll burst with it, and nobody else has ever made him feel like this, like his skin is too tight to contain all of this emotion.
When Sherlock arrives, he bypasses the hotel, where a few of the other contestants are already standing around waiting for check-in and heads straight to the tent.
Sherlock’s been gone from Baker Street for 82 days when he wakes up in a small inn in Reichenbach, Switzerland, with a naked John Watson plastered to the entire left side of his body.
The contestants trickle in one by one, and Sherlock pretends that he isn’t looking for John every time the tent flap opens. He ignores both friendly greetings from Irene and Molly, and Moriarty’s death glare. His heart is doing something odd, beating and tripping in his chest. One could almost call it nerves. Or better, anticipation.
Fits well with this week’s theme, though, right? Nothing says nostalgia quite like formica worktops and brown kitchen tiles.
Then he goes upstairs, carrying a plate with a piece of the still warm strudel. It’s the last piece, they sold out thirty minutes ago.
By dinnertime, John is so worried he’s honestly considering going to see Mr Lestrade. He can barely swallow his food, barely listens to Mrs Hudson, every thought in his mind drowned by the worry that Sherlock might not come back. What’s he supposed to do if Sherlock doesn’t come back? He can’t do this alone.
He knows that nobody suspects that he’s actually in love with Sherlock. They all think he’s infatuated or obsessed or dysfunctionally addicted to Sherlock, and that Sherlock regards John like one would a puppy or a trusted secretary. Cute and useful and somebody to shag, occasionally, nothing more.
The thing is, he’s not  entirely sure he can do this again. The whole holding himself together by the flimsiest of strings. The picking up pieces of himself and trying to fit them back together. He’s done this once - or twice - too often.
"Might as well, saves you the trouble of summoning me if it's interesting," Sherlock says, and he doesn't say thank you, doesn't show how much he appreciates Molly's quiet company, but he knows Molly sees right through his attempt to recapture some of the superior arrogance he used to have, when he took kindness for granted and still labored under the delusion that he had no friends and therefore nothing to lose.
After setting up for rehearsal, he goes to get Greg from the steps of the stage entrance, where he’s sitting having a pre-rehearsal smoke.
Finally, he sees John walk over from the tent. He took ages to clear his workstation for tomorrow, and Sherlock has been waiting for him for long enough that his hands are freezing and his ears are red.
He broke when he had to listen to John beg - anyone, God, the universe, Sherlock himself - for Sherlock’s life at his gravestone.
Sherlock shrugs. “My mother is a mathematician and my father is rarely home in time for dinner. Food was a secondary consideration for the entire family. My parents fed us regularly, but neither of them cared much about cooking, or baking. The only person in our house who could cook was my nanny. She used to let me help her with baking. Sticky toffee pudding was my favourite recipe of hers. We often had dessert for dinner when she was alone with us children, when my parents were away. She’s mostly to blame for my brother’s sweet tooth, I suppose.”
Sherlock finishes his cigarette and throws it into the darkness, a glowing ember trail until it falls to the earth and extinguishes.
“I think I’ll risk the catering,” John says with a grin that looks a tiny bit forced. “See you in ten mintues. If you see smoke coming out of my oven, just pretend it’s supposed to do that.”
The moon is full, which Sherlock thinks is a nice touch. It’s spring, a warm day, but it cools down significantly when the sun has set, and he’s glad for his coat. It’s objectively a perfect night, stars twinkling, the darkness hiding them from cameras and the Fall making it impossible to eavesdrop on them. Also, the chances of being followed here without being noticed are practically nil, and he’s sure Mycroft has several spy satellites aimed at his precise location right now.
It’s apparent that John has no intention of going anywhere right now, if the way he’s kissing Sherlock is any way to go by. Sherlock kisses back and loses himself once again in the simplicity of the body.
“What do you hope to find that the police missed?” John asks, even as he steps closer to the building.
Their mission goes spectacularly wrong. They knew who he was and what he was doing. Somebody tipped them off.
Shortly before bedtime, finally, finally, their door opens and Sherlock comes in, followed by another boy, about their age, with shaggy blond hair, bedraggled clothes and a belligerent expression.
“Next time, just stick it in the freezer,” Molly advises, and Sherlock looks up from his phone, surprised, because that’s just about the only way to ‘fix’ runny choux pastry without completely ruining it. In fact, Sherlock made a video this week on the chemistry behind choux pastry, and he recommended this tactic of fixing them.
Sherlock extricates himself less than politely from his uncle Robert and casually walks over to the little group. The two women are talking at John, and John looks like he’s listening politely, but Sherlock knows that look, and he knows that internally, John is naming all the bones in the human body right now to keep calm.
Sherlock opens his mouth and closes it again, because yes, he did, and that wasn’t planned in any way, shape or form. But it’s true, nonetheless.
Sherlock concedes the point with a dismissive hand wave. “I’ll make you some chocolate chip scones back at the bakery. But you make a good point about the BBC.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Not really. I find detective stories slightly less dull than other literature, but I prefer reading about forensic science and real police investigations. Mr. Musgrave has some interesting volumes on the subject.”
His eyes snag on the opposite page. The one with John’s birthday cake on it. He thinks about asking John about the baking instructions that make no sense, but decides against it because the last thing they need is an argument about baking.
Sherlock huffs. “There’s no reason to get annoyed at me, I hardly arranged for the elevator to stop.”
John turns around to face Mycroft. “You really want to have this conversation now? In the middle of the bloody night after I was almost burned alive?”
He looks at Sherlock, and there’s an expression in his eyes that makes Sherlock’s breath catch. “You used my gran’s recipe.”
“This has to be the most uncomfortable Christmas Eve I’ve ever spent,” John complains, checking his watch. It’s been about twenty minutes since the power outage, but it feels longer, sitting here in the semidarkness, alone with John.
Sherlock smiles at nothing in particular, glad that the social contract in public transport forbids eye contact. He checks his emails and sees that the Bake Off producers have sent them the information for next week's theme. “Hidden”. The technical challenge is filled and unfilled doughnuts, and the showstopper is hidden design cakes.
And every minute he sits here, it gets harder to resist the temptation of John’s smile, his laugh, the adorable way he chews his chips, the sauce dribbling down his chin, the way he cocks his head and asks a thoughtful question about Sherlock’s parents and what they’re up to.
Sherlock clings to Rosie as a quiet sob racks his frame, as something ugly and complicated takes him by the neck and wrings a sound out of him, something that’s part grief, part guilt, part purely selfish fear that he’s lost the only family he cares about having.
“I need to do a proper autopsy now,” she says, a pretty clear signal that they’re supposed to clear out. “I’d also like to look at your ribs, John.”
And the Gate. It’s an ever-present drumming in his ears, behind his eyes, vibrating between the very bones of his skull.
She smirks at him and holds up her hands in a disclaiming gesture. “Fine, I won’t say anything else.” She looks over at John again and her smile softens. “You’re lucky,” she says, and her tone is a bit wistful. “He’s a good one.”
At some point, John joins him in the sitting room. He sits in his chair and listens to Sherlock, just being there, like he was there in Sofia and Kiev, in Malta and Nice and Beijing and Dubai and Serbia.
It lasts forever and it’s over too fast. John collapses on Sherlock, and kisses his shoulder, and mutters “Fuck,” and “so hot” but won’t look at Sherlock at all, and Sherlock lets him do this too, lets John hide his face in Sherlock’s shoulder, and he drops a soft kiss on John’s hair and wonders why this feels like a last time, like goodbye, like John isn’t even here anymore even though five minutes ago Sherlock was literally inside him.
John searches his face with his eyes for a second, then, apparently dissatisfied with what he’s found, he nods, turns and walks away without another word.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but he’s smiling. “Can we go now?” he asks, trying for annoyed but failing somewhat. “You’re the one who always goes on about how you need to sleep and how I’m a bastard for waking you up at three in the morning.”
Sherlock doesn’t answer, just smiles, and turns his wrist to grab John’s arm, just over his pulse point. He pulls, and John goes with it willingly.
It’s still pitch dark when John opens his eyes. Sherlock is sitting on his bed, staring at him. He groans and turns around, trying to pull his blanket over himself more firmly.
“Can’t you get a bank loan?” John asks, dumping the potatoes he’s peeled into a mixing bowl. “You got a potato masher?”
“Now we go look at the Gate,” Sherlock says, sounding, John’s pretty sure, more confident than he feels.
Sherlock stays in his seat for a moment, closing his eyes to visualise the play, planning out the scenes where he can insert some subtle flirting.
“It’s a city,” John says for what seems like the hundredth time as they slowly make their way towards the city gates. “It’s a god-damned hidden city right in the middle of bloody Devonshire, and I’m pretty sure that’s not Exeter, either.”
Sherlock smiles, trying to appear relieved, when in fact he’s more tense than before, because now it’s down to John or Moriarty, and at least Moran is heavily biased towards Moriarty. Molly hugs him again, and he catches John’s eyes over Moriarty’s head, and John gives him a brilliant smile and a thumbs-up, but he looks about as apprehensive and sad as Sherlock feels.
John nods. “All right.” He cracks a grin he doesn’t really feel. “Would be boring here without you anyway.”
“This is getting better and better,” John grumbles under his breath, drawing Sherlock’s arm over his shoulders and taking much of Sherlock’s weight.
“Ambitious,” Sherlock answers equally quietly, instantly catching the thinly veiled suggestion. “Tempting. But no. People are already talking.”
John’s hair is still short and blond, but a bit longer than he used to wear it. He’s grown into his sturdiness, and the black t-shirt he is wearing shows off his broad shoulders and muscled arms. He’s a bit scruffy, hasn’t shaved this morning - early meeting, paint splatter on his shoes - went to check on the set,  squints lightly - should get glasses but won’t, stubbornness - and that’s another thing he remembers, suddenly, the stubbornness that made John work three days with a broken toe, and coming to work with the worst cough Sherlock has ever heard in his life.
"Three options. One, forget about the bakery idea and rely on the business you already have, which would be the most financially sound advice" she says, enumerating points on her fingers. "Two, bide your time and look for another location until you've saved enough money to open your bakery, even if it isn't on the premises you want. Third, I could try to get you a bank loan."
Mary holds out a hand to help him up. “Why are you apologising for being human, you clod? Do you think there’s a person in this crew who would blame you for needing a break?” She grips his shoulders. “We need you. We need you healthy, well-rested, and happy. Understood?”
John shrugs, half embarrassed, half defiant. “I saw it on YouTube. There’s this chap who’s got a baking channel. Bit of a posh git, but he’s got some good ideas about baking.”
“How about we get you home?” John says, gently, glancing at Sherlock as if he’s simultaneously glad and embarrassed by his presence. “Can you tell them?” he nods in the direction of the pub.
“It’s all right. No better and no worse than any other place where I have to endure the presence of fifty other pubescent boys.”
Moriarty glares at all of them. “We’ll see how funny you find all of this when I win without fucking a co-contestant.”
He pushes himself off the wall, grabs his case and goes inside. He’ll just go up to his room, maybe have a shower, get something to eat. If he runs into John, fine. If not, also fine.
“Thank you. Your savoury scones looked delicious,” he returns the compliment, genuine as she was, because they’re professionals who respect each others’ skills, even if they’re competition.
“It’s not too bad,” John muses as he cleans the wound, a little less gently than he normally would. “Doesn’t need stitches.”
John snorts, and Sherlock looks at him for the first time since they’ve started filming. He’s been doing his best to ignore John, and anyone else in the room. They’re just distractions, especially John, who’s wearing a blue shirt that sets off his eyes and jeans that hang off his narrow hips, showing where he’s lost weight recently.
“This isn’t over,” Moriarty growls, and Sherlock knows Moriarty is talking mostly to him. Then he turns and storms out.
With an effort, John calms himself. If he starts down this road, he’ll never get through the production. He reminds himself that the fact that Sherlock was this epic, wild, head-over-heels-world-spinning-heart-thumping-larger-than-life affair in his mind, doesn’t mean their relatively short relationship wasn’t some casual fling for Sherlock he remembers fondly but doesn’t hold any significance six years later. The way it ended does seem to suggest that all he’d been for Sherlock was a bit of fun and some extremely good sex.
But Sherlock shakes his head, because there’s something else he needs to say. “I didn’t think he’d escalate like this. I underestimated him. I didn’t realise just how unhinged he really is. That’s a mistake I certainly won’t make again.”
Lestrade looks from Sherlock to John, fixing them both with his most forbidding glare. “I mean it. I know you think the Gate has reopened, but it was destroyed. You saw that with your own eyes.  And even the Fey'a don't know how to open a new one.”
He knows he can’t go back to a John Watson whose eyes would go dark if Sherlock dropped his voice a little. He can’t even reasonably expect the John who used to tell him bad jokes, share backstage gossip, complain about his day.
“Oh god, you nutter,” John whispers against his mouth between teasing, licking kisses. “Do you have any idea, any concept of how much I’ve missed you?”
John looks down at his pie crust. “Patience,” he finally says with a self-deprecating grin. “Not something that comes naturally to me, admittedly, but sometimes, the most important thing you can do for a bake is just to give it time. Time to rest, to prove, to bake. Sometimes, when you’ve done all you can do, added all your ingredients, you just need to be patient and give the bake the time it needs to come together. And that’s how you get a perfect bake.”
Then, finally, his mother excuses herself and leaves the two of them alone, or as alone as one can be in a room with fifty strangers milling about.
“This is ridiculous,” he greets John when he comes in the door. “This so-called Doctor, Miss Hooper, insists I need to stay here for another day at least. I feel absolutely fine!”
John nudges him and holds out his hand. “So?” he says, trying for nonchalant, but coming out nervous. “You want to go home?”
John hears him, and slowly turns around. Sherlock notices the gun in his hand, and the torch, both of them pointing directly at him. He lowers both when he identifies Sherlock, hands steady, perfectly still, and that alone tells Sherlock how tense John is. His eyes are wide and so very blue, even though Sherlock can’t see this right now. John in moonlight looks like a sepia version of himself. He also looks tired, and shell-shocked, and like he has no earthly clue what to say. Which is pretty much exactly the way Sherlock thinks he must look, because it’s how he feels.
“We’re going to have to assume so,” Sherlock answers, stopping in front of the oven. He opens the door and stabs the fire viciously with the poker Ginger gave John last night. “Damn Jim, I’ve spent years cultivating a relationship with them, and he just… pays them better!”
John rolls his eyes, and the effect is somewhat marred by a yawn he tries to hide behind his hand. “You’re not a sociopath,” John says, “For the record.”
“You used to take them home and dissect them, and leave parts of them all over my fridge, if I remember correctly. I found pieces of these damned things for months after you left,” John interjects, and he means it to sound annoyed, but it comes out wistful, and he hates himself a little for it.
He gets into bed, and in the silence that settles he can hear Sherlock’s breathing, and he knows he’s as awake as himself. Normally, he wouldn’t think anything of it, Sherlock often doesn’t talk for hours or sometimes even days, but this time the silence is definitely uncomfortable.
As soon as the door closes behind them, Sherlock backs John up against it and gets his hands under his dressing gown, peeling it off. John reels him in for an open-mouthed, hungry kiss, curling his tongue around Sherlock’s in a way that goes straight to Sherlock’s cock and makes it twitch. Since there’s nothing separating them except the thin fabric of threadbare pyjama bottoms, John can surely feel Sherlock’s reaction, if the smug grin he smiles against Sherlock’s lips is any indication.
Sherlock bites at John’s neck, and John’s hands grab Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock moans when John’s fingers brush along the hem of his pants, and he thrusts against John mindlessly, seeking heat, seeking friction.
John chuckles. Sherlock feels warm all over. “You keep telling yourself that,” John mutters, obviously amused. His voice has hit that register that goes straight to Sherlock’s groin, and he realises that they’re tethering on a dangerous precipice here, playing at keeping their footing on an extremely slippery slope.
John crowds him against the wall, hands finding their way unerringly under Sherlock’s coat and his suit jacket, a demanding thigh pressed between his. “You need a mint,” John whispers against his throat, and when Sherlock tilts his head back in invitation, John bites him there, ever so slightly.
When he’s sure that everybody’s set for tomorrow, he goes backstage into the green room that serves as the stage crew’s office and helps himself to a beer from the fridge. He sits down on the decrepit sofa and takes a deep breath.
“Mother,” he says, smoothly inserting himself into the conversation, “Mycroft is teasing the Bishop of York again.”
The words sting, and Sherlock is asking himself whether he should just leave, when John speaks again. “My therapist says I’m angry with you because I’m really angry with Mary, and you’re a convenient target because you’re still around and she isn’t.”
He takes a deep breath and walks out into the rehearsal room to face another fucking day of the nightmare this production has turned into.
sorry I shot him,” Mary says quietly, matching her tone to John’s. “But I don’t know how to prove it to you. And I don’t know where we can go from here. I want to try to fix this, John.”
John tumbles them down to the bed, and Sherlock loses track of time for a bit as John covers him with his body and grinds their hips together.
John gets up and uses the bathroom, then pads into the living room, after wrapping himself in a sheet from the bed.
The man sets down his cup of tea next to the hob and starts rummaging around in the drawers and cabinets of the work station next to Sherlock.
“It had no Wi-Fi and no phone reception. When I found you there you were ready to chew the bark off the nearby trees,” John says, gesturing at his head to indicate Sherlock’s deteriorated mental state.
“Tell you what,” John says, leaning closer to the computer screen as if whispering into Sherlock’s ear. “You come home, and I’ll get you a sex thing for your stocking. Something completely, entirely, thoroughly naughty. Deal?”
So he goes home alone, and opens a small bottle of champagne, and after he’s drunk most of it, he gets the box with his Uni things from the attic. It’s dusty and a bit warped by damp, but the contents of the box are still in good condition, such as they are.
John snorts. “Yes, well, that’s abundantly clear to me. But what he said wasn’t actually so bad, he just said that he might have to get used to me after all.”
This year, his mother has decided that rather than staying in their country home in Yorkshire and summoning her sons there, she’d descend to London, rent an entire floor of the Savoy and host a gigantic Christmas party to welcome her lost son back into the land of the living. Sherlock has no doubt that she was the one person Mycroft chose to tell about the exaggeration of the rumours of his demise, as evidenced by her total lack of surprise at his reappearance, but she still chooses to pretend that she didn’t know, just to guilt him into doing things for her. Like coming to her party.
He tries to talk, one day. He opens his mouth to tell her something meaningful, something important, something that will help him and not give away something about himself he’d rather not have her know.
Sherlock takes the tea and sips it, and of course it’s perfect, just the way he likes it, and he accepts it for the truce offer it is.
“Yes, but the Watch thinks it was a Fey'a, because humans don't care about Fey'a crystal, apparently. Seems some humans do,” Sherlock adds, with a gesture at the wall. “I think I'll write an anonymous tip to Lestrade.”
Molly follows Janine out of the room, but Irene stays and looks between them. “The jam is really nice, Sherlock,” she says, then hands John his cane, who takes it with a slightly embarrassed frown.
“Was the place that horrible?” John asks, because something about Sherlock’s light tone rings awfully brittle.
John elbows him in the side, but he’s trying not to smile, and Sherlock is deeply familiar with the feeling.
John debates for a second, but curiosity wins over caution and he asks the question he’s been wanting to ask since Day 1. “How was Broadway?” By which of course he means, how have you been, tell me everything.
Lestrade gestures at the stage. “Let’s do a run-through and try it out. Adriana, you notice right away, Seb, you only notice when I tell you to, right? And just go with it, we’ll refine it as we go along. Let’s take ten while John resets.”
“Tea?” Sherlock asks and flicks the kettle on. “I’ll add some lemon juice to the poppy seeds for the next batch.”
Someone removed them and stacked them neatly on the end table. John guesses it’s the same someone who turned off the light and covered him with an ancient  but extremely comfortable blanket.
Sherlock’s voice is so weak John isn’t sure he’s actually heard it for a moment, exhaustion blurring the lines between reality and imagination.
He’s explaining the chemistry of it while the mixer turns the cream into curd. He turns the mixer off and looks into the camera again. “So, Rule One. Always, always whip cream by hand. It’s nearly impossible to over-whip it when you do it by hand. Rule Two: If you’ve already curdled your cream, don’t throw it away.”
What he doesn’t remember is that John drags him out of the pool, presses his lips to Sherlock’s to get him to breathe, and massages his heart for about a minute before cardiovascular activity recommences.
He collapses in a graceless heap on top of John, who’s sprawled bonelessly over the uncomfortable chair. John’s hands travel over Sherlock’s body, long, slow, almost petting touches that feel insanely good without being the least arousing. It should worry Sherlock, this fuzzy warmth, but right now he can’t be bothered. Right now the dopamine is in charge.
Mrs Hudson’s hand finds his across the worn leather of the seats, and squeezes. “That was a beautiful walz, dear.”
John needs a flatmate because he can’t afford to live on his own. Sherlock’s situation is exactly the reverse. None of the reasons Sherlock has a flatmate have anything to do with money, because that is one commodity Sherlock has plenty of. Of course, John, having met Mycroft and having seen the way Sherlock dresses, should be perfectly aware of this. How he has so far failed to make this deduction is something Sherlock quite frankly marvels at every time John belabours the point of Sherlock accepting remuneration for his work or getting what John calls a ‘regular’ job.
“Okay, Mr Sociopath, who brings me water and cleans up my vomit, who tucks in my daughter, and does Mrs Hudson’s shopping when you think she isn’t looking, do you know how I know you’re not a sociopath?” John’s tone is both long-suffering and fond, and he too seems to be enjoying the old argument.
The party in the green room is in full swing. Mrs Hudson has decorated a bit, put up a small tree, some tinsel and fairy lights, so the usually drab room looks rather nice.
"He's worried about you. He would never say so, of course, but he is," Molly says, having followed his gaze.
“Oh, poor thing.” The old man shakes his head mournfully. His hair is lush and white, and he's wearing spectacles. His gossamer wings and tiny stature are all that set him apart from every librarian John has ever met on Earth. “She was such a ray of sunshine. Always smiling, just so happy to have a job.”
“Easily remedied,” Sherlock says and holds out his hand. John drops his phone into it, and Sherlock programs his number into John’s contacts.
he wants to say, but the word sticks in his throat, because it’s not true. ‘The house where most of my things are’ is a more accurate description, but it’s a bit unwieldy. So John makes a vague gesture in the general direction of where he thinks his current place of legal residence is and leaves it to Sherlock to fill in the blanks.
John winces at her obvious pain. He would like to say something comforting, but there really isn’t anything that will make her feel better. Her friend is dead.
“You did what you had to do,” Victor continues, never one to let a silence sit. “And I can’t say that I didn’t resent it at the time, but on some level I understood even then. Part of me would have given anything to walk away, but I wasn’t ready. But somehow we both survived, and that’s the thing that matters now.”
Mycroft turns to Sherlock, and there’s an unpleasantly superior smile playing around Mycroft’s smug face. “This development certainly explains a lot.”
“On day one of our acquaintance, you cured my limp. I was a total stranger, and you cured my limp.” John makes a sort of ‘there you have it’ gesture.
Apprehensive without exactly knowing why, John follows Sherlock closer to the stones, carefully stepping over smaller stones and boulders that seem to have melted into the earth. “How old do you think this is?”
When he wakes up, it's just before dawn and John is still deeply asleep. He slides out from under John’s body, gets dressed and leaves.
“He doesn’t know where it is,” Sherlock points out. “We could have hidden it literally anywhere, and I think he’s running out of time. He has to have the lodestone because he needs to expand his operations to keep his men well-paid.”
Sherlock snorts. “I can’t imagine what possible difference there is between cooking and baking. If anything, baking is much harder, because you need to be more precise. It’s just chemistry, both of it. A plus B equals C. Easy.”
He loses track of time, as always. Before he knows it, the stage is dark, the lone green headlight illuminating him as he speaks the well-known closing words. He feels every eye in the house on him, and none of them matter as much as John Watson’s, who is waiting in the wings, smiling with the obvious excitement of live performance that he isn’t yet cynical enough to hide.
They enter the house through the back entrance, careful as always that nobody sees them, and find Billy in his room, making himself a cup of tea. His second-in-command, Ginger, is also there, sitting on Billy’s bed. She’s playing with one of Billy’s knives and looks bored when they enter, her wings beating lazily.
There was so much blood that night. On John’s hands, soaked into his jeans. He threw those jeans out. Couldn’t look at them anymore.
There’s a soft, nearly whimpering sound, and Sherlock is shocked to notice it’s coming from him, and then he leans his head forward into John’s chest, into one of his hideous jumpers, and just breathes John in, the warmth of him, the tea-doctor-home smell of him.
Finally, Sherlock drops his hand and steps out of the metal ring. He lets his gaze wander over the clearing. “What are we missing?” he mutters. “There must be something we're missing. Why did it work yesterday and not today?”
And then he does. “No, you bloody well didn’t,” he sobs, and Sherlock is across the room before he even knows what he’s doing. He’s on his knees in front of John’s chair, and John’s head is on his shoulder, and his hands are rubbing John’s back, and he feels John’s wracking, ugly sobs shudder through his entire body. He closes his eyes and pretends not to enjoy this, all this closeness and touch and body heat. He is so very tired of pretending.
He decided to use Janine’s mistake as an inspiration and shows how to make a white chocolate frosting, using good quality white chocolate.
Five place settings have been put before five chairs. The settings contain two slices of Sachertorte on dessert plates, two dessert forks and a glass of water, to cleanse the palate between tastings.
John just grunts. He’s numb with exhaustion, he’s cold, hungry and his feet hurt. All he wants now is a hot meal and bed, and they can figure out the rest tomorrow.
“Yes,” Sherlock mutters against John’s lips, chasing after the kiss, “yes, yes, never, I promise, just kiss me again.”
"Conjecture or experience?" John asks. He gestures at the bartender for a half-pint, and Sherlock is both glad for the company and frustrated that this company has limits.
But all the way back to the tent, he feels John’s eyes on him, and when he looks at him out of the corner of his eye, the expression on John’s face is wistful, almost sad.
“It doesn’t matter,” he says, waving the argument away with an impatient hand gesture. “I’m here now. Will you come back with me?”
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock automatically responds, shaking the offered hand. Strong and affirmative grip, interesting calluses. Guns, something else. Ex-military, obvious. Definitely not the type of person Sherlock expected to meet here. He thought he’d compete against bored housewives and middle-aged, pudgy men in the throes of a midlife crisis. This man is neither.
The silence is absolute, save for the sounds of a forest at night. The hoot of an owl, the rustling of leaves as small animals forage for food. The steps of an underweight, tall, sixteen-year-old body on thick under-brush.
John’s startled laugh is surprising but welcome. He looks at Sherlock, and Sherlock knows that they’re going to be alright. Not tonight. Not tomorrow. Not for a long time. But eventually. And something passes between their eyes, unspoken like the best of their moments, and in that moment he knows John knows too.
“I was going to say no,” Sherlock says, still turned to the window, letting his violin sink away from his chest. “Six years ago. I got the offer, and I was going to turn it down, because I wanted to stay in London. I wanted to stay with you.”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock says. “Stake out the museum? I’m assuming they’ll try to rob it without Kitty now.”
Sherlock laughs and the sound echoes around his empty kitchen. Something curls tightly behind Sherlock’s breastbone.
He admits to himself that it’s tempting to not bother with this boring mess of a show anymore. The theme for next week is nostalgia, which is so trite that Sherlock was glad that nobody saw his impressive eye-roll when he opened the email. The technical is Battenberg cake, and the mere thought of that bake is enough to make quitting seem like an excellent idea. He also has no idea what to do for the showstopper, since nostalgia is a feeling that he never indulges in, and that no period of his life remotely instills in him.
It's late when Sherlock's finally ready to go, after interviews and call sheets for next week, after packing up his things. He's the last of the contestants, the others have been gone for at last half an hour. The only people left in the tents are a few tired technicians who will be rolling up cables and packing up lights for another hour at least.
The Berkshire mansion-turned-hotel that the producers have picked for this week of filming is surrounded by a lovely garden. Filming will take place in a large tent. Sherlock carefully picks his way over the mass of cables and equipment, carrying the plastic box with his utensils and special ingredients.
She opens the door to 221A and vanishes inside, and he goes up the steps to 221B and sits in his chair, staring at John’s chair, wondering about loneliness, and about how you only notice it when a space that was filled is suddenly empty.
Sherlock looks at John, morning paper in front of him, buttered toast on his plate, breadcrumbs sticking to his lower lip, sitting there in his black-and-white pyjamas, his hair still unruly from bed, looking pleased and a little amused because he spiked Sherlock’s tea with antibiotics and Sherlock is drinking it anyway, even though they both know Sherlock knows. And suddenly Sherlock almost can’t breathe because he feels his throat constrict and his heart beat faster and his stomach clench.
Something twists in John’s chest. Something deep and fond and quiet, something that’s been there so many years that sometimes John forgets about it. Something that says,
Sherlock thinks of the text he got from his brother after the scene with John, one line that just read,
The world fades away as Sherlock sinks into the deep concentration he only ever experienced with baking, and sometimes when he plays the violin. Mixing, silcing, tasting, more sugar, then the crust, beautiful flaked butter kneaded into the flour, careful not to overwork it.
So there’s still a smidgeon of hope. If he can get the capital. “Don’t sign the contract before talking to me first.”
“Did he ask either of you to do anything for him?” John asks the next obvious question, earning an approving look from Sherlock.
“So,” John says, quietly, his breath ghosting against Sherlock’s sweat-damp skin. “That happened. Again.” He sounds equally amused and confused.
Sherlock is utterly incapable of making sense of the sounds the voice is making, but he’s able to connect the voice to the face hovering above his.
John turns his head to give him a small self-deprecating smile. “I was just thinking of what it would take for me to trust Harry again. If she stopped drinking right now. How long she would have to be sober for me to believe it.”
John swallows, and hates himself for how much he wants Sherlock to not go. “Could you…” he begins, but can’t finish the sentence around the lump in his throat.
When John calls the fifteen, Sherlock can’t take it anymore. He passes quietly through the stage door and goes to stand in the wings, listening to the house come in. John’s at his stage manager’s desk and checking with Sally over the intercom that everything’s set.
Sherlock smiles politely and lets Victor ramble on about the adoption process and how nerve-wracking it was, and he suddenly wishes he’d done this years ago, because he feels relief, and very little of anything else. Victor is happy, and sober, and Sherlock knows with a certainty he never had before that if Victor had left with him six years ago, they would still never have made it as a couple.
Then he notices the jam-crusted small handprint on Sherlock’s dressing gown and a small laugh escapes him.
John shrugs and rubs a hand over his face. Right now, he has no idea why he did any of the things he’s done over the last year and a half. “Guess I wanted to give our daughter an outside chance of remembering your face,” he finally says, because that’s as good a reason as any.
Sherlock holds open the door and John steps through. The kitchen is much better lit, and Sherlock keeps it spotless, so he knows the contrast must be jarring. The dusty, broken cafe and the warm, well-kept kitchen, the old but large baking oven, the gleaming surfaces.
John laughs a bit, more breath than sound, but it’s a real laugh, and Sherlock smiles, because John is back from wherever he went, back in this kitchen, in his body, in the here and now.
“How did we not know this is here?” John asks, checking his map. “It’s not on any of Mr. Musgrave’s maps.”
Irene walks over to him, as always she moves like a tigress on the prowl. “Congratulations, Sherlock. The savoury macarons were a stroke of genius.”
Molly squeals and hugs John tightly, then turns and hugs Sherlock as well, and Sherlock finds that he doesn’t mind one bit.
The cafe is brightly lit, a watery late autumn sun streaming in through the windows, throwing shadows of advertisements on the windows over Sherlock’s table.
Sherlock frowns at her in surprise. She smiles gently at him and continues, “And I wonder why you didn’t, when you so clearly wanted to.”
“Charming.” John smiles at Sherlock’s dry tone. “Well, no time like the present, I suppose,” he says, darting a subtle glance at the window, and John grins, because he recognises a signal when he hears one.
Sherlock is last. He puts his sticky toffee pudding on the table. He made a batch of caramel-hazelnut ice cream to go with it, and he hopes the judges will get on to the tasting before too much of it melts.
“Of course not,” John answers automatically, but immediately after the words are out of his mouth he pauses, because honestly, he hasn’t given any thought to whether he
John gazes up at him and twines his fingers in Sherlock’s hair. “That’s probably the nicest thing I’ve heard in ages.” He pulls Sherlock down for a kiss, then mutters against his lips, “You probably don’t need to be told this, given that you’re you, but you’re interesting too. You’re fascinating, in fact.”
The door opens and Molly enters, carrying two cups. From the smell, he can already tell that it’s more terrible coffee.
John shrugs. “Well, it's... I don't know, I never thought about it before. It wasn't...” he makes a vague gesture. “It wasn't horrible, or anything. It was just really surprising.”
It’s been raining since the early morning hours, and the sounds of drops striking the tent roof are oddly loud, creating a sort of white noise blanket that should be calming but isn’t.
It’s eerily quiet, and John feels a shudder run down his back. He’s not superstitious, but he’s also read more than his share of adventure novels, so he’s immediately tempted to imagine ghosts and madmen and smugglers.
“I probably won’t have a choice. He will never let me be in charge of my own life, no matter how many years I’ve been sober.”
Just out of curiosity, Sherlock, where did you see that recipe book? At John Watson’s flat maybe? From his bed?
John smiles, obviously pleased with the compliment. He gestures at the other glass. “What’s this one?”
Don’t serve them with breadcrumbs, mix poppy seeds with icing sugar, warm them up in a pan with a bit of butter, coat the Powidltascherln with it, drench in melted butter, die happy.
He rolls over to his side and enjoys the cool sheets against his skin for a moment. It’s August, and the days are endless and hot, and he enjoys these mornings for the cool, fresh air as much as for the quiet.
And John as a friend, flatmate and partner in crime(solving) isn't entirely the same as John as a partner in every sense of the word. One who has the right to demand things from Sherlock. Honesty, secrets, intimacy. All the things Sherlock isn’t sure he can give.
Lestrade looks from the picture to John, who very carefully keeps his face blank, even though his heart is beating a mile a minute. “So it’s true?”
John puts his hands up in a disclaiming gesture. “Okay, I’ll leave you to it. I’m just here to get-”
Mary looks at him compassionately, like she knows what he’s thinking, which is very likely. She was there when his dad died, and she’s seen him at his worst.
They break apart for air, and John keeps hold of Sherlock’s waist to prevent him from moving away. “What would you have done, eleven years ago, if the mistletoe hadn’t been there?”
Sherlock goes completely still. He turns, very slowly, very deliberately, and his discerning, all seeing eyes focus on John with razor-sharp intensity. John feels that thing again, the coiling tiger, the cliff-edge feeling, and swallows.
Once all the pies are out, the crew send them out of the tent for what they call the ‘money shots’ or ‘food porn shots’.
“It never occurred to me that I was risking my life,” Sherlock finally continues. “You know how indestructible it feels to be young. And we were so careful. Only bought from dealers we trusted. Never mixed substances. Always monitored dosages. We were both chemists, after all, what could go wrong? But one day it happened anyway.” Sherlock looks out at the lake again, at the waning moon and the lights it throws on the still water. “I don’t know who called the ambulance. It wasn’t Victor, he was too out of it to notice. When I woke up in the hospital, my chest hurt. They shocked me to restart my heart. It was then that I realised that I was killing myself, and that I was going to die in a dingy, run down drug den if I continued like that. Victor… he didn’t see it that way. Said I’d made a mistake, it wouldn’t happen again. We’d spot each other.” Sherlock swallows. John wordlessly squeezes his hand. “I walked away. I left him there. In that squalid hole in the wall we called a flat. It was more difficult than heroin withdrawal, to stay away from him, afterwards. When I was clean. But I did it. And I made myself a promise, then. I wouldn’t get involved again, wouldn’t let myself get involved again. Caring isn’t an advantage. Caring made Victor a drug addict, and caring made me stay one for long enough that I nearly killed myself. Caring ties you down and clouds your judgement and makes it more difficult to walk away.”
“Apple pie, obviously,” Sherlock says, and he would have liked to leave it at that, but Mrs Hudson is looking at him expectantly, so he elaborates. “I’m doing a lattice crust and a crumble topping between the lattices.”
Sherlock quietly sips his tea and hopes nobody will ever know that there is one criminal out there who has found a way to make Sherlock Holmes afraid of him.
Sherlock rolls to his side to face John and props his head on his elbow to look at John, naked and tousled and sweaty, the light from the lone bedside lamp picking out the gold in the fine hairs on his arms and legs. He looks good enough to eat like this, and even though Sherlock has already tasted his fill, he’s still hungry.
The waitress fits the place perfectly, colourless, faded, tired, sad. John orders chips and a pot of tea. Sherlock just waves her off. John tells her to bring a second cup anyway.
“Oh god, Irene, why would you say that?” Janine points her pizza slice at her accusingly. “I’m just trying to get through this week without having a nervous breakdown.”
“That we saw something you apparently missed. I told you Violet Jones didn’t commit suicide,” Sherlock bites back.
It’s only when they enter a clearing that John realises he’s been here before. It takes him a moment to recognise the Fey’a village with its tree houses that are almost invisible if you aren’t standing right in front of them. A few Fey’a are out and about, going about their chores, collecting firewood, mending clothes, cooking food, minding playing children. It’s almost peaceful, but when they enter the clearing that serves as a sort of village main square, all eyes turn to them, and most gazes are hostile. Something happened here. Something more than a bit not good.
John grimaces and looks down at his cane. “Not anymore,” he says, and the wistful regret in his voice is hard to miss.
heavily implied, if possibly only for John’s ears. He glares at Mary for a moment. “If you’ll excuse me, I want to get out of this polyester monstrosity.” With that he sweeps out and leaves the three crew members alone.
It takes a while for Billy to calm down, but when he finally does, he puts a comforting hand on John’s shoulder. “Seriously, though,” he says, and John looks up, because Billy sounds genuinely serious. “Why do you think two boys having sex is wrong?”
John’s oven clock dings and John goes to get out his cakes, one pale yellow, one just the right shade of blushing pink.
“You do know that owning a bakery means you need to get up at four every morning to ensure that the croissants are still warm for the morning crowd?”
“What is this?” John asks, stepping into the room behind Sherlock. He looks around curiously,  taking in the ancient chairs and tables, the cracked glass of the display case, the cash register, the writing in the window, the dust everywhere. “Speedy’s cafe?”
John meets his eyes, and for a long time they just look at each other, and then Sherlock can see something in John give, and his entire face softens into a fond smile. “All right,” he says. “Maybe you’ve got a point. I did promise you a lifetime, didn’t I.”
as you used to be,” he bites out between clenched teeth. “Got all the attention out of it you were going to get and then decided it wasn’t worth it?”
Sherlock Holmes has always thought that love is stupid. It addles the mind; it warps perception. It makes the banal seem profound and the unremarkable exceptional.
“The variance of tea preference is so low that the chances of ours overlapping are relatively high. Statistically speaking,” Sherlock observes dryly.
John is two metres away from him right now, covered in flour and working at his Christmas pudding with a small frown of concentration between his brows. And it might be the last time Sherlock sees him sloppily weigh his ingredients and shrug at them with a ‘good enough’ sort of air, sweaty and covered in flour, smiling inanely, humming out of tune while he works. It’s painful, how much Sherlock loves every imperfect inch of him. It’s also distracting, and Sherlock forces himself to focus back on his bake, when all he really wants to do is soak up as much of John as he can, fix him into his mind palace so he has a place to visit him when it inevitably ends.
He gets up from his chair and straightens his unruly hair a little. Sherlock snorts, clearly amused, and John shoots him a
“It’s cold,” John pants, winding his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and tugging him down for a mind-melting kiss.
“Fifteen, my last offer. There’s plenty of street kids, and I know almost all of them,” Sherlock says calmly, completely unaffected by the filthy look Billy shoots him.
John didn’t blink. He’s unabashedly half-naked around Sherlock the way he never used to be. They sleep in the same bed even when they don’t necessarily have to. But Sherlock likes having John at arm’s reach, and John has been hovering and fussing over him more than he ever did, so he thinks the feeling is mutual.
And maybe it’s none of that, maybe it’s the ticking clock in his head, counting down the last minutes he gets to spend in the same room as John Watson.
But then John turns and looks at him and there’s a faint smile on his face, wistful and sad, and something inside Sherlock goes,
They’re both breathing hard, and John looks up at Sherlock, pupils dilated wide. Sherlock’s heart is pounding like he just ran a marathon.
"It's OK, love, I've got you," John whispers fiercely against his hair, pressing gentle kisses against his forehead.
Part of what he misses is, and that’s sick enough, the danger. The rush of knowing you’ve survived. The bullets that miss you, the way the heart beats extra strong and hard after the danger has passed, like it wants to prove that it still can. And Sherlock provides plenty of that. Life with Sherlock is never boring, and that’s part of why John stays.
“All in all it’s been a far more rewarding experience than I ever thought it would be. I thought I didn’t have anything left to learn when it comes to baking, but it turns out I was wrong. It was tedious and stressful at times, but I… I loved it.”
Sherlock flinches, because he knows down to his bones that John isn’t only talking about Mary. Now they’re talking about the many ways, big and small, he has lied to John over the years. “I only ever wanted to protect you,” Sherlock says, and even as the words are out of his mouth he knows it’s another lie. He can’t even count the number of times he’s lied to John because it was easier, because he was lazy and didn’t feel like explaining, because he wanted to be dramatic.
“I know,” John says quietly. He’s been so focused on getting Sherlock some help that he hasn’t had time to figure out how he feels about any of this. It seems pretty obvious that they’re stuck here, at least for the foreseeable future. “The thing is, though, Sherlock, even if you had noticed the explosives, whoever blew the Gate up would have done it anyway, and it would be exactly as gone as it is now. You couldn’t have stopped it.”
Sherlock looks down at his shoes and wonders what that feeling is, that warmth in the pit of his stomach, the odd fluttery feeling. Nicotine on an empty stomach, that must be it.
“The room is spinning,” Sherlock states. “Why is the room spinning? It isn’t logical for a room to spin.”
The distraction is so effective that he doesn’t notice someone approaching until he feels a hand on his arm.
“We argued this point in the past, and I for one am always inclined to favour technical perfection over taste, because you can always add more sugar, but making a good Croqueamanche is on an entirely different level,” Moran adds.
Sherlock can feel Lestrade’s gaze on them. He meets Lestrade’s eyes in the rearview mirror and raises his eyebrows, daring him to comment.
Roaring applause, and the ensemble streams out of the wings to take their bows. Sherlock goes through the motions of bowing gracefully, even though he could care less about this ritual, and then the final curtain falls, and everybody's hugging everybody else.
John swallows hard, taking the dress from Sherlock. He suddenly remembers the last time he saw his sister, cheek pressed against the buttons of her uniform as she hugged him tightly. “She can’t have been here long,” he says, knowing his voice isn’t entirely steady.
“You don’t owe me an explanation.” John’s voice is gentle and kind, and Sherlock is sure that he doesn’t deserve any of this.
“What’s funny?” John asks, and his voice is loud after such a long silence, but there’s nothing accusing in his tone, or in the look on his face, he just sounds idly curious, and he looks utterly calm.
He works at Bart’s, in A&E, and he has a girlfriend he doesn’t love, and he got a dog. He’s got a ten month old baby at home, and he tells Sherlock to go fuck himself with so much venom it nearly burns Sherlock’s skin. He’s not angry and desperately happy, he’s just angry, deeply betrayed, and when he says he will never forgive Sherlock, Sherlock believes him.
John carefully checks that nobody is watching them, then gets out of the car and jogs over to the small petrol station around the corner.
“You know, we were supposed to have a grand rivalry, you and me,” Moriarty says from behind him. “A Bake Off for the ages. Instead the entire series has focused on your boring fling with that insignificant little man. I’m glad you dumped him, at least.”
There’s a pause, then he can almost hear Sherlock releasing the breath he’s been holding. “Obviously, the people who killed Violet asked her to do something she didn’t want to do. Possibly steal something from the museum. She ran, they found her and killed her.”
Sherlock shrugs. “I’ve hired a private plane that will get us to Karachi airport. After that, you’re on your own.”
“I need to wash up,” Sherlock says, gesturing at the shower. His voice sounds terrible, rough and dry.
Silence falls as they keep looking at each other. It’s not exactly uncomfortable, but it’s not exactly easy either. There’s something in Sherlock’s gaze, something weighty and ever so slightly challenging.
When they reach their village, the Fey’a who has a hold of his arm takes off his blindfold, and John just stares. It takes him a moment to even recognise what he’s looking at. The trees in this part of the forest are all ancient and huge, and many of them have been formed into living houses, cocoons of twigs and furs and leaves. His guard manhandles him up a ladder into one of these “houses”. It’s more like a cave inside, with rough bark and thick carpets.
“They always do, don’t they? Remember when you broke that window on press night, and we got raving reviews because the critics thought you cleaning up the glass was the best gag they’d ever seen,” Molly says.
A word about Viennese food, especially Viennese baking. It’s heavily influenced by Jewish, Hungarian and Bohemian food traditions, because Vienna used to be the capital city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and a giant melting pot for all the cultures of the Empire. So there’s a lot of powidl and poppy seeds and potato dough.
“It’s delicious,” Mr Chatterjee says, then takes another sip of his tea. “Is it odd, baking on telly?”
Sherlock huffs a laugh, and slowly, the intensity fades from his gaze, and he lets John go. John immediately misses the warmth of Sherlock so close, and shakes his head to snap himself out of it.
Sherlock nods and watches as Mr Chatterjee tries the strudel. He’s one of the few people whose opinion Sherlock respects. He made the best cheese toasties in London, and Sherlock used to visit Speedy’s quite a lot when he first moved to the area, when he needed both cheap food and a distraction. Mr Chatterjee looks older these days, his dark hair shot through with white, but he’s still a consummate professional, and Sherlock trusts his judgement.
John turns and looks at Sherlock with an eyebrow raised questioningly, and Sherlock has no idea what he wanted to say other than
Sherlock turns around in John’s arms and presses them close together. “Never say that to him,” he mutters as he leans down for a kiss.
“The day you’re asking stupid questions, so it could literally be any day of the week or year,” Sherlock answers immediately, he’s been down this road before, after all.
He also knows that facing down death together and escaping by the skin of their teeth made him almost psychically aware of John in a way he wasn’t before. Also, John has some qualities that Sherlock obviously lacks, patience, practicality, common sense, which make them a very good team in every way.
“It’s your head that’s spinning, not the room,” John says, obviously amused, looking at Sherlock with that small, warm, affectionate smile John seems to have invented for Sherlock.
She’s lying on her side, sleeping peacefully. The room stinks of beer, vodka and vomit. John sinks down on the floor beside her bed, strokes her hair and silently waits for her to wake up and start the whole cycle again.
Sherlock pulls John down until he’s nestled against him again. He runs his fingers under John’s t-shirt so he can trace the bumps of his spine. “But it’s Sydney. It’s so far away. And I’ll be gone eight months at least.”
A like, but not a comment. Just for a tiny moment, Sherlock allows himself to wonder what that might mean. Then he shakes himself out of it.
John smiles back, and this time he seems to be actually here, in this kitchen at 2 am. “You know. Nightmares. Psychosomatic limps. All that shit. The things psychologists charge you a lot of money for talking about it.”
His mood is further soured by the multitude of YouTube comment threads clamouring for more content with John and another, smaller number of comment threads calling him any number of homophobic slurs plus people being outraged on his behalf, and an increasing number of comment threads arguing over whether he and John are shagging or not. Moriarty has so far been astonishingly quiet, but Sherlock thinks he’s just timing his attack to be closer to the final to get maximum attention.
By nine, Mike’s not in and the carpenters need supplies, so John places a few orders and charges Dimmock with picking them up, then he gets to work in the rehearsal room. The pre-set is perfect, so he starts coffee and makes a pot of tea, then he sets out fresh glasses and re-fills the water, sets out the cake they’re eating in the first half of the play, and then he’s still got forty minutes before the actors are due to arrive.
He’s lying on the couch in the dark, fingers steepled under his chin, eyes closed to visualise the choreography better, when John comes in.
Sherlock takes a step towards Moriarty and lowers his voice, not even trying to conceal his anger. He’d like nothing more than to slam his fist into that smirking visage, but he knows there are other ways to hurt. “Try it and see what happens. Final warning. If you so much as mention his name online, I will erase you from the Internet. I will make you want to change your name and move to another country. You think you know what I can do? Believe me, you have no idea.”
Sherlock nods to himself. Mr Chatterjee is always on his case about leftovers, and he’s right. They can’t afford to bin half their ingredients. They’ve yet to break even at the end of the month, though Sherlock is confident that this month they will finally achieve it. The revenue from his sponsorships and the YouTube channel are enough to stop the gap for now, but if everything goes according to his business plan, they won’t need the help much longer.
, and ten minutes later, the homeless population of Marylebone and Belgravia are eating scones and macarons. He carefully records their criticisms and sends them on their way.
Sherlock watches out of the corner of his eyes the way John handles the yeast dough, and the competent surety with which he moves, the strength and precision of his hands, and the way he only leans on his cane very lightly, very occasionally. His workstation is a complete mess, and the way he just reaches into the flour to add it, instead of carefully measuring it, sets Sherlock’s teeth on edge, but there’s no question that John knows what he’s doing.
Everything dissolves, then, into heat and sweat and the slapping of flesh and grunts and moans traded between their lips, and when John’s hand closes around Sherlock’s erection, he comes with a loud moan that John tries to swallow from his lips. John follows closely after, then collapses half on top of Sherlock. Sherlock closes his eyes and wraps his arms around John, and they just lie there, sweat and come cooling on their skins, sticky and disgusting, and utterly perfect, for now.
it take for you to trust Harry again?” Sherlock asks, glad of the darkness, glad that they’re walking side by side so he doesn’t have to look at John.
The killer grins. “No. Jim wants you alive. But I think you need to die. Your idiocy has cost us enough. When you two idiots stumbled through the Gate, we were stuck here for a year. And on the other side, the local police went bonkers when you disappeared. Apparently your daddy really wants you back. So I'm not killing you because Jim's paying me. I'm doing this because I'll enjoy watching you die.”
His phone vibrates with a text. It’s the Bake Off group chat. Irene has posted a link to Moriarty’s blog.
“I very much think we need to have this conversation now, after my brother dug you out of a fire with his bare hands,” Mycroft says, still in the same mild tone, but John hears the steel underneath, and he knows he can’t fight this.
They’ve both decided to do Cornish pasties to try them out for the show. Sherlock is stirring the mince he pressed out of two pork sausages in a pan with two cloves of garlic and a medium-sized onion. He shrugs and gives the pan a practiced toss. “I’m renting the flat upstairs. When the cafe went out of business, my landlord had a hard time finding a new tenant, so he’s letting me rent the space for about a third of what he’d get if he could get a business in here, but it’s better than nothing, because I heat the place and look after it.”
Sherlock drops a kiss on his head. “I’ll make sure you’ll never have to find out.” He  draws back and grins. “I brought you something.”
Janine leans in and drops her voice. “What’s going on with the cane, anyway? Sometimes it seems like he needs it; sometimes he’s fine.”
“But we were all sort of fond of her by that point,” Sally jumps in, grimacing. “So we released her into the wild in Regent’s Park.”
let himself grow dependent on John. Because sooner or later, one of two things will happen: Sherlock will get bored with John or, infinitely more likely, John will leave.
“How about this,” Sherlock says, evading John’s mouth, which lands on his neck instead. John bites down on his neck and he gasps as John’s teeth graze over sensitive skin. “I was about to take a shower. How about you join me?”
Sherlock turns his head and looks at John, who’s looking back at him intently, worry lines prominent on his forehead. John swallows, and his fingers tighten on Sherlock’s arm. Some powerful emotion is wrestling for dominance over his features. Sadness, tiredness, anger, love. Or maybe Sherlock’s just projecting, because that’s how he feels right now.
John huffs a laugh from the neighbouring station, and Mrs Turner rounds on him. “John, scone or skon?”
Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner chuckle, and John calls over, “Oi! What do you mean for once? I always make excellent life decisions.”
He never understood the aversion people have to rising early. It’s so quiet, so peaceful. When most of the world is still asleep, there are no distractions, no clutter, no noisy commotions. The people you do meet are subdued, tired after a long night’s work, or not quite yet awake enough.
Billy saunters into the room with his usual swagger, but stops when he sees the corpse on the table. “Oh, no. No. I don’t want nothin’ to do with any of that,” Billy says, backing out of the room.
He thinks briefly about apologising, but from the stricken expression on Mary’s face, he knows it’s pointless. So he hands her the bottle and goes back into the kitchen to finish his tea.
It’s over almost in a blink of an eye. Sherlock draws back and looks at him, wild eyed and terrified. He smacks his lips together, and John stares at them, in wordless shock.
Finally, he finds a leg, and thankfully attached to it the rest of Sherlock. He’s unconscious, and there’s a piece of wood lodged in his shoulder. He’s bleeding.
Mr Chatterjee grabs his tea spoon and taps it on the crust, and the souffle wobbles. “Nice,” he says with a smile. Then he takes a bite, and his smile widens. “Very good. A nice touch, the crunch from the caramelised sugar.” He takes another bite and tilts his head to the side. “Maybe you need a bit of acidity? Maybe some lemon zest?”
Sherlock smiles for the reaction shot and gives Jim an exaggeratedly friendly nod, and Jim smiles back, just as fake.
Sherlock isn’t being noble. Far from it. Sherlock is being purely, 100% self-servingly selfish by keeping the Watsons at Baker Street. He loves them being here, and if it were up to him, they would never leave.
“No, and the point is that I like it that way, so last night was good, and I don’t regret it, and it won’t happen again. All right?”
Later, when the director has dismissed them to a late lunch, and everybody’s dispersed, Sherlock goes back to John’s workstation and tastes his cake.
Exhausted, John sits down on his bed, then lies down, fully clothed. He falls asleep still clutching his father’s watch in his hand.
John smiles and turns around to bury his face in the folds of Sherlock’s coat. “What would I do without you,” he mutters against Sherlock’s throat.
John is pretty sure Ya’ra is the Feyara word for mother, and he’s somewhat surprised that the Fey’a ruler would allow them to address her so informally.
John rubs a hand over his face in frustration. “I’m responsible. These people are my crew, they look to me. I’m stage manager. I’ve been doing his job for months now.”
Sherlock is last, and when the judges cut his cake in half, Sherlock can hear John’s sharply drawn breath at the small rainbow-coloured hearts decorating the inside of Sherlock’s hidden design cake.
Mrs Hudson sits down at the table and starts eating as well. “It’s amazing how quickly you learned Feyara, Sherlock,” she says, gesturing at the newspaper.
“One rule only: Filo pastry must be used. The bakes can be sweet, savoury, pasties, pies, strudels, whatever. As always, they have four hours to complete their bakes.”
On Wednesday, just after he gave away the loaves of bread and the souffles to his homeless network and got some first reactions from them, his phone rings.
There are twelve stairs to their door. It’s a ridiculous number, twelve. Twelve. The sound alone. Twelve. Twelve. Twelve. He tries saying the word a few times. It still sounds ridiculous.
Sherlock finally finds John at his sister’s flat, in a drunken stupor, so far gone it’s clear he has no idea who Sherlock even is.
Then Mary calls from the auditorium, and the moment breaks like glass. “I need to go,” John says, gesturing at the stage. “Lights.”
“I’m not going to give the entire room tips on how to beat me,” he answers with what he hopes is a charming smile.
John gives him a small, grateful smile, as if thanking him for not being an arsehole about this, and Sherlock feels a powerful urge to break every bone in the bodies of all the people who have ever been arseholes to John, ever. “Don’t do that,” he snaps.
The next contestants have various problems. Janine’s carrot cake is too moist, Mary’s banoffee pie is delicious, but too simple. A chap named Mike’s Sachertorte is too dry. A bloke John referred to as Dimmock earlier has made a slightly underbaked cheesecake. A young college student named Neela, apparently, made a simple chocolate sponge cake that’s competently made but rather easy.
John grins and hands him the cheese. He eats a few bites of his sandwich, then he nudges Sherlock with his elbow. “Look at Moriarty.”
John smiles, and wonders silently if this is the worst idea he’s ever had, but maybe this is his chance to figure out whether Sherlock is still interested, and once he knows, he can figure out what to do about it. Only he already knows what to do about it. And it’s definitely unprofessional.
He jumps and turns around, sees John Watson leaning heavily on his cane, looking tired but content. The last penny drops. “Royal Army Medical Corps, is it?”
Sherlock doesn’t know what the rush is, but John’s not letting him up for air and he likes it, this demanding, unleashed version of John.
