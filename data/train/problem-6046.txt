Tony feels hurt for a second, but Steve is tapping a thumb on his cheekbone, “Not like that,” he says quietly, “I love your scent Tony, I love having it on me. It’s helping a lot with the heat. That’s probably why I couldn’t help myself. But-“
He smiled when he felt lips on his skin. It would take time for him and the Captain to understand each other completely, if they ever managed it.
They met a few more times after that, some coincidental and some less so. Stevens liked spending time with the doctor, the man had an incredible wit, and they enjoyed goading each other into a bet or a challenge.
Anthony rolled his eyes, "Steve knows you're an omega into other omegas and he's an omega into omegas too."
"It's just a pacemaker, keeps my heart ticking. Nothing to worry about." Potts told him, smiling weakly.
“I just do.” Steve replied, quietly. He always did have a good set of observation skills. Steve had scrutinized all of his teammates, to an extent. Tony Stark probably the most. He felt comfortable when he could place someone. Fit them into the map of his mind. Most people fell somewhere on Steve’s spectrum of judgement.
Tony took in Anthony's pout and dropped a kiss on his forehead, "But hey, you liked him enough to swipe right, and if that doesn't give him a very good chance at being Mr. Right, well, I don't know what does."
“Steve,” Tony aggrieves, sounding highly put upon, “If I have to spend another second out there smelling like I’m single and ready to mingle, I am actually going to go crazy and do something like give Clint those arrows he wants that shoot out raspberry yoghurt.”
"That's not true. I'm sure I'll be able to think of enough old man jokes to keep myself entertained. He is twenty minutes older than me, you know." Tony grinned.
Tony endeavored nevertheless, and despite his doubtful countenance, Steve paid rapt attention to Tony’s explanations. Two hours went by, they remained in the nest, and Tony started to feel drowsy, himself.
Tony squinted at her, "You weren't even here for ninety percent of this. Pray tell, when did you tell me anything?"
Potts was going to die. He was going to die and Pym would probably not even notice. He sighed and tried not to fidget. He was starting to feel the chill, and it would be long before he was delirious with it.
Tony’s eyes were hooded, now, and he kept inhaling in deep breaths filled with Steve’s pheromones. Steve considered him, and arousal twisted low in his belly at the sight, “Get your pants off and fuck me, Alpha.”
“Oh Spangles. I didn’t mean that. You can cuddle me as much as you want to.” Tony folded like a wet noodle under those eyes. He could feel his own throat close up in response to Steve’s frustration. “I’m sorry, Steve. I know this is hard on you, and I promise we’ll figure out a solution soon. No matter what it takes. I just- I don’t want you to do something that might make you hate me later on.”
Tony heads out the door. Steve goes to the sink, turns the tap to cold, and splashes a palmful of the water on his face.
“Hey! Is that all you have to say! It was a pretty good presentation, y’know. I don’t think I’ve ever paid board meetings this much attention.” Tony grumbled.
, Steve tossed his head back into the pillows and threw an arm over his face. This was an Alpha between his legs, and Tony was teaching him, showing him how good it could be.
The light in the washroom falls harsh on Steve’s eyes, but he doesn’t dare blink. Tony angles his head back a little, resting them comfortably on Steve’s fingers, giving him better access. Steve licks his dry lips, and then presses his glands to Tony’s once more. Tony’s skin is warm, and Steve can feel the flutter of a heart beat under his thumb. He brushes a caress over it and Tony sighs imperceptibly.
Steve slipped another finger in, and Tony entered the room with a tray piled with food and water. He had discarded his jacket somewhere, and stood in front of Steve in a white shirt with rolled up sleeves and a pair of black pinstripe slacks. The definition on his forearms was prominent, and Steve tucked a hand under his own thigh and lifted his leg to the side. “Tony,” He panted out. Tony froze. His eyes ran hotly along Steve’s exposed flesh, his rigid erection, and the flush the ran down his chest. He clutched the tray in his hands tighter, and shook his head, “Water first, Steve. You’ve been producing a lot of that fluid.” He tossed a bottle from the tray towards the bed.
Steve reached out for Tony again, as slow as the first time. He buried his fingers into Tony’s fur and tugged on it. Tony’s eyes met his, if Steve had to guess, he’d say Tony looked confused and a little lost. So Steve brought his mouth to one floppy ear, and ordered, “Let go, Stark.” Tony whined at him again, but Steve pushed forward, “It’s okay, I’m the only one here. I’ll take care of you. Just, let go, Tony.”
When Captain Stevens first met Doctor Potts, he thought the man was interesting. It wasn't often someone helped another at the consequence of themselves. That was then, however. Now that he had gotten to know the doctor, Stevens found himself a little enamoured. It wasn't always the best idea to crush on a work colleague, but Stevens couldn't find it in himself to regret it.
"My heat is in two weeks." Steve stated apropos and Tony almost veered off the road. "I mean," he mumbled, "if you're not doing anything at that time, we could maybe, spend it together."
He flew out of the tower with a heavy heart, and a worse feeling in his gut. This was not going to go down well- things rarely did when Tony separated himself from Steve.
Steve hums. He picks up a magazine from the side table. There is a picture of the mayor and his wife on the front. They stand close to each other, their bodies naturally drawn to their mate. Steve fingers the picture. He finds himself drifting back to the gala they had attended a month ago, when Steve had scented Tony for the first time.
Steve laughed. And then realized it had been a while since he had last done that. “I thought, maybe if I came here. I could figure out what I want from life.”
Tony took Steve’s face in his hands, “I’ll take care of you, Steve. We’re partners after all, you and I. Gotta stick with each other.”
Tony laughed and Steve promptly scowled at him. Tony waved his hands before Steve could get the wrong impression, "I don't mean it that way Darling. It's just that it's my first time on a date with another omega too. You'll have to excuse me as well."
“Dada!” He protested, “Brea’fas’” He ran over to Tony’s side of the bed and began tugging on Tony’s night robe. Tony chuckled, and then snuck another kiss on Steve’s amused mouth. “Relax sweetheart. We’ve got everything planned out today, so you can leave it to us.”
“I’m sorry.” Stevens mumbles to his shoes. Potts his silent for a moment too long, so he looks up warily.
"He did. But he explained that you have extensive field experience and have been trained." Stevens sounded curious, his head cocking to the side.
suit. Steve was so startled he looked up at the sky. “Are you okay?” He asked the man. He could always count on his need to help people to subdue his social anxieties.
Steve closed his eyes and leaned back. “Yeah. I was on out on the field for a few years. I made some friends. They were like family. The only family I knew really, since we had all been born into the war. And then it ended and we had to go back home. Except I had no home.”
Steve looked down at Tony, he pressed a heel into Tony’s shoulder. Tony glanced up at him. “Lick.” Steve ordered, and Tony’s eyes widened. Tony hooked his fingers into the crack of Steve’s ass and spread his cheeks. “You’re such a mess.” He whispered out, voice lowered in arousal. He buried his face into Steve’s ass, and gave his rim a dedicated lick before thrusting his tongue inside. Steve clenched around the intrusion as Tony stroked his inner walls. He could feel his orgasm building up again, and he struggled to hold it back.
“You’re Captain America.” He felt like a broken record, but the novelty hadn’t worn off. “My dad was a big fan.”
Tony continues licking into Steve’s ass, squeezing his buns and moaning into Steve’s wet hole. Steve tastes sweet, his slick warm as Tony drinks it all up. He almost protests when Steve gets off him, but then Steve turns around and puts a palm behind Tony’s neck. He is gentle when he pulls Tony up to stand, dragging his face along Steve’s abs, and rubbing Tony’s mouth along one protruding nipple. “Go on, Tony” he encourages, and Tony lifts his hand to take Steve’s tit in hand, pressing his palm into the nipple, and then squeezing down, watching as milk leaked out from either side of his palm. Steve’s tit is so messy, and Tony has never felt this geared up in his entire life. He pinches the nipple between his fingers and then watches in fascination as more milk squirts out. Steve squirms under his touch, eyes glazing out with pleasure.
Stevens was in standard military garb, and he clutched his cap in front of him like a shield. His eyes darted to Pym once, and then rooted firmly on Potts. He cleared his throat, the sound awkward and scratchy. "I knocked." He offered in explanation, and Potts and Pym both blinked at him in tandem.
“Please, please, please,” Steve babbled. Tony draped himself against Steve’s back, kissing the nape of his neck to comfort him.
Leave me a comment to let me know if you’d like another chapter ^^. I have to say, writing Stony+abo might be one of my favorite things ever.
“Alright, Darling,” He acquiesces, pressing one last peck to Steve’s mouth before getting on his haunches and standing up. Now that he doesn’t have Steve to distract him, his muscles ache from the workout, and he raises his arms above his head to stretch his back.
"No problem at all, Stevens." Potts replied. "Now if that's all, I really should get back to making sure Pym doesn't blow up the lab."
Out of his fancy suit, Stark fit better into their surroundings than Steve would have initially assumed. He favored casual shirts and sweatpants that were often grease stained. “Oh, I’m perfectly fine, Steve.” Stark said, sticking his head out from around a branch. “And I thought I told you to call me Tony. I don’t know who this Mr. Stark is!”
A strangled gasp escapes Tony’s throat. Steve’s head snaps up to look at him, shocked by the sound. His hands are still on his chest, playing with his tits like he can’t stop even though he looks startled by Tony’s presence.
There were fifty two slides on the Omega heat cycle. Steve skimmed over pre-heat symptoms; excessive production of slick, increase in body temperature, hot flashes, nesting, in bonded pairs the Alpha would become protective, prioritizing the Omega’s safety and comfort. In unbonded pairs, the Omega’s pheromones would aide in triggering the Alpha’s rut, pushing them to mate and bond with the unclaimed Omega.
Sana, the wonderful angel, had left them their menus on the table. So Tony picked up the one across him and flipped it open. "I say we get a little of everything, Darling. Sana's father is a magician in the kitchen."
“Yes, as a matter of fact. A lot like wolf packs. We’re unsure of what exactly the dynamics entail, and our research into the matter is minimal. But Stark and Rogers, both your biologies seem to have been affected in a similar manner. Rather than me try to try to explain the birds and bees to you, we have all the reading material you’ll need assembled. Since none apart than the two of you seem to have been affected by the same, we’ve deemed it safe for you to go about your daily tasks the same as always. You will, however, be exempted from missions until we figure out how to get you back to normal.”
Steve peeked one eye open, and Tony flicked his nose, “I’m onto you. We are not sleeping again. We just slept for four hours!”
His words hit the kid with a rawness even Tony felt. The kid recoiled away from him and then seemed to instinctively come closer, like Tony had hurt him but Tony was also his protector.
One such time Pym found him loitering in the corridor just outside the elevator. He gave Stevens an odd look before passing by him and stepping inside. "Will you be getting on, Captain?" He asked. Stevens flushed and then shook his head, "That's, that's quite alright, I just realised I have somewh-" he caught sight of Potts heading their way, "-fourth floor, please," he said, as he got on, avoiding eye contact with Pym.
"Thank you." Steve replied. He accepted the flowers a little awkwardly and rubbed the soft petals between his fingers as he spoke. "I might be a bit of a mess today." He admitted. "I wasn't sure what the protocol was going to be." He squared his shoulders and then looked Tony in the eye. "It's my first time on a date with another omega."
Peter opened his mouth and then closed it. “I’ve never thought about whether this world was real or not. I mean, it probably is.” He paused, “but we could run some tests, I suppose.”
“Well,” Steve hedges, looking a little embarrassed, and he shifts his body in a way Tony is learning to recognize. It draws Tony’s eyes to Steve’s hips, where he’s sporting a semi, ill concealed by the pair of blue shorts he had decided to wear for their short bout.
Pym turned to him in question, and when he realised Potts was not going to be forthcoming, he asked, "What brings you down here, Mr...?"
Tony snarled, riling Steve up with his Alpha tone. Steve could feel Tony’s hands grabbing and squeezing at his ass. Soon Tony’s hands were replaced with his cock. He drove it between Steve’s cheeks, ignoring the Omega as he bucked and moaned beneath him at the sensation of being fucked without penetration. He continued to jerk his cock up, brushing against Steve’s asshole, and then lower between lips of his pussy. “You’re stunning, Steve.” Tony praised him, pressing a finger into Steve’s folds.
Steve allowed himself to bask in the sensation. Pliant, as Tony maneuvered him fully onto the bed while he continued to kiss Steve, a hard suck on his tongue made Steve groan as more slick released from his lower region. It was a part of himself he had never thought about, the slit that started just behind his balls. But it throbbed now, and he clenched his thighs together chasing that sensation.
He wanted to run away, but he had nowhere to run to. He felt cornered, and he knew that he couldn’t continue avoiding the situation at hand. He had a foolproof way to check, he just needed to do it.
Potts brings a puppy to work one day. Stevens sneaks down to the labs to visit him and he finds Pym and Potts trying to teach the little pup tricks.
Steve paused at a slide that explained how Omegas were capable of producing a viscous fluid when they were aroused to slicken them up and prepare for an Alpha’s knot. He went to read up on what that was next. His blood pounded in his ears as he read about knotting, scenting and bonded pairs.
“No, Steve. We’re not going to go back to bed. Or well, back to nest. There are bases to cover. In case the presentation didn’t make my point, I was planning on moving forward towards experimental investigation-“
Steve unbuttons the cuffs of his sleeves and rolls them up, “Let it be known that this was not my idea.”
Tony grins at him, and shakes his head, “You hate it when I have to schmooze, and I don’t want to put you through that. I can handle Ty well enough.”
But he and Tony were just fuck buddies, Tony was probably flirting with the attendants right now, Steve thought. Yet, the images that once would have flooded his mind to accompany his brooding, did not. Sure, he could picture Tony giving them an easy going eyes, but somehow, the soft tenderness felt like something private to them. Steve was probably seeing things that did not exist, but it loosened the knot in his chest. He punched the pillow. It burst apart around his knuckles, cotton littering the floor.
Tony hummed for a moment and then said, "Why don't we try to get her accustomed to your presence in a more positive manner?" He offered.
Tony whined, then he wrapped his leg around Steve’s waist and flipped them over. Steve landed against the bed, but Tony wasn’t done as he continued to maneuver Steve until he was presenting himself with his face buried into the pillows and his ass thrust out for Tony to do whatever he wanted with it. “
“I wanted to understand myself better.” Steve tried to explain. “I didn’t get to do that during the war, and afterwards I felt like I was recovering from loss. My friends had all moved on, but it was hard for me to do the same.”
Oh for the love of Thor. Tony turned around to look at Steve, who was still snuggled into the pile of blankets.
Two hours later, Tony’s alarm beeped and he startled awake. He was too warm under Steve's bulking mass, but he managed to find himself some wriggle room so he could grab his phone.
Now that Tony was pack, and Tony lived in the woods with him. Steve found himself often patrolling their premises. Tony set up a little picnic blanket for himself outside and one of his little helper bots from his workshop, DUM-E,  handed him plates of fruit while he tanned himself in the sun.
“Yes, yes, I will bear witness to your innocence, Captain.” Tony agrees, genially. He reaches up to part his collar, and Steve halts in his actions.
“Here’s what you’re going to do,” Steve states, fingers twisting into Tony’s hair, “You’re going to eat me out, and then as a reward I’ll let you suck on my tits. Nod if you’re okay with that.”
A pair of blue eyes that matched Tony’s to the t pouted up at Steve. In the right light Steve liked to think they looked a bit like his too. “No.” Anthony denied resolutely, despite the proof of his crime staining Steve’s shirt. He looked down and rubbed his palm over the spot. “Not mine. Dada’s.”
"I wanted to thank you for treating me." He informed, sweeping a hand through his hair. "I was told that the possibility of infection would have been greater had I waited longer."
His apartment looked the same, but it was also very very different. There were traces of another life everywhere. Unfamiliar clothes strewn on the floor, an extra tooth brush in his washroom and a corner near the window with a chair and an easel set up. This was Tony’s home, but it was also not.
Tony was sitting rigidly beside him. Ever since he had agreed to do this with Steve, he hadn’t glanced Steve’s way. He led them out of the Triskelion with his press smile plastered to his face, and then sat in the car with a false air of nonchalance. He only grew tenser the more time he spent in the car with Steve. It made Steve uncomfortable, seeing him like this.
“I’ll treat you right, darling.” Tony murmured to him, “I’ll be the best you’ll ever have.” He continued fucking into Steve, alternating between long thrusts where he pulled out almost completely before pushing back into the slick mess between Steve’s legs and short ones where he ground against that one spot inside Steve that made him want to scream. The squelching sounds mortified Steve, he was so fucking wet that Tony was fucking into him with least resistance.
Peter was a warm weight in his arms. Tony didn’t have experience in comforting other people, but for the kid, he would try. It wasn’t his fault his dad went ahead and got amnesia.
Ignoring the blush in his cheeks, Steve turned to look at Tony, “Don’t you have meetings to attend?” He asked.
"I have your uncle Greg? He'll be old and grumpy too and we're exactly the same age." Tony tried to defend himself.
He was startled awake sometime later by Anthony barreling into the room and flinging himself on top of Steve. He sat his full weight on Steve’s stomach, and then cocked his head to the side innocently, “Papa, awake?”
"Cats don't really like people who pay them too much attention. They like to control their environments, they want to have the opportunity to choose to interact with you." Tony explained, he was watching Goose as he spoke, and the cat gave Tony a slow blink in response. "You have to give her some space. If she chooses to love you, at her own time, I can promise that she'll be begging you for chin scritches soon enough."
They were sitting on the couch with Steve’s feet thrown into Tony’s lap. It had become a weekly ritual for them. Steve wasn’t really sure how they got there, but Tony dug a thumb into his heel and he was not inclined to complain. “I mean it’s incomparable, I suppose. But losing control over your faculties during the full moon isn’t as romantic as the media enjoys portraying. I get the appeal, I guess. But for me, it’s always been a little traumatic. I have to trust my base instincts and let them guide me. Losing control like that, it terrifies me.”
Steve eyed his menu with interest. "I'm getting the next one?" He asked to confirm, and Tony felt another burst of fond affection building up for the omega seated across him.
When Carol joined them, watching her interact with Goose was like watching two old friends reunite. Goose complained loudly, twirling around Carol's legs, happy to see her human again, but grumpy about their time apart. Carol laughed when the cat jumped into her arms and climbed on top of her shoulders. It was endearing to watch Goose be excited about Carol's return.
“I won’t lie to you, kid. And if you’re mine then you’re probably used to that.” Tony whispered. “I-I don’t know if I’d be able to figure this out either. I don’t know if I’ll ever get my memories back. I’m still kind of adjusting to the fact that all this might be real.”
They’re training in one of the many Gyms at the Triskelion. Tony ducks as Steve’s fist sails past his cheek and his right arm comes down quick enough to block the upward kick Steve sends his open side using the small opening made by his punch. Steve has insisted Tony ‘show him what he’s got’, and with the smitten delight that came with a new relationship, Tony readily agreed. He pivots his right leg up, and Steve blocks Tony’s kick with his forearm.
“You’re not s’possed to be up yet.” Tony complained from where he was buried into Steve’s side. He had a lazy arm flung around Steve’s waist, tucked under Anthony’s legs.
The constant influx of praise is heady, and Stevens might be a little drunk on it. That’s why he fails to intercept Agent Wilson when he comes across the three of them in the cafeteria while Potts is waxing poetic about Cap’s pretty blue eyes.
Steve wanted to ask. Instead, he tossed the tablet on the table. “I need you to fuck me through it.” His hands twitched, and he laced his fingers together. “You’re an Alpha, aren’t you?”
The easy praise causes Tony to almost stumble on his feet, and he can’t hide his fluster as Steve’s words curl warmly in his chest, “Wha-What’s the gobsmacked expression for then, gorgeous?” He asks.
Tony blinks at him, “Of course,” he says. “I have to smell  taken Steve, the wrist glands aren’t enough to deter Ty. It’ll be okay, just a little.”
Steve gives his bare abdominals, revealed by his raised top, an appreciative glance. “You go on ahead,” he tells Tony, “I’ll clean up after you.” Although it’s not intended, his words remind Tony that Steve’s going to be spending his coming heat alone. He has requested it, and Tony, not wanting to do anything that would mess up what they have now, readily agreed. Which also means that he won’t be able to have sex with Steve for another three weeks. But Tony doesn’t care as much about that as might be expected of him. He is just worried about Steve, hopes he will be fine on his own for the duration.
A wet laugh that was almost a sob escaped Steve's lips. "Do you think she likes me now?" He couldn't help asking.
Steve raised a brow, "you think ruffling your hair is enough to convince someone we were having sex?"
Steve was almost desperate to ask, but they didn’t do that. They didn’t talk about Tony’s cancer. Well, sometimes they did. When the lights were off and Tony was plaint in his arms, nudging his head into the crook of Steve’s arms. Steve pressed his lips together, tight, and contented himself with Tony’s response. He found himself wanting to press closer to Tony, however, to monopolize the man’s attention. Steve’s skin itched, and he curled his toes in his boots to try and abate the fresh sweep of arousal making its way up his spine.
"Perfect." Tony said, and with his confidence restored, he hooked his ankle with Steve's again and this time added a little caress. "You're gorgeous and you deserve to be spoiled, Steve."
Steve’s preheat ended in the limo, harbinging a full blown heat. Despite reading all the information Fury had given them, nothing could have prepared Steve for the pleasure that tore through his abdomen. It wrapped itself around his gut and squeezed down painfully. Steve wasn’t sure if he was aroused, or wanted to puke. Maybe both. Cold sweat dripped down his forehead. He swiped his wrist across it and winced.
These are thoughts Steve is having now, and they are thoughts he shouldn't be having. Tony is his best friend. Steve doesn't want to ruin that.
“Wait.” Steve stops him with a word, and Tony hovers at the door. Steve sighs. “You were going to find out sooner or later, I guess. I did hope later, I wanted to- explain or something first. But well, it’s weird right. It’s a pre-heat symptom, a pretty rare one I’m told. One of the things my body thinks it needs to do to prepare for a baby, or something like that. Weird, right?”
In the present, he hears Tony open the bathroom door and it pulls Steve out of his musing. He turns around, and immediately chokes up.
He was often a sore loser, but Stevens didn't find himself minding it much, not when Potts snuck glances at him, looking mighty pleased with himself.
, if Pepper was to be believed, frowned at him. Tony was delirious. Possibly fictional Captain America was disappointed with him? Maybe there was something to this illusion after all. He did wear his insecurities for everyone to see. He was surprised no one had attempted this before.
“You’re doing great, Steve! I feel very protected.” Tony waved towards him as Steve circled the perimeter of Tony’s home.
Steve found himself thinking. Tony waited for Steve to adjust, then he drew his cock out slowly and snapped his hips back. Steve kneened, “I didn’t know.” He gasped out. “I swear I didn’t know it felt like this. Oh God.”
“Thor is on it.” Steve replied, and when Tony shot him a blank look, “the wizard’s brother” he cleared.
Tony didn't reply, he just walked across the room towards Goose and and stretched his palm out towards the cat. Goose seemed delighted by the attention and rubbed her head enthusiastically into Tony's palm. Tony laughed, a soft, airy thing Steve had thought he'd never get to hear again. Then, Tony picked Goose up from under her belly, making sure to comfortably support the cat's butt and walked them over to the couch. Goose was pliant in Tony's hands, melting under the comforting touch as Tony settled them down. He remained like that for a while, petting Goose behind her ears and making the cat pur so loud she was practically vibrating in Tony's arms.
“Darling,” Tony said, “you have no idea how much I want this. I don’t care about your secondary sex, I’ve always wanted you.” He cupped Steve’s face, he was so pale apart from his heated flush, a stark contrast on his skin. “Even right now,” he took in a shuddering breath, “I could devour you if you let me.” When he opened his eyes again, their intensity made Steve’s heart stutter. “But this is not your duty.”
Tony didn't feel too reassured, but when it came to Steve he didn't think anything would assuage his fears. But he gave Carol a look of appreciation and then went to don his armour. It wasn't easy doing this in the lab while trying not to disturb Steve's slumber. Usually, even the slightest noise would be enough to wake Steve, but Steve's current state allowed Tony to make it to the door without hindrance.
“I retired years ago.” Steve grumbled. He hated being made a fuss about. The supernatural war ended ten years ago. Steve had only done what was right, and now he was tired of hearing about it. Tired of seeing his face plastered across every billboard. He paused. “I feel like I’ve heard your name before too.”
Steve wanted to do something too, so he shoved Tony back on the bed and then crawled between his legs. He was too self conscious to make eye contact. He gruffly admitted, “I’ve never done this before so I might suck at it.” And then went down on Tony’s dick trying to take the whole thing into his mouth at once. He choked on it. Tony grabbed the back of his head and pulled him off. “Not like that, darling. You’ll only hurt yourself. Go slow.” He explained to Steve, petting the nape of his neck. Steve nodded, and then took Tony’s cock into his mouth again. This time he tried to get adjusted first, swirling his tongue around the head and then dipping it into the slit at the tip. “Yeah,” Tony said breathily, “you’re doing so good.”
“Not at all,” Steve drawled. Tony smelled distractingly good today. He noted. Tony always smelled good, but there was something about his scent now, it was thicker, heavier. Steve found himself leaning forward, into Tony’s space.
Potts shied away from the Captain's discerning blue eyes. The man was exceedingly handsome. "It was nothing, I was just doing my job." He tried to deflect.
Steve hoisted his head into his hand, and looked down at Tony. Tony peered up at him through weary eyes. Steve sighed, and then just tugged Tony impossibly closer.
That’s when Tony went from mildly assuming something was amiss, to really thinking something was wrong. He ran diagnostics on the suit and then had to fly to the top of the building and sit down so he could have a panic attack without falling out of the sky as a result.
“You like that, Steve?” Tony breathed out, as he fucked Steve with his knot, thrusting it in and out of his puffy rim.
Steve smiles back, and that warm, unknown feeling from earlier returns. Tony fixes his clothes and then moves Steve away from the door with a guiding palm on his hip. The touch burns.
Tony smiled, and then shyly held out his own little bouquet of roses that he had gotten for Steve. "You look beautiful, darling." He complimented and was pleasantly surprised when that incited a blush on Steve's cheeks.
Tony didn’t hesitate. He nudged one of Steve’s arms away, and then slipped a warm hand under his shirt. The touch wasn’t much, but it quelled the spasming of his belly. He sat back and rolled his head towards Tony, “Thanks.” He mumbled, a little awkward. Tony shook his head, “It’s the least I could do.”
"Excuse me. I'll have you know that these are Calvin Klein boxers." Tony protested. He flipped his nightgown to add to his point.
Rhodey snorted. “Hard to forget. It was ‘All I want for Christmas is Captain America in a sparkly thong.’ You’ve been very consistent, when I think about it.”
“Tony,” Steve turned around, putting his free hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I was just asking because I don’t want to make
“-boy, philanthropist. We know, we’ve heard it a couple of times now.” Steve’s handsome face looked at him with unconcealed affection. “The guy who would cut the wire.”
Steve looked at Tony. The demon often reminded him of his old friend. In the way they spoke, the way they let Steve be who he was.
Tony will be working undercover as bait. Their Operation shouldn't last longer than a week, and Steve has full authority to extract Tony at the first hint of trouble. Tony is capable of taking care of himself, and Steve trusts him. But Tony lies soft and relaxed beside him now, and Steve worries anyway.
Tony gets to the lobby before realizing he has left his phone in the showers. Cursing his own carelessness, he makes his way back down. Sure, Tony can afford a new phone, but he doesn’t like misplacing his tech if he can help it. It always leads to more trouble than it is worth when he does. The Gym floor is quiet when he gets there, and Tony realizes that he and Steve had stayed out here quite a while to get their training done. He pushes the doors to the communals open, and heads to the locker he had left his stuff in earlier. He sighs when he can’t find the misplaced phone, and then remembers leaving it on the ledge near one of the shower heads after he shot Fury a quick text about hiring on call massage therapists to their training facility.
They were silent for a while. The medication was wearing off and he could feel a throbbing pain in his thigh.
. Not his money or his tech. As a result, they didn’t get to scent each other often as other couples were want to. Tony’s alpha always protested, instinctually wanting to cover Steve up in his scent, and to have the same done to him.
"So what you're saying is that you get to worry because you know when we're going to fail?" Steve asks, sceptically.
Tony’s eyes lit up with mischievous delight, it softened the tight corners of his eyes, “Are you worrying about me right now, Darling?” He murmured back, sounding pleased.
It was their compatibility. That’s what made this a little different. He rubbed a palm over his face. Tony didn’t know he was here. It had been three days since Tony’s rut had begun. Steve unclenched his fist and looked at the tiny bottle of pills in his hands. He didn’t have to inject himself with suppressants anymore, instead they came in the form of little white pills now.
Steve has heard the stories of Tiberius Stone. He is not fond of these stories. Maybe that’s why the next words tumble out of his mouth.
One- this family was almost embarrassingly domestic. Two- the Tony Stark on the screen was an entirely different person. He had to be. There was no way Tony could be the one laughing so happily. There's no way it’s him who’s patiently guiding Peter as he built his first AI. And it’s absolutely not him, who spends most of his time plastered against Steve’s side as they look at each other with more love than Tony has known his entire life.
Sana led them to their table. It was in a secluded spot with warm lighting and a single rose decorating the table.
Tony smells like metal, ocean salt, and crushed mint leaves. There are multiple layers of other scents that intermingle with his own, but Steve has spent enough time with Tony to be able to discern his original scent.
The attendant who had been assigned to take him to Tony stopped in front of a large metal door. It had a scanner on the side, and the man used his ID to unlock the door. Inside, was a room that just had another such door.
Tony moans into the kiss and grinds his knee into Steve’s erection. Steve parts from Tony, his mouth wet and swollen, and then he angles his neck to the side, just so. Tony’s eyes widen as a rush of possessiveness fills him from the simple gesture. They have been keeping their relationship quiet, both feeling a little vulnerable by all the new experiences they were having together. It was a first for Tony, being able to both love and trust his partner, and to know that Steve was here with him for
Natasha sent him a letter. Half of it was complaining about how he really needed to find a better place to live. Somewhere he could at least operate a cellphone from. The other half was just updates about how she was doing. She talked about Iron man too, about how it seemed like he had vanished off of the face of the planet because of how hard it was to get any news about him.
Tony froze against him before he replied. “Yeah. That one is kind of true. But I respect people’s privacy! I promise!”
Steve huffed. “You trying to take care of me, Stark?” He teased, conceding to opening the bottle and downing it in a couple of swallows.
Steve came to pick him up at the tower sharply at 7 pm for dinner. He was in a navy suit that looked well worn and carried a bouquet of daisies with him. Tony met him down in the lobby.
“So will you do it?” Steve stared at Tony. He wanted nothing more than to reach out and rip Tony’s clothes off his body, but he needed to hear him say it first.
“You suck.” Tony informed him, despondently. “And that whole rumbly-purring thing has got to be the most unfair thing in the whole world.”
"He's the best part of my life. A mischievous part, but he means the world to me." He told Steve, earnestly.
And he felt like it might be, so he leaned forward and pressed his lips against the warm skin he'd just touched.
Steve’s head was spinning. They were handed tablets, and told to head to the labs if they needed further explanation. Everyone filed out of the room except him and Tony. Tony’s eyes were glued to the tablet in his hands as he devoured the information provided. He reclined back in his chair, tablet in hand. Steve decided to do the same.
Tony flew over to Central Park, and then he understood why Jan had asked him to come despite knowing his and Steve's predicament. Hundreds of robotic prototypes were terrorising the park. Wasp and Thor were at the scene trying to neutralise the threat.
The first brush of a tongue against Steve’s folds startled him. Steve jerked, but Tony held him in place with a strength that seemed to bear down on Steve. Steve knew he was strong enough to throw Tony off of himself if he wanted to, and yet he felt completely pinned down as Tony licked into him with firm strokes. His tongue was hot and rough as it stroked into Steve. Steve couldn’t hold back his moans as they were torn from his throat, and Tony hummed with approval over each sound. Steve was so fucking close, his pussy clenched around Tony’s tongue and he grinded against Tony’s nose chasing his own release. When Tony pulled away, his face was covered in slick and he smirked, “I wish you could see how amazing you look right now.” Steve frowned and kicked Tony in embarrassment but Tony caught his leg and tenderly kissed Steve’s inner ankle. “Don’t fret, my love. I will let you come now.”
“What do you mean SHIELD has a postnatal ward?” Stevens asks, shooting Director Carter the most dumbfounded look he could manage.
"Did Anthony tell you that?" Steve asked him, for the first time smiling a full faced grin at Tony. He really was a beautiful man.
Steve could feel Tony smile against his back as he cuddled him closer. “I could never hate the idea.” He rested his forehead against Steve’s shoulder. “I would love that, Steve.”
"Better." He says, and then angles his head towards the mirror. Tony just looks up at him, dazed and obviously flustered.
“What does it feel like?” Steve asked Tony. They were both reclining on some chairs Steve had managed to grab from a yard sale. He refurbished them, and while they didn’t look brand new, he felt like it was a good deal.
They were a lot harder to ignore when the heavy scent of a compatible Alpha in rut was clogging up his nose. It wasn’t even that Steve hadn’t been around a rutting alpha before. Hell, plenty of Alphas had used unsatisfied ruts as a way to fuel their aggression during the war. The suppressants had dulled his own drive, therefore apart from a mildly discomforting amount of awareness, an Alpha’s rut had never particularly affected him.
“Have you tried talking to him?” Steve asked, unable to tear his gaze away from the lone figure on the screens in front of him. Tony was huddled on a mattress which had been lain on the floor. No bed frame.
Tony shook his head, “No. Stay. Let Anthony and I treat you today.” He pressed a sleepy, stubble-itchy kiss to Steve’s cheek. “It’s Valentine’s day, darling. We want to spoil you a little.”
Tony pulled his hand away ignoring the hurt that crossed Steve’s face when he did it. “The jury’s still out on whether this whole thing is an illusion or not. But I’m listening. Was it the wizard in the green dress who zapped me with his magic wand?”
Even though he cannot see it, Steve pictures Tony's grin with startling clarity. Tony starts to say something else, but a knock at the door interrupts their conversation. Steve's on his feet in a flash. He heads towards the door to check who it is, posture stiff, but Tony stops him.
“Yes, of course, sir. I’ll just open the door for you now.” The attendant, Darryl Williams as he had introduced himself, fumbled with his card pushing it against the scanner.
"Me too." Steve agreed, possibly a little too eagerly. But Tony just smiled brilliantly back at him.
Steve nodded. “I do.” Tony was a little crazy, and things were always exploding in that workshop of his. But he was earnest, and he tried his best to make Steve feel as comfortable as possible.
me with it.” He ordered. Tony snarled, and then thrust into Steve, long and hard. His fingers dug into Steve’s hips, as he fucked himself into Steve with abandon. Steve moaned as Tony slammed into him, hitting the tight knot of pleasure deep inside. “That’s it,” He encouraged Tony. “Right there, Alpha. You’re being so good for me, Tony. Your cock fits into me so well. Stuff me with your come. Give me your pups.” he moaned filthily. “Make me yours, Alpha.” He gasped out. And Tony fucked into him with more desperation at every word that passed Steve’s lips. His knot slapped against Steve’s ass, and Steve squirmed against it.
“Well.” He heard Tony inhale, and then his breath caught half way. “I thought that might be happening. I can-“ Tony tapped the bridge of his nose sheepishly, “-smell you.”
But Steve knew this was different too. First the fur started to recede, and then slowly, Steve watched as the wolf in his arms turned into the naked, but familiar form of Tony Stark. Steve was ready. Tony’s vulnerable gaze met his own, his Alpha called out to Steve’s Omega and his scent enveloped Steve completely.
“And I want to do it all over again. So say that you will.” Tony coaxed him, kissing the nook of his neck.
Steve huffed. It wasn’t his fault the squirrels got frightened so easily. “Okay. See you later…Tony.”
Tony’s hair tickles Steve, all the glamor, the press smile, and the work weariness melts out of him as he leans into Steve’s touch. His body is corded with thick muscle and his height almost matches Steve’s own, but Tony has softened in the embrace of Steve’s grip. Steve holds his head gently, he can’t stop himself from rubbing small circles into Tony’s nape.
"SHHHHHH We don't talk about that anymore." Tony glanced behind him nervously, but Steve remained undisturbed.
“Tony. You can’t really expect me to do that.” Steve hedges incredulously, raising his hands up in hopes of parrying the tenacious man in front of him.
Steve noticed Anthony burrowing his head into his chest, “Are you wiping your morning drool on my shirt again, kiddo?”
“You have to fuck me.” Steve told him. Tony shifted back so he was leaning over Steve. “You’ve gone into a rut, you need to fuck me. Right now.” Steve slid back a little and took off his t-shirt, then he pulled his sweats down. He knew he wouldn’t need any lubrication. His ass was wet with slick that had already stained a wet patch on his pants since he had decided to go commando. Tony growled as the scent of Steve’s slick assaulted his senses. Steve spread his legs apart as Tony’s teeth clamped down on the exposed skin of his inner thigh. He eagerly lapped at the slick smeared there, and followed the trail down to Steve’s entrance, biting and nipping to mark his way. Steve held his legs up by the back of his knees as Tony enthusiastically drove a tongue into his hole. Steve gasped at the sensation. Tony’s tongue was rough. Steve wondered if that was a remnant from his transformation. It rubbed inside Steve’s entrance as he stroked it in and out. When he finally parted from Steve’s ass, his mouth was wet with Steve’s slick. It heated Steve up, and he pulled Tony towards him by a hand at the back of his head so he could lick his own slick out of Tony’s mouth. Tony moaned above him, eagerly tangling his tongue with Steve’s in a sloppy kiss. Their mouths slid against each other’s, lips warm and tingling.
“It’s a stereotype!” Tony grumbled, as he poured each of them a glass of wine. “A stupid propaganda to tempt more people to join the cause. Incubi and Succubi alike were used to create this delusional lie. I mean, don’t get me wrong. There are absolutely people out there who chose to do sexwork. It’s absolutely a respectable choice. And then there are those who choose to do other things. The sexualization of our species shouldn’t be a caricature for society to mock is what I’m trying to say.”
Steve crashes to the ground hard, and Tony can’t help smirking a little at his wide eyed look. He wipes the sweat dripping down his forehead, and pulls at the collar of his tank top. The front is damp and sticking to him, Tony’s glad he’ll get to hit the showers after this. He looks at Steve, who’s still gaping at him with glassy eyes, a flush high on his cheekbones.
Tony laughed until his whole body shook with it. He laughed from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. His tail snuck out to curl around Steve’s ankle.
Steve cleared his throat and then took his seat, thanking Tony gruffly. Tony leaned down so he could whisper into Steve's ear, "Don't be embarrassed darling, I just want to treat you right."
She just turned up at the compound one day, and none of them had the heart to turn her away. Clint identified her as Fury's cat. It was odd, Fury hadn't seemed like a cat lover, but you never knew with some people. Goose was a gorgeous Ginger, and Steve loved her pretty coat.
”. In one hard thrust he pushed his knot into Steve, and Steve’s back arched as his entrance was stretched to its limit, twitching around Tony’s cock and working around his erection. Tony continued jerking against Steve. His knot dragged against Steve’s entrance as he fucked Steve with it. “Suck my nipples.” Steve moaned out, and Tony latched onto a tight bud, pulling it into his mouth like he was trying to milk Steve. He sucked hard at Steve’s nipple as he continued fucking into him, pushing his cock through the mess of slick. Steve’s orgasm climbed frantically, and he squeezed down on Tony as it approached its peak, wanting them to come together. Tony’s teeth sunk into the gland of Steve’s neck, piercing the tender skin throbbing with an unbearable amount of pleasure, and then Steve was coming. His dick pulsed and his come streaked across Tony’s abdomen. The Alpha continued rutting against him, and Steve gasped as his over sensitized hole clamped down on Tony. He was coming again, he realized, his dick, ass and nipples all aching exquisitely as he clung on to Tony.
Steve’s brows are concentrated, but they laxen with surprise as Tony changes the momentum of his leg, and uses his foot to hook under Steve’s block, executing a sharp jab into his clavicle. Steve winces as the hit makes him lose his footing for less than a second. Steve is quick to recover, but Tony has kept that in mind from the moment he agreed to the friendly spar with his super serumed boyfriend. If he wants a chance at winning a point, he’ll have to end this soon. So his sharp glance catches the falter in Steve’s step, and he moves fluidly with him, this time aiming for Steve’s unstable footing with a low kick in a carefully calculated move.
"No buts. Not right now, please. Just, take care of him for me. He needs that more than I do." Tony dodged Carol's concerned gaze. "I'll be fine. I'll just take care of whatever's going on in Central Park and then be back here in a jiffy. Cap- Steve, he might wake up while I'm gone. He's not taken kindly to any attempts at separation, so I don't know how he might react." Tony swallowed. "He might get violent. He doesn't meant to, you know Cap," Tony's eyes pleaded, "but he might anyway. This whole thing has really messed him up."
"No, it looks fine." Steve hears himself replying. And it does. Look fine. It looks better than fine. Tony's face is smooth and hairless, and Steve-
"Of course I want to Steve!" Tony immediately amended. "But we only just met. Are you sure you'd be okay with me being there?"
Steve rubbed a hand across his face, then he took Tony’s hand into his own. “Sweetheart, you got hit by an infinity stone. It’s a magic stone that has mind powers.”
“I am most definitely not okay, but I need you to be honest with me. Remember how we were discussing hypotheticals, and how you would never really be able to know if you jumped back in time or just hopped into a parallel universe. And remember that code we came up with? Just in case something like that happened. A contingency.”
Steve huffed in annoyance, “My point is, maybe, we could try it out between us?” He felt embarrassed now that he had said it and of course Tony noticed.
Steve frowned. Sure, he wasn’t expecting a emotional reunion when it had only been hours since they last saw each other, but a hello would have been nice. Steve entered the room after him. He scanned the room, Fury was at the helm of the conference table, Jan and Hank to his left, Banner to his right, and Tony beside him. Clint was perched on a chair a little further away from everyone else. Steve made a beeline for the chair beside Tony’s. Tony stiffened when Steve settled into the seat beside his, but he turned and gave Steve a warm smile. “Glad you made it to the other side, Captain.” He greeted.
“Dad? Are you okay? Is something wrong?” The kid asked him. And Tony didn’t really have it in him to push the kid away again.
Steve thought. It was overwhelming. Steve arched his head into the pillow under it, and keened. Tony pushed his tongue inside. His facial hair rubbed against Steve’s sensitive folds. He seemed to know exactly when to lick and where to suck as Steve was driven towards the first orgasm he had ever had
Experience came at a price. And finally Potts himself had been caught in the blast radius of a bomb and had to have an electromagnet inserted into his chest. The scarring was grotesque and a reminder of how fragile his own life was. He set down the scalpel and decided to build things instead. It made him feel useful instead of guilty about the chip on his shoulder.
"Whatever you say, flyboy." She took a step closer in Steve's direction and Tony found himself intercepting her.
." Stevens gasped. He sounded anguished, but Potts wasn't sure if that was because of the shot in his leg or his defective heart.
Tony breathed shakily. Then he closed his eyes and focused. It didn’t take long for Steve to feel it. The sensation of his desires brimming to the surface. His first kiss, his first sexual thought, the things he liked to think about when he jerked himself off, he felt like he was feeling it all at once. But Tony was there too, anchoring Steve, keeping the sensations at bay so Steve didn’t drown in them. For something so sexual, it felt incredibly intimate.
He sat on top of the Shawarma shop for a while. He analyzed all the information, sorted it into categories and then analyzed it again.
Whatever expression he was wearing seemed to gain Carter’s sympathy. “It was his idea, we have some excellent services here, and he suggested we extend it to a childcare ward.”
Tony didn’t have it in him to break the kid’s fantasies so he didn’t respond to Peter’s words. His lab looked nothing like he remembered either, rather than the shiny new space he was still getting used to- the lab looked lived in.
"If you like him so much, how come you waited a month to tell me about him?" Tony prodded, tickling a Socked foot that had Bulbasaur on the front.
Steve thought, a little delirious. Tony cleaned his own come off of Steve, leaving him sticky with saliva instead. He knew that the act had no functionality, nevertheless his toes curled as it made him feel cared for. Soon, Tony’s mouth found Steve’s nipples again, and he closed his mouth over them, his canines digging into Steve’s areola. He was rutting against Steve again, but this time at a more languid pace, adjusting himself until his cock was nestled between Steve’s folds and nudging up behind Steve’s balls. He sucked on Steve’s nipples until they felt as sensitive as his pussy. His cock dragged slowly across Steve’s opening and ground into his balls.
"Ugh. At least with Steve around I won't be the only one rolling my eyes while you and uncle Greg compete over who's gonna admit that they're greying first."
"Stevens," the man introduced himself, "Captain Stevens. I was hoping I could get a word with Doctor Potts?" He asked, shuffling his feet while his back remained pin straight.
"That's not what I heard." Stevens refuted. "I heard that had things gone south, the consequences you would have had to face would have been quite steep."
“I’m just looking after him for a few weeks.” Potts tells him. His hands are free from grease stains, a rarity, which means he took the effort to keep them clean so he can give the pup belly rubs as and when he likes.
“It’s memory loss, pa.” Peter piped up from the bean couch he had sprawled himself on. “He doesn’t remember us. Shouldn’t be too hard to fix if we can get our hands on whatever did this to him. Right?” The last word revealed the kid’s vulnerability, and he looked at Steve like he wanted to be reassured that it would all be okay.
“I am now,” Steve replied, stifling a pained groan. He was a super soldier, and yet his two year old son seemed to find all of Steve’s soft spots to dig his elbows and knees into.
They were decontaminated and then isolated on arrival. Steve laid on the cot in the room he was guided to. It was bare and clinical, by regulation. He hadn’t been able to talk to Tony since they had left Savage land and he wondered how he was doing as they were both likely to be receiving the same treatment. Steve couldn’t entirely comprehend why they had to be separated. Stark, for all his flamboyant fallacies, would have been steadying company. Steve draped his forearm over his eyes. If they had caught something, wouldn’t it have been the same thing? Whatever ‘thing’ entailed.
“Tony? What’s going on?” he ran a worried glance over Tony’s face, and whatever he saw there just made the furrow between his brows deepen. “I want you to stay where you are, sweetheart. I’m on my way.”
“Let’s go home, Tony.” Steve said, holding out his hand to them. Peter was still clinging to Tony’s side and Tony didn’t really want to let the kid go either. He hesitated a little before he held Steve’s hand.
It shouldn’t have surprised him as much as it did. He was living up to a stereotype too, after all. A lone werewolf inhabiting a cabin in the woods. But Steve had been living alone in the woods for months, so maybe he wasn’t too much at fault for just staring at the man like a bug eyed fish.
“Oh I’m alright!” The man said cheerfully. “Just new to these parts.” He flipped a pair of sunglasses over his eyes. “Tony Stark, at your service. I think I’m your new neighbor, Mr….” He hooked his index finger over the bridge of his glasses so he could look up at Steve from under his long lashes.
Steve grinned, “Well, you have the very best helper. So I guess I can sleep in a little.” He leaned in to kiss Tony and then whispered, “Let me know if you need any help, yeah?”
“Thank you, Tony.” Steve said leaning up to kiss his husband. “Thank you Ant.” He added, pecking his son’s proffered cheek. There was even a freshly cut rose on the tray. Under watchful eyes he scooped up some of the eggs into a fork and popped it into his mouth. The warm flavour burst on his palette. “This is delicious.” He complimented.
The heat low in his belly just coiled tighter as the time passed. Finally, after what felt like hours, but was probably no more than thirty minutes, someone came to let Steve out of the room. He was handed a change of clothes, and Steve was grateful, because they ones he was wearing were drenched through. He wiped the excess wetness best he could, and then pulled on the new pair of shorts and a fresh shirt. The attendant was waiting outside the lab for him to be done and led him to the meeting room. Steve followed after, trying not to snap at anyone who looked his way for more than a second.
So, in this alternate reality, or mirage (the evidence wasn’t conclusive enough) Tony had a potential future husband. Named Steve. For a villainous endeavor, this was a little too domestic for his tastes. Who in their right mind would buy this story. But he disconnected the call with Pepper, and almost on autopilot accepted the incoming call.
To an extent, it had worked. Goose's presence had been a welcome distraction at the compound. She seemed to instinctively know when her presence was needed. Steve would see her hopping onto the counter in the labs, forcing Bruce to take a break by making him pet her. Natasha would sometimes curl up on a couch in the common room with Goose snuggled up right next to her, languidly running her fingers though the cat's soft fur.
Tony held Steve’s hand in his, and gently pried his mouth off. “I don’t know how much longer I have left Steve.” He kissed Steve’s shoulder gently. “But I thank you for this.” He pressed his face into the crook of Steve’s shoulder and Steve felt it in his own heart when his shoulder was wet with the warmth of Tony’s tears.
Tony didn't call him out on it, however. He just took Steve's hand in his, and brought it closer towards Goose for the cat to smell it. The cat gave his hand one cautions sniff, and then a tiny tongue peeked out to give his fingers a small lick.
"Sana is an Omega weightlifting champion who competes in the general category. The first of her generation!" Tony told him, excitement obvious.
Steve nodded even though Tony couldn’t see him. It didn’t take him long to find Tony’s bedroom. Steve stripped quickly and then sprawled himself across Tony’s bed. Tony’s scent was so strong in this room. Steve moaned, his hand dropping to his erection. He wrapped his fingers around the length and pumped it. Slick and pre-cum gushed out of his ass and dick respectively. Steve reached down lower, to trace a finger around his entrance. The wet and soft hole twitched, trying to suck in his finger. Steve slowly slipped the digit in watching with fascination as it sunk in deeper. He bit his lip and grunted. Steve was usually very sensitive, but hot slick at his entrance, a clear fluid that dripped down his fingers, tingled where it was smeared on the curve of his parted cheeks.
Tony is pretty sure all the blood in his body is now in his dick, and he processes Steve’s words carefully, still facing the door. “So what you’re saying,” he tries, “Is that once every six months during your heat you...lactate? And it’s a result of the hormones in your body preparing to house a child?”
“Oh fuck, Darling no.” Tony groaned. He must have scented Steve’s presence. Steve ignored the twinge in his chest at Tony being able to recognize it in all of its unmodified glory. He had taken off his scent blockers that morning. Steve's scent was weak due to prolonged use of scent blockers from his teenage years, but he watched Tony breathe it in like a starved man.
“You like that, huh?” Steve asked him, amused. “Would you like me to call you a good boy, then?” He teased, but Tony’s large wolf form froze under his touch. Steve worried that he had said he wrong thing for a moment, but Tony yelped eagerly, his tail twitching from side to side in what Steve was sure, in universal canine speak, was a sign he was pleased. Another rush of pheromones filled the room, and this time Tony whined pitifully, panting through his open jaw, drooling all over Steve’s sweats.
Finally, Steve heard him take the steps needed to bring him within arm’s reach. Soft fur brushed against Steve’s cheek. Tony jumped away at the contact. His gaze burned across Steve’s skin. After a while of standing where he was, he took a few steps closer, and then Steve felt a snout bury itself against his knee. They remained like that for what could have been minutes or hours. Taking in long breaths, Steve twitched his fingers out and was met with more soft fur. Tony shifted under his hand, but didn’t move away. So Steve stretched his fingers out and marveled at the softness of Tony’s coat. He pushed his fingers in, and rubbed them into Tony’s head. Tony rumbled, lifted his head, and dropped it into Steve’s lap, his wet nose meeting the gland on the wrist of Steve’s other hand. Taking a chance, Steve opened his eyes, slowly. Big blue eyes looked back at Steve through lazily hooded lids. Tony’s fur was dark, and Steve ran his fingers through it, luxuriating in the sensation. Tony rumbled again.
He heard Tony huff, and then pad closer. He approached Steve, and then backed off. Steve remained as he was, patient. He had worn his softest t-shirt and a pair of sweats. The clothes were well worn, ones he used when he was relaxing at home. He wanted to exude as much of a complacent scent as was possible. Tony needed to know that Steve wanted to be here. That Steve was comfortable being here. Steve did not move an inch as Tony made his rounds around the room.
Thor seemed to be able to communicate with her. Steve wondered if that was because of his Allspeak. He was always murmuring to her with a small, contemplative frown on his face, very different from the sunny smiles he showed the rest of them. Steve was glad Thor had found someone to confide in, the Asgardian sometimes forgot that he didn't have to be a positive force constantly, and it was okay to take the time he needed to grieve.
I have no idea who you are. Tony thought, as clear blue eyes looked at him with so much familiarity that it ached.
Steve is showering two heads away from the one Tony had occupied earlier. The water darkens his blond hair, cascading down his back in tempting rivulets that travel the dips of his muscles. His skin gleams under the water, slick and wet. And that is enough to stop Tony in his tracks, it is. But what really twists his tongue in his mouth, is the way Steve has his head thrown back, hands on his chest, firmly massaging his pecs.
Tony sighed with affection. “The things you say, Cap.” He murmured. He was in a black tank top and a pair of sweats today. He rubbed his hand on his pants and then reached out and cupped Steve’s cheek. “I can take it from the atmosphere. But I can only show you if I do this. I can also take more from you like this, but I wouldn’t do that without asking.”
So when Stevens came down to the infirmary, well, the nurses intercepted him first giving him a preliminary check up. Stevens ducked his head. "Good day, Ma'am," he greeted, "I think I might need some assistance." Polite, as Nurse Winona led him to one of the beds. His pallor was steadily worsening, and Potts hurried to his bedside.
Hank pushed the buttons, and Stevens heard him mumbling under his breath, "third time today," but he resolutely ignored the man and struck up a conversation with Potts.
“Well,” Stark clapped his hands together. “I better get going. Got an ol’ shack to clean up. You know how it goes.”
Slick was covering his thighs now, and Steve’s throat felt dry. He gulped down the rest of the water, and tore open the plastic packaging so he could take a bite from the muffin. Tony was munching on a cookie himself. Steve realized that they hadn’t eaten since the mission, and he pulled at tray closer to himself. There was an assortment on it, packaged cookies, cakes, a couple of quickly made sandwiches, etc. Steve picked up a sandwich and his stomach thanked him for it. He had been so focused on the sex that he had forgotten about his hunger. After he’d devoured a substantial amount of the food on the tray, he set it to the side and rolled his body in Tony’s direction. Tony smirked at him, lips drawing a pleased expression on his mouth. “C’mere darling,” he murmured, pulling Steve in closer with a leading hand on his shoulder. Tony pressed his lips against Steve’s and then angled his head and sucked Steve’s lower lip into his mouth, running his tongue along it and biting down gently before he let go.
Tony slowly pried the kid off of him. “I’m sorry kid, but I know I don’t have any progeny running around despite the sensationalization of the dalliances of my youth.”
And well. The back of Stevens neck heats up. Potts is obviously talking to the puppy, but he’s previously called Stevens ‘Cap’ too. Potts doesn’t notice Stevens’ little hiccup, he continues smothering the puppy with affectionate praises.
His brow twitched. He overturned his emotions and identified irritation. Huffing, he flipped over to his side on the bed and punched his pillow to fluff it up. He could picture Stark’s playful expression and come-hither eyes had they been allowed to remain together. He would have lounged across the bed and probably said something utterly ridiculous like,
Steve folded the letter neatly and kept it in a box where it stashed all the other letters he received. It was kind of his friends to write to him. They had all offered him a place to stay, but Steve didn’t want to impose.  He didn’t want to be the person who constantly reminded them of the past when they were trying to move on.
Steve remembered nodding his head, being too young to truly understand his mother’s desperation, but frightened into a resolve nonetheless. He never forgot his medication, not before he had been injected with the serum and not after it.
, and Steve felt like he was a second away from losing his mind. But if Tony would just let him fucking help, then Steve wouldn’t have to think about how fucked up of an omega he was, how he was probably the worst option for Tony right now, and how despite all that he wanted to do this anyway. He tossed his soaked trousers to the ground. He had been sitting in his own slick for five hours, something he didn’t know he could still produce.
Steve turns around and heads to the bathroom. He doesn't look back, but he's pretty sure Tony will asses Steve's work through the lone mirror in the room. Caught off guard or not, Tony is as competitive as he is after all.
Stevens had just returned from a month long mission. He leaned against a corner and shut his eyes, trying not to sigh out his weariness. He would have probably fallen asleep in that position, if not for the concerned, "Captain?"
“Tony,” Captain America said, radiating concern. He came and knelt by Tony’s side. “Tony what’s going on? What happened?”
“Why did you come here?” Steve asked him. He brushed the soft locks of hair away from Tony’s forehead.
The man grinned at him, wide and beautiful. Steve couldn’t help sneaking another glance towards the heavens. They really lost their citizens fairly easily. Steve would like to say this was the first white robed beauty he had come across until now, but he wasn’t.
Steve let out grunt when Anthony’s elbow dug into his side as the little boy scrambled off his chest and landed on his feet at the side of the bed. Anthony was wearing a pale blue sleeper with fluffy white clouds on them.
“Alpha?” Steve mumbled, not sure what he was asking. Tony nosed away Steve’s hair and bit down on the back of his neck, not hard enough to scar. No matter how right it felt, he knew Tony wouldn’t mate him while they were both out of it like this. The feeling of Tony’s teeth soothed Steve, and he heard himself purring in response.
"I'd like to know." Stevens said, and placed a hand on the bed by Potts' elbow. The tips of his fingers brushed across Potts' bared skin.
His body took to the outlet, but his mind continued to wander. The Isolation Bay at the triskelion was probably a more extensive boarding than available in most other government facilities. They likely had Tony in in a room mirroring this one. The discomfort Steve was feeling only grew, and he went down deeper, biceps straining under his own weight. He bit down on his lower lip, the flesh reddening under the pressure. He thought back to the last glance he had been able to take of Tony. He had looked a lot less disoriented than Steve had been, flashing a smile at the lab technicians. His Tony Stark persona unfurling like a cat waking up from a nap. Jarvis was not around anymore, but someone had pushed a red martini into Tony’s hands, and he’d tossed it back in a long drink that bobbed his throat.
When she left them along again, Tony turned his attention back to Steve. "Tell me about yourself?" He asked, and taking a gander he hooked his ankle around Steve's under the table.
“What, you’re-“ Tony visibly sniffed the air again, and his eyes widened when he probably caught the sweetening nature of Steve’s scent. “Oh. You’re not.”
He loosens his shoulders and plasters a genial smile on his face. He still has his guard up, but when he opens the door it's just one of the staff come to deliver their room service. Tony hops off the bed and eagerly walks over to peruse the contents of the trolley.
Steve’s chest is- Tony swallows as saliva rushes into his mouth. His chest is quite different from the last time Tony saw him. His pecs are plumper, filling up Steve’s large hands nicely, and his nipples are red and engorged. They bounce a little as Steve squeezes them together and then lets go. He’s moaning softly, huffing under his breath, and he looks a little frustrated.  Tony’s eyes are riveted as he watches Steve play with his pecs- no, they look like, Tony clenches his palms, they look like a pair of tits. Nipples tight, and swollen as Steve rolls them between his fingers. A pearlescent bead rolls down from one of Steve’s buds. He presses his thumb into it, flicking the drop, and then reaches up to suck the digit into his mouth.
Steve knew there was a little more to it, but Iron man always underplayed what he did for others. He never seemed to believe in himself the way Steve believed in him.
“It’s not!” Peter pushed away from Steve and jumped to his feet. “You’re my dad! And we’re your family!”
Steve hated to call them friends, the word always coated heavily in double entendre when he thought it. They weren’t friends. Tony was easy with his words and easier with his relationships. He welcomed people to his bed like the turning of seasons, and Steve had abhorred the thought of being another notch to his bedpost. He still found himself drawn to it, despising and unable to resist the charm Stark cologned himself with. His couldn’t stop his hands from reaching out and twisting into dark locks, watching as the man’s breath hitched. Stark was so easy, and that never failed to arouse Steve. The rules to the game they were playing had been set in place at the start. Physical relief, it was quite common in the army. Lending a hand, a quick and easily accessible convenience. That’s what he and Stark were to each other. Stark himself emphasizing this at the beginning of their dalliance.
A smile curled on Steve’s mouth and Peter laughed. Tony quashed the fuzzy feeling of belonging that gave him. This was a fake family. There was no way Captain America was dating Tony stark. “Could the stone create illusions?”
The father-son duo cheered and then hi-fived each other over Steve’s tray. Steve cut a piece of pancake next, and this time he held it out in front of Ant. Ant gave the fork a conflicted pout, “This is papa’s, not Ant’s.”
Tony’s cock throbbed in his ass, and impossibly, his knot thickened further, impaling Steve. Thick ropes of come painted Steve’s inner walls, again and again, until Steve could feel it leaking from around Tony’s cock, dripping down his ass and mixing with his slick. Their scents had merged, and Tony flopped down onto Steve, nuzzling the side of his face as they remained locked for however long it would take for Tony’s knot to subside. Steve pushed back the sweat slicked strands of Tony’s short hair. Tony looked up at him, his eyes glazed over in satiation. Steve pressed a palm to his cheek to gain his attention, and then, just for Tony and him to hear he whispered under his breath, “You were perfect, Tony. You were so good for me, Alpha.”
Potts blinks at him, and then laughs sheepishly, “Sorry, Cap is just too adorable. I can’t help it.”
They finished their food in record time, and when Steve realised that it would mean the end of their date, he showed down with his last few bites.
He had the instincts of a werewolf but the mindset of a human. There were parts to him that were both wolf and Steve, however. His protective instincts were one of these parts.
Tony groaned loud, he leaned forward to rest his forearms on either side of Steve’s head, darkened blue eyes searching Steve’s as his expression twisted with arousal. Steve stopped breathing as their eyes met. He palmed Tony’s cheek gently, “C’mon Tony, fuck me sweetheart.” He mumbled, brushing his lips against Tony’s. Tony whined at the endearment, and then his hips were snapping against Steve’s, his cock filling Steve up again and again as he fucked him aggressively into the mattress. Steve clenched hard on each downthrust, enjoying how Tony’s mouth parted as another moan tore out of it.
Sana brought them their food, plates and plates of delicious sushi and fried seafood. Steve tried to keep his salivation discreet, and he took the opportunity to change the pace of the conversation. "What about you?" He asked.
The elevator announced their arrival, and Steve cornered Tony against the wall as soon as he stepped out of it. Their noses brushed against each other, and then Steve pressed his lips to Tony’s. Tony’s mouth was soft and willing, his tongue slid along Steve’s eagerly. Steve tugged impatiently at the hem of Tony’s shirt, but Tong pushed him back using all his self control. “You need to eat first.” He told Steve.
That was how it started. Every full moon during the war was spent with Iron man at his side. Iron man helped hold him down when Steve didn’t trust himself, and then, eventually, he helped Steve learn to accept himself.
Anthony rolled his eyes from where he had flopped onto Tony's bed. "Of course he'll like you dad. He's not
Tony complies easily. The warm water seeps through his pants on contact with the floor. On his knees, he looks up at Steve, waiting to be told what to do next. His cock is hard in his pants, tenting the front, he wants to touch it, but he keeps his hands obediently to his sides. Steve steps out from under the shower, and walks the two steps needed to take him to Tony’s side. “Good boy,” he praises, and Tony thinks he might come right then. The praise flutters in his stomach, spreading molten heat through his body.
Fury stared him down. He took in the stubborn set of Steve’s broad shoulders, and the clench in his jaw. “You know what you’re asking for, Rogers?” He questioned. “He’s gone into Rut now. If he does accept you, we won’t be able to send anyone else in. His Alpha would reject all other Omegas.”
Stevens is out of the chair and through the door before she managed to complete the sentence. He prowls all the way to the next building, it’s relatively new, Potts had been especially gleeful about all the shiny new appliances he had been able to order in. Stevens hadn’t been paying proper attention then, distracted by the way Potts was twirling a screwdriver between his long fingers.
Tony was rubbing soothing circles into his back now, “What is it, Steve? You know you can ask me anything, darling” He coaxed.
Stevens makes quick excuses and runs out of the lab with his own proverbial tail tucked between his legs.
Potts didn't miss a beat, "You'll have to suffer the one day of the month when you don't look perfect, I suppose. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone else." He replied with a cheeky grin. The words were probably innocent, but they made Stevens' pulse flutter for a brief second.
The next few weeks turn out to be the best and most torturous of Stevens’ time in SHIELD. Potts takes the puppy with him everywhere he goes, and Stevens is already conditioned to seek out Potts whenever the two of them are in the same building together.
“I love you.” Tony said, and then nudged Steve to face him so he could kiss him properly. Steve sighed happily as Tony kissed him languidly.
"That's amazing." Steve replied. And it really was, especially since Steve himself was considered an anomaly, he knew how tough breaking stereotypes could be.
Steve doesn’t know what he means by ‘different’, different to Tony’s other experiences? different to their friendly wrist marking? But he nods his head and agrees, “Yeah. Different.” Because it was different.
Steve shakes his head. What was the point he had been trying to make? Oh yeah, it isn't a big deal that Steve likes Tony. Tony is his best friend. What is problematic however, is that he is starting to wonder what would it be like if he got to date said friend? What would it be like if Tony didn't have to wear Steve's scent just to chase off other Alphas, but wore it because he wanted to? What would it feel like to turn to Tony during a harrowing press conference and reach out and entangle his fingers with the omega's. What would Tony's calloused palms feel like when held in his?
“Steve! How dare you say such nice things when I’m indisposed.” Tony protested. He flapped his hands around adamantly until Steve grabbed one. Tony squeezed his hand, “You’re the best neighbor a demon could ask for Steve. And the best friend too.”
"I just..." Tony took in a deep breath, "He's vulnerable like this. And I really don't want to leave him, but Jan wouldn't have called me in if she didn't need me."
Tony rubbed his ankles and curled his own legs under him. His tail rubbed against Steve’s feet. It felt like soft velvet, a bit cat-like. “I can’t see you ever hurting anyone, Steve. But I guess saying that doesn’t really help.”
Tony, for the first time today, grinned. “Now you’re speaking my language. Do you know where the labs are?”
Tony twisted his body to look at Steve, "I think she might be getting there, at least." He said, giving Steve a shy, soft smile of his own.
The chatter kept up in the car as Tony drove them to one of his favourite sushi places. Steve had taken the subway on his way over as per Anthony's instructions, which was perfect because it gave Tony the opportunity to show off one of his many cars. And if the little glances Steve kept shooting him were anything to go by, then Steve was well impressed.
No, wait, that’s not what Steve wanted to ask them. He foundered for a moment as the Doctor looked him over critically, “Mr. Stark has been allocated a different room on the Bay. Taking into account your situation, the decision was made under sound judgement.”
Tony sighed. Breaking a kid’s heart was always shitty, even if the kid was just an illusion. “Listen up kiddo, I know who I am, alright. Tony Stark, billionaire, play-“
Steve shrugged it off and looked up at Stark expectantly. Stark returned the look with inexplicable fondness. He then kicked off the tree branch he was seated on. Steve caught him easily. Stark wasn’t light by any means. The man had some bulk on him, this could be because of his demon genetics or maybe he worked out.
“Alright darling,” Tony soothed, and then he was pressing the head of his cock against Steve’s entrance, slowly breaching Steve inch by inch while Steve moaned and dug his fingers into the sheets, tearing them up.
A gush of wetness filled the light cotton pants he had been given and Steve startled out of his fantasy. His cock was tenting the front of his pants, a growing wet patch easily visible from where the tip was pressing into the material. Steve cursed his inattention, and then focused on the sensation coming from his ass. He couldn’t have...pissed his pants, considering that it would have affected the front too. Concerned, he stuck his hand down his pants, feeling the stickiness along his bare asscheeks. When he pulled his hands out to inspect, his fingers were coated in a thick, clear liquid. He rubbed his fingers together, testing the viscosity of the liquid, and furrowed his brow together at the familiarity. He could be wrong...but it felt a little bit like lube. He wondered if it was remnant from his earlier activities with Tony. Another gush of the slick ran down his leg from his hole at the memory of Tony fucking him open and Steve’s eyes widened in shock. His hand automatically stretched out to the button they had asked him to press if he needed anything. It was only when he released it, that apprehension caught in this throat. What was he supposed to say? That his ass was getting wet? Something about that settled uncomfortably at the pit of his stomach. His desire to see Stark grew bolder in his mind. Tony, for all the perverse things he might say or think, would never be cruel or judgemental.
“God kid, I’m sorry” Tony apologized as Peter broke down in his arms. The kid was clawing the front of the armor and Tony did what came instinctually. He gave Jarvis the command and stepped out of the armor.
They were also a lot safer. Steve rolled up the sleeve of his arm and stared at it. The serum had managed to heal new scars but the old ones remained, a constellation of pin pricks that were now barely visible. Steve hadn’t known that some of the ailments he had suffered during his youth were not a result of his own poor health, but side effects, until the doctor who handed him his prescription listed them off. The mood swings had become a part of his personality. The doctor, introduced to him by fury, had looked at him with eyes that were too serious and said, “I don’t know if you will ever be able to have children, Mr. Rogers. Omeganix, which was the most common black market brand available then, was too strong and hadn’t been tested enough either. The serum helped you, but your development had already been impacted.”
“You gonna fuck me, or what, Alpha?” Steve asked him, and Tony eagerly lined his cock with Steve’s puffy and leaking entrance. With a groan, he slid his cock in. He was being careful, slow. So Steve pushed a heel into Tony’s ass and impaled himself the rest of the way. He snapped his hips, fucking himself on Tony’s cock best he could from his position. It burned going in, but the friction was addictive “C’mon Tony, be a good boy and
Potts didn't reply immediately, and then he sighed, "Do you know how much that terrified me? To see you just drop to the ground like that?" He squeezed Stevens hand. "It was one of the worst moments of my life."
Child. Steve with child, his belly round and tits leaking. Arousal hits Tony with a sledgehammer and he turns around to look at Steve, “And you’re asking me if I think it’s weird, darling?” His eyes are back on Steve’s chest, where Steve is still massaging his tits in his palms, his breathing labored.
Anthony made a face. "Whatever you say, dad. Steve likes sushi, he told me when we were watching that baseball match together."
Steve bit down on Tony’s lower lip, and then he looked up at where he knew the cameras were installed in the room. “Tony,” he said, wrapping his fingers into Tony’s hair and tugging his head back to show him the cameras. “You will put that knot in me now.” He ordered calmly into the shell of Tony’s ear. “You’re going to fuck me hard, open me up on your cock. And you’re going to show them whom I belong to, fill me up with all the come in that thick knot of yours.”
“Great!” Stark cheered. “I’ll have everything ready, just come to my workshop this evening after you’re done with scaring the squirrels or whatever it is you get up to everyday.”
Steve braced himself on one arm, and used the other to grip the back of Tony’s head, “It feels amazing,Tony. Fill me up with your come. Can you do that for me?
Wilson was nice enough to not laugh out loud, but Stevens could feel him shaking through the hand still attached to his shoulder.
“Have you been looking me up Steve!” Tony exclaimed with ill-concealed glee. “Darling! The Internet has nothing nice to say about Incubi. When did you do it? You get no connectivity here even though I’ve begged you to let me set up some WiFi for you, at least.”
Tony looked at him. His eyes were a ring of bright blue engulfed by his pupils. “S-Sweetheart, you need to get out of here. I’ll be okay.”
The first time Potts met Stevens, the man had come limping into the infirmary. His face was pale, but he held himself upright. Potts wasn't supposed to be down at the infirmary himself, it wasn't really his job. But Berta was having twins, and Dr. Miller had shoved his coat towards Potts in the hallway with an, "I'll buy you dinner next time!" and rushed off to the hospital to be with his wife. Through his bewilderment, Potts allowed himself to feel amused by the irony of the situation.
Fury cleared his throat to gain their attention, and Tony’s eyes slid back to him. Steve stared at the shift of his broad shoulders, he knew what those shoulders looked like without anything on them. Tan skin, with a scattering of small scars, knotted thick with muscle. The wetness was now leaking down his thighs. Steve licked his lips. He hoped nobody would notice.
Steve knew Stark’s type, a Casanova who had his pick of the litter. Steve was just one of the many to him. He stared up at the wall the thought settling uncomfortably in his stomach. There was a rustling sound as the speakers in the room turned on, “You paged us, Captain?” An elderly doctors voice asked, and Steve rolled off the bed. Standing up, he faced the glass wall. A doctor and two bulky attendants looked at him questioningly from behind the glass. Steve cleared his throat, and then, assuming there were microphones or something picking up what he was saying, he asked,  “Where’s Tony?”
