Cas now appreciates how clever the Empty had been. It understood angels; it understood Cas. And therefore, it knew that “happiness” was a new variable, a kink in the equation. But it also overplayed its hand, sowing the seeds of its own destruction. Happiness put Cas in the Empty, but it also broke him out.
“He no longer exists. Anywhere.”
just turns Cas on—and he goes over to kiss her and Dean feels a combination of emotions: relief that Cas is alive, horror that he’s kissing Meg, and anxiety that their bocce balls are about to fall into a roaring creek that has just appeared and seems to get bigger and bigger. “Cas, we need to get out of here,” he says, “the water is rising”—and then there’s a tornado, or maybe more than one, the kind of “tornado alley” cataclysmic event where four approach all at once, and one is made of the same goo as the Empty.
“Dean is having his own dream. Like this one, but different.”
“Once it introduced the concept to me—told me that it wouldn’t take me until I experienced happiness … I couldn’t stop thinking about it.”
“Maybe it’s a deity?” Dean ventures. Sounds about right. A deity who’s bored off his ass by the Pax Jackana.
After Sam went to bed, Dean continued to drink and Cas stayed with him. Even though they were inside, deep underground, the shadows seemed to grow longer. Finally Dean got up from the table. Cas planned on staying there—he rarely slept anyway.
Miraculously, parking doesn’t seem to be a problem. There’s a garage with spaces and spaces and spaces. The conveniences of modern heaven.
“If you know, then you know this is deeply wrong, Jack. Unfair. You can make this right.”
“Of course I know that. But it doesn’t make it easier. And when I got back? You boys—” She stops.
Dean just feels bored of this already—of the pandemic, of Sam’s anxiety, of an utter lack of anything to do, of any way to
No one had a solid answer except Metatron, who cited his superior powers of observation and deduction. “I mean, look around. What else do we have in common? Our stellar good looks?”
Dean takes Cas's hand in his again immediately. “I don't know much about any of that, Cas. And you don't need to explain."
He doesn’t know which to ask first.
“Well, I’ve never heard of this term, this ‘man-crush.’”
“Okay, Cas. But don’t take too long. You swear you’ll be right behind me?”
An absurd prospect—one with too many contingencies. Not happening.
“Your brother used his last minutes in the same way, Sam. He told you things that are right and true—things you can’t bring yourself to believe. That you’re smart. That you’re the strong one. That he admired you, that you were the one he looked up to. What he aspired to be. Look at me, Sam.”
Now he wishes he’d gone to Dean before it was too late.
“And you wouldn’t have to worry about losing or forgetting anything.”
, Cas thought at first. So crude and irreverent. He wondered how someone who’d seen so much could have so little faith in a higher power. Then he realized: Dean had faith in a higher power—he just had faith that the higher power
He’d never met two beings, on heaven or earth, who had such integrity. He was baffled by it at first—and later, humbled. They didn’t care what anyone thought, what anyone said. They questioned every source of knowledge, every assumption, rather than falling back on what anyone told them to do.
at it, just as you didn’t ask the teacher if she forgot to assign homework. No, when you worked at a convenience store, you got high in the backroom and “borrowed” from the cash register. And quit before they could fire you.
Cas is still, clenching his fist to his chest.
Heart pounding, he drafts a message. Hits send.
Cas just looks more confused. “You said it, Dean.”
Cas set his hands on Malachi’s shoulders, stared straight into his eyes. “You’ve done terrible things, Malachi. You’ve killed angels. You’ve butchered friends. Innocent humans. Tortured people. Started insurrections. You mowed down anyone who got in your way. Just like me.”
He doesn’t remember much. Only getting up to see the other angels in the common room, and then leaving abruptly to go back to his room, and then the ground rushing up to meet him, and—
“As I said,” Metatron continued, “welcome to the snitch ward. Otherwise known as the ninth circle of hell, made specially to house those who betrayed their own kind.”
Cas narrows his eyes. “Caged. To be reconciled, you have to be sincere. Jack believes in rehabilitation, but he’s not stupid.”
Metatron rolled his eyes. “The Kardashians, Einstein. Who do you think? Everyone we put here. And others for good measure. Anyone not feeling the love.”
“No, there’s—” Dean’s been to town. He never saw any library.
? The idea is absurd! No, instead they’d give you some line about “maintaining a healthy distance” from humanity to “preserve the sacred duties they’ve been assigned.”
Cas turned to Metatron. “You’re the one who introduced the idea of a ‘snitch ward,’ Metatron. You set the narrative. You told a story—a convincing story, which got everyone on board. We bought it.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you,” Jack continued. He sniffled. “I promised Cas. He didn’t want to worry you. And—he assured me that would probably never happen, that he was so far from being happy, let alone truly happy, that—” Jack’s voice broke. A moment of silence. Then, a whisper, a realization as instant as light cast into darkness: “Oh. Oh my God.”
Dean tells Sam he wants to move forward, just as they’ve always moved forward in the past.
“You’re human,” Cas said.
He pushes back hard against Dean, pulling them together at the waist as Dean had done. Then he hooks one finger to the front of Dean’s jeans, and starts to undo the button. Reaches inside.
“I don’t do metaphors very well myself, Hannah. It’s something I struggled with during my time on earth.”
“It’s just—I can’t do it again. I can’t be a dad again.”
Dean just says “okay,” and lets Cas take him by the hand and guide him from the bench. He knows that he’d been right, all those months ago, not to accept that everything was over. It hadn’t even begun.
Or Cas.
“Damn.”
With that, Dean’s out of his chair. He grabs Sam by the shirt and shoves him into the wall. “He’s not dead. We don’t know that yet.” Gives him one more half-hearted shove before leaving the room.
“Will you shut the fuck up?” Crowley said. “Listening to you chucklefucks talk about your persecution complexes makes me want to beg for waterboarding. Or a Mariah Carey Christmas album.”
,” Dean says. “The year’s not over.”
Jack stared straight at him in that way that was unnerving—both comforting and unsettling. He didn’t blink. His eyes were wet. “Castiel made a deal with it.”
She squeezes his hands.
Passover offensives.)
“Wow, kid, you sure know how to make an entrance,” Dean says.
He straightens just as “Angel of the Morning” ends and another song begins. Lady Gaga’s “Just Dance.” And that, ladies and gentlemen, is his cue to get the fuck out.
and stepped into endless death. And Dean can’t stop thinking about the past.
Dean collapses into Cas’s arms again, and they begin kissing, and kissing, and finding each other in the darkened bedroom all at once, and then over and over again.
. She asks Dean if he’s seen it.
“I don’t know about that, Cas.” He thinks briefly about his previous experiences with hell. This hell is worse.
“So? It’s all I can do to tolerate the godforsaken misery porn you’re watching constantly.”
“Sammy’s with her now. Here, you want a beer?” He held out an unopened bottle.
Dean picks up his drink. “Thanksgiving was a shitshow. I’d be surprised if she invites us at all, actually.”
“They get very creative,” Crowley said. “They come up with a new way to kill you, every time. I have to admit, even
That wasn’t how Cas was supposed to operate. It wasn’t how he was designed—so no wonder, no wonder things went shitside. What Dean did to him was unspeakable and wrong. It was like raising an animal in captivity and then letting it loose in the wild for other beasts to tear apart.
“No, that’s—that’s not good enough.” He seemed to look past Cas. “It’s like I’m standing outside myself, watching myself say things. And I don’t know who this is. I can’t blame Chuck, either. It’s me.” He catches Cas’s gaze and then says: “I lied to myself. I lied when I said I could lose you again.”
Dean rubs his hand along Cas’s shoulders. Slides his thumb to the back of his neck. “What about you?”
“What did Jack say?”
“Not yet,” she says, smiling. “But I know he’s around.”
“Don’t bring Jack into this. This has nothing to do with Jack.”
“Who the hell is Jack?” Anna asked.
“I led him into a trap. I led us both into a trap, but … I left Cas no choice but to play the only card he had left.” He’s gasping now. “And you know what that card was?”
Cas cleared his throat. “As for other parental figures, well. You’ve got the leader of your garrison, I suppose. Not much of a parent. And our father was, well, this distant, abstract concept.” He looked up. “There’s a piece missing from us, Dean. It’s why angels are the way we are.”
But Dean doesn’t seem to give a thought to any of that. He’s already up from the bench, handing off his pie to a family passing by. “No, there’s nothing wrong with the pie,” he’s telling them. “It’s fantastic. Me and my brother—we just overestimated ourselves. Here, help yourselves.”
He touches Cas’s face. “I didn’t hurt you, did I?”
Sam sits there, his face lined with deep contempt. When he speaks, his voice is quiet.
(Before Sam had gone to college, Dean hadn’t heard of Stanford. Didn’t know what the hell it was. So he went to the library to look it up on the internet. There he discovered that it was being attended by none other than Chelsea Clinton. That’s right.
he did and is somehow already here, and thriving, while Dean’s wandering around like a dickshit chump with a hangover. And also— “How are you so big? When we rescued you, you were, like, nine.”
“Because she deserves someone who can give her kids. The family, the house, the whole shebang.” He pauses. “It’s what we were fighting about that time you walked in on us having it out in the kitchen.”
At some point, Dean takes his hand away, catches Cas’s hand and holds it over his head. They continue to move together.
“No, Dean.” Sam sits next to him on the bed and puts his arms around Dean without hesitating. “It isn’t your fault.”
“I don’t decide how time in heaven moves, Dean.”
At the center of everything is a stately neoclassical-looking white building with steps and Doric columns. Its plaque reads
“Have you learned how to sign ‘you complete me’ yet?”
“Is that sarcasm?” Cas said. “Or are you just really that unself-aware?”
He misses human emotions. At first he couldn’t understand them—the extremes of anger and sadness and despair. And desire. What an awful way to live! But when he let himself feel those things, he finally understood that the extremes meant something mattered to you. And that it was okay to let things matter, to invest yourself.
“Doing nothing is … actually pretty interesting,” he says. “Doing nothing is doing something.” They’re standing in the main room with the pool table, which is uncharacteristically empty.
At the beginning of February, he takes Sam’s advice and signs up for a dating website. Puts together a little profile. Lists his occupation as “private investigator.” Calls himself “WolverDean.” There’s such a laundry list of options to choose from—men seeking women, men seeking men, men seeking men and women, men seeking “other” … what the hell could that mean? Men seeking rugarus? Too bad there’s not an option for men seeking angels.
“When?”
. He’d never believed such a thing was possible—of course he hadn’t.
“You know, I still don’t know why you felt the way you did about Jack.” He rises from the chair. “And frankly, I don’t care. I’m done trying to figure it out. For a while I thought maybe it had to do with me—that Jack reminded you of the fact that you got saddled with me when we were kids, and I pretty much stole your childhood.”
Her gaze met his. She seemed both disbelieving and terribly sincere.
“Thank you.”
“I told Jack it was not the most effective tactic.”
Sam looks at him. Dean doesn’t look back.
Mary and John share a large cabin-style home at the edge of a lake. When Dean visits, he’s struck by how it’s very much just like his parents to live in such a place—and also very not like them at all. It’s rustic and crunchy, like something a couple of Vermont hippies would spend their entire life-savings to buy, putting in solar panels and a well-tended greenhouse. And his parents are not Vermont hippies.
Dean traces Cas’s wrist with his thumb.
“You don’t remember. You know why you don’t remember? Naomi. She tampered with all of us at one point or another. She erased us, things we did, people we met. Things we shared. Things we … had in common.” He gripped Malachi’s shoulders harder. “Like us, she was just following orders. But the program she ran turned us into something we weren’t.” He glanced at Bartholomew. “You know because you were part of it. But maybe
“John,” Mary says, her voice straining against impatience. “He really has to go.”
“As horrible as it sounds, it’s a good thing to know,” the kid says. “And you know, it’s actually not that hard? I guess it’s a lot easier to pick up languages when you’re dead. At least that’s what the old people tell me. I guess you can learn in an hour what would take like a year on earth. And Enochian is essential to being able to travel widely in heaven. They say it’s our … lingua franca?”
“And bagels really confused him. I’ll never forget that. He kept wanting to know who the hell was making off with the center of the sandwich rolls.”
, he wishes he’d said.
“I’ve only slept with one person, and she stabbed me.”
Dean watched Cas scramble for the pieces of the glass. “You’re losing your mojo again,” he said. He turned back to shuffling a deck of cards. “We’ll have to cut you off. Maybe it’s time to think about Python.”
“Cas—”
Cas takes the flier. “I live with them. In a house. But you don’t have to take classes. I’ll teach you.”
Metatron continued. “No one gets to do what we did and walk away for free. All the years of treachery, of douchebaggery, of double-crossing. The bill has come due, and we’re paying it.”
"You'll always have that."
He looked up at her, and her face looked so sad that he wished he could just touch her to take that sadness away. “Hannah.
His eyes watered, he shook his head. Mom was back.
. All of you.”
But he doesn’t remember the finer details. Doesn’t want to. Doesn’t want to put himself back in that place where he had the realization that the entire thing was a dream—because it’s the same place where angels tore down the walls each night to stab him, flay him, burn him alive.
Jack’s stare intensifies as he studies Cas. “You really don’t remember.” He sits down again. “Cas, I tried. For weeks. But even I didn't have much control over the Empty, especially since your deal with it was so sound. I’m
“So this is all just some fucked-up dream?” Malachi said. “And we’re
“When? Now?”
Dean takes his hand. “I have time.”
Jack holds out his hands. Shrugs.
He does, leaning back as well. “Jack did most of the concept. He’s very devoted to making this place what it always should have been, and he loves details.”
The realization makes him ache. It’s what he fought for, and it’s right. But it still pains him.
“We’re fucking strangers to her, Cas. Me and Sammy. To our mom. And I can’t—I can’t fix that. For him
During these nights they’d sometimes lie awake and share their own memories—funny things about Cas. Sometimes they’d even laugh. “Forget about the bees,” Sam said. “Remember the time he showed up looking like Matisyahu?”
As if Cas hears him—
you blow up?”
But they soon discovered that they couldn’t wake up. Simply knowing about the dream didn’t rouse them from sleep. And Cas knew that the way he got out last time was through Jack—that Jack had been strong enough to wake him.
The boy stands, as if sensing he can better explain things if he’s upright. “So you can talk to anyone? Say you want to get outside this part of heaven, talk to a ninth-century Mayan. You can’t do that with English. But if enough people speak Enochian …”
Dean pulled away then, and Cas had to admit he was relieved because he hadn’t, in that moment, known how it was going to end. And Dean was drunk—who knew if he’d remember anything the next day.
“When you died, Jack. When you died, we moved heaven and earth to get you back.
“He’s already here,” Jack continues. “He’s visited with Bobby, with his parents, with Jo and Ellen.”
After they met on the street that awful morning (how the sun could still be shining while all their people were gone Sam didn’t know, but he thought it spoke volumes about Chuck’s sick sense of humor), they drove aimlessly at first, from one place to another. To the town. To the countryside. They waited for Chuck to return their call, and he took his sweet goddamn time.
"So the grieving 9/11 widow just wanted to be reunited with her husband. Yeah, okay. Whatever you say."
Other people had so many fucking pictures. They even took pictures of their kids taking
Sam cleared his throat. “Well,
“Different. Yeah, I’ve heard.” He leans against the wooden porch beam beside him. “I thought that meant it would move faster. Not slower. The expression is ‘time flies when you’re having fun,’ Jack. Not the opposite. Time moves slow in hell, not heaven. So there’s one for the suggestions box. As you keep improving this place.”
“Grow up,” Metatron said. “You rebelled. You full-on rebelled, Anna dear. And you killed Uriel.”
“Last time you were here, this place was the Stanford Prison Experiment,” Metatron explained. “Now it’s the fucking New Mexico State Penitentiary riot. And we’re Cellblock Four. And you, Castiel, are the king of the snitches. Ergo, we are fucked.”
“I’m fine,” he calls out. “Sleeping.”
“He needs you, Cas. When I had to tell Jack—” His voice catches. He remembers that morning on the street, when he had to face Sam and Jack and tell them he'd failed to keep Cas alive. “I couldn’t—I couldn’t even look him in the face …”
Everyone looks at him blankly. Then Cas remembers something. “Oh, that’s right. She dies in the end.”
Dean slides closer to him on the bench. Puts one hand on his shoulder and squeezes.
Dean blinks.
“Other things to do, I know.”
And he’s out of bed and tripping over himself and tangled in the sheets and rushing toward the door—all while thinking
“Hunting accident,” he says, trying to ignore the fact that his chest is seizing up again. “It was very sudden.” He looks through the windshield, toward the greenness of the hills. “But he’s—he’s in a better place now. And I—I was with him. In the end. I got to be with him. He didn’t die alone.”
But he couldn’t bring himself to.
“We saw Anna on the way,” Daniel says, “and asked if she wanted to come with us, but she said she didn’t want to be a third wheel. But what’s wrong with a third wheel?”
that way. It doesn’t exist anymore. But when it did, it broke the spirits of angels and demons so they would give up and submit to its power, sleeping forever while they did so. And it did that by using a lot of … coercion tactics.”
And then: embarrassment.
“Sure. And Metatron is wrong, by the way. You don’t need flowers or an orchestra. Just go to the dude. He’s a chill dude. But … you want me to wing you down there? I’ve recovered enough to do that, and it’ll save you time. You see my wings—almost back to full span, eh? I promise nothing'll go wrong.”
Cas straightened. Shrugged. “The joke is somewhat limited in scope. I never thought it would last this long.”
a kid, Dean. Jack was our kid. And Cas’s. He was smart and funny. And considerate. And then one day he just wasn’t there anymore. And I know he’s not technically dead, but—” He pauses. “He died before. And I would tell myself every day, ‘I can’t lose this kid again. I just
He wishes he could tell all this to the other angels tending him. More to the point, he wishes he could pull himself into a sitting position and say to them in Enochian,
Daniel just looks at him and shrugs, sheepishly. “I think he may be right. She’s got a crush.”
“Oh yeah, I remember that,” Sam said. “That was weird.”
But to his credit, he didn’t say these things. (Thank God he didn’t say them—he’s glad now that he held back, that he wasn’t
When he was alive, he dealt with his failure by drinking until he blacked out, or by driving to the middle of nowhere and howling his pain to some forest or empty road. But now that he’s no longer alive, he has no recourse. All he has is time to think about his failures. About the fact that the angel was a gift—a gift he didn’t appreciate.
When Miracle sees both of them together, he seems confused. He heads toward Sam—and then he changes his mind. Goes to Dean instead, and drops the stick in front of him.
“Shh, Cas. Just sleep,” Jack says.
Dean looks around. So that’s what Bobby meant when he said
“What do you feel you need?” She leans forward.
“You two share a history. You wouldn’t have to explain the family business. Or tell her some stupid cover story about hunting trips. And, well, she’s cute as hell. Well—I really thought, you know.” He tilts his head back. “I just don’t want to see you make the same mistakes I did.”
Dean pulled up to the liquor store and parked. Usually Sam went with him, but this time he didn’t even take off his seatbelt. He told Dean he didn’t want anything.
She smiles sadly and takes his hand. “Not exactly the most outgoing person.”
“Maybe. It’s also possible the widow missed her husband. Perhaps when the moment came, she was relieved.”
“This universe, and the universes beyond it, is about balance,” Jack says. “The problems that caused the upheaval of the last ten years resulted directly from a series power grabs that upset order, many of them originating with Chuck. Worse, this imbalance destroyed the sacredness of choice, with demons refusing to give people any sort of choice when possessing them, and angels forcing humans into impossible decisions that defeated the purpose of free will entirely. My job is to address that problem.”
Dean thinks back to that moment—that awful moment. His chest seizes. “I love you, Cas.” He takes a deep, trembling breath. “I’m so sorry I couldn’t say it. When I needed to. When you … you were dying. When you were murdered in front of me. For me.”
He knows now that he’s still in the Empty, having some fucked-up dream. Instead of being tormented by the people he betrayed and the causes he failed, he’s now being given some sappy vision of forgiveness and reconciliation, just so he can suffer additional anguish when it all gets snatched away. He never came back. He’s not seen Jack since their last day on earth together. All of this—this angel rehab, these trips with Jack—it’s all just bullshit, a projection on his part, a hackneyed dream fueled by all the time he spent on earth watching terrible daytime TV.
Yeah. A lot about him is “delayed.”
Whether Sam knew it had to do with love? Well. Sam wasn’t stupid; he’d probably filled in the blanks. And for that reason, Dean was grateful in that moment to Sam—grateful he stepped up and said what Dean couldn’t.
He turns around.
“It’s taking advantage of us,” Anna said, “by linking our minds together. In reality, there could be thousands of groups of angels and demons just like us, sharing dreams based on what they did before they died. All reinforcing each other’s visions. Groups kept small enough to prevent people from having conflicting experiences. We
“It’s okay.”
“And I can just go there and look up anyone? I mean, anything?”
“I’m telling you, I already know it,” Cas said as he gathered up the pieces. “Angels know all human languages, ancient and modern. That includes programming languages. Even those that don’t yet exist.”
Jack grabs his wrist. “Cas, look at me.”
He takes a breath and just says it: “I just imagined this grand reunion between you two. The happiest of all surprises. The reunion you both deserved. Romantic, I guess? Well, it was so stupid of me. Stupid and sentimental.”
Through his tears, Sam focuses on Cas’s eyes. “You need to give yourself permission to believe what he said. When you do that, you’ll find your way back to us.”
“No regular angel is automatically a killer, Anna. We aren’t built that way. But we can be programmed.”
He’s never worked out what his death must have looked like through Dean’s eyes. In the moment that the Empty took him, Cas was at peace, happy to make the sacrifice. Even when he got to the Empty—to the “snitch ward,” as Metatron called it—he remained at peace. And that peace—coupled with how Dean had taught him to care about the world—allowed him to survive. To care about the angels he was imprisoned with.
Sam’s face relaxes, like he could almost smile. “Thanks, Dean. I’m really glad we’re on the same page about this.”
“I’ve been here for weeks,” Dean continues. “I thought you’d never show. I thought you were part of the sand and the stones or something and that I’d never see you again. Christ, Jack. That really sucked.”
“That’s a movie, Dean. A vaccine is at least a year away, if not more.”
“Probably not. But then again, they should have known better when they built their bunker in the middle of nowhere, Kansas. Out here, ‘gun control’ means figuring out how to get better aim.”
And then:
confirmed active vampire nest in the country. The mating habits of the Chupacabra. A longstanding record of their cases—solved, unsolved, received but not-yet-opened. The question-mark cases—things they’d read in the news but hadn’t had the time to explore.
“You’ve spoken to them?”
Thing is, he’s been noticing people. Guys. When he’s walking around town or going to the mall or … whatever. Guys whose shoulders he admires. Guys with nice pecs. Guys whose postures and profiles remind him of Cas. And okay, he’ll just say it: guys with nice asses.
And with a touch to the forehead, he’s out.
, Cas thinks. He marvels at the idea. (
“You just
“What are you talking about?”
“He—he hates suffering. Especially since … he knows what it’s like.”
He sighed. “Cas hated himself for what he did to you, Claire. You and your family—you were his biggest regret.”
And it just goes on like that, giving a dumb list of all Cas’s garrisons and the bullshit campaigns they undertook. “This is bullshit,” he says out loud.
“It would be very weird for you to break all these big rules because breaking them was the right thing to do, while not breaking a fairly minor one because … well, who knows your reasons.”
“We pay it nightly,” Gadreel said. “Every night they break in.”
Which could have been days ago. Maybe weeks. Or maybe hours. Bobby wasn’t kidding when he said that time moves differently here. Other things that also move differently: People. Reality. Scenery. Thoughts. Dean knows he’s not trapped in a memory, but he’s not quite sure how to describe heaven in ordinary human terms. It feels both familiar and odd, like a recurring dream you’ve had your whole life, but less tenuous. More material. More
. I won’t intervene in their lives, Cas. I won’t take away their agency, their choices. That’s what Chuck did, and it was wrong.”
Dean hit pause and took out the earbuds. Then he put them back in, pressed play again, and listened to the song all the way through. When it was finished, two fat tears rolled down his cheeks.
Was this really what he deserved? Probably, Cas thought. He knew he’d done some good—at least he’d
“The way I always fail him.” He lets go of the jacket so that it rests in his lap. “If only he’d just let Billie take us both. Cas could have found a way back then.”
Sam has a lot of regrets, but his biggest one is not telling Cas what he needed to say the most. He wishes he had that moment back. He wishes he’d crossed the room right then, closing the space between them to lean over and put his arms around Cas.
Jack goes quiet. Then he peers at Cas again. “I’m sorry, Cas. You should never have been there. No one should have been there, not even demons. But you’re the one who stopped it, Cas. Not me.
Cas takes one arm and wraps it around Dean’s shoulder. Dean shifts so that Cas's chin is now resting on the top of his head. “Oh, Dean,” he sighs. “I never meant to hurt you like this. I never imagined. But I should have. The way you feel things, the way you take on all the pain of the world. Your suffering was so great. Jack and I—we knew we had to step in.”
“Sam,” he begins.
Seriously.
“I don’t know,” he sighed. “He could be dead.” The thought had long ago occurred to him—that Jack and Sam and Dean were all dead, that Chuck had spirited away their entire world. “Or depowered. Or … it could be that the Empty is more overwhelming now. It has more of us than it ever did before.”
“No? That’s a shame.”
“I’ve been driving around for weeks! A month, at least.”
Seven heads swivel in his direction. He sees not just Metatron and Gadreel but also Tyrus, Abner, and … Gabriel? They’re seated around a table. Mirabel and Ambriel are a few feet away on a couple of cushioned chairs. Both Gadreel and Tyrus spring to their feet, but Tyrus gets to him first, pushing his wheelchair into the room and toward the table. Cas tries saying he doesn’t need the help, but his voice is drowned out by the inquiries about how he’s feeling.
Cas starts laughing, he can’t help it. It feels better to laugh—better than it does to cry. And that’s the point, he supposes. To pretend, just for a moment, that everything is all right.
“Then we can all communicate. Gotcha.” Dean doesn’t know if he really wants to communicate all that much with ancient Sumerians. Or twelfth-century Vikings. (Actually … twelfth-century Vikings might be cool.)
“No, this is your room,” Dean said amid Cas’s protests. “It’s always been your room. Other people just use it when you’re not around.” He opened the door to the room and flicked on the light, gesturing to the space.
Dean took a swig of beer and shrugged. “Hopefully on a beer run. But maybe not. Every now and then he pisses off and goes back up to heaven. Just to check in with mission control. Which I think is a shitty idea, don’t get me wrong. Heaven does not have a lot going for it these days.”
He appreciates her confidence in his abilities—a stint at Stanford undergrad does not a “big data expert” make—and he should thank her. Honestly. But instead, he decides to take another off-ramp. “Dean,” he says, sitting up in his chair to glance over at his brother. “You finally got it—your reason to learn how to code.”
“Nothing.” He sits back on the sofa, willing his tears to dry.
Jack sighs through his nose. “I can’t find him.”
“Oh yeah, I know what you mean. He’s got a big ol' man-crush, we know. It’s kind of a punchline. What can I say, I make friends everywhere I go.”
Jack wasn’t alive long enough to have these kinds of regrets.
“I’ve been praying my ass off!”
Cas keeps his hand on Sam’s arm. “It was complicated, but let’s just say that Jack found a way.”
“He needs to be with Mom right now.”
“No.”
“Dean, what is this—what are you talking about?”
“Because—” He starts to speak but nothing comes. He’s breathing harder all of a sudden—in anticipation of either a panic attack or an ugly crying jag, he can’t decide. “Because I’m—”
“It's more than that, Dean. I can't explain it now, not in a way that will do it justice. There are things—things on the other side now … and those things had to be Jack's focus.”
Crowley opened his mouth as if to say something. Then he closed his eyes and shook his head.
Dean sobs into Sam’s shoulder, the noise muffled by Sam’s shirt. He sobs and sobs and sobs, and Sam says nothing. Just holds him, crying with him.
Mary folds her hands and leans forward.
“I’ll let him get settled in first. Time to get adjusted.”
“Our what?”
feel happiness. At all.
“Oh,” he says, pulling up his chair and getting a piece of paper out from behind the desk. “
She crosses the room, bends down, and puts her arms around him. Tight. Gives him a quick but resolute kiss on the cheek. “Thank you, Castiel,” she says as she pulls away slightly, looking him in the eyes, her arms still loosely around him.
Sam recovers and makes eye contact with Dean again. “Well, that’s my point, Dean. I mean, I think we should just give ourselves a break. Stop looking for cases. Just … be nice to ourselves, for once. And not do anything we don’t feel like doing.”
“We both tried sending you signs,” Cas says. He laughs lightly. “I told Jack that wasn’t going to work.”
. It should be enough to bring him back from wherever the fuck he is. But in all those fucking books. On the entire internet. In whatever language—Sammy, I’ve—I’ve translated the word
While Dean was onto cutting the apples into some slices not too thin or two thick. While he did that Gabriel mixed the flour and salt and then cut in the butter. He moved it to Dean then who began mixing a little bit of water until it formed a ball. While he was doing that Gabriel mixed the sugars, spices, lemon juice, egg white, and a little bit of butter and flour as well, tossing it in the already peeled and sliced apples.
It was times like this that he missed his brothers, once upon a time he could remember when Michael was an older brother in a similar way to Dean. He loved and cared for every angel and they were a family. Michael was as much an older brother to humans as he was to the angels, that had been before Lucifer had rebelled. Michael had never been the same after that.
“My apologies for coming to your home unannounced and uninvited, but there is something that I must ask you.”

“But... why can I see your wings now?”
“Run as much as you want, little rabbit, you won’t escape.” Castiel glared keeping his arms on Dean, “you can run yourself ragged and then I’ll take you home so you can rest.”
“You mean we, you’re not alone here Cas.”
“No chance, no way-”
“Yes Gabriel?” Sam asked immediately straightening up. Gabriel never called him Sam.
Castiel growled out and his hands squeezed Dean’s arms right above his elbows, pinning his arms to his
“Sam…he took your death as my fault.”
This version of Castiel seemed a bit more attuned to human customs so if he did come through a door it would be the front door. Back door it was. Dean hurried to the door, slipping out the French doors easily, the patio was more of a deck with a single set of stairs going down, stairs that Dean didn’t even bother with, instead he jumped landing a few feet down and took off running.
“You need me to clean your clothes?” Castiel sounds affronted and Dean rolls his eyes.
Dean sighed a bit gladly accepting the offered bite of apple pie from Castiel who was sat on his lap. At the table Sam was sitting with Gabriel also in his lap, the two were eating a cake that was some tropical one that honestly made Dean think of a pina coloda or something, and Dean rolled his eyes. Considering all the flak that Sam gave Dean for his ‘unhealthy’ eating habits you’d think he would get on Gabriel even more for the fact he ate only desserts and ate easily twice as much as Dean. Being an archangel instead of a human notwithstanding.
“Cas no!” He looked up seeing Dean now instead, his Dean, he was panting and crying. “Why’d you do it Cas? Why’d you kill me?!”
- - - - -
“Dean that time you made me homemade pie so I could talk to the other kids about homemade treats, when you taught me how to ride that old blue bike you stole from the skating rink, the time you grabbed me and took me to the bowling alley even though dad told you to stay in the hotel room were all more happy memories.” He assured and Dean remembered all those, but had never thought they meant so much to Sam. “Listen Dean, I know I went to college and didn't contact you, but it wasn't because I didn't care about you, we both wanted a home and I couldn't see you ever being happy in a 'apple pie life' not yet. I was sure that you did want the same thing as I did, but that you weren't ready. I would be there when you were.” He then started laughing and Dean glared at him.
“Dean, if not for even us then for the people you are trying to save.”
“I love you to Dean, so very much.”
They set up a archway under a old oak tree setting up, they would not have thought anyone would have come but instead they found themselves surrounded. Dean and Sam looked around wondering what was going on, jumping when a young man came up, looking about twenty six, twenty seven, maybe twenty eight with a man that was obviously his father came up and hugged Sam and Dean. That kid from that bug cursed development.
He had not known why he trusted her, maybe it was her blonde hair that was the exact shade of his mother's. He had taken it and written it down once he found it, the recipe was called Orchid Fairy's Apple Pie. He had cringed at the pictures of fairies dressed in flower going from lilac to a lavender color but had read the recipe it seemed a lot easier to follow so had ripped out the spiral he had been taking notes on any possible ghosts for a hunt as he was old enough that John had started taking him on hunts, leaving Sammy behind at Bobby's.
However he was saved when they walked past a pet shop and Castiel had stopped looking over there. “Pet shop? You like animals Cas?” Dean asked and there had been instances that gave it away but never so much that he would have to stop and stare into the window.
“I-I…” Dean frowned at Sam, giving him a glare; both knew how Castiel felt about his crazy god trip.
“Die?” He questioned and Dean groaned.
Leaning down Castiel kissed his mate's forehead humming lightly to him.
“Sam?”
“Yes Dean.”
“I know baby, I'll miss you to.” Dean promised kissing his forehead, “I'll make sure that the kids are over for dinner.” Dean winked at him with a grin, despite their advanced age Castiel grinned. Castiel could have kept his vessel the exact same as when Jimmy Novak agreed to give him his body like Gabriel did for his own vessel. Until he found Sam anyway. They both chose to allow their vessels to age along with their husbands.
“That's it?” Dean asked not able to hold back his shock. “You can't be serious.”
“So what do you want to go to college Violet?” Sam asked with a grin as she looked up at him and bit her lip. “Honey?”
“At least forty years ago? Maybe a bit longer.” He answered chuckling, “I have homes all over the place; you don't hang out on Earth this long and not have a few homes at least.” Gabriel chuckled and smiled at them. “So we can at least hang out here till you know where you want to go for another hunt. There are three bedrooms-but I turned the middle sized one into a library a good two decades ago.” He added with a hum and shrugged, “but I also have a living room with a new TV just a year or two ago, kitchen and dining room along with a master bath and a normal bathroom to.” He added and grinned at the sparkly hazel eyes.
“Crowley. The king of hell. Caring about a catholic thing?” Dean was mocking him but he just smiled.
But that voice. Sam knew that voice, his magic instantly shot out and felt the vibrating grace that he knew. Even though he had lost his lover before his powers were trained by Rowena it still knew him. This was his Gabriel.
He began thinking more and more about that time, about the thing that caused him the most shame. But perhaps that was the key, that maybe that other version of himself may do just that. If he had stayed that way than Dean would be in a pocket dimension. It was something he had thought about before, even before he viewed Dean as his best friend and the one who showed him so much. Of course, then it had been just to better view and study him but later…later he wanted somewhere to keep Dean safe and protected and even more shameful he wanted to keep Dean for himself and only himself.
“Don't get all protective Gabe, it's just that it is my little brother.” He explained and Castiel looked up from where he had been laying against Dean's shoulder, enjoying his head being rubbed like a cat.
“You’re probably hungry. I know that you haven’t been eating enough lately.” Dean frowned, not happy with the reminder that Castiel had, for who really knows how long, gone ‘invisible girl’ and spied on them for who knows how long. Castiel stood from Dean leaving the hunter to feel a slight chill. “Enjoy exploring our nest,” Castiel added having Dean blink confused as the angel, or whatever he was now, flitted away and disappeared.
“Dean-y-buh-bean-y knows that you can't devote yourself to saving people only. Of course too much is just horrid but you need to take care of yourself to.”
It was moments later that Gabriel was panting his wings flapping helplessly begging to be taken as Sam got him ready, working him open slowly and teasingly. Kissing along his head and down him as he did. “Sam please! Please Sam! My mate! Take me now!” Gabriel begged and Sam chuckled, he didn't know if he wanted to just give into the pretty begging or make him beg more.
“Yeah, Sam to.” Gabriel said jovially but Castiel knew his older brother was worried for his own mate. If running a cafe would be what Sam would want.
“I think whoever cast it wanted us to hear the two of you say that you love us.” He answered holding Sam close as he flinched away. “And you know what Samsquatch?”
“So something is going on here?” Sam questioned doing his best to be able to look out the window, he hated being in the back seat and grunted, everything looked normal. Then again usually it looked just...normal. Everything looked normal and it seldom was.
The hunters didn’t know what they should be expecting but underneath the arch they were made to sit, their lovers sitting right across from them. “Okay Dean, you take Sam’s left wrist with your right hand and put it in mine,” Gabriel explained offering up his hand.
“True, I better make sure that you eat a substantial dinner before sexy times from now on, my sweet human.” He cooed and then got a thoughtful look on his face, “or I guess I should say meal, because why should sexy times be limited to just night? Right sugar cube?” He cooed and it ended up with Sam blushing.
“Doesn't mean he won't banish you to a sleep on the couch.” Dean mused getting to the car and opening the door. Looking up at Gabriel over the roof, Sam already sitting up front. He mouthed the word 'apologize' over the maroon metal.
“How are you…what are you?” Sam questioned, he knew that Dean wasn’t human, he couldn’t be human and still be alive.
“Your universe is not the first universe he came to.” There was a sigh, “he took something of mine; I want back what he stole.” There were the sounds of footsteps and then the door shutting.
“Love you to, bitch.” Dean chuckled pulling Sam down to him for a hug.
He started to run but was stopped as Castiel suddenly was there, he knew the way that it happened, had seen it dozens of times before and he always hated it. But his Castiel had always shown up behind him. And Dean always hated it, telling him repeatedly not to do it, the sudden feeling of not being alone that tripped his hunter-toned instincts and then seeing Castiel there and going from possible danger to alley. He hated this more.
“Oh, my adored,” he sighed but the smile he gave him was indulgent and he moved his hand from Dean’s face to kiss two of his fingers and moved those fingers to Dean’s lips. “like I’ve told you, I will always watch over you. Forever.” He smiled gently, “because I love you,” Dean groaned causing the angel turned god to frown, “something wrong?”
“I believe I have found something.” Castiel was holding a paper and looking at it confused, “I…I think it’s Dean’s.” The other Castiel ripped the paper from him but he was so shocked that he didn’t fight or even really react.
“So we must wait, till we hear what they want us to hear.”
“The hell man?!” He questioned seeing where he was, it was a simple enough home, he was in the kitchen. “Where are we?”
“How could I not know it then? Was it because it came so late in life?” He asked and Gabriel raised a single brow and Sam knew what he was asking and answered before Gabriel had a chance to ask the question. “I was in my early twenties, from the few times I've heard it people claimed to be able to do it since twelve or thirteen.” Sam explained and Gabriel looked just a little bit more confused.
“Boyfriends...” Dean frowned pulling away from the beige monstrosity that Castiel cared so much for and turned to him.
“Why must you hunters be so obsessed with killing things?”
(See the end of the chapter for
It had been Gabriel’s idea to combine a wedding and bonding ceremony and have it been a double wedding at that. Dean wasn’t opposed to the idea, Castiel was the only one he could see himself marrying, enough that he bought a pair of rings, they just spoke to him and that was before he had even confessed his feelings and worried that Castiel wouldn’t want him but it spoke to him and it wasn’t like Dean didn’t hurt himself all the time.
“It's simple, just a bit of our grace and you two can control your powers temporarily, and by then you can be used to meditation to make it work.” Gabriel explained and Sam relaxed but then frowned.
The effects were immediate, Dean blinking his eyes open and looking up at Castiel. His green eyes were bleary with sleep and he looked like he was not awake, instead stuck between sleep and wakefulness. “Oh Cas, hey sunshine.” Dean yawned, “it’s you, right?”
“The food is not poisoned.”
“Dean?!”
“Sable cookies.” Rosalie smiled some were checkered a vanilla and chocolate while others were plain chocolate or vanilla the chocolate being in the shape of stars and the vanilla in a fluted circle. “These are one of my favorite of her cookies.” She smiled taking a checkered one for her own as Kristabella poured the tea in the tea cups.
“Great,” he groaned and Sam looked back.
“What?” Sam questioned and looked over at Castiel who was watching Dean like the hunter had slapped him.
“So, you came to our bunker and just helped yourself?” Dean glared and the demon version of him just started laughing.
“Gabriel?” He asked and looked to Gabriel who was looking oddly serious. He hadn't seen him look like that since he accidentally ran a comet into the earth and his other brothers and sisters were yelling at him and only Gabriel had gotten in between them and him, yelling at them to calm down as Castiel didn't mean to do it.
“I will try pies and see which is my favorite.” Sam couldn't muster a smile for hearing that from Castiel. Maybe later he'd make it up to him by helping Castiel make Dean a apple pie, he always asks people to pick him up a pie and they never do; maybe Castiel can make him one.
He didn’t even miss his sight, truth be told, it only made his innate magic that he was born with all the stronger. Thanks to Rowena he had learned and strengthen his natural talents.
He didn't for several reasons; one was that the bond, though at the time Dean consented to it and clung to him; they not only struck up a friendship but also just might be love but he didn't remember any of that, it would open his mind and emotions to Castiel which the angel knew that Dean was uncomfortable with his own emotions, and just the fact now that Dean had a physical body and is not a soul entwining with grace instead of a body pressed against a vessel.
Dean wearing a pair of black jeans,a black tee and a leather jacket with a pair of aviators covering the green eyes that Castiel loved so much with a come hither smirk.
He went to the cage holding the three guinea pigs, massaging some coconut oil into Bella and trimmed Amara's long fur. He made sure to pick up Grace so that she wouldn't feel left out and talked to all of them. Guinea pigs had to be talked to or could become sick or even die from loneliness, even with the three of them still he wanted to be careful. He did a quick check and seeing that they are all okay he then moved to Buddy. He knew that Gabriel would be by in the afternoon but still Castiel changed out the water, made sure he was adequately fed, take him for a walk and then make sure that he was healthy the same way he made sure the girls were.
“I guess it wouldn't hurt us to not actively look till the day after tomorrow.” Sam agreed, “we should learn how this will effect us as well as Gabe and Cas.”
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Sam took another step glaring and Castiel took another step up, his wing though invisible to the two mortals had wrapped around Dean.
“Calm down there.” Gabriel started up and Dean turned on him. While the trickster was a funny guy and they were similar enough that they got along pretty well. But it didn't change the fact that his relationship with Gabriel wasn't nearly as important-if he was a chick he'd even say 'precious'-to him as his relationship with Castiel was.
“I'm not saying you can't Gabe, just I can't really imagine you sitting somewhere to read.” He explained and Gabriel pouted before slipping his arm through Sam's and tugging him away. “Hey!”
He wanted to pray to Castiel, but he couldn’t take the risk that the scarred Castiel would hear.
“Believe me Sugar Cube, I understand what can drive someone to leave their family more then anyone.” Gabriel assured, “the one thing though was I was running from something but you don't strike me as that. No. My moose was running to something. Only thing I don't know is what were you running to?” He asked and Sam gave him a half smile and shrugged.
This is by far the longest chapter of this story so far, I liked writing it a lot to.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don't know Cas,” Dean frowned spinning the globe in the library they were visiting. Not for research, at least not the kind he was used to, but to look for a place to go on a honeymoon.
“Apple pie.”
“I don't know, but my Sugar Cube should be able to sense us.” Gabriel added and the two quickly flew over to their hunters who were asleep in a hotel room. They didn't react at all and they silently watched them sleep not knowing what to do.
“Dude? What the hell?” Dean asked and finally pull his arm out of Sam's hand when he got him through the dining room and into the kitchen two rooms away from the angels. “Bitch.” He growled out before pausing thinking about it and gasped, “did Gabriel do something to you?” He demanded but Sam held his arms up shaking his head and Dean relaxed slightly.
Not this, not knowing where he was, if he was alive or not and fearing that he wasn’t, because surly if Dean was, he would pray to him. Still knowing, despite his fears, that he would not give up, not till he had a body.
- - - - -
“Love, it's okay, you can name him.” Gabriel assured and Sam glared at him, taking it as a challenge. Of course, the famous Winchester stubbornness. He loved it though, even when it was turned on him.
“You know what I mean man, come on, why won’t you take me back?” Castiel hadn’t spoken of how he had lost his love and began searching for him. Nor about how he blamed Sam for Dean dying, even if he could never look at his hands and not see the things that took his Dean away.
His hazel eyes sliding over to Dean and Castiel he amended that thought, maybe it would be bad, at least he was here to protect them when they were unable to protect themselves.

Wouldn’t think of any of it.
Violet 13, Jacob 11
“There’s something going on here.” That was Gabriel’s voice. He took a deep breath to ignore it and was about to leave when he heard it then.
“I knew it,” he shook his head, “with one sibling having such power it is rare the other doesn't, especially if they are first born.”
“Sure.”
“Dude if you can undo the taut-line hitch and the double fisherman’s knot I’ll personally give you a ride back to where I got you, hell to anywhere you want to go.” The man promised and Dean gritted his teeth. Fuck. He thought he was the only one who ever thought of combining those two knots. He wasn’t getting out of this one without making his fingers bleed at best. “But there’s no need. I don’t want to hurt you. I just want bait.”
Okay this was long, like nearly, but not quiet, 5k words. I hope you guys like it. This is the au that was made by Sir Catherine. Mine is different backstory but I was inspired so every now and then will write on the Dark Cas AU. I suggest checking out her Tik Tok cosplays of him (same name for Twitter, Ao3 and Tik Tok), it is so good. She’s really good at the cosplays.
He considered, just for a moment, turning back. He could act like he never left, like he just came out because he was going stir crazy surrounded by walls, he wasn’t used to being inside for long periods of time. He wasn’t meant for that, he was meant for the open road and in a car, or outside hunting, not inside for multiple hours never leaving. Maybe that would even get him to take Dean out somewhere, but he could also make it so Dean couldn’t get out, he might even set up alarms or something that would alert him if Dean were to go outside. It was too much of a chance and so he started to run, he had to take the chance.
“I know man, I know you hate it, but it’s chamomile. You need something to help you sleep, I’m having one to.” Dean was going to fight a bit more but Sam continued on, “I couldn’t find you or any trace of you for nearly a week man, I…” he didn’t have to continue as Dean’s face morphed into guilt and he sighed.
Shaking his head to rid of those thoughts he kept quiet and made sure everything was set up and all of Sam's favorite books were safe and secured before giving them his lopsided grin. “Ready to go guys? I got a call about some suspicious stuff going on down in the keys.” He hummed and Sam nodded while Castiel looked better at Dean.
“Come on bud, you know how Violet can do stuff you can't yet in school?”
“Dean, are you okay?” Sam asked when he saw Dean and Castiel landing in the library and Dean nodded.
“I do love you Dean, if only you could see what I see.”
“My apologies, I…Sam is fine.” He promised pulling away and his heart warmed as he saw how worried Dean was for him. “But he is safe as he was when he left your hotel room. And we are in British Columbia, this house has no owners.” Castiel explained and while Dean was looking around obviously confused.
Do you need help?
“Cas is there anywhere we’ve not looked?” Sam was getting antsy; this thing had his brother. This other universe’s version that Dean had taken to calling Scar Cas the bit that Sam had gotten to tell him. He was such an idiot, if he hadn’t given Dean those pills, he might have awakened when that thing came for him and been able to call out for help or even fight him off if only for a bit. Still there had to be something that they could do. Sam was just worried for Dean to have dropped into a mental breakdown.
He then remembered the one place, the first place that was four walls that Dean ever considered home. The place Dean set his roots before Castiel had taken him to their nest. The bunker.
Dean closed his eyes, even if he couldn't see the white-blue silver of Castiel's grace it wrapped around his freckled form, the shining orange-yellow gold of Dean's soul glowed and fought to get out to touch Castiel's grace. It was not till that grace washed over his right shoulder where the scar of his hand was. The two could communicate even if Castiel didn't often take advantage of it.
I couldn't resist something funny at the end here. I hope you guys liked this.
It is so hard to make Dean have a lovey dovey moment, but I can't resist him having some needed TLC.
Sam arrived just a few moments after Castiel had left, growling as he could still feel the monster’s grace-power mix. He must have left just now, and Sam was about to follow when he heard the voice again.
“Get some earthy crunchy people, local grown honey.” Dean agreed and Castiel grinned, although guinea pigs were his favorite animal but he loved to watch the bees and honey.
“Okay where are you guys?” Sam groaned looking around trying to find them, he is just thankful that both are old enough to take their own baths. In the last nine days Sam found himself with a whole new appreciation for all the care Dean had shown him growing up. It was exhausting and he was a adult, true he had two kids instead of one but doing even half of this at four was...yeah. Not to mention the fact then he was a baby.
Sure he had never gripped another soul like that, nor had he ever really talked to any other humans beside the brothers. And even then Sam, though he was a good man and they got along well it was nothing to the bond he had with Dean.
Dean smirked and gave a wink, “heya Cas, glad to see lil ol' me?” He smiled and waved Castiel over to the kitchen, putting a hand on Castiel's lower back. “Come on. You need a drink and to sit down for this.” He explained that as he had Castiel sit at the breakfast nook before getting out a mug and putting on a tea kettle, pulling out a herbal tea. “Pecan or cherry?” He asked as if this was an everyday occurrence.
His mind went back to the little bit of time he had spent watching over the universe where everyone had not just one gender but two, both male or female but alpha, omega, or beta but to be fair all children were betas until they came of age, meaning there were a possibility of six genders, four for adulthood and two for childhood. At the time it had been the one that had deep domestic bliss, it had stopped him because it was something that Dean wanted; something his husband wanted but knew that even if he had he wouldn’t know how to handle. It would be like trying to force a square peg into a round hole, but that Dean all but melted into it, like he was made for it.
- - - - -
- - - - -
Still he walked by kittens that were mewling and bathing their litter-mates, birds tweeting sweetly, and he just couldn't stop smiling. He loved animals, loved them more then he would ever let anyone know. It was the black bunny that looked up at him with big blue eyes that he couldn't help but smile at. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and he couldn't keep the smile off his face.
“I love you to,” it was even more rare but instead of making him feel possessive-angels are naturally possessive over their mates-it only made him happy. Sam glanced from Dean’s shoulder and chuckling held his hand out, Castiel hesitating took the offered hand and Sam pulled them into their brotherly embrace. He patted Dean’s back and Castiel’s as well before moving away from the still embracing lovers.
“No, I suppose not, but such a powerful psychic it is a shame.” Gabriel smiled but then frowned, “but there is only so much we can do.” Gabriel shook his head, “we need a psychic to fight them down, but my last psychic contact had died almost two decades ago.” Gabriel groaned, putting his head in his hands as he collapsed on the bed since the only other seat was the couch which Dean and Castiel were already occupying and didn't want to sit back on the desk and Sam, though he was standing, had claim of the chair.
“It...it's important.” He looked at the tan coat reaching over to place his hand on the coat before sighing and pulling away.
“Hey Sammy,” Dean sighed, “listen man, just listen, I’ve got be quick.”
“D-Dean…”
“Excuse me?” Dean put his hands on his hips in the stance of ‘I’m about ready to destroy you’.
“Elder brother gave you to me, I hope he adopted you, you are so perfect...but plenty of your kind need a home.” He whispered gently stroking as the piggeh made those adorable little squeaking that they did. “You are so perfect...I think I will name you Dean.” He smiled a little bit, as Dean would have gasped if he had the ability to right now. “You'll like Dean, he is more of a rabbit lover but he could not say no to you.” Castiel smiled walking to sit down on the bed that Dean slept in looking around.
“Many things: I once was an angel, I was the perfect solider and commander of my garrison, I fell to do what I believed was needed, I became a warrior, a member of Team Free Will, I became the mate of Dean Winchester.” At this Dean paled and looked away and Castiel gave a chuckle, “come now, my adored, you can’t hide from me; you did not react negatively to see the necklace and ring that I wear around my neck, over my heart,” he looked to the side before taking a deep breath. It was true: he could never forgive himself, but he could repair it. “You can love men just as much as you love women. But what I became was human just as much as angel-comes with being mated to a human as I understand with my limited knowledge of the few of my siblings who have-“
Not that Dean would complain, he normally would but he was too worried that Castiel would stop. He practically preened form the praise his angel rained down on him. “Dean?” It was practically a moan, Castiel’s body acting like his bones were jelly.
“I love you to Cas.” Dean kissed his forehead and began humming the melody to Hey Jude, calming his lover. “I just don’t want to lose any kids, that’s what I would want, to give kids the best we can. Better than I had it.”
Okay, that was it, he was not going to deal with this, and though he cared about him, both as his friend and as his mate’s brother but he would not deal with this. He sent his grace out, just enough to knock a human out, he was right as the amount did not knock Sam out but did knock him off his feet and gave Castiel enough to leave.
“Sure.”
“Cas! You can't just stay stuff like that!” He was embarrassed enough as was and Castiel and his confusion with human customs.
- - - - -
“Dean,” Castiel smiled, after so long he was flooded with relief to see him. He was tied up, but he appeared unhurt. Dean looked relieved before he tensed up and then started struggling, Castiel hurried over to him, he never had seen it but knowing Dean he knew that being tied up could not be something that he liked. Considering the life that the Winchester brothers had to live the idea of being unable to move would mean danger.
“You’re not a hundred percent you man, how do I know this is what you really wa-“ Castiel put his hand over Dean holding him still.
Unbidden the memory of when he was eleven swum in his mind, that had been the first time Dean had gotten seriously hurt. Sam could still remember coming to see his seventeen year old brother gripping his stomach, he had gotten into a fight with some werewolves and gotten gouged in his stomach.
“I could...watch some bees.” He whispered and Dean smirked.
He was surprised when he saw Sam take a bite of a white cake with white frosting, focusing a bit more he saw that it was coconut cake, complete with shredded coconut on the frosting. On one corner of his lips was a smear of white frosting and Gabriel leaned over to kiss it away. The god looked closer, got a real good look, the bond that Sam and Gabriel shared and he barely covered a gasp, glad that he had glamour himself, going ‘invisible girl’ so much that neither the alternate of himself nor the archangel Gabriel could sense him but if he wasn’t careful they would be able to hear him.
Smirking Dean turned to head upstairs where he kept the humans tied up and used. What he did to them went beyond just food but went to torture. They cowered away from him as he entered and he sighed, people were not really his gig anymore.
So to see a place he had always wanted to see but was filed under the 'I want to but I more then likely could never' dream he was awed.
“Thanks baby, now come on, I’m tired of being a bachelor, I’m ready to be married to you.”
He sounded like he was asking for Sam's hand.
“She's eighteen buddy, she has to decide what will be her life. You two are forever welcome here but you must have a dream for your life right?” Gabriel is there and Jacob nods, relaxed again.
“Right, of course you do.” Gabriel chuckled and smiled a bit, “well little brother pulled me to ask me for advice.”
Castiel was going crazy. Where was his Dean? Where was his precious hunter? It didn’t make any sense, even if he had been so out of it that it had been the literal hours it would have taken Dean to get to a town where he could steal a car and drive somewhere to regroup with his brother he couldn’t be so far that Castiel couldn’t sense the body that housed a soul he could not feel; not unless he was looking into those eyes.
“Gabriel?” Sam questioned not quiet sure, never having even thought of Gabriel's true form. To him he was always his vessel, the vessel he had for centuries but he could see that he was him and relaxed to know that it was him and clung to him the best he could. The two angels settled their mates around their necks as they held on relaxed against their bodies.
“It’s good to hear your voice.”
“What’s up Sammy, it’s been way too long.” Dean pulled his little brother into his arms. “I’ve missed you bitch, how have you been?” Dean asked and Sam wrapped his arms around him and tugged him a bit further from Castiel, further than he was willing for his mate to be taken from him.
- - - - -
“Moose in danger is not okay.” He said and sighed shaking his head, “have you never seen Cassie react to Deano being in danger?” He asked and Sam nodded.
- - -
“From life. You’ve worked so hard for so long, and have not truly relaxed in so long.” Castiel sighed before standing and gathering their dirty dishes, “you need to take care of yourself as well, you will not go on another hunt until you’ve had a relaxing break.”
“Cas I...”
He’d still find his Dean.
“Is this how you feel about Dean?” He asked turning the book so the angel could see the sigils of angels showing the symbol they usually would wear when they are mated to show they are now bonded. Even if usually it was easy to see for angels it was something nice for the few that did mate with humans to have something that the human mate could see, it made them feel easier to. Considering the fact that humans would normally show they were taken either by a ring, necklace, pompoms on shawls, so many things.
Castiel went back into the town that he had retrieved Dean from, but it was no use. Dean had tracked miles through the forest, but it had been long enough and not somewhere Dean had ever been, or if he had either on a hunt or passing through to one it had been long ago. Still Castiel had every intention to go over every last square inch of the surrounding woods to find his Dean.
“Do not say that you do take care of yourself, you eat and do sleep but you need to take time to take a break. To allow yourself to take a breather and recharge.”
“Sam is mad.”
“Well yeah, I think that would help. You know anything about coffee and tea Cas?” Dean asked with a smirk and Castiel looked away.
“Yeah, well this is worse.” Gabriel frowned stretching his wings in case he had to run. This was a scouting mission and so they brought no weapons. Much to Dean's chagrin that they would go unarmed, at least a small angel blade to keep them safe but Sam had been right when saying that bringing the blade would be more danger then safety since they could feel safe with it and go too far past the point of being a scouting mission.
So I got to go into the lore a bit, as well as have all four interact. I liked writing this chapter.
“That makes sense, you've got your work cut out for you Cassie.” Gabriel chuckled but held his hands up as Castiel started stalking to them, “I don't mean anything bad about it. You have to realize that Dean here is a feisty one but also so...doesn't think he is worthy of love and care. I don't understand especially with the fact that Dean's soul is so bright. One of the brightest I've ever seen, just as pure as my moose's heart is his soul is bright.
(See the end of the chapter for
“D-Dean…?” Castiel whispered reaching forward but the king of hell merely took a step back, out of his reach. “Dean,” Castiel all but begged and the king of hell reached up to take his sunglasses off, exposing his eyes.
“Died?” Castiel looked like someone had shot him, the idea of losing Dean was one of his deepest fears. And that meant that he, some version of him, had experienced his worst fear.
“Cas calm down, come on buddy. Calm down.” Sam hushed him gently, “it's really important that you tell me, what were you playing?” He assured and Castiel managed to calm down just a bit.
Castiel looked around the world and hummed and began looking around, he knew that this world would have his Dean, he pressed the amulet and ring against his sternum underneath his shirt. He began flying around, sending out his grace looking for Dean’s soul. He’d have him.
“I think I will try...cherry.” He picked at random and she nodded looking to Dean who smirked since he already knew which one he would get.
“Hush,” he promised leaning down kissing Dean's neck who let out a moan as Castiel's slightly calloused fingers ran down his torso. He untangled his hand from Castiel's tie and with a slight tug on his feathers slipped from his wing to push his trench coat off. Castiel moved to allow his trench coat off and quirked an eyebrow as Dean sat up, moving his body and wings as Dean folded the coat almost...lovingly...before reaching over to place it on the bedside table. “Dean?”
Looking between them they opened it seeing a small note that was decorated with stars and said 'Congratulations'.
“You think you could stay in your precious fucking school if I didn't?!” Dean finally yelled, for the first time letting it out-if only just a little-what he had given up for the younger Sasquatch.
When the four finally headed back to the Impala they frowned as they saw that there was something on the hood of the Impala. It was a blue stripped circular box and a letter underneath it being held down. They got it and their eyes widened as the letter was addressed to The Winchesters and their angels.
“I don’t see the point of an aisle anyway.” Castiel stated after he had swallowed his own bite of their shared pie.
“Do you think they don't like it Gabriel?” Castiel asked looking slightly worried with how his eyes went between Dean and what his mate was looking at worriedly.
“No shit, Sherlock.” Violet rolled her eyes and Jacob pouted.
“I don't know. But you can't stop it now.” Castiel said and Dean didn't bother asking why, he knew that why would just make him angry, he trusted his angel to not let anything happen to Sam.
“I was looking around and sensed that there were some familiar power sources near you guys.” Castiel smiled softly, that was a kind of protectiveness that he would expect form his Dean. This demon version of himself seemed to hold his humanity.
“Look Sam,” Gabriel sighed not being able to look up. Apologizing was never the angel of fertility's strong suit, and he defiantly didn't like it. “I'm sorry, I guess I knew after I was sure you and your brother did it that I needed time to heal and I just disappear, I didn't stop to think how you would feel about it.” He managed to get out and he hated it but it reminded Sam for just a moment about what happened to Gabriel, the way he would flinch just from some words.
“I'll tell you everything and answer any questions you have Cas, but first you need to drink half this cup of flower water and have at least a few bites. So pecan pie or cherry pie?” He asked and Castiel held back a groan before answering in the only form of rebellion that he could.
He pours dean another shot, and they just sit for a long maudlin minute.
Still, the mental image of snooker-balling God right in his squirrelly little face, of smacking that shiny rock into his holy teeth, is enough to make Dean grin.
“Otherwise occupied,” Rowena answers, cryptically, then conjures a bottle of scotch and a single tumbler out of absolutely nowhere.
“I saw you beat Moira,” Joey says, steady.
Lee looks at him like he used to, hungry,
“I know!” Dean snaps. He
“Jimi Hendrix?” Yeah, he’s old. But still, “No, not really. I’m where I’m supposed to be.”
The shoulder, the
Cas nods stiffly and heads back towards the infirmary and what can Dean do besides follow him. He needs to check on Sam at any rate.
When Sam tells Dean Michael found a new lead over the breakfast table and doesn’t mention the Castiel shaped wisp sitting on the bench, Dean figures Sam can’t see it.
“You were in Chucks head?”
She looks at each of them in turn, slow and oh so measured, like she might choose one at random to reap right now, a threat which is amplified by the pile of freshly dusted reaper she steps deliberately over.
“Well, that was easy.”
Chuck smiles, more vibrant than Dean has ever seen him look, and his whole visage flickers and then it’s Amara standing by the stove.
Enjoy!
“Great,” Dean says, turning back towards his room. “Do that.”
, a useless effort to keep from vibrating out of his own skin.
“He looks like my dad,” she conforms. Swallows. “And… I don’t know what my dad would’ve said about me being gay, not really. I know he loved me, but. Dude was talking to angels, you don’t get much more bible-basher than that, right?”
“You could have called us,” Sam says, brimming with sympathy, but the wriggling in Dean’s stomach suddenly hardens into a solid mass.
Maybe, just maybe, he
“I just work here,” Pax shrugs, cool as a cucumber. “Hey, you don’t like it, the door’s open.”
“No, no. I, uh, can’t--”
Itchy grass and sticky dirt and,
Dean leaves Sam fretting in the war room and passes out himself for a few hours of blessed oblivion, and then he takes a long shower because he spent a week in his pyjamas before his emergency witch fight and he’s rank.
Sure, they worked with her once or twice before. They knew she was a good hunter. But closing a case in a couple days isn’t the same as living this crap 24/7, and the average hunter life doesn’t really measure up to the Winchester standard of fucknuts crazy, not after years of steadily escalating threats.
Not the time. Not here, not now.
“Listen. I wasn’t going to say this earlier, but there might be something that could help.”
“Tracking Sam’s phone,” he answers, fingers twitching anxiously over the keys.
Dean always forgets that Garth was training to be a dentist before he fell into hunting. Apparently, he went back to school sometime between meeting Bess and hunting Michael, and he has a full on basement surgery thing going on for the in-laws.
But then Ashley calls him, sounds shaky and sad. They can help the girl now, and off these creeps later.
“What did he say?” Cas asks, but Dean just shakes his head, types in Sam’s details. “What are you doing?”
Sam’s been keeping quiet about his freaky psychic nightmares, and God Almighty himself is gunning for another Winchester vs. Winchester title match before he ends the world.
Bess is pretty sure the wounds are from a wraith, and doesn’t that just raise a whole bunch of questions they’ll have to ask when Sleeping Beauty wakes up. Dean’s mulling it over, absently grabs at a bowl of candy by the bed and son of a bitch, that
Sam sighs, long and loud through his nose.
She kicked him out, in the end, with a smile and a quick flash of her fingers,
Cas measures out the rockrose while Dean slices into the biggest fleshy tentacle. It’s tough, rubbery, and when it does finally give under the scalpel blade it smells of old blood and rotten meat. Inside is lined with small, black seeds.
Eileen sighs, nods. Closes the laptop and gets up. Dean thinks she’s going to leave, show him what she thinks of his shitty second-hand advice, but she just grabs a bottle of the good scotch and two glasses. She pours them both a measure, shoots hers back and pours another.
“I promised Kelly I’d look after Jack,” he says. Slides the phone off the table and slips it back into his coat. “Keep him safe. And instead I let him die. Twice.”
“All I’m saying-” Dean pre-empts, before Sam can derail him. Dean is well aware of the shitshow surrounding them, but Sammy has a chance at a little happiness in that and Dean is gonna make sure he doesn’t wave at it as it passes him by. “-is you-- you could do worse.”
“STOP!”
They hang around the red game table for a hour with no biters. It’s not like they can even afford a drink or two to pass the time, even, and Dean doesn’t do well with waiting. Everyone in here is wary and suspicious, but he figures they’re also desperate and if there’s one thing he’s aces at it's playing at dumb and careless.
Dean can’t look at it head on without triggering that burning sensation behind his eyelids, but it’s the first thing he looks for in any given room. The flickers of grey-tan-blue in his peripheral make his heart clench, and it’s the closest Dean feels to being alive anymore.
Capital-G God wants them dead via murder suicide, their only potential weapon against him was destroyed and did he mention,
Sam sighs. “Just. Call me if you need me.”
Dean can’t stop himself from asking, “And what if you don’t?”
. What the fuck.
“And, and I-- I forgive you,
“What the hell, Dean?!” Sam hollers from one of the archive rooms, but Dean is already pulling out drawers at random. They keep two in the car, but there’s a couple spare ones stashed up here somewhere and this was closer than the garage and time is of the essence here and-- Ah! There!
The girls clear the table, Sam washes and Dean dries the dishes, and Jody puts everything back in it’s place. Then they all crowd into the living room and watch
“I, uh--” Sam starts, but Eileen insists, “We can worry about that later.”
Dean’s been pretty fucking shitty at it lately, but he knows
Yeah, that sounds likes Chuck. Sam paces, eyes his next move. Fortuna keeps ranting, now they’ve found a sore spot.
Cas’ shoulders bunch up a little self-consciously, but he tilts the screen so Dean can see. He'd expected research, maybe case hunting, but no. It’s a photo of Jack, smiling lopsidedly with a spoon dangling from the corner of his mouth. Cas swipes to the next shot; similar but the spoon is missing and Jack’s eyebrows are furrowed, then a third; a full gummy grin, what looks like strawberry ice cream smeared across his cheek and nose.
Fantastic.
Of course her whole guiding light speech was Chuck’s purple prose, of course it was. Nobody writes clunky dialogue like him.
That much is obvious. More importantly, Cas pulled through while Dean was out of commission.
Moira doesn’t talk much after that, so Dean doesn’t either. As challenger, she breaks. It’s not a bad shot, but the follow up falls flat and after that Dean has free run of the table.
Dean never thought he’d miss the original apocalypse, but at least then he had something to do. At this rate, he’ll die of boredom before Chuck is done with his universe purge.
Cas doesn’t respond, keeps looking at his own fingers like they hold the secrets of the universe. Dean takes a sip of his El Sol.
“Well
“Alaska.”
Dean reaches for his Blue Label, registers movement by the door and twists to block the jacket from view when Sam barges in, but the door is still closed tight.
“Listen to yourself, ‘we’re owed’? ‘We deserve’? C’mon man, you’re not God. Hell, God’s not even God!”
“Both!” Sam spits. “I can multitask!”
Dean watches Sam trip over a step he’s never tripped over once in their seven years in the bunker and he’s thinking witch, he’s thinking curse, he’s thinking maybe the universe just doesn’t want them to meddle with the balance and karma’s kickin’ their asses.
“Not yet,” Sam says, keeps his eyes on Dean’s face until Dean’s stomach is in knots and he finally meets his dumb, earnest eyebrows. “My point is; Cas doesn’t deserve to be miserable forever. And neither do you.”
Garth asks them for help and God curse or not they can’t say no.
“Suit yourself.” He sets the second one back on the shelf, pours himself a generous measure and takes it to the table. He prods the corner of Cas’ phone where it lays. “Anything interesting?”
Dean was sleeping deeply the drugs working through his body keeping him far under the grip of sleep. When Castiel found the bunker, he could have cried. The Impala was there, and more than that there was the slightest scent of apples and musk. Dean.
“Good. I thought for a second-”
“I do not understand.”
“Same. But I’m not shaking your hand.”
“Yeah, it was dissolved in 1933, but it was a country that was founded by Templars.”
He entered and headed right to where he heard Dean’s voice, he just wanted to see him, see the man he loved, but he sounded angry and that had Castiel walking quicker to it. What he wasn’t expecting was seeing two Deans and his other version of himself. They were all sitting at a table, his husband a bit away from this universe’s version of them but still too close. In front of each of them was a piece of pie that from the look of the filling was blueberry. Dean’s favorite. There was a mug in front of each and while both Deans were drinking coffee his pathetic weaker self had tea. Who was he? Who was he to sit surrounded by such love? Who is he to have everything he wanted and needed?
“I'm serious,” he continued when Dean scoffed. “People you would not think do, do love you.” Sam's eyes flashed to Castiel and the angel's blue eyes widened as he realized that Sam somehow knew how Castiel felt, but at least would stay quiet he hoped. Luckily Dean was looking away from him at the moment not doing well with the turn the conversation had turned. “And you have to know I'd do anything for you, jerk.” Dean let out a chuckle and took a few steps towards Sam, Gabriel moved his wings away from Sam, even though he wanted to just keep a hold of him, but could tell Dean meant no harm to the younger Winchester.
Castiel reached out a hand and took Deans shoulder in his hand, being careful to miss Dean's mark. He gave a gentle squeeze and Dean looked over at Castiel showing his appreciation for Castiel's comfort silently.
Said intimate moment Castiel was looking at Dean and though no one else could see that his angel was asking for permission before he did it. Something that the hunter agreed to which had Castiel walking over to him. He once again put his hands, cupping his hunter's face searching into his mind more and more.
“What?” Dean asked as Sam was looking at him grinning as he petted his dog.
“Wow you're stupider then I thought.”
He knew why, while he had not shied away from praising his Dean for the job he did, for the care he gave, and for freeing him to the free will that was so important. This Castiel, this lesser version of him, never had. So Castiel was starting from scratch; he would allow the praise to fall on his beloved hunter until the man stopped chafing under it. He would go from denying it (hiding behind his jokes and sarcasm) to craving it (craving it despite feeling guilty for it and still chafing under it) till he would finally accept it and drink it up. And Castiel would make sure that he got there.
The top floor had five bedrooms, two master bedrooms that were facing the back of the house that had a balcony as well, one for each of the brothers, and three bedrooms which could hold anyone they wished to house, as they knew that they were so embroiled in the hunter lifestyle to never turn their back on it. They would be able to not do it so there would be somewhere for the boys to house any other hunters. There were also a guest bathroom for the possible guests and a master bath for both the boys rooms.
With a snap of his fingers a nice cage was there with bedding, timothy hay, fresh greens and melons, water bottle, hiding places. Everything an actual guinea pig could ever need. “I know you won't like it at the moment but you'll be thanking me later.” With that the trickster archangel disappeared sending a quick call to the younger angel to let him know he made a present for him.
“Thanks again for this.”
“Yes,” he moaned leaning foreword to try to claim those delicious lips, the chocolate and aqui berry frosting hiding the delicious cake that was his Sam's mouth.
“It might be something I want, but I know you don't.”
“Hey man, you were driven crazy by the souls, you had good intentions. We’re Winchesters, that’s what we do.” Dean grinned giving him a pat on the back, “but this one…he doesn’t seem to consider himself god, just that he has the powers of god.”
His own eyes started to glow and Dean's eyes flashed black, it was not the black of when he was taken over by a demon but a more light black. When being a demon his eyes were like an oil slick but the flashing his eyes were being were like a night sky.
- - - - -
“I can't believe my bond eats like a rabbit.” Gabriel teased and Sam glared at him rolling his eyes.
“Careful Sam Moose, I am a hot archangel, not one to be messed with.” He grinned however the younger Winchester brother didn't look worried or aroused, just rolled his eyes and chuckled grabbing Gabriel, flipping him over so that Gabriel was caged under him. Normally Sam wouldn't be able to do that unless Gabriel let him, but he was able to this time because Gabriel was not expecting it.
“Her th-come on man.” Dean glared at him, “there is no reason to read someone’s mind. Besides working in retail and waitressing is a hard, thankless job. If she needs to make fun of me, or hate on me to make her day worth it, she is being nothing but professional.” Dean had worked his fair waiter jobs under the table, and it was a sucky job. Plenty of people found him hot and so treated him well but plenty treated him badly.
This was it; they were getting married, it wasn’t the way either had ever thought they might have, or what it would be like if they did. Nothing like they knew about weddings beforehand. They had gone to the couples’ favorite diner to get a family size of cold sandwiches, Dean loved messy sandwiches and it was like that. They had gone to Dean and Gabriel’s favorite nearby bakery, Sweet Treats Bakery and had gotten a small cake, lemon and raspberry cake and a honey-apple pie. Dean got no end of teasing for having a wedding pie.
Castiel cooed of the kittens, pondered over the cuteness of the puppies, chirped back at the birds so naturally that Dean was sure that Castiel was actually communicating with them. Then again he had 'interrogated' a cat once, but hadn't meowed at the cat, but was not doing a poor human version of chirping, it sounded so much like chirping like a bird that it took Dean a while to be sure that it really was his angel making the noise.
“Anything I can help with?” Sam asked worriedly.
“Isn't it obvious Deano? You are worth it, both you and my darling sugar cube~” Gabriel cooed nuzzling against Sam's neck. Castiel leaned over to put a hand on Dean's hips.
“We are so up the creek without a paddle.” Sam sighed rubbing his face dry with a towel. “How could we be so unable to do this that we nearly pass out from the exhaustion?” Sam asked the ice cream that Gabriel had gotten for him called to him but he couldn't have it till he actually had something healthy for breakfast.
I could see Dean and Gabe being best friends while Sam and Cas are as well. It is a great thing when you can approve of your siblings lover. I love fluffing everything. Destiel fluff, Sabriel fluff, Winchester bros brotherly fluff, angel bros brotherly fluff. Just all the fluff.
It felt weird, not bad just strange, it was like there was another being he could feel. No, not a being, Castiel. How Castiel viewed him...he had never felt such love directed at him, it was like he was the most important single thing that Castiel knew of. Like he was...he was home. Castiel viewed Dean as his home.
“Okay adored, fog it shall be.”
- - -
His dark thoughts did not let him think anything positive. It didn't allow him to think that he was the older brother and he had been the one to protect Sam. That to Sam he had been a father, mother and big brother, that he hid the truth from him as long as he could and made sure to be gentle and slow when he trained him; that Sam got to be a kid while it was only Bobby who reminded Dean and showed him how to be a kid growing up. He definitely didn't allow himself to think that maybe it wasn't that a normal life that didn't match up with him but it was just that Lisa and Ben were not right with him.
Dean hurried along the woods, he hated the woods, really hated it. Especially being as deep in the woods as he seemed to be: it always felt a bit like he was the monster instead of whatever he was hunting, when it was deep in the woods it was in a place that humans were not meant to be, not meant to go.
“Oh Dean-O don’t you like me? We are to be brothers-in-law.” Gabriel chuckled while Dean and Sam looked at him shocked, that Gabriel would share this information that he wanted to hide to keep Sam safe.
“Not really Sammy, from the little bit Cassie has said Dean doesn't really understand his worth, you should talk to him.” Gabriel asked and Sam looked over at him his hazel eyes clouding as he thought through it all. Dean was normally so confident acting and had been his caretaker all growing up-part older brother and part parent-the idea that Dean needed to be taking care of like that, not emotionally. He worried how many times as a child that Dean was taking care of him, assuring him that he would be okay, that Dean needed to have someone there for him and he wasn't there.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean is his. He won; she is nothing. Everyone is nothing, as long as he has his Dean.
“That's fucked up.” Sam groaned and Dean nodded. He shook his head taking a deep breath as finally the tension was gone.
“Oh.” Gabriel quieted before laughing and Castiel turned his eyes glowing white as he glared at Gabriel but before he could say something Gabriel flew across the large spacious kitchen and was holding his hands up. “Wait, Cassie! I can explain!” He assured and Castiel paused but his eyes were still glowing bright white and anger, “he didn’t mean it!”
“Fuck you, Watson.”
“No that isn't it, but I thought that you were really going for that long haired one.” He pointed to the auburn one who turned her head over to look at their direction.
“You can’t fucking be serious, asshole.” Dean was suddenly dead serious, “you want to know what it was like for me?! You even bother to wonder?” Dean growled out and Castiel was suddenly hit with his selfishness, he had been so busy thinking about his own pain and shock of finding Dean alive again that he didn’t even think about what Dean was going through.
The fact that Dean, who slept lightly and no more then four hours a night, was able to sleep so deeply where he was dead to the world when in his wings hearing his angel coo to him spoke volumes. It spoke not only of love, but of trust. He could still sense the bond, just as active as ever, feeling safe with him.
“Is that…is that why you are in this universe?”
For his part, Gabriel stood happily not moving looking uncomfortable with all three of their eyes on him. In fact if anything he seemed to preen under their attention.
“Wait...yeah...that's a good point.” Sam just figured that out and was now confused, if John had binned Dean when he was five then that would have been just before or after Sam's own birth. So it would make sense that Dean should have started manifesting his powers a decade before Sam did.
“So let me see if I’ve got this straight; we’re dealing with a Cas from another universe, one who didn’t go on a crazy god trip, who was in a relationship with that universe’s Dean; married or just bo-boyfriends, something romantic.” Sam waited for Dean’s nod, he didn’t mention the red that his older brother’s ears were going red and he was looking everywhere but their Castiel. Why wouldn’t he just admit his feelings already? It wasn’t like he was fooling anyone: Balthazar, Crowley, Meg; human, angel or demon all it took was seeing them interact for a few moments to know they were so in love. Sam always knew that he would never push someone to admit, or come out, they would do it when they were ready, but after hearing his brother go gaga over Dr. Sexy, check out the strong jaw lines of random guys and try to hide the light flirting he did with interesting looking men for well over a decade Sam was ready to pull his long hair out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you, Sam,” Castiel was very grateful for his brother, Sam was a brother so much more than all of his angelic siblings.
He didn’t know why they would be there; he could sense the other version of himself and the version of his brother. As similar as this particular Dean was, he was not his Dean. It was not the older brother that he loved so much, was not the one who dedicated himself fully to Sam as they grew, who was an older brother, mother, and father to him. The fact that the monstrosity that was the reason that his brother and the closest thing he had to a father figure other than Dean was lost to him forever. He didn’t know why it was that he was the one who survived, Dean was dead before the explosion that knocked him down and blinded him and killed Bobby.

“But...”
“Yep, I woke up after everything with no eyes, no ring and my necklace missing.” Dean explained and was cut off.
“Dean...” Castiel whispered but instead of falling into his arms, like it seemed Dean would do, he pulled away from him.
“Well let's see; you will need a cage-make sure that it is not wire bottomed as it could cause bumble foot.” She shuddered before going on to explain, “it is a infection in the feet from either wire bottom cages or not cleaning the cage enough so that they end up standing in their own pee. Yeah.” She nodded in agreement seeing Dean's face. “You'll need a water bottle-not a bowl a bottle that hangs in the cage side-and a bowl to hold food, and places for them to hide.” She hummed pointing to a small little igloo looking thing that kind of reminded him in a few ways about the things in a fish bowl. “If you're going to get more then one you need to make sure that they have enough room, don't get a starter cage unless you are going to only have one. But you need to make sure that you keep them in a place with a lot of time with people because they could die of loneliness if they aren't given enough attention.” She added smiling at a curly furred one that Dean instantly realized it was her favorite. “But you need to feed them Timothy Hay, it has a lot of nutrients, clip their nails gently, they love to eat greens and fruits. And you need bedding for him. That's everything I think.” She smiled and Dean grinned and he looked over to the guinea pigs.
While Rosalie was dressed in a almost 'punk' attire being tall in ripped black jeans and a black shirt that had a strange pastel pink and blue cartoonish hippocampus on it. Her wife had long auburn hair in a long black skirt and lacy beaded black shirt. She was already having a happy talk with someone in the living room. Gabriel.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What did you do?” Bobby demanded, whether he was asking Castiel about opening Purgatory and then touching Dean like he was or Sam for touching Castiel like that.
“How long have we been together, Dean?” Dean glanced up from his tune up of Castiel's Lincoln Continental Mark V, raising an eyebrow. That was a strange question, especially since he would think that he would know exactly. Dean could name the day-June 19th-but he bet that Castiel could have told him how long they had been together down to the minute.
“Sammy, what’s going on lollipop?” Gabriel slowly managed to stand; he was still weak, but he was able to stand. “What’s happened?”
Dean who loved him.
“He is fine Dean.” Castiel said but did not allow Dean to pull away fully and instead just kept looking into Dean’s eyes. Bobby was over to watch over Sam who was standing now.
“A but...no an and. A little bit of both.” Sam shook his head but there was no judgment coming from Gabriel. “It's just now...I don't know where to go from here.”
For a little while it was fine, it was perfect, they got to talk and hang out in their nest, snuggling in the large bed which was the closest thing to a nest in Dean’s mind, not the entire house, Dean baked pies, lots of pies, in the crazy kitchen. Castiel was partial to the pecan pie that Dean made, though he did like the cherry pie and apple pie especially that Dean loved so much. They went on dates; going out to eat and Castiel would pick food off his plate, they’d go see a movie and Castiel would pull him into his lap, they’d listen to music on the roof of their home/nest and just watch the stars, they’d cook together with the music playing and Dean would pull Castiel in a dance which more than once caused there food to burn. Castiel would take Dean to the beach, letting Dean swim in the water and build sandcastles together Sam and he never got to do, they’d spend lazy days not getting out of bed till noon, and doing all the things that any committed couple would do. There was more, Dean called Sam and Bobby regularly, not a week went by he didn’t and often more than that, and after three weeks Dean got antsy and they went on hunting trips, Dean checking in with Bobby each time, Dean told Sam to retire forever from the hunting life, to find his apple pie life again.
That was the first Castiel he had given mercy to. The one with their designations of ‘alpha, beta and omega’ Sam had been ready to kill that one. But…the cries of Dean begging for his ‘mate’ and husband, the little boy and girl crying for ‘Uncle Sam, no!’ and the sobbing of a little boy screaming ‘daddy’ he let him go. He didn’t know why he did…it would have been for the best for those children and his brother but…now was not time to worry about that.
When Dean blinked his eyes open as his normal four hours of sleep a night came to a close. What he wasn't expecting was for Castiel to be standing there watching Dean sleep. He jumped as he saw that his angel was watching over him. He knew it was something that Castiel did, always watching over him and even in the bunker he would stand outside of Dean's room waiting for his hunter to wake up.
With an animalistic screech Castiel let his powers out, knocking not just Dean but everything in a three-foot radius of him away. Dean hit into the wall letting out a grunt before falling to the floor. Motionless as Castiel watched with uncomprehending white eyes.
Turning they saw a young man, maybe nineteen years old if that. “Oh, I-I'm sorry you two are just...just...adorable together.” He managed out and Gabriel chuckled and shot him a wink.
Sam gasped falling to the bed he and Gabriel shared. So far it had only been to sleep, not that they had not done anything before but that was before Gabriel had died, but that might change tonight. Gabriel all but jumped onto Sam, straddling his lap, and frantically kissed him. He tore at Sam’s clothes, and the tall man shrugged them off, helping Gabriel take the clothing off him.

Castiel frowned as he looked along the streets. Another part of the earth that had no trace of his father. Even Gabriel had agreed to come out of hiding to help find him. “Are you okay?” Castiel paused with where he had been looking turning to see a young woman with short teal hair. He tilted his head finding the color strange but seeing her brown eyebrows he gathered she had dyed her hair.
“Yes. And then even different things since Dean and Sam are two very different people. Or Sam's demon blood.” Castiel added and Gabriel glared at him and Sam frowned at the glare.
If the family friends that were managers at the family cafe cursed them...well, Jacob and Violet didn't know for sure. They did know that Karen who was the worst bully for Jacob was cursed of some kind. Sometimes Violet thought about asking them to teach her how to use magic just like they had taught daddy; he wasn't too into it. He could do a lot but wasn't as good as he was he wasn't a witch. However it was this that she was meant to be.
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel gave an indulgent smile, “but there are many different pies.”
“You show no interest in men, I thought my vessel would keep you from wanting that.” He explained and Dean looked away from him a mixture of uncomfortable to be having this conversation at all, guilt that he had his precious Cas thinking he wasn't good enough to want that with, shock that he was using the word precious even if only in his own head, just too many emotions for him to process. Especially when he wasn't one to allow himself to dwell on feelings, and he refused to think about the want swirling in his gut at the sound that Castiel didn't mind him dreaming of him like that.
“Well it's nice to meet you Castiel, you know...you look like you could use a bit of time. Come on, my apartment is right over here.” She smiled and Castiel frowned, he sensed nothing malicious about her and knew that if she did have ill intent he could handle himself.
They talked about going into the past, they would not be able to change it but in that way Dean could see and interact with cowboys, go to a real saloon when it was still very much a saloon and the times Dean talked about getting Castiel a cowboy hat. Dean had…Dean had died before they got the chance. But this Dean he would be able to. They’d get married in the human way as well as the bonding, they’d go to any times that Dean wished to see, they would love and be together through it all as they lived their lives.
Dean hummed as he finished with the hunt. The witch they had gone after was hard to fight and he groaned. He hated witches. He really fucking hated witches. He was just glad they didn't get cursed. Those curses were hell. One had almost gotten him, and that had ignited Castiel's bad ass angel mode and he had gone ape shit on them.
He had a heart that shimmered and shined. It glittered and it took Gabriel a while longer then he normally would have just stuck in awe at him.
When they finished up they took the leftovers and dropped them off at a shelter, it was enough to feed them for the night for dinner, at least five or six people if not more. That night they came home tired, and sleepy but all happy. They sat and petted the animals for a while, petting and talking to the girl guinea pigs and Buddy, before they all retired for the night and enjoyed the quiet domesticity of falling asleep in their lover's arms.
We got a call about a hunt in Maryland, be back soon.
He might not understand but Castiel did. Castiel always did.
“Then why did you never-“
Dean’s heart was racing, the way that it only ever did when on a hunt, every second could mean that this Castiel, this copy of him, was gone but it could also mean he was a second closer to showing up. Dean got out of the house but frowned, something was…wrong.
“Of course I am Cas, more than I ever thought I’d get.” Dean said, and though he didn’t even voice or reference the ‘but’ of it though that did not satisfy Castiel. He didn’t want to be just more than Dean ever thought he’d get, he wanted to be everything Dean could ever want and more.

It was perfect, Castiel and Dean hunting as they went, all the good parts of it, saving lives and hunting things. Castiel easily healing any slight hurt Dean experienced, and if anything, ever seriously hurt the hunter…well, its death was quick at the hands of the being with dark hair and white eyes. Quick but not at all painless. They would go home or to the hotel they were staying at and whisper secrets to each other, things that neither would ever tell someone else. Sam went back to start doing some classes, using fake credentials to be Sam Campbell and to be a law professor, Bobby kept up being the network of hunters.
Castiel's sweet smile was enough that the discomfort of saying that was more then worth it. “Dean,” he whispered kindly leaning down to kiss Dean once again. They continued kissing, rubbing each others arms and chest, being held by arms and chests and wings until Dean finally slipped off to sleep in his mate's arms.
“Well I don't know,” Sam shrugged putting the leash they had used to take Buddy for his morning walk.
“You asked who I thought I am; I know I am Castiel. It’s a much easier question to ask than what I am.”
“Thank you,” Dean hoped she could hear his sincerity as he moved to quickly dial in his brother’s number. Castiel was infamous for being bad about answering his phone and Dean didn’t know how long he had. He didn’t know when that other Castiel would discover he was missing and come after him. He needed to do this and leave; he didn’t even know how dangerous he might be for other people.
- - - - -
He wasn't sure if that was going to happen but he did sleep deeper knowing his angel was there. The more Castiel spoke and he was able to hear his voice, the more that he would relax till every muscle of his body was pliant like clay. He looked years younger with his face so relaxed and vulnerable.
Looking into his eyes, so cruel instead of warm and gentle, protective like he knew they could look, had seen them look, he couldn’t deny it. Castiel began shaking, he had known, even if he tried to hope against it, that it would take a long time to get Dean to warm up to him, that he would have to be patient but that wasn’t too big of a problem. But hatred?
“The piggehs need to have fresh water and timothy hay before it is open, after the cafe is closed they need at least an hour of floor time, and fresh water again and fruits and greens feed as well.”
“Okay honey, what’s your name?” Dean asked stooping down to her level and she jumped a bit.
Gabriel sighed but knew he would have to. He was a hedonist and was not one to deal with this kind of awkwardness and silent treatment. But he wasn't going to do it in front of such a young angel like Castiel and Dean.
“Why?” Gabriel asked as Castiel was used to them having to move all the time and Sam raised an eyebrow.
“Was that just...” he shook his head. He still thought of Gabriel, but it had been a while since he thought he heard his voice, saw him from the corner of his eye. It had always been the same way; he thought he heard or saw Gabriel and looked quickly to see him reacting on instincts but before the grin could continue to widen his lips he'd realize it wasn't him-either someone else who at a glance looked close to him or there was nothing there he'd frown.
“Dean.” He said in his deep gravely voice as Dean groaned.
“You were just a fledgling Cassie, all you had to do was plant the seeds, I had to use my grace to mature them.” Gabriel pouted as Castiel smirked at the pout of his older brother.
Putting his hand onto Dean’s face he pushed his grace into, he gasped as he realized something. He could heal Dean, he could remake each cell like he had once before, making him newly born again. But it would not bring him back his Dean. Dean was gone. Dead. Killed by him, his hands, because he did not pay attention. He killed his mate.
“Better then can be sugar.” He grinned and with a snap of his fingers he was cleaned up and smirked, “they won't be bothering anyone again. Forget purgatory, I took them straight to hell.” Gabriel growled and his wings fluttered and moved to wrap around Sam.
Dean frowned as he could see there was nothing that was not Castiel. He could tell, could feel something was wrong even though he always tried to fight it back. It was Castiel who he trusted too much to think anything was wrong.
“Castiel?” Dean couldn't think anything like that now. He couldn't convince himself that Castiel didn't want this. He didn't understand what could possibly possess him to but for some reason he wanted Dean.
Dean Winchester, his friend, was obviously a demon, and a powerful one. If Gabriel didn’t know any better, he would think him one of the fated Knights of Hell but knew they had all been killed by their leader, Cain.
“But if that's the case why did Cas sa-”
We've got it
“You sleep good, Sammy?” Dean asked taking a bite of his eggs and Sam snorted.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay lets see what we need.” Dean hummed being happy that Castiel had a recipe as well, “let's see. Sugar? Salt? Brown sugar? Flour? Cinnamon? Ginger? Nutmeg? Lemon juice? Butter? Egg?” Dean asked and after each one Castiel held it up nodding and sighed pulling his sleeves up. “Okay, wash our hands and get to work.” Dean said and stopped Castiel, “dude trust me; lose the coat and pull your sleeves up.” He said and Castiel took off his coat and Dean, not able to let the opportunity to touch slip past him helped him by rolling Castiel's sleeves up for him.
“Holy fuck that is good.”
“Leave?”

“I don't know guys...maybe we shouldn't.” Dean frowned, he of the four had been most adamant wanting them to be able to have their childhood. However Violet was her rebellious teenage self. Not so much partying hard or anything but she didn't want to do this anymore and all four were more then happy to let her not. She had been trained for eight years, never anything like Dean and Sam. Hadn't learned to dig themselves out of a grave, to make a homemade EMF machine, or anything like that but she knew enough to defend herself and if something supernatural came after her she could defend herself.
Dean loved pie-his favorite was apple, the kind his mother made the most often, but he still loved all pie-he had dedicated every breath he had to protect people, they would never know what he did for him but that was okay, he would make sure that they were safe and that is all he cared about. Saving people, hunting things; the family business, and he was good at it. But he lied, a lot, most to himself at least on the outside, he hid his fears, his pain behind macho bravo and a panty dropping smile. He was attracted to men and women equally but hid any male conquests from his brother and everyone else for fear of what they would do (the reason behind this was still the exact same; a flash of John Winchester slapping him across the face when seeing Dean kissing a classmate-a male classmate). He was forced to grow up way too fast, he was Sam’s parent in all ways that matter and took care of his father more than his father ever took care of him, he gave everything he ever wanted but all he wanted was to be loved. He wanted someone to love him, he might not ever admit it and try to brush off any compliments, but he lived for praise. Praise made him light up and bloom from the inside. Dean wanted someone to love him, to adore and dedicate themselves to him like he dedicated to others, for them to be the one who is strong and takes charge, for him in just this one way not be always in charge-of course he loved to pamper a lover or anyone really but to feel like he can be pampered sometimes as well.
"Hmph." He grumbled.
"Can I help you?" She sniffed.
"Sounds reasonable. Y'never know, Dean might forget in a few days."
"Do you think it's the man who had an overdose?" Cas asked.
"He hit his head damn hard, Sammy. I wasn't overreacting." He grumbled.
The two older boys laughed again and started to leave.
The night went by as usual for the Winchesters, the only thing different was the constant mention of Cas from the beach with the awesome eyes.
Cas came out of the bathroom then. "Hello."
“I love you, Cas.” Dean said in enochian, one of the phrases Cas had taught him a few years ago, he kissed Cas’ hair then his forehead.
I quickly text Dean telling him Pete's room was empty.
"Cool it, bitch." Dean rolled his eyes. "He's got better eyes that you or me. You got it yet, Huggybear?"
Dean gulped, his mother's words ringing around in his head from a few months ago.
Cas nodded and sat at the table, pulling Dad's journal out of Dean's bag and flicked through.
I shook my head. "At least one death in each room. Different kinds of people too. But look, in the last fifteen years they've all been two men."
Then it was my turn to blush.
"Just please. I-I'm telling you not to. Please just trust me. Just 'cos-" Dean begged, his hand on Castiel's shoulder.
He shook his head.
"I have to." Castiel's breath caught just as Dean felt something wet on his forehead.
