"Come on Dean," Charlie yelled from the other side of the store, "get a wiggle on!" She couldn't have hidden the concern in her face if she'd tried, not from Dean, but thankfully she didn't say anything, and Dean slipped back to his work station without another word.
“Emptiness?” Dean nodded, not quite sure where Claire was going with that. The emptiness was definitely not the weirdest part of the whole thing.
“We don’t have any neighbours,” Jack frowned, looking highly confused.
“Yeah. Feels different. Magical.”
Sorry guys. One of these weeks I'll remember what a Saturday is in time to post the chapter... but not this week, and I already know it's unlikely to happen next week either. Well! At least it's here now!
And… he couldn't fully figure out what he was feeling, but he thought he wanted to care about him again. It was weird, wanting to care about someone he couldn't remember but knew he once cared about, but he was fairly sure that was what the feeling was.
He fiddled with his ring absentmindedly as he quickly flicked through the pictures, seeing image after image of the same man. In some of them it was entire family pictures, but many were smaller groups. Cas and Jack and Claire, Cas and Sam, Cas and Jody and Donna, Cas and Dean, Cas and Dean, Cas and Dean. There were so many pictures of them, so much affection in each photo, and yet Dean couldn’t remember any of it.
“Dean, can I talk to you for a moment?” It was Mary, standing against the wall as though she’d been waiting for Dean to be done so that she could talk to him… or maybe so she could catch him alone.
<3 <3 <3
"Oh, hey Lisa," he said with a strained smile, twisting in his seat to look at his ex-girlfriend. He had no idea why she was here, it wasn't like she'd had any interest in talking to him ever since they'd broken up before now.
"I love you, too," Castiel replied, pressing a quick kiss to his lips. "Does this mean we can start wearing our wedding rings in public?"
He held his breath, and pulled the lid off. Apparently this guy was family, and fear had never stopped Dean from facing his family before, and that wouldn’t change now.
"Hello, Pam," Dean said, "good to see you back." He walked back to his station, leading Pamala, and gesturing for her to take a seat on the chair. "Has it all healed properly?"
"Spot on. They've given us over a week's notice this time. The dinner is a week on Friday." Sam sounded about as enthusiastic as Dean felt, which wasn't really surprising. Sam had a much better relationship with them than Dean did—he had gone into a 'nice, appropriate career' after all—but he was proud of his brother and all his achievements, and hated having to listen to their mom and dad complain about Dean's job and belittle his achievements for so long. Honestly, he was probably more upset about it than Dean was. He was pretty much used to it by now, and just did his best to ignore it. Sam however, believed that bad things shouldn't just be ignored.
"No, but you do have a crush on this one. So, what are you going to do about it?"
"Dean, you're a lifesaver," Charlie groaned, practically inhaling her coffee.
Castiel thought about his answer carefully, shaking the blanket they had brought and placing it down to have something to do with his hands. “None quite as nice as this one,” he eventually said, “but there are some beautiful places. I’ll show you sometime, it’ll be good to get us both out into the fresh air.”
Cas smiled at him and then slipped out the room, leaving Dean alone with his thoughts once more.
Claire and Jack talked for a long time, taking it in turns to tell story after story about Castiel. He'd hoped that one of them would jog his memory, or he'd at least feel some kind of familiarity with the person they described, but he felt nothing. It was like being told about a movie character. He could tell from Claire and Jack's faces that they'd hoped for the same thing he had, and he wasn't sure if it made it better that they all had the same problem, or made it worse that he'd let the kids down just because his brain wouldn't remenever.
"Do we have to?" Dean groaned, though he did follow Charlie and take a seat in her piercing chair.
Cas yowled. He hadn’t even known he could make that noise until it was ripping it’s way out of his throat, echoing around the room and making Dean wince. He crawled up Dean’s chest, sitting as tall as the small frame of his vessel would allow as he stared down at his charge, righteous fury burning in his eyes.
"Because it sounds like you need one. I understand it's annoying, but I think you just need a break."
"Yeah," Dean admitted, feeling a little ridiculous. Cas was allowed to not tell him everything, he didn't deserve to have Dean instantly assuming something was wrong just because he wasn't in a talking mood.
He waited until after their show, after another breathtaking performance from Cas, which Dean could tell still wasn't as free as he normally was. He waited until the rest of the troop started to celebrate a job well done, and then headed on his way to track down his friend. Unsurprisingly, Cas was nowhere to be seen. The other boy seemed to have a skill for slipping into the shadows, and by the time Dean had Baby settled in for the night, he was long gone.
In that time Cas figured out that he couldn't speak, anything he tried to say just came out in various meows, and that his grace was inaccessible to him. Meaning that for now, he was graceless, voiceless, opposable-thumbs-less, Angel-blade-less, and mainly just helpless.
“Sounds good,” Cas nodded, looking relieved. “So… I’ll see you next week?”
"Hello again, handsome," Dean whispered to him with a quick wink, presumably hoping it would be too fast for the cameras.
"Come on, Dean! Where's the harm!"
Twelve months sounded like a long time, sometimes it felt like one too, but the amount that had happened in the last year… it felt like an eternity. A positive eternity. Dean's life was still the same as it had been before, but it was also distinctly better.
Hello!! I've actually made it on time for once!!
Hope you enjoy!!
"I know, and I appreciate that, but this isn't really something you can help with." Cas' eyes implored him to understand, to let it go.
He was just starting on the second letter, an 'A' when Sam looked down and saw what he was doing.
"I'll bear that in mind."
There we go! Cas is finally getting somewhere!
Thanks for reading!!!
He wasn't sure how long he'd been in pain when he eventually managed to blink his eyes open, the pain slowly fading until it disappeared completely.
Comments and kudos make my day!!!
Hope you enjoyed!!!
“I’m trying to do better,” Dean whispered into the silent room. “I’m getting better at holding back my temper, at apologising, at listening to the full story. It’s not enough, but I really am trying Whiskers.” He snorted quietly at himself, smoothing the fur on Cas’ tail down. “I don’t know why talking to you is so easy. You can’t give me any advice, I don’t think you can even understand me. I guess it’s just nice to be able to tell someone. You’re a good listener.”
"Wait! Cas!" Dean gasped, "what- what's happening? Why can't you do this?"
See you then!
"Your favorite sap, though."
Sorry guys! You can put your pitchforks away, I'm here! I did remember to post this yesterday, but then I got distracted, and then I woke up this morning suddenly realising I hadn't actually gotten around to posting it yet.
He loved cooking, but his mom refused to let him in the kitchen. He hated sports, but that was all his dad wanted to talk about. Not to mention that  Sam had been showing up exactly when the food was being served for the last year. It just happened he had a better idea of when that was than Dean did.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was your consultation, right?” Charlie nodded at the door that was still swinging slightly from Cas’ exit.
“That’d be nice,” Dean agreed with a soft grin, dropping heavily onto the blanket and pulling his rucksack off. “I’ve always loved forests, must be the wolf in me,” he tipped his head back, closing his eyes against the harsh light of the sun as it warmed his face. “This one though,” he laughed quietly, “this one is something special.”
Dean opened his mouth to reply, but he didn't have time to say anything before Cas had thrown himself back in the air and lost himself once more in the tumbles and glides of his act. Dean followed him with his eyes for a minute, appreciating how free his friend looked, before turning his attention back to Baby. He couldn't spend all day appreciating Cas' act, he had his own to focus on.
They didn't really talk much as they walked, the warm sun streaming down on them and making them both way too hot. Instead they just gazed around, Castiel seeing the forest he'd lived in for the last seven years in a whole new light now that he had Dean walking beside him, staring open mouthed at every new thing he passed. Castiel knew that Dean had spent most of his life in a forest, which left him wondering how confined Dean had been, for all of this to be new to him.
Where had this ring come from? It was obviously important to him, so why couldn't he remember it?
Cas walked forwards, stopping less than a meter away from Dean. He didn't think. He just pushed himself to his feet and reached out, pressing his lips against Cas'.
Hope you enjoyed!!
Dean dropped his duffel onto the floor, pulling open all the inner pockets until he could find the case notes he still had. Thank goodness he hadn't thrown them away yet!
It made family dinners more than a little awkward, which was probably why they only had them once every month or so, rather than every week like he was sure his parents would prefer.
Everything was too loud, too harsh, too bright, too heavy, too much.
"Hey Claire," Dean said carefully, stepping up next to the desk and leaning against it, trying to hide how he was looking the guy up and down. Originally it had been to try and get a read on him… but by this point Dean was just subtly enjoying the view. "Is this my consultation?"
"Did anyone know?" Sam asked, looking slightly offended. Dean couldn't blame him, Dean had kept this a secret for so long—from his own brother—and if everyone else knew… yeah, Dean could see why Sam was worried.
"Never," Cas grinned in agreement. "I remember that time when you thought Baby was walking funny."
**Jazz hands** There we have it kids!! Hope you liked it!!
From the looks of things, he wouldn’t have to wait too much longer.
They were married. They were happy. And Dean had fucking forgotten.
"Take some time," Dean said gently, "and like I said, you can mix and match your favorite parts."
Comments and kudos mean the world to me!!!
It took a couple of minutes for everyone to trickle into the room, and by the time they arrived Jo was shaking with excitement.
“You’re not overreacting,” Sam told him, as though he could read Dean’s mind. Then again, they’d basically lived in each other’s pockets their entire lives, he probably could read Dean’s mind by now. “I’m worried too, something is wrong.” It was just Sam confirming what Dean already knew, it should make him feel worse if anything—whatever was up with Cas was unsubtle enough for everyone to notice—but it actually made him feel better. He was right, Cas wasn’t okay, which meant that Dean, as his best friend, had a right to stage an intervention of  sorts. He didn’t know what he was going to do, but he’d make sure Cas was okay if it was the last thing he did!
And that was a dangerous thing to want.
Yes. Somehow it is this time of the week again, and I am bringing you a new chapter!!
“My dad had some old tapes. I don’t know where he got them, and he never actually listened to them, but he’d never thrown them out either. I found them one day, and was instantly hooked. I just loved how it made me feel, you know?”
Also I understand that things are weird and you guys are probably as tired as I am... But if you have ten seconds to write a comment it would mean the world to me! I'm struggling with motivation at the moment (I think I'm starting to realise how long this story is, and getting terrified of commitment) (saying that I promise there is 0 chance of this story being abandoned. I'm going to keep going, but comments would definitely help)
Tomorrow.
"Well, yes, I guess—"
If you see any mistakes, please let me know! I've given it a look over, but I doubt I caught everything.
The parking lot was still mostly empty when he arrived, the few cars scattered around were probably some of the other pre-production crew members wanting to get a jump on their work before it started getting busy.
"I'm asexual!" Cas yelled, and Dean could tell from the look on his face that he hadn't meant to say that. He hadn't meant to tell the truth. "I don't want- any stuff." His words quietened by the end of his sentence, his conviction evaporating.
"Oh, alright. Well, I hope you have a good evening," Hannah replied, going back to scrolling through her tablet and not seeming too bothered about Castiel's rejection. He hoped that meant that she really wasn't upset, and not just that she’d be asking again tomorrow.
"I look forward to seeing them again too," Dean nodded, "at the end of this week and not a day earlier. I'm enjoying getting you alone for once."
It didn't feel like jumping to conclusions… but maybe that was just the doubt talking.
"Sure, it was good," Dean shrugged. It hadn't been the best week ever, but he'd admittedly had worse weeks, and he could already tell that this week was going to be worse—his family dinners always made everything worse.
Cas frowned in confusion. Something was going on here, and he'd had enough of being stuck in the dark.
Look at me! Remembering how the days of the week work and everything!
(See the end of the chapter for
"What just happened?" Claire asked loudly. Dean and Cas pulled apart so they could face their family, but they didn't try to hide anything like they did before. The cat was out of the bag now, and Dean honestly didn't think it was a bad thing at all.
"Perfect. We'll have some breakfast, and pack the bags. It's not an overly long walk." Castiel was… Excited. Excited to get outside and go on a walk and enjoy nature in a way he couldn't remember feeling for a while. Dean really must be good for him, and Castiel could only hope he was helping the familiar in return.
A relieved breath escaped him when he saw Dean already sitting at their usual table, Charlie and Benny both already there, as well, and a free seat right next to Dean which Cas couldn't wait to sit in. He grabbed the first lunch that looked edible and went to join them, a small smile on his face which only grew the closer he got.
Thanks for reading!!
Dean's morning was good, though not particularly interesting. He had three separate walk-ins, all picking one of the simple stencils that Dean could do in his sleep; he was also fairly sure at least one of them was only there due to a dare. They got a lot of them, especially around September when all the college kids started turning up. They would dare each other to get tattoos, and when the social structures were only just being created no one would dare back out. Dean always asked them if they were sure before he started, but beyond that he couldn’t do much more than make sure they sign the waiver so they couldn’t turn this back on the shop if they later decided following through with the dare had been stupid.
Dean woke slowly, the light from a gap in the curtains rousing him despite his body not being quite ready to get up yet. He stretched his limbs out, trying to shake the sleep which was dragging at his mind away, but in doing so shaking away the warm feeling of safety which he hadn't even noticed until it was gone. It was like being covered with a warm, fluffy blanket of belonging, and now that he'd lost it he was alone and cold.
All this thinking was making his head hurt, he must have hit his head pretty hard, but he couldn't stop. Not if there was a chance the soul stealing angel was still out there. He would just finish this hunt, and then when he was back at the bunker he would be able to sleep for however long he wanted.
It had been a while, at the very least. Dean chuckled to himself. Even Lisa… Dean had liked her, and losing her had been like a kick in the chest but… Dean had the feeling he'd loved the idea of her more than he'd actually loved her.
"You brought pie?" Dean asked, his eyes wide. "Marry me."
This is probably one of my favourite chapters so far. They're just so soft!! I hope you like it too!!!
"One moment," Jo grinned, taking two steps backwards and yelling through the store, "everyone come here!" Dean was thankful that they hadn't opened yet, otherwise this would be even more embarrassing than it was right now.
And he knew that he wanted to be there for all of it.
"Sounds good," the man smiled, "I'll see you later Claire." Clearly he did know Claire, well enough that he would 'see her later' and Dean knew it was rude to pry, so he wasn't exactly about to ask, but he wondered where they knew each other from.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Incredibly hot?"
"Yes, Mom?"
"As friends?" Dean asked carefully, "or like… a date."
“‘M worried, Baby,” he whispered. “Something's not right with Cas, but he refuses to talk to me." His vision is getting blurry from unshed tears, and his nose is starting to run uncomfortably. He didn't stop though, he needed to get this out to the one being he knew wouldn't think he was just over reacting. "I don't know what's happening."
Dean washed his hands slowly, letting the quiet of the bathroom calm him. Dean's family had invited them to stay for dinner, and it had been delicious - as always - but he was tired, and despite the fact there weren't many of them there, an excited Sam was loud enough for a hundred other people.
Lunch passed quickly after that, and, as much as he hated it, Castiel knew he had to leave Dean and get back to work. They shared a couple of soft kisses, making the most of the fact no one was around to see them, then Castiel knew he had delayed the inevitable long enough.
Enjoy!
"Yes. We do."
Dean stared wordlessly at Cas for a long moment, his mouth opening and closing but no words coming out. He seemed to come to a decision about something, and moments later he was leaning forwards and covering Cas’ mouth with his own.
"Where did you go anyway?" Eileen asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Except apparently that had already happened to him once, but that really wasn’t his point here.
'Hello' kisses, 'goodbye' kisses, 'good luck' kisses, 'I'm glad you're here' kisses.
"I'm glad you like them," Dean said, the tips of his pointy ears turning red with his blush.
He started batting his food in the bowl they had bought him. Not eating it, but just playing with it instead. A particularly large swat sent some of the pieces flying across the floor, and Cas was shocked to realise that their formation looked vaguely like a 'H'.
"And now you've remembered," Cas reminded him patiently. "I made you a promise, remember," he reached out to slip the ring off Dean's finger, spinning it until he could read the Enochian engraving.
"I know that look," Claire groaned, "you think I'm in denial." Dean had no idea how she'd read him so well, but he couldn't actually argue. She was right after all. "But I'm not. I know Cas isn't dead. I just know it."
"He called last week," Dean sighed, "The parents want a family dinner this Friday."
Well, from the look of things he managed it.
Nope. Right now it was just Dean and Cas, Cas and Dean, and they were amazing together.
"Yeah," Cas nodded, slowly lowering the mirror to his lap. "Thank you, Dean."
"We've missed you," Jo tried, and that was it. The final blow.
It was an uncomfortable feeling, even if he knew Sam and Dean would never hurt him, and would never let him get into any situations where someone else would be able to hurt him. He'd been around longer than Earth itself, had spent millennia looking after himself, and humanity, had fought demons and protected Heaven.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, watching as Jo managed to convince Sam to join them dancing, his brother flailing around with a sparkle in his eyes and a fake frown on his face. Charlie looked as though she could barely even breathe through her giggles, and Jo was about a moment away from falling over. The adults were being a little less crazy—though only just, the alcohol was doing that to them—but there was laughter all around camp and it put a grin on Dean’s face. "Yeah, they are."
Thanks or reading!!!
Maybe staying as a cat forever wouldn't be as much of a loss as he had always thought.
"It was good," Dean nodded, following Cas back into their cabin. "I saw some birds, a deer even came over to see me."
And this one even has some new characters in it!!
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, I haven't actually," Dean murmured, "have you?" He didn't actually care—in the slightest—but it seemed like the polite way to continue the conversation which he really wanted to end already.
The big top exploded with applause as Dean and Baby bowed. They'd been working on this routine for months, and clearly, it had paid off. Dean patted Baby's sweaty haunches, wiping his own forehead with his forearm as he bowed once more and then walked out of the ring.
I think you guys will like this chapter... 😄😄
Also... This is barely edited. I'm sorry, I'm tired, I had a quick read through and didn't see any mistakes, but I was skimming, so please point it out if I missed something so I can fix it.
"Couldn't sleep," Dean sighed, "what about you?" He hoped that talking to Cas would help him relax and finally allow him to sleep.
"Look, Dean, this is going to sound out of nowhere, and I'm sorry about that," Cas said, awkwardly fiddling with the hem of his shirt, "but… would you be interested in meeting up with me, outside of your work?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's a good car," Cas replied, sounding amused, and when Dean turned his head to look at him, he felt his breath fly away.
Oh wow! Thank you everyone for the comments on last chapter! I hope this chapter is worth the wait!
"If you'd just told me," Cas whispered, "we could have faced it together. It was in the vows, Dean. Your career causing problems wouldn't have made you a burden."
He carefully put it down on the side, deciding he would just leave it here and let the owners of the motel decide what to do, and packed up his bags; he was heading back to the bunker today and couldn't wait to be back in the clean bunker, with the full kitchen and his memory foam bed and his… His…  a memory of warmth, blue and birds(?) flashed through his mind but as soon as it was there, it was gone. Dean shook the feeling of cobwebs out of his head and finished throwing his stuff in his duffel, starting to the door. He barely got halfway across the room before he froze.
He carefully leaned back, stretching his back when it complained—apparently it had felt the hours passing, even if Dean hadn't.
"Yes please," Cas whispered, turning when Dean pushed his shoulder—carefully so he didn't touch the sore skin of Cas' back—until his back was facing the large mirror Dean had on the wall. Dean silently passed him the hand-held mirror, holding his breath as he waited for the other man to see what he had done. He had a last minute burst of fear that Cas would hate it, but it was too late to turn back now.
"Hey, Dean," a painfully familiar voice muttered from just next to him. He hadn't heard anyone approach, so he jumped, first in surprise, and then the moment he got over that, he felt horror spread through his blood.
"You understand why I have a hard time believing that, don't you?"
It definitely wasn't dying anymore. It’s leaves bright and green, slowly snaking its way towards the ceiling under Cas’ command.
"You mean we might not be able to fix it? I might lose you?"
I'm sure you did," Dean replied, "have you changed your mind about coloring since you were last in?"
Dean was late to lunch. It was only by ten minutes, but it might as well have been six years with the way Mary had reacted when he'd finally walked in. He'd wanted to say sorry, that it was an accident, maybe he'd lost track of time, but none of that would be true. He'd been late on purpose, because sitting in the living room talking to his dad while his mom cooked was probably on his top ten list of least favorite activities.
Dean put his sketchbook away when he reached an okay stopping point. He had the general shape of the wings planned out, but he had a job to do and although this design was a part of it, so was doing the actual tattooing of his customers. He shook the cramp that had started forming out of his arms and legs, and walked out into the waiting area. Cas was only just leaving, so either Dean hadn’t been sketching for as long as he’d thought, or Cas had spent some time talking to Claire on his way out. He waved as he walked out the front door, and Dean returned it with a soft smile, noticing how Cas hunched his shoulders, as though he was expecting a weight that wasn’t there.
"Yes?"
"Hey, Cas," Dean replied, squeezing back before shuffling backwards a couple of steps to put a more reasonable distance between them. There were still camera flashes and yelling coming from all sides, but in that moment Castiel was focused on Dean's eyes and what he could see in them. Dean was planning something, and Castiel had no idea what it could be. Dean had gotten a lot better at talking to him since what had happened during the filming of
Cas was outside when Dean reached the cabin, talking to one of the trees and glowing in the glow of the sun through the leaves above them. Apparently, talking to trees was an angel thing, but Dean had the feeling it was just a Cas' thing. Just one more example of how perfect Cas was.
He was wearing jeans and a t-shirt, more casual than Dean had ever seen him before, but with a certain confidence in his own skin that was almost visible around him. His hair was messy, as always, but there was something about him…
It was only going to get better from here.
Dean was left with the custard-filled donut, which he happily grabbed before ditching the box in the trash bin just inside the door, and leaning back against the wall. He would head to his station to set up for the morning once he was done eating.
"Dean, you were forced to overwork yourself because he threatened someone you love. That sounds like suffering to me."
"Why can't you take no for an answer," Dean sighed. He wasn't actually mad, he knew Jo just wanted the best for him. It didn't stop it from being annoying.
"I'll always care."
With movements made certain from familiarity, Dean handed Sam Baby's reins and headed out to the back of the tent, beelining for the spot he'd scouted out when they'd first assembled the big top, which would give him the best view.
Where it is time for things to go horribly wrong, and we get some more answers about Cas' past.
“Watch it,” Dean answered, starting back up again with the line work, “I promise you will not regret it.”
The food was delicious, which unfortunately was the only good thing about this whole thing, but it was impossible to enjoy it when he knew any moment now his parents would start aiming for the throat.
"You have?"
It wasn’t Earth shattering, not in the way Cas had been promised for so many years. There were no fireworks, no animals singing and dancing around them, nor did the entire world stop spinning.
Until then!! <3 <3 <3
And then they were kissing again, their lips moving as one as love and promises wordlessly passed between them.
"Same old," Lisa waved his question off. "So, how has single life been treating you? Have you met anyone yet?"
"I'm not doing it."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I hope you like picnics," Cas replied, nodding into the backseat. When Dean twisted around he found a folded picnic blanket and a large picnic basket.
"That's- that's kind of creepy you know," Dean muttered sitting up in his bed so he could look at his roommate.
Enjoy!!
"Well I can't have a half asleep piercer, can I," Dean chuckled, "people aren't paying for wonky, uneven, holes in their ears." If looks could kill, Dean would be dead, but Charlie didn't actually try to argue.
Hope you enjoyed!
Dean nodded, grabbing his plate and dropping down next to Cas, curling into his side and eating his pie while Cas continued growing the plant under John’s watchful eye, listening to his tips and adjusting when he was told to.
"Thanks Brother," Benny grinned, licking the jelly from his lips, and his fangs, "you always know how to make waking up on a Monday morning worth it." There was nothing between Dean and Benny, though Dean couldn't help but feel that in another time, in another place, there could be. Regardless, in this time and this place the vampire was just a friend, and Dean was more than happy with that.
"No, Dean," Garth said with a surprising amount of seriousness for the normally bright werewolf. "That wasn't your fault. You didn't ask her to come over and talk to you."
Gabriel and Balthazar couldn't even get more than a quick grin out of him, and that was when they showed him their newest—and even Dean could admit, funniest—routine. Sam had found some new and exciting books, Jo had shown him her new knives, Charlie had taught him how to breathe fire. Still no dice.
Where a single golden band sat on his ring finger.
It just didn't add up.
“I do,” Dean said with a small blush on his face. How on earth was Cas this perfect?
The room was silent after that, except for Dean's labored breathing. Castiel was sure the entire hotel could hear how loudly his heart was beating. His eyes were wide and he had the feeling he'd forgotten how to blink. Dean's explanation was causing butterflies and snakes to writhe in his stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why not?"
"How's Sam?" Benny asked, a squint on his face. The vampire was annoyingly good at reading people, and seeing as the coming family dinner had been a weight on Dean's shoulder since he found out about it, he wasn't surprised that Benny had picked up.
"No," Dean hums, his shifting making their bare arms brush for just a millisecond before he shifted away again, Castiel feeling the brush of skin like a brand. "It's subtle, just a part of nature really. I wouldn't be surprised if your bound magic couldn't sense it."
"You know the drill," Dean grinned, grabbing the gun and picking out the first color. This was not Pam's first rodeo, and she relaxed easily under the buzzing of the gun. They didn't talk much, though Pam didn't stop her occasional flirty remarks.
“Everyone seems happy,” Cas murmured, coming to join him, dressed in his baggy pajama pants and a loose t-shirt. It wasn’t like the circus had been unhappy the last few weeks, but there had been a cloud hanging around ever since their previous ring-leader—Chuck—had left, in order to pursue a career in writing. Dean had never been a big fan of the guy, but he’d been a good ring-leader, and things were different without him. It was always weird when people left, they were such a tight knit family, so whenever people moved on, or new people joined, it was a noticeable change. They, as a group, didn’t do well with change.
"Alright, Cas," he murmured, stripping his gloves off and reaching for the large hand held mirror. "Are you ready?"
Dean let out a relieved breath of air, a small smile stretching across his face just from the thought of it.
Hi guys! Sorry about the unexpected break, my laptop decided it hated me and broke. I had this fic on google docs (thank fuck) but I wasn't able to access a laptop in order to post until now. I will try and keep updates regular, but I'll have to see how things go.
It was home.
Obviously, not all of Dean’s qualities were good. He had small habits that annoyed the hell out of Cas—he always forgot to hang his wet towel up and hated vacuuming like the machine had personally insulted him. Dean always tried to do everything for everyone, ignoring that it was detrimental to his health, and only ended up wearing himself down until Cas would have to force him to stop. He never wanted to accept help, even when he needed it. No matter the situation, he would look for a reason that he wasn't deserving of being helped.
Cas fell.
"And that's why I love you."
"Yes you are, don't argue," Charlie interrupted, tapping Dean on the nose in a way that was probably friendly, but was really just annoying. Okay… that wasn't true. It was just a Charlie thing, and the fact it was annoying Dean right now said more about him than it did about Charlie. "You're doing walk-ins, right?"
It was safety.
"Hey, Cas!" he called as soon as he was close enough. "What're you doing out here?"
"Hey, Dean," she smiled, "Pamela is here for her color." Dean nodded, recognizing the busy—well, Dean didn't know, she'd never actually told Dean what her job was, but she was clearly busy—who Dean had done the line art for four weeks ago. She'd been too busy to come in for his next appointment until now, and Dean had actually been wondering if she'd ever turn back up.
Every single article he read was covering the exact same event—the premiere of the new Dean Winchester film, “Last Night On Earth,” which had been released the day before. His co-stars were all incredibly talented actors who complimented each other and their roles perfectly, and even without seeing it Castiel knew it was going to be as amazing as every single news site had been predicting since the roles had been cast. Though watching an amazing movie wasn't the main reason Cas was glad the premiere was over. After all, now that nearly all the promotion and the premiere were done, the actors could go home.
The week flew by, and before Dean had even noticed the weekend had started, it was Monday again. His day was much busier than the week before—by which he meant he actually had more than one appointment—and then his last one of the day was Cas' first proper appointment. They would be starting the line work today, as long as Cas liked Dean's design, and he was actually really excited. He adored the designs he'd drawn up, and although his opinion didn't really matter in this line of work, he hoped Cas would agree.
"And probably less so passive statements about how many leftovers they now have sitting in their refrigerator?"
"Are you hungry? Do you want to eat now or wait for a bit?" Dean didn't call him out on his not subtle at all topic change, just leaned back on his hands and seemed to carefully think about it.
Castiel headed to bed with a small smile on his face.
“Do you have any ideas for what you want?” Dean asked, pressing the pencil to the paper to start sketching whatever Cas described.
“Get off!” Sam squealed, wriggling out of Dean’s reach. His face was frowning, but his eyes were sparkling and Dean knew Sam understood everything Dean was saying without using his words.
"Another round?" Benny offered, taking their wordless cheer as a response as he grabbed their empty pitchers and took them back to the bar.
"Before I was born," Jack agreed, "when I showed Cas the perfect future. I didn't know they were married, but I knew Cas' perfect future involved having Dean by his side forever."
'Wedding' kisses.
"She looks good," Cas hummed, walking forward  to stroke Baby's head as soon as Dean stopped them both. "She's lucky to have you." It seemed like a strange conversation topic, especially seemingly out of nowhere, but Dean figured he'd take it.
"That just proves my point then," Dean shrugged, "you're an angel on the inside, and that's not going to change."
Thanks for reading!!!
He burst into tears straight away, and Dean was left awkwardly sitting on his stool with no idea what to do. He could never deal with people who cried, but… he wanted to help Cas, even though he didn't know how to.
Hope you enjoyed!!
This is it. The epilogue is here!!
(See the end of the chapter for
He felt even more exhausted than he had before, and he frowned all through the process of grabbing out his phone and setting a reminder for the dinner.
He didn't know why seeing what Cas looked like mattered so much, except…as soon as Cas had a face, he existed. Dean could have a face to put the name and the stories, and Cas could suddenly exist as more than a concept, and he wasn't sure he was ready for that.
I don't have a beta, so if you see any mistakes, please point them out in the comments so I can fix them.
This week has been... yeah... I'm wiped, I did edit this but I doubt I found everything so if you spot any mistakes please tell me so I can fix them, I hope you've all had a better week than I have... Sorry this Author note is all over the place...
"Well this is clearly about our parents," Dean hummed, thinking the options over. There weren't many. "Seeing as it's a Monday, I'd bet… family dinner some time soon?"
“What dream?” Claire asked, looking between Dean’s face and the picture he was holding in his hands.
Cas quietly purred his approval, deciding that out of all the names he could have ended up with, Whiskers wasn't the worst one out there.
He breathed deeply, already feeling the pull telling him to return to his witch's side. It would get better as their bond matured, and they’d be able to go longer apart without their bond screaming at them. He quickly dried his hands, not bothering to get them completely dry when he just wanted to get back to his witch, and unlocked the door, walking towards the living room where he could hear voices and smell pie, as well as feel Cas’ presence.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What about you, Dean?"
"Are you ready to get started on the line work?"
"Yes, and I think that actually, we're better together. I should have never broken up with you."
The others were all in a surprisingly good mood by the time he walked into the shop. He was running slightly late—the line at the coffee shop had been huge—but he thought he made up for it by bringing everyone a free coffee. He didn't know how the others would survive Monday mornings without him by this point.
He all but ran to the cafeteria, abandoning a sketch midway through. He made the excuse that he'd had an early breakfast and it wasn't exactly false, but wasn't the real reason he hurried, either. He was used to eating breakfast early, and being hungry had never made him rush away from his work before.
“No,” Cas said, and he didn’t sound like he understood how big a deal it was. He had never seen Star Wars. How did someone manage to get that far through life, and never watch Star Wars?
The weeks flew by and before Dean knew it, it was time for Cas' final appointment. It felt like just yesterday that Cas had walked into Inked Dreams, hoping to have the scars on his back covered, and now they were here. He couldn't stop the slight disappointment in his chest at the thought of never seeing Cas again, though he was glad he'd been able to help the angel's confidence with his art, and he hoped that if he just ignored the heavy feelings, they would go away—hopefully sooner than later.
"It's just so nice to have everyone all together again," Mary smiled, either not noticing or just ignoring the tension which filled the house everytime they did a family get-together. "You boys really should come over more often!"
Luckily for Dean, tracking Cas down had become something of a skill of his own.
Cas was breathtaking.
"Did you have a good weekend?" Dean asked once everything was done, leading Cas back to his station—though he betted the other guy knew the way off by heart by now.
"I love it," Cas whispered, staring into the mirror as though he would die if he looked away for just a moment. "I'm an angel again."
His mind was racing, jumping from one topic to another, enough thoughts bubbling up that Dean couldn't even begin to relax enough to sleep, never mind actually fall asleep. And to make things even worse, his back ached. It was probably from spending so many hours hunched over a book studying, but whatever the reason was, it was not helping him fall asleep at all.
He opened his eyes, looking around the dark room, hoping that some visual input would help calm his thoughts, and nearly screamed when he made eye contact with some glowing orbs on the other side of the room.
"That's good. I'm really excited to see what you've designed." Dean smiled, and Cas knew his husband well enough to tell that he was being completely sincere.
“No I’m-” Cas didn’t have time to finish his sentence before the tingling evolved into burning, and his vision blacked out. He could hear screaming, but couldn’t figure out if it was coming from himself or someone else, the only thing he was focused on was the feeling of his vessel breaking, stretching, twisting.
It was love.
Wow guys!! I just want to thank everyone who commented on the last chapter, I love you all and your comments were amazing!!
Thanks for reading!! I'll see you next week!! Hopefully on time this time!!
Cas started feeling weird from almost as soon as Dean’s love confession dripped off his tongue, a strange tingling feeling spreading across his skin and a fuzziness appearing in his vision, but he ignored it, focused more on the more important things, namely, Dean.
"Getting a bit explicit there aren't you," Dean said, trying to reduce the tension but failing miserably.
"Can we please get through one dinner without you having a go at me over my job?" Dean pleaded, already feeling a headache start to form. He'd only just arrived, and it was already going awfully.
"Why were you being so reckless?" Dean asked later when they had both calmed down, gently squeezing Cas' hand in between them. "You're normally so careful, but recently-" he couldn't finish, his throat squeezing just from the memory of it.
"I'm doing okay." Dean replied non-committedly. "How about you?"
"I forgot you!" Dean hissed back, pulling at his hair so it stung. "I forgot this, I forgot us!" Dean was aware of the others in the room, but he didn't care. This was important.
Cas: Would you like to go on a date with me?
He'd never kissed Cas before, but this was familiar, grounding. Their lips knew each other and moved in sync.
There is slight misgendering here. It's only once, and the person who does it instantly apologises, but yeah, just to warn you guys.
Castiel chucked as he reached into the rucksack he'd been wearing, pulling out a couple of containers of food they'd brought. Dean had been carrying the water and the dessert - leftover cake from Charlie's visit - and so he grabbed the water out while leaving the rest in there for later. Castiel couldn't help the smile that spread across his face when he opened up the food, handing some to Dean who accepted it like it was Michelin star quality, instead of just a sandwich Castiel had thrown together with the contents of his fridge.
“I spent all of your childhood telling you about how you would find your witch, and that she would be perfect for you, and yet I never for a moment thought your witch could be a he.” Dean winced. Yeah, he understood that no one had seen this coming, he didn’t really want a conversation about how much he had surprised everyone. “I always assumed that your witch would be a girl, and I’m sorry. I can’t even imagine how hard that must have been for you. Did you have any idea he would be a man before you found him?”
I hope some Charlie makes up for it!!
Have an awesome week!! And I'll see you next time!! Hopefully on time this time...
"Oh, I had to collect something," Cas said with a small smile. Without even registering why, Dean looked down at Cas' hand.
One final flip and Cas was back on the ground, smiling widely while the crowd made their appreciation known, and Dean knew it was time for him to head back. He ran quickly, slipping back to Sam's side before Cas had time to even leave the ring. He slipped onto Baby's back and leaned over to slap Cas on the back when he returned, congratulating him on a job well done. And then it was time for their final parade, no time for lingering when they had a show to complete.
"Come on, Dean!" Jo whined, grinning up at Dean—she already knew she'd won.
Have an awesome week!! <3
The only thing they didn't bring up during serving was Dean's job, but he already knew that was just because they were holding that one back for later in the day.
"Good for you, Brother," Benny said, "he makes you happy?"
"Good morning Dean," Cas smiled warmly, lightly running his fingers through Dean's light hair, twisting a strand around his finger.
"And do you have a soul?"
There were lips pressed against his the moment he was through the curtain, hands gripping his hair and the back of his neck as they devoured him. And then Cas was pulling away, whispering "good job" against his lips, and slipping through the curtains for his own act.
"You spent time with her willingly. She wanted to sleep with you, and maybe you said no, but that still doesn't explain that bit."
"Why are you awake?" Cas asked quietly, shifting again but this time Dean could just about see his silhouette sitting up.
Cas opened his mouth as though he was about to say something, but he chuckled and tried again. "I also have a dog," Cas said with a small shrug. "His name is Gabe, short for Gabriel. I've had him since I was small."
"Dean," Lisa tried, but Dean just turned his attention to Jo—though there really wasn't anything for them to say right now—until Benny managed to convince Lisa that leaving was probably the best decision.
Dean didn't wait any longer, he sprinted back round the tent to stand with the other performers and wrapped Cas into a tight hug as soon as he joined them.
"Thanks, guys," Cas grinned, picking up his lunch and slowly following Dean out to his trailer. They settled at Dean's small table, their legs tangled together as they started eating.
"Because-" Dean had never thought he would ever do this, had expected to keep this his little secret forever… but it seemed he was wrong. Cas looked so scared and uncertain, and Dean refused to let that continue. "-because I love you, Cas."
"Fine," Dean groaned, "I'll
"Just doing my job," Dean grinned, "but for the record, you deserve to be feeling good about yourself, and if my art is helping, then I'm thankful you chose to come here to get your tattoo."
“What is it?” he asked her, already feeling exhausted. When Charlie was restraining herself, you just knew it was going to be something bad.
And I am back! I know it's only been a week.. but it feels like longer!
Garth was always hungry after a transformation, and had been known to eat whatever was in the fridge—even if it had been there since before the weekend.
Marvelous Cas, who for some reason couldn't see what Dean could.
Dean quickly threw himself back up onto Baby's back, though he kept Cas in his peripheral vision for the entire time, just in case he needed any help.
Castiel laughed, a mixture of surprise and actual entertainment, while his eyes drifted towards Dean without his permission. "I might get in trouble for telling you this," he said, matching her tone as much as he could, "so I won't give you many details, but yes, there was a little bit of drama going on."
Soft smile, dark messy hair, ugly beige trench coat that somehow suited him.
"Nice." Dean laughed mentally, carefully making sure to keep his hands steady even while he couldn't hold his smile back. What were the chances?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well fuck that!" Dean all but yelled, his patience running thin. He was worried, he was tired, he was on edge, and he couldn't hold back his words anymore. "Fuck all of that! Just talk to me, dammit! I’m your friend, I just want to help.”
Tell me what you thought in the comments!!
*Sighs in disappointment at myself*
And then, after Cas had had a bit of time to get used to the gun, he started to talk.
It took Cas a couple of minutes, but finally he picked the largest pair of wings—which would go from his shoulders to his hips, looking like they were connected either side of his spine and going across his arms—with blue watercolor which ranged from black to very light blue, and a variety of rainbow flowers and green vibes where the wings connected to his back. Dean was pretty proud of it, and was looking forward to seeing what it would look like when it was on Cas.
—and then Cas turned around.
"Come here!" Jo gestured wildly. "I'll tell you when everyone is here!"
"Let me guess," Dean drawled, "I've not been myself." She wasn't wrong, he'd been… off, ever since Lisa broke up with him, but it wasn't whatever Charlie was suggesting. He was happy, a random cute customer wasn't going to change anything to do with that. He was happy right where he was, with the life he led.
“When you say weird,” Claire continued, “do you mean you rode unicorns and ran away from your neighbours-”
"Why were you trying to track me down?" Cas asked, his head rolling to the side so he could look at Dean, though he had no idea how Cas could possibly look away from the beauty of the sky.
Castiel froze for a moment. That was… a lot more upfront than he had been expecting. How on earth was he supposed to answer that? Well… 'no,' of course… but that wasn't the point. They still had to work together so he couldn't exactly be rude, however much he wanted to be.
Dean loved his job and he loved his tattoos and he loved his piercings and he didn't care what other people thought. Even if it did still sting. He should be used to it by now, but it was something he still struggled with.
He landed fairly heavily in the warehouse, the noise echoing around the abandoned space, his speedy flight taking away any chance for a graceful entrance, or a sneak attack. His landing was loud enough for the witch—who had been staring at the only entrance, clearly waiting for the Winchesters to turn up—to spin around, her shock at seeing him enough to slow her down for a moment. Clearly she hadn’t expected an angel of the lord to appear in the middle of her ambush, but then again, why would she have? She wasn’t exactly knowledgeable in the politics of Heaven and Hell, and although she had probably heard about Castiel and the Winchesters, she had probably seen Sam and Dean doing this hunt alone, and had assumed that Castiel was just not helping them with this one.
"Sam, I'm allergic to cats, remember," Dean sighed.
They were going to have a future together, Dean knew it, and he couldn't wait.
Not at all.
with those donuts. The talks his friends had insisted on had drained him, and it had honestly felt at some points like the day would never end.
Small apartment? His mom made at least three snide comments about how much room their house had, and how maybe if Dean needed more space he could move back home, 'until he could afford a better one of his own'.
"Yeah, alright." Dean sighed, looking deflated for just long enough to get his point across before he perked right back up. "Alright then, shall we go inside?"
"I slipped a bit," Cas shrugged, seemingly unaffected. "Dean must have seen- somehow."
Hopefully you enjoyed that!!
Some people even suggested it was Jo, which had just made Castiel smile even more into the sip of whiskey he'd been taking when he read it. Just the thought of Dean and Jo being together—nevermind Jo being the one who had given Dean his hickey—was hilarious. Jo was basically Dean's little sister; they’d grown up together, and although Dean and she did have something at one point, that was over long before either of them were famous. It was so long ago, it had been before Cas and Dean had become anywhere close to
Take Cas for example. Dean didn't know his story, but covering up his scars was clearly helping him, and Dean was glad about that. He was glad he could help, he was glad his art had an ability to help people, he was glad that he had decided to become a tattoo artist despite everyone telling him to do otherwise.
Have an awesome week!!
“I love you,” Cas mouthed, which Dean replied with gusto, and then  Cas was off again, flipping upright and continuing on with his routine, enchanting the crowd with his every movement. He flew through the air like an angel, like this was where he was destined to be.
A quiet "oh" echoed through the room, before Cas blinked, the glow disappearing for a moment before reappearing, leaving Dean wondering how thick Cas' eyelids must be to cut off the glow. He also wondered what was causing them to glow, did they have their own light source? Were they reflecting the moonlight? Could Cas turn them on and off? He couldn't seem to stop himself from mentally going through all the creatures he could think of, trying to figure out which ones had glowy eyes, but none came to mind.
Nice.
“I love him you know,” Dean whispered, “he’s the best thing that ever happened to me, I just wish I could find a way to tell him that. I’ve tried, but I’m always too much of a coward.”
"I suppose I have been distracted," Cas relented, "but it's my burden to bear, there is no point letting it weigh on you too."
"I'm not sneezing, don't even feel a tickle," Dean said, starting to scratch Cas behind the ear. Cas' purring got louder against his will, apparently despite actually being an angel, he still had cat mannerisms. "I guess it's not the ugliest creature I've ever seen, and it seems pretty well behaved." It wasn't the best compliment Cas had ever been given, but coming from Dean it might as well have been award winning poetry.
“Doesn’t mean I can’t tell when a guy is cute,” Charlie pointed out, “and the fact you even tried that just proves you agree with me.”
“You love me?” Cas blurted out, watching as Dean’s soul rippled. It didn’t look like he was lying, but this was way too perfect to be real.
"You-" Castiel's mouth dropped open, his thoughts racing a mile a minute to try and catch up with everything Dean just said. "You thought I wanted to leave? Because you aren’t ready to be out to the world yet?"
I hope you have an awesome week!! And I'll see you next time!!
“Well, they’re kind of fluffy,” Dean started slowly, sinking his fingers into Cas' fur, "we could call them-"
He grabbed his phone out, planning to call Sam. He wasn't going to ask about the ring, it was probably nothing after all—it was definitely not nothing, but denial was probably the best course of action right now—but he felt the need to talk to his brother. Check-in maybe. See if he knew what was going on.
Castiel waited until it had completely faded before he tried to move again, not wanting to risk setting off a new domino pile which would just end in more pain. There was a gentle hand running through his hair, and it took him a few moments of just enjoying the touch before he realised it.
"I'm your best friend!" Charlie muttered, her slitted eyes watching Dean carefully as though she would be able to see what he was thinking if she just looked hard enough. "This isn't still about the Lisa thing is it?"
Castiel had no idea exactly what happened next. One moment, he'd been about to  head inside to watch the premiere of
"Stop that, Cas. You didn't know, I didn't tell you. I'm the one at fault here."
"Great! Can we have waffles for breakfast?"
"What do you mean?" Dean sighed, scratching the vine tattoo that wrapped around his right arm. He loved having such close friends, that was true, but he absolutely hated the fact it meant they could read him so well. He'd known Charlie for years, and told her all his deepest darkest secrets, and now she definitely knew too much.
Thanks for reading!! You guys are the best! Have a great week!! <3
"Hopefully it will taste as good as it looks," John said, his joke falling flat as they all re-took their seats at the table.
“I love you too Dean,” Cas whispered, not noticing that he had said it out loud until Dean was shooting upright, causing Cas to crumple into his lap while Dean’s green eyes darted around the empty room as though his friend was going to step out of the shadows.
"I mean, this isn't still you thinking that just because Lisa couldn't see how amazing you are, no one will ever see it."
Dean instantly knew where she was going with that, and he instantly hated it. “You’re a lesbian.”
The camp was a flurry of activity for most of the night. It was their first day in the new town, and although they’d unpacked everything the day before, they still had some settling in to do, as well as lots of celebrating. A successful first night was always a reason to celebrate—not that they needed a reason. The circus parties were always the best parties, and Dean was more than happy to take a glass of something alcoholic and lean against the nearest caravan, watching the dancing around the fire.
Dean should have never been in that situation. Cas should have noticed something first, or said something earlier, or anything, really. But it did mean a lot to Cas, how much Dean was willing to do to protect him.
His left hand.
He had woken up that morning after a good night's sleep, his husband curled up in his arms, and they had eaten some breakfast together before Castiel had to head in—Dean was going to be coming to set later—and the entire day was just looking so bright. There still seemed to be
They left the room again approximately three hours after they'd first arrived, Cas moving slightly gingerly due to his sore back, and Dean keeping an eye on him to make sure he didn't have to force Cas to sit down for a few minutes.
Cas froze in place. They were giant, and when they were talking about a cat… they were talking about him? He reached one of his hands out, his eyes going impossibly wide when instead of the hand he'd grown used to seeing, there was a pure black fluffy paw.
"I've always loved art," Dean said, and he would have shrugged if he hadn't been midline. "As soon as I found out it existed, I knew it was what I wanted to be."
Hope you enjoyed!!
"You've not!" Charlie growled, her eyes flashing with annoyance. It must count as a skill by this point, how easily Dean managed to annoy Charlie. "You don't seem to trust yourself! You're lonely! Even when you try your best to convince yourself you're not. You ache for someone to love, but deny yourself the chance to go looking for it!"
At first, he thought it could be the fact Sam wasn't there, but even as he thought it he brushed that option away. It definitely wasn't that. Dean was on a hunt after all. It wasn't weird enough for him to go on solo hunts, he'd been doing them since he was twenty-one and even if most of the time he and Sam stuck together, it didn't happen rarely enough to equate to the weird feeling he was getting.
He was missing something … he just knew it! But what?
This red carpet was for the premiere of
Enjoy!!
Dean didn't even hear Cas get down from his silks, but he must have because next thing Dean knew he was leaning against the barrier watching Dean and Baby with a piercing gaze.
He walked through the gate to the area which had been given to the wardrobe team. Hannah was already there, looking at some of the designs Castiel had already finished and tapping away at her tablet, probably ordering the fabrics or checking availability in case he had to change anything. She was the head of the sewing team, and would be one of the people helping to bring Castiel's dreams to life.
Thanks for reading!!
"Oh, the lunchtimes?" Dean clarified, waiting for Cas to nod. "Just working lunches between 'friends,' I swear. She might have had an ulterior motive, but I just thought she wanted to use the time to go over the script."
And by this point, he stopped showing them when he got something new, but he didn't miss the looks they gave him every time they met up, the looks of disappointment that cut deeper than Dean had ever thought possible.
“You didn’t-” Cas started, but he cut himself off. Dean had made things worse, even if his heart had been in the right place. "I'm sorry I couldn't help you with this," he said quietly, "Even if it’s because you didn’t talk to me. But I promise, now that I know, I'll help you figure out how to get free of your agent. I think we’ll be able to get past this and you won't have to suffer in silence again."
"Okay," the man nodded, stiffly taking a seat on the leather chair. "I'm Castiel," he winced slightly at his own full name, adding quickly, "most people call me Cas." Dean made a mental note to use the nickname; he was not in the mood for making the guy even more uncomfortable than he already looked.
Dean had never understood his parent's hatred for his job. Sure, he was an elf, but he didn't understand how that had anything to do with his ability to be a tattoo artist. And likewise, he didn't understand how being a tattoo artist had anything to do with his species. Maybe he wasn't saving any forests, but he was helping people! He had nature in his blood, and he used it for good.
He read over the writing carefully. It wasn't messy like his own scrawl, instead it was perfectly legible, clearly not written in a hurry. One one sheet there was a list of names and addresses, what Dean could only assume was a list of all the victims, and what looked like directions on the other. He couldn't remember what they were directions to, but they were clearly important if they had their own sheet of paper.
"Smells good," Dean called, taking the wooden steps two at a time and wrapping his arms around Cas the moment he was close enough. They shared a chaste kiss before Cas answered, the angel pulling away to talk before Dean had a chance to deepen it.
"Don't even try that. You might want to pretend you don't care about what your parents say, but I know you Dean Winchester."
Anyway! I'll see you all next chapter, whenever that is!
Dean was a jittery mess by the time Friday came around. He was so excited, but at the same time… he was terrified. What if he messed it up? What if he scared Cas off? What if he ruined everything?
The first thing he saw was two pieces of paper, both written in shitty blue ink—the kind which could only come from the shitty pens motels always left out on the desks—in handwriting he didn't recognise. Dean could only guess that it was trustworthy information, he didn't even know where he'd got it from after all, but it was neat handwriting, and it was with the rest of his case notes… in a warded duffel. If it was in his bag, it was because he'd put it there, so he just had to hope that the past-him he couldn't remember hadn't decided it was untrustworthy, and then kept it by accident.
Castiel felt like Dean had something more he wanted to say, but he didn't really want to hear it. He didn't want their trip to the lake ruined by the somber mood that was descending over their blanket, so he quickly changed the subject, hoping that Dean wouldn't try to keep them there.
Have an awesome week, and I'll see you with a new chapter... at the weekend probably!!!
"Yes, I really am," Cas nodded, a grin spreading across his face as he too looked out across camp.
"If you're about to say anything along the line of fluff, then stop right there," Sam interrupted. "We are not giving this poor cat a name like that."
But it was perfect.
"My favorite everything," Dean agreed, leaning in to press a kiss to Cas' lips which the angel deepened.
"No problem," Jo replied, and Dean knew she had understood. They shared a smile, before both of them had to head back to work.
It was the sixteenth of June. Dean knew his phone was right, knew there was no way it had the date wrong but…
Castiel grinned as his driver drove them onto set, a folder filled with designs sitting on the back seat next to him. A rock song was on the radio, one of the ones that Cas couldn't name but knew every word of, thanks to Dean. Everything just seemed so good this morning.
Things were pretty good, and he was so glad he'd had the idea to come here, and even more glad that Dean had agreed.
"I love you, too," Castiel smiled, stepping out the trailer and walking down the stairs with a spring in his step as he headed back to his studio. Who cared if Hannah kept flirting with him? He had a husband who loved him, and that's all that really mattered.
Castiel chuckled quietly, “It’s too light for a start,” it was too dark to see, but Dean was fairly sure Cas was counting the reasons off on his fingers, “people are loud, my bed is comfy, I can’t stay with m-” Cas stopped suddenly, cutting himself off to another laugh, this one a bit more nervous that before. “I mean- I have to stop reading my book.”
Dean laughed, the sound watery and at least a little sad. “I bet you’d be telling me off right now if you could speak English,” a few more tears were slipping down Dean’s cheeks, a small cat obviously didn’t count as enough of an audience for him to feel the need to hide his emotions, but he was doing slightly better, Cas could feel the turmoil in his soul calming just a little bit.
Wait… no. It wasn’t nice. It wasn’t pleasant. He couldn’t hold on to any of his thoughts. They were slipping away, even as he tried to cling to them. It wasn’t like anything he’d ever experienced before,  like his thoughts were being sucked out of his head or something. The closest comparison Castiel could think of was all the times Naomi had mindwiped him.  If he was human he’d probably be feeling sea sick by now, but angels didn’t feel sea sick. There was probably some other reason that he could feel his stomach rolling and he felt like he was going to throw-up.
"You! With who?" Jo asked, looking genuinely excited. "Why haven't you mentioned this before now!"
"I will," Dean promised, feeling insanely thankful when the door opened, blocking off any more conversation. Dean was even more thankful when he saw it was Cas who had just walked in, looking much more comfortable than he had the week before.
Also just... sorry this is a day late... life is crazy atm, more about that in the end notes though. Enjoy the chapter!!
“Everything was emptiness except for me and a long figure, who I’ve now realized is Cas, so I think you can categorize that yourself.”
"Are you ready to continue?" Dean asked after a moment of quiet, both of them basking in the mood they had created.
"Dean, what the hell is going on with you?" Jo asked with a frown while Dean continued to fidget and shift his weight, unable to stand still for even a moment.
Judging from the height of the eyes, Cas was lying in bed, facing Dean, and unless he was going insane, staring at Dean's bed. He hadn't blinked - well, the glow hadn't changed, but same thing - since Dean had first seen him there, and Dean was getting increasingly concerned that he didn't have to.
“You couldn’t have known,” Dean tries weakly.
"I'd like that," Dean whispered, burying his face into Castiel's shoulder. "We always work best as a team."
Dean rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, spinning to look at Cas mid-stride and stare into his eyes as he started talking. "I didn't sleep with her, or anything like that. She's been trying to get me to date her, or at least sleep with her, for years now. I should have told you, but I didn’t want you to worry, I know what you’re like. I just-” he laughed, the sound almost bitter, “I thought it was just a part of the job. I’ve been so stupid. I promise you, though, I've always refused. Apparently not even having a significant other was enough to stop her from trying, though."

But it was the fourteenth last time he checked the date.
Even now, he smiled happily every time he thought about all their compliments and overwhelming support, and how much they loved Cas. Dean had never had a family who made him feel like his art was good before, and it was unreal to have it now he did.
to be a tattoo artist." Mary muttered, but she stopped after that.
"What?" he asked, feeling self conscious.
"Oh, yeah," Dean stared at the grass. He knew he could never completely understand how Cas was feeling, but he could picture why he was hurting. The world wasn't a nice place to anyone who was different, and even if it wasn't actually hurting anyone, some people would have a problem with it regardless. "I'm sorry you have to deal with that."
Out of the entire circus, not one single person had seen him.
"Why?" Cas' voice cracked, as he tumbled backwards until there was space between them. His eyes were wide and he looked like he was about to cry.
He didn't really want to be thinking about all that this early in the morning, a slight cloud of sleep still hovering over him, especially not right now, with Dean a warm weight in his arms enough to make him almost want to agree with everything Charlie had said.
Sam and Dean made eye contact, a feeling of discomfort and comradeship passing between them in a single look.
"A picnic at a lake," Dean smiled, his eyes taking on a slightly hazy hue in the way they always did when he was thinking about the past, "that sounds lovely. I'd love to go." There was a slight hesitancy in Dean's voice, the kind which told Castiel that Dean had almost definitely never done that kind of thing before, even if he'd wanted to.
Hope you enjoy!!!
"Good," Jo grinned, "now come on! We have drinks to drink!"
He couldn't think of any other reason for it, or maybe he just couldn't remember, either way, it was the only option Dean's mind was suggesting, and it certainly felt like the most likely one.
“Huh, you seem pretty opinionated about that Whiskers,” Dean laughed, scratching under Cas’ chin, “I guess I should trust you shouldn’t I? I bet you’re better with emotions than I am.” His quiet laughs jostled Cas a little but, but Dean's hand on his back kept him stable, and Cas didn’t even try to hold in the pleased purr which escaped him. As long as Dean was happy, he was happy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Their other friends quickly appeared from the back of the store, grins on their faces as they grabbed the donuts Dean had expected from the moment he bought them. Benny picked the jelly-filled one, Jo grabbed the powdered one, Garth grabbed the weird bacon one which certain people swore by, but not even Dean — Mr. Bacon — dared to try. Claire was the last to reach him, grabbing her glazed donut with a happy hum which made her blonde wings ripple in what Dean now recognized as joy. Their resident teenage angel was working as their receptionist for now, but as soon as she gets her licence she will join their store as Dean's intern.
The flashbulbs continued to pop, and it stole Cas' breath to remember that every single one of them belonged to someone trying to catch a picture of Dean, of Castiel's husband.
But he wanted to.
He washed his hands and resteralized his equipment—though he didn't expect to be using it for this appointment—leaving his sketchbook on the side with a freshly sharpened pencil, and then headed out to see whether his next appointment was already there. He was a minute or two early, but Dean had never heard anyone complain about getting in early.
He'd had a crush on Cas since he'd first turned up as a bumbling teenager with an armful of silk and a desire to be more. More than he was, more than he could be, more even, than the laws of gravity forced him to be. Dean had been little more than a child himself, a year younger, and already hoping that one day they would let him perform in the ring with the tricks he'd taught Baby. The moment he had laid eyes on the other boy…
"I didn't do anything."
"Your dream can't mean nothing," Claire said, and she looked so hopeful that Dean couldn't bring himself to point out that it was a dream, they very rarely meant anything. "Cas must still be alive somewhere! We can still get him back!"
"Weird, isn't it," Cas murmured, pulling his shirt off and turning his back so Dean could get a good look at his nearly complete tattoo. It was healing well between sessions, Cas was clearly following all the care instructions carefully, and Dean was pleased to admit that even not yet fully finished, it was already his best work ever.
Ten chapters to go! There is an end in the distance!
His husband was back tomorrow.
He was immeasurably glad when he checked the time and saw it was pretty much time for his consultation. He loved the freedom of designing a big piece, and loved the fact that a good ninety percent of the time it was only people who were serious about their tattoos that came in for consultations. Walk-ins were fine and all, but Dean hated the idea of tattoos, and especially his tattoos, being counted as mistakes in the future, and more than a few of his walk-ins gave off that air. The air of quickly-made decisions that seemed amazing at the time, but even as early as the next day started feeling like a mistake. Dean wasn’t immune to ideas like that, but he liked to think he thought things over well before he did them.
"I like music," Dean started, "and a couple of TV shows. Honestly, this job pretty much is my life right now."
"I got my memories back," Dean grinned.
"Can you tell us about them?"
Dean had over a week to psych himself up for it, thank goodness, but for now, all he wanted was to forget about it. He grabbed a beer from the fridge, and grabbed his pizza out. He'd eat this, and then he'd go to sleep, and hopefully the rest of the week would go easier.
Shortly after Dean reconnected with his extended family, he finally managed to cut himself off from his parents. He stopped going to their stupid fake happy family lunches, and although he sometimes felt slightly bad about it, Cas reminded him every time that he needed to do what was best for him, and this was what was best.
Unedited because I'm busy and tired. If you see any mistakes, please point them out so I can fix them.
"Sure," Castiel nodded, "I can do that."
"Yup!" Dean laughed, holding on to the straps of his rucksack as he walked alongside Cas. They headed off in the opposite direction to last time, heading away from the rest of civilization instead of towards it.
was. He knew there was someone in my life, way before the press did, and he threatened to  expose ‘her,’ to find a way to ruin ‘her’ life. But you are ‘her’ and I couldn't risk it. And now I'm rambling and I need to shut up."
"Thanks, Cas." He ran a hand down Baby's back, smiling at her happy whicker. "I'm lucky to have her."
Sam sighed, rubbing his legs where Cas had clawed him. “Alright then, I guess that’s a no on the sex thing. What should we call them?”
"Cas," Dean whispered, unable to find the words for what else to say. He couldn't imagine what Cas must have gone through. Angel wings were—they were fucking important. They played a role in every aspect of an angel's life. Dean didn't know all the details, but he'd spoken to Claire enough—and oh, that's probably why they knew each other so well—to know that people who weren't family weren't even allowed to
"How is that related at all?"
Enjoy!!
He'd been working on
"Is that what you do at night?"
"True," Dean chuckled.
"He really does," Dean smiled softly at his husband. Cas was the best thing that had ever happened to him, and he hated the fact he'd forgotten about him for so long. He'd forgotten the light of his life.
Cas meowed back. It was something he'd started doing recently. It made him feel better when he replied, even when he knew they didn't know what he was saying and normally ended up doing the exact opposite of what he’d just said.
“Why didn’t you talk to me about it all?”
Castiel shrugged, "sure we can." And if the way Dean looked at him in response to that was anything to go off, Castiel had the feeling he was helping plenty.
Enjoy! *Jazz hands*
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nothing Red, you know this," Dean sighed, "can we please stop talking about this? It's really none of your business after all."
“Sure thing,” Dean said, placing his sketchbook on the side and leaning back against his desk as he watched Cas get ready to leave. “Just arrange the next appointment with Claire on your way out, and it’ll all be good.”
Castiel flapped his wings as hard as he could, ignoring the ache which burned in his wings as he desperately flew to the falling down abandoned warehouse he knew the Winchesters were heading towards. They were there for a hunt and when they had prayed for him to come and help—just that morning—he hadn’t thought twice before telling them that he was sorry, but things were too busy in Heaven for him to take some time away to come and help them. It was a simple witch hunt, run of the mill, nothing they couldn’t do—and hadn’t done a million times before without his help—and he was seriously worried that if he left Heaven too long a new apocalypse would start. He’d lost count of how many they’d already had, but it was definitely in his—and the Winchesters—best interests to make sure that that total didn’t get increased any more.
"That we do."
And so long as nothing went disastrously wrong today—a shiver went down Dean's spine just at the thought of it—it would be even better once complete.
"Hey, Cas. I know you like these guys," Dean gestured to Benny and Charlie, both of them already digging into their food, "but do you want to take this to my trailer?"
"You're still an angel," Dean hissed, and he couldn't tell if his cheeks were flushed from anger, or from his words definitely sounding like he was flirting. "Would I still be an elf, even if my ears weren't pointy?"
"Yeah, we might want to escape before one of them manages to get over the barrier." Castiel inclined his head towards the journalists, still desperately trying to get their attention so that they could ask Dean and Cas what was going on.
"And now you're here," Dean hummed, "my boyfriend." He chucked happily, he couldn't believe this was real. Cas was actually his boyfriend.
Dean tossed and turned on his bed, trying to fight the urge to sigh. Cas' light had turned off hours ago, and Dean wasn't going to be
He and Cas got along even better in person than Dean remembered, especially seeing as Dean didn't have to worry about being professional around a client.
If you don't read chapter titles please scroll up a tiny bit and read it, because damn am I proud. I shouldn't be, but I am. I do love a good pun.
"No, and you know… I've been thinking about it," Lisa replied, shifting her weight in order to angle her chest towards him.
"Okay," Dean started, grabbing out the three designs and showing them to Cas. "You can pick and choose, and mix and match if you want to, and I can add anything new if I have missed something you want in it."
Dean wasn't quite drunk yet, but he was tipsy enough to be leaning against Jo and actually listening to Garth as he talked about the sock puppet he'd made as a child and still had somewhere in his house. Dean had heard before that werewolves could be almost as bad with hoarding as dragons, and looking at Garth it really seemed like it was true.
The first picture he saw was enough to steal his breath.
I hope you all have an amazing week! And I wish you all the luck/motivation/courage that you need to get through the next one!! <3<3<3
The store was pretty quiet by the time Cas arrived for his appointment, so Dean was already waiting for him, talking quietly to Claire. He tried to ignore how much his mood improved just at the sight of the other man, leaning against the wall while he said hello to Claire and they got the before appointment paperwork done. Not for the first time he wondered about the easy familiarity between Cas and Claire. They seemed to know each other from outside the ship, but neither of them had ever mentioned it, so maybe it was just coincidence.
With a deep breath to steady his nerves, he climbed out the car, plastering on his best knee-weakening grin. He waved to the first row of reporters but didn't approach them, going straight over to Dean. He knew he was going to have to talk to at least a couple of the journalists, but no one was going to be suspicious if he made some polite conversation with one of the lead actors before he did so.
to him about things, so if he wasn't… then it was something big.
"Alright," Cas whispered to himself, closing his eyes as he lifted the mirror, and then slowly blinking his eyes open again.
This felt different though. It didn't feel like it was the tattoo the guy was nervous about. And that was insane for Dean to be thinking, he didn't even know the guy after all, but there was something on his face. Something suggesting that whatever emotion was under that mask, was caused by something much deeper than getting a tattoo.
“Never?”
Literally.
Castiel could have sworn his face was going to break from how wide he was smiling. The flashing of cameras and yelling of journalists faded into the background, every part of their beings were focused on the other.
in his head, even if no one else could hear the real words.
"Not so secret anymore," Kaia pointed out.
"Sex, Dean! I don't want sex!"
The dinner continued awkwardly, but somewhat peacefully, long enough for them all to finish their main course and do the dishes, before pulling out the pie.
"Bela?" Cas prompted, figuring that Dean needed some help deciding where to start.
His eyes widened, flickering between his own finger and Cas'. The rings… the rings matched.
Yeah... Sorry about the cliff hanger. I promise we get Dean's full story (a good 80% of it anyway) next chapter!
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're a dork," Dean said, though it sounded more like a laugh than the sigh it was meant to be. "Have you heard anything from the people back home?" The service was—understandably—terrible in the middle of the forest, so Cas had gone to look for service earlier in the day, just to make sure that they weren't needed for anything.
"How's work?"
The lanky teen who had first arrived at the circus trying to escape his differences had changed a lot since that day, and maybe Dean was biased, but he loved the person Cas had become. And even more than that, he loved the future they were going to have together, soaring through life, and defying the laws of gravity in their own way. The future was bright, their smiles even brighter as the crowd exploded with applause.
"Alright Cas, you want to follow me back and I'll show you the designs I drew up for you?"
It was another long day. Dean loved his job, had never been thankful that he had the chance to do this, but sometimes, on days like today when his hand was threatening to cramp and he still had an entire line work appointment before he could go home… Sometimes he questioned every relevant life decision that resulted in him ending up here.
There were tears rolling down Dean's cheeks by the time they pulled apart, sobbing breaths stuttering through his chest as Cas reached out and gently wiped them away.
It was why the thought of this finally being done filled him with both elation, and sheer dread.
It feels like forever since I last posted... I'm so excited to be back!!
Dean didn't know what made him do it, he hadn't planned to move, but one moment he had his face buried in Cas' shoulder trying to hold back tears, and the next his lips were pressed to Cas'. Cas' lips were warm and chapped, but still ridiculously soft.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wanted things he'd never wanted before… He wished for things he'd never wished for before.
“Cas,” Dean started, his voice a croak as he looked up at Claire and Jack, “he’s the guy from my dream.”
“Yes, and now you’re doing it.”
Cas pulled back first, slowly moving backwards so they could breathe, keeping their foreheads pressed together. "Oh," Cas murmured, "you just-"
"Sounds good," Castiel nodded, following Dean back and taking a seat on the tattoo chair without Dean prompting him.
"It was a secret," Cas explained. "We have more than enough enemies, and we refuse to let our love be used against us."
Dean pulled his coat tighter around him as he walked down the sidewalk. It wasn't a particularly cold day, all in all, the sun was still retaining some of its summer heat, but the wind was freezing and the street his store was on seemed to be caught in some kind of wind tunnel, battering him with every step and turning his pointy ears red.
Dean only just managed to bite back a reflexive 'everything you do is good' and instead just gave him a smile and a nod, and ran through the section with Baby again.
Again, he didn’t think twice before making his decision, though this time it ended up with him flying as fast as his wings could carry him towards the humans, instead of away from them. He needed to help them, if the witch had this kind of power at their fingertips, then Castiel didn’t want them anywhere near his family.
"I'd love that," Dean grinned, grabbing his phone out of his pants. "What's your number?." He felt giddy just saying it, and could barely believe this was real. He was going to be seeing Cas again.
"Good morning, Castiel, did you sleep well?" Hannah asked. She always tried to make small talk, which he found a little annoying while he was trying to work, but he knew that it was normal to want to talk to your coworkers, so he couldn't really complain.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, unfortunately I already have plans tonight," Castiel answered slowly, shifting uncomfortably in his chair, fixing his eyes on his designs and refusing to look up. "Thank you for the invite, though." He didn't add on the 'maybe next time' that threatened to spill from his lips, mainly because next time was still a definite ‘no.’
Dean had kissed Cas before.
"Shut up, Dean," Jo interrupted him. "Like Garth said, this wasn't your fault, and if you even try to blame yourself-"
"No Whiskers!" he gasped, scooping Cas up into his arms and dropping him onto the counter top. "Don't make a mess!" He then proceeded to clean up the food, dropping it back into the bowl without even noticing the pattern it had been in.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean agreed easily, leaning against the wall across from Mary and waiting for her to start talking.
He shook his head and focused back on the flowers he was coloring. This particular crisis could wait until he was home—in his empty apartment—and wasn't in the middle of a tattoo.
I really like this one, and I hope you guys will too!!
Cas glanced at Dean for a moment, as though asking permission. It was pointless, it was obvious what was going on, but Dean grinned fondly while he nodded anyway. "We're married," Cas said, completely blasee, as though they hadn't been hiding it since purgatory.
"I wanted to talk to you," Dean sighed. "I'm worried."
Yes, the bee puns have returned with a vengeance. Literally the bee pun has very little to do with this chapter... But this story has Cas in it, so we need more bee puns.
Dean walked slowly, enjoying the feeling of dirt between his toes and leaves between his fingers. He'd known he missed the forest, but he'd never noticed quite how much he missed it until he was back. It felt like he could finally breathe again.
"'m not—"
They didn't speak much more for the rest of the morning, and by the time lunch time rolled around Castiel was thanking any deity he could for the chance to get away. Even without words, Hannah had managed to make him uncomfortable, brushing against him every time she walked past and knocking their knees together under the table. They were small things but they didn't sit right with Castiel, the golden ring around his neck burning a hole in his shirt the longer he had to keep it a secret.
"Yeah." It wasn't, not really, not when every time he brought it up his parents would try and talk him out of it, not when he had never told anyone what he wanted to do without them questioning if he was sure, if he thought that an elf should really be a tattoo artist. It wasn't fun, though it always made him feel better when he talked to the others at the store. Nearly all of them had similar experiences, and although he hated that they'd had to go through that too, he was glad he had people to share his experiences with.
Have an awesome week!! And I'll see you next time!!!
(See the end of the chapter for
And he never knew, maybe his parents would cancel—suddenly remember they had a holiday booked or something. Dean had never been that lucky so far, but there was always a first time for everything, and all that.
“Hey Cas.”
We are getting somewhere though!
Cas: Great!
"Hello, Hannah," Castiel smiled, sliding into his seat at their table, going straight to his designs and adding the new details he had thought of on the drive over.
he wanted to date Cas.
"Have you saved any forests recently? Done anything useful? Honestly I'm surprised to still see those pointy ears of yours, with how un-elf-like you've been acting."
Thanks for reading!!
an angel's wings.
"Finally!" Charlie cheered when Dean pulled the door open and slipped inside, careful to close the door behind him so the wind wouldn't catch it and make it slam. The overenthusiastic kitsune that Dean counted as one of his best friends — for some reason — instantly dove for the box in Dean's hands, not even bothering to say a proper hello to him before peering for a moment to decide which one she wanted. She ended up pulling out the chocolate one which Dean had bought knowing she would be the one to eat it. "Dean has donuts!"
"Pie?" Cas asked, pulling the final parcel from the basket.
"Yeah, I know," Dean knew Charlie just wanted the best for him, even if she was a little pushy sometimes.
Thanks for reading!!
Dean normally acted like the tough, emotionless, all-American straight guy the world expected him to be. But when he was alone with Cas, or when it was just his family there, his rough outer shell melted away, leaving the soft, sappy, loving Dean that Cas fell in love with. That Dean would do anything for his family, was the first to jump in to help people, loved his family and tried to make sure they knew it, even when he struggled with the word. He was happy to welcome anyone who needed it into the family and was always patient with those around him. Dean loved with all his heart, hated compliments, and did whatever he could to make everyone around him smile.
"The amount you care is a testament to your pure soul," Cas murmured, as though he could hear Dean's troubled thoughts.
"Yeah, better than ever," Dean winked, stepping away to talk to a reporter who had been yelling his name since Castiel got out of the limo.
"Are you going to tell me what's going on with you?" Dean asked, rolling onto his side so he could look at Cas without straining his neck. "There's something weighing on you, I can feel it. You're not even looking free when in the air like you used to."
Anyway!! Sorry! And I hope you have an awesome week!! And hopefully I'll see you next time!!
"No," Cas sighed, and Dean couldn't have told you who looked more surprised by the honest answer.
Dean rolled his eyes, gently scooping Cas up. "It's okay Whiskers, I won't try to get rid of you." Cas purred quietly, curling into Dean’s arms and accepting the strokes Dean was happily giving him. It was nice.
Never called, unless of course, it was about their parents.
"Do you ever take holidays?" Cas asked, barely stifling his laughter after Dean complained—for the third time—about people who came to him asking for a boring leaf design, when his skills far surpassed that.
"Wow, variation," Dean chuckled, "those two don't have very much in common."
"Do you like it?" he asked carefully, bit wanting to interrupt Cas if he needed a moment, but also wanting to make sure they were tears of happiness, and not regret.
As always, thanks for reading!
"Yeah, just one thing."
"Yeah, you're welcome," Dean grinned, walking down the halls, glancing into random rooms and then apparently deciding that the room wasn't safe enough. "Why are so many of our rooms filled with weapons?" Dean muttered to himself. Cas had the feeling that it was probably because they spent their lives hunting monsters, and it was always useful to have a gun on hand in case something managed to break in, but he didn’t say any of that. He couldn’t exactly explain anything with purring and meowing.
"Ah," Benny hummed, knowing exactly what that meant after his years of working with Dean. "Sorry to hear that Cher. I take it you can't wriggle your way out of it?"
Cas momentarily returned the smile, letting his love for his husband and his love for their love overwhelm him, but quickly blinked all that away. He needed to finish this.
A pair of breathtaking blue eyes popped into his mind unbidden, but he did his best to ignore it. He would think it all over later, not right now when Lisa was right there.
"Yup. You want to see?"
"But you did," Dean shrugged, feeling a lot calmer than he would have if this had happened just a few weeks ago. Meeting Cas had changed things… had changed him. He didn't need Lisa. He would even go as far as to say she was bad for him, and probably always had been.
He couldn't find anything missing when he looked around the room. In fact the only thing at all he could see which was wrong, was the silver ring on his left hand ring finger. It was a pretty little thing with what looked like a wing engraved into it. Possibly even real silver going from how it reflected the light. He cast his mind backwards, searching for where he could have picked it up, because it definitely wasn't his. He hadn't seen it before in his life, and he'd definitely remember owning a ring which looked like that.
"You've worked so hard to get your career where it is, but you've never come home complaining about asshole agents or persistent flirters," Dean hung his head, looking disappointed in himself. "I didn't want to be a burden. I didn't want to be the one who brought those problems to our marriage, but I just ended up bringing even more problems."
Hello everyone!
"I guess you're right," Cas hummed. "Thank you, Dean. You're amazing."
Dean cared for Whiskers, and vocalised it in a way he had never done for Cas in all their many years of friendship. He gave physical affection more than just a shoulder pat or the rare hug—which was reserved for near death experiences—and he didn't care about personal space. He was glad to have Whiskers around in a way he had never been glad to have Cas around.

"I don't suppose you are free this evening?"
Have an awesome week!!!
His meat lover's pizza had just been delivered, and he had just flipped the TV to a channel showing Dr Sexy reruns—his favorite season too—when his phone started vibrating and singing 'Heat Of The Moment'. Apparently Sammy was calling him. He groaned as he grabbed the phone, knowing this wouldn't go well.
"You were still an angel bef-—"
"Would you like to talk about it?"
Ummm.... yes I think that's everything. Enjoy!!
"Are we going to have to keep this a secret from everyone else?" Jack asked, "none of our other friends know after all."
This wasn't a crush, not anymore. He was head over heels for the other boy.
“So you do,” Charlie cackled triumphantly. “Aww, little Deanie has a crush!”
"Dean, I don't know what you expected," Castiel replied, feeling like the bad cop and hating the feeling. This wasn't on him. Dean was the one who had avoided him. Dean was the one who cheated. Castiel was just the first to gather his wits and try to sort it out. "Look at everything that has happened, are you really surprised that we might not be able to get back to how we used to be after this?"
I'll hopefully see you next week!!
"I'm sorry, Lisa," he said quietly, "I've moved on."
Cas looked up to try and figure out which part of the bunker they were in now, and realised that they were starting to get closer to his own room, it was just around the corner and unless the Winchesters had changed the use of his room while he was in Heaven, then his room was still clear of weapons.
“I do know,” Cas answered, a smile audible in his voice, like Dean had said something deep, rather than just talking about music. “I’ve admittedly never listened to classic rock, but when I listen to a good song, it just transports me.”
He'd been planning to head out on his hunt, try and kill the angel which was going around stealing human souls. So maybe… maybe he had managed. And something had gone wrong?
This chapter is slightly (only slightly, but still) longer than normal, whcih you'll probably be glad to hear and... not going to lie guys... I actually love this chapter. I loved it when I wrote it, I just edited it and still love it... and yeah! I hope you love it too!!
And yeah. Castiel was worried about that.
weird between them, but it was only noticeable at random moments, and so rarely that Cas couldn’t figure out if he was just being paranoid or not. Most of the time, it was almost as though nothing had happened, as though their marriage had always been just as strong as it was right then.
He needed to make the owner of the voice feel better.
He sat up quickly, staring with wide eyes at Dean who was kneeling next to him. Dean who had been the blanket of warmth while he was in pain. Dean who had broken the curse by saying…
"Well we need to come up with a name, get them some food," Cas started to relax at Sam's words. That wasn't a problem, he could deal with a fake name for a bit, "find out it's sex." Cas jumped to his feet—paws?—in horror, digging his claws into Sam's leg until he let go, and Cas was able to bolt to the safety of Dean's side of the table.
was being filmed?"
“Do you want to eat your pie, and then grab your stuff? We will probably need to head back home soon.”
The rest was, as they say, history. Cas was family, and before too long both he and Dean had been declared old enough to perform. And now… Dean grinned as he rested his elbows against his knees, watching as Cas skipped into the ring as though he didn't have a care in the world. The crowd cheered, but Cas ignored them, all his focus on the lyra that lay in front of him.
"Are you?"
Dean chuckled out loud this time. "No, I don't actually," he said, "I've been thinking about getting one though."
"Yeah," Cas whispered back, squeezing once before pulling himself out of Dean's hold.
"No one," Dean answered. "Well… I think Jack had an idea."
Dean loaded up the tattoo gun and gently rested a hand against Cas' back. "Alright, ready?"
“Perfect. Monday is our quiet day, so I’ll have free appointments, and a week between each session will be enough time for a little bit of healing from the previous week.”
It felt like at least three years since the start of the day, since he'd arrived at
and nowadays they told each other almost everything.
And they hadn't agreed when he got an industrial in the same ear.
Castiel ran his paw up and down Dean’s chest, stretching to reach as far as he could. He knew that touch always grounded Dean, which was at least half of the reason he would constantly be reaching out to put his hands on people’s shoulders, or in this case running his hands through Cas’ short fur. He wished there was more he could do to calm the tsunami of feelings he could feel dancing through Dean’s soul, but for now, this was the best he could do.
“Oh, yes,” Cas muttered, “I’m rather busy so—”
"He said no," Benny interrupted, placing their drinks on the table and smoothly slipping in between them. "It was lovely to see you, Lisa," his tone dropped with sarcasm, "but I think it's time for you to go."
Baby was always there for him.
Dean sighed into his drink, but didn't stop. They could be disappointed all they wanted, it didn't change the fact he needed this. Cas—the guy he was maybe falling in love with, and who had been living in Dean's head since he lost his vessel—had done a runner the moment he'd been able to. What was he running from? Dean didn't know, but he couldn't help but feel it was probably his fault.
"No problem," Dean grinned. "What do I have today?"
Cas didn't reply, just walked to the chair and lay down on top of it, relaxing his back so Dean would be able to work on it. He jumped at the first touch of Dean's latex covered hands, just as he had in every single other session they'd had.
The motel room was ugly and boring, one of those ones that seemed to think that garnish wallpaper and weird statues counted as design, and looked like the design of them hadn't been changed for at least ten years; like always.
Dean kept on promising himself that he'd get better, that one day he would say 'last one' and he would be telling the truth. It hadn't happened yet, but he wasn't giving up hope yet. Maybe this time something would break the cycle, and he'd stop just sitting there listening while his parents talked about his career like it was the devil's work and his decision to pursue it was the start of all the bad things in the world.
I've done that now though, and I hope you enjoy!
Dean glanced over at Cas, and even before his husband answered he knew what the answer was going to be.
Dean had asked Charlie, Sam, Jo, Benny. Hell, he'd even asked Balthazar and Gabriel—Cas seemed to somehow manage to get along with the clowns, even with their jokes which Dean doubted Cas actually understood. But not even they had any idea where he could be.
Dean was frozen in shock for what must have been at least another ten seconds, a million different emotions flickering through his eyes faster than Cas could comprehend.
"I'm not saying I'm not sad I've been missing such a big part of your life for so long," Sam said slowly, "but I am glad you're happy. And Cas clearly makes you happy."
It started affecting Cas' routines. Not enough that the general audience would notice, they were all too caught up in the magic of it to notice anything, but Dean noticed. He saw the wobbles in Cas' movements, the way his hands started slipping, the way he was getting more and more reckless, as though he didn't really care if he fell.
He'd just about given up when he spotted the figure standing in the next field across, silhouetted by the slowly setting sun. It was still high enough in the sky that Dean wasn't worried about it going dark soon, so Dean started the trek through the grass. He was thankful when he got slightly closer and saw it definitely was Cas, and he sped himself up to a slow jog.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean," Charlie said warningly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ummm... Yeah I don't have much more to say. Enjoy!!!
"Yeah," Dean answered anyway. He watched as Cas' eyes flicked down to the glass in his hand, and a blink later all the liquid in it was gone. Dean wanted to complain—he had been drinking that, dammit—but he was mainly just relieved Cas was back.
Castiel laughed quietly, Dean hated flying, but in his business he had no other choice. That didn't stop him from complaining or treating it like a massive trial.
"We are idiots," Dean sighed, falling heavily back onto the armchair he’d been sitting in earlier and smiling fondly at Cas. “I’m sorry. I promise, I’m never happier than when I’m with you.”
Hey guys... umm... Sorry this is late. I can explain.
Ash—their dragon friend who worked at the roadhouse—was also sitting in the waiting area. Dean was unsure whether he was there for an appointment or whether he was waiting for someone, he could never tell with Ash. Dean had no idea how, but that guy seemed to be friends with every single person Dean had ever met. The amount of times he sat in their waiting room while waiting for a friend to come out from getting a tattoo was insane, but at the same time Dean supposed if he was nervous about getting a tattoo, he would also want to bring along the most chill guy he knew.
"And the rest of it?"
"Wait really?" Charlie asked, "Cas?"
he thought to himself,
Cas chewed on his lip for a long moment, clearly thinking over how to answer. Eventually he seemed to give up on words, as instead of explaining anything he just yanked his shirt over his head, revealing his naked chest to Dean. For one long, glorious, moment he was able to let his eyes roam freely across miles of the most beautiful tanned skin Dean had ever seen—
Cas smiled and purred in thanks, knowing that it would be the best way for him to get his message across without words. He was getting better at responding like a cat would, which was helpful, but wasn’t necessarily a good thing if he wanted to stay himself, and not turn into a normal cat. Would he still be himself if the spell took over? He had no idea, and was constantly stuck between ‘maybe that would be better’ and ‘I need to find how to reverse the spell as soon as possible’.
“Old stuff,” Dean chuckled, “Mainly classic rock, though there is some newer stuff which is pretty good.”
“I recommend it,” Dean told him, holding his breath as he rounded one of the wing tips, needing to get the curve perfect.
“Your family is nice,” Cas murmured into the quiet car, interrupting Dean’s thoughts and turning his attention to his witch. He huffed in agreement, endlessly thankful that his parents hadn’t had a problem with Cas, and by the end had definitely adopted him into the family.
"You don't sleep?" Dean gasped in shock, barely able to believe that he was hearing this properly, “then why are you always so grumpy in the mornings?”
Time to ask the questions.
Comments and Kudos are love!! And at this point in the year (yes it's January, no that doesn't make me any less exhausted right now) reading your comments are bringing me some much needed joy and writing motivation!!
"I love the smell of your forest," Dean breathed happily, a pleased rumble starting up in his chest which made the brightness from before bubble up in Castiel's stomach. Dean was happy, and feeling safe enough to rumble, and it was at least partly thanks to Castiel.
Comments and kudos mean the world to me!!
Have an awesome week!!
The lasagne was cold by the time they sat down to eat it, and they had to quickly shove it back in the oven to reheat it. Neither of them cared though, it just gave them a bit more time to send each other soft smiles with spit-slicked lips, and to make each other blush with reminders of how much they loved each other.
“Yeah alright. Thank you, okay, that means a lot.”
It didn't feel right. It didn't feel right. He felt naked, exposed, alone, cold. It wasn't right.
"It's done?" Cas asked, his eyes already slightly glassey even without seeing it yet.
They basked in the feel of having each other back for a long moment, until their audience decided to remind them they weren't alone.
About a minute later they walked into Cas' room, which looked exactly the same as it did when he left. "This is my friend Cas' room," Dean informed him, "he's away at the moment, but he loves cats so I'm sure he won't mind if we just stay here for a bit."
He was growing the old plant which had been there since Dean was a child, one which Dean couldn’t identify, but he was fairly sure had been dead - or at least dying - for as long as he could remember.
"'orning," Dean mumbled in reply, quiet enough that Castiel wouldn't have heard him if he hadn't been literally pressed against him. Dean bent his back as he stretched his limbs out groaning happily at the feeling.
"I guess we need to figure out a few things then-"
Dean always feared Cas  would fall and hurt himself, especially when suspended so high in the air, but the second he was dragged away by the magic of a boy flying through the air, he found himself as awestruck as he had been the first time he'd ever seen Cas perform.
He took another sip of his whiskey, chuckling quietly to himself when he found yet another article wondering who Dean Winchester’s mystery woman was. He could just imagine the talking-to his husband was going to get from all his other co-stars, as they tried to figure out why Dean kept ‘her’ a secret from them. The only people who knew who Castiel was in relation to Dean were their family, blood or otherwise. This included Jo, who was probably falling all over the place laughing when she saw the articles where it was rumored that she was the mystery woman. Dean’s agent did
For now, at least.
Someone who wasn't Castiel.
Well, he hadn’t, but Dean thought he had.
He hung upside down, the spinning slowing as he hung there, his eyes locked onto Dean’s. No one else could see him, the gap in the big top was at the wrong angle for that, but Cas could.
Hey guys!! I managed to figure out what a 'Saturday' is this week!! :D
"What!" she gasped, her eyes going wide. "You can't just—"
"Because you need to get out more, and I know for a fact you won't unless I force you to." She wasn't wrong, Dean hadn't been to a bar on his own—without anyone forcing him into it—for… months. Probably not since Lisa broke up with him actually. But that didn't mean that he wanted to go today.
"No."
"Are you ready to head in?" Castiel can feel his anticipation building, the last couple of months of post-production work had finished up the movie, and he was excited to finally see what it looked like.
He was shining from within, and Dean just couldn't look away.
Castiel had been here many times, and he could never remember it being this beautiful!
It has been a long week, but I'm glad I'm here now to post this chapter!!
"Have I called you a sap recently?" Dean asked, though he couldn't hide the bright red blush staining his cheeks, or the huge grin on his face. "Because you really are, Angel, the biggest sap I've ever met."
"That makes sense," Dean agreed, "where do you come from anyway?" He didn't normally ask for details about Cas’ life, but sometimes when it came up in conversation he couldn’t help himself.
“I’ve lived in my cabin for seven years,” Castiel explained, “I’ve had a lot of time to explore.”
It brought tears to his eyes but he couldn't look away. He could never look away.
Thank you all of you for coming on this journey with me!!
"Maybe where you're from," Cas said and Dean could hear the shrug in his words, "but I'm not human and where I'm from it's completely normal to keep an eye on others when they are vulnerable. And, correct me if I'm wrong, but you are pretty vulnerable while unconscious."
A single tear slipped down his face before he could wipe it away, and he cursed himself for jumping to conclusions and doubting his husband.
Charlie was leaning against the front desk, and Dean went to stand with her when he saw the waiting room was empty. Charlie was fiddling with her lip ring, and Dean could already tell she was bursting with the need to say something.
“Yeah,” Dean croaked, having to clear his throat a couple of times before he continued, “yeah, your friend is right. You might still be able to see it—it depends on how your skin and your species reacts to the ink—but it should cover up most of it, though it will end up a large tattoo to cover it all.”
Almost.
When Cas avoided Dean, and Dean was worried about his friend, and it felt like everything was falling down around him, he went to talk to Baby. He snagged a couple of apples from the bowl he kept in his caravan, and headed to her stall. He sat down in the hay,  his back pressed against the wall as he offered her an apple, and then let his feelings flow.
“At least let me try!” Dean didn't think he'd ever yelled that loudly at Cas, maybe not at anyone, but he just wanted to help and Cas wasn't even letting him try! Dean didn't hate anything more than he hated feeling useless, and right now… that was all he was feeling. He loved Cas, and hated seeing him hurt.
"And I made it back to you," Dean whispered, pulling Cas' ring off and turning it so they could both see the 'I love you' engraved into the inside. "I know. I'm still sorry I forgot, but… we're both here now. It's okay."
I'll see you next week!! Have a good one!!
He drove home, singing along to his tapes and overall in a great mood, which he refused to believe was anything to do with Cas. He could be happy for reasons other than talking to and tattooing cute boys, no matter what Charlie said.
Sam squinted at Cas for a minute, before he eventually said, "yeah, Whiskers suits them."
"Eat now," he said with a grin, "that walk wore me out and I am starving!"
"I still don't understand why you just
“Everyone I’ve ever been close to has died, and that’s including Sam and Cas, but unlike the others they kept on coming back. I’m not sure if he’s coming back this time.”
"What're you thinking about?" Dean asked, breaking Castiel from his thoughts and turning his attention back to the familiar. Dean's expression was open and warm, his eyes sparkling in a way they hadn't even when they were back at Castiel's cabin. Dean suited being outside, and he was breathtaking in the warm air of the forest.
"Have you never heard the phrase 'A problem shared is a problem halved'?" Dean rolled his eyes. "I just want to help, man."
The guy was cool, dorky, mysterious, and a genuinely nice person. Someone would have to be insane to not want to be friends with him, so really, Dean didn't think he was doing anything too weird.
I... read over this chapter... but only once and for some reason I kept on finding places were I'd written the wrong name (Dean instead of Cas and vice versa) so if you see any mistakes, please point them out so I can fix them.
"Then take them to one of the guest rooms! I don't care, just keep them busy."
He was woken up when the car turned off, and a quick glance around revealed the bunker's garage. Dean was already out of the car and walking inside, his duffel slung over his shoulder, and Sam had too tight a grip on Cas for him to wriggle away and make his own way inside. Instead he had to wait while Sam unfolded himself from the car, and grabbed his duffel, and walked after Dean, and detoured to his room to put his duffel down, until finally he walked to the war room, where Dean was sitting, leaning back in his chair.
He could tell that they weren’t there yet, Castiel could pinpoint Dean’s soul to the exact location—even with the warding on his ribs—and so he knew that Dean, and presumably Sam as well—he could only hope they hadn’t decided to split up and have Sam go on ahead—were still a couple of minutes out, but they were getting closer every second that Castiel didn’t act.
The warehouse that Dean and Sam were going to.
"Exactly," Dean cut him off. "Your species is you. Not just your appearance. You are an angel down to your soul, and wings or no wings are not going to change that."
Dean felt his cheeks flush red and he awkwardly turned his attention to the floor. Everyone in the circus probably knew about Dean's disappearing act everytime Cas performed. Everyone that was, except Cas himself.
"Ah, yes. I'm sure having someone else would help," Cas said helplessly. He couldn't mention that he had a husband, it was a secret. That was why he kept his ring on a chain around his neck. But he really wished that he could; it would make everything so much easier.
Dean couldn't argue with that. Not when Garth was so enthusiastic, not when he looked so honestly hopeful that Dean's special someone was out there.
Jack's face twisted in thought. "I guess… maybe? But it's unlikely."
Kudos and Comments are awesome! Have a great week!!
Even from this distance, Castiel could hear the quiet laughs filtering through one of the windows which wasn’t fully closed.
They arrived at the lake an immeasurable amount of time later. The water was surprisingly clear, especially in the shallower areas, and the sun reflected off it in a way that Castiel could imagine being in some kind of holiday brochure. The banks sloped gradually down to the water, gentle enough that they would be able to have their picnic there without falling in, and the trees surrounding the lake shook in the light breeze, mixing with the birdsong to make a beautiful chorus.
"Whiskers made a mess with their food and the counter was the only place I figured they wouldn't get into even more trouble," Sam sighed, "actually, would you mind taking them to your room and keeping an eye on them? I have a spell I need to do and I don't want them to accidentally get caught up in it."
"What?" Garth asked, popping his head round the corner to stare at them. "Why did you call?"
He didn't say anything when Dean sat down in the grass below, even though Dean knew Cas noticed him . All Dean could hear for a long time was just pages turning, and the quiet singing of birds. Cas was clearly doing his best to ignore him, and Dean had no idea what to do about it.
Dean: This Friday is great.
"Yeah," Dean promised, "just wanted to talk to you. I finished my book, thought you might want to read it, and you'll never guess what I saw a bird do!" He was about to start telling Cas what had happened, when he registered the soft smile, and odd expression, on his friend's face.
"I had—the most beautiful wings," Cas choked out, "they were my pride and joy. They were what made me… me. But then—" he trailed off, his back shaking slightly with soundless sobs. Dean slowly turned the tattoo gun off. He couldn't work like this, and honestly, he didn't want to. Not when Cas' so clearly needed comfort.
I hope you enjoy!!
"No but she wouldn't have come over here if I hadn't—"
"Looks awesome, Cas," he said, aiming for nonchalance and probably missing by a mile.
"I'm glad," Dean said softly. "Are you done looking for now? I need to wrap it, you know the drill."
“We are going to talk about this,” Dean breathed, leaning his forehead against Cas’ so that he could get his breath back, “later,” he added on, leaning back in to continue kissing Cas.
"I gave up once, swore off dating when I first turned," Garth was a late bloomer, and had believed himself to be human until he turned furry one night, "now look at me! Three beautiful kids, a lovely wife. If dating isn't what you want, then fine, but if this is just you thinking the right person isn't out there, then you're wrong!"
Castiel—or Cas as everyone in the circus knew him—was their aerialist extraordinaire. If it involved being high up enough that one slip could snap your neck, Cas could do it. Trapeze, tight rope, silks, he could do them all, but his specialty—and the one he was performing tonight—was the lyra. Dean had never seen Cas more comfortable than when he was up in the air, and when he performed Dean always half expected that the light would catch his back in some way and reveal wings. That boy was made to be in the air, in some other life he was probably a bird or an angel or something, and it hurt Dean as much as it awed him.

Hopefully you'll all like it!!!
"So, Sam," Mary started with a smile which was faker than their 'close' family. Dean watched Sam silently sigh, both of them already knowing that there was only one way Mary would be talking about this.
when he left the city, and he could never convince anyone to come with him.
and disturb him just because he can't sleep. At least one of them should be able to get a good night's sleep, and it clearly wasn't going to be Dean.

"Something Charlie said yesterday," Cas admitted slowly. "I guess it's got me wondering if she's right."
"It's why I joined the circus, actually. Even then, I knew I was different. I had no one else, and I figured I had the skills. Where better to go than to a place where being different was basically mandatory."
Dean needs a new laptop, but doesn't have much money so decides that money going towards eating has to go, so he ends up only eating one meal a day. He hides it from everyone he knows, and has convinced himself (and John brought him up telling him) that he can't ask for help. Cas does eventually find out, and goes all BAMF creature-y when he realises what's been going on, before giving Dean his food and promising that he has more than enough money to feed Dean as well as himself while Dean needs the help.
"Hello Dean," Cas smiled, the gentle look enough to make Dean's insides go all soft. "Have you had a good week?"
His enthusiasm was pretty infectious.
"I- yeah," Dean smiled, "yeah, I'd like that."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean looked contemplative for a moment before he walked forwards, picking Cas up and settling him in his arms. Cas was so shocked that he didn't react, and once he had realised what was going on he was happy enough to burrow into Dean's arms, rather than trying to run away. His mind still felt slightly foggy, enough that he knew he really shouldn’t be doing this, but not enough for him to figure out why, and he wasn’t going to stop unless he could find an actual reason to.
"I'm an angel," Cas said, a frown clear in his voice. He corrected himself after a moment, the pain in his words enough to take Dean's breath away and squeeze his heart. "I used to be an angel." It wasn't right, and Dean wanted to argue, but he also knew he needed to let Cas say what he needed to say.
"You didn't think to invite us all to your wedding?" Eileen asked. Dean was glad to hear that she didn't seem offended, she just honestly wanted to know.
"You're miserable. I know what you're going to say, about how you're happier than you've ever been and how you love everything about your life, but Dean—" she sighed, cutting herself off. "I'm not blind, Dean. Ever since Lisa dumped you…"
"Well, I for one am just happy this means you're not actually pathetically pining after each other like we all thought," Eileen giggled, "secretly married is definitely a lot more fun."
"It's good. Thanks, Mom," Sam nodded with a tight smile.
Also! As you might have seen, I have updated the chapter count (to actually have a number!). There is an end to this story!! We are till a bit away, but it exists!
He was on top of the bedsheets, still fully dressed in his jeans and boots so that he could be up and moving at a moment's notice—just like John had always taught him—even though he was such a slow waker most of the time that it didn't really help him; like always.
At least I'm updating amiright! Even if it is a day late!
For a while he had just ignored the surge, it was probably nothing important after all. Hell was closed, Heaven was on temporary leave while it sorted itself out, so clearly it couldn’t be biblical, so why would Cas care about it? But then it happened again, another surge, just strong enough for him to pick up on it, so Castiel decided to have a quick peek. It was only after he had realised that the surge was huge compared to Earth’s natural power, and had looked into it a little bit more, that he realised where it was coming from.
“Yeah?” Dean frowned, “So?”
His mind was clearing—albeit slowly—which he was thankful for, and now that he could see and think, he realised that the two people in the warehouse must be Sam and Dean. He had already known that… it had been them he'd been coming here to protect.
Sorry this is late, I my day was non-stop yesterday and I'm still exhausted today.
It was dangerous, but Dean couldn't bring himself to care. Not when it was Cas.
Thanks for reading!!
Instead he meowed a couple of times, his meows translating to ‘
He knew it would be amazing, but he wanted to see exactly which form ‘amazing’ would take this time.
And Cas had lost his.
"I will," Jo agreed. "And just so you know, I'm proud of you." She didn't say what for, she didn't need to.
Cas danced like it was in his blood. He swung and twisted and flew through the air so naturally that Dean forgot about the hours of blood and sweat and tears it had taken for his friend to get to this point. He forgot about the broken bones and the late nights and the hundreds of times Cas had fallen only to pick himself straight back up.
"I'm staying," Dean stated. His voice was trembling slightly—fear, maybe nerves, maybe just anticipation—but his words were sure, and when he made eye contact with Cas, it was clear that he wasn't going to just give up now. "I know that things have been a mess lately, and it's been pretty much all my fault. I'm sorry for that, I really am, but that doesn't mean I'm ready to abandon everything I love."
He found a picture of the two of them wearing cowboy hats, and had to pause for a moment. He remembered that hunt, remembered putting that hat on, remembered the day the picture must have been taken, but he didn’t remember Cas. He didn’t remember the joy he could so clearly see reflected on his own face, couldn’t remember ever being as at ease with someone as he looked in the picture.
Have an awesome week, and I will hopefully see you at the weekend!!!
"Smart," Claire snorted, and Dean knew from that one word that she had forgiven them for the secrets.
“I- you can hear me again?” Cas’ voice was shaking, the sudden realisation that this might be it, that the curse might be over, causing adrenaline to flood through him.
Hello again!
"What things?" Dean asked suspiciously, at the same time Cas started bristling up in confusion and concern.
“I’ve never heard of that one, any others?” Cas asked.
He wanted Dean to always be happy… preferably with him, however much he hated the thought. Because Castiel had done things Dean couldn't even begin to imagine. Surely if Dean was going to stay with someone forever, he deserved the chance to bond properly, to bond with a witch who didn't have their magic bound. Charlie had to be wrong. Castiel
He still wasn't fully certain about his outfit, but his time was up, so he just grabbed his phone, wallet, and keys, and headed outside. Cas was idling at the end of his drive, sitting in the driver's seat of a… Dean rubbed his eyes. Nope, he wasn't hallucinating. Cas really did own a golden Lincoln Continental.
Castiel shrugged his shirt off, lying down on his front just as he had for all their other appointments. "Maybe? I was having some flashbacks." He sighed, his eyes looking troubled for a moment before he closed them.
Dean hovered in the doorway for a moment, watching Cas start talking to Claire. He wasn't really thinking about anything, just watching Cas' minute expression changes, as well as the odd wince when he pulled the tender skin on his back. He was responsible, and Dean knew he was going to look after his tattoos—he'd been taking notes and all when Dean had gone over the care instructions the first time.
Cas: I'm outside.
Nothing could make those dinners bearable. Not Sam, not his mom's homemade pie, nothing. And yet he was still going, which he supposed said more about him than anything else.
Their date was… incredible.
Comments and Kudos give me more serotonin than chocolate!!
Dean seemed to think for a long time, which Cas guessed was a good thing. He would be using this new name for as long as it took him to turn back, and he really didn’t want to be stuck with a stupid name.
"I have, I'm sorry. I'm not interested in getting back together with you."
Baby trotted smoothly, not bothered by the noise after so long. Dean allowed himself to bask in the satisfaction of a job well done. One more crowd enchanted by the magic of Dean's family.
Though, judging from the glances he was getting from everyone else, they disagreed.
He said he wanted this, but then he worked so much that they barely even saw each other?
"I hate it," Cas admitted, "I hate myself. It's why I don't like my full name. Castiel," it was almost a sneer, all of Cas' hurt forced behind one single word. "That's an angel's name. I am no longer an angel."
No one had seen Cas for at least three hours.
Dean nodded, turning his head to the sky and breathing in deeply, his eyelashes fluttering. Castiel wondered what he could smell that Castiel himself couldn't, knowing that his familiar nose would be a lot more sensitive than his own.
"Dean," Sam sighed when Dean reached out for a top up. Dean ignored him, refilling his glass anyway and toasting it in Sam's direction. He was about to take a sip when the sound of wings flapping interrupted him.
"Not too far," Castiel promised, looking around the forest around them to try and find some kind of market so he could say exactly how far it was going to be. He recognised the large rock they were just passing - it looked a little bit like a large rabbit, if the rabbit was incredibly deformed. If he remembered correctly the lake was about half  a mile away, though admittedly he'd never actually measured it before. "You'll know it when we get there."

"Okay but… could the empty be hiding him?"
First thing the next morning found Dean back in the big top, putting Baby through her paces. He was hoping to perfect a new sequence today, so he could premiere it at their next stop. It was going pretty well, and that was saying something seeing as Dean was distracted. Cas was training as well, high up on the silks, and from the looks of things was trying to perfect a new move. It was as breathtaking as it was worrisome.
This Cas couldn't fall. He couldn't hurt or break. This Cas was ethereal, enchanting, free.
I'm sorry. You just want to read creature Cas and I'm over here making puns. I do actually love this chapter though, so I hope you agree.
He didn't want to unbind his magic, he didn't want to bond with Dean… but at the same time… he wanted to keep Dean with him, by his side, forever. He wanted Dean to sleep in his arms every night and he wanted to wake up like this every morning.
"Cas!" Everyone yelled, pretty much in sync, as they all spun around to face Cas. The angel looked slightly confused for a moment as he looked at all their expressions, before understanding dawned on his face.
"Probably leave us angry voicemails? Maybe some caps locked texts?"
"What's going on, Cas," he sighed, when he couldn't stand it any longer. He'd never been good with uncomfortable silences, even more so when it was with Cas. Normally things were so comfortable with Cas, they had known each other for years, had talked about everything under the sun together, and now… now it was like there was a brick wall standing between them.
He wanted to be the one who told Dean to pick his towel up, he wanted to be the one who forced Dean to relax, he wanted to be the one who helped Dean even when he didn’t want to accept it.
"Don't bullshit me, Harvelle," Dean groaned, "we both know what it's about. Who is it this time? Resident fairy? Local imp? Trickster friend of a friend?" Ellen Harvelle had been trying to set Dean up with random people ever since his last relationship failed spectacularly and Dean swore off dating. He was happy, so why would he risk all that just to have someone to come home to at the end of the day?
"I'm alright," Dean replied, laughing slightly hysterically, "I was just wondering if you were aware that your eyes are glowing."
Dean couldn’t help wondering what had happened to Cas. The scars, the placement, the size… they almost looked like wings. Or—scars from losing wings, Dean supposed. That could explain why his tattoo idea had been so exact, and although there was no way Dean was going to ask, he knew these drawings had to be perfect, just in case. If Cas really was a winged creature, who had lost his wings, and was trying to get them back through a tattoo… then Dean refused to let it be any kind of subpar. Anything less than perfect was not an option.
"There was a car crash," Cas said, and Dean didn't need any more details to understand what must have happened. The scars on his back, so precise and clean, almost surgical. Because they were.
He glanced over his shoulder, looking back towards Dean, and felt his blood turn cold.
This was- Cas was- Cas was the figure from his dream.
It was a Monday, which was always a quiet day at the store, so he had taken a quick detour on his way in to buy some donuts for everyone to eat. It was one of the perks of opening a store with his best friends, flexible hours so long as no one missed any appointments, and food was encouraged as long as it didn't go into their stations—things had to stay sterilized after all.
I have tried to catch any mistakes, but if you see some I've missed please tell me so I can fix them.
"Maybe," Dean replied, knowing that he wouldn't come more often if someone was pointing a gun at his head. He'd got off lucky so far, and he knew the comments about his job would only get worse as the evening drew on. Hopefully he'd be able to claim that he had early morning tomorrow and escape quickly. He wasn't sure how much more of this he could take.
"Yes," Dean squinted in confusion, "apparently only Cas was interested in my nature tattooing skills today."
Well, there went that plan.
He couldn’t escape it, no matter how much he twisted and struggled. He kept trying, kept hoping, but before he could wriggle too far from his starting position a warm weight settled on top of him, constricting his movements but also acting as a blanket of safety. He couldn’t escape the pain, but something was there, grounding him while he tried to ride it out.
"Okay, okay. What about Whiskers?"
Castiel grinned, kissing Dean with all he had. They had a lot to talk about, but at that very moment all that mattered was the soft press of each other's lips, and the home they were finding in each other's arms.
He still remembered the look on his parents face when he showed them the hoop in the cartilage of his right ear. Charlie had done it for him, and he'd been so excited to show everyone. His parents hadn't agreed.

"When has that ever stopped me?"
Dean sighed loudly, leaning forwards so that his elbows were pressed to his knees with his head resting in his hands. "Yes, I do, but please just hear me out. That's all I ask." His voice had taken on a pleading note, like he expected Cas to refuse and throw him out.
"Yeah, I'd like to see the press have a heart attack when they see them," Dean smiled wistfully up at the sky, getting himself a swat on the shoulder.
"How does it look from the ground?" Cas called, breaking through his musings. Dean glanced up, certain for some reason that Cas must be talking to one of the other practicing performers, and found himself surprised when he found Cas staring straight at him.
Comments and kudos are hugs for the Cas and Dean (and me :D)
Here is this weeks chapter! And I will see you in two weeks for the next one!
It should have been horrible but Benny, Garth, and Jo were good company, and Dean could admit he'd missed meeting up to shoot some shit with the others, so he was actually having the time of his life.
Castiel watched, his breath caught in his throat, as Dean shifted. For one awful, heart-stopping moment, he thought Dean was going to stand up. For just one moment, he feared that his husband really didn't have any explanation and was just going to grab his stuff and leave. He knew that he had told Dean to do it, but the thought of it actually happening was still enough to freeze his blood and shatter his very being.
Dean lowered his gaze, even though Cas wasn't actually looking at him, his face staining red, yet again. "Thanks."
Wasn’t that all that mattered?
Dean quietly continued adding the details to the flower he was working on. Cas had a point, he probably did need a break. It had been a while since he'd been able to get away and just spend a week in the trees, and although he had never allowed his species to hold him back, he had to admit that living in the city was difficult sometimes. The problem was, although he loved the animals and the plants, he missed
It was just a joke, but already, even from this single date, Dean knew he didn't want it to stay that way forever.
He set up for the day quickly, making sure all his instruments were sanitised and that he wasn't out of disposable gloves again—he hadn't checked once, near the start of his career, and you only have to leave an appointment to desperately search for gloves once before you do everything in your power to make sure it never happened again. Once he was certain everything was in order, he took a seat at his stool and started looking at the designs he'd drawn out for Cas. He almost couldn't believe how by the end of today the man himself will have seen them, and hopefully loved them.
"Yes," Cas replied and it was moments like this that Dean remembered that Cas really had no idea what counted as weird in the human world.
"I thought you could never love me," Cas admitted, squeezing Dean's hand back. "Because I'm ace, and- I guess it hurts. It hurts to know that I am different in a way the world will never understand."
"Thanks," Dean smiled. "I—thanks." He couldn't think of what else he could possibly say, and desperately hoped that Jo could understand the meaning he couldn't put into words.
"Fine, fuck!" Dean groaned, "I'll go on whatever date Ellen sets me up on! I'll try! Okay?"
Dean couldn't. Not when his friend was so obviously upset by this.
In other news! I actually really like this chapter, and hopefully you guys will like it too!!!
"Tell me something else about your life?" Dean asked carefully. "You've told me about the bad things, but what's something good in it?"
Dean blinked back the tears that had no place farming in his eyes. He didn’t know Cas’ story but… there was pain there. There was something deep entwined with those scars—maybe what Cas had been hiding behind his mask earlier—and Dean could only hope that his art would be enough to start the process of healing whatever it was.
Sam very much believed in giving bad news face to face, or at the very least in real time.
"No. I think we're done hiding. We are in love, and it's time everyone else knew that too."
The appointment was over too soon. Dean felt like they'd barely started before he was done. He checked the tattoo a million times, compared it to the designs, checked it again, but he had no more work to do. Everything was done… and this was it.
Chapter Summary:
"What are we going to do with it?"
Yeah... Not the best place to leave the story while I'm away (Though admittedly there have been worse). I might be able to update next week on the Friday instead of Saturday... so if I remember I'll do that!
Cas looked thoughtful for a moment, before saying, "Yes, mainly I read, watch over you, occasionally I text my family or some friends who are awake."
was the name of their store. They specialized in tattoos, though they did piercings as well on every day Charlie was in—which was every day except Saturdays—and were always interested in expanding the business should the stars align to make it happen. Right now though, they were happy with what they had. It wasn't the largest shop in the city, but they were well known, and each of their artists had a reputation.
Dean looked down at the floor awkwardly, “I had an idea,” he started slowly, “I just never said anything, because none of you seemed to think it was possible.” He shrugged, trying to make sure Mary knew that it wasn’t really that big of a deal. It had been horrible the entire time, but he had Cas now, and every moment was worth it if Cas was his prize at the end. He would live through much worse for Cas, so this really wasn’t a big thing.
Dean had never been good at emotions, and he instantly started feeling himself getting uncomfortable, but he did his best to ignore it. He wasn't a therapist, but he wanted to help Cas as much as he could.
"Doesn't mean you have to," Benny muttered, holding his hands up when Dean sent him a glare. "Got it Brother, I won't mention it again. Just— take care of yourself."
Dean was right, of course.
So yeah, sorry about that!
Sorry guys! I haven't forgotten you!! I barely had any time yesterday (I didn't even look at my computer, and spent most of the day out of my house and without wifi) so I wasn't able to edit or post.. but here we go!! Hopefully not too late!!
"Not this time," Dean sighed, "it doesn't matter anyway-"
Castiel smiled smugly to himself as he leaned back in his favorite armchair, the soft, squishy back cradled him perfectly while he sipped his three fingers of whiskey and read through the online news and magazine articles he had opened on his phone. His sitting room was dark, just the lamp nearest him casting long shadows across the room, and when he looked out the window he could see the moon and stars. It was quiet with just him, his Jack Daniels, the empty room, and the moon shining through the window, but hopefully that would be changing soon. He loved peace and quiet, but he was also looking forward to it ending.
"I love you," Cas told him, placing the lasagne on the table and pressing a kiss to the top of Dean's head. "I'm so glad I chose to get a tattoo. I got myself back, just like I'd hoped, but even better… I got you."
"Come on then little guy, let's get you home." Dean calling the bunker his home put the closest thing he could get to a smile on his face. He'd always thought of the bunker as home, but hearing it being said out loud was an experience all of its own.
“Shut up.” And Dean couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be an order, or a plea.
"Is everything okay?"
"You thought I'd gone for good, didn’t you," he sighed, and it was definitely a statement rather than a question.
So he was late. And his parents weren't happy. So obviously they decided the only way they could continue would be to insult everything about Dean they could comment on.
It was amazing to be surrounded by family, without having his life shitted on every ten seconds. In fact, they were all really proud of Dean, and once he showed them Inked Dreams Instagram account, they got even more excited.
"Alright, come on Dean, we're going to talk." She walked to her small piercing room with an air of determination, and Dean knew better than to argue with that; even if talking was up in his top five least favorite things to do, along with mentioning work around his parents.
Hello!! I hope everyone is have an awesome week!
This whole thing had been too much of a mess for him to deal with it sober.
"Do you have any pets?"
"I'm excited for you, and everyone else, to see them, too." Castiel reached forwards, deciding that he only really needed one hand to eat, and laced their fingers together, squeezing tightly.
"We kept them on chains around our necks. Only wore them on our fingers when it was just us," Dean explained, spinning the ring on his finger in a nervous habit that had somehow become so ingrained in him over the years that not even the loss of his memories could unstick it.
Dean didn't bother to try and change his parent's minds anymore, he accepted they would never like the fact he was a tattoo artist, but it still hurt. He still hated the fact they kept on going on about it. He still hated the fact that they couldn't just accept he was happy, and be happy for him.
"Is any of it reflected in the movie?"
“Did you hear that Whiskers?” Dean asked quietly, his wide eyes still darting from corner to corner, looking more frazzled than Cas had ever seen him before.
"I noticed," Dean pretty much whispered, "I thought you were unhappy with me, with my desire to keep our relationship a secret and how busy my work was. I thought it would be best to let you go, but it hurt too much to do anything. So I guess I was just waiting for you to turn up with divorce papers one day."
"Don't give up!" Garth said, suddenly butting into their conversation. His hair was definitely slightly longer than it had been the day before, which Dean puzzled over for a long moment before he remembered what day it was.
"Just take a seat on the tattooing chair," Dean told him, grabbing his sketchpad and pencil before sitting down on his stool. "My name's Dean, though I guess you already know that. I will probably be your tattoo artist should you decide it's the right thing for you, unless you request something one of the others would be better at."
"Leave your plate, I'll sort out the food and then take it back when I take mine," Dean said quickly, shooing Cas out the room. Cas chuckled at that, his husband knew he had been in the middle of a sketch when he left for lunch, and he appreciated the chance to get back to it sooner. "I love you, see you soon."
felt about Cas—and ever since then… it hadn't been the same. It was like his realization had made him see what he was missing in life, and now he was aching for it.
"Dean," Jo said, a cheery smile on the human’s face that told Dean more about how awfully this was going to go, than anything else about her demeanor.
"What's going on?" Dean asked, barely able to keep up with the kids faced pace conversation and feeling at least two steps behind the other two.
"Dean, we've got a walk-in for you," Claire said, waiting until Dean nodded before she left the room.
"How's your day been going?" Dean asked in the gentle tone he used when he got the chance to talk to Cas without having to pretend there was nothing between them.
And yet here he was, going against his own words.
“Well, yes.”
Dean wanted to argue, but his friends had a point, and right now his hands were shaking enough that he had to admit they had a point, and he would appreciate the extra time to get ready. Cas hadn’t told him what they were doing yet, but he knew it was outside, and he knew that his outfit for it needed to be perfect.
"You've got a consultation at one," Claire spoke up from the desk she'd returned to sit behind, the glow of the computer highlighting the natural glow angels seemed to carry with them. "And you're doing walk-ins for the morning."
"What stuff?"
"He really does," Dean nodded, “he… I know I haven’t known him for long, but he really does make me happy.”
"Passive aggressive statements about how we must have lost track of the days?" Dean suggested.
"Is that a cat?"
“Definitely,” Dean tried his best to smile reassuringly. He had never failed at bringing someone’s idea to life, and that wasn’t going to change any time soon. “It might not all be exactly what you’re imagining, but I’ll draw some designs up, and talk them over on your next appointment, and then I guess we’ll get started.”
Cas had clearly been deeply hurt, and Dean couldn’t not help him, not if this was what he needed. He couldn’t explain it, but Dean felt… something. He couldn’t explain it, he just knew that he’d only met Cas ten minutes ago, and yet he felt a connection to the other creature. It was dumb, and probably just Dean going insane, but it was still there. Whoever Cas was, whatever Cas was, he was important, and Dean just wanted to make him smile.
"We've been over this, Dean," Cas replied with a sigh, "it's nothing I want to burden you with."
"What do you enjoy in life? Other than your art, I mean." Cas asked, breaking Dean out of his musings and returning him to the present. He was thankful that he could tattoo in his sleep, or else he could have made a very embarrassing mistake. Normally he was much better at not zoning out, but apparently things were different today. Maybe he needed a break?
Dean found himself thinking that the worst part was that Cas actually sounded like he meant it. Dean barely knew Castiel, and yet the guy was so honestly nice, that he actually cared.
"This looks delicious, Mom," Sam muttered, doing his best to keep the unstable peace. Dean felt awful that Sam had to keep on doing this. When they were younger it had always been the other way round, Dean keeping the peace while Sam argued about anything and everything. He'd been an angsty teen, and Dean had never held it against him, just like he knew Sam never held this against him.
He only had to wait a few seconds before he got a message back; Dean was clearly waiting for his message, probably sitting in the terminal, scrolling through his social media as he waited for Cas to message him back.
"She often is," Dean shrugs, though he clearly has no idea what Castiel is talking about. "I've not known her very long, but from the times I've talked to her, and why she said when we were talking on her website, I think you can trust whatever she said."
They talked for a couple of weeks, just texting, without organising a date. They didn't discuss it, but they both had come to a similar conclusion that they wanted to get to know the other outside the realm of Inked Dreams, before they organised anything. At first Dean had thought it was a brilliant idea because if it became clear that they had nothing in common in the real world, they could just back off without losing anything. By the end, Dean knew it had been an amazing idea because it meant he
Okay so quick thing. This story is (sadly) not all fun and cuteness, and this chapter is most of that.
"Oh, maybe this one- nevermind, I think there's some poison in there."
Charlie nodded, gesturing to where Garth had just arrived and was gathering his lunch. "We're not going to be lonely without you, go and do whatever. Be sappy, we don't mind."
On with Dean's backstory!!!
Dean thought for a moment, humming under his breath. “Dr. Sexy.” And shit, why had he said that? Normally he kept his guilty secret… well… a secret.
It was probably more the latter, he hated feeling like he was disappointing people.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What about TV shows?” Cas asked, moving the conversation on before the quiet in the room could grow too big. “Any particular ones?”
“Are you free every Monday?” Dean interrupted before Cas could get himself worked up over matching his busy schedule to Dean’s free appointments.
It wasn't an over exaggeration to say that Ellen's choice of people for Dean was absolute shit. They either ended up being assholes, or Dean just didn't have anything in common with them. Or they judged Dean like hell for being an elf tattoo artist and he had to leave before he punched them in the face. He got enough shit from his parents without having to deal with random dates going on about it too.
"I know," Cas interrupted, "but I—I feel like me again. Like the—the better version of the me before the accident."
Castiel didn't have time to even open his mouth before Benny answered for him. "Get out of here, we aren't going to be offended."
Dean sighed. "Look, I still don't remember this guy, but from the little I've heard, and from seeing how all of you have reacted, I hope you're right."
The plot of this chapter... was not planned. It just,,,, appeared. Somehow. I didn't even mean to write this, it just happened.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean didn't go.
Dean wasn't entirely sure where the anger came from, it was just suddenly there, red hot and biting as he stared down at the marvelous man in front of him.
It's that time of the week again!!
Instead he would just have to hope.
"Yes, Mom?"
"But then?" Dean promoted quietly, pressing a gloves hand to Cas' shoulder in what he hoped was a comforting gesture.
"I'm sorry to hear that." He normally hated it when clients talked about their personal issues. He was an artist, not a therapist, and hearing about their problems always made him want to provide answers he didn't have. It should have been the same with Cas. He couldn't help him.
"So how're you doing?" Lisa asked, twirling a strand of hair around her finger in a way Dean remembered he used to think was adorable. He had no idea why, looking at it now.
"Dean has a date!"
"So you just let her split us up? Let us drift away from each other without thinking 'huh, maybe I should spend some time with my husband'!"
So buckle up! Hold onto your hats! Because it's time to get some answers!!!
Did he accidentally take it from some girl the night before? He didn't think so. In fact, he didn't remember going out to a bar at all. As far as he could remember he had just gone to bed, his lack of a hangover proved that, but in that case where did the ring come from? He carefully pulled it off his finger, peering closely. It was definitely silver, as Dean had seen from first glance, but one thing he'd missed the first time was the gold colored lettering all along the inside; as though the words were for the owner's eyes only. It was written in a language which Dean couldn't understand, but he just had this feeling. A feeling that the words held more depth than he could ever imagine.
“Go on, Dean, open it.” Jack encouraged with a reassuring smile, as though he could hear the internal Dean was going through. He thought it was funny—in a strange, not exactly funny, kind of way—that neither of them were trying to open it on their own, like they knew that Dean needed to get past the block that was holding him back. He almost felt like he’d rather not see the pictures he knew were right there. As soon as he opened this box, he would find out what Castiel looked like, and he would never be able to undo that.
Shaking his head he returned to his station and started packing his stuff up. He would call himself tentative friends with Cas now, though honestly he had no idea if Cas would call them that, and he didn't know what it was about the idea of being friends with Cas, but he really liked it.
She- he- why- what?
The alarm on his phone went off, warning him that it was time for his first appointment, and he silently thanked Past-Dean for knowing he would get distracted and lose track of time. He put the designs for Cas away again, and slowly walked out to the front of the store, heading over to Claire.
Plot? You meant that's not interchangeable with grumpy Cas? Damn... Someone should have probably told me that before I wrote this chapter... 😂😂😂
"If I’d just told you, you might have been able to help. And anyway, it wasn't suffering," Dean muttered. "So many people in the world are suffering-"
Yeah... Cas really is that oblivious. If it makes you happy, a little birdy told me that something exciting is going down next chapter. :D
"Okay," Dean frowned, trying to figure out if he was missing something. "Do you like kissing?"
"I'm guessing no isn't an answer," Dean sighed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before he even consciously realized it, he was back by the bedside table, picking up the ring and sliding it onto his finger—his right hand this time. He instantly felt more settled, but that just caused him more questions.
"Just coming!" Dean yelled back, brushing some of the dry leaves off his legs as he walked back in the direction of the small wooden cabin they were staying in for the two weeks they were on vacation for. It had been Cas who had actually decided it was time. They'd been dating for about a year now, and although Dean had been planning to take a break when they only just got together, business had started booming, and then Cas had some issues, and then Dean had even more issues, and by the time they were finally able to get away, it had been a year and Dean had never been happier.
Cas laughed, sounding honestly happy. "When I was very small I wanted to either be a giraffe, or an eagle."
As soon as Dean had Baby back in her stall and settled, he headed out looking for Cas. He didn't even bother checking his trailer, already knowing Cas wasn't going to be there, and after only a couple of minutes he managed to find him. Cas was sitting on  one of the lower branches of one of the trees just on the border of the field they'd set up camp in, head buried in a book.
"Yes?"
“Well, I just checked your timetable for today,” Claire announced, ”and I’ve cleared it out. You’re gonna be busy on Monday, and Benny’s going to have to cover walk-ins, but you’re going home.”
"Now I'm here," Cas agreed, looking happier than he had in weeks. "Thank you, Dean."
!!!!!!!!!!Brief content warning!!!!!!!!!
I did it! I really shouldn't be this excited about actually getting a chapter up on time... But oh well!
“Oh, Star Wars, I’ve heard of that,” Cas hummed. “I’ve never seen it, but I take it you enjoy it?”
"Nice to meet you Cas. What kind of thing are you looking for?"
"Are you?" Cas asked. It would have been odd, coming from anyone else, too blunt, too harsh and doubtful for such a joyful night. But this was Cas, and that was just what Cas did. No beating around the bush. If he wanted to ask something, he asked it.
Cas sighed down at his food. He actually needed to eat while he was a cat, and the food wasn't the worst thing he had ever eaten—at least it didn’t just taste like molecules—but he wished that he could actually talk to the Winchesters. He wished that they would be able to understand him like he understood them. Maybe then they would help him get his vessel back, and everything could go back to normal.
