“Basically.”
"Hey, we'll get ahold of him. I think Cas should really know. He might know something that can help you."
"Morning sickness, love?"
Cas drove with Sam out to Colorado. “I am worried about Dean.” He stated.
“Dean you don’t think I had-”
"I don't know! Jesus."
"Just between us girls... Who's the father?" Crowley asked, leaning over.
“Yeah, you said my name a lot last night.” Dean marking a mental point, 2 for him one for miss zero. Cas glared at him.
This was abruptly changed of moods, watching the video of the murder that happened earlier in the day.
"No, put it back," Dean said quietly. It broke Sam's heart. He watched Dean keep his head low. As they walked out, it was a silent agreement to talk about it. "Hey, Sam?" Dean asked. Dean handed his keys to him. "I don't feel good. Can you drive?"
"Well, I could really use your help," Sam said sympathetically. Dean couldn't. He felt so wrong, violation of the blade/Mark. Hanging up, feeling that familiar dark breath on his neck.
“Do this for Castiel.” Ringing in Dean’s ears, putting him on edge. Grabbing Cas by the lapel. “What the fuck was that?”
"No," Dean said quietly.
"Oh, if only," Crowley flirted. Crowley then made a lame excuse of using the restroom to shoot up. Demons don't piss. Dean heard the music play. It's almost too perfect for him. "No good." The feel of the blade, that burn of whatever, it's like heroin. His hands were reaching for it, almost doing anything for it. Felt so evil that he wanted to miscarry- so many people try to have kids. He could put it up for adoption- but the blade, Crowley, and Abaddon… In his sulk, his eyes lay upon a kid, rosary- knife? Son of a bitch… Dean followed him when he got up.
“Why would an angel blow up an ice cream parlor in your name?” Sam questioned Cas. Rewatching the video, discovering it was a hit on Metatron’s person. Dean instantly got fueled with fire, while Cas was visibly upset.
Dean struggled against this next Styne member, his shirt soaking and steeping red. “Sam!” He called for his brother’s assistance, who killed his own opponent before decapitating Dean’s.
“Like the actors?” She asked. “You look exactly like them.”
“No problem, just watch where you’re going next time. Don’t want to walk into the wrong thing.”
Eileen stood at the stove, eggs and bacon cooking in their pans. Dean tapped her shoulder to get her attention, “Where’s Sam?” he asked, taking care to enunciate his words so Eileen could understand.
“Frank Feranna?” A nurse called as she walked into the waiting room. Sam stood up.
“Yes you are. We had one hell of a ride but now… now it’s my stop.” Dean took a deep breath, preparing himself. “I’m not gonna make it outta here, so I gotta say some things, okay?” He took Sam’s near-silence as his cue.
Dean made sure the note was folded over as neatly as it had been before and placed on the bedside table with a shaky sigh. He held the necklace tightly in his palm.
The boys drove to where Dean’s ‘something great’ was located. Eileen had offered to look after Miracle while they were out.
, he began,
Both brothers exited the scene, heading straight to Baby, and drove off.
—placing it carefully into his record player.
It says posted on Feb. 2nd but for me it's the 3rd oop-
“Stop talking like that. We’re both making it out, okay? Because I’m not leaving you here.”
Dean was knocked to the floor with a loud thud, a man straddling him with a knife to his throat.
“What’s wrong?” Despite the constant joking and teasing, Dean could tell when something was up.
Sam took a knife wound to the arm—though it was only cosmetic, not dealing any mortal damage. His attacker dropped to his knees, crimson gushing from his jugular.
, Dean thought when the men bled out quicker than expected, and threw another at the man Sam was in mid-combat against.
“And you murdered my family.” Dean managed to work his hand free and shoot the man in the head, rolling from where the body would drop before it did. “Sam!” He yelled, shooting the other guy.
“Sam,” a deep voice announced, waking the man from his fitful sleep. He turned in his seat, seeing that the voice belonged to none other than Castiel. “Is he alright?”
Turning around to make the run back home, Sam bumped into a man with a long coat. Inappropriate attire for exercise, so he assumed this man was taking a walk. Alone.
Castiel’s tape sat on the bed beside Dean, and he stared at it for a short while before deciding to pick it up.
Sam put his hand on his partner’s arm and they shared a quick peck before the plates were dished out.
“Sammy, please. I need… I need you to tell me that it’s okay. Tell me it’s okay.”
“Sammy.” The name drew Sam over. “Stay wi—” he winced, pushing the pain as far as he could “—stay with me. Please.” He looked up at Sam, taking in every detail of his baby brother’s face as if this was his last chance. It sure felt like his last chance.
“How is he?”
. Of the people we’ve met and the family we’ve found along the way. Yeah, it was just me and you all those years ago, but it’s more than us now, and you have to be around so you can live a life with those people.” Sam leaned his elbows on the bedside, resting his chin on his hands in an almost prayer-like position.
“This way, Mr. Feranna.” She led him into another room, where his brother lay with a nasal cannula attached to his face. Not the first time he’d seen Dean like that—or the worst condition—and he hoped it would be the last. For a long, long time, at least.
is what was so important?” Sam complained, having sat in the car for three hours for this.
“That’s ‘cause I’m taller than you, Dean,” his brother interjected.
“What is it?”
“Sorry!” He exclaimed apologetically.
Miracle barked and Dean got up from the table, checking to see what was going on, relieved to find it was just his brother returning home.
“Ackles, Padalecki. FBI.” Dean held his badge up to the woman as he spoke, Sam following suit.
“Sammy? What’d I miss?” His voice was tired, croaky. Understandable, considering the ordeal he went through.
was written on it, which made Dean smile as he put it into his Walkman and put his headphones on. He leaned against the headboard, Miracle still right by his side, of course, and let the music—familiar songs, ones he’d played to Cas in the past—wash over him.
“Perfect timing! Eileen’s putting food on plates.” He walked back into the kitchen, Sam and Miracle with him, just as the toaster popped. Dean grabbed the toast, since Eileen’s back was turned to it, and gave it to her.
Sam runs out, stumbles a bit almost knocking over his notes, but regains his balance instantly and continues on his way to the doors.
Castiel was with Gabriel in God's new creation called Earth. Lucifer had described it as 'clingy, ugly, and stupid' but all the time he spent there just made him want to stay longer. They flew between trees, mountains and clouds, touched the water with the tips of their wings while going at maximum speed, they swam until they saw what the deepest darkness hid inside and stopped in the most spectacular places where if they stayed still enough all kinds of animals would come out to meet them.
After he stowed the car he sets to read every book in the library, and sometime later he even founds himself looking up every weapon and relevant information in the files. Later he'll had time to clean up, now he needs to be strong and smart enough so everything does not repeats again.
-But these days they went on a school trip," Denisse sits in one of the high chairs and Victoria imitates her in the seat on the left side where the first one is.
Castiel answers with something similar to a "30", but this is drowned out by a terribly loud start of music that is turned down almost instantly followed by a nervous "sorry" from Victoria.
"Do you have more brothers?" Castiel moves uncomfortable in his place and Bobby forces himself to slow his questions "My place is only about three hours to the east" when he sees Castiel nodding he gets into his car, after noticing that he does not move he asks "…Do you have a car?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel is silent as Dean places the cassette he had in his hands to play and goes back to studying Castiel's collection.
"He started to leave more often because he wants to fill the universe with places just as beautiful as this one. Okay? You are not to blame for any of that, little brother." He moved closer to the angel child and surrounded him with his large wings, closed his eyes and brought his foreheads together. He could feel Castiel smiling slightly and he couldn't help but look at him with an even bigger smile that then turned into a malicious one.
On the way to school there is no music and Sam recites formulas non-stop.
"Well, we didn't invite you just for milkshakes, now the fun begins," they all smile at each other and he just looks at them curiously.
Victoria lets out a small laugh and gets up and walks away towards a corner of the rink.
He turns on the radio and sets it to a low level, something rare for him.
His hands stop the pages landing in one where he can see a pencil sketch of a bee surrounded by flowers, it seems almost real. Dean watches it for a moment and then continues turning the pages, there are several simply drawings filled with those unknown letters, others have small drawings of what he believes is something supernatural, but those drawings with landscapes, people, moments of a normal life occupy all off the pages they are on.
"Great" the other girls come over and leave the small theater.
Several minutes later, breakfast is ready and he is serving it when Dean comes down, attracted by the smell of the food, barely aware of what's going on around him, but feeling the need of food and when he passes by and sees the only sleeping person in the house and sees that he is about to fall with one foot already rosing the floor he gets closer and lifts him up a bit, moving him away from the corner.
They had been there a long time, alone. The rest of the angels were not yet notified about this new creation and the other archangels have 'very important occupations to be postponed for wasting time playing with a new toy of God.'
All his memories are again at his disposal and he never believed there were so many. Hundreds of years completely erased, so many half-memories, so many implanted lies. He closes his eyes again and lets out a slow sigh.
The feeling of how dark was under that unknown sea disappears and a cozy wind and summer sun tickle his face. He takes an air mouthful, a habit that has stick to him after so many years of being in Jimmy's body, and a smile grows on his face.
"Are you all okay with me cooking today?" He asks after hesitating to enter the kitchen. Bobby and Sam turn to see and shrug their shoulders, Dean looks at the others as if they were crazy, but after rolling his eyes he shrugs his shoulders to and goes to sit on the couch.
The face is similar, yes, but everything about him is completely different, the way he speaks, the way he holds himself, even his smell is different. When he notices this last thought he blushes a little, but as he places the coffee in a white cup, along with the lid he has time to compose himself and get his cheeks a little less red.
He turns his back on his new toy and approaches the space where all his torture weapons are located.
Thanks a lot.
He bites his lip and opens it.
The place is full of pastel colors, highlighting the calm that reigns.
Still lying down he stretches his whole body, and that's when he discovers that his clothing style has changed, a thin yellow and orange sweater with two giant purple and black squares; light blue jean pants; and some black socks with little decorating bees are the first things he notices.
He went back a few meters, always watching out for another demon to appear.
"It's not a problem." He shrugs it off and heads to where the vegetables are.
"Finally!, we've been waiting forever, old man" followed by Dean yawning.
God, his father, decided to give him a second chance. No matter how many centuries passed, no matter that all his memories were at his disposal, he would never be able to understand him.
"Seriously, man. His face was identical to Castiel's, but he was dressed in a suit and his tone of voice was less gravelly" Dean tries to explain.
The memories of Sam and Dean building with every bite he takes.
"Thank you, Sam. Take care" he finally lets go of his grip on the minor who smiles and then talks.
“Benny. The friend who…”
“Hm-hm.”
Dean frowns. What is he—Oh. The kinky bastard!
He likes when they play games like that. They’re not really games, actually. Dean does that when he wants to talk. It’s weird, but Castiel’s used to it. Dean doesn’t like to talk about stuff like everyone else, he says it’s girly to talk about their day and do nothing else. So they made it into a game. One of them asks a question, and they have to both answer it.
Cas tries to look smug. He only half succeeds. Dean imagines it’s hard when you have something in your ass. “Or what?”
“Okay,” Dean nods, and something occurs to him suddenly. “We’re—we can still be friends, right? Not just… I don’t know, coworkers. I don’t think I could…” he trails off.
He’ll deal with it if it becomes important.
“No, I’m sorry,” he offers. “I was being rude.”
He almost gives up when Cas pulls him into bed, grunting, and tries to cuddle him to death.
“You know,” Cas answers.
On Wednesday evening, Dean reaches the clinic at six thirty, a bit earlier than agreed with Cas (okay, a lot earlier, Cas won’t be there until seven), and he has to admit as he exits the car and take the time to look at the building that he’s pretty excited about being here.
“It was, but hum…” Dean runs a hand on the back on his neck, “I was wondering. You’re an angel. Maybe, you didn’t mean it like we would. I don’t know if it was in general, or, um, personal but in a general way. I mean, this could be interpreted differently depending on who… you know. I mean. Yeah.”
“Yes, of course,” Graham nods. “So minimum wage, for one practice. What about three?”
He’s starting to sweat, abs tightening right in front of Dean’s eyes like some delicious… abs.
“Usually, when children are being bad, they get spanked.”
“Sit down, Mister Bass,” Ankler barks at Aaron.
“Just making sure you’re comfortable.”
Uncomfortable silence answers him.
He’s overdoing it. Aaron will see right through him. Won’t he?
,” Video-Cas screams as he comes, and Video-Dean laughs.
And Novak hums,
When he finds the courage to look Cas in the eye, Cas is smiling shyly.
Sam clasps his shoulder, seemingly satisfied. “You’ll manage.”
” Now the Doc’s voice has a panicked edge, which somehow reassures Dean. At least he’s taking it seriously. “
“Close your eyes,” Dean asks gently as he pushes away from his chair as well.
Cas nods, “Yes, of course.”
“Huh. We really don’t know the same Cassie, do we?”
Dean waves at him and marches on. There’s no point in delaying the inevitable.
Dean follows his lead. You really
“Spread your legs. I don’t want you rubbing on your thighs either.”
“Fuck,” Dean breathes. “I hate seeing myself on camera.”
“Dean.”
------
“Would you introduce us?” Aaron asks.
Cas is just a shadow on the other end of the glass, standing in the backyard with his head tilted back. Dean can only make out his profile. He seems to be looking at the sky.
Why does it all feel like it’s going to go down?
Cas cants his head in surprise, “What do you mean?”
His cheeks are red, his lips slick with spit, and his eyes shining with intent. Dean would kiss him silly if he thought he could get away with it.
Dean sighs.
“Where do you live, Dean?”
“Well there’s three of them,” Cas half-shrugs. “If the interview process is indeed shorter now that we’ve condensed the medical history part of it, we could… ask about a masturbatory session. I think it would be great to separate those who only came for the money and won’t show on the actual start of the study sessions from those who are really interested. What do you think?”
“Yep.”
“Dean has a background,” Cas says, very patiently. “He has knowledge in physiology, data analysis and gynecology. It doesn’t matter to me that he doesn’t have the credentials to prove it.”
“Yeah,” Dean says. “I’d love to do that. I like having secrets with you.”
“Sorry,” Dean breathes, clearing his throat. Thankfully his shame stay internal, for now. He can’t feel any heat in his cheeks, which is good. “Plateau phase. At, uh…” he looks at his own chronometer, sitting awkwardly in his hand, “six minutes, forty-nine seconds. Got it.”
Cas looks away, cheeks turning a bit pink, “It’s because I feel the same.”
He lets it happen. He lets Aaron crash their lips together, and gently opening Dean’s mouth with his tongue.
“Are you okay?” Dean asks with a smile.
Does he want them to date?
Dean sighs, putting an emphasis on how annoyed he is, “The Doc’s planner. His appointments.”
He never thought it would be that good. It’s just a dick going into his ass, who knew it could feel this way?
-_-_-_-_-_-
And, yeah, Dean’s pissed all right. But yelling and fuming apparently doesn’t help his case, so he doesn’t tell the Doc to go fuck himself like he wants to. Instead, he rolls his eyes, and take the out that is offered.
But he doesn’t.
“You’re the one who brought it up.”
Michael does what their father tells them, almost gleefully. Gabriel doesn’t move. So Michael walks over to him, completely naked, and starts helping him out of his shirt.
“Then what is it,” Castiel asks, because he can see how out of it Gabriel seems.
“Listen,” he says, rubbing the bridge of his nose. Now’s not the time to get a stress-headache. “It was nice seeing you, but I really need to get going.”
Dean has to stop with the trust issues.
So Cas does, gently grabbing Dean’s hips.
God, he’s so fucking turned on, he almost regrets that he won’t get pounded tonight. But he’s okay with it. Seeing Cas unravel under Dean’s hands will be reward enough. And maybe Cas will have enough energy left to return the favor, or maybe suck him off?
"Guilty as charged, mother."
“Thanks, Jody.” They sat around the table eating steak, potatoes, greens with bacon, and what felt like a spread for Thanksgiving. Cas didn’t eat but he enjoyed watching and being involved in the family dinner. Jody and Dean got up, leaving Sam, Cas, and Alex at the table. Coming back out with a box, opening it revealing a pink cake. “It’s a girl!” Alex said out loud.
"Well played…" Dean ends up calling Crowley but hangs up. Sam also called to update. Sam could hear Dean- he still sounds sick, and the bloodshot weary eyes when he left. Sam knew something was more than just wrong, wasn't sure if Dean was afraid to tell, or Dean didn't know himself.
"No, he was a random guy. I don't even know his name... Happy?" Something snapped in Dean. Crowley is the first one he actually admits it too, it was half a lie, but he still admitted he was pregnant… He should've told Crowley to shut up or ignore. Now he said something. Slamming Crowley against the counter. "I swear to fucking God, you dare hint or say anything about this to Sam or Cas, I'll end you."
"Oh, Dean… I love it when you play rough and talk dirty at the same time." Dean threw his hands off Crowley, grossed out. "Why haven't you told Feathers? I see why Sam, it's Samantha- coddle you and take away your beer. Why not Cassie? I would think your little bromance for each other, you tell him everything." Dean made a face, that wicked smirk Dean wanted to also slap off. Dean just shuffled his eyes back to the table, avoiding the look.
“Can we take this elsewhere?” Sam said pulling them both upstairs. Dean instantly kicked a chair over. Cas looked either to murder Dean or to start crying… probably the first.
"Really? Okay, you get the mark, you get a fever that's a week-long- you went to the doc, he apparently did nothing besides feeling you up, then like the following week- you get sick at the weirdest times. You don't want to talk about it even "if it's just the flu"-" Sam was cut off by a loud sob from Dean, he stopped. Dean was shaking, biting his fist trying to stop, Dean is hardly like this unless something really breaks him. Dean had his other arm slouched, hiding his face from him. Sam went on one knee, putting his hand on his back- he flinched away. "Please don't! Just- just go away, Sam!" Dean shouted in his face. It struck a chord with Sam but huffed away before he made it worse.
“Don’t,” Dean repeats. “You need to wake up, now, buddy.”
“Was there something you needed, Sam?” Cas asks, always concerned.
And, really, it doesn’t hurt that Dean is gorgeous, has an easy smile that could charm the pants off of anybody that walks into their office, and can type faster than any secretary Castiel’s ever had.
With that, Dean rings the bell. The door opens on Doc Novak and a young woman, blond hair expertly drawn back in a complicated bun, pearl earrings shining dimly in the light of the foyer. Her blue dress looks mighty expensive, and a bit out of place for a casual dinner. But Dean figures she doesn’t go out much. Maybe she wanted to wear something nice, for once.
It’s fine. Cas is not worried about it. So, Dean’s gonna go home, take a hot shower, go to work and help himself to a nice glass of Jack.
Right. One of them still has their wits about them, at least.
Cas has never looked so scared ever since Dean’s met him.
“No,” Dean groans, and tries to go faster.
“Well, Daddy always said I should be a proper wife and think about Cassie first but…” she sighs, and hesitates.
Dean’s forehead hits the table in a gesture of desperation before he can even think of holding it back, and he grunts as it bounces on the polished wood. “I can’t believe it,” he whispers. Then he pushes himself up. He’s pretty sure there’s a bright red spot on his forehead now. “Why me?”
Aaron follows him.
“Hi,” he says, shifting on his feet.
“I was hiding from everyone.”
Naked, of course, covered in sweat, which means he drags with him every ounce of Sam’s hair and dust stuck inside the carpet as he goes. Fuck his life. He feels like he’s never going to get better again.
Benny huffs, “Omega. What else?”
Everything around him is Dean. The sounds, the smell, the heat. Dean, Dean, Dean. He wants to shout Dean’s name, but when he opens his mouth his voice is barely a whisper.
Dean gets a shiver from the thought alone.
“I do enjoy tasting you, whatever the act, but I’m not forgetting why we’re here.”
Just as he’s settling with this plan, he’s interrupted in his train of thoughts by a knock at the door.
It’s a strange feeling, the day you disappear. The moment you know you’ll disappear, for sure. Especially when there’s a special someone in your life. That feeling, Castiel Milton is experiencing it right now, as he looks at Dean. His perfect Dean. His partner in crime. His other half. It’s a strange, calm panic that settles over him, making his whole body shiver with anticipation, fear, and maybe a little bit of excitement.
“We cannot sanction this,” Zachariah Adler says, an eyebrow raised as he peruses Castiel’s report on the study. “This is… I don’t have words for this.”
He groans. “What time is it?”
“Go ahead.”
“Don’t move.”
Dean hums as an answer. “Guess s’time for a lil’ nap,” he slurs.
Cas seems surprised by the question, but only for a second. “Well. As well as can be, considering my circumstances…”
“Okay,” he finally says. “Go change. We’ll figure it out as we go.”
Dean lets out a laugh. “Really? That’s what you’re going with?”
Castiel dismisses his embarrassment with a wave of his hand. “There’s nothing we can do. Officially, that is.”
Dean frowns at that. Castiel can almost see the wheels turning inside his head. For a long minute, he’s silent, before he flops down on the seat facing Castiel’s desk. Leaning forward, he rests his chin on his hand.
Dean’s not one to refuse an offer of free food, so they find a little steakhouse on the road back to the clinic – might as well put in a bit of work before Dean has to go back to class – and they both settle for a nice, juicy burger, some fries and a big glass of sweet tea.
“That’s not on the form.”
When Dean leaves, Castiel throws up. He spends a solid hour in the bathroom, above the toilet, waiting for everything he ate since forever to come out. Dean has found someone else. Is it Castiel’s fault? Is Dean like everyone else, now? Doesn’t he want to spend his life with Castiel?
“So what,” Sam scoots closer to the table, “you watch them…”
Dean wishes he didn’t feel his heart constrict at the sight of Cas being so miserable. He wishes he didn’t love him so Goddamn much. Because as much as he loves Cas, the hates he bears for him is almost equal in size. He’s always been annoyed, slightly, at Cas’s sense of possession, at how jealous he could become. But after Lisa, it was never the same between them. He wishes he didn’t feel a damn thing.
Maybe he’s not all there, yet, after driving half a day and sleeping more than ten hours after that. It just strikes Dean as odd that he hasn’t already launched into a detailed account of what happened on his hunt. Like he usually does.
There’s no up, no down, no outside world anymore. Dean’s sole focus is Cas. There’s something, in the back of his mind, telling him he should be indignant, but his heat won’t let his brain catch up with what’s happening. His body knows something great is about to take place, so he just nods.
“Do you want to get out of here?” Aaron asks.
“Doc. Please.”
“May I remind you,” Cas seethes, voice growing colder and colder by the second, “that I am a soldier of Heaven? I know how to fight!”
She stares for a few seconds, then slowly, clearly unconvinced, she nods.
“But I won’t get paid for the Study part of the work, anymore.”
Castiel scoots closer, but this time he lies on his back, and stares at the ceiling. Somehow he’s self-conscious, now. He doesn’t want to look at Dean. He feels a bit ashamed.
“Do you hurt?”
Or, well. Maybe he’s more ashamed than tired.
“We don’t panic. We answer their questions, just like we talked about, okay?”
“Okay. Okay. I just need… just a bit more. To get, huh, wet,” Dean says.
As soon as he steps inside his house, Castiel is assaulted by bouts of feminine laughter.
He tries to find the sheets to cover himself, but they’re not under his legs anymore after he kicked them off during the night. They’re not even on the bed anymore. He’s getting a bit cold.
They’re both sweating, but so far Dean can only smell the slick that keeps pouring and pouring out of him. He’s not sure he won’t faint from dehydration before they can finish at this rate.
’. Dean smiles, smugly, and shrugs. “Just sayin’.”
“Drink,” he orders.
Dean blinks again, “I’m just wondering what I did to deserve this.”
Michael chooses this moment to come running out of the house. “Gabie!”
“And we can do the masturbation sessions at home, yes, very good.”
“Of course,” answers Cas as he does just that.
Cas sighs, “It might be a problem, but we can’t know that yet.” He takes the form from under Dean, sliding it to his side, and goes on.
“Can’t walk,” Dean protests.
He hums, thoughtful. “Think we should get down, find something to eat, maybe let Sammy know we’re alive?”
He stops dead when he notices Dean.
Dean’s way past trying to understand what Sam feels. He needs to escape this place. Now.
He pushes at Castiel’s chest until Castiel complies, and comes to hover over him. Dean lowers his body down, until their cocks are touching. Castiel gasps. Yes, it’s good. It’s very good, until Dean starts moving his hips frenetically, and then it’s perfect.
, Dean is actually jerking off a son of God! He still can’t believe it. And, hey, maybe he should focus a little. It’s all so new and unbelievable that he could almost forget what he’s doing.
“Coffee?” She simply asks.
He just rubs his cheek on Cas’s shoulder, soaking in his warmth. His erection is gone.
He doesn’t need to say it twice. Cas breathes a small, “Yes,” against his mouth, and pushes in.
Dean nods vigorously. He opens his eyes again and gives Cas a pained look. “It’s not like last time. This time it’s worse.”
“No!” Dean bursts again. Dammit, his heart hurts from beating so hard. “Because it concerns me! Okay? It’s because of me! Fuck…”
Gabriel doesn’t answer, instead shaking his head again.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Dean almost drops the dishes in the sink, but he catches himself at the last moment. Those are their only plates, he’s not about to break them.
Pam shakes her head. “No. I mean…” she clicks on something Victor can’t see. “When he was four or five, his house caught on fire. He was playing with his dad’s lighter and wanted to see if the curtains would catch.” She looks up, “Doesn’t mean he started killing people after that, though.”
“Hm…” Dean let out, still looking around. Finally, his eyes land on Castiel. “So, hum,” he starts, shuffling on his feet. Cas wishes he would sit. It’s almost lunch time. They could go out to grab a bite. “I’m sorry but I still have stuff to do, so I can’t really stay and chat. Do you have your notes? I can type them tonight and then we can go over them tomorrow.”
“Are you calling me a child?”
Cas’s eyebrows pinch together at that. “Is everything alright?”
“Fuck,” he almost spits, head dropping against Castiel’s collarbone.
“Uh, not really,” Dean answers, touched by the concern he can hear in her voice.
Cas is taken aback for a second, and the only thing he can do is take a step forward and loom menacingly over Graham.
Dean gets a whiff of annoyance drifting from him. The clerk’s not wearing any blockers, and he’s a very pissed off Alpha, apparently. What’s he’s angry about, Dean can’t say. In any case, Dean didn’t think you could smell entitlement, but there it is.
“Technicalities,” Rufus spits. “The place she’s been dumped is on the edge of New York and New Jersey. Cops can’t agree on who should lead the case, so we took over. And you’re it.”
I’ve seen what you found. You’re a cam boy, now? Seriously, Gabriel? Exposing yourself on the internet, that’s all you found to make money? You disgust me.
His right hand, the one initially on his dick, finds his hole. He’s wet, alright, leaking on the back of his thighs. He doesn’t need to move his fingers much around his hole before they’re coated in slick, and he goes back to his dick again.
The glass is still in his hand, so he brings it to Cas’s mouth. Cas glare at it, but finally takes it from Dean, and drinks it slowly.
Dean gives it a resentful look before he presses the ‘talk’ button.
“It’s Castiel.”
“Maybe he has a record?”
“That’s fine.”
“Alright. Okay.”
“I—I—I—can’t do it, Cas, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry but I—I can’t, and I don’t—”
Dean laughs, weakly. “No. Don’t have time. You work me too hard.”
“Who? Cas?” Dean huffs a bitter laugh, “Nah. He’ll call me when he needs me. Why would I call him?”
, he thinks, before the reality of what Balthazar’s saying hits him in the face. Amelia and him, they haven’t talked in a while. He’s barely seeing her anymore. Balthazar’s right. This, this whole thing, the study,
He holds on to his mug like a lifeline, and ambles to the door, about to leave. Dean debates with himself for a millisecond. Should he let Sam go, selfishly, so that he can spend some quality time with Cas, or should he try to talk to his brother, who, somehow, is acting a bit weird? The kid never misses an opportunity to talk and chit-chat, and now he’s all but bolting out the door. This isn’t normal.
And that’s how he started to notice things. How Castiel held him tight with his legs wrapped around Dean’s lower back when they had sex, subtly directing his movements so Dean would hit the right spot. How the angel downright
Cas takes three quick steps forward until he’s all up in her face. She shrinks back, visibly surprised. Oh, this doesn’t smell good. At all.
She nods, pausing the video, face beet red.
Everybody thinks they’re a couple of perverts, and now rumors are starting to circulate, saying Castiel is only doing it because he can’t get it up at home and gets his rocks off by watching other people.
“Are you okay?” Aaron frowns, concerned.
“You are with Aaron,” he finally says. Dean can barely feel his weight on him anymore. “And I’m with Amelia.”
Castiel has no word for it. It shouldn’t matter, because Balthazar has been a part of their Study, and he’s a friend too. But this time it’s someone who’s had sex with Dean, who still has sex with Dean, presumably.
Dean has no choice but to spread his legs, so that Cas can fit between them. He dropped the t-shirt a while back, and Dean can feel the heat radiating from his skin. He wishes he could shred his own t-shirt, too.
“Now please inform Roberta of the change. How soon can you start?”
“Okay,” he says, because he doesn’t know what to say yet, but he can’t stand the silence. Tentatively, he extends a hand toward Aaron. “I’m sorry that… I made it seem like you couldn’t even ask.”
Surprised, Dean pulled away, a questioning look on his face.
It’s not Dean’s fault that he volunteered to pick Dean up at work ever since Dean’s piece of crap car died two days ago.
Still, it feels like something broke between them. Tonight, things are fairly tense. Last Wednesday they were going on a date together, so this evening is bound to bring back memories that now seem like they come from another life altogether.
And then it’s too much. So he pulls his fingers away, lets go of his dick, and sprawls in the middle of the bed, breath short but tingling all over. He enjoys the afterglow the most. The weird little taste of orgasm in his mouth. The buzz under his skin.
“You’re not doing anything,” Cas answers.
When Dean reaches the door to the observation room, it’s open, but Cas isn’t there.
When Dean looks up, Cas is intently staring at his own fingers rubbing Dean’s ass but there’s a knowing smile on his lips.
“I’m sorry,” she adds after a few seconds. “I thought Dean knew.”
On the other hand, they’re leaving tomorrow morning, and this hotel is fairly nice. As a neutral place to pour his heart out, this one is far from the worst. And if things go well, then what’s better than a nice, fancy hotel room to start a relationship?
He dares a glance at Cas, and sees that his expression hasn’t changed.
The pressure’s not good at all, the faucet is old, and small, but Dean ducks his head under it anyway, splashing his torso, his arms, everywhere he can reach, to wash off the blockers.
When he dares a look at Cas, the Doc is staring straight at Adler, a look of deer-caught-in-headlights on his face. Something incredible happens. He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. He’s speechless. Doc Novak, the Castiel Novak, the asshole who always has something to say, is struck speechless.
“Cas,” Dean says as casually as he can.
“Not exactly?”
“Sure sounded like it,” Dean mumbles.
With a sigh, Cas grabs the bottle of lube again. He drops a dollop directly on Dean’s ass, making him yelp.
“So you had sex in your car, at a drive-in, if I follow?”
“I understand,” he says as he nods.
“yeah,” Dean agrees, nodding. “Of course.”
Dean huffs a nervous laugh.
“He fucking told you you’d have trouble finding a job if you keep on with it! All I hear is him threatening to fire you!”
“Yeah. You don’t need to tell me,” Dean counters.
Dean pushes back again, trying to avoid fucking himself back on Cas’s tongue, but despite what he said, the Doc’s good at this.
“That he told you?” Dean asks. “I didn’t. But he… kinda admitted he wasn’t interested in kids.”
“Right,” Dean repeats, suddenly vexed that his brother doesn’t believe his lie.
He shouldn’t have agreed to come, he’s too tired for this.
Dean turns to her. She seems apologetic and pleading at the same time.
From the corner of his eyes, Dean watches as Cas fumbles with his pants until he’s pushing them down violently in frustration. His underwear follow just as fast, and soon he’s standing behind Dean, butt in the wind and erection proudly standing at attention.
Sam lets out a long suffering sigh. He knows that Dean knows what he means. Hence his bitchy tone when he answers, “You’ve been antsy for days. The bunker is so clean I can see my reflection in the leather seats. What’s wrong?”
“You’re right,” Benny smiles.
The others are just looking at them in turn, probably half-fascinated, half-apprehensive, as if they were watching a tennis match.
Cas exhales through his nose as Dean’s finger breaches his rim. Dean can see that it’s an effort for him not to tense. To help, he sucks on Cas’s cock, letting his tongue do most of the work instead of bobbin his head. He’s too focused on his hand to be thinking too hard about the cock in his mouth.
He’s not sure Cas will make it if he keeps going. Discreetly, he opens the bottle of lubricant as he starts kissing Cas’s shaft again. He makes sure to warm the gel between his fingers, and, while keeping an eye on Cas’s face, brings his hand close to Cas’s butt.
He can’t stop watching, like he’s witnessing a car crash in real time, except the car has Naomi in it and Cas is the one who cut the breaks.
Cas settles a bit more comfortably against Dean, the top of his head nesting in the crook of Dean’s neck. Unable to help himself, Dean takes a whiff of Cas’s scent. His hair smells like Sam’s brand of hippie shampoo, and as much as he would very much like not to think about his brother in this moment, it manages to calm the beating of his heart a little.
Dean doesn’t dare move. This is too amazing.
“Bad-mouthed a customer,” Dean shrugs. “Boss didn’t like it. It was one of his friends, so…” he trails off.
“Alright.”
With a worried frown, he pushes a hand against Dean’s brow. Dean tries to slap it away, to no avail.
-_-_-_-_-
Well, there’s no going back now. He hands the paper to the clerk. “I hope they don’t mind omegas in pre-med,” he says, not holding back his anger anymore. “I’d hate for them to think I’m only there to find someone to settle with.”
He needs help. He needs a doctor.
Cas’s eyes widen. “Oh. Oh, yes. I understand. Of course.”
“No,” Agent Barnes shakes her head, “thank you. Please, sit.”
Well, he said he didn’t want to upset Dean. That was about right.
He hangs up harder than he would’ve liked, but he can’t stand the pain anymore. Crumbling to the floor, he lets out a dry, desperate sob.
He sits in front of his plate and watches her. He should be talking to her, asking how her day was, but he’s so tired he can’t really find the energy to.
Cas sees him looking at it, and holds the bag up. “I told Amelia I was planning to come by and she insisted that I bring you… the whole fridge, apparently,” he says with a smile. “She’s worried you might not be feeling well enough to cook.”
“You seem uncomfortable.”
“Dean,” Cas says as he reaches them, “Can I talk to you for a second?”
Dean sighs, “And you don’t mind using Heaven’s training for porn?”
He’s too preoccupied to truly get into the mood, right now. He needs to speak to Gabriel. Dean seems to sense it, and he turns to Michael again. “Okay, Dickwad, I’m gonna tell you what I wanna do to you, how ‘bout that?”
“A friend?”
“Ow! Ow! That’s… Cas, pubes! That’s pubes, careful!”
Novak nods, “Yes, but the amount I produce isn’t much, I believe as a result of the frequency of my activities.”
The thing is, if Dean forgets about the crazy look in Cas’s eyes, he has to admit that it makes sense. What would they do, if the FBI arrested them? They’d be sent to different jails. And, God, their parents! Not Castiel’s, his mother is a huge bitch, and he doesn’t care much about Anna, but when he thinks about his own mom and dad, he can’t help the feeling of sickness that insinuates itself into his bones. And Sam? Jesus! What would Sam think?
Castiel considers what Dean is saying, but he still doesn’t see where it’s going. There’s no way he can turn back, now.
Cas’s eyebrows rise up, almost imperceptibly, and Dean thinks he can detect the ghost of a smile on his lips. “Okay?”
“Hum… well, first, you need good communication with your partner. Considering it’s Cas we’re talking about, you need to be very direct.” He finally turns his head in her direction. “If you don’t tell him you want to have sex, and enjoy it, he won’t know. He won’t do anything about it.”
“We don’t have to talk about work, you know.”
“They have roadblocks all around the country,” Castiel answers.
A third ring, and Amelia picks up. Dean’s stomach lurches.
Castiel stays quiet. He feels like he’s in a trance. He wants to. He really does. A passing, frightening thought crosses his mind. This is wrong. This is everything Mother stands against. She would disown him if she knew he wants to touch or being touched by another man. She’d say God would find a way to punish him if he gives in his desires. She’d say he’s going to Hell. But he finds that he doesn’t care. He wants Dean. He’s always wanted Dean. Dean is different, just like Castiel.
Baltazar has already seated himself in the chair in front of Castiel’s desk, and he’s leaning back, hands folded in his lap. He’s pleased with himself, something twinkling in his eyes. Nothing good can come out of his mouth in this moment.
“I dunno,” Cas answers.
,” Sam blurts. “
They’ve started working together in Cas’s office, Dean sitting in front of Cas on the other side of the desk, and he can’t imagine going back to working alone in the lobby.
Only then do Cas’s eyelids flutter shut for a second, and a beautiful moan escapes him.
“I don’t like it,” Gabriel tries again, pulling on the rope holding his arms above his head.
Dean chuckles, and Castiel can tell he’s proud of himself.
’, “and tell Dean he has to put out? For science?”
Dean’s always loved the way Cas delivers this bit of info, like it’s no big deal, but the way he intones it brings forth the deepest of shame buried inside the Alphas they interview, and it’s usually a real pleasure to watch.
“I didn’t just call you as a doctor. You know… I…”
Dean nods, and whispers a small, “Yes, Sir,” that comes out of nowhere.
“I didn’t say you could leave,” Novak calls after him as Dean exits the room. “Dean!! Come back here!”
“Good. The parameters are good, then.”
“I’m sure we could find some people.”
This doesn’t make any sense, but Dean tries not to let show how stupid he thinks it sounds. “Okay…”
She pouts, trying to tug at Dean’s heartstrings. It’s working.
“Dean, look at me!”
Dean’s absolutely not moved by Cas defending him. He’s not. The sudden warmth in his cheeks only comes the heat. “Well, it is what it is. I’ll find something else.”
Truth is, Dean knows Cas will probably not appreciate the fact that Dean has a boyfriend. Mostly because that means Aaron can distract Dean, take him away from the lab. Not that he wants to, but Cas will probably see it this way.
“We’re just trying to assess your level of awareness when it comes to your partner’s needs,” Dean tells him through his teeth.
“So,” Cas breaks the silence, “anything you want me to remove?”
He’s on the verge of panic now, so Castiel steps into his space, until Dean is looking right at him.
“Fine, I’ll come by after Christmas,” he says, suddenly weary.
Dean doubt that Cas gets his rocks off doing anything, really.
And then something occurs to Dean. “Wait. How did you know I was involved in it?”
“Come on,” Cas pats his cheek, and he tries to be gentler this time. “Let’s get out of here.”
He discreetly adjusts his erection as he walks away, but of course Dean catches it. His mouth waters.
By the time they get to the ceremony, Cas has sobered up a little, and now it’s Dean’s turn to become a blushing, staggering mess.
“I don’t see how who’s in the class changes anything.”
“That he is,” Dean agrees.
“Yeah, let’s do this!” He clasps his hands together to hide the anxiety bubbling up his chest.
The journey Cas’s face takes is too complicated to understand anything of what he must be feeling.
“Don’t wait for me,” he manages.
-_-_-_-_-_-
He doesn’t want to be more explicit than this, but thankfully he thinks Aaron gets it.
to you? I have to bend over backwards to get him to tell me about his day!”
“Is it…?”
“Say the full sentence, Dean.”
“Oh.”
,” Graham just answers.
The sounds around him fade. He thinks they broke the door open. It’s not even a conscious thought, he just knows. But that’s not even important. What’s important is that Dean is in his arms, and he’s about to join him.
“I understand you’re in pain, but so far there’s nothing telling me you’re in danger,” he says as he helps Dean up.
A year ago, he would’ve thought that was amazing. He would’ve led the way, flirting and teasing the whole time, would’ve let Aaron fuck him hard and rough against the door ‘cause he would’ve barely let him close it once they got there before he’d have jumped him.
Right?
Dean blinks at him.
“I need to work on it again. As soon as possible. Tonight,” Novak answers, annoyed. “I’ll leave early, you may join me around eight at the Hotel bar. Now please,” he looks up, finally, “I have a triplets’s birth to prepare, I’m sure you have a lot to do, so if you don’t mind…”
“You’re jealous?” Dean asks, incredulous.
“You don’t want him to know you’re a slut,” Michael keeps saying as he pushes his finger in.
“Incest. Pedophilia. Child molesting,” Gabriel answers, adverting his eyes. “I don’t know the right term for it.”
“I would agree with Dean,” Cas nods, sagely. “First,” he starts, before Sam can say anything else, “You are absolutely not qualified to participate in anything remotely scientific.”
From: Gabriel M. (
“Yes, that’s right. Not the first scene like this, either. Half a dozen others, making their way up here.”
“You’re right,” he chuckled. “I definitely enjoyed that.”
“No. You can’t, Sam,” he choked out through winded breaths. The younger Winchester’s phone was already in his hand, 9-1-1 dialled. “Sam, don’t.” Dean didn’t have the energy to argue right now.
“Dean? You awake?” The older Winchester’s eyes opened and scanned the room, landing on Sam.
“Hey, Eileen. See, Sammy? Told you it’d all be fine.” He parted with Eileen and played with Miracle as he left, going to his room.
, Dean. You were more of a father than Dad ever was. That’s why I even went to Stanford, because you thought I was smart enough, and that was a good enough reason for me.” He felt a sense of embarrassment, saying this to Dean
Here comes the pain.
Almost as if on cue, Sam chose that moment to take one of the slices and shove it into Dean’s face, letting out a laugh as he did so.
Moonlight was blocked almost completely by the rickety walls, only allowing small slivers to escape. The floor creaked with every footstep, so the boys concluded that stealth was going to get them nowhere.
“I get how much you hate these guys but you gotta focus, alright?”
“You’re sure you’ll be okay here?” Sam signed to Eileen. Hunting wasn’t her profession anymore but it still haunted her. If something happened to her while Sam was working, he’d never forgive himself—still hadn’t forgiven himself for her death three years ago.
“You- you’re bleeding. Dean, tell me you’re okay. Please.” His voice was pained and desperate.
“Not just anything, Sammy. Something great.”
“Of course. Anything for Dean.” The angel was tense, Sam could tell.
The engine roared to life before quieting down to a low rumble. Dean might’ve never gotten the chance to see his Baby again, had Sam actually listened to him instead of trying to save him.
“Thank you for the compliment, officer,” he said with a prideful smile. “We get that a lot, but I can assure you that if we were actors, we wouldn’t be working crime scenes.”
“Hard to handle, huh?” Dean let out a dry, slightly pained chuckle. “Sorry to uh, burst your bubble, but you’re not really my type.”
Updates come when they do, okay? I'm
The room dimmed for a few seconds but Dean continued holding on. Holding onto Sam, to the look in his eyes. That damned desperate, puppy-dog look, telling Dean to stay.
Now on the bed again, Dean opened the envelope and emptied it into his hand, revealing a note, a cassette tape and a small vial attached to a chain, emitting a soft, blue glow. He unfolded the note, reading it quietly to himself.
“I’ll give you two some time. If you need anything, call for a nurse.” Sam nodded and the woman left, leaving Sam alone with Dean. The only sound was his breathing and the soft beeping of monitors.
“Cas—” Sam was taken by surprise, given it was the middle of the night. “—they said he’ll make a full recovery but I was thinking maybe you could heal him, so we can go home.”
“I got you. You’re getting out of here.” Sam’s attempts to reassure his brother were fruitless, Dean waving him away, knowing his fate. Though the weapon itself was no longer embedded in him, he could still feel where it had sliced, the somewhat sudden shock causing him to sputter a cough.
“Dude.” Sam didn’t look impressed.
It was Chuck’s fault that Sam was worrying so much. He killed Eileen with the snap of his fingers. Jack may have been God, but that didn’t mean something else couldn’t come between them.
“You don’t mind if we?” Sam gestured to the scene, getting a nod of confirmation from the police officer.
“Not much. You got pretty beat up but the ambulance got to you in time. Saved your ass.” Sam chuckled, trying to make light of the situation.
“I’m not- I can’t. Dean, please… I can’t lose you. I can’t do this alone.”
When the face of his watch caught his eye, Dean finished cleaning his weapons and put them away. News articles would be updated by now, so it would be easier to find a case.
“Yeah, sure. Don’t you want to—” He was gone, as suddenly as he’d appeared.
This man gave Dean a flashy, cocky smile. “The name’s Leon Styne,” he said.
“I, uh…” Sam cleared his throat. “What you said, back in that old house, how you were proud of who I was. That was all because of
As soon as the words escaped his mouth, the younger Winchester regretted it. More men invaded—five, to be precise, which for guys this difficult to take down, was a lot.
“Thanks,” Sam breathed. “That was… surprisingly easy, right?”
“That’s me.” It had been a long few hours but finally, maybe, he could see Dean.
A soft glow emanated from Cas’ hand, bringing Dean’s face back to life, despite the man being
He’d expected a sudden appearance but wasn’t surprised when there was no response. Castiel and Dean did share a ‘profound bond’, after all. Though Sam knew what that was code for.
“Out for a run. I’m making breakfast now so it’ll be done when he’s back.” She checked the food, flipping the bacon when it began to sizzle.
Sam caved, speaking his mind. “It just doesn’t feel right, you know? Like there’s a catch. I mean, Jack just
“I’m okay. Just miss him,” he reassured Miracle, who was now gazing up at him with big, dark eyes. “He’ll be back. He always comes back.”
“It better be. I’m getting too old for this crap.” Sam made a face, wanting to protest, but the truth was that yeah, Dean was getting to an age where he should actually live his life, not just survive it.
“See you on the other side.” Dean smiled at that and his head dropped forward, Sam catching him and hugging him, as if that would miraculously bring him back.
With surprisingly little grief, the pair managed to check Dean out of the hospital, and were on the road quickly.
“Well, I don’t want to.”
“Help him! Please!” A stretcher was brought out and Sam lay Dean on it, EMTs did what they could to keep the blood inside of the man’s body, taking him into the ambulance and making their exit.
“Come on, no chick-flick moments. You get all sappy and it just ruins it,” Dean teased. “I need you to do something for me, okay? I need you to tell me it’s okay.”
. The angel made for the door before turning around. “Sam,” he said.
Baby’s engine revved as they drove out of the parking lot and onto the road, Dean noticing every small glance Sam sent his way but electing to ignore them for now.
“He’s alive, and he’s stable. Fortunately, his major organs were missed, though he suffered from a lot of internal bleeding. We’ll reassess once he wakes up but he should make a full recovery, given time.”
“Two lives for the price of seven. Hardly seems fair, but it’ll have to do,” another Styne exclaimed, shoving Sam out of the way of Dean, who had just gotten to his feet.
“Listen up. You… you get gone, alright? Before the cops show up.” Sam shook his head, opening his mouth to protest. Dean immediately shut him down. “You do that. I was supposed to go out like this, right? At the edge of a blade or the barrel of a gun, blaze o’ glory style. You… you’re gonna live a good life with Eileen. You’re gonna raise a kid, just like I raised you. And
Sorry for delay, I was too busy sobbing trying to write it. I hope you guys enjoy the emotional trauma I got from writing this, because I sure did! /s
Sirens drew closer. Sam had his jacket pressed against Dean’s side, stopping the bleeding as much as he could. When he saw lights outside, he lifted his brother and carried him outside, which took a lot of strength, but he did it.
As if fated, Dean stirred slightly, gaining Sam’s attention that had previously been on nothing except staring out the window.
Castiel hesitantly put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Sam wondered why the action was so light, so resistant. Unbeknownst to him, it was the last place he’d touched the hunter before he died, not knowing whether his feelings—of which were new, despite having been burning for over a decade—were one-sided or not.
“In all honesty? I was terrified when it happened, and I’m still a little scared. I’ll get over it. Let’s just enjoy what we’ve got, okay?” He smiled somewhat reassuringly, and Eileen dropped the subject for the moment.
“Yes, you can.”
“You truly are hilarious. It’s a shame I will kill you though, but you slaughtered my people. I can’t stand for that.”
“Hey buddy!” he exclaimed endearingly. “Good morning.” He buried his fingers in the long, wiry fur of his current source of happiness; Miracle, a stray dog he fell in love with immediately.
“If you say so.” The trunk opened with a slight squeak, not for lack of care though, and Dean lifted the fake bottom up. “Ohh, awesome.” A box of shurikens (or, as they’re popularly known as: ninja stars) lay there, begging to be used.
Dean finished his breakfast quickly, giving his leftovers to Miracle discreetly (or so he thought) under the table. Sam used the time to talk and push away his feelings of worry, though they kept forcing their way up, so he ended up ignoring them instead of getting rid of them. He would deal with it later.
Sam thought, nodding and moving on.
“When Dean wakes up, give him this.” A small envelope was placed on the bedside table.
Coffee was at the top of Dean’s priority list, so he sleepily made his way to the kitchen, Miracle instinctively following behind.
“Fellas, please, let’s just talk this out, huh? Like, uh- like therapy!” Dean dodged a punch and stabbed his opponent, seemingly doing no damage. “Motherf—” he was cut short when a sharp pain jabbed his side, searing straight through. Dean being Dean, however, continued fighting; hopped up on adrenaline.
“Yeah.” There was reluctance in his tone. “Yeah, I’m focusing.”
“You are completely out of my brother’s league,” he commented, using a phrase he’d said to Sam’s first love, many years ago. A smile graced Eileen’s face and she scoffed affectionately.
“Because Dad said—”
“You’ve seen Cas?! Where is he? Is he okay?”
Neither man actually knew what they were getting into, as they’d severely underestimated the firepower of their foes.
“There’s gotta be a reason they’re here, right? I mean, they’ve always been driven by something, all the way from the 1800s to now. There’s a motive.” Dean didn’t respond, reading his writing with a serious look on his face.
“Cas,” he began his prayer to the angel. “I know that we’ve had a hell of a lot of fights, and I know I keep pushing you away. I just- I’ve always been too scared to say it. Scared that if I say it, you’ll be gone, or that my freakin’ dad’ll raise from the dead just to yell at me about it. Again.” He ran his free hand over the back of his head, muttering a few choice words aimed at himself and his father, trying to build up his confidence. “I love you too, Cas. Everything in me is telling me not to, that it’s wrong, but I do. Wherever you are, I hope you can hear this. I hope you’ll come back.”
“Good. I love you,” he replied, taking his bag and waiting for Dean outside.
“Seems to be. There’s no reason it wouldn’t be. I’m not looking a gift horse in the mouth, y’know?” He set his bag down on the table, turning around to continue speaking. “If he says he’s okay, then he is.”
“Thank you.”
“No idea. It’s from Cas.”
of all people.
Dean sat on the edge of his bed, Miracle’s head on his lap. Something inside him, in his heart, just didn’t feel right. An unfilled space, waiting for something to fit into it.
He paused his music and looked out at the view; a lake, dotted with lilies and wildlife, a public trail where families took their morning strolls, a coffee truck that had only just opened for the day. Fresh air filled his lungs and he smiled, appreciative of the second chance he was given when Jack brought his lover back, along with the rest of the world.
He thought, keeping the question unspoken.
“If I need a break? You’re acting like I’m half-dead, Sam. Got a long way to go till then.” Sam let himself smile, just a little, at that.
“I promise,” Eileen signed back and planted a kiss on his cheek. “I’ll still be here when you get back. It’s less than a day, nothing’s getting me. Not unless it’s old age.” Sam smiled softly, nodding.
“You’re- are you crying?” Sam asked.
“See, you’re glad I dragged your ass here,” Dean commented, sitting beside Sam with a box containing six slices of pie. Sam didn’t say anything in response, seeing the look Dean shot at him, and elected not to say anything.
“It’s him—” Sam called before getting pinned to the wall. “Dean, I saw him yesterday!” Dean was struggling against his grip, and Sam didn’t have enough room to move himself.
“Shut up,” Dean teased, continuing. “You’ve always been so smart. Hell, you got into Stanford, man.
He took a vinyl from his collection—Van Morrison’s
(See the end of the chapter for
“You gonna sit there or help me get outta here?” Dean was already taking various pieces of equipment off of himself, lucky that his angel had healed him so he could actually do so.
He took his ninja stars and threw two of them, slicing the necks of his enemies.
“Bullet to the brain, you said that keeps ‘em down, so we’ll do that. Quick and easy.”
It was horrific. A couple, their eyes stolen, bodies sliced open without a bother to be stitched up again. Only time they’d seen something like this was…
“What? No, I’m not crying. You’re crying.” He looked up at Sam, pride in his eyes from his own comment, before striding towards the event.
“Really, Dean?
after telling us Cas was in Heaven. Something doesn’t sit right with me, and I don’t know what.”
“You’re back!” Eileen signed—and spoke, for Dean’s sake—happily, as she’d followed Miracle into the entryway. She hugged Dean, which he thought was strange, given they were only out on a hunt.
Dean doesn’t respond, as he hadn’t heard Sam’s question.
“Of course I know! These sons of bitches killed Charlie, so yeah, I freakin’ know!” Dean leafed through his own journal—he’d made a habit of it after he got back from Purgatory, to map what he knew about the things he hunted.
Dean is still here, though. It’s the only thing that matters, now.
“I didn’t say that.”
They’re in Vegas, for Christ’s sake! It’s time to live a little.
-_-_-_-_-_-
-_-_-_-_-_-_-
It’s hard to focus on him, though, when sensations assault Dean from everywhere. Cas keeps sinking lower and lower like it’s never going to stop, and Dean’s almost seizing with electric bliss. A shiver runs through him, at the same time as Cas lets out a half moan. His thighs are shaking with restraint. He’s almost all the way there.
That’s when Dean starts feeling uncomfortable. Lucky for him, Cas decides to talk before he can make a fool of himself. “If this is what I get when I buy a TV,” he says, slowly, a smug smile tugging at his lips, “I don’t even want to imagine what you’ll do when I buy myself a car.”
“No! Mom, Christ’s sake…”
“O—okay. Alright, huh…” Dean stammers as he looks for the little bundle again.
“What do you think?” Cas tries to be seductive, which only makes Dean laugh harder. It doesn’t stop Cas though.
He just has to figure out how to do that.
Dean can’t help it, he makes a face. She turns crimson red.
“I don’t.”
“What would my boyfriend say,” Cas intones in Dean’s ear, and Dean shivers. “If I said I wanted to fuck him?”
Dean smiles. He nods.
“Cas! Come on!”
By the time Castiel abandons his studies three years after he started, they’ve stopped counting how many they killed. Castiel thinks it’s better if they don’t. It’s better if they don’t keep souvenirs, either. So, no photos of the both of them in places they’ve ‘visited’. No trophy from their kills. Only pay with cash. Take the money at the college’s ATM before they go. Castiel pays attention to those sort of things. They have to if they don’t want to get caught.
He’s a bit angry, of course he is. He hasn’t been able to sit and do some proper work ever since this morning, because the Doc keeps barking his name every five seconds and giving him more and more work as the day goes on.
“Well,” Dean tries to shrug, “I didn’t say I was interested.”
“We’re having sex in order to advance our scientific study,” Cas answers, dropping a kiss on the skin near Dean’s cockhead, “don’t you think we ought to talk about it?”
, together. We kiss on the mouth, sleep in the same bed and occasionally we fu—“
He’s eager to cut his conversation short, because this is all very awkward.
Cas nods, and looks down at his hands.
First, because Amelia never did anything wrong, quite the opposite. She’s the perfect wife, in all aspects. She would certainly be a perfect mother. But not with Castiel. Never with Castiel. She deserves more than what he can give. What he’s willing to give.
That said, I'm trying to bang out the next chapter as quick as I can to make up for the months I missed. Thank you all for your patience, and thanks to the people who came to check on me in the comments, you're the best <3
“You promised you’d tell me what my mother said to you,” Cas says.
Dean sighs. He pushes away from his desk, and enters Novak’s office. “Doc?”
Dean flips the bird at his back. He won’t cave. Even if Cas keeps sending suggestive texts and freakin’ dick pics. Even if Dean keeps having weird dreams about Cas, and sex, and… ugh! He won’t. And that’s the end of it.
“What did she tell you?”
“Well, Jack was himself through the whole thing. You said he made Heaven… uh, great again,” Sam says in a grimace, and Dean huffs a laugh. “And that Bobby said Cas helped, so… you think maybe Jack did the same thing in reality?”
He winks, and Dean laughs in the background.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-
“Thank God,” he breathes when he’s done, whole body collapsing into the mattress.
“I expect you to stay until I hire a replacement for you,” he calls after her, not looking up from his work.
It’ll be okay. He’ll be okay. He has the whole weekend to sleep it off and forget about it.
“You’ll talk to him?”
“Seriously,” Dean groans.
He shuffles out of his room, wrapped up in the fluffy, grey bathrobe he stole from the hotel room they stayed at with Cas. He’s warm, he’s rested, and he’s about to make some pancakes, and the only thing that comes to mind is that everything’s too perfect to last.
“Will you just stop arguing for once? Just this once!”
“Okay,” he just says, while Cas is scribbling all this down. “And with people?”
“We’re not against anyone,” Cas sighs. “We just want to go. What if we win?”
“I don’t want to talk about this,” Castiel snaps in a whisper, miffed. “It’s none of your concern.”
But they did it, they had sex without blockers, and it was sweat and messy and desperate and a whole host of other things Dean’s not ready to voice, even in his head.
Cas wasn’t expecting this. His mouth opens and closes several times as he stares at Sam, resolutely avoiding Dean’s eyes, and it would almost be comical if it didn’t feel as important as it does to Dean. His heart is suddenly pumping against his chest, and it fucking hurts, almost like it did when Billy was trying to kill him.
“Am I boring you, Mister Winchester?”
“Well,” Amelia sits as well, busying herself with cutting two perfect pieces of cake. “Mine was good, too.”
“Well… could you maybe check his agenda? Please?”
Cas is silent, blessedly, for a long time. Nothing shows on his face, apart from the intensity that always seep out of his every pore when he’s thinking real hard about something.
“Cas!!”
It’s just as good the second time, Dean muses as his mouth moves against Cas’s, head tilting on the side for a better angle. He hopes that all the other times will be just as good as this one.
“You wanna,” Dean croaks, and clears his throat, “you wanna stay for dinner?”
“No. No, it’s just…” He blinks. He remembers he’s standing naked in the woods. Anybody could see. “We should go back home.”
“Unfortunately, no,” Castiel says. “And paying you for our sessions would amount to prostitution. I don’t think you’d be amenable to that, even if it wasn’t illegal.”
She’s annoying. Loud. Sometimes rude. But even he has to admit, if she’s here, that means she’s good. She has to be. And if they have to work together for several years… he should make an effort. A small one, at least.
And, yeah, okay, Dean’s not going to say anything else, and he’s not going to start fidgeting like a child, but impatience is taking over as he licks his lips, getting ready to hear it all. Finally, he’s going to
