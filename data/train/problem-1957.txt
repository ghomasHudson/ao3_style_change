‘Oho, I am well aware of that love, don’t let me hold you back. All I ask is that you keep the bedside violin playing to a minimum.’
Aaand that’s quite enough thinking on that topic. So. The girls at work don’t know all that. What they
Sherlock’s brow scrunched with momentary confusion. ‘Yes.’ He blinked twice, then appeared to make a sudden realisation, ‘Of course. I love you too. Obviously.’
‘Bed, Watson!’
Or she… or she what?
Sherlock opened his eyes and what he saw nearly made him come then and there. John looked him in the eyes as he moved still slow, still so agonizingly slow towards Sherlock's cock to lick a line from base to tip. Sherlock cursed and his head dropped against the matress, afraid that if he kept looking at John he would come too fast, and this would be over too soon. John kept up with the tentative licks until he spontaneously swallowed Sherlock down to his base before coming back up to suck at just his head, bringing Sherlock very, very close to the edge.
"Okay. Having a wank, not being kidnapped or murdered. So sorry. Pretend I wasnt here." He was nearly out the door when Sherlock stopped him.
After more silence, more of what he knew was John trying to figure out what was going on, Sherlock resigned, a quiet sob nearly escaping as told John to quietly foget it. He quickly wrapped his sheet around himself, moving gingerly as to not touch himslef accidentally, and stepped toward the door to head to the bathroom. It hadn't worked earlier today but maybe being as hard as he was, a shower would give him some relief.
John decided to be brave and reached down to touch Sherlock as well. As his hand met velvety smooth skin, Sherlock let out a high keen and captured John's lips in a hot kiss that quickly turned messy and intense.
John watched his hand move over his best friends cock and couldn't help but admire how nice it looked. He had thought often about how it would look but now with his own hand wrapped around it he was shocked to find how much he liked it. Liked the thought of his best friend fucking his fist, begging to get off. He continued to watch, getting hard himself. Luckily Sherlock was too occupied to notice.
"Mmm. Surprised it took you so long to notice, love. I have to pull myself off every time I see you in those tight trousers you wear to work. Arse looks so good in them. And now that I know what it looks like out of them, I never want to see you in them again." He nips at John's chest to emphasize his point causing the man below him to growl and dive down for a very hot kiss.
Sherlock moaned particularly loud at one upturn of John's wrist and John watched Sherlock's cock, facinated as a drop of pearly white precome appeared. Before he realized what he was doing John leaned forward and licked the drop away. They both stilled. John slowly drew back, removing his hand from sherlock to pinch the bridge of his nose while cursing to himself. He started to apologize but Sherlock cut him off.
Just as he was about to knock the door was yanked open to reveal Sherlock, dressed slightly more modestly in those silk pajamas he'd been in earlier. John was once again left speechless and gawking at the gorgeous man. Sherlock just chuckled again and held the door open for John to stumble through. Not two seconds after John had crossed the threshold had he been pinned to the now closed door behind him. Their faces were inches away, Sherlocks lips just barely touching his own. Then he spoke.
They struggled a bit to touch one another while they kissed as their hands were now caught between their bodies. Sherlock quickly remedied the situation by shuffling back a bit and flipping John onto his stomach. John assumed the position; face down, arse up, and prepared himself for what was to come.
"Oh, John. Sherlock's ruining my nice walls! We've just patched them from last time. He's found that blasted gun you thought you hid properly. He must have torn the whole flat apart trying to find it. You know how he needs to shoot things when he's frustrated. Oh John, would you please go up there and sort him out? The boy is causing more damage than your rent is worth!" With that final utterance she straightened her blouse and bustled  past John hurriedly, the door knocking closed loudly behind her. Another sigh escaped him as he hobbled ip the stairs tiredly.
He brought himself back to Sherlock and situated them so that John sat on the bed, on his knees in front of Sherlock, who still lay down, his knees drawn up with both of his feet planted on the bed, legs pressed together, his erection trapped between them. Sherlock panted as he waited for John to continue.
"Oi. What's the problem today then? Bored? Probably, been on a case stalemate for a bit havent we? But you've only just now started shooting the wall so either you've finally snapped or its something else."
Sherlock blushed further and very uncharacteristicly stumbled over his words. His face twisted in pain a bit before he started.
John almost did, but something didn't feel right. Maybe he'd had a nightmare. He cleared his throat a bit and tried again.
John happily slotted himself against Sherlock's back, wrapping an arm around Sherlock's slim middle and pulling him closer. Both men fell asleep completely at peace and completely in love with each other, now that thed both admitted it they'd never take each other's company for granted again.
Sherlock latched onto John's lower lip and sucked it into his own mouth lavishing it with his tongue before pulling away.
_____________________________________
John rolled his eyes and went to put on the kettle mumbling about Sherlock being a insufferable git. But no matter how annoyed John was with the cranky man he still brought him tea. Whether he drank it or not. He sipped his own tea and watched the lanky man acrossed from him, trying to guess just what was frustrating him.
All he wanted was a hot shower and some time to laze about before bed. He headed for his bathroom, shucking off his clothes as he went. He took his time in the shower, relaxing a bit and washing off the rough day. He emerged from the steamy room clad in only flannel pajama bottoms and went straight for a glass of whiskey. He strolled out to his tiny balcony to take in the coolness of the evening and sip at his drink. Not at all to see if his gorgeous neighbor was out as well. Not at all.
"Sher-! Ah Fucking-- Christ!"
"When I propositioned you I didn't think you'd be so demanding in bed. But I suppose I should have, Capitan. No matter, I think I quite like it~" he growled against Johns ass and added a quick nip to the cheek before continuing his work. He teased at John until his legs were shaking uncontrollably, seconds away from coming. Then he held off for a few seconds, kneading and kissing John's toned backside until John settled again. And then he started again. Hed brought John close to climax three times before John grew tired of the teasing. The detective was about to taste some of his own medicine.
"Yes, thats exactly right. Now what do you think would cause me to become so aroused just after you left? Hmm?" Sherlock began to smirk, knowing very well that he was being smug. John was silent until he suddenly let out a chuckle.
"Jawn if you dont pull off now I'm going to come in your mouth."
He gave John a minute to process everything. John huffed out a breath, a sort of laugh before speaking himself.
Sherlock said it as loud and as clear as he could manage in his state, trying not to moan as he talked. John shuddered at his words. He knew John heard him, made sure by locking eyes with the ex-soldier, but John made no move to pull away. In fact, John sped up his movements and lapped at his length with much more fervor. Sherlock was alight with pleasure, suprised that he had enough sense in him to watch John suck him off.
"If you're truly curious, there are many nerve endings in the anus that when stimulated can induce great pleasure- honestly John, I thought you were a doctor. You should know basic anatomy."
"What do you-What can you do if... if you cant. You know? If you cant.. finish? Ive been trying but I can't seem— I-I cant—I cant get off."
As he spoke, Sherlock looked john in the eye once more, trying to convey his sincerity. He finished and all was quiet for a moment. Then John nodded slowly and instructed Sherlock to lie back on his bed. He did as he was told and John awkwardly moved closer. He heard john take in another breath, holding it as he moved a hand under Sherlocks sheet, hesitating before bringing his hand down further to lightly grasp Sherlock's length he jerked his wrist softly. Sherlock gasped and john glanced at Sherlock's face, watching for signs of pain.
"You sure? You sound strange.. you arent hurt or anything are you?" His own question made his heart thrum with slight panic. He pushed open Sherlock's door and flicked on his light before Sherlock could begin his protests. John looked Sherlock over for damage but did not see anything that would cause him pain. When his eyes landed on Sherlock's sheet clad lap he saw the tent and realised with a rather audible "oh" what was wrong with him. They finally locked eyes. Sherlock's forehead glistened in a sheen of sweat, his face was flushed in obvious embarrassment but he couldnt seem to look away from John.
"Alright. Whats wrong?"
Sherlock was not oblivious. He was constantly aware if his next door neighbors strangely welcomed gazing. He knew he was attractive to some degree and often used his so called beauty to his advantage during cases. People had always fawned over him and tried to win his favor through cat calls and poorly delivered pick up lines but none of them ever interested him. But this man, this one interested him immensely.
Sherlock ducked his head to watch his hand move on John's cock, the head dribbling precome which look absolutely mouth watering. Sherlock couldn't resist shimmying down the bed to take John directly into his mouth, swallowing around him causing John to cry out his name as he came sharply against the detective's tongue. Sherlock savored the complex flavor of John Watson while the doctor huffed out breaths as he came down.
Sherlocks tongue wrapped around John's immediately and both groaned at the intensity of the delayed act. John held onto Sherlock for dear life as the kiss and heat consumed him. They were too lost in each other, too lost in the kiss, that neither realized they were naked until Sherlock's length brushed lightly against John's hip. They broke from the kiss, heaving for breath, and took each other in.
"Yes Sherlock. Oh god yes."
"Alright?" He asked worried he had hurt Sherlock. Sherlock nodded shakily and John continued to carefully pull off his best friend. As he grew more confident in his ministrations John added more pressure to his strokes, drawing small moans from the man below him. When John swipped his thumb over Sherlocks slit, Sherlock yelped and then moaned louder, indicating that John was doing well.
Sherlock hummed in agreement and continued to pummel John with his tongue.
Sherlock was breathtaking. Looking like a fallen angel above him, his halo of dark, beautiful curls fell over his eyes, partially blocking them from view. Sherlock stared down at John as he passed a hand down John's chest slowly coming to rest just above his pubic bone, conveying his want while also asking consent to touch him. John felt his stomach flutter at the thought and nodded his head clearly, grabbing Sherlock's hand placing it squarely onto his hard and already leaking cock. Sherlock wrapped his fingers around him immediately and John huffed out a whine at the intant pleasure.
‘Right, er, thanks for telling me, then. So, what now? Does this mean you’re finally having that dinner with Irene?’
when she doesn’t cook, but that’s a different story). She’s bony, but not enough that you’d forget she’s a lady. Bit of a bum, actually. Just a bit. I mean, it’s not like I’d normally go for a guy with her figure… if you… translated her figure into guys. I mean, she’s sort of tall and lean and things, I’ve always been for your solid sorts of blokes. Not that she didn’t look… depressingly appealing in some of her numerous case related cross-dressing moments.
‘Or eyeballs in my mug, in an ideal world.’
To my surprise and delight, I discovered being the subject of Sherlock’s real life scrutiny had almost the opposite effect. Perhaps because her real life scrutiny was carried out with her fingers and – lord in heaven – mouth.
With another sudden movement, her hand was on my face, gripping my jaw, her fingers digging a bit into my cheeks.   She continued to look at me, eyes flicking back and forth with rapid precision, as though gauging every manifestation of my reaction, from ears to chin. Which, to be honest, she was probably doing. She turned my head slightly from side to side, still staring, really, staring like she’d never seen me before, like she’d never got a chance to really look. Perhaps she hadn’t. ‘Here you are,’ she muttered again.
Your hesitance suggests you expected to find me in the sitting room, although any measure of consideration would have told you that the sofa is unsuitable for one in my state of health. I have been out of hospital for less than a week, and my predilection for those well-worn cushions does not counterbalance their inability to support the spine and rib-cage of one recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest.
Sometimes it felt like he’d never left. All that time in between the stories – the ones he’d written, the ones they shared – that time started to blend together after all the years, like it wasn’t important. He thought of Sherlock’s method of deleting all the bits that didn’t pertain to cases, all the unimportant, uninteresting bits.
‘Right. Coat.’ Off you trot. I hear your coat and shoes drop by the door (muttering with the shoes as you negotiate around your stomach), then the splash of water in the kettle (four years on, and the kitchen water pressure still surprises you, oh, Joan).
‘Yeah?’
I nod.
Sherlock hesitated.
‘I’ll make it.’ Sherlock said, with a tight smile.
It was a comforting thing, the hum of bees, John’s grip flexing and unflexing on the arm of the chair, or his cane – not the psychosomatic limp anymore, but years and years of running down streets, and up stairs, and falling down stairs, and chasing after children, and criminals, and primarily Sherlock, took its toll on your old joints after a while. He was a doctor, he should know.
‘Hey, I missed you too. I missed you… all the time. Even when I should have probably been worrying about… other things. Always do,’ I said. And suddenly there they were. There were words in my mouth now, three of them, wondering if it was time to come out. Ok, I’d already said them, we’d all said them, but that was back then we were passing them off as their lighter platonic version.
‘You cosy there?’
‘You’re not gay.’
If she’s pretending, I don’t blame her. I wouldn’t want to confront it either.
‘Well, she probably does. I would. I mean, if I were her….Right, er. So, bed?’
I tried to look as encouraging as I could with my face partially squashed in her grip. I was pretty sure I looked a bit like a hamster at the moment, but nevermind that.
‘The black ones will do. And you’ll be fine,’ Sherlock flashed me a rare-ish smile.
A few days later, I closed my online dating profile. I couldn’t face it. I didn’t want to. Maybe it was the situation with Martin, on top of everything else, but I couldn’t picture myself with anybody else. I couldn’t picture myself with anybody, not there anyway. Flicking through the profiles of the various eligibles had just made me cringe inwardly. Picturing myself with any of them made me feel a bit ill. Disgusted. What right did they have to my life? Who the hell could possibly fit into it? I wasn’t even sure I wanted to share my life with someone else. I dreaded the very process of getting to know someone new, the years it took before knowing someone well. I felt too bloody old to be starting fresh, and I couldn’t face it. It was worse now that we’d achieved some local celebrity, what with the blog and everything. I couldn’t help but remember Ella’s early note of me having ‘trust issues’. Nothing like having a mad assassin spouse to make you particularly jumpy about meeting strangers. That, and a constant insight into the criminal underbelly (and overbelly) of the world. I found myself almost wishing I
“No,” John said firmly.
Sherlock pulled John’s gun off of him, and directed two shots into the creature. Despite taking off nearly half of its head, the monster didn’t slow. Sherlock desperately tried to pry at its clenched hands. Finally, he was able to pull its hands off just enough to give John some air. John nodded to his right, and Sherlock noticed a thin metal pole lying on the ground. He lunged for it, and immediately returned to John.
“Something irrelevant,” he replied, shaking his head. “Not something you need to know now.” Out of habit John wandered towards the window and looked out, glancing up and down the street. A war was building, and there was not even so much as a whisper to be heard on the deserted street. “I'm not sure where to start,” he said quietly, speaking towards the glass.
John felt the implication in the increased beating of Sherlock’s heart long before he consciously recognized what Sebastian had said. That was the mistake he and Sherlock had been waiting for.
He rummaged in the stack of papers and handed a couple of newspapers to John. Circled on the inside pages of both were news articles about murders that had taken place in the city - some with what were called “bite marks,” others that were bloodless.
“Leave me alone. I'm going to my mind tent.”
John shook his head. “Too risky. Just try to keep them posted around the city at night, that’s the best we can expect.”
“There's going to be a murder tonight? How do you know?” Lestrade stood quickly, mouth agape as he stood up and walked towards John. Sherlock moved around the table, also coming close to the doctor, who took a step backwards as he lowered the crossbow.
“You have no idea,” Sebastian said with disdain.
“In a sense,” John answered, glancing up at Sherlock. “Sherlock will text you coordinates, you be sure to pass them along if anyone needs to find us.”
The first time John thought he was going to die, when he was shot, his life didn’t pass before his eyes. He thought of his mum. Nothing important, no great moments, just his mum. The way she would kiss him goodnight before she left in the evening, and how the smell of her perfume would linger in the room for a few minutes afterwards, like she was there when she wasn't. The lunches she would make him for school when he was a kid. The summer she took him fishing with jelly worms, because he couldn't bear to hurt any real ones. That was the summer she told him he should become a doctor. She said he was happiest when he was helping people, and the Van Helsings
“Hey,” John said, putting down the pen he was holding.
“Well,” Sherlock said, shrugging, not particularly invested in disagreeing with John. “You just happen to surprise me.”
“Keeping out of the public eye,” John answered. “It wasn't pleasant for me either, you know. Not being able to talk to any of you. Though I was rather enjoying being classified as dead.”
Molly looked at John, who was glancing around the room, wondering if anything else was going to jump out at them. “A vampire?”
Lestrade tilted his head, his expression one of confusion. "It's not a full moon tonight. Or a new moon, for that matter."
Molly appeared to be having a similar problem, offering a tepid, “Fine, Edinburgh?”
John ran a hand over the back of the chair he was standing beside, looking at the frayed threads as his jaw moved. “Thomas is – was – someone I knew years ago. I thought he'd died a few years ago, the last time I was in Romania, tracking a group of vampires who had killed most of a small village. I was wrong. I think the feeling was mutual, actually,” John said, a smile at the edge of his mouth disappearing as soon as it was formed.
“Sweetheart?” John called in the direction of the opposite building’s roof, walking towards the edge of his own. She put up a hand to stop him.
John, sitting up properly, stretched an arm out and looked around for the nearest cup of cold tea. Not finding one, he stood and walked towards Sherlock, looking down at the photographs, which had been arranged in a order he was sure only the detective could understand. He pulled a picture from the most recent murder towards himself.
John felt propelled more by instinct than anything else, aware that he had a job to do but still mentally far away. He found as he walked across the courtyard to the armory that he was not attracting a great deal of attention, in spite of the fact that he was fairly recognizable, and any vampire going through the effort of attacking his military installation would know who he was. Nevertheless, only a few of the younger, wilder enemy vampires made any attempt to attack him, and even then they were quickly intercepted by one of John’s soldiers. The battle was truly in full-swing, with the soldiers - now all present and accounted for - spread out in a semi-circle, shooters taking a step forward after every round they shot. Others, armed with stakes, paced between the sharpshooters and waited for a rogue vampire to branch out and try a solo attack.
In the distance, something exploded, and small pieces of metal rained down on him, catching in his hair and scalding his hands as he attempted to protect his face. He had to move, but found himself paralyzed by the sting of another wound, a gash in his side from one of the fragments of glass that had been blown out in the earlier explosion. Unable to move, to think, he could see his vision blur and his thoughts slow, just as a man crouched in front of him. The man, illuminated by the red and gold lights of the flames that flickered in front of him, smiled at John, and was highlighted for a moment by the bright light of another explosion. Snarling, almost inhuman, he met the army doctor's eyes with his own bright blue ones and spoke. “
“I'm sure. What else do we have to do today?”
Greg looked at him. “She was just holding on, though there wasn't much to hold on to. They found her about ten minutes from your place. Looked just like the others; blood everywhere... It was like something had tried to rip her throat out. She couldn't even say what the murderer looked like. Couldn't gesture. The medics on site got her sedated fairly quickly, but seeing the absolute panic in her eyes before they did...” Lestrade shook his head and looked away. “It's one of those nights no man wants to do this job.”
“Geoff,” Sherlock said, glancing at Lestrade before resuming his examination of the laptop, waving distractedly at the living room.
“Someone who has more sway than I do. If it helps at all, it wasn't my choice,” he said, putting his cup down. Before he had finished speaking, Sherlock was halfway out of the door.
Figures shifted in the dark and John realized that while he was focusing on Harker more vampires had entered the room - these ones clearly older, seemingly able to become ether and drift within the shadows. He swallowed heavily, and tried to focus; he knew Old Ones had to be involved somehow, but to see them in person was still a shock to the system.
“My hands are tied, I'm afraid. If you would come to my office, the files could be in your hands by,” he looked at his watch, “Nine thirty, at the very latest.”
“That's your warning. You get one,” John shouted to the blackness before him. A drop of dark blood fell to the pavement from the tip of one of his knives. “Leave now and I will end this peacefully.”
Mycroft walked towards the table and glanced down at the papers Sherlock had stacked in some sort of order. The word vampire didn't appear anywhere – he wasn't surprised. As the other men in the room quietly read through case notes, Mycroft paused and allowed his mind to focus. Having fed on John so recently, he felt as though every part of his body had been retuned, with every nerve on fire, and his skin electrified. As the outer edges of his thoughts went silent, he could see the world around him with infinitely more detail than he ever could in life. He could hear the softly beating hearts of the detectives – Greg's slow, Sherlock's faster – and see the blood pass under the thinner skin of their wrists and necks. The hunger was still there, and he couldn't imagine it would ever disappear completely, but the edge was gone, and he no longer felt like a threat to the humans before him. Overhead, he could sense another person, who gave off an entirely different scent and life force. Not unpleasant, exactly, but not as rich and vibrant as Greg or Sherlock's. It was completely unlike theirs. When he payed close enough attention, he could hear John's breathing. He heard the sound of metal on metal – a safe? - and the movement of fabric. Seconds later, he heard quick movement, and then the sound of feet hitting steps. All eyes turned towards the door frame as John, out of breath, appeared behind Mycroft, looking down at the crossbow he was fiddling with. “Tonight. The next murder is going to be tonight, south side of the Thames somewhere.” He looked up and was met with the wide eyes of Lestrade and an expressionless Sherlock, whose head had snapped up the second his flatmate's foot hit the last step of the stairs. “Shit,” he murmured.
Positive that he was in a race against time, John started a slow jog to the end of the street, then broke out into a run as he turned the corner, directing himself as best as he could towards 221B until he found an empty cab. As he exited at the end of the road and started running towards the flat again, he stopped involuntarily a few steps from the door.
Mycroft didn’t dare run, or move at all. He was not yet sure of his ability to maintain control over his body.
the voice at the back of his head demanded. Shaking the thought away, he remembered that he had to give Sherlock some kind of explanation.
“I'm going to explain this, you know,” he said quietly.
“Any chance you could grab a couple of samples of this dirt? We could see if we can get a more accurate -”
“You’re in charge, though?” Lestrade asked, trying to reassure himself that he did not need to panic completely quite yet.
“Oh, and here Mycroft was telling me you weren’t any fun,” Moriarty said, clapping his hands together. “Not as fun as Sherlock, anyways.” He turned to face him as he spoke his name. “Did you miss your brother,  I wonder?”
“Great,” Sherlock said, monotone. “Where is he?”
“One hundred and nine in May,” the man answered with a smile, pushing a lock of dark hair off his forehead.
“The Families are not here,” Caroline murmured, voice steady and not betraying the very deep worry that everyone else in the room seemed to feel.
“You don't remember me?” Jane asked.
“I kind of preferred the garden tool theory, to be honest.”
The vampire lurched forward once more, only to be pulled back. Sherlock pulled out a knife from his pocket just in case the chains failed.
“Great,” John replied, leaning over and turning off his light. In short order, Sherlock stopped reading through his notes and put on his own pair of pajamas, and slipped into his bed opposite John’s. The headlights of passing cars shone through the windows, and for a time the two men were left with their thoughts.
Men and women, of various ages and ethnicities, rose from the ground, disoriented and fanged. On balance, the turn seemed to be successful - these were not the vampires that had attacked Sherlock and John in alleyways and in the hospital; they still seemed to have their wits about them, could still behave like they did when they were human.
Sherlock shifted forward and rested his elbows on the table in front of him. “Interesting.”
For a moment, it felt as though John and Sherlock were alone in the vault, the chaos around them a blur. With his last vestige of strength, Sherlock pushed John’s hand away and gazed at him quietly, thoughtfully. Through a voice choked by blood, Sherlock rested a hand on John’s neck, and murmured, “it’s fine.”
known for producing good doctors.
Feeling a bit light-headed, John let out a chuckle, raising a free hand and resting it on Mycroft's elbow. “Don't say I didn't warn you.”
Sherlock looked at him a moment more and then stood, followed soon after by John. 	“Lestrade, have an autopsy performed as soon as possible. I'm sure you have already realized that this case will take priority over all others you have on at the moment.”
“Someone's planning ahead,”John said, and walked back towards the body, turning it over hesitantly, trying not to get any more of the blood on him. Sherlock walked around to the other side and knelt down. “Sending a vampire to wait for us at the morgue,”he said, “That seems bad.”
Mycroft returned to the group. “There,” he said, and gestured with an open hand to two dark cars coming around the nearest corner. Their windows tinted, John was immediately grateful that he wouldn't have to slouch in his seat to hide his torn and blood stained clothing.
“You know I can't do that,” John answered, his eyes scanning the room briefly. No windows. “Because forgetting this won't keep anyone else from dying.”
John laughed bitterly and took a sip of water. “And there's a lot I don't plan to tell you, too. You realize she lived, don't you? The woman you murdered? She survived long enough to relive the terror of you slowly draining away her life for god knows how many hours before she passed away.”
The door, room, and its inhabitant seethed silently in his direction.
Sherlock narrowed her eyes, glanced around the room again, then manoevered herself to her chair.
‘But you always said…’
As evening is subsumed by night, I realise I don’t seem to know anything of value at all.
‘Yes well, I hardly need remind you that I am not most people. You were the one bent on inserting a romantic narrative into that case, which I still cannot comprehend. At best, there were elements of base attraction, particularly on her part. But that’s the shallowest chemical reaction, a trick of the body. Even in my
, just the numb slip from nauseating sleepless nights into meaningless days, stretching into eternity.
Sherlock gave the slightest of disdainful snorts.
Sherlock waited.
Sherlock slid a hand up to cover mine where it was petting her hair. ‘Joan, you know I… that I…’ she sucked on my skin. Her fingers dug into mine. I whimpered.
Once or twice, Ella had pushed me. It was in the aftermath of Sherlock’s suicide. Fake suicide, I mean. I’d been devastated, can still barely think about it. Couldn’t say- Just couldn’t say things. Ella’d asked about my feelings towards Sherlock. She asked lots of things, just trying to help me open up, I guess. To let go. But I hadn’t- couldn’t think of it, not even then. I couldn’t think of our friendship as something else, even if it was so obviously much more than any friendship I'd ever had. But to think of what it
‘Can I- can I- will you let me- What do you want? Do you want me to? Anything you want – I mean, I have no idea what I’m doing, but…’
‘I’m not-’
I shivered.
Four days, 5 hours and 17 minutes later, amid my tube ride home, it occurred to me that I might very well remain a spectacular coward for the rest of my days.
‘Yes, but that’s besides the point. You’re getting restless, it’s obvious. You’ve been doing more and more of that thing where you pretend to read, or stare off so it looks like you’re thinking normally, but you’re actually thinking about sex or something in that general subject area.’
‘Can I see your scar?’
I’m beginning to suspect that I am, indeed, getting old, because I do not remember the prospect of dating eliciting so much dread. I mean, maybe it’s just anticipation. A very heavy, wearying sort of anticipation that makes me wish the whole ordeal was done with. And I haven’t even attempted to meet anyone yet. Jesus, I’m too fucking old for this. Except I’m not, which is why the damn profile is up.
‘Oh, not…
Right. So now I was… touching someone else’s breasts. I hadn’t really meant to already, but it seemed a bit rude to recoil now. I still didn’t know exactly what Sherlock had done before, but the last thing I wanted to do was to make her feel like I didn’t want to be here, or that she wasn’t ok. Because she really, really was.
‘No, Grindr, you don’t
‘God, yes, of course. Just come here, will you?’ John rose to his knees (oh god, the gravel, the pain) and pulled Sherlock to him (oh god, the pulsing skin and posh shampoo) and was immediately overwhelmed by the thousand textures that were Sherlock, and the singing of his blood, which alerted him to the fact that this was all that was right, and good, and about ten years overdue.
‘Yes.’
‘Oh don’t be so put out, just because you couldn’t wear those scruffy brogues you love so much. It wouldn’t make sense for
‘No, don’t even start! You! Have had a fucking hard-on, stiffy, erection, whatever, dammit, every time I’m near you, if you even try to- You have got one now, I can fucking see it, so unless there’s some other reason, or someone else in this house-’
It wasn’t that I was wildly turned on by her. Of course, I appreciated that she was gorgeous in an alien sort of way that made her hard not to watch, but I was also pretty sure that was popular consensus, wasn't it? And she had a terribly precious way of mixing unbelievable elegance with moments of complete awkwardness, in away that always made me want to laugh with gratitude that I was lucky enough to know her at all. But surely, if I had that same kind of chemistry that I had with men, I’d have noticed, right? It would have overwhelmed me until I would have done something, said something. I remember asking Harry how she'd known she was gay and she'd said, 'You know, you just know. Just like you know you like boys'.
‘May I, Joan?’ She whispered one last time, and I could feel the humid warmth of her breath across my… well, my… you know.
You learn you don’t think about your girlfriends like that, you stop your thoughts before you go there. Because it’s safer just to be what you’ve always been.
Sherlock sniffed something akin to ‘dontberidiculous’ and drew up her knees. Right.
Funny thing, human memory. Things were starting to get a bit slippery nowadays, sometimes he’d be thinking, and things would just slip on out. Train of thought derailed, disappeared like a lost tube car, gone to a station that had never existed. He remembered that, that case.
‘Why?’
Enter mild smut, stage left.  More of a prelude, really.
‘Bossy.’
‘Sh-Sherlock?’
‘It doesn’t fit. I get that you closed it. I accept your reasoning for why. What I don’t understand is why, considering your state of distraction previously, you seem so cheerful about this outcome.’
Sherlock eyed him curiously, ‘She said a lot of things.  Though I don’t quite recall her mentioning my facial structure in that particular context.’
‘But you love him.’ I state, because that is The Answer. Whatever the hell it means. I've been led to understand it is how people work. Once Love™ is ordained between the subject and their sex-person, all sense, and everyone else becomes collateral. Forget such joys as autonomy, mental communion, or parity when The Love and The Sex are at stake. Nothing must come between you and your socially exalted, organically produced, copulatory intoxicant. Heaven forbid.
A young man opens a drawer, and is reprimanded, ‘no, not that one’, by a cringing mortuary technician, whose thoughts of attempting lipstick are destroyed by the bright red of the body’s mangled skull. Slender fingers shut the drawer with the same flick you might use to direct a violin bow.
Finis. As they say (or don't say unless "they" are a silent film from the 1920s).
‘A guess, John, but knowing your writing style, a good one. Shall we descend from the roof? Your knees are killing you.’
*While expressing his other concern, John glanced at the violin case, with a look of consternation. Elementary, really.
‘I want you to know… there’s something… I’ve been meaning to say…’ she paused and licked more nibbling kisses into my skin. Her next breath felt almost like a sob.
‘Yes, less of that. More of the lips.’
Sherlock ate five. As usual. Then, as usual, she pointed out whichever bit of biscuit I had somehow managed to get on myself (‘honestly Joan, I shudder to think of you in the surgical theatre’ had been one memorable exposition). After which she, as usual, sucked the chocolate off her own fingers with a finesse that I found hateful, specifically because we both knew she looked more refined at it than I would using a fork and knife (besides, they were
‘Right. That’s… hang on, your birthday?’ John felt an unpleasant inner dropping sensation.
Sherlock was taking in his facial struggle with ardent fascination, and John couldn’t even begrudge him.
‘You froze just there.’
She’d scooted down a bit further and pressed her lips on the inside of my thigh, just above my knee. A wave of horrified pleasure sidled up the affected nerve as I realised that I hadn’t bothered to shave my legs for… oh dear. I’m not sure for how long. Sherlock removed her lips and pressed her forehead against my leg, nuzzling it. ‘Is this making you uncomfortable?’
I adored her. Of course I did. She was brilliant, fantastic, amazing. As much as I wanted to strangle her half the time, I also wanted to follow her around and show her off and keep her forever. I didn’t want to miss any of it. Not the deductions, not the ridiculous strops, not the horrible experiments, or the fabulous way she looked like a surprised stick insect in lab goggles. But still managed to act poised. Ok, I didn’t love the strops. But I kind of did. I loved that they had stopped bothering me as much as they used to. I loved that they happened, and I could walk out, and I knew I’d be back, and Sherlock knew I’d be back too. She was mad, and ridiculous, and sometimes the things she said made me utterly cringe, but part of me, a large part of me loved even that. End of the day, I’m not as good a person as I seem, and she’s a far better one than she lets on.
‘Yeah.’
‘I probably won’t even stay here for more than an hour or so.’
Sherlock shifted and took John’s face in his hands, ‘John. My wonderful, luminous, albeit somewhat idiotic John. We can’t both have crises at once.’
‘I know. And here’s your drink.’
There was a fine line between admiration and desire, and I wasn’t sure of it anymore. Between love and worship.
‘Hey, it was not my fault you called me while I was halfway back from work. In a gale, might I add. Those boots were practical. I don’t carry opera shoes in my… I don’t know… girdle, or whatever it is you do.’ An ongoing mystery to me was how Sherlock could be mincing around in deathly heels one moment, only to have them magically transform into something flat, grippy, and no doubt waterproof, the second we were called upon to give chase. As I hadn’t even managed to catch her changing footwear, I now suspected both her coat pockets and, more recently, her bra.
She looked up at me with a bright smile, and hooked her index fingers at the top edge.
‘You fancy me.’
She raised an eyebrow.
You release the breath. Blink tightly at the ceiling. Your eyes stay shut.
‘No. Not the second time. I’m often wrong about you. You keep surprising me.’
‘If you insist. You’re very warm inside, I enjoy it.’
'That’s it Joan!’
(In case it wasn't clear, the italics are Sherlock, the non-italicised portion is John)
‘No, I haven’t, is that who we’re looking for then?’
‘You know, human contact is meant to have positive benefits on immune response and brain cell generation,’ she continued muzzily.
You know, the Guardian, which I buy every weekend to read over a nice hot brekkie and do my crosswords, before Sherlock uses it to sop something up, or as wadding in a home-made combustibles experiment. Because it’s not like I’m in my 20s anymore, is it, and all those blokes on the other ones looked awful.  And the Guardian narrows it down enough that, with any luck, no one will ever contact me. Ha. Yes. Good plan, Watson. Very much in the 'getting out there' spirit.  Oh yes, also it’s hideously called called ‘soulmates’, and I’m pretty sure Sherlock will laugh herself into a coma when she finds out. Except she’s not going to, if I can help it.
‘Like what?’
But then, that felt wrong too. The thing was, I had never thought of it, girls. Sherlock. Not that way. I hadn’t thought of it because I made a habit of not thinking of it. I knew I wasn’t quite like Harry. That much had been obvious, and she’d made a point of it when we were teenagers, adults, even, pushing herself apart from me. She was gay. I was straight. I was
(sartorius, gracilis, iliopsoas tendon)
‘You won’t be offended?’
‘I’m gonna… take my jeans off, if that’s ok? They’re sort of uncomfortable… in bed. I can run and get my pyjama’s if you-‘ Sherlock shot me a look that made it more than apparent that pyjamas were not only unnecessary, but their presence would be found offensive. ‘Ok, just offering.’ I took off my jeans, fighting the urge to turn my back and do it, ‘sorry about the er floral knickers.’ I saw Sherlock’s lip twitch.
‘I am not arguing semantics! If you would just listen to me for a second- Will you give me that!’ Eyes watering, John whipped the cigarette from Sherlock’s grasp, preventing it from depositing a second generous offering of ash to his groin, ‘Thank you!’ Rather than flick it away, he took a drag. The flavour was somewhere between vile, and exactly what the situation needed. Mainly, it tasted like Sherlock on a bad day. ‘You finished yet?’
Sherlock gave a snort of frustration. ‘Why must you always bring her up?’
‘Yes, well, this isn’t the same. I’m not reacting in the same way. I thought I could control it, override it, and I can’t.’
‘Could be dangerous, that,’ Sherlock said, eyes glinting.
‘Ha, I bet you do.’ I whispered, and bit her ear.
‘Yes, you definitely seemed interested, that’d be why you keep checking your phone?’
His short, rough fingers twined through Sherlock’s long ones, both grown knobby with the years. These were the hands that had killed for each other, that had held each other as they ran through streets, had taken pulses, held each other when the world had bottomed out.
Sherlock turned his head against the brick to look at him, and John felt his veins pulsing with all the warmth and whatever other madness that had always drawn them together. After a moment, he could see the protective layer of scorn slip from his friend’s expression.
Several pieces of a puzzle that had been knocking about in John’s brain the last few months suddenly, and belatedly, coalesced. He allowed himself a moment to be subsumed in a wave of cringing regret. If only he could casually step back a minute in time, or at least have the foresight to equip himself with a ball-gag next time the topic of either of their emotions came up, as he clearly couldn’t handle his temper. Or adult conversation. Or anything, really.
‘You always assume it’s about a man.’
‘Shut up, John.’ Sherlock’s seething took on a glacial aspect, and John became aware that he had said something very wrong indeed.
‘Yes. Mrs Hudson harassed me with breakfast. And lunch. She’s pretending she likes the company.’
‘Of course.’
John scrambled up onto the roof outcrop, banging both knees in the process.
‘I will. I always do.’
I could’ve wept, but settled for clinging onto her hand.
‘Oh. God. Sorry,’ I gasped, ‘that was… that was… didn’t mean to… to come. There…’ I could feel her pleased smile, and a puff of warm breath skated across my skin, eliciting a pleasurable aftershock, I squirmed.
was the disturbing part of the whole previous monologue...
‘I… I don’t know. I didn’t know him.’ The morgue assistant looks like she might be ill. ‘It’ll be this one here,’ she almost whispers, pulling out the correct drawer.
‘I didn’t say anything.’
I try for a while. I know what to say to victims of suicide and grief, what you are supposed to say. It’s not the fault of the survivors if you can’t save your loved one. You were a planner, after all. After a sort. All the possibilities of every situation appeared to you in a split second, so surely, you must have thought this out too. Surely a few angry words from your friend couldn’t have made the difference, not when there had been so many. Or a few kind ones.
"You need a good shag is whats wrong. A man can only go so far with wanking." He of course thought he spoke from experience but as he thought he realized that Sherlock hasnt had a relationship for all the time hes known John. Not any that John is aware of anyways. Who would he even know enough to get off with? Well there was always—
At this Sherlock smiled a slow, sexy grin. "Second floor, 221B" John nodded and went inside to sort himself out. He went to his room, sat on his bed and began to chuckle hysterically. How this could be happening, he had no clue but John was not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. After a few minutes he collected himself. He pulled on a tee shirt, shoved himself into his socks and shoes, grabbed his keys and was out the door. He took the stairs to the second floor two at a time, anticipation and anxiety thrumming in his veins. He was at Sherlocks door in not time at all.
He arched his back presenting himself to Sherlock, who once again flashed that beautiful grin.
Then louder, "I had no intention of agreeing" It was John's turn to huff.
When he reached the landing everything was quiet, save for the creak of the floorboards beneath Johns feet as he walked into their living room. He knew he was entirely safe as he crossed the room to a brooding Sherlock who had in the spanse of hardly two minutes forgotten the gun in his hand and was curled in the fetal position on the sofa. The gun lay in his hand already outstretched for john to take. Sherlock huffed petulantly as John snatched the handgun from him. John very nearly smacked the grumpy, man-child but held back, aware that it would only make things worse.
He heard the rustling of Sherlock in his sheets and then his voice, though strained.
“I know,” Sherlock breathes. He takes John’s hand from his left shoulder and brings it to his lips, kisses it, pulls his lips away wet, a little bit sticky. “What –?” he asks, turning the hand to look at it more closely.
“Is that a yes, doctor?”
“Hey, c’mon, let’s get you dry, Sherlock –”
Mummy bustles out (taking a drink to the woman who shot him) and not long after, John arrives.
, John realises, knows where to lay the blame for some, if not most, of Sherlock’s fear: his Tide – or the lack thereof, rather.
John, for his part, returns what kisses allow his mouth to make contact, and when Sherlock dives for his neck and the skin over his pulse point, John turns so that he can plant kisses on Sherlock’s curls, his temple, the hinge of his jaw. Intent on his exploration, John shifts lower, kissing and sucking his way down, then licks up along Sherlock’s neck, and god, what a moment: Sherlock’s breath escaping in a harsh rush, his body surging forward and down to press John back against the mattress.
“It would take less than an hour –”
“You…” John finally manages. “You –”
It is, of course, comforting that the axiom ‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’ proves to be true, and in three key ways:
, buttons
John, touch-addled as he is, has an idea.
“Mmmh,” John hums. “I –” he places a kiss right in the center of Sherlock’s chest, “absolutely –” and then another kiss goes right under Sherlock’s clavicles, “agree,” he breaths into Sherlock’s suprasternal notch. John slips his hands up along Sherlock’s collar bones, curving over his shoulders, pushing the open shirt back and off and down, until only the cuffs keep it in place. Sherlock’s breathing picks up again, and John can feel his heart beat jumping beneath his skin, a different sort of wave hitting a different sort of shore.
John cries out, clutches at Sherlock as he comes, adding to the mess between them, adding his huffing gasps and groans to the air.
Sherlock’s skin ripples with a tremor. “I want to see you.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says after a long spell, head resting against John’s neck.
“Oh god yes,” John breathes, “oh god, if you’re sure?”
Sherlock takes one last, lingering look at John beside him as he wants him to be, sated, and his eyes are saying the things Sherlock won’t let spill from his lips, so Sherlock closes his eyes in the sun-drenched nursery, takes a deep breath, and opens his eyes in the kitchen and Christmas.
Sherlock blinks rapidly, and his Adam’s apple bobs. “Oh.”
“I’m going to say it,” John says into the sweat of Sherlock’s hairline, right where his ear meets his jaw. He isn’t laughing anymore. The light inside him is thick, golden. Molten ore, ready to be shaped.
John’s breath hitches and then stumbles into a laugh, and Sherlock’s looking down at him, half indignant, half amused, his mouth a wry twist, his eyebrow an unimpressed arch. God help him though, Sherlock’s combination of hesitation and decisiveness will always be John’s undoing – Sherlock is so confident in every other facet of his life, of their lives, that in this one area where uncertainty still crops up, his brazen bluffing is endearingly obvious, disarmingly tender and sweet, and John has absolutely no defenses against its charms.
“I know you said you don’t want to talk – do you mind if I do?”
“And John? Throw us a bone here, man – is Sherlock right about you? Do you really have no secret fantasies?”
“Sherlock Holmes,” the madman says, extending a hand. His fingers wrap comfortably around John’s as he takes the offered hand and shakes.
Sherlock opens his mouth, begins to say, “I lo–” but John is kissing him, unable to keep from doing so again and again. Sherlock kisses back despite a surprised huff and a few half-hearted noises of irritation. “John,” he breaks away, “I’m trying to say –”
Beside him, Sherlock scribbles down something short and – by the sounds of it – severe. John is hard pressed not to start laughing all over again as he realizes the likely reason for Sherlock’s intensity.
In the quiet and warm and scattered and
They are both drained, and that fact is written in their weak hands and heavy leaning against each other, and finally they sink down beside each other, breathing and watching and breathing, breathing, breathing.
Those words are shouted back at John over Bowie’s voice –
“Put your ear to the water – tell me if you can hear it,” John urges. The song is deep, low, with flutes of higher sound spiraling up, a salutation.
The audience applauds as expected, because that’s what they do when the answers match up (especially when they’re so unexpected), but John doesn’t miss the complicated look that passes over Sherlock’s features. It starts with satisfaction but is quickly replaced by something much more vulnerable, soft and brittle all at once – and then it’s gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Myself, I Do Not Count
“You are…content to never see them again?” Sherlock asks.
“John?” his mouth asks before he can quite catch it.
kiss to the head of Sherlock’s cock, this time greedier, and Sherlock jerks, a surprised cry between one breath and the next.
It’s ridiculous.
–!” Sherlock’s body rocks with each thrust, his pelvis jerking arrhythmically until John’s ventral tentacles shift to guide it in cadence and direction, pressing it firmly back into John’s advances. Sherlock makes a high pitched noise then, arms scrambling for a hold on John’s shoulders, his legs starting to shake.
“John,” Sherlock moans into John’s neck, breath gusting hotly against John’s pulse point.
“Good,” Sherlock huffs, and it’s a bit muffled, but John isn’t going to argue with the way Sherlock has pushed his face against John’s neck. “Good of you to finally see sense,” he amends. “I knew you wanted this. I saw you smiling just now,” he adds, as if
Sherlock swallows.
“Sherlock –” John begins, then clamps his mouth shut, not wanting to question their current arrangement lest Sherlock take it as censure.
, but that addendum catches in his throat, and ripping it loose might dislodge other things, and
“You –”
John flushes. “Yes. Makes – it – easier in water. Slick. Makes everything –”and John’s words fail and his eyes go wide as Sherlock licks the wrist he’s holding. John holds his breath as Sherlock’s eyelids flutter.
“It has been my experience that most paramours are quick to say they will make some great sacrifice for you, or perform some magnificent deed.” Sherlock’s mouth tightens for a moment. He looks down, then at the audience. “John has saved my life three times now, not including all the little ways in which he’s made it bearable and enjoyable and worth continuing.” Sherlock pauses. “Although quite frankly, the second and third time were over-kill. John can be such a show off.” Sherlock’s smile tries for playful, but it seems as if it’s just barely holding back a flood of things unsaid as he finally looks at John. “Honestly, all it took was the once, that first time during our first case together, saving me from circumstance and myself. I’m afraid I don’t think I’ve ever fully recovered.”
John thinks suddenly, and it’s as if those eyes miss nothing, because they crinkle in a smile, an actual smile, smooth skin belying the rarity of it. John’s breath catches in his throat.
Sherlock lets his thoughts rush ahead, and now they are naked, skin against glorious, glowing skin, and the nursery is bigger and brighter than he ever thought it was, with John pressed up against him, hard and willing and wanting.
“Sherlock –”
“Fine. Good,” John murmurs. He moves until he’s pressed against Sherlock, until his arms are swaddling Sherlock, every breath breaking softly over his shoulder, his neck, his curls. “I’ll just keep being here when you wake up, then. Until you have all the proof you need.”
He gets his legs up between one thrust and the next, heels digging into John’s lower back as he locks his ankles, and that’s it – John can feel the difference from one moment to the next, the punch of Sherlock’s breath, the clench of his muscles, and then –
“It was,” John says, and his voice is serious, but he’s filled with a tight joy, just waiting to burst. He scoops his arms around Sherlock and holds him.
“The water’s
They don’t let it go to waste.
John’s hands shift lower, find Sherlock’s hips, the crease of his thigh. Sherlock jerks at the light touch, then shifts closer, and John can feel the heat radiating from him, feel it increase. It makes John dizzy with want.
At this utterance John slowly came back to the room and very diligently avoided looking at anything below Sherlock's face. He nodded.
"Alright. Consulting detective? Never heard of something like that."
It was much later, hours after John gad taken his gun away from Sherlock. John lay awake in bed, watching his clock as it progressively got later and later. It read 3:13 AM when john heard a noise from downstairs. He tensed for a moment before realising it was probably just Sherlock doing one of his experiments or something of the sort. He heard the noise again but recognized it as anagonized groan. When he heard another pained grunt John jumped up from his bed, forgoing his robe for just his pants and a tshirt before he lumbered down the stairs.
"I got you all hot, did I?" John purred into Sherlock's locks, his voice vibrated into his skull softly making him shiver. This caught Sherlock of guard, he didn't think John would respond like this but he was pleasantly surprised. He lifted his head to catch John watching him, eyes crinkled in adoration, biting his lip with a little grin peaking through. Oh Sherlock wanted to play this game. Sherlock brought his voice down into that buzzing baritone that he knew always affected John.
"We dont even know each other. We're strangers."
John could hardly breath. How in the absolute HELL could this feel so good? He must have said it outloud because Sherlock paused his ministrations to answer him.
"What do you want me to do Sherlock? " John's lovely voice rumbled in his chest and Sherlock closed his eyes in pleasure. Christ, Sherlock thought, he could get me off with his voice alone. Sherlock groaned at that thought, fantasies alrwady forming in his mind palace.
"Ive been trying all day. It started just after you left for work. At first I tried to ignore it, thats almost always worked before. However when it didn't I tried having a cold shower. That didnt work. By then I'd gotten very annoyed with it and I needed to take out my frustration. You know how I like to shoot the wall. Found your gun in the pocket of that suit you never wear. Pity too, its a nice suit. Anyways I heard you talking with Hudders so I stopped with the gun and waited for the reprimanding I knew you would dish out. Ive been like this all day. I was half hard for short periods of time but I was still like that all day. Waited until after you had gone upstairs to try and get off. I even tried pornography. Nothing Ive done has helped at all."
Sherlock was already plunging a hand into John's pants, grasping at him softly and pulling a huffed shout of pleasure into the air from his doctor, which he happily kissed silent. As sherlock sped up his hand, John pulled away just slightly, barely an inch away, to huff hot breaths into Sherlocks mouth which he gladly returned. Had he not just came Sherlock would be hard in an instant but in his boneless state all he could muster were a few enthusiastic twiches against John's thigh.
When he got to the bottom of the stairs he saw that the living room was dark and deserted. Sherlock was in his room then. He thumped down the hall and knocked on his door, calling to him quietly through it.
"Jawwnn. What are you doing?" Sherlock's sleepy, post sex voice was alluring but John stayed where he was, looking at Sherlock with that charming, puzzled look that he so often wears.
"You agreed Jawn"
"I have nothing but respect for prostitutes but I am not about to go and have sex with someone I dont know Jawn. And There isnt anyone I know enough—trust enough to even consider asking. Not an option."
He could feel the shameful ideas of John dealing with his problem begin to drift into his thoughts where they were escaping from a crack in his mind palace. He wouldnt be opposed to John helping him in that way but he would never ask him to do that. He knew that John wasnt secure in his sexuality even if the oblivious doctor did not and he would not send him into a chrisis over his own selfish desires.
"Jawn. Nothing Ive ever done with you has been a one off thing. Why would doing this with you be any different? I know that you hate when I say it but as always you see but you do not observe. When I was explaining my predicament to you earlier when did I tell you it started?" Sherlock pressed a small kiss to the doctors chest as he waited for John to answer him.
John could feel the detectives teasing grin against his backside. He managed a little huff of laughter before growing a bit impatient.
"Jawn please anything. Anything you want, anything youll give me. Please."
Sherlock glanced at his watch. The man Would leave for work any minute now.  When he returned, the game would continue. And Sherlock was determined to win.
"I've seen you staring, so lets just get right to the point. Do you want to have sex with me?"
“Run!” Mycroft shouted, louder this time. He fell to the ground, his fangs bared. He clasped his head between his hands as a blinding pain overtook him. Through his blurred vision, he saw Lestrade turn around once more, pausing momentarily by the entrance to the warehouse. Molly pulled him out, and with a loud slam the door was locked.
“Yes, that,” Sherlock answered. “Shall we?” He gestured for the door again, and Mycroft started walking towards it.
John looked back at her, expressionless, for a moment. “Okay.”
“We should go. We can drop you off at home, Molly – it's probably a good idea if you stay there for a few awhile. Sherlock's brother and Lestrade are joining us, we're going to try and sort this out tomorrow night.”
“What's his name?”
John looked away from the men staring at him and stepped over one of the bodies by his feet as he pulled out his phone, pressing a few numbers.
Moriarty circled around him, more cat-like than ever as an immortal. “Better than that. Normal vampires are impressive, certainly,” he flexed a hand, and watched the torchlight shine off of skin as hard as granite. “But they’re too independent - I think we can do better. Dracula, after all, could create monomaniacal servants - or so we’ve been reliably informed.”
John surveyed the rest of the fighting that covered the courtyard. Tempting though it was, he couldn’t fight hand in hand with his men as he usually would. He had to get back into command mode.
The place that Mycroft had taken him was an office, but not one of the many that he had been brought to prior, on the occasions that the Holmes decided to kidnap him for a cup of tea. It was by far the largest of the rooms that John had been taken to, panelled in wood, with its rich crimson walls hung with art.  He wouldn't have been surprised if it actually belonged to Mycroft, rather than one of his employees.
Sherlock glanced at Lestrade, who was politely fiddling with his jacket and trying not to glance at John directly.
“Be careful,” he said, awkwardly placing a hand on her arm. “These murders aren't stopping and Sherlock isn't close to figuring it out. Take care of yourself.”
John spent the day cleaning the kitchen and, in an effort to silence his mind, the rest of the flat. He wondered if that was what it felt like to be in Sherlock's mind. By the mid-afternoon, he had managed to get a cup of tea in his flatmate's hands, and label most of the errant folders that were laying around the room. By seven thirty, he had everything organized, and he had convinced Sherlock to focus his attention on answering some of the comments on his website. With plenty of time to spare, he headed out to Lestrade's office again, leaving all of Sherlock's notes with Sally, who was oddly cooperative. Sharing the same worn-out expression as the DI, she mentioned that she had been at the crime scene as well, and had seen the victim while she gasped for air. It had taken a toll on everyone, and John found himself delayed as he tried to give a few words of comfort to the woman in front of him, as he had so many times before in his capacity as a doctor.
“That was – it had – it was trying to kill you, wasn't it?” She asked, looking between Sherlock and John for an answer.
John gestured at the three newcomers before them. “This is George, one of the heads of the Council. He’s controls vampire affairs in Central Europe. Caroline, she’s his right hand, and Charles; he served for a few years in Afghanistan with me. Two vampires and a human,” he said. As an afterthought, he added, “Well, a very old human, I mean. George’s mate. How old are you, now, Charles?”
“A few hours before sunrise, get a few rooms at a hotel or go to Mycroft's. I'd really suggest the hotel, though; somewhere cheap that won't press you to give your real names. The harder you make yourselves to be followed, the better. Baker Street's off-limits, clearly, and I don't want the three of you splitting up.”
“You mentioned that I blacked out. Did I do anything… out of character?” His eyes flickered to John, trying to gauge his reaction.
Lestrade leaned in. “Sure.”
“Maybe worth trying anyways,” John said.
“Good,” he said, a hint of joy in his ancient voice. “Do not be so easily cowed.”
John stared back at him, mouth agape, before realizing that Sherlock wasn't serious.
“Any chance you’ve looked at the gate? How did they get through?” John asked.
“Cemeteries, mysterious notes, and plenty of murders, all of which have occurred under vaguely unbelievable circumstances. It's like an elaborate Christmas present.”
“A murderer you haven't exactly caught,” John said, still defensive. “How else do you think we were found so fast by a group of people keen on killing us? I don't have bloody vampire GPS attached to me,” he muttered, opening up his phone again as he turned away from the pair of men behind him. Sherlock was unusually silent.
“An experiment,” Sherlock said. “If it worked, I’ll let you know.”
“Yes,” the man answered, amusement in his voice. “You really should have.”
“The other deaths?” he said, puzzled. “I'm not responsible for them. I don't know who killed them, but I'm afraid I'm not at fault.”
“The scandals of politicians do not interest me.”
“Come to think of it, I can't recall if I have,” Sherlock said, looking at him critically.
“I’m afraid it is,” George said, continuing on. “I know you thought he was dead – so did we all – but that doesn’t seem to be the case. You know as well as I do that these deaths have been suspiciously organized, and whatever organization responsible for them would inevitably attract Tom, and others of his breed.”
He let his words sink in.
“Shit,” Lestrade said quietly, before stepping away from the computer and yelling the same word more forcefully. He came back to the laptop and watched as a bright flash – Sherlock’s explosive – appeared on the screen and blew the police sergeant several meters back. Her head made contact with one of John’s bookshelves, and for a few minutes the three men watched as Sherlock fast-forwarded through the recording. Eventually, Sally stood, seeming both dazed but more conscious than she had appeared initially. As though taken over by an external force, the blank look reappeared on her face, and she could be seen answering a call, lifting her phone robotically to her ear. Then, just as soon as she had arrived, she left again through the window.
“This is the main map,” he said, gesturing to a coloured map, recently dated. “Most maps showing the levels of the vaults that you can download from the internet are variations on this picture from the government database. He flipped it over to show floorplans for each level of the vaults.
“Why?” Sebastian repeated, coming closer. For the first time, John could see a hint of insanity in his old friend. It was well-hidden, to be sure, but in this moment the mask fell entirely. John had always caught glimpses of it, but wrote it off; smiles that fell too quickly, battle plans that were always a hint too sadistic. Now, he realized what a mistake he had made.
“Quite right,” Sherlock said, glancing up from his phone. “It’s possible no one knows we’re here yet. If there are more traps laid in the vaults, and I’m positive there are, then all we’d do is warn them. One can only hope Mycroft has been successful in getting caught - I’m certain that in his interrogation he would find a way to suggest we’re still in London.”
Absently, rearranging some of the photos that were still on the table, John said, “he never said that I couldn't push anyone in the river.”
The pair began to walk up to the door, both glancing down the street to see if they were being observed. It was early morning, and the area was already beginning to become populated.
“Good,” John said. “That’s one thing sorted, then. It’s nice to see someone else has a plan. So, why did you call us back?”
“Could be more fun than a locked room murder,” Sherlock corrected.
“Not much of anything,” John answered, taking the crumpled paper out of the desk drawer. “Here.” He handed two folded sheets of notebook paper to Sherlock.
“When was she found?”
“Who? Honey, who?”
The cab ride to the club was brief, stopping well before the two men were near the club. Sherlock spent most of the ride pulling his coat collar forward, though his attention to covering his neck was apparently unnecessary, as the driver did not so much as give his odd behaviour a sidelong glance. Walking in the brisk, very early morning air, John led Sherlock down side streets and staircases until they reached an unusually dark section of road. It appeared as though all the streetlights in the area had burned out, and the only light that could be seen was a simple red circle near the door of a nondescript grey building.
As Sherlock came through the door, John immediately turned and said, “more vampires!” brightly, trying to set the mood.
“Not a clue,” he said, crouching down beside the body and pressing down on its chest gently. The grey skin sagged and then collapsed inward. John removed his hand. “Not a vampire, not a human.”
would cause undue attention, given the circumstances.
“Always,” John answered.
Carefully, he walked down one of the hallways leading out to a side door, and slipped through. Almost immediately, the blast of an explosive threw him back against the door. This time, he wasn’t lucky enough to avoid striking his head, and saw a haze of stars in front of his vision before he could see the scene before him with any clarity.  Once he did, he was struck by a sense of horror: ahead of him, one of the heavily fortified gates hung open. Chaos in the central yard of the base reigned, and bodies - both military and otherwise - lay across the ground. Some groups appeared to be fighting with one another, while across the road from him, bleary-eyed soldiers who were just as confused as John were exiting their own barracks.
“Do you think you'll be able to do that?”
The pair neared the street where they were due to turn.
White spots clouded Mycroft’s vision, and he felt sure that some force beyond his control was moving his body. More worryingly, something on the edges of his mind seemed to be inching forward, out of the darkness, taking it over. In his last moments of conscious thought, Mycroft thought several things; the thought that overwhelmed all the others was how desperately he wished he had told Sherlock what was going on. For all of the gentle prodding he directed at his brother, there was an underlying affection. Mycroft didn’t want Sherlock to suffer the knowledge that he had become a vampire - however, he also didn’t want to die alone. Again.
Molly looked down at the rapidly decaying body of the vampire on the floor and up to John again. “
“I don’t always work alone, you know,” Moriarty murmured, and as the echo of his voice faded out, steps along the stone work of the passages far ahead could be heard, slowly coming closer. Sherlock shifted to try and see down the hall, and Mycroft glanced at him briefly, willing him to stay still.
John, not particularly hopeful, tried a third number. This call went directly to voicemail.
John walked over, arms crossed. “What’s up?”
“I look forward to it.”
Sherlock detected the faintest hint of uncertainty in his friend’s voice, and then it disappeared. Both Lestrade and himself seemed to understand that this was the first time John had willingly chosen to disregard the wishes of an ancient vampire.
“That's a fair statement, yeah,” John answered.
“Are you sure, John?” he asked. “No one would blame you if you killed him.” Sebastian didn’t bother looking up, as though nothing registered for him beyond his failure.
“I left,” he said. “Let the Council know where they could find their assets, and had them fly me out. I saw my opportunity to let that version of myself die, and took it.” After a time, he added, “I couldn’t.” He breathed out heavily, and glanced at his hands in his lap before continuing. “I couldn’t look my remaining men in the eye and still feel I was capable of leading them.”
“Clearly,” Mycroft said. “But they have not, as yet, made his or herself known.”
“What's the plan?” Greg asked, sitting on the arm of a chair. Molly walked towards the living room and Sherlock immediately began closing their computers down and packing them into bags with the rest of his papers and journals.
Part of his mind wanted to back away, while another wanted to crawl forward to see if he could find shelter behind the toppled watchtower. An explosion above showered him in hot pieces of metal, and John flattened down and covered his head with his hands. All he understood in his disoriented state was agony, and when pain centered on his shoulder began to radiate out into the rest of his body, he barely recognized the new sensation. Exhausted, he finally gave in to the emotional and physical beating he had taken that day and blissfully fell into unconsciousness. The last image his mind registered was boots, across from his face, then cold blue eyes staring back into his own.
Sherlock nodded. “After you panicked in Baskerville, it seemed remiss for me not to.” With reluctance, he removed his arms from John’s shoulders.
“Informed by whom?” Sherlock asked.
John glanced back at Greg. “Sorry. Quickly?”
“Public transport, then?” Before Sherlock could grimace, John added, “I know how you enjoy that.”
“It does, however, seem to be a logical place to start. This seems like a good place to find a group of your... people?”
Greg considered this, and was struck by a realization. “Old cops, all of them have these stories about unexplained cases. Huge, glaring irregularities that their superiors shrugged off and refused to speak of again. That’s what’s going to happen to me, then?”
As they pulled up to the curb outside 221B, John took out his phone, glancing at it and slipping it back in his pocket. “I'm going to grab a few things and check some maps. Shouldn't take long.”When he turned to look at Mycroft, he found the seat empty, and his own door being opened. By the time John slid out of the car, Mycroft had already made it to pavement and was striding towards the door. “I'm never going to get used to you being that fast.”
“The man of whom I speak, Doctor Watson, is an old acquaintance of our mother's. He seems to have found himself being blackmailed by his wife as well as his mistress. I'm sure that it would be prudent, in the interests of keeping the government running efficiently during such a crucial time in the election season, to deal with it as discreetly as possible. I would go into further detail, but this is, as I'm sure you understand, a very sensitive issue.”
Once the three other men were in the living room – all standing and looking much worse than they had when they left hours earlier – John entered. “I need to go upstairs. I'll be back in a moment.” He made sure to make eye contact with Sherlock before he left, and assumed Mycroft would have the sense to make tea for the others. On the other hand, he thought to himself as he climbed the steps to his room, Mycroft was just as likely to pick a fight with his brother at the least convenient time possible. He would try to be quick.
When John stepped into Greg’s room, he was surprised to see the DI’s laptop open and a large number of folders open on the cheap hotel desk.
“You’ve been turned,” he stated, then asked, “you were made vampire?”
Sort of.
Charles picked George’s bag up off the floor, and gingerly lifted it onto the old vampire’s lap.
“It’s like there used to be another vault there,” John observed. This particular compartment seemed to be several times wider and deeper than any of the others.
“Yes, so, what's your theory?”
“Divide and conquer, I suppose,” John answered, looking up at him. Sherlock smiled and pulled his scarf tighter.
John stood to attention, confused. “And you didn't think to wake me up? What happened?”
“I didn't know what to do,” Mycroft said, looking down and following the hands of his watch as they ticked by. A few drops of blood had managed to make their way through the glass and had stained the face; the fleeting notion that it was an adequate representation of how he was spending his time as of late came and went. “I didn't know what to do. I tried to ignore it, the all-consuming obsession. I could walk down the street and hear every single heart around me beating.”
"You dont want me to leave? I thought..I thought this was a one off. That you just wanted to get off and you were nice enough to return the favor." John spoke slowly, although strained. Sherlock huffed and got up from the bed, crossing the floor quickly to reach John. He grabbed John's hand and pulled him back to the bed, huddling into John's chest as they were settled. It was a long moment before Sherlock spoke.
"Fine. Im fine Jawn. Go back to sleep."
John had been silent for a while now, facing the door now, poking at his lip a bit. Thinking. Sherlock could tell. He was restless and still ridiculously hard under his sheet but waited patiently for John to tell him what to do. John tensed briefly and Sherlock watched as he sat up a bit, straighted him self up and turned once again towards Sherlock. He began speaking slowly after taking a deep breath.
"My name is Sherlock Holmes." The stranger folded his arms and leaned them against the banister of the balcony.
As creepy as it was, John couldn't help but stare at his next door neighbor who stood stuped against his balcony banister with a lit cigarette dangling from his long fingers. He was an absolute beauty. A mop of dark, inky curls framed his angular face and from his seat in his living room, John could tell the man was thin but fit. The man had recently taken to strolling about in just his pajama bottoms and everytime John saw him he practically choked on his own saliva. John hasn't fancied many men but this one had him instantly captivated. John took care not to blatantly stare at the gorgeous man, but it was difficult. John sat gazing at the man, head resting against his palm not unlike the fashion of a lovesick schoolgirl. He glanced at his watch and sighed. If he didnt get a move on he would be late for work.
“ – all
John’s eyes snap open as the chime begins, and he barely has a moment to scribble a one word answer and toss his pen aside.
The twinned sensations of hot suction and slick pressure are almost too much, a jumbling, bewildering array of input, and Sherlock gives a shocked cry as his hips try to push up and grind down all at once, and in the aftermath of that confused clench he feels the muscles of his abdomen relax in release, feels his Pubococcogeus muscles flex –
John blinks at that. It’s – it’s a very un-Sherlock way of saying the thing, and if he weren’t exhausted and a bit off-kilter, he might’ve been able to make sense of it, but instead of clarity his head is filled with murk. “So you – you don’t mind? Me? This?” John gestures at his body, at himself.
But confusing and overlooking the indicators doesn’t change the fact that John’s Tide, decades late, finally arrives. It sneaks across his body like the neap swell it isn’t, and when John finally sees it for what it is, a spring tide and most definitely
John’s eyes snap up to Sherlock’s; he’s watching John, a question in his eyes. After a moment Sherlock looks away, and John takes a sip of his wine before asking one of his own:
John shakes his head, lets his eyes flutter shut. “No, feels good,” he says a moment later. “Like breathing. Like sleeping. Like touch.” He’s rambling, he knows, but everything feels perfect. The water around him, in him. The air in his lungs and mouth, softly abrasive. The vibrations in the room and in his throat. Everything.
‘Did you mean it?’ you ask now,
from home – I had my first bloody Tide
“Shall we?” John asks, and they help each other out of the grotto, walk hand in hand up the deserted beach, pick up their discarded shoes and socks, now full of sand, and get back into their landrover.
One long, pale arm reaches out and pulls a jumbled pile of sheets and covers onto them both. “Fix them,” Sherlock commands sleepily, chin-nodding at the sheets.
The Amesons only manage half points – they can agree on his shortcomings but not hers, it seems.
, he decides, because why not? He’d never thought to include it before, preferring locations more to hand, but now proximity is in its favour. And besides, isn’t this some sort of normal-people-sex thing? Childhood bedroom fumblings validated by returning as a full-fledged sexual adult? Tedious, but maybe John -
Sherlock huffs, but gathers the damp washcloths into one long-fingered hand.
Sherlock’s hands still a little, slip up to cradle John’s neck and jaw, tentative in their touches, so John slips his hands along Sherlock’s arms to lay his hands on top of Sherlock’s, pressing until Sherlock’s hold is sure. He lets his thumbs stroke over the backs of Sherlock’s hands.
Sherlock stands, and John reaches for his wallet, but gives up when Angelo levels a stern look at him. “Dinner was delicious, Angelo – and no dessert, thanks,” John says with a smile.
“Not my Tide,” he says, even as one tentacle – the ventral right – curls over Sherlock’s thigh, giving his quivering leg a squeeze. “It’s – it doesn’t
. Sherlock is buried inside John, grinding and thrusting without ever really retreating, John’s inside Sherlock thrusting hard and fast, and every twitch of Sherlock’s pleasure becomes a clench or spasm of want and urgency for John. It’s a feedback loop, undeniable, irresistible, so intense that when their mouths meet, it takes all John’s concentration to give something resembling a kiss – and from Sherlock’s slack lips, it seems he’s in much the same position.
They take their time.
Sherlock’s nails scrape against John’s scalp and nape, his hands shifting to get between John’s back and his vest, and John groans into Sherlock’s mouth – kisses him and kisses him until it seems that all of Sherlock has poured back into the crucible of his hot mouth, ready to be cast into John, to shape something new in the spaces between and within their lips.
sometimes.”
And while most of the time spent at home getting ready had been suffused with idle chatter-cum- reassurance that tonight needn’t be a 'big to-do,' he had felt gratified when Sherlock had spent even longer getting ready in the loo than John had (just a shave, after shave, and a bit of combing, and he’d been ready).
Sherlock frowns at John, and it turns absentminded halfway through. Then he ups and asks what, in John’s opinion, is the most dangerous question: “We’ve lived together for quite some time now. Why did I never notice before?”
–” Sherlock’s hips twist into and against the new pressure – three of John’s fingers now – and his breath stutters. His hands flail and anchor on John’s biceps. “That’s – there –” He huffs out a breath, and it’s a bit quivery, “I’m ready, John – please – please –”
“That – that explains why the bathroom isn’t flooded,” John says, a bit delirious, blinking up into the shower spray that isn’t being blocked by Sherlock. Little droplets seem to sizzle into him where they land on his new limbs. His human skin is less permeable, and the droplets roll down, tracing paths like a lover’s fingers might. He’d be worried about how impossible this all is if it didn’t feel so bloody amazing.
John feels the rhythm of their steps mirrored in his heartbeat, steady, unfaltering. He steals a glance sideways, then again, because Sherlock is made for starlight, and then John looks off away into the lamp-cushioned dark of the trees and winter growth. He’s smiling again, doesn’t care to stop it, because there’s plenty of pathway on either side of them, but their shoulders are almost brushing.
win first prize.”
“There, there, oh,” John groans, and Sherlock watches as John’s hands grip and adjust his hips, as John’s own hips pump into him, and he can feel each new angle register slightly brighter, incrementally better until –
John said: “You disappeared,”
The Tide keeps rolling in, bringing with it dreams of the crush of waves above and around, the gasp and surge of water through gills, the distantly-remembered thrill of powerful speed through clear seas.
“But,” Sherlock says, then pauses to swallow, “your –”
They just fucked and now he blushes because John expects to sleep next to him, because John isn’t running off – to the loo or his room or the next country over –
“I am not.”
Also, truth be told, John hasn’t a clue what to say next.
Sherlock wonders what the absorption rate of semen is where the tissues of the anus and rectum are concerned.
Sherlock tries a grin, and when it sticks he says as he shifts his hips, just a little: “You feel – likewise. Good. Um.” He’d somehow imagined far less talk and far more everything-
John shifts his weight, uncertain of what to say, to do, to make this uncertainty resolve itself. “Like….what, exactly?”
Sherlock imagines he would come first - masturbation has always been about efficiency and speed, or at least, it had been until John had sauntered into his thoughts - but old habits and inclinations die hard. He wonders if the order of orgasms is important, if John would care one way or another, but then John is so accepting of most things (heads in the fridge, thumbs in the crisper), so perhaps this would not be an issue?
Sherlock swallows against the tightness in his throat, has to look away - but then there’s warmth against his wrist, pulling his attention back, and that heat slides down to press against his palm, wriggling until it’s laced with his fingers, and they’re holding hands now - and Sherlock isn’t sure when he decided to move on to the touching stage of the fantasy. It seems disjointed, unbalanced. It is simultaneously behind and ahead of schedule, but perhaps it is still plausible?
And besides, there are so many things John wants to say that don’t involve words, but skin: palms, and hips – tongues, teeth, and lips, just the slow slide of skin, of touch. A carnal conversation.
Now that he’s awake and paying attention, the grit of the sand (not a fine grain, but not quite coarse gravel, with a smattering of smoother stones, tan and rust and white all at once), the slightly sticky caress of the breeze (heavy with salt and moisture and the mounting heat of the day), the very sound the waves make as they rush in and
“John?” Sherlock asks, suddenly sounding unsure.
as his hands scrabble and grasp at John’s coat.
“And?” John asks. “I got along pretty damn well without my tentacles before, you know.”
getting carried away, it seems,” Sherlock says pointedly.
Peaches are not.
Sherlock blinks open an eye and watches him for a long moment. “What do you mean, ‘now what?’ It’s settled, isn’t it? We’re mated now. For life,” he adds helpfully.
John huffs, can’t help the little grin, so he looks down, away, but when he looks up again he knows Sherlock saw, because he’s mirroring one right back at John, hopeful and cheeky all at once.
“John,” Sherlock sighs, and it’s half complaint, half frustration.
