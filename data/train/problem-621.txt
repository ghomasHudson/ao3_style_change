"I need to speak to you in private. And yes," he said, noticing that Sherlock was going to suggest he tell them both at the same time, "you alone."
"I'm sorry," he whispered. And this time, it was an apology that he couldn't fix anything. "So very sorry, John."
"A few more," John murmured. "You don't want to be tied to a veteran with an adrenaline addiction and a gun in the bedside drawer."
John nodded. "My favorite memory is probably my twelfth birthday. Harry was eleven then, happy and not drunk. I came home from school to find my parents had prepared a surprise birthday party. There was chocolate cake and rocky road ice cream and all my mates were there. I felt loved and happy, and I got my first stethoscope that day. And the nicest girl that I'd had a crush on for ages had given me a watch. Of course, that was before my parents died and that nice girl cheated on me when I was seventeen." He laughed melodiously. Sherlock loved that laugh too much. "So, basically, our happiest times were before it all went wrong."
"I believe you already knew that." He walked forward, standing over Sherlock. "Army doctors have prowess in other areas as well."
"SHERLOCK HOLMES, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!" John frantically attempted to go deeper, diving under the murky, icy water for just one second to try and find him. "YOU CAN'T!" He coughed a few times before returning to his search, hands barely able to move.
John was torn between relief and anxiety when he heard. Relief that their relationship wouldn't become awkward, in which case Sherlock would leave and it would hurt very much. Anxiety because now he wasn't sure what to do. Sherlock loved him, and John was scared he would do something wrong.
Sherlock slowly moved a hand closer to him, but didn't touch him. "You didn't tell her anything wrong. We'll find out what the problem is when we get it out of her captor."
"Doesn't matter. I'll be at the crime scene, and as you're a doctor, I want you there with me." Sherlock paused on his way out of the door. "You've seen a lot of bodies, haven't you? Grave injuries, deaths. Do you want to see some more?"
"The hostility is unnecessary, dear. You and your lovely bride aren't leaving this flat until I say so. If you've successfully worked things out, in a way I see fit, you can go, but not until then." Irene gracefully pranced up the spiral staircase leading to Clara's bedroom. "I'll leave you two alone, but I'm going to check on you both periodically."
Sherlock looked at John with apprehension. "I didn't see anything real. It would never happen, I can see that now."
John laughed. "I'm personally all for that. What do you say? Shall we call a cab and get out of here?"
Sherlock had just kissed John's ring, and John kissed his, and the whole thing was over after the presiding whatever guy had pronounced them husbands. John had grinned at Sherlock, and Sherlock had grinned back. There really wasn't any need for words.
The flat was so quiet at night. Sherlock wished he could fill it with violin music, but Harriet said it reminded her of Clara, so he stopped. But he itched for it sometimes, like now. The streetlights illuminated the windows just enough that he could have composed. Sherlock stood in front of them for a moment, looking outside. It was dark, but London never truly rested. He remembered chases through those shadowy streets, lit by only streetlamps. He shook his head. That was a long time ago. He had other things he needed to take care of.
"I thought so. You'd like him, Mycroft." In what world, John's blurry mind thought, do I look anything like the picture he showed me of Mycroft?
"Whomever has told you that told a grievous lie, indeed." He swept off into his bedroom, resisting the simultaneous urges to strangle and jump the doctor.
A giant sigh from the doctor and an eye roll. "No matter what the population of London thinks to the contrary, I am not gay!"
The elder Holmes brother looked down at him, bright blue eyes over the crooked nose. John had long understood that Mycroft had a certain fondness for him. Just like Sherlock, he seemed to enjoy his wits, thickheadedness and, most of all, his loyalty towards the younger one.
John nodded at the obviousness, not quite getting why Sherlock was making this such a big deal as he was aware; had been aware for a long time. “Yeah. Alright.” he said in irritation. His next thought left him stumbling, feeling awkward to discuss such matters so early in their not-yet-relationship. Still, it was important to be clear on all terms to avoid unexpected conflict. “It's still okay for you though, if I... I mean,
Again, silence followed. Silent understanding. Sherlock didn't understand how he could have taken all his life to finally meet and be with the man that was John Watson. Finally, acceptance, understanding, respect. It made him feel a warmth that hadn't been there for decades.
“I said you would not believe me.” he replied petulantly. “I would not believe it had I not seen it. I spoke to him. I became unconscious once more and had he not been present to ensure my safety when I woke on the shore, I would have told myself it was a dream, a hallucination. But he was there. I will meet him again tomorrow. Mycroft, I think.. I lost my heart.” he whispered, horrified as well as amazed by himself.
“But you aren't telling me off.” John waited through the necessary pause. “I'm not completely stupid, not even to your expectations. And I've learned... And you're not alone in this.”
They spent the following night in the same village, but would leave the next day to avoid conflict. They'd take course to Sherlock's parents.
Sherlock noted the honesty of the blond man before him. He looked around, his brow knitting with questions. “Where did you come from? Where is your boat?”
“The ocean,” John began, freeing one hand to pluck away Sherlock's from his cheek and trace his thumb over the back of the pale fingers, “is everywhere. I'm not.”
What did couples do? Where there differences in how a relationship works according to who was committed to it? Or was it all the same cheesy activities and dialogues? If not, what did John like in a relationship? He was always romantic towards his girlfriends, yes, but what would he be like with Sherlock? Did he expect Sherlock to be romantic back at him? Had he even ever been in a relationship without sex? What if he missed it to much and started cheating on Sherlock or left him!
With Sherlock, danger and death were like your clingy next door neighbours that were trying, desperately, to be your best friends. John had learned to welcome them with open arms.
A couple of floors and many dead bodies later, they had cleared the building, five new guns and many rounds of ammo at hand. They decided to call it a day, settling down in Greg's old office, where John sporadically prepared a meal for them.
“I have been pondering your idea.” Sherlock said suddenly, breaking the heavy silence that had coated 221B the last two weeks. John, attention caught, abandoned his laptop in favour of sitting down opposite Sherlock in their chairs. “As you probably figured out as well long ago, I am willing to agree to go on a deeper level of intimacy in our relationship. However, I have one condition: Slowly.”
“Please, Sherlock, I can't work like this.. At least lay down on the sofa?” John tried very hard to keep his irritation out of his voice and be gentle. Sherlock in return tried not to feel like he was pushing him.
Their couplings always left them with a peace not long lasting, but constantly desired. They spent the effort to swap positions so that the thinner man Holmes could lay atop his partner, his ear pressed to the doctor's chest. Capable hands roamed over his lean back as he himself caressed the knotted flesh of Watson's wounded shoulder.
They didn't last 12 hours with these people. John left them a few cans anyway, if only just to relief his shoulders off their weight.
Sherlock could guess what it might be. “No, it's not. Well, it is in a way.” He sighed, not knowing how to convey his issue on this matter. “Fine, but...” The rest went unsaid, but was heard all the same. He rolled the hem of his shirt back up just enough to show John the wound. The doctor looked into his face to seek his final consent and Sherlock nodded before looking away. It would, no doubt, have been easier if Sherlock was sitting down, but his legs felt too stiff to move and John didn't want to push him in an already uncomfortable situation like this. He was kneeling in front of Sherlock, nudging his hands up a little more as he tried to work, but the fists were blocking the light and hindering John's movements.
"Well, then I'll have to start with Poseidon and Medusa and Perseus then. Are you sure you want to hear it now?"
"Well, if you learn the words 'yes, please', then maybe there'll be something in it for you." Sherlock liked this idea, John could tell.
"Whatever." Clara slid her hand down Harry's waist and across her stomach, and Harry shut up pretty fast. John secretly marveled at how easily his sister and Clara fit together, like moon and stars, like the rain and the clouds. Or, as Harry used to say, like a stripper and their pole. John had always thought that description was a bit strange, though.
No one expects a knock at their door at 5 am, least of all John Watson. He sleepily rolled out of bed, rubbing his eyes while attempting to put on a dressing gown. He'd gotten back from...wherever it had been last night (?) and collapsed on top of the covers, so he wasn't exactly in the best state to be receiving. Obviously, the person at the threshold of the flat didn't particularly care about that. He picked up his phone from the bedside table and walked out to the main part of the flat. John ran a hand through his hair, which had fluffed into a crazy mess, trying to remotely fix it before he opened the door.
"You are NOT going to leave me after that," he murmured, yanking his shoes off and wading into the river. The current was sluggish, mostly because it was nighttime, but also because of how
"I'll find you," Sherlock whispered, saltwater making his voice hoarse. He had to stay calm, he had to stay in character. "Just keep talking."
"It was Donovan," Sherlock whispered, "I bet it was Donovan. Moriarty is smart, he planted that doubt in her head, that little nagging sensation you'll have to be strong to resist."
Mycroft folded his hands over his umbrella handle. "A few hours. Go to a jewelry store and buy John a ring of his own, eat dinner together at Angelo's, solve another case, laugh with him, and say your goodbyes. Instead of jumping off the roof again, you should jump off of London Bridge into the Thames. At least then, you have a better chance of living through the experience." He turned to open the door and walk out. Mycroft was not only craving alcohol, he craved cake.
Sherlock didn't expect John to come out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel around his waist. "Is that a proper motivator, darling?" John asked. His arms were folded, but Sherlock could see how muscular he was, and the scar on his shoulder was fully visible. John looked good, really good, in fact, so good that Sherlock had to grab onto the couch cushions to keep himself from falling off.
When Mycroft entered the pub, the first thing he did was order a Scotch on the rocks. He drank it within three seconds, slammed it down on the bar, and then ordered another. After he'd drank four, he stopped, and enjoyed how fuzzy his mind was getting.
Those two were taking forever. More than half of the pancake batter had been turned into pancakes, and his sister and boyfriend were nowhere near the kitchen. "Hey, you two!" he called up the stairs, after he was sure the new pancakes wouldn't burn. "Breakfast is ready! Your chummy talking can wait till later!"
Sherlock laughed for the first time since the warehouse. "I sleep in just a sheet normally, so this is more than I expected."
to say those words, like he had to get them out somehow. Or maybe John was just too blind with infatuation to see clearly! "I need to think."
"The other person left instructions before he died. I've dealt with him earlier, this has him all over it." He paused. "And we'll beat it out of him. Is there any other way with idiotic criminals?" John full-on grinned at that.
"I've only had one friend, and only one boyfriend. I don't know how relationships work very well." He really didn't, this was just one of the few times he would admit it.
For some reason that probably involved John, he didn't like seeing Harriet unhappy. She deduced that he was unhappy, which was so uncommon, John had only done it a few times since he'd been here. Harriet was more like her brother than she thought. She wanted to make sacrifices for other people, she was relentless, and didn't give up. Of course, Sherlock wasn't going to mention this to either sibling, for fear of a massive row. His head was aching a little, and he was sure it would get worse if prompted.
"We can make her come into ours, darling. Besides, since it's my fault its stature is compromised, I gave you an idea to fix it." John turned Sherlock around in his arms. "Why are you worrying?"
He finally came up with a deep emerald green button-up that made his eyes look green as well. He hated how dull they were, colorless, you couldn't name what they really were, and that infuriated him. John couldn't be truly named either, but he was far from dull, so it was alright. Sherlock carefully slipped the shirt on, noting the tightness in the chest, and a neat suit jacket. He ran a hand through his curls in front of the only mirror in his sparsely furnished flat. Acceptable, not good enough, but John seemed to irrationally like him.
"Alrigh-" The man pushed past him, heading toward the chair across from John's preferred one. That chair had always been empty as far as John knew, and yet the visitor seemed so
Mycroft Holmes had a few purposes in life: remaining the most intelligent being in the room, taking care of his little brother, Sherlock, and making sure the world didn't fall into war. In that order.
John could feel himself blush. "Hey, I'm supposed to be comforting you here. None of this complement business."
John sighed. "Yeah." Sherlock tried to muffle the ticking he heard in his head. Why did John have to play all the parts? Why did they have to recreate the memories? Why did it go on?
"When is your birthday?" Sherlock asked. He had to get the date correct. The space in his mind palace was very disconcerting.
John's eyes widened to the approximate size of teacup saucers, and Sherlock was sure his did the same, but John didn't say anything. "Alright, which one of you can get me some cake?"
When I originally wrote this, the proposal wasn't in the chapter plans and kind of came out of nowhere. *shakes fist at characters* But anyway :) That flashback never actually happened, but I needed the full-name thing from Season Three. Timelines. They're not real.
John knew that people were as shallow as Grace everywhere. He knew it, so he didn't try to get very close to his other (numerous) girlfriends. Sherlock...well, he was different. John had never been scared to get close to Sherlock, even after that whole thing with the pool and the Semtex. Sherlock had saved him when they met, and he kept saving John every day. Why
"Our couch." John looked at him like he was crazy. "We do have an experiment going on, and I will get results with or without your sister singing obscene children's rhymes. I'm staying with you."
Harry eventually came to Tesco every day Clara worked and begged her to take her back. Clara had changed shifts, so she didn't know about it until Kate, her supervisor, got tired of it. Harry showed up every day, at 10:00 am precisely, and wandered through the aisles for six hours, taking a break only for lunch. She was loud, people told Clara, and disrupted the customers, but no one ever got close to getting a restraining order for her.
He turned the lights back off; John fumbled for a flashlight in his pocket. And this was where it started. Sherlock made rattling noises against the metal in the bathroom, and the doctor looked around. The detective screeched like a monkey, and John, startled, went back to the window, trying his key card again. Sherlock knew he had John trapped well and good.
Moriarty had threatened John's life, and Mycroft knew that every part of Sherlock's sense, what little he had, was torn away.
Clara groaned, putting her hands on her head. "No. Not anymore." Ugh, how did everything get this messed up?
The reporter found another stack of papers and flipped through them, handing certain pieces to the blogger. John wondered why Sherlock wasn't standing up for himself or something! If it all wasn't true, than why wasn't Sherlock throwing out deductions to prove these people wrong?! "I'm the Storyteller, I'm on TV," Jim added desperately. If he really was an actor, he was damn good. John swore under his breath.
The wind had stopped howling, the clouds had stopped floating past, the water had stopped splashing, forming a little funnel around Sherlock's entry point. For a single moment, John couldn't move.
He stepped behind the curtain, sighing in happiness as the water washed away the silt and other more disgusting things dumped into the Thames. That river had a serious need for cleanliness, or some new laws or something. Jesus. John found the soap and lathered it in his hand, sliding some of it over his shoulders.
"I need to keep myself distant from it," Sherlock murmured. "From him. He wouldn't understand why it is so scary because he didn't see and interpret what I saw and interpreted. No one could ever leave him but me, and even when I did, it wasn't how my dream went." He paused. "There is something wrong with me, thinking about him when I'm with you." The old John would be back, and Sherlock couldn't think about that. He had to pretend like time wasn't ticking away to the moment John would realize Sherlock wasn't good enough for him.
" He stopped. John was going to get too angry, and Mrs. Hudson would still be shot. "Sod this. Sod this, I'm going. You can stay here, alone."
"I need to see Major Barrymore right away, so you need to search the place. Start in Stapleton's lab, see if there are any large dogs."
The detective nodded. "He will. He'll probably want to hurt me, to leave me, but I deserve it. Especially after last night."
"Yes." Sherlock couldn't say much more than that. John looked him over. The detective was obviously shaken, and John let a mischievous grin spread over his face as he realized why.
had happened, an entirely unmeant, accidental thing, John was either going to make him leave, since Sherlock had promised they were just
"I keep thinking I'll get used to that title, but I really doubt it." John let them all into 221B, dropping his keys in the bowl next to the door.
John pulled away. "You make a fair point, my love. Let's go." He picked up the giant bowl of pudding and headed out into the sitting room. "We came with pudding, Mrs. Hudson!"
"See? One of the reasons I absolutely adore you," John replied, rising on his tiptoes to peck Sherlock's cheek.
Clara saw Harry laying there, looking so beautiful and small and harmless, and decided she'd give the Watson a second chance. They both were miserable, and that wouldn't get better without the other to help them.
Harry woke up to the sound of knocking on her bedroom door. "Ah'm cooooommin'," she slurred, shuffling over to the door. When she opened it, her drowsiness immediately went away.
"Well..." John sat near him according to the dent next to Sherlock's legs. "My little sister has always been able to judge feelings: love, specifically. I don't know whether she can read me, she's never told me anything like that, but she can read you, apparently, through all the masks you wear." Sherlock felt a finger trace his bottom lip.
Harry laughed. "I miss makeup sex quite a bit, but we don't have to do that for a while if you don't want to."
Clara found her in Aisle Ten, helping someone find the frozen meals. "Hello," she said, flashing a smile at the customer. "May I speak with the manager for a moment?" The man, wearing a dark coat and blue scarf, blushed.
John ran a hand over Sherlock's shoulder, a finger tracing its contours. It was like he was mapping out Sherlock, as if he were a new and foreign land just being discovered. "Okay." He kissed Sherlock lightly on the cheek. "Mystery Man."
Maybe a year and a half of John's blinding happiness passed before it all exploded. There were three days of John being in incurable agony, telling Harry he didn't know how long he could last, telling her Sherlock was gone and was never coming back, telling her he'd never known pain in Afghanistan, even when he was shot, but he knew it now. Harry knew she couldn't help, and that killed her.
“Fine. Things haven't really changed all that much, to be honest.” John said calmly, pouring a glass of water for Mary.
But as it turned out, he learned a lot from it. For example that it's best to be relaxed and calm when participating in physical intimacy like kissing. John stimulating him that way lead to a nice bout of pecking and a calm mindset was more creative, more prone to let go and explore. And that Sherlock did.
Mycroft stepped closer and shook his hand, though more as a gentleman than as gesture of equality. “The mystery creature of my brother's little tale.”
Sherlock would mostly lay in John's arms, snuggling back against him. Not because John was the dominant party, but because it comforted him, made him feel safe and secure. In John's arms, he was free from accusations and prejudices. In John's arms, he felt at peace.
Her footsteps, balancing herself on the stairs, were still audible when John went into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea as well. Sherlock followed him, but not knowing what to do in this situation, he just stood awkwardly behind John. After a while, he decided to attempt to dissolve the tension by speaking out to “John-”, but the blond stopped him with a clipped “don't, Sherlock. Just.. say nothing.” and Sherlock, indeed, shut up.
“I'm not entirely sure I can believe this, but the evidence of your teeth is a little.. hard to contradict. And all this detail.. You couldn't have thought it all up within a day.”
Inside the building, John handed Sherlock one of the knives – gunshots were loud and only to be fired when unavoidable, but the Met was rather empty, yet, and it would do to have Sherlock as a safety measure behind him.
It went as usual after that day. For months they continued doing their stuff, with no further mention of what had happened. That was, until John found himself hospitalised by a bullet in his side.
Eventually, the blond would turn his head into him, close his eyes and just seep away into their own harmony. Sherlock would rest his head against the other's, listening to the warmth in his chest, pondering the strange appreciation for feeling nauseous like this.
hurt, though.” he warned, but Sherlock's face was unmoved. After a moment of uncertain staring, John moved his head forward, opened his mouth to give his fangs space to grow and, hesitantly, pierced the seemingly translucent skin on the inside of Sherlock's wrist. It was a good spot. Barely any puncturing was needed to get blood to flow out in little beads. The pain was minimal. John reluctantly licked at the punctured wounds. It was an awkward thing to do on his friend, but, simultaneously, it felt amazing. He hadn't tasted much blood in his life, always careful to stay healthy, but he remembered each one very clearly.
He watched the muscles along John's back draw tight and release in a rhythmic succession, a job they were well accustomed to, it appeared.
“Ah, no. Sun does shit besides giving you an unpleasant burning sensation. It can be easily helped, though, simply by going through the pain and getting a tan. The darker pigmentation keeps the UV rays out and away from the sensitive lower layers.”
There was a hot moment in which they stared at each other, interrupted by the sound of the front door opening and shutting. “Here comes the bride.” Mary spat unhappily.
Sherlock chuckled his deep, dark chuckle and John did. He did drown. In the sound of it. He turned his head back to look up at the darkening sky. “We need to get dry and warm.”
Sherlock let out a deep chuckle. “Non, Hamish. Pas pour Noël.” he answered in a cheery manner and Hamish made a disappointed noise.
Sherlock was clever, and insensitive, as ever. He seemed to genuinely enjoy the tests he was given, without a care for the people whose lives were at risk. They were only the trophies, the confirmation of him giving the right answers, nothing more. Or were they? John wasn't so sure at times.
Retirement turns out to be easier planned than done for a constantly working mind. Watson knows how to help.
The man smiled brilliantly, as if fond. A sound of laughter stepped right to the border of his teeth, but never through. “You ask a lot of questions. I have no need for a vessel.” he replied. A second later something the looks of a tail fin reached above the water's surface and Sherlock did not believe his eyes. “Why do pirates steal from others? You are a pirate, are you not?”
Sherlock stayed quiet for a moment before shifting to cuddle up against John's side. The doctor threw his arms around the lean body fondly. “We are going to get through this, right?”
The creature moved , positioning himself at the end of the plank, where Sherlock's feet rested, and set it into motion. “England it is! My name is John.”
The edge of Sherlock's lip curled up in a satisfied smile. Lestrade wasn't quite as pleased. “So we know
“My men are dead, my ship is broken. I have nothing left in this world.” He watched John's eyes focus on his. “And neither you in yours.” he said, motioning with his hand at the deep, red scar at John's shoulder.
“My dear old fellow,” he addressed me and it was the softest sound I had heard until that minute, “I am glad you felt yourself ready to tell me this.”
Sherlock shuffled as close as he could get, tightening his own embrace around John to the point where John had to slap his arm lightly because it hurt. He made a noise of protest, but loosened his embrace nonetheless. The slapping turned into caresses.
John stopped to look at her for a moment, wondering how he hadn't seen that in her before. “I thought we had discussed all this.”
One more update later tonight (or possibly tomorrow morning, depending on how long we'll take to eat and tidy up again), which is going to be the second chapter to my kidlock Christmas fic :)
Slowly Sherlock let himself slide sideways so he was sinking lower, ending on many short, but desperate, pecks before laying his head down in John's lap.
“If you have nothing but shit to give me, Mary, I suggest you leave and try to shift your centre of interest a little.”
John's smile feel to sadness. “It is possible, but our worlds are too far apart. We mustn't get lost in a fascination that would not sustain our lives.”
But there was none of that in Mycroft's eyes now. They were the cold, hard gaze he had experienced in their first encounter; the distrust and expectancy of the wrong move. He was every bit a chess player and John, while not strategic, a worthy opponent.
When John came back from work the next day, Sherlock sat in his chair, staring at the entrance to their flat like a predator waiting for his prey to walk in. John stopped abruptly when he saw Sherlock sitting there like that, his eyes wandering around the room, searching for some plot to start a conversation with. “I see you are very eager to talk to me straight away.”
Sherlock spent a large part of his day in solitude, withdrawn from the other two, occupying himself inside his mind palace, to which John didn't have many objections – at least he wasn't complaining about boredom.
Flat on his back, he looked beyond uncomfortable rolling his shirt back up. In order for none of it or his hands to be in the way, he had go past his point of comfort and he was torn between looking away and searching John's face for any form of reaction.
A shave and a splash of water later, John felt fresh. Fresh and clear and ready. They would leave Baker Street and try to find other people. He couldn't continue sitting around, waiting for some quirk of luck to turn the world back around. Someone else must have survived until now; someone must still be out there.
“Oh, well thank you.” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes, smirk betraying his fake exasperation. He got serious again quickly, though. “Seriously, John, I would love to help.”
The night passed along quietly. So quietly in fact, that John got up and walked around a bit on their floor, looking out the windows just to make sure that the dead people were still roaming on the pavement outside. Some of them already showed minor signs of decay, others were still in top shape, like Mrs. Hudson had been. She hadn't been bitten or whatever, just died and then lived again. This could only mean, that they were all infected already – whatever the cause. Everyone. Him and Sherlock. They'd die one day and turn into one of these.
And just like that, they went on with their life. If ever John thought Sherlock was difficult to live with, he'd never felt more wrong about it than now. It was as if the detective had just forgotten about it, and, to be fair, chance was high he'd honestly just deleted it all.
Moriarty made him say things. Things like “This is a turn-up, isn't it, Sherlock?” and “Gottle o' geer”, which was just pure sarcasm. John being the ventriloquist's doll.
John inclined his head, trying his best not to throttle the man for his arrogance. “Do I look to you like I am joking?”
Sherlock scoffed at that. “Don't be so dramatic. It's just a cold- oh.. I, er.. I forgot.” apparently the detective suddenly remembered and his tone was tinged apologetically.
The doctor laid off the temptation to capture that side with his own lips until he had spoken again. “I would claim regret, but alas, I do not.”
Short, but sweet. It came to me as I was sat in uni and I originally scribbled the beginning of it on a receipt from our uni's library. Oops!
John sat down with them as he finished loading the table and looked at their son. “We adopted you. Your mummy and daddy couldn't take care of you the way you deserve so they gave you to a home with many other children where people like your father and I can go to see you and talk to you, talk about you with one of the nannies and then decide whether they want you as their child or not. Many people do that. Same-sex partners like us, mixed couples who can't or don't want to have own children. We wanted a son and so we went there to give a boy a family.”
He meant for it to be soothing, but clearly John was not satisfied, though he didn't argue for now. Lestrade, as ever called late to the action, took the three criminals off their hands and, thanks to John's skills in doctorly persuasion, let them leave with the agreement to come in for statements the next morning.
Sometimes, they just sat there, looking at each other. Other times, they didn't pay each other the simplest of glances, couldn't bear the honesty they knew sat behind the flat faces, the dishonest, short half-smiles; the bare soul of uncertainty. Trying to keep the spirit high was remarkably difficult these days. Maybe it was because their landlady, who had died approximately half an hour before being found, had come upstairs to greet them with a friendly long groan. Maybe it was the fact that she was going right for Sherlock. Maybe it was the fact that John finally put her out with a gunshot to the head. But, you know, maybe he was just being a little paranoid.
“Chinese it is.” John confirmed, zipping his jacked and walking over to plant a kiss on Sherlock's head. “Later!”
“Some websites say only the canines are very sharp, other say there would be an entire set of teeth above the ordinary ones. Then again, with the first theory, some claim the canines would always be present in their outstanding length, while others are convinced they grow with a vampire's blood-lust. Then there's that. Almost all websites claim that vampires need to feast on human blood to survive, while others suggest that animal blood also works,” as Sherlock listed his findings in quick succession, John let himself fall into his own armchair, “and the bite is either deadly or converting the victim, which could otherwise happen by the vampire infusing their victim with their own blood-”
Sarah and he did break up, though. He agreed that it was best for her. He didn't have enough time for her as it was with Sherlock and the Game they found themselves in so suddenly – he didn't want to actually have her die because of their relationship. They stayed friends and there were no harsh feelings between them, which, for the sake of their work together at the clinic, was very helpful.
Sherlock's voice was demanding, panting, breathless and weak, but with a force of will as if he could make it so with just his words. “Are you alright?!”
Holmes gave a dismissive expression, then he smiled. “I simply know my Watson.” He pressed his face into the crook of Watson's neck, working his mouth across the skin there.
“I must admit, you did good on hiding from me, John. Then again, I had little time researching you before our very first conversation and finding this piece of information required a deeper digging.”
Slowly, he lowered on his belly, his face inches away from his saviour's and he studied its many movements and angles as he spoke. “How old are you?”
After his quick tour to Mrs. Hudson's 'grave', which had become more of a habit than he would like to admit, he went to turn in for the night.
he was thinking, probably nothing at all, but this, just feeling, physically feeling a warm, breathing, pulsing body beneath his hand, it was the most incredible sensation he could remember having ever had. When Sherlock calmly blinked awake, he didn't say anything, didn't tell him to stop. So John didn't. In fact, he went to touch more, feel more. Sherlock never drew back when their lips met. He didn't protest when John absent-mindedly lead his friend's hand to his lonely cock. He felt so fucked up, he didn't even care that it was Sherlock doing this any more. He just needed this right now. He even tried to return the favour, but Sherlock stopped his hand and held it till they fell back asleep.
“All of this.” he dismissed, not caring to go any deeper neither alone nor with John. Physical and psychological boundaries were still too completely different things.
“Wrong question, John. With that wording you are subconsciously giving me the impression that it would be normal and expected of me to be okay with it, making me feel guilty, unnatural and unsuitable for you if I wished to say no and thereby forcing me to say yes.” Sherlock corrected, keeping his look straight forward, trying his best not to sound scolding.
His big green eyes scanned his face as he suckled on his thumb briefly before nodding with another delighted giggle. It sometimes shocked John how mature and intelligent the boy was for his young age of only five years. Granted, he tended to be silent, chose noises over words and many people actually thought he was far behind in his development, but when they got to know him, they discovered he was just a little shy and very, very thoughtful. He knew all the words and he knew how to say them, but he seemed to forget that people understood by hearing, rather than by reading his mind. Either way, John was proud of him. The boy rushed past them, having acknowledged that he'd get less fussing if he just followed daddy's rules. He began digging out plates, mugs and cutlery, a set of which they'd deposited in the lower cupboards of the kitchen, the ones Hamish could reach. John giggled in proud delight and turned to kiss Sherlock's cheek on the way to the stove where he set to prepare a festive breakfast while Sherlock repeated French vocabulary with him. He was ever so fond of Sherlock finding occupation in playing and teaching their son as well, even if he thought he was taking his education a little too far for Hamish's age, but the boy seemed to have his fun. At least he spoke a lot during these lessons
“Pick another.” he said warmly and Hamish returned with a bigger package this time, climbing up into John's lap before opening it just as carefully.
“Have I said, with one word, that I would not care for our child?! Are you really accusing me of that?!”
! Are they.. From when are they?!” Hamish asked in awe and excitement as he gingerly fingered through the pages of two old books about sciences.
“A moment ago you thought me a siren, so indescribably beautiful I could lead you to your death and now you insult my very face. You're not much of a noble man.” There was no anger in John's voice, only fondness and a bit of cheek.
Holmes' eyes flickered down to Watson's lips as if to suggest a better method of showing his gratitude. As if he could read minds, like he so often had accused Holmes of doing, he pressed his mouth gently against his partner's once again. “Now,” he whispered as he made a few inches space between them, “won't you join me on the chaise longue?”
John stared at him for a moment, waiting for the big deal Sherlock's posture promised to weigh on him. When the man said nothing more, John caught up. “Sure. What would the problem with that?”
“Your brother's name is Mycroft? Your parents had poor taste.” John joked, before realising what off a reaction that was. “I didn't mean- apologies!” he tried to sooth, but Sherlock shook his head, smiling.
“It would still be the correct thing to do.” John reasoned, trying to clarify that it would be fine if Sherlock asked him to.
Sherlock blinked grumpily against the sun shining right in his face. They'd fallen asleep on the sofa, cuddled up, watching something he didn't care to remember. John's arm was still around his waist and he buried his face deeper into the wool of his jumper, listening to his heartbeat. Like this, he liked to reflect everything that was happening around them, listening to the traffic outside, Mrs Hudson downstairs and John's watch next to him. He smelled the dust of the flat, their food, the books and the wood. He smelled John, felt his solid, warm weight against himself and his chest rise and fall beneath his cheek. He idly traced the line on his abdomen, a scar long gone white, still visible, but it didn't bother him. It was just another one. He had come out to some people, his friends, and was glad to see none of them seemed bothered. He didn't mind his scars as much any more either. They were there like John's was on his shoulder and the smaller, more plentiful ones on his back. He'd cared less and less every time John had kissed around his chest. He didn't avoid them and didn't pay them any extra attention. They were just scars – lines on his body.
“You may believe as you do, brother. I merely wanted to inform you about the misfortune that took apart my life.” he said evenly as he descended back down the stairs. He left without another word, furious. He had not dreamed it up and quick as it had happened, it was right. It felt as if he had known it for all his life, a reveal of a long-known truth. He had sailed without clear course and he had found it now. He decided to spend the approaching night with what little fortune he had left, stolen out of his brother's pocket. A pub would have him many beers or a bit of rum for it.
“You lost your head, is what truly happened! You cannot believe you fell in for fairytale, Sherlock, you are above this!” Mycroft protested, but Sherlock would not hear him.
“So this is it, then?” Mary asked, her eyes wet. She was refusing to go all the way and cry now, though. She looked like she'd done that a lot recently.
There was a brief moment in which John looked at him irritated, but as soon as it passed, John drew one leg up onto the bed, turning towards Sherlock more. “I'm, uh.. I'm sorry about-”
Her question was fair, he had hardly moved at all today. He'd awoken to the sounds of Watson leaving for his practice and not been in the mood for activity. Besides having breakfast, the only real trips he had made were to the WC and to the armchair, which he was currently occupying still. Not even the cheek tone in her voice could rouse him to display any emotion other than utter boredom. “Quite so, Mrs Hudson. It is a very dull day, indeed.” He rolled his head along the back of the chair and thought ahead to the evening when his companion was to return after these God-many hours. “Oh, incidentally, Dr Watson and I were rather hoping to spend the night more intimately.”
To his surprise, Sherlock tore his eyes away from whatever he was studying and turned around “Tea? What happened to coffee?” he asked, obviously confused.
It was the 23 of march when they got called. Well, Sherlock got called. Well, emailed. Sherlock got emailed. But John followed. Sherlock asked him to, and after fighting with darn technology, yet again, literally
For the next few days, England's citizens were glued to news reports of all forms, hunting down all the information there was to get from the developments in Germany and then Austria, Swiss, Denmark, the Netherlands. It seemed to be spreading like some kind of virus despite the surrounding countries swearing to having had all borders closed. Maybe it actually was some sort of virus then? Something that got into their systems some time ago, waiting for days, weeks to spread through the body and make them into.. 'Zombies', they say, as if this was some fucking film!This was real- the
John folded his arms on the ground and laid his chin atop them. “I have experiences.” he confirmed before elaborating. “I used to travel a lot. I have been with women from three different oceans.” He held up three fingers like Sherlock wouldn't believe him otherwise.
John and Sherlock both looked equally taken aback. "What the hell are you talking-" "What do you mean, John never-" The two cut themselves off once they realized they were speaking at the same time.
That actually shut the female up, which surprised both men. "Now, back to our original conversation. Sherlock, what do you want for dinner?"
John couldn't take it anymore. He leaned forward and placed the tiniest kiss on Sherlock's full bottom lip, then on his top lip, and then kissed him fully, but not long. "Do you want me to? Because I do."
He shook his head in disbelief. "And how did you happen to meet the most influential dominatrix in London?"
"Right, Mycroft." He could hear the sound of clothes being put on, and a gun being strapped to a belt. "I'll be there as soon as I can."
"Good." The doctor ran a finger over Sherlock's lips, and then went back to his pancakes. "How long do you think it will take for Harry and Clara to get back here?"
"Okay, you need to pull yourself out of that fucking well you dug yourself into. Ever think that maybe my brother is falling in love with you?" Saying it was worth the look on Sherlock face. "He's not just going to throw that away when he remembers exactly who you are. Johnny may not be the best with temper, I'm not either, but he would never do that to you. And even if he isn't in love with you," Harry walked over to him and put a hand on his head, "he feels too much for you as a friend to let you just stroll out of his life."
Sherlock nodded. "I've gotten quite fond of your pancakes. I believe I learned to say 'yes please'. You would be proud."
"Wow, you are drunk." That soft look in Gregory's eyes wouldn't go away. Why wouldn't it go away? Mycroft was a horrible person and didn't deserve that look.
Sherlock huffed and muttered, "How did I ever stand how right you always are?" but he made sure John wouldn't be able to hear him. He wasn't ready to have that conversation. Plus, the tingling streaking through his body like electricity was making it too hard to think.
Lestrade stared at him like he was crazy. The looks got a bit irritating after a while. "There were only three."
been very good to me. Hi, my name is Clara. You must be Sherlock Holmes. It's nice to meet you." Sherlock nodded to her. "You know, Harry thinks you've been rooting for us the whole time, even when
"So, Johnny sent this first one in October. Normal then, boring, he sounded kind of depressed. Clara was long gone by then." Sherlock took the notebook paper from her hands. Notebook paper. John used it because he couldn't write in a straight line. The writing was too blocky and structured to be John's normal handwriting (Sherlock had seen it many times), so he wasn't feeling like himself. Feeling like he had to fit his life into the dull picture frame that was civilian life. He felt trapped, sad, and he slept terribly.
"Sorry," the drunk woman giggled. "And hello, Sherlock Holmes. You're really as gorgeous as John said."
John grinned widely and took over, holding out his other hand, the one that wasn't holding Sherlock's. "Boyfriend. Great to meet you." Angelo shook John's hand firmly. John decided he liked this man, and he was glad it was him that was overseeing their first date.
Sherlock burned the last sentence into his mind. After his fall, he figured out he was asking too much for John to forgive him. He'd done something horrible, and then lied about it. John really
"Don't even worry about it. If I have something to hold on to, I can sort of walk." Harry held on tight to Kate's shoulders, and Kate half-dragged her across the store. She was about to lead Harry down the aisle with poisonous chemicals, but turned abruptly into a different aisle, jostling Harry's grip significantly. "What the hell was that for?"
"Hey, Tom?" Clara suddenly said. "There's someone I want you to meet. In the line for checkout, you'll find a pretty woman with her hair in a braid. Her name is Molly." He nodded, but looked pretty confused. "You'll like her, I think you'll hit it off."
asked you to marry me, and participated in a memory reconstruction that just confirmed how much I loved you before this whole thing happened. Through all of that, you don't think I love you? I almost want to strangle you, or punch you in the face, or kiss you senseless."
Harry could feel Sherlock rolling his eyes through the phone. "I had to recreate John's memories, remember? That included the unfortunate circumstances of my suicide." He paused. "I have...a question. If you think you can answer it, that is." The sound of fidgeting came through. "I mean, you don't have any obligation to answer me, it's not
"Don't worry. I'll get you help," the doctor said to the inert body floating next to him, fighting his way through the current. "I'll take care of you."
"I'm sorry, Greg. So very, very, very much sorry that you need the entire pond to hold all the sorry in."
"Being a former cocaine addict, I will do my best," Sherlock replied, a rare smile crossing his face. "Now, you should have some cake. It's your brother's recipe."
"You're hurting, Clarabella. The explanation for that is me," Harry slurred, standing up. Her steps were staggered and uneven, but she knew she had to walk.
Sherlock took the appropriate time before responding, but he didn't want to. He didn't want himself to be right. "You're worried they're right. You're worried they're right about me."
"Thank you, psycho smart guy!" Sherlock gave John a sort of 'help me' glance, but John just grinned. Harry hadn't been this hopeful in months.
After a while, no one knew how long, Sherlock said, "You know, when I wrote the first part of that, I was thinking when I died, it was pointless to include the years on my gravestone that I didn't know him. It made perfect sense, since I hadn't been really living while he wasn't there."
"I know you. I see what's real. You can't fake being such an annoying, lovable dick all the time." John smiled. Why was he smiling? Sherlock was about to take himself away again, how could John just smile like that?
John stared at him blankly for several seconds, long enough to make most people uncomfortable, but not Sherlock. "Explain how you know all of that. It's all correct, by the way."
Everyone stood in absolute silence. No one's heart moved any faster, steady as the wind outside. The scene, if Mycroft could see it, would be as a tableau, never changing.
Mycroft sighed. "After the night Irene Adler died, I contacted Lestrade to keep a close watch on you, and when he said he would, I asked if I could somehow repay him for the number of years he watched over you. Gregory said," Mycroft smiled bitterly, "that if I took him out for coffee, he'd consider the thanks."
Clara glanced at her mobile for a moment, noticing a new text from one of her friends. It said that she wanted to meet at the flat Clara had recently vacated. She wasn't sure why, but it said 12 pm, like when they always met. Clara shrugged and put her phone back into her pocket.
Sherlock bobbed his head up and down. "I do, as a matter of fact, have a first kiss story. There was this man named John, and our relationship was initiated by me. The kiss wasn't, though. He saw I was feeling rejected and see-through just...kissed me. I liked it more than I thought I would. Before then, I didn't understand what kissing what about, why people exchanged saliva whenever it struck their fancies. But I knew in that minute. He was everything in that moment, and I got it." He tried to reorient himself, having lost his place in the story. "There's my story. Another swig?" Sherlock gestured widely with the hand holding the beer.
Sherlock set a cup of tea in front of him. "Do you think we could have been together without the ordeals we went through? All the pretending and all the unhappiness?"
In Harry's really fuzzy mind, since she wasn't exactly awake, she could vaguely hear someone come into the room. Wherever she was. The person was quiet, like keeping her asleep was important. Obviously, Johnny's crazy boyfriend didn't share that opinion!
Harry laughed. "You know, I've always been able to see when people are in love. Always. When John fell for Sherlock, when Sherlock fell for John, when Irene fell for Kate, when John fell for Grace the first time. But with you, I never knew for sure."
Harry was sitting in her new flat, wearing Clara's necklace and not unpacking when her new phone rang. She reached for it, but almost put it back down again when she saw the number on the screen. It used to be hers, but she couldn't look at that phone without thinking too much, so she gave it to Johnny in the hopes her big brother would find a use for it. "Hey Johnny," she said, trying to sound okay.
the detective thought, almost laughing at how ironic and positively insane the situation. And, of course he was scared? How did you explain to a memory-blocked version of your best friend and boyfriend that you wanted to kiss him and touch him and generally make a fool out yourself telling him your feelings without being scared?
The rest of the cab ride went by quickly, and soon the two of them were strolling into a decrepit flat, not well taken care of at all. There were police cars all over the place, but Sherlock neatly maneuvered through them. Inside, officers were walking around with flashlights. A gray-haired man stood out a bit, talking to a darker-skinned woman with corkscrew curly hair. "Lestrade. Where's the space?" Sherlock asked without prelude.
When she woke up again, in the middle of the night, she knew something was up. Harry didn't know how she knew, but she needed to go down the stairs. Peeking through one of the little holes in the door, mostly from acid explosions, Sherlock had told her, she could barely make out the detective guy in just a sheet while her brother sat next to him. "In Buckingham Palace, okay. I'm seriously resisting the urge to steal an ashtray."
"I wanted to see you. How is everything going?" The words Mycroft needed to say buzzed in his ears, but John had to be out of the way for Sherlock to hear them.
John huffed. "Darling, there's nothing I can do about it. Unless I go out and kill a man, which you'd immediately figure out, you're stuck here." Sherlock rolled his eyes. The use of the word 'darling' made him tingly and warm, but it couldn't occupy him for very long.
John opened his eyes when he found lips on his. He hadn't woken up like this since...maybe Grace. His usual conquests left before he could make breakfast, and never woke him up when they went. So who would do this?
John sighed, long and deep. "Did you ever stop to think that maybe I was telling the truth? You said it yourself, I'm a terrible liar. Why would I lie about loving you?"
thing. It scared her; she was supposed to know by now whether the relationship would go anywhere. But she didn't.
He knelt down and pressed an ear to the detective's chest, looking for a heartbeat. However used he was to Sherlock's erratic heartbeat, it didn't prepare him for not hearing one at all. "Damn it, you are not going to leave me like this. It's unfair and awful." John began chest compressions, counting out twenty-five in quick succession before listening for a heartbeat again. Nothing. He opened Sherlock's mouth and kissed him, blowing two great gusts of air into his lungs. Sherlock's heart didn't even flutter.
Sherlock nodded, pressing a gentle kiss to John's forehead. "This person that died. Did you know them?"
John stopped analyzing his supposed symptoms, but was in the position to go back to it. "What, Sherlock?"
"Okay," Clara murmured. Tears were streaking down her face, from the words, and from Harry being so far away.
Harry stood by the entrance to Tesco. Clara's shift was supposed to have ended, but she needed to stay there. The wall she leaned against kept her from falling over. She was tired, beyond tired. Sherlock's little excursion had destroyed a few hours of already sparse sleep, and she destroyed a few more by coming to Tesco, so she was basically done. If she fell asleep there, hopefully someone would pull her over to a couch.
As long as he was up, John decided to make himself a cuppa, since it usually helped any sort of problem. He slipped on one of Sherlock's dressing gowns, not finding one of his own in the dark. (Of course, there was another reason, but John refused to think about it.) When he left their room, he looked around the sitting room and found his sister was gone as well. Where would those two go together?
"I'm sorry," Mycroft whispered. Sherlock didn't answer except for John's name, over and over, all through that night.
"Chicken alfredo sound good?" Harry nodded eagerly, while the detective just waved his hand in an 'I guess it sounds fine' kind of gesture. John knew that was as good as it was going to get, so he started the boiling water.
"Yes. This is completely off the record, but I reattempted the jump from London Bridge and survived, only thanks to your brother. Don't tell anyone I tried it again, please? John wants me to stay out of the papers for once."
"Thank you," Sherlock nodded. He stared at the letter. Printer paper. Slanted writing. New pen, flowing ink. Probably a Pilot G2.07. Sherlock enjoyed those pens. John was
"Ah, in Buckingham Palace, okay." John laughed a bit more, and then said, "I'm seriously resisting the urge to steal an ashtray."
Sherlock picked her up and carried her out of the warehouse, ignoring the drunken statements she shouted. John was holding his head like a migraine had come. "She can sleep on my couch tonight," he told Sherlock.
The doctor left Sherlock's (their) bedroom, and began looking around the sitting room, sliding an invisible key card through a window frame and opening the window. He inspected the outside and inside of the window, a trail of fog coming into the flat. That would be the drug, Sherlock thought.
"Yes, and I killed myself in front of John," Sherlock remarked drily. "You can repair your relationship with my DI, but I
John didn't question this, but Sherlock found it a rather strange request. "Why does she need to go to the market?"
"I like when you hold my hand." Once John finished brushing his teeth, he came into the bedroom again.
"He took it away. I didn't need it anymore." Sherlock shifted his gaze. "But when I...left...I went back to it, but then I told myself he would have hated it, so I quit, for good. I deleted all the names of my dealers, and their contact information. I was quite thorough, but I knew if something came up, I would find it again. But I found you instead, and you are very permanent. You, John, are a different sort of addiction. It seems I can only exchange one addiction for another."
Why would Harry go to Tesco? And since when did Harry even know who Sherlock was, much less meet him?
"Something that has lasted far too long and I'm trying to rid myself of." He would say no more about it, mostly because John was finished with breakfast.
Ever the medical officer, John began to examine Sherlock, making him stick out his tongue and running a flashlight back and forth in front of his eyes. "John, this is unnecessary."
"Alright, I can see your point." The doctor motioned to the couch. "Now, how about you sit down, and I'll get you some chocolate chip pancakes."
When the marriage went south, Clara met with Irene soon after, crying and unable to sleep. The friends with benefits thing became more: a very good friendship with the occasional favor. They made time to go to coffee at least once a week, just talking about anything. Things were bearable for a while, and Irene was (finally) in a healthy relationship with her secret personal assistant, Kate, who also happened to be Clara's manager at Tesco. Weird.
She'd slept around in the upper grades and college; waking up in someone else's bed was nothing she couldn't handle. If people thought she was a cuddler after
Suddenly, as if some listening god had answered his prayer, John noticed a flash of dark hair and green fabric.
The doctor shook his head. That man wasn't here, and this version of Sherlock was perfect the way he was. He also was sleeping, in soft pajamas, right next to John. He grinned. What did John do to deserve him?
"Thanks," John replied. She really didn't seem psychotic, so John didn't mind talking to her. Unlike that other cabbie, the crazy one with the poisonous pills. "You're not the first person to tell me that."
John nodded. It was probable that he would start with the sitting room as Stapleton's lab and Sherlock would have to make the hound noises again. God, this scared Sherlock, seeing John so scared. But it would be over and done with soon enough, and Boyfriend-John would come back.
Said newly-discovered-romantic smiled. "You're welcome. Any friend of John and Harriet's is...most likely a good person." John shot him a look. "John, you could have always married an assassin to fuel your adrenaline addiction. I wouldn't have tolerated that."
John smiled. "Love..." Sherlock winced at the word. That was not Boyfriend-John, he was not allowed to do anything. Nothing like the lovely things coming to mind with Sherlock's eyes on that mouth. "If you don't want to tell me, I'm okay with that. But, I like knowing things about you that also have to do with me. For the record, I honestly have no idea why you keep me around, so that would be nice to know."
" 'I love him and his gorgeous body far too much to leave over a bag of spilled thumbs'? But you were just giving credence to our story!" Sherlock was very confused now.
"You are Moriarty. HE'S MORIARTY!" John yelled behind him to Sherlock. "WE'VE MET, REMEMBER, YOU WERE GOING TO BLOW ME UP!"
The break room was in the very back of the store. Kate shoved the door open with her foot, pulling Harry through with her. A chair, soft and comfortable, stood in the corner. Harry nearly melted just looking at it. "Now, stop that," the manager said, struggling to keep the exhausted woman on her feet.
"No, thank you, John. I'll be back soon." Sherlock rushed out the door of 221B, shutting it loudly behind him. John had no idea what all of this was about, so he went downstairs to see the landlady.
A knock sounded on their front door. "Hey, are y'all having a party without me?" Harriet called, poking her head into the flat.
"That was marvelous," Harry said after successfully inhaling her pancakes. "My hangover feels slightly better. Johnny, I need to go to the market."
Sherlock's face rapidly turned a cross between disappointed and resigned. "Baby, finish those pancakes, and then please come over here."
"Stop it, stop it now!" Sherlock shouted. Jim made a break for it, skidding up the stairs and shutting a door, later escaping through a window. Sherlock ran his hands through his already very mussed hair and paced a couple lengths, leaving the flat and running out onto the street.
"First swig." John clinked his bottle against Sherlock's own, Sherlock immediately alert. This game had some very intriguing potential. If John got drunk first, which had a great chance of happening, he could get out of him whether or not John had fallen in love with him. It had been weighing on his mind recently, since John
"Who was your first love?" Sherlock asked suddenly, voice sounding more lucid than it had since the game started.
John and Sherlock dug into their meals, staying silent for a little while. The doctor was absolutely bursting with the strange things Angelo had said in the restaurant, but he didn't want to interrupt Sherlock eating, which didn't happen nearly enough as he would have liked. When Sherlock was three-fourths of the way finished with his chicken alfredo, John opened his mouth to ask about it, but the genius spoke first.
"I'm a-" Sherlock broke off. "I'm a f-" John could sort of feel Sherlock shake his head into the phone. "Damn it all, I can't say it again. I can't. I'm sorry."
"No, you go first," John replied, reaching across the small table to put a hand on the detective's shoulder. He looked Sherlock calmly in the face, knowing that calmness generally helped things like this.
After Sherlock had cooled down a little and John had almost succeeded in schooling his expression into something vaguely appropriate, the food arrived. "Here you are, men," Angelo said. "Enjoy." He winked at John before heading back into the kitchen. Sherlock cocked an eyebrow at him, but John wouldn't explain that.
was welcome to lighten up his mood. He'd not expected that the brunet's trip to the bank would be to get involved in a case of theft, smuggling and murder and, sad as it was for young Soo Lin Yao, John could only say that it'd been brilliant.
The blond shook his head. “No. And I hope I never will accidentally. Such a long life.. People think it's fun, but the truth is, the older you get, the more sad and depressing life gets. I've lived through generations and, what can I say, people never learn.. You're the most excitement I've had in a hundred years.” he acknowledged, giving a tiny smile.
“I told myself I could forgive her because otherwise I would have had to admit the true order of importance to me, which, inevitably, would have meant proving myself wrong.”
John nodded. “Yes. Because our blood is free of anything that is immune system, it is a lot thinner and moves faster through the body. It's not quite clear how or what it is, but something about the right balance between human and vampire blood is capable of any healing process in record time. It can even cure cancer.” the doctor explained.
He drank slowly, taking his time and being extra neat with giving as little of his saliva into Sherlock's bloodstream. Sucking at the flesh, Sherlock moaned a little and his arms circled his head and shoulders without causing the wound to shift away from John's mouth. John, likewise, slung an arm around Sherlock's waist, grabbing the one he was drinking from with his free hand and supporting it gently.
“Not yet.” came the simple reply, followed by a companionable quiet that was very customary to them.
“That wasn't my intention. I wanted to keep seeing you, but now you have shown we cannot just go without desiring each other.” There was a pause that sounded like John was trying to collect his strength. “This pains me greatly. However, I fear you are right: I must abandon you.”
It drew closer to him. He remained boneless. A hand, cold and wet touched his wrist and he grabbed it, attempting to take advantage of this blunt approach, but the moment he had drawn his first deep breath, his grip weakened and he coughed violently against the water in his lungs.
Mrs. Hudson was the one who had him worried a bit. She fussed about all day long, cleaning this and cleaning that, resuming from baking or cooking too much to not waste what they had, but nevertheless trying to act like nothing was the matter, like there wasn't a couple of millions of dead people playing alive in front of their door.
Sherlock broke away. “Oh!” he exclaimed, looking as if the entire world had just gotten a meaning to him. “John! Fantastic! As ever my unrivalled conductor of light! I am indeed high, just not on drugs! I've felt it the first time you bit me, too. A sudden rush of luck and happiness. John you're making me high on endorphins! I saw it in my blood samples when I analysed them after you'd bitten me that day. That's been making me feel so ecstatic.” the brunet eagerly explained.
This gained a reaction from Holmes, who, as his mind emerged from its deep state of meditation, answered with a low hum before registering the entirety of the situation. At first he was mildly shocked by Watson's face being so close to his own, then he mirrored his smile and happily shared a kiss. “Have you asked Mrs Hudson to bring supper tonight?” he asked as soon as there came space between them again. His hand glid along the side of Watson's clothed arm.
John did what he did, warning him about the pinches of the needle where he injected some numbing Sherlock watched best he could from his angle and when John was done, wound dressed and all to protect from scratching, pulling and chafing, he squeezed Sherlock's arm before bringing his kit back into the bathroom. He came back with Sherlock favourite ragged shirt. The one he mostly wore for sleeping and sulking.
“My disinterest in sexual activities is by no means to influence your habits of masturbation, John. Just make sure there is nothing left in the shower when you're done.” Answered Sherlock reasuringly and with just a tiny bit of a sassy tone to it.
Sherlock nodded and stretched out his hand, intending to shake John's on the deal. The merman took it and guided it to his lips. He pushed back from the rocks until he could sink back into the water. A few feet he travelled backwards, his eyes on Sherlock, before he dipped back and disappeared.
John shook his head with a sigh. It was the same question each time. “Please, Mycroft, I'm just a simple doctor. I just want to live.”
A delighted gasp came from Hamish before he answered. “Oui, papa! Je vais en recevoir un pour Noël?!”
Mycroft frowned, deeply displeased. “Attacked under my flag? I assure you I never gave such orders. I will send word immediately.” his brother promised, but halted before retreating to his studies. “How did you come back?”
For a moment, John and Sherlock watched Hamish's intelligent eyes as he processed this information. “What about the other children then? Are they still there?”
“You know what he is to me. My god, Mary, you have seen it all, can you not understand it? Do we really need this drama?”
“And yet here I am.” John shook his head. “I'm not saying I believe in it. But I'd rather not risk anything.”
Sherlock stayed quiet for a little more until raising his eyes from the undefined spot on the table to John's large blue ones, shaped by the bow of his frown. “I just wanted to thank you.”
But like all birds on land, she had her times of anger, an irrational force that drove winds to his sails too strong to tame. He was unlucky with her temper.
Most of the time, however, Sherlock had his ear pressed to John's heart when they lay on the beach. Sometimes, John fell asleep. Sometimes he woke up as Sherlock kissed his chest.
He let go of his shirt and took hesitant steps towards the leather couch. Usually, he would flop down onto it in a big sulk, but he was painfully aware of his wound in that moment.
“I pose no threat to your brother and I never intended to do so. If I did, he'd be long dead.” John stood his ground. He was aware that Mycroft had the power to have him killed just for being who he was, if only he wished to. He also knew, that trying to soft-soap Mycroft would be exactly what could get him killed.
The ex-soldier trusted his hearing mostly, listening to their shuffling, groaning, stomping and breathing. They dropped the bags silently. He rounded a corner, knife lifted to suspected head-level and hit home, taking down a Constable with gunshot wounds in his chest. Taking off the man's shoe, hiding behind a chair, he tossed the boot right across the room, the three remaining corpses stopping their aimless tracks to inspect the noise. He motioned for Sherlock to take the opportunity and take one down as well. Going in with close to no risk was good enough for him to have Sherlock make a move. Unfortunately the third one was alerted by the thumping of a body hitting the floor behind him, so John let his one drop, instead of bringing her down noiselessly, kicked the interested body hard and stabbed its head when it had stumbled to the ground.
Sherlock watched him with great interest. When John's head sank back against the cushions, the brunet cupped the back of it with his free hand, lowering it slowly, making sure the contact to his wrist didn't break.
They continued in silence for a while before Sherlock spoke again. “Why do you save humans? Why do you otherwise stay hidden?”
“Well, no offence, but you're not what one would consider a 'family person'.” Mary answered, crossing her arms over her baby bump.
Sherlock seemed to consider John for a moment, but apparently settled on the fact that that was precisely who he was; John. He took the paper towel and John grabbed a cloth, dampened it under the sink and knelt to clean the floor before Sherlock. It was just John. John with a surprising new skill. “Don't be alarmed. They are there to pierce human skin and create a controllable flow of blood to drink. I have never done that, however.” he got up again and simply tossed the cloth into sink with abandon. Looking up, he saw Sherlock still clasping the paper towel to his chin, although his expression was calmer now, still irritated, but calmer. “I'd say 'I'm sorry I never told you', but I'm not, so I won't. Please, I have an early shift tomorrow. Let's just sleep on this, calm down, it's been a turbulent day, and talk about this tomorrow, okay?”
“No, I did not.” John turned to pick up the boiling kettle and pour hot water into two mugs with tea bags in them.
Sherlock took a quick look at John, clearly determining whether John wanted to eat. “Yes, you can bring it up!” he shouted, climbing off the bed again to take the food off their landlady.
As soon as he had John resting against the headboard, face pinched up in pain, he thrust his arm at him pressing it against John's lips. “Bite me!” John protested with a low growl, trying to turn his head away. “Come on, John, you need to drink!”
“Transphobia isn't that uncommon, John, you can't blame me for being.. cautious.” His voice wasn't accusing. He sought understanding.
I laid on a pitying smile for him. It had so often aided me in throwing him off a scent, though I could not claim this to be as noble a time as some others had been. “Oh, Watson, you are making a big matter out of a little thing. There is no larger meaning to it. I must readily confess, that I am not without fault myself. I am often not in the best of habits and my character is rotten in many places–“
That was when John came back into the room, his own shirt open over the white vest he wore. He had apparently checked for bruising where he'd earlier held his ribs.
“No, I just left my wife and child in hopes of one day shagging my best friend, nothing wrong with that at all.” John reprised in an exasperated sarcastic tone. Though he knew it shouldn't, the remark made Sherlock flinch with disappointment and a certain fear. John threw him a quick look, then shook his head in resignation. “No, no, Sherlock, I didn't mean it that way. I'm sorry, that was awful.”
They rode the cab back home in silence, but it wasn't the usual, easy silence, which spoke for itself. This was tense and John's body language suggested he was in army doctor mode; quite nervously so. He was tense and his leg restless, one hand drumming a silent rhythm on his knee.
With a pang in his chest, he felt very guilty for what had happened the previous night. He hadn't planned it, of course, and neither had he intended to, but he now felt like he'd used the younger man. He reckoned it'd been simply because he had felt so lonely, still did, and if he was honest, he wasn't quite used to living in celibacy. It had been a slip. The kissing was just a bit of romance he liked. Sherlock surely understood. No, he was Sherlock, how would he understand.. Surely he didn't think anything of it. Anyway, he had made it more than clear that he wasn't interested in that sort of interaction and his reaction to John's advances had confirmed that.
Unfortunately, excitement never came alone. The annoying reality was, that in between cases, John had nothing to do other than going out to Tesco to avoid going mad inside the flat, where his overly-bored flatmate was doing his best to drag John down into the dark abyss with him. His limb and shaking hand had previously made him made both physically and mentally unfit to work as a surgeon and while his hand still denied him the full potential of his abilities, the rest of him was ready to get a job. His bank account was also ready for him to get a job.
He pushed the thoughts away and brought John his coffee, who thanked him, naturally. “Let me know when you're ready to go. I'll be in the kitchen.”
As the effect of the drugs got weaker, John began moaning in pain. Sherlock all but carried him upstairs. He couldn't get John up to the second floor and leaving him on the sofa would be unwise in more than one way, so he took him back into his own bedroom. His bed was big and comfortable and within easy reach of everything. He'd be able to take care of John there.
John erupted an embarrassed chuckle, before his eyes fell on his watch. “Oh, crap, I forgot I'm supposed to take the early shift today! I have to go, sorry.” he explained hastily, grabbing his coat and shoes and dashing out the door only to come back in a second later. “Anything for dinner?”
For a brief second, there was a tinge of disappointment in Sherlock's eyes, but, as always, it didn't hold on for long. “Alright. See you later.” he replied, leaning down to peck John's cheek while pulling his gloves on.
John's jaw clenched. “Sorry to be such a disappointment.” he commented. It was that tone of voice that should tell anyone to take a step back. It's not the loud, shout-y people one should be afraid of, but the calm, repressed ones. John was one of the latter.
“Of course, that would explain your general incompetence with modern technology.” Sherlock remarked, taking on tea from him to put some sugar in it.
Sherlock opened his eyes again, observed the daring look of eyes much deeper than the sea and cocked up one eyebrow. “You would not dare.”
The merman looked, too, for a moment and adverted his eyes. “I have lost my life as my family died from fishermen's careless hunt. I was lucky the harpoon had missed in this way, but am I truly lucky? I have no one left. You have family, however. I found your hat swimming in the same way as us. I imagine that is your father's name?”
John was sitting in front of a startled Sherlock, who, after fully coming back to reality, drew his eyebrows together in question.
“How considerate of you.” John said, knowing full well Sherlock would understand the sarcasm – he'd gotten better at it. “No, Hamish, your father and I cannot make a baby.” John began, while he set to get the last of their breakfast ready. “A baby can only be made by a man and a woman. We're both men, neither of us could conceive the child.”
"And I am. Look at us both." Both Mycroft and John had the saddest looks in their eyes, but both would deny it. Mycroft knew his brother was self-destructive, and would hurt him and John if he left. But John's mind was a little harder to read.
Harry yanked the phone out of Clara's hand. "What the hell do you mean? Johnny loves you no matter what crazy-ass things you do!"
"She obviously doesn't. This is her flat, which she so conveniently was kidnapped from. The question is why."
His brother seemed to be struggling with how to word this so the good doctor would understand, but more importantly, stop the disappointment. Whenever John was unhappy, Sherlock tried to fix it. He didn't like seeing John unhappy, and Mycroft didn't logically understand that. Why would feelings have to matter in this situation?
"Darling," Sherlock winced briefly at the endearment, "I wanted it, too. I wanted you, and you wanted me. That's how it works, sometimes." John brushed one of the detective's stray curls away from his face. "You wouldn't be the only one at fault, if there was any fault to place. It was both of our choices to make love, and it will always be both of our choices." He pecked Sherlock's forehead. "If this was a one-time occurrence, that's alright, whatever you're comfortable with, but if not..." John leaned down to softly kiss the detective, this time on the lips. "I want to show you
The detective laughed, but it was wrong, bitter and sad and doomed. "This will be the third time I've fatally fallen. The first time was the day after we met, that case at Lauriston Gardens, that day you said 'Oh god yes' and tumbled into my life with a cane and a gun and your insistence I was really brilliant. You don't know what you did to me, but since we have time, I'll tell you." He paused, and John couldn't speak. "You changed everything. John Watson, it was like a bomb went off in my mind palace. Lights lined the darkest places. Do you know that you are the first person important enough for me to have one whole room in my palace for you? I guess now you do. Every time I thought of you after that was one more thing added to my amazement.
"I won't." The two swayed back and forth slightly, neither willing to move from the incredibly comforting position.
one, and not know who they really were. He didn't understand that, and he detested not understanding.
What the hell? "So, wait. You were using my brother to get over my brother?" Sherlock nodded. "That man last night, the one you kissed, he didn't know about any of this?"
Clara sighed deeply, walking to the door. Putting her hand on the handle, she turned it and opened the door.
John broke the kiss, staring at the detective. When had this happened? John didn't even remember coming into Sherlock's room, much less in the middle of the night, much less to
Harry groaned again, but when she saw Sherlock, she laughed. "Oh, so you and the hot detective got some action last night?"
That wasn't the last time. Exactly seventeen times after that, Irene called her, and she came. The Woman told Harry once or twice that she was much more interesting than her brother. When Irene had met John, Harry didn't know, but if it got her amazing sex, she could afford to look the other way.
Sherlock stood awkwardly in the doorway to Harriet's flat, waiting to be let in. This was John's sister, and he was loathe to upset her. "Geez, Sherly, come on in. The letters are over here." He stepped cautiously in, making sure not to disturb anything that could be evidence. Something was wrong, and had been since everyone he knew forgot the last two years.
to get himself into it. "I assure you," Sherlock replied, voice becoming hoarser, "my playing is unrivaled by most, including my brother."
His voice was almost too much. Sherlock swayed on the dangerous precipice but steadied himself quickly. "John."
Sherlock and John looked at each other for an uncountable amount of minutes, Sherlock cataloguing the details and burning them into a new room of his mind palace so he would never forget, and John reading the lines and slopes of his face like they were a never-ending mystery novel. Both men drank the other in as if they needed this to live. And Sherlock did need it, but John didn't know he did too, yet. Just yet.
"Neither will his desire for me to jump off that roof again, correctly this time!" Sherlock had begun to get up off the floor.
with the ones as powerful as Moriarty. You either fought them, or made a deal with them. Had his brother learned nothing?
Sherlock knew it wouldn't last. John didn't love him before, probably didn't now, he just was lonely. But Sherlock also knew that if John was taken from him again...He'd die, really and provably. He was convinced his heart would stop beating, be torn out like it was in the nightmare, if John left.
seems to remember, I was here the whole time. That cannot be a coincidence. The universe is rarely so lazy."
"You should really rest, Harry," Kate told her in the mom voice she used sometimes. "I'll walk you to your car."
"I said," Gregory moved closer to Mycroft, placing his hands on the intoxicated man's shoulders, "that even if you gave up on me, I would never give up on you."
"People will always talk, John." He could visualize the smiling doctor, because John had few other expressions. Ugh, did they not feel the danger still surrounding them? A different device still heard the breathing of Moriarty and several other people, possibly snipers. Mycroft wanted to shake them, but he was too far away.
"You don't have to," Clara soothed, glaring a little at her wife. "Just talk to him. John is understanding by nature. It'll be fine."
John laughed lightly. "I'll determine for myself what the right thing to do is, and currently it is this." He paused before moving forward completely, and kissed Sherlock.
John stared at Sherlock for a few minutes. Sherlock wasn't going to say anything else, because he honestly believed John would leave him. He
Sherlock looked at John fondly. How had John managed to wrap him around his little finger? "That sounds lovely." He paused. "As long as you hold me the whole time."
"Goodbye, John." There were tears running down his brother's face, and Mycroft began making the preparations to save Sherlock's life without his brother's permission. The world needed him, he couldn't just throw himself off of St. Bart's.
Alright, that was not good right now. "Has your opinion changed?" John asked quietly, ignoring what had just happened, whatever it had been.
Harry looked down. Clara thought she could see a small teardrop fall from her eyes. "When I started drinking, I didn't think it would ever get that bad. But it was a fucking downward spiral and I couldn't control it. Everything got worse and worse, and you were so unhappy, and I couldn't look myself in the mirror knowing I'd done that to you. Clara, I left because I loved you, and I didn't want to hurt you anymore." Her tone got more and more hysterical and sad and teary as she spoke.
Sherlock looked the man up and down. "Oh, Lestrade. Your wife finally left you for the PE teacher, didn't she?"
"But if there wasn't?" Sherlock smirked darkly. "I refused to live without you a long time ago, and if you didn't save me, I figured I didn't need to be saved."
"I'll get the pudding," Sherlock added. "Feel free to sit in my chair, Mrs. Hudson." Harriet would be back soon, and then she could sit in John's chair and himself and John could sit on the couch. The perfect arrangement.
And oh, was that the most incorrect thing to say to Sherlock Holmes at that precise moment. "No, you're not," he managed to get out without screaming that
"Gregory. My brother and Dr. Watson are in the pool room of a high school at this address." He gave the address. "A criminal mastermind currently occupies the same space, so I suggest you get your best officers and go now."
"The ring? That would be correct. I needed to do this the right way." John kneeled in front of the chair his boyfriend was sitting in, putting on hand on his knee, and holding the hand the ring was in out to him. "Now will you marry me? Because I love you, and I sometimes feel like I've known you forever, and we are the best as a team, and mostly I love you." John fiddled with the wedding band, waiting for an answer. "Please."
Her hair was mussed, eyes closed, and she looked like she was sleeping soundly. Clara smiled a little when she remembered how Harry slept like the dead. Someone, most likely Kate, had put a blanket over her. She stared a few minutes longer, just rememorizing her ex-wife's (?) face, and then went back into the main portion of the store. Kate had to be around here somewhere.
"Does a man need a reason to kiss the hell out of his amazing," kiss, "genius," another kiss, "sexy as fuck," loooonnngg kiss, "boyfriend?" John looked at him with sparkling hazel eyes. "Because, I don't think so. Do you?"
"Finally admitting it, are we?" Angelo beamed. "Someone recently vacated that table over that way. I'll be back with menus." He strolled away happily, but John was confused, and Sherlock went white. They both attempted to ignore that as they walked over to the table Angelo had pointed out. They soon settled there, still neither one of them letting go of the other's hand. It's like a pact, John thought, like a promise I'll stay with him. It is like a string connecting us, Sherlock thought, like one of the almost-telephones that are made with yarn and two plastic cups, like I can always reach him.
"Catch. You. Later." Sherlock didn't put down the gun until Moriarty was really gone, and the snipers had moved their red dots away from the two of them.
“They were sailing under English flag. I will go speak to Mycroft immediately after. I wanted to know you are well.” he assured and explained.
Sherlock packed, as instructed, mostly their food, giving up his expensive wardrobe to take just the most necessary, which was the outfit he was wearing and three sets of spare clothes – his favourite shirt, the purple one, included.
John's tongue continued to dab at and lap over the little holes even as his jaw went slack around the wrist, coating it in moist warmth. Sherlock felt his heart beat picking up again and a strange euphoria crawled up his back. He was weirdly disappointed when John pulled his head away, licking his lips habitually and sighing a little when he tasted the blood still on them.
When he came to, it was just as well: they had been plundered, every last one of them. Even his hat they took. He was about to move when he heard a noise. They must still be around. He played dead. His pride was great, but if he could take one treasure out of this, it was his life.
