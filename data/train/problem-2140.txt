When he sees Sherlock, slouched in his chair, the room dark but for the flicker of the fire in the grate, a feeling shimmers through John. It burns like laughter in his chest, throbs like an ache in his throat, tingles, that rush of blood to cut-off limbs, all over. That singular Sherlock feeling that John has never experienced with anyone else: of coming truly, spectacularly alive.
John wants to stay here, or better, take them back to the hotel and peel Sherlock out of his tux. He wants to lavish attention on every inch of his body, wants to explore, take his time. Now that Sherlock has proven to himself that John isn’t just feeding him lines, that John truly believes what he says, the barrier of doubt between them has fallen. It makes John reel a bit, thinking what sex will be like now that it’s gone. He’s never gotten to this point with any of his other boys before. Societal conditioning or some internal insecurity had always blocked true intimacy. To have the opportunity to finally share it with someone right at his fingertips is tantalising and maddening because he can’t miss the gala. He’s the guest being honoured, after all, and all the money raised will go to the charity wing of his company which distributes medications throughout Africa. Then there’s tomorrow’s early morning meeting with Irene and then the plane flight home right after. There simply isn’t enough time for everything that John wants.
She chuckled and patted the back of his neck, "/Oh, you, you’re just happy we made your favorite recipe./"
Mycroft blanches at the seriousness coming from the seven-year-old. It is quite... scary. He swallows hard but then smiles. His baby brother is already turning into a strong young man, with his faithful best friend at his side.
The Fawn froze, ears perking slightly as he turned to face John, not only was this creature intriguing and new, it also thought nightly if him, Fawnlock seemed to preen at the compliment. His gaze locked with the human's, "Really, you think so?" He asked, eyes slightly wide. Most of the creatures of the forest saw him as being odd, his tendencies, his appearance, his behavior and interests were all bizarre to them. They still held a high respect for him though, he did protect them and the wood, but tended they to avoid him. And humans, well, they were rare, and the few he'd encountered hadn't been very friendly, "That's not what humans usually say." He muttered, ears dropping slightly.
After a minute or two, he turned the violin the right side up and blew gently into the hollow, flushing out any remaining spiders before he moved to find his bow.
John let Fawnlock keep his arm captive, leaning down to press kisses to every individual curl he could manage. Fawnlock's ears flicked, the rumbling growing louder under the rain of soft affectionate, kisses from his mate.
John closed his hand around Fawnlock's fingers, shaking it gently and feeling the soft pad of the guardian's hand against his palm. He smiled and rubbed his thumb over the back of Fawnlock's hand, tracing over the knuckles curiously before the other took his limb back, glancing up to the sky. John, preoccupied with staring at his fingers and the ghost of the hand still in their grasp, took a moment to register what was said. Suddenly, his eyes snapped up to the sky and he groaned. "Christ, it's that late already? I better head back, or I'll get lost." He frowned, hesitating. He really didn't want to go, unsure if he'd ever see this creature again.
He then returned to Fawnlock and had him hold still as he gently worked the collar around each antler, pulling it off points when it snagged once he'd finally got it down to tug down Fawnlock's head, he tapped each shoulder the hand him lift his arms up so John could pull it the rest of the way on, the stepped back and admired his handiwork.
The rugby player's eyes widen slightly, he'd know Mycroft came from a family with money, but a butler. Greg's cheeks flush slightly as he realizes he's been quiet for several minutes,  "W-wow, you must really love your brother, he seems like a real handful." The teen offered a chuckle to cover for his prolonged silence.
The fawn blinked as his brother spoke of his contentment, his bottom lip jutted out in a slight pout as he looked down at his dark hands splayed on the tabletop. The Fae had never considered his happiness, he just was, though he supposed he had been definitely enjoying his time with John. Fawnlock bit his lip, suppressing a surly embarrassingly large smile at his realization.
Only then did he coax Fawnlock up slowly, helping him climb out of the tub and then finding a large, fluffy cotton towel to wrap around him, gently drying his fur and hair to not aggravate his wounds, then wrap the whole thing around him in a bundle. The fawn climbed out with John's help, bleating softly with a smile on his lips as John dried him off. He chuckled softly, tail swishing as his mate bundled him up, the fawn letting an appreciative gaze fall on John as he patted himself dry.
Greg chuckles softly as he leans against the desk, hands in the pockets of his jacket, "Not a problem, John." He looks up when Mycroft approaches, swallowing nervously.
A smile twitched across the fawn's lips as his ears perked, "Thank you John." He murmured softly, burying his nose into the fabric around human's neck. He snuggled into John, reveling in the other's warmth and company. Something he'd never done before. He huffed softly, wrapping his arms around the human, snuffling softly. "You're always welcome in this wood John, even if you have to leave, whatever reason... You can always come back... This is your home too, you are my herd." He spoke quietly though loud enough for John to hear through the fabric his face was buried into.
"I'm your mate. And you are mine. Forever." He stared into the fawn's silvery eyes, shifting one hand down to lay over Fawnlock's heart. He felt it beat beneath his fingertips, then dragged downwards till his hand curled over the fawn's hip. Dipping his head, he kissed the same spot on Fawnlock's chest that his hand had covered, stilling so he could feel the pulse against his lips. After a moment, he pulled himself back completely, stroking the fawn's hip.
"Yeah. That'd be great!" John smiles and holds out his hand to Sherlock, they were far enough away from the others that they wouldn't notice.  He just needs to be close to his best and only friend.
He changed out the usual earl grey for chamomile though, to help relax the fae and make it easier for him to fall asleep. Rooting through his cupboard, he found a box of Tim Tams and took a few biscuits out and set them on a plate with the tea, since taking all the medicine on an empty stomach wouldn't be wise. He brought the tray over and set it on the table beside Fawnlock, lifting the tea up and offering the cup to his mate, then sitting down in front of him and rubbing soothing circles on his knee.
John watched his mate speak, accepting his hand and tangling their fingers together. He was bolder and snappish and far more petulant with his brother than he ever was with John.
Sherlock trots back into his room after brushing his teeth and sits on the edge of his bed, kicking his feet a bit, waiting for John to come out too.
"Mhm," John chuckles, pulling Sherlock toward the fence, listening as he goes on about what they'll do when they go to his for dinner.
The fawn's ears flicked as he turned his hand so his palm was flush with John's. He intertwined their fingers, both sets still sainted with berry juice.
Fawnlock flushed at John's praising and captivating words, his ears flicked as John knelt to his level. John's words warmed the Fae, and a small smile curled his lips, the fawn bleating at the kiss to his cheek. He'd always trust John, and he'd always make sure John could trust him, he'd never take advantage of his mate's promises.
The taller boy smiles, fingers running over the smooth surface of the medallion save the Jolly Roger carved into the front. He gives John a grin, squeezing his fingers, "You really are the best first mate ever." John blushes and smiles, looking down, at his feet.
"I'll be here waiting, love." He reached up and adjusted the scarf around his mate's neck, then touched their noses together for a brief moment. "Come on then. The sooner you leave, the sooner I'll have you back." He helped Fawnlock to his feet, then walked him to the door of the cottage.
John blinked as they dropped back into discussing this 'Mousey' who had apparently had harbored a crush on Fawnlock. Until the fae had snapped at her and sent her running scared.
Finally the young Fae's eyes fluttered shut and he tail started to twitch lazily as his mind started to slow down. Fawnlock breath evened out, and he was lulled to sleep by the comfort if his mate's scent and slow, deep breathing. Soon the fawn had fallen into a deep slumber atop his mate, making small, soft noises of contentment as he slept.
"You're gorgeous like this John," murmured the Fae, "all flushed and pupils blown, wanting my fingers around you. Breath all heavy and warm, you're so beautiful."
The owl was kind enough to keep a slow pace, allowing John to navigate through the brush after it, cautious of where he stepped as he all the wound his way to the cottage. Remembering Fawnlock's words about her being a kind older Fae who had lived among humans before, John took the time to gather wildflowers for her in a bouquet. When he finally arrived, he glanced up, noticing all the owls gathered around the cottage, in the trees and huddled on the roof. John stared at them, eyes darting back and forth at the various species until finally he thought he'd counted them all. Finally, working up the nerve, he reached out and knocked on the door to the cabin, putting on a polite smile. He really had no idea what to expect, other than if she was a friend of Fawnlock's, she'd be wonderful.
"It is, but in the end, after all that which they've gone through he builds up the courage to confess and learns they feel the same. You may never know what you do not know until you ask is the lesson to be had.  To find the courage to pursue your desires..."  Mycroft swallows thickly, staring at Greg as he realizes what he is doing and blushes, looking down at the book, fingers gripping the book.
Fawnlock bleated softly, ears twitching and snuggled closer to John, explaining softly; "Fae children are fast learners and the language comes easily to them, plus our accents are very clear because it's all we know at the time.” The fawn nuzzled at his mate's jaw, snuffling softly, "But don't worry I'll help you," a small smile curled at the corners of the young Fae's lips.
"I don't know Sherly, but it isn't good." He answers as he sits beside Sherlock, placing an arm around him. "We might have to watch her closely and be more patient with her. I know you're not very patient, but can you for mummy?"
”You are more than welcome love. You'll have to tell me all the things you like to eat so I can go out of my way to spoil you with them." Because John was quickly finding that spoiling this lovely creature was most definitely the way he preferred to spend his time.
Fawnlock watched John's tongue peek out from his lips several times, his tail flicking, the human had quirks, ones that made the fawn want to nuzzle close to him in appreciation, though he knew better, John was a human after all, he wasn't very familiar with human customs. The fawn's ears perked slightly, a smile gracing his lips, John had called him fascinating, no one'd ever called him that. He nodded after the human, watching him for several moments, the human seem particularly ordinary, yet, even with being a human, he was very much a mystery to the fawn and thus was intriguing. A puzzle or riddle to be solved perhaps. Fawnlock carefully sat down on a small carpet on the floor, folding his legs beneath himself, then looked down to the book John'd handed him. He set his tea next to him, careful not to spill it, then flipped open the tome, settling it in his lap, his eyes flicked over the page as his ears twitched with his concentration. His tongue poked out as he tried to read a particularly hard sentence, with a large word he didn't understand. Moosecroft hadn't taught him all human words, just common and interesting ones, so he tried to understand the best he could.
"John, this is Winston, Winston this my friend John." Sherlock introduces them and the man smiles, happy to see Sherlock made a friend. Sherlock picks up his spoon and scopes a spoonful of chowder into his mouth. He smiles and tells Winston it's really yummy, as always. The butler just chuckles with a thank you before leaving to clean up.
"That was quite some time ago, I may still have that recipe." She flitted about the kitchen, "You're such a sweetheart, John, that's sure to make him feel nice and bushy-tailed." She hummed softly, searching through the cookbooks and recipe cards, "Aha, think I've got it, right here." She flipped a card out if a card box and nodded, "Mhm, this this one, here you go dear." She turns and hands him the card with a soft smile.
Fawnlock obediently raised his arms and move for John as he helped get the jumper off the Fae. He snuffled into John's neck as he brought the couple closer, their chests flush against one another. His specked fingers tapped up and down his mate's sides idly, sweeping over his ribs with warm fingertips, the fawn's tail swished slightly as he murmured softly in his native tongue. Fawnlock nosed at the soft skin under John's ear, before he nipped his earlobe, his ears twitching at the beautiful sounds his mate made.
He stared at the paper, at the pair of their names, and then looked up suddenly, blurting out his thoughts. "You fae...do you take bits of each other's names? When you become mates? Or something of the sort?"
Fawnlock ate another vegetable, thinking while he ate, the food the human had made was delicious, and the human seemed kind enough. The Fawn knew he wanted to spent more time with John, investigating,learning more about humans. The Fawn's ears dropped as he realized that if he neglected the wood Moosecroft would come or if he caught wind of him spending time with a human. He'd have to be sneaky, the fawn smirked a little. In his deep thought he hadn't noticed that John had been watching, but at that moment he did. His pale gaze met John's, his head tilted slightly as he examined the human for a moment or two, "John, I may be mistaken, but isn't staring considered rude?" The Fawn asked, though his smirk still remained, though it'd turned a bit soft.
"John," he murmurs hotly, half-lidded gaze looking down at his flushed mate, "Do you like playing dirty with me John?" He asks, leaning down once more to press damp kisses down John's throat, nipping lightly at his mate's heated skin. His fingers tug at John's jumper, ridding it up to the fawn could stroke his love's belly and the skin of his hips, hot breath puffing against John's neck.
Harry continues pounding on the door screaming for several minutes, but after at least twenty minutes it goes quiet and staggering footsteps sound off as Harry stumbles away.
As Fawnlock squeezed his fingers, he leaned in and kissed his mate's cheek, then pulled back and dug out his keys to unlock the door and let them inside.
The fawn nuzzled close, snuggling under the duvets. He started to drift, he fell asleep soundly, nuzzling against his mate in his sleep.
They have no time to chat anyway as Greg has them dodging cars and trucks pulling out of the lot, rounding the buses, guiding Mycroft along with him until they reach his slightly beat up Impala. The rugby player nervously fiddles with his keys, finally unlocking Mycroft's door and then his own.
"Special am I? Is that the word for it?" John teased, holding Fawnlock against him in a constant hug. He liked his mate like this, playful and sharp witted. It didn't suit him to worry, to wrinkle that velvety smooth brow. His fingers gently pet across his mate's taut stomach, basking in the attention they lavished upon one another.
He would have happily carried him, but the bath was upstairs and he wasn't sure he could manage the narrow steps with a wiggly fawn in his arms. He did hold his hand as he led Fawnlock to the second floor, into the loo. It was the only room on the floor besides the bedroom, so it was fairly large for a cabin's bathroom, sporting a large porcelain tub. He let the fawn explore and he turned on the taps and plugged up the drain, letting the basin fill with hot, steamy water.
"Best friend?" He is shocked. No one had ever called him that. "Yeah. That's what they do I suppose." He gives a choked laugh and hugs Sherlock. "You're my best friend too Sherlock!"
"I missed you too, John." He pressed his lips to the soft skin under John's ear in a light kiss. He pulled away from the hug to snuffle at John's neck and jumper, the scents telling him several things. The scent of his den comforted him slightly, though he found John's scent to be even more soothing.
"Sorry, Johnn- John." Harry apologizes after a moment, looking to the side. "Make sure you're home by eight," Harry tells John and turns on her heel, walking away to look for the pretty brunette name Lisa she'd been talking to.
"I love you John, you are my mate. I will always try my best to be right by your side whenever you need me, no matter what it is you need me for." His chest rumbled softly as he spoke, vibrating his and John's pressed together bodies lightly.
Sherlock cocks his head, staring at John a bit before moving to wrap John in an awkward hug, "John, it's just a dream." He assures John.
"I will never...never be afraid of you. I love you." He turned and stepped out of the nest, already moving to pull his jumper up overhead.
John glanced up as the hands lifted into his hair, sighing softly as fingers combed through and touched his scalp. His eyes almost drifted shut, but at the fawn's question, they snapped back open. He wasn't embarrassed, not really. They'd done a bit together after all, and both of them seemed to enjoy it very much.
"We should get cleaned up for dinner." Mycroft announces as he gets to his feet. He goes over to where Sherlock is reading and leans over his shoulder.
"Our bond is different, yes. But is very strong and resilient, Moosecroft." The young Fae huffed softly.
"Oh you little minx...I'll get you for that." He sent another, smaller pillow sailing over at the fawn's head, then dove to tackle him, gently of course, rolling around with him in the partially finished nest. He pinned him down by sitting on his rump, stretching up to run tickling fingers up his mate's sides with a chuckle. "Think you can get one up on John Watson? I'll have you know I'm a master pillow fighter."
Fawnlock murmured softly in his native tongue before he sat up slightly, tilting his head to scent the air of their cottage, a small smile curving his Cupid bow lips, "The soup smells good, I think it's simmered and all ready," he looked to John with a playful smile, the rumble sounding louder deep in his chest as he looked over his mate with a warm gaze.
Moosecroft's eyes flicked momentarily to John, considering this seemingly normal human had somehow managed to do something that not even many full-fledged fae could achieve. The bull returned his gaze to his brother and slowly blinked, then couldn't help but smile. Moosecroft actually smiled, and it wasn't in a mocking or smug sort of way.
After a second, he remembered the apron and tugged it off, then sank back down beside his mate. The delicious smells of the cooking soup filled the cottage, making it feel warm and homey. John stretched out beside the fawn and slung a hand out over his hips, lazily petting the soft fur there.
"Yea! " John holds his hands to hold the mouse, giggling as the tiny creature practically vibrates in his hands.
"John, ah, that f-feels a-amazing." Sputtered the fawn into John's neck, lips brushing his heated skin. The fire in his belly coiled tighter and tighter, burning the Fae with pleasure that made him feel like he would fly to pieces.
The group carefully crosses the street and enters the cafe. Sherlock immediately chooses a window seat where John can sit next to him. The younger boy kicks his feet slightly as everyone else sits, eyes on his friend.
John watched as Fawnlock nuzzled at the new jumper, taking his free hand and threading through dark curls and down long a soft ear.
The Fae smirked softly before he settled his mate's hands back down and dark palms along with speckled digits slid under the denim of his human's jeans to stroke over the fabric of John's pants and pull the denim down John's thighs.
This class already seems BORING, Sherlock sighs softly, none of the other children seemed interesting, they were all idiots, he could tell. So after an initial look over the room, (he wasn't paying much attention) he had turned to his book. The teacher was an idiot too, boring and his sad attempts to make the class fun and interesting were a tad pitiful.
Mrs. Hudson smiled softly and beckoned them forward in the dusky evening air as the owl flapped away. Fawnlock grinned softly at the elder Fae, bowing his head slightly as they approached.
After several hours of nothing happening, the portal closed, and the fawn stood the stretch, he moved to the gate to open the portal and step through, traveling to his brother's wood with ease.
The fawn hums, smiling softly, raising his dark hands to bury his fingertips in John's sandy locks. His nose twitched as a puzzled look crossed his face. "What do you mean by, consummate?" Fawnlock asked, curiosity coloring his features.
"Yes, let's. Come on Sherly, John."  John pulls Sherlock along as they head for the exit, the cafe in walking distance from the museum.
"Hullo you two, did you enjoy the soup?" She asked softly as they drew nearer, the fawn nodded eagerly, looking to John with a soft and affectionate gaze.
Fawnlock gave a soft chuckle as John nuzzled his furred cheek, the rumbling deepening and sounding more loudly.
As Fawnlock's lovely fingers wrapped around him, there was an almost instant relief of pressure, and he murmured sweet nothings up at his mate, chasing his lips for another kiss. It was less of a kiss actually, more of a long exhale that brought their lips together.
After a few minutes he bleated in approval, "This is wonderfully perfect," he turned to peer up at John over the rim of pillows and cushions, tail swishing.
Mrs. Hudson just chuckled softly and offered John a mischievous smile, "Now, tea and biscuits before you're off to see Moosecroft, Fawnlock," she started towards the kitchen, leaving them to go to the sitting room, but not before she turned slightly to speak, "/Be sure to give him my regards Fawnlock, and remember he's family, and family's all we have in the end, love./" She switched easily between the languages, before she was off to the kitchen to make tea.
"I can't wait till spring, but while it's winter, there are still things we can do, there's a frozen pond nearby, we could skate, or there’s winter berry picking, I could start to tutor you on Fae language, too." the fawn snuffled at his mate's neck, taking in his scent. "Anything you'd like, John," Fawnlock's ears twitched back and forth, his mind wondered a bit, the Fea enveloped in the comfort of his mate's embrace.
He watched the fawn nibble at his biscuit with absolute affection, thinking nothing was lovelier than relaxing here with someone who loved him enveloped in his arms. Their relationship was utterly unique, and John wouldn't have it any other way.
John had never felt something so intimate in his life, and with another drag of his mate's tongue over the raised, damaged flesh, John came with a full body sob shaking through his body. His body stiffened and then went limp just as quickly, sinking into the blankets and pillows in absolute bliss.
John was definitely all for keeping more dangerous experiments out of their home. He'd rather not have their den the source for fires or explosions. But he wanted to keep his mate entertained and interested, and building a place for him to work was something he was more than willing to do. As the fawn snuggled closer and spoke of all the things they could do together, John slipped his hands up into the dark curls and rubbed the back of Fawnlock's neck, pressing his thumb into muscles there to gently massage them. He was more than happy to lay here for a bit and just bask in each other's affection until they figured out what they'd do for the day.
The fawn gave his mate a tentative smile, lifting himself slightly to pull the hand that'd been stroking his curls between them. The Fea ghosted his lips over John's wrist lightly, his ears flicking, though when John mentioned the fawn's earlier actions, his ears froze mid-flick.
The fawn looked at their linked hands as his ears twitched. His toes wriggled into the quilts as he tilted his head up, staring at the ceiling, "My father died when I was young, leaving Moosecroft to continue in his place at an extremely fresh age. My maman took her life soon after my father passed, it's not uncommon among the Fae to do so when concerning the deaths of their mates, they form strong emotional bonds," the Fae said this with a hint of distaste, "Moosecroft sent me away soon after that, claiming that I was irresponsible. I believe he resented me, I had always been maman's favorite, it was obvious, and he adored her much more than father. I remind him of her...." The Fae gave a huff, that ended in a soft sigh, his gaze moving back to John slowly, eyes dark with untold sorrows. "Mrs. Hudson and this wood are all I have..." The fawn wanted to add to this, say that it wasn't true anymore, he had John, didn't he? The fawn's ears twitched and his nose scrunched in his uncertainty. He huffed softly, tail thumbing once more. John ran his thumb up and down the edge of Fawnlock's hand, keeping their fingers threaded together as the fae spoke of his own disjointed family. While he may not have gotten along with his sister, it wasn't like the fawn's relationship with his sibling, where he was a total burden. John had his aunt who at least cared for him though she hadn't needed to. It was sad to hear that the fawn was so alone, thrust into the woods. And though he loved the forest and it's creatures, they still hadn't accepted him, even though his entire life was caring for them. John's heart ached for Fawnlock.
Mycroft glances at the booklet, memorizing it and then picks up the next piece to add on to the maze. He looks up at the way John watches Sherlock, smiling as they work to build the maze. A smile sets on his face as well as a blush when he thinks about Greg Lestrade. It's silly to think of the older boy in his opinion, he has far too many responsibilities to think about a boyfriend and why would the rugby player be interested in him.
The fawn gave a soft bleat as he pulled John down into the nest with him. "Cuddles now," he hummed softly, arms loosening around his mate slightly, the fawn pressing his damp nose to John's pulse point like earlier in the night, eyes lids fluttering as he snuffled. He scented the soothing smell of his mate, cuddling closer.
John keeps the plant in one hand, bag on his back and fingers laced with Sherlock's.  He knows people are staring, they always stare, being innocent and slightly ignorant he does not understand why.
"Perfect!"  John writes the title down and then leans over to look at Sherlock's drawing, jealous.  When he’s done, he smiles.
The taller boy smiles softly, "The Curious Case of the Mystery Plant." Offers Sherlock after a few moments of thinking, little fingers steepled and index fingers tapping his little Cupid's bow lips.
His brows did lift in surprise, not exactly for the news, but rather that his brother was actually coming forward and admitting his situation to it, with minimal interference on Moosecroft's part. He waited patiently for his brother to speak his fill, even though the awkward shuffles and distracted stroking to the scarf wound around his neck. Which was no doubt a gift from this potential mate. So courtship had begun.
"Very nice," John agreed, though it wasn't just the warm water that was lovely. He liked having the fawn snuggled against him, the soft weight and the constant press of a damp nose to his neck. Though cuddles weren't always easy with the branching antlers, they weren't that difficult to get around, and John managed to tilt his head so he could rest his cheek against the curls without being speared.
"Yes this is where we're staying." He looks at the three star hotel that is just half a mile down the beach. "I share a room with my sister. My parents have their own." 'Not that they are ever here...'
"I believe, in human culture there is something similar to our kind's mating traditions, it is called marriage, as if sure you know. It isn't the same, and I believe it can become temporary, and isn't always used because of love, but then again, neither is mating. If John can understand his kind's marriage and our love then he can understand a bond like ours." the fawn reached under the table to take John's hand in his, squeezing lightly before his eyes fluttered open once more and he locked gazes with Moosecroft.
"To be gay, with you. I know we're just kids, but you've got to wonder sometimes about the things we'd do as adults."
"Oh, it's dusk, we should go out if we want to see Venus!" John exclaims, excited to see the planet in the night sky.
The water is turned on, Mycroft balancing the hot and cold so neither of them gets burned. He grabs a washcloth and soaks it, plopping the wet, warm material on Sherlock's face.
"The good news is I'm going to absolutely spoil you until you're better." He grinned and found a butterfly bandage to hold the cut closed on Fawnlock's head, then collected the bloody bits if gauze and bandages to toss in the fire. Once he was finished, he helped the fae to sit up and handed over a glass of water and some paracetamol tablets to help with the pain and swelling.
John blinked slowly, the gears in his mind much more sluggish in the morning, but he was quite sure the fawn had been very suggestive just then. John cleared his throat and really tried not to stare too much at the long lines of Fawnlock's back as he stretched out and put the book away.
He set the biscuits of the kitchen counter, then moved in further to throw a few logs on the fire and stoke it with a prod of the embers with the fireplace poker.
John's other arm wrapped around Fawnlock's waist, holding him steady and letting him buck forwards against John's hand, rutting against his palm. Turning his head slightly, he pressed kisses to the fae's temple, assuring him.
"It's still very good John," Fawnlock murmured softly, turning his head to rub his damp nose against John's stubbly cheek before turning back to his lunch, sipping at the soup and munching on the bread happily.
The fawn moaned softly, tail swishing furiously behind him as he rutted into their hands and against John's prick. He grunted as he quickened his pace, looking back up to his mate, ears twitching slightly. He tilted his head up to catch one of John's kisses on his lips, immediately nipping at John's lips, leaning into him. The Fae snuffled softly, eyes fluttering half-closed as he canted his hips to bring the pair closer. The hand in John's hair moving to cup the back of his mate's neck, bringing his John closer and deepening their kiss a bit.
He smiles as Mycroft allows him to knock on the door. Sherlock reaches up and wraps his knuckles on the door twice. Sherlock's wearing a nice eggplant-purple button down and one of the pairs of jeans Mycroft would let him keep when he started in the new school, along with his chucks as always.
Fawnlock glowered up at the dark raptors circling above him, begrudgingly following at his own pace, arms crossed over his chest.
The fawn’s nose scrunched slightly as he thought of the term John had used, "I suppose you'd be like a royal consort, if I lived in or frequently visited my brother's wood and the royal domain. Out here you're just my mate, my bonded partner, my love."
The fawn carefully rested his chin on John's shoulder, tilting his head as not to hurt John with his antlers. He nuzzled into John's neck slightly, wrapping his arms around John's waist.
John rolled both of them over onto their sides, so Fawnlock wouldn't have to hold himself up at all, and John could focus easier on his face.  Their legs were still tangled together, and John pressed himself to the fae's hip, rubbing his own aching arousal against the silky fur. It relieved some of the pressure and he moaned, pulling Fawnlock closer against him with one arm while the other stroked the fawn, thumbing over the head and gathering beads of precome there to smear over his palm and make it easier for his hand to slide over the hard flesh.
Sherlock smiles softly, hugging him back, "It's no problem, John. And you can come over to mine anytime." He squeezes John a tad more.
Fawnlock turned his head to the side once more, cheek laid against the soft nest, he huffed a soft sigh, "I don't want you to see that side of me and be... Scared, like Mousey was... Mrs. Hudson was even a bit weary at a point." Though the fawn doubted his brave mate would ever be afraid, he still had some doubts, "I don't want to lose you because I turn out to not be who you think I am." His cheeks burned with a searing flush of embarrassment and shame.
John happily explains things about the antelope he has learned, to anyone who would listen. Sherlock is his most captivated audience member, settling his cheek on John's shoulder to watch as his friend reads.
Sherlock flashes John a soft surprised look, a flush burning across his pale cheeks. He leans closer to John, looking back through the telescope, "T-thank you, John. I guess."
"Oh, it looks amazing!" He pulls John against him slightly, hand grabbing John's, "It's sorta pretty, too." He murmurs a softer than before.
"True..." John mummers in agreement, moving to the next couple displays in the room and head toward the exit to move on. He sees that it is the exhibit that he wanted to see the most. "Hurry up Sherlock!"  John demands as they head toward the last exhibit, the African animals exhibit.
"When you come here to get wood, you'll be able to tell which trees are fine, but be careful... This part of the wood is like hallowed ground, Fae come here when their time is up... This is one of the other places I'm meant to protect." The fawn snorted softly, "My brother at least trusts me with this, there are few hollowed cites for Fae anymore, but these trees are also the only ones safe to use for fire. This wood is blessed by the Fae, most of the fires made from the other trees were used only in ceremonies and such in old times when humans still believed in fae."
"Oh," Mrs. Watson blinks.  So he is homosexual, even if Harry was straight it wouldn't work. "What is he like?"  She asks.
The weekend finds Winston letting the Holmes brothers out in front of John Watson's apartment complex. He smiles brilliantly, waving after the brothers in case they don't need him to drive. He waits patiently to make sure they didn't need him or anything else. (Although he is personally excited about the trip and wants to go too, shhh....)
On the page was a more detailed lone portrait of him as a babe, thin fur fluffy and all puffed out. Speckled poof of a tail obviously mid swish in contentment, and small moth lighting on his dark twitching button nose, gaze slightly cross eyed as the young Fawnlock's little Cupid bow lips were parted in a delighted baby giggle.
"Wooow," John gasps as he looks up at the tree with sparkling eyes. He'd never seen such an amazing tree.
Fawnlock gave John a small apologetic smile, "I apologize John," he nuzzled at his mate's cheek and snuffled softly before he looked back to his brother, grimacing slightly.
The Fawn's gaze went back to the human, noting the dark Wood surrounding them. His ears twitched as he thought then motioned towards where the human had come from earlier, "I can escort you of you'd like, it's getting colder out, the moon rises early on cold days." He didn't want to leave the huma- John, yet, and he could sense the human's hesitancy as well. John was by far the most interesting, not-dull thing to be found in the wood, other than himself, for many years. He exhales softly and gazes over to John, ears perked slightly.
A pink blush dusts John's cheeks as he smiles cheerfully. He has to stifle a yawn as it interrupts him, "Me-" he yawns,"too Sherlock. Heh... I guess we'd better go to sleep." He suggests, his eyes half lidded now and he snuggles into his blankets and laying back so that he may sleep.
"Harriet, I am seven years old, John is nine, we are too young to date, and we are certainly not going to do anything 'dirty'. You are clearly very intoxicated, you are speaking nonsense.. Please do not disturb us, John and I are going to his room." He takes John's hand, not finding it fit to say more.
John grinned with the permission, reaching for the bottle of shampoo tucked away on the alcove set in the wall above the tub. He poured a generous dallop into his palm and then began to lather up Fawnlock's hair, scrubbing gently over his scalp and cleaning the thick curls.
Mrs. Hudson smiled softly, "Oh, it's quite alright John. You're our guest and I'm more than capable, but I'll keep it in mind, dear, though our Prince helps quite a bit when I ask." She set the tray down, patting the fawn's curls fondly before pouring herself a new cuppa and adding sugar and a dash of milk. "Well, I have much more to do, Fawnlock, could you be a dear and take down those dried herbs and replace them with the ones in the basket before you leave?" The fawn's ears twitched with a huff and the elder Fae chuckled softly, "You're taller, dear." The fawn finally nodded and the elder gave a short chuckle as she left the room. Fawnlock refilled his cup and prepared it, taking a long sip after, ears flicked down.
Mrs. Hudson entered the sitting room with a tray, humming softly, she settled the tray on the coffee table and poured herself a cuppa and took a biscuit.
Fawnlock was so adorable it was certain John's heart would swell so large it would burst. A cuddly ball of fur, with ever curious eyes. The next page was even more so, with the two brothers struggling against each other as only siblings could. Moosecroft /was/ a little chubby here, but then he was larger than Fawnlock in general. His colouring was gingerier than Fawnlock's dark browns, but there still was obvious similarities that said they were of the same family. John smiled, touching that squirming toddler that had grown into the fawn he loved.
"John, we should clean up your room." Sherlock offers, still weary Mrs. Watson, he'd never actually met her, only heard about her.
John nodded silently, as if he understood, as if he wasn't completely shocked that there was an obviously amazing and definitely magical creature kneeling before him. John tried his best not to stare outright, even though the other didn't bother the same courtesy, outright staring at John. It didn't unnerve him however, not when he had wounds to take care of. His doctor's instincts took over completely, and scooting closer to the offered arm, he wet a square of gauze in antiseptic and took up the delicate furred wrist. "It will sting a bit." He said softly, focusing on the bite mark as he lowered the cloth and began cleaning out the wound. It was important to sanitize it, since mouths were generally full of bacteria, and it'd be horrible to have it get infected. Once it was cleaned, he took up some antibiotic cream and gently rubbed it into the arm, glancing up at the creature's face. "Thank you...for helping me."
He smiled a small lopsided smile at his mate, "Thank you John, its good." He are a bit more, leaning into his mate's side lightly.
The fawn’s eager affections made it that much harder to leave, but John wanted Fawnlock to be properly fed and have all the strength he needed to face his brother. So John eventually untangled himself, planting a kiss to a dappled cheek and then climbing out of the nest to head for the kitchen.
The Fawn's eyes narrowed as the human reached into its bag and pulled out a plastic white case, Fawnlock recognized the red cross on it's front from humans before. He straightened, eyes rolling at the human's words, he wasn't an idiot, he understood. "I may not be familiar but I understand." He muttered softly. His gaze flickered about, looking for any threats, he huffed softly before dropping down and kneeling, holding out his injured arm to the human. Though he'd heard of and seen from far away, he'd never seen the human's medical studies and knowledge put to use so up close before, he wasn't going to waste an opportunity. Though he was still wary eyeing the human, now that he was close, he could tell several things about the human; male, obviously a healer/doctor, not young but not old either, strong instincts, perhaps a warrior, or as humans called the soldier.
The rugby player gives a smile, flushing slightly, "Not a problem, just making sure they're okay, they had a bit of a run in with a bully." He pushes from the table and ruffles a hand through Sherlock's curls, who gives him a slightly annoyed look, which Greg chuckles at.
"We'll see I suppose, eventually we won't be able to bring it outside when the weather gets colder or it will die." As he says this they round a corner, his apartment building comes into view. It is a nice building, his apartment near the top floor, one of the bigger apartments.
"Mycroft, Sherlock's older brother." John smiles up at Mycroft before taking Sherlock's hand again when Mycroft leads the way back to the summer house. He liked having a friend he could be close to. The holding hands is just awesome. A friend he could touch and wouldn't get annoyed about it. Honestly, he needed it, it made him feel so much better.
Sherlock frowns slightly, "I don't know, I notice, and I like to read," Sherlock stands as John lifts the glass, he holds out a palm, "May I?" John drops the shard into his hand.
Indeed the fawn was smirking, his lips curled slightly as the human hurried him along. He squeezed John's fingers as he skipped ahead of him to lead him back home, not minding much anymore if he made any noise. Fawnlock happily lead John back to his cottage. He stopped as they entered the clearing, wearily eyeing the ring of toadstools surrounding it.
The fawn huffed slightly into their kiss at John's immediate cleaning if their bellies and his dusky hand, but still he let his eyes flutter closed and allowed himself to kiss his mate lazily. After their kiss broke the fawn nosed at John's jawline and down to his neck then the column of his throat.
That night the Holmes brothers have fun walking amongst the pools, examining the animals and collecting samples until the stars came out. Then the brothers walked back and changed into their jams after a quick shower ("Sea salt isn't good for your skin, Sherlock!") and laid out on the back porch to look at the stars. After which Sherlock promptly fell asleep, leaving his brother to tuck him in.
Fawnlock watched the fire dance before him, a small smile quirking his lips. Fawnlock laid the hand that wasn't warming on his mug, on John's thigh, looking at him from the corner of his eye. His toes curled slightly as they warmed and he flexed he fingers around his mug. He took another sip of his tea, ears flicking, giving the human beside him a soft smile.
Inside the cottage, John nose started to itch, and soon he was sneezing again. Rubbing his nose, he glanced out the window at the soft glow of magic, wondering if that was the reason for his fits. With a chuckle, he pulled of his pack and set it aside, then went and got some matches for the kitchen to start up the logs into a fire. As the door opened, he glanced back with a smile just as the wood sparked and starting smoking. Opening the floe to the chimney so the smoke coiled up the chute, he dusted off his hands on his jeans and walked over to Fawnlock in the front entrance, reaching up and cradling his cheeks.
Finally the fawn spotted the instrument leaning against the wall on the far side of the nest, Fawnlock let out a happy bleat and bustled over to scoop up the delicate string instrument. His dark speckled fingers stroked lovingly over the instrument's smooth hollow and wooden body, the rumble sounding softly and pleasantly in his chest, he looked upon the violin fondly, a soft smile quirking his Cupid bow lips.
Sherlock pouts for a moment before nodding, "Okay," a smile stole across his lips as he shifts off John's lap to sit next to him, settling in and picking up the booklet. He holds it out to Mycroft, showing him the page they're using.
Fawnlock was still a brat, and still always would be, but there was something that had changed there, something John had changed.
Niko here! I'm the other writer DUH XD, I'm also the primary editor. She's the drawer, I'm more the grammar nazi
Sherlock looks over the chain-link of fence, "We could play pirates too." He looks over at the other kids on the playground, "The rest of our class is rather dull, aren't they?"
The fawn drew closer, ears twitching with curiosity, letting his dark palms and speckled fingers skim down John's bare back. The Fae gave a soft bleat as he bowed his head once more to nuzzle under John's ear and down his neck with his damp nose. A soft smile curled Fawnlock's lips as the rumbling continued and the fawn lifted a hand to slip back into John's hair. He bleated softly, nipping at the human's neck softly.
"Cut the bullshit, John. Don't you have other men to kiss?" I sneered, pushing him out of my way and out the door. The air was bitterly cold, but anything was better than being in that god forsaken club. I waved down a taxi, when a piercing scream filled the air.
And I did. John, feeling my body's reaction to the  orgasm, rippled right after me. Those moments together were the most intimate moments I've ever had.
His cock was being deepthroated and he was high and ohmyfuckinggodIdontknowwhereIam, but he hadn’t felt this good in a while. Sherlock’s head kept bobbing up and down, fast and then slow, meticulously and then messy. If he kept doing that, making those slurping noises and gags, John wasn’t going to last much longer.
“Do you want me to fuck you?” He groaned, looking into this vicious eyes. Sherlock nodded and grinned, leaving John’s cock with a POP that was entirely too indecent. John grabbed Sherlock by the collar and kissed him aggressively, tearing off his clothes with no regard for how expensive they probably were.
He stared at me, eyes widening in surprise and shock. I smirked at his reaction and continued to puff on my cigarette.
In that moment, John would’ve done anything for that man. His porcelain skin appeared to be marble, blue (green? grey?) eyes that struck an ice pick through his heart, dark hair that was pulled back in a loose ponytail, long curls framing his face. This creature was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen, and it took John everything not to get on his knees and suck the soul out of him. He was so hard already, what the fuck? “Yes sir,” he complied, and sat in the seat.
I thought back to all the filthy names John had spit at me when he took my virginity. One, for whatever reason, stood out to me, however.
Sherlock was pulling down John’s pants and trousers, blunt still in his mouth, eyes boring into his soul.
Suddenly I went into more deducing mode. "Your name is John Hamish Watson, you're twenty-six years old and just recently came back from Afghanistan after getting shot in the shoulder. You're a very intelligent man, hence becoming a doctor at the age of twenty-three. But for some reason, you cannot seem to find a job in your profession around this area and so you strip five nights a week at that God-forsaken bar even though you know you can do so much better than that. Your father abused you at an early age and your mother knew about it but decided not to say anything. He also sexually abused your sister so you decided to paralyze him from the waist down. You like women but you've always been interested in being with a man, hence the stripping at a gay bar. You like their reactions, you crave them, it's like your drug."
"Of course I was. When I met you, I knew I was fucked. I knew you were gonna change my life and I was scared and I'm so sorry, Sherlock. I truly am. I'm such a piece of shit but I can make it up to you. Please. I'll do anything."
"I'm going to fuck you so hard, you won't be able to sit or walk correctly. And you're not going to cum until I say so. Got it?" John growled, nipping my neck and placing a finger inside me. I yipped as he moved it around, gently touching my prostate. "John, please... please fuck me." I moaned, burying my head into the pillow and bracing myself for t-
“What do you mean, can read you li-, never mind!” He took a couple of breaths, and knocked on the door. Who the hell was this guy? “Come in,” A deep voice bellowed from within the room. John opened the door, closing it gently behind him. The room was dim, but he could see a figure with curly hair sitting in the chair in front of him.
Nodding but embarrassed, I put my head down. Slowly, he gently grabbed my chin, tilted it up, and placed his lips upon mine.
Sandy-haired man, almost silver, with eyes as blue as the deep ocean. A smile that did something strange to my heart. Perhaps I needed a doctor?
“John Watson, I know. Lestrade told me about you.” Making his way toward the figure, John smiled. “Good things, I hope.”
I ran out of that place as fast as I could, and I cursed myself all the way. I decided to go by Angelo's and smoke a cigarette, leaning against the wall, needing to collect my thoughts.
"Brother dear, I-" he shuffled awkwardly, and I raised an eyebrow. "I care about you. And it breaks my heart to see you like this."
"Thank you Samuel, for your kind words. What do I do now, exactly?" I replied, placing a hand on his shoulder and slightly smiling.
Mycroft looked at me, and I looked at him. Suddenly my so-called "emotions" got the best of me, and I fell weeping into the arms of the British Government, who in return held the World's first (future) Consulting Detective.
"You're the beautiful one, John. I've never seen anyone as beautiful as you." A rosy color appeared on his cheeks, and if that wasn't the most adorable thing I had ever seen, I don't know what is.
Hello everyone! Apologies for not updating in a bit, I've been trying to relax over this winter break. But you all deserve another chapter, so hopefully you enjoy. Also, I was thinking of making a one-shot of Johnlock in a... Dorian Gray-esque sense. Lemme know if that sounds good to you! Cheers :)
Maybe that's why I'm so lonely? No, not lonely. Just alone. I like being alone, though. At least I know I can always rely on myself.
He looked at me, and I saw a flash of concern pass by, but as quickly as it came, it went just as fast.
I whimpered and nodded vigorously, looking down into his eyes as he grinned mischievously and slowly started to lick my length. I let out a long groan, biting my lip harshly. Blood dripped down onto John's tongue as he started bobbing up and down and rubbing my balls. I started shaking, moaning, my eyes clouded with lust.
The fucking Rocky Horror Picture Show lookalike tried coming up to me again, but I pushed past him and muttered "Fuck off."
No, not a woman… a beautiful man, with makeup and heels and everything. They were called Queens, John could recall. Fucking gorgeous, if he was being honest. He grimaced, nodding quickly.
"Really? People usually hate it when I deduce them. They usually tell me to piss off." He laughed when I sputtered that out.
"Of course, my dear. As awful as this shithole is, I do appreciate the fact that we take care of our dancers and don't parade them around like they're whores. Go ahead and change, and just walk through that door on the left to come out into the lobby."
I was sent to detention because I had called my Advanced Placement Chemistry teacher a complete imbecile and deduced his affairs with two of his best students of which were both genders in front of the head master.
"You are so beautiful. The most beautiful creature I have ever met." John whispered in my ear, as he slowly shed off all of my clothes, until the only thing left was my bare soul.
Grabbing the dull razor I had used all too often in my adolescence, I breathed heavily as I made quick lines across my wrists. The red liquid running down my arms looked strange against my ghostish pale skin. It made me smile, though. It was the one thing I could always rely on, pain, to convince myself that feelings are despicable and useless. Feelings are unnecessary to society and they should be illegal, in all honesty.
“Sherlock… what an incredibly sexy name. Hey, do you have any Doors shit you can play?” John slurred a bit, not giving himself a break with the marijuana. The shit was good, man. Sherlock chuckled, nodding.
I started seeing stars, I had never felt pleasure like this before. As the slamming continued and my knuckles turned white from gripping the sheets so tightly, the feeling of orgasm started to arise.
"Good, because I'm going to fuck you now." And that he did. I wanted him to. I wanted him to devour me from the inside out.
Next thing I see, John tears him off of me and starts punching him mercilessly. The other men crowded around and tried pulling John off of him.
I sat in a empty table close to the stage, where the perspiration of the dancers have been evident on the table. It didn't take long before the announcer blared his voice into the speaker, which was of course by the table I sat at. Jesus Christ that was loud.
"I fucking love you, you bastard. I don't fall that quickly but I fucking love you. And I'm so sorry."
I broke my promise to never return there again, but at that point, I just did not care. My "emotions" were more important than my pride.
"YOU FUCKING PRICK, DON'T YOU EVER TOUCH HIM EVER AGAIN OR I WILL SLIT YOUR THROAT!!!" He growled maliciously at the man, who instantly ran away from him. John looked at me and helped me to the door.
It's such foul language to use, but all articulate thoughts and feelings I had just dissolved into acid.
"Hey there," A voice spoke to me. I begged to a higher power that it wasn't Hamish, but I turned around and fucking lo and behold, there he was in all of his glory. I nodded slightly at him. He smiled and I could've died right there and been happy.
He had changed into a pair of dark blue jeans with gigantic holes and a white t-shirt that clung to his chest. I have never seen anyone so.... beautiful before. My breathing hitched as he locked eyes with me and he smirked.
ALSO, "Infra 5" is by the wonderful Max Richter. I figured it's a song no male dancer would do, except Sherlock of course. It's very beautiful though, one of my favourites, I highly recommend it.
“Yes John, please fuck me faster… please.” The whimpering started to increase once the thrusts became deeper and quicker. Sherlock’s asshole felt like absolute Heaven, and he wanted it all. John reached around and grabbed Sherlock’s cock, stroking him quickly. A couple more thrusts and John had found Sherlock’s wonderful prostate.
But Mycroft. Fucking Mycroft. Always tells me to go "Enjoy people", "Have some sex", "Experience some feelings besides misery." Can you believe the bastard?
All of a sudden, he stopped sucking me and bent me over the bed. I was taken aback but more turned on than ever.
Making his way to the front step, the sign blinking weakly that simply said “Bang Bang”, John realized he didn’t even know what this place was. A gay bar? Gay strip show? Gay cult?? Multiple possibilities running through his mind were interrupted when the tiny little black slit in the middle of the giant wooden door opened, bulging eyes staring down at him.
"You'll be on at seven thirty, you can get ready in...dressing room number four. You'll need a name though, what do you wanna call yourself?"
Unfortunately, the song had to end. I opened my eyes to see everyone just staring at me. A couple of gentlemen were shaking, one was actually crying. I stared at them back, and swallowed the tears that started to form a lump in my throat. I knew I shouldn't have done this. I was a complete fool.
I turned on my old record player and had "Danse Macabre" drown out the entire world as I slowly fell asleep and dreamt of making love with someone that actually loved me back.
A woman walked by me, wearing a black jumper and a purse to match. I deduced she was approximately thirty-three years old, a heavy drinker and has a gambling problem, recently left her husband to be with his cousin Martha, is from Manchester and moved to London in dreams of becoming an actress but is working secretly at a brothel instead, and-
Beating lights of pink, blue and blood orange filled the stage as the dancer finished his routine, chest heaving with his g-string filled with fivers and tenners.
I was already close to the edge of climax, and John recognized the tension my body was doing, and so he stopped.
“You want my cock in you, Sherlock? Tell me that’s what you want!” Sherlock cried out, “Yes, yes, yes. Please John!” two more times before a finger, two fingers, three fucking fingers entered him and began to pump. He began to thrust back, grunting, his red cock leaking with precome. “J-John.. Please!”
I had the biggest empty and hollow feeling in my chest after seeing... him with another man. I gave him my everything that night. I never thought I would lose my virginity, let alone to someone I had just met, and for him to just use me like that was completely and utterly cruel.
I didn't once dare open my eyes. The moment became spiritual for me. For once in my life, I felt as I was in control. That I had control over everyone else's emotions.
“Like Tracie told you, I can read people like a book. And right now, I want to read everything about you. Here, take this.” The man gets up, and grabs John a rolled up blunt, handing it to him. “I grew the marijuana and rolled them myself, this shit should be at least five times stronger than anything you’ve tried.” He smiled for the first time, and John fell in love as he flickered on the flame and put it to the blunt.
"I love you infinitely, John Watson. I love you so much." Words seemed to escape my mouth, even though it felt like I couldn't breathe from all of the pleasure he was giving me. But he finally uttered those magical words; "I love you too. Now cum for me."
Hello everyone! Again, thank you for all of the wonderful and enjoyable comments. They really make my day (:
"I want you... to touch me." I growled hastily into his mouth. He nodded, and after kissing me a couple of more times, he hoisted me over his shoulders and carried me to his flat.
Unfortunately the song ended, and Hamish smiled as he got up, bowed as he collected his money, and walked off.
“Let me suck your dick, John. Let me do this for you. ” He nodded vigorously, or he at least thought he did. All he knew is that when Sherlock engulfed him with this wet heat, John felt himself transcend into something else, he didn’t know what the fuck it was.
But John... he brought out something different in me. He brought out feelings I had never felt before on that night we were together. After he had kissed me, lust had consumed both of our minds, and so he took me to his flat.
I decided to get the hell out of there, when all of a sudden, a man grabbed me aggressively and shoved his tongue down my throat. His hands roamed my body and grabbed me in my most intimate places, and that's when I started to whimper. I tried to push him off of me, but he was too strong. I felt him stroking my penis and I couldn't help but shake.
"If I went to some crazy unexpected place and had no one talk to me for the whole night, he would never try to make me go out and see people ever again." God, he must think I'm pathetic. Well, I am.
Out of nowhere, however, applause emerged. So much of it, with shoutings of "Oh my God" and "Encore!" mixed in there. I took a quick little bow while picking up some money and left the stage, taking a last look at John, who looked pale as a ghost.
Silence… John was about to leave when the door violently swung open, and the tenner was snatched from his hand. “Get in, tiny little man.” The werewolf monster sneered at him, beard covering everything but his eyeballs. He was pushed inside before any reaction could be mustered up.
Enjoy (: also, it's hard as hell to write through Sherlock's POV so I hope you all are appreciative of this, haha. Just kidding, but I'm glad you're all enjoying it!
Flashbacks of the horrendous birthday party event entered my mind and I gently shuddered, which Mycroft noticed.
“Yes, John, please! Please put your massive cock in me!” He replied, hanging onto John with no air in his lungs. He had been pushed onto the very couch where John was, plump and bare ass waiting to be fucking ripped apart. John grinned, slapping it, making it more and more red.
“Good. What a compliant little soldier. That’s what you want to do, isn’t it? Mmm, it’s not clear to me whether you’re going into the military because you truly want to, or because you want to become a doctor, and the military is the only way you could afford it. Never mind that, it’s obvious. You’re twenty years old, star athlete of your secondary school Rugby team, lost your virginity at the age of fifteen with a girl named… Mary? But you secretly didn’t enjoy it, because you were fantasizing about your teammate Michael. You come from an abusive household, your father died about four years ago from drunk driving, and your mother is currently institutionalized in-”
Doing their work for school together, no matter how much or how little has been a practice that Mycroft had encouraged since mom moved in with her sister. The more time He has with Sherlock, the better, otherwise, Mycroft fears that Sherlock will become antisocial and depressed.
"Yeah...I think I can switch. Maybe. It sort of feels like flipping a lever in my head when I am actually thinking about it." He hummed and reached back down to rub the edge of Fawnlock's ear, where it connected with his neck. "doesn't seem very fair, does it? You had to learn it yourself."
"I'm glad you like him, the cage for him is in a box set aside, already set up for him. What do you think we should name him?"
Sherlock nods and smiles softly, taking the paper, "Welcome, I'll try to call," he sniffles slightly, "You're the best first mate I've ever had, even better than Mycroft." He bites his lip, he can feel the burning prickling the back of his eyes, and he can see John's eyes swimming in tears as well.
John chuckled softly with the pout, but nodded. It was a good idea, and he so loved to watch the fawn do clever things with his fingers.
Sherlock gives John a smile as he finishes his food. He picks up his bowl and flatware and puts them in the sink, "What do you want to do with the containers?" He asks.
The fawn scooted further to help John with access to his curls. Fawnlock gave a soft bleat as his mate began to lather his curls, the fawn wriggling slightly. He leant in his mate's hands, murmuring softly, tail swishing under the water, stirring it slightly. His hair had always been a wonderfully sensitive part of him, paired with his delicate antlers and responsive ears, his whole scalp could be one large sweet spot.
When he wrapped his arms around John, the blond slid his hands up the fawn's back, feeling the soft jumper and rubbing the material beneath his fingers.
"Takes a good Captain." He looks up at Sherlock through the corner of his eyes. He doesn't know what say, two weeks felt like an eternity, where does he start?
The taller boy nods, "Good.." He looks up at the building before looking back to John with a small smile.
"John," the Fae's nose slid up John's neck and across his jaw, "It will be dark soon." He murmured. John trusted the fae's sense of time, since he was essentially part of the forest, he'd know was happening outside of the tree. John hummed and licked his lips.
The Fae's ears twitched as he watched the human collect more berries.  He gave a bright smile, standing to help John collect. He dropped a few berries into the pouch, leaning over to press a chaste kiss to John's cheek. He turned away with a chuckle to scan the forest once more, mapping out the quickest route to the trees he wanted to show John in his head. His tail flicked as he turned back to pluck a berry and pop it into his mouth.
"Yes...that'd be best. I want to keep both of us warm through the winter. And I want to take care of the forest as well. It's our home. It's important."
The home had the undeniable mixed scents of John and Fawnlock. The human was tending to their den and it painted a lovely domestic picture that Moosecroft had never thought his brother was capable of obtaining. But he was glad he had. Fawnlock claimed he didn't do well with emotions, but here he had a mate that he loved fiercely.
"Yes, Mummy." He holds the book loosely at his side as his mother frowns slightly but still stands and drops a kiss to his head, him returning it with a kiss on her cheek. She moves to kiss Mycroft's cheek and smiles as he returns it, then leaves to follow their aunt.
Sherlock hugs John tightly, smiling softly, "John!" When he pulls away, taking John's hand in his, fingers laced tightly upon habit.
The Fae's blush stayed deep as he slid his damp nose over John's shoulder, attempting to hide his slight embarrassment, "I felt a bit disappointed when you cleaned me up, I-I like having your scent all over me. I like it being obvious by scent that I'm yours." The fawn explained softly, nose buried once more in the crease of John's shoulder.
“I love your scent. I want to fill our cottage with it completely, every corner, every crack. I want there to be no doubt we belong to each other." He opened his eyes and tilted forwards a bit more, pressing their lips together in a slow, lazy kiss as the suds ran down the back of his neck.
The elder Fae turned and patted the fawn's cheek, offering him a soft smile, "/Be kind to your brother, Fawnlock, he loves you, and just wants what's best for you, show him John's is right for you./"
Sherlock chuckles softly as he's dragged away by his friend. As they stop at the first price of art, the younger boy scowls.
Sherlock wraps his skinny arms around his friend, "John." He murmurs softly enough for no one else to hear. The few kids in the classroom stare but then look away, deeming the pair weird.
John reached up and gingerly touched the crown, flushing slightly at the obvious symbols of royalty. This was a life Fawnlock knew, what he'd been born into.
Sherlock smiles at John, "I'm here for the next couple weeks as well, so yes, though in a week we're going to visit Mummy for the weekend." He cocks his head, "Okay, Mycroft!" He turns to John, "Private bath through that door," he points it out for John with a smile. "I like playing pirates, Mycroft won't play much, he's got lots of schoolwork, do you like pirates?" He asks as he moves over to the door and opens it. John and Sherlock move into the bathroom; John having to use the stool to reach the sink and turns the water on,
The Fae's tail flicked, his ears dropping slightly as he moved close. Fawnlock moved and brushed the bushes with his fingers, thorns simply moving away from his specked digits. He carefully plucked a few berries from their branches and cupped them in his palm. He turned to John, out stretching his hand to him, "Here,"  As Fawnlock spoke and held out his hand, the blond dropped his gaze to the offered berries and blinked owlishly, then smiled and took the fruit, scooping them into his war worn hands and pressing one between his lips. The juices squirted over his tongue, sweet with just a slight tang. Wonderful. John looked wistful for a moment. The berries would make the most wonderful jam. John licked the juice staining his lips and carefully slid down to sit upon the soft littering of fallen leaves, staring at the arch and the wild roses. The whole thing was so beautiful, and John was fairly sure this wasn't something humans ever were allowed to glimpse often. How he had earned that privilege was beyond him. But he was so very grateful for it.
Sherlock nods, scribbling the title down in his journal in his messy scrawl. He jumps from his perch after John, "Wait for me John!"
John admired how the jumper looked on the fawn, matching his darker bits on his feet and hands, and the rich dark curls a top his head. The knit wool was soft to the touch, and came down to the tops of the fawn's thighs, rucked up a bit over the little poof of a tail above his bum. It'd been too long on John's arms, but it was just the right length on Fawnlock's.
John smiled and dropped his gaze to set the items back into the case, sealing it up into his backpack and then dropping his hands to rub sheepishly at his knees. "Well...still...thanks. Even if it's your job." His tanned cheeks had grown slightly ruddy every time their eyes met, slightly embarrassed with his desperate urge to stare. He didn't want the creature to leave; he was the most fascinating thing John had ever seen in his life, in all his travels. "Is there something I can call you? Or...maybe you don't have a name like me."
He nosed at John's shoulder, his damp nose bumping John's collarbone. He bleated softly, hands moving to John's bum, hand gently gripping one cheek, the other hand still gently tugging John's hair. His ears flicked against John's chin and cheek, his tail swishing behind him. The fawn gently nipped at John's shoulder, his hips bucking once more into John.
That pout, oh that pout really did John in. He knew the fawn was never truly upset, but the way those plush lips pulled down, so expressive, it was like a siren's call to John.
"Have you not been yourself this whole time? You haven't been lying to me while we lay together. When we hold hands and smile at each other, it's not a lie. I know there is more to you than just me. There's a lot of John Watson you haven't seen either. But I don't ever want anything besides all of you. I can't only love a piece of you. I love all of you, or nothing at all. That's what you deserve."  John moved his fingers up to rub against his mate's cheek, then stood up with a smile.
He huffed softly, damp nose sliding against his mate's warm skin, "Moosecroft's opinion doesn't matter, I'm staying with you no matter what he says." He murmured before he pulled away slightly. Fawnlock's gaze swept over John's face as he examined him for a few moments, after a bit his ears dropped slightly and he pressed a chaste kiss to his mate's cheek.
John didn't eat much meat himself, so their diets would work well together. As Fawnlock finished and wriggled closer to John, the blond laughed softly and kissed that smile, arms lifting up to stroke through the dark curls.
After a bit the fawn led John slightly off the trail to a cluster of trees. He let go of John's hand and moved closer, growling in his native tongue. A few hooked beaks poked from the branches and the fawn lifted an arm. A large raptor like bird flapped down, landing on the Fae's arm, talons digging into his fur.
Sherlock chuckles softly, "I've always wanted to retire to the country and keep bees when I'm older." He gives John a small smile, squeezing his fingers again and moving him over to the adults.
She watched both the brothers' brows furrow as the thought, Fawnlock crossed his arms over his chest and pouted, the elder Fae chuckled.
"We'll work it out. I think I can get one on you if I cut out the collar." He spoke in a somewhat distracted tone, watching Fawnlock root and snuffle around against his belly.
John smiles and nudges his shoulder into Sherlock's arm, "You're not either. We'll watch over each other." He promises, resisting the urge to take his hand. The other boys would pick on them even more.
John'd been in the middle of baking apparently, because he was wearing an apron with the sleeves of his jumper rolled up, and there were smudges of flour on his nose. He was all smiles as he hurried across the clearing, dusting his hands off on the linen apron. He slowed as he caught sight of Moosecroft though, his eyes flicking up to the majestic antlers and then back to the luxurious cloak.
Soon they had the food ready, and the Fae happily helped John pack his pack, he even offered to have a pack himself to help carry thing when they got to the den.
The Fae's ears flicked and his tail swished in excitement of the new development in their bond, he remembered something Mrs. Hudson'd once said about the bonds between mates, that a bond helped a couple understand each even more than before. So if Fawnlock's theory was correct, after Moosecroft had "blessed" (in his own annoying git way) their bond, combined with how the fawn had admitted his fears and insecurities about their bond to his mate, it had strengthened their bond that much more. Causing John to be able to understand him, the fawn wondered how far that understanding went, if Mrs. Hudson was to speak in their native tongue, would John understand her? Or what if the fawn wrote something in Fae, would his mate understand that too? What if it was something Moosecroft'd wrote?
“Though now that I'm moving a bit more, my chest hurts a bit, and when I woke up I did feel a bit dizzy, but it passed." His frown lightened slightly, he knew John would take care of him, like he did the night before.
"And here we are." He stepped forward to the door, and looked to John to undo the human things he did to protect their den.
"I love you, John," the fawn bleated softy, snugging closer to his mate, he didn't want to have to leave him that night to guard the gate, but he'd only gotten away from that duty the night before because of his brother's visit.
The fawn bleats softly as the scent of the chocolate biscuits hits his nose, he leans forward to nuzzle John's hairline before he took his tea. He took a sip and gave his mate an appreciative smile at the extra sweet tea. Fawnlock gave a soft bleat, picking up a biscuit and bit into it, ears flicking slightly.
John stares at his sister and frowns. Their parents being military and in the medical field had told them the dangers of things like drugs and drinking and everything else under the sun.
"Will you be my friend forever, no matter what? Because I know I can be moody... And I can say things... things that hurt people... And I don't want to lose you... Because of that." Sherlock's eyes flicked down.
The fawn spooned some soup into his mouth, after he'd swallowed he gave a bliss filled bleat. He'd missed tasting Mrs. Hudson's home cooking, the Fae didn't really know how himself, he could boil water, cook meat and veggies over a fire, but that was thanks to the elder Fae, since as 'royalty,' Moosecroft, Maman and he had never had to cook for themselves.
Sherlock leans forward, and lays a hand on John's shoulder, "We're different, most people don't like things that are different." The taller boy frowns slightly.
"Lovely," Mycroft rolls his eyes as he follows the young boys into the limo and sits beside Sherlock, John on the other side. He is almost sad that Sherlock wouldn't be cuddling up to him like he normally would. Fortunately, John is there with him and hopefully, he will never leave him.
Fawnlock watched John, pale eyes examining for any new facts to learn, watching his tongue as it darted out of his lips, John did that a lot.  The fawn's nose scrunched slightly as he watched John, "John, are... Are you bowing?" He asked softly, very confused. He carefully settled his hands on John's arms and brought him back to stand. "You don't need to bow, John, Why would you bow to me?"  He didn't think humans bowed to each other anymore... The fawn's ears twitched as he scrutinized the human. They only bowed to their royalty no a days, didn't they? The fawn gaze a snort and his tail flicked as he quickly dawned on the reason, "Mrs. Hudson told you I was Prince of the Fae." His hands lowered from John's arms.
"Though it seems with humans, your scent comes off strongest, here," Fawnlock inhaled, a smile curving his lips, before he continued, "and at your genitals. It's not as strong as at you neck, despite it being a major pulse point, but your wrists and ankles give of subtle waves of your scent as well, though not very strongly." He murmured softly, ears twitching.
"You're absolutely wicked..." He managed, swallowing thickly and moving his hand to curl the fingers down the inside of Fawnlock's thigh, rubbing the soft fur slowly.
The Fae felt all warm and secure in the jumper that smelled of his mate, he cuddled close to John, the rumble raising in volume, the force of the sound practically vibrating the fawn's chest.
John's hands were warm on his shoulders as he embraced the fawn, entirely different from the frigid winter winds that were normally his only embrace. Fawnlock pressed his nose into the human's sandy hair, nuzzling the human like he would any other Fae. His eyes fluttered closed, arms winding around John's back and squeezing him back, hands settling on the human's shoulders. After a few moments he felt a zing through his veins, the fawn's eyes snapped open. He lifted his head and looked out the window, eyes narrowing. It was the call of the witching hour, singing in his blood. The fawn heard a familiar screech of an owl, and he let go of the human, but not without hesitation. "The hour is close." He turned to John, "I apologize. But I must leave."
He practically tackles Mycroft in a hug in front of their limo, "My! My! I passed all my tests!" He tells his brother giddily, practically jumping with happiness and pride. Mycroft picks Sherlock up and hugs him tightly, laughing excitedly. Sherlock laughs as his brother scoops him up and spins him, usually he wouldn't ever allow Mycroft to do such a thing in public, or at all for the matter. He's just so excited at the moment, that he just hugs Mycroft tighter and smiles more, one of his real smiles.
Fawnlock finished up the slice of bread, tail swishing and ears flicking, "Its different from Mrs. Hudson's bread, it tastes a bit odd, but I still like it," he offered John a small smile, then leaned against him more, the rumble from the fawn's chest getting louder as John's thumb rubbed the Fae's thigh idly.
"Gotcha. I'll take you guys there, and wait for him with you." He behind leading the boys to the building.
"Please do. I want to make it perfect for you. Can't have you running off to someone with a nicer nest." He teased, reaching with one hand to take a hold of Fawnlock's, lacing their fingers together.
He looks at the clock. Half past.  Mycroft would probably be expecting a call from them to ask for a ride for Sherlock.
He helped Fawnlock onto his feet and pulled him in for a proper kiss, then wrapped the scarf around the sleek column of his neck above his ruff. As he tied the knot against his mate's throat, he dragged his fingers down through the thicker fur with a happy sigh. "Come on then love. Let's pack some food for the hike. And I know you want to sneak some biscuits." He tugged Fawnlock towards the kitchen, and pulled out some thermoses and containers so that he could pour the rest of the stew into it, along with bread and biscuits, and a flask of fresh water.
For a sibling who had never cared about anything after the death of their parents, it was refreshing to simple see him care so much. Cool grey eyes widened in mild awe as the younger fae's rant continued, venom spitting from between his lips as his eyes lit with a wildfyre that Moosecroft could feel heating the whole of the den.
John closes his bedroom door decorated with lots of different things.  Doctor stuff, military stuff. Doctor Who all over the walls. His seashell and rock collection along the windowsill.  His bed is completely Doctor Who. He places their project on his desk and turns to Sherlock.
"I'll always give everything for you. All that I am. /I love you, Fawnlock./" The foreign words came out as an awkward click, his tongue stumbling over the accent. Once again, he wasn't conscious of the shift, just holding onto the fawn wonderfully tight and nuzzling together with a pleased sigh.
"Sherlock..." He whispers, a bit fearfully, clinging firmly to Sherlock's hand. John lets out an undignified yelp as the bully grabs them both by the front of their uniform shirts.
"Will you play something for me? And I'll make us a bit of lunch and we can have something of a picnic."
"I'm fine," Sherlock squeezes John's fingers reassuringly before looking to Greg, "We're supposed to wait at the library." Greg nods.
"I see." Another smile, hands shoved into the pockets of his house trousers, they are hanging lower on his hips than usual. Over the summer he had been slimming down and fretting over his diet, not wanting to be talked about behind his back for one more thing such as being overweight. His smile almost wavers at that thought but the smile on his brother's face saves it.
The fawn shook his head at the human's offer, "I'm fine now," his ears flicked as he looked up at John, he leaned up to nuzzle at John's jaw, carefully wrapping his arms around his mate.
"Can I wash your hair for you? It'd be better for me to do it, since I can be careful of the stitch."
The young Fae smiled, the rumbling vibrating through his chest, it was traditional that the Patriarch of a family be the one to make all the new crests for their family's new mates. "What would you like? A pendant, I think that'd suit you best or perhaps maybe a ring." The fawn hummed softly, turning his hands in John's to grasp his mate's fingers and intertwine them with the fawn's own. "Is it traditional for human mates to give rings during their ceremony? We can mingle the traditions together."
Fawnlock made a soft whimpering sound, the fire inside seeming to coil in his belly. He surprised himself when suddenly his hips bucked against John's, his ears dropped slightly as the blush under his soft fur darkened. He looked to John with an embarrassed but questioning gaze, bleating again, but quieter, softer than before.
Fawnlock frowned slightly as he looked to this portrait, "Moosecroft took after our father, he was very serious around Da, and the late King could be seen as cold at times, especially to me at most." He sighed, ears twitching, "But he was warm, under all the aloofness." He turned to the next page, which showed just that, his Da smiling slightly as he cradled a sleeping toddler Fawnlock, obviously tuckered out from a day of romping after a lunar festival, a delicate crown of irises laying skewed in his disheveled curls.
"Only read a million times!"  John rushes over to his bookcase, pointing out all the books on his shelf.  He has all of the novels and they all appear to be worn and well loved.
"I think it’s a flower, not like a vegetable or of anything. What about you?"  John squeezes Sherlock's hand back, this is something they tend to do for unknown reasons.
Mycroft's face lights up as he flushes with pride and love for his brother, he loves it when Sherlock is receptive to his affections and returns them even. It has been happening more since John entered their lives.
When she answered, John bowed his head politely and said his hellos, pulling out the woven pouch of berries to offer her. "Fawnlock and I picked these for you. He said you used them a lot in your jams and biscuits. Sorry he's not here....he got hurt last night while guarding the gate...he's alright now, just a bit sore. He mentioned you made him soup once when he was sick though...Maybe you could give me your recipe? I'd like to make it for him, so he feels better." He flushed slightly, scratching at his cheek.
John looked over at Fawnlock and nodded, "I think I have a good idea of which trees are suitable. Clearing them out will make more room for the ones that are still alive." When Fawnlock spoke of his brother again, John shifted his hand over so it lay over the fawn's, soothing him with slow strokes.
Sherlock perches on John's bed, picking up his things and putting them in his pack, "This was fun, John, thank you for inviting me over."
"You're welcome John. It's nice to see Sherlock bring a friend over." John just smiles wider at Mycroft.
"I'm coming," Mycroft says for the millionth time that morning. He walks up to the counter with his personal credit card (entrusted to him by his mother and Winston)
Fawnlock smiled widely as he finally stopped, nosing at John's jaw, "We can go on hikes, pick berries and apples and even go fishing, if you'd like." The Fae's body practically vibrated with the rumble in his chest and his excitement.
"I did say so. Let's not keep you waiting, hmm?" John took the fawn's hands and kissed his knuckles before standing, helping his mate carefully to his feet. Fawnlock nodded eagerly, leaning in to press a kiss to John's cheek as he pulled him up to stand.
"Besides, I learned about rocks and minerals in school, don't you pay attention during lessons?" He asks as he lifts the glass to reflect light. He turns it in the light. "Suppose it's coloring is similar," he mumbles quietly, handing the shard back to John.
The Fae's hands lowered to skim over his mate's shoulders and down his arms to take John's hands in his larger ones. Fawnlock brought John's hands to his mouth, brushing kisses over his knuckles, "I haven't made flower crowns or chains in years, but I remember, perhaps I can teach you once spring comes to the wood." His speckled thumbs brushed over the backs of his mate's hands, smoothing the skin with a find smile before he lowered John's hands to press a kiss to his mate's lips once more. Fawnlock nipped at John's bottom lip lightly before pulling away with a soft smirk, long eyelashes fluttering slightly as leant forward to nose at John's cheek.
He probably couldn't outright understand Moosecroft or Mrs Hudson completely if they spoke fae either. Maybe he'd understand what he'd already heard from his mate? They'd have plenty of time to figure it out. John accepted all of Fawnlock's kisses with a happy hum, running his fingers over the tightly scrawling script that was his love's handwriting.
"I heard my teacher's saying that they were considering putting me in advanced classes next year." He tells his brother happily, tapping his pencil on the desk rhythmically.
John made himself comfortable, snuggling into the high collar of his jumper and wriggling his way into the leaves till he was half buried. With a lazy blink, he watched as Fawnlock rosined his bow, treating every bit of the instrument with the utmost care.
"Ah, yes." He passes it over, pressing the last piece of his own section into place, watching as the two boys finish the rest.
"Show me more of your technique," John hummed, shuddering as the breath skimmed over his neck, hot and wet.
A small smile quirked a corner of Fawnlock's lips, he leant down to nuzzle at John's cheek. The Fae rubbed his damp, cold nose against John's before he turned, speckled fingers still intertwined with his mate's.
"This is an important part of mating, yeah? What else is there? I want to make sure I'm doing everything right for you."
Sherlock tilts his head slightly, "He's nice, brighter than he looks... But if he hurts you I'll make his death look like an accident." States the seven-year-old, with the most serious face.
Fawnlock saw no other option, it was his duty to protect, and this human was obviously in need. The smell of the human's fear seeped through the air, swirling to Fawnlock causing him to bare his teeth in a feral fashion. The Fawn sprang up from the thicket. He skidded in front of the human, lowering his head slightly a the warg, the sharp tips of his antlers slicing the air as her bared his teeth, the warg growled and took a step back as the fawn looked as if ready to charge. His warning still rang clear, run now and be punished later, or face possible naming if not death.
The fawn had yelped softly in surprise as a cushion hit his bum, and then just as quickly he was thumped lightly on the back of his head. Fawnlock huffed a soft chuckle as John tackled him then straddled his bum.
Sherlock tilts his head as he speaks, "At the beginning of the summer my teachers were discussing accelerating me into a higher grade, my brother wasn't told if I was or not a few weeks before school actually started. When we found out Mycroft wanted me to go to a better school so he had my files transferred two weeks ago." His brows furrow slightly, "Neither of us knew you came here, but I'm glad you do."
"I can wade too you know. A full body dip might be nice. The cold will surely wake me up really quick."
John watched as the other stood, his eyes drifting up to drink in the sight of the whole body, a mass of spots and swirls that formed such lovely patterns across the tufted fur. He guiltily dropped his gaze, realizing that this wasn't an animal, but a sort of man, and gawking at him was more than a bit rude. "Mm....Fawnlock, eh?" He tried out, licking his lips as if he could taste the name there. Brow furrowed, he chuckled softly and then climbed to his feet as well. John brushed the dirt from his knees, then his fingers off on the front of his jumper, pretty much foolishly defeating the whole purpose of the action. Still, he held his hand out to the other, wriggling his fingers in anticipation. "Well then...it's good to meet you, Fawnlock."
The royal den was vast as it had ever been, but now it was decorated sparsely, all sense of family and warmth gone from stone walls, despite the twin fires crackling at either end of the mouth of the cave which dipped down below the earth to a network of vast tunnels. The den had become Moosecroft's by inheritance, and there was nearly nothing left of their mother and father, instead, everything reflected the ascetic choices of the new King.
"Mummy didn't think this was appropriate for my age when I started reading them, but I love reading, ever since I could.  I love fantasy and everything.  It’s so exciting!" He puts the book back gingerly and then turns to Sherlock, still smiling.
"I'd love to see what you looked like as a child, John." His dark nose twitched as his tail thumped against the floor, "I bet you were very adorable." He bleated softly, and shut the album with carefully hands, stacking it with the other tomes he'd dumped amongst the nest.
His ears flicked as he explored, after a few minutes he knelt next to John and the tub. He peered over the edge, fingers curling around the porcelain. His nose twitched at the rushing water, and the fawn tentatively dipped a hand into the warm water, giving a soft pleased bleat.  He looked to John with a small smile, ears twitching.
John was slightly surprised that Fawnlock was going to meet with his brother so soon, but the longer they waited, the less chance they'd have to get on his good side.
John happily let go of the fae so he could rush ahead in pursuit of the coveted biscuits. It was adorable to watch him get so excited over some cookies, even if a few of them weren't nearly as perfect from John having his hand in their creation. It wasn't bad at all for a first attempt though. The blond looked on proudly at the platter, which was now moving over towards Moosecroft.
"So what if we were? " John asks, extremely confused and upset that people don't like it when boys like other boys or girls like girls.
At his mate's inquiry on whether he could consciously slip in and out of it, John concentrated, scrunching his nose up and wriggling it like a rabbit.
John wakes up not too long after falling asleep, his nightmare about some monster or bullies whatever metaphor the dream made for him had tried to get him. Tears streak down his cheek and he pulls his torch out, flicking it on to make himself feel safer. He tries his best not to whimper and wake Sherlock. He didn't want Sherlock to think him to be a cry-baby.
Greg gives the younger teen a look of empathy, his mum had always been a tad bit depressed throughout his childhood, though she'd been able to pull through for him for the most part. It was sad, such brilliant boys like Sherlock and Mycroft having to grow up depending on only each other, Mycroft taking care of his little brother.
John was always happy to receive Fawnlock's kisses with a smile as he filled up the pouch and sealed it shut, attaching it the side of his pack so it wouldn't get squished within. As he popped a few more berries into his mouth, he watched Fawnlock stare out over the forest, wondering if all fae were this affectionate with their potential mates, or if it was just something between he and the fawn.
He let out a soft bleat before he pulled away, not before dropping a line of kisses across John's shoulder though. The fawn made his way back to the last blanket, spreading it over the nest and crawling inside. The Fae checked over the soft bed, tail swishing contently, snuffling softly.
"/I'll be fine, John, don't worry yourself too much for my sake./" Fawnlock murmured softly, turning his head to rub his nose against John's cheek. The rumble in the fawn's chest echoed softly through the bare trees surrounding the pair, the young Fae leant slightly against his mate as he felt John reaching through the bond they had.
"If you need help, I'm right here." John teases, knowing Sherlock is the smartest person in their year. If not the school.
"Oh right!" Still, hand in hand, they run into the house, to grab the house phone before retreating to Sherlock's room.
"Okay, let's go ask Mycroft to set up his telescope." He takes John's hand and pulled him out of the room, down the hall and into the study.
Fawnlock then followed his mate the rest of his way to the door, he opened it and turned to press a soft kiss to John's forehead and brush his dark fingers briefly through his mate's short sandy hair, snuffling softly as he scented his mate one last time before he left.
The Fae smiled a soft lopsided smile as John placed a lingering kiss on the corner of his lips. Fawnlock smiled looking down at his lap, tail flicking as he ate the rest of the breakfast with a soft bleat.
He was putting so much trust in John, and the blond wasn't going to take it for granted. All of his focus was on making sure Fawnlock was comfortable, save for the rush of adrenaline and arousal that was dominating every single one of his movements. John shifted his wrist and curled his hand around the hard length of flesh, stroking slowly up towards the tip. He watched the fawn's face as it pressed against his shoulder, making sure he wasn't overwhelmed at any point. His own need was secondary, easy to ignore in favor of making Fawnlock feel good first.
Mycroft gets out of the car, looking at the three story apartment building that has several similar ones situated next to each other. This is nothing like his manor or the Watson's family's slightly more luxurious entire floor apartment. It's in a decent part of town, and Mycroft doubts his family lives in anything larger than a two bedroom, seeing as he is an only child.  Still, he smiles, able to appreciate the idea of a simple life, where he could have his mother and Sherlock all to himself; a bit broken but it is still his family.
The fawn's ears flicked as he stared down into his cup, "Yes, it would be best for me to help, seeing as the winters coming." He looked back up and out into the window that sat across from the couch, watching the last of the leaves slowly drift to the semi-frozen earth. He looked at the human from the corner of his eye, "No, I don't hibernate, like many of the other creatures of my wood. I still need to protect them, even as they sleep, it's when they're at their most vulnerable." He muttered softly, ears twitching as he took another sip of his tea, toes wiggling slightly under his bum.
John was the one to huff now, dragging his hands up to bury in the fawn's hair. "I'll have you to keep me warm." He liked the idea of having Fawnlock staying with him in the cottage however. The feather bed was soft and had lots of pillows, and he was sure the fae would enjoy it. In fact, with all the bookshelves in the bedroom, he was sure the fawn would /love/ it, or maybe they'd make a nest. They could spend the winter together, and Fawnlock wouldn't have to worry about getting snowed in. As the fae leaned in and kissed his jaw, John hummed, carding his fingers lazily through the dark curls. "Distracted? How could that be? What could possibly distract you?" He teased, turning his head just enough to catch Fawnlock's mouth in a proper kiss.
"What is the hurry, I wonder?" He finally says in regards to the honking of horns to get out of the parking lot. People driving recklessly. Mycroft wonders if he'll ever get his license.
He brought the hand up to his lips and pressed a kiss to the fawn's knuckles, then moved over to the edge of the nest to find his clothes and start pulling them back on. Save for his jumper. He went instead to his rucksack, pulling out the jumper that Mrs. Hudson had made for him. He tugged it on over his head and smoothed his hair back in place, then looked over at his mate with a smile.
The fawn snuffled softly into the fabric and after a second or two he spoke, "Its.. You... But different.. “ he grinned as the deep rumble vibrated through his chest as he huffed a chuckle.
John found what he'd been looking for, and dragged it free of his pack, turning back towards Fawnlock and holding out a thick, blue scarf. He unraveled it and reached over to wrap it around the fae's neck. He smiled and tied it in a loose knot, settling it around the thicker fluff of fur on Fawnlock's neck. "Here...this will keep you warm while you make your rounds. And you are more than welcome to come warm yourself by my fire when you're finished. I just hope your den is nice and warm. I'd invite you to spend winter with me, but I understand you have to leave by midnight." He patted the scarf, made of soft cashmere yarn in barely noticeable alternating stripes of royal blue. "I found this in a closet of winter coats. My great aunt must have knit it. I thought it'd look nice with your eyes."
His ears twitched and flicked as he listened to the raptors above and the sounds of the lovely forest around, gaze darting around to spot glimpses of the Fea and magical beings who inhabited Moosecroft's wood. Not many Fae approached Fawnlock to greet him as he walked, most were afraid of his brother's wrath or of the Fawn biting usual attitude, his kind weren't the biggest fans of the young Fae.
The fawn pressed a warm kiss to John's jaw, "Even with her rather tedious affections for me, I still didn't want her gone, she was useful and one of the only beings to ever be kind to me." Fawnlock took a deep breath, biting his lip once more, worrying it between his teeth before he continued, "But one day, it'd been an all-around dreadful day, I could feel a good sulk coming on, but still I had a very important experiment to attend to. Mousey was assisting me when she began to ramble on about something I found tedious and had no use for, it was distracting me, I almost dropped a vial, I snapped at her to shut up, and pointed out that she wasn't tending the fire like I had asked, I'd been rather loud and irritated, thus a bit angry, she startled and ran off, as she ran up she knocked over a whole rack of vials that spilled into the fire. The rest... Well, you can assume what happened... I apologized after I'd gotten over my sulk.." Fawnlock sighed softly, tail swishing uneasily.
The blond blinked and then nodded, squeezing Fawnlock's hand before turning more of his attention to the elder brother.
The fawn nodded, taking the human's hand, "Not too far from here, there's another cottage, tomorrow, follow the owls, they'll show you the way, an older Fae, she'll prefer Mrs. Hudson, resides there, you can wait for me there, around noontime," Fawnlock stood with John's help, he moved towards the door, pale gaze never leaving the human's, "she's been wanting to meet the human I've allowed to live in the wood for awhile, she just doesn't leave her cottage until it's dark. She's rather fond of humans, she used to live in the city." The fawn flashed a shy smile as he settled his hand on the doorknob.
The fawn mumbled something breathlessly in his language, his big ears flicked as he translated for his love, "John, you the most brilliant, incredible, amazing creature I've ever laid eyes on. You make my heart swell... And I love you."
They tuck in and eat silently, just looking at each other every so often. John doesn't have anything to say and Sherlock, being Sherlock doesn't have to say anything - his presence is all he needs.
He grabbed a hold of Fawnlock, hands slipping up to his cheeks as his mate wriggled happily, "I didn't even know I was doing it! I just...I just you were so crestfallen and I just heard and knew. I had to do what I could to make you happy." John smiled sheepishly. "Even if that meant learning a new language in a blink, I suppose."
The three adults looking at different things in the room, occasionally looking over at the boys. When the two of them are stopped staring up at the dinosaur, Mycroft decides this is the perfect time for a picture. He whips out his phone and snaps a flash free photo of the two boys with their necks craned to look up, fingers interlaced as they stand shoulder to shoulder. Mycroft's heart warms; he's happiest when Sherlock is happy.
"Come here, lovely," he hummed, reaching down and wriggled them together till Fawnlock was higher and John could seize the hem of his jumper and tug it up to Fawnlock's neck, then carefully work it up over his antlers.
"I apologize, John though you were in deep ream sleep, I-I noticed before I..." John wanted to rub away the frown on his fawn’s lips, but let the other speak, listening curiously. Fawnlock paused for a moment, ears dropping slightly, "introduced myself, that you have nightmares, not in the past few nights but... It takes a toll on you, I've seen before when you first moved to this wood...." He pursed his lips for a moment before pressing a chaste kiss to his mate's lips. "I'm sorry for worrying you John." He murmured softly, hands moving to circle around John's back, pulling him close.
"So cool!" John laughs and adds the rest of the drift wood. "This is awesome!" After he stares at the fire for a bit longer, John takes his place beside Sherlock again and grabs his stick. "I love toasted marshmallows." He takes a bite, wincing at how hot it is, but loves the taste. "Mmmh..."
"Now we got to get the one Harry's got...." Sherlock takes John's hand, "Are you going to tell your mum?"
The fawn wrapped his arm around John as he stepped near, the fawn nuzzled at his mate's jaw in greeting as he spoke to his brother. The fawn have a slightly exasperated huff, and looked up to press a kiss to his mate's cheek, then turned to gaze at Moosecroft.
John grinned happily as the fawn murmured his name and nuzzled against him. He wasn't clear either on what a courtship entailed for a fae, but it really didn't sound like it was that much far off from what he knew. With that worry shoved behind him now, he shifted onto his back and drew the fawn on top of him, covering his face in lazy kisses. His hands ran back down to knead against Fawnlock's back, feeling the soft fur beneath his fingertips. "Fawnlock, my Fawnlock," he sighed happily, holding him close while being mindful of his antlers. "You've made me  a very happy man." The fawn quirked a soft smile, bracing a dark hand on each of John's shoulders gently. He nuzzled into the human's neck, snuffling slightly as he basked in John's scent and his kisses. He huffed softly, placing a soft kiss on John's neck. His back arched into John's hands, the rumbling in his chest starting up once more and growing louder than before. That rumbling purr was the most wonderful sound he'd ever heard, and he stared up at Fawnlock, his dark hair and antlers haloed in a golden light from the fire. He stroked up and down the length of the fawn's back to coax more of those rumbles out, tilting his head back to give Fawnlock more room to nuzzle as he saw fit.
Oh! There it was! When his mate switched back to actual English, John could tell now. There was something like a click in the back of his mind when the fae changed to his natural language. John gave a surprised gasp, as apparently he'd just done something wonderful simply by being himself. Whatever forest gods were out there were evidently smiling down upon their bond, making it so strong and powerful already.
The fawn nosed at John's throat, a soft growl of irritation escaping his lips, "But it's not his approval so much that bothers me, that doesn't really matter to me, it's more of the fact that I detest his company, and I don't like him encroaching on my territory." Fawnlock's tail flicked in irritation, "I don't want him scrutinizing you either, the fat git has failed for years to secure a mate yet I just know he'll turn his nose up at you, it's in his nature. It upsets me, because you're beautiful and perfect, everything I'll ever want or need." He huffed, pressing a soft kiss to John's neck.
Mycroft makes a small sound of surprise, eyes opening halfway to look at Greg's that are seeming to ask permission.  He slips his eyes closed again, leaning forward to get a bit more comfortable, parting his lips and allows Greg in, thankful to have someone more skilled lead him in this slow dance of their tongues.  It feels nice, kissing Greg, he is gentle and patient with teaching Mycroft who had never kissed before.
John's eyelids drooped as Fawnlock nuzzled at him, and he could only nod in response to the question about sleep, letting his mate lay him back and curl around him.
"I love you too, John." Fawnlock turned his head to nuzzle John, damp nose sliding across his jaw, snuffling quietly.
The younger boy nods quietly, before sighing a bit dramatically. "There's nothing to tell, My, nobody likes me because I'm the know-it-all freak." Sherlock shifts so he's leaning against his big brother now, "They're all stupid and boring anyway." He huffs slightly.
John Watson, just turned age nine and barely hitting three feet and two-quarters is wandering down the beach his family had dragged him to for the summer. His sister Harry is off looking for some pretty girls instead of watching him the way she was supposed to. So here he is, wandering down the beach, dragging a stick he had found. Bored and lonely. There are no other kids around right now. Too early in the season and too early in the morning. The sun is beautiful and warms his skin, the ocean licks at his feet. At least it's a nice day.
Mycroft smiles and follows after Sherlock into their home, but at a much slower pace. He thanks Winston for the ride, informing him of the trip to the summer home when school lets out.
John shifted beneath the fawn, smiling against his lips as he tried to greedily lean towards all the touches at once. The expressive ears wriggled against his hands, flicking up and down. As much as he loved nuzzling and holding the fawn, he didn't want him to get too distracted again. The gate would call to him soon, and he didn't want to work both of them up just t o have to part. He flicked his tongue out over the fae's bottom lip and then pulled back from the kiss, giving once last tussle to the curls before he pulled his hands out of the fae's hair and grasped his shoulders instead, sitting the both of them up. With a smile, he drew his thumb over the fawn's bottom lip. "It's close, yeah? I don't want you to be late, love."
It was lovely to watch Fawnlock be so enthralled. John was considering all the things he could introduce the fawn to. Fawnlock loved sweets, so John wondered how he'd take to some hot cocoa now that it was cold outside. It was good to think about things like grocery lists, instead of the looming meeting with his mate's brother. But John wasn't fearful of it. No one would ever convince him to leave the fae at his side. They were happy together. His brother would see that.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, "Mummy doesn't care, she just cares that we visit her." He sighs as his brother grabs his hand and pulls him towards the limo, he really just wants to be with John down at the beach.
"You'll find someone who wants to be your friend because you are the know-it-all freak one day Sherlock. In fact, they will love and admire that about you." Mycroft explains quietly, still running his fingers through his brother's curls. Sherlock winces slightly when Mycroft's fingers unintentionally hit the bruise on his forehead. He seethes and bites his lip. Mycroft notices the wince on his brother's face and frowns. He noticed everything about his brother.  Then there is the biting of the lip. He's in pain. Hesitantly he brushes Sherlock's curls away from his forehead and finds the purple bruise above his eyebrow.
As Fawnlock told his tale of being buried in the snow dredge, John blinked in surprise. "It snows that much in the wood? I'll have to collect much more tinder than I thought. Probably have to make a run into town a stock up on a few things as well in case I get snowed in." He really didn't have any idea how harsh the winter was this far north. He turned towards the fawn with a smile and nodded. "It's very sweet of her. She's lovely to care for you like that." He sat up a bit beside Fawnlock, tilting his head back to watch the smoke from the fire coil up towards the vent in the tree. He turned his attention back to the fawn, watching him stroke the quilt and snuffle into the scarf. "Its nice to have someone that cares about you." John said softly, reaching over and patting the fae's dark hand.
John toweled his own body off quickly, then scooped the fawn up and carried him into the bedroom, setting him down on the stripped bare mattress and John went to pull some clothing out of the closet to dress for the day.
"Hey, Freak, Pipsqueak.." A voice called, Sherlock's head snaps up once more to glare at the older boy who now sat before their usually empty table. Sherlock didn't particularly like being called Freak, what really ticks him off was when people call John out for his size.
John pushed up onto his feet and without even pausing to drag on pants, was running outside, flinging the door open. Spotting the crumpled form of the fawn in the grass, John ran over and knelt down, reaching for his mate and gently checking the dark patches of blood on his fur. The fawn gave a soft smile as he saw John crossing to him in the garden. Cursing, John slid his arms under the fae and lifted him up, cradling him gently and holding him against John's chest. Carrying him into the cottage, John moved into the kitchen, setting the fawn on the edge and sweeping everything on the table onto the floor so he could lay his mate back on the tablecloth. Fawnlock cuddled into John chest as he carried him and stayed still for his mate as he checked him over
The fawn's ears dropped slightly as he saw the human's brows furrow slightly, and he cocked his head when John's hands left his hair. But when he felt the odd sensation of the human's warm lips against his, his ears perked once more. The gesture was odd, Fawnlock deduced that it was a human custom of some sort. The feeling of John's lips moving gently against his was rather unusual, but it felt good, right in away, spreading a warmth through his furred body. The Fae pulled away after a moment, ears twitching with interest as he regarded the human. His tail thumped the floor as he leaned forward more to cup John's face with his speckled fingers, "John?" He said in a soft murmur, the human's gesture made the fawn want to nuzzle John once more, but he was curious what the gesture meant.  As the kiss broke and Fawnlock stared curiously at John, calling out his name and mimicking the touch of hands to his face, the blond smiled gently, though a bit sadly. As he'd thought, the kiss was nothing the fawn would understand, or truly reciprocate. It struck him then, just how lonely he'd been, and he'd overstepped what was proper between them.
Sherlock makes his own nest of pillows and blankets next to John, "You had fun, right?" He asks John, hopeful.
His heart thundered in his chest when those pale eyes landed on him, and then as quick as it appeared, it was bounding across the river after the overgrown wolf. John pushed up on to his knees to watch, getting his jeans muddy in the process. He didn't seem to notice the damp, scrambling closer to get a better view. It managed to chase the beast off, and John felt his stomach drop at the thought that the deer creature had run away for good. Silence dropped back down over the thicket, and John stared at the opposite bank catching his breath. Suddenly, the antlered creature returned, stalking over toward the blond and standing over him. John's eyes darted down to the bloody arm it held, then back up to its face trapped beneath that intense gaze that bore right through him. His tongue darted nervously between his lips. "You're hurt." He whispered, not wanting to speak loudly and scare the creature off.
"Yea! mum, you'll love the car Winston drives us in, it is sooo big!"  John pulls Sherlock down the hall, heading to the lift, a slight bounce in his step that is nearly always there when it's just the two of them.
John barely had time to flick his gaze up to meet the smoldering bits of silver before a moan caught low in his throat with his mate's words. He'd never heard anything so wicked in his life and he nodded quickly, tilting his head back as more kisses came to his throat.
The Fae's fingers in John's hair slackened slightly, his other hand sliding down his mate's body to settle on his chest, over his heart. His breathing slowed as his tail swished lazily, the fawn's chest vibrating with the too familiar purr-like rumble. Fawnlock snuggled closer to John, bleating softly as he started to drift to sleep.
"Hi mummy, it's John. I'm at my friend Sherlock's house for dinner... um... where do you live " He mouths at Sherlock. He repeats the address back over the phone. "You can call Winston at the house when you get home. Bye!" John hangs up and climbs onto the bench beside Sherlock, studying his experiments.
Fawnlock took a few more seconds to appreciate John's bare and then clothed bum, before he huffed softly and reached out for his book once more. After a few minutes of trying to get comfortable enough to read without his mate to lean against, the fawn huffed and looked about the nest.
John stopped as the fawn did, feeling a flush creep up the nape of his neck and darken his ears. He nodded quickly in agreement, unable to force himself to talk again for fear of embarrassing himself further. He frowned a bit as Fawnlock mentioned the opinions of other humans, and John stepped closer, gently reaching out to place a hand on the other's shoulder. "Well, they're all obviously idiots. I've never seen anything as brilliant as you my entire life." Unsure, he patted the shoulder softly before removing his hand and moving to continue walking, willing the blush away with every brisk step.
He waited till Fawnlock had rode out his orgasm, licking him clean and handling the oversensitive flesh gently as he rose up off of the fawn, wiping the edge of his mouth with the back of his hand. John climbed up till he was lying beside the fae, reaching over to gather him up into strong arms and hold him against John's chest.
Sherlock tilts his head, "Of course, John's my friend, why wouldn't I be nice?" He huffs slightly, crossing his arms. The wooden sword smacks his thigh hard but Sherlock ignores it.
"Wait, you're dating him?" A grin breaks out over his usually gloomy face, "I knew you fancied him!!" The younger Holmes giggles, turning to John, "I told you, didn't I?"
"I don't use magic or glamour to weave John." He explained, brows furrowed in puzzlement, before he took the leaves and began a base weave. His tongue poked out between his lips as his brows now furrowed in concentration.
Winston smiles at the young boys and hands Sherlock one of the tubes and removes the last few sheets of paper towel from the other and hands it to John.
"I know, but I can't help it... He gives me this wood then doesn't trust me with it after so long." Fawnlock huffed softly, nuzzling into John's palm, before placing a kiss there. He hummed softly, ears twitching.
Oh how he would have loved to lay here indefinitely under the timid touch of fingers, but he knew he would last long after all that.
Fawnlock pressed a line of kisses across John's injured shoulder, murmuring softly in his native language, whispering a soft blessing into John's skin through the jumper.
The fawn huffed softly, mostly over his annoyance towards the elder Fae, and sat up to fix his own cup, pouring the tea, adding a bit if sugar and drizzling honey into the cup, the stirring it all up and taking a sip.
John hummed happily, holding onto the fawn and being careful not to press to tightly to his front. The damp nose tickled, and he chuckled, tightening his fingers in the soft brown jumper draped over his mate's lean frame.
Ears flicking, Moosecroft murmured in a soft rumble as they walked, his cloak dragging around the forest floor behind him, stirring up dead leaves and half melted snowflakes.
He carefully picked up his violin and bow, moving to find its leather case. He soon found it, and carefully put the instrument away, stashing it by their packs. The Fae padded to a wall that seemed to be carved out to form a shallow set of shelves beside his nest, there were scrolls and old leather bound tomes lining them.
Sherlock shrugs, "I prefer the older Doctors, like Four, but eleven is pretty cool." He grins as he follows John, shoving his bumblebee, Bilbo, under some blankets.
Sherlock looks back to his brother and Mrs. Watson, expression slightly guarded until  he turns back to John, "Yes, I did." He presses his index finger to his lips. His precious bee named Bilbo is in the limo, inside his bag.
"You're equally important to me John, you're part of my herd, my wood, and my heart." He bleated softly after he mumbled this, speckled fingers curling against his love's back.
"Of course, loads, I haven't had so much fun in a long time." Sherlock smiles, curing up and pulling up a blanket around himself. "I'm happy we're friends, John." He grins, but unfortunately, Sherlock can't avoid sleep forever and his eyelids grow slightly heavy.
Greg huffs a chuckle, "Why thank you, you're not too bad at snogging yourself..." He nuzzles against Mycroft's jaw line.
John flushes red and looks down fidgeting with the shard in his hands, "Well yeah, I mean I try to. But school is boring and..." John pauses biting his lip, thinking about the bullies at his old school. Ever since Harry came out of the closet he'd been a target for being the dykey lesbian's freaky younger brother. "Well, I don't get much time to study with all the problems at my school."
He huffed softly, ears twitching and tail swishing, "There's no need to feel sad, John. What's in the past is in the past, I've put it behind me. Though things may come up now and again to remind me, I won't let it trouble me any longer. I may miss my Maman, but I have Mrs. Hudson to help, I may miss my father, but I'm patching this back together with Moosecroft. And I have you to remind me of a wonderful future." He murmured softly, the rumble vibrating through his chest as he reached out to turn the page, speckled digits twitching as they brushed over the rough paper.
Fawnlock rubbed his furred cheek against John's arm, he murmured softly in his native language, before speaking English, "I love you John, thank you for making a nest with me." He turned his head to press a kiss to John's skin.
I am SOOO sorry this has taken so long, I'll see how many more chapters I can post, but I've got a job now and I'm moving with my family, so no big promises.
The fawn's ears dropped slightly, "That was a warg, but there are other creatures you wouldn't see in most forests... Some dangerous as wargs some not or some even more dangerous.... You could probably find several mystical creatures in any wood, they're just hard to find." He murmured softly, "They usually avoid humans, but you've got a kind, brave heart, John, they'd trust you quicker then to other humans." The fawn carefully lays down, stretching out his long legs. John rolled onto his stomach and felt the crackle of dry leaves against his cheeks. He opened one eye and stared up at the fawn as he spoke of John being brave and kind. It made the blond feel warm all over, and he grinned, wriggling closer to the fae, letting the heat radiate off of both of them to keep warm.
