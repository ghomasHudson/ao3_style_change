“Sorry,” Tony winced before he stilled his hand, keeping it rested on Steve’s back for comfort. “I’m just trying to think of all of it, but it in a different way than what I would normally so I can hopefully have new possible solutions for you.”
Steve smiled faintly to himself as he ran his laps	. It was another sunny day and it made for a wonderful Friday.
“FRIDAY, remind me to check your circuits after the meeting.” Tony walked out his workshop. This was probably just a simple malfunction.
Steve stumbled their make-out session back inside. “Too far. Here’s fine,” He motioned his head over to the living area of the common floor without taking his hands off of Tony.
Steve, on the other hand, had a tad more trouble getting those wide shoulders of his into the car. By the time he settled himself in and buckled up, I was staring amused and watching the show.
He needed it all too much. Steve was there for hours before he exhausted himself and decided it would be better to retire for the night. Natasha would have sent him up before he could stray away from the punching bags.
Steve shrugged and had what appeared to be a bashful look on his face. “When I came out the ice, Fury had S.H.I.E.L.D. send over videos and articles on you and the others so I can familiarize myself. One of the videos was the one of you telling the press you wouldn’t sell weapons anymore, and I remember seeing you with a Burger King burger. I figured you liked the place,” He revealed with the bashful look growing more present on his face.
He breathed in deeply, shakily. He breathed out sharply. Now or never, right? It had been too long.
Doors began to open both in the upstairs of the building and down the hall he was in. Steve braced a hand on the wall to help himself stand again. Footsteps neared, and he braced himself in a fighting stance. He had dropped his knife and no longer had his shield with him – it was too far to attract to the magnets on his forearm.
The phone in Steve’s pocket buzzed again. He pulled it out with a small huff, expecting it to be Tony, but it was Natasha. That made Steve feel thrown off. She was supposed to be on her undercover mission. Either it was completed, or something went wrong.
Tony’s jaw tightened, and his posture straightened. FRIDAY definitely needed to be recalibrated. She was there when everything went down.
Loki was back to holding his nose, a pissed-off look on his face that turned into a sinister smirk as his gaze redirected to Steve. “Why don’t you ask your friend Steven here, huh? Why don’t you tell them about all those days you broke down—”
Steve leaned into the gentle touch, making sure he kept his gaze focused on Tony. “Honestly? I have no idea.”
Steve looked back over to the shore where Tony was. He was now messing around with sand. In fact, Tony was attempting to build a sand castle with wet and dry sand.
“So, you mentioned that on both the Thursday’s before, you and I were assigned the same mission on each day?” Tony asked to start a conversation back up. He moved closer to Steve and started to hook up some wires to him.
And just like that, the smoothness between us had a jagged edge that disrupted it.
Those words hovered in Steve’s mind before it settled with a warm hum in his chest.
Tony was startled at first by the kiss he didn’t see coming, but he kissed back once the moment of shock went away. His muscles untensed and he seemed to melt in Steve’s arms, finally coming to his senses. People stared for a couple reasons: it was two men who suddenly stopped and was kissing each other in the middle of the sidewalk, and they soon realized it was the one and only Tony Stark kissing Captain America.
Captain America all flustered over the idea of being with me.” He winked over in Steve’s direction before picking up his shirt.
Steve kept his arms around Tony, desperate to hold on for as long as he could. “It’s a long story. I’m just glad you're alive,” Steve replied with heavy relief as multiple emotions flashed over his face.
The only difference this time from the last couple of guns was how this one shot right through the armor and seemed to have vaporized a chunk of Tony’s torso.
“You look ridiculous in those bubbles,” Tony laughed as he slipped off the rest of his suit. “I fucked it up with the bubbles.”
Not that he’d ever mention that aloud.
And Steve still doesn’t know why either.
Steve nodded in response to Tony before he leaned back in the chair. “Having Bucky back was, for me, like having back a part of me that I thought was gone. I wasn’t the same when I came out of the ice. I was different. But Bucky, he was my friend. He helped me remember who I used to be.”
It was odd for Tony not to have come out of the suit yet, or even to not have popped open the face plate.
Okay, so what? They didn’t hold out on their word and kept being each other’s booty call. But it was nice, and they were both enjoying it. As long as neither of them were catching feelings, it was smooth sailing.
“Baby…” The term of endearment slipped off Tony’s tongue like it was made to be there. He squeezed Steve’s hands gently, not knowing if Steve wanted him closer or not. “You didn’t let me down…and not only because I don’t remember it,” Tony let go of Steve’s hands and cupped his face gently. “But because you still tried. Steve, I know you. You’re Captain America, and you’re also my best friend. The person I love. Who I can’t even possibly compare to because, come on, it’s me we’re talking about here.”
Steve had to shut his eyes to keep himself from losing control. Captain America shouldn’t have a dark side.
“Will do, sir.”
Steve took wide steps over, so he was by Tony’s side quicker. He braced his hand on the suit before he pulled it apart enough for Tony, who stepped out as soon as he could.
It started with the two each slowly pining for each other – for something more than just the physical intimacy. It’s because of that the two caught themselves in the midst of a relationship more than sex.
The hairs on the back of his neck stood up and he immediately grabbed his shield from his back. He was in a small hallway, and ahead of him was light coming through an open area that was to the side. Steve faintly heard the repulsors from outside, and it began to make the people that were ahead squirm.
Steve turned the stove off just as the elevator doors opened, and he was a little surprised to see Natasha tagging along with Rhodey.
“What?” Steve looked to meet Tony’s knowing eyes. “I’m…I’m not hiding anything…” He attempted to lie, but it was useless. Steve slumped his shoulders and leaned back into the couch in defeat. “Fine. I’ll tell you. And I guess it doesn’t really matter if things get weird, because I’ll be the only one to remember today anyways.”
Though once I walked back out to the car, he had lost his goddamn mind. Steve Rogers was in the
,” I groan as I shut my door. My legs felt funny being stretched out for the first time in a good few hours.
Steve shook his head with a smile before he finished off his coffee in one sip. “Well, I’m going down to the gym. You’re welcome to join.” He started to walk backwards to the door as he gave Tony his own teasing smirk, knowing Tony wasn’t one for a workout. Especially up to Captain America standards.
Steve had Tony.
They say never meet your childhood idols. Well, I never had the choice, did I? It was either walk away and be a dick or save the world. So, I saved the world and now
It must be a new record. Maybe it’s the prospect of a vacation, even if it isn’t technically a vacation. Heaven knows we both need one though. The whole team does, except Barton. He’s already away with his family.
It was a quiet ride. Steve only spoke up occasionally if he needed to say something, or he would politely answer me if I asked a question to try to start a conversation.
“I have to get going, but keep me updated, okay?” Sam gave Steve a concerned look as he held his hand out.
“Are any of them much of a threat?” Tony asked as he took a turn. He also didn’t want Steve’s mind to go into overdrive. “So, I know what I’m up against.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony smiled to himself as he zoomed through the streets. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’d taken an interest in what I do.”
I turn on my heel and walk off before he has a chance to answer.
Yeah, I know. I’m not exactly welcoming to the guy, but that’s who I am. The other team members get that, so why can’t he?
“Well I didn’t want you to be alone!” Tony argued back before his demeanor began to soften from his tense figure. He ran his fingers through his hair. “You worried me, okay? Normally you would have told me. And now you’re acting weird. Whatever it is you’re going through or whatever is happening, I thought I may be able to help.”
“You said you loved me,” Steve blurted out before he could change his mind. He blushed immediately then cleared his throat. “You were in my arms a-and you told me you love. It was kind of your last words…”
Steve ran his fingers through his hair. “Why, of all alien planets, would it be from Asgard?”
Steve nodded with pursed lips. “It’s hard to believe that it’s over after five months of it…” He sighed heavily. “I never will like Thursdays.”
“It is Asgardian,” Tony breathed out quietly. “It’s the same inscriptions that were on Loki’s staff.”
“You asked me if I wanted to spend the evening at your place and have dinner,” Steve replied carefully, trying to avoid letting out more than he wants to at the moment.
Tony stopped speaking, eyes closed, as if reliving the moment. Steve reached out a hand, placing it over the man’s arm. Tony opened his eyes at the touch, and turned, meeting Steve’s gaze.
Tony knew what he meant. He pulled his captured hand away only to press it firmly against Steve’s chest, protective and apologetic. “This has been our problem all along, hasn’t it? Arguing about one thing when what we really want to say is something else entirely.” It made sense, given their interactions. Tony knew he’d been a bit head over heels for Steve from the start, but it just seemed like the two of them had never been given enough time to just....be. Never had the right moment to feel it all out, let themselves decide.
“Okay,” Tony repeated back before turning back to the door.
“I’m not jealous,” he shot back, taking a long drink from his water bottle. They’d just finished one of their weekly sparring sessions, which, as always, ended with Steve’s back to the floor and eyes on the ceiling. This week he noticed a new burn mark, and he made a mental note to remind whoever was on cleaning duty that they did have teammates who could fight on the ceiling if they wanted to.
“Your team is much more observant than you think,” Tony explained, moving that much closer. Steve didn’t try to move away. “Technically, it was Sam’s idea, but....”
“I’ll have Friday send you the location,” he said, checking his watch. Pepper was sure to come looking for him any minute now. “Guess I’ll see you soon?”
Tony frowned mid-thought, hand resting on something much bulkier than his Starkphone. He looked at the silver mound in his hand, the small screen on top displaying only the time, and any excitement he felt instantly vanished.
It was Steve’s turn to be surprised, but after a moment, he took it in stride, meeting Tony’s advances with his own. It was a bit awkward at first, but eventually they found a rhythm, and Steve couldn’t stop himself from pushing closer to Tony, wanting more, hand moving from his thigh to up and over his hip, gripping as he maneuvered the man to a better angle. His other hand found its way to the side of Tony’s face before moving back into his hair, gripping tight.
“You look ridiculous.”
“Bye, Tony,” Natasha said as he walked away, waiting until the man was out of side before rounding on Steve, expression scolding. “What the hell was that, Rogers?”
Tony wasn’t a fan of where this conversation was going. “Steve, look, it’s in the past, okay? I get it.”
Tony couldn’t stop himself from asking. “Promise?
“I thought you moved?”
Tony tried not to remember, but the shattering glass and half growled curses had brought it all back. He’d lost everything that day. Everyone. Well, he’d still had Rhodey. Pepper and Bruce. Yet, for some reason, it hadn’t felt like enough.
“Not a priority?” Steve asked, leaning forward in his seat. “We’ve seen the damage the Hulk can do, and how easily he can be turned against us.” Wanda dipped her chin at that, eyes down, and Steve felt a moment of remorse for bringing up the reminder. “So, if you’re going to be a part of this team, which is why I assume you’re here, what’s the fail safe? Or did you just think everything would work out, like with Ultron?”
Steve did as he was told. God, he looked like a child getting scolded. Tony took the few steps forward until Steve was looking down on him, as visible as it could be in the dark. They watched each other for a while, neither moving, before Tony continued.
“Actually, there’s....there’s something else I didn’t tell you. Didn’t tell anyone, actually. Other than Fury, which is even weirder to say out loud, but, well. Something happened before Ultron. At the base in Sokovia, when I found Loki’s scepter, I...I saw something. A vision, I guess,” Tony said, and allowed himself a moment to laugh at the unintended pun. Steve was more focused on the way he shifted where he sat, gaze going distant, as if remembering. “It felt like I was looking into some kind of future, our future. But everything was wrong, and the team was...So I rushed over to you, and you weren’t moving, and I reached out but you stopped me and you said--”
“I just wanted to make sure you were okay,” he said, eventually, and it was such a quiet, heartfelt confession that Tony was surprised by his need to hide it. “And I also wanted to apologize, about what I said--”
Steve just kept staring, before he dropped his head onto Tony’s shoulder. “I’ll make it up to you. I swear. Whatever it takes. However long it takes. Tony, I...”
“Presume this then,” Tony prompted, slow and pronounced. He wanted to make Steve was hanging on his every word, if only so they would get through his ridiculously thick skull. Must be an effect of the serum.  “Steven Grant Rogers, I am ridiculously in love with you. And I would appreciate it oh so much it if you’d just stop talking and get on with fucking me into tomorrow. Please.”
Tony looked down, annoyed at being interrupted mid-kiss. “You do realize I haven’t needed it for, like, years, right?”
“Shit.” Tony pulled his hand from the water, face tilted toward the sky. His expression was grim yet resolved. “I am so fucked.”
“Do you know how long I...” Steve started, words seeming to fall out of him before morphing into a contented sigh.
Steve raised a brow. “You go there often?”
Natasha searched Steve’s face a moment, before closing her eyes with a nod. “Right. Well, like the man said, you’re sweaty, and so am I. Hit the showers. Pizza for lunch?”
Steve wasn’t surprised by that. The lab at the tower was always a mess, whenever Steve had walked through it. “I bet.”
Steve raised his head, uncurling from his seat on the porch steps. He’d been leaning against the railing, head hung low and shield laid gently against his legs. When Tony said his name, he picked it up and looked over it in the darkness.
Any other time, Tony would have argued, but there was no fight left in him. Right now, all he wanted to do was keep Steve close for as long as possible. “Okay,” he breathed, tearing his gaze from Steve’s.  “Mind helping me up?”
Steve let those words sink in a moment, looking down at Tony’s hand and back up. “Oh,” he said aloud, stupidly, and Tony only smiled.
He cleared his throat a moment, finding a steady tone. “What did she want anyway?” he asked, hoping to change the subject.
Steve followed his gaze, realizing what he was looking at, and quickly lifted his top hand. “Sorry.”
“Sorry,” Tony said, hands coming down to smooth over his shirt, as if inspecting him. “Just needed to make sure.”
“Nat—“
, he told himself, before raising his cold hand to rest over his chest. Breathed in deep. Released.
“What are you doing here?” Steve had to ask, even when he knew it came out more like an accusation than a genuine question.
“Thought you two broke up?” Steve asked, earning him a stern glare from Natasha.
Tony was understandably scared shitless when the phone rang.
Tony sighed, stopping just outside the door. So much for needing privacy. “Natasha.”
Tony dramatically pondered this before shrugging. He ran a hand through Steve’s hair as he spoke. “I mean, I probably should? Don’t get me wrong, most of the time you make it very easy for me to not like you. But I don’t think I can say much since I know I’ve given you plenty of reasons to not like me, too.”
Tony couldn’t stop himself as he pulled Steve close enough to lean into, wasn’t content until he could feel the other against him, warm and alive and breathing.
“Are you free anytime soon?” The words tumbled out before he could stop them, a wall against whatever Steve was about to say. Whatever he was about to admit in that damned pitying voice of his. “I have something for you. A gift. Well, more like a regift since I’m honestly just returning it, but, well...” Steve hadn’t interrupted yet, so Tony figured he was doing okay. “What do you say? Think you can stand to be in my presence long enough for a quick meet and greet?”
Tony felt a thrill at the implication and settled in for however long they had left before morning. “Night, Cap,” he affirmed, tasting the nickname on his tongue like it was the first; like it suddenly felt new and oh so right. “Make sure you dream of me.”
It wasn’t a good memory and Tony wished himself anywhere but there.
“What? For fucking me so thoroughly I couldn’t even remember my own name when you asked if I was okay? Because no apology is needed for that. Unless you tell me we can’t do it again.”
For starters, he had touched the time stone. It was kind of broken. Strange said it had been tearing at reality, but Tony didn’t really know what that meant. Was it destroying their reality? No, everything still seemed to be in place. Perhaps opening portals to other worlds? So far he’d only been on Earth. And this wasn’t the future. It felt more like memories at this point, like he was reliving his past...
“Monopolize my time?” Tony interrupted, leaning even closer to Steve, one hand reaching out to rest along his arm, gentle. “Have my complete and undivided attention? Because I’ll let you in on a secret: you have it. You always do.”
Steve stared, blinking, and then laughed, genuine and soft. “You’re impossible.”
Tony looked to Steve, a bit helpless, and Steve just smiled, dropping his hand to Tony’s bicep, squeezing firmly “Go. I’ll meet you down there.”
Natasha shrugged. “It’s the only thing everyone can agree on. But I’ll ask around.”
Steve shook his head, feigning disappointment but unable to hide his growing smile. “Yes, sir,” he said, and planted his hands on either side of Tony’s head before thrusting forward, earning him another appreciative groan.
Tony watched in awe as Steve took out two speeding Chitauri mid-air before catching the shield to reflect a blast from behind. A jet like sound filled the street and Tony looked up to see the Iron Man suit descending, blasting Chitauri as it did.
Tony smiled, hand fidgeting with the cap on the island. “Yeah. Guess I’d have noticed if you were making trips to his place, considering.”
Steve wasn’t following. “What were you trying to fix?”
Steve looked up from his holopad. He was sitting in one of the meeting rooms, going over the afternoon’s mission. There’d been an explosion in an apartment complex, and the fire was growing too fast for local firefighters to maintain. The team had been called in personally to secure both the building and the people inside.
Steve only looked at the shield, hands remaining firmly at his side. He suddenly looked very tired. “Tony, I--” He met Tony’s gaze. Tried again. “Thank you. I mean it.” Tony only jumped a little when Steve stepped forward to take it, running one of his own hands over the edge before smiling, appreciative. “I don’t really know what to say.”
“How about I just build you a time machine instead, and you can fuck off to the forties where you and dad were such good friends,” Tony asked, chest tightening. “That way you can play soldier and argue over who gets to ‘fondue’ Peggy all you want.”
Steve’s flustered expression easily grew into full on panic. Overloading. “Christ, Tony, you can’t just—“  Slowly, but surely, however, after some more stuttering, it settled into a timid yet growing want. Which then turned  into some rationalizing, eyes calculating. Tony knew he was looking for an excuse. “I mean, as much I would love to—and I really, really want to-- we don’t really have...”
“Okay, so, definitely jealous,” Natasha observed, walking over to Steve’s side.
“Please,” Steve said almost too quickly, but Tony only laughed before pulling himself close.
“No?” Tony asked, pushing away from the island, feigning shock. “Well, that just might be a first.” He waved a hand when Steve tried to argue, suddenly apologetic. “Sorry. You’re right. Civility really isn’t our forte, huh? Nevermind. Here, look.” He walked through the open kitchen, passing Steve to grab the thing he’d leaned against the couch.
“He’s been better.” Natasha’s voice dripped with sincerity, and he felt his chest tighten. “You should talk to him.”
Steve closed his eyes, running a hand through his hair, looking lost. That was new. “You know we can’t.”
As if agreeing, Steve yawned, and turned more onto his side, cradling Tony to him. “Okay. See you in the morning?”
Tony’s phone rang then, and they both looked down towards the sound.
“Fucking hell,” Tony breathed, running a hand over his face.
“Hurting you.” Steve’s head hung low, ashamed. “You should hate me.”
Natasha stared hard at Steve, before turning around. “No,” she said sweetly, no semblance of her previous anger to be found. It reminded Steve of just how terrifying the woman could be. “Water’s on the bottom shelf, if Sam remembered to restock it.”
“Well, maybe somebody should be,” Steve shot back, meeting Tony without hesitation. “God, Tony, you always do this. You run blindly into these things you don’t know, don’t fully understand, and then you get hurt. Sometimes even at the expense of other people.” He rubbed at his face, other hand now on his hip, frustrated. “At least Howard took the time to listen to what other people told him before he acted.”
“You told me I could have saved you,” Tony admitted finally, the words sounding as if they had to have been torn from his throat, raspy and raw. “And I just, I didn’t know what to do. I was so scared, and then it all just disappeared. And then Ultron happened, and I realized you were right. I could have saved you, all of you, but instead I just keep...”
Tony looked around a moment, gaze lingering over the sparse furniture. “I’ve got to say, I’m surprised by the modernity. Always pegged you as an antique knick-knack kind of guy.”
Tony smiled, looking amused. His eyes met Steve’s briefly before looking away.
Tony hadn’t felt the initial sting of his hand when it made contact with Steve’s face. When he did, it was already hanging between the two of them, suspended in disbelief as the two of them stared at each other, eyes widening.
“Tony?”
“I’m sorry,” he said. More tears fell from his eyes, but he didn’t care. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know…”
“Okay, look.” He tried again, realizing he was going to have to be frank with Steve. Regretfully honest. “I don’t really think it’s any of your business, but the past few weeks have been a bit rough for me. And I may have fallen back into some....less than savory habits? But it’s not like we were involved or anything before all of this, so why would I think it mattered if I--” Steve’s face was a mixture of hurt and regret, and Tony couldn’t stop from hating himself for it. “God, don’t look at me like that. It happened, it’s in the past. I’m here now. With you. That’s all that matters. Yeah?”
“I’m not jealous,” Steve repeated, wondering how many times he’d need to say it before Natasha let it go. Natasha took a step closer to him, expression shifting from amused to concerned in his silence. “I’m just...I don’t know. Worried? I’m afraid I said something during Ultron and Tony’s, you know, taking it to heart.”
Curiosity had always been his weakness, his Achilles heel composed of science, technology, and reason. It was almost impossible for him to be presented with something foreign and powerful and not crave what lay beneath; its secrets to be exposed and rebuilt under his own two hands. So when Stephen Strange had asked him to temporarily house a cracked time stone that kept ripping holes in reality, well, he really couldn’t be blamed for touching the damn thing, now could he?
The pause that followed was only a little concerning. “He’s a bit..indisposed at the moment.“ Okay, maybe more than a little. “I just wanted to see if it actually worked.”
Tony raised a brow, pulling back his hand as his frustration grew. “God, why do you always have to do this? You always want to be the martyr, the one who lays it all on the line. For once, why can’t you just let me fight for the things I want? Why can’t you just trust me?”
“Sorry,” he said, finally finding his breath and inhaling. Exhaling slowly. “It’s nothing. I’m fine. We’re fine. See?” He wrapped his hands around Steve’s neck, and tried a smile.
Tony wasn’t able to speak right away. Wasn’t sure he even could.
God, was he even time traveling anymore? Or was he just fucking everything up? Had he changed the timeline? Entered an alternate universe? His head ached with the possibilities, and he pulled at his hair. “Get a grip, Stark. Just think. Take in your surroundings. There has to be something here—“
Tony only had time to pull the dusty covers off some idle furniture and open a few windows before he heard the soft purr of an engine outside.
“Only because it’s true,” Natasha shot back before walking away. Steve only watched her a moment before pressing the button for the elevator.
Tony leaned in closer, eyes narrowed. “Oh? And why’s that? Last time I checked, Rogers, you weren’t my dad.”
And Tony did. He knew it was one of the reasons he’d ever a chance of being here with Steve in the first place. “Then I don’t get why it’s so hard for you to understand that I can’t hate you either. Very much the opposite in fact. And might I add your eyes are impossibly more gorgeous up close.”
“What the hell was that?”
Tony swallowed as he felt his knees go weak “I only need three.”
When he’d poked the stone with a piece of scrap metal left in his pocket, he hadn’t expected the thing to glow so fucking bright, his head pounding like his brain was banging around freely in the Iron Man suit. He also hadn’t expected to end up on the streets of New York, vacant except for the Chitauri running rampant while the Avengers scurried after them.
“Well,” Tony said, looking down at his hand still curled around Steve’s wrist, held in place by Steve’s other hand. “Obviously not, but, well, I guess now I do, huh?”
“Nothing I can’t handle,” was Steve’s easy reply.
Panic overwhelmed him, and he closed his eyes again. But all he could see was Steve, bloodied and still. Himself broken and lost inside the compound. God, he wanted to go home. He wanted to go back to New York, or to the tower. He so desperately wanted to be anywhere but where he was.
As he followed Tony out into the hall, Steve realized Natasha had been wrong.
Natasha was quiet as she slowed her steps, halting their walk in the hall. “Have you talked to him about it?”
Tony only raised a brow. “You really think she doesn’t already know? I’d honestly be surprised if she hasn’t already figured out a way to override my own override. But, well, spies. What are you going to do?”
Tony whined at the loss of contact it caused. “Steve...” He didn’t have time to say anymore as Steve kissed him again, fierce and wanting. His hands wrapped around Tony’s waist, cradling him close as he tipped Tony backward and onto the bed.
Tony dropped it quickly, unable to watch the flutter of emotions flickering through Steve’s gaze as he did.
He’d hated himself then for being so weak, for allowing himself to crumble so easily onto the floor of a man who thought so little of him. Allowed himself to drink until he couldn’t feel the bruises or see the desperate anger in those bright, blue eyes.
“Just like that,” Tony repeated, shoving his hands in his pockets. He took a few steps forward, hating how close Steve was to the door now. How close he was to leaving again. “Listen, I’ve been talking to Ross. The UN realizes the Avengers are only an asset when we’re a working unit. Cohesive. Right now, we’re just one half of a whole. I’m even working on getting Barnes cleared, and that’s become a hell of a lot easier with Zemo in custody, so I just thought....”
“Okay,” Tony interrupted, stepping in between Bruce and Steve, clapping his hands together. He caught Steve’s gaze, and Steve leaned back, knowing the look for what it was. “Enough chit-chat. Let’s just get straight to testing, yeah? That’s always been the more interesting part of these kinds of things anyway. Sam, Vision, do you mind lending a hand?”
Steve considered the question, before realizing there were too many answers to choose from. “What?”
“Tony?”
When Steve did pull away, he kept a strong arm wrapped around Tony. The other reached up to cradle Tony’s hand that still ran through his hair. He pressed it gently against his own cheek, eyes closed. The warmth of Steve’s skin seeped into Tony’s cold hand.
Tony felt a twinge of hurt at the implication. “You planning to escape?”
Steve threw her a look, but let it go. She wasn’t wrong.
Natasha maneuvered him easily through the lab, making sure he didn’t fall even as he turned one final glance over his shoulder.
“You could have just called,” Steve pointed out. Why make the trip at all? They all had been gifted new Stark phones only a few months back. Seemed strange to not put them to use, especially given the drive form the tower to the compound.
“Well, maybe if you didn’t just talk over people all the time and listened to them every once in a while,” Steve exclaimed, gestures a bit more animated, anger growing. "God, you can be so infuriating sometimes.”
“No, it’s not,” Steve argued, letting the shield now fall to the wayside, focusing only on Tony. “I don’t want to say things that hurt you, Tony, especially when they aren’t true. I don’t want to lie to you.  Not anymore.”
Steve froze, turning on Tony slowly. “What?”
The sun was quickly setting when Tony left, the last stretches of light throwing shadows as he walked. The path around the lake was clear enough to see, however, so he followed it. His pace was quick, and he felt like every part of him was coiled up into this tight mass of rage. But just beneath that rage was the aching hurt he still felt at Steve’s words.
“I was just....worried. About you,” Steve tried, thinking of some way to explain that whatever Tony was reading into wasn’t what he thought it was. Was it?
“Hey,” Tony interrupted, calling Steve’s trailing thoughts back to him. To just the two of them. “What did I just say? We can’t change the past. But you know what we can do? We can shape the future. And I’m really hoping my future consists of you kissing me a lot more than you have in the last ten minutes.”
“In my car,” Tony explained, nonchalant. His hands smoothed out where they’d grasped Steve’s shirt, dragging slow. Maybe a little teasing. “Whatever you’re thinking we need, I have it. Don’t you know a Stark always comes prepared?”
Tony dipped his gaze, hand now in Steve’s hair, distracted. “Didn’t think I needed one.”
Tony thought that made sense. He pulled away from Steve, but remained unable to look away from those bright, blue eyes. They weren’t filled with rage anymore, only a lingering fondness Tony couldn’t allow himself to read into. Not anymore. “I think I changed something. In the past. I—“
Iron Man’s faceplate turned his way, and for a moment Tony wondered if he’d heard him, if he could see himself standing to the side, desperate and broken and warning him to stop while he could, to stop breaking everything they’d worked so hard to achieve.
“I’m not jealous,” was all Steve could get out before tearing his arm away and leaving the room. Tony said something as he did so, but he didn’t stop to listen. He was too busy quieting the pounding in his chest, and the roaring in his ears.
“I’m in fucking space,” he breathed, incredulous, and slowly sank down to the floor, knees pulled up as he pressed his head into his hands. “Fucking space.” This wasn’t real, couldn’t be real. He’d never actually been to space before. Not unless those few moments in New York counted.
Maybe Natasha was right. Maybe he was jealous.
Steve put the holopad down, leaning back in his seat. He was still dressed in his uniform, cowl pushed off his face. It smelled like smoke. “He broke the perimeter. Strayed from formation.”
Steve took the words to heart. “You really thought I wouldn’t let you?”
“Screw the compound,” Tony said almost too quickly, fingers aching from how tightly he was holding the phone now. “I mean, I get it. Not very inconspicuous, it? But what about somewhere else? The tower?”
Steve shook his head, eyes landing on the uncapped bottle. Unable to meet Tony’s gaze for some reason. “Hard to fight with someone when you never see them,” he joked, hoping to move past the question.
“I do,” Tony piped in, casual.
Later, after Steve had fucked Tony into the mattress more than once and turned him into a writhing, whining mess that the tabloids of his past would have had a field day with, those three little words seemed to creep over them once again, soft and sweet.
Tony kept his hand on the door as he opened it, not bothering to turn around. “I don’t know,” he admitted finally and made sure to slam the door on the way out.
His next breath came out like a puff of smoke, and a sharp chill rushed over him. He felt wind picking up, and turned around in time to see snow falling quietly around him. The compound was gone, likely thousands of miles from where he was, and in its place was a door, large and obvious against the rocky, snow covered tundra. He only hesitated a moment before going inside.
Tony brought Bruce to the compound.
“I thought fugitives were supposed to be all about laying low,” Tony teased, eyeing the bike appreciatively. He’d stopped at the edge of the porch, unable to will himself any further. As petty as it was, he wanted Steve to come to him.
For a moment, Tony could almost pretend there was genuine concern in those words. “As alright as it can be, I suppose. Given the circumstances.” He hadn’t meant to let the implications lie, yet there they were, exposed.
, Tony reminded himself, repeated it over and over until that small, stupid part of him believed it.
“Tony,” Steve groaned, free hand laid over his own face, hiding. “I already said I’m sorry.”
Tony turned away, crouching down, curling in on himself.
Steve was silent a long time before realization seemed to dawn on him. “Wait, you’re in love with me?”
Tony couldn’t pretend that didn’t sting. “And sometimes you can be so goddamn stubborn. I take it all back. I really don’t know what my dad saw in you that was so fucking great.”
He wasn’t sure if time in the present passed differently while traveling through time. He’d hoped it hadn’t been long. And if it had been, Strange would surely have come looking for him by now, right?
Steve hesitated a bit, voice quieter. “Tony, I--”
“Stop,” Tony heard himself say out loud, an outstretched hand reaching for them, grasping for some control over the situation. “Stop it,” he said even louder, this time moving to drop down the concrete curve. God, he wanted to run over and shake himself. Couldn’t he see what he was doing? He was going to destroy everything. He was so close to ruining one of the only good things in his life-- “Stop!”
Tony grabbed him before he got too far, fingers curling around his wrist. “How do you know? How can you be sure it won’t happen? That it wasn’t some fucked up version of the future that I helped create? That I could have prevented?”
Tony said nothing for a while, before looking up at Steve, meeting his gaze and holding it for the few seconds Steve allowed.
“Just give me a minute,” Tony whined, stuttering in his next drop when he felt Steve settle inside him just so. “I just, ah, need to get adjusted...Mmmm, it’s kind of been--” His next words died when Steve moved unexpectedly, groaning beneath. “It’s been a while.”
“No, wait.” Tony quickly pressed his hands into Steve’s shirt, reeling him back in. Again. “I didn’t mean it like that. Just, I’m not going anywhere. No rush.”
“That’s the one. So what do you say? Up for a trip to the lake?” Tony could only wait a short moment before trying again. “Steve?”
He stumbled stupidly upon entry, half twisting in an attempt to close the door behind him as he went, but instead of being shoved into a wall or rack of hangers, he was in the middle of the kitchen of the Avengers Compound. He turned around once, and then again, before he realized there was no closet in sight. No door he’d come in through. Running a hand through his hair, he moved around the island bar slowly, listening for footsteps or voices. But none came, and only then did he notice the sun was already setting.
“No it’s not,” Steve cut in, voice louder now, angry. Tony couldn’t stop himself from flinching, arms now raised in defense, and that seemed to break Steve even more. “God, look at you. Even now you’re scared of me. Of what I might do to you.”
Steve’s eyes narrowed, shoulders tensing. “Is that a threat, Romanoff?”
Steve tensed, still looking down. He hadn’t even realized Sam had left the compound until he’d caught a glimpse of the man stepping out of Tony’s car. The heavy thing in his chest reappeared, squeezing tight.
Steve stood his ground, arms now crossed. Expectant. “Just thought what?”
“So, you’re jealous?”
Natasha watched Steve a moment before sighing, arms dropping. “Get some rest, Rogers,” was all she said before leaving, tone final, and the sound of the metal door whooshing close behind her echoed in the room.
Tony awoke the next morning to sunlight pouring over his face, and he groaned unhappily before burying himself further into the rumpled sheets. His body ached and his head begged him for caffeine, but the bed was still warm and comfortable, and the firm presence at his back was enough to lull him back into a light sleep.
Steve smiled politely at that, and watched as Tony didn’t leave. Instead, he made his way across the room and sat down on the bed beside Steve. He didn’t look at him, however. Instead, he just stared straight ahead, as if observing the wall in front of them.
He felt the phone press against his leg as he shifted, the fear and guilt now clawing their way up his throat. He pulled it out, unthinking, and flipped it open. He wanted to call Steve, needed to call him, and make sure he was okay, that he was alive and that it wasn’t Tony’s fault if he wasn’t. But the screen was black, no sign of life as he clicked at the numbers, closed and reopened it again and again.
Tony felt all of his muscles unclench at the word, and he leaned his head back until it hit the wall, eyes closed.
Tony kicked at the ground, letting out a cry of frustration as he scattered small rocks and leaves. The trees were almost bare now, and a quick flash of holidays and Christmas popped into his mind.
Tony felt his newly formed walls crumble all over again. “Christ.” He rubbed a hand over his face before walking forward to push the shield aside. “No, I’m not. But neither are you.”
Tony wasn’t sure how long he’d been gone, but he did know he felt better now, calmer. Until he saw Steve again.
Tony closed his eyes against the thought, burying his face into crossed arms as he pulled his knees tightly to his chest. This couldn’t be real. None of this was. How could it be? He wasn’t dead. Steve wasn’t dead. This was all a lie, a trick. He wanted to go home, to his own time. He needed to go back. He had to go back.
“Maybe not aloud,” Natasha admitted, and Steve couldn’t hold her gaze, giving her the fuel to keep going. “You’re compromised, Rogers. And now it’s bleeding into everything, including the team.”
Steve sent Tony a done look that could be easily perceived as
Tony lifted his head and looked over Steve’s face to see if he was being honest. “Alright,” He sighed before he pulled himself away from Steve. “I can’t remember the last time I’ve been to the beach anyways.” He waved off, not wanting to admit he was agreeing because he had a soft spot for Steve.
“I’m sorry,” Steve choked out with his face in Tony’s hair. Steve was sorry for many reasons, mainly for getting Tony killed and for pissing him off by waking him up so early. It wasn’t even seven in the morning.
After a couple requests on my first chapter, I decided to write a second! I know it took me four months, but I've been busy and exhausted from school and work. Please enjoy some closure! I know Tony will.
I wanted it to be on my terms. Not theirs.
Music blared out from speakers set all around their section of the park. It was a warm night, and there were fireworks in the distance that the guests were able to see.
He spoke it so casually, but those words pushed on me until I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I don’t think he understands how much of a compliment that is for me.
Steve huffed and pulled the wires off his body before he stood. “Then I’ll start doing things differently. I need to try to figure out the purpose. Whoever is doing this to me has to have some sort of purpose.”
How could one little plastic card possibly hold all of his money?
Steve took a step back from the close proximity, flashbacks from last night replaying in his head. “Okay, now you can see I’m perfectly fine. You can fly back off and let me think.”
He set his jaw and glanced around at the four men, one cradling his nose with a fancy gun in the other hand. “So, who wants to go first?” Steve asked as he sized up the men.
“Well you know me, I’m everything but personal,” I chuckle. “I guess you don’t really know me though. You aren’t around me enough,” I ponder on once I realize what I said.
Steve stood there as Tony rambled, and he took in Tony’s appearance in the golden light from the setting sun. He had worn a suit that day, but his suit jacket was off. He didn’t realize Tony was waiting for an answer until he spoke again.
Steve’s face did the thing where he looked closed off again. Shit. Did I cause that? “No,” He replied sharply, his shoulders ten times more tense than they had been during breakfast. “I said I keep myself busy. I apologize if my schedule doesn’t line up with your leisure time, Stark.”
“I’m certainly not complaining,” Tony responded with a wink and a smirk paired together. This time Steve blushed, like always, but it accompanied with a sweet smile. Even though Tony didn’t remember the history they had together, Steve did. And the little flirts and compliments warmed Steve up to his core – more than coffee ever could.
It wouldn’t be the first time someone gave me the cold shoulder just because of my father.
Tony immediately looked down to his chest and his eyes widened before he tore his shirt off with a wince. “Fuck-! It fucking burned me!” He exasperated.
“Yeah?” Steve smiled a bit before he began to walk to the meadow. “This was here 70 years ago. It was one of the only places around that didn’t change when I woke up.”
“Yes, I am into guys,” Steve mused as he watched Tony. “I was before the ice, too. History just never recorded that part.”
“What else could I possibly do? Not only is it like trying to find a needle in a haystack,” Steve paused to send a sharp look over to Tony. “That you cannot burn to quicken the process – by the way – but there’s a magical being trying to stop me.”
Steve unplugged the drain before he reached for his towel as Tony was already drying off. “I feel like I’m just going to crash once my head hits that pillow,” Tony laughed as he walked to the sink with his towel around his waist.
Tony bit his lip for a moment before he got out and followed Steve over to the building. “What’s the plan? Usually you have one.”
Steve chuckled as he pulled on some pajama pants. “I think it sounds good. And healthy. So, I’ll make some for us when I wake up tomorrow,” He replied then got in the bed.
I roll my eyes. “Yes, Steve. I know they had cars in the forties. Not the best ones, but they did the job.” I tap my fingers against the door’s arm rest then decides to put on my seat belt.
His cheeks, as if by nature now, turned its light shade of pink as he smiled. “Oh. Good. At least I was close to remembering.”
I smile a little to myself before I look up to the waiter, ordering my food with a cup of coffee. Steve does the same before he sets our menus aside where they were.
“Really?” Steve laughed, his head tilting back slightly. “I haven’t gotten the chance to see him yet.”
Tony laughed softly before he nodded in agreement. “At this point? Yeah, I’d be surprised too.”
He let out a breath and rolled his shoulders before he positioned himself, throwing his first punch. Then another. And another.
Clint even called us out on it one day by saying we bicker like an old married couple. Which I, by the way, didn’t appreciate nor did Steve.
Steve clutched his shield tightly as his ears stopped ringing. There was a creak from the stairs area, and he didn’t hesitate to throw his shield in the direction. He heard what sounded like a body hit the floor.
That someone was Steve.
Steve went to speak against it before Tony held his hand up to stop him.
Tony took the medicine before he trudged into the living room with a grumpy face. He was tired and hungover and not expecting Steve Rogers to still be in his suite. “What the fuck?”
“Shit,” Tony rubbed a hand over his face. Steve was about to let go, beginning to feel discouraged, but then Tony spoke again. “I can’t believe I’m actually going with this.”
“Ton…y,” Steve caught himself before he slipped up again. “Of course we’re friends, and of course we’ve gotten closer. I just—” He pressed his lips into a line. “I couldn’t come to you with this. Just accept that.”
It made Steve’s head ache as well as his heart. He closed his eyes tightly before he gritted his teeth and threw another punch at the punching bag without looking, knowing already where it was hanging from. Something was off though. Before Steve heard the thud from it hitting the floor, he heard a person’s pained grunt then the thud.
“So, you just happen to almost always hang out with the team only when I’m not there then?” I counter back, stopping in front of the car and turning to stare accusingly at him. Damn was he tall.
“FRIDAY, override.” Tony stood from his workstation chair and wiped his hands on a rag.
His head was facing forward and there wasn’t the best lighting, but I could swear his cheeks turned that light shade of pink
Tony grinned at that before he gave a shrug. “The party last night was more for Steve as a surprise party than for the Fourth of July. We kissed in the car before we got out to meet everyone else.”
“They better be damn special,” He grumbled out loud. Of course, FRIDAY didn’t answer. He missed Jarvis.
“Yes, sir. Surprisingly, he’s been in there all night. The first time in weeks, sir,” He replied exactly the same as yesterday, which made Steve’s brows furrow together before he shrugged it off and went on his run to the park.
“I don’t think it was truly necessary for you to make that comment though,” Steve scolded lowly as we neared the room. “But it was also inappropriate for him to be doing what he was when he’s supposed to be working.”
Steve got up and showered off the grim that he felt was still on him from last night before he went to his kitchen. He couldn’t bear to go on the same mission again today, and he couldn’t be normal around Tony yet.
Steve answered immediately, fearing it was the latter.
“Yes, I am, and yes I do. Keep up your good work.” I give him a small nod with a smile before I turn my attention back to Steve. “Anyways, as I was saying, I sleep like a baby.”
Steve’s eyes were now fully on Tony, wanting to pull him close and never let go. Not for any reason. “I was never truly alone,” His voice was low and soft, so Tony had to strain to hear it. “I always had you. Tony, you were like my anchor. If I didn’t have you, I would not be sane at the moment. And I certainly would not have figured it out on my own.”
I chuckle then finally pulls out the garage and onto the road. Only thirty-five hours to go, and that doesn’t include the time it’ll take for stops.
“Come on. Either way, I’m hungry.” I pat Steve on the shoulder before I lead the way inside. There weren’t many people in there for the morning, which I was thankful for. Even though we didn’t have to worry about being caught in public or have to try to hide, it was still nice to not have to worry about a restaurant full of people.
When Steve saw Sam collapse in exhaustion at the same tree, he slowed to a stop along with Sam. “Nothing like another sunny day for a run, huh?” He breathed out.
with his seat belt on.

But to back up:
Tony watched Steve completely bewildered. “Steve, you’re kinda worrying me. I mean, alien guns? What, are they Asgardian or something?” He joked.
“Yes, sir. Surprisingly, he’s been in there all night. The first time in weeks, sir,” He responded in his formal tone. Anyone can hear the utter surprise in the tone, and Steve couldn’t help the way his lips curved up in a smile.
Steve poured everything into the kiss. He didn’t know how long the day was going to last, and he didn’t want to waste any of it.
“There’s five of them. By this time, they’re probably still huddled around each other in the dining room discussing drop-offs and deliveries. You know, chatter of that matter.” Steve stared hard out the window, his hands clutched tightly on his knees. He was trying hard to contain all of his anger, all of his rage, all of his heartache. If he was right – and he had a hopeful feeling he was – then he would no longer be waking up on Thursday, April 24. It would finally be the Friday he’s been longing for.
Tony flirted with Steve.
Steve looked out to the water before he took off his jacket, then preceded to take off his clothes. Tony eyed Steve curiously, totally not checking Steve out in the process.
Steve sighed before he pulled on his cowl and secured it. “Stay out of this one, Tony. It’s for your own safety.” His voice was everything serious, and Tony tapped his foot on the floor.
I pick up a stray screw to throw at Rhodey, but he was already dashing up the stairs to escape it. He knew me too well.
Tony took a deep breath as he neared the conference room doors. “This is going to be painful,” He muttered to no one as he stood in front of the two doors. He was about to relive the past couple years all over again when he’s been trying his hardest to block out every part of by busying himself with new technology and helping the spider-kid.
Tony had lowered his hands since Thor was now in the room, but he tried to keep his guard up. Though he turned his full attention to Steve, a look on his face that meant he knew what Loki was getting at. “Steve…” His voice sounded burdened.
“Birthdays have been complicated for me. First, I was focused on surviving asthma and any allergies that got to me. Then, when I was 21, I got the serum. At that point, I got more focused on surviving and winning the war,” The crowd had been quiet as he spoke, but there were soft cheers as he mentioned the war.
“It sets the tone,” Shrugged Tony before he laughed. “And I’m proud of you for knowing the genre,” Tony sounded truly impressed. “Have you been catching up finally?”
Steve’s eyes followed Tony until they couldn’t anymore. He downed the rest of his godly alcohol before he made his own way towards the elevators on the wall. Using that elevator, he’d have to go to the common floor, and there he’d have to get on a separate elevator to reach the housing floors for the Avengers. This of which included Tony’s suite.
How could Steve think of leaving when he had someone like Tony there waiting for him when the loop is over?
“I can feel you staring, you know,” Steve mused as a smile tugged on the corners of his lips, his eyes never leaving the page.
“I just mean I have to thank him is all,” Steve brushed off before he walked away to avoid her suspicious, mind-reading eyes.
Steve rubbed a hand on the back over his neck before he stepped back from Tony. Here he goes again, explaining the loop for what is around the 100th time. Literally. Steve explained it anyways, taking it slow and answering any questions. He didn’t feel like rushing it. He didn’t have the energy for that. He needed to relax and let his thoughts flow properly to avoid anymore breakdowns.
Steve let out a breathy laugh. “Oh, because Tony Stark knows all about stealth when during missions he’ll blast 80’s rock music out of his suit.”
Steve stood from the stool before he walked around Tony’s desk. “Because usually I’m able to actually get you to your bed, but for a reason different than what they think.” His voice was more gruff than usual, or maybe Tony was just getting turned on easily.
“Just make sure you don’t snore too loud, got it?” Steve warned jokingly with a small grin, and that alone brought a small smile to my face.
Tony glanced over at the clock before he turned back to Steve with a smile. “Alright, I have a plan then. You’ll spend the night here and we’ll watch movies you need to catch up on while we wait for Friday to come. You know, so then we’re killing two birds with one stone.”
tower.
“Just a dream…” Steve mumbled to himself before he rolled his shoulders to shake off the weird vibe. He breathed out before he jogged the rest of the way as if to chase away the bad feeling.
Steve managed to regain a little pep in his step after the day at the beach. He didn’t necessarily have his hand fully grasping hope, but he at least had his index finger and middle finger hanging onto it.
I had to look away. It’s a disgrace. Maybe if I just sneak a glance, it won’t be so horrible. But then I see some juice – either from the burger or the mushroom – dripping down his chin from the corner of his lips. That shouldn’t be fair.
“I mean what I said,” Steve spoke with a more accustomed speed this time, though his voice lacked his normal confidence. “I don’t want to freak you out, I don’t, but it…happened. No matter if I told you of the loop or not. We always just came together.” Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “Actually, if I’m trying to be honest here, mostly I came onto you.”
I would really appreciate the kudos and the comments for this :) it's my first work and I'm really proud of it.
Steve took his seat in front of my desk, and he even had his own little journal it seemed. “You did say two, remember, Stark?” He replied with a raised eyebrow.
“Tony, don’t. You don’t need to-to come check on me like some babysitter. I’m not a baby, and I’m not some helpless elder,” Steve tried to reason, but it came out snappy.
When he turned on his tv to the news, it played the news reports from Thursday. He tried different news stations and it was the same.
? “Do you really want to do this here?”
“Kind of,” Steve sighed as he continued to dig his palms into Tony’s back. “The mission was about the same thing. It had the same number of people. You came in from the same wall. The same guy tried to hit me from behind. And all the weapons were the same.”
Steve dismissed Sam with a little wave of his hand. “I know. Can’t forget things, remember?”
“We can’t just do this?” Steve asked as he watched Tony with admiration. “I feel pretty content here. More than I have in a while, Tony.”
“If you want, we could switch up who drives at each stop,” Steve offered after a few more moments. “It would be better for you to get some rest in between drives, and it would help me not go crazy in the passenger seat.”
Steve used all his strength to slam the shield against the guy’s head. He fell limply to the ground with eyes rolled in the back of his head. There goes his final release.
to be on a mission and it could have gone wrong. I was worried for a friend.” He paused. “How did you even manage to use her number without her phone?”
He even programmed the number into his suits, and the number he could use to contact Steve.
Steve did not wake up to Friday when he went to bed that night. Even though they went in together, it didn’t work. Tony got injured again, but this time it was because he stupidly opened his faceplate to check on Steve then got a knife slashed across his eye.
That was one of the reasons Steve loved Tony. He could read Steve better than anyone.
I shrug with a grin, speeding up as we get on the interstate ramp. “It is. And stop sounding like such a grandpa, jeez. You’re America’s most wanted bachelor yet you sound like you should be in a nursing home telling stories of
Tony chuckled slightly. “Yeah, that is something I’d say.” He leaned a bit into Steve’s side, still rubbing his back. “I get it though. He could be anywhere. And anyone.”
His eyes snapped open.
“It’s hard to forget.” Steve smiled slightly to Tony with his messing tone, but his words hung heavy in the space between them.
Tony watched with a hard face as Steve stood from his chair. He headed for the door, and Tony couldn’t think of anything to say. He didn’t even know what to think. He wanted to be able to look past all of this, but he knew it would also take time for this to heal.
Tony stuck a hand out to stop Steve and hit his chest, then quickly retracted his hand when he realized it was Steve’s bare chest. “What, in that water? It’s not even the end of spring so it’ll still be cold.” Steve gave Tony this look before it dawned on Tony. “Right. Serum. Falling into ice.” Tony patted Steve’s shoulder.
Steve eyes scanned over my face for a brief moment. “Alright. I won’t be long.” He got out the car with a relieved breath, stretching right there. He rolled his shoulders and arched his back, and I got mesmerized by the way his back muscles moved.
Steve ate his breakfast as he thought of what else he could do instead of the mission or act awkward around Tony when trying not to be affectionate. Whatever it was he did, it couldn’t be anything in the tower.
I may be terrified of us crashing, but deep down I know Jarvis wouldn’t let us crash, and I know Steve wouldn’t either.
“Oh really? Because I thought you were, what, 90 something years old and running away. I must be mistaken for another old fossil,” Tony snapped back.
Tony leaned up and stole a quick kiss before they had to pull away. “Most definitely, Cap. I will make sure no one disturbs us.”
If Tony put Jarvis in control in searching the internet, then he would be alerted if someone posted a new picture of Steve. Then Jarvis would trace it for Tony, and he would fly down in a suit to make Steve spill everything.
With that, Steve turned off the microphone and stepped off the table as the music finally turned back on. He looked at who was around him and smiled when he saw Natasha’s familiar face.
More silence.
“Yes, sir,” Jarvis replied once more before Steve took off and up the ramp that leads to the streets of New York.
I knew a lie when I saw one, and goddamn it if that wasn’t one. But from how his demeanor changed, I probably shouldn’t push it. “Well if you need any resources, you can always ask any of us,” I assure instead of asking further questions, even if I so badly wanted to.
There didn’t seem to be any joking tone to what Tony said. And as much as Steve wanted to say yes and jump Tony right then and there with his shirt off, Steve couldn’t.
There was no escaping it.
I wrap my hand around my own mug and brings it to my lips for a sip. It felt good and warm going down. I don’t need sleep to re-energize. I just need coffee is all. That way I can keep driving. “I’ll keep it in mind then, Cap,” I answer more vaguely. This way Steve could feel more relaxed.
“Bedroom!” Tony responded. His voice came from an open bedroom.
“Can we order some pizza or something? One Thursday you cooked for us, and there may or may not have been a fire.” Steve was still sullen and exhausted, but his words were light, like he was poking fun at Tony.
“Who the—” Steve turned around immediately when he heard someone on the stairs behind him. It was one of the five men. The guy pulled out his gun, but Steve was quicker and threw a knife at the guy and hit his neck.
“I used to think Howard knew everything, but I was so off base with that,” Steve pondered as he unwrapped his own burger. “I don’t think his intellect comes close to what I’ve seen from you.”
“Thank you,” Steve breathed out softly as he was already grabbing for another slice. He continued to eat quickly, practically inhaling the pizzas, as Tony ate the four slices like he said.
Steve rolled his eyes and he slumped more – if that was even possible. “Yeah, thanks for that reminder.”
He tossed his hand wraps in the laundry before he grabbed a towel to pat himself down with as he took the elevator up to his floor. Steve pulled on his suit with ease before he met with Tony downstairs, who was leant against the car they were taking together.
Tony rolled his eyes before he cut Steve off by kissing him. He didn’t kiss back at first – completely taken by surprise – before he kissed Tony back with all the love he could muster.
“Look, we didn’t want the team to find out this way,” Steve tried to reason.
“Tony…” Steve sighed again, a deep frown taking place of his usual smile when around Tony. “Look, I’ll sound crazy, but I’ll risk it,” He started off. Even if Tony always believed him about the loop, he knew how insane this was to believe. “I’m in some sort of time loop. I’ve been repeating the same Thursday for
only before for a couple hours, and I couldn’t fully deny that I was tired. Great. I better sleep or I’m going to lose it. “Fine, but not a single scratch better get on her,” I agree with a glare before I sigh sharply, walking around to the passenger side.
So, Steve drove for hours. He stopped occasionally for gas, for a stretch, or for some food if he got hungry. All was paid in cash. It wasn’t unusual for Steve to use cash, though. He had grown up without the use or knowledge of credit or debit cards, and it felt odd for him to use one.
Steve climbed up the building and jumped the roofs before he got on the one where the weapon dealers were. He looked around before he spotted the door that would normally lead to the roof, and he went through there.
Steve shook his head and rested his hands on Tony’s waist, though didn’t go any farther. The last step was going to be Tony’s decision. “I’m fine. I just—” Steve glanced down more to Tony’s lips. “I need to feel you…”
“Oh! Like in that movie. It was called, uhm…” He trailed off as he tried to think of it. “Was it called ‘Back to the Past’ or something close?”
Rhodey was the one who finally came after me when others began to realize I was still in my workshop. I could probably use his advice anyways.
They were waiting for the burgers to arrive as they sat on Tony’s couch. Steve lightly swirled the inside of the bottle as he thought about the day. How could a dream so accurately depict the future? Especially when it’s never happened before.
“Tony, I have a question as well,” Steve admitted after minutes of comfortable silence. He set his mug back on the table but kept his hands comfortably around the warm ceramic. “You don’t have to answer if you don’t feel comfortable with it,” He assured beforehand.
He should have gotten into the main room earlier than he had, and maybe then Tony wouldn’t have been injured at all. Though, then Steve wouldn’t be able to rub his hands all over Tony’s muscled back.
Steve wiped his brow before he hooked up another punching bag then stretched his arms out again. He let out a heavy breath before he struck the new punching bag with his fist. He heard the first few seams break from the contact.
Tony tried to grip Steve’s wrist tighter, but nothing happened. “I h-had to come,” He forced out through gritted teeth. He was holding on with everything he had left. “I had to-to make sure you were okay—”
Tony braced his hands on Steve’s thigh as he pushed himself up into a sitting position. “I have a couple meetings coming up. I think you have something at SHIELD. Oh, and we have a PR event some point next week. Pepper will send more details soon, I’m sure.”
“If I may ask, where exactly are we, and why?” Tony questioned once he took the chance to look around.
Steve ran a hand through his hair. “King T’Challa told me something the day I brought Bucky to him. That day we fought, he had found Zemo and talked with him before he had attempted to shoot himself. Zemo put us in a mutli-step trap that was meant to pit us against one another.”
There was a laugh, and the fifth dealer walked out from around a corner, clapping his hands together slowly and mocking. “Wow. I’m honestly quite surprised in you,
Steve looked around the park with a frown forming on his face. It felt like he came out of the ice all over again. “Yeah, I’m alright. I feel fine,” He looked back over to Sam. “It was probably just a vivid dream."
That’s what it took for Steve to finally help me. He just gave me this completely done with look before he walked over to my suitcase.
Tony gently set his hands on Steve’s chest to push away, but only enough to see Steve’s face. “As much as I love hugs from you, you’re kinda scaring me.”
It was on every social media timeline.
“Tony, no—”
The whole time as he walked towards the conference room, Tony was trying to visualize who the mystery person could be. It must have been someone that Tony wouldn’t outright agree to talking to yet someone who FRIDAY knows and trusts.
As routine, he scaled a building and jumped over roofs before he snuck into the apartment. He held his shield close to himself and a knife in another hand as he looked around to see which rooms the dealers were in.
By the time Steve arrived at the door to Tony’s suite, he still hadn’t thought of anything to do past breakfast. Despite that, Steve still knocked on Tony’s door. He even waited up, so it wouldn’t be so early for Tony.
“Don’t look at me like that,” Tony groaned before he put a hand over Steve’s face to block the pout. “We’re not going to get into the science of it and the
“Right. Sorry. I just got lost in thought,” I wave off before I look back at the menu. “I’ll probably get the double cheeseburger as is.”
Rhodey grinned and clapped Tony on the back. “Congrats, Tony. You finally found someone who can actually handle you,” He joked with a light laugh. “Now you just need to address the public.”
“Got it. Be careful,” Steve replied back as he advanced towards the side door of the building. He gripped the doorknob and gave it a testing turn to see if it was locked. It was. He tightened his grip on the object and gave it a forceful tug.
It had to at least be around three in the morning, if not later. Tony’s been through two or so bottles of whiskey as of the current moment, and he wasn’t sober enough or willing enough to count how many glasses he had.
There was a grunt and Steve immediately turned to Tony as he remembered suddenly about how Tony had gotten injured in the dream.
Steve had already been half-asleep at that point – if not fully asleep. I think he was trying to stay awake longer so it wouldn’t just have to be me awake, but I wasn’t one hundred percent on that.
Steve got off of Tony and walked into the bathroom down the hall, leaving the door open. “Yeah, it’s beyond me.” He washed the lotion off of his hands before he walked back over to Tony. “I think I’m going to head down to my floor and call it a night.”
The evening went by with more of the same as the two mingled around together. They would get split apart, but they would eventually find each other again.
“I have plans with DUM-E, of course,” Tony exclaimed as if it was obvious to everyone.
Steve sighed and didn’t even bother to reach for his phone again. It would just be useless. “They were to bring in more money for the army during the war. It was the only way they let me get close to the fight after the serum.”
A week alone with Steve while trying to complete a mission.
Tony reached over with his other hand and cupped Steve’s jaw. “I can’t even imagine what this…this
Sorry for what? Tony didn’t know, not specifically. He could be sorry for calling, sorry for not saying more, sorry for waiting so long, or sorry for the airport and Siberia.
I shake my head then turn my attention back to what I was playing with. “If you came down here to talk about that, you know I won’t.”
Steve sighed and set his drink in the cup holder. “You need a break from driving, Tony. Just for a little while,” He tried to reason.
He couldn’t do it.
That lucky little Bastard.
Tony had ingested more alcohol than he intended (he was trying to get sober, after all), but it was going to be okay.
He wanted Tony more than anything, but not just as a fling.
Nothing.
“Son of a—”
Tony folded his arms over his chest and looked up to Steve, though he still wasn’t looking Steve in the eyes. “Do elaborate then. I want to know if I should get us some coffee or if I need to call my armor. Either is perfectly fine with me.”
Philanthropist isn’t being a playboy?” He asked in fake bewilderment, though Tony didn’t know that.
I grin proudly before I start to unwrap my burger. “It’s a blessing and a curse.”
“We were good friends,” Steve nodded then let out a chuckle. “Or he was just really fascinated with what he helped create.”
“What?” Steve raised an eyebrow, playing casual and friendly. You know, not like he knew more than Tony thought he did in this moment. “The Genius Billionaire
Steve was understandably…not.
Steve gritted his teeth before he hung up the phone. He didn’t want to argue or for their words to escalate, especially with Tony on the way.
Steve abandoned the book all together, setting it on the coffee table in front of them. “As much as I don’t want to ask this question, do we have anything planned that we’ll need to plan around for ourselves?”
What’s up with Steve, anyways? I can’t be the only one who sees the way he is with me. It’s vexing as hell, but it’s also very bothersome. I know most people can’t stand me. It’s just a little harder to swallow that Captain America, my crush from boyhood, is also one of those people.
“I will. I sleep like a baby.”
Steve relished in the feeling of Tony holding onto him. He glanced at the cars around them before he sped up, weaving in and out of the cars and the lanes.
Steve didn’t know quite how to respond to that. He smiled a bit to himself before he bit into his burger. He was relaxed – at least more so than throughout most of his day. And it was all thanks to Tony.
They went through a good bit of movies and snacked on the remaining pizza as they cuddled together on the couch.
I give him a shrug in response then sets my notepad on the desk. “Let’s get started then, shall we?”
I look up expecting to see Steve giving me an opposing look, but he was actually nodding along.
I have a habit of blowing things out of proportion. Can you tell?
Steve clasped his hands together tightly for a moment before he released as he let out a deep breath. There wasn’t a single Thursday that Tony denied Steve’s affections, but it didn’t make Steve’s doubts and fears go away. If everything went right, he had no more do-overs.
The wind picked up and Steve opened his eyes to look down at the city below him. “Another way,” He mumbled to himself as he thought of pros and cons.
Tony snorted. “Did they think you have a better chance of dragging me out here with your muscles?” He asked as he shook his head, a loose grin on his face. He was fond of the team, but sometimes they were ridiculous.
He cleared his throat. “Yeah, I bet it does. You were
“Tones,” Steve breathed out softly before he closed the space between them. “Stop worrying about me, just for a day,” He murmured before he gently grabbed hold of Tony’s chin.
“Bruce! Cap!” Rhodey motioned for them to come over. Once they were near, he asked, “Is it just me, or has Tony been avoiding all of us?”
“Okay don’t you think things are moving a little fast?” Tony questioned without much seriousness in his voice, but instead with sarcasm and the curiosity.
Some Thursday mornings Steve would play casual and call Thor to check on Loki, who would then realize Loki wasn’t actually
It was also a plus for Tony to be kissing
“Stop—”
Steve peered in the glass door before he knocked lightly with his knuckle. “Tony?”
“That so?” Steve mused with a grin. He revved up the engine. “Maybe Iron Man doesn’t to Captain America, but Tony Stark does with Steve Rogers.”
“And you’re telling me that you—” Steve paused and furrowed his brows. “Wait, tight?” He questioned, not getting what Tony was referring to. “My suit is tight?”
Steve shook his head. “Tony,
The two sat down on the couch together, and Tony pulled one leg up on the couch as he turned sideways to look at Steve. He, on the other hand, was looking down and fiddling his hands together.
“Then again, you wouldn’t be Tony Stark without a little cockiness.” Steve flashed Tony a smile as he walked back over with a bottle of water and an unused shirt he found stashed.
Steve leaned his head back and closed his eyes, feeling his stomach drop. He knew what it was about.
Steve huffed slightly, knowing how smug Tony was getting. “No, it wasn’t…” He glanced to Tony then cleared his throat. “Another good part of the loop is one day we went to the beach. Well, I had, in a way, ran away? I hoped getting out of state would help so I stopped in Virginia at a beach. You ended up finding me, of course. So, you stayed with me, and you didn’t make me tell you what was wrong. We just…spent a day at the beach. Together.”
Tony mock-saluted to Steve with a grin before the two walked out of the medical center together.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, pulling Tony onto his lap. “But you wouldn’t have given up, a-and you wouldn’t have taken so long to figure everything out.” He shook his head then tucked his face into the crook of Tony’s neck.
Steve’s thoughts were flying a million miles per hour, and Tony was almost driving just as fast with Jarvis’ directions. How had he never thought to check the weapons? How had Tony remembered the field?
Tony just shrugged before he unbuckled as well. “Of course it’s necessary. Who would I be if I didn’t throw my own boyfriend a party for his birthday?” He winked in Steve’s direction.
Steve swallowed his own bite of food, maintaining gazes with Tony. “You can never know for certain about things like this. Especially when there’s nothing being done towards the person for you to know for sure.”
“That’s because I busy myself. I…don’t feel like I could
? Is that you?” Came Steve’s eager, hopeful voice.
“Yeah, most likely,” He finally said as he held a hand out for Sam. “Come on, let’s go get our smoothies. I remembered my wallet.” Steve grinned.
“It must have been a bad dream. That’s all,” Steve tried to wave off. Tony knew there was more to it though.
Steve laughed lightly as our waiter came over. “The guys in the army never mentioned it, but you never know.”
Steve finally closed his door and walked away towards the store, and I could feel myself relax as I pay for the gas. He was hot, that I couldn’t deny. No one could. He’s a fucking super soldier who wears tight shirts.
“What if we stop and got gas at five-thirty, but it isn’t quite six yet? Would we just go back on the road for another half hour then stop again and waste time?” Steve countered back theoretically.
Steve’s pout went away to put in a place a sweet smile. “Okay, fine. Let’s enjoy this.” He reached over to the back of the couch and pulled a blanket over the two of them before he wrapped his arms back around Tony.
Tony grabbed his phone, handing it to Steve so he could count down the seconds. “I’d do anything for you, Cap.” He gave Steve a small, hopeful smile.
Steve couldn’t help the tug of his lips in the corner.
He launched himself over to the last dealer standing and retched his shield out from the now abandoned weapon. “Ah -Fuck!” Steve heard come from Tony, who sounded in pain and distress.
The number was already pulled up when Tony opened it. The phone didn’t need to be charged, because Tony made it a priority to always keep it charged, no matter what.
,” He stepped in front of Tony, gently holding onto Tony’s shoulders. “I didn’t mean it that way. You’re too much for me as in I don’t deserve you.” Steve moved a hand to cup Tony’s jaw, towering over him a bit because of their height differences.
Tony rolled his eyes in response before he grinned towards the crowd again. “It’s high time I address everyone here. So, welcome to my Fourth of July Bash! I hope everyone is having a good time?”
Steve shook his head and pulled Tony – armor and all – into his arms desperately. “I’m going to get you out of here, okay?”
It beeped as Tony unlocked it, already having grabbed the keys. “So, do I get to know any more about your epiphany?” He questioned as they both stepped into the car. “Because if we need our suits, I’m curious to what danger we’re about to get ourselves into.”
“No, Tony. I’m not in the mood for your jokes right now. What the hell is going on? What haven’t you been telling us?” Rhodey exclaimed with a pointed look at Tony.
?” Steve couldn’t help the laugh that came from his chest as he put the butter up. “You do realize that when not counting how long I’ve been frozen, I’m roughly 30-years-old, right?” He turned around to look at Tony with an arched eyebrow, taking a bite of his toast.
Steve didn’t miss the edges of Tony’s lips turning up for his first smile of the day, hidden or not by the mug.
Tony grunted and grumbled to himself as he headed towards the door. What could FRIDAY possibly want to hide from Tony? FRIDAY usually doesn’t hide things, unless it’s something harmless involving Peter.
He grinned and finally passed over the microphone then proceeded to hop off the table to let all focus turn to Steve.
“Just so I’m getting this right, you want me to stay away from some mysterious mission that you think is too dangerous for myself yet you’re going in on it alone?” Tony quirked a brow to his friend in front of him. “Yeah, okay.”
Now or never.
The guy blushed from embarrassment before he typed it in, handing my debit card back along with the card key to the room. “You’ll be billed for it in the morning after you check-out at the desk, so we can put it in the system. Your room number will be 128 on the first floor.”
Tony let his eyes roam over Steve’s body unabashedly. Now that he knew Steve was into men, it was like a barrier was broken. “I have a question for you, Cap,” He stated as he felt himself take a step closer to Steve. “What kind of guys are you into?”
“So, you’re telling me…that this was the first time you’ve done this? Male or female?” Tony asked in a disbelieving voice.
Tony wasn’t following a single thing, but he saw the desperation in Steve’s eyes. “Just hold on, okay? I’ll get us there. Let’s get back in the car.” He squeezed Steve’s hands comfortingly before they both got back in the car.
Tony wandered if it really felt as scruffy as it looked.
?” He asked in disbelief before his eyes snap over to Steve, and they widen impossibly more. “And you’re
It wasn’t like he was angry or upset Tony almost exposed them, because Steve was the one who was ready to finally tell everyone.
I nod a little as I listen to him. “Like a place to unplug?” It didn’t sound that bad actually. “Though if we get caught and questioned, what would we say to it only being us there?”
“That, kind sir, is not fair,” Tony huffed out. He was definitely not turned on by that small action.
“And what’s with you nicknaming me?” Tony stepped closer into Steve’s space, his grasp gentle and soft. “Steve, you’ve just been through something that…that I can’t even imagine going through. And I’ve been through a lot. Can’t you talk to me about it?”
“What about your drink?”
Tony glared tiredly at Steve’s figure before he turned his attention to the tv, and the glare was wiped off his face. “
I would really appreciate the kudos and the comments for this :) it's my first work and I'm really proud of it.
He tried to stay right with Tony’s promise. He really did. Steve attempted not going to the mission at all, but Thursday still came. He attempted to destroy all the weapons, but Thursday still came. He attempted to get more intimate with Tony to see if he was the key, but Thursday still came. He attempted to not talk to Tony at all, but Thursday still came. Again. And again. And again.
Maybe while Steve took this break from the loop, he could focus on trying to figure out how deep Tony’s feelings go for Steve. All he knew beforehand – from the previous Thursdays – was that Tony reciprocated Steve’s feelings. What he didn’t know was how deep they were for Tony and how long they had been kept hidden.
“My food?” Steve raised an eyebrow as he looked at me. “It’s just a burger, Tony. It’s the double mushroom swiss burger.”
I shake my head with a small chuckle, using the card key to unlock the door and push it open with my back. “You don’t want to hear what I’ve done at work then.”
Tony scooted himself closer, cupping Steve’s jaw gently. “Steve, if that’s true then—”
Steve reached out and grabbed Tony’s wrists gently. “We can’t get explosive over this, Tones. It happened. But we have to talk about this. Like, now. Before it blows up in our faces more.”
No one bothered to stop him. They were either afraid to step in the line of Steve’s fury, or they understood he needed this.
With a deep breath, Steve held the phone tightly in both hands. “This sort of reminds me of some twisted New Year’s.”
Tony leaned his hip against the counter and watched appreciatively as Steve undressed, who in return glanced over with an eyebrow raised.
“It at least smells like good food,” Steve offered as he slid into the booth, his eyes scanning around cautiously. Probably at how unkept this place looked.
“It’s not like I haven’t paid for being cocky before,” Tony chuckled then winced as the substance started to sizzle deeper.
“That sounds amazing, Tones. It really does. I just hope this is truly over,” Steve deflated with a small shrug. “There’s been a lot of empty promises.”
“I’m sure,” Steve confirmed as he stepped out the car, this time with more grace than he had when he got into the car. “I heard good things about it over the internet.”
The door opened and Steve walked in with his hands clasped on his belt. Seriously, why does he do that? What’s the point? It drove me insane.
Tony laughed before he peeled off his shirt carefully. “If you insist,” He winked to Steve before he moved onto the couch and laid on his stomach. “I’m sure those strong hands of yours can do some good.”
“There’s still no word from Thor or Bruce?” He questioned before he shook his head. “But none of that is what I’m here for.”
Tony tried to stretch out his back but stopped halfway as he winced. “JARVIS? Damage report.”
Steve barged into my apartment, but I couldn’t find it in me to care at the moment. I could hear in his stomps just how angry he was. “Stark! You were supposed to be—”
“If you’ll excuse me,” I begin to say as I stand up from my chair, buttoning together my suit jacket. “I have a meeting I should probably get to. I’ll see you around, Rogers.”
“No talking. I’m not awake yet,” Tony grumbled as he trudged back into the bedroom. He came out again in his boxers this time before he made his way to the kitchen.
“Yeah, the same goes for me,” Steve sighed as he got out the car as well. He braced his hands on his lower back before he started to lean back, effectively stretching out his back at the audible popping noises that followed.
Tony didn’t respond. How could he just believe that Steve went from embarrassed and shying away from Tony’s flirts, to now – so suddenly – in love with Tony and leaning towards the flirts?
Today was going to be different. He was sure of it. Instead of trying to accomplish the mission differently with Tony, Steve was going to do it alone. It was a change, and Tony wouldn’t get hurt this way.
“Are you seeing anything good?” Steve finally asked after a few moments.
What if it was Bruce? He’s been MIA for almost two years now. Tony nodded his head to himself. It’s the only reasonable answer after all. He couldn’t think of who else would come to the compound and try to surprise him by remaining anonymous.
Tony looked up and smiled when he saw his friend. “Jarvis, let him in.” Only Tony, Rhodey, and Pepper had access to his workshop. He stopped what he was working on to wipe his hands with a rag. “What brings you down here, Capsicle?”
Steve watched as Tony disappeared into the elevator before he took a big swig from his beer. He just needed to sleep. Once he ate he was going to excuse himself for the night and retire in his bedroom. Sleep should help.
Steve pressed a quick kiss to Tony’s lips before he got in the bathtub. He had to be careful of the ridiculous amount of bubbles that flowed over the edge of the bathtub.
He needed to get a grip of control.
Tony’s hair was messy and sticking up in different places. It was hot, but Steve couldn’t think about another round. “About last night…”
Steve didn’t waste any more time before he captured Tony’s lips in his own, pulling their bodies impossibly closer. Tony rested a hand on Steve’s shoulder and the other with the glass hooked behind Steve’s neck.
When they made it back up to Tony’s suite, Steve made sure Tony had everything he needed and was situated on the couch. “We probably should have drove back. You weren’t in shape for the walk back.”
Tony groaned, but then a slight grin appeared on his face. “Alright. Deal. Now get that wonderful ass of yours in those bubbles.” He smacked Steve’s ass as he passed, his signature smirk on his face.
He kept his eyes on me for a split second more before his gaze turned down to the menu. “Yeah, I think something’s caught my fancy.”
There was a flaw to their causal hookups though: Steve was catching feelings for Tony. More surprisingly though, Tony was also catching feelings for Steve.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice was tender. It almost sounded relieved, but Tony couldn’t be too sure. After all, he didn’t know Steve as much as he thought. Especially not this Steve.
“It’s good that I’m not usually quiet then,” I chime in to help, but then I can’t help but yawn.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” I groan as I slump back into my chair. Why Steve? Why not anyone else?
“Yes, we are,” I declare as I pick up some of my other, more lighter bags that held various other objects. Clothes were in one bag and, well, the other bags were filled with equally important things for the mission. Different Iron Man suits being part of it. “Would you be a dear and grab that suitcase for me? It’s my last bag.”
“I’m sorry,” He croaked out through the tears, not speaking to anyone. No one was around to hear, anyways. He was alone. Just like he was in Siberia.
Tony breathed sharply out his nose before he started driving. But it was in the opposite direction of the tower.
His feelings were at bay when Steve was never intimate with Tony, and Steve didn’t have the knowledge that Tony liked him as well. Basically, his feelings were at bay before the loop.
“I’ll hold it down while you zip it closed,” Steve instructed in his Captain America commanding voice.
The toast was gone by the time Steve reached the gym, and he went straight to the locker room. He pulled on his hand wraps before he walked over to his punching bag.
When the party was over, and everyone made it back to the tower, Steve made sure all the other Avengers had gone to their quarters before he snuck himself up to Tony’s suite. With Tony’s prior orders, Jarvis let Steve in without hesitation.
“When Bucky came in, I knew he wouldn’t be treated as he needed to be treated. Not only was he falsely accused, but he wasn’t even The Winter Solider until Zemo snuck in and said the words he needed to. That isn’t Bucky’s fault.”
Oh, that’s right. He doesn’t know me enough to know that. Funny.
He made himself a cup of coffee and some eggs before he sat down at his little table that fit in the apartment Tony decorated for him. There was no way he could stay in this tower doing nothing. Tony would be able to find Steve anywhere because of Jarvis. And because of how well Tony knows Steve.
Stupid super soldier strength.
Sweatpants and some random band t-shirt were what was set aside for today, so I was able to quickly change into those clothes. Now the only thing left to do was close my last suitcase that I had opened.
Tony grunted in response. In this conversation, it can be roughly translated to a ‘yes.’ He poured his coffee into a mug before he made his way towards Steve. Tony took a seat on the other couch as he took his first sip.
It had been a quiet couple of weeks. I hadn’t been asked to do a mission in those weeks, and I was actually feeling anxious. It wasn’t that I was anxious about no threats, because there definitely was some. Fury just sent others to be on the missions.
Tony couldn’t help but laugh. “Steve, just take a breather. If the serum would even go to your brain, it would have happened while you were fighting hydra in the 40’s. You’re just overthinking the dream, okay?”
“What if it was me that ran away? You would be in this situation too. You would come to me to talk even if I didn’t want to come to you. Why is this
“Tony…” Steve swallowed the lump in his throat, not tearing his eyes away from the phone. His heart was hammering against his chest. This is the most hope he had for the loop to end. If it didn’t, well, Steve would be ruined.
new – and I say this very lightly, because they were first invented at the end of the last decade, but only recently I’ve noticed them popping up in more public places,” I ramble off in a small burst of knowledge.
“I’m trying to figure out which speech you’re referring to,” Steve chuckled as he shook his head. “The ones that I’ve heard of are when he announced he wasn’t selling weapons anymore with a burger stuffed in his mouth and the one when he announced he was Iron Man.”
“You…watched me die?” Tony questioned as if he heard wrong. But he didn’t.
“How come he handed the check to you and not to me?” I question a little offended then reaches over and grabs it. “Do they not know who I am?”
“That’s my man,” Tony grinned before the suit opened up and he gratefully stepped out as he rubbed his lower back. “So, Cap, after we debrief you want some burgers? We can order in and have it up at my place.” When Steve looked as if he was going to back down, Tony pointed a stern finger at him. “I’m not taking any no’s or but’s. You’re eating with me and we’re talking.”
Tony pushed on. He moved on. He tried to forget. He had to.
I wore when in the army.”
Tony pursed his lips before he moved to sit next to Steve on the bench, rubbing Steve’s back comfortingly. “Okay. We’ll get you through this, Steve. I’m not gonna give up on you, so don’t give up on me,” He stated with firmness, trying to get Steve to agree. It was the broken look in Steve’s eyes that had Tony feeling like something sunk down in his stomach.
The difference of this particular moment was what Steve saw as he turned on the morning news. A very clear picture of Tony and Steve kissing in the car the night before had been taken and spread around just about everywhere.
long while.
“None of this takes away what you did. Not even just you,” Tony’s jaw clenched as he gripped his mug tightly. “You teamed up against me and
know.”
Steve chuckled lightly as he began to butter the toast. “You know I can be reasonable,” He chuckled again as he slid the butter knife over the toast.
“It started as a one night stand,” Tony let in as he finished his meal. “We were both drunk and it, well, happened.”
For the first time since he got stuck in the loop, Steve fell asleep peacefully. He knew tomorrow would bring him another identical Thursday, but at that moment Steve wasn’t concerned anymore. He knew that through it all, he’d have Tony. Even as the next morning would roll around and Tony wouldn’t be in his arms or remember anything, Steve remembered. That’s what he had to hold on to.
“It means people can’t keep their damn noses to themselves!” Tony exclaimed angrily before he grabbed the remote and pushed the power button more aggressively than needed.
“That’s true. You only complain about Nazis, extreme nationalism, and assholes.” Tony’s voice was light and joking, earning another laugh from Steve that made Tony’s grin widen.
“Of course, sir.”
(See the end of the chapter for
That was due to a very specific reason, though.
Tony rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, but not without stealing a glance in Steve’s direction.
He would be back again, of course. Thursday would come again, and it would be like it didn’t happen. Because it didn’t really, did it?
Tony snorted before he nudged Steve as he glanced around as if to make sure no one was listening. His drunkenness wasn’t making that very discreet. “Go see Thor. He has this Asgardian drink that he isn’t letting any mortal have. But he might just give some to you, Cap.”
Steve smiled to himself as they walked, not caring if anyone noticed them or took pictures. It wouldn’t make a difference anyways since it would all simply be preserved in Steve’s mind, and Steve’s mind only. The media would forget everything.
Fury leaned back in the chair he sat in, and he kicked his feet up right on the edge of my desk. The fucking disrespect. He was in
“Alright, I have to ask,” Tony spoke up, leaning over his arms on the table. “How did it feel doing that little skit in front of all the soldiers overseas?” He grinned with this look interest twinkling in his eyes.
Rhodey only shrugged as he stayed in the same place. “I heard you and Steve were going on a mission together soon without any service and only with each other. Just thought I’d stop by.” He was smug and it pissed me off.
Tony’s faceplate snapped shut and he held his hands up, the repulsors warmed up and ready to fire. “Why? Hasn’t the party just started?” He questioned with that perfect wit that Steve has come to love. But now wasn’t the time.
Steve grabbed the keys with his free hand, his other hand holding some protein energy drink. “Alright. I’ll start her up,” He offered with a small smile.
Steve’s cheeks turned a little pink. Was he…embarrassed? No, he couldn’t be. This was Cap, and he only got embarrassed when people talked about sex around him or genitalia.
“Uhm, almost overflowing?” Tony answered just as sheepishly as he looked. “I’ll get someone to clean it in the morning. It’ll be fine.”
That Tony didn’t quite understand. It took a lot for someone to get such an exhausted look in their eyes. Tony knew that first hand. So, why did Steve have that look after just a day’s difference?
“I was wondering if you wanted to go get breakfast? I, uhm, don’t exactly know where a diner is though,” Steve admitted with a little shrug. “And I’m sorry for waking you.”
Steve couldn’t help but take in Tony’s appearance as he sipped his coffee. Luckily the steam from the coffee could excuse the blush he felt on his cheeks. “Good morning, Tony,” Steve greeted warmly and with a smile. “Coffee?”
“Is there a destination to this trip that Mr. Stark should be aware of, Captain?” Jarvis asked as his response as Steve entered the garage.
He nodded and glanced over to me from above the menu. “I’m not used to it, I suppose. You just seem…more relaxed.”
Steve nodded a bit and took a deep breath that came out ragged as his heart started to beat even faster. They both stared at the phone, no noise except for the hums of all the electronics and such running through the tower.
Steve knew, from the many hours he and Tony talked as Tony worked, that it was a way for Tony to easily access the suit. Though, he had better ideas. They just weren’t ready yet in Tony’s world.
We threw all the trash away before we walked back out to the car together. I unlocked it and we got in, and I switched the radio to my channel almost immediately as the car started.
A snort sounded from Tony as he set his mug down on the countertop. “Nice, huh? That wouldn’t be the exact word I’d use, but you do you I guess.” A little smirk formed on Tony’s face as Steve let out a short laugh.
He shouldn’t have been surprised when it was Tony’s voice on the other line.
Steve stared at Tony’s back before he followed. He didn’t know much about Tony and Howard’s relationship, except that Howard drunk and worked a lot and the real Jarvis helped raise Tony.
After they soaked for a while in the bubble-ridden water, they decided it was time to get out before they both fell asleep there. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“You just walked out on Steve and came here, huh? You didn’t even give him a chance to explain himself,” Rhodey scolded.
Even if Tony had gotten injured before in the torturous loop, this was so much worse.
I grin before I slip my card back into my wallet. “Just make sure pay that rent of yours,” I offer as some last advice before I stand up, motioning for Steve to do the same. “Come on. We should get back on the road.”
Steve started up their coffee machine again and started on their breakfast while Tony sat and listened to what the news anchors were saying now about them. The machine beeped when the coffee pot was ready, and Steve made two cups for each of them. “I thought you turned that shit off?” Steve asked as he set Tony’s mug on the countertop.
“Just eat this, okay? I’ll probably eat about,” Tony eyed the pizza. “Four slices?” He nodded, confirming it to himself. “Yeah, you can eat the rest. And if not, then cold pizza in the morning is also as delicious.”
“Perfect,” Tony breathed out as he let himself collapse on the bed. “G’night, Steve,” He mumbled as he already began to fall asleep.
Steve, on the other hand, had serious wind-blown hair. He kicked the stand down before he stood off the bike.
Tony laughed a bit. “Army men just wanting to see girls in heels dance? Yep, that sounds right.” He leaned back after and smiled more warmly. “You know, I don’t think I ever saw any of your drawings before. You’re secretive about them, which I respect.”
Steve started with a walk before he lightly jogged down the sidewalk to where he runs in the morning. Once there he took a sip of his water to hydrate himself before he took off in a full run around Central Park.
Just as that happened, someone hit Steve in the head with some displaced object that must have been lying around the floor. He turned around to face the culprit.
Steve nodded a bit, arms crossed behind his back, before he made his way over to the living room. He sat in one of the chairs, too weirded out too sit on the couch where he had the night before. Instead he stared at the spot blankly as his thoughts wandered.
.” He could swear there was a grin in FRIDAY’s voice, but there was no possible way for that.
Steve sat on the couch and turned to face Tony, one of his arms slung over the back of the couch. Tony was laid down with his head rested on the armrest. “I’m fine, Cap. Stop worrying so much,” Tony waved off before he closed his eyes. “I just need a nap. They said it should heal quick enough with whatever it was they gave me.”
It was horrible. Steve couldn’t get the image out of his head for days. And yes,
“Sorry,” Steve chuckled before he took a deep breath. He put his face in Tony’s hair and breathed in the sweet smell of Tony’s shampoo. “I guess I just went with the flow.”
Steve sighed and lowered his head as he held the phone against his ear. “She’s
Tony smiled warmly to Steve before he started on his second and last burger. “Please,” He waved at Steve dismissively. “If I
Tony sat up and stretched out his back with a happy groan as he felt how much looser it was now. Though he snapped his attention to Steve. “Leaving? You don’t want to see what else those hands can do?” His voice was suggestive and was accompanied by a smirk.
“Finally. Something we agree on,” Tony mumbled as he closed his eyes, though with something positive underlying his words. Something that stirred what people call butterflies in Steve’s stomach. Just like on that first Thursday he found out Tony liked him.
“Tones…” Steve’s voice was soft and tempting to Tony, but he couldn’t give in. Not after everything.
Steve put the kickstand down on his motorcycle before he walked down to the shore with his hands in his jacket pockets. He didn’t get many looks or glances as he made his way down, which he was glad for.
Steve pulled out his phone and looked up pictures of him when in a battle. “Oh, come on—This isn’t even bad,” He argued back lightly. “So, I’ve gotten more muscular, and it fills in more. It’s nothing compared to the first
“Bucky and I used to come here. Before everything – the war and all,” Steve stopped once a good bit into the meadow. “After Fury was done with me when I woke up, I immediately looked up Peggy and came to search for this place. It helped me think, and it’s a little taste of home.”
He quietly and cautiously made his way down the stairs. Talking could be heard from the same room as every Thursday, even if it was earlier in the day. They must do most of their business from there.
It never got me anywhere. It was all too awkward and forced. The lack of conversation wasn’t helping me stay awake either. I could feel myself wanting to sleep.
“You know, you could at least act like you’re out of shape like me,” Sam breathed out in pants as he sent Steve a half-joking half-not look.
Steve looked over to me for a moment before he looked ahead. “As ready as I’ll ever be,” He mumbled in response, and I can’t be too sure if I was meant to hear that.
Just like Tony said, within 20 minutes he could be heard speeding high in the sky. Steve looked up with a bit of disappointment before he stood. There were still people around, and he didn’t want the attention. Especially since Tony and him might end up arguing.
because Tony shrugged before he drove off.
Tony got comfortable in Steve’s embrace, one arm wrapped around Steve and his other hand combing through Steve’s hair in a comforting manner. “Why don’t you tell me the good parts of the loop?” He suggested softly, wanting to draw Steve away from that dark conversation.
I chuckle tiredly before I yank the tightly tucked in covers back, snuggling my way underneath them. “You do you, just as long as I’m not woken up.”
“Hm?” Steve lifted the icepack to see Tony and smiled slightly. “Good morning to you too,” He mused as his eyes darted down to Tony’s unclothed body.
“J, open the door for him,” I instruct as Rhodey made it down the stairs to the shop.
Tony raised an eyebrow before he grabbed his sunglasses. “Don’t tell me we’re riding that bike of yours.”
I scoff at that. “No, I couldn’t. We’re taking a car, remember? So, I’m trying to minimize the luggage we bring,” I dismiss. “Once this is zipped, I’ll be ready to go.”
Steve nodded with a sigh before he got out the car. “One too many times.”
Steve glanced over to me as he chewed a mouthful of his food. That man doesn’t waste any time, does he? It’s probably that super soldier appetite he has. The costs in groceries have gone up significantly since he moved into the tower almost a year ago now, but it doesn’t matter to me. I prefer my money going towards food than weapons.
“Yeah, we are because
I just rolled my eyes. I wasn’t in the mood for this. “But do you even know what he said to me?”
“None taken—”
“I just wanted to inform you that Fury wants us to leave around five in the morning for the drive there.” Steve went to continue, but of course I had to interrupt. It’s my specialty at this point.
Steve watched me with curiosity and, yes, amusement. “It’s just a burger. Normally I would get one like yours. Well, probably two of them. I wanted to try something new though.” He brought the burger up and opened his mouth to take a bite.
Natasha slapped a magazine down on the counter where both Steve and Tony could see it. “We want answers, Rogers. We want all the answers.”
Steve stood back up in the water and walked over to the shore where Tony still was with his half-constructed sand castle. No matter what happened on any given Thursday, Tony was always there. Tony always believed in Steve. Tony always comforted Steve. Tony always opened up to Steve. Tony always worried for Steve. Tony was always…Tony.
Once back at the tower, Steve made his way up to the common floor where he could take a break with some coffee before he headed down to the gym.
Steve had made his run earlier, so he and Sam could finish around the same time. Luckily, he didn’t mind waking up the little bit earlier.
“To wherever this building is where the dealers are at. It won’t be another hour or more until we get there if it goes the same,” Tony shrugged. “You know where it is, I can drive, and we can get ready now.”
Even with that reassurance, Steve still felt like he pushed Tony. “Do you need anything else before I go back to my floor? I’m sure I stink more now than earlier.”
It's officially over! I would appreciate any kudos that have not been given yet and any comments you may have!
Steve clenched and unclenched his fists, starting to see red. “How did I not see—fuck. Jesus
He collapsed and fell down the stairs. Steve heard the talking stop and quickly hid behind a wall, so he won’t be so exposed.
Steve rubbed a hand over his face. “I just wanted to spend the day alone and away from everything!” He retorted.
“Of course. Your rational thoughts work better that way,” Steve teased lightly before he pulled away with a faint smile. He wasn’t looking forward to the chaos that would be unleashed, but he knew he still had Tony through it all. After all, the chaos was revolving around their secret relationship.
“Fashionably late as always,” Tony replied cheekily as he began to fire his repulsors at the dealers who either defended themselves or tried to run.
He forced himself to step away from the ninth punching bag he was pounding on. What the fuck was he thinking? How could he possibly find Loki? Maybe if he had more time, and Loki didn’t constantly try to make Steve lose track of his process – or Tony’s process – then he’d be able to find Loki.
“So, you’re telling me that you tried just about all of the thousands upon thousands of variations a single day could have?” Tony scooted himself closer to Steve. “With that mind of yours, you can remember every little detail. Just…you have to try.”
Tony looked over at Steve with pursed lips before he made his way to the kitchen. “What do you want? I’ll make you anything. Or order, because you also know I’m not the best cook.” He chuckled at himself before he looked to Steve, waiting for the order.
Steve leaned back and sipped from his coffee after that. “What do you think our guy will look like?”
“I don’t see why. You have so much knowledge in your mind – especially more than myself – that you’re just so…so,” Steve paused to try to think of the right-fitting word. “
“You are only reasonable when you need to be,” Tony laughed lightly. “Which is the best way to be reasonable, if I do say so,” He added with a cheeky grin. He was finally starting to relax, but it wouldn’t last for long.
His knock almost sounded rhythmic like drums on the Fourth of July. This man is unbelievable.
Every day he’d open his eyes to the same weather, the same alarm, the same clouds, the same mission, the same news, the same Tony, the same Thursday. It’s officially been three months, and Steve didn’t know what else he could do.
I didn’t get up until my coffee was finished, and I still hadn’t changed or finished packing. Oh well.
This was something that, in these almost four months-worth of Thursdays, Steve never knew. He quickly turned his head over, and it would have given him whiplash if he was a normal person.
Surprisingly enough, there wasn’t an odor detected.
?” Tony grinned at the unusual code word. “Why yes, Cap. I haven’t
“I told you to stay back,” Steve grounded out in anger before he turned and finally punched the guy nearest. Tony rolled his eyes before he snapped his face plate closed and blasted a guy with his repulsors.
Tony noticed the change of Steve’s response. Usually Steve was bashful and shy and embarrassed after, but now it was like he was basking in them. He eyed Steve curiously, thoughtfully, before he sipped his coffee again.
Tony stopped to turn to Steve dramatically – which pretty much summed up Tony. Even in the middle of a fight he can’t help his sass. “
“Is that a compliment I hear from you?” Amused Tony, who then was shot with one of the alien styled weapons.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve glanced over to Tony before sighing. “Yeah. It is. The mission is the exact same as what happened in the dream.” He paused and resisted the urge to shift uncomfortably. “Am I going crazy? Has the serum done something to my mind?”
. Let me enjoy this.”
It was hard though. This couldn’t be a dream. Why would he dream about the same day three days in a row? Especially when most things stayed the same.
He didn’t stop until they were either unconscious or dead. He wanted to kill all of them, but he had to think of Tony.
“Are you alright?”
Steve could only stare in horror, realizing what Tony had just said and how it had rippled through him, his chest tightening more than it ever had.
“Tony?”
“Hey.” Tony reached out reflexively, grabbing on to Steve’s jacket, keeping him close. “Look, yeah, I might still be a little shaken from everything that’s happened, but who wouldn’t be? It’s nothing we can’t overcome. You know this. I know you. I trust you.”
Steve shrugged. “I thought it would be rude to leave the place unattended.”
Tony’s own expression never change, silencing the phone before pocketing it. “Friends can still eat lunch together, Rogers. Wild concept, I know. Anyway, I got to run. Let me know when visiting hours are, yeah?”
“Tony.” Steve’s voice was tight and clipped, and Tony swallowed his words.
“Steve?”
Steve rolled his eyes, not even pretending to hide his weariness. “So you didn’t bring a suit?”
Steve didn’t look like any of that made him feel better.  “I’ve never hated you, Tony. You know that.”
Tony stared at Steve long and hard, trying his hardest to work out what was going on in that thick, super soldier skull of his. “Okay, so I’m just going to go ahead and apologize if I hadn’t made it abundantly clear when I kissed you outside--and then allowed you to kiss me again inside--but I’m kind of in love with you? More than kind of. A lot, actually. So, yeah, I’d really, really appreciate it if you stayed. With me. Here. Together?”
Bucky was crowding him against the wall now, tearing at his reactor as he screamed something unintelligible, and Tony remembered panicking, anger and fear raging, the voice in his suit too loud—
Some shuffling could be heard over the line. And then: “Tony?”
Steve’s brow smoothed at the words, and he leaned down to kiss Tony again, sweet and light. “Whatever you want.”
Tony’s eyes flickered across Steve’s, and as the moments passed, a wetness seemed to come over them, and he used his free hand to wipe at them quickly, shaking his head.
Strange interrupted him before he could continue. “I can assure you all is well in this reality. However, there are infinite universes, infinite timelines outside of ours. As displeasing as they may be, they are not our responsibility to atone for.”
“One sec.” Tony pulled it from his pocket, smiling after a moment. He looked up at Steve, apologetic. “Sorry. Pep. Guess I missed another lunch date.”
But in that small moment, Steve had run at him, shield held high as he aimed it at the suit. Iron Man raised both hands instinctively and let lose a too loud blast. It had been practically pointblank, gauntlets closely pressed against Steve’s chest before firing, and it had sent him flying across the room. He crashed into the far wall with a sickening crack, before he slumped to the floor. Tony could see the front of his uniform burnt black, singed and bloodied skin underneath.
Sam was out of his seat quickly, coming along to Bruce’s side to offer a pat on the shoulder and something spoken low enough Steve couldn’t hear. Vision hesitated a moment, looking to Wanda who was still curled in on herself. She looked up with a smile, noticing his gaze, before tilting her head after Sam, and Vision must have taken that as approval to do as Tony asked.
Tony closed the door, bottle of water now in hand. He opened it, moving to the island to drop the cap on it. He took a small sip before placing it beside the cap. “Back there. With Bruce. You guys get into a fight I don’t know about? Not that it’s necessarily any of my business, but...”
“Hey, Tony?”
The familiarity of it all hurt more than he’d imagined. He was there, they all were. Flashes of blue and red and black, hands throwing punches, bodies dodging, the shield whizzing off of walls and armor, calculated blasts fired in self-defense and anger.
Bruce looked at Steve a moment, then to Tony, thinking, before shrugging a shoulder. “Well, I mean, we haven’t exactly made it a priority, but--”
Steve sighed. “I wasn’t...pining after you. I just wanted to--”
“Worried, huh? About mean ol’ Pepper calling me?” Tony said with the quirk of a brow, and Steve turned away, feeling called out.
“Is that longing I hear in your voice, Stark?”
“Stop thinking and kiss me, yeah?” Tony averted, leaning forward. Steve leaned up on his elbows quickly, hand reaching out to pull at Tony’s nape, dragging him closer.
“You love it,” Tony teased, and let Steve kiss him again, slower but no less desperate.
He hadn’t expected Steve’s teeth to scrape along his skin afterward, and he really hadn’t expected those teeth to bite down, sucking hard. Steve’s tongue followed the bite, warm and wet, and Tony shivered.
Tony raised a hand, mouth slowly beginning to work. “Stop talking.”
“Goddammit,” Tony cursed quietly, but with the beginnings of a smile. “You know, I meant it when I said I wasn’t ignoring you. It was just, every time I saw you all I could think about was what I’d seen, and I thought...I was afraid that you’d--”
Tony didn’t know what he’d been expecting when he and Steve went back inside, but it definitely wasn’t to have Steve crowd him up against the nearest wall and kiss him, hard and desperate.
Steve considered heading to the nearest punching bag. That had always been one of his go to places, especially after the ice. The act of physically hitting something felt good, a way to direct his feelings in a way that didn’t cause harm to anyone else. He always needed to be careful with his super strength, so the ability to just let lose was therapeutic in a way. But this time, he didn’t want to hit anything. Didn’t think any physical force could make him feel better. Because it wasn’t anger or frustration that was simmering inside him. It wasn’t pain or sadness, either. Instead, it felt more like guilt, embarrassment for having acted as he did while still being called out on it. Being seen right through, when he hadn’t even been able to see himself.
“Blame you,” Steve finished for him, sighing. Had he really caused Tony to think so little of him? “Tony, the only reason I get mad at you for these things is because I care about you. You understand that, right?”
Tony felt a bit smug, hands running over Steve’s back. “I know you will. And I’ll never let you forget it.”
Steve considered this. “Then who--”
Watching Tony and Bruce go back and forth which other, finishing each other’s sentences and smiling in that way that only people who’d been spending almost too much time together to solve a problem could, Steve felt that thing slowly unfurl in his chest, crawling up his throat, inching along his tongue, begging to be let out.
Natasha scoffed, one hand on the kitchen counter. “I’m talking about you making Bruce out to be the bad guy. Turning against Sam. I’d hate to see what you’d say to Pepper if she ever showed her face around here.”
Seeing Steve naked wasn’t as weird as Tony thought it might be. Having grown up practically idolizing the man, remembering how much his dad had raved about him during one in a million family dinners, he thought there might be some ingrained awkwardness between them because of it.
Steve smiled as he dismounted, taking slow easy strides to Tony. He hesitated at the bottom of the porch stairs before looking back at his bike. “It’s easier to maneuver. Makes for a faster getaway. Natasha recommended it.”
“Holy shit,” Tony said aloud, backing up until he hit the glass storefront of some shop, eyes darting up and down the street. Chitauri sped by overhead on their weird hover bikes, and he caught sight of familiar red, white, and blue coming his way. The clang of metal meeting flesh followed.
. This couldn’t be happening. Had he changed the timeline? Created a new one? Would Steve still be alive when he got back? Would he be? He felt like he was spiraling, falling further and further into god knows where.
Steve didn’t hesitate. “You try so hard to let the world know that you and Howard aren’t the same, but I knew him and I know you. Just like I know how desperately you want to be able to go off and play goddamn house with Pepper just to prove you can be a better father than him. Just to prove that you can raise a kid without it turning out like you.”
Tony couldn’t see Steve’s face well enough in the dark, but he liked to imagine it looked guilty.
Standing, Tony looked around. It was a quaint bedroom, modestly furnished and smelling impossibly of rustic domesticity. Voices from behind led him to the closest window.
Tony practically melted into the touch, free hand pressing against Steve’s chest and gripping the fabric tight, definitely wrinkling it. He eventually allowed Steve to do as he please, taking a back seat as Steve nipped at his lips, exploring slowly as he essentially poured all the things he’d been feeling the last few months into this thing between them. Admitting just how right everyone had been. That he had been jealous, practically boiling over with it, and it wasn’t until Tony had let him have him that he’d realized how possessive of the man he was. He wanted anything and everything he had to give, and hated the idea of sharing it with anyone else to an overwhelming point.
“You alright?” Steve asked, ever the gentlemen, and Tony wanted to laugh.
A muffled voice on Natasha’s end interrupted them. She said something back, mouth away from the phone, probably covered with one hand. Spies, Tony begrudged, wanting to roll his eyes. “Natasha? You still there?”
Someone cleared their throat, and Tony looked to Natasha now at his side. “Hate to break up the moment, but Bruce really needs to get you checked out. After that, you’re gonna need to rest.”
Steve pulled away slowly, pressing a few slow kisses to Tony’s mouth as the two of them began to breathe again, and Tony closed his eyes against it, hand uncurling from Steve’s shirt. When he opened them, he only smiled, leaning in close enough to press his forehead to Steve’s.
Tony didn’t say anything, but took the lifted hand and placed it back down, placing his own hand on top of it, holding it in place. “Were you really jealous?”
“Then don’t go,” Tony breathed, hands pulling Steve down so his mouth ghosted over his before kissing him gentle and slow.
. “Listen, I know Natasha was the one who called, so don’t feel like you need to keep talking. I understand if you have something more important to--”
Tony hooked his legs behind Steve’s thighs, dragging him closer. “Damn right. Now, I do believe we’ve got about four years of sexual tension to make up for. So, get to it, yeah?”
Natasha took the hit in stride, stepping closer. “You’re letting your judgement get clouded because of your feelings. You can’t lead like this.”
Natasha eyed him, leaning against the table. “I’m talking about you giving Sam hell today for no reason.”
The thought saddened him, and he mentally kicked himself for it.
“Hmm,” Tony hummed, thumb running against Steve’s skin. Steve jumped, and Tony lifted his hands slowly as Steve pulled his own back.
Steve could only blink at the words, practically frozen as Tony’s hand moved along his neck to cup right under his face. They stared at each other a moment, Steve’s brain finally catching up to the moment, and, as if on cue, Tony asked, “Is it okay if I...”
Steve tried to answer, but even he wasn’t sure. It was like even looking at Tony just made him...“I don’t know. Sorry.”
“No, you really don’t.” Steve gave a huff of a laugh, something edging on manic, lost. “God, you have no idea.  I had thought that maybe by not telling you certain things I was helping you. I thought maybe I could protect you, help focus you on all the good in your life. But really all I was doing was hurting you even more. I thought…I thought I could be this wall between you and the rest of the world, but I realized you didn’t need that. You don’t need me. You’ve been doing fine all these years without me. God, how much strength and perseverance and determination it must have taken to get you where you are today, and you did all of it without me in your life. You said that you’re no good without me, yet that’s the farthest thing from the truth. You’re so amazing, Tony, and I’m just sorry I couldn’t see it before now. I wish I could have. Maybe things would have been different if I did.”
Steve frowned. “Thanks.”
Steve didn’t move when Tony cradled his face in his hands, eyes trained on only him. Willing Steve to understand.  To let whatever was going on in his head go.
Just the name was enough to shut him up. “Right. Rambling. Sorry. What I mean to say is that, it’s okay. Us talking. Right now. I’m, uh, glad you’re doing okay. You are doing okay, right?”
Tony pulled out the phone, looking at the ID. “Sorry, that’s Pepper. We’ve got a lunch date, which.....” He checked his watch, frowning. “I am now fifteen minutes late for. Shit.”
“Where are you going?” Steve said eventually, voice unreadable but lacking any real bite.
“Oh, hey,” Tony said, looking between Steve and Natasha quickly before returning to his phone. He waited until the two of them caught up to him before pocketing it. “What’s up? You look sweaty.”
He took the time to close his eyes, and breathed in deep. Released that breathe. Breathed in again. Released. His hand grew colder as he did this, but the frigid temperature seemed to sober him. So he let himself sit firmly on the damp grass, hand still submerged.
The sound of rushing wind and monstrous engines got him to open his eyes, and suddenly he was on a helicarrier staring into open sky as he watched Steve work at a panel in the wall, talking to Iron Man over the comms. But then he blinked and he was in Sokovia, watching Thor and Steve battle an army of robots while they herded civilians onto rescue ships.
, Tony thought, every part of him frozen in fear, throat unable to say something, say anything.
“I just think he should be...more involved. He’s still part of the team, but we haven’t had a chance to even talk seriously about, well, anything.” And it was true. After Ultron, Tony has basically dumped Steve with the others at the compound and left without a word. Whenever he did visit, it was always to either talk to Rhodey or drop off a new invention.
Better.
Steve reached a hand up to rest gently against Tony’s jaw, warm and gentle. Tony closed his eyes and tried his best not to lean into the touch.
“Sorry, I was just,” He looked around a moment before spotting the fridge and pointed to it. “Looking for some water. Public speaking always dries me out faster than a sauna. Am I interrupting something?”
Tony sighed, as if expecting the question. “What aren’t I trying to fix? After Ultron, I needed to... make amends. Right my wrongs, and all that stuff. I fucked up, and I’m not too proud to admit it, even if it does hurt.” He threw Steve a cheeky grin, but when Steve didn’t react to it, it dropped, returning his expression to something more serious, grimmer. “I also realized that we’re vulnerable. All of us. You, me, the team. There’s so much out there we don’t know about or understand, and I just wanted to protect us from that. But I shut everyone else out while doing so, and that was on me. So, I’m trying. I really am.”
Steve didn’t really understand, but he said, “Okay,” and Tony seemed pleased by that.
Somehow, he knew the Tony Stark across from him wasn’t breathing.
He’d never brought it up after that, and neither had Steve. The team too concerned with murderous robots and Clint’s secret family. As always, everything else had just gotten in the way.
They sat like that a while, just touching each other, keeping close, before Tony broke the moment, hand dropping from Steve. Steve missed it instantly.
Steve’s expression grew increasingly pained, and his voice was now low, almost hesitant. “Because I know you don’t mean it. I know it’s not what you want, not really. It’s just what you think you should do, and I could never let you do that. I can’t let you sacrifice yourself just to spare me my feelings.”
