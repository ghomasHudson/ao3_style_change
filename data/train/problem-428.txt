Watson picked up a tea cup and the biscuit tin and poured himself some tea. He sighed and put away the thought of gleaning deeper meaning from the drinkware.
“Can I help you?” says a voice from behind him.
“The Strand, like all of the others.”
Holmes toed at a crunchy green mound of sea kale releasing a swarm of small bugs. “How long until the radishes can be harvest?” Holmes said. He was trying to sound disinterested, but Watson knew better.
Will Holmes find a radish he likes?
“Don’t forget the bread and other accompaniments. The fish was a nice change.
The morning grew late before he felt well enough to consider the unsolved mysteries already presented to him earlier in the morning in the morning. He went with the easier one – breakfast. Yesterday the housekeeper was in and she wouldn’t be today, thus Holmes made breakfast.
“If not, the rabbit will likely enjoy the radish experiment far more than me,” said Holmes, setting two plates on the table.
In a soft voice, Holmes asked, “Have you eaten anything? There are eggs and toast.”
Holmes took a long drink, shook his head no, and took another bite into the bread again.
Next morning John felt well enough to attempt a crossword puzzle. He chewed on his pen when Sherlock walked into his room. He looked down at John’s answers and smirked.
“To forever put me off radishes. I did like them, I just don’t want to eat another in a very long time.”
Watson paused his climb of the stairs as he yawned and he shook his head before continuing. At the top of the stairs, he saw that the door to the laboratory was open. He walked over and leaned against the doorway to watch Holmes work. Holmes was bent over the bench and pouring liquid from one tests tube to another. A cigarette was slowly burning in a dish next to him and the smoke curled upwards until it was disrupted by the faint breeze. The window was cracked to allow some of the fumes to escape into the cold night air. Compared to some of his work in Baker Street, the fumes from this work often had a better smell. Holmes was fascinated not just by the hives and the colony social structure, but by the honey his bees produced. Using his knowledge of chemistry, he set out to analyse their honey. Thankfully, honey produced a much better smell compared to mud from the Thames.

Between then, they had their hands entwined together. Watson rubbed the backs of Holmes’ hands with his thumb.
Some forget their time in Narnia, whilst others try to hold onto an escaping memory.
Steam shot from the kettle. Taking care as to not trigger the room to spin again, Watson slowly took it off and added the boiling water to the teapot.
"Sherlock, it starts in two weeks. You will be in London dressed in appropriate work attire."
“Sherlock,” I breathed between moans. “I’m close. This is not how I want you.”
“No, two. You brought out a glass when you were visiting me earlier this week. You left it because I had given you jars of honeycomb to bring inside.”

Holmes disagrees with a conclusion in Lombroso’s book.
“Hey,” he said lifting his hands in the surrender pose. “I’m not the one who cocked-up their bike.” The rider dropped his hand with the smouldering cigarette and sighed. “Are you going to continue to be a knob, or are you going to ask for help get your bike out of the ditch?”
He flushed slightly. “That is part of the appeal, but then we couldn’t have coded discussions about what awaits us when we get home.”
So much for the laziest man in shoe leathers.

Holmes’ voice was muffled once again. “And I will likely not change my opinion of radishes.”
He needed a distraction.
“He is arguing that obesity is linked to promiscuity,” Holmes said. “Think back to our own experiences; we’ve seen thin women with angelic faces committing the blackest crimes and fat women with the gentlest souls. There is no correlation.”
Sherlock breath was warm on his lips. “Does that mean you don’t want to?”
“Holmes, do you trust me?”
“Yes. More accurately, I have disliked all of the radish varieties that I have sampled previously."
“Oh? That would be?”
Prompt: The object closest to you on your left is now your prompt. Mine was a bath towel.
Holmes had stood and was beginning to walk up the path. “As you need time to recover from your shock, I will check on my bees.” He popped another radish in his mouth.
They fumbled together, working the trousers and pants down. John guided Sherlock to sit sideways on the bike before John sank onto his knees. His fingertips ghosted up the inside of Sherlock’s legs to his straining erection.
“No, nor did this other author.” Holmes gestured at the book in his lap. “But, if someone were to die of an attack, how do you suppose it would happen?”
Watson turned his attention to surveying the crop. “Will you help harvest?”
I offered Holmes the book and he opened it to the offending passage before handing it back to me to read aloud. “This greater weight among prostitutes is confirmed by the notorious fact of the obesity of those who grow old in their vile trade, and who gradually become positive monsters of adipose tissue.”
“I came in to prepare lunch. Tea?” Holmes said lifting the kettle before starting to heat it. Soon the room was filled with sounds of rummaging through cupboards.
Watson dropped the fabric and lifted his face to look at Holmes. “You use those glasses because Mrs Lloyd perfumed-“
Arriving at the front door, Watson stomped his feet to dislodge mud and grass. Adding to his annoyance, he realized that he had no free hand to immediately open the door. He shuffled the items in his arms and dropped one of the gloves. At that moment the door opened and he was greeted by Holmes. Holmes was in one of his suits he typically wore when going into town.
“Then at least consider modifying the plan. If you want to do this thoroughly and test as many possible varieties and radish preparation to find one you might like, it might be better if we plant each week. The radishes will be harvested over time instead of everything at once. That way we can try multiple preparation methods overtime.”
“But Holmes, we are going to have a lot of radishes even if we remove the one extra variety. I will be eating radishes for every meal. Was your plan to make me dislike them?”
Sherlock highly doubted that. “What does it matter what preference I have? It doesn’t make the event appear more or less frequently.”
Watson inhaled sharply. “Holmes!” The pebbles were giving way under his bare feet as he tried to move resisting his need to get to Holmes quickly.
“I moved them to your plate when you weren’t looking.” He lifted his fork with the skewered pea and picked up another morsel. Before taking another bite, Holmes said, “Go back to the original plans and radish varieties. That is fine enough for my purposes.”
“Good,” said Watson. “I like the one signal we have, and it would be acceptable if that one alone remained.”
“And you need crash bars. “
Holmes glared at him. “Not the point.”
Watson found this all hateful. He mentally swore coarse oaths at the dove. He considered burning the windchime to silence the racket. Groaning and rolling over, he tossed the blankets over his head and willed the sun to go away. That led to over-heating and he tore back the covers in despair.
“Or I could continue with my plan and we could give any extras to Mrs. Lloyd.”
Watson could see strand-like red marks forming and gently prodded the injury. Holmes hissed in response saying, “You would have been hurt.”
"But Holmes!"
In the dim light of our rooms, I could see that the rag Holmes had pressed against his side was red. The wrap around his hand was also stained in red.
“Nah, we all got that deer in the headlights look.” The man smiles and John laughs. “Names Greg.”
He laid on his back, and I kissed him hungrily. My moustache pressed into my upper lip when I slowly ran my lips down his side. He squirmed as I made my way down his neck. I knew he was sensitive on his sides and could be reduced to a writhing mess if I changed my touch into a tickle. As much as seeing him gasping for air while being tickled was a hidden pleasure of mine, I kept on task. I had more important matters to attend.
Sherlock gave him a quizzical look.
They kissed and slowly undressed before entering the slower. This openness scared him, but John wanted this and the intimacy with Sherlock. John maneuvered him under the spray and poured Sherlock’s posh shower gel on a flannel. He tried to show his love with each movement of the flannel over Sherlock’s arms and shoulders. His hand stilled over the scar on Sherlock’s chest. John looked up to his face and felt shame at the pain he caused.
John’s eyes went wide at the sight and his hand flexed with the desire to touch. He knew exactly what Sherlock was doing and it was driving him wild. Any higher-level thinking that had managed to linger after the sight of Sherlock on the bike went offline. He wanted. He wanted his hands on that skin and in that hair. That gorgeous neck begged to be kissed and nipped. He wanted to take that man apart with his mouth.
“I don’t want food.” Sherlock released John giving him a knowing look.
“But...”
“You did, but there is something we did not consider at the beginning of this experiment. As the radish ages, the taste changes. The radish you are holding has been properly watered and tended.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes when he heard the tapping of rigid heals on paving stones.
Bringing the tea things to the sink, Watson started washing them. Through the window over the sink, he watched the steady downpour soak the grasses on the Downs and a gull battling the wind gusts. The rain showed no sign of letting up and he resigned himself to staying in doors for the evening. Tea things washed, he shovelled more coal on the fire to drive away the drafts. He settled down at his desk intent on reviewing the plan Holmes drew up.
Watson rested his hand on Holmes’ shoulder and in the dwindling light gazed fondly at the eccentric man he loved. He decided he would not have him any other way, even if it meant being subjected to another radish experiment.
I reached my destination and breathed in the odour trapped in the black curly hairs surrounding his prick. I slicked my finger before my mouth descended to his prick and my finger traced his entrance. He shifted his leg and gave me better access and my other hand held his hips still. I teased and slipped a finger in slowly breaching him causing him to give a muffled groan. I looked up to see his arm draped over his mouth. I pressed my finger in further and wait for the muscles to adjust to my presence before returned my mouth to his prick. I was surrounded - I in him, and he in my mouth – and it was perfect.
“It’s a start.”
“Then you’ll be back home, and we can catch up on our mother-son time. I’ve booked us tickets already."
Before the term's assessments, the tiresome guy he had slept with last weekend had mentioned magnetism. Tried to describe it too as some indescribable pull towards another human. Sherlock has not felt that for the man.

He pounded the earth with is hand. Pain flared, and he bit back a groan. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
“Yes, but it felt wrong. The song “summertime” was playing, but it’s also wrong.” John cleared his throat and tried to sing. “Summertime and the living's easy.” He stopped and grinned sheepishly. “That song. Anyway, I was alone then an unexpected visitor startled me.”
To Sherlock's own surprised, he paid attention. Sort of. Paying attention did not mean he was willing to purchase, though. Whoever was in charge of purchasing for that shop had no taste and he made his opinions clear on that. He would buy the black leather jacket, full faced helmet, and gloves from another dealer. The motorcycle chaps were a little much - he’ll save that purchase for another day.
“Very good. To the first sample.” Holmes rubbed his hands together expectantly before lifted his hand palms up expectantly.
“John, are you ok?” asks the instructor.
“Evening Stackhurst, I see you have not taken your usual route,” said Holmes opening the door for their guest.
“I wanted to apologize.”
Prompt: A black and white photograph of a park at night. A transparent silhouette of a figure can be seen.
“Good morning,” said Sherlock cheerfully.
Holmes frowned. “If you say so resident expert in these things. Well, ‘the good doctor had passed beyond my keen’ might do.”
Holmes smirked and stepped closer, effectively trapping their hands in between their bodies. “I could show you one of my favourite habits.” He looked down at Watson’s lips and Watson felt a surge of warmth go through him. “That is, if you are interested.” Watson nodded, and Holmes leaned forward pressing their lips together.
Holmes smiled and Watson could only smile back.
With effort, they stood the bike on its wheels.
“Perhaps shock to an already weakened system,” Watson ventured. “Or maybe it is similar to a hornet sting and only some poor souls have a violent reaction.”
“You could just continue thinning, and plant something else… Maybe a flower that the bees would like. Yes, we need to put in more of those. Think of the subtle flavours it would impart in the honey.” Holmes trailed off, thoughtfully.
He told himself that the feeling of missing something was because bike held no more mystery, no puzzle, no interest. It had been a distraction – nothing more. It was easier not to remember the joy or how he felt free on his bike. The memories were packed away in his mind palace with the same care that he used to cover the bike in the shed. As he hid the key, he reminded himself that it was hardly a complicated puzzle and he was done with it.
“Have you heard of anyone dying of an attack?” said Holmes suddenly.
The plans...
Watson had picked up a radish leaf and was curling it around his finger. “I thought we’d have finished the lot we planted after only eating radishes for a fortnight.”
Mummy fussed. Sherlock ignored and locked his room. He remained silent through her fussing and questioning his judgment, longing for a cigarette and a change of location. The lack of riding and mental stimulation would surely end him soon, and it had been less than twenty-four hours.
“Just imagine,” said Watson in a hopeful voice as he motioned to the trellis. “In a week or so, the peas will be ready to harvest. The spinach and lettuce are doing wonderfully and we’ll continue enjoying those. I’ve already been enjoying some older radishes from my other bed, which you are welcome to eat,” said Watson and Holmes shook his head. “At least, we should have some something from the garden to share with Stackhurst at dinner tomorrow.”
He closed his eyes and sighed. His bike was here, and his summer was looking infinitely more exciting.
“I need data. The opening to the spirit world only appears here at this time. I intend to go there.”
The red-head flicked his cigarette away. “Alright, pup, I’ll show you.”
“You have,” said Watson slowly while he flipped idly through the document deciding whether to comment further or not. Holmes was proud of his work and Watson could hear it in his voice. Watson wanted to support this work and ensure it was published, yet would he take kindly to Watson directly challenging him on that statement? If offended, Holmes might take an oath of silence and destroy the unbelievable document in his hands. Perhaps a less direct approach was needed to get a better understanding of this work and suggest the likely changes. “This is what you have been working on since the jellyfish encounter?”
“Yes,” Watson groaned and scrubbed his face with his free hand. “There is no deep, complex mystery to it.”
“Oh, it is! I am responsible for the bake goods,” Mrs Lloyd said with pride.
“Don’t just stand there like a fish. Turn it on, son. I tuned her up nice just for you.”
A frog visits Watson’s practice. (ACD)
He gathered up the gloves he had brought in that morning and took time tying his shoes that had now dried from the morning dew. He put on his hat and went out. As he walked down the path, he remembered one of the large weeds from last year. It had been overlooked in a remote and forgotten corner of his garden and flourished. The weed would not move after several attempts at pulling it. Watson had pulled harder and it suddenly gave way, sending a shower of dirt in all directions. Watson had tipped; the force rolled him onto his back with an umph. He had mentally checked himself over for injuries, finding none, he had looked up at Holmes from the flat of his back.
“Actually, yah. It takes a lot of strength to do some of the moves and it’s fun to see what your body can do. I’m getting way more flexible even from the short time I’ve been here.”
“I’ve got 199 more. Would you prefer an orange or a banana?”
Hey all, so my brain went through a spaz and I was having problems with this fic. Thankfully, the amazing Small_Hobbit came with encouragements, mighty beta-ing abilities, and thus helped me out of the funk. Things are moving along and Small_Hobbit has graciously offered to beta the rest of the work (thank you!!!!).
“I’m sure that’s typically not done with radishes. If so, the meaning could be jealousy or rejected love or hatred.”
Watson woke with a start. His body immediately went into high alert. Had he heard something? Where was Holmes? On instinct, he reached over only to find himself alone. Had he only dreamed Holmes coming to bed with him last night?
Sherlock highly doubted that, but was too eager to turn on the bike than argue with the man. He put the key in the ignition and twisted it. Lights blinked on. His body thrummed with anticipation as he mounted the bike and balanced it between his legs. He shimmied, and the heavy weight of the bike wiggled underneath him. Sherlock was certain he was smiling like an idiot.
He should have swum yesterday, especially after attending Mrs Lloyd’s house with Dr Watson. It would have done him good to clear his head instead of having thoughts swirl until the small hours of the night. Stackhurst had been excited about the invitation, and to spend time with Mrs Lloyd, even if it was with the object of her pursuits. Well, the former object of her pursuits.
Holmes turned to face him, and Watson dropped his arms. The moonlight illuminated Holmes’ mischievous smile that Watson had been privy to many times before. Holmes continued, “you’d think that after years of my particular influences and teaching, eccentric and unconventional as they may be-”
Watson felt Holmes take a deep breath and exhale loudly. “No. I... no.”
A.N.: It’s a little awkward, but it’s done.
“As both a writer and a gardener, I can wax or wane as I please - I could begin describing your beekeeping in such terms if you would like.”
Watson blinked. He turned, took off his hat, and crossed his arms with his hat still in his hand. “Two? Surely you mean three. I just brought in three.”
Returning home, he tucked the bike away in a spot he had commandeered in the shed and went inside.
“You mentioned that you wanted to add another garden bed,” said Holmes.
John’s questioning look went ignored as Sherlock searched the space above him. He reached above a rafter and pulled down a set of keys. They rattled in his hand as he searched the work bench retrieving a rag.
After taking a sip, Holmes spoke. “You will not recall the original case because it was shortly after your marriage. It was before the business with the Red-headed league. I had not bothered recounting it to you.”
That was the issue with soul bonds; it was possible to have weak connections with others. The strength of the bond depended on the compatibility between the two people: the more compatible, the stronger the bond. The fortunate with highly compatible bonds were said to be mentally linked and through that link could know their companion’s thoughts and feelings. Couples with the weakest bonds only experienced the strongest of emotions from their soul bond. Highly compatible bonds were rare. It was often easier to find someone who was at least partially compatible and established a weak bond.
Verse: BBC
“One I beginning to regret.”
“Never,” Watson said through a soft laugh. “I have no memory of that particular promise.”
“But you broke one.”
Perfectly ripe green peapods were a nice addition to his morning breakfast. The crunching in Watson’s head slowed into silence at the sound of the gate squeaking open and Holmes joining him. Watson swallowed as he watched Holmes set a basket down by his feet. Watson handed him a peapod and took a bite of his own before taking note of the glass in Holmes’ hand.
Watson turned the tap. The hose swelled and shuddered, yet the state of the patch was obscured by the grass. He slowly walked the length of the hose inspecting every inch for the presence of new tears as he made his way to the patch. That patch would hold, he told himself; he was good at keeping fluids where they were designed to be.
John loved the feeling of Sherlock’s weight in his mouth. He stroked the underside with his tongue as he bobbed his head. John pulled back to the tip and swirled his tongue under the foreskin. He savoured the taste and feeling before pulling Sherlock’s length further down. He heard Sherlock’s appreciation as he moaned out John’s name. He breathed in hard from his nose and caught the musty scent of arousal.
It was really the sand on the pavement's fault. He, like any other mortal on this earth, was governed by physics. If you were traveling and took a sharp turn on loose sand, you would fall. Simple story. Simple physics. Simply idiotic.
He hid it from Mycroft, knowing he wouldn’t approve. Besides, he was in complete control and knew exactly what he was doing.
We exchanged looks of ‘need you,’ ‘now,’ and ‘bed,’ but we were both far too clothed. Holmes pushed me back and led me towards his bedroom. I slightly delayed his efforts with needy kisses, vaguely recalling the tinkling of glass when we bumped the wooden table that his chemistry experiments occupied. The gropes of his arse were necessary as it was still covered in those fine trousers.
Watson looked over at Holmes who suddenly became very interested in the end of his walking stick.
My hands stroked his pale sides, up his chest, causing his breath to quicken. My prick stiffened at the sound.
Where ever he looked at the wardrobe, he felt like he should be expecting something. Anything. A vapor of a memory swirled around in his mind and he was unable to catch it. He had felt this feeling before, but that was during his childhood. He kept reaching through his garments and touching the back of the wardrobe expecting to feel something or, perhaps, someone. Yet, it was always the smooth back of the wardrobe.
John concentrated on his task and was rewarded by Sherlock’s muffled cry as he spilled down John’s throat. As Sherlock breathed hard to recover, John slid off and makes quick work of his trousers and pants to stroke one out. It wasn’t long before he spilled across the wooden floor.
“We could try eating the leaves,” said Watson. “I have heard they are edible.”
He raised his eyebrow at me. “I will still investigate cases which will likely be dangerous.”

Transcribing from shorthand to longhand usually organized his thoughts - except for today.
“But aren’t we talking right now?”
“Not in the least - should I have?”
Sherlock gaped at him forgetting how words worked. If it had been any other day under any other circumstances, he would have ripped him apart. Slowly, he nodded- he could almost hear the squeaks from this rusty movement.
While many of London’s occupants and myself were miserable from the heat, my companion was giddy with excitement.
Thanks to all who subscribed, kudoed, and commented on the fic.
Snow, whipped up by the wind, was weaving itself into the cracks in my armour of bundled clothing as Sherlock Holmes and I journeyed back home to Baker Street. I glanced at Holmes who was equally bundled and pressed against my side. I reached over and placed my gloved hand on his lower thigh. He looked at me and, even though I could not see his entire expression due to the blue scarf covering his face, I knew there was a smirk there from the look in his eyes. This ride back to Baker Street was agony, but agony laced with the best kind of anticipation.
“No.”
She nodded her head.
“Your ability to remember conversations and details needed to spin a tale is superb, I have no doubt, but you do remember the speed at which you pounced on me—?“
After a week of practice, Sherlock had ventured onto a motorway. His body felt like it has received a light beating from the wind at that speed. His arms ached. He could not have been any more pleased.
“If you are referring to mixing two chemicals together for a reaction, then yes, I did.” Holmes looked to his side before realizing that Watson no longer there, but behind him, motionless. He sighed. “The reaction, which was completely harmless, went faster than anticipated and it was something I was planning on doing anyway. I had a few moments before we left and I thought I would try it.”
“That is what I remember. Perhaps my tastes will change, or new varieties will be available next year. Who knows what next year will bring.”
“You can get a replacement part for that,” said the rider, in a reassuring voice. It grated Sherlocks nerves.
“I suspected.”
“While this,” he continued and lightly brushed his fingertips closed on the back of my hand, “this would mean that I have plans to take you in my mouth and have my way with you.”
"Look at that, you can be reasonable. You can still buy the bike, but we have to install a restriction kit because you are not 21. We'll do that free of charge since you purchased the bike here." The man scribbled something on the sales agreement.
The twinge of craving twisted in Sherlock’s stomach. He ignored it and got up on his own, wincing as he did. He grabbed the handle bars. The other biker stopped mid puff and assessed him. “How long have you been riding?” He asked while the tantalizing cigarette bounced in his mouth.
They stayed there for some time, both lost in their own thoughts as they huddled close sharing warmth. Watson would not press and waited for Holmes to speak if he wished. The companionable silence stretched between them, and Watson was glad for the familiarity of it and that Holmes allowed himself to be warmed by his embrace.
Watson chuckled. “I regret that I have not tried your scones.”
Watson picked up the papers and traced the writing with his finger before looking up at Holmes. It was one thing for Holmes to claim that he would write a case many years ago, and another to be holding the materialized manuscript. “You wrote. One… I mean, you wrote up a case.”
Watson yawned as he followed footsteps through the fallen morning dew. He wondered how long it would take Holmes to trod down the grass between their cottage and the shed housing the beekeeping and gardening tools. Approaching the shed, Watson saw the weathered wooden door open and Holmes energetically emerge carried two pairs of forks and hoes.
John groaned and pressed forward. He felt Sherlock smile under his lips, so he pressed forward, hard, before pulling back. “I came to find you to see if you wanted anything to eat.”
Watson stopped and then slowly nodded.
“You could try one,” said Watson holding up a tiny radish seedling he had just pulled out of the ground. He bit another one, enjoying the spicy flavour of the thread-like radish root.
Watson opened his mouth as if to speak but chose to collapse against the sink instead. He turned his face up towards the ceiling and shut his eyes. Holmes shuffled towards him.
“No, you did this to yourself. You made me wait.”
Claimed the advertisement. Watson adjusted a kink near the patched hole in his hose and walked back towards the house. He had sworn to himself that he would not purchase another one this early in the season after the first tear occurred, soaking his trouser leg and half his shirt in the process. It was designed to be the last hose he would ever need to buy, and last hose he would buy it would be, at least for this season.
He was quiet as I helped him remove the ruined clothing. I began my examination with gentle prods from my fingers. As I worked, I felt a strange sensation. It felt tingly and extremely pleasant. My brain stuttered; this feeling was impossible because I was wearing gloves. I should not be able to start forming a soul bond. I glanced at Holmes and he remained as impassive as ever. Perhaps I was mistaken. I chose to ignore it and kept my sight on his wound.
“But you dislike radishes.”
“There were salads. The radish and pretzel one I will be unlikely to forget for some time nor will Mrs Glydon. There are some we will be unable to try until the autumn because the other ingredients are not ready yet.”
Holmes considered this. “No, I have changed my mind.”
Watson hesitated and swallowed. “Holmes, it is impersonal. For a manuscript on deductions for strictly teaching purposes, it would be fine; but, for a story to be published in… where?
Sherlock glaring at the tracker was all the response he gave.
Sherlock glared at him.
Written for the fan_flashwork prompt diary.
Through the window, Watson saw a bent over figure briskly walking up the path to the door. Holmes burst through the door with the rain on his heels trying to follow him indoors.
Reluctantly removing my mouth from his hand, I said with a tone of mock accusation, “You planned this.”

“You. Maybe you were an expected visitor. Donno,” John mumbled and drifted asleep.
“I like it.” Holmes bit into another one and chewed thoughtfully. “It is not the taste I remember.”
“Sherlock. He’s the instructor for the upper level students. Only works with those he hand-picks. An absolute pain in the ass to work with, but he’s brilliant and his form is perfect. His speciality is aerial silks. He creates these beautiful and complicated routines.” They both watch Sherlock climb the silk in a move that makes him look like he’s climbing upside down as he performs split after split. “My girlfriend says it’s an honour to work with him, if you can stand his personality.”
The pastoral sounds of birds, bees, and beasts were slowly replaced with more man-made varieties of cars, chatter, and clinking metal. They dodged bicyclists and passed groups of children trundling hoops and jumping rope on their route to the high street. Once there, they separated and Watson started on his errands. He needed to send a wire to Mr Longman for more compost and fertilizer, since the new garden bed was rather barren and purchase a new variety of radish to replace the one he removed from Holmes’ plan. He considered stopping by the Veteran’s Office. Sprigg’s Bookshop happened to be on his way to the pub where he was to meet Holmes for lunch. Watson thought he would see if anything was of interest today since his other book was almost finished.
. That was Sherlock in his parent's shed perfectly silhouetted with dust motes floating about. His head was bowed slightly, and he was holding large canvas cover which puddled around his legs. While the sight was angelic, it was the delicate hand hovering above the chrome handle bars of an insanely sexy cruiser. John's brain stuttered to a halt.
The first touch of the Channel waters to his toes caused Stackhurst to recoil from shock. It was cold, but what did he expect from his first swim of the year? He needed this distraction even if he was likely to catch his death from this swim. As usual for this time of year, there was the normal mountains of paperwork and grading student’s papers. After being inside for hours, he began wondering why he assigned essays in the first place when it was only creating more work for himself.
“Of course.”  The red-haired rider walked back to his bike and searched through his pockets as he walked. He pulled out a cigarette pack and lighter.
She tidied something in his room before leaving and the door quietly latched behind her. He refused to sleep and let his brain analyse his route and how he rode the bike that day. He did not realize when sleep took him.
“Thank you. Would you mind if I asked for another favour?”
“No, this area we’ve agreed would be devoted to vegetable gardens. Your bees do not need anymore space.” Watson ate the radish thread and looked up at Holmes. “This least awful radish experiment was your idea.”
“Let me examine you,” I said.
“I don’t believe Mrs Hudson ever forgave you for the hole in her wall.”
"Are ones that I have not tried yet. Maybe there is a variety that is slightly better than terrible."
“ ‘Most healthy, young man have little to fear from the stings of this gigantic jellyfish,’ ” read Watson. As Holmes turned and settled himself in the armchair and picked up another book, Watson frowned and swallowed back the comment of
“I believe you did not reply in an acceptable fashion to her previous invitation to tea?” Asked Holmes, still holding the letter and knowing perfectly well what the answer would be.
It took each of his appendages to move the bike and shift. Determining how to move his muscles to accomplish the task was its own sort of high and one he was quickly becoming addicted to. He catalogued how it ran, what it wanted, what it liked. He devoted special places in his mind for the exact place the clutch took, how the gears sounded when he shifted, how the bike turned when he moved his core, and every other minutia. The bike was responsive and rewarded his diligence and whispered promises of freedom and leaving it all behind. He ached to respond.
Holmes had found the unfortunate client’s wife. The altercation between the wife’s unwanted soul bound and soon-to-be soul bound had ended with a broken bottle and Holmes being at the wrong end of it. Holmes had refused to let me examine him at the scene or in the hansom ride home despite my objections. When we got to our chambers, I would insist.
John woke to the feeling of bats taking flight in his head.
As far as deductions go, that was rather obvious. Watson gripped the sink edge hard and kept his attention on the dishes. His head pounded. He swallowed and tried to keep his voice even. “Three. If I didn’t return them, we would be drinking out of our hands.”
John chuckled. “Of course it would something I’ve never heard of. Go on then, tell me what it is.”
He grabbed his pack before he performed his trick of picking up the door, so it opened without a squeak. The moonlight providing enough light to navigate but he did not need it as he knew the way. He avoided the squeaky floorboard at the bottom of the steps. He knew this routine well after practicing it multiple times sneaking ginger nuts when he much younger.
It had to be that bike. Gentle persuasion from the sales associate would not change his mind. No, he did not want a smaller one. No, he was not going to change his mind. No, you are really that obtuse? No, he'd never ridden a bike before. He was a genius and would learn it on his own.
Perhaps Holmes’ sudden desire to be far away from me was because he sensed it too. He was a private man and we had not discussed our opinions on bonding. He might be one of the minority who did not wish to bond.
The thought of that made my already spent prick twitch.
“No.”
Mycroft’s smile was smug as he pocketed the tracker. “Did you expect me not to have some contingency plan, brother mine?
The predawn light was rising. Sherlock noted the coolness of small valleys he rode through. Smells of fresh cut grass and forests you never experienced in the cut off environment of the car. He concentrated on those subtilties of the world around him and the humming sound of the engine. The machine purred beneath him as he racked up mile after mile. It was exactly what he needed.
Holmes stood to the right of Watson, arms akimbo, looking distrustfully at the sprout. “I see no reason to rush things.”
Sherlock huffed. “As wonderful as this family reunion has been, I’ll be on my way.”
Sherlock zoned out the rest of the shop assistant's pitch. Sensing that he lost the potential client's interest, the insistent man moved to put his leg up on the display and put himself in Sherlock’s line of sight.
Watson halted, debating whether to ignore that command or not. ”Holmes, you need help!”
“But it will not succeed,” Watson had said while he dusted off the soil from his knees and behind. He picked up the offending weed and began shaking off the dirt into the garden. “I will need to be more vigilant. The younger weeds are easier to pull and aren’t the source of so many problems.”
“Class, now grab onto the bottom of your hoop with your two hands like this,” the instructor says while demonstrating. “When I tell you, lift your legs.”
Dressed and lying in the bed in what they referred to as Holmes’ room, Watson tried to fall asleep. He could not find a comfortable position and his earlier tiredness had left him. He lay on his back watching the shadows on the walls. He thought about weeds and gardening. Just as his mind began thinking once again about glassware, he heard Holmes walk down stairs, hopefully to eat dinner. The muffled sound of a chair scraping faintly across the floor followed by the clanging of dinner ware seeped through the floor boards. Holmes’ steps seemed to thunder when he came back up and Watson felt himself tense. Holmes might choose to sleep in the other bedroom, leaving him alone tonight. The door creaked open and Holmes came in. Watson slowly exhaled the breath he did know he was holding and tried to pretend he was asleep. Silently, Holmes changed and slipped into the bed and lay on his back. Their arms brushed against each other and Watson considered moving away to give Holmes more space. As if sensing his dilemma, Holmes’ hand sought out his and he laced their fingers together. Watson let out a shuttered breath and squeezed his hand back. He felt himself go heavy from exhaustion and let himself fall into a deep sleep.
Which was not a deterrent in way. “And I will still follow you and offer my protection.”
Sherlock saw miles of green countryside, coastline, and houses. People waved or glared at him as he passed. Dogs tried to chase him only to be stopped by their owner’s leash. It rained and he got soaked. It rained and he smoked while watching the rain from under a bridge. He spent a day by a ruin fixing his bike. He hummed the simple song about the solar system while banking around sharp turns and driving by sheep. Sherlock stopped where he wanted, he took turns on a whim, slept at bike friendly accommodations or the side of the road. Sherlock’s felt himself falling into the same routine, and that was the problem. He needed… something. That feeling took root, and Sherlock grew more restless.
John grasps onto the cool steel hoop with both hands and lets his body hang long underneath it. Brief flashback appears of him being a child hanging on the monkey bars laughing which morphs into his basic training coach yelling at them to cross the bars faster. John shakes his head to dislodge the memory.
“Oh, Sherlock.” The hurts and worry bleeding through Mycroft’s usually careful speech. “This is not the substitute for the bike I hoped you’d take. Anything. Even that motorcycle. Anything but this.”
“It’s ok, I’ll finish,” said John.
I woke in the early afternoon to a feeling an ache in my gut. I had not slept well, and now my body was telling me that the newly formed bond was breaking. Sitting on the edge of my bed, I contemplated whether I could face Holmes today.
Watson felt the urge to take notes on this case and quickly began patting his waistcoat to retrieve his notebook. In his rush, he bumped the table causing some tea to spill from the tea cups.
Holmes shook his head. He took Watson’s hand and pulled him close. “Can I finish now?”
He nodded. “I did not expect to find anyone who was tolerant and a complement to me. I had better things to do then search for a compatible soul bond. “he smiled at me. “And to think that it found me.”
“I was lost in thought over the letter and wanted time to process it.” Holmes hand wandered to Watson’s side and began gathering material there. “Enough, please, we have other matters to attend to.” Goosebumps formed on Watson’s leg as it was exposed to the cool night air.
He ran away on the bike.
Sherlock made no acknowledgement of John’s question. Curious, John stepped near the back of the bike. Sherlock’s eyes were closed tight in concentration. John knew his expressions meant he was rapidly searching through his mind palace. The fluttering of Sherlock’s eyelashes and the look of desperation suddenly increased, and his breathing rate accelerated. These were not normal behaviors for Sherlock and John became concerned.
My plan, whatever it was, foiled, I let him diveste me of my trousers and drawers. With all he put me through this evening, I was eager to have his skilled mouth on me.
“Yes, preferably ones that use a lot of them.”
“Doyle will likely suggest changes.”
Holmes frowned. “That was not my intent.”
“And do you like it?”
time? What couldn’t you do alone?” asked Watson.
John motions for Greg’s attention and points to the dark-haired man. “Who’s he?”
He walked up the steps to his flat carrying his latest find. He wanted to try a new combination as his last hit wasn’t as good as the last. He just needed to tweak it.
“Holmes, why are were hear?” Watson had said after they had taking the short tour of the place. “You have offered me no explanation. Did a murder take place in this home?”
I repeated the action.
“Ah, I see. Would you permit me to perform a simple experiment? It shouldn’t take up much of your time.”
“It’s only for ten days.” She seemed to be reassuring herself more than him.
“Yes, of course. You pull them, wash them, trim them, and eat them.” Deciding to help push the process along a little faster, Watson leaned over to choose another identical radish from the unarranged bowl and held it out to Holmes.
“Other than a fence, no.”
“Well-“ Holmes tried to interject.
“No matter how well made, glasses will eventually break when dropped repeatedly against rocks.”
“the process of something developing.”
Holmes nodded and slowly slid his mouth to my tip. He lifted up slightly. I took in his dishevelled hair and his red swollen lips.
“Lion’s mane… I don’t recall you having a case with a jellyfish in it.”
Watson almost dropped his fork and looked at Holmes. Throughout winter, there had been seed catalogues and the weekly Gardening Illustrated in stacks on his desk. By lamp light, he would flip through them, dog's-ear pages of varieties that looked promising or gardening techniques he should try. He had even sketched out his plans. Holmes had known all of his activities; why bring it up now?
. Holmes, you accept some of his theories.”
“Oh?” Holmes opened his eyes and slowly lifted an eyebrow.
Watson sighed. "Will you tend this garden bed?"
“It’s a perk of gardening.” Watson wiggled the seedling. Holmes made no move to accept the offending vegetable and continued to glare at it.
“Sample A,” Holmes repeated with a little more firmness in his voice. “was acceptable two weeks ago.”
“A familiar message.”
Holmes did not take the radish. “A scientific process. For tasting.”
“But not long enough to know that isn’t how you pick up a bike. Especially a bike of that size.”
Holmes nodded and sat at the table which was already prepared with the tea things. Reluctant to part from the manuscript, Watson considered bringing it to the table, but decided against it in the event of something catastrophic occurring. Holmes began preparing Watson’s tea how he liked it as he sat himself across from Holmes.
Morning after and it’s all fine.
“Yes, I hadn’t forgotten those. I’m still in awe at how Mrs Glydon roasted radishes to the preciseness that you required and repeat it with different seasoning.”
Holmes hummed and tucked the other letters in his waistcoat. “You will be replying yes, of course.”
“How many pickled radish recipes will we be trying?”
“Hey young man, I see you admiring that scooter.”
She stalked down the path with a fire in her eyes fully directed at him. That fire shifted when she caught sight of cigarette ends in her flower pot. She immediately turned on Mycroft who had just lit up another cigarette. Sherlock sniggered as Mummy gesticulates angrily at Mycroft and snatched the cigarette out of his mouth.
He hadn’t decided on an exact route, but he generally wanted to go south. Eventually he’d run out of land and be at one of the coasts. Maps would come later. Finding petrol would come later. He just needed to leave.
Sherlock huffed. "Fine. Nineteen."
His eyes grew mischievous. “John, you are missing the details. The slow sensation of how my hand moved across you.” He shifted and raised his hand up, then stroked it down my chest and brushed my nipple, which caused an undignified whimper to escape my throat.
The sun was beginning to set, and Holmes’ already long shadow was even longer in the late day sun. Holmes pursued the multitude of radish leaves inside his shadow still in the garden. “Even after fulfilling the experiment and your constant sampling, we have radishes a-plenty.”
While Mrs Lloyd tapped her lip as she thought, Watson looked over the top of her hat covered head and saw Holmes cross the street heading towards them. Holmes’ gate and how he set his jaw informed Watson that he was not pleased to see Mrs Lloyd.
“I will be.”
The misty morning brought a chill to the air that caused Watson’s old wounds to ache. He chose to stay indoors and picked up on the writing he had left the few days before. Holmes had been wandering in and out of the cottage all morning.
The bike was strapped tight into its stand and moves very little as Sherlock straddled the recently dusted leather seat. Now that John saw him on that moulded chrome and black sex on wheels seemed made for Sherlock’s body. Those delicate fingers wrapped around the handlebar before moving down to continuing their seductive movement across the gas tank. John knew exactly how those fingers and caress would feel against his skin causing shivers in their wake. John had never felt envious of a machine before, but now he could add that to his list of experiences his partner had added to his life. Waves of lusty thoughts bombarded through John’s brain and he felt the hot prickle race down his back. John imagined himself pressed up against that lithe body, arms wrapped around the slim waist as the wind whipped by them. The vibrations of the bike hitting him just there, teetering on the edge of release. John was lost in his daydream until Sherlock bent over giving John an even better view of his arse. Any attempt at controlling his reactions so Sherlock could focus went right out the window and John let out an involuntary groan. It was one of the sexiest views he’d seen and one that he’d enjoy visiting it in the future whenever he was alone in the shower.
Sherlock tensed as Mycroft stepped close enough to be in arms reach. He reached under the headlight and wiggled something free. His prize was a black box the size of a matchbox. “Such a useful test of this device’s capabilities. It will need to be perfected and the size further decreased, but it did bring me to you.”
“John,” he says.
“Then how do you know that you still dislike that vegetable? You are well aware that tastes change as we age. You might like it now.”
“Fine, tell me.”
The sales associate straightened the stack of papers Sherlock signed and placed them on his desk. He smoothed them out before asking, "How old are you?"
“My dear Watson, are you ill?”
Also, thanks to those who have subscribed and kudo’ed this fic that started as a silly idea and grew.
I was willingly stay, but I didn’t know if the feeling was mutual.
“Just call it gardening. Don’t wax poetically at something that is a pushing around dirt, deterring insects, and killing unwanted plants.”
“In that case, I am eager to read it.”
Note: Borrowing words from Arnold Lobel.
“If we harvest all at once I can be done with this experiment instead of dragging it out. If something happens to that crop, then so much the better.”
Holmes turned to lock the door. The click sounded as loud as gunfire and I, with the burst of energy at the beginning of a race, made my move.
“Browse away! This one is a beauty. Goes from zero to sixty in four seconds. She may not be the fastest on the road, but she sure is pretty. If that’s not your thing, we have plenty of...”
The oysters were fabulous. The unexpected guest, not so much.
He hummed.
The last of my orgasm spasmed through me and I pulled out only to collapse partly on Holmes. We both laid there each other’s arms, and our breath slowed. He wiggled free and cleaned himself. Then he retrieved a flannel for me that he had dampened. I hissed in protest at the cold cloth. Washed, I laid down next to my lover, Sherlock Holmes.
He was utterly absorbed by the bike.
In the distance he heard the roar of another bike. His insides curled with embarrassment. Someone else would see his mistake. The best he could hope for is that they drove away quickly.
“If we do it your way and nothing catastrophic happens to the crop, I would prefer not to waste the excess."
“Or how I kissed you and enjoyed the many uses of that tongue of yours?” Holmes looked me in the eye before snaking his arm around to my back and crushing my body to his. In a move that still puzzles, he flipped us, and on my back, I was looking up at him as he slid down my body and leaned in to kiss my belly. He stopped to lick my naval and the surrounding skin.
He stepped in further and a frigid wave splashed up his leg raising a wave of goosebumps over his body. He inhaled sharply and waited for the initial pain from the frigid water to subside.
He turned. “Good. Good, would you please sit on the edge of your bed?”
“In summary, I am trying to convince you to remove your trousers, post-haste.”
“I was picking up this,” he produced a whiskey bottle from his bag. ”I had to leave early as they are fixing a pipe and the pavement is torn up once again. Will they ever be done tearing up that section of road? Us folks have places to go.”
“A motorcycle functions entirely in accordance with the laws of reason, and a study of the art of motorcycle maintenance is really a miniature study of the art of rationality itself.”
"A motorcycle. Really, Sherlock?" scoffed Mycroft. "Are you really succumbing to baser, testosterone filled urges of the average teenage male?”
Holmes tried to return the favour, but I brushed away his hands. I escaped with my shirt on and I sat on the edge of his bed. Following my lead, he stood before me, his interest blatantly tenting in his trousers. I nuzzled his clothed hip and worked open his trousers, taking care not to touch his freed erection.
“Want you,” was what I said between heavy breaths into his neck. I was forgivably not at my most eloquent as I struggled to form coherent sentences. All sensations flooded south. I bit the side of his jaw. “I want you writhing, that mind of yours fully focused on me. Or no, I want it turned off, overwhelmed with sensation.”
“What I don’t understand Holmes is why were you in the laboratory at that time doing that experiment. You knew we needed to leave at a specific time.”
The issue would not resolve quickly. Watson would not personally describe the speed at which he left his house as fleeing. He found himself briskly walking down the path to their favourite bench by the sea. “Holmes!” Watson cried out and took his place next to his companion. “Holmes, you will need to discuss the recipes you wish to try with Mrs Glydon.”
John groaned in response. “You have no idea what you do to me. This bike. You.” Any reply Sherlock might have was cut off by John surging forward pressing his lips back onto Sherlock’s. Those lips parted for him and he captured the lower one between his lips and gave it a gentle tug. Their lips open further, and John pressed in deep. They struggle to take control of the kiss in a way that excited them both.
“Do you happen to have any recipes for radishes?”
Watson expected to intervene during the discussion, but it was over faster than he had anticipated. A mutual compromise was struck between housekeeper and radish eater. Offering to increase one’s salary also went a long way to smoothing one’s issues with extra steps.
Watson started walking again and matched steps with Holmes. He was unappeased by the answer. “You could have read a book or returned lost drinking glasses.”

I do not consider myself a murderous mouse, but my patience was sorely tried.
“You want me to re-plan my garden to exclude those two vegetables?”
Sherlock huffed, and proceeded to deduce the man's terrible marriage status from his impersonal family pictures, his lunch from the stain on his horrible blue gingham shirt, and the accident that caused him to leave the force.
Watson was not convinced that this experiment was working. It was one thing to try each sample in the attempt to find one acceptable and another to have one’s mind made up and sampling to confirm one’s bias. He was convinced Holmes was practicing the latter. Thus far, all had failed the raw taste test. Watson had happily eaten the remaining portions of radish as a snack and did not experience any of the soap or dirt tastes or mouth feel that Holmes had described. He had even sampled a few more in case that particular radish was not typical, only to achieve the same results. At least Holmes’ preferences were repeatable.
He struggled whether to call it a dream or a memory. It felt like a memory of something real.
“Holmes tied up the case quickly and I left on the earliest train.” Watson leaned forward and whispered in his ear. “I missed you.”
Foster Kinn
Holmes led Watson inside and gestured to the stack of paper on Watson’s desk. On the first page in Holmes’ distinct handwriting was “the Adventure of the Lion’s Mane.”
“Not all of it. Your hand on my thigh during the cab ride was your idea.”
“He is not joining me tonight,” Watson lied. He was expecting Holmes shortly to explain his new case.
She cut off Watson’s excuse with a chuckle. “It’s fine.” Then she whispered, “I will be sure to save you one.”
He promptly turned and disappeared into the shed.
He felt connected to the universe when he sat on the bike and hummed a tune about the solar system order when he road it. He chose not to examine why such a brainless tune creeped into his head, and just let it drone on as he road.

“I am just browsing,” he said sharply without turning around.
At Watson’s pleading, Holmes turned his gaze to his companion. He took his time looking over Watson’s face before he got up and left. “I will speak to her,” was tossed over Holmes’ shoulder and Watson took a fortifying breath before standing up and following.
“Well, John, I’ve been doing this for about a month now. Why did you decide to start?”
“Mr Holmes! I did not notice your approach. The pleasure is mine.” Mrs Lloyd paused and after considering him briefly. “Are you sure you are well? You are looking a little pale today. Hopefully the beautiful weather we are having today will help clear that up.”
“You know I will most likely not change,” Holmes said. “I will still be as unsociable and untidy as ever.”
The glasses were turquoise blue with a gold inlay of a flower. The tops were rounded and smooth, while the middle was squared off with sharp corners. The bottom edge was equally confusing and was ruffled out away from the natural taper of the glass and sported a star burst cut on the bottom. It was as if the designer decided to use all the techniques they knew in one glass and squeezed in one more with the gold inlay. They were gaudy and heavy and not his style. Both Holmes and Watson preferred a simpler design. Perhaps Holmes preferred them for use outside because they were so garish?
John dutifully changed his clothes and brushed his teeth. The old hinges squeaked as he opened the bathroom door.
Watson ran his hands down his face trying to rub away the prickling guilt about his treatment of Holmes before he left. He filed it away to thank Holmes for breakfast and make it up to him somehow. He crossed his arms and drummed his fingers against his elbow. Next were the mysteries of the Three, no, Two Glasses and Holmes’ behaviour yesterday.
Holmes threw up his hands. “It’s outside the case, and I have outlined the facts in a clear fashion.”
“Ah.” Holmes set his fork, with the stabbed pea, down. “You may have grown it, but I did not eat it.”
“Unlikely, Watson, she will stay. While she is discreet, she will likely explain to her sister why her shawl and hat are dirty. It gives her another morsel for the rumour mill to devour and add to the collection of oddities of a particular resident. As you have shown with your tales, the public is rather interested in the happenings of a now retired detective.”
I conceded and placed the items next to my medical bag and stepped aside to give him room. I could not read his face when he thanked me, took the supplies, and retired to his bedroom.
“And by doing so you will injure yourself more,” I implored. Holmes gave me his most assessing look and I held his gaze steady. I knew my stubbornness was rewarded when he sighed.
A new bond required careful tending with more physical contact until it had matured enough. Lacking that touch would cause the bond to shrivel and the ones bonded to be in pain until it finally broke. If Holmes was unwilling to bond or if he did not feel the same, then I would leave. What happened could be undone, but I needed to find new quarters.
“While that is true, I have no desire to be coddled.”
Greg whistles. “And you still decided to try it. Good for you mate. I started because the girl I’m interested in works here part-time. You know, it was a way to hang with her more and show her I’m interested in whatever she’s interested in. That sort of stuff.”
Watson had stood, arms crossed, and head down. “Yes, you will do well here, if that is your plan.”
Watson decided that focusing on one experiment this season was best. “I’ll add them in the compost. Best not encourage the rabbits.”
“Good. Cause I’m not asking you to join us. It’s a group of independent blokes who get together and go be independent together. Except when one of us hits the deck or rides like a fucking newbie. It’s nice to have another to pick up bloody heavy bikes or tell them they are rubbish at riding motorbikes.”
“Oh, yes. John Watson was it?”
Holmes bit the tip of one finger, whilst a finger from the other hand tapped on the book on his lap. His face took on an introspective look that Watson was very familiar with and knew that he would finally be settling down to think.
2. Red sky at night shepherds delight
The man set his jaw and glared. "So, you're an asshole. God, Lestrade would have loved to interrogate your sorry ass. That still does not tell me your age."
In the distance, a bird cried out. The crisp call of "tea-cher, tea-cher" from a Great Tit reminded Watson of a squeaky wheel barrow. He gently laid his supplies next to the radish bed and inspected the larger bed. While damp and a little bent over from the heavy rain, the seedlings looked as if they would make it. In the radish bed, he moved the earth to form a shallow trench and the bird song blended with the scraping sound of the trowel against the damp soil.
Holmes presents Watson with a brown paper package.
Watson made temporary peace with the windchime - the effort of destroying it was rather great for his current state. After shouting at the bird, it flew away only to return minutes later and continue its song. He took headache powder, because shouting hurt, and rested on the couch. He brought the recipes from Mrs Lloyd in the hopes of looking through them while he rested, but they lay on the floor next to the couch undisturbed.
He sighed and placed his hands on the thin bathing suit covering his stomach. He would need swim more if he had the opportunity for a steady diet of those scones.
He pressed start. The engine turned and growled to life. That growl and accompanying rumble took a hold of his gut and embedded itself in the marrow of his bones. His mind went blissfully blank as the sound invaded all corners of his mind.
"I have not given it much thought." Which was true; Watson had spent most of his time reviewing gardening books or gardening that the small bed slipped his mind.
In the morning, Mummy bullied him into eating toast and some tea. He obliged only after his stomach growled loudly, counteracting any protest he was mounting. She chattered, and his leg bounced with the need to leave and bolted out the door as soon as the toast was finished.
Watson’s expression was a mixture of fondness and exasperation. “Of course. It would be uncharacteristic of you to abandon such a project on the eve of its conclusion.”
Thanks for reading and showing support for this fic.
“We could have the ground prepared by tea time and begin working on the garden fence tomorrow.”

Holmes tightly pressed his lips together before slowly adding, “With all of her connections and willingness to be helpful, Mrs Lloyd would know the appropriate place to donate the remainder.”
“House warming gifts.”
Holmes stabbed the pea and looked up. “Why?”
“It would only take but a minute.”
“Exceedingly so.”
Prompt: Address Victorian fat shaming stereotype and how it might affect a character in your work today.
The deep purr of the engine soothed his mind, and he left any thoughts of timing and internships and tickets behind to clock miles on the road.
“Beets.”
“Or you like radishes, here is a week’s supply. Now that’s settled, how would you summarize our findings dear Watson?
“Excellent.” said Watson pointing to the ground next to him. “Now, help me gather some lettuce to eat for lunch.”
“Curse this inferno,” I did not say. Instead I asked, “Why is the heat blessed?”
or the Lion’s Mane.”
The bike would be delivered to his parent's house in a week after it was fully tuned and the kit installed. While he waited, he poured over every book he deemed usable on the subject of maintenance and riding motorcycles. He was a genius, after all, this was surely a simple enough topic he could reason his way through.
“It’s a continuous coronal discharge that can occur at the top of ship masts.”
“I think we should plant the radishes there, by this end of the bed.”
Watson blinked and took the letter.  He said mechanically, “I was distracted. Forgot to reply. Has it really been weeks since her previous invitation?”
“Holmes, I see the cottage. Almost there,” said Watson between heavy breaths. Holmes gave a weak nod.
There was less talking after that until Watson remembered something he wanted to ask. “Holmes,” Watson tried to say but Holmes prevented it with another kiss. Watson persisted and pulled back a fraction leaving their foreheads together. “Wait, wait. What was the reason for your mood after the perfumed letter arrived? Were you truly not bothered by it?”
New book in hand and moments to spare before he was expected, Watson headed out. He walked in the direction of the red roof of Saint Mary’s. The bells in the clock tower signalled the hour just as he was approaching the path to the church’s entrance.  A group of ladies in brightly coloured dresses and hats were walking down the path, voices chattering away excitedly. In the centre of the group, Watson spotted Mrs Lloyd. Like her fellow companions, her hat was adorned with a cheerful display of flowers which matched her disposition well. She appeared to be a little older than most of her companions, and Watson regrettably remembered that she was slightly younger than his sixty plus year-old self.
Through the entire class, John keeps sneaking glances back to the man to see what he’s doing. He sees the dark-haired man stretching his back and legs. He wonders who the man is. He wonders what he is doing here. He wonders if Greg knows. He wonders if the man is single. He quickly stops his train of thought and returns his attention to his instructor.
Holmes rolled over to his side capturing Watson’s hand under his arm. He looked over at Watson. “Some time ago.”
“I can attend to my own care,” said Holmes. He tried to remove his jacket and winced.
Having a dedicated room for Holmes’ chemistry sets had been one of the conditions for a retirement home. The rest of the list Watson had learned about after he was introduced to the house.
I had closed the gap to the bed and bent over him. “—I believe you did the pouncing, that is, you tackled me to the floor and took me there on the bear skin rug.”
“About the small garden.”
The sales associate tried to get Sherlock to purchase other necessities, and he shrugged him off by spouting out more deductions about his not so vanilla love life. The salesman's expression had become serious. "Young man, we need to talk about safety. I was a motorbike cop for 15 years before retiring. You need protective wear to keep safe."
“Yes, of course, the Strand. Well, it needs some warmth. The reader learns nothing new about you.”
“No,” he moaned. “It’s these murders. They must be connected, but it’s dark to me.”
Watson gave a fond sigh. “Are you prepared to begin the eating portion of the radish experiment?”
Holmes laughed and set his hat on his head. “Come out when you can,” he said and then left.
Basil glanced at the timepiece. “They will strike in three hours. Come Dawson! I know exactly where they will be: the hottest location of the city.”
“the development of a plant from a seed or spore after a period of dormancy."
“The plan stays Holmes. I am rather fond of radishes, even if you are not.”
There is a bit of a time jump between chapter 5 and 6. The stories are written to slip neatly into canon. This chapter happens after Season 4.
Fragile leaves poked out of the ground. They must have newly emerged given their green and yellow colour. A gardener friend had mentioned they were called cotyledons. Some of the seedling’s cotyledons were still pressed together and caught in the act of unfurling. Watson inspected the bed closely and saw even more seedlings trying to break through the soil surface. The whitish stem, or hypocotyl as the friend had corrected, was just visible for the other seedlings. He would need to sow the next planting in the next few days.
Holmes flipped through the pages to the plot he designed for the garden this year. Picking up a pencil, he sketched a small square and added multiple parallel lines within. He numbered each line and drew a number on a seed packed. Watson sat in silence as he worked.
He had never really been in a motorcycle shop before. Why else would he need to be here as he did not own a bike nor anyone in his family, minus Uncle Rudy, owned own. Sports bikes of every obnoxious look-at-me colour were lined up in perfect rows. He could not see the appeal of sport bikes. How did one sit hunched over for hours? How could that be comfortable?
I retrieved the offending text. “Cesare Lombroso’s
Holmes grabbed his cigarette before twisting round. “I will be in soon.”
Passing down stories we love.
“Who was it?”
“You were calling out.”
Her face went white and she yelled “Mr Holmes! Dr Watson!” She ran to the cottage not realizing that her hat and scarf had fluttered to the ground.
“You did…”
Watson, who was at the limit of his alcohol consumption for the evening and so nursing his last drink, downed the drink in one gulp and went for another.
“I am here to provide support either emotionally or otherwise as you harvest the radishes.”
It was good. Well, it was more than good.
We tumbled through his door and somehow toed off our shoes while engaging in heated kisses. Holmes began working on his collar. I pulled his hands back and I murmured, “You will swear to me here and now that you will undress no further. I have been forced to watch you all evening in that outfit and I do intend to have my way with it.” Holmes stilled and let me divest him of his attire.
Their trip to town where they meet someone and Watson tells Holmes of his revisions.
“Yes, Dad.” Rosie appeared from the bathroom dressed in her favorite purple pajamas. They settled into her bed and began reading a story together.

Without discussion, Holmes had decided they should work on opposite ends and meet in the middle. It was more efficient, he claimed, to divide their efforts. Watson decided it was easier to accept that plan than argue. Returning to the present task, Watson picked up his fork and began working again.
Tea had worked its wonders and by the late afternoon Watson’s headache was more manageable. He rested on the couch after tea and took another dose of headache powder. Beginning to feel the need to move, he glanced out of the window and noted the puffy clouds rolling in. Their brilliant white told him that they would not rain on him if he went outside but would provide intermittent shade.
John raked his eyes up Sherlock’s body before sucking in a deep breath. When was Sherlock near a bike this much of a turn on for him? He’d seen him near other bikes but nothing like this sex-on-two-wheels.
Holmes was intensely focused on the open book in his hands, his fingers tracking over the words in the page. He was still dressed in his nightshirt and one of his lighter dressing gowns was wrapped around him. Watson was thankful that their housekeeper was unable to come today and she was spared further scandal. Although this time, the bohemian habit was out of necessity to reduce the irritation on the injuries that trousers would cause.
Holmes nodded and grinned. I returned to my book as Holmes muttered about the man being a baboon.
The hansom lurched as it hit a rough patch and my mental drifting was abruptly stopped. Out of the corner of my eye, I looked at the orchestrator of my agonizing state and wondered if he was similarly affected. He was the one who designed this game of anticipation, of more, of desire, of lust. I, as in our professional life, was his partner and co-conspirator and willing to follow wherever he led. The thought of Holmes planning this exquisite torture of our wills only fuelled my impatience and I felt the pooling heat in my gut. I squeezed his thigh, and he turned his head towards me. He gave me a look, and I blushed.  He knew exactly what state I was in. We continued the rest of our snail’s paced journey through the cold in silence.
“You can’t buy happiness… But you can buy a motorcycle and that’s basically the same thing.”
Holmes returned triumphantly and handed Watson a pair of gardening gloves. “Perhaps, but we have risen early and it may not rain today.”
Holmes shook his head and waved his hand that was still holding the bread. He swallowed that mouthful of bread and turned to go with the glass in hand. He called back over his shoulder. “Tomorrow. I need to return to my reactions.”
“A fact I am well aware of, but I have no desire to rush into personally engaging in this experiment.”
Pairing: Lestrade/Watson
Tea was exactly the thing needed for this sort of brain work and he had only drunk the lukewarm tea from breakfast.
Holmes arched his eye brow. “No need to take notes on the case, my boy, as I have already done that,” said Holmes waving in the direction of the manuscript on Watson’s desk.
“Sherlock Holmes, you did this on purpose.”
Watson returned his glass because he did not want to see another one lost - Holmes was quite capable of scattering them throughout the property. Watson was proud of his garden plan. He had followed the latest in gardening advice and would grow the radishes with spinach, which were said to be good companions. Why should he move them to the end of the bed where it would go against recommendations to have radishes grow with potatoes? The article considered this rather shameful, which was likely taking the matter too far. He pondered why Holmes had taken a sudden interest in reorganizing his plans. There was no protest any other year. Why was this year different?

The chemical experiments provided the distraction he desperately needed. Not the ones he performed in a test tube, but the injectable kind. They were easy to find on his travels memorizing London’s streets. His new chemical high made life much less boring. Some inspired the clearest thoughts while others calmed his mind and let him think clearly. Why hadn’t he found this fix earlier?
John drifted off to sleep.
Pausing by the door, Holmes asked, “will you be joining me outside?”
Holmes twisted slightly in his arms. “I have given your suggestions for the manuscript, the lion’s mane one, some thought.”
Sherlock caught movement out of the corner of his eye and saw Mummy open the door with a look of pure shock. He twisted the handle and the engine roared, blocking any sound of admonishment from her. He could still read her angry lips and knew she was using his full name and something like “What do you think you’re doing?” Sherlock revved the engine again. She would have words with him, and he tried to drum up any level of care.
“The other organizers have requested my award-winning strawberry scones. They were Mr Lloyd’s favourite, God rest his soul.” She paused. “I’m impatiently waiting for the strawberries to ripen up. I do have leftover strawberry jam, but it isn’t the same.” She leaned in and said in a conspiratorial tone, “The other organizers do this to me every year.”
“Now that you’ve indulged your thrill seeking and,” Mycroft’s pointedly looked at the jacket, ”leather, it’s time to return.”
His breathing was ragged, and I knew he was moving ever closer to the edge. I reached between us and gave his prick a few pulls before he arched his back, his head thrown back, and came apart with a muffled shout. His internal muscles spasmed and pulled me closer to the edge. A few more thrusts and I called his name into his shoulder as I found my release.

“No, I was going to spend today indoors,” said Watson, turning his attention back to the notes scattered on his desk. “I was trying to organize my notes for the case of that peculiarly acting professor.”
“Try not to sit up yet.” Watson whispered, trying to keep his voice calm and was very nearly successful. He released Holmes’ hand and picked up his stethoscope. He blew on and rubbed the cool instrument to impart some warmth into it before pressing the instrument to Holmes’ chest. He noticed that his hands were trembling slightly despite his efforts to maintain control.
After double and triple checking that the gate was closed and shut properly, he walked through the damp grass to the shed. The light walk and fresh air were starting to clear his head and his stomach protested very little. He was marginally better able to appreciate his surroundings as he entered the shed. Empty wooden frames were stacked in a corner and jars were stacked on a work bench. He looked at his companion’s clutter, which had an organizational system of their own, with fondness until he saw three drinking glasses sitting in front of the jars near the edge of the work bench, as well as some gloves he had misplaced. He pressed his lips together and roughly gathered up the glasses and the gloves. His headache slammed back in full force and he marched back to the cottage.
”I will be in town,” Holmes said, picking up his jacket. His voice was cold and aloof. He did not look up at Watson. “As you have made it perfectly clear, you are a doctor and you can take care of yourself. Good day Doctor Watson.”
He felt around for Holmes and found that he was alone in the bed. Which was likely for the best, because he was in a murderous mood.
Prompt: Include a favorite book or work of literature.
“I –“
Watson returned the look with an overly dramatic sigh. “Could you put the radishes in the basket?”
“Good.” The rider padded down his leather jacket and pulled out a stubby pencil and crinkled small notebook. He scribbled something down before handling it to Sherlock.
Be warned there is a minor motorcycle accident. No one gets seriously hurt, but I'm giving in warning if it's a trigger for someone.
The rider left with a roar from the bike and did not turn back. Sherlock tossed the paper on the ground and walked back to his bike. He rolled his eyes and groaned before turning around and pocketing the note. It wasn’t as if he needed or even wanted to ride with them. And he was not going to go or consider going. He just wanted to not litter.
“Ah, that was the other thing that startled you. You haven’t been that jumpy in a while.”
“Sherlock, what’s your favorite meteorological phenomenon?”
And so I did. His arm return to his mouth and muffled groans and sounds of ecstasy were directed towards my efforts.
The sugar bowl was where he expected but the pile of mail was not. That scattered over the floor when he retrieved his keys. He did consider grabbing a biscuit before he left, and his stomach grumbled at the thought of food. He ignored it and the mess on the floor.  Being caught now would be worse than being caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
Sherlock nodded and knew he would take that off first thing.
John nodded.

“It was, umm, a red sky at night-“
-----
Sherlock considered what the older rider had offered. The idea was not at all tempting, thus he deleted it. The point was not to go from one person’s stifling ideas of what he should do to another.
“Does it matter?”
4. An unexpected visitor
“You planted successive crops to cover this angle.”
“Remove my glove.”
“We are in no rush; my seeds have not arrived.” Watson raised his glass and took another sip.
He sat on his couch and injected. As the drug took hold of his system, his mind was blissfully blank, and he was floating somewhere. Where was he again? It didn’t matter.
Mycroft tisked. "What would Mummy think about you smoking out here? Leaving ends in her potted plants of all places." Mycroft took a last drag of his own cigarette and tossed the end in the pile that Sherlock started in the potted plant.
"In a car you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it you don't realize that through that car window everything you see is just more TV. You're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame.
I needed to finish my stitching quickly. I suddenly realized that I had not examined his hand. I was sure there was glass embedded in his palm. I inwardly groaned; pressing palms together was typically how bonds were started, not this... situation. Maybe I could work using tweezers and have him hold his hand.
Watson got up and looked down longingly at his egg before walking to the coat rack. He found the widest brimmed hat he owned and jammed it on his head. He slipped his bare feet in his shoes, not bothering to lace his boots properly, and went out quickly before he changed his mind. Standing steps away from the door, he almost did so as he squinted to allow his eyes to adjust to the onslaught of bright light. He swayed as a wave of nausea hit him. Of all days to be a gorgeous and sunny day, it had to be this one. Why couldn’t today be a rainy day? Or dark, dark would be even better.
Sherlock silently groaned. Why did ships, cars, boats, anything with a motor have to be a she? He did not want to sit or straddle any she’s, thank you very much.
“You were right about the rain, my boy.”
Sherlock said nothing, but he didn't need to.
“I was going to say ‘absolutely in need of a sod,’ but that may not be entirely correct choice of words.”
"Holmes, what is this?"
“About twenty-five days for fully mature radishes, but they can be harvested earlier,” said Watson. He took his eyes off the white caps of the of the water which was churning between different shades of brown. “We will, of course, need to tenderly care, weed, and water them as they grow and mature into their full potential.”
“I’ve just made tea, if you care for some,” Watson said as Holmes dropped a small brown package in front of him. He turned and removed his drenched cloth hat and coat, not before leaving a trail of water droplets on the floor.
John shuts his eyes tights. He breaths in and slowly breathes out, using the technique his therapist had suggested. The ache in his shoulder is minimal and his limp was not as noticeable today. He stretches his arms and shakes out his legs, and breathes out quickly before exiting the room.
Sherlock covered John’s hand with his. “It’s fine.”
“Oh... no, say no more,” groaned Watson. He shut his eyes and pressed his forehead into Holmes bony shoulder. His voice was muffled. “it is too early to remember that case or any other unfortunate ones I could have retold.”
“I haven’t seen it since… maybe last fall,” said Watson as he placed the bread on the table. He walked back to the cupboards and found the large bowl. “I’ll gather some greens for lunch. I planted extra radishes, maybe you would like to try a radish in your salad?”
The one eye that Watson could see was shut tight and Holmes’ said, in a voice muffled by a pillow, “Tradition dictates that one goes back to sleep after engaging in rigorous activities with one’s partner.”
Holmes sighed and slipped the radish back into the package and handed it back to Watson. Watson did not accept the package. “And you accuse me of being dramatic. I said that I did not want to eat a radish until the experiment ended.”
Sherlock understood and was soon standing in front of John. They both fumbled with Sherlock’s trousers and pants John surged forward and pressed Sherlock’s legs back against the bike. He sent a quick mental thanks to whoever thought to store the bike with this type of stand or they would have fallen over.
“Will that be all?”
Basil has been waiting for the oppressive summer heat. Dawson has not. (Great Mouse Detective)
She sighed. "You still haven't had dinner."
Completed with his sketch and numbering, Holmes remarked, "Do you remember the other bed I mentioned?"
Watching this was almost too much for Watson and he inched forward, preparing to rush to Holmes’ side ignoring his command. Holmes stumbled towards him and Watson caught him. He gently tugged on Holmes to follow and guided him to sit near the sea kale.
Holmes sat across from Watson, leaned forward with his arms resting on the table. Watson re-straightened the already straightened stack of papers on which Holmes had written his manuscript and Watson had provided edits just that afternoon. Watson swallowed before beginning, already feeling tense. “Well, it sounds like you with the short prose and precise terms, which is good. It shouldn’t sound like me, since you wrote it, but…”
How could he have travel through a wardrobe? It was not a plausible experience he could believe.
Lestrade shuddered. “And I you.”
Watson watched the rich, dark earth fall in clumps from his fork. He stabbed the ground and leaned back to stretch and tried to relieve the ache in his shoulder. They were making slow progress and Watson would make even slower progress if he pushed his body too hard.
Ignoring this, Watson continued his musings. “Last year was minimally successful, but the year before that was an abysmal failure. What about the years prior? It must have been a while ago. When was the last time you tried a radish?”
Holmes gave an approving nod. Watson was glad he knew how to speak Holmes and help as needed to smooth the way. He disappeared to find an appropriate piece of cloth. Blindfolding could make this a bit more interesting.
Sherlock’s thoughts were disrupted, and he was pulled to the present by a voice. Mummy was asking him a question. No, Mummy was informing him. When had she come in?
“Mrs Lloyd, how good it is to see you again,” Holmes said in a polite, but neutral tone.
He bought the bike.
John grinned - it was his favorite.
“French breakfast.”
With each rebuttal, Watson felt the tension in his gut tighten and a worming thought kept eating away at his ability to concentrate. This was not how he hoped their discussion would go. He knew from past experiences that pressing Holmes would accomplish nothing - Holmes did whatever he did on his own terms. Watson would give the space and the time he needed, and would discuss this with him later.
John scrolled through the search results on his phone while drinking his morning tea.  This one will have to do, he thought.
“Do you have some other means of keeping out the rabbits?”
“This one, sample A --“
“Why not? It’s fun.”
“I would be impressed if you did - you were quite inebriated at the time. This was after a card game that not even I could deduce the rules. Loudly telling stories of our less famous and more embarrassing cases. Of the green stockings and-“
Watson pressed his lips together. He tried to keep the disappointment out of his voice as he said, “Are you sure?”
My lover was not someone to let a statement like that slide. He began his attack. “Do you recall the last time I gave you that particular signal?” His voice was lower, and a sensation went straight to my groin. Of course, I knew, he knew that I knew, and that I could recount what we did with in detail.
The next morning, Watson sat on a wobbly wicker chair outside the cottage. He exhaled a puff of smoke that curled in the light breeze before he sucked on his pipe again. He thought about the case he was writing. The plot was not flowing as clearly as he would have liked. There was not the twist of some of the other cases; the trite romantic interest he had seen time and time again. Soaking in the warm morning sun and watching the sea birds soaring on the swells was providing little inspiration. Perhaps a walk would prove more inspirational.
working on a manuscript, just as he has suspected. “I’d be glad to read one of your manuscripts on your honey research. I may not understand it, but I would like to read what you have been doing.”
Watson heard the shushing of fabric, which he assumed was Holmes adjusting his waistcoat, and opened his eyes. Holmes was straightening his clothing and pressing his lips firmly together. Holmes’ eyes were fixed on Watson’s gaze before dropping and scanning the room.
Watson, pen in hand, stretched and considered making tea. He had slept poorly the night after the jellyfish attack, needing the reassurance that the man sleeping next to him was still there, warm and breathing. Holmes had tolerated the extra attention until this morning when he entered one of the focused states which was usually left to unravelling a crime. To keep an eye on Holmes and not hover, which would have annoyed Holmes further, Watson chose to stay indoors and organize his case notes. Outside was warm, dry and beautiful, but being away from Holmes was not desirable.
For most of the morning, Watson found himself alone in their shared cottage and he busied himself with manuscript drafts and his garden diary. Holmes had walks into town in the morning for an errand he would explain nothing about. From the ache in Watson’s shoulder, he knew a storm was coming and informed Holmes, but Holmes left anyway. The rain poured down and Watson knew that Holmes would be drenches on his return trip.
Against my better judgement, for I sought to calm myself, not enflame my condition, I remembered what brought me to this state — a simple touch. Holmes and I had begun to explore the more carnal nature of our relationship after he returned to me. Months later, he made a habit of touching my hand with his and run his pointer finger against the sensitive flesh between my index finger and thumb before engaging in more active appreciation of my body. This simple light touch signalled the promise of something more and each time the promise was kept. I knew what Holmes wanted from his expression, and his signal confirmed it. Yet, this seemingly innocent touch was never performed outside the safe haven of our rooms in Baker Street.
Upon seeing Watson, Mrs Lloyd’s whole expression brightened and she enthusiastically waved to him. Watson politely smiled and waved back. She excused herself from her group.
Watson blinked.  “I am quite certain my suggestions did not include Stackhurst.”
The flavours were like an explosion across Watson’s tongue and he groaned silently in approval. It had been an understatement when Holmes had told him these oysters were good. He picked up another and thoughtfully chewed it as he scanned the other respectable patrons in the candle lit restaurant.
After sterilizing my supplies, I began stitching up the wound. The tingling started as soon as I touched his skin. The sensation crawled up my arm and settled in my gut as a pool of warmth. This soul bond initiation was not the product of my imagination.
“Now you are willing to admit your age is effecting your memory. Where are you going?”
I saved the location between his thumb and forefinger for last. Turning his palm upwards, I opened my mouth over the spot. On the corresponding spot on my body where he started this exquisite torture, I ran my tongue across it.
“What? Of course, I’m sure. I just spent... Oh.” Holmes coughed “I would prefer to feed myself to maintain my focus on the task at hand.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Watson groaned again and tried to change the subject - there were some memories best kept in the past. “I never did thank you for breakfast yesterday. That was nice of you.”
Content Warnings: Injury (I’m not killing off characters. Nope, not me.)
Further down the shore from where Stackhurst was swimming, Holmes and Watson were sitting on a bench that was sheltered from the breeze by a bush. If you did not know the spot was there, it would have been easy to overlook.
Holmes raised his hand. “Please, my dear Watson, I did not mean to offend. I know you to be most loyal and I would never ask you to leave me. No, I have a plan and one that might forever throw her off your scent. When you are done, I will explain it to you over tea.” Holmes turned and walked a short distance before saying, “You might want to consider reinforcing the patch.”
For kicks and giggles, I made a cover and posted it in Chapter 1.
“I became accustomed to using them, as they are easy to distinguish from the others and you didn’t seem to mind them leaving the cottage. That’s it, my dear Watson, they are a habit.” He paused briefly. “Just as you retrieving them is your habit.”
What was Friesland? Watson frowned and downed the rest of the Chardonnay - he wished his drink was brandy.
“I’m done,” I said in a surprisingly even voice. I found tweezers in my bag and was ready to tend to his hand.
Sherlock recognized the familiar shape leaning on an umbrella in front of an equally familiar silver gleam of his father’s classic car. His brother adored their father’s car and occasionally indulged in driving it.
Lestrade tried not to blush. “As dad would say, Vouloir, c’est pouvoir.”
And so, it did.
“That is true, and I will stubbornly not change my preference.”
Watson gaped and bristled. “Of course not! if you think -“
The pub they selected was busy, but the food was decent and they could find a relatively quiet corner to sit. Holmes ate his cottage pie and peas in silence. Watson decided it was best not to bring up the brief encounter with Mrs Lloyd, and he ate his lamb stew and watched the other guests.
He shrugged. “There are not many that I desire to remain in their company. Now, remove my glove.”
Determined, Rosie sounded out the next line.
Holmes bent down to pick up the glove on the doorstep. “Ah, Watson, there you are. I was hoping to discuss what you need in town...”
Holmes softly groaned and begrudgingly opened the one eye visible to Watson. “If I answer, will you let me sleep?”
Sherlock stared at him. The man stared back and let the silence sit between them like a heavy weight.
“Should I be jealous of your habitual use of our drinking ware?”
“Why did I leave my warm bed to be here at this
“You’re not planning on showing any mercy, hmm?” he said. I stared down at his body, and he looked back at me unashamed. I let my eyes roam over his body. The light from the fireplace cast a warm glow over him, and a faint shadow fell on his belly from his cockstand. He was still as pale as ever but marked with more scars from his time away.
Watson sat with his mouth agape as Holmes left the cottage and shut the door roughly behind him. He looked up at the ceiling and breathed in deeply. This was not going as he had hoped. Maybe showing Holmes an example of what he was trying to explain might help. He opened the manuscript and quickly scanned through the text.
Both men watched Mrs Lloyd walk down the street a little way before finding another town folk to remind about the plant sale.
Watson picked up the wrapped box and noted that it was damp despite the carrier’s best intention of keeping it dry. “What is the meaning of this, Holmes?”
Rosie yawned and was struggling with reading.
Movement down the road caught his eye and he saw that it was the postman. He walked around the cottage to meet him. The postman dismounted from his bike and picked out a small stack of letters from his mailbag. He handed the letters to Watson, tipped his hat and left.
Note that a smutty chapter is ahead. Scroll to the --- if you want to skip it and read how the story ends.
“Some time ago.” Holmes smirked. “Old age does make recalling the exact time difficult.”
Watson yawned again. “I’m heading to bed. Try to get some sleep tonight; we have a busy day in town tomorrow.”
Watson nodded. “And you might be?”
“And your memory is not wrong,” said Holmes as he finished making Watson’s tea. “Since you have taken the liberty of heavily editing or blending together multiple cases, I have done the same. My encounter with the jellyfish was most inspiring and I have sensationalized it, as you have been so fond in doing, by changing the mundane killer to a jellyfish.”
The sound of the man’s hand against the table exploded in the calm of the restaurant. The other patrons cast disapproving glances their way and outburst caught the attention of the maître d’.

“No, it was not. Since you seem to be stuck, perhaps you could better spend your time reading my manuscript.”
When the door opened again, Watson immediately started explaining. “Holmes, look at this section here, it…” He stopped when Holmes deposited a letter in front of him. Watson set down the manuscript and picked up the letter. The letter was thick and smelled heavily of roses. Holmes reached over, picked up the manuscript, and silently departed upstairs. Watson watched him leave and then looked at the letter. He deciphered from the exaggerated looping writing a name: Mrs Lloyd.
Kneeling, Watson ignored the protest from his leg and immediately examined Holmes. His experienced fingers moving proficiently through the routine motions learned from decades of practice. Holmes’ foot was beginning to swell and his breathing was growing shallow and the sound was a slightly higher pitch. “Stubborn old man, you should have let me come to you.”
He looked me in the eye. “For God’s sake, John, move.”
6. Flisk
“These cases involving soul bonds are a waste of my time,” Holmes had grumbled after our worried client left. He had been right. The client insisted she was abducted and wouldn’t leave him. He was wrong and she had left to pursue another whose bond with her was stronger and had gone into hiding until her current bond withered away. Leaving for a stronger bond was a common enough occurrence; despite Holmes explaining this to our distressed client, he insisted on Holmes’ help.
“They were useful and sturdy. They even survived a couple of accidents.”
While the water boiled. He placed the two glasses on the table. He sat on the chair placed opposite of the focus of his inquiries, crossed his legs and arms, and stared down the two glasses. The glasses said nothing.
The sun slowly burned away at the morning mist that covered the Sussex coastal region. The filtered light tried to peek through the windows of a white washed cottage to let the occupants know of its arrival, but there was no one there to welcome it.
“Will you be bringing anything?”
We dined, and Holmes discussed at length the accomplishments of the violinist we would see later. I drank in the sight of him and the very good wine accompanying our dinner.
Filtered light entered through the windows and Watson could make out the Channel and cliff edge ever better as the morning continued to march on.  Violent winds and rain had swept through that night waking him and Holmes throughout the night. They had both woke earlier, electing to stay in bed to try catch a few more moments of sleep but plans changed to more personal activities. Afterwards, Holmes lay on his front, arms wrapped around his pillow, and nightshirt forgotten on floor.
Just as well, for he had the most wonderful tea time with her after the doctor’s departure. He had sung the praises of her strawberry scones and she beamed. Her bright, inquisitive eyes never left his. Their conversation flowed easily, and they discovered that they had a lot in common. Mrs Lloyd, Dolores she had asked him to call her, said he looked like a man who knew how to take care of himself. He could get lost in those eyes.
“Is inaccurate, spins tales filled with romantic rubbish-“
"I will prepare the bed for you and beyond that you are free to carry out my plans. You have decided to grow to radishes and grow those radishes you shall."
A bang from the door and Holmes walking to his shed silenced the birds momentarily. Holmes called out, “I’ll be but a moment and we can walk to the shore.”
“I have watering cans and will power. Also, the weather has been cool. This radish will taste different from what it might taste like tomorrow, next week, or even when it is ready to harvest.”
Before Holmes could reply she continued, “I was just reminding to Dr Watson about our little plant and bake good sale. Dr Watson, would you agree that in the interest of our veterans that Mr Holmes should donate a few jars of his honey?”
“Bless this warm day!” Exclaimed Basil buzzing with more than his usual excitement.
“But…”
The morning light burned away the mist that settled over the cottage that Holmes and Watson called home. The faint tinkling of the windchimes outside blended well with the peaceful koo-koo song of the dove who nested under one of the bedroom windows. Even the bees, the industrious creatures that they are, seemed lulled into the serene mood and were lazily sipping nectar from the flowers around the cottage. The sun light filtered through the curtains to give the room a soft glow.
"And you need to take a riding course.” Sherlock would not take a course, but he nodded his agreement just to shut up the man. He planned on ignoring the tiresome law of needing to obtain motorcycle license.
“I’m sorry. If I was out of place...”
Something was off in the arrangement and Holmes carefully adjusted their placement. Watson watched as Holmes chose another black globe from a bowl of cleaned but unorganized radishes and added it to the arrangement. The next one he chose was a cylindrical radish with white decorating the tip and the rest a bright pinky red.
“But Dad, can’t I have just one more book?”
“For… For anything that happened yesterday.”
“May I join you Doctor Watson?” said male voice with a slight Dutch accent.
The time piece on the mantel ticked its way through the seconds and minutes as it had the day before. Watson ceased to recognize the sound and startled when it chimed the hour.
Yes, he was wearing his leathers. Yes, he was wearing his helmet. Yes, it bloody hurt
“I’ve left a list on the table for our housekeeper. Do you have anything else to add?”
Sherlock did not respond. His snappy response evaporated when he saw a van pulling up the gravel driveway. The chrome on his -
Watson revised the plans whilst Holmes was performing experiments on honey.
He ignored his brother knowing it would irk him and mounted the bike and put the key in the ignition. The calm he felt completely evaporated. Tension began to creep up his spine. His fingers turned white as he gripped the handlebars. It would only take a simple twist of the wrist and he could fly away with a roar. Do it. It would be easy.
Pleasantries and post exchanged, Holmes walked up to him holding multiple letters. He held out a letter to Watson. Before Watson could see the address, he smelled the perfume.
Mycroft swung his umbrella back and forth as he walked over. His face showing only disapproval which he perfected from many years of practice. Sherlock fought the natural desire to scowl at his brother and maintained a blank expression, but he knew this was in vain as his brother would see his micro expressions.
She turned to stir something in a pale blue pot. "And we can talk about what you need for your internship. It's awfully exciting and kind of Mycroft to make connections...."
Sherlock froze at the sound and slowly sat up. Casting a look over his shoulder, he scanned over John’s body. John knew he was cataloguing, and he feels exposed in front of that gaze. Emboldened, he made it obvious of the condition he was in. Sherlock gave him a knowing smirk. He slowly turned back around and methodically rubbed the cloth over the chrome of the handlebars.
“As my trusted biographer, I trust that you will take the notes that as I dictate?” Holmes lifted the garden journal from his lap and extended it in the general location of where Watson sat.
“No need, I found what I was looking for.” Holmes tore off a chunk of bread and took a large bite. Still chewing, he found a glass and poured water into it.
They did not.
“Holmes… please? Please talk to her and decide on a compromise.”
“The pain was quite excruciating?”
"John just noticed Sherlock leaning on the door frame. He has the next part memorized and he held Sherlock’s gaze as he finished
Watson brushed by him without acknowledging the glove Holmes was offering him, and carefully set the glasses in the sink.
“You’ve buggered that up. But hey, at least you aren’t fucking dead. That would have ruined my whole day.
“Holmes, would the new bed, by chance, have a fence around it?”
“I am jealous. I could not tolerate another taking my place.”
The table was set with toast, boiled eggs, and a tea pot. He staggered over to it and sat down not giving much of a thought to who made his breakfast. He began cracking an egg when a sudden thought popped into his head - had he remembered to close and lock the gate to the gardens? He had visited the day before, but was the gate left open or properly closed? Then there was that rabbit from the other day. If the gate was left open he was sure his garden would be no more.
Stilling his hands, Watson caught Holmes’ gaze. “That has not stopped me before.” He returned his attention to the injuries and frowned. “We need to get you back home. Your foot is rather inflamed and will need attention.” He did not mention the more worrying breathing symptoms. He helped Holmes to his feet and began the journey home.
“You have been exhibiting classic paroxysm of fever like those with malaria. Strange because you live in London, yet there has been seven deaths this year. You could fill in the lacuna of my memory, but probably not. Instead, I’ll tell you of my latest case in a Flisk parish.”
“Dr Watson, how good it is to see you. Will you be attending the plant sale?”
Holmes smirked. “That was not what you said last evening.”
I chose to ignore it and continue my ministrations.
John’s in hospital.
“Watson, the other one was fine.”
“Still working on the professor case?” said Holmes from the doorway, interrupting Watson’s musings. Watson had not heard the door open.
Watson looked back and the crow took off and few over a farmer’s wheat field. “I expect her resignation when we return.”
The garden fence was new this year. Watson was tired of having his vegetables, especially the radishes and lettuces, be eaten away by the native rabbit population before he even saw the fruits of his labours.
Sherlock struggled to roll away from the noise.
Fingers slightly numb with cold and uncoordinated with lust fumbled with his cravat and collar. Again, I silently thanked his tailor as I removed the jacket and placed it on the chair. My jacket and waistcoat followed and so did his waistcoat. His shirt and vest were removed before I kissed the exposed shoulder and claimed it with a quick nip.
“I do agree with you. Lombroso has a lecture tomorrow - you could attend.”
Holmes laughed which startled a crow. The crow perched on the top of a stone fence and cawed reprimands at them until they passed. At least someone else was giving them an earful.
“There’s more?” whines Sherlock.
The moonlight illuminated the monotone landscape in shades of grey and even darker grey. The night seemed to amplify the crash of the Channel waters on the shore. He could barely make out the twit-twoo of an owl. Perhaps it was distant, but his hearing and the night was playing havoc with his ability to say anything with certainty.
Lestrade rubbed his temples. Three men murdered. There must be a connection. Right? Think.
“Now. It must be now.”

“If you feel that it is needed, then yes.” Holmes continued. “I have taken the liberty of removing the romantic nonsense and have stuck to more rational thoughts and reasoning. In the case, I made active use of my brain attic to recall an obscure piece of information that was critical to solving the identity of the murderer. I’ve focused on facts and the steps I used in stringing them together in a chain of logic and reasoning. My deductive methods which are used to narrow down the potential candidates are emphasized and explained. It’s all in the manuscript, and I do not wish to, say, spoil the ending by telling you it now.”
Pain replaced fear, and he could stand it no longer. He fought to pull them out. Watson felt them tumble into the physical world.
“Always interested in helping out a good cause.” Watson reminded Holmes.
Watson spread out the seed packets in front of him. Unlike his earlier glance, he took time to read the varieties. To his delight, one of the packets was Brightest Scarlet. It was a new offering this year, and one he considered trying, but he went with an older, more proven variety.  Watson smiled - trying new varieties he was curious about was a wonderful perk of the Least Awful Radish Experiment. Picking up another packet, he immediately recognized it as a variety he already planted the year before and this year in the larger garden. Perhaps that variety could be replaced by something else. He flipped the page in his garden diary and started listing the names on a blank page.
“Try shipping records? Holmes worked on a case where the murderer was a sailor; the murders were timed with his ship.”
Sherlock could not decide if his injuries or what he did to his bike made him feel worse. He silently apologized to it and him not seeing the sand on the pavement.
He trailed his hands down the curves of the handles, hovering just above not wanting to blemish the surface with his fingerprints. All focus was on his hand tracing down the curves of the gas tank to stop over the seat. The exhaust pipes curled along the side accentuating the curves and giving the bike a seductive look. He crouched down to get a closer look. Nestled in the V of the engine was a Jolly Roger.
“It truly is an odd thing we bikers do, riding through miserable conditions like this. We don’t invite then or look for them, surely, but when they are upon us we relish the challenge and silently claim the superiority of adventure over comfort, wilderness over warmth, discovery over certainty.”
Holmes gave a cry of excitement and spun towards Watson. “Watson, perfect timing. I have discovered the identity of the criminal.”

“That is quite good of them.”
The radish bed had been finished the previous day by turning the earth over, adding compost, and smoothing the surface. The fence, dutifully guarding nothing, was in place. After a day of working the radish bed and the sudden rain storm, Watson had elected to plant the seeds the next day. He wondered how his seedlings in the other bed had fared the storm. The hopeful beginnings of his garden were already showing. The onions were no longer thin green strings and the peas shoots would need something to climb on soon. Lettuce and other greens were ready to start harvesting. The radishes from his larger bed had already sprouted and were sporting a few new leaves. Those he would not force on Holmes, but would enjoy them alone.
“Did you know?”
“What…” John’s voice cracked, and he abandoned that question. “Is this yours?”
Holmes smiled briefly and gave Watson’s hand a squeeze before laying back and closing his eyes letting Watson work. Watson finished his examination and was relieved that Holmes was looking better. He swapped the stethoscope for a glass of brandy by his seat. “Here, drink this. I can give you something for the pain.”
Progress inspecting the hose stopped when the shrill ring from the postman’s bell sounded. Watson saw the uniformed man riding his bicycle towards the cottage. He started to leave his hose inspection duties to retrieve the post, but just then Holmes exited the cottage and greeted the man.
The roar of the engine coming to life broke the stillness of the night. There was no chance his parents didn’t hear that. It was time to go. His internal mantra of go, go, go now matching the thumping of his pulse he hears in his ears. He peeled out of the driveway throwing gravel behind him. Taking no notice of any sound ordinances, he twisted the throttle and gripped on tight as he accelerated. The forces wanted to rip him away from his freedom and back to that suffocating cottage.
Holmes showed no recognition of Watson’s presence remaining still with his hand touching the lamppost.
Holmes turned and walked over to the kitchen to rummage for dinner.
Next was to try recipes that incorporated radishes. Holmes had added special instructions to the recipes before giving them to their housekeeper. He left the house intending to spend his time by the beach. Watson had paid little attention to the exchange and the recipes, choosing to focus on editing his manuscript. Pots clanging in the kitchen were not an uncommon noise, but it was growing in intensity. The sputtering and disgruntled sounds grew louder the longer he ignored it. For the sake of his sanity, he went to talk to the housekeeper and was confident he could resolve the problem quickly.
Which was to say he completely disappeared into a single-minded pursuit of learning his bike and all things motorcycle.
“I know they are seed packets, but why?” Watson looked at the packets, opened his mouth, closed his mouth, looked at Holmes and back to the packets before finding his voice again. “These are all radishes.”
The end, Sprout. Bedtime.”

I planted my arms on either side of him and my knees on the bed between his legs.
Holmes shook his head yes and they began discussing and sketching out the new plan.
Holmes was silhouetted against the window. Watson untangled himself from the bedding and went to Holmes. Holmes was looking out of the window perhaps at something or nothing at all; he could not decide at this angle.
Holmes grumbled and changed direction towards the shore and the crashing waves. Watson stayed by the clumps of sea kale and watched him. There was almost something boyish of Holmes walking near the shore at low tide carrying his shoes, trousers rolled up, and the water trying to lap at his ankles. The breeze ruffled the remains of his grey hair, giving him an unkempt and soft look. Holmes stopped and squatted by what looked like a flat, smooth rock on the shore. Watson could just make out Holmes reaching to touch it and immediately he let out a cry of pain followed by an oath. Holmes stumbled and let out another cry before buckling to one knee.
Sherlock had done what his brother wanted, well partially. He did go back to London; but not to the internship or anything else his nosey brother would set up for him to control his life. The flat he found was barely fit for habitation and damp because it was basement level, but it was his. He spent his time experimenting and further solidifying the flat’s status as barely uninhabitable. Of course Mycroft found him and visited. He fretted and Sherlock dutifully ignored him.
Watson sighed, signalling Holmes to help him stand up. “Holmes, no one -
“If you’d like to sit on her, your more than welcome to try one on the floor.”
He walked over and cupped his hand on Sherlock’s jaw. The novelty of looking down and seeing his desire mirrored was amazing. Sherlock stretched his hand and hooked it behind Johns head pulling slightly. John submitted and pulled close enough so they almost kiss.
“I’ll bring you tea in bed.”
In the process he deleted the information about the solar system. It was time for that tune to go. It was all superfluous knowledge of no importance. Why did he need that clutter of information for his brain to whirl around and whip into a frenzy?
“We have tea cups, bowls, ladles... Besides, I am only responsible for two glasses.”
“Of course, but I wouldn’t want anything… How do I put this? unpleasant to happen.”
“I only bring out one type of glass.”
Holmes had been in an uncommunicable mood since their discussion of the manuscript and the arrival of the letter that afternoon. Holmes kept to himself walled off in his chemistry room, giving curt answers, if any at all, to Watson’s questions.
“Well, for instance, this,” he stroked my ring finger with two of his fingers, “means I intend to bugger you into the mattress.”
My eyes shot up to his. It was a sign of vulnerability of acceptance. Something only the person you intended to bond with asked. In other circumstances it was scandalous to remove someone’s gloves.
We held each other’s gaze as we pressed our palms together.
Watson was having a strange day, and the strangeness was not attributed to his new inscrutable roommate. No, this queerness was due to an ordinary object in his room: a wardrobe.
The plans were not...
Holmes smirked. Watson gripped the edge of his hat tighter as he felt his anger rise again. “No, none of that. I am only a few years older than you and my so-called failing memory doesn’t explain it. How can you be sure it wasn’t you?”
I did as instructed and waited for my next task. Holmes walked up to me. He stood close enough where I could touch him if I reached out my hand. While keeping his eyes on me he lifted his good hand. It was, as expected, covered by a glove. He slowly raised his tugged hand and tried tugging at the pointer finger of the glove but stopped.
