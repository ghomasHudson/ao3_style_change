“Whoa, whoa, wait a second-” Dean’s shocked voice was loud in the echo of the bathroom. He tried to turn on his heels, but his knee hit the corner of the wall, making him flinch in pain.
When the blonde waitress walked over to their table Dean sighed with relief, at least he could focus his attention elsewhere. She seemed about Sammy’s age and had legs for days. She wore some old keds sneakers that had for sure been bright red someday, but were now only a faded worn-out hue of blood orange. Her smooth legs seemed to go on forever, but actually ended at the hem of a pair of blue shorts, that gave way to a long-sleeved white shirt and an apron, full of oily stains. Her face opened up in a big smile.
we get to it” It wasn’t a question for him. If Cas couldn’t heal him, Dean was more than happy to go out fighting, especially if he was fighting to keep Cas alive.
This was the setting stone in Dean’s gut feeling - he had been right - something was going on, something was about to happen. And maybe his dad didn’t even know that yet, maybe no one did. The idea that there was someone working against them, spreading false intel, was dangerous, and he knew he had to find out exactly what was going on, before deciding if, and who, had to know.  This knowledge weighed on his shoulders, and he had to decide, fast, if he trusted what Castiel was telling him, if he was not the enemy and someone else was, he had to help him. He would have to do whatever it took to keep his family, his city, safe.
The next hour Dean studied his newest conquest, she kept looking back at him while serving other clients, and then back the clock. They hadn’t exchanged any more words, and it felt pretty clear that this would be just a one night stand - she didn’t seem bothered by the fact.
It had been his most loyal companion ever since his dad  started letting him use it more and more, until eventually he gave it to him a few years later.
Once again Castiel found himself surrounded by nature, however this time he wasn’t standing in a tropical forest. The coordinates he had received led to Motoa, a remote location in Tibet surrounded by nothing but mountains and rivers. The sky was beautifully decorated by all shapes of clouds and Castiel wondered for a moment why he didn’t come to places like this more often.
He wondered for a moment if it was mandatory to get down on his knees and fold his hands but quickly decided that it was just stupid. Instead, he sat down at the edge of his bed, his gaze focused on the trees outside his window, before he closed his eyes tight, letting his neck lower until his forehead met his thumbs, hands over knees.
The meeting was fast to end after that, the day was just beginning and all the angels had jobs to do. Gadreel and Uriel were the last to leave, waiting for Metatron’s orders.
Castiel didn't look at him, he seemed to focus on something in the distance. And just when Dean wanted to ask about it, he spoke.
At the bar, Dean could finally relax a little. The game was on, and Sam had decided to tag along. This was good, it felt just like old times.
Here in the dark, it was hard for Dean to rationalize anything. He just felt things, things he’d never felt before, that he didn’t even think he was capable of feeling. But he felt the absence mostly, the way his bed felt emptier than it ever had, colder than before, even though Cas had never even been there. Just the thought of Cas laying there, next to him, made Dean’s heart beat faster until he was too awake to fall back asleep.
"Sorry, boy, but we got ambushed." Bobby shrugged apologetically. A cut ran across his left eyebrow and cheekbone.
“Thank you” She handed him the receipt, her number scribbled in rounded numbers on the bottom. Dean couldn’t help but smirk at the hastily written numbers, behind the waitress’s back -
And Dean had to try everything in his power not to laugh (he failed miserably). Castiel was definitely wearing human clothes, hell he was even wearing the typical hunters’ get-up; flannel, cargo pants, and a long coat that lacked any imaginative color. He’d done well in that department, however, he was wearing two shirts on top of each other, a baseball hat, and boots that looked like they belonged in a show window at Hot Topic.
"Are you gonna be at the negotiation?" Dean couldn't help but wonder, he knew that his chances of getting a straightforward answer were slim here, but something about this whole situation wasn’t sitting right with him, and he found himself worrying about Cas. Which was practically ridiculous, with him being an angel, a warrior most likely capable of killing every hunter present at the negotiation.
“Never mind my name, the only name you’ll be calling out tonight, is God’s” He winked. “What time do you get off?”
When they were younger Sam and Dean used to live with their uncle Bobby during the week. He was an older grumpy man who always seemed to smell of alcohol and rarely took off his worn-out baseball cap. However they had grown fond of Bobby because underneath all the snappy remarks and his scruffy beard, he had a big heart. Bobby cared for them as if they were his own sons. Dean often heard Bobby and his dad fighting; usually about them. According to Bobby their dad was too (damn) obsessed with hunting and didn’t spend enough time with his children.
“What is this new plan?” Joshua pushed. His demeanor wasn’t nearly as composed as Metatron’s, the hostility against the other angel was clear on his face.
Dean balled his hands up into fists, digging his nails into the palm of his hand with all his strength, he
Dean noticed that Castiel’s appearance was far from what Hollywood made people believe angels looked like. For example, he didn’t appear to have any wings or a harp for that matter. Instead, he wore something that Dean could only describe as loose-fitting clothes that were made out of a material he had never seen before. They resembled human clothes in some ways, but they wouldn’t exactly appear in Jo’s fashion magazines, which mind you, he had only read once because he got bored of the never-ending chores at Ellen’s.
Sam ordered his boring porridge with berries, while Dean had his eye on the chicken waffle and bacon combo. The food arrived and both boys tucked in with their stomachs growling after driving through the night. When they had both downed a considerable amount of food they talked about the fact that both the pack of werewolves and the group of demons had been expecting them. Sam pointed out that it was all too coincidental and Dean couldn’t have agreed more, there was definitely something fishy going on here. He wanted to tell Sam about the angel, he really did. But something was telling him not to. Dean couldn’t tell if it was because of the angel’s request not to, but then why would he care about what angels wanted. And even if he did tell Sam, what would it solve exactly? The angel said they would never meet again and Dean wouldn’t want it any other way, so case closed. They scarfed down the rest of their food and Dean went to pay while Sam went to the restroom.
“Oh yes, they’ve been fighting wars ever since the dawn of time. You see, angels are keepers of the world, of humanity, all thousands of both.” Curt had busied himself with studying the label on the back of his beer bottle.
It worked like a charm. The could-be-heavy-weight-champion of an angel yelled out more Enochian, and Dean didn’t need to be fluent to understand it was probably a string of insults directed at him, and probably a death threat or two. But it was enough of an emotional reaction for him to lose his cool, and just jab at Dean, which in turn, made it so he could slide to the side as his opponent's arms lifted in the air to get the memento to stab him. He managed to shuffle to his feet as the blade got jagged into the dirt right by his shoulder, leaving the angel to try and pull it out.
This was the first time Cas could let in the thoughts he had been trying to organize, trying to put together. When Dean had prayed to him, a few nights ago, sounding completely broken down, he knew there was something that he had missed. He still couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that Dean hadn’t been happy about the massacre of his brothers and sisters, a hunter feeling remorse for
He tossed the duffel and weapons in the trunk of the Impala and got in. All that was left was to get to the cabin and hope that Cas had made it back too.
Dean juggled the bags in his arms, trying to put the key in the lock to open the motel room door, exhaling tiredly as he managed to put the bags down on the table inside after kneeing the door open.
“Hunters have always been paranoid sons of bitches,” Dean stated, and Castiel was surprised at this demonstration of non-conformism coming from him. “You know, what I can’t understand is  why Heaven hasn’t moved against the city, I mean if it was me I’d be pretty damn pissed.”
“Cheers to that,” Jo bumped her beer with his. “Although, when I ran into you guys, he really didn’t seem all that uninterested. Just saying, are you sure it’s like that?”
“Yes, look Jo it was great running into you but we really have to go.” Dean tried to find a quick end to this really unwanted encounter.
They’d watched movies, and cooked, and talked - they mostly talked - but it wasn’t like he could tell Sam that, he would just end up asking a bunch of follow-up questions Dean wouldn’t be able to answer.
It didn’t take Bobby long to find him. Dean was waiting in the door opening when he saw Bobby’s car pull up. He threw the duffle bag over his shoulder and slowly made his way to the car, trying to hide his limp.
He didn’t allow himself to think of what this meant, it was unfair to project his own feelings onto Castiel. He might have been thrilled to hear that angels were capable of having emotions, but that didn’t mean Cas was suddenly into him, or that he hadn’t rejected him that night. But in this moment, where it was just the two of them in the dim moonlight coming from outside, he would enjoy it nonetheless. No matter how this would end, he would always have tonight.
He watched Castiel’s show of strength, lifting the angel off his back with one arm, and slamming his slashed palm into the tree, with the other.
“Manuela Arias” Sam’s Spanish pronunciation was substandard, to say the least, but it was still better than Dean’s (whose only memory of taking Spanish in high school was the smoking hot teacher he’d stare at, Señorita Garcia,
“To be honest I don’t know what Heaven will and won’t do at this time, that all depends on the reasoning behind Metatron’s motives.”
What Gabriel asked of him went against his every instinct - he was talking about rebelling. Of course he would follow Michael, he had followed him for the better part of a thousand years, but now, when Heaven’s allegiances seemed to shift, and Metatron rose as a new leader, who was he to disobey? He was merely a soldier of Heaven, created to follow orders and never think for himself.
“I think you’re in over your head,” Gabriel said, closing the distance between him and Metatron’s seat. "Though I admit, up close it's quite a big head."
his own words echoed back to him. He had seen the hurt in Dean’s eyes as he’d said it, he could see the self-loathing there, clear as day, too. He strongly disliked arguing with Dean, yet somehow dissension seemed to occupy most of their conversations, he had realized, this human could make him feel the most intense emotions. He felt happiness and excitement, he felt things he knew not how to name, and he felt anger and pain like he’d never felt before, all this stirred up by one man, it was at the same time exhilarating and terrifying.
Shortly after their dad left, Sam started his research, and Dean immediately turned his attention back to his gun cleaning task, losing himself in thoughts of angels and hunters. Something was clearly about to happen, his dad had never given them any sort of job to do with angels, as far as John Winchester was concerned, the further his children could stay away from these creatures the better - and yet, here they were, tapping into books that were off-limits, lore on angels. With what purpose? He thought nothing had happened in 30 years.
It just bounced around in his head - an angel, the man who had been standing next to his dad was an angel,  just there talking with the hunters like it was the most normal thing to do.
"No," Cas shook his head. He stretched out his leg in front of him, his feet grazing against Dean’s, who felt a little shock of electricity run up his leg.
“I think it’s safe to assume that an angel had to have given hunters the blades.” He sighed, a deep sorrow etched in the creases of his forehead, and pursed lips framed his eyes. “This is unquestionably serious if it is true. Angel on angel violence, even if it is through the weaponizing of hunters, is the worst crime any angel can commit.”
Dean tried not to feel the sting that came with the angel’s words, to Cas, he probably looked like a crazy person, shouting and praying his name over and over again. But did he not understand? He was only like this because of
“Didn’t you hear a word of what I just said? I’m not asking for your permission, I’m telling you, I’m going, whether you like it, or not.”
“So, how did things go with your brother?” He had to get his mind off things, keep himself from thinking back to-
Sam had been talking for at least the last five minutes, something about him and the girl he’d been seeing, he tried to tune into the conversation by coming up with some absurd obscene questions and obligatory jokes. The conversation shifted and they even talked about Jo’s love life much to Dean’s dismay; and how Bobby and Ellen were apparently a whole
“I’m not. I’m lying to you.” A boyish grin eased his concern, Dean was kidding. He followed the hunter’s gaze as he closed his eyes and let himself fall backward until he was laying on the dirt. “I’m a big boy Cas, I can handle a twisted ankle.”
He jogged down to the dirt, “What the hell Sam, why on earth would you bring her?” Dean’s arm shot up, accusatory, to Jo. His eyebrows were raised, impatiently waiting for an answer.
“You’ve been?” Dean asked, feeling immediately inadequate because of course Cas had been, he’d been everywhere in the world. Dean took a breath too, if only to ground himself. This day seemed to have been going on for years. He leaned against the wall of the cabin.
“No, no, not lie.” The sly grin that he wore so well spread across Metatron's face again. “We grant them those little favors, earn their trust and we show them the way. See, there is no lie.”
Dean couldn’t contain his disappointment, but it soon soured and turned into anger. Cas didn’t have to feel the same way, but he sure as shit didn’t need to keep giving him mixed signals and stringing him along, either. Dean swallowed the rest of his beer in a big gulp, and tossed it aside, hearing it break against the wooden floor. Cas looked startled, but Dean didn’t care.
“Well, you’ll have to just heal me then,” Dean shrugged. “Besides who else was gonna watch out for your ass? Mine definitely isn’t the only one worth saving.”
“He’s an angel,” Jo looked up from her plate like it was obvious. “Isn’t he?” Well, the fucking cat was out of the bag apparently. She was as much in this as she could’ve gotten herself into. Which was an awful thing in and of itself, but truth was that Dean could use some help. In about twenty-four hours he would manage to toss his whole life upside down, this was a hail-mary, and if it didn’t work, it wouldn’t matter who knew and who didn’t, they’d just be a bunch of corpses keeping secrets,
“Hey, get this,” Sam said, nodding toward the open book. “Originally in lore, angels were supposed to be protectors of humans, the tethers between humans and God.” Sam sat in the living room, books spread out all over the dining table. It’d been half an hour of silent studying before he finally spoke, and all that time, Dean had been waiting for him to say something, just so they could talk ábout whatever was going on.
“I don’t understand, what could a powerful angel want in a place of sin and iniquity?” Castiel looked somewhat uncomfortable as he followed after Dean.
“I can’t speak for all angels, just for myself.” He hesitated. His eyes finally dropping from Dean’s, down to the mattress, or his own hands, Dean couldn’t tell.
He stopped talking, and his heart was beating so loud he thought Cas might be able to hear it from the other side of the couch. Slowly, and hesitantly, he brought his eyes up from his hands to meet Cas’s.
He pushed the door open, following after his brother. “You don’t know what you’re talking about,” he spoke the words to Sam’s back, glaring at him, even though he wouldn’t see it. “And what do
“Well just don’t start feeling-“ Dean drew in a sharp breath. For some reason he expected the angel’s touch to feel cold, like his demeanor. But his hand felt like a warm touch, human even.
“Oh, he jokes now?” Dean let out a shaky breath, and what Castiel could maybe make out as a laugh. He glared at him like he could set him on fire, all at the same time.
Castiel turned to him, his expression was almost angry. “I’ve healed you countless times, I’ve healed your brother and now I’m giving you information that could get me killed within seconds, you should show me some respect.”
“I wanted to reach out to you sooner, but I didn’t know if I was being followed and I didn’t want to take any risks after what happened…”
Not many angels were missing. Castiel of course was a presence missing, but it was the first time he was absent, as Hael defended.
Though it was quiet in Pittsburg there was a sense of restlessness that Dean couldn’t quite place. Why would Bobby’s friend ask them to come all this way, if he was gonna skip town himself?
“I’m sure that’s only partly true,” Sam offered a small smile. “Why would you think that? Is it something that dad said?”
Dean’s heart sank just as quick as the relief of resting had washed over him. He was still trying to catch his breath, trying to gather enough air to tell Cas to fuck off, to tell him there was no way that was happening. “You’re--” His lungs burned and his throat ached as he sucked the cold January air inside, “-- a fucking idiot, Cas.” Was all he managed to get out between gasps. He raked his fingers through his hair, then used his forearm to dry the sweat on his temple.
Castiel’s expression turned unreadable for a second before he released the grip on Dean’s hand and pulled his own back. But before Dean could worry about the sudden reticence, the hand moved slowly towards his face until it gently brushed against his temple.
Castiel greeted him with a small nod, the material of his clothing reflected in the bright sunlight. For a second Dean wondered what the material could be, since it doesn’t look stiff yet it resembled the texture of tiny linked metal rings.
“I’m sorry for not leaving you any more notes, some important things came up and Heaven is an absolute mess right now.”
He was almost outside of the city walls now, if his legs could just hold on a little more, he could get there, he could call Cas’ name to the sky and hope to God he’d be alive to hear him, he would be able to see Cas in one piece and he would everything would be
“To develop feelings and emotions, it’s what sets angels such as me or yourself, apart from the others. They know not of earthly pleasures and have never felt, well anything really,” Metatron laughed before continuing, “and while they believe it makes them stronger, I believe that it makes them weak.”
She looked at him like she didn’t understand a word of what he just said, or maybe she just chose not to.
As he drove off he thought it best to let the whole thing go for now. He was confused enough of his own accord already, he didn’t want to explain it to anyone, including himself.
“Sammy?” Dean tried hard to ignore the blood that was pouring out of Sam’s throat at an alarming rate.
Somewhere in the back of his mind images flashed through, memories of all their fleeting glances, of hasted touches and hushed conversations, of all the times Dean had had to remind himself that this wasn’t okay. A voice, deep down, warned him that falling for an angel was intrinsically wrong, that he was a hunter, and Cas was an angel, and even if he could get past this himself, Cas probably never would. He replayed the moment Cas had told him it was
An unhappy gruntle preceded the actual words that came from the other end of the line. Dean nodded at the information, and thanked Bobby for it, saying his goodbyes.
No need to be nervous, for I would argue the traitor is not among us at the moment. This traitor would dare not sit here, mourning our brothers and sisters. So I ask of you, who is not here? Who is it, that still fights the natural order that works in Heaven? That has set me in the costly path of leading you?”
“Thanks, Cas,” It was the obvious thing to say, and it seemed like it was the only thing he said today.
“Is what true? You’re not making any sense,” Cas’s voice was soft and relaxed, still no idea of the storm going on inside Dean’s head.
“We-” I need your help,” He rephrased halfway through, as if deciding that this was between the two of them - that if Dean would help anyone, it would be Castiel.
His eyes were blurry and no amount of coffee could help him now. The words mixed together, and trying to decipher Sam’s scribbles was hard enough to do when he was well rested, but doing it after what was aiming to be the longest day ever, was damn near impossible. He kept glancing over at the clock on the wall. The minutes were slow to pass, and the hours even more so. Outside, the sun had long set and the moon was full enough to cast a clear shadow of the impala outside, over the dirt. Dean stared out the window and up to the sky.
“I’m sorry, I can't do this,” He pleaded, backing away from her. She looked back at him, in absolute shock. The look on her face, and the fact that she was an objectively attractive girl, made him think it was probably the first time this had happened to her. “I’m really sorry” he repeated, taking a hand to his face and just passing it through his hair.
Even so, it was worth a shot. Dean ordered them tequila shots, as Cas tried to explain everything to him - the deal was, a shot for every piece of the puzzle.
Castiel could give him, and even though the memory of what happened was still fresh and would still hurt in its own way, at least Dean didn’t have to stare at it in the mirror. It wasn’t difficult for Castiel to understand the troubled relationship Dean had with his father, always wanting to be a good little soldier, do as he was told, to be strong-willed and merciless, a killer, a
“Huh,” Dean wasn’t really sure what to say to that. He was used to being a hunter, and everything that came with the job, but then he’d never really been given much of an option. “I guess that makes sense,” He told him, even though he didn’t know if it did make any sense to him.
“There’s something that has to be done in order to save your city, in order to make sure this leader doesn’t get what he is after, and you have to trust me.” With the angel’s last words, he finally looked up - there it was, Castiel needed him to trust, what the angel failed to realize was that he already did.
“Angels might be absolute emotionless dicks, but they don’t do well without leadership. They are most definitely planning something against your city.”
"You should have thought about that before coming here. I got a family to feed, sorry to disappoint." the leader responded mockingly. Before Dean could think of another reply, the werewolf bared his teeth, a snarling and growling sound escaped the back of its throat.
Dean tried but couldn’t steady his breath, it felt like every time he thought he’d be able to calm down, a new wave of unleashed sobs tried to tear through him, but he wouldn’t let them. His heart felt like it was about to explode, and as much as he gasped for air, he still didn’t feel like he was breathing, at all.
“So that’s why you’re here.” Dean’s eyebrow raised, in suspicion. “To see how I feel about betraying my whole city and freeing Michael?”
This was a question Castiel had asked himself many times, one of the first indicators of the suspicion that revolved around Metatron, many had asked why it was taking so long to retrieve Michael - Joshua had most likely died due to the exact same question.
Well, there was a question he couldn’t answer. He didn’t like lying to Sam and would avoid it as long as he could. After a few seconds of silence, he got the message across. “
hearing him. If something were to happen to the angel, he didn’t know what he would do, or could do.
, but he couldn’t help but wonder if this was the chance he’d been waiting on. If this guy could, and would, tell him more about angels, there wasn’t a moment to waste.
Dean tossed a leg over Cas, hovering over his hips for a moment that seemed way too long, and managed to stand on the other side of him on the floor, bringing his other leg over too, hoping to whatever Gods were out there, that he wouldn’t wake Cas up.
“Oh please, you don’t have to thank me, that was nothing, we all struggle, to some extent, with daddy issues, don’t we?” Curt smiled, and while he seemed to be joking, Dean didn’t appreciate it all that much.
“Obliterating everyone in our path, we might as well kill everyone who refuses faith then.” Anna’s voice rose angrily in response, looking around for some agreement.
Gabriel could have sworn that his persuasion was going in the right direction, nothing seemed to indicate otherwise. That was until Adina suddenly called for others to stand by while she ‘handled’ this conversation, and it didn’t take much else to know that he was in deep fucking shit.
Dean didn’t realize tears were still streaming down his face until Castiel gently wiped one away with his finger, his eyes still concerned but a comforting smile on his lips.
“They killed them Cas, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would happen and if I did I would’ve warned you, I don’t care about the consequences, I just- this was wrong, and I should’ve known but-” He was ready to keep talking, his mouth just kept going, way ahead of his brain. Probably because it was the only way he could delay Castiel’s reaction, maybe he’d get mad and just disappear, but Dean had just gotten him back and there was no way he was letting him go again.
And just like that, as fast as the rage had fallen upon him, Castiel’s demeanor alleviated, most likely satisfied to have made his point.
Dean wondered why angels would have to hide something in the first place and he wasn’t sure if he even wanted to find out.
Dean rested his head against the window, it was nice and cool against his head, which was still spinning. After a while, he could see the familiar dark walls growing taller in the distance and the knot in Dean’s stomach tightened. They were nearly back home which meant that he had to explain everything that had happened. He strongly hoped his dad would not be waiting there for him.
had just slaughtered half a dozen angels. Who he knew Castiel called his brothers and sisters, to make matters even worse. He had to tell Cas what happened, but there was a pit in his stomach that tightened the more he thought of how Castiel would react. Would he hate him? Would he blame him for the hunters’ actions and leave? Would he attack without question?
. It physically pained him, like a kick to his gut, that Cas was so uncompromising, so resolute on being a goddamned martyr.
, he’d told him what Gabriel had asked of him - to lay low, and not use any angel juice, just keep an eye on the Shady Lady and any sign of Metatron  - Dean figured it would mean a stake-out and
“Dean, what’s going on? Is there something you’re not telling me?” Sam bent a little closer to Dean, a soft expression on his face as if to say it was okay to talk to him, that he would never judge him.
His grace wasn’t helping to hide the heat that was rising in his cheeks at the spoken words, but part of him was too relieved to care. Dean didn’t look unnerved by him, he didn’t look frightened or appalled, no, he looked at him with curiosity and fascination. And in that moment Castiel accepted every negative emotion he had ever experienced and decided he would relive it over and over a thousand times if it meant he was able to
Dean propped himself up in his right elbow, slumping against the wall, and took another good look at Cas -
He walked over to stand next to him, leaned (gently) against the car, too. He looked at Cas, by his side, staring scarily straight ahead. His face looked as smooth as a marble, under the blue-ish glow of the moon. His eyes were as clear and bright as the first day he’d met him, but somehow he looked tired, like recent events had burned away at him, and he looked like a kicked puppy. Dean resisted an urge to touch him, anywhere, just a brush of his thumb against his cheek, just a small touch of reassurance. He didn’t know if it would serve to reassure Cas or him, though.
“Hold up, why are you telling us this?” Dean asked, hoping they wouldn’t notice the slight panic in his voice. “Dad will be furious if he finds out that we know stuff that got discussed in the meeting.”
Demons were a fan of cliches all right. Gathering in abandoned buildings, possessing creepy-looking bastards, and waiting until dark to go outside for their version of a good time. Most of the demons they caught had been outside of their little safety bunkers, but hunters didn’t believe in taking chances. So Sam and Dean drove up to Colorado with Bobby to deal with these sons of bitches in the place where they were hiding. They had agreed to split up, to cover both entrances. Unfortunately during a stake-out, it became clear that one of the entrances used wasn’t a door at all, but a window on the first floor. After three (very heated) rounds of rock, paper, scissors, Dean was headed over to the dumpsters that stood below the window. A demon knife carefully tucked away in his right boot.
“Dean, you don’t have to pretend that your father didn’t just beat you senseless, this does not look like a little argument.” The angel’s voice was clipped and hard, and Dean had no idea how to react. “You look like you got hit by a cement truck.”
“Yeah, let’s just treat it like any other hunt,” Dean muttered, overwhelmed. How was he supposed to get Michael’s grace from freaking South America? “Good job guys. Thanks.”
They stood there, for a while, processing the events of the evening, sometimes one of them would start to say something only to give up when they couldn’t even comprehend it themselves, Eventually, they gave up, agreed to try and find more from their respective ends.
He would have to ask something else. Dean was expecting a question and he didn’t have the courage to ask about what he really wanted to know.
Castiel tensed at the mention of Dean, more suspicion flooded him as Metatron spoke. He knew his words didn’t match what the other angel actually thought, it was simple manipulation, designed to boost his ego and assure he was still on his side. Cas didn’t know if Metatron suspected of his alliance, with Gabriel and Michael, or not, but he knew he had some sort of angle, the other shoe was bound to drop. Metatron’s face turned into the grin that held nothing but menace in it.
“What? Am I not good enough for you? I'll let you in on a little secret, I’m the more handsome one,” Dean said without breaking eye contact.
him being an angel in order to be around him, and just like that some things started making sense, words cut short, constricted movements, and fleeting moments, Castiel was under the impression that Dean merely tolerated his presence. That awareness came to rest on the back of his chest, weighing on him with every breath he took,
Dean went to check them in, nervously looking around for any familiar faces in the lobby - there weren’t any. Still, he fidgeted with his sleeves, and when the lady at the front desk asked him how many beds they needed, he chuckled uncomfortably. When he went hunting with Sam they never asked that.
The more he thought about the state of things, the more wrong it all felt -  angels plotting against humanity, hunters imprisoning an archangel, his brothers plotting against each other, and Castiel?
after what he did. And yet,  he couldn’t help all the thoughts that drowned out his conscience, anger for having been rejected, for the situation he’d found himself in, and a cocktail of other emotions he couldn’t begin to understand.
“How were they able to kill them? I thought it was impossible to kill an angel.” For what felt like a whole minute, there was silence, and Dean thought the line had gone down, “Bobby, you there?”
There was nothing in the cupboards but milk, which was probably out of its due date. He decided he might as well go to the store and grab some supplied for the next few days. For the time being, he would like it if he could keep Cas grounded, at least until he could get the 411 on the situation. Of course, he knew Cas would argue with that, so he wouldn’t even tell him until it was necessary.
Cas didn’t say anything, he just wrapped his arms around Dean in return, waiting until his breathing slowed down. They breathed together in silence, with Cas soothingly rubbing small circles across his back. Once his breathing had calmed down, he sat back to look at the angel again, just to make sure the whole thing had been a nightmare and Cas wouldn’t suddenly disappear.
Somewhere in his mind, Dean recognized the sudden shift in the angel’s speech - the way he backed away when he addressed him, the way he created all that space between them, calling him a hunter, as if this
He pulled it out, took the safety off with trained speed, and placed his finger over the trigger. Something in him made him turn to catch Cas’s eyes as if to ask permission to murder one of his brothers. Cas didn't even waver. He nodded with his head, as he pierced his blade into the other angel’s stomach, up to his knuckles.
He sighed, gathering some courage. “Christ, you can’t do this to me, make me fall for you and then get yourself killed!” He hesitated for a second, he hated how he sounded, so exposed, so vulnerable - in every sense of the way. But it was all out there anyway, and if this was the only way to convince him not to go through with his suicide plan, so be it. “I need you, Cas.”
The sound of a car pulling up to the driveway disrupted his thoughts, and he saw Sam sit up straighter on the couch, from the corner of his eye.
“Why do you think your city is so determined on getting answers out of Michael?” He was a coward, once a fearless leader of Heaven’s armies, now reduced to a gutless (as Dean would say, even though Castiel knew not how the lack of intestines could translate to a person of cowardly manner), poor excuse for a soldier.
Cas’s body followed the impulse and held on to Dean with both arms now - he felt as if his body was moving on its own, before he could stop himself he found his hands sliding across Dean’s back, feeling his skin beneath his fingers, hot to the touch. Every time Dean’s muscles tensed and flinched under his hands, Cas’s willpower faded just a bit more.
A whisper of relief escaped Dean’s lips as they were met by Cas’s, a sound Dean couldn’t even recognize as coming from himself. His eyes fluttered closed as soon as their lips touched, and he finally allowed himself to give in, grabbing Cas by the hem of his jacket to pull him closer (if that was even possible). He let his hands drift under the jacket and aimlessly roam around Cas’s side and back, feeling the way his skin would prickle under his shirt, at the cold touch. The angel’s lips were warm and soft against his and they moved with caution. They brushed, slowly, and Dean was in awe of how Cas trailed his bottom lip with his, timidly but insistent.
“Well,” Gabriel’s typical sarcastic tone shielded him from the cold, metaphorical, knife stuck on his back. “This has been a lovely surprise, but I should get going now.” He turned around to leave, but it was obvious that she was not going to let him go that easily.
He didn’t want to talk about it anymore, the look Sam was giving him was precisely the very thing he’d wanted to avoid. The pity in his gaze made Dean want to swat at him, this did not happen to
All of the sudden, interrupting Dean’s impromptu pity party, a rustle of feathers made him jerk his head back, just in time to see Castiel appearing out of thin air. He would never get used to this.
She stared at him, still and steady, the doubt looming over her head was not reflected on her posture.
"I was wondering when you’d make an appearance," Commander Barnes spoke, at no angel in particular, as they stood in line, shoulder to shoulder, not giving away who was in charge.
Dean’s blood ran cold. His heart was beating so fast it might as well have jumped out of his damn chest. What angels? He wanted to ask, but his throat felt too dry and his mouth unable to form the words, and he was sure Bobby wouldn’t know the names of the angels killed.
“You won’t tell me what’s going on, and you look like you’re about to go off on a killing spree, so I’m not letting you leave here alone. And that’s final.”
Dean, perhaps a bit over excitedly, ordered them both double bacon cheeseburgers with a side of fries.
They both turned their heads to Sam, in surprise. Dean, dumbfoundedly and appreciative of the distraction, but guilty to drag his little brother into yet another fight. And John, he just looked like he was about to burst -and then, he did.
These thoughts faded as he drifted off again, letting his head fall to rest against the back of the couch. In his dreams he found himself trying to get away from a group of sharks, their deadly sharp teeth were threatening enough to make the hairs on the back of his neck stand up, but there was something captivating about them too. Suddenly he found himself chasing the sharks, trying to desperately figure out what could possibly be alluring about them, but no matter how hard he tried, he never managed to get close to them. He woke up, startled by Bobby’s angry tone, and he realized he’d actually slept for one or two hours, as the sun was starting to come up.
“You think I don’t know you, Dean Winchester?” Jo followed him into the kitchen and took out a plate from the bottom cabinet. “I run into you in town, with a very good looking new boy toy, and now you’re here, before training?” She slid him the plate and pulled him a chair.
as Bobby had put it. And Dean wasn’t going to fight him on that, not if it meant getting to keep his secret a little longer.
“I have three garrisons under my command. They understood I couldn’t free him. They are ready to fight, to avenge Gabriel’s death. Even if it’s under me.”
“You think they’re planning an attack against us?” Every hunter at the table turned towards the voice in surprise, it belonged to John Winchester. He rarely spoke during meetings.
He looked towards the door in a momentary flash of hope that Sam had decided to come home, but there was no one, he was on his own. His father was stronger than him, military-trained, heavier, and angrier - it was a blackout type of rage and Dean knew it all too well. Sometimes John would drink and get mad over nothing, and there was nothing he could do about it, except tell Sam to go to his room and lock the door, and he’d take it just to keep his dad from touching a hair on Sam’s head. But this time, his father wasn’t drunk, he didn’t think so at least. He knew deep down his dad wasn’t a complete asshole, that John was just passionate about his job, and a little too hung up on revenge probably. All he wanted was to keep his family safe, to raise them tough, so they wouldn’t get hurt. But right now his dad couldn’t care less about Dean getting hurt, he was furious and there was no stopping him.
“Yes. It resembles a flower I’ve smelled before, but it can’t be the same.” Cas’s eyebrows furrowed, his eyes darting up as if he was trying to remember something. “It’s just that this flower I’m thinking of, it only grows in the deep Amazonian forest, I don’t see how it’s possible for it to be inside this box right now.”
“Listen I’ll happily trade you for someone better looking and less annoying, but even if I would take her along you know that Ellen will kill me.”
“If you wanted to undress me, you know all you had to do was ask? - ” He laughed, his eyes closing for a second. “Castiel,” he made his voice sound deeper, trying to imitate Cas’s. “Angel of the lord,” he mocked him, and Cas rolled his eyes at the whole ordeal. “The most adorable angel in the garrison,” his voice back to normal, even if dragging the words a bit.
. No heroic guns blazing end and absolutely not a peaceful one. Well, he favored Poltergeist over movies with sappy endings anyway.
“Don’t get me wrong, if they’re evil sons of bitches, they have to go down and I’ll be the first to stop them, but, what if they’re not? Evil, I mean.”
Jo approached, followed by Sam. She had a red pen and squeezed her arm between Bobby’s and Dean’s, to doodle on the map. “We’ve narrowed it down to these options.” She said as she circled two towns a few hundred miles apart. Dean couldn’t even tell what country it was yet. He looked at Sam begrudgingly.
“What prophecy?” He expected nothing else of Dean if not for him to be inquisitive. This was something Castiel had started to wonder about, started to tie bits and pieces over time, together.
“Hey!” Sam interrupted, reaching his arm between the two of them, in the little space they left for their chests to swell up with the anger that was brewing. “ Hey! I’m perfectly fine taking care of myself if you two haven’t noticed - I'm a grown-ass adult.”
Dean had still to talk to his dad, who hadn’t been home for the past couple of days. Bobby had told him he was sleeping at the command center in one of the bunkers, and he’d already been informed Dean was home, so he figured that the man was probably buying himself some time to decide what he wanted to do. And Dean couldn’t do anything but wait patiently, like a pig lining up for slaughter.
“You can’t-” Dean practically had to yank the words that were sticking to his throat. He didn’t know if they’d live to see another day, this wasn’t the time to wuss out on saying what he meant. No space, no time for misunderstandings, “-you can’t do this
“Fine, we’ll tell him.” Dean finally agreed. “You guys find out if dad still has it, or if he’s hidden it somewhere in the meantime.”
“It’s just hard to understand how an angel would want anything to do with a guy like me, how this isn’t some kind of ploy to betray me... ” His hands ran through his hair, unable to fully process the things he was saying, and how naked he felt standing in this alleyway, trying to tell the truth, for once in his life, no games, no jokes to hide behind. “And this doesn’t come easy for me, but for some reason, I know I can trust you, Cas. So… just bare with me, okay?”
“Jesus I’m not bullshitting you,” he didn’t even know what to tell his younger brother. “I just, I don’t know man, honestly nothing really happened. What do you want me to tell you, like I said, he just doesn’t feel that way about me.” Dean’s mouth slipped and all the words spilled out in a sullen tone, “happy?”
as I do.” Cas used the same word, amused at how it made Dean flush a little even though he’d been the one to say it.
hadn’t been helping him for months now, and it reminded him of when they first met. He tried to shake the feeling it gave him, the nauseating feeling in his stomach when Castiel looked down on him, sounding so distant, so detached.
“Cas?” Dean frowned, this time the concern was his, as he saw the angel look up at nowhere in particular, eyes squinting and lips pursing.
was the best thing that had happened in his life in a long time, and he wasn’t just about to let his stupid
When they made their way into the cramped bedroom the lack of space in between them made Dean regret his decision, how had this not been awkward the night before, when he held Cas as the nightmare washed away?
The punching bags hung in the far back, in the far right corner. This was Dean’s favorite thing to do. It’s not like he
“Can I get you anything else for today?” Dean nearly jumped out of his skin as the waitress had returned to their table, laying her hand on Dean’s shoulder. He tensed up, as his eyes slowly, almost unwillingly, darted from Castiel’s to the waitress.
Sam, on the other hand, was quite the opposite of his older brother. He got outstanding grades in school, and while his training skills weren’t bad, they couldn’t compare to his brother’s. Though that could be explained by the differences in their personalities. Dean had always been more of a take action first kind of guy, while Sam always made sure to estimate the situation they were in and act with more caution.
“We don’t keep…” He couldn’t continue the lie, he would think of something later, but right now, over the phone and with Sammy eavesdropping, he couldn’t risk telling Bobby the truth, especially considering a whole angel massacre had just gone down and he was literally bunking with the enemy. “We’ll talk later, I swear, now, for the love of everything that is sacred, would you please just tell me how they did it?”
Castiel watched as the lines around Dean’s eyes got deeper, how his eyebrows drew together and his jaw clenched. He tried not to follow the line of his jaw, where his razor had missed the growing stubble and met the soft of his neck, tried not to notice the freckles that dusted his skin. He carefully avoided Dean’s lips, shining and pursed together waiting for Castiel to respond.
“What?” Castiel didn’t even register the words Dean had spoken, he let his shoulder fall against the bedroom door’s frame.
Dean wanted to tell him he was fine, he wanted to tell Cas how relieved he was to know that he was alive. Instead, all that came out is a broken sob. He was clutching and grabbing at every inch of Castiel he could touch. The worried look in the angel’s eyes only grew stronger.
“What? I thought you hated angels even worse than demons? Didn’t you use to say that you were able to understand demons better, because at least they were clear on their motives?” Sam was getting visibly vexed at Dean’s position on angels. He was usually the one to rationalize and try to have perspective on people, on monsters. However, this was going to have to be just another thing to add to the list of Dean’s long-kept secrets.
and he might just not be so charmed by my good looks and witty remarks as you.” Castiel was taken aback by Dean’s choice of wording and even though he knew he was exaggerating for the comedic relief he needed at the moment, he still felt very exposed.
Every meeting, it seemed new faces sat around this table. Castiel couldn’t help but worry at this evolution - more and more angels were pledging their allegiance to Metatron. He understood why, he couldn’t blame them. With Michael still imprisoned on earth, Gabriel not making any public advances, and no other viable options, Metatron’s garrison grew bigger every day, and the consequences of not joining him had started falling heavily upon the resisting angels. He knew there were still big players on the board who had yet to side with Metatron, but he also wasn’t entirely sure where they stood.
they possess, and it is our job to help them believe this is true. For example; when a hairless ape chooses between left or right, we let them think either results in a different outcome, when in fact, we know that everything is already set in stone.”
The vibrant light diminished slowly and Dean’s eyes fluttered open, and he took in the sight of the angel sitting in front of him. Castiel’s lips were slightly parted, probably from concentrating, and there was a slight color to his cheeks but his eyes, the blue eyes Dean had once refused to call pretty, were full of life and undeniably beautiful.
“Yes of course,” Castiel nodded. He would have to follow his orders sooner or later if he didn’t want to raise suspicion. All he had to do was simply get over his odd human savior complex. His involvement with these humans could cost him his life. He had to focus on his missions, as he had for the past thousands of years.
“Just a little family argument,” Dean didn’t know who he was sparing on the words, it seemed quite obvious it had been more than an argument. “With the old man,” it hurt to speak, and he somewhat struggled to get the words out.
“Yes,” Dean answered finally. “We talked and, uhm-” he didn’t want to tell Sam about it, hell, he didn’t want to tell anyone about it, “-yeah that was about it.” He prayed Sam would just take it and not overanalyze his situation.
“We should turn around,” he said quietly, his voice wasn’t nearly as steady as he wanted it to be. He tried to ignore his own thoughts of what Dean must’ve been thinking as he did so.
“You look like you’re gonna pull a muscle.”  Dean’s voice pulled him back to reality. “What got you thinking so hard?”
Dean’s heart pounded faster and faster, weighing a ton in his chest. Something serious had definitely happened, and Cas was still holding back on him. “Yeah sure, anything,” he said, and in that moment, he was sure it was true - he would do anything to help Cas.
“Dean, you have been angry ever since I brought us here.” Cas was just stating the obvious now, leaving Dean more irritated by the second. “It’s not like I can do anything about the attacks. In fact, I didn’t want you to come at all because this is the exact danger I had foreseen.”
“They’re still alive,” Castiel hesitated for a moment. He should mention the close encounters to Uriel, but that also meant explaining how these hunters miraculously survived. He decided to say nothing.
“I have to leave now. Live a good life, Dean Winchester.” The angel, Castiel or whatever, nodded. His expression was hard to read and before Dean could even respond, the angel disappeared into thin air.
“No, of course not,” Dean tried hard to stop his thoughts from spiraling. He had discovered that angels were at least capable of some type of emotion through his time with Cas. Every time he came across a new side of Cas, whenever the angel did something Dean had never seen him do before, he found himself enjoying it, always kind of making a mental note to try and get another reaction out of him.
He opened his eyes and turned his head on the pillow, trying to make out Cas’s reaction, it was difficult to see in the dark, but he was pretty sure he could make out a smile. No doubt that Cas was sure Dean couldn’t see it, because it never faltered, it just lingered there.
this was not going to work out in Dean’s favor. It was probably summoning its buddies, while he was still alone. Speaking of, what the hell happened to team mentality? Dean knew he had the demon knife, but he was waiting for the right moment to use it. Any mistake could pretty much cost him his life. He reached the flask of holy water, ready to throw more into the demon's direction.
"So guess she won't be coming around for Christmas dinner then?" Sam walked into the living room, to find Dean spread out across the couch. Their dad hadn’t been home in a week or so, and Dean hadn’t seen him since the warehouse, which was great since all he could think of when he was around was to confront him, and that wouldn’t end well for either of them.
“Have at it boys” John Winchester’s voice made itself heard over the storm that had settled above them, and horror spread over the angels' faces, all at once - they stood no chance. As if synchronized to one another, the five hunters behind the angels buried the silver blades into their backs. A simultaneous cry in pain tore through the forest, only overshadowed by manic laughter coming from Barnes Jr. The same blue light that spilled through the wound of the first angel down lit up the clearing and shone on even through the clouds, it could be seen from miles away, and it was too bright for any hunters to keep their eyes open and bear witness to their massacre. The dead bodies collapsed to the ground, their lifeless corpses tangled on the ground where impressive wing-shaped marks had scorched the forest floor, spreading through five feet of dirt.
“I would appreciate it if you told no one about tonight.” The angel tilted its head ever so slightly. “Though, who am I to stop you?”
“Dean?” Castiel’s low voice pulled him from his thoughts. He didn’t know when Cas’s thumb had started tracing small circles on the back of his hand, but he welcomed it all the same.
Or maybe Castiel had gotten his message clear as day, but he just simply hadn’t cared. He went over the prayer in his head, trying to see if he’d said anything wrong. Obviously pushing to the back of his mind, the considerations that had haunted him a few nights earlier, he focused on the prayer, the honest to god, “amen” and all prayer.
He got to the cabin in record time, maybe disregarding road safety a little too much for the usual care he took with his car, but he wouldn’t be able to hold on too long before he felt like the adrenaline would wear off and he’d just be a puddle of pathetic seeping through the driver's seat. The cabin wasn’t that far away, anyway, and the road was pretty empty. He’d gotten weird looks from the guards by the wall (usually the hunters came in looking like hell, not the other way around) but other than that, he didn’t see anyone.
“You don’t trust me enough to leave me alone with your brother, yet you do trust me to heal him?” Castiel's tone was somewhat impatient.
“Okay,” Dean stated, simply. “Okay.” He repeated, grounding himself. Jo had found the mole, but even worse the mole wasn't human.
Dean thought as he dropped what he was doing and stood upright, just waiting for his father to turn the corner and find him there in the kitchen. This was about to be a major shitshow and Dean wished he’d left earlier.
be pleased with something that would make you suffer.” His voice got caught between the words, and he thought about the minutes where he thought Cas was gone.
This is also where I have been posting previews of the new chapters every Sunday, and I'm writing some short prompts so feel free to submit ideas!
“What’s a pickup line?” The idea of having to explain to him what a pick-up line was, and why he’d just used it on him sent mixed signals into his hazy brain.
to die. And I’ve lived far longer than I can even begin to tell you, so, it might as well be me, if it means doing
Steve clearly felt it too, he said a quick goodbye before turning around and leaving them to their training.
When he felt like the fire had gone out, and every breath he took didn’t feel like a stab in the chest, he slowly lifted his head, searching for Cas’s eyes. He found them just below his, staring back up at him. Cas was kneeling on the floor in front of him, his expression wasn’t worried anymore, even though now would be the time Dean would expect it to be, instead, it was calm, and he could even go as far as saying he could see a small smile drawn in his lips.
is what I do. I know what I’m doing, so why are you so adamant about doubting my every move?” Cas was hissing at him, in a high whisper, always looking over his shoulder. “Don’t you trust me?”
, he always had playing at night (it actually creeped the hell out of Dean, but it’s not like he would tell his brother).
“Wait if I'm dreaming, that means- why the hell are you in my head?” Dean panicked, what if Cas was able to read his thoughts while they were in his dream. What if he was able to hear that Dean couldn’t stop thinking about the way Castiel had healed him or worse what if he knew about that one-time in-
“You’re right. On the other hand, though, the dude’s aim is to do just that, so what’s the difference?” Sam scratched the back of his neck. It was a nervous tick, he always used to do it when he was anxious as a kid. Well, now would, in fact, be the time to be anxious.
“It’s just an expression Cas, you’re gonna like it, just take my word for it.” He made his way into the kitchen to look at a depressingly scarce pantry.
No matter how much Dean wanted to deny it, the truth was that he was hoping to run into Cas at the cabin. Hoping he would get there and Cas would just be standing there, note in hand, smiling at him, that head tilt of his when Dean walked through the door. He’d tell himself that he just wanted to know that the angel was safe from all the bloodthirsty hunters out there, but deep down he knew he also wanted to spend more time with him, to just hang around and pretend the world wasn’t coming down all around them.
“Does that mean we will go back to the way it was?” Castiel finally asked and Dean couldn’t help but look back up at him, to see if his expression had changed, it hadn’t.
“I remember seeing a bright light after every time I was badly injured and then waking up perfectly fine apart from my memory. I saw the same light when you were healing Sam. I mean I was just guessing before, but it really was you, wasn’t it?”
If John Winchester felt surprised, he didn’t show it. Instead, he put down the knife and used an old rag to clean the blood off his hands.
There was another rustling sound, this time coming from his left. He turned around to find himself standing face to face with werewolves.
Dean took a deep breath, there was only one option he could think of and he didn’t exactly like it, and that was an understatement. He took a deep breath and pushed away the nagging thoughts in his brain.
The noodles weren't half bad, especially for a first try, but he made a mental note to make Cas his version of these noodles. Nevertheless, he ate the whole thing in record time, he even finished the broth that was left when all the noodles were gone, slurping loudly. He made sure to make an exaggerated satisfied sound when he was done, so Cas would be sure he enjoyed it.
“I just thought I’d let you know, because you saved me and all. The whole an eye for an eye thing,” Dean couldn’t look at the angel as he spoke.
“There’s plenty of people to worry about those kinds of things,” Bobby was as calm as ever. Unlike his dad, Bobby was never one to start an argument, well not with Dean anyway.
“Ah, good, I was afraid something was about to go right for a minute.” Dean raised his eyebrows to his hairline, “couldn’t have that now, could we.”
He had forgotten about the dream by the time he got downstairs. Sam was still asleep and Dean didn’t want to push his luck so he decided he would stop at Ellen’s for breakfast. The longer he stayed the bigger the chance that he would run into Sam and all the other questions that were definitely brewing in that big head of his.
“My brother has been following our leader and he appears to visit the same building in Welldale frequently, we figured he’s hiding something in there.”
“And you can see them? Right now?” Dean asked, a bit incredulous, as he looked up at the stars. They were beautiful, no doubt about it, but they just seemed so randomly placed to him.
“Where the hell did you go?” Dean shouted as soon as their eyes locked, he stood still in the doorframe.
Being stuck inside the smallest closet in the world, with the angel he’d drunkenly kissed and who’d outright rejected him, was the last thing he thought he’d been doing on a rainy December Thursday, or any Thursday really.
“Yeah that’s the one, now could we please shut up about him?” Dean took an angry bite out of the pie. If it wasn’t so good he’d probably not have this conversation extending so much.
why was it that whenever Cas was around he seemed to fail at the most basic of human functions? He was never like this - he was Dean freaking Winchester, he was born flirting with the nurses, or so legend has it -so
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean didn’t really know what that was, he would have considered them friends before he had stupidly tried to kiss him, and even if he would try his best take it back, it was out there, that he’d done it, that he’d wanted to do it, and hell that if given the chance he probably would do it again. As much as he wanted to attribute his pass at Cas to alcohol, and that’s the story he was sticking to, he knew damn well that it was more than that.
So he liked Cas being his friend, of course, he knew there was more that he liked about Cas, and every so often the lines between friendship and wherever else there may be, got kind of blurry, especially when he drank, or when Cas touched him and it sent three million jolts of electricity through his body, or when Cas told him about the stars, and apparently when Cas cooked for him…
He ran as fast as his legs would allow him to, creating as much distance as his body would allow him, between him and Bobby’s house. Luckily it was in the outskirts of the city. He didn’t care that his lungs were screaming with ache and that his heart was beating so fast he felt like it might explode. He had to find Cas, right now, he had to know that he was okay. He was nearing the wall, he could see the iron gate now. Just a little further, he thought. A little voice in his head told him to keep running, to not look behind, in the case any hunter tried to stop him.
“I can tell you’re lying, son. Hell, I taught you how.” John raised his hand in Dean’s general direction, only to slam it back down on the kitchen table, the sound startling him, even if he tried to hide it.  “So I’m asking you again, where are you going?”
“What?” the question startled him out of his thoughts, and how was it nearly Christmas already? The TV played a crappy hallmark movie as background noise, he hadn’t bothered to turn it off after he’d finished Die Hard for the seventh time in two days. His mouth was full of a half-eaten baloney sandwich, and a huge chunk fell into his lap when he opened his mouth to answer Sam.
Part of him felt bad for leaving Sam alone all day, but knowing his little brother he would probably spend the day at Ellen’s anyway. He briefly considered going over to The Roadhouse to kill some time at the bar, but nearly everyone in the city had caught wind of his run-in with the werewolves and they were all buzzing to ask questions. The thought of having to keep retelling the lie he had been telling his brother and father made him feel sick.
“So Curt,” Dean started, not really knowing where to take his first question, or whether this guy would even entertain his meddling. “You’re like a walking and talking angel-encyclopedia, right?”
“Thank you,” He muttered, standing only a few inches away from Dean, who could feel the steam emanating from the body in front of him. Castiel’s eyes studied his, and he tried to match the angel’s stare, but it was proving hard to do - his eyes darting from Cas’s eyes to his mouth, to his neck and then his collarbone, Dean’s lips parted ever so slightly. There was a flash of shiny metal that caught Dean’s eye, he had never seen it around Castiel’s neck before. It appeared to be a simple amulet, from the metal chain dangled a clear crystal. Dean would wonder about it if he wasn’t occupied by
He was just about to dial Sam’s number when a rustling sound behind him made him turn around, his hand automatically reached for his gun.
“Yeah, well…” He wanted to tell Sam his dad had it coming, but then he would definitely have to tell him everything about that night, and for the time being, he just wanted to forget about it.
Sam stared at him, jaw hanging open. “How in the hell did you get caught up in this?” This is where Dean was drawing the line, telling him about Cas and how he was an angel.
Adina glanced over her shoulder, motioning for a low-rank angel to approach, while Gabriel shook his head ‘no’. “Tell Metatron I’ve got Gabriel.” She ordered and the angel flew away before Gabriel could say anything.
“Yeah, it’s called hustling,” Sam laughed. “I can’t believe Lucas fell for that, most people know better than to play any game against you.”
“Yeah, you could say that,” Dean’s mind was racing, how did this tie-up with the events of the warehouse? Dean had been extremely frustrated that they’d come out empty on that one, but he’d have to admit it was his fault, and being stuck in a tight closet with Cas didn’t help, at all. Had he been alone, and focused, he might’ve come to any conclusions.
“You wanna take another shot at me? Are you really up for it?” He risked studying his dad’s expression. It softened enough for Dean to know it was working. “Because I’m good, I can go all night,” he forced a smile, teeth and all, he really had to sell it.
“Yes, Sir,” Dean said. If his dad wasn’t going to tell him more about the angel mission, he would just have to find out for himself.
“Well I don’t care what heaven says, but there’s one thing I know for certain, you’re not leaving until you’ve tried a cheeseburger.” Dean playfully patted the angel on the shoulder and regretted it immediately, as he had to dodge a powerful punch coming his way.
The way he hissed at him clearly surprised Castiel, his mouth opened a little, words forming and then disappearing before he spoke them. Dean figured he would be trying to lie his way out of this.
I had already made my peace with dying. I could die for this, I am a soldier.” His voice broke, and Cas took a step closer to him, still looking like he could just about take a swing at him. “And if I let myself feel this, I’m not sure I can do it anymore. Except now I know you feel it too, and I can’t keep pretending I don’t, I can’t just tell myself you don’t feel it, anymore, because you’re so annoyingly intent on making me know it.” The words left Dean spinning, coming at him left and right, at a speed and tone Dean had never heard on Cas. “I could’ve died loving you.” Cas let his voice drop to a whisper, a reverent tone to it, as if he was in confession. Like it was just a secret to be shared, between the both of them, and the wind. The words hit Dean like the blunt end of a knife, making his chest tight and his lungs burning, it was as if the air had been completely sucked off all around him.
“I’m sure part of that is just because of the way he looks.” Dean tried to calm him. “Like a little, frustrated hobbit.”
Dean tossed and turned, not wanting to open his eyes just yet. He could feel the soft pillow underneath his head and the blanket on top of him was doing a nice job at keeping him warm. For a second he relished in the warmth of the bed- until his brain processed it. His eyes shot open and he sat up, it took him a second to realize where he was. He was in the cabin, he was in the same cabin, the same cabin where he had spent many nights getting away from life at home. The problem was, however, that he didn’t remember getting there in the slightest.
“I’m…Not sure how to answer that.” Castiel sighed, and let his head fall back, looking up at the stars. “A lot more has happened in the last few months, than in the last few millennia.”
After some small talk about Dean’s training today and Bobby’s hunt for a new car, Dean decided it was time to try his luck for a second time today.
“Did you know,” Dean started, in a fun fact kind of voice, “that they don’t really turn on the poles? They do that on their own!” He was positively satisfied with his fact, grinning at Cas, who didn’t seem to enjoy or understand what he was talking about, to Dean’s disappointment. In fact, the angel looked like he wanted to leave the room as soon as possible. It was slightly funny to Dean how he could go from cutthroat and frightening to a lost puppy within seconds.
Dean swallowed, dryly. “Then don’t” he mumbled, as if he could just ask it of Cas, not to fight, not to die. He almost added '
“Freedom," Metatron paused while he lifted his hands and let them flow mid-air in a big gesture. "Is what the humans
They quickly arrived at the closed tall doors that separated them from the room where the meeting was about to start. Much to Castiel’s appeasement, seeing as he could feel the scrutiny in Hael’s eyes, waiting for him to agree with her.
“I don’t know,” Curt shrugged. “My guess is that they will send a small troop to negotiate Michael’s freedom.”
Dean breathing behind him, and Castiel dry swallowed. Memories of that night came rushing back for the umpteenth time, he tried to shrug them away once more. The way their bodies were touching was too much, too close, too soon. Castiel shuffled his feet, uncomfortable, deciding it’d be best for them to just face the door.
“A bubble bath,” Castiel reiterated, seemingly very pleased with his answer the more he thought about it. “Have you tried it?”
Dean just stared at him, blankly. No idea of what to say. There wasn’t a question, so there was nothing for him to say. There was no point in agreeing with him, no joy in hearing the words he had longed so often to hear.
In the rearview mirror, he felt the irony of leaving Cas standing, as he’d left him, so many times, in the exact same spot. And if being the one left standing was painful, leaving certainly felt worse.
Sam just nodded, resigned, and Dean felt a knot form in his gut and knew he couldn’t keep letting this distance set between them, but for the time being, he just continued to wipe down the barrel of the sawed-off shotgun.
The conversation fizzled out, the three of them with sober expressions - there wasn’t much else to talk about.
“If what you say is true, and there is an attack planned, I am the only one who can put a stop to it. Alas, I cannot do it from here.” Michael tilted his head, in search of a glimpse of understanding in Dean’s expression, and when he couldn’t find it, he continued. “You need to help me get out of here.”
Dean didn’t know what to say. And that was saying enough. He wasn’t the type to just have his ass handed to him and swallow his pride, but something told him he might be the one in the wrong here. He’d been so worried about his own feelings, he was afraid he’d hurt someone else.
“The negotiation, they uhm-” His throat felt dry and his heart felt like it was crawling up its way up to his esophagus.
“Enough,” Barnes said sternly. “We have more important matters to tend to than someone’s last name or ridiculous suspicions. An angel was spotted within the perimeters of our land.”
But Castiel couldn’t wait any longer, he turned his body around before Dean could get to ‘three’ and they now found themselves facing each other, this was even worse, Castiel let a hoarse groan escape his lips.
This is also where I have been posting previews of the new chapters every Sunday, so if you want to get a sneak peek of what happens in chapter 12 be sure to keep an eye out for the next one :)
“Castiel,” Metatron called out, at the end of the meeting, while all the other angels had started to make their way out. “Would you be so kind as to indulge me for a few moments in my office?”
Dean grabbed hold of his arm, “Hey, hey, stop that,” he almost had to pry Cas’s fingers away, worry sitting in the pit of his stomach. “I can do it.”
“Are you sure that you’re not just blowing this whole thing out of proportion? Did he tell you he wasn’t up for it or was he just surprised that you kissed him?”
“Well, you better trust him with mine too, if we’re really doing this.” Dean let out a nervous laugh.
Dean scrunched up to a seating position, inspecting his foot, obviously breathing through the pain. “Yeah, just peachy.”
Time seemed to stand still for a moment but then a hot pain ran through his entire right leg, causing him to fall to the ground. Claws were tearing away at his arms and chest and the smell of blood filled the air. He tried to grab his gun but it was no longer within his reach. There was the sound of low growling and Dean faintly recognized it from somewhere.
“Sure, excited is a word for it,” he answered. It really wasn’t, a more accurate word to describe how he felt about the meeting about to take place was
“Look he’s not-” Dean cleared his throat, “-we’re not.” He wanted to explain, wanted his words to actually better the situation, but that wasn’t proving easy to do. Sam just laughed away, watching as Dean made a complete fool of himself.
The image of Castiel’s smile lit up by the luminous blue of his grace was etched into his brain. Every time the scene replayed itself in his mind it made his heartbeat fasten again, and he had to refrain from reaching out to touch Cas.
on sparing everyone we know of a massive bloodbath?” Sam rolled his eyes, dramatically, “Gee Dean, I don’t know, I might sit on this mind-blowing information for a while and wait it out.”
“An angel, Metatron, is the one causing this, he wants the rule of Heaven. With Michael gone, he gets a seat at the table, making the calls.”
Dean followed the direction, squinting his eyes in an attempt to see the so-called ‘greater bear’. There were so many little burning dots above them, but none of them resembled any kind of animal in his opinion.
“You know what I'm asking of you Castiel,” Gabriel started, his tone now somber and telling. For all of his persona, it was easy to forget he was an archangel, one of the first four angels created by God, and even though he’d always renounced any sort of power, they ought to owe him more respect. “It’s time to choose sides.”
They breathed in one another, close as they stood. Dean’s arms slowly falling, fingers tracing every button on the shirt, until coming to rest on the leather belt around Cas’s waist, sliding his fingers back against his skin, folding over the belt, pulling him closer, until nearly every inch of their bodies were touching. Dean found it to be impossible, completely impossible not to give in. Before he could try and reason through his clouded brain, his instinct took over, and in a swift motion his legs managed to stand him upright, and his right arm came up to grab the back of Cas’ head in his hand, fingers grabbing ahold of his hair, pulling slightly, and finally letting his mouth clash with his - Cas’ body seemed to jolt from the sudden move, his arms reacting, shooting up,  hands clinging onto the fabric of Dean’s shirt and the drunk hunter worried for a moment, waiting for a second to see if Cas would push him away, but he was pleased when the angel didn’t.
“Yep. There are things going on inside those walls you have no idea” Sam laughed, taking another sip of his beer. He was right, he bet there were some secrets that were better left like so.
Castiel seemed distracted, looking around the room, opening closet doors and the bathroom door, checking inside. He smiled widely into the bathroom, and then, back at Dean.
The odd pair sauntered towards the Impala as if they needed to stall time, and Dean wondered if he should be the one to speak, but the words felt trapped in his throat and he just kept walking. He wasn’t sure if it was the adrenaline from what they had just witnessed, or just finding himself alone with Cas, under the night sky once again, but he felt like he needed to say something, anything. He didn’t like this silence between them, and he hated that he’d been the cause of it.
“Is that why you wanted to talk to me?” Castiel’s face carried an expression that Dean couldn’t quite read, was it relief?
Once again he found himself the butt of a bad joke, an angel and a hunter, natural foes, stuck together in a broom closet with barely enough space to breathe.
The bar was pretty packed for a Tuesday night, but they caught a free table by the back door and Dean asked Jo for a beer.
After his training, he made his way over to the armory, where he knew his dad would be. Every time that his dad had an important meeting he would make a habit out of cleaning his weapons, Dean guessed it was a nervous tick.
“Gabriel has an idea of what the prophecy is about - if Metatron were to be equated to the false God the prophecy claims, that would make Michael’s era as ruler of Heaven what was forgotten, which should rise again,” Castiel spoke slowly and paused to check if Dean was following. He still looked lost in thought, and Castiel was sure it was way ahead of what he was explaining, Dean was far more intelligent than he gave himself credit for.
“What the hell man, where have you been?” Sam’s face carried that look of sleepy and confused that Dean would normally make fun of, but not tonight when there was no time for cracking jokes and poking fun. There wasn’t even time to convince Sam that everything was fine. Nothing was fine, and Sam would find that out in less time than he even realized.
And then there was Dean Winchester, the human that Metatron had undoubtedly been referring to during their conversation. The very mention of his name seemed to rustle his feathers. Just the lingering idea of him was enough to send him into a spiraling wave of self-doubt and vacillation. In the long, long list of things that were wrong, but felt right, or things that are right but feel wrong, Dean Winchester and the way he made him
“Dean, I didn’t spend all this time trying to protect you just for you to get yourself caught in the crossfire.” Cas’s tone was annoyingly calm like he couldn’t care less about throwing away the whole friendship they had spent so much time building.
They spent the entire movie bickering about the logistics of the plot. At least his younger brother was eating something, it appeared to be some leftover chicken casserole that Ellen had made. They both laughed when a bad infomercial tried to convert them to believe in God and his mighty angels during one of the breaks. For the first time in months, Dean felt content.
“It’s a flower,” Cas said, and Gabriel still looked absolutely lost so he explained before continuing, “You remember the warehouse I told you about? With the empty boxes by the time we got there, and that smell I couldn’t place?”
He wasn’t focused, he wasn’t detached like he was supposed to be, he wasn’t, at all, selfless, in fact, he was one of the most selfish angels to ever roam Heaven and Earth. He had always been intrigued by humans, by their customs and their own ways, living around their inescapable mortality, yes, he had always been captured by humanity, but now he
He’d almost forgotten Cas was actually still standing there, witnessing his entire pathetic breakdown, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. In that moment, between breaths, he felt a hand coming to rest on his arm, not applying a lot of pressure, not pulling him anywhere, just holding on to him. Seconds felt like minutes until Dean’s breath started easing and following a rhythm he was just now noticing. Cas was breathing with him, still and steady. In through the nose and out through the mouth.
?” she asked, cracking open her own beer. “And I mean really, not the crap you give Sam to get him to lay off.”
When he woke up, it was already dark in the cabin, and Dean figured he must have been asleep for at least a few hours. The room felt warm and Cas looked like he hadn’t moved an inch in the time Dean was asleep, his legs still resting on the angel’s lap. He heard the familiar sound of crackling and realized where the warm glow was coming from, the fireplace was lit. Flames high and the logs already turning to ash in the bottom, which meant that somewhere along the day, Castiel had gotten up, and sat back down carefully placing Dean’s legs on his lap again. Dean’s cheeks turned a pinkish hue that he tried to hide before Cas could see he was awake. He lay like that, eyes closed and all for another few minutes.
“It’s not like you tell her much about your stuff either,” Sam teased him “Hell, you don’t tell me much either these days”
The room was cold, as the heat from the fireplace didn’t get through this door. It wasn’t very dark since there were no blinds in front of the window, only some shitty curtains, so nothing to cover the shadows from the trees and the way the moonlight danced around on the wall in front of him, an eerie sight, and the forest noises were creepy enough that he got back up to get his mp3. It was the same one he’d filled up all throughout high school, and even though he didn’t even like some of the songs anymore, it was his most prized possession (aside from his car, and his gun, and the necklace Sam had given him - ok so maybe it wasn’t his most prized possession, but still, it was
Joshua scoffed, getting progressively exasperated, “And still, brother, I wonder, who was it that named you his successor? Why must this burden fall upon you?” He spoke, trying to play along with Metatron’s storyline. “When, we all know, you much prefer the quiet of heaven and your writing? I’m sure you would be of much better use documenting the war to come, rather than standing with us to fight.”
“That doesn’t sound like a great strategy, especially for angels. Wait until we’re done with your leader?” C. Barnes scoffed, "Let's hear it then, what is your pitch? You must have one, if you’re done waiting.” The hunter spoke confidently because even though he appeared alone, he knew others stood with him.
“I couldn’t help but notice that you seem okay.” A pause. The words were stubborn, not wanting to get out. His voice hitched in his throat. “That means you don’t need me to stay here anymore.” Castiel tried hiding the sadness that laced his statement, he didn’t want Dean to feel bad for sending him away, they were gonna have to go back to normal sooner or later anyway.
“Yeah, no can do.” Fuck. He might as well tell Sam now, he was bound to find out soon enough anyway. “He can’t get through the walls...” He hoped he didn’t have to spell it out.
- it was like an exhilarating thunderstorm - and whether it was just in his head or if Dean heard it too, it didn’t make it any less real.
Dean picked up his bag and considered staying in the Echo zone until he knew his dad would be away from home. But that meant running into more hunters on the training field and he had just successfully managed to evade Garth, a hunter with a tendency to talk way too much.
And whether it was plain tiredness or lack of patience to deal with his son, or just accepting the mystery woman he was supposedly hanging with would not have followed them to this backward ass town Dean didn’t know, but John nodded in agreement.
He was almost done when he heard a sound down the hallway. For a moment Dean thought about running back to hide but decided against it, there wasn’t enough time. He focused back on the lock and with one final wrist-flicking motion, it finally opened. Quickly pulling the door open, he stepped inside, closing it behind him, as to not raise suspicions.
Castiel turned to look at him, there was an expression on his face that Dean couldn’t quite place, but then it was quickly replaced by a smile.
The angel looked at him with what looked like pity, but there was also something else in his eyes, was it praise, empathy? Maybe Dean was imagining it, for all he knew Cas could think he was crazy for saying these things.
All he knew was that whatever he decided to do, the answer to Cas’s unnecessarily enigmatic last words, had to be waiting for him at the command center, so that was where he was headed.
“You see that?” Dean reached his arm out, pointing, and Cas followed, his eyes squinting to see in the dark. There were four trucks he could see, completely blank, no markings on them whatsoever, and a few men hung around outside, talking with one another. The door of the warehouse was half-opened but he couldn’t see much besides that.
"What you're seeing is a memory, if you will. It's what your city once looked like before the humans settled here."
The bar was familiar enough. Dean was pretty sure he’d been before. Hell, he wasn’t sure where he was, he’d just kept driving past the walls - he just needed to have some distance between him and his world.
Dean apologized, but Cas didn’t respond, he pushed them behind some thick trees, well at least they were somewhat hidden.
His nerves had already taken a hell of a beating today, figuratively, and now here they were, doing a goddamn backflip again. But this time, it wasn’t fear or adrenaline pumping, it was just the regular Cas-induced panic that set in the pit of his stomach, apparently, it was still noticeable even over all his actual physical wounds.
“Right,” she took a breath. “Remember how my mom and Bobby kept fighting over him being a paranoid son of a bitch?” She waited for Dean’s nod before continuing. “Well, I like Bobby, you know? The house hasn't felt so full in a very long time, and I just like having him around, he makes my mom happy-”
you.” Realization set upon him. This had to be what Cas was referring to, that night, all those years ago, he slipped on the ice and hit his head, only to wake up in his bed without much of a scratch.
She walked over to them, “I’m just grabbing a few things from the store, The Roadhouse was running low on pickles,”  she answered.
“Oh you know, they’re good for each other, but my mom can’t stand it when Bobby’s so suspicious of everyone. Kinda worries me, you know, because I think they are really happy together.” She sighed. “He’s the closest I have to a father, and now that they’re making up for lost time, they should be better than ever, but at this rate, I’m not sure mom’s going to take it much longer.”
Dean had just taken a big gulp of coffee, which proved to be a bad idea. He nearly choked on the hot liquid, it earned him weird looks from Sam and Bobby.
They slowed. Their lips moved in a sort of ballad, like the waves, rising, before the sand took them in. It was going to end, Dean knew, they couldn’t kiss forever, but he wasn’t ready to let go just yet. And then, he felt Cas’s lips stop moving, drawing a smile against his, making it just a little easier to do it.
The knife sank deep into the angel’s stomach, the skin tore apart around the blade, and what Metatron could only qualify as a satisfying scream escaped from Joshua’s mouth, his eyes widening, vexed with the betrayal, unable to do anything but let the pain wash over him.
“Okay.” Cas was so close now, that Dean felt the words more than he heard them. Felt Cas’s breath against his chin, feeling goosebumps down his shoulders, settling in the small of his back. They were too close for him to even thoroughly process what Cas’s agreement could mean.
Cas nodded in agreement before fully processing what he’d heard. “What do you mean a guy like you?” The way Cas looked at him, felt as though he was staring straight into his soul. A mixture of wanting to bury his head in the sand, and of wanting to just stay there, allowing himself to be seen, conflicted with his drunken mind.
and suddenly almost all of the weight of the last few hours left Dean’s shoulders, and he felt like it was okay to smile back.
The time for reasoning and arguing with his dad was long past them. Dean pulled his arm back and punched as hard as he could, his fist hitting John’s cheek, but it hit too far up and he completely missed the jaw, which could have knocked him out in one go. His knuckle burned in pain, and before he could pull his arm back again, a tremendous wave of pain spread through his thigh as his father’s boot crashed into his leg. Dean lost his balance and immediately John was atop of him, slamming his fists down, one after the other, not a moment’s worth of hesitation while he beat his firstborn’s face into a bloody pulp.
“Do you want to take a shower?” Castiel’s voice was soft and gentle as if he was afraid that a loud sound might startle him.
As the waitress nodded, walking back to the counter, Dean’s attention was immediately drawn back to the celestial being who sloppily ate his first ever cheeseburger. It was almost like watching a child experiencing the snow for the first time, Dean couldn’t resist the smile that crept up on his face.
“I’m an angel, not an idiot, Dean, I’m sure I can figure it out.” He had that look on his face, that stubbornness Dean had gotten used to by now, making it clear he’d do just fine by himself. So Dean watched attentively as Cas grabbed the packet of chicken noodles and started carefully reading the instructions written on the back. He watched as the angel grabbed a pot and filled it with water, placing it over the stovetop, and he watched as the angel cursed under his breath because he couldn’t get it to turn on. Cas looked back at Dean with an expression that made him want to burst out into laughter, he actually would have if his face didn’t hurt to move.
Before Dean had time to process anything, let alone answer him, he just stared at his old man’s back as he walked away from them both, slamming the front door on the way out.
Dean briefly wondered if this was what he witnessed at the warehouse, if that was the reason for his father talking to an angel instead of running him through, not that it would do much since no weapon that he knew of could actually kill an angel.
The entire room made it very clear that Dean was the only one who came here frequently, from an unfinished coffee in a disposable cup, to a few of his weapons spread out on the table next to a few books that Dean had mentioned during their conversations.
“Ah,” Dean had no idea what to say to that, because what the fuck do you tell someone after they’ve just told you that the guy you’ve been digging only mates for life, if at all? He took another sip of beer, hoping it would pass as a somewhat decent excuse for his silence.
The archangel Michael was surrounded by large stains of blood, both old and new. His head slumped against his chest, curls matted with blood-covered parts of his face.
Dean knew he was right. They’d always been there for each other, he could always count on Sam. But this was different, he was trying to protect him from the thing he wanted to tell him about. “Yeah,” he sighed, putting the gun down for a second, eyes locking with Sam’s. “I just -” maybe he could tell him something, leave out the angel part. But what would he tell him? The inside of his head was a mess, he couldn’t even tell himself anything coherent, let alone share it with his brother “- I can’t Sammy, I wish I could, but right now I can’t.” He gave him an earnest look from across the room and hoped to God that Sam would understand.
“Who’s he talking about now?” Dean asked Sam in a low voice, not wanting anyone else to notice he had been paying absolutely zero attention to them. “The new guard at the command center?”
The next night Dean had gone to the cabin again, hoping to have a note from Cas. If worry could kill Dean was sure he was an empty book away from a massive coronary. And then what? If there was nothing, there was nothing he could do. It wasn’t like he could call the cops, or search for him all over the world. Dean had no clue where Cas was when he wasn’t with him, or with whom. A knot twisted in his gut.
“That’s why you sounded so distressed?” Cas frowned and Dean would almost swear he was incredulous. “Because you thought I was amongst the angels who got killed in the negotiation?”
A sharp flash of sudden, shocking pain shot through Dean’s shin and upper thigh. It felt as if someone or something was tearing his right leg apart. He tried to scream but nothing came out, it was as if his body wasn’t his to control anymore. There was a radiant flash of light and then a strange pressure on his stomach. Slowly a warm feeling started spreading through his entire body like melting honey.
Dean had no clue as to what the higher-ranked hunters had planned to do with Michael. His father was part of the core team in the command center but obviously, he refused to tell Dean anything.
“Sounds good to me, in the meantime, I’m starving,” Dean looked down at his painfully growling stomach. “They have some of the best bacon cheeseburgers in this town, so if you need me, you’ll know where to find me.”
“They’re beautiful,” Dean said before he could stop himself. He quickly directed his gaze upon the lake, but he was sure he saw a slight blush on Castiel’s face.
Voices rose from every corner, some louder than others, some unintelligible, some angry, and some just plain sad.
There was another sentence written on the paper, but it had been completely crossed out so it was impossible to read, Castiel wondered briefly what other important information Dean had meant to write on the note. He tucked the note back into the book, not wanting to risk carrying the note into Heaven later.
Commander James Barnes was a decent man. In his late forties, he’d had a busier life than most. Son of James Barnes Senior, founder and first leader of the City, he’d spent most of his childhood in the suburbs, an apple-pie type of life, until the angel attack that killed his siblings and sent his father into survival mode. Like many others in the same situation, Barnes Sr. was looking for protection, to have his last child grow up safe and sound. That's when he gathered people from around the country, some hunters, some just victims to the tragedy, and built the first walls, building an entire city protected from the outside world.
“Dean-” Castiel sighed, tilting his head slightly, eyes on Dean’s like life-saving buoys, something for him to hang on to. “I never meant for this to happen. When Michael gave me the assignment to look out for your city I wasn’t supposed to interfere with anything, let alone become
Castiel’s face flushed and a hand shot up to rub his neck, Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen the angel look more human.
That night another memory crept up in Dean's dreams without warning. It wasn't the first time that this particular memory made it into his dreams. Ever since it happened ten years ago. But he had never told anyone, he was afraid of how they might look at him when he would tell them something so unbelievable, that if it wasn't for the small scar, he himself would have thought it never actually happened.
Dean was taken aback by the suggestion, laughing semi-nervously at the whole euphemism. He pondered it for a minute. Wondered if that would even work. For some reason, he didn’t think so, and worse than that, he was definitely sure he didn’t even want to try.
doing the right thing, but doing the right thing had never looked like defying orders before, so his every instinct kept telling him that something was wrong, that he was straying from the righteous path. He had to keep setting himself on the right path, remembering Gabriel’s words ‘
But it didn’t mean that the angel couldn’t be lying about some things, he knew his dad wouldn’t betray his family that easily, would he?
Dean shrugged, he’d never really given Michael’s capabilities much thought before. Sure, when he’d met him the angel looked like he’d seen his fair share of dark shit, but most powerful?
The hours Sam and Jo spent in the cabin with Dean flew by as they brainstormed how to get Michael’s grace from John. They didn’t even know if he had it on him, or if he’d stashed it away somewhere else. One thing they knew for certain, there was only one person that could help them.
In the meantime Sam had taken the pizzas out of the oven and they ate in silence for a while. Dean was debating what to tell Jo.
. Not even with Sammy, not even with Bobby. They all knew of course, but they would just patch him up and give him a pat on the back. Sam would get furious about it some days, yelling and promising to step in between them the next time, but Dean didn’t want him to. Whenever Sam did step a toe out of line, John had no problem putting him in his place too, but Dean would never let their dad close enough to hit Sam.
Dean could feel the way the cold bricks pressed against his back as Cas withdrew his arm from the base of Dean’s throat. For a second the angel seemed to collect himself, taking a step back, allowing Dean to stand on both feet, regaining his balance. Castiel’s eyes, however, still carried the same hint of hurt in them as when Dean first accused him.
“Wait, why are you showing me this?” Dean had been so fascinated by the sight in front of him that he hadn’t questioned the reason behind the angel’s little rendition of Outlander.
This seemed to be enough to keep Sam’s questions at bay and have him tell some version of the truth to Bobby.
When they made their way back to the cabin, Castiel wondered if Dean would want him to sleep next to him again. He tried to suppress the longing inside, the little voice in the back of his mind that insisted that he
When he reached the car, he looked at Cas, hoping he would get the message to just get in. Thankfully, he did, apparently, the angel was getting better at picking up social cues.
Not even three minutes had passed when the door flung open, and for a (very irrational) second Dean thought John might have come back to finish the job, but of course, it wasn’t him.
Dean didn’t want to lead anyone either. Much less a band of raging hunters, most of them older than he was even sure he’d live to be, all looking for a fight, and armed to their teeth for it. Still, he had to play his part, and Cas had to play his -
His heart was pounding six ways out of his chest, between the impromptu love declaration and the notion that he might just die in a matter of seconds.
“Nothing” Castiel started to lay down the sofa, promptly followed by Dean, as he tried to clean his fingers on the fabric, fidgeting with it awkwardly hoping that the eyes that seemed to always be cautiously controlling him would not make note of it.
“Yes, angels are far more interesting creatures,” Curt seemed to grimace at the taste of the beer, and Dean couldn’t help but wonder if he had ever met anyone in the same field of work who didn’t like beer, but made no note of that. He could tell this dude liked to talk, and maybe he could make use of that. After all, he’d been wanting to know more about angels, but John was making it damn near impossible, and besides what he could ask Cas, there was really no one to ask… Except maybe the angel specialist who sat across from him.
“A spaghetti noodle?” Dean could see Cas’s expression, the longer he kept his eyes on him, getting used to the dark, and it was all over his face, he had no idea what Dean was talking about, which, as usual, he found adorable.
“I’m not sure exactly.” There was something about talking like this, under the cover of darkness, in these hours that felt completely separate from life outside, that made everything much easier to just be honest. Dean felt calm and steady, eyes closed and body limp, every question had an answer and every answer would be true. He wondered, for a second, if Cas felt the same, or if this was a purely human sensation, directly connected to being tired and half asleep.
Their victory was celebrated by the every hunter, who came together at Harvelle’s Roadhouse. The Roadhouse was a crowded bar, full of smoke and dimmed lighting but to most hunters, it was like home. And while most of the hunters were celebrating, a disagreement took place at the same time.
The memory faded as a hand tapped on Dean's left shoulder. It was his aunt, Ellen, telling him to help her out at the bar. He knew she was doing this to distract him from what had just happened, he also knew that there wasn’t a chance in hell he could refuse her order. So he walked over to the bar, cursing under his breath until he received a death glare from Ellen. Dean quickly occupied himself with pouring beers for his fellow hunters.
“Sure,” the hunter winked casually. Castiel raised his eyebrows, he was a soldier of Heaven, a warrior of God, respected leader and slayer of many enemies since before the beginning of time, and here was a hunter, born a half-second ago, ridiculing him - and taking
“Right, yes. We have important issues to talk about. It was about time we met.” Gabriel sauntered across the room and leaned on the kitchen counter, picking up a cup of coffee and smelling it, grimacing as it hit his nose.
Dean let out a laugh so harsh and hollow it sounded weird even to his own ears. “You really don’t get it, do you?”
He could feel himself getting swallowed whole by a wave of anger and pain, and he found himself gasping for air, gut-wrenching sobs begging to tear through his chest, but he just forced them down. It became harder to breathe, and in the corners of his eyes, he saw white, his head feeling lighter and heavy as a brick at the same time.  He let his head fall onto his knees, grabbing the back of his neck. He closed his eyes, trying to get a hold of himself, but was out of his control - his breath was shallow and too fast to properly get the oxygen to his brain, and everything was cloudy. He wanted to be mad, to feel angry again, but he was just emptied out and hollow, beneath all of the storms that raged on the outside.
“I know.” Dean could feel himself grow just a little compassionate towards the angel, and that was in no fucking way acceptable.
“Go!” Cas shouted at him. Dean’s blood was starting to boil, anger bubbling to the surface. He went against his every instinct and walked the opposite way from where he was supposed to be running toward. “Go, Dean!” Cas repeated as if saying it in a lower, raspier voice would make Dean more obedient.
Moments later Dean was sitting on the couch, his head hung back to rest on the back of the couch, his eyes staring at the ceiling, he just needed to take a breather. Cas had started pacing around the cabin. All the while he kept a nervous eye on Dean like he would fall apart again at any moment.
Cas didn’t seem phased by Dean’s realization, not even a change in pace. It was like he didn’t even hear him.
John walked through the door, dropping his bag on the floor next to the couch, and greeted his kids. He seemed to be in a good mood, and Dean felt a wave of relief wash over him as he couldn’t deal with yet another fight.
He could identify one of them as a hunter, commander Barnes, and he was talking to a man he’d never seen before. Dean’s heart dropped as soon as the third man turned around, his eyes blinking rapidly as if trying to process what he was seeing faster, because John Winchester was standing next to them. What the hell was his dad doing there? His heart raced and over the million things that should be on his mind, one kept popping up, insistently - his dad and Cas in the same place - and he, warily, nudged Cas to get down and hide better.
“Dean, you’re home” John stepped into the kitchen and his face was a perfect reflection of his anger, and Dean thought about leading them into the living room, away from the kitchen filled with sharp objects.
“You have some nerve, everything I do is to make sure this family is safe and provided for, I work my ass off so that you and Sammy get to have a chance at life. You don’t see me running around with some skank outside the walls, we prioritize family in this house, you of all people should understand that after what happened to your mom, or have you moved past this already?”
“I don’t expect you to believe me, Dean. You see, I have been around long before humans were even considered, I have watched you grow, I watched you evolve and I have stood idly by as you slaughtered one another in cold blood. So if you want to feel special and misunderstood go right ahead, but do not for one second think that I don’t know everything there is to you.” Michael spoke the words as if they were foul, but he never lost his temper.
“So, if you could do me a solid, and stop trying to get yourself killed, that would be great!” The sarcasm dripped from his voice, and he knew he was a little louder than he was supposed to, when hiding out behind a tree, hoping celestial creatures wouldn’t find him. But Cas was driving him insane, it was like he was begging to die and leave Dean to deal with this pile of flaming shit they’d gotten themselves into.
Cas shook his head, in disbelief, his eyes squinting, head slightly tilting and a voice rose, as loud as Dean had ever heard him. “You think I haven’t put myself at risk by saving you? All the times you got yourself hurt and I had to heal you, and what about helping your brother when you asked me to? What do you think that Heaven will do to me when they realize I’ve been sharing their secrets with a human, even worse, with a
A deep-seated gloominess set camp in the back of Dean’s stomach. He tried to ignore it, to make it go away with food. His specialty noodles were heating on the stove, in probably more quantity than he could eat, just in case Cas would come back sooner rather than later. The feeling turned into an actual stomach ache when Cas didn’t come back, and Dean had to eat all of it on his own.
If there was ever a moment where Dean wanted the earth to swallow him whole this was it. He looked around, to Sam, begging him to say something, do anything really just to distract from this conversation, but his brother just looked right back at him, eyes boggled as if to say
He hadn’t meant for this to happen, but Dean was completely inebriated and, yet, incredibly persuasive - the way he touched him, the way he’d grabbed on to him almost let him forget how poorly he knew Dean thought of angels, how this man who stood before him now, completely soft and tender, smile smitten across his face, standing so close, leaning so hard, would never do this if he was sober. He knew this and understood it was his job to not let him do something he was certainly going to regret later, and still, he couldn’t force himself to back away.
Cas rolled his eyes, looking annoyed. “I wouldn’t have thought you knew the ending of the proverb, it dates back to the witch trials and there’s barely any mention of the whole proverb.”
Jo and Sam gathered their things and made their way to the door, promising to call when they knew more.
“Oh, did he not tell you? We are getting rather close, you see, with the amount of time we spend together.” The way Michael spoke, softly and slow, left Dean uneasy. “And he has told me all about his favorite soldier boy -
“I’m afraid I can’t let you leave Gabriel.” Adina’s tone was no longer contrite, instead laced with poignant warning.
He settled on jeans, a white shirt, and his old leather jacket. Cas could wear one of the flannel shirts he had brought and voila; hunter approved.
“I don’t think spaghetti is meant to be eaten as these shells, and it’s not my fault, you haven’t given me the proper cutlery!” The more he fussed, the more Dean laughed, thoroughly enjoying the moment.
“It’s Amy,” the waitress smirked at Dean. “So you’re okay?” She looked over her shoulder at a grouchy-looking dude, probably her boss, and figured she needed to focus her attention back on her work.
“This isn’t a movie Cas, no need for suspense! What is it?” Dean was being impatient, he was aware, and Cas’s pause probably had more to do with the weight of what he was about to say than with building suspense.
Sam was waiting on him by the door, his face carried the exact expression Dean had pictured through the phone. Sam hugged him carefully before sitting him down on the couch while Dean tried his hardest not to wince.
In that time, he felt content, relieved to have Cas safe and sound sitting there, so close to him. For the first time in days, he was able to feel relaxed, maybe even more so than he ever did on his own bed. He was still lying comfortably on his back, the heat from Cas’s body warming his feet, and that’s when he noticed it. Cas’s fingers danced along his ankle, distractedly drawing lines up his leg, light as a feather, it was strangely soothing. He was lucky Dean wasn’t ticklish, or he would’ve received a kick in the chin by now, he was also lucky Dean was enjoying it a little more than he should be, so much more, in fact, that he kept his eyes closed, just so Cas wouldn’t stop.
The room around them was still dark, but between their bodies, the amulet was creating a glowing source of light. The blue light reflected in Dean’s eyes, which finally shot up to meet his own, but he found no hate in them, no fear.
“Well after that, I went back and asked around in the club. With some persuasion, the bartender was kind enough to show me where Curt had been." Dean made a face and Jo rolled her eyes, "I meant money you pervert. Anyway he said that Curt has been a regular, that he's been going there for the past few months. When he left me to search the room, I found a locker with his normal clothes and this whole file on the city.” Jo pursed her lips. “Plans, wardings, weapons, it was pretty shady.”
“If I can just get this to--” Cas tried to explain, as he finger painted the tree in his own blood, “--it’s supposed to ward us off, at least for a few minutes.” That would be a good idea if it wasn’t such a terrible idea. There wasn’t time.
“I’ve always been interested in learning more about angels, my dad is completely against it, of course.” He tried, and when Curt’s smile widened, continued, “I was wondering, do you think everything we learn in school about angels is accurate?”
"What happened?" Sam questioned, and Bobby’s face made it clear he wasn’t supposed to tell them. Dean was about to intervene and pressure Bobby to do so, but the old man folded before he had to.
Castiel couldn’t deny that Metatron was a charismatic leader, strong-willed and clever. Maybe too clever for his own good. He knew there were angels who would follow him, so long as he kept this holier-than-that persona. There had been times where even Castiel fell deceived at his words - the way he would talk about humanity, and their mission, and the way he spoke of their father, it was easy enough to believe him. It was certainly easier, he understood, to stand with Metatron than it was to rebel against him. And yet, that did not make it right.
Castiel took a deep breath, centering himself, they would be here any second now, waiting for their words, and he had to pull himself together, no one could see him like this, unraveled. He had to put up the front of a capable soldier, of the mindful strategist they needed him to be. He needed to stash these earthly thoughts away and focus on his task - the one thing he knew, for sure, how to do properly.
“So you shared a bed, and just slept?” Sam’s voice was dripping with sarcasm, he was having trouble following, which Dean couldn’t even really blame him for - not in his twenty-something years had Dean
It was getting dark outside, the weak January sun already swallowed by dark clouds. There was really no point in staying here, if Cas would visit the cabin there was no telling when. He forced himself onto his feet, ignoring the part of him that wanted to stay and wait. He quickly added a few more words to his latest note, asking Cas to let him know he was okay.
Cas’s voice felt trapped as he heard Dean employ the nickname he’d given him. He’d never allowed many shortenings of his name, it was blasphemous the removal of the ending ‘-iel’, which meant ‘of God’, but on Dean’s lips, he adored it, the way he created this name, just for him, just for the two of them, as if in Dean’s presence he didn’t belong to God, to Heaven, to no one else but to himself, as if right then and there he wasn’t a soldier of Lord, he was just ‘Cas’.
Cas didn’t say anything as he helped Dean take off the leather jacket, tossing it onto the floor behind them with his free hand. Dean’s brow furrowed a little, watching the jacket hit the ground, immediately turning into an intoxicated grin.
This look didn’t suit him, John Winchester rarely let himself slip like this. Like this, Dean could just see the weight of his years, like he was carrying around fifty-so years of built-up stress and bullshit. It was weird seeing him like this, his defense low and his strong demeanor wavering, and Dean didn’t know what to think of it.
Cas nodded, profusely. His brow was still furrowed, looking confused, directly at Dean’s hand around his amulet. “What did you do?”
“I figured you’d be hungry,” Cas held up the takeaway bag in his hand hoping it would diffuse Dean. He didn’t get why Dean was shouting. Had Dean noticed his flustered look while watching the movie? He had tried his best to keep his eyes on the screen and not look at Dean, afraid his eyes would give him away, dark with want. When his hand had reached out towards Dean of its own accord, he knew he had to get out of there. Dean’s sudden need for a shower had been the perfect excuse for him to go out and get some air. “I got us burgers and fries, from the place we went to in Welldale.”
“Then you won’t mind,” Metatron dipped the blade into the bowl in front of him. “If we use your disobedience for a little experiment.”
Getting into the weaponry was the easy part, apparently. The hard part was leaving with the weapons, without being seen.
“Yes,” Cas answered gingerly, and his whole body had visibly tensed up, almost as if he would rather drop the whole thing.
Cas looked at him with uncertainty, but grateful. He waited as Dean took the safety off his handgun and pointed it at the lock. If he couldn’t break it, maybe it would break the warding. They couldn’t see it, but it had to be drawn on, somewhere, right?
He moved around the house quickly, gathering his things - clothes, guns, knives - and tossing them into the duffel bag. He’d go to the cabin and lay low for a few days until his dad would leave for a new hunt. At least he had managed to convince his dad that he’d stopped seeing the ‘girl’ outside the city, and it had bought him at least some of his freedom back. Dean checked his watch, there was still some time before John would get home, so he took the duffel and went down to the kitchen to get something to eat before he would have to get the hell out of dodge.
“Would it be alright if I asked you a somewhat personal question?” Castiel’s voice pulled him back to reality, where he’d lost himself just seconds ago, he didn’t know, perhaps between the lingering gap of their fingers.
that was the guy's name, said, ominously, “you can tell the city is bracing for war against the angels.”
The thought popped into his head before he could catch himself. Part of him wanted to voice it, but he kept quiet. “You did the best you could,” Dean repeated instead.
“Can you still hear them?” Dean asked, there was something in his voice that Castiel couldn’t quite place. Maybe Dean was just as uncomfortable as he was, however, their reasons for being uncomfortable were completely different, he knew that for Dean to stand like this, to feel so trapped with an angel must be unbearable, and for him, it was just excruciating, standing so close, feeling his body pulsing and palpitating with every time Dean’s body moved in the tiniest way, grazing against his, but one thing was certain, they both wanted to get out as fast as possible.
“Guess so.” Dean didn’t hear him speak. He just felt the way his lips moved, and for a second he could pretend they were moving against his own. His heart pounded against the walls of his chest, like a Bonham drum solo, and it was deafening. His eyes darted to Castiel’s lips, as he wet them, slowly, leaving a shining trail behind as if daring Dean to follow his tongue in.
“Yes, it seems you’re all set. You know how to reach me if there’s anything you need until the day comes.” The tall man stated. He definitely wasn’t a hunter - no hunter would wear a suit unless they were undercover, much less an expensive-looking suit like that. Dean wondered what day they could be referring to, and what was all set? They’d found nothing relevant except, apparently, the flowers Cas could smell, and a bunch of empty boxes, the contents of which he was still to figure out.
filled the room. Dean had taken his boxers and jeans from the duffel into the bathroom, in a flash of wits. He was in a particularly good mood, all things considered, and let the music sway him into a half-leg-tappin, half-dancing in the bathroom stupor while he shaved and got himself ready for the day.
“Dean, you hate running.” That was true, and Dean could see Sam’s eye roll, but he wasn’t even lying this time, he had really gone running, well, he tried to - instead, he just ended up sprinting between to trees, just trying to get the imagery of a very wet, very naked Castiel standing
“No,” Dean laughed, why did he laugh?! “Just thought I’d ask if you’ve been going near the city again.”
The simple image of the angel, crossing his mind, had been enough to stir up this familiar, almost intimate warmth that spread through him, flushing his cheeks and heating him all over.
“Yeah, I uh, had a few drinks with him the other day. Sure he’s a bit strange, but he seemed harmless enough.” Dean commented. His eyes darted to John at the mention of that night and felt more at ease when his dad’s expression didn’t even flinch.
) and Dean could lay on his side and just take in the sight. And it was grand. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d woken up to such a gorgeous sight, he’d be damned if he woke Cas up trying to leave. He looked so peaceful, the furrowed brow and harsh expression entirely wiped off. There were no lines creasing, no troubled look heavy on his guise. Dean smothered an impulse to brush his fingers through the disheveled mess that was the dark hair on top of the white pillow, instead, he spent his time memorizing the sight in front of him. There was an unshaven shadow in his cheekbones, his full lips were slightly parted, and his chest was rising with the slow and steady breathing, clearly still in deep slumber.
When Sam finally let him go, Dean couldn’t help himself from saying it. “Take care of yourself, kid.” Then, a nod to Jo, “Take care of each other.”
“The suckers didn’t expect us to have some kick,” Rufus shouted while lifting his beer bottle up in the air.
“Shit Cas, don’t tell me this means what I think it means?” Dean exclaimed, turning to look at Castiel for the first time since Gabriel got here. A combination of panic and wariness painted his gaze. Castiel wanted to reach out for him, to touch him or confront him in some way, but he knew better.
“Listen to me, I work my ass off to protect you” He was shouting at this point, full-on screaming into their faces “
“Okay, Dr. Phil, enough with the therapy.” Dean cleared his throat, looking for a way to steer the conversation in a different direction.
The five remaining angels' expressions turned from horrified to outraged, ready to unleash their anger on the group of hunters.
“Come on man, you’ve been miserable for the past two days, moping around, and when was the last time you took a shower?” Sam’s upper lip lifted in disgust staring at his older brother.
Between the tiredness of his bones, the protruding pang in his leg, and the way his jaw clenched, there was nowhere to let the steam off but the tree in front of him. In a seethe of rage, Dean punched the bark of the tree, all his weight behind it. The pain shot up from his knuckles all up through his arm, grounding him, at least.
A wave of energy blew by him, and Dean understood it had come from where Cas was kneeling. His eyes darted everywhere in search of winged assholes who had been just at their feet, over him, about to take a Winchester out of the game for good.
Dean felt the thumb on his back brushing in small, circular motions against his skin, and he felt himself relax more than he thought was wise, more than he knew he could handle, and so, it wasn’t long before he gave up and allowed his fingers to wander over the exposed skin, aching to touch more of Cas, to know the pathways he could only dream of going through again, and again. He gently traced every inch of Castiel’s stomach starting over his navel and sliding upwards in a slow and steady motion, gliding over his ribs, his finger falling into the crevices where there was no bone, and climbing again where there was, all the way up to his chest. He could feel the angel shiver under his touch, breath heavier than before and he could swear both of their hearts were beating faster, and for a second he wondered if he had gone too far, somehow crossing an unspoken boundary. Reluctantly, he dropped his hand to rest on Cas’s chest, over his heart, feeling it calm down. He really had to stop pretending this was anything more than it was,
“Exactly,” Gabriel smiled. “Beautiful isn’t it? You’d think daddy really put his time into this one but then he also invented threesomes so who am I to guess.” He looked off into the distance for a second as if he was reliving an old memory. “ Anyway, I’ve been informed that you are under direct orders from Metatron.”
The rest of the conversation fell flat pretty quickly when Dean couldn’t think of anything else to add after the information he’d just received. He decided it was best if he didn’t ask any more questions so they drank the rest of their beers in silence. Curt kept making some faces with every big gulp he took.
After that, and when the car was officially his, a whole new set of firsts had taken place - first time he’d driven drunk (big mistake), the first time he’d decided to just leave, and take Sam with him (they’d made it a week before Dean felt bad, and drove them back), the first time he got a sloppy handjob from a guy (in the back alley of a bar) not really inside the impala, but using her for (moral) support; then, the first time he’d broken up with his (only serious) girlfriend, and gotten slapped across the face; the first time he’d actually gotten past third base with a dude, and a whole bunch of times after that too.
