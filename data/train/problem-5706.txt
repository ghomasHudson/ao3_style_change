Steve managed to snag Thor, Clint, and Natasha and talk them into eating with him in the SHIELD mess. Steve watched carefully as he ate, trying to see what he could learn about his new teammates. Thor was clearly disappointed that Loki had escaped, but he put on a good face, smiling warmly at them all. Clint and Natasha were both obviously exhausted, and even Steve was starting to feel the adrenaline wear off. He was interested to watch how casually the two of them shared space – her leg up on his chair, his head on her shoulder, no hesitation in touching each other. He missed that camaraderie and felt a sudden deep ache for Bucky.
The slightest hint of annoyance ran across Natasha’s face. "I thought you said trust went both ways, Rogers."
“Ah, of course. I can see why you wouldn’t want to share that with Fury. He’s hard enough to get information out of as it is. So why does the Avengers’ susceptibility depend on Fury?”
Tony took advantage of the silence and turned to Steve. “This happened last time you met Pepper, too. You get all stammery and blushy and weird. Why aren’t you scared of Natasha? She’s the one who could kill someone with a bobby pin. Don’t get me wrong, Pepper can be scary, but mostly only in the boardroom, which you can easily avoid. What’s the deal? Come on, cough it up.”
Steve felt grief wash over him. "That's, uh, Peggy Carter." He thought about saying more but decided against it.
“Well, Birdbrain and I were eating popcorn. Natasha was eating popcorn and silently judging your performance. Bruce was in his lab because he’s all mature.”
Tony froze as soon as Steve spoke. Then he slowly turned to face him. “Jeez, don’t sneak up on me like that. I’ve got a heart condition, you know. Shut up Rhodey, I do not just use it as an excuse to make people feel bad. How long have you been standing there?”
After they’d both cleaned up (and Steve had put on his watch and applied the camera to his shirt), Steve and Rumlow headed out to a dingy bar (“I know a place, Cap. You’ll love it.”). Steve was mildly surprised when Rumlow knocked and said, “Hail Hydra,” to get them in. Steve thanked his lucky stars for Tony. Everywhere he turned was being recorded – they would be able to identify a lot of Hydra agents this way. Steve noticed that more than one of them paled as they realized who was walking through. He grinned, attempting to infuse some of how menacing Natasha always seemed when she smiled. He couldn’t tell if it worked or if they were just afraid of Captain America.
Easily sliding into captain mode as they approached, Steve started barking orders. “Sam, call the ambulance, Bucky, passenger, Clint, check the other car.” He rounded the car and opened the driver’s side front and back doors. He took in the details. They were both conscious and wearing casual clothes, but the woman in the passenger seat was wearing a veil and tiara. Shit. He crouched down next to one of the most beautiful men he’d ever seen and lowered his voice to the gentle one he used with victims. “Hey there, my name is Steve. I’m an off-duty firefighter. I don’t want you to move, okay? I’m going to help stabilize your head, just in case.”
“I’ll call you back, Rhodey. Come visit. Like tomorrow.” Tony hung up the phone. “So how are you? Where’s your new friend? He seems solid, no previous ties to SHIELD or anyone we’ve ID’d as Hydra. Works at the VA supporting other vets, which I guess seems like a worthwhile endeavor, even if that much talking about emotions would give me hives. Natasha said she likes him, and I didn’t think she really liked anyone. Except maybe the Birdbrain. Oh maybe it’s a bird thing. She only likes people named after birds. We agreed that his codename should be Falcon. Did she tell you?”
After paintball, in which Steve’s team had beaten another fire team handily, Steve headed back to Bucky’s for dinner. Bucky opened the door to his wife, Natasha, sitting on the counter drinking a glass of wine. “Uh oh,” Bucky said, knowing his wife usually preferred beer or vodka, “rough day?”
“You seem awfully put together for someone who just got into a high-speed crash on her wedding day,” Steve commented, unable to prevent a smile.
Steve could almost see the smirk he could hear in Tony’s voice. “Well listen to you. Yes, I can add whatever we get from Spy 1 and Spy 2. There will still probably be a lot of agents outside the web that we’re not sure of. We could theoretically come up with an algorithm to designate people as Hydra or SHIELD, but we’d probably have a pretty big margin of error. It’s safer to split people into Hydra, SHIELD, and unsure, then do some more digging on the unsure group.”
Boy did Tony call it. “With all due respect, sir, I think that would be a huge mistake.” He watched as Pierce’s brows shot to the top of his forehead. Even though the whole bit had been Tony’s idea, Steve felt nauseous being the one to lay it all out for Pierce. “I’m not sure how much you know about Stark’s past, but he has a deep-seated need to think he’s a hero, and he wouldn’t recognize that Hydra makes the cut. He’s all about doing whatever he wants, consequences be damned. Order isn’t exactly his style. But that doesn’t mean we can’t get what we need from him. Do you know what Obadiah Stane’s biggest mistake was? He tried to kill Stark. Before that, Stark did pretty much whatever Stane asked him to. He designed weapons and led the company to huge profits, because Stane convinced him he was helping American soldiers. Saving them. As soon as Stane decided that he wanted Stark out of the picture, Stane ended up dead. You can’t back Tony Stark into a corner. I heard that he got a request from Fury for some arc-reactor-powered helicarriers. He turned it down, mostly because he likes to annoy Fury. I’m going to take a wild guess that that was really for Hydra? Give me, say 24 hours to work on Stark. Convince him to build the helicarriers.”
“I called in a favor at SHIELD. They don’t have any assets in the area qualified to handle this, but they have the resources for when agents end up here. Jim, there’s a comm for you right over there. You’ll be in charge of updates – Thor tends to fry his comms. Let’s go.”
Tony snorted. “Yeah, good luck with that. Anyway, you want to hear about my day, or are you all about you?”
Steve followed him in, remembering everything Natasha had taught him about body language undercover. In the SHIELD halls, he maintained his usual posture, but when Pierce told him to take a seat, he let his body relax, slouching a little into the chair and crossing one leg up over the other knee. “I’ve been hoping to get to speak with you,” Steve said.
. It’s an excellent idea. Stark will refuse, Pierce will be frustrated, and you can use that as your entry. We’d better move up your chat with Rumlow. You need to practice with him before we unleash you on Pierce, and if they want this as badly as I suspect, he’ll want it solved quickly. You sure you can build that backdoor, Stark?”
“No, nothing like that. I mean… okay. When you were at MIT, when you had a crush on someone, did you tell Jim?”
"Well. Good. I'm glad you liked it." Tony went back to what he was working on and Steve went back to sketching, but he caught Tony glancing over at him for the rest of the afternoon.
Just then a sleek black car pulled up and the window rolled down. "Hey fellas. Either of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil."
Steve didn’t hesitate. “I’ll meet you at the Tower with Clint and Natasha in ten minutes. We’ll figure it out.”
One week later, Tony texted Steve and asked him to come by the tower. When Steve arrived, JARVIS directed him down to Tony's lab. As usual, Tony was fiddling, but he stopped when Steve came in.
You know, Steve and I have actually talked a lot about alternate timeline him. He said that without the push, he wouldn’t have been able to reach out to any of us. He lost his whole world, man. Everything he ever knew, poof, gone. Then he wakes up, has no one and nothing, and gets shoved right back into a fight. He said that without the hope of Bucky being alive to light a fire in him, he would’ve gone right back to that depressing pit of an apartment that SHIELD set him up with. If you ask me, he would’ve stayed there until some other terrible thing happened, running missions for SHIELD, probably with fucking Rumlow and STRIKE team, becoming less and less Steve and more and more Captain America. Hell, considering the fact that alternate Steve’s ‘evidence’ was that he was gay, I doubt he ever came out to his team. Steve told us really soon. I don’t think it’s fair to compare what alternate Steve might or might not have done. This Steve,
“Not bad, all things considered. Better now. I was pretty pissed about the cards. I would’ve picked Barton and Romanoff for a stealth B&E.”
“No, but these are low-stakes. You’re practicing baby lies. I’ll be listening via comm, and when I say you’ve convinced them, I’ll let you know and you can tell them the truth.”
Steve blinked at her. “I went after his killer. I wouldn’t have killed him, but I would’ve brought him in to face justice.”
“Emergency protocols insist that in the event of her injury, Ms. Stark be taken to a secure medical facility. I have the appropriate personnel en route to the tower as we speak.
Tasha sets them both down on top of a building a couple of streets over.  This isn’t the first time she’s managed an in-air rescue, and their smooth landing is a testament to just how good they’ve gotten at this.  It’s so effortless, in fact, that Tasha’s got her helmet half off before Steph finds her balance.
“What I’m trying to say is, everyone survived.  No one got hurt, aside from a couple of statues, and apparently that alien won’t have the strength to come back to earth for a really long time.  It’s crazy and stupid and flat out insane that an alien sorceress decided to crash land on Earth, but the incident was relatively minor.  At least it’s not another Chitauri situation.”
He gets the feeling that’s JARVIS-talk for ‘time spent in Afghanistan,’ and is hesitant to keep going.  Still, he gets the feeling that, despite being a computer program, JARVIS probably knows more of Tony’s secrets than anyone else.
Because Dum-E is beeping and chirping and gesturing with the flip phone like Christmas has come early and he’s just been gifted the shiniest, most impressive present instead of a disabled cell phone that belongs solidly in the early 2000s.  More than that, Steve looks far too pleased with himself.
He doesn’t feel any better about things the next morning. The previous night’s events run through is mind on an intolerable mental loop, and he does not look better for the replay. Neither Iron Man nor Natasha is responsible for his feelings, and it’s incredibly unfair of him to let his emotions bleed out so recklessly. The next time he sees them, he assures himself, he’ll have more control.
Steve’s brain scrambles to connect the two ideas:  Tony’s upset and the armor’s damaged.  Is Iron Man okay?  He seemed fine as he flew away, but it’s really hard to tell under all of that metal plating.  He waits for Tony to come to another stopping point before he speaks out, trying to jab out his question in the brief moment of stillness.
He automatically shifts into a defensive posture, afraid they’ve missed some other hostile, but he drops his guard when he catches the familiar flash of red.
“Dammit.”  The tension is palpable within Tony’s shoulders.  He runs his fingers through his already tousled hair and glances at the ceiling with nervous energy.  “Hurry J.”
Steve thinks for a moment, and much to his surprise he’s able to come up with an answer. “I got to meet Greer Garson during her victory bonds tour back in the 40s. That was a thrill.”
“Not the particulars, no. But the basic facts still work.” She looks him dead in the eyes, her voice surprisingly intense. “Your name is Steve Rogers. You were born in Brooklyn. You’re twenty-seven years old – yes, Steve, twenty-seven.  You’re not ninety-four, no matter what you say. You’re a highly-skilled member of the US army, who was historically assigned classified missions that you absolutely cannot discuss. You’ve just come back to the United States and you’re having a bit of a difficult time readjusting to civilian life.”
Steve doesn’t really understand how JARVIS factors into this, but Steve’s not going to get between the woman and her tech. He might, however, spare Shellhead, so he turns to Natasha.
On the other hand, he’s tangled so deeply in a web of lies that he’s probably not going to be able to escape without hacking off a few limbs.  He’s Tony Stark, but he’s also Iron Man.  He’s dating Steve, who’s also Captain America.  But Steve doesn’t know that he’s Iron Man, and Steve doesn’t know that Tony knows that he’s Captain America.  They’ve saved the world together twice, but Steve remains blissfully unaware of their combined awesomeness.  And Tony’s all for keeping it that way.
“Yes.”  He’s not sure where Steve is going with this until he steps forward with his hand in front of him, palm curved downward loosely.  When he starts to speak again, his voice is notably gentle.
“No!” he blurts, automatically.  No matter the crazy stunts he’s pulled in the past, he’d never stoop to using Steve as a publicity stunt, and it honestly kind of hurts that Steve would think it of him.  He mentally gathers himself and tries to explain.  "It's like this. I'm not looking forward to this one. People think they know me, and it's all games and gossip and little backstabbing remarks, and I just-- I'm sick of it. And you're my friend, and if I have to do this, I'd rather not go it alone. I'd rather have someone I actually like at my side. That's all. But I understand if you don't want to."
The familiar voice rings from the ceiling.“I’m so sorry Ms. Stark, but Iron Man has been delayed. He’s asked me to tell you that he won’t be able to make it and you and the Captain should start without him.
Somehow, someway, Rogers can spend his entire day within Tony’s narrow entry hallway, alternating between an
Then again, he has practically zero experience with planning a meaningful date.  He’s been on a lot of first dates – some might say too many – but he very rarely intends to see those out to date number two.  Moreover, he doubts Steve would approve of his typical romantic activities, considering his usual mode of operation is to throw money at something and see what sticks.  Steve still insists on alternating the lunch bill; he’s hardly going to appreciate an elaborate display.
Despite Steve’s insane level of hotness and his own ridiculous level of horniness, he can never quite get over the fact that he’s dating Steve under false pretenses.  As far as Steve knows, he’s dating Tony Stark, sarcastic billionaire and inventor of the most sophisticated piece of armored technology known to mankind.  He didn’t exactly sign up for dating the man inside of that armor
He should be immune to seeing Steve suited up, but Steve Rogers in the Captain America uniform will never cease to be an arrhythmia inducing vision unparalleled among humankind.  The skin-tight fabric draws attention to his ridiculously perfect physique, and the dark blue of the suit brings out the blue of his eyes. Of course, he’s seen Steve in the uniform on countless occasions throughout the years, but there’s always something so enticing about Cap in the suit pre-fight.  He looks so…pristine, as if he’s begging someone to come along and muss him up.
at it, he still never gets the impression that Steve’s leveraging him for anything.  Despite his huge, star-spangled secret, he’s just a genuinely good person.  Turns out, all that honor and bravery and self-sacrifice rhetoric that his dad spewed at him for years had some basis in fact, although by now he’s pretty sure he can credit that to Steve himself rather than his ultra-patriotic double.
and now he finally can, mapping out the planes of Tony’s face with his fingers until he can set pen to paper and capture that expressive face now that he’s gotten to see it this close.  To his eternal satisfaction, Tony looks less apprehensive and far more invested in what’s going on.
Steve chugs his water and tries to think back over those brief couple of minutes.  “I told him exactly what Fury said.  Stark signed a contract, and it’s his responsibility to live up to his end of the agreement.”
“I really do like this phone, though,” Steve says as he pulls the new model from his pocket.  “Thank you again.”
small talk; she can never quite manage to pull it off, and it always strikes her as incredibly insincere.  Not to mention her complete and utter lack of interest in the people she’s generally supposed to be talking into things, but that’s an entirely different story.
The man nods and makes his way across the room to where Steve is talking to someone from Veterans Affairs.  When the waiter holds up his tray for inspection, Steve smiles and takes two of the proffered appetizers.
One minute he’s subconsciously guilting Steve into a confession, and the next he’s...dating the man?  If JARVIS didn’t have the footage, he’d swear he’d made the whole thing up.  But nope, the proof’s all there.  The Stark servers now have highly-classified video footage of him agreeing to “take it slow” with Captain America and their subsequent cuddling/movie-watching session.  How they went from arguing about their alien induced epiphanies to watching Mandy Patinkin swordfight with a Spanish accent is anyone’s guess.  If someone figures it out, they should really let him know.
When Maria doesn’t add anything else, Steve goes into planning mode.  “Okay, I want us to split up so we can triangulate this thing.  Clint, I want you on the roof across the street.  You get this guy in your line of sight as quickly as possible just in case things go south.  Tony, Thor, you guys fly up there and cover the north and east ends of the building.  Nat and I will hit the stairs and go in through the roof access door.
Steve, being the unerringly polite person that he is, crosses to the other side of the lab so that his phone call won’t disturb Tony.  As he watches the other man walk away, Tony can feel his heart pulsating his skin, a combination of shock and indignation and…something…forcing the arc reactor into overdrive.  When Steve’s gotten far enough away, he speaks very softly into the air.
Steve draws up. “That…that makes no sense!” He thinks frantically of the two hundred miles between D.C. and New York City and what that distance could mean to a body in trauma. Getting Natasha back to the city would take time, time she most certainly couldn’t spare. Surely it would make more sense to get her to a local hospital as quickly as possible.
Thor perks up at the mention of his name and somehow manages to look smug despite his towel hat and the bag of potato chips in his hands.  “Does not one of your planet’s creation stories include a talking snake and magic fruit?”
His aim is accurate, and the shield proceeds straight toward her, which is why it’s so shocking when the projectile travels straight through the enchantress’ form and onward into the northern reaches of the park.
, and they’re easily nine feet tall on all fours.  And there are three of them.  Gripping his shield a bit tighter, he contemplates the best ways to apply vibranium to bronze.
in the air is all the warning they get, before multiple points of light flash outside of the window and the city beneath plunges into darkness.
It takes him a moment to think about how to answer that one.  He types out several replies with various levels of commitment before settling on a response.
“Yes?” he queries, not quite understanding the confusion.  “It’s not a big deal.  He’s just letting me use one of the models the company would have sent out for beta testing.”  He’s pretty sure that’s the word Tony used.
And then the idiot came back.  The next morning when Tony traipsed down the lab, his morning cup of coffee in hand, Agent Stalker was there, waiting by the doors and determined to give Tony a heart attack.  Tony had let out what may or may not have been a squeak as scalding hot coffee splashed all over his hand and his shirt.
Natasha shakes her head. “JARVIS pilots the suit remotely when Iron Man and Natasha Stark need to be in the same place at the same time. Saved my ass a few times too. He wasn’t
Steve had always been a light sleeper.  In his younger years, the slightest noise could jerk him awake in a second, and the serum had only made the instinct that much stronger.  One bump, one twitch out of the ordinary, and he could go from mid-dream to battle ready in an instant.  Lately, the skill hasn’t been put to much use; walls are much thicker now, and he technically isn’t in a combat zone.  Still, when the familiar hiss of the lab door sounds out for no apparent reason, old instincts come into play and jolt him into sudden alertness.  His eyes immediately gravitate toward the newly opened doors as he simultaneously straightens on the couch only to find…Tony?
It’s fine, though.  Steph’s dealing with it.  Coming to grips with the woman’s existence is just harder when they’re sharing a living space.
comes from the direction of the lab.  He can’t hear all that much – he assumes the doors are soundproofed – but he feels the reverberations ripple everywhere his skin touches the floor.  He’s on his feet in a second, immediately looking for something he can use to break the windows.  It’s at times like these when he desperately misses his shield, but there’s no way he can get around with carrying something like that in public.  Instead, he’s forced to grab one of the fake ficus trees at the end of the hallway; its large metal pot should function fairly well as a battering ram.
The inventor raises an eyebrow.  “I was sort of under the impression that they were getting their asses handed to them.”
“Yes,” says Tony, eyeing the goat cheese crostini on the tray in front of him.  “See that man over there?” he asks, motioning toward Steve.  The waiter’s eyes widen.
“Many happy regards on your union,” Thor cuts in.  “May we continue this conversation after our victory?”
Tony smiles.  They’ll probably still have to raid the refrigerator when they get home, but at least Steve won’t starve in the meantime.
house, Mad Eye.”  Stark’s eyes take on a mischievous glint, and despite not having interacted with the man all that much, Bruce just knows he’s going to say something outrageous.  “Besides, I didn’t even mention Steve’s and my efforts to conserve water – ”
Or maybe not.  Because Steve is slotting his fingers into the spaces between Tony’s, and his palm squeezes tightly against the back of Tony’s hand as if it was made to lie there.  There’s something so solid about the way Steve’s hand feels on top of his, the way it rests without overweighing and shelters without constricting, and Tony’s mind immediately begins conjuring all of the things it’s worked so hard to repress over the past few months.
must have misunderstood. Check again.” Natasha glares at the ceiling as if she could stare a hole through it and force her boyfriend to come flying through.
He hesitates, but Fury, it seems, has no such compunction and steps briskly through the open doorways.  “Mind if I tag along?”
“All of this is so strange for me,” he starts in what he personally considers a drastic understatement. “Iron Man was my best friend.” It’s an admittedly horrible beginning, if only for the way that she blanches.
It’s fine though.  If he can deal with being resurrected in a new century, he can deal with the aftermath of one misguided crush.  At least that’s what he thinks until he looks down at his sketchpad.
“The thing is,” Tony starts slowly, “when something like this happens, you can’t help but stop and reevaluate everything.  Everything you think you know gets thrown up into the atmosphere and you can’t help but wonder where the pieces are going to fall when they hit the earth.”
“No,” Nat replies, “he and I aren’t exactly on speaking terms at the moment.  But I think I know someone who can.”
He’s basically living Schrödinger’s Relationship; so long as Steve doesn’t know he’s Iron Man, they can both go on living in a state of relative equilibrium.  Rip off the shiny gold face mask, and he’s not so sure the relationship’s still alive.
Once outside the door to the mansion, he lays a hand on Steve’s arm, if only to extend the night a bit longer.
giving outdated tech to my outdated tech.  Who is he even going to call?  Not that he can call anyone, the phone’s disabled, but the principle stands.  That is incredibly stupid and unnecessary and just plain wrong!”
He keeps this in mind when he walks into the lab with two cups of coffee in his hands.  Despite the expense, Tony always insists that the best coffee within a three mile radius of the tower comes from the baristas he keeps on staff on the 20th floor.  For the past couple of weeks, it’s been Steve’s job to ride the elevator up and grab Tony the largest size available whenever Tony feels like a boost, which is Tony-speak for between each and every movie you watch.  Steve tries to say no – someone has to monitor Tony’s caffeine intake – but honestly, he ends up relenting half of the time.  Tony always just looks so
Now that they’re no longer in immediate danger, the awkwardness of the situation hits Steve. He’s standing in the middle of Stark’s lab covered in glass shards and faux plant mulch, all to defend Tony from an experiment that was presumably well in hand.  This was not exactly the scenario he envisioned would break their stalemate.
Ms. Stark's current whereabouts and status are unknown, as moments after shots were fired, she was carried away from the scene by Iron Man, who was with her at the time of the attack but unable to prevent the gunman from taking fire. We have received cell phone footage of the event, but please exercise caution, as this video may be upsetting to some viewers.”
“I’m alright,” he answers, back though the pause is too long for Steve’s comfort.  “I don’t know if he’s alien or not, but the guys shoots electricity out of his hands, and not in the friendly way that I do.”
He turns to leave, and Tony gives him a slight nod before closing his door.  Once there’s a barrier between them again, he immediately slumps back against the door, his head softly banging against the wood.
“Oh, we have an answer for that.” For the first time since they’ve been talking, Natasha looks genuinely amused, her eyes twinkling with mischief. “Do you know what technophobia is?”
” Tony smirks, and the smile on his face is the first hint of humor Steve’s seen since he first stepped into the lab.
Electricity?  Steve immediately picks up his pace, taking the stairs two and three at a time.  He has no idea how that’s going to affect Thor, considering he uses lighting as one of his weapons of choice, but Tony wears a suit made of metal, and he has no idea how the gold-titanium alloy will withstand an electrical charge.
He’s never been so glad Iron Man hasn’t yet developed the technology to read minds. He takes a swig of his drink and tries to pretend that he hasn’t just spaced out in an incredibly inappropriate way.
“Because…” he struggles, trying to put into words something he hasn’t fully wrapped his head around yet.  “I just...I like him, okay?”
The archer makes his way over to her and peeps at the screen.  “Yeah, it’s a clip from that weird raccoon movie that came out a couple of years ago.  What is it – something –
“I’m also,” Iron Man stresses, “not bald. “Underneath all of this is some quality follicular excellence.”
And with that, Steve knows he’s dismissed. He still has no idea what exactly Fury expects him to do, but for the first time since the Chitauri, he feels like he has a purpose.
“I’m fine. You shouldn’t keep her waiting. You’ve both got an early day tomorrow.” He rushes out of the room before his friend can call him back again, fearful that if called he wouldn’t be able to stay away.
Turns out, that isn’t even an option.  Tony, his eyes never once leaving Steve’s, yells “blackout” into the empty room, and the doors to the lab lock with a swift
“What part of ‘not talking’ did you not understand...Oh shit, that does nothing.  Throw the hammer!”
“I’ve never been good at just...relaxing. I’ve been a soldier for so long, that I’m not really sure what to do with myself without a mission.”
The director lifts the eyebrow that rests above his good eye and lets the silence stretch between them.  After a long moment, Bruce steps into the elevator.
.  True, they provide backstory, but at what cost?”  Steve looks confused and perhaps rightfully so.  He’s yet to encounter the floppy eared monstrosity.  Then again, without suffering through the Gungan, Steve won’t get to encounter the joy that is Mace Windu.  It’s a quandary.  He’s going to call it the Jar Jar Paradox.
He recoils, simultaneously turning to face the noise and concentrating on keeping his heart rate down.  He really doesn’t need to trigger the Other Guy, not now when he’s so close to potential normality.
“See you tonight then.” She glances between Steve and the elevator in a clear invitation for him to make his way out, and Steve takes it.
Steve takes a long look and the broken head and realizes that the head is the same face he sees on the ten dollar bill.  Fantastic.  He’s symbolically guillotined Alexander Hamilton.  On a normal day that might bother him, but his threshold for discomfort is pretty high at the moment.
“Spot on. Stark’s got his fingers in a lot of pies. He may be out of the weapons business, but that arc reactor is potentially the most powerful piece of tech on the planet now that the Tesseract’s gone. More to the point, he’s one of SHIELD’s most prolific contractors. That Helicarrier we flew to Stuttgart? All Stark. We don’t let him near our operating systems because the sneaky bastard’s too damn nosy, but most of our tech originates from Stark Industries.”
He turns back to Steve.  “It was a pretty big deal at the time – first viable robot with artificial intelligence.  You can probably search for the pictures on your phone.”
Steve seems unable to grasp the nuances of his awesome sense of humor, because he still looks vague and uncomprehending.  Slightly disappointed, he lets go of Steve’s shoulders and steps back.
With a few seconds remaining, he does an about face and sprints across the clearing to the pilgrim, who’s now bracing his musket against a dull bronze shoulder.  He’s still unsure of the physics of enlivened bronze statuary, but he’s pretty sure a soldier can’t fire without a gun.  He reaches the pilgrim just in time to grab the barrel of the gun and aim the shot skyward.  Wrapping his palm around the barrel, he draws the gun up and over his head, which has the added benefit of dragging the pilgrim along and tossing him to the ground.  The bronze man is surprisingly heavy, and it taxes even his strength to pry the gun out of the statue’s hand.  Once he dislodges the musket, he flips the weapon and slams the stock into the soldier’s face.  It shatters on impact.
“It surprises me,” Nat continues, “that he felt the need to get so hostile.  What did you say to him?”
Steve frowns.  “I thought you said I was supposed to connect with him. Doesn’t that sort of imply, well, sharing?”
As far as Steve knows, the last time Tony Stark and Steve Rogers spoke, they were having a moment, or at least what would have been a moment if the alien could have waited five fucking minutes.  Even though Tony’s been on a mental rollercoaster over the past few hours, Steve doesn’t know that.
Once again, Steve looks adorably confused.  To be honest, he seems to spend half his time with that somewhat puzzled look on his face, but at least he doesn’t look as dejected as he did the other day.  “I’m not sure I follow you.”
Tony swallows, and his voice is mildly strangled when he answers.  “Isn’t it supposed to be the other way around?”
It takes Tony a moment to answer.  “True,” he finally breaks out, but his eyes still look really devious.
He backs out of the room, keeping his eyes on her until the last possible second. It's a far cry from the similarly-staged scenario that they'd found themselves in a year ago, him playing Psyche to her Eros, when his main objective was to clear the room as soon as possible, lest his whole world come tumbling down. Now it takes all the willpower he has to leave. He does though, secure in the knowledge that the departure is only a temporary one.
Until Tony, that is.  Despite the various methods SHIELD had undertaken to acclimate him to the new era, he’s learned more in his weeks with Tony than in the months that he’s been awake.  More to the point, he’s comfortable in a way that he didn’t think would ever be possible again.  Down here he doesn’t have to be a useless relic or a man out of time; he’s just
Steve returns the handshake and smiles ruefully, wondering just what he’s got himself into.  “I’ll see you tomorrow, Tony.”
Steph chalks it up to surprise that she doesn’t move out of the way in time.  Before she has enough composure to do anything, Tasha’s wrapped one armor-clad arm around her waist and pulled her in close.
Steve’s trying desperately to think of something to say when Tony beats him to it.  “What about you?  Did your...team make it back okay?”  There’s a slight hesitation in the other man’s voice, as if he’s somewhat tentative about asking the question.
She sounds sadly resigned, as if the suffering she mentioned is an inevitable consequence of existence, but Steve is more focused on the last bit of her statement. “Like everyone else?” he asks.
It’s ironic, really, that his best and brightest creation is the one he’s least allowed to talk about.  Sure, the public knows he created Iron Man, but everyone just operates under the assumption that someone else pilots the suit, a bodyguard who prefers to remain anonymous because it’s the “right thing to do.”  Little do they know that Tony Stark, the man the media just loves to hate, pilots the armor they love so much.
Boy does he know that by now. Still, if there’s one thing his rapid fire introduction to modernity has taught him, knowing that something exists on the internet and finding it are two different things.  “How do you know about going what to use?”
A well-placed shield blow shatters the exterior window.  She steps back, takes a running start, and she’s airborne, breathing in the fresh air like the ambrosia it is.  The wind feels blissfully cool against her face, but she doesn’t allow herself to luxuriate in the feeling.  The ground is rising toward her all-too-quickly, and she needs to position her body to best absorb the impact.  If she can draw her shield arm in, the vibranium should take most of the impact, which should happen in five…four…three…
That could work, Steve thinks.  Technically, he’s still holding up his end of the bargain, and there’s a slight chance that he might actually make it through this assignment with some visible result. There’s still a bit more subterfuge than he’d like, but it’s better than going back to SHIELD not being able to close a job.  He turns to Stark.
uncomfortable, but that’s hardly Tasha’s fault.  And it’s certainly not for the reason Tasha thinks.
“What the hell!” he’d demanded, desperately trying to shake the liquid off his hand and understand what the creeper was still doing outside his lab.
Less than 24 hours after the Chitauri attack, she’s on every major news network giving anyone who’ll listen a play-by-play of events.  She’s loud and she’s abrasive and she’s the very definition of
Technically not a man, given the shape of the woman pressed against him, but it’s definitely Iron Man. The person who’s fought alongside him for years. Who co-leads their team, who gave him a home, who binges shitty television shows and cracks inappropriate one-liners in the middle of debriefings. The person who has his heart and, if the way they are kissing him is any indication, feels the same way.
“What? No. Think righteous anger. Stern disapproval from an all-powerful armored being with a powerful baritone.”
Pepper, it seems, has a different idea.  His usually poised assistant turned CEO has her face buried in her hands, the edges of her fingertips just brushing her hairline.  Noting that he’s reached a stopping point, she parts her hands just a little, so she can start speaking softly.
SHIELD had started him out on what they called “the easiest phone possible” so that he wouldn’t be overwhelmed by the advanced technology.  He personally thought they were coddling him, but he’d said thank you and taken what had been offered.  He still thought it was kind of amazing that you could call anywhere in the world from a phone that could fit in your pocket.  Tony seems less than impressed.  The inventor pulls out yet another sleek black thing from its packaging and finally turns to face Steve.
In the centre, like a spirit summoned from the dead, sits Schmidt. Encircling him are seven Hydra agents, poised and waiting.
Steven’s stormy expression as he walks past Anthony, eyes unfocused and bright with rage, tells him it didn’t quite work out that way.
Tony presses a small kiss to the tip of it, licking away the come that sticks to his lips as he rises up again. Steve’s almost embarrassed about how his cock responds to it, almost eager as it flops forward.
“It’s not something I ever thought I could afford, to think about.” Steven says, “Maybe in terms of the war. But not for me. Not my – happiness.”
Steven still moves slow, but Anthony can barely keep up, feels like his nerves are alight, feels so much that he knows it’s bleeding out, through his eyes, out of his mouth, onto Steven.
“Alright, darlings, I’ve gotta ask Director Carter a few questions. I’ll be back later. See if I can get some coffee with those donuts, how’s that sound, Tony?” She says, hand reaching out to rub the top of Tony’s head.
“Perhaps not consciously.” Steven concedes, “But you know how it affects me, and you use it only when you think I pose a danger.”
Anthony blinks rapidly, and Steven leans into kiss his cheeks. There’s a question in his eyes, and Anthony nods that he’s fine, hand reaching to where Steven’s bond pulses. He presses there, feels Steven’s thrusts stutter at the touch.
Hearing words come from the demonic, open wound that is Schmidt’s face is startling, and Anthony steps back. His heart beats in his mouth, every instinct in him on edge and screaming:
“But you don’t want me anymore.” Steve states, dully. The anger has fallen to slumber again. The memory of what it turns him into like a snake rattler scaring the beast mute.
“Your dad was here earlier. And Peggy’s looking for scientists, she said. There’ll – we’ll find a way.” Steve assures.
And, as if it had been heard, shots come through the clearing, booming. Loud enough for their men, huddled together in a ball of metal. A signal.
“Argh.” Bucky groans, “Do you see me? I'm still here? Why do I always have to be witness to your matrimony?”
Bruce had cackled all the way back to camp, describing the confusion and shock of the men at Thor’s sudden arrival and even more sudden departure. Anthony had laughed along, walking hand-in-hand with Steven, and speaking to the prisoners.
Steve gathers himself, trying desperately to ensure this meeting goes better than their last.  “Mr. Stark, I think we got off on the wrong foot – ”
All find their mark, and for a moment Steve allows himself to hope that they’ve found a solution.  He waits for the creature to fall over, as all possible forms of logic suggests it should, but, miraculously, the figure remains on its feet.  Instead of collapsing under the impact of the arrows, it reaches for the shafts burrowed in its chest, rips them loose, and tosses them aside.
And Tasha’s definitely noticed her flushing, damn her Irish skin.  She shoots off one final smirk, shouting a goodbye over her shoulder.  “Goodnight, Steph!”
Steve finally responds.  “Probably so, JARVIS.  Can’t say I regret it, though.”  Nope, not one bit.  Satisfied that he’s pegged JARVIS as a future ally, he settles down to wait until it’s safe to take his habitual place on the couch.  Opening up his sketchbook, he absentmindedly starts a brief pencil sketch, but the doodling is really not enough to stop his mind from straying to problematic thoughts.
adorable.  Try as he might to stay frustrated at Steve, his irritation at Steve’s inability to show on time was slowly giving way to amusement at the other man’s bumbling.  “I suppose there’s no actual reason for you to be here first thing in the morning.  The hallway just seemed so empty without you in it.  Come on in.”
Her shoulders jump slightly.  “Wait, are you talking about Agent Rogers?  Steve, as in SHIELD Steve?”
His recalcitrant bot finally peeps out from behind one of the support pillars and begins making his way toward them slowly, which is strange since he’s usually zipping around at about ninety miles an hour.
“Good to be here,” he answers, halfway to believing it’s true.  Tony smiles comfortingly, the smile of someone unerringly accustomed to reading a room and adjusting accordingly.
“No, it’s just…um…I’m not great at being diplomatic.  Or schmoozing.”  And isn’t that the understatement of the century?  She
Natasha wisely retreats as he moves forward, and it’s all he can do to keep from gasping out loud.  Steve’s not moving because he’s not conscious.  No, more than that, he’s not
Stark takes his hand for the second time, and this handshake is much warmer.  “Great!  I’m looking forward to all of your encouragement, Steve.”  His voice isn’t sincere at all, but the sarcastic grin looks genuine.
“Oh.” Tony responds.  Steve’s minor freak out is marginally understandable now.  “No, that’s  JARVIS.”
“Well, the PDF version that Ana gave me.  It was very useful.  I still don’t understand the point of some of the functions, but I’ll get there eventually. What?”  He seems somewhat put off by Tony’s blank stare.
arrows on his drawstring.  He rather doubts that’s possible.  If it was, Clint would have tried it by now.
“I’m serious!” Natasha continues. Every server in this city dreams of becoming the next Hamilton or Phantom but ends up as Dead Prostitute #4. And don’t even get me started on the recasts.”
Dum-E seems all for it though.  The spoiled brat is running his pincer up and down Steve’s hand and Steve appears fond of indulging him.
“Leave this lab right now, or I’m calling security.”  Stark’s voice is deadly serious, Steve’s heard enough ultimatums in his day to know when someone means business.  Nonetheless, he’s not giving up so easily.  He turns, walks out of the lab doors, and then spins back to face Stark.
“…insufferable!” he bursts out, finally letting go of everything that’s been bothering him for the past two days.  “We have a five minute meeting, which he’s an hour and half late to, by the way, and he spends the entire time talking about how SHIELD can’t be trusted and he doesn’t want to give Fury extra ammunition!  Not to mention the fact that he completely brushed off everything I had to say and walked out of the room without giving me a chance to respond.”
Whether the creature has some form of consciousness or just an animalistic preservation instinct, Tony doesn’t know, but it immediately senses that the flying red thing is a serious threat.  It bucks, trying desperately to break his hold, and for a moment the suit bobs in mid-air.  Oh, no.  That’s not happening.  He kicks the thrusters into maximum overdrive, and he bursts into the air, captive in hand.
He expects Steve to snap back like he usually does when Tony pushes.  When he doesn’t answer, Tony looks up, sees the pinched expression on Steve’s face, and immediately knows he’s messed up.
"You said it this morning when you were trying to explain how much you didn't hate her and again just now."
Still, she must admit, when but comes to shove, Stark comes through.  She flies that nuke into space without a second’s hesitation, a decision that Steph’s all-too-intimately familiar with.  It hurts, Steph thinks, being on the other side of that interaction, being the one left on the ground not knowing if your team member’s going to make it back.
“Tasha shrugs.  “You’re Captain America.  You’re brave and patriotic and a genuine hero.  The public loves you.”
like to spend time with you without pretending that I’m doing it for work-related purposes, because, in all honesty, that hasn’t been the case for a while now.”  He takes a breath and keeps going.  “We don’t have to jump into anything.  We can take things slow if you’d like, but I have to at least acknowledge that there’s something going on here.”
Steve’s throat muscles work, trying to clear the obstruction.  He chokes out a few weak coughs, eyes still cast down toward his clenched fist, before sputtering, "You can't be serious."
“They die if you break the casing,” he shouts, hoping Nat and Clint can hear him through the com link.
that finally brings him in.  He doesn’t know what strings Stark had to pull to make that happen, but knowing that the powers that be can’t have him arbitrarily arrested under the guise of public safety gives him a measure of security that he hasn’t had in a long time.  He’s under no illusions that he’s not being watched, but better the enemy you know then the enemy you think is lurking behind the bushes, and the temporary illusion of security and Stark’s promise of a lab space is a much better offer than anything else in his immediate future.
“What’s there to come to grips with?” At his incredulously raised eyebrow, Natasha starts qualifying. “I mean, yes, I admit that all this is a bit of a shock and I shouldn’t have,” she stumbles, the word large in her mouth, “lied. But when you really think about it, it’s more a sin of omission than anything else. I’m still me,” she presses. “The essentials haven’t really changed.”
Steve smiles, but there’s no pleasure in the gesture.  “You don’t understand,” he insists.  “You can’t imagine what it feels like, going down.”
This leads him to his second revelation: Iron Man and Stark are apparently…together. What degree of “together” he can’t exactly say, but it’s definitely the kind of “together” that ends up with one partner sleeping alone and naked in the other’s bed while the other is out of town. Are they dating? Long term partners? Friends with benefits? Who knows? Steve doesn’t, Steve
Sure enough, when he turns around, Thor is standing there in all of his red caped glory.  Hammer in hand, he advances toward the steps, and Steve allows himself to hope.
“It’s probably meant to be,” Steve says, and his voice sounds much closer than Tony thought it would be.  It looks like the boy scout decided to bend the rules a little bit and sneak under the caution tape.  “Horses can be nasty when provoked.”
Steve’s about to cut in and offer some platitude about how maybe just this once, the problem has some natural, completely innocent explanation when his phone rings.  His hopes for an uncomplicated evening are dashed when he sees Nat’s contact info flashed across the screen.
“Bounce a repulsor blast off the shield.”  Even though it’s been months since they’ve done this, the man in the suit immediately catches on, raises his hand, and aims a steady beam at the metal disc.
Steve has no idea how to process that, so he goes with a fairly simplistic response.  “You named your robot Dum-E?”
And honestly, how does he answer that question? It's not exactly as if he has a choice. At the end of the day, no matter how hard he attempts to bury his hand in the sand, Natasha will still be Iron Man.  Always has been, apparently. But that's obviously not the question she's asking. She’s asking him to merge two identities that he's held very distinctly from one another for some time now and accept the sum of their parts, to treat Natasha Stark as his brother in arms and to acknowledge Iron Man as the woman who’s founded and funded them, who he really didn't care for all that much, but has come to realize he truly didn’t know at all.
Steve knows Nat’s not going to drop this conversation anytime soon, and he drops his boxer’s stance in defeat.  “He’s just so…so…”  What words does one use to describe Tony Stark?
“Let’s go.”  They all start to make their way out of the park, stumbling past the bronze, marble, and granite remains, scattered throughout the park.  Just as they’re about to leave, Clint nudges a marble head with his foot, which Steve recognizes as the statue he beheaded with his shield.
As soon as the bronze breaks apart to reveal the hollow inner shell, the figure stops moving, and Steve breathes a sigh of relief.  They can be stopped.
Her answer indicates that she’s at least somewhat in agreement. “Want to spend some more?” she asks, as if the question even requires a response.
“Why not?” he demands, his voice growing angry. He’s more than proved his value in the field, both in his own time and this one. If Fury’s trying to keep him from working, he has a right to know why!
Steve seems unaware of the inherent illogic of his actions, because he stays hunched over and starts talking into Dum-E’s claw.  “So, it looks like everyone’s getting new tech,” he starts, “and I don’t exactly need this thing anymore.  I was wondering if you might like to have it.”  Extending his hand, Steve lets the flip phone hover in front of Dum-E’s pincer, and the robot slowly extends his claw.  The bottom two sections of his claw squeeze around the bottom half of the phone while the top one slips underneath the seam of the lid and flips up the display screen.  When he meets with success, Dum-E lets out a perky little squeak and starts waving the phone around in the air.
It's the same excuse that Iron Man offered him, and once again Steve feels the urge to take it. But he's come this far. Might as well bite the bullet. “You sure you couldn't stop by? It would mean a lot to me if the three of us could be...friends.”
“Because he’s light years ahead of everyone else in his field, and the work he does for SHIELD more than makes up for his eccentricities.”  She straightens, her voice immediately turning more businesslike. “So, for your cover…I’m not going to lie, Steve. This is going to be difficult. Most operatives would have years of training and weeks of briefing before trying to pull a ruse like this off. But, Fury seems to think that you might be able to reach Stark in a way that none of our previous liaisons have.”
Steve gets the feeling there’s something Tony’s not telling him, but at this point, they’re running out of options.  “Okay, so you just need to grab him?”
Maria Hill’s slightly staticy voice sounds out of the earpiece.  “Your assailant is on the roof of 104.”
It takes him far longer than it should to recover from Steve’s dramatic exit.  Well, it wasn’t really that dramatic.  It was just a kiss, on the cheek no less, something that hundreds of people have done over the past four decades.  Still, it’s something else when it’s coming from Steve.
Steve’s mind is still reeling, struggling to comprehend that his best friend and now boyfriend is also the man he’s fought aliens with
The message flashes across his screen, and he can’t help but wonder who is messaging him and requesting food.  Is this one of those wrong number things?  He’s just about to type in a reply, when a second message pops up.
Steve starts at the name, and his mind immediately flashes back to the first time he held his shield.
Never ceasing his movement, the god of thunder hoists his hammer above his shoulder and throws, as if he were throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game instead of an awe-inspiring weapon from another world.
“Down please, JARVIS,” he says aloud as he waits for the elevator to descend.  When he’s met with silence and stillness, he can’t help but glance upward.  “JARVIS, you there?”
Yeah, the whole platonic-bros-helping-each-other-out thing is going to be harder to pull off than he thought.
“We should be back in a couple of days, though,” she continues.  “A week tops.  I can’t really see these guys holding out much longer.”
Steve’s a bit surprised that Natasha’s darting out of the room so quickly, but a quick glance at the clock shows that they’ve been talking for longer than he thought.
Her mandated interactions with Steve really haven’t been that great either. The few press conferences and fundraisers where Steve’s been forced to interact with the woman have been lackluster at best. Stark draws attention like a flame draws a moth, and Steve does everything in his power to avoid that. He’s grateful for the way that she diverts attention away from him, but his primary goal is to leave her presence as soon as possible. It’s easier.
“Oh, believe me I've tried to stop it,” she spits. “Not all of us can have such a tight leash on their feelings.”
Steve takes another bite of pizza and contemplates the recent deluge of information.  “Okaaay,” he says slowly.  “But where do you find these things?”
“But you didn’t?” he asks, probing as gently as he can for answers to questions he didn’t even know he should be asking.
He debates the merits of reading it, but the temptation proves too strong to resist.  After all, he can’t properly assess the information if he doesn’t have all the facts.  He swipes right and reads.
“Good morning.  My name is Ana, and congratulations on the purchase of your new StarkBook.  Please let me guide you through the setup process.”
Steve hesitates before answering.  Natasha is easily the person he’s closest to in this century, but he doesn’t know just how deep her loyalty to SHIELD lies.  Somehow, he doesn’t think she’d much appreciate Stark’s views on SHIELD’s motives.
dwarfed by her hospital gown and the large IV stand next to the bed. Her eyes are closed when he enters a room and for a moment he thinks she’s sleeping. Then she mutters a single word under her breath.
And it doesn’t help that Fury won’t put him to work. SHIELD’s been nothing but accommodating so far: setting him up with an apartment and providing him with historical information on the past seventy years. Nonetheless, Fury insists that SHIELD is more of an intelligence organization than a military outfit, and Captain America’s traditional method of punching first and asking questions later doesn’t exactly fit with their standard method of operation. More to the point, Captain America can’t exactly go on covert ops, since the giant shield and uniform might throw up a couple of red flags.  No, if Steve’s going to be working for SHIELD (outside of the Avengers, at least), it’s going to have to be as Steve and not as Captain America.  He’s not quite sure how to feel about that.
He’s still a bit confused. Sure, he remembers crazy Mrs. Jankowski, his childhood neighbor from down the street who thought radio waves were going to cook her brain, but he can’t exactly see how the memory of his former neighbor would help clarify the current situation.
"An excellent evening," Tony responds, and isn’t that the understatement of the century?  He turns back to Steve.  "But now I owe you a real date."
But it works.  The public loves her, loves Iron Woman and, by extension, the Avengers.  Hawkeye is lauded for his efforts in assisting the city, the world collectively agrees to overlook Hulk’s history in Harlem, and no one seems inclined to question the legitimacy of a Russian national working for an American government agency.  The city slowly starts to piece itself back together.  There are magazine covers and interviews and an endless round of public appearances, and before long the politicians are the ones contacting
“Good reasons?” he rebuts, though not unkindly.  He waits a couple more moments before giving up.  So much for the subtle approach.  It looks like he’s just gonna have to come straight out with the truth.  Metaphors don’t seem to be their strong suit.
“It is as I said when last we spoke.  The reemergence of the Tesseract has symboled that this planet is ready for a higher form of war.  News of our victory has spread throughout the galaxy, and I fear Vitaelia will not be the only adversary who seeks to explore this new realm.”
Shit.  Looks like negotiations are over.  He glances quickly to his left, where the Central Park Pilgrim is ramming a tamping rod down the barrel of his musket.  He figures he’s got about fifteen seconds before the statue can get off another shot, so decides to deal with the source of the problem first.
“Hey, boy,” he says as he reaches out and runs a hand over his pincer.  He doesn’t care what Tony says; his robot
“It’s sort of a big deal when someone just gives you a phone that expensive,” Clint retorts.  “Previous StarkPhones with that type of processing speed and storage typically run over a grand.  I can’t even think of how much this one will cost when it hits the market.”
to rebuild from the ground up, and the federal government’s helping to subsidize the rebuilding process.  If I can get this working by the time Sinai’s ready to start construction, this could revolutionize the field of clean energy as we know it!”
Tony built Dum-E primarily as a thought experiment, to prove once and for all that artificial intelligence
“They wanted us on sight to monitor the situation in case things went south.  There’s no way to tell if this one’s from Asgard, but we’re the only ones with any sort of experience fighting extraterrestrials.”
,” he says, turning to the biggest object, “is your new laptop.  I went ahead them send up the one with all the bells and whistles, because they’re fun and you’ve been living in a tech desert.  High-resolution display, carbon-fiber chassis, advanced encryption technology, you name it.   This baby can pretty much do whatever you need it to.  But the best thing…”
Their adversary, though, seems to have one last surprise left in him.  He feels a brief hum of electricity, the precursor to a lord knows what, before the creature lets loose a giant wave of electric energy.
The two men stare at each other across the now-considerable distance that separates them.  Steve can tell that Stark is furious, but that doesn’t stop him from holding his ground, and he deliberately maintains eye contact.  He’s not about to break first.
Stark into doing what’s right, not by beating him over the head with his responsibilities.  You pretty much just regurgitated the same lecture that’s Stark’s gotten over and over again for the past twenty years.  How did you think he’d react?”
Holding up a statue that’s got to be at least over a thousand pounds seems to require very little of Steve’s attention.  Instead, he rotates his head to look at Tony, his eyes blown wide with panic.  “Tony, I – ”
Whether he finds what he needs or not, Steve will never know.  The other man starts speaking a moment later.  “Nothing,” Tony answers.
There’s a moment when he thinks he’s gone too far – silence in the room is deafening – but he allows himself to hope that maybe, just maybe, he hasn’t screwed everything up.  He’s just about to say something when Tony
He slides a bit closer to Tony on the couch and slowly brings his hand up to the side of his neck.  When Tony doesn’t flinch away, he moves up the second until both palms are resting against the edges of Tony’s face. His hands are broad enough that he can run his thumbs along Tony’s cheekbones while the center of his palms cradle the sides of his head.  He’s been wanting to do this for
Steph says none of this out loud.  Instead, she proceeds in an extremely neutral voice.  “You can’t have been paying much attention to your date if you’re off…socializing with government officials.”
“No.”  He brings the handle swiftly down across his knees, neatly splintering the head from the shaft.  He’s left with a sharp, wooden stake about five feet long, which is nicely jagged at the end.  “But this won’t conduct electricity, will it?”
“You did nothing wrong,” Steve breaks in, drawing him out of his reverie.  For the first time since his freak out, Steve’s voice in straightforward and self-assured.  “You did what you needed to survive.  No one can fault you for that.”
Apparently, the NYPD knows what they’re doing when they place their caution tape, because that horse is nowhere near steady enough to remain freestanding.  His brief contact, which hadn’t been all that powerful, is enough to set the statuary swaying on its hind legs and the giant rearing figure teeters on its hind legs.  The momentum carries the horse briefly backwards, but the recoil swing is enough to shift the weight to the overly-heavy front section, and the giant figure starts to topple, too unsteady to remain upright any longer.
“I'm self-aware enough,” she begins, “to admit that I’m far from a pleasant person when I'm showboating in public. That woman is a deliberately obnoxious persona. The few times that we've interacted when I haven't been wearing the suit, you get out of my presence as soon has possible. Not to mention the fact that I actually know what you look like when you're happy. So whatever this is that you're trying to pull, this secret torch deal? Complete and utter bull shit!”
Tony leans over the table and presses a button on the corner of the laptop.  The screen comes to life almost immediately, and a pleasant female voice emanates from the speakers.
“She used to work for me, you know.”  He tries to keep his voice from reflecting sheer, internal terror.
he gets it.  Satisfied, Steve turns to go back upstairs, but he can’t help but throw one last parting shot over his shoulder.
Steve swallows. Doesn’t Fury know it’s not that simple?!?! If adjusting to a seventy-year time jump was so effortless, he’d have done it weeks ago. But he lost his life, his friends, and everyone he’s ever known.  It makes the adjustment somewhat more difficult.
Captain America perks at that.  “I understood that reference!”  Tony smiles back at him and looks almost…proud?  Bruce would really appreciate it if someone would explain what’s going on.
Steve bursts through the rooftop door, shield at the ready, just as Thor utters his last warning.  For a moment, he cannot see anything past the rubbish scattered all over the rooftop.  There’s a clothesline and a satellite dish and a rooftop garden and tons of other things that block his vision and detract from chaos, not to mention the roof is partitioned into two different height levels with a concrete wall in-between.  He can hear the chaos coming loud and clear through the com link, but he can’t see the origin of the noise.
For a fraction of a second, he think’s Steve done something horrifically noble, like sacrificing himself to save Tony’s life.  It's definitely within the man’s character, and it seems like a horrible, frustratingly Steve thing to do.  Fortunately, his brain kicks in and remembers, oh yeah
“Steve, if I listened to everyone who told me I shouldn’t do something, nothing would ever get done.”  He stares at the horse, which is fucking huge this close up.  Not only is the stallion larger than life, but it’s rearing on its back legs in a way that would be nearly impossible to cast without magic.  It’s easily twelve-feet tall and who knows how heavy.
are growing increasingly clipped.  Sooner or later, Stark’s going to crack, and when he does, Steve will be waiting.
“I don’t know,” Nat shoots back.  “But it’s freaking people out.  Our operatives can’t figure out how to stop these things, and we really don’t want whoever’s doing this getting to the war memorials.”
That in mind, it’s both ironic and immeasurably unfair that he’s woken up seventy years in the future, but he still can’t ask Tony out on a date.  Society’s finally gotten to the point where he could step out with a fella if he wanted to, but it just doesn’t feel right to try to get close to someone when he’s got this huge secret hanging over his head.  Well,
“Over the past few weeks, we’ve sent four highly-trained senior agents to try to motivate Stark, and not a one of them lasted more than three days. I’m out of options, and my absolute last bet is you.” Fury leaned forward and clapped him on the shoulder. “Congratulations, Cap. You’re now the new official SHIELD liaison to Stark Industries.”
“Not dead. That’s always a plus.” She opens her eyes; her pupils are dilated but her gaze is direct. “What’d the doctors say?”
Tony shrugs.  “It’s taking the city a while to recover from the intergalactic wrecking ball.  Construction crews are hauling away things bit by bit, but I don’t think cleanup’s a priority at the moment.”
“Over here.”  Tony walks toward the couch he generally crashes naps on in between work sessions, and Steve follows.  “JARVIS, queue the screen.”
He’d spent far too much time staring at that jawline to not recognize it, not to mention the fact that it’s Steve.  He knows how Steve moves.  He knows how he sounds.  He know how he thinks...or at least he thought he did.
Tasha, however, seems offended by her answer.  Her lips do that pursing thing that Steph absolutely hates, and one of her eyebrows lifts mockingly.  Steph feels obliged to explain.
Tony’s hands jerk, and when he speaks, his voice comes out in a sharp burst.  “What do I know?  Do whatever the hell you want, Steve!”  Startled, Steve rears back, wondering what exactly he’s done to get Tony so upset.  He holds himself still, afraid that anything he does could somehow make this worse.
As the triumphant notes of Korngold’s opening score resound from the lab’s speakers, he allows himself a brief moment of nostalgia before settling in for the film.  He should probably be brushing up on something more modern, but right now he just wants something comfortable.  After all, just because the film’s slightly dated doesn’t mean it doesn’t have value.
He can see the battle going on inside of Tony’s head; despite the fact that they’re sitting less than a foot away from each other, the other man gone, wrapped up in some sort of mental landscape where he’s probably debating every conceivable outcome of their conversation.  Steve stays still, waiting for Tony to resurface, and hopes that whatever mental arithmetic Tony’s doing works out in his favor.
“I haven’t known her that long, actually.  But she’s been really helpful helping me adjust to things since I got back stateside.”
Clutching the flowers to his chest, Tony steps back into his room.  “I’m not quite ready yet.  Give me ten minutes or so?”
“Needs must.” Natasha breaks eye contact and stares at the floor, unwilling to carry the conversation any further, which leaves the threads for him to pick up.
After an uncomfortably long silence, he composes himself enough to cease his impression of a drunken owl and take the bouquet from a now blushing Steve.
“Haha, very funny,” Tony replies with absolutely no levity in his voice.  JARVIS’ humor is much funnier when it isn’t following on the heels of crippling defeat.  He turns to look for the thousandth time and the schematics, trying to work out where exactly he went wrong this time.  The math is theoretically perfect – it should
He pays the pizza delivery guy and digs into his order.  (No matter what Tony says, pineapple on pizza is a beautiful, beautiful thing.)  He’s just finished off his first slice when he finally thinks to consult JARVIS.
It takes JARVIS a moment to respond, but when he does, his typically moderate British voice emerges clipped and reserved.  “I am loyal to sir in all things.  My protocols forbid me from engaging in any form of deception.”
“Really,” Steve answers with nod.  “Some things are just too important to keep in, even if saying them out loud is a risk.”
,” he insists, trying to draw on Tony’s incredulity.  The more Tony speaks, the less he has to lie about.  “But growing up I didn’t know anything different.”
is that Flynn has had it with the motherfucking snakes on the motherfucking plane.”  He pauses, for a moment, thinking through the list he’s compiled.  “In fact, I’m sort of on the line about letting you watch Episodes 1-3 of
Steve shifts his attention back to the metal horse currently braced in his hands, as if he’s somewhat surprised to find it there.  It would almost be funny if it weren’t for the massive amounts of tension he was radiating.  He lowers the statue quickly but with complete control, laying the sculpted horse down on its side to avoid any further mishaps.  He wipes his hands on his pants as he finishes, partially in an attempt to brush off the dust but also, Tony thinks, as an excuse to avoid making eye contact.
Yup, the AI is definitely enjoying this.  “These are,” he struggles to characterize the pictures, “most definitely something.”
“There are ways to declassify things, though.  I mean, it’s not easy, but if it gets to the point, you could tell Stark if he signs an NDA.  Hell, he’s probably already got one on file, what with inventing Iron Man and all.”  Clint’s eyes grow big and his shoulders jump.  “Can I be there when you tell Fury?  Oh, please let me be in the room.  Or at least in the vents.  This is something that must be
A much easier alternative would be for you to simply work out the whole thing with one of Fury’s reps.  As of yet, I don’t think you’ve answered any of their questions, and Agent Rogers seems very dedicated to reaching a compromise.  Phil speaks very highly of him.  How hard would it be to simply sit down for a meeting and save us both the headache?
be shatterproof.”  Steve drops his head and tries not to make eye contact.  “Anyway,” Tony continues, “how’s the setup going?  Figuring everything out?”
Steve scrolls through the alarmingly long list of results, clicks three images at random, and forwards them to Tony.
“So you basically told Stark he was obligated to do something and then lectured him on the importance of the weapons industry?”
He’s a bit frustrated that SHIELD thought he couldn’t handle what was essentially a very fancy typewriter.  Everyone goes around assuming that he’s afraid of technology, all the while glossing over the fact that he volunteered for an experimental science program that pumped him full of chemicals and some sort of specialized energy ray.  Sure, he doesn’t quite understand the way these new devices work, but that doesn’t stop him from appreciating their capabilities.  That video footage, for example, is something that he should have been give access to a long time ago.  He assumes that the Avengers will be needed again sometime in the future, and it’s painfully clear that they need to learn to function as a team.  Their response to the Chitauri invasion had been a matter of necessity, but they’d basically approached the battle as six independent fighters trying to win a war.  True, there were moments of synergy – Black Widow and Hawkeye worked well as a unit, and at one point Iron Man had bounced a repulsor beam off of his shield – but those moments were few and far between.  Nope, this footage is a gift, one that he could only dream about during the war.  He needs to study this and analyze the ways he can improve his team.
She keeps this thought firmly in mind as she grasps Tasha’s cheek and finally answers the woman’s question.  “Yes,” she says, as earnest as she knows how to be.
If finding Natasha in Iron Man’s bed had thrown him for a loop, this latest development has sent him into a tailspin, and at this point, his brain is physically incapable of aligning with true north. Still, this most recent discovery of Natasha’s double life has inspired a different flavor of panic. This is the sharp, bitter pang of shock, and it will pass in time. What’s disturbing him most is the softer feeling of relief that’s settled in after the rush of excitement has faded.
“You lose your alarm clock?” he asks in a voice that’s supposed to be humorous but comes off a tad too close to accusatory.
It’s a beautiful movie.  Whoever put this on obviously spent a fortune trying to get the details right, since all of the furnishings look like something he would have expected to find a century ago.  The costumes are exquisite, the leads are talented, and the underlying score is definitely catchy.  He keeps his eyes glued to the screen during the French girls scene – so that’s what Tony meant – but he subtly kicks the bag with his sketchbook further under the couch.  The blush on his cheeks has less to do with the nude woman on the screen and more with the engineer in the tank top across the room.
“No,” Steve answers.  “And the worst thing is, it’s not like there’s anything to come back to.  Every therapist they make me see keeps suggesting I reconnect with people or places that feel familiar, or to take up old hobbies, but how the hell is that supposed to help?  All of the friends I had were military, and my family’s dead.  I’m not sure I even know where home is anymore.”
Tony immediately stills and works to keep his face from broadcasting his shock.  This is dangerous territory, and he absolutely cannot allow Steve to continue too far in this direction.  He doesn’t think that Steve would take the information back to Fury, but he can’t be too careful.  Damn Steve for being so perceptive, and for knowing him well enough to consider the possibility of his double life.
Steve follows his finger and his eyes take in the two figures on the other side of the room.  “I’m very confused,” he says after a moment.
Steve immediately understands everything Stark’s not saying.  He’s been on the front lines and seen the life-or-death decisions medical personal have to make in the heat of battle.  Sometimes a person who would have lived under normal circumstances doesn’t make it, simply because the doctors don’t have the time or the resources to spend when they could be helping someone with a greater chance of survival.  But that’s battlefield logic.  It shouldn't happen here.  Not now, and not in New York.
“My protocols forbid me from disclosing things Sir wishes to keep confidential.  I am not allowed to reveal anything that he has told me in confidence or that would threaten the security of Mr. Stark or any of his associates.”
It’s not until later that Steph realizes just how much Stark’s media circus has shaped public record.  Even with the wealth of news crews in New York City and a seemingly-endless array of cell phone cameras, there’s not that much direct footage of the actual fighting.  They'd all moved around too quickly, and most of the people who got close to the action had more pressing concerns than filming events for posterity.  Not that Steph really understands the need to document every single moment of life, but the world seems to lap up Natasha’s exuberance.  And her footage.
“What about the thing with the lightning?”  Somehow, he has the feeling he’s not going to like the answer.
There’s absolutely no way they’ve shattered every statue in the park, and there’s still the central problem of the enchantress herself.  What if she makes her way toward Wall Street or the New York Public Library?  Steve has no desire to either fight a bull or giant stone lions, thank you very much.
Tony had finally called it quits around midnight after his latest calculations fell through.  (He blames Stalker for that.  How was he supposed to think with that much muscle practically
"But it doesn't make any sense,” Tony responds, his voice caught between laughter and confusion.  “You're so graceful.”  Seriously, the man throws backflips into his sparring sessions and swan dives off airplanes.  "I've seen you work out. I've seen you fight. You're breathtaking. And... you can't dance?"
“No!” Steve exclaims, suddenly worried that this friend has somehow been a silent witness to his innermost thoughts. It wouldn’t be the first time that the two of them were almost eerily in sync. “Why would we have a problem?”
As he steps into one of the Stark Tower elevators, Bruce Banner is seriously questioning his sanity and his life choices.
“You’re…” Tasha pauses, struggling for the word, before finally shaking a stiletto in her direction.  “You.”
He can barely make out the SWAT team hovering near the borders of the park, but he knows they’ve been ordered to stand down unless things turn violent.  Quietly, he starts speaking under his breath knowing the team’s in-ear com links will pick it up.
Her lips twist upward, but there’s no joy in them. “Something like that.” He expects that to be the end of the conversation, brief as it is, but much to his surprise, Natasha plows forward, her voice meticulously picking out each word. “With Iron Man I…I finally had a relationship that meant something to me. I didn’t want to ruin something that gave me…that let me…” she stumbles, “…just be
“I…” she begins only to stop, shifting her jaw in consternation. After a few moments, she exhales sharply. “This is harder than I thought it would be.”
He can remember seeing this movie either five or seventy-four years ago, depending on the frame of reference.  He and Bucky had shelled out twenty-five cents apiece for a midnight showing and even splurged on a ten cent bag of popcorn.  A week later they’d done the same thing all over again; it was that good.  There was just something really inspiring about watching Flynn’s Robin Hood jump off that drawbridge, muster his men, and speak out against a tyrannical regime.
“You have an odd definition of fun,” she answers back, wiping at a drop of sweat inching its way down her forehead under the cowl.
Steve struggles to keep his face impassive. Everyone keeps looking at him like they expect him to fall apart, as if the idea of new technology or social progress is going to destroy him. They somehow forget just what exactly he’s seen in his life. The tesseract, the Red Skull, and even his own shiny post-serum body are all the products of remarkable and inexplicable technology. No, it’s not what’s in the future that disturbs him. He’s more upset by all of the things he’s left behind.
“Yes, Steve, believe it or not, I understand the concept of owning multiple properties. Freakishly well, actually. What I don’t understand is why you’d choose to run to this little hole-in-the-wall when you have 10,000 square feet of space tailored to meet your super-soldiered needs smack dab in the middle of one of the most expensive and fascinating cities in the world!” She crosses her arms and her tone goes defensive. “You never seemed to have a problem with it before.”
“You were trying to save me from death by imminent explosion.  I think you can be forgiven.  Besides, the contractors will be here this afternoon, so there’s really nothing to worry about.”
When all of this is over, he’s going to write a nice, long note to the City of New York, pushing floral arrangements over metal decor.
Tony nods in understanding, and Steve shifts his weight to the balls of his feet.  “On my mark, we move forward.  I throw, you grab, that thing goes right in the East River.”  Tony remains silent, but the repulsors in his palm roar to life.
“On it, Cap.”  Tony’s voice sounds from over his left shoulder, bereft of its usual snark.  They share a quick nod of understanding just between the two of them before Steve turns to the rest of the team.
“Yeah…” She inhales once deeply and then plows forward. “Neither of us liked keeping it a secret,” she blurts, and Steve starts at the sudden conversation. “Us, being...together,” she clarifies. “I...
“He’s intense,” Steve answers.  “You’d think a man sitting in an apartment would make for a really boring story, but it was strangely compelling.  And a bit voyeuristic, to tell you the truth.”  Not to mention, Jimmy Stewart had aged well.
In that very first press conference after Obadiah’s double-cross, he came so close to letting it all slip.  It would’ve been so easy – tell SHIELD to stick their cover story where the sun don’t shine, throw away the notecards, and say
Steve bristles at that.  “That’s uncalled for.  Tony’s a swell guy.”  Clint throws his palms up in a gesture of surrender and takes a slight step backwards.
“We need an accelerated construction schedule, and we need it yesterday, but Stark operates according to his own timetable. He’s rich as hell, so withholding payment doesn’t faze him. And his competitors aren’t worth shit, so we can’t turn anywhere else. He’s got a monopoly on our tech, and we can’t afford to wait any longer.”
When a shadow moves overhead, he immediately sinks into a crouch, thinking that one of the many winged statues is priming for an attack.  It’s only when he hears a familiar filtered voice overhead that he straightens.
“Iron Man!” Steve exclaims happily and looks upward.  The figure flying above him isn’t an artificially animated bronze statuette, but a much flashier red and gold model who is, amazingly, carrying his shield.  “Boy am I glad to see you!”
thing.  More to the point, how did Steve go about finding this particular image so quickly and placing it in context?  The man just saw
As Steve crosses the room, settles himself in a plush leather rolling chair, and pulls out yet another thick book, Tony can’t stop a brief
Dating Steve Rogers is simultaneously the most rewarding and the most frustrating thing he’s done in his entire life.  On the one hand, he’s
“I don’t think I'm ready for that yet.  Let’s at least get in one date first.”  At least, if that’s something Tony’s still interested in.  Gosh, he’s confused.
Pepper glares at the phone glued to his hand.  “You’ve been attached to that thing for the last thirty minutes.  Is there something going on that I don’t know about?”
“No.  That’s a bit too conspicuous, but Nat should bring it to the scene.”  He rummages into the bottom of his messenger bag, at last coming into contact with the rolled-up fabric.  He quickly snaps his wrist, causing the familiar colors to unroll, and pulls his civilian shirt over his head.  His hand reaches back in for the uniform pants when he realizes that Tony is being uncharacteristically silent.
Steve doesn’t quite understand what she is she’s looking for since it’s not exactly his place to offer permission or absolution. And if Natasha’s relationship with Shellhead predated his arrival in the twenty-first century then it’s not exactly as if it’s in his power to wreck it.
Steve told you, and he did it while making sure that your best friend was there to support you, and then left his only home in this century to give you the space you need. And speaking of your best friend, what would you do if Rhodes had been the one compromised? Would you just hand his well-being over someone else? Steve was in a tough spot. Cut him some slack.”
Also, I hope everyone is staying home and staying safe during the pandemic! My day job is an epidemiologist, so public health is near and dear to me. Please please please stay home if you can (I know it's not possible for many). Take comfort in fandom during this difficult time. I hope you're all doing well. <3
Timeline update for those having trouble keeping track of where we are! This chapter picks up right where the last chapter left off, so February/March-ish of 2013, or about the time of the second Thor movie (the timing of that movie isn't particularly clear, so I've elected to have it happen then).
“JARVIS, do you happen to have any surveillance footage from when they were taken?” Immediately, video footage displayed on the wall. Steve, Bruce, and Thor watched as Pepper saw Killian, told Maya to run, and was grabbed. They also watched as Maya stepped up to Pepper and took her cell phone and threw it away.
“I think it’ll depend on whether or not Fury is dirty. If he’s clean, they probably won’t want Natasha or Clint. I’m guessing they think Bruce and Thor are too anti-government for Hydra. You… I’m not sure. I think they’ll probably think that recruiting you would be too big a risk, given how publicly you’ve gone after terrorists.” He shot Tony a wry grin as he recalled Tony calling out a terrorist on live television.
Natasha reappeared as though she'd been waiting for a cue. "We'll help you redecorate. Won't we, Clint? We'll stop by tomorrow, see what we have to work with."
Tony seemed to snap back to himself a little bit. "At this point, not much. I have JARVIS analyzing the data to see if we can get a pattern of the Mandarin's attacks. Rhodey is working on it for the government. Aside from the bombing with… with Happy, the media has only reported on three. There have actually been six more that weren’t made public.”
Steve tried to emulate Rumlow’s off-putting grin. “That’s the best part, Mr. Secretary. Captain America tends to get a lot of… leeway.”
“Sir, if I may?” JARVIS asked. He continued when Tony waved a hand. “There were military dog tags at the scene of the bombing in Malibu belonging to a Mr. Jack Taggart, but no individuals by that name have been listed among the dead or injured. I have also been unable to detect the remains any explosives at the scene. I have searched my database, and this most closely resembles an explosion that occurred four years ago in Rose Hill, Tennessee, which predates any known Mandarin attack. An ex-army soldier named Chad Davis caused an explosion, killing himself and five other people. I beg your pardon, but Miss Potts is calling.”
Steve found himself looking for Tony, who was watching him. “I’ll take care of the behind the scenes. We’ll find him.”
“I am afraid not, Captain. JARVIS stands for ‘Just a Rather Very Intelligent System,’ although I believe this name was chosen to honor Edwin Jarvis after his death. I am an artificial intelligence created by Mr. Stark. I monitor Stark Tower at all times and assist Mr. Stark in any way I can.”
He instantly recalled Tony telling him that SHIELD had undoubtedly bugged his apartment. Her reluctance to talk here was encouraging – maybe she would be willing to keep some things from SHIELD after all. To prevent her subterfuge from being in vain, he just nodded, then asked, “So do you think the chair should go on the other side of the bed? It’s no trouble to move it.”
"Okay, so back to the plan. Steve was recruited by Red Skull, then, while doing his research on SHIELD, discovered that Zola was inside SHIELD from the beginning. But how did he figure out which SHIELD agents were Hydra? If it was obvious, Fury would figure it out," said Clint.
Tony, laughed, though it came out a little bit brittle. “You’re not the only one who swoons at Captain America, Agent. And you haven’t even seen him really turn it on. He does that aw-shucks smile at them and they fall all over themselves to do anything he asks. He even broke Romanoff. Your lovely scientist – what was her name? Jemma? – was oh so eager to be helpful when he asked.”
Tony looked around at everyone; they were all staring at him, except for Rhodey, who was staring at Steve. Tony rolled his eyes. “Oh my god. Stop with the dramatics. We’re fine. It’s fine. The Manchurian Candidate didn’t know what he was doing and Capsicle didn’t do anything wrong. I needed to process. I’ve processed and we’re all good here.”
Steve hesitated, not knowing how to answer, but Clint interrupted. “The thing is, you’re not the only one with that kind of… foundation. I was a disaster when I started at SHIELD – I literally ran away from my family to join the circus, where it turned out people were just as awful. I would’ve done just about anything my handler asked. But my handler was Coulson.” He swallowed hard.
“Why would it bother me? I don’t have a problem with two of my friends dating. Say, you hungry? I could go for some Chinese food.”
? Okay, let’s just get this straightened out before the poor guy moves in. I am not interested in Sam. He seems like a really good guy and I like being able to talk to another soldier. He doesn’t even know I like men. And he definitely likes Natasha.” Steve frowned. “I’m going to matchmake her right back. Damnit. I don’t need her to find me someone.” He was grumbling now, he knew, but he couldn’t seem to help it. Inexplicably, the thing that bothered him the most was that Tony thought he wanted to date Sam. He looked up. “Seriously. Not wounded. Now. What do you want to watch with our Chinese food?”
Thor gave an indulgent smile. "Of course I will take it with me. They will be most entertained by your Midgardian technology." Clint barely controlled a snicker at the look on Tony's face.
“I’ll do what I can. Hydra is everything Aunt Peggy fought against. I won’t let it take over SHIELD if I can help it. It sounds like future-you gave us a leg up. We just have to use it.”
Once at SHIELD, Natasha left him in front of Fury’s office with nothing but one raised eyebrow. He gave a perfunctory knock and entered the room. “What can I do for you, Sir? Another mission, perhaps?”
Clint was a totally different story. Bonding with Clint was easy – definitely the easiest thing Steve had done in this century. He still missed Bucky fiercely, but over the next several months, Clint filled in some of the holes of emptiness he’d been living with since waking up. Steve wasn’t quite ready for everyone to know he was gay, but it was nice having someone he could talk to, and Clint made it so easy. He brought Steve to the roof of an apartment building to watch the Pride parade that June. Steve couldn’t believe how amazing everything was and promised himself he would be brave enough to go next year.
Steve smiled in return and stepped back to wave her into the room. “I appreciate you making an exception.”
Natasha didn’t look surprised at his ire, but Tony did. “Look, it was a bad week for me, dying and all. I possibly made some, shall we say, less than ideal choices. Maybe, for that moment in time, she was right. Doesn’t have to be a big deal, Cap. We’re a team now, right?”
Hydra Preparatory Academy is a real thing! At least according to the Agents of SHIELD show. And Sitwell actually went there.
Clint glanced at Nat. “We’d better get started on team assessments. We’ll keep you posted on any teams where we think that Hydra outguns the SHIELD agents. Good to have you back, Cap.” They melted away.
Hello all! I hope you're doing well. It's been a crazy few weeks (my husband got his wisdom teeth out and my cat had an emergency vet trip), so this took a while. Sorry for the delay! I am still welcoming suggestions for Queen songs that you tie to a particular character. The last chapter (Don't Stop Me Now) was for Tony. If you have ideas for other characters, let me know in the comments! Thanks to all the people who have read and especially those who have commented :)
Tony smiled wider than he had since Steve had been home. “Well I’m glad you won’t be pining away. Let’s watch something fun.
“Most liars get caught because they’re inconsistent. If we’re going to send you undercover as Hydra, you’ve got to commit. Future you only had to say one line. You have to have a whole backstory, ideology, identity, plan, everything. We’ve got broad strokes, but if you don’t want to have to improvise, we’ll need the details. For the most part, we’ll want you to stick as close to the truth as possible. Your very handy eidetic memory will allow you to keep track of everything, but it’s easier to convince people you’re telling the truth if you actually are telling the truth. The key is strategically leaving out the right things. You don’t have to necessarily tell people the answer – let them do the math on their own and come to the conclusion you want them to.”
Steve watched in hidden horror as Pierce pulled up a video of a man strapped to a table with a guard in his mouth. “Meet the Asset. The Winter Soldier. He is the fist of Hydra. For decades he has shaped the world.”
“Guys, we’re going to be there in 15 minutes. Any music at all is better than listening to the two of you,” Clint said wearily.
“Yeah, sure. Miss Virginia Potts, CEO, ties the knot. You’ve been working extra hours all week. None of the prep caused you to break out the wine, though. What happened? Someone get stood up at the altar?”
Steve came slowly out of his tense crouch, puzzling over what he had just heard. “Edwin?” he asked. Now that he was fully conscious and focusing, rather than reacting, he realized that the voice was familiar to him. He smiled at the idea of seeing a friend from his life before.
"You know, Howard talked about Bucky. Don't feel bad, you were still his favorite, but I think he liked how nuts Bucky always went over his tech."
Steve took a deep breath and made his way to the workshop, but he forgot everything he was planning to say the moment the doors opened. “Killer diller!” he whispered in awe, so softly Tony may not have even heard him. His fingers itched for a drawing pencil in a way they hadn’t since he’d awoken in this century. Though the walls were unremarkable, the contents of the room radiated beauty. One whole wall was a museum exhibit, displaying Iron Man suits, and everywhere he looked were holograms that appeared to be there by magic. Spinning around with a grin that felt unfamiliar on his face, Steve spotted Tony at a table, screwdriver in hand, watching him curiously.
“How far back does JARVIS store recordings of what’s happening in the tower? I’d like to review everything our future selves did when they were here. It has audio, right?” Steve said.
“Gonna talk shop, hm? You go right ahead, honey. I’ll go make dinner. You boys can talk out back. Captain? I’m really glad you came. You brought my daddy back with you.” With that, she kissed his cheek and walked into the kitchen.
“Certainly, Captain.” There was a brief pause. “They are all located there already, presumably awaiting your return. Shall I take you there now?”
“I can’t believe my two best friends are getting married today! You’re welcome for that, by the way.”
“Actually, you’re not. As a show of good faith, I’m going to introduce you to the Asset. Not in person of course. Via video feed.”
Steve shoved him gently. “Shut up. This is all your fault. Look, that,” he waved vaguely at the projection, “is not the point. The point is, I was right. SHIELD was omitted from my who-to-trust list on purpose. Because at least some of them are actually Hydra.”
“Okay, look, I’m a spy, but when I’m not undercover, I pretty much call it like I see it. So I wanted to talk to you about something. I called Bucky pretty when we were here yesterday, and you kinda reacted to that, so I’m just going to tell you right out. Things are not the way they were when you went under. I mean, I know you know that. But specifically, men liking other men is not the way it was when you went under. It’s legal to be gay now. It’s even legal to get married, at least some places. I wasn’t really thinking when I said it. I’ve never made much of a secret of the fact that I’m bi – bisexual, I like men
If Sharon was taken aback by his request or the abrupt manner in which he made it, her face didn’t show it. “And what kind of help would that be, Captain?”
"Well, you know. I'm loving the lack of polio. And the food. The team has undertaken my food and movie education with gusto. We used to boil everything. Got myself a fancy new StarkPhone. A lot of things are better." He paused as he looked at Sam. "Some not better enough. Look this is probably weird, but do you wanna grab a beer with Natasha and me tonight? I don't have a lot of soldier friends. Well. Not a lot of friends period I guess. Natasha says I should make more."
Almost before he finished talking, Trip pulled him in. “Thank you. Thank you for my grandfather’s life. Thank you for coming here and for bringing him back to us. Thank you for warning me about Hydra, probably saving my life.” He clapped Steve on the back and pulled away. “Come on in and say goodbye to my mama. I do what I can, but there’s nothing quite like a mom hug to set you right.”
Tony stared at him with narrowed eyes, then sighed. "I believe you. But I'm not so sure about the superspies. How do you want to play this?"
Steve sat there in shock for a moment, then pulled out his phone and called Tony. He picked up after only half a ring. “Yeah, I know, don’t start, Rogers,” he grumbled in place of a greeting.
Bruce took his glasses off and started to clean them. “JARVIS, do you know what Killian’s Extremis project is?”
"Ahh, they've decided to have Captain America try to wrangle Iron Man since they couldn't manage it?"
angry. Everything here is too much, too loud, too big. You are certainly no exception to that. The men I served with were heroes, too, but no one remembers them but me. And everyone will remember you. I was too busy being struck by the unfairness of that that I was unfair to you. Truce?” He extended his hand with half a smile. “I think we’re going to need it for the second thing on my list.”
Steve woke up the next morning with energy to burn, so he went for a run. He’d liked the Washington Monument when he was last in DC, so he decided to head back. The sun was just coming up when he saw another runner.
He told her everything about his future self coming back, tricking SHIELD agents into thinking he was Hydra, the team wanting him to go undercover. " I don't know what I'm going to do. Okay, so say they buy that Red Skull turned me and that I magically figured out that Hydra was in SHIELD from one picture of Zola. How am I supposed to explain how I knew the STRIKE team was Hydra?"
Phil shook it, then smiled over at Tony. “You weren’t kidding about his persuasive skills. My team has a mission. I’ll drop them off and come to New York. I’ll be there tomorrow night.”
“Well, you just solved the mystery of what’s happening off the coast. That must be where they’ll have Pepper. We also have to deal with the President. He’s on Air Force One, which should be in the airspace just above us, with somebody else dressed in my War Machine armor,” Rhodey sounded very disgruntled. “The Vice President said that he’d talk to security, but baseline human agents aren’t going to be any match for a guy with Extremis inside my armor.”
He signed her out at the desk pushed her in a wheelchair to a car out front paid for by Tony. When they got to the hotel, she raised one eyebrow at him. "So a secret adventure then, eh?"
