“Are you being promoted, Sir? I’ve always said-”
Steve’s mouth twitched. If he had done that to Herr Hammer, the man would have had a fit. Well, perhaps not if a royal had made the command. Hammer did so admire the wealthy and powerful.
morning exercise. If you can imagine,” Tony drawled, grinning at the irritated huff of breath in his ear. “Really you’ve only you to blame for this Captain. If you didn’t insist on setting such unbearably high expectations for manhood the rest of us might feel more confident in our own skins.”
It helped that Péter was away at school. Once they learned that he was a ‘scholarly sort’ and would likely be in Switzerland all through university, most of the women who felt they just had to talk to him about how eager their daughters were to embrace motherhood backed off; but there was no halting those who wanted to congratulate him on Natacha’s beauty and strength of character, and to ask whether or not she had her heart set on anyone. As if they believed at twelve years old her head was only filled with thoughts of how quickly she could hold a baby in her arms, and that any of them cared in the first place what her heart wanted.
"Yes." Came the boy's mumbled reply, his head hung low, and Tony tensed once more as Stefen grabbed the boy by the chin and forced their eyes to meet, prompting in the same dangerously calm way.
“It’s probably Hogan, with the car,” Tony reminded them both over the pounding of blood in his eardrums.
Ned dropped his hand and turned as the whistle blew again.
“Especially you I think.” He heard Pepper murmur under her breath, just for his ears, and then jumped in surprise when she jabbed him in the chest with a pair of envelopes. “These came with the postman.”
Fire flashed through the Warden’s eyes and he opened his mouth – but at that moment, a harsh siren began to wail outside the single window, echoing like a distant shriek throughout the camp.
Dinner was delicious, for having been prepared by two old soldiers and a couple of wealthy brats all grown up, if Tony didn’t say so himself. Everyone ate happily, filling the room with laughter as the pot of spiced wine slowly emptied.
She was still a child, he reassured himself. God in heaven, could she just be safe from at least that one thing!
“You’re not asking. I’m offering. Three minds are better than two and with my tools, you stand a better chance than if I don’t go, so I’m going. I’ll get you to Poland-” Péter turned to Natacha who was still gripping his arm tightly and laid his hand over hers. “And then I’ll turn around and get on the first train home. I’ll be back before you can even start to miss me.”
Yes, Ian thought. Like Da.
It might have been more impressive if Tony hadn’t witnessed the man nearly topple over.
Looking around now, the only thing of personal value Bucky had clapped eyes on was the line of photos of the children. All of them formal, their mother nowhere in sight.
"I should go and get things in order. You should keep the room tonight. " Steve said into the silence. A beginning and a declaration all in one. That was how they worked. Steve left home in search of work and Bucky followed to watch his back. Steve joined the army and Bucky had his back there too. Only this time, Steve decided he was the man to take down Hitler and Bucky maybe didn’t follow. Steve never left him without a choice.
For Christ sake! Bucky stirred his food mulishly. He couldn't even enjoy a constipated Rogers apology anymore!
"Yes, he is here. Another distraction to my work and a disruption to my ward. How am I to run a proper laboratory if I am not allowed access to my own specimens?"
"Are you still afraid someone will take notice?" Tony asked.
“Frau Hogan is the one to speak to, Herr Stark, but I warn you she wholeheartedly agrees with me on the matter. There is no need. It would simply be a waste of money.”
Stefen smiled, leaning just the slightest bit to close what little distance remained between them so that Tony knew he was about to be kissed – until the sound of footsteps at the end of the hall caused them to jerk apart.
Before he really knew what he was about he was digging in his pocket for the little toy he’d made – just a little figurine he’d made in class out of melted iron and tin that he’d been saving for Artur – and walking toward her. The girl looked up as he approached, wary but curious. Her parents were so busy arguing with the other adults in the line, trying to figure out what they should do next, that it wasn’t until Péter was standing right in front of her that the girl’s mother noticed him and pulled her daughter close to her side.
Steve could feel the sweat as it dribbled down the side of his skull, clinging to his sticky skin. He could not tell if the sweltering heat within the room came from within or without, as they fierce desert that had taken up residence in his throat and mouth could have been a product of dehydration as it was whatever sickness had laid him low this time around.
Zimmerman shuffled aside to let the boy, who Steve recognized as the little French one that always seemed to be hanging around special agent Coulson, and a stout older woman who was followed by an equally stout younger woman who bore such a strong resemblance to her she couldn’t only be a daughter.
“What sorta job?” the boy asked. His heavy French accent made his German sound thick and clumsy. It made Stefen think wistfully of an old friend, someone he hadn’t seen since the war. And given the state of things, Steve privately thought with a pang that he was not likely to ever see Dernier again.
“A pillow biter like you Kirk wouldn’t know the first thing about showing a lady a good time.”
“Sorry for the mess,” Obi apologized. “I haven’t been in town long enough to dust the old place off. Come in, come in.”
“I never took you for an ass man, Cap,” Tony chuckled breathily, the sound of his voice low and intimate within the quiet of the room.
“Oh James, really. He’s a child.” Charlotte scolded him, but there was a glitter of amusement in her eye.
to take these risks. You chose not to believe him when he told you, showed you, that he wouldn’t change for you. The two of you made your bed and now you’ll have to lay in it, but the children are innocents." Virgina echoed her grim thoughts. “It's them I pity. If you turn your back on them because your pride is injured, so help me you don’t want to see what
"Steve, you can’t think it was anything more than a job. Stark seems a decent enough fellow, I'll give him that, and he's not done wrong by the kids. But I'd put money down that he’s long gone before you even make it home.”
"Why are these people here?" Tony asked, pausing before a cell that contained a group of frightened individuals with dirty faces, including a young man cradling a girl in a bloodied nightgown.
“Your friends are out there throwing away their lives, but it won’t matter. You’re dying Rogers.”
“You want to give it a shot Mr. Strongman?”
"Yet." Bucky grumbled and Steve nodded gravely.
“Natacha…” he reached for her but she backed away.
He arrived later than usual to breakfast, unsurprised to find that Bakhuizen and the captain were already settled with the children, the captain perusing the morning paper with the same constipated expression that he always reserved for that mornings dose of fear mongering and government issued propaganda. Tony didn’t know why he bothered with it at all, if it put him in such a bad mood but he supposed a man of Stefen’s station felt he needed to stay informed. Tony reserved the right to tease him about it anyway.
She pulled her hand away to brush it through her hair, her expression thoughtful.
"It'll only be a minute Péter. We just haven't had much of a chance to talk." There was nothing accusatory in Tony's tone but Péter still felt the need to explain himself.
The drive to St. Péter's took entirely too long for Tony's comfort. Hogan came out quickly, barely having shrugged a coat on over his nightshirt, and Pepper was just a step behind with a pair of coats for him and Péter, but with every second of time wasted lowering Stefen's chances of recovery it felt like a year of agony.
"What is all this for?” She asked, meeting Tony’s forced cheer with suspicion.
Stefen laughed so hard his belly hurt.
They'd stopped at a shop for a late lunch and they'd been halfway through the meal before they'd been approached by Jessika Duerr.
On the fifth day, the city of Nice came into view on the coastline. Even shrouded in mist from the constant rain it looked beautiful. Tony would have braved an entire naval blockade to get out in the fresh air. The brothers, who were closest to the cabin window facing the coastline had stood up to alert the others, elated at the sight of land and the end of their journey. Through the walls Tony could hear the captain talking on his radio, giving someone on the other end his clearance codes; but then came the now too familiar roar in the sky from an approaching plane. And suddenly, the air around them ripped open.
The others followed him without further complaint but Péter could feel their eyes on him as they cycled through town.
"I’ll speak with you later Nigel, you understand?” Steve didn’t ask it like a real question, so all Nigel could do really was nod and offer his meek agreement as Steve turned away, but not before catching Tony's eye and making a face when he saw the way the monk was rolling his eyes.

“Or spiders?” Tony guessed with an arched brow, thinking back to the surprise that had greeted him when he’d first arrived. Péter’s smile fell and the boy nodded begrudgingly.
Cap righted him with a chuckle, easily supporting most of his weight.
"Maybe that’s best.  I won't tarnish your good sense by suggesting you escort me."
“Stefen,” Tony’s voice prodded him to look up at him. “You have to trust me. I will be fine. We’re all going to make it out of here together.”
“What’s wrong
But whatever Ian would have confessed Péter didn't let him finish, pushing back his chair with a violent scrape against the floor as he stood up to growl.
Wordlessly Steve grabbed the open kit and knelt down with it in hand. He knew he was pushing his luck, knelt practically between his legs, but Tony had invited him in and Steve wasn’t above taking advantage of the opening. It was an incredibly intimate position, but for the first time the proximity didn’t inspire the ever-present hum of want beneath Steve’s skin.
“Well Herr Wiess is going to return someday and the captain has promised him a big celebration party, because that will be a fine day. Won’t it?”
“Tell Nonno he has an excellent head for wines.” He commented, leaning down to smack a kiss against her wrinkled cheek. He snuck a glance at the photo in her hands, stiffening slightly when he realized it was a faded photo of his mother, holding a swaddled infant that he could only presume was himself.
“I’m here.” Tony murmured into his ear, holding tighter. “You were wonderful.”
"Damn.” He cursed under his breath. “November the fifteenth?"
“You want me to keep father from realizing that the three of you are gone for
“Tony?” The young man questioned timidly beside him, and Tony squeezed his shoulder before leading the way to the door to the hall.
Something was wrong Steve thought even as part of him wanted to howl and laugh at the same time- because
“When she was dying…I think she knew that Peggy would catch the fever after her. I don’t know where she found the strength, but she said she didn’t want me to walk alone, and then she cut the coins from her neck and made me take them.”
Stefen held himself tightly, his nerves palpable in the slight space between their shoulders. He held his gaze away from Tony, and Tony followed it to the compass Stefen still held between his hands, to the black and white picture of his family on the picnic blanket. The captain stared into the picture as if it held all the answers, and Tony wondered if he wasn’t searching there because the gift had something to do with his family. He didn’t know how that could be either. It was all very mysterious. Tony had made him the compass so that he wouldn’t lose himself again. But why had Stefen made him this?
“Quiet, Cap, just rest will you.” Tony scattered his frantic thoughts. “You’d think you’d want to, what with just escaping death and everything." He smiled when he said it, but Steve could hear the way Tony’s voice shook. Real. That was real wasn’t it? Illusions didn’t have those kinds of faults, did they?
“Where do ya want me?” he asked, straightening and Tony gestured with his free hand toward Stefen’s legs, tangled in his blankets.
Take the bucket. Take the bucket, not me.
"Money can buy a man a lot of things." Stefen answered cryptically, but Tony didn’t need a straight answer from him. He already knew the truth, and it was… flooring to say the least.
“I'll swim with you. I promise. Bucky and I just have to finish setting up camp first.”
He let out a slightly hysterical giggle. Captain Rogers had been a mountain trooper, part of the troops who’d filtered in through the hills to use the Italians as target practice. Irony was a cruel mistress. Despite the fact that he’d been picking off his mother’s people at the time, a small part of Tony couldn’t help but be impressed that Rogers had survived at all let alone performed feats as daring as the ones that had earned him those metals. The winters were unforgiving in the mountains. Tony had been tucked away in the monastery by then, hidden away and forgotten while his countrymen had bled into the snow.
“Maybe it’s better if you just open it.”
“Oh go on Tacha, we beat you fair and square this time,” Péter immediately protested and Natacha looked like she was barely resisting wrestling him until he cried uncle the way she had when they were younger.
“Tony?”
With a start Tony paused mid swing of his ax, his eyes narrowing on Ian.
“Later.”
Instead of an answer Stefen’s mouth descended over his again, capturing his lips in a punishing kiss that stole Tony’s breath. Still, his poor lungs tried, sucking in a sharp breath when Stefen’s hand brushed against his cock still trapped in his open slacks. The heat of Stefen’s palm seeped through Tony’s cotton briefs as he stroked and squeezed in a fumbling fashion that betrayed his inexperience but Tony couldn’t care for all the world.
"Listen! "Bucky barked, batting away Tony’s hands only to grab him both arms again and shake him.  "He's fine. Just stay out of shit that aint your business! I don't care how great a lay you are, I catch you snooping around again and you're going to be real sorry you ever saw my face. Do you understand me, Stark?!"
“It’s about the fact that from the time we were small we were told this was something we should not want. You will have emotions about that, whether you’ve taken the time to consider them or not.” Tony insisted, knocking Stefen pointedly with his knee in place of knocking him over the head.
Two weeks. Tony’s thoughts began to pick up speed. They had two weeks to rescue Lucas and the two doctors, and somehow without Stefen there to lead.
“Only if you will.” Tony returned.
And as his eyes flickered to Ian sitting with wide eyes next to his tutor, his eyes round with an all too revealing level of distress, Bucky clenched his hand tightly upon his spoon, thinking that Stark was mistaken if he thought Bucky wouldn't bury another one.
Tony was already up, scooping his spilled glass off the floor with shaking hands.
“Thank you. She had to leave her toys behind.” The woman explained in a soft voice. She bent down and whispered to the girl encouragingly, “What do you say to the nice man Becca?”
“Heads will roll if any harm comes to me!” he shrieked unnecessarily. The two soldiers examined the papers in a rush, their eyes continuously drawn back toward the camp where smoke and shouts continued to rise. Tony saw immediately the moment they decided not to risk delaying his exit with further questions.
But Bucky never finished the thought because at that moment James broke the silence, voice low but firm… insistent.
And still, Tony had wanted to be with them. He had been young once too and despite all his protests to the contrary he had occasionally cared about something other than himself. But Tony’s father had forbidden it and he had practically kept Tony under lock and key that year- finally sending him away altogether before his eighteenth birthday could arrive and Tony would be old enough to legally enlist.
Tony was surprised Ian didn't shrink from the sudden onslaught, all three turning on him at once. Morons.  He took a step forward but was stopped when Stefen, who'd given the simplest of answers, amended as Ian’s eyes widened in fear.
What did it matter if he told? Da knew how to handle anything, he'd help make it better. Still his father was in a very talkative mood for once and Ian didn’t want to ruin it.
“How did you get in here?” Tony demanded to know as Barton swung his way down from the rafters, kicking up a cloud of dust as he landed. Tony had designed the locks on the door himself so that he could lock it from within as well as without. So he was a little peeved that the Abbot’s favorite minion had somehow managed to find his way inside.
The children did not see Tony for the rest of the afternoon or even at dinner, though the maids heard all manner of banging and clanging coming from the garage. Pepper would not tell them where he had gone, but they heard her mumbling to one of the maids something about curtains and frogs.
As the day marched on, it became more obvious to Tony what a last resort their coming up here always had been. They couldn’t be seen and yet, their survival for any lengthy period of time depended on venturing outdoors. Darting in and out to relieve themselves was one thing, but there were other needs that would make themselves known sooner rather than later.
Silly.
Tony gestured towards the stately couches lining both walls and the matching sitting chairs. He was glad to see that despite how little used the room was the maids were meticulous in their dusting and polishing. As the children trickled out of formation to find spots for themselves Tony moved to stand at the front of the piano in the center of the room and waited once more for quiet.
fondness. Tony wasn’t imagining it. He wasn’t making it up now, and he hadn’t been making it up those times in the garden or that night camping in the woods either. His heart fluttered in his chest, remembering how close they’d stood, how close Tony had come to kissing him. Stefen hadn’t moved away. He’d told himself it couldn’t mean anything but now he wasn’t so sure.
with Rogers. He’d either been drunk or sunk to the level of exhaustion only achieved when sleep and regular meals were a distant memory. Tony should know, he was well experienced with it. If it truly had just been weariness that ailed the captain Tony had to wonder what sort of matters Rogers was involved in that could leave him in such a state.
But maybe that was just fine, Stefen thought as Bucky hugged him back. They had never really needed words.
“But you know better,” he teased turning back to watch the boys as they tired of their play and dragged themselves from the creek.
But first things first. Another tutor was in order.
"Tacha’s right!" Bakhuizen clapped his hands together eagerly. "James, stop teasing Ian and come help me look for twigs for the snares."
and there wasn’t a second to spare! Fowlers Solution was an arsenical-tonic, and Tony used the word tonic loosely. At least the mustard gas had been engineered to kill and made no pretenses otherwise.
They soaked it up the kids. Bucky could tell that they were nervous, but they were excited too – so damn eager to get out on stage and strut their stuff and it was Tony who had given them that confidence.  It was Tony who had given them music and somewhere out in that crowd their father was watching them, probably ready to crawl out of his skin but the fact that they were here at all without Steve pulling something drastic… that was because Stefen trusted Tony.
He wouldn't give up that easy! He had to know if Tony had made it out of the crash.
“There’s gonna be a parade to welcome Commander Goering and Von Brauchitsch to Vienna” his father told him after a moment.
“He’s got the shakes.” Tony said stupidly. Bakhuizen must know, but what else was there to say.
Bakhuizen and Stefen were standing over the captain’s desk, looking over what might have been a map but was hard to discern because at his sudden entry both men moved to block it from view. Bakhuizen’s face cycled through horrified surprise to anger in a frankly hilarious fashion but Tony kept his amusement to himself as Stefen snapped, “Stark, there better be a good reason for this interruption.”
Péter backed away from their splashes, looking unimpressed that fate had saddled him with these two for younger brothers.
The doctor had the syringe in hand again and was clearly meaning to administer the drug, whatever it might be, but the housekeeper had somehow managed to wedge herself halfway between Fischer and the bed, one hand gripping the doctor's arm and the other thrown over her employer. Fischer looked as if he might strike her out of the way any moment.
“No I’m not.” Péter insisted right back, becoming frustrated. They were certainly all awake now staring between him and Péter with nervous expressions. The dark haired boy was frowning intensely at Tony as he grabbed the open journal on his desk and began to scribble out the equation. “Apples come in crates of ten, there are four crates per delivery so that’s forty. Deliveries occur twice a week so that’s eighty apples a week. There are approximately four weeks in a month, plus the two we started with. Three hundred-twenty two. See?”
November 1938 was a hell of an important month. That said
“Light up whole cities for years. A reactor with that kind of energy output could change the face of the planet. Think about what we could do with that!”
Together they would get this done and after it was over, then he could go home.
“What have I told you about watching that mouth of yours huh? You know words can really hurt people.”
“This is the major’s place. As far as you’re going.”  The dairy man grunted unnecessarily from the end of the truck bed. His lad was already scrambling up to help him begin unloading the heavy crates of fresh milk.
~*~8~*~
“Perhaps this isn’t the best topic over breakfast,” Stefen acknowledged ruefully.
“Who is we?” Steve asked.
Tony was long gone from the hallway but Steve’s mind eagerly supplied dozens of phantom whispers.
The door swung open and Tony stumbled back one arm wheeling to keep himself steady. A tall thin man peered at him from beside the door, scrunching his eyes and doing, what Tony thought, was a very good impression of a weasel.
He wanted done with this farce, and to speak urgently about the letter. But they’d had not a single moment alone all evening in which he could safely bring it up, so when she’d asked him to dance he’d agreed before he could really think about what that entailed. He hadn’t danced with a woman since Peggy. Hadn’t wanted to and still didn’t.
“Sometimes I wonder why you bother with balls and gay parties at all Stefen. You seem so bored by them.”
He made a gesture at Tony’s face and Tony lifted an eyebrow, waiting.
"That’s enough Tony" Steve snapped but Tony didn’t budge. His eyes flashed.
When she had still not appeared a few minutes later he resolved himself to going and having a look. But just as he opened the doors two women exited, deep in an intensely whispered conversation. Tony stepped back to allow them to pass. They were
Steve wondered briefly on the state of his hair before he realized what it had to mean. He just barely resisted the urge to roll his eyes heavenward. The telegram, Osborne, how could he have forgotten?
“Leave it? You’re telling me someone ratted on us and you’re sticking up for a fucking spy!” Bucky hollered and Steve opened his mouth with the full intent to retort, but he halted when he felt Tony’s hand on his arm and let the monk push him aside, dumbfounded as he stepped toward where Bucky stood with a low growl.
He was disrupted from his rambling thoughts by a particularly boisterous boom of thunder. Maria dove beneath the covers and Sara’s face scrunched up with the threat of more tears as her hands flew to cover her ears.
“Father doesn't like us to sing.” she scolded.
"Ha. Told you!" James crowed, sticking his tongue out at his brother and just when Tony feared things were about to dissolve into more fighting between the two, Artur spotted him in the door way.
“I fell.” She answered coolly and Steve shook Tony’s hand free.
“You disagree Herr Stark?”
“Alright, you've not been in the water all afternoon.” He said giving them another look over.
which means ‘not rom’, and they expelled her from the familia. Her father Ian refused to leave her, because she was his last living blood and for rom to travel alone means death. Other rom will know you have been exiled and shun you, and the true gadje will continue to shun you as they always have.
"It was one missed shot shit head, and I was hanging out the side of a truck!" Bucky barked back.
He clenched his jaw, suddenly irritated with himself and unfolded his napkin, snapping it with more force than was strictly necessary.
It was like a dream, the music coaxed from the belly of the piano thrumming through his fingertips and traveling up his arms. He slowly eased into a few scales and then with the embarrassing hesitation of a bride groom he began to play. The music wrapping around him and drowning out the residue of dark thoughts and fear that seemed to hover about him of late. He knew the song by heart, could have played it in his sleep.
With a sense of dread Steve sniped open the envelope, dreading its contents. It was the same as before. Steve flicked through the letter his stomach dropping with each line.
Steve could still smell the blood and could still see the open intestine, the way it looked lying in the snow. Grotesquely pretty. He and another soldier had helped hold the ribbons of organs in while a field medic stitched him into one piece for travel.
"Better yet, bambina, why don't you just lay your head here on your Father's shoulder and have a good cry." Tony could have laughed at the alarmed expression that leapt onto the captain's face as he deposited the crying child into his arms.
The sun had come out again for the third day in a row. The snow had melted off the trees and become a thin layer of slush on the ground. There was a sweetness to the crisp air now with every breath, the breeze bringing that subtle hint of growing things. Winter was giving steadily away to the advance of spring, and with its retreat the mountain was coming to life around them.
Jesus, his little voice was tiny in the morning. Bucky dropped his head into his hands and snickered lightly to himself. He was finally beginning to understand his own father better.
“Herr Stark...” He seemed unable to summon the right words, his lips pressed tight and eyes hard.
“Yes”.
He’d never been so relieved when it happened, not wanting to imagine what might have eventually become of his friend had Steve continued to go on as he had been: pouring all that he had into the rebuild of Austria and forgetting how to live.
“The doctor said that public education would be too stressful on my heart,” Péter mumbled in reply.
VOICE: The life of the world, its conflicts and achievements, its news and fun, its leaders and its common people.
When you can, please let us know what you think. It means everything.
Péter stared back at him in a daze, his mouth falling slightly open once more in shock and Steve chuckled lowly.
Captain Rogers muttered something in that unfamiliar language again but whatever he said it was obvious he wanted Tony to know, the captain’s eyes boring into his.
“No speaking!” A guard shouted by the door. The water suddenly cut out and the prisoners shuffled like pale wet mice to the sides, parting for the two guards who charged in. One snagged Steve by the back of his neck and threw him off balance. The other snatched the man behind him, the one who had warned them to be quiet. Steve went without protest as the Krippo dragged, scraping his shins against the floor. Without warning his face was shoved into the ground, grime and dirt grating against his sensitive skin as the hand gripping his skull smeared it back and forth. The guards yelled above him, and then there was white hot pain exploding over his back, knocking the air from his lungs.
“I need the air,” Steve snapped before he could finish. He felt their eyes on him all the way to the door.
Come to think of it Steve wasn't sure the younger children had any swim clothes that still fit.
as if Tony could have left the bed without leaving his heart behind – some broken mess of a thing on the sheets.
~*~*~
She had a superb chest though, which heaved when she sang. Tony, during one of those rare events where Farkas had let him out of the abbey to travel among a contingent of brothers set out to lend aid to the poor and hear the woes of the people (or something of that accord, Tony had been more concerned with how quickly he could slip free) had gotten the chance to see her sing in just such a lounge a number of years ago. Admittedly he'd not paid much attention to her voice so he couldn't begrudge the woman too much of her stardom.
His heart hammering within his chest Tony was certain the captain meant to strike the boy and he had the fleeting thought to jump between them, but quickly discarded the thought as foolish. One did not jump between a charging bull and the cloak. Better to take the cloak away from foolish matador.
It was clear by the plainness of her clothes and the rough twang in her speech that she did not come from a family of means like they did, which Johann spent most the afternoon sneering not so subtly about, but she gave as good as she got and didn’t seem to think highly of his intelligence.  Harry seemed to find her and her antics with Johann humorous but Péter wondered if that wasn’t just because Gwen looked very pretty that day and was allowing him to hold her hand.
The room Tony knew was normally tidy even though it was inhibited by the three youngest boys. However, Ian sat in the middle of what looked like a bomb site. Everything clothes, books, toy figurines, even the bed sheets, were thrown about. If the dresser could have been dislodged Tony was sure it would have been across the room in smithereens.
He looked over at Natacha, observing the practiced motion of her needles. She had gotten incredibly accomplished at knitting, though he’d never have guessed it would be something she enjoyed so much. Then again, he’d never have guessed that she’d be prepared to take a man’s life at barely fourteen years of age either.
“They’re very sensible like good little Austrians Maria, and Artur you’re correct. We have ourselves a fine young man here to add to our habitat.”
But Bucky was still scowling darkly at him and not moving like Tony needed him to. Péter, finished extinguishing the flames, dropped the scoop and moved to help but he jerked to a halt when Tony snapped his fingers loudly and barked with a shake of his head.
His attacker didn't move, in fact his attacker might as well have been made of marble. Tony blinked and coughed out a breath, trying to quiet his racing heartbeat as he and Captain Rogers stared at each other.
He swung the door open, only for young James to come falling in. The boy landed with a squall, looking very affronted at the floor. He looked up, face heated with temper and embarrassment for a moment before his eyes met Tony and froze. His face contorted for a moment and then he was scrambling up off the floor and hurling himself against Tony. Tony staggered back as the unexpected weight unbalanced him, and he narrowly missed being trampled by Artur and Maria as they came hurtling in only a few beats behind. Both were out of breath, red faced and babbling their voices ringing in Tony’s ears but he could not have cared less.
“Because I gave him permission to Captain.” She held his stare though the tight grip of one hand on her wrist betrayed her nervousness.
There were no guarantees. The only way anyone could assure that something like what had happened that awful night didn't happen again, was if the Reich was taken down. Tony could help with that by going to Dachau and rescuing the resistance members before their execution, making sure the information they carried got into the right hands.
Steve’s breath hitched and he gritted his teeth against the swell of pain in his chest. His leg throbbed underneath him and he eyed his desk chair consideringly.
“But as a friend, Tony, I’m warning you that certain claims have been made against you and Captain Rogers. Things are being discussed in the High Command that would make it a mistake for either of you to stay in Austria. They know you have powerful friends, so when they find their evidence they’ll move quickly.”
But they didn’t need to know the hairy details. Let them think he’d failed due to lack of aptitude.
Pietro talked more than his sister. He talked really fast actually when you got him going. He liked to tell wild stories and didn't seem to mind being badgered by the little ones constant questions or requests to play.
It was a few moments more before there was a gentle knock on the door, and Bucky crossed the room to let the arrivals in.
“Get out! I want you out of my house.” Hammer was screeching, and Tony rolled his eyes, but then Hammer’s voice was too close, his hot beer-soaked breath breathing down Tony’s neck. “Did you hear what I said,
“On one condition.”
“Yes,” Péter scoffed impatiently, “but father could finance us. He has loads of money.”
Still his heart was pounding as he considered the stone façade of the butcher’s shop, number thirteen, and the peeling paint on the back door.
“I know. I know that.” Steve replied numbly. Defeated. Accepting. Damn him for that.
“Come now, I would you take my hand, Captain.” The prince demanded and Steve did, feeling a bit as if he were in a daze. This was unheard of. For all that Steve was something of a celebrity he was still just a common soldier from Leopoldstad. He might be paraded around royalty like a favorite toy but he was far from it and for the prince to shake his hand… he felt and embarrassing heat creep up his neck and the prince’s smile was knowing as he shook Steve’s hand with vigor.
Tony grinned.
“But aren’t we his family?” Maria’s small voice pleaded, and it broke Tony’s heart to see the tears dampening her cheeks.
Steve pushes back into him instinctively and Tony murmurs something soft and maybe obscene. It is hard for Steve to focus over the burning sensation overtaking his body. Just like that day in Berlin. It’s strange to know that he is dreaming even as he dreams. It is dawn somewhere out there. He didn’t have to open his eyes to know, could feel it in his bones, but he didn’t want to open them anyway. He wanted to stay there in the room with Tony just a while longer.
“Brother Filip left after you did. Turns out he was only there to get in touch with the Vatican but now he’s needed more on the outside. The Abbot still lets me help him so long as I come back in one piece.” Clint explained with a bored shrug and Tony blinked in surprise. Well, he was more surprised at his surprise really. He’d always suspected Farkas was running an order of spies under those priestly robes and Coulson had always been his right hand.
“Yes, please!” Ian blurted and then tried to school his features according to a soldier. He must have failed because Da chuckled.
They were dressed simply in the kind of clothing any school aged child would wear, but the sight they made still struck Tony as wrong somehow. It was the way their clothing hung off their bodies, their thin faces betraying the poor diets that their nice attire tried to hide. It was not the nature of their times to be forgiving of dark features, and the children had a distinctly Slavic look about them.
It certainly didn’t stop her being anxious as the vehicles carrying Stefen and his children pulled up the drive. It was not every day you met the children of the man you intended to marry.
“I don’t think your monk likes me very much.” She commented, sure to keep her tone light and teasing. Stefen blinked at her as if he had no idea what she was talking about.
“I was just telling Ian that I was about his age when I learned to swim. You wouldn’t mind helping me teach the boys would you?”
“Finish.” Stefen urged with a low rasp and Tony swallowed to moisten his mouth and did just that.
There was even a good-sized crate plopped into the middle of the room that Hammer and Hogan were attempting to pry open with a crow bar.
It was damn stupid to admit to anyone how unstable he was. A complaint from Stark to the authorities was all it would take and Stevie would have a one-way trip to the mad house. It had happened to other soldiers who couldn’t hack it after the war ended. Schmidt would probably stamp the damn papers himself.
He was so warm in Steve’s arms his body heat seeping through his clothes and warming the chill Steve hadn’t been able to shake even though they’d been indoors for hours. His hands were so strong, his grip fierce as his hands came up to hold Steve’s face and pull him close.
Steve shot him a puzzled look and straightened.
Tony observed the spark of awareness in his eyes when Tony gave his last name, but Pike didn’t comment on it. It was Stefen’s hand he held the longest, and Captain Rogers whom he took his time measuring with silent appraisal after.
A minute or so later his Major jogged up next to him, looking energized and fresh for all the world as if he’d only been having a brisk walk as his eyes continued peeling over their soldiers. Frank snorted, it was fucking unfair was what that was.
Bucky had grumbled something about Rogers and their stubbornness while Steve had tried not to laugh. Stark had just looked smug.
Herr Stark stared at him. Péter had never felt more like one of Artur’s beetles, Tony’s eyes pinning him in place. Swallowing back the lump logged in his throat Péter didn’t back down. He stood straight, head lifted proudly the way he’d seen his father do so many times and stood his ground.
“They accepted the risks. A chance at freedom is better than none.” Wolfe snapped back, brow furrowing as he took in what Tony was doing. “What is that?”
The shouting out in the hall had picked up again. She distinctly heard Frau Hogan and Charlotte, and now Bucky's sleep heavy voice was leaking in through the door left ajar, making harsh demands. She wished she could block them all out, that they'd all just be silent for once. All they did was talk. Nobody ever did anything to make the things they shouted about
“I have a favor, two favors to ask of you. I’ve been invited, commanded really, to attend a dinner in Berlin. Anton Vankov is the guest of honor, he is a chief researcher in the Ahnenerbe. They’ve returned from an expedition in Italy -” he faltered slightly, noticing the dark expression that had taken residence on Tony’s face. His eyes searched Tony’s a moment more. “Are you familiar with Herr Vonkov’s work?”
“Butterflies are caterpillars before they become butterflies
Jaw tightening Steve resisted the urge to check the pocket of his jacket for his pistol. It was there. He was ready if those men came back. They were sitting targets out here.
Tony sighed, deliberating for a moment before crossing the room to open the door for him. Péter quickly stepped inside, so geared up to say something that at first he didn’t appear to notice the workshop at all.
Tony half smiled, setting aside the empty mug of wine he still held.
“Think of it as a little advice. False hope kills quicker than anything else Captain. Though it is fascinating to watch it's killing strike, don't you think?” The General straightened to his full height, the lively gracefulness returning to his movements. He clapped his hands together cheerfully and it was only years of training that kept Steve from lashing out in surprise, he was wound so tight.
Though dragged out was a better term for it, because even from a distance Dvorak could see the man barely had enough strength to hold himself up and his body was a patchwork of wounds and livid bruises. He did not look like a hero now, and that was likely for the benefit of the crowd of locals who had come from the village at the first sign of spectacle, their hands and faces pressed against the chained fence that surrounded the camp to catch a glimpse of public enemy number one as he was loaded into the back of the truck.
After making sure that his grandfather’s leg wasn’t bothering him enough to inhibit him making it home on his own – Nonno flapped his hands and griped about being treated like an old man – Tony left him and took a cab to the one place in the city he had avoided until now. Home.
“Yes, it won’t be good for the children to stay.” Natacha agreed calmly, looking the maid steadily in the eye as she spoke. “Make sure you pack Sara’s bear, and Maria won’t sleep in a new house unless she’s with Artur. You’ll tell Julia to send word with them wherever they’re going?”
“When will they execute them?” Stefen was asking.
“Very good. Now run inside and wash up. None of you’d better dare bring dirty hands or faces to Frau Hogan’s table. She might skin you.”
Anya and Péter shared wide eyed looks of fright and Tony wondered if they’d even understood the Captain’s words. Péter clutched his sister’s hands tightly and drew her backward and Pepper’s eyes flew to the captain anxiously.
It was a copy of “
"I’m sure they’ve just gone to bed early," he consoled, patting Péter on the back encouragingly, and by unspoken agreement they picked up the pace, hurrying down the road to reach home.
“Cameron took a fall, but he’ll be alright. Virginia, if you could?”
Rogers cleared his throat again and shook his head and Tony could only stare at him in bewilderment.
"That is..." Tony, most unusually, found himself at a loss for words and wholly uncomfortable. He had no idea how they'd gotten from the subject of Bakhuizen onto marriage but he did not like it.
Breath hitching Steve thought with dizzy delight that Tony could probably do it too. Despite Bucky’s constant jabs Tony wasn’t particularly small and he was strong. Steve wanted him to try, at least.
That's it lovlies. See you at the end of the tunnel.
"What happens to the children if something happens to you?"
He could see the way they balked at his presence. Even his oldest were uneasy around him. It tore at him, kept him up at night, the distance that gaped between them... but it was necessary. He had no time to make them understand. They were too young to understand the dangers of the world they found themselves in and as far as Steve was concerned the less they knew the better.
“Children,” she sighed, and six pairs of worried eyes fixed on her. “There’s something you need to know.”
Tony got the bright idea to go see the abbot, yes right then and there because he insisted he needed to be
Stupid man. Stupid wonderful man, Tony thought with an unbidden smile tugging at his mouth. He tucked the letter back in its envelope and frowned at the second letter, noting again the Naval seal and trying to ignore the apprehension prickling his skin as he tore it open and read.
Later that night Tony found himself in the kitchen attempting to make a nightcap (and having about as much success as one could expect in a home kitchen) with Willamina’s help when the back door burst open. He jumped, spilling and scalding himself on the hot milk Willimina had beat into foam, cursing his own jumpiness.
Without looking away from the rifle Tony pawed at Stef’s arm until he dropped the apple into his outstretched hand. He took a large bite, juggling the rifle and apple as he did. A bit of juice ran down his chin and he dropped the apple back into Stefen’s lap, licking the residue from his lips and whiping his hand on his trousers.
“James.”
Peggy had been so frail at the end; a shell of the beautiful vivacious woman Charlotte had looked up to her whole life.
That done, and not one to mince words, Steve turned to Lt. Becker and commanded, "Take your squad and move out."
Tony’s blood ran cold.
“Are you sure?” Stefen rasped hoarsely in reply. He was trembling Tony noted. There was something volcanic inside of him, a pain that had built and built and had nowhere to go but outward. Any doubt that Stefen had suffered as much as he had over their separation was washed away.
“Have you been there?” She asked, injected some of Artur’s youthful enthusiasm into her voice and as if compelled, Rita Göring huffed a laugh.
“They’re all men and women I’ve known Tony. They’re all Jews, and they’ve all been arrested and killed, the same way you will be if you don’t get your head on straight.”
“I mentioned, Hermann, that I knew the late Hughard Stark.” Vonkov explained and Hermann’s eyes widened, flying to Tony. Steve tensed, anticipating the coming of the very thing he was trying so hard to prevent.
He wasn’t really there, no matter how much Steve wanted him to be. He knew that. Tony was gone - Oh god! Tony wasn’t there because he was at Dachau. In a ditch, body burnt beyond all recognition.
“She’s half Siamese you know.” A smoky voice whispered far too close to Tony’s ear and he jumped. The woman who’d been watching him had gotten up from her table and was leaning toward him with one hip propped against the piano, a smug smile stretching her wrinkled mouth.
“Tony, please.”
Bucky smiled sadly, and reached out to tug on the end of one of her dripping braids.
They’d eaten together at the breakfast nook, or rather Tony had guzzled coffee while Stefen mostly read the letters Péter had written from school, while accepting bites of Tony’s food. When the captain had finally read and reread all of them he’d tucked them away in his trunks and asked how Tony had decided they should spend their free day.
Steve gestured at Starks face. “As you can see he’s all right, but I ought to be the one that brings him ic-”
Sara had also fallen asleep, albeit in Tony’s arms. He sat with her head resting on his shoulder, warm breath tickling his neck, and watched with a stony expression as Stefen held court with Baroness Schrader.
“Then we’ll drown together. I’ve got you.”
Wanda was sitting by herself on the bank, her legs dangling in the water as she stared out over the lake with a blank expression.
“How?” Péter immediately demanded to know, eyes widening in awe.
Truths that did not dissipate just because you hit something hard enough. Steve needed Tony. He’d always need Tony.
“When do they play?” Tony heard himself ask. So much for keeping his mouth shut. The Captain hesitated.
"While I'm sure we're all very excited, sit back down and eat. I for one refuse to be seen in Vienna with children who don't know how to behave at table."
Perhaps not so French as all that, though her command of the language was admirable for one so young. He switched back to German, his lips quirking indulgently. Perhaps Rogers could be convinced to patron the girl. Once the unit was moved to Czechoslovakia Rene could use a playmate. They seemed to be about the same age.
"What other reason could you have?" Steve cut in, but Tony held up a hand to stop him and Steve snapped his mouth shut with a painful click.
“Péter?” Fire flicked at Steve's throat, but he pushed past the pain to ask again “Péter, ar- are you alright.”
“Don’t you think you should be asking their father first?” A voice called out over the excited young voices and they all went silent turning to watch as the Captain approached them. Tony’s eyebrows shot up, because after how vehemently against the whole affair Stefen had been to begin with, it had not surprised Tony any that he hadn’t come with Pepper to see them off.
Neuman slid a sealed envelope stamped with the official crest of the kriegsmarine across the desk.
Péter found Pietro first, but the other boy was caught up in a game of catch the chicken with Ian and the younger boys. Pietro was the prized chicken giving the other boys the slip.
Stefen, unbothered by the seeking tone, cocked his head in a playful tilt.
Stiffening Tony pointed out, “I wasn't asking.”
"Thank you for telling me."
“No, if I’m to be frank.” Tony answered stepping toward him.
Some unknowable point later Stefen made noise that might have been about getting out of the water but James demanded to come with. Stefen obliged and after wading a ways turned track, effortlessly lifted himself out of the water and Tony caught his breath.
And then he’d screamed, uncaring of who might hear or what the household might think if they did. Damn them all. Damn the whole house and damn Captain Rogers most of all. Rogers should be here. He should be there to clean up this
"You both stick to the plan alright? Or so help me! You could get us all killed if you try and take things into your own hands like you're always doing with Stevie."
The hunger for this particular type of assurance was keen. Evident in the way passerby on their street had stopped to gawk and point as the children had arrived with James. Charlotte could do nothing after the fact at their ramshackle rumpled appearance and the noise they'd made upon their arrival but exhaustion from travel and excitement from the prospect of reuniting with their father could be blamed. That and the lack of a proper nanny.
He couldn’t help but think once more on Hammer's ominous absence, and his eyes darted down to the white envelope she’d tucked into the pocket of her coat. Peggy had always given the staff their Christmas bonus at the door with a wink and a promise to have all the fun they could in the new year.
"Hardly," Péter groused, jerking his chin up, an edge of hurt creeping back into his tone. "I don't know anything about being gypsy."
“You should take her.”
To say that Tony had questions about the contradiction in the captain’s words or the strange circumstances that had led to the arrival of their guests was an understatement, but Stefen's tone did not invite further inquiry and challenging him in the front hall in front of his staff was no sound strategy.
“Yes, Herr Stark?” He looked earnest as a beaver, all red hair and blue eyes, and suddenly Tony could see so much of the captain in him that it was curious how quickly he melted.
~*~*~
The sun was setting by the time the pot had reached a steady boil. Tony tossed the spiced meat and vegetables into its roiling depths and closed the lid confident that if not the fanciest of fare it would do the trick.
There were plans to make, and old ones he’d let gather dust that were just waiting for him to execute them. The children must be safe. They came first before anything else.
“Major, are you in there?”
She didn't say anything and neither did he, suddenly choked up by the return of tears. He was awful glad to see her again. He hadn't realized how much until this very moment. He hugged her back, squeezing hard, only managing a numb nod of acknowledgment as Harold put arms around them both and held them tight.
“She’s a beautiful child, isn’t she?”
If it didn’t (and there was so much, so much, that could go wrong) at best, they would incite the very war they were desperate to stop. And that was the very least of the consequences.
“I’ve got her,” a deep familiar voice said, and then new hands were gripping her by the arms and Willamina’s slid away. “Come on Ginger.”
Buckenhof tavern was like any other country pub. Clean but quaint, serving good beer and dinners that stuck to your gut and kept out the chill. He didn’t have much coin on him, but he spared some to buy a liter and ease the bartender into conversation enough to relax his suspicious gaze. They likely didn’t get many travelers through their town and now was not an opportune time to be making friendly with strange folks. But since Bucky’s wallet was good and business was business, if the barkeep had any suspicions, he kept them to himself.
“Surely it’s safe enough if we keep an eye on them?” Tony protested. “They seemed rather excited about the idea of ice skating.”
“How can I? I don’t support every decision the man makes, or else I wouldn’t be here. But we should do right by our people is what I’m saying. Even Hitler isn’t wrong about everything.”
“There wasn’t time to collect it.” The doctor admitted stiffly. Dvorak frowned, suitably unimpressed.
"But we'll be leaving soon. Charlotte and I will marry after the Holiday -" Steve saw her eyes widen out of the corner of his eye, but he kept on. She'd agree because they had no other choice.
They did indeed find Pepper in the nursery with the girls and little Artur, all freshly bathed and scrubbed pink, dressed for bed despite not having yet had their supper.  At the sight of him Artur shrank back and Tony’s heart twisted in his chest but he barely had time to process the emotion he felt because Sara slipped off of Pepper’s lap and toddled across the room like a miniature missile to throw her arms around his knees. After a moment’s deliberation Maria rushed to do the same and Artur was on her heels like a shadow.
"Of course, there's no way to stop it from picking up foreign frequencies and the like." Tony quickly turned the dial so the transmission went silent.
“Did you find –“James began to ask, lifting himself up off the floor, but Steve cut him off, his eyes snapping to Grig as he demanded to know where Péter and Natacha were.
But the boy was gaping at him, his raw voice cracking around a single befuddled utterance.
Steve sat back in his chair, tilting his head back to stare up at the ceiling as he forced his breathing to remain slow and even. He’d find her, he thought gritting his teeth, because he had to. Because he couldn’t lose any more.
“Bucky has gone to get their travel papers.” Stefen answered after a long pause with a slight nod. “He is supposed to be back today. We’ll set out as soon as he arrives. Virginia, I’ll need those supplies.”
Her father looked equal parts flummoxed and suspicious, but a slow smile was blooming on her mother’s face.
Tony disappeared towards the front doors determined to find James and the others now that he had an idea where he might find them (down by the lake), judging by the water on those pants. He'd told them to go play not start a civil war!
She forced herself to stay still until all the voices were gone, until the room had gone silent once more except for the sound of fathers ragged breathing. She found it calming to repeat the models of behavior they learned in the BDM.
It never ceased to amaze him how small they felt at this age, how fragile.
“Wait. Wait a moment.” He called out in the kind of tone that said he was thinking deeply and only seconds from raising an alarm. He reached out to grab Tony’s arm but Tony jerked sharply away, pinning him with as ferocious a glare as he could muster.
Ian’s grin faded.
"Yes, but the proper sort.  And he wouldn't want to do it with servants." James shot back, for once not sounding as if he agreed with the proper way to do things.
Tony’s smile was tight as he sighed, firing off one last parting shot of his own.
Father? Shock darted through him and Dvorak straightened, looking at the little girl with new eyes.
Nervous eyes fixed firmly upon the strings of the mandolin, the captain began to pluck a rolling melody. It was a tune that Tony instantly recognized from Sergei Prokofiev’s children’s symphony, about a young boy who caught a furious wolf stalking the woods surrounding their home.
"Why won't you dance with me?" Tony heard the boy asking as he approached, though it sounded more like a general giving commands than a true question. "Péter says you love it. He brags about how good you are. Are you still punishing me for that little joke I made about your father's friend?"
"Yes," Stefen answered tersely, and there was something about hearing it said from his lips - so resolved and without trapping - that made Charlotte's heart crumble in her chest. What was so lacking in her, that he could not love her with such simple certainty?
The drab wardrobe Tony had brought from the abbey didn’t suit him and neither did the scholarly dregs he’d managed to create from the sensible bolts Virginia had acquired for him. Steve had instructed the shop girl to pick things someone like Thorson would like. Someone who took over a room as soon as they walked into it. A good choice he’d thought again with pride as he let his gaze wander over Tony in the coat and tails he’d chosen for the dinner party. The monk had forgone gloves, going with a more casual look but it did little to detract from the overall effect.
Péter closed his eyes and swallowed down the lump in his throat, pushed the fear down with it with gritted teeth.
Ian was at the front, carrying the Wehrmacht's standard. It rested now against a shoulder, heavier then he thought it would be. The black and white Iron Cross emblem nearly dwarfed him as he shifted the heavy pole.
He arrived at the hotel just after two thirty, anxiously handing the keys to the valet who rushed out the glass doors to meet him. He’d left instructions with the concierge when he’d requested an upgraded suite, to be on the watch for his families’ arrival and to see them settled but he’d still have liked to be there to greet them.
"Do you think Péter can come?"
“He took off when your Da was Ian’s age, thought he’d earn more money without the family in tow. The money came in at first, every few months your Baka would get a parcel with some coins hidden in it. Wasn’t much but it meant we ate that day.
“Then you are just incapable of following orders?” the captain snipped, clipping his words and Tony smiled serenely at him.
They crowded around him and Bucky chattering a mile a minute with unhindered enthusiasm and Artur almost knocked them both over colliding into their legs, wrapping one arm around Steve’s right and Bucky’s left and squeezing tight as he wriggled and bounced with excitement.
Well, it couldn’t have happened to a more deserving person, Steve thought darkly. But it could mean trouble for him if the police were combing the streets out for blood.
Steve swore he could have heard a pin drop and then not a beat later the table seemed to explode with excitement as the children (all but Péter) clamored out of their chairs to hug and touch and tug, all talking at once and getting progressively louder to be heard over the others. He couldn't really distinguish one voice from the other, what with his ears ringing and his heart pounding too loudly.
That’s right. Stark was taking the children camping that afternoon. They were still glum about the fact that Stefen had refused to join them.
“Captain. Herr Bakhuizen.” Tony nodded to them both though they’d gone silent at the first sight of him. Stefen was watching him intently as if trying to gauge how much he’d overheard before he’d made his presence known. To Tony’s surprise it was the seemingly ever peevish Bakhuizen who stopped Tony as he made to pass their table and gestured for him to take the empty seat.
A/N: I have updated our
That answered one of Tony’s questions at least. His visit there today wasn’t a secret. At least not a big enough one that it hadn’t made the rounds of soldier’s gossip. Practically snapping his heels, the more senior of the two approached Tony with a brisk step.
Tony shrugged thinking with no small amount of irony, "nobody can resist a forbidden romance."
The sun had risen, and people were moving about on the street below, another day in the great city of Berlin beginning as it had to. People had to keep going, didn’t they? No matter what was happening around them. Steve turned from the window to look at Bucky who was sat back to back with Zimmerman. Both had their arms crossed over their chests and aside for Zimmerman's deeper breathing brought on by a light sleep, they were mirror images of each other.
“They’re pulling me. Putting me on public relations duty.”
Tony was practically stomping by the time they entered their rooms, gearing up to give the man a piece of his mind. Stefen for his part looked completely relaxed. Amused even.
"Assassination?" he murmured after a few moments more of tense silence. Steve jerked and looked up from where he'd been fixated, presumably staring at the flaws in the brick work, to nod. He eyed Bucky's face thoughtfully as he crossed his arms over his chest and nodded again, slowly with that tell tale set to his jaw. Ah fuck.
What wasn’t to like? Adorable children, a singing monk. I thought it was very fun – but the play understood more of what it was like, to grow up at that time.
"Gadje..." Péter tried the word out after she'd practically spat it at him, heaving the clump of pulled grass into the water. He recognized it he realized with elation. From the story Father had told him and Ian about Baka.
“Who is this?” the officer grunted, his eyes narrowing on Tony.
“Not tonight.”
The quiet voice pulled Steve away from the music room, the image of Tony fading and the warmth of hands on Steve’s body fading with it, leaving him chilled and disoriented.
"Don't talk garbage or I’ll do it again!" He admonished, and James glared hotly at him, but to everyone’s surprise he quelled his reply when Charlotte cleared her throat and gave them each a very stern look.
He’d survived. All was well. He hadn’t frozen in those mountains.
“It was good. I hope?” Stefen asked, a statement turning question somewhere in the middle and Tony laughed, feeling such a swell of fondness for him that he found himself moving up on his toes to kiss him without thinking. He aborted the movement with a sheepish smile. The captain looked confused by the odd motion.
“Do you really think he should be here for this?” he asked Stefen, pointedly ignoring Tony. Curiosity piqued, Tony pushed aside the issue of Charlotte and carefully scrutinized Stefen. He looked the same as he had when they’d left their lodgings that morning, that was to say stiff in the shoulders with a permanently tense expression. A far cry from the loose-limbed man with the sinfully long eyelashes he’d left sleeping peacefully in bed before the sun rose, but a familiar sight nonetheless.  And yet Tony was certain that something was wrong.  He could not explain it. Just a sixth sense. A Stefen sort of sense, that was surprisingly fine tuned to the almost frantic energy he was exuding.
He couldn’t have this, not forever. But he had the night and he was just selfish enough to take whatever it would give him.
The last time the truck slowed, and the crate of the lid jerked open was no different, except this time her eyes were red. He blinked up at her, even the moonlight too bright for his eyes, and she held out a shaking hand above him.
“I don’t think you’re stupid Tony.” Stefen refuted calmly, but his calmness just seemed to agitate Tony all the more.
“Can’t we just use wood, Tony? There’s plenty of it.”
Pure scientific observation. Anyone would have noticed it, and it wasn't strange at all that Tony wanted to definitively prove his certainty that Stefen's was finer as fact and not preference.
“There were rumors about her, the wife that is. She was Italian, but that was about all that anybody knew and that was the odd part, because people in their circle, it’s all about pedigree isn’t it? The big talk was she was aCarboni, which don’t mean shit to you I know.” Kirk grinned draining the rest of his mug and licking his lips, leaving Bucky to wait in tense silence. The blond set the mug down with a thud and leveled with Bucky.
He sagged against the wall and rested his head, his breathing shaky as he righted himself, body thrumming with pins and needles. He’d thought release would make him feel better, but the aftermath just left him feeling torn and raw. He’d felt similar in Berlin, like someone had taken a knife and begun peeling his skin with every shock of pleasure that had shot through his body.
to these gutless gadje sheep.
Ian eyed his father’s jacket lying over the dresser as if it were going to take life in the mirror's reflection. He straightened up and checked himself in the mirror again, smoothing his dress blouse meticulously, for the fifth time. It was perfect. Which was good. They needed to be perfect today.
“Bambino speak to me. Are you well?
On ships over seas
He spotted a trio of boys on patrol, their uniforms standing out in the grey weather, their batons catching the dying light as they swung them idly, in an unspoken threat at odds with their good cheer and boisterous laughter. To think, only a few nights before he’d watched those same batons beat the backs of the innocent, driving them out of their homes like cattle and pushing others into death. Tony’s stomach wound tight with tension but he forced himself to continue his walk at a steady pace.
Bucky sighed.
He had to settle for this small defiance. For now.
The children were relieved to end that days lesson early (French verbs) and trudged from the room, no doubt eager to find cooler spaces. Tony set out for the maids quarters, newly resolved in his mission, because while it was all well and good for the children to be well bred little darlings with the right education to succeed in the world, someone had to see to their crumbling spirits; or else they would become the worst sort of adults the kind without any sort of imagination or hunger for the world- dull in other words. Tony hated dull people above all else.
Charlotte heard the doorbell, but she didn't pay it much mind. She'd instructed Milthede that she wasn't to be disturbed. Her sole wish was to concentrate on her packing. There wasn't time to warn her aunt and uncle of her immanent arrival.  Stefen’s arrest had come far faster than even she had expected, and she couldn't count on her father's name to protect her from the inquisition. They’d come looking for her testimony eventually. She'd lied for Stefen too often, lived in his house and to all public appearances shared his bed. Of course, she had secrets to share with them and they’d want to pry them out of her.
“Power. Glory. Infamy.” Tony ticked them off on his fingers with a smile. “You want to wipe away my father’s legacy and replace it with your own. I’ll help you. I will write down the exact composition of the metal
“It doesn't matter how. Just that it happened.” Bucky could see his resolve wavering under the horrified expressions of his children and the fear etched there. Steve took another breath and something in his eyes softened as they pinned Starks, almost pleading as he finished.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Germany? Germany?!” an incensed voice called from the mouth of the now open bedroom door. Steve’s old comrade Lucan Parodi fisted his hands at his sides and glared out at Zimmerman.
Father looked up at him, the thin line of his mouth turning up slightly into a wane smile at the sound of Ian’s voice. The smile didn’t reach his eyes but at the same time there was something like relief in them – a sight that only made Ian’s stomach feel like he was in the middle of falling. Why was he relieved to see them? What did he think was going to happen to them while he was gone?
True, the style had been carefully copied from the men whose photos had decorated the concert halls of his youth and the magazines his mother had subscribed to. But it was silly to feel a pang of loss over something as mercurial as how hair decorated one's face. Wasn’t it?
“We’ve been invited to brunch tomorrow by a good friend of mine, Baroness Shrader.” Stefen announced without breaking his gaze away from what was happening in the sitting room. “Did they bring anything suitable to wear?”
~*~*~*~
The car was speeding toward them, up the road they'd already hit. They both seemed to realize it at the same moment, staring wildly at each other frozen in shock before he heard her breathe his name in a small voice.
“Then you have to
. They are both great projects with inspiring stories and we are proud to be a part of them.
"It looks like it went straight through. But we will need to clean it and-" The doctor tried to explain in the same tone one might use for the exceptionally slow.
Days ago he’d have traded anything to see Stefen again. He’d been terrified the man was injured, or imprisoned somewhere or worse, and all he’d wanted in the world was the chance to hold him like he’d held him in Berlin.
“What’s the truth here Stefen?” Tony asked, because it was obvious to him that Steve had already resolved himself to sole responsibility for Bucky’s losses, and that nothing Tony could say in the moment was going to dissuade him.
Tony scoffed inwardly, his lips twisting in a sardonic smile. He should at least be honest with himself.
"I won't." Steve swore. "I may have to pretend. At least until the children are secure, but I will not fight for them Bucky."
“Well… you gentlemen certainly have your work cut out for you. But I don’t understand how you expect me to help.”
“I was not the right man. The thing is Tony, no matter how darkly I obsessed, what risks I took, or what boundaries I pushed, there was nothing I could do. The monster inside of her was stronger than both of us. She died, and I tried to put a bullet in my mouth – “Tony’s breath caught in his lungs, and his eyes widened in shock as Bruce went on. “But the pistol jammed. I realized how much I wanted to live but could no longer live with myself. I had to find a way to silence the voice inside, telling me that I wanted to die. That I deserved to die. I committed myself to the monastery the next day.”
“Two of you must have gotten along like butter on toast.”
Stefen had been different since his return and as much as Tony tried to tell himself the failed coup and the onset of war was solely to blame for it, he couldn’t help the voice inside that warned him it also had something to do with Charlotte’s presence there.
Forward and together was the only way.
Hannie Schaft, known as the "girl with the red hair" became an icon of dutch resistance, but sadly was caught by gestapo when an officer at a checkpoint happened to noticed the red roots of her hair. She was executed three weeks before the war ended. It is widely rumored that the first bullet didn't kill her and her last words were, "I shoot better than that."
Steve listened closely to the footsteps coming from the approaching guard. They emptied the bucket he used to relieve himself every fourth day and had done so two days ago. Aside from the over flow of watery shit and piss, the cell was relatively clean. Steve often had the bewildered thought that every time he was bound and manhandled out of his cell for interrogation some little toady was scrubbing and sweeping away his blood and filth. Some little minion paid to maintain the illusion of civility.
No, oh no. Magda licked her lips, her throat going dry again with fear. She clutched the rake to her chest and edged forward, trying to think what to do next. Something squashed beneath her feet and she glanced down.
Together they exited and as Steve lugged Sam’s bags from the boot of the car he regret refusing Sam’s offer to help as his ribs violently protested. He was hunched over, taking a pinched breath when his eyes fell on a man a few yards away.
Stark’s eyes widened marginally but otherwise he kept quiet as a mouse. The whole table watched and waited for Steve to finish.
Everyone said that Charlotte Shrader was a perfect match for Captain Rogers in every way. They were correct (but not for the reasons they thought they were).
“S-stark.” The captain's voice sounded like rusted chain. He licked his lips and continued, struggling with his words.
Apprehension building, Steve folded his hands behind his back falling into parade, leveling Hasenkamp with a stare. “What more can I help you with Herr Mayor?”
“She didn’t mean any harm Harry.” The girl insisted, but she didn’t sound very sure of what she was saying, and Harry scoffed loudly in reply.
Admiral Erhard’s office was much like any other. A large square room with windows facing the dockside, dressed with solid masculine furnishings. Figuring out which one was Erhard was as simple as looking for the one sitting in the big chair behind the large oak desk, but Tony hardly spared a thought for the décor or the admiral once he’d caught sight of his guests, or rather one guest in particular.
"Now children, a word of caution. It is an unfortunate truth that your father's treachery has convinced some that you are not to be trusted. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree as they say," Frauline Werner chuckled softly, but the sound was off in the heaviness of the silent room and Péter shivered. And then, as if it were nothing at all, she announced, "Your tutor Herr Stark has nobly taken up a commission with our naval forces - " shocked gasps erupted from Péter's siblings, but Frauline Werner just talked over them as if she didn't hear," - but we will be paying close attention to your education, never fear. I have no doubt that each one of you will prove yourselves to be nothing but the best assets to the fatherland."
Hair dye was one answer, but with rationing in place and hair dye on the list of contraband it was to procure. Time and an extreme amount of luck were desperately in need, though time wasn’t necessarily on their side. Still, there was more work to be done than hands or funds to do it, so at the very least Tony and Stefen were not left often alone with nothing to do but worry.
"What?" he groused. And there, Tony thought. He could see it now. The way he grit his teeth, and clenched and unclenched his hands around the steering wheel. It was so easily mistaken for temper, but it was just there to disguise how uncomfortable he was. But was it Tony’s proximity or the way in which Tony was staring at him? Perhaps both.
“I’ll find them
“Father is a good man…” she said, later when they’d sat down for tear, spreading liptauer over a slice of fresh bread. “I hope I make him proud, but it’s difficult sometimes knowing what to do.”
Ian came running up to meet them, biting his lips with worry, and it didn’t take long to figure out why as he pointed. And sure enough, he was sitting with his back against the door, shivering despite the blanket someone had obviously been kind enough to wrap around him. James was still outside, and had been now for hours.
"You out?" Lang finally asked, and Steve nodded jerkily, already reaching for the tin box that Scott extended toward him.
When she’d gotten her little sister firmly situated Natacha mounted the bike herself and turned in Tony’s direction, looking somewhere just past him, and murmured that they were ready. Despite her perfect posture she looked uncomfortable standing there in her blue and white pinafore. Now that Tony was looking at them all in a row it could be said that, yes alright, the pattern of their attire put one in mind distinctly of drapery.
Just when Ian thought he'd been found out, his father gestured for him to come in. Ian padded over and held out his dress blouse.
It was quite a beautiful thing to suppose, that when Tony had heard these words sung in a darkened theater, with his heart lonely and aching, that Stefen had perhaps been there somewhere in the crowd with his Margrit, falling in love for the first time and wholly unaware of how one day – after losing himself in darkness – their lives would touch.
Still, he was grateful for his family’s caution and foresight to hold Stefen back and send Antonia instead. Women were less conspicuous in general and to an outside observer it wouldn’t be unusual for the widow to receive a female friend around teatime. It was rather amusing though; the heavy scarf Aunt Antonio had draped over herself for subterfuge. The weather was still cool, but not as cold as all that.
"Has everyone gone mad?" James lifted his head to glower at them. "We can't go to another country by ourselves. We don't have any money!"
"Kid's a sharp shot. " Bucky confessed under his breath as if they weren’t in the middle of a life or death chase.
This time it was Brother Tiberius, the monastery treasurer, who was hurrying towards where Nik had been standing with brother Filip, a furious step to his gate. Filip Coulson’s visage remained smooth and unruffled despite the dark cloud the younger monk was undoubtedly bringing with him, but that was Fil for you- religiously unruffled.
“Captain, don’t you think you’re overreacting over a skirt?” Tony asked, frowning and Steve clenched his fists, shaking with fury and indecision. It wasn’t about the damn skit. She was up to something. Wasn’t she? He knew his own daughter! Except for when he didn’t. Except for when his mind played tricks on him and he mistook total strangers. What if he was wrong?
“Home.” Steve realized, faltering in his step for the barest of seconds and then quickening with newfound purpose. Tossing a smirk over his shoulder he waved at Bucky to hurry up. “You’ve gotten old on me Bucky, always falling behind.”
"That's Striker’s man. It's me he wants." Tony jumped at the sound of Stefen’s voice, and the captain grabbed his collar, spinning him away from the window with a harsh tug. "Look at me Tony. Stay with the children. Whatever happens."
