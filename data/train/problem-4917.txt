“Well, I’d like it if it was two,” Steve smiled. “But, realistically speaking… it’s going to take that long to get everything we need to take care of Bucky, and actually plan that mission…”
Tony dropped to his knees to save himself from collapsing flat out onto his back. He felt like he was weightless, like he was floating away from the ground, away from himself. His vision was blotted with stars, his skin was filmed in sweat, his tongue was still coated with that perfect,

face and say no. It would’ve been like kicking a puppy, or swearing at a child – some deeply ingrained function in him rebelled against the very thought. It was irrational. It was ridiculous. But there it was.
about how dramatic it was… An image immediately jumped into Tony’s mind, fully formed, and he very nearly laughed at it. He nearly
“But then I spoke to Captain Rogers,” she carried on. “And… I think he’s lonely, too. I think he feels very different from everyone else, and I think he’s looking for the sort of answers that you could give him… I thought he’d value the way you see people. It seemed to me that he was really looking for that… And he was the first person I’d spoken to in
lose his mind over this situation – he couldn’t. He had to stay focused, and think what he was going to
But falling in love with Steve was about more than just liking him as he got to know him, or getting to be more comfortable around him. There was also something there that Tony couldn’t put into words, couldn’t rationalise - but that he completely understood. A spark, or a pull, or an immediate connection to all the little things that made Steve
Steve made sure to ignore that last observation, as he and Bucky stepped into the elevator. He swallowed as subtly as he could, and tried to breathe through a sudden lightness in his chest. Again, he tried to think his way out of these feelings. He made himself remember everything he’d decided that afternoon. He told himself that he’d get over this before too long…
“I keep telling you, you’ll just end up with them burnt on the outside and raw in the middle…” Clint sighed, giving the BBQ a token jab anyway…
Eventually, Andrew sat up miserably, and took one look at the plate of congealed food under his face, and asked Vanessa if they could just go to bed. She nodded, heavily – she’d started to flag by then, too.
Steve made his shallow breathing obvious. He hissed painfully, swallowed hard, twisted his features into a grimace-
And, amongst other things, Tony had figured out that Steve’s blood obviously did work like a drug. There was clearly
But Steve just growled against his lips, digging his fingertips hard into his skin as he dragged Tony back towards the door. Tony barely had time to register the sudden movement before Steve had turned and thrown him hard against the wall beside the doorframe, his weight pinned by Steve’s chest, his feet a full foot off of the ground.
Steve sighed, and forcibly crashed that train of thought - mainly because he couldn’t bear to get his hopes up. Because it felt arrogant and ridiculous and embarrassing to be getting his hopes up, at a time like this.
And he stepped aside, so that Steve could see the construction of the cradle, in which the Tesseract already sat, just waiting for the final components to be put into place.
more.” Tony mused. “It’s just the way I prefer to think about things, I guess… Actually, baking always made much more sense to me than cooking.”
With a heavy sigh, Tony leant forward and picked up that same piece of paper again, groaning internally at how
He knew that those guards can’t have caught more than a fleeting glance at either of them. But if they burst into this room looking for them – as they absolutely would, any second now – and they saw two anxious, fully dressed, well known superheroes in among all the happy, fucking people… they were going to put two and two together
He’d even come up with a list of questions - which he’d repeated to himself so many times that the rhythm of them had started to irritate him.
up, that you all need to be sure there isn’t still a threat out there and that Thanos’ army has been destroyed – Thanos was dead! But even then, there was no time to discuss it. And in all this time, you’ve told me
Steve waited until he was out of earshot before he allowed himself a sad sigh. He really hoped that things worked out differently for Selvig in this reality…
So, after a moment’s panicked hesitation, he allowed that fear to narrowly win the conflict. He gave a little smile, and a nod, and stepped back towards the elevator.
Only to walk in and remember what a complete fucking mess he’d left, when he gave up on it the night before.
last night, because I was on drugs and ranting and not really trying to be fair… But I guess I feel worse about this one, now, because I think I really
“Sure,” Steve smiled… and made sure to carry on smiling, even as the sheer number of security clearance forms started to worry him…
I want. All I ever wanted” Steve smiled, a warm feeling pooling in his stomach as he saw the happiness light up Tony’s face.
He’d spent all night trying to get his head around the scale of the threat and the size of his emotions and the ways in which the world had changed, and he’d gotten nowhere. But at least he could address the state he was currently in.
He didn’t even know if he’d stayed conscious. For a few timeless moments, the world was just shadows and stars. There weren’t even any physical forces acting on Steve’s body anymore. He was just floating, suspended on this rich, thick sensation, his muscles weak and trembling, every inch of his skin tingling…
Still, he made a point of sighing dramatically, because he couldn’t bear to let this pass uncommented. Then, begrudgingly, he rose to his feet along with the rest of them, and followed the waitress through the door and into another hallway.
Tony heard the little thud, as the dead weight of Steve hit the bed. He knew that Steve would be asleep within a minute… And he told himself that was a good thing.
And when Tony looked over, he saw that Thor was standing with a group of maybe twenty shy-looking Varians, just to the left of the main entrance. They weren’t much shorter than Zan was, but the honesty in their faces gave them away as kids.
This was potentially going to be an emotional morning for Steve, whether he woke up feeling bathed in love or woke up with doubts of his own. Either way, he’d
you found out…” But he could tell that - quite understandably - Tony wasn’t taking anything else in.
And, tonight, it was as good as it had ever been. He and Tony traded little observations, even little jokes, as Tony was working. There were call backs to things they’d talked about before, references they both got – a genuine sense of familiarity, despite the cacophony of reactions that Tony still sparked in him.
“You know what, this is my fault,” Scott announced theatrically. “I’m sorry, I’m terrible at toasts, I shouldn’t-”
“He should start to wake up in about ten minutes, give or take,” Tony spoke, softly. “There shouldn’t be too much recovery time. He might be kind of sleepy tonight, but he’ll be fine by tomorrow. He might want to cry off, if you have something especially difficult planned…”
Until, halfway someway through some meaningless observation, he noticed Steve about to rest his hand on the workspace just behind the examination table – and Tony’s whole body jarred upright with a sudden stab of adrenaline.
do was erase the memories of what they’d done since they arrived here. After consultation. With permission. People who had done these things they wanted to do, and enjoyed them, and suffered no tangible harms because of them,
So, at the very least, he wasn’t going to waste the time. He was going to double check his hunches, look for more details, plan for as many outcomes as possible.
He felt Tony’s thumb press roughly over his hole, sending a shock of pleasure through his hips and down his legs and the entire length of his spine. His cock throbbed hard again against his stomach as Tony teased him open, his mouth moving over the curve of his ass, and then his
…He was Tony, screaming that Steve was a liar, that he could never be trusted with anything ever again.
“Oh, Steve, I love you, I’ve always loved you, I’ve never stopped loving you, I’ve never loved you more than I do right now, it’s okay, it’s all going to be okay, come here-”
“It won’t take me five minutes to get to him,” he said, his voice darker now. Barely his own. “If you don’t hear anything by then, you get in, and you get him out.”
“I didn’t know what I was risking when I took the serum, either,” Steve shot back – not sure where any of this was coming from now. Trying
But with no additional Pym Particle, there was no way for them to recreate time travel - no reason at all for them to guess that time travel was involved.
“So…What happens now?” Steve asked, miserably, resisting a growing temptation to wrap his arms around himself.
They were too tense around each other to laugh together, or talk honestly, or understand each others feelings, or any of the things people rely on to cope with unexpected situations.
,” and he turned to sneer at Coulson, before he looked back at Pepper and promised, “if you just give me a couple of minutes, I can explain everything.”
He could sigh happily at all the sweet things Steve had said to him, without having to over think everything he’d said in return.
Tony swallowed roughly, and was just about to tell himself to get a grip, when his gaze dropped to the information listed beneath those horribly familiar images-
“And I should thank you for coming to see me today,” Pierce carried on with the pleasantries, as he closed the door behind them. “I was hoping to arrange this meeting outside of daylight hours, but it seems your schedule is the only one more packed than mine.”
“No,” Bucky replied, with a faux innocent shake of his head, as though he had no idea why Thor would even suggest it.
It was a large, open plan space, minimalist and white in that way expensive kitchens tended to be without thinking. The whole of one wall was taken up by the wide countertop that Steve was standing at, with a glistening six burner gas range built seamlessly into the surface. Behind him there was an island, with a deep sink… and several glass jars of shimmering, brightly coloured liquid, which looked decorative rather than functional. He smiled, feeling like he’d found a personal detail to file away. And then he glanced over to his left, to the tall, chrome refrigerator – the flyer stuck to the door with a Stark Industries magnet.
His investigation into his fathers past had drifted down his list of priorities, recently. Probably because, if he was honest, he was only ever using it as a way to feel close to Steve - his interest had waned in direct proportion to how much time he and Steve spent together in real life.
“And why are you here?” Tony asked, sounding more dazed than defensive. “What, because you knew my dad, or… Wait, SHIELD found you? When?”
“Shh” Tony soothed – and put a finger to Steve’s lips. It was the contact that shocked Steve into silence. It was just so intense- “
Even before he became Captain America, he still hadn’t had the option of running away with his emotions. To be perfectly fair… no one did, back then. Teenagers had only just been invented when Steve became one, and they came in one of two types: the good kids, and the bad kids. Adults didn’t
Alas, on this particular night, his mind had been so full of questions and possibilities that they seeped into his dreams. He felt as though he’d woken a hundred times, always in the middle of an important thought that he couldn’t remember, always with a humming anxiety that he was supposed to be somewhere…
, just because he’d die otherwise. Even stakes like that didn’t turn a genuinely immoral act into something excusable. He couldn’t let his personal predicament influence the scientific research, or colour his reading of the evidence-
And then Tony took hold of Steve’s hand and squeezed it, shivering through an illicit thrill at the solid strength of Steve’s arms, and the way it melted under his touch…
“Tony made Vision because he’d already made Ultron. Everything Tony ever did was to redeem himself for some weapon he’d already made.”
So, awful though it was, Steve stopped fighting that fear. He stopped trying to stay calm, dropped all attempts to put it out of his mind or rationalise it. Instead, he began to actively indulge the worst trauma he could possibly imagine-
And then Steve was doing what everyone does, when faced with a truth serum or a mind reader – he was thinking specifically of the things he’d be
And for a second Tony just looked at him in the same adoring way. At first, he just saw those flawless blue eyes blown wide with need and those pretty lips, parted slightly, still wet…
a terrible loss, a niceness you can somehow feel at the same time as feeling utterly and completely ruined…
Tony grinned, and took a sip of his coffee. He had learned better than to try and control these trains of thought; he knew now that he could only roll with what occurred to him. So, that made it a pleasant discovery, to find that there were at least some warm, happy thoughts to see him through this interlude…
“Hello, Captain Rogers,” She beamed, “I’m a huge fan of yours. And I, uh, couldn’t help overhearing, but actually
different, looking at them. The rows of flowers seemed more intricate and delicate and colourful to him now… like he was finally seeing the details beneath the blanket impression he’d had of an
He waited until the servers had made their way further down the bar. Watched until each of them was fully distracted. Picked his moment, tugged Tony’s hand, and ran.
...Steve had spent years thinking about Tony, and looking for excuses to be with Tony, and delighting over every kind word and token of affection he got from Tony-
Frantic now, Steve looked over to the kitchen area, to where Tony was walking in short, sharp lines as he talked to someone on his cell phone. Already, Steve knew that this was the wrong priority. He knew that he should be far more concerned by what he did to that photographer - by what he
regret was roping the others into this. Poor Rhodey, who obviously wished he’d never had the idea, and clearly had no personal investment in it whatsoever, had nonetheless allowed Steve to run with it, rather than make the situation even more awkward. Steve was embarrassed about that now.
“When the first Adams came, we welcomed them, the same way we welcomed anyone. And when they were interested in our medicines, we were happy to explain all there was to know about them – including the fact that they would be of no use anywhere else. And they
He flipped back to the previous page and squinted at it for a moment longer. And then he began flicking through the remaining few pages, focusing his eyes solely on the shape of the word ‘Consort’. But nothing leapt out at him.
safe - and that was good, in there,” he nodded in the direction of the house, never taking his eyes off Steve. “That was perfect.” Steve smiled, that frantic need in him uncoiling just slightly. Tony waited until he felt Steve’s hands soften against his back before he added, “come on, let's go home, and I’ll look after you.”
He still had to think about all his vulnerabilities, all those risks – and for Pepper, and Rhodey, not to mention the company and the Avengers and all the people who relied on them…
And then he felt Steve’s body freeze, bracing hard against Tony with a choked moan, coming over his stomach-
And, just to punctuate his point, someone on a nearby couch chose that exact moment to start yelling ‘
Standing in the corner of an old money New York hotel, trapped in a conversation with a well-meaning but dull politico and a pretentious CEO, Steve felt exactly as uncomfortable as he would have at the same event in 1944 - which was something.
Tony heard the little beep. The commotion of the team filing into the White Room. He could feel people looking at him, but he didn’t think anything of it. He couldn’t tear his thoughts away from all those memories of
worse now – or if things have always been so much worse than I thought they were… If Obie was always right about that stuff and I was just lying to myself, or if I really was better not thinking about any of it at
Which… had made Tony think, to say the least. He’d spent about three hours just staring at a wall after he read that passage, asking himself all sorts of questions that would never have occurred to him, considering perspectives he wouldn’t otherwise have thought of… So, in a way, that diary was useful – even if it later transpired that the author believed her menstrual cycle was dictated by the moon.
Tony physically manoeuvred Steve over to his side of the car, mostly because it seemed natural to carry on touching him… He warned himself to maintain a little bit of concentration for the road, as he got into the driver's side door and fastened his seatbelt.
“So, the photographer is going to be okay,” Tony began, his voice warm and confident, as he took his seat at the other end of the couch. “Pepper went down there just after we left. Apparently he has a few broken bones - but they were all clean breaks, so, nothing that won’t heal. Some torn muscle tissue and some pretty serious bruising, but, again, it’ll heal. He had a mild concussion, but they think it’s from when he hit his head going down, not… Anyway, he’ll be fine. And he doesn’t want to press charges - he didn’t want anyone to pay his medical bills, but Pepper insisted. Covers our backs in case he changes his mind, or something. And he has a brand-new camera already on order. So. That’s that…”
“Yes, right. Okay.” He breathed, taking them all in at a sweep. “Okay, we need a more useful command…” And then he looked back to the panel, “Okay, load all files on the history of The Facility, or Mallamen, or Anni Vara. Left side of the left wall.”
” And Rhodey paused again for emphasis, raising his hands in a dramatic gesture before he added, “that’s
conflict, the constant effort of sounding happy without thinking about why he wasn’t, that he didn’t have the headspace left to think about anything else. He wasn’t watching what either of them were doing-
to do this at all. And Steve knew it was petty, and petulant, and that a younger version of himself would have been most disappointed…
He did one final check of his monitor, almost wishing he’d find some anomaly to investigate… But no. All scans running as they should be, all results as expected. And, of course, that meant that this was now
Even the inky nothingness of the wormhole - even the nightmare counterpart that swallowed him in his sleep - was less oppressively vacant than his workshop in the moments after Steve left. It was as though he’d taken all the air with him, all the sound, all the colour, all life… For a few seconds, Tony’s mind was completely blank, frozen in panic over what to panic over first-
reaction that straightened Steve’s spine and set his shoulders, that fixed his features into a defiant expression-
And Steve just burst out laughing. That head back, full laugh that Tony had seen him do so rarely… that laugh he’d always loved more than anything.
Tony peppered his collarbone and shoulders with the same hot, soft kisses, his hands sliding over Steve’s body until they found their way to his waist. Tony held him there, his thumbs teasing over the top of Steve’s waistband, as he moved to kiss his way down the centre of Steve’s chest. He heard Steve’s breathing get higher and faster as he moved down Steve’s stomach, until it broke into a desperate
Steve’s stomach turned to water, his face falling into a dreamy expression that Tony must’ve seen, before he climbed off of the bed and walked into the bathroom-
“No, I’m okay – there’s no problem,” Steve assured him, a little shiver in his voice. “Well, not like that, I mean…”
“That doesn’t mean it is,” Rhodey assured, warmly. “And I know it’s hard to think about what Obie said, and I get that it’s going to be really hard to ask yourself if it’s true – but I absolutely know that you’re going to get to the end of it and realise it wasn’t. I know, if you really thought about it, you’d
sacrificed herself to make this whole thing possible, and she didn’t have to be dragged kicking and screaming into this fight - she’d already given everything to running the Avengers, for five of the worst years of anyone's life. And now you’re talking like Tony’s the one not getting enough attention, and telling
“Work hard,” She smiled as she left - but he barely heard it. He’d fallen into his own little world long before she and Coulson had strolled out the door.
. But, when looked more carefully, he saw that her face was obviously aged. Her body, though small and slight, was an
“Oh, thank you,” he muttered, not quite able to meet her eye as he took it. That might’ve been one of the most surreal moments of his life…
“Jesus Tony, you feel so good,” Steve muttered, like he was talking to himself. “Fuck, the sounds you make, the way you move-”
What if he’d called to warn Vision just ten minutes later? What if the team hadn’t gotten him to Wakanda in time? What if, when Thanos turned up and so
And it was that mentality that had gotten him through when he’d woken up in the future, when he’d seen the sky open up over New York, when he found out what Bucky had been through, when he realised his whole world was a lie… The same mentality that had gotten him through the horrors of war, and losing Bucky the first time around, and the over-whelming head fuck of becoming Captain America in the first place…
The world had forgiven Steve and his team, since Thanos. Knowing how close they’d come to being turned to dust had given the politicians a sense of perspective – and an electorate that loved The Avengers again, at least for a little while. And, on paper, Tony had forgiven them too. Officially speaking, they’d buried the hatchet. They were working as a team again. Everything was okay now.
“You didn’t,” the man assures, confidently. Like a doctor explaining a routine procedure - acknowledging Bucky’s fear without allowing it any credence.
good pain meds-” and then he mentally kicked himself, as he remembered all the jokes Pepper had warned him not to make in potentially litigious situations. “I’ll take care of the medical costs, and I’ll make sure someone looks into what happened, and I’ll get someone to come down to the hospital to talk to you, when you’re up to it,” he tried again, more carefully. “Okay?”
…The instant jolt of feeling something solid push against him, someone he couldn’t merely toss aside-
But still, it was comforting to think that – even at his most panicked and inexperienced and reckless – there were still lines he wouldn’t cross. Things that would never have occurred to him, even when he thought he had put
And Tony leant into him, reaching behind him to unlatch the cuffs on Steve’s wrists. Steve fell forward before he could stop himself, unaware of how he’d been pulling against the chains – and Tony just pulled him in, and held him against his chest… and Steve threw his arms around him, and buried his head in Tony’s shoulder, and
And then Tony pressed his foot to the top of the little device, like he’d been told to, and the portal just disappeared – like a projected image when the power is cut.
Two of the bad guys died of an unfortunate reaction to arrows, but other than that, everyone is fine…”
And Steve could see all of that, and therefore Steve was nervous for him. Anxious for Bucky’s ordeal to be over, willing this to go as smoothly as possible-
– other than it just coming out all wrong… But I am sorry Tony. I am so, so sorry, for everything. If I could take it all back, I’d do anything, if I could just go back and tell you the truth from the start – if I’d known how you felt at the start, all this time…”
“I’m going to order us some food then.” He announced, wearily. “Wouldn’t want to be late for Assembly.”
“No, it’s worse than that,” Tony laughed, joylessly. “No, in my panic to fix the mess with Bucky, I opened all the med lab cabinets and told Steve to go looking for a bio-tech kit. I basically invited him to view my blood exhibition…” And Tony shuddered, remembering all the reasons his entire existence was creepy-
He didn’t know how long he’d been here, he didn’t ask how long it could last… He’d lost all concept of time.
“I love you. So much,” he said again. Tony let himself indulge in this moment. For a few seconds, he just let Steve hold him, and simply felt the soft afterglow of this pleasure, and the warmth of affection and pride and love…
“This is agent Natala Rushmore,” Nick explained for her. “She’s been assigned to...look...after you…”
“No, it’s okay, you can keep talking” Tony whispered, immediately. Instinctively. It took him a few seconds to realise what Steve was even apologising
“Hm.” Tony smiled back, and then just drifted on to “So, in, like, 2049, when we’re celebrating our thirtieth anniversary, and someone’s kid asks us how we got together in the first place…” And he sat up again, to look at Steve when he asked, quite seriously “Where do you want to lie and say we were?”
He heard Tony take a slow breath, with just the hint of a smile in there somewhere, as he put his hands over Steve’s, and let his weight settle back against him.
It mattered that this gesture made Steve feel cared for and prized, rather than exposed or exploited.
know that there was something very wrong about this - and, more than that, that there was something very
And then the strangest little flicker of discomfort crossed Steve’s brow. Tony saw him drop his eyes very briefly, and
Steve let his head fall back again, as Tony pulled away from him, content to let the world exist at a distance for a few moments. He was vaguely aware of the mattress moving beneath him as Tony shifted his weight, and the gentle encouragement of Tony’s palm on his knee, guiding him to move his leg…
Tony cocked an eyebrow and flashed a smile, and for a second Steve was just pleased that he hadn’t dropped the bowl. He let a pleasant shiver run up his spine as Tony took it…
be, the people who wanted to save him - the people who thought of him as a challenge that they’d bravely taken on. The people who would plead that they were only thinking of what was best for him, that they were only trying to protect him… As they tried to change everything he was. The people who thought they
For a moment they just stared at one another, and Steve wondered if he looked as moved and happy as Tony did… he felt it.
? Why do they just trust these people? And – it’s just all such a mess, and it’s all going to come crashing down, and people are going to die and… I thought about telling the Council anyway, even though I was so scared of what they’d do to Father, but I can’t even do that anymore because the Adam’s
It took considerable effort for Steve to force his eyes open. At first, there was just a blinding light and a piercing headache. Instinctively he went to throw his arm over his face, and remembered again that he couldn’t move… recognised the specific resistance of being
His mind filled with incomplete ideas and evocative images; not really thinking about why he was angry so much as creating an abstract representation of it.
He walked over to the couch and deliberately resumed his earlier position, even going as far as to pick his drink up and rest it in the same place on his knee. He let his head fall back and waited for something to hit him, for one single thought or emotion to be the first to shout out of the overwhelmed, overtired numbness singing in his head…
He knew he still had a long way to go. But, at the very least, he’d worked out that he couldn’t forego a chance to make the entire world better, simply because he might cost an old man a job that he didn’t like, and wasn’t very good at. He couldn’t set aside everything he wanted, everything he knew was important, just because someone might not like it. Steve couldn’t spend the rest of his life feeling guilty over every minor inconvenience that he couldn’t avoid for someone…
“Yeah,” Tony nodded, shyly. “Yeah, I’ll call you. And… I’ll find some way to see you again, and we can talk some more…”
His voice sharpened into a shocked little cry as the thrill of it shot down his spine, his cock pulsing hard against his stomach, his thighs aching as he tensed into the sensation.
not saying much. And, actually, it’s been at least ten years since I was bored enough to try it, so I might’ve forgotten it all anyway…”
Also, for those of you that are interested, there will soon be a couple of one shots posted as sequels to this, set in this universe, as part of my 1k milestone celebration - so, if you'd like to see more from Vampire Tony and Consort Steve, watch this space :-)
going to hate it every time you could get hurt. That’s just the way it is, whether we’re together or not, whether I say it out loud or not. And I am always going to prefer the option where you can’t get hurt - and I’m always going to look for that option, every time. But that’s not the same as thinking you’re never going to do anything risky. That’s not me trying to stop you. That’s
And, now that Tony really thought about it… He couldn’t exactly lock Steve in the bedroom, as soon as they got back to the suite. He would be in the same awkwardly-stuck-with-drunk-Steve situation in either place… actually, now that he was visualising the suite… that might even be worse.
The cover story was based on a mistake they’d actually made a few weeks earlier, so Tony was pretty sure that there were no holes in it – no reason anyone should make Steve feel uncomfortable by questioning it.
“I was worried you might think I was trying to talk for you, or something,” Steve confessed - randomly selecting one of the many, many thoughts he’d had about that moment, just for the sake of something to say.
about that outburst. He’d been so consumed with all the things that outburst had been a cover for, he’d not had concentration left to wonder if there had been any truth in it, or how he would begin to explain it, or apologise for it…
Tony’s body was just so entirely perfect, moulded against Steve like this – like he’d been made specifically to fit against Steve’s chest.
“Have we already been here once?” Steve asked casually, as they turned into another softly lit piano bar.
feeling in him. That odd little anxiety, or impulse, or… hunger… Steve didn’t know what to call it. That compulsive feeling that flared up whenever he thought of Tony drinking his blood, that…
the one you’re going to – this is all my Mum’s fault! My Mum, and my Dad, and my idiot brother – and the humans! They
Tony, who was still unquestionably powerful in Steve’s mind, even when he pictured wrapping Tony up in blankets.
And now, once again, he felt as though he was sitting amongst strangers, surrounded by people who’d lived through a different history to him. Again, he was enduring the most powerful grief he’d ever known. This should have been a perfect allegory for that first meal they shared as a team - if they’d
And then Tony broke the kiss to bury his head in Steve’s neck, his breath hot against Steve’s skin as he whispered,
At another time there might have been an exhilarated sort of shame to this, a forbidden thrill in being this exposed – but there was no such thing as shame, right now. Steve
And all the other little gripes he might’ve had, all the arguments he might still think he was right about – all the things he knew he’d have overcome just as easily, or had already changed his mind about, or didn’t care about anymore – just fell by the wayside. He didn’t even get a chance to tick them off, because he’d remembered why none of that mattered.
And Tony just let his thoughts drift, the same way he might have on a lazy Sunday morning. With no particular focus, no plan for where it was going, no endgame…
Tony let go of a carnal moan, which soon trailed back into a whimper, as he fell away from that limit and back into focused, bodily desperation. He pulled the sheets into his fists, trying to dispense some of the eye-watering tension as Steve stroked his hands over the curve of his ass, his tongue still working against his rim in sharp, determined motions-
“He’s fine – he does that, just, goes off sometimes…” Tony muttered, pointedly turning towards the screen again. “It’s fine, I’ll catch him up. Carry on.”
didn’t” Steve commented, playfully. And Tony felt an immediate stab of longing, observing that Steve was actually kind of adorable when he was drunk-
Tony blinked, tensing in surprise… and then softening, as he realised what conversation they were really having. Steve saw the way he exhaled gently as he nodded,
And, maybe it was just that he hadn’t been brave enough to really think of this, before. Back when he’d been so in love with Steve, and so sure that it could only be bad for him – when he hadn’t wanted to ask himself if he should walk away, because he thought he knew the answer, and he knew he wouldn’t like it…
And then, as soon as he pressed two fingertips to Tony’s rim, Tony growled low in his chest, grabbing hold of Steve’s arm in an iron grip as he forced himself down onto Steve’s fingers,
, entirely empty. It was smaller than the other rooms they’d been in, and might’ve looked like a padded cell, if it weren’t so elaborately designed. As it was, the walls, floors and ceilings were covered in a fine, embroidered silk, the raised bench that lined the wall draped with luxury fabrics.

I love you, or if its because of your blood, or some entirely separate… vampire… imprinting, thing, that just so happened to work out really well for me. I don’t have the data to tell you where that other thing comes from. But I do know that it’s there now. Explaining it is going to take some work. But
And then Bucky paused, his eyes caught on something over Steve’s shoulder. And then Sam looked up. And even before Steve turned around, he already knew-
There was an impatient tug up along Steve’s back, a gathering of tension in uneven, ugly waves throughout his core.
“Don’t read anything into that. That’s an entirely unrelated thing that doesn’t have anything to do with...this. With us.”
to me why. Tell me exactly what it is you’re doing, and why I can’t be there…. I mean… According to you,
For as long as Tony was telling him that everything was okay, Steve could only imagine all the things he was really thinking. He had no option to explain himself if Tony never asked him, if Tony was just going to smile and tell him
Whatever social faux pas Steve had spent the last week obsessing over, Tony hadn’t done anything cruel to Bucky.
“Well, on the other hand – she couldn’t have given it a more straight-forward name,” Tony observed. “Who’s Mrs Ken?”
He watched Clint hover for a moment between outrage and fear and begrudging acceptance - which was, of course, exactly where Steve wanted him.
“No, you can’t.” He told her, solemnly. “If you do that, then…” And he paused, as though he was trying to think of a way to explain it, and then he shook his head, as though he’d given up on it, and then he looked at her imploringly. “We just
Steve laughed again, more an expression of happiness than amusement. Because the whole thing was so surreal and so silly and so… safe.
“No, Steve,” Tony cut him off again. “It’s… a good thing. Well, it’s a necessary thing. To be honest, it’s probably something I should’ve faced up to anyway. And, actually, it’s ridiculous that I know so little about myself, and… The point is, I want to be with you more than I want to avoid this topic. Like, a lot more. So.”
Steve felt his spine straighten up from under him. As keen as he was to talk about Tony… he didn’t like
touch of Tony’s palm, barely a whisper, over the head of Steve’s touch starved and over sensitive cock.
This energy conference was going to run to the end of the week - and there was no way he could slip away unnoticed. He was expected by too many important people. Committed to too many important causes. There would be far too many awkward questions about where Tony had gone, and
– to walk away now… It was still Tony’s own mind making that choice. It was still just a question of how much Tony would have to want something before he could harm Steve in any way… It was Tony’s own heart and conscience and soul that recoiled from that idea.
“I mean, I want to help,” he sighed. “And, obviously, I don’t want to tell Pepper I won’t do literally the one thing she’s asked for in the last twenty years. And I don’t want to tell Barnes,
Every nerve lit up as Steve so effortlessly positioned him, that quiet power throbbing gently under his hands.
close to Steve. Feeling this connection in such a pure form, separate from all the background noise of human life…
And it didn’t really matter whether these were more interesting than the pages he’d just struggled through - the point was, they weren’t nearly as interesting as the things he
“I’ll keep it in mind,” he assured, quietly. And then, simply because he couldn’t think of anything else to say, he added, “and, for the record, I
“Do you know how they’re being enslaved?” Steve went on – and Maribelle blinked, and just looked at him for a second.
At least, he did immediately think of Natasha, and the heartbroken panic of her final moments, and the sheer scale of her sacrifice.
“I know.” Tony cut him off with a gentle smile. “But, I also know… that I put so much thought into the thing at that airport. I
“Of course not - they never tell me anything,” he replied, bitterly. Steve’s expression twisted in further outrage, a visible anger tensing under his shoulder blades…
Steve’s fingertips dug into Tony’s back hard enough to bruise, his hips bucking into Tony again as he lifted his head, dragging his other hand through Tony’s hair. Tony sucked against Steve’s throat, running his tongue over his skin, deliberately letting his teeth press into Steve’s neck. Steve let go of a low breath, his hand falling heavily from the back of Tony’s head to the counter-top with dull thud – leverage that he used to push Tony even harder into him.
Tony had been flinching away from that little voice for hours now. Truthfully, he was a bit scared of it. Somehow aware of the power it held, the damage it could do, if he gave it the slightest chance.
Maybe that closeness and affection between them was real, maybe he really was as safe with Tony as he felt…
“I… I mean… This is probably going to sound...” Steve stammered. “And, I don’t know, maybe I shouldn’t say…”
how much he could hurt Tony - without ever meaning to, even when it was the last thing in the world he wanted.
standard I’d set for you, and not how far you exceeded the standards of literally every other person I know. Despite everything. I’m sorry for that.”
in a lab across town justifying himself to whoever would listen, that this mission report was actually over seventy years old… it was sad for so many reasons.
And Steve swallowed, his eyes lighting up with the most endearing burst of exhilaration. And then he gave a little nod.
...And yes, his stomach was still knotted with worry whenever he thought about what Tony must be going through.
been… cool, or confident, or sexy, or whatever, in the forties… If I acted the same way now as I always had, I wouldn’t be those things anymore. Now I’d just sound like your dad trying to be cool, or your grandad trying to be sexy. And, I’m not saying I
he looked at Steve, like he was looking for something to hold on to. The almost imperceptible movement as he went to cross his arms and then stopped himself… Like he knew he wasn’t allowed to curl up into a ball. He covered it quickly, straightening his shoulders and rearranging his features into a more stoic look of concern.
I was doing. There was an actual moment, I remember it, like just snapping out of a trace when I realised that I’d almost done something – that I

, the aim of this ‘special project’ is to try to literally turn earth into Anni Vara – to find the plants that will grow on earth and
“Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?” Tony exhaled, dropping his arms. And then, because he hadn’t quite finished dismantling his fight or flight reflex, he added combatively, “why the jump scare tactics, every time?”
Rhodey gave a little shrug at that, like he didn’t really get it but was happy to go along with it, and finally got out of the car – sprinting a few steps ahead of Tony, so that he could open the door for him. Tony was glad of that little gesture. Not that the sunlight was actually
Still, this was all very easy for him to say, he supposed - in what were his first sluggish thoughts in a while.
And Steve only had to think back to Tony’s reaction the first time he heard that news, and his sense of doubt and disappointment was greatly eased.
, now that he thought about it… and every time, in the middle of a catastrophe. Every. Single. Time.
At that point, sex has fallen outside the sphere of relevance. It was quite obvious that this moment wasn’t about that – not least because, for both of them, their bodies were catching up with all the physical limitations that the drugs had allowed them to forget.
“Forgive the interruption, Sir,” JARVIS spoke up, cautiously. Tony giggled at the fact that Steve still blushed at that. “But you asked to be informed if I was able to uncover any of the redacted information in the SHIELD files.” Tony perked up then, some tension finally returning to his softened limbs as the considered the possibility of a breakthrough...
there, they didn’t exist – he was too far gone to appreciate the absence of them, to process that this was the first time in ten years that he hadn’t felt a low level of anxiety or anger or guilt-
Just the fact that it had even come into his head – that he could really find the space to think something as pitiful and embarrassing as that, right now
“Okay,” he muttered, looking away again. “If you want to, then, thank you, I guess… I mean, I’m not mad at you anyway, so, I don’t know if it’s ‘I forgive you’, or… whatever… But, it’s fine…”
. Tony snatched the case up from the floor, and - having quickly scanned every desk and remembered that there was no room on any of them - he dropped to sit cross-legged on the floor again so that he could open it.
The next kiss was rougher, infused with a whole new level of desperation. Steve sucked at the tender flesh at the hinge of Tony’s jaw,
Like any other drug, it impacted him differently depending on the mood he was in… on what other considerations he’d made…
Tony didn’t really come back into himself until half way through the ride home… when he seemed to suddenly find himself on the back seat of the car, semi-shielding himself from the sunlight, his hand resting over the still-tender skin where the bullet wound once was…
“So, why haven’t you?” Tony went on in that same interested tone, taking another little step forward.
Steve was still grinning at this little detail he’d stumbled upon, and the happy mental image that was starting to form around it.
, as opposed to guilt, to be an entirely social construct. And, whether you agree with that philosophy or just want to experience it for a moment, it’s still encouraged that you leave all ideas of
And there had come a moment in all of this when Tony became horribly aware that he was looking at a metaphor for his entire life. Staring at this pathetic collection of clothes that he didn’t even like, realising that he had no idea how to dress for someone else, what he was even trying to say with his personal choices, how people in the real world saw these things, now… It was a moment that perfectly symbolised how isolated he’d become, how far beyond help he was, how far he’d drifted away from human…
That maybe an 18th Century historian had been making it all up, or that the vampires themselves had lied. Maybe it was all a mistranslation, or an example of research bias, or…
maddeningly close to where Steve needed him. His entire body flinched into it, a low bark of frustration breaking from deep in his chest, before he finally managed to form another word,
Tony laughed again… a soft, breathy laugh that sounded… distant. Sad, almost. Bucky saw Sam’s gaze sharpen as he recognised it, and they shared a concerned glance before they turned to look at Tony.
“...Loki’s attack is going to arrive in May, 2012,” Steve confirmed, carefully. “Which we may be able to stop altogether - and we can certainly better prepare for-”
He even managed to contain that threatened trembling, as Tony dragged a finger along the vein, pressing just hard enough that it made Steve dizzy.
“Perfectly normal, I assure you” Dev looked between Tony and Steve as he spoke. “In fact, I’m pleased you dropped by this evening. We like to give people a few days to find their feet, but after that one of us would’ve reached out anyway, just to see if you have any questions – almost everyone does, when they’re settling in.”
At some point he’d apparently wandered over to the window, and let his forearms rest on the ledge. He didn’t remember doing that, but here he was, staring through his own reflection at the shattered pattern of angry raindrops…
And then, as though to illustrate that very point, Tony began to move against Steve’s cock – never once pulling back entirely. Working Steve off against his throat in sharp, shallow motions. Steve let go of a wordless, primal moan as his head fell back against he pillows, his shoulders falling limp as all his tension began to collect in his hips. He thrust up sharply, his hand firm to the back of Tony’s head, hardly able to comprehend what he was actually doing-
The man with the lute-lele simply looked at him, waiting for Steve’s giggle to bubble up and simmer down again. And then, while Steve was still snickering to himself, he gave the instrument another long strum, and announced in a lilting tone that wasn’t
He was happy that Steve could have a proper shower in a clean bathroom, that he’d been able to change into clean clothes, that Tony could send him back to his team with a rucksack full of fresh supplies and personal items.
Even his feeling of vulnerability came down to that. He was anxious about opening up to Tony, not because he didn’t trust Tony, or because he worried what damage could be done with that information… It was all
“...And I know it’s a painful memory,” Tony carried on pushing. “But I’m getting the impression that it’s more than that…”
Steve let out an unashamedly wanton moan of protest, as Tony shifted his weight onto his knees and away from Steve’s hips. Automatically, Steve went to sit up and grab for him-
“That was nearly fifteen years ago,” he huffed. “And JARVIS is programmed to handle that now…” But he trailed off as he realised what she was getting at.
to relax his back, and slow his breathing - which, if anything, only made him feel slightly light headed.
“Oh, yeah. Hi” Steve forced himself to smile – trying to hide the fact that he was still slightly out of breath.
He swallowed the pill, and squeezed his eyes shut, and tried to remember what the happy prime numbers were-
But if Steve started thinking about that, then it would be all too easy to start thinking about Tony, and the things he wanted to do the moment that Tony got back-
The smell of coffee wafted under his nose, jarring his train of thought. Tony did his best to shake himself to his senses, as he searched through the cabinet for his favourite mug, telling himself,
jealous when Bucky had sex with other people… and that, maybe, he’d like there to be someone in his life that he
Steve hadn’t expected it, and he had no way to brace for it - he’d fallen into it before he even knew what was happening.
The trouble was, he didn’t even know where to start evaluating that - because the answer was so obviously yes.
Once again, he found that actually talking to people was no where near as terrifying as the very thought of it.
And now he didn’t know if he’d misread everything Tony had ever said to him – after all, it had never occurred to Steve that Tony wanted him. Up until last week, Steve had never ever considered whether there was something different about Tony, much less that he was a vampire. Steve had picked up on some hint of loneliness, he’d caught glimpses of some hidden trauma… but he’d had no clue it was something on that scale… Did that mean he’d gotten it all wrong?
And Tony was genuinely baffled as to how this many conflicting impulses could exist in him all at once. How he could feel each of them so intensely, and so purely…
“I’m really sorry,” Tony said with a sad smile. “This isn’t about me, and I’m being an ass about it, and I’m sorry. I just… I care about this, too.”
first meet me after I’d known you for ten years, and, you know, taking things as we find them… I’m just delighted you like me,” he beamed. “And… I know a lot of things I shouldn’t know - but I know that I don’t know everything. I don’t know how
Of course, there were all sorts of complicated thoughts that later occurred to him - questions about where that power came from, and why it was a secret, and how it could affect Tony so directly…
By that time he’d made it as far as the ornate lobby on the lower floors, and had gotten as far as wondering about the architecture… And it just occurred to him, out of nowhere, that Thor would see all of this very differently.
“Well, no, not always” Steve yawned, snuggling closer into Tony. “Sometimes I get to take care of you…”
He opened his eyes, his whole body tensed and alert– and saw Tony looking up at the screens with a determined, inquisitive frown on his face.
He wanted to feel that happiness, that freedom, that thrill of anticipation. He wanted to remember every single minute of this day, and all the threads between them.
“No, I’m sure” Steve cut in, his voice low and breathy and pleading “I want you. Now. I’m sure, please-”
place in the building that Tony was potentially at risk of UV exposure was the main entrance, and, as a result, he’d developed an almost pavlovian response to it. Twenty years’ worth of muscle memory had always stopped him twenty feet short of this point. An instinct so deeply ingrained that even Rhodey and Pepper felt it… Hence Peppers reaction right now.
But Tony moved too quickly, pushed him back too forcefully, and suddenly Steve found himself pinned flat to the mattress under one of Tony’s hands, held hard against his shoulder.
like it should be inappropriate. Instinctively, Steve still expected someone to cough or drop their eyes or shuffle awkwardly to another conversation-
And then, as he turned to leave, a thought occurred to Steve that never would have entered his head, had he been talking to any other mythical being. Something he would never have thought applied to the Stonekeeper, if it hadn’t turned out that Steve knew him. He found himself searching his distant memories for a detail from a different life, a different
Steve looked up, one hand stroking protectively over Tony’s arm as he processed this group of people – some that he’d been chatting to, some whose names he knew – just smiling at them… Happy for them, or intrigued, or impressed. A new heat curled in Steve’s stomach, as he recognised the details of this moment
The authorities behind Operation Rebirth had decided, unanimously and without need for much discussion, that ‘Raising An Army Of The Undead’ would be bad for the propaganda war. The euphemism ‘Super Soldier’ had been decided on long before Steve was - and only became more important after Erskine was shot, and their proposed ‘army’ became one symbolic serviceman. For that first year, Steve’s only value to the Allies was as a poster boy and a bond salesman, and he didn’t need reminding that it would all have been for nothing if the truth came out - that, if the American Midwest discovered they’d been handing their babies to a vampire for souvenir photos, Steve would have done more harm than good.
Steve had been so flooded by adrenaline at the end of the battle that it seemed to push him out of his own body. The first thoughts that came back to him were anxious and jittery, fuelled by that residual nervous energy-
Those same flawless golden-brown eyes that had captivated Steve the very first time he saw Tony, the same alertness and quickness that had infuriated him and overwhelmed him in equal measure -
“That’s it darling, relax,” Tony instructed, as Steve’s body began to soften under his hands. And then he ran his thumbs just a little harder over the dense muscles below Steve’s shoulder blades, digging into that little store of tension there. Steve let go of a sigh he didn’t know he was holding in, feeling like his bones were falling apart under Tony’s movements, like he could just keep melting under this feeling of release until there was nothing left of him…
Automatically, he scanned his memory for all the other instances he’d collected, wondering if he could yet make out a pattern… A few doctors' names, on a range of different projects. A few dates and individual test results, with no way to know what was significant about them.
any of that, or what it would look like, but he knew he couldn’t even begin to think about it until he’d answered-
And Steve felt himself smile along with him, suddenly overwhelmed with the ridiculousness of this situation, the

Tony gave a delighted little yelp of surprise, which was quickly swallowed by a shallow gasp as he surrendered to what Steve was doing. When he broke away, Steve could feel Tony’s heart beating in his ribs…
all these things of you. And that I never once thought about what it would be like, not really, that I didn’t-”
Tony didn’t want to spend the whole evening going through exactly why his life was so shit. He didn’t want to suffer through a specific list of things he could never have, he didn’t want to have to think about why he wanted those things so badly. He preferred being able to take that for granted, to never have to look directly at it… to not think about it at all.
“It’s okay sweetheart,” he assured, putting a comforting hand on Steve’s knee. “Tomorrow, we can go through everything we learned tonight, and decide where we go from there - right now, I
. He’d tried to think though his panic, dismissed so many of his thoughts as unhelpful, done his best to focus.
on that – that there were people who objectified and sexualised the worst thing that could possibly happen to anyone-
“But you being here won’t stop any of that from happening,” Tony challenged. “That can’t be how it works.”
Tony had told himself that this was the least worst option. That he’d made his peace with the fact that Steve wasn’t sorry and would never be sorry. That, even if his heart had been irreparably broken, it was better to be broken hearted with a team of people to help him defend the world. But every single day there was a moment when Tony could’ve snapped, and said it all anyway. At least one moment when he couldn’t pretend he didn’t care, that it didn’t matter. Tony had spent the last few months waiting for the spark that would blow this tinderbox, the minor disagreement that would start them fighting about
And, Jesus, he did try to pay attention to what Belle was telling them. But for the first few minutes he was too completely distracted by the question of what he could do with his hands, rather than flexing them awkwardly at his sides in a desperate attempt not to touch Steve’s hair.
“Anni-Vara is a small planet, and not densely populated – but there are other cities, and people have tried to come to our aid. The same thing happens to all of them. And everyone in this city would’ve risen up, fought back, if we could – but it’s happening to all of us, too. The Adams put their own chemicals in the water and in the air, and they effect our physiology more than yours. It keeps us passive, and confused, and tired. I’m one of our senior chemists, and I take what I can get away with to counteract it, as best I can think to, not knowing what they give us… but it’s not enough. Groups have tried to gather a resistance, but they all come to nothing. Everyone is too tired, too distracted, too sad. And, if ever we did – when the armies of other cities come – the Adams can put thousands of us down with a single burst of gas. A cloud that puts us all to sleep, of leaves us all in blinding pain, and has no effect whatsoever on them. There’s nothing we can do.”
He knew where Tony was going with this. He could see Tony trying to understand this as a trauma reaction, looking for the underlying event – as any reasonable person might.
Steve had curled up under the covers, and squeezed his eyes shut, and willed his body to give into fatigue… But his mind had carried on bouncing around the inside of his skull like a ping pong ball, jumping from one thought to the next without any obvious connection.
laughed then. A proper, from his stomach laugh that he couldn’t contain… and then couldn’t control, as that idea got even
That surge of adrenaline when there was nothing to lose except all the things you could’ve gained, that pure and passionate hope for one particular outcome. It felt immediate, and real-
Steve could feel Tony’s cock, pressed hard against his hip. He could feel that intention coiling in Tony’s muscles. And then Tony moved against him, sending a low friction shivering up his back.
There was so much that had changed about sex. Things that the troops only talked about in the shadiest bars were now the topics being discussed on The View. Things that family entertainers considered light banter in the forties now caused the gravest offence. There were a thousand examples of the differences, but no simple answer to the question
Somewhere to the right of him, someone gasped Steve’s name - more an unwitting exclamation than a comment. Wanda was so outraged that for a moment her face fell entirely blank, as Clint sat forward and tensed his shoulders.
Steve wasn’t sure what to call the feeling that welled up in him then. It seemed wrong to call it a good feeling, when Tony was sharing a personal fear like that. And, of course, Steve would far rather have taken it from him – to have been able to snap his fingers and give Tony the life that he deserved… But it felt very strongly of
Tony looked up at Steve, more concerned than confused. It was the tone Steve had used… the specific sadness of it… And the way his eyes momentarily drifted to somewhere in the middle distance…
He was slightly more eager in opening the final gift, still mainly thinking of getting to the previous one… Until he saw the matching leather cuffs, and the length of silver chain - then his attention shifted somewhat.
And Tony knew, normally, this would be the moment he leapt in there. It just felt like that point in the conversation where he’d raise his voice slightly, or start to speak more quickly… He couldn’t say how he knew that, exactly. He could just so easily imagine himself on the defensive right now. Trying to make the case for his idea even before he was sure of it, because he wanted to convince Steve….sounded very silly now, but still.
“Okay.” He breathed, and then visibly collected himself, and carried on. “Also, you know how everyone in this place seems reasonably normal until about dinner time, and then all of a sudden everyone’s horny at once? I think that’s because they’re obviously changing the concentrations at different times of the day.
He looked up in time to see Tony’s pupils dilate, his face twisting into an almost feral hunger, right before Steve’s eyes.
Steve gave his head a self-conscious little shake, and decided to carry on up to the breakroom. It seemed as good a place as any to sit down for a few minutes, and… well, carry on thinking about Tony.
“And hey, it looks like food now,” Tony observed playfully, giving the pan an approving nod. “Bowls and forks?”
have been able to pay attention… But these simple, perfunctory tasks weren’t nearly enough to distract him from the chaos in his head. He kept finding himself staring at a string of numbers with no idea what he was looking at, or poised to make a note with absolutely no recollection of what it was. Even keeping up a basic conversation with Bucky proved a challenge. Everything Bucky said interrupted a lively and disjointed train of thought in Tony’s head, snapping him back to a world that made no sense…
Steve had never given that night much thought, probably because there had been so many more traumatic nights than that in his life… well, in just that week, when he thought back to it.
imagine what he’d be doing day to day, for any of that to have been possible. He couldn’t imagine it happening alongside him being Iron Man, or working the way he always had. He couldn’t imagine how they resolved any of their fundamental differences in order to get them to those happy moments…
And he’d had a middling level of success with this, earlier in the day. Still high on the elation of having
He was still warmed though and weak, the last tremors of his orgasm still echoing through his hips – entirely vulnerable to every sensation that ran through his softened limbs.
instinct to be closer to Tony, which outran Steve’s ability to process it. His hands caressed roughly over Tony’s skin while he was still figuring out how to get to him, kissing him as desperately as he could in this slightly awkward side-by-side position – until it finally occurred to him that he was going to
But then, Tony had never been one to give up on a personal coping technique just because it wasn’t working.
“But it’s not like I can say, it’s okay to use experimental drugs on people if they’re not on our side.” Steve went on, just as hesitantly – and a
true that he would be happy just to make Tony happy - that he wouldn’t regret any of this, even if it all ended up with Tony happily married to Pepper in the end.
“So, I had a look through all of the files we managed to steal when we were in the basement, and it’s all the day-to-day stuff. Employee files and schedules and some basic details of which drugs are added to what, and when... But, if you look through all the activity, you can see that there are files sent between this server and another server, a secure server – which would make sense. If they have a research facility here, or a production line, or both, then it would make sense that all the technical details and trade secrets and things are stored somewhere else.
they can’t!” Steve outright yelled. “The whole world doesn’t just wait for you to decide you’re ready! You can’t just leave a team mate and the whole strategy team upstairs getting angry because you’ve decided you want to have this conversation right now! Not any time in the last three days, no, you want to talk to me
There was just no grey area left to hide in, no narrative subtlety for him to exploit. No possible way to pretend that he hadn’t been
Two guards appeared, holding what looked like rifles. Then an irritated looking man in a suit. Then two more guards, marching a foot behind.
And that pressure in him just kept building, as Tony pushed him closer and closer to the edge. That feeling of being right at his limit and still being filled, wanting so much to break.
He was vaguely surprised by just how quickly Steve melted under his palm; how completely his expression changed from fierce aggression to total trust.
“Hm?” Steve frowned – and then realised that he’d written these notes on the back of a Talleroy Communications Flyer. A little smile escaped him, simply because he liked that Tony had remembered it. “Oh, yeah, they came back. I think they might even be coming back again…”
And he knew it couldn’t possibly arrive for a few minutes yet, however efficiently Nick Fury was moving-
But he found that there was another page nestled between those two sections - with several words manually blacked out.
desperation now, and need, and lust, and love. Steve could feel it all there, hot and pure and powerful, in everything Tony was doing. In the deep, dull pain of Tony’s teeth digging into his flesh, just hard enough to bruise, right at the limit of how far Tony could go, to feel him and taste him and
And he’d felt the need to dismiss every one of Tony’s questions or objections before he even thought if they were reasonable - he’d resisted thinking about whether they were reasonable, actually, because he was far too focused on winning the argument…
“Oh, don’t worry, everything at The Facility is a secret.” She slurred, dramatically. “I mean, you know who I am, right?” And, now that she said it, he did. Vanessa Liu, CEO of VelSec Communications – he’d actually met her before, very briefly, years ago. A no nonsense businesswoman who was surprisingly softly spoken in real life-
if he was still so angry, he should care about crushing Steve now, why he should feel such sympathy for him or be so reluctant to ruin this.

“We have staff that will help you with that” Belle comforted him. And then there was the slightest flicker of doubt in her eyes. “You’re
But Vomir had come as far more of a shock than Steve was expecting, and he was still getting used to this entirely new perspective of the world. He wasn’t sure he would be able to take anything in if he
Then his mind bounced back to the clutter in his workshop, briefly. A few random thoughts about where he was up to… the amused realisation that he didn’t really know. That Tony had just been
Thinking about all those weeks when he thought they were growing closer, all the moments he found such meaning in, and realising that Steve had been thinking of him as a co-worker that whole time. That he’d been outright lying to Tony’s face
And he didn’t feel guilty or dirty or ashamed – just like he knew he wouldn’t, if Steve were ever really there.
Steve could feel his heart getting heavier, with every cold, functional sentence that Tony uttered. He could
“Yes,” Steve assured him, easily. “I just don’t want to do something thoughtless or dangerous. I never thought this was going to happen. I haven’t thought about any of this. Basically, the
And somehow it didn’t feel personal… In the moment, it just seemed like Tony was more unsure of the circumstances than he was about Steve, per se.
And then there was a nauseating jolt, as Steve laid Tony flat on the floor. An abrasive tug and a shock of cold air, as Steve peeled his bloodstained shirt away from his skin.
, and suddenly it’s a legitimate objection. They label another person as something horrible, just because it ‘doesn’t feel right’ to them, essentially.”
Which meant trawling through boxes of paperwork, without really knowing what he was looking for - only that, whatever it was, someone probably made a lot of effort to cover it up.
He was angry that Steve had just gotten an idea in his head and run with it, without even thinking to let Tony know…
to speak – but no more thoughts at the front of her head to grab at. She was almost anxious when she demanded.
“Did I write that?” Tony blurted out, somewhat embarrassed. That sounded awfully honest for something he’d written… But Steve just pinched a sad smile and nodded his head. “…Wow. Yeah, I can’t remember much of what I wrote either, so, you know, don’t feel bad…”
things he’d said about Steve, and about Bucky, the ridiculous threats he’d made. All whilst Steve stood there in silence, stoically absorbing the abuse - which had only made Tony angrier, at the time…

apologised for Siberia. You wrote me a letter and said you were sorry you didn’t tell me about my parents and you wished you hadn’t hurt my feelings-”
starting to feel a bit more… subdued, now – he wanted to take Tony somewhere quieter. Somewhere safer. Somewhere…
“Okay,” Tony nodded, “We can do this. We’re the Avengers. We beat Thanos today. We can get out of this ball pit!”
But Stape wanted the glory of making this discovery himself. Or he wanted the power that came with knowing the science behind it. Or Jesse had promised him something, or he just
“Ever the opportunist” Steve grinned, as he shuffled back over Tony – forcing him to break his grip before he’d finished stripping him. But then Steve kissed him, rough and hard and desperate now, and Tony forgot all about his previous task. He put all his focus into kissing Steve back, arching his hips up into that promise of friction, just wanting more of him.
Steve sighed, happily, and stood up. He took one final look at Brooklyn, 1938. He acknowledged that this had been home to him once, and would always be home to him, in a way. He remembered all the moments that he was sad were gone forever, and smiled to think that they were happy moments in the first place.
enthusiastic about the whole thing,” Bucky confirmed, at least half as annoyed as Steve was. “And really bad at reading a room.”
Tony’s arms were held tense at his sides now, his fingers flexing and clawing helplessly at the air, so clearly fighting an agonising temptation to move.
Steve let go of the breath he’d been holding, and everything rushed out after it. His whole body weakened, his legs turning to water beneath him - it was more luck than judgement that he managed to fall into the couch. For a few moments, there was only his own heartbeat. And then those few dazed thoughts, repeating over and over-
shock hit Tony as a sudden, disorienting blow, stealing the breath from his lungs in a single, searing rush…
He was so used to people drawing parallels between him and his father, mostly forgetting that his mom had ever existed - it threw him to have someone remember his connection to his mother in the first place…
to stop Steve from talking or to try and distract him, or anything like that. It was just because Tony didn’t know what else to do with himself, what else to do with this feeling-
he couldn’t, though. He couldn’t remember how to prioritise a threat like this, how to separate it from the noise, how to place it into the real world and the person he was-
Everyone thought the team had been pulled apart by the revelation of this horrible secret - but it hadn’t. What destroyed the Avengers was the existence of the
And, obviously, there were a thousand things that Steve would’ve liked to say to that. But an idea had just occurred to him, and it took precedence.
He learned that a vampire was suspected to have been the lover of a ‘high ranking member of the royal family’ in 17th Century France… which

he’d end up thinking something really foolish. Or doing something really foolish, without thinking about it, because every instinct in his body was telling him to sabotage himself.
down like that. Knowing that Tony really trusted Steve with his heart, that he was prepared to put as much of himself into this relationship as Steve had, even though Steve had once failed to even acknowledge this hurt, much less redress it… It made Steve so much angrier; at himself, at SHIELD, at Nick…
He was only barely aware of Steve lifting his head, and shifting away. He felt Steve tugging his clothes down over his legs, and the ripple of cool air over his thighs, and the little swell of comfort as his bare skin settled into the sheets… And he didn’t think anything of it.
“... Kind of?” Steve squinted, trying to think back. “I mean… I don’t know why I would be… And that lady might be right about the flowers, because thinking about the things I’m scared of is weird right now… But, I don’t know, I think maybe he sort of… Unnerved me?”
I won't say what DOES happen - but, yeah, i'd be pretty pissed if a writer just threw that in 150k words in, without a tag, so - that doesn't happen. If it helps.

And he thought… he knew that Steve had difficulty, saying the things he wasn’t sure of. But the things he
Steve flinched to attention, and Tony snapped out of whatever he’d been thinking – a fierce objection flashing up in his eyes.
than the hopelessness… But it was definitely more intense. A stab of white-hot panic as he raced to sort through all this new information-
“Yeah… Yeah, I can do that…” Tony thought aloud. “Cut all the artificial drugs being pumped into the air and the water… turn off any security protocols… Was there anything else?”
sort of such a thing as a truth serum on earth, kinda. I mean, it’s not exactly, but- well, basically it is. And… okay, so…” He traced his fingers over the lines on the screen, trying to think how to word this idea – to himself, before he tried to explain it to Steve. “So, looking at the research files, from the third-floor party – they’re all just plain ol’ human research files, so they’re easy to read… And it looks as though this is how they record it, when they’re adapting a Varian drug, see?”
Steve crossed his arms over his stomach, slumping his shoulders as he dropped his eyes - still wishing he could just curl up in a ball…
hunger on his face as he swept his gaze over Tony’s body, his hands curled into fists like he was clawing at his own palms.
It was like being brought out of a trance and realising there was a gun in his hand. The sudden instinct to not just put it down but toss it aside, to flinch away, to overcorrect. He could not
“Because… I thought maybe you’d be good for him,” Pepper shrugged. And Tony felt an immediate spike of confusion, a subversion of his most basic expectations.
That part of him had always ceded to the determination not to do the same to others. The desire above all else to be a good person. The moral lessons that he still heard in a voice a bit like his mothers… although, of course, he was beginning to forget her voice now…
Tony had tried to ignore the discomfort he could see gathering in Steve’s shoulders, but eventually he found himself trailing off under the weight of it.
Tony had given into temptation on that front three times now; once, because he’d promised to call Steve, then to tell Steve that he’d managed to track down some original texts… and Tony couldn’t even remember what his third excuse had been. Only that, the whole time they were talking, he could hear that devastating hope and unbearable anxiety in Steve’s voice, that question Steve
“The people who came from earth. We call them Adams – the people who run this place, not just earth people in general. Not that anyone here likes earth people in general very much anymore – but it’s the Adams we really hate. They’re the people we blame.”
wanted to talk to Tony about all of that. He still felt like he had to say something now, that if he let it go
Which, for one, made the entire mystery seem so much less… personal, in nature. It suggested a story or an interest or a meaning that wasn’t purely sexual…
And, instantly, his mind picked out the central theme from all the noise. Like some overarching instinct had decided that Steve’s fears about this party and his feelings for Tony and his crisis of self were all peripheral concerns. Something just blocked it all out, and arranged what was left into a plan.
the dumpsters like this, his view was somewhat obscured - limited to the narrow band of space directly in front of him. All he could see was the few feet of paved space between them and the right side wall of the tower… and, yes, what looked like the edge of an outside door.
“...You try so hard, no matter how much the world hurts you,” Tony went on, almost talking to himself now - simply having these revelations out loud, because he was allowed to. “You never let it make you bitter, it never stopped you loving people - and you don’t even know how
By this point, his mindless tour had once again reached the break room - which he’d started thinking of purely as a turning circle. He automatically followed the now familiar route through the kitchenette, behind the couches, past the windows…
He’d spent an hour sitting beside the bath, gently washing the blood from Steve’s skin, soothing his bruises with warm water and soft kisses. Watching the contented smile on Steve’s face as Tony caressed the washcloth over his skin, and washed the sticky heat from his hair. Whispering all those promises and endearments – trading the pressure of keeping them secret for the joy of watching Steve listen.
like anything bad happened,” Rhodey smiled. “Honestly, it sounds like you met someone special, and you actually let them be special, for once. And if this guy made you feel good about yourself – if it’s maybe making you question even… some of this,” and he gestured to the workshop, as a shorthand for Tony’s grim and lonely life, “then yeah, I think that’s a good thing. Stressful, maybe. Simple? Not likely. And maybe it doesn’t change
Also, any advice on additional tags this fic might need in light of this chapter are greatly appreciated.
...And then realisation, slowly coming into focus… How hard Steve was still breathing, how taut his arms still were...
“...He’s out, right now,” Tony tells him, in an apologetic tone. “He hates being out when you wake up, but there was this whole big thing…” he screws up his face, and waves the sentence away,
In fact, as he shook himself out of his deep internal crisis, Steve decided that it was all far more complicated than he was capable of dealing with, right now.
This would always be how Tony found out, and this would always be his first impression of it, and now the choice was his. A choice that he was probably making right now, with none of the details that Steve
to relax his body. Letting Bucky prepare him with sharp, efficient movements, silently willing him to go faster – not saying anything.
, such as they are, they fit with the special, amazing bits of you, they were just the other side of that… I’d have loved all that about you too.”
It would mean never touching him again, never falling asleep against his chest, never being able to tell anyone that Steve was his…
A few hours later, Tony was curled up in one of the seats on his jet, idly tracing patterns in the powdered sugar that he’d managed to get all over the table in front of him, and smiling to himself.
So, when he could put it off no longer, Steve showered, and dressed, and drank yet more coffee – and headed down to the breakroom. Thinking that Bucky would’ve finished his workout by now, and would be either lounging in the easy chair or trying to trick Sam out of it-
“...Only a hundred and twenty people in the entirety of existence get a ticket each year,” Galileo finished with a flourish. And then, as Tony was searching for the least vocal way to bring this interlude to a close, Steve commented nonchalantly,
my suit, and he just ran around pulling wires out at random, and wise cracking about me not listening to my conscience – was any of that on your orders, Steve? Were they
That last observation came out of nowhere. Another thought he’d pulled up, to drown out the memory of himself monologuing about a guy named Jimmy. An argument that melted into the images he was running from, in the most horrible way.
Bucky waited half a minute after Tony trailed off, making sure he really didn’t have anything more to say. And then he just went on, casually,
. Or, I don’t know, a thousand options in between. And, when you said, you weren’t against regulation
Steve broke out into a grin before he could stop himself. Even as he was telling himself that he didn’t know this woman - that he’d never even learned her name - still, her face was so very familiar to him. The friendly face that appeared at the beginning of so many dreams and flashbacks and what ifs… It felt like seeing a childhood friend, or something.
His vision was actually clouding at the edges by the time he walked into Tony’s lab. His voice felt strange in his mouth, as he tried to call out casually,

feel good. There was a power in this, and a genuinely cleansing feeling… It made everything seem less insurmountable, just saying it, like this…
Steve turned to say something, but the door unlatched before he could think what it was. So, he settled for throwing Bucky a poisonous glare, and resolved to put the whole thing out of his mind.
Barely bothering to recognise what was going on when Tony’s fingertip, cool and wet with lube now, began to tease him open, and then pushed inside him… just letting it roll through him. Not keeping track of the time, not building to anything. Just relaxing into the feeling of Tony’s fingers twisting inside him, letting the sensation melt out through his hips and run up his back…
He turned to look, and had a fleeting moment of panic because, at first, he thought it was a child –
By now Tony had reached the curve of his waist. Much to Steve’s immediate dismay, he shifted even further back, kneeling between Steve’s legs so that he could finish opening his robe. A wave of cool air rolled over Steve’s skin, burning over the wet patches on his stomach. Steve gasped, and bucked up against nothing-
“That’s not helpful,” Steve remarked, and then winced, and then threw Bucky another apologetic look,
Tony had warned him that, for a minute or two, Zan was likely to just break down into a stream of consciousness – and they should let her. That, however infuriating and time consuming it seemed, it would make the rest of the interrogation run more smoothly if they let her get this out of her system first.
Tony groaned, angrily, and pushed himself up off of the couch with far too much force. Suddenly, he was enraged at the entire world. Furious at the injustice of his very existence. And it was petulant, and it was immature, and it was obviously pointless, because there wasn’t even anything to be mad at.
So, he wasn’t going to have one now. Even though his muscles were still tensed with it, even though it was still an annoying noise at the back of his head – he resolved
He’d felt dirty saying it back - even though he was quite sure it was still true. He absolutely did still love Pepper…
“Well, imagine the most fair skinned person you know, gets dropped buck-naked in the middle of the Sahara, in the middle of the day, in the middle of the hottest summer on record, miles away from the shade – they still won’t immediately burst into flames,” Tony explained, “
just been thinking that it was a stupid thing to say. He minded less, when Steve looked at him like that… like he cared if he’d hurt Tony’s feelings. Like he’d bothered to think about what Tony might hear, and not just what he wanted to say. In fact, on the strength of Steve’s sincerity alone, Tony had the sudden inspiration to add “You don’t have to never mention my dad, you know”
“...I was just thinking… That maybe I’m not mad at Steve any more…” he said, like he was trying it out. Rhodey narrowed his eyes at him.
“...There are people you can talk to about that, if you need to. I can get you a list of the people who know.”
“Depends,” he answered, reasonably enough. “Some batches are… I don’t know, more nutritious? Depends on what blood it is, and how healthy the donors are – and how much of it I can bring myself to drink, at the time. I mean, some of it’s just
Steve barely swallowed a scream, caught off guard by the hot pleasure that curled in him as he clenched around Tony’s fingers. Tony pulled his hand back slowly as he dug his teeth deeper into Steve’s flesh, the spike of pain meeting that surge of pleasure, the contrasting forces pulling him apart from the inside out. He could feel himself on that knife edge, the urgency of the moment cutting into him-
for people just living here like this. Just too many personal variables – and that’s assuming the planet is emitting these things at a perfectly constant rate. Which is almost certainly isn’t.” And Tony stopped, and took a little breath, and pointed back down to the papers on the table again.
Which was just too close to being nice for Steve’s liking, so he instinctively leapt in to direct the conversation. “Do you feel any more sober yet?”
Yet another person reminding Steve that he wasn’t special, that his pain and his loss weren’t special - all the while expecting him to
He wasn’t actually thinking about his introduction to SHIELD anymore, or about Nick or Nat - but, whether he knew it or not, it was all feeding into his elation. There couldn’t possibly have been a more symbolic or cathartic beginning to this new chapter in his life. He could

himself… By then, the three of them had fallen into a comfortable sort of quiet – which Tony barely noticed. His work for today was delicate, and fiddly; tiny little amendments done with very fine movements and needle tipped tools. Tony was so focused on that one connection in Bucky’s arm, thinking so deep into the theory behind it, that he’d forgotten there were other people in the room-
If he wanted to ask Tony to go with him to an event, or if he had any advice on a personal problem, or if he just wanted a hug-
“Thanks,” he smiled, “But I think I want my own bed. For, maybe, ten hours…” Oh, it was hard to sit up, to even
Well, it was as good a lead as Tony was hoping to get. And, now that he had it, he was oddly anxious to get out of this conversation… to go and share it with Steve…
spiteful, or selfish… it was the opposite of that. This was a feeling of overwhelming love and devotion, an desperation to be closer to Steve, to share that much of him… a rising desire to do this
Tony braved a quick glimpse at the woman - who, sure enough, seemed entirely nonplussed by Nat’s remark. If anything, she seemed somewhat pleased to have been noticed.
“You think?” Rhodey groaned, without malice. And then he snapped up to meet Tony’s gaze, and added, “and how the hell have you turned that into a
that. There was something about Steve Rogers, something in the way he looked at Tony or the way he looked out for Bucky or the fact that he was the one person to get this far in the first place. Some nameless quality that existed in the way Steve held himself, something Tony couldn’t quite see… but he could
“Captain Rogers, I understand that this must come as a huge shock to you,” Nat said softly, in a voice that wasn’t even her own. Steve almost laughed again.

someone the way he’d missed Steve. He’d never looked forward to anything the way he was looking forward to getting home. He’d never been as excited about anything as he was right now…
“And we’re supposed to ask!” Rhodey remembered out loud, in a burst of enthusiasm. “That’s why we’re here, to ask about the flowers.”
And then Steve felt his throat tighten treacherously, and suddenly he was finding it hard to control his breathing.
But Steve’s attention was snapped away from them when he heard Tony stand up, and then take a little half step towards him. The hair on the back of Steve’s neck stood on end, his breaths coming fast and shallow as he waited. He could feel Tony running his gaze down his back. He could
It was the first time he dared to ask himself what he meant by ‘a thing’. The first time Tony had allowed himself to actually try the word ‘relationship’ out for size, the first time he’d even
He knew that no matter how good his performance, however enthusiastically he grimaced or moaned, it would be the equipment that Stape looked at first.
mental spiral…? But he didn’t have time to think about it.  Immediately, he resolved that he would just have to put all this aside until they were gone. Wait until he had time to think about it properly, reserve this breakdown for when it wouldn’t make anyone else uncomfortable…
The part of him that had missed Steve so much – he hadn’t even realised how much, until he saw him again… but oh, to have just had a few more minutes with him, to have been able to talk to him for a little bit longer…
And it didn’t occur to him to question it – he just ran with it. Falling from one fantasy line to the next. Rushing onto the next bit because he
His head began to throb with the pressure of all these words, until eventually the weight of them condensed everything down into one solid idea-
a stupid plan - or, not even a plan… And if I wasn’t being so childish, and just… trying to get Steve to notice me all the time, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” he huffed.
A good fifteen minutes of trying to make a list of his problems. That proved frustrating and fruitless
His anxiety, and his hope, and his elation - and, most notably, his guilt - had grown steadily as he’d fully woken up, until he felt so much of everything that it was like not feeling at all. Like a tingling numbness he could feel on his skin, like a barrier between him and everything else…
been practising some sort of opening statement – but he’d suddenly forgotten all about that. “Are you busy?”
“Well, this is one of the many burdens that comes with great genius,” Tony announced, theatrically. “Unfortunately, I have figured out how to fix this problem,
“Tony, I’m - sorry-” he whispered, suddenly worried that he might cry - worried that if he started crying, he might never stop. That he might just fall into this endless, wretched emptiness-
When they finally landed in New York, Steve spared the most fleeting observation that he was probably supposed to check in with Fury - with absolutely zero intention of acting on it, of course.
“Do you know anything about a ‘special project’?” Steve got back to the point, his voice cold. “Something your boss – Adam, is it? – Something big he might be working on?”
trying. I trust you with my feelings because it turns out they did always matter to you… And maybe I should have assumed all that, thinking about how well I know you… And, actually, maybe a lot of this happened because I didn’t trust you enough… I should’ve given you more benefit of the doubt. You’d earned it…”
In fact, it wasn’t until he was actually standing at the gates of Camp Lehigh, breathing the familiar smell of Spring 1970, that Steve realised that he
Tony’s breathing grew faster and shallower as Steve began to suck very gently at his neck, teasing with the edges of his teeth. That heat coiled tighter in the pit of Steve’s stomach, his cock throbbing hard as he heard that pleading edge on Tony’s voice-
He stuttered to a halt a few feet away, and their eyes met again. There was a beat between them, which was either emotionally charged or just awkward - Steve was in no state to tell.
“Hey,” Steve smiled back. He also looked as though he was blushing, but Tony knew by now that it was just the flush he always got across his cheekbones when he was
Steve let his head loll to the side, a giddy smile washing over his face as he all but lost himself entirely…
to. Steve’s arms braced across Tony’s back, his hands caressing into Tony’s skin as he pulled him closer, gently pressing his mouth open wider, kissing him deeper-
And then, when Tony had stripped Steve completely, he put a firm hand to the centre of Steve’s chest, and told him,
He would get out of this room for a moment, go and get a cup of coffee, make a sandwich - anything to force a break into the day.
, we can’t see things that are perfectly obvious to you…” She spoke, bitterly, to somewhere over Tony’s shoulder. Like she wanted him to know she was angry, but not at him. “And… when I saw your –
He didn’t know it at the time, but that may have been the moment he decided. The moment of blinding clarity in which he realised that this group of people would really never come together as a team again - and not just because of the layers of trauma and unresolved anger and interwoven mistakes that they would always be trying not to argue about.
“Well, thank you,” he replied, trying to let go of that possessive energy. “I appreciate it. And I apologise if I’m still a little jumpy on occasion - but it is getting better. Honestly.”
…No, but really, did he? Because he knew that it’d once felt so inevitable, so unavoidable, that these things would come up… But they
Most of Tony’s sexual history was with people who didn’t feel anything for him at all. He’d preferred things that way. He’d always picked the people who weren’t impressed by him, the people who weren’t intimidated by his reputation - the people he wouldn’t disappoint simply by existing, because they’d never expected anything of him in the first place.
thing I’m thinking right now, is that I want you – and maybe I should be thinking more than that… And if I shouldn’t have – if that was exactly the wrong thing to do, right now, then I’m sorry-”
Now he didn’t know whether the Avengers still existed. Who had the right to call themselves that, who decided, on what grounds. Whether every Sorcerer of Kamar-Taj and every member of the Dora Milaje was now an Avenger, seeing as they had answered the Assemble call in the fight against Thanos. Whether he had any stronger link to Thor than to Valkyrie, if he was more loyal to Clint than to Peter Quill, as much a teammate to Shuri as to Bruce…
And then they were both right in front of him, and Steve suddenly found himself a part of the conversation.
Tony pointed at the sparkling jars still standing on the countertop, “were a project I worked on nearly five years ago, an attempt to detect and neutralise airborne poisons, do you remember?”
happy,” Tony sighed – not for the first time this evening. Steve giggled, a joyous, contagious sound that Tony could feel humming through his own ribs.
It was just one of the thousands of words lost in the haze of his head, one of the things that had broken down into pleading moans and panting.
“Everything about that idea bothers me,” Steve replied - but, before he could clarify, Tony cut him off with a disappointed sigh.
“Well, that was the plan,” he nodded. “Although, to be honest, I don’t really care what they think they know - as long as Hydra don’t get their hands on Time Travel, which I don’t think they can, now that the Pym Particles are all gone…”
He hadn’t meant to. Some part of him managed to feel bad for it, even now. It was one thing to go to Bucky, as a friend, to satisfy a physical need that they both understood. But fucking Bucky while he thought of someone else –
He didn’t stop to wonder how much of it was basic human lust, and how much of it was genuine love, and how much of it was this vampire thing that Steve didn’t fully understand-
“Sure, no problem,” Bucky smiled, glancing up with interest as Tony waved a hologram into life beside them.
Remembering the press of Steve’s lips against his throat, and the power of Steve’s arms wrapped around him, and the heat in his voice as he whispered,
That same warm feeling that had flooded through him all those months ago, when he’d watched Tony sit down, cross legged, on the floor of his workshop. There was an almost childlike joy that was simply part of Tony, something that had stayed there under the surface in spite of everything he’d been through. Something that wasn’t always on display… But, apparently, Steve liked it very much when it was.
“Official consulting hours are between five and eight,” he muttered, taking the file from her without so much as a glance. Talking purely for his own amusement, now.
Tony was briefly overwhelmed by all the issues he’d never imagined would apply. Thrilled and terrified to even be asking himself whether he could actually
And then Steve pinched his lips together, bashful and hopeful and touchingly vulnerable, and gathered himself in that courageous way of his-
“Don’t worry, everyone does that when they walk into one of these” Tony sang, as he strolled past him. “I mean,
Steve let go of a frustrated moan. He told himself that he was irritated by his own lack of attention, and the seeming hopelessness of this task…
, I know why you don’t get to do that very basic thing a lot of the time. But, since the chance has come along – I’m glad you’ve not got the chance to sabotage yourself out of it, there I said it.”
“I dunno… I guess this is usually where I start to worry about all the things that might happen…” Bucky explained, thoughtfully.
Tony just looked at her, incredulous, baffled that she wasn’t able to see the seriousness of this and somewhat frightened that he might have to
look on his face… Tony could see the little flicker behind his eyes, the subtle crease of concern above his brow – all the thoughts that Tony
he could feel an additional tingling on his skin. An edge on his nervousness, something he was sure was more than the natural response. He thought back to what Maribelle told them,
Tony he overthought and analysed… With his subtly different temperament, and his different collection of opinions - some of which might already have been shaped by the fact that Steve had been here-
“Well, that’s success number two…” Tony commented casually, resting his weight against Steve’s side.
As had been happening all morning, a memory flashed up behind his eyes, without warning or permission - yet another image of himself, naked and pleading and offering himself up, overwhelmed by that pure, perfect desire to submit-
“You both carry a lot of responsibility.” This time it wasn’t a question “And you both have a rare obligation to be
fuck Steve – if that was all it was, if he’d even been able to separate that part of it out, then he probably would’ve just run with it the other night in the lounge, or gone straight to this when Steve got to this room. But it had never been that. He would never have wanted this if Steve didn’t… but it was more than that. He’d only ever wanted this
a direct order, not to be a smart ass? Did either of them know what any of those wires did, whether I was just going to drop out of the sky – if he was going to pull out an emergency response, that I’d not know wasn’t working, when Wanda was throwing cars at me – Do
He forced himself to take a breath and unclench his jaw. He counted backwards from five, slow and even. And then, purely for the sake of asking, he glanced up and said,
Steve was sure this was probably bad, but for the moment, he could only recognise the surreal humour of it…

He glanced up at Gary again, even though he knew it was too early to move. He clenched his jaw very gently against the build-up of tension, and breathed through the beginnings of a fluttering in his chest-
And then Tony looked up, and their eyes met, and for a second Tony thought he might be crushed under the sheer weight of this moment.
been considering it. He’d very much enjoyed being able to just sit and watch Tony – simply being able to think about how much he loved him, without having to worry about what he was doing with his face.
“But we have no evidence of anything,” Nick shrugged. “No debris, no recent activity in the area. Nothing.”
And then the little flash of defiance before he softened again, his hesitancy falling away from him like a weight he’d just dropped - like he was
Suddenly he realised… he’d been avoiding the whole issue of being attracted to Tony. He hadn’t even known he was doing it – but in all the many, rambling conversations they’d had about Tony, Steve had never once mentioned how pretty Tony was. He’d never shared any of
Bucky had always been clear that anything was preferable to being numbed. And, as with all lived experience, it had always been difficult for him to explain… but the simplest answer was that HYDRA had never sedated him for surgery. HYDRA had always favoured the quickest, cheapest route when it came to the repairs – which meant numbing Bucky’s torso so that he wouldn’t move, and making him watch while they worked.
“So, you like him, but you don’t know why you like him?” Rhodey summarised, and Tony laughed in spite of himself.
“Okay Wesley,” Tony intervened, before Wesley could attempt to struggle through his surname, “We’re going to get you some help-”
Tony watched as JARVIS dutifully transcribed his ramblings onto several different holographic screens - so far titled ‘The Death of Mr and Mrs Stark’, ‘Hydra’, ‘Aliens’, and, diplomatically, ‘Steve Rogers’ and ‘Time Travel’.
donate my blood to a hospital, I guess anyone would tell me to do it. Nat and Sam probably do, thousands of ordinary Americans do, and it’s not any great hardship. And it’d be
forceful, more vocal – that he’d fought harder for this thing, that he’d made a stronger case for it
Falling into Tony’s shoulder and sobbing, right from the bottom of his chest… That dizzy, singing elation that rolled through his head in the aftermath, the heavy softness that was left after he’d let go of everything else…
“You’re planning on doing something dramatic,” wasn’t even a question. “Do you even know what it is yet?”
And then Tony gave a needy little moan and sat up, suddenly, twisting so that he could kiss Steve’s lips.
So, Tony arranged his expression into the appropriate level of welcoming interest, as Steve stood to attention beside him, and together they watched one of the children bravely step forward – an enormous glass bottle cradled awkwardly in both arms.
It was three days since he last went into cryofreeze, and, all things going according to plan, he was finally finished with that part of his treatment. On the one hand, he did feel more connected to the world and more aware of his surroundings and more confident of the passage of time… He knew he
. And, more importantly, he would prefer if they didn’t connect Captain America to Tony Stark, just yet.
Steve could hardly breathe. It was like there just too much excitement flooding through his body to leave room for mundane things like air. Tony was moving so urgently, so completely lost inside his own body, separate from the world. Somehow disconnected from Steve even though he was so impossibly focused on him. Steve couldn’t work out how to meet his movements, how to make sense of this frantic, animal urgency. He
Steve felt his smile fade. He took a little breath, and did his best to conceal the painful twist in his gut. To ignore all the disappointed, critical voices in his head.
A few loaded glances and a fundamental understanding of one another was enough for them to communicate their basic plan, all of which had taken maybe thirty seconds to decide between them, even without words.
At least the task itself had become significantly less uncomfortable the further through it he got. When he
Tony’s head swam – which, by now, was probably 90% excitement and 10% oxygen deprivation. But he stayed there, sucking and swallowing and pulling Steve in, wanting more of this, wanting
God, all those things Obie said to him, that he’d blocked out for so long. Things he’d decided were creepy and ridiculous and nonsensical when he was 21… But, what if-
He remembered a bottle of ‘water’ being handed to him from the shadows as he walked off stage. He remembered his relief, his immediate instinct to open it… Apparently louder and more pressing than any of his previous anxieties. He remembered that it was nice. That it made him feel better.
“Indeed, sir,” JARVIS responded politely. “As yet, I am still unable to decrypt the files stored on Alexander Pierce’s personal server, but all other files are still available.”
He only had to picture Tony’s face and his body relaxed, an excited smile trying to fight through his tense expression.
something nice about indulging his emotions like this, being angry and resentful, not caring what anyone else was going through
The computer said something else, something being initiated… it just bounced off of the outside of Steve’s head.
“I just meant, uh… I’m not saying I wasn’t completely drug fucked, I was… But I still feel like I knew exactly what I was doing, and it was exactly what I’ve always wanted to do. And, I know that might not be true of you, or, I don’t know, half true, or-”
too strong to be pleasant. Immediately Steve’s eyes began to water, his throat spasming with the desire to cough or gag. He felt…
And it was so in Tony’s nature, to fall in love completely. To give himself entirely, and to trust, and to try…
something supernatural… But Tony hadn’t always known the moment that Steve got home. He hadn’t always felt the urge to care for him. He hadn’t
- and the thought of hurting a friends feelings was about the only thing that could tug a social response from Steve, at that point.
In fact, hearing Tony say it made him realise just how big a thing that was, what it meant. It was the first moment that Steve had consciously acknowledged the strange feeling that had been growing in him for weeks… That specific security that Steve felt around Tony, and how it had bled into everything else, and… that Steve
“Well, I don’t know how much of this is my mood right now - or how different everything might feel when I actually sober up…” Tony accepted, light heartedly. “...I suppose if all my
In the hour since he arrived at the safehouse, he must’ve walked at least ten miles in laps of the living room. His legs were starting to throb with the exertion of it, and a prickle of sweat was beginning to collect across his shoulder blades-
He reminded himself to focus on the mission. Take notes. Keep an eye on Tony. That was all he had to do right now, all he should be doing-
concrete basement, filled with huge, ugly, machines… connected by iron pipes… some with valves… some with gauges...
And then the breakroom speakers broke into life, immediately blaring a wall of drums and guitars and synth that Steve just registered as a noise. He sat up in alarm, triggering the motion sensor lighting into life, scanning frantically until he saw the outline of Bucky walking through the left-hand door.
, and - not just tonight. Throughout this whole thing… I could never have done this without you. I…” But the words fell away from him, as it finally dawned on him that he
“Oh, yeah, of course,” Steve muttered on autopilot, leaping back to let Tony walk by him - his mind still focused on the blow he knew was coming.
Steve tried to ignore the creeping feeling that was making its way down his spine and sank into the chair.
Steve recognised that he was clearly here to say something significant – but he just couldn’t keep his worry from bursting out of him.

“It’s just the way everyone there talks about them,” Steve sighed. “Everyone was using the word ‘unnatural’ today – like a memo had gone out that it was the correct term, or something. Like it’s the thing you’re
And Steve was very glad that Tony was still averting his gaze, while he was doing his little double take.
? You never said, why bother sitting yourself up, if you still need a nurse to do everything else for you, or whatever. So, do you not think, maybe it’s worth just doing a fun thing, however small, just cos it’s
The way every muscle tensed in perfect anticipation, pulling Steve into some ideal version of man. Like a renaissance sculpture of God.
He didn’t even know if he’d fallen into it or if Tony had pushed him. He just found himself sprawled on his back, on crisp, white sheets-
telling himself how important this was, how he had to think very carefully, that this was all about Tony…
Tony had meant to tidy everything away before they arrived. He’d gotten into the habit of cleaning up before these appointments… and getting himself
to Rhodey’s question. His mind simply provided whichever responses would limit discussion, and therefore get him to Steve the quickest.
Tony was lying on the floor of his workshop, gazing up through the ceiling and into his own thoughts, when it occurred to him that it had been exactly a week since he’d bitten Steve.
He knew he’d reached the point where he had to say this – to keep Adam from moving, to stop himself from doing something worse, to prevent a rage induced heart attack-
It was getting harder and harder to silence that little voice each time - but that didn’t mean Steve wasn’t still trying.
It was the pleading tone he’d slipped into right at the end. The way Steve’s eyes widened as that little edge of desperation finally cut through.
His cock throbbed against the front of his pants, and instinctively he flinched into it. The low drag of friction caught him of guard, eliciting a needy little whine and an immediate craving for
He’d visualised what would happen if he panicked, and got it wrong… He’d pictured it in such horrific detail that he was still getting occasional pangs of fear that maybe it had happened…
Steve hissed, flinching upright, his muscles tightening and trembling under the shock. A thousand needle sharp shivers ran over his skin, his cock pulsing against his stomach as every nerve lit up. He blinked, and looked at Tony-
He heard Tony sigh softly as he settled into him, his hands caressing into Steve’s skin. And then Tony rocked into him gently, a slow, shallow motion that dragged a deep, low sensation right from the core of him.
Steve huffed bitterly and let the file fall into his lap. And then he sat up to collect the folder he
Tony sighed, and took a moment to shake out his shoulders before he answered. Assuming it would be Pepper or Rhodey-
Steve felt his heart skip, his breath coming to a burning halt in his lungs. A sudden thickness in his throat, a pounding in his ears.
And then he saw Steve’s eyes flit, briefly, over to Bucky – and suddenly he remembered that he was supposed to be doing something else.
“It kinda overwhelms me, sometimes, how smart you are.” Steve observed. Just because he was thinking it.
“And you didn’t once feel sorry for me, or think, hey, I know how people make these choices. If that wasn’t going to make you rethink keeping secrets from me, you’d think it’d at least make you nicer about it, if I’d kept a secret from you. But no. And even after that all happened, and I’d told you how fucking sorry I was for lying to you, you never once stopped to think that
been a week since Tony drank, and maybe it was getting to the stage where he couldn’t concentrate through his hunger any more than he’d be able to work through that high. And it wasn’t as though he could avoid the issue for much longer-
“I never say ‘I don’t know’, because Captain America wouldn’t” Steve admitted, in the same slightly hesitating, almost eager tone… Like he was having the same crisis about whether he could say any of this out loud. "Which, on the one hand, is obviously ridiculous. I mean, I
“And, in the meantime, I’ve got to sit here and work out a bunch of highly theoretical chemical equations, so I can maybe have some idea what we’re looking for when we get there.” He explained, already sitting down in front of his papers again. “So, you can either go exploring, or sit here and watch me write equations.”
, that’s the thing you were trying to do with models. Some of the time, the computer is a faster, more accurate way to tell you what you were using models to guess. But, a lot of the time, a model will tell you something a computer isn’t even looking for…”
get to call Tony Stark arrogant, when you’re the one letting himself into people’s houses, and sending people into spy on them. You do not get to teach him life lessons, when you don’t even know who the fuck you’re working for. Do I make myself very clear on that?”
It never occurred to us that, just, ordinary people could go to work every day in places like that, that people would ever think that was okay. It was worse than when Hydra did it – although I don’t know why, really, because
“You don’t believe in aliens?” Steve almost teased - but then he remembered himself, and the tone he was aiming for, and corrected himself before Tony could answer. “Sorry… I forget how crazy this all sounded to me, once… But yeah, he was an alien - and powerful, and feared across the universe… and
“Someone does,” Bucky said again, just as coldly. Stape stuttered to a stop, his eyes flashing with a helpless sort of alarm.
“He’s there… right now, with… Them?” Steve murmured, dazed, his eyes drifting into the distance, like he was talking to himself…
“Good morning, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS answered politely, “Mr Stark asked that I remind him of the weekly team meeting. It’s due to start in an hour.”
,” Tony breathed, arching his hips so that Steve could undress him, tugging his pants and underwear down over his thighs in one rough motion. The cool air burned over the tip of Tony’s cock, sharpening that need into a painful desperation.
What Steve had was the lived experience of how SHIELD, and The Avengers, and The Accords, and everything else besides, had worked out in the first timeline.
It had never occurred to him, before The Facility. Perhaps it was simply that, on Earth, it was a far more awkward and complicated prospect. Steve was too well known on Earth, his identity carried too much baggage – there were too many reasons never to make himself vulnerable like that, in a public place. The idea of doing anything like that
,” Rhodey was telling him, pointing at the van. Tony nodded, and folded his arms, and waited impatiently for one of them – any one of them – to get out.
He’d watched himself wake up a thousand times, from every angle, in two different timelines - but never once had he spotted a reference to Nat being there. In fairness, Steve hadn’t been looking for her. He’d never considered that she might have been there, because he didn’t already know that she was. It had never occurred to him that she might’ve been…
that you’re sorry. Not even that you were sorry – that you were sorry my feelings were hurt. You were sorry I didn’t agree with you. That one line, in a whole letter, and never another word since. You just wanted to come home. So, of course, I said yes.”
Maybe Steve had just felt so sorry for Tony, and so angry on his behalf, that he’d confused it with feeling something
And then he saw the way Clint’s eyes had darkened - that one of his erratic, random attacks had apparently struck a nerve.
And when he tried to… He found he couldn’t even remember what half of these words were for. He couldn’t be sure he was remembering any of them right. He couldn’t remember whether they were things Obie told him
