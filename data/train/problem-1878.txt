John did. In fact, he took a very deep breath. "So now I've…said that. And…Sherlock…are you alright?"
"He doesn't have one."
"Right." John swallowed down a nervous giggle. "So…are they always like this? The fantasies?"
Perhaps Sherlock was in Prague for pleasure after all.
John drew in a steady breath and narrowed his eyes. "Who

At least he could take off his costume now. All of it, the clothes, the expressionless face, the indifference. Sherlock kicked off his white shoes a little more viciously than was necessary just to hear the noise they made when they hit the entryway wall, which turned out to be a fairly unsatisfying thud. The vase, he suspected, would do better. He grabbed it by its neck, swore just as viciously as he thought

John's lips twitched. "Good. Because, Sherlock," he took a step forward, brushed his fingers under one of Sherlock's white lapels. "I'm about to ask you a very important question."
"You left me such a nice canvas. This her, then?" the young man…Raz…jerked his head at Radka, looking her up and down.
"Mm," Sherlock grunted, reaching for his mug.
"Not the point, cheeky." Lestrade swatted the boy affectionately with the towel, but his eyes on Mycroft were wary. "He's a stranger to you and we're going to have a talk about this later."
"Perhaps you should allow me, Mr. Holmes, as you don't seem to have reached the correct conclusion on your own."
"Who…?" Mrs. Turner craned her neck, then laughed. "You don't mean

"Question three. We've heard now what you'd all like to do for our lovely Janine."
Henry shifted his weight and chuckled self-consciously, "Well, actually,
"Sometimes I do, but then sometimes…yeah," John sighed. "I have no idea."
"Careful," said a soft voice from just inside the open door to Sherlock's office, "your guests might talk if they saw you smashing up your own island."
"Is that what they taught you in medical school?"
"Experiment?" Sherlock brightened immediately.
. "And welcome to Fantasy Island."
"Er. Yeah. Good. Well. My name is—"
"Obviously, I do." Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I'm offering you a job."
Henry smiled into his drink. He hadn't realized when he ordered that it would be served in a coconut with a little umbrella sticking out of it, but he didn't even care right now. It was such a warm, sweet evening.
Sherlock shook his head as though John was being remarkably obtuse. "So that's settled. You'll accept the position."
There were extra flowers in the garlands draping the rails of the welcome dock and floating in the fountain. Less drumming, more lilting melody for the music. The hors d'oeuvres were all sweet.
Sherlock gave him a look.

"Phoning Mycroft."

"Then say what you mean," Sherlock snapped, "or get out. Some of us have work to do."
Archie waved his orchid proudly.

"It's astonishingly simple to read what people want." Sherlock looked John up and down and smiled again, like he'd just learned everything about John he'd ever need to know. "You're all so transparent."

"Why would we narrow it down?"
"I don't."

Lyons' hand twitched in the direction of a salute before John could reach out to offer a handshake.
"Right." John shifted behind the podium. "Sebastian?"

"And you aren't relaxing."
"You see?" John nodded. "Brilliant. Well...that's said, so I'll just…let you get back to whatever you're doing, there."
Radka dismissively slashed a heavily be-ringed hand through the air. "Never mind that. I have discovered something far better. I fear, Mr. Holmes, I will be taking your artist instead." A muticolored paint smudge peeked out from the scooped neckline of her black blouse. There was a distinct blue thumbprint on her collar bone.
"What?"
"Old habits," Lyons said wryly, and shook John's hand. "I'm only just over two years out."

"Do what you like," Sherlock snapped back over his shoulder. "Everyone else does."
"That was…nice. A nice thing. Thank you."
John spotted them at the edge of the crowded garden, holding hands, chatting with a long, lean man in a slim-fitting white suit. John blinked.
"You knew they'd…get together. Somehow. Change her plans for her gallery. And…and give Raz a place to show his art."
"I see," he said. "Hey, Archie, see over there where they have those meat and fruit things on sticks? Why don't you run and fetch a couple for us whilst I say hello to your new friend?"

"I'm not here for pleasure."
"Oh, you
"And he picks the most interesting ones," Mrs. Hudson smiled up at Sherlock fondly.
Sherlock clenched his teeth. "Neither."
John, who always drank Earl Grey, narrowed his eyes.
"I don't suppose you could spare one of those?"
"People, John. I meant people."
John pushed his tea cup aside. Galbraith took a deep, shaky breath. His hand in John's was ice cold, damp. Sherlock's was hot and dry. The disparity was strangely disconcerting, like he really was touching two worlds, caught in the middle. The room was completely dark now but for the licks of firelight. John hadn't noticed the overhead light dimming.
Mrs. Turner giggled and gave her cropped silver hair a little fluff. "Well, I needed a plus one, didn't I? Good thing I picked such a charming one. And with my Danny still away in Afghanistan—" The light in her eyes flickered and she shifted her gaze back to the window.
"And speaking of creased, where is your illustrious Captain? More to the point, where is my phone?"
"And you've found a way to make that happen?"
"Mycroft!" Sherlock held his mobile to his ear as his voice went false-bright. He listened briefly, blinked, and his eyes shifted to John. He cleared his throat. "Yes, well…that…isn't why I've phoned."
"Lestrade…arrested your brother?"
"Sherlock, do I have to hold you down for details?" John threatened, completely cheerfully, because Sherlock was smiling again and everyone had left
"Hi, Molly!" Archie dashed up clutching a somewhat squashed orchid and an orange flip-flop. "Will you tell me about some more dead people whilst we're flying?"
John spared a quick glance for Sherlock, who was standing beside him like a statue, stone-faced and unmoving, before he gave Mrs. Hudson an encouraging little smile. He would be nervous, too, addressing so many people.

"The least tedious ones. I deduce their
The audience chuckled, charmed already.
"Okay!" Archie nodded agreeably and dashed off across the lawn.
"You do that."
It's not *really* a ghost story, but this felt like a special Halloween episode to me! Kin and Kind will pick up next week. Happy Halloween!
"See?" Archie crowed to Molly after one look at Mycroft's and Lestrade's faces when they arrived back at the dock. "I told you."
"No. I don't know who that is. I'm Archie." Archie hopped up on the bench beside her. "I'm here with my dad."
"Okay," John said, and waited a beat. "So we have another client."
and I could make a difference and I…I promise not to, you know, hump your leg in staff meetings or anything and I…fuck." He slapped his hands over his face and dragged them down. "This is the worst interview I've ever given."
The cheerful little yellow and white plane was waiting in the lagoon, door open to the gangway. A few staffers lingered nearby to offer refreshment or assistance.
"Whatever else she may have felt for you, Sherlock Holmes, she is still your friend and she deserves better from you."
"Ah, I see." John frowned. "No, I don't. What?"

"That was." John blew out a breath. "Something."
"You are. I know it hurts, but let me stay," she touched his chest again, "here with you. Don't seal me off in rage and despair and
"Sir? Perhaps you missed the announcement. We're beginning our descent shortly."
"Henry Knight is a wealthy man," Sherlock explained, smiling into a sip of his tea. "A very wealthy man."
"Because you love me. And I love you. Very much, dear."
John frowned and shook his head. "No. I don't…well, I don't know you that well any more."
"Yes," one of Sherlock's eyebrows quirked up, "I deduced as much."
"Oh. Er, thanks. But what about you?" John frowned down at the curved bamboo grip in his hand. "Wait. Isn't this Mycroft's?"
Molly tilted her head, "But those trousers still look quite nice."
"Very well," she agreed reluctantly.
"No, I'm not."
"Mmm…no."
"Sorry," Henry gasped, ashamed. "I'm so sorry."
"No!" Andy shouted, rushing forward, hand outstretched toward her heart. He didn't care. He didn't care what she said. She was beautiful. She used to be so beautiful. So kind. "Soo Lin,
John grinned back. So, maybe now was as good a time as any. Since he was
"Right. Simple. And two people's lives changed." John huffed a wondering laugh. "So this would be the part of the process where everyone is amazed by your powers of observation and deduction."
They exchanged a look and John snorted a laugh.
Sherlock frowned at him. "Party planner?"
Sherlock sighed. "It will crease the suit. No."
They exchanged the sort of pleasantries along the walk two people exchanged when a much more significant conversation was looming, the flight, the weather, the layout of the island, but almost as soon as Sholto's suitcase hit the floor John couldn't hold back his real questions any longer.
"Well, hello there, Ushi," Mrs. Hudson beamed. She introduced herself to the white and black-spotted dog and then pointed up at John and Sherlock. "And this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes and his friend, Captain John Watson."
"It certainly isn't yours," Mycroft scowled, flinging the towel away in order to snatch the bloody
After a moment, Raz sat down beside her, watching her. He looked like he actually understood what she was doing, there on the floor.
(Clasped hands, warm eyes.)
. The sooner he understands that, the better."
Lyons slid his hand, his strong, reassuring hand, into Henry's, and stroked his thumb over the backs of Henry's knuckles.
"Of course." The blue uniform moved blessedly away. "
So John's excitement level pulsed when, just after his morning tea, he received a text from Sherlock to meet him once again at the island's reception garden. New guests, perhaps. Or a
"Yeah, come on," Lyons nodded encouragement and sent Ushi into the other room with a quick hand signal. "I've been in the army. I'm used to a command voice," he grinned.
"But it's fine now," Molly went on. "
Probably. That was why people were so seldom noble.
Inside, they lay side-by-side on the floor, Radka's head by Mikolas' feet, the stone cool through her summer-thin cotton dress. Mikolas chipped away at one grey tile with his flimsy pocket knife, scratching his initials. "This place is

"Was it good?" Even though Andy couldn't hear them, John felt like he should whisper in the silence Sherlock was keeping. It made him a little angry with himself, but angry as Sherlock made him, John still wanted his approval.
Henry swallowed. "She…intimidates me."
"Yes, you're a man of many skills," Sherlock said drily, but he shot a quick, appreciative look at John's hands at the same time.
"I know." Sholto looked away. "I…couldn't."
It was simpler, easier, once they switched to business mode. Mycroft's defenses were admittedly more difficult to summon outside his familiar environment and attire, his ready armor, but they were firmly back in place now. He had much to chastise himself for in allowing himself to get so sloppy. Literally as well as metaphorically. There would be time for self-recrimination, though. This was the time for mitigation.
"Yes, John,
"Ugh," said Archie. "Dad, look, it's your salesman friend."
Sherlock rolled his eyes at John as Andy looked down at the table, blinking rapidly.
John folded his arms and walked toward Sherlock. Slowly, his eyes cast thoughtfully down. "Because you
that could use me."
"Yes, John. Yes. What you said. And…" Sherlock's voice was rough. "I do
Sherlock stood there, frozen in the middle of his last word. The tip of his tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth. His eyes wouldn't blink. He had on a white suit and no shoes. He didn't have shoes. Everything was quiet. And he
"So…I have to ask…" John began, oddly emboldened by their shared dismissal, as he watched Mrs. Hudson walk away, watched Sherlock's curls disappear into the shade of a tree-lined trail.
John was headed back to his bungalow when he heard the scuffle just off the path, and of course he didn't hesitate.
"Major Sholto," Sherlock said. "Welcome to Fantasy Island."
"Obviously I knew about it, John," Sherlock's mouth set in a hard line as he jerked his arm away. "And now that I've stood through it, I'm getting the
Sherlock scowled past the flush of color that rose on his face. "I told you this

Sherlock's smile twitched. "Correct."

"I had planned to save this announcement for later in the evening…hopefully after you'd all had much more to drink."
and it seemed the storm was long gone. "Because I will. Do you really want that?"
"Oi! Down from there!" Holmes's Prussian-eyed assistant shouted, surging into motion as they rounded the corner into a little enclave of poorly maintained buildings made of concrete, brick, and steel instead of bamboo and palm leaves. He took the cross-bar of the scaffolding nestled against a white-painted wall in one quick, determined step up and caught the man clinging to one of the vertical bars by the back of his t-shirt collar. A can of spray paint rolled into the sandy soil at the base of the building, a former church from the look of it, pristine but for a slash of black paint beside one arched window.
"That won't be necessary." Sherlock flicked a glance over the private first class compartment. Leather seat, wide table. Adequate. "I'll be working."
"It's what they wanted."

"Finally," Sherlock murmured, tracing a finger over the route from the British Embassy to the Embassy of Japan. Obvious, really, where the documents were most likely to be found—there were only three possible locations that Czerny could have stashed them. And the guard's body, of course.

John flinched, thinking immediately of his every stray glance at Sherlock's mouth, his hands, his beautifully-fitted trousers. "But I didn't come here for a fantasy."
"Oh, bless, they're so excited." Mrs. Turner cast a fond gaze over her shoulder, focused on the two men currently embracing in the center of the scrum. "So kind of them to invite their poor little old landlady. I do love a wedding."
Sherlock started. "No."
James, because he's my
Andy was just sitting, blank-eyed and calm.
"Yes, of course," said Sherlock, bringing up an app with the local tram schedules. On the night route, if he'd timed it properly, Czerny could have slipped into either the church or—Sherlock rolled his eyes—of course there was a Starbucks.
The man huffed a laugh. "No," he said, his voice gone gravelly. "No, you…were a little…quicker about it than I might have been but…no. You've, er, got it exactly right."
John grinned. "Yeah, well, hence the pirate fantasy."
He would obviously never say as much to Sherlock, but it was a beautiful island his brother had chosen to spend his time and energy on, frivolous as his pursuits may be. Even Mycroft, normally susceptible to precious few temptations, was susceptible to relaxation in a place like this. The rain-scented wind stirred again, whispering secrets across the leaves.
? A woman, a man, any sort of relationship?"
Sherlock sighed. "Oh, shut up."
He'd taken a few uneventful walks around parts of the island, considering them patrols and probably in line with his still unspecified duties. The leg of his patrol that had taken him past Raz's studio had been particularly quiet. The windows were shuttered and John could only assume Raz was hard at work on the Vermeer for Miss Wenceslas.
"Yes."
She patted his leg. "You're a good man, John Watson. A good friend to my boy. You deserve this trip. I know you've had a hard time of it, dear, but you deserve good things."

Sherlock frowned. "You want a

"You…heard all that, right? For
"Yeah, right, we're opening like a new show, innit?" he beamed. "Art by yours truly."
Ushi blinked up at him, head tilted quizzically.
"You shouldn't be here."
"Thank you," Lyons nodded. "We're happy to be here, aren't we, girl?"
"I…want…" Sherlock started. And then…nothing.
"It was a stupid idea. It's not going to work."
"It was long. Let us skip the pleasantries, Mr. Holmes. Can you deliver on your promise?"
"Romantic?" John looked at Sholto.
"No, I mean…it says here, you don't have to pick just
John raised his eyebrows.
"She's a pit-beagle mix actually," he told Henry, smiling fondly. "I found her when she was just a puppy. Abandoned in a field near the base. There were
"I'm aware of that, John. I'm the owner."
"Well. You know."  He shifted against the growing tightness of his trousers, eyes drifting helplessly toward the dais. "Sexual."
"How?" Janine shook her head helplessly. "They're incredible, all of them. Like they've walked out of my fantasies. How can I pick just one?"
Sherlock pulled his hand away and took Andy by the shoulders. "We have you. You're back with us now."
. Don't leave me there in that cold. Be my heart. My warmth. The gentle man you are.
"They…certainly don't seem to object." He felt keenly aware of how close Sherlock was standing, curls ruffled once again by the jasmine-scented breeze, except this time under moonlight. Sherlock's hands, John noted, were quite large. Long-fingered.
"If someone's giving you trouble, they'll answer to me," Fletcher said gruffly. "I know how to take care of myself and mine, and I'm sure you do too, because you just sound like that sort of woman, but everyone needs someone to have their back sometimes, right? Well, that's me, for you."
"John, as you can plainly see," Sherlock gestured at him, "is very much
John's jolt of adrenaline, prickling him into an instant wary alertness, had already allowed him to process as much, even in the shadowed blue half-light. This man was no threat. No
Sherlock's head jerked around, his eyes narrowing. "What about him?"
Janine looked impressed. "I think I want to go on every one of those first dates."
By the time he came, rocking into the man's hand and biting his lip almost bloody, eyes squeezed shut so tightly he saw stars, his trousers were around his thighs and his shirt was on the floor. His handsome companion was similarly mussed and manhandled, silver hair sticking out wildly in all directions.
Sherlock shrugged. "Unfinished business. I…owed him a fantasy. He'll be happy. Well…happier."
John did his best not to let his eyebrows fly up when Raz, whose fingertips were stained blue, winked at him.
Mycroft held up a hand. "That was not a

"What's his fantasy?"
"Have left the few you had in Afghanistan behind. Your injuries, both physical and psychosomatic, along with the tedious sympathetic expressions you are subjected to on a daily basis have eroded your confidence. Your army pension is inadequate to maintain a life in London without immediate supplement. In short, you are at a personal, functional, and financial loss with very little to return to in London." Sherlock paused for a breath and looked at John, waiting, perked up like he was expecting a pat on the head or a saucer of milk. "Am I right?"

"'Course I can." Raz grinned cheerfully. "I don't know hardly much, you're thinking, I can see. But I do know art."
work mattered. And then he'd been shot and just like that he didn't matter anymore. When Sherlock had hired him it was ostensibly for those same skills, and John had finally felt hope again, like he could once more be a part of something bigger, just like Molly said. Except he hardly ever did anything here a doctor or a soldier would do. So what did Sherlock want him for? Maybe it was
"All right, Sebastian, it sounds like you're ready to speak up next," John said, and got a low snicker out of the audience.
Sherlock's eyebrows drew down. "Fine. I'll explain it so even
John offered Mrs. Turner an arm through the chaos, admitting, "And it is beautiful, yes."
"It is to someone who's been there."
Mrs. Hudson lifted an eyebrow at John. "That's a very good point, Mr. Knight."
"You are a wedding guest," Sherlock said neutrally.
Lyons watched him.

It was big Paul's voice that was soft and shaky, thick with emotion. Ravi had delivered his vows in a clear, unwavering tone, eyes shining with conviction. They made a handsome pair, Ravi in a classic black tuxedo and Paul in a blue and grey tartan kilt.

caught in his throat so he could speak again. "Soo Lin?" It came out in a miserable sort of squeak. He wanted to be a lion for her, but he was just a mouse.
"That reminds me," Sherlock pulled his mobile out of his pocket and pressed a key to dial. "Mrs. Hudson! You'll probably want to set the fountain up in the courtyard of Ms. Hawkins's bungalow. Yes, the
the fantasy was fulfilled. There would be time for him to adapt to that. He would have to adapt.
"What do you mean?"
He stood there for a long time after John left, and even though he was by himself, the villa didn't feel empty anymore.
Ushi rolled onto her side and peered up at them, panting happily, like she was pleased with Henry, too.
Sherlock met Sholto at the dock the next morning.
"Sebastian here. Janine, I have an appreciation for the finer things in life." This one spoke with an easy arrogance. Public school. City. "And I can tell
His captor shoved him toward Holmes. "What do you want me to do with this one, Sherlock?"
Major Sholto's scarred face softened. John beamed. There. Clasped hands. Warm eyes. The fantasy was going to work out perfectly.
Radka looked up instead of down, looked at the paintings, the sculptures, the vases. Fruit and flowers, waterfalls and forests, dogs and dragons, silky falls of fabric and bared breasts. This was theirs. It was hers, all the wide world of freedom in this room, and the shouts of the protestors in the Square sounded much farther away. She touched the dirty sole of Mikolas' shoe with one fingertip. He was hers, too.
"This isn't the response I was anticipating," Sherlock said, voice muffled by his pillow. "And it wasn't a complaint. And those aren't my thighs."
John cleared his throat. "I'm more of a one-on-one sort of…bloke."
"So you're free this evening."
"For fuck's sake!"
"No. You don't have to. I don't want revenge. I just want you to stay with me."
"How will you make her feel better? And let's start with Fletcher this time."
"Mm, not a patch on Cilla Black," Sherlock made a regretful little

in direct connection with his feelings for Sherlock, but now it seemed as easy and as inevitable and as painfully bright as the sun rising. "And far too easy to love."
"Paul and Ravi must be beside themselves."
Mrs. Hudson cleared her throat.
Sherlock shrugged and looked away, muttering something in the direction of the skull-and-crossbones topsail.
John shifted his water glass to one side so he had a better view across the table of Sherlock's notebook. He raised his eyebrows. "Waterfall sex? Is that something I'm going to need to look up online?"
Sherlock, who had fixed John with a puzzled stare, cleared his throat. "John, Mrs. Hudson." He presented the lady with a flourish, as if she were a game show prize. "Since you ask so persistently, behold. Mrs. Hudson is the start of

Mycroft was looking more ill at ease by the moment, but his eyes shifted thoughtfully to Molly.

"I wish he had warned me about you," Sherlock sighed. It was already too late, though. His arms had broken out in gooseflesh. His whole body felt hot. He was ready to run. And he wanted, even more than to find a body, to hear
"Hm. And I have two slicked-up hands. See how that works out?"
Lestrade blinked. "A job."
John giggled. "That's…sweet."
"Well, before I choose, it's really only fair to ask…" Janine spoke towards the dividing panel, "what do
And he had, hadn't he? Oh, yeah. John had got it wrong. "So…just a game show, then," he said softly, on a wry little half-laugh.

"Yeah," John pointed at Sherlock's face. "Mostly it's been a lot of that. Not that, you know, I'm expecting some sort of declaration. Just because I said…what I said. I don't even know if you want—"
"Get over it. Stop being afraid."
Sherlock drew in a deep breath. "John, you could still—"
"The most observant man I've ever met hasn't
"Yes. I'm wearing different clothes. Well-spotted, John."
Mycroft adjusted his tie, checked his tie pin, checked that his watch was properly situated in his waistcoat pocket. He'd put himself together, but he hadn't slept yet, and he hadn't been able to leave the thought of Detective Inspector Lestrade alone.
"Neither do I." Sherlock leaned back in his chair. "So spare me the sentimental babble you're no doubt here to spew."
"Shhh!" Sherlock spun John around and gave the jacket an impatient tug down John's arms. "
"No?"
?" John blinked. Lovely as she may have been, the
watch dead people! Cool!"
Sherlock flashed John a smug grin as he slipped into his white suit trousers. "The headwaiter will be instructed to mistake him for the new chef, arriving just in time to save the evening's service. Angelo will make the obvious choice."
Sholto's arm tensed, but he didn't withdraw it. "And I've missed you, Watson." He looked down. The late afternoon sun caught his pale lashes. "John."
"Assistants?" John toed at Wiry, who groaned. "Medical staff?"
Sherlock's chest tightened, painfully, like someone had knocked the air out of him. "Of course I don't want him to leave. Is he leaving? Why is he leaving?"
"You must have been boasting."
"I gave Lestrade my brother, Mycroft."

Molly nodded. "I see."
"Do I know that? You haven't actually said
Mycroft inclined his head slightly. "Thank you."
"Well, certainly not me," Molly chuckled. "It was the same with me, actually. That…fascination. After my own mum passed and…so he reminded me a bit of myself, actually. At that age. And also a bit of someone I…care for. Cared for. So I liked him. Straight away. Archie, that is. So…sorry, I'm going on quite a lot, aren't I?"
The staff (Molly could still picture the assignment rosters in Sherlock's headquarters) had done an amazing job in setting up for the reunion. Noah had shown her all the venues and activities: hula lessons on the north beach, drumming lessons in the acoustically-resonant Azure Cove, fishing, guided hikes to the falls, canoeing, a garden for the children to make their own leis, and even a great bloody pirate ship to tour. Aunt Sissy had been beside herself over it all when they met by the reception fountain, blinking back tears after she finally released Molly from a tight embrace.
"Sherlock?"
and he's come a long way. We're going to talk some more. Like friends. Then he's going to leave. I'll schedule his return flight for tomorrow morning. And I'm going to stay here. On the island. With you. Because I'm in love with you." He looked at Sherlock expectantly.
"Oh, right." John blinked. "Wait, the what?"
"Mr. Holmes, John Watson gave me the impression you paid careful attention to the phrasing of your clients' requests."
"Er," Molly glanced at Lestrade, who rolled his eyes.
. And if we have to bother…I like pastries."
"Sorry," Lestrade apologized when he and Molly caught up, "I think we're a little…excited to be flying out. "
The audience chuckled again, a little more salaciously. John wondered who they all were. Staff, probably. He couldn't make out faces.
personal, though. I'd love to show you how I perform the service."
Holmes's pony glanced at him a little uncertainly before he addressed Radka directly. He had, the art curator in her could not help noticing, Prussian blue eyes. "Don't worry about that, Miss Wenceslas. You're among…friends…here. Professionals."
"We do?" John blinked. "What client?"
John started and blushed, feeling caught out, although he certainly hadn't
"Of course, sir. Can I get you—"
"You want to put that down, then?"
and, really, he could barely speak at all so how could he be expected to form a less embarrassing sentence?
"Mrs. Hudson," John shook his head, "we aren't—"
John bit his lip, still tingling from Sherlock's teeth, and sat down in the sand, too, wriggling his bare feet while he waited patiently. He tried not to feel too smug, or too giddy with anticipation of their next experiments, but he mostly failed.
John smiled sympathetically. "Yeah, I thought you had the look. And it's John, please."
There was a short silence, before Sebastian spoke.
"That's nice," Henry said.
John stared.
John sighed and rubbed at his forehead. He was going to have a permanent dent there, soon, he was sure of it. "That's all I'll get out of you, isn't it? Fine. Go on, then."
"Sherlock," John bit his lip. "All these things. Have you…tried…much of this? Before?"

"Whilst your conclusions about the Bruce-Partington case may have been incorrect, Detective Inspector, they were extremely well-reasoned based on the knowledge you had at hand. You are clear-headed and thorough, and…once personal concerns are set aside, which as you see is a very simple and easy matter for me…not unpleasant to work with. You pursued your goal of an arrest for Andrew West's murder with impressive determination and in the end you did not apologize for any…actions…taken in that pursuit. I appreciate your methods. We could use a man like you."
Sherlock looked thoughtful, but what he was thinking John couldn't even begin to guess. "Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade."
Andy nodded and picked up his tea cup with a face like he was about to walk hot coals. "It's bitter," he murmured after his first sip.

"Of course you bloody are. John, some things are

at the man, to gain access to his private rooms. His data.
Sherlock coughed and straightened abruptly, smoothing down his jacket and avoiding John's stare as Mrs. Hudson led Lyons past the reception garden fountain and toward the bungalows, Ushi trotting along happily beside them.
The man jerked the folder back out of his grasp and took a deep breath. His soft brown eyes had gone steely dark. "In that case. Mycroft Holmes. I'm taking you into custody. For the murder of Andrew West."
Sholto gave him an extremely bland look. "Mr. Holmes."
John turned his attention from the biplane bobbing in the lagoon. It was just Mrs. Hudson and himself there to farewell the guests. Sherlock had returned to his habit of leaving it to them, off doing whatever he did in his private office.
"Say it, if you please," Mycroft said softly.
"Yes."
, not hidden away. We will turn the palace inside out," she whispered, then blinked herself back to the present. She gave Raz a sharp nod in the direction of the plane. "Suitcases."
"I think you should know I have a
"Does that mean you give people medicine?"
"I…excuse me?"
"Good. I suppose." John looked out into the rain and sighed. Truthfully he didn't care much about the client right now. He didn't care much about whether Sherlock was going to fill him in on the details or not. He was tired. Confused. And cold. He felt like he had a lot to think about, but right now he didn't want to think. He just wanted a hot shower and dry clothes and bed. "Okay. Well. I guess I'll…turn in."
"Okay, then," John nodded, turning away.
am I, to lay claim to your affections?"
"That's the hardest part," John glowered, snatching the cards from Sherlock's hand.
"Dad! This is Molly!" Archie presented her proudly. "She experiments on dead people!"
"Okay, now I'm almost worried about who's getting off that plane if
different now. You
Sherlock's gaze wandered along the far side of the placid, palm-shaded lagoon before them, waiting. "Client arrives. Fantasy. I amaze everyone by demonstrating basic powers of observation and deduction."
"You saw the files."
"What's this?"
The man did something with his face John might have described as a smile, if it had been one. "That is, in essence, my question for you, Doctor Watson. Who are you?"
"Yes."
Sherlock blinked. "
?" John, feeling for Andy's pulse, started again as Andy lifted his head, blinking slowly.
The man's head snapped up, mouth open in surprise.
"You…" John shook his head in disbelief. "You can't actually believe that. Can you?"
Mrs. Hudson reached out and gave Ushi a welcoming pat on the head. Ushi wagged her tail enthusiastically and gave Mrs. Hudson an adoring look.
. But as a conductor of spiritual energy, he is unbeatable."
John frowned.
"I'm glad you're here now," John said with all the warmth and acceptance he could put into the few words.
"John, really.
John's mind summoned up was not Janine-shaped. Taller, for one thing. Far bigger hands. "No, that's not…why would you say that?"
"Right, so don't you have…people? You must have a lot of people. Why would you need

would be nice. Someone, perhaps, who would have him doing some of the most ridiculous things he'd ever done…like hosting a game show. Someone who could be, frankly, a right arsehole sometimes.
John chuckled. "You've been saying that a lot."
"He is the fantasy."
it," Sherlock huffed, shooting John a defensive glare.
So as John dragged himself back to his bungalow in the late hours of the evening, running a weary hand through his hair and glancing up in worry at the rolling clouds that had begun to crowd out the stars in the night sky, he blamed his distraction and fatigue for the fact that it took him a moment after he stepped inside to notice the man in his sitting room.
"A relationship, obviously. You want a relationship."
"John, I find my staff in need of fortification with a particular combination of medical and security skills. Skills you happen to possess."
"Never you mind where they came from. That does mean they aren't true. That man is a magician."
As the sound of rain poured into the silence between Mycroft and the man whose arms he'd just fallen apart in, Mycroft cleared his face of all expression. "What exactly on those pieces of paper you're holding makes you believe I had anything whatsoever to do with the murder of Andrew West, Mr—" Mycroft closed his eyes. It was he who had insisted on
"Mrs. Hudson!" Sherlock snapped, then cleared his throat. "Our client is arriving."
Sherlock's arms tightened around him. "I wish we'd had more time," he pouted. "Two days, not enough. I haven't even finished compiling my notes."
Lestrade stared at him. "You invited me home with you."
"That's yes,
"It's…a bit like a cross between a doctor and a chemist."
"John?"
. Right. The sort who didn't need to pose a physical threat.
Sherlock sighed impatiently, "We've said
"John is also a doctor," Sherlock frowned, looking between them.

Sherlock looked like he was about to actually burst out of his white suit with pride.
Soo Lin laughed, the gauzy covering stretching over her face where a mouth would open. Another pulse of blood bloomed over her heart. "Why would

It was entirely possible, however, he had made a mistake in estimating his ability to remain unaffected. Sherlock reminded himself once again that
"Good evening, Doctor Watson."
John grinned into Sherlock's shoulder.
"This was a bad idea," Sherlock said.
"Age-appropriate."
"No," she shook her head and smiled. "That's not what I was afraid of. Andy, I was afraid you would leave me."
"All right, Janine, love? I'm called Fletcher, and I run a sort of…tourism business in the beautiful, picturesque, you'd-love-it village of Grimpon. Devon, right? My own business, self-employed. I'm enterprising. I'm creative. I'm fit. I'm a good bet. And Janine?"
The audience cheered.
"See that one, with the red door?" Raz pointed down the street. "That's my studio. Come tonight."
"Don't worry, Fletcher, love," Janine shouted out, "I adored your answer!"
"Oh, my God, her

"Sherlock, he's not a bloody video player. And if you've hypnotized him or whatever, why did you need the drug?"
"Such as your mobile phone. Sir."
. And
Eventually, after much waving and sniffling, everyone was on the plane and headed for home.
"Sherlock, you have a lovely cannon."
. Sherlock Holmes is a
"Yes," Sherlock looked away, into the distant darkness. "I think so."
"I told you," bold as a rat, Raz leaned over and ran a thumb across her cheekbone, like he was making a tally mark. Like war paint. "I know art."
Sherlock gave a blithe shrug. "Don't let me stop you."
"Smiles, everyone!" Sherlock barked at the staff assembling at the lagoon. Several of them flashed nervous looks at him, as though he might be behaving strangely. More strangely than usual, that is. Sherlock glared back at them and they scurried, bright smiles plastered across their faces. If he was being especially demanding this particular morning, which he
"Right."
," he declared proudly. There were dark smudges under his eyes.
Mycroft shoved file folders brimming with sensitive government information off the coffee table and then shoved the man with his big hands all over Mycroft's arse down onto the sofa and climbed on top of him.
"Let's welcome, erm," he forged on, peering down at his blue card, "Janine Hawkins!"
"And then the client leaves."
"Someone had best bloody well be dying here, Sherlock," John dropped his bag on the floor so he could start peeling his way out of the wet cling film his jacket had become, "or I swear to God I will—"
." John scowled and gestured to the garish, pink-and-purple lit stage. Beyond the lights, an audience of shadowy faces murmured anticipation.
"Give me another half hour or so and, by God, you're going to feel it again. You can write that in your notes right now."
"Oh, did I not mention the reunion?" Sherlock smiled, all incisors. "Oops!"
"Sherlock Holmes," Mrs. Hudson closed Sherlock's office door behind her firmly, her face set with resolve, "I want a word with you."
"No. But it's what they wanted. Their true fantasy."
Preparations for Mrs. Hudson's family reunion had been running the entire staff of the island ragged, John in particular, setting up venues and arranging activities. He felt as exhausted as he had ever been since taking on this job, and it wasn't even for a proper
"Very good."
"And you look happy, too," Mrs. Hudson bent down to pet Ushi when the trio stopped in front of them. Ushi wagged at her furiously.
John chewed on his bottom lip for a moment. The back of his hand where Sherlock's thumb had touched his skin felt different from the rest of his body. Like it might be glowing. He glanced down. It wasn't. Sherlock had given no further indication anything unusual, anything
"Well…thanks," Lyons grinned. Torchlight flickered in his dark eyes. "That's, er, nice to hear."
John saw no reason not to encourage that from happening. "Sherlock. You…are amazing. You are the most incredible, amazing…amazing…I need more words for how amazing you are."
"Right.
Just as the little yellow and white plane motored up to the dock, Sherlock drew in a sharp breath. He turned to John, his morning sky eyes suddenly urgent. "It's this."
what people want. Which is precisely why I've called you here this morning."
John grinned and moved his hands to the backs of Sherlock's thighs.
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Just…a little help?"
Andy swallowed. "Here?"
"Hello, Raz. Decorating again?"
"Are you okay?"

Ushi was squirming on her back on the carpet, feet pedaling the air, grunting happily while Lyons rubbed her white-furred belly.

open the door—Mycroft!"
"No. Well, yes." Lestrade sighed. "If I'm not already sacked after that…I'm not sure you're going to want to employ me. Because I'm about to be honest with you."
Archie's eyes got even bigger and brightened considerably. "You

Andy and John both repeated the name and drank.
"I think you're taking the name of the island a bit too seriously, there," he said, not unkindly.
"Everything. Everything about you. The way you're so quiet…but so strong. The…the way you can look like you're laughing and sad at the same time. The way you see beauty in the simplest, smallest things. And I should have told you. I should have told you when I still had the chance."
"And you couldn't even make it a star. You're such a control freak."
"Archie?"
"Is he a

"I fell in love with you."
out of here."
"Oh." John's smile spread slowly, almost painfully, like he felt his chest swelling at the same time. Like it was taking in the sunlight and the sweet breeze across the grass and the gentle rhythm of waves caressing the shore and it was never going to let any of it back out again. "Mine, too," he said huskily.
"Yes. Sherlock." Sholto's smile was wry.
"No. As I've stated quite clearly already, nothing."
Sherlock bounced on the balls of his feet a little, eyes shining. "What do you think?"
"Decent," Sherlock sniffed dismissively, but his disdain lacked potency. "Who cares about decent?
"I'm a pathologist."
"Ah," Sherlock gasped. His mouth opened. Closed.
Mycroft, though, had always loved a good storm. A cool puff of wind from the north stirred the hairs on his forearms, exposed by his decadently rolled-up shirt sleeves. After a contented sigh, the kind he only allowed himself when he was assured of his solitude, Mycroft took a long swallow of scotch and then cupped his hands against the wind to light a cigarette.
Sherlock's arms obeyed in slow motion. The metal buckle fastened with a
Sherlock heaved a weary sigh. "
"Yeah," Henry beamed, squeezed so hard he could have grunted in delight himself. "It was. It really was."
"Mrs. Hudson presents me with the tedious requests and troubles of the island's potential clients."
John felt for a moment like the ground fell away from under his feet. He didn't fall, though. He was lifted up on flames. He wanted nothing more than to launch himself into Sherlock's arms, except that Sherlock's arms were now folded over his chest, close and defensive. "So, what's wrong?"
"You were?"

"Ugh," Sherlock waved a hand. "I visited the reception lawn earlier this morning. Briefly. Everyone was
"No, Sherlock. Of course I don't want him out for revenge, but this," John pointed at the tear tracks on Andy's face, "
"Sir, it's for—"
"Sometimes." Sherlock gave him an odd, searching look. "Problem?"
Sholto chuckled. "Yes. That sounds like the John Watson I know."
Andy's worried gaze shifted to John.
Sherlock frowned. "Oh."

But then, Sherlock supposed he wasn't being so
"I've just seen Ravi. He seemed to be a quite…satisfied client."
Mrs. Hudson, retiring. What was John going to do without her, someone to talk to when Sherlock was off in one of his black moods? Someone who truly understood what a colossal arse Sherlock could be. And what a bloody marvel. What was
"And he said, 'Oh, no…I'm taking that back to base.'" Sholto's old grin flashed, brief and shy, and left a sparkle in his gentle, aquamarine eyes.
"You aren't a polite person." Sherlock glanced down the captain's body. "You're a person who's going to be bored waiting around for a return flight. And you're ex-military. And you're a doctor. And you're wasted shuttling passengers and hot towels back and forth for my brother."
Sherlock shrugged, sighing, "Yes, sometimes one has to make do."
"You look nice. Er. Colorful."
John frowned. "We haven't had row."

John didn't think it was his imagination that Sherlock seemed a bit cooler, a bit more formal around him since the awkward (mortifying) backstage conversation where John had only just narrowly avoided making a
"We did well to wait for this storm," Sherlock said as he seated himself across from John and Andy and poured himself a cup of tea from the white pot. "The riven sky unsettles the spirits, stirs them."
"John, what are you doing?" Sherlock stared at him.
"Were a long time ago. A lifetime, it seems. And now…you're in love with him."
"It's a lovely ceremony," John said, keeping his own voice politely low, although Sherlock hadn't bothered. They were in the back row, at least. John had thought it best to leave the closer seats to friends and family.
She looked around furtively—Archie's father must be around here somewhere, after all—maybe with a similar set of tumbled curls and, oh, wouldn't that be lovely? She didn't see anyone that seemed to be looking for the boy, though, so she leaned in and whispered, "But just the other week there was a man, an exciting case. Nobody could tell how he'd died until I did some tests and found out he'd been killed by a very

Mrs. Hudson took a deep breath and opened her mouth to speak, then closed it again. She gave him a long, thoughtful look and then said, carefully, "He wants to care for someone."
Sherlock shook his head gravely. "She would speak only to you. Did she tell you? Did she name her killer?"
"Are we speaking again?" John asked, all gold and smiling and
The plane rumbled up to the narrow, flower-festooned gangplank connecting the lagoon to the garden and cut its engines.
The man threw one arm behind his head, scooting up to prop himself up on a cushion to grin at Mycroft, naked and sticky from neck to groin. "Yeah. Lovely," he echoed with a wink.
John snorted a laugh. "How's that going to come about?"
"I wonder why not," Mrs. Hudson said wearily. "Sherlock, I know this sort of thing is difficult for you—"
"Oh." John's stomach dropped with a rush of jealousy, even as his gaze sharpened with curiosity. "So you and he…"
elegant, John. Not only will Henry Knight recover in time from his fear of dogs, but he'll fund Will Lyons' animal shelter."
. Bloody
John stilled on a caught breath. His eyes flew to Sherlock's, questioning.
"Sorry?"
And then Sherlock made a
"I have an erection."
"I don't know," John looked around the deck and tried not to sound doubtful. "We'll just need to use a little extra imagination."
"It's okay, Andy."
"So." John adjusted his new white blazer as he took what he hoped was his expected place at Sherlock's side in the reception garden. He was bristling with curiosity. First real day on the job. First real day behind the scenes. He was eager for details, eager to prove his worth. "How does this all work?"
"No."
"Orgy, dear."
Sherlock frowned. "John's fantasy."
He turned and saw it, the statue draped in ghostly white. The fabric fluttered though the air was not moving.
"One of the events was a sleepover for the kids." The man scuffed his battered sneaker over one of the gazebo floorboards, smiling down fondly. "Archie wanted to go."
"Because I am in love
"I understand about Sherlock Holmes."
"I fulfill fantasies. Fantasies all you vacant idiots don't even realize you have. Fantasies I am the
Voices rose nearby, just around the curve in the pathway.
"Dull."
A silver-haired man with a friendly, slightly crooked smile put his hand on Archie's shoulder.
"What for?"
Lyons flushed. "Sorry. That was…it's none of my business."
"What's that, Kate?" Janine leaned forward in her chair, tilting her head to listen, "Besides sounding absolutely delicious, that is."
A woman in the row in front of them glanced over her shoulder, frowning a bit. Sherlock gave her a ludicrously simpering smile.
"I assure you I am not."
Janine cleared her throat.

"Archie!" Lestrade barreled around the corner, a wet dish towel in one hand. "I told you
"For forty-eight hours."
"How do you like your bungalow, Dr. Watson?" she smiled. "All settled in?"
Sherlock was waiting on the lawn, slim and neat in his white suit, and he turned and smiled as John approached. John swallowed down the breath that caught in his throat. Really, those curls shouldn't be allowed exposure to golden morning sunlight or gentle breezes. It wasn't really fair.
Very much.
Henry's eyes shot to Lyons' face to see if he was having a laugh at him, but he looked perfectly serious. "Whenever you're not wound up about the dog, that
"Okay," Lyons stopped petting the dog's belly. "Come on over, bit closer. Ushi, stay."
"And you, Major Sholto."
"But not so much you'd have sex with them."
"That sounds boring."
"There's always something…"
Finally, Sherlock was out of distractions. The sun was low in the sky and the island quiet as he made his way back to his villa. He had not heard from John all day. Not that he had expected to. John's attention, he was sure, was otherwise engaged. It was a good match, John Watson and James Sholto. A common past. Mutual understanding and affection. Sholto was, despite the public view of the doomed mission in which he'd sustained his injuries, a good man.
"And…?"
"All right, then. You're
Watching Lestrade leave, Mycroft indeed felt defeated.
Lestrade sighed fondly. "He knows everything."
Henry blinked.
John took Andy's hand and then Sherlock's. Andy's hand was loose in his. Sherlock's grip was tight.
John's eyes went wide.
"Molly Hooper. Professional pathologist and amateur babbler. I'm here with Martha Hudson's party. The family reunion. Are you…?"
"It's simply been…
"Well. You are brilliant, after all," John grinned.
The audience
you're his friend," she said firmly.
"Er…where is everyone?"
. The breeze ruffled the man's dark curls and his eyes, Caribbean-clear, shifted directly to John.
He hesitated some more. Sherlock didn't look up from his mobile.
John didn't return the taunt, because a slow smile of realization was spreading over his face.
"Good evening, John."

"You and Mrs. Hudson have known Sherlock a long time. Has there ever been
"Okay, then." John coughed a little into his hand. "Janine, what do you think?"
? He glanced at Mycroft, who was watching him with dry amusement. John frowned harder.
John hid a chuckle, turned, and walked toward the voices, raising his. "Believe me, you do not want to come this way! Someone had a bit too much piña colada and roast pork, if you know what I mean."
"And what is that, exactly?"
"Is there anything in particular I should do?" John asked,
He heard a skittering sound behind him and spun. The white iron corner brackets in the doorway arch looked like lacy cobwebs. There was nothing beyond the door but darkness.
"For you." Andy turned. And gasped. Took a step back. The white sheet was stained with blood, seeping slowly from where the statue's—from where
"Of course," Mycroft said, polite and easy.
John turned and followed her wide-eyed look to see Sherlock standing in the entry of the dining pavilion. John started, guilty, like he'd been caught doing something wrong, but converted the motion into a wave. Sherlock's eyes narrowed at the three of them and then he turned on his heel and walked away, shoes flashing white with each quick step across the rain-jeweled grass. When John turned back, a welcoming smile was fading from Molly's face.
"He probably just hasn't realized it yet."
"No." John shook his head immediately. Scarred and saddened as his old friend was, different as he was, he was still
"Well, then," Janine sat back, eyebrows raised. "We'll have to exchange tips."
The back of Sherlock's knees hit his chair and he flopped down into the leather, a hot chill shivering down his belly, and
"Particularly towards me. Because you will miss me."
"Murdered?" Archie leaned in eagerly. "What poison?"
necessary, and pulled back his arm for a throw.
He had admitted defeat, and that rankled. He knew Sherlock's hand was in this, but it was Lestrade who had outplayed him, Lestrade who had carried out the plan perfectly. Seduced him to gain access to his files, taken advantage of his tropical island lassitude. If there was one thing Mycroft Holmes knew, however, it was how to turn any situation—even a defeat—to his advantage.
Mycroft turned, unhurried, to the source of the slightly gruff voice, a man walking up the steps of the gazebo towards him. A handsome man, hair as silvery as the moon on a clear night, dark eyes twinkling. He stuffed his hands into the pockets of his frayed khaki shorts and gave Mycroft a sheepish smile. He looked like a beachcomber, although clearly he couldn't be. The island was only accessible to staff and guests, all strictly screened. Mycroft had nevertheless frequently admonished Sherlock on his decision not to install security cameras.
He took his time tidying himself, collecting himself, before he returned to the sitting room with a clean towel and a glass of water.
It was bittersweet, returning to Fantasy Island, although time had indeed eased much of her heartache. The breeze was still warm and fragrant. The flowers were still brightly vibrant, the trees still rustled sighs. It still felt like she belonged here.
. My experiences could be different with you.
"Sorry?"
The museum was dark after hours. Just puddles of sallow light over the display cases and tricky patterns cast by moonlight through the high windows. The sound of Andy's shoe heels striking the gallery floor echoed through the cavernous space with each step.
"I've given Mr. Holmes my resignation. And, the dear man, he so kindly agreed to allow me to invite all of you here to celebrate, even though I'll be seeing you much more frequently now back home!" She beamed at Sherlock, who had not so much as batted an eyelash, and then out at her family, who burst into applause.
Sherlock placed the tray carefully in front of the rumpled, brown-haired, brown-eyed mop of a young man sat next to John at the small, round table—the séance table, they were apparently calling it—in the center of the room. Andy Galbraith's face was soft but set in the flickering light.
Janine pouted and the audience
"Henry?"
Sherlock gave him a disdainful look. "The conductor does not wade into the pit."
"That's where you want me? With Sholto?"
"Yeah?" Lestrade hesitantly accepted Mycroft's offered handshake. "Wait. For the…job or the…humping?"
was a horned melon on a stick."
John leaned to the side so he could push his shoulder against Sherlock's. "Right. Observer effect, is it?"
"I didn't do it for you," Sherlock said primly, folding his hands on top of the sheet. His eyes shifted to the side, looking at John. "But you make me understand."
Lyons shifted under the sheets, ran a hand over Henry's stomach. "Do what?" he asked sleepily.
A dance floor, dining tables, fire pit, and a thatch-roofed outdoor bar all showed signs of heavy use, but aside from a few lingering drinkers and dark-corner nuzzlers, no one was around.
Henry started, with a little yelp, and then looked at Lyons and burst into laughter. Lyons' eyes crinkled back at him as he grinned at Henry from ear to ear.
"You are not responsible for the murder of Andrew West."
Oh. Maybe that was why John was smiling.
John looked at Sherlock and tried another smile, a cautious one. "Date, yeah. People…do that. Date."
him."
"I'd be happy with a smile," said Fletcher.

"A wise decision not to risk soiling your lovely suit. Though it does seem to be a bit creased."
"Is that on the list?" John grinned devilishly. "Because,
She was appalled, considering the money she had laid out for this request, that this purportedly
"But," Sherlock tilted his head and narrowed his eyes, looking at John as though he'd said something incredibly puzzling, "why?"
Mycroft's eyebrows drew down, but he followed Lestrade to a more private section of the garden, out of hearing distance from Molly, Archie, and the staff who were beginning to load their luggage onto the plane.
John took a breath and held up the mug he was carrying. "Tea."
"Of course," Sherlock shrugged.
A bright, puffy little yellow and white twin-engine plane appeared around a break of trees at the edge of the lagoon, splashing and puttering its way across the clear water.
John stepped out from the doorway. His face was doing that confusing thing again with the antithetical emotions: he looked angry and he looked…nervous. "Something bothering you, Sherlock?"
"What?
," Mrs. Hudson whispered.
"You might want to choose your next command with some care," Lyons said, and his gaze ran slowly down Henry's body.
, so soft and sweet it was almost swallowed up by the sound of the sea, but to John's heart it was as loud as a breaker crashing against a cliff.
"Have you seen my—"
Holmes turned to his companion instead of answering her. "Miss Radka Wenceslas, John. Owner of the Hickman Gallery in London. The
"I've been pretty bloody obvious about how I feel, I think."
Mycroft growled and ground down against him. He was rock-hard in his trousers and he was sweating and he swore violently when one of those big hands finally slid inside his boxers.
Even with the rain still pounding outside, it seemed too quiet inside John's bungalow. Too still.
"Oh, John, of
Radka's father took her away from Prague, away from soldiers, and away from Mikolas the next week.
Radka opened the door of Raz's studio and walked into another world. Her breath rushed out in awe.
"I've prepared a special blend for you in Soo Lin's teapot." Sherlock poured a cup of tea from a russet brown clay pot. His movements were slow and graceful, exaggeratedly so, like his hands were floating.  "And I sensed you might enjoy the Earl Grey this evening, John." He lifted a second white stoneware pot.
Sherlock didn't move.
John hadn't said it before, hadn't really even allowed himself to think
either. Couldn't function. Couldn't bear the eyes of the people who knew him before. Couldn't understand his place in the world he had been expelled to. Before he'd met Sherlock.
Molly flushed from the roots of her hair to her toes as Archie's father turned an appraising look on her.
"Er," John said, pushing himself up on one elbow. "Does he really need to know about this?"
Sherlock took one of John's hands in his. "We
"Okay, then." The man nodded, slowly, and licked his lips. "I can do that."
"Henry, it's okay. Just breathe."
Sherlock turned his head away. "Sentimental babble."
Janine. Really, John, jealousy doesn't suit you."
"Why do I not find that statement reassuring?"
"What?"
"It's 'John,' please." He liked Mrs. Hudson already. She reminded him a bit of Mrs. Turner. An alarming thought occurred as he pictured Mrs. Turner at Paul and Ravi's wedding reception. "Most of the arrangements? Including, the, erm…"

Radka gaped, then turned sharply to Holmes. "You

the way you think."
"Is, er, your father one of Mrs. Hudson's family, then?"
"Good."
"Sebastian has very nice hands," Kate said. "They look…soft."
"You know what I've learned about working with dogs?" Henry mused. "Sometimes you have to find the right reward. Sometimes it's food. Sometimes it's a toy." He squeezed Lyons' hand. "Sometimes it's just affection."
He would be out of his mind to accept. Sherlock Holmes was an overly-dramatic, vain, obnoxious, petulant, plush-mouthed madman. Beyond that, John didn't know a thing about him, what he really did here on this island of his—was it even his island?—or what he might ask of John under the terms of this employment. There had been no mention of compensation. He didn't know how he would live. And it hadn't escaped his notice that Sherlock hadn't actually
Having said his goodbyes already, John stood back on the lawn and watched Sherlock embrace first Molly and then Mrs. Hudson, bringing them both to tears with whatever words of farewell he had chosen. And they looked like
The Vermeer had best be brilliant or she would have Holmes's head on a platter and call it her new exhibit. Bring people in to the gallery, sell it for the money, it hardly mattered any more. Art was business, not some foolish childhood…she frowned…

"John!"
Lestrade frowned as he stood. "Of course I do." Then his eyes widened in alarm. "You wouldn't—"
"Watson," Sholto nodded. "
"I think you'll find the question is referring to ill health," Sebastian interjected, "rather than assault by ruffians."
Mycroft pushed himself up, away from the man, off the sofa, and tugged his trousers up. "Yes." He cleared his throat. "It was. Lovely. Thank you."
"You're a party planner and you don't know how much people like to drink at weddings?"
"I'm going to make a star by that one."
"Oh. What does he do?"
Sherlock turned a suspicious frown on him. The morning light struck green glints in his eyes.
Sherlock frowned. "Where's Mrs. Hudson?" He hadn't changed completely out of his suit. The jacket was tossed haphazardly over the back of a chair, and Sherlock's white shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, the collar open at his throat. The light from his desk lamp highlighted the long line of his neck in gold.
Sherlock smirked, looked at Andy, and said, "

John nodded. "Like Molly. Like Mrs. Hudson."
