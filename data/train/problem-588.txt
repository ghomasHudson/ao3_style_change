"It's so tedious when you state the obvious," Sherlock huffs, then berates himself for being rude so soon after being forgiven by John.
, tall, devilish man—I'm so jealous, you bastard. He is way out of your league. You know that, right?"
Finally, Sherlock looks up at him, his eyes burning like coals in his face, and even though John isn't sure what they're talking about anymore, he's sure that Sherlock's fever-bright eyes and cheeks make him want to do all kinds of kinky things with Sherlock, anything he wants as a matter of fact because he would do
but when he opens his mouth all that comes out is a croak, and he gives up trying to speak in favor of encouraging his mouth to produce enough saliva to wet his parched throat.
, and Sherlock ends up falling asleep on the couch, still naked. John shakes him awake around six, and says, "You need to get dressed. Mycroft just texted me. He and Greg are on their way here." John starts to move away, but Sherlock catches his fingers, and asks, "Why's he coming?" and John huffs, and says, "The
It's obvious to Sherlock that they will have to find a way to move past this without actually talking about it. Talking about it would mean John admitting he feels threatened by Sherlock's kink and Sherlock would have to admit that it makes him angry John is still so hung up on being with a
Sherlock's body was tense with anxiety, nearly shaking in John's arms. "You don't know that! You can't see the future!" There was a pause, a loosening of Sherlock's muscles, then he tilted his head to the side in curiosity. "
After that, there's only the sound of their ragged breathing, and the squelching, sucking sound of Sherlock pushing down the plunger while pulling the barrel slowly out, and John can't help the long, low grunting moan that comes from deep in his throat. Sherlock says, "Oh, hell," and pulls it all the way out, before tossing it on the floor. John almost says,
He takes a deep breath and then takes out his wallet, his phone, his keys and the red rubber ball and puts them on the settee next to Sherlock's wardrobe. He avoids looking in the mirror. He takes off his jeans and folds them neatly and puts them on top of his things. He unbuttons his shirt and then his cuffs and shrugs out of his shirt. He tries to fold it neatly but he's always hated trying to fold long sleeve shirts. He usually hangs them up. In the end he folds it in half and lays it over the arm of the settee.
"Twenty years," John whispers in awe. "They loved each other for twenty years and never said a thing."
and John has a new fear—that he'll chicken out before Sherlock gets back, just like he chickened out before Sherlock died and he thought he'd lost his chance. He said then he would never let fear stop him from grabbing something he wanted.
"I used to be a conventional therapist, but I had a few clients who couldn't work out their issues. They were spending thousands of dollars on therapy but still using drugs or alcohol or sex to cope. Their marriages were still falling apart; they were still alienating their families.
"What if I don't want milk in my tea?" Sherlock asked. If he'd been in his dragonskin, his ruff would be rattling and his tail would be snapping.
blood and lust sliding into John's mouth. It feels like barking an order at Sherlock to bring him back to the Sherlock shaped space in John's bones where he

—" even as it comes out of him coated in derision, it stings, "—everyone, and expose all your secrets, and then everyone will hate him."
He winked at John as though John should find Mycroft's formality charming. John managed a wan smile in response.
"For example, if you trip over someone's foot and hurt yourself, that doesn't automatically mean they
"You're a perfect sub," Gerald says, wrapping himself around John like the bloody great cuddler he is.
, John thinks and almost giggles. The other thing is leather, too, but long and thin. It must be a cane.
"Yes, but nonetheless," John says. Then he nods, slaps the door jamb once in a very masculine way, and disappears down the hall.
"No!" John says, offended, ironically, that she thinks he would cheat on Gerald in some kind of bid to reclaim his heterosexuality.
John looked over to where Chatsworth stood. And then he looked up...and up...and up. Chatsworth was as big as a house! His legs were taller than the ground floor of Mycroft's mansion. John knew he wouldn't be able to put his arms completely around Chatsworth's legs. His hide was a gingery brown, much like his hair. He wasn't built quite like Sherlock, whose tail was twice as long as his body. Where Sherlock was sleek, Chatsworth was built for power.
John lays his hand gently on Sherlock's arm and then the tips of his fingers slide rhythmically up and down the tender skin on the inside of Sherlock's forearm. Sherlock's dick starts to react and Sherlock bites back a groan of frustration. He turns himself slightly so John can't see.
of love, whether from friends, family, or best friends. You said you've known he was attracted to you for three years, implying that he's been pining for you, but you also used the same language as a wronged partner—you said he was dating
" and opens his mouth over the left wing of John's collarbone and starts to bite down before pausing and sliding his teeth over to the other side.
Sherlock didn't remain cool to John for long, and John showered him with attention in relief. They sat together on the couch while Chatsworth explained how they were getting out of the flat.
" John's voice rises out of him on flames, and his throat burns, and his heart burns, and his eyes burn, and moisture drips onto John's cheeks.
But he also reads about high heels being a signifier of power in women and that the same could be true for men.
"Yeah," John says, thinking about Sherlock's arse, pale and plush and begging to be bitten. He licks his bottom lip, and then bites it. Shakes his head, trying to shake off the image. "I mean, no, I can't stop you."
"And why's he got a broken cheekbone?" Lestrade asks, jerking his chin in the direction of the suspect.
"But if it weren't for me, you would still be with him!" Sherlock says, throwing his arms out in frustration. He moves closer to the bed, and John thinks
Just like that, John is looking at his phone like it has personally insulted him. Then he gears himself up for discussing with Sherlock whatever is wrong with his arse.
He has Mrs. Hudson to fuss over him and bring him biscuits and make tea; John doesn't hear the familiar strain of
Gerald makes a little self-deprecating face and crosses his eyes and John laughs, like really, honestly laughs. Gerald grins, pleased with himself. He darts forward and kisses John, but before John can bring his hands up or deepen the kiss, Gerald pulls away. His cheeks are rosy and it looks beautiful on his pale skin.
heart was—and is—you, and Moriarty had gone to great lengths to ensure that you would always be in danger unless I remained dead. No matter how many enemy agents Mycroft found, and destroyed, there was always another one to take his place.
Sherlock had the ability to pluck thoughts out of John's head that he didn't even know he was thinking. It was mortifying. If Sherlock said he was thinking the word
, running on a ticker tape through his mind, and John reaches up, pushes a sweaty curl out of Sherlock's eyes, and says, "You're gloating, aren't you?" and Sherlock grins, and tucks his face into John's neck. "A little," he says, voice muffled by John's sweaty skin.
not to waste another chance to tell you because I'd been too much of a coward to tell you before I went away. I was afraid of losing your friendship if I confessed how I felt because you took every opportunity to announce that you weren't gay, and that we weren't a couple. You were so terrified someone might think you liked
"No, it's in Sherlock's duffel bag and I didn't want to wake him up because the bag's in my bedroom."
Sherlock keeps downloading the information because there’s no point to stopping. His instructions are clear - any threat to the mission must be neutralized and there’s no grey areas for intelligence gathering. Sherlock fucked up and now Blaine must die.
arse. Aren't you?" She sounds scandalized, as if she hadn't just admitted to admiring Sherlock's arse, too.
"Well, within the next two months," John says, his lips tipping up on one side. Sherlock can see him holding in his amusement.
the man you are and I want to help you bring that man back. Will you, please-- Sherlock, no more secrets. Right?"
John chuckled. He'd forgotten Sherlock's naivete when it came to human social interactions. After all, the first time he'd communicated with another person was Tuesday and that was only two days ago.
"I'm sorry," John says, and tries not to look into Sherlock's eyes or at the pile of goods on the bed, but then Sherlock pulls back, and says incredulously, "I mean,
John gets that feeling in his gut that he often gets when he's around a Holmes brother. It's a feeling that says
Sherlock flips the file closed and slides it onto the table. He stares at his shaking hands. It will be weeks before they stop shaking.
That's the plan, then. When John gets home from the party, Sherlock will be lying in bed, naked, initiate sex and then apologize for his behavior. He will
The first time he has Gerald in the flat, John realizes that he absolutely cannot have sex with Gerald (or anyone) in Sherlock's bed. Instead, they stay in John's old room among the boxes of Sherlock's scientific equipment, the prints and decorations from Sherlock's room, and the (many) boxes of his clothes. When John explains why they're not sleeping in the first-floor bedroom, Gerald laughs.
Gerald's hair is spread out on the pillow behind him, a black splash against the ivory pillow cases. A study in monochrome. He likes Gerald's long hair because he's always liked burying his hands into a luxurious head of hair. He used to fantasize about pushing his fingers into Sherlock's hair, tangling it up, fisting it and pulling his head back to expose that ridiculously long, white neck. John swallows hard and closes his eyes, his desire morphing into a tight pain in his chest. John feels Gerald's hand cup his shoulder before sliding down and taking his hand, their fingers tangling together. John doesn't open his eyes.
"I don't know why bloody Mycroft sent all the reading and teaching materials when he knows full well that Sherlock's supposed to be eating and sleeping."
"You've always just taken what you wanted. Why am I any different?" John says with a pained, disbelieving laugh. He throws his arms wide in challenge, and then brings his hands in to tap roughly at his chest. "You want me? Well, here I am! Take me!"
Sherlock righted himself with a sullen shake of his body which rippled all the way through his tail.
He pretends Sherlock is lying in bed next to him. He's on his side facing John with his head propped in his hand and he's smiling. His eyes are warm and a little bit mischievous and very, very sexy. Sherlock is wearing a dress shirt and trousers. The top two buttons of his shirt are undone, just like Sherlock always wears them. It's a little weird that Sherlock's fully dressed and John is naked but this is a fantasy so John just goes with it.
Several drinks and three hours later, the pub is beginning to fill with patrons, but it might as well be empty for all the attention that Gerald and John are paying it. The two of them are leaning towards each other and their mutual attraction is apparent to them and anyone who looks at them.
Sherlock isn't particularly thrilled about being in therapy, but he recognizes the need for someone like Dr. Reed to aid in his recovery. He hated every second of the way therapy made him feel today—like he was split open, every insecurity and fear on exhibit.
Sherlock turns undressing Blaine into the sartorial equivalent of foreplay - he strokes a fingertip over every button before slipping it through the placket. Every few buttons, he skims his lips over Blaine’s but pulls away before tongues can get involved. The fate of hundreds of women (and John) lies in Sherlock’s ability to seduce Blaine so well that he keeps Sherlock around long enough for Sherlock to gather the intel he needs. Blaine can pay for sex if he has no other options. Sherlock needs Blaine to need him. Blaine should be so besotted that he lowers his guard.
The two of them are kissing and rutting against each other for a good ten minutes before Blaine pulls away. They’re both panting.
Gerald lifts his head, brings his arm up and rests his chin on the back of his hand so he can look at John's face.
An armchair in the corner sits in front of a floor lamp that hangs over the chair; it’s the perfect spot for reading. A beautiful oak armoire faces the sofa. One door is hanging open, showing a flat screen TV. The other door is closed. A desk to John's right is covered by today's edition of
"My cock works perfectly fine, thank you very much! I already got a bollocking from Sean about letting you make your own decisions and he's right, yeah? But the same is true for me. You can't make decisions that affect me without discussing it with me first."
"Mr. Watson," the behemoth said, putting his hands on John's shoulders to steady him. The man's voice was so deep it was like a growl.
to be open and honest with John, but the truth about the rape isn't something he can share with John until he knows, for sure, that John won't use it as an excuse to avoid a romantic relationship with Sherlock. He knows John better than John knows himself, he thinks, and John wants him. John
John had been wishing he could spend more time at home with Sherlock and if Mrs. Hudson was right about John being due a paycheck and pension from Mycroft, then he could cut back on his hours at work. He'd still have a couple of days a week in the A&E to keep himself in practice without worrying about money. (Or what trouble Sherlock was getting to while he wasn't home.)
to believe that there's still a chance for us to love each other the way we want to, the way we were
"Look, it's about compromise. You know this—it's basic relationship stuff. You and I—our relationship wouldn't have worked without talking to each other and trying to meet halfway."
"You can't help me with everything," Sherlock says. His heart is racing. He rubs his hand over his mouth and wipes sweat off his upper lip. Now that he’s noticed it, he feels the dampness of perspiration everywhere.
He likes Gerald's large, muscled hands, his hard chest and straight hips. He likes being physically vulnerable. He's been in that place emotionally with a woman before, but he has never once felt the raw, almost painful thrill of danger he feels at this moment, bent in half and held down by Gerald's body.
John is sitting in his chair, and his chest is bare. At first, Sherlock thinks he's naked and an image of him and the boyfriend together pierces his chest, but then John stands, his mouth opening in shock, his tea mug clattering to the carpet, spilling but not breaking.
"I don't know about that," Rebecca says defensively, as though he'd questioned her ability instead of his own. "Lifestyles can be adjusted to fit in a child."
Sherlock laughs deep enough that he groans in pain because of his ribs. All the shouting isn't helping any, either.
Sherlock's tongue slips just inside the heat of John's mouth, sliding along the inside of his teeth, down the smooth, wet skin of his cheek before their tongues catch on each other. John's fists his left hand in Sherlock's white button down, and his other hand plows through Sherlock's still-too-short hair. Sherlock drags his hands down John's sides, and around to the small of his back, and lets the fingers of his right hand flirt with the edge of John's scrub bottoms.
"He, uh, he had a nightmare and I was helping him change his clothes. He kissed me and I didn't want to push him away, in case I hurt him—physically I mean, although—although emotionally, too, I guess. But it got—he got his hand into my pajama bottoms, and I, I—I got hard, I couldn't help it, and he got me off with his hand."
. Sherlock had looked askance at him, and experienced one of the first moments of desire that left him breathless.
He had to admit—it did seem like the writings of someone caught in feverish delusions. He needed to leave a note to himself, a separate note, taped on the fridge or his laptop or the bathroom mirror to tell himself he wasn't crazy and to believe what he'd written.
The problem was not knowing how to trigger a recall of knowledge. This wasn't like memorizing his times table. How did he recall things that he already knew, however hidden from his conscious mind, and use that to fill in the blanks?
"They're having a party to celebrate the baby, and they've invited us." John hesitates, not wanting to trip Sherlock's defensiveness by suggesting he has to be bribed to attend a social function with John, but also not wanting to be outright rejected for asking Sherlock to go. "Saturday night. Do you want to go?"
John finally looks up at him, and Sherlock freezes. He takes in the red-rimmed eyes, the downturned mouth, the forward slope of the shoulders, the mussed hair, the pale cheeks, the furrowed brow.
Sherlock, of course, didn't listen, and immediately tried to swallow a mouthful. He promptly spit it out. "That's hot!"
"Sherlock," John says quietly and Sherlock pushes himself carefully to his knees to see John kneeling next to the bed. John moves to take his hands and Sherlock grips them so hard, he can see John wince.
Last night, he hadn't really paid attention to anything Sherlock was saying. His body, and therefore his mind, were entirely focused on what Sherlock was
John huffs in irritation, picks up his phone, and dials Angelo's restaurant. Thirty minutes later, John and Sherlock have enough food to feed three times as many people.
“I work for MI6. I’m gathering information. They want to take down your trafficking ring,” Sherlock says matter-of-factly, moving closer to Blaine by increments, not wanting to startle him into action.
fire," Chatsworth said, "and it's not nearly as helpful as it sounds. I can only do it once before I run out of energy and have to shift back. It's basically an antiquated last-stand defense mechanism."
With that, the fury John has been harboring toward Sherlock for a week explodes inside him, polluting his already ravaged psyche. He knows when he walks in the door, when Sherlock
Sitting in his hideaway contemplating all of this is driving Sherlock up the wall. And he's bored. He wants to go home—home to John, home to what's familiar and comforting. He'll just have to apologize to John for…what exactly is he apologizing for, though? The thought makes him angry all over again, but he takes the anger and smashes it into a ball, smaller and smaller, then locks it into a box and throws it into the basement of his mind palace where all the other shit he doesn't want to deal with lies.
Everyone in the room stills and turns their ears to the front hallway, curious. Then Rebecca shrieks, "Oh my God, you made it! Yay!" John can picture her clapping and bouncing up and down on her toes.
"Sherlock, don't start," John says, his voice lower and rougher than he would've liked it to be. "You need to focus on getting through the press conference."
As he told Sherlock the day before, John's responsibility extends beyond just treating his injuries—John has taken on the responsibility for Sherlock's health. There are many things John has thought of that he needs to restore Sherlock to health, including helping him gain weight. John starts writing things down.
“If I wanted a drink, I would have stayed at the bar,” Sherlock says, making his voice low and seductive.
With a kiss on the cheek, Gerald is gone, climbing into the cab and shutting the door. John closes the front door and locks it. Then he works his way slowly, reluctantly, up the stairs to the flat. He pauses on the landing outside the sitting room but then, because he just can't, he
"Oh, Gerald. What I felt for him was so long ago. I've known you for a year and I love you and you have nothing to worry about."
Stricken, John feels in his bones the truth of what Gerald is saying. He feels like folding in half, it hurts so bad to be reminded that while John has this wonderful group of friends, Sherlock has nobody but John.
. Sherlock doesn't try to kiss John, though he wants to—he simply holds tight until his body stops shaking and his mind crawls its way out of the brume of anxiety. Vision and sound seem to assault him all at once, and he clings even tighter to John. Without realizing it, Sherlock's face is pressed against John's neck and he's whisper-moaning nine words repeatedly
Sherlock throws his spoon down in disgust and John knows Sherlock wishes he could make a grand exit to show his disdain, but instead he pushes to his feet with a wince and grunt of pain and then slowly shuffles towards the sitting room.
Everyone looks at Sherlock, who blushes furiously and gives a solemn nod. John tries, and fails not to laugh at his embarrassment. Sherlock glares at him and John kisses him, quite provocatively, on the mouth and is encouraged with a piercing wolf-whistle by Bernie, until Cyril clinks a fork against his glass and reminds them that they are not the center of attention.
your dragon. When I want to shift, I imagine myself shrugging off my human skin and putting on my dragon skin, as though it's a suit I'm taking out of the wardrobe.
The look of betrayal on Sherlock's face made John immediately regretful. He opened his mouth to apologize, but Chatsworth interrupted him.
Before John could open his mouth, Mrs. Hudson came bustling into the flat in a cloud of industrious concern.
He replaces his right hand on Sherlock's forearm with his left and then reaches his right hand up and puts it on the back of Sherlock's neck, his fingertips tracing little lines on his back.
"I know," John said, feeling near tears for the second time in less than twenty-four hours. "I feel the same."
"Gentlemen, please," Mycroft says. "The important thing is that you impart to Gerald that the knowledge of Sherlock's return needs to be handled with absolute secrecy."
That's not true, he knows it's not, and he needs to find a way to stop this train wreck. He wrenches his mouth away from Sherlock's.
"Here," John says, but his voice breaks. He clears his throat. Picks up Sherlock's dressing gown. Shakes it out. "Here, put this on before I get your bottoms off, too."
John loves kissing Gerald. His lips are soft and he's responsive to the tiniest nips and pecks. It's a microcosm of his responsiveness to touch altogether. John asked him a week after they met if he'd always been that responsive and Gerald's eyes had got a bit shifty, prompting John to conclude the answer was no, but Gerald was unwilling to admit it, probably because he was afraid to drive John away with an admission like that so early in their relationship.
John's nostrils flare. "Yeah, all right. Sheets and pillows are in the linen closet there. Good night."
"No sex," Sherlock says, gently smacking John's head, which is still level with Sherlock's belly button.
"I want to come on your body, and smear it into your skin, and then make you walk around with it underneath your clothes. It would be even better if we went to a crime scene, and I'd know that you were marked as mine, that anyone who got close enough would smell me on you. Lestrade, and Donovan, and fucking Anderson, who wants to fuck you by the way—" and John says, "There's no fucking way," while rocking back against Sherlock, who says, "No, he does, he really—" then Sherlock grunts before finishing his sentence, "I think, but—I think it's because he hates me, and fucking you would be payback."
John suddenly appears between the kitchen and sitting room. Sherlock rushes him and pushes him down to the ground and hisses at him to be quiet. Doesn't John know how precious he is? How eagerly Sherlock's enemies would be to hurt John in retaliation, maybe even kill him? The very thought leaves him gasping for breath. His vision winnows down to John, black edging his face, like a vignette. John grips the nape of Sherlock's neck and pushes his head down between his legs. His other hand clasps Sherlock's wrist, two fingers taking his pulse.
Sherlock gave Chatsworth a triumphant and haughty glance and then turned and began digging stuff out of the boxes he'd brought up.
, he keeps going up the stairs to his old room. He digs a fitted sheet and blanket out of the closet, smelling dusty, but clean and makes up the bed. He turns off the overhead light and then slips into bed in the dark, knowing he's not going to be able to sleep, not after all that's happened.
When I'm done with the missing chapters, I intend to slot them into the full story where they belong. Only then will I truly have finished "It's All Fine." I hope those of you who were there two years ago will be here for the end.
"Everyone, this is Sherlock!" Rebecca says and shivers in excitement. This is why John loves her—she finds joy in nearly everything. A balm for his weathered soul. But then she points herself directly at John with a narrow-eyed gaze so fierce, he flinches back slightly. She stalks over to him, jabs her finger at him and says, "You said he wasn't coming! You sly dog!" and smiles.
"Hm," Sherlock says noncommittally, his expression pained. He shifts his eyes to the side and shrugs.
John opens his mouth to say something rude, but then his eyes flick down Sherlock's body, and Sherlock sees the moment he remembers what's happened and decides to bite back his retort. Sherlock goes from contrite to furious in the quarter of a second it takes him to read the pity in John's eyes.
," she says loud enough to draw the attention of the bartender, who raises his eyebrows at them, and John can tell he's about to move over here to ask if they need drinks refills, and John waves him away while ignoring Rebecca who scoffs, "You're not listening to me, are you?"
," Mrs. Hudson, barely stifled, continues. "So secretive and always plotting. Shame on you for leaving us behind to think you were dead! I intend to have a word with your mother—please tell me you've told
Mrs. Gonzales's face contorts in pain and John's focus snaps back like a rubber band pulled tight, shocking him out of his head. He pulls his stethoscope off his neck to listen to her heart and thinks
John huffs out a bitter laugh, recognizing the first of many times in the rest of his life when he'll have to make excuses for Sherlock. "Trust me, he won't go. He hates having to
"I apologize for my tardiness," is the first thing Sherlock says as he edges his way towards John like a skittish lamb seeking shelter behind its mother.
"No, we never got that far. They were both serious relationships. One I was with for about five years. The other I was with for six. I've been single for well over a year. So this is the first sex I've had in almost two years," Gerald says and then pauses and looks at John with narrowed eyes for a minute. "Do you understand what I'm saying about how we define sex?"
John reaches up, grinning with pride, semen sliding down his cheek to meet up with the bit on his chin, and puts his hand on the back of Sherlock's neck. He pulls, guiding Sherlock down into the kiss, but when Sherlock feels the pressure on the back of his head, he stiffens abruptly, every muscle seizing, fear rocketing along his nerves and obliterating the warm pleasure that came before it.
They're howling with laughter while John tries to get Gerald to his feet. They attract the disapproving glare of a man with two teenage girls. Feeling guilty (but not really) for laughing in a graveyard (which is like laughing at crime scenes), John helps Gerald to his feet.
"I'm just curious! If you don't want to tell me—" John says, putting his hands up like it's no skin off his nose whether Sherlock tells him or not, even though it's suddenly the most important thing in the universe and his skin is prickling with apprehension, but anticipation as well. If Sherlock is as good at being kinky as he is about almost everything else, he could probably talk John around to all kinds of debauchery.
Sherlock's mouth opens, and a litany of smut falls out like he doesn't even realize he's doing it (and John thinks it's highly likely that he
Normally, on the days John has to go to work, his alarm wakes both of them. They might snog for a bit, or maybe they'd have a quick blow job or hand job. Sherlock almost never sleeps through John's alarm. But Wednesday morning he does—or pretends to. John hesitates, wanting to wake him, but remembers how ugly it got the night before and decides it's better if they give each other some breathing room.
John walks through the kitchen and then through a doorway into a roomy and comfortable sitting room. John knows right away this room is the heart of Gerald's home. For one, it's cluttered. Bookshelves line every available wall. A window directly across from the door looks out onto a small back garden.
"But I've never seen a born-human as sensitive to magic as you apparently are. You know," he said, looking thoughtful (although seeing a thirty ton dragon with teeth as long as John's arm with such a human looking facial expression was not something John could have imagined.) "That might be why you were able not just to telepathically bond with Sherlock while he was still in the egg, but forge a mating bond."
Speaking of last night, what did it mean? John has a tendency to treat uncomfortable situations in which he is involved as though they didn't happen. When it involves other people, though, he can gossip like a little old lady.
Chatsworth and John both broke out into laughter, embarrassing poor Sherlock who huddled against John's chest, face hidden.
"Oh, nobody's worried!" Mrs. Hudson said, putting a hand on John's shoulder. "I'll just pop up here when John's at work and keep our Sherlock company, won't I you darling little thing."
"I'm sorry," is the first thing John says when he sits down in his chair across from Sherlock. His voice is soft and
If he can't lay it all out for Sherlock, then they might as well go back to the way it was before—before Sherlock pretended to die, when John was too much of a coward to tell him how he felt.
Sherlock turns around, startled into wide-eyed surprise by John's sudden presence. John yanks Sherlock's fist towards him and pulls back the dishtowel. Sherlock has cut the tip of his thumb, through his fingernail and into the meat. John can see white bone shining in the cut for the half second before the wound wells with blood.
remove your hand from the egg? My instructions made it clear that it was not to be touched. I should like to take it away without you causing any more damage."
Both Gregory and Mycroft gave Sherlock matching looks of incomprehension. Finally Mycroft snapped, "Of course not! Do you honestly think I would partner with someone who murdered people?"
"What? There's no way I'm passing you a four week old baby!" John says, rising to hand Milton off to one of his mothers, but Sherlock says, "Just trust me," and John does trust him. He hands the squalling bundle over and can't help but sigh in pleasure at the gentle way Sherlock cradles the baby before laying him on his chest. He holds him there with one hand and begins to hum, the noise low and vibrating in his chest. Milton almost immediately falls quiet.
Chatsworth followed him downstairs and into the bathroom, listening while John described what happened. In the bathroom, he knelt by Sherlock's head and coaxed him into opening his mouth. He ran a finger along both the top and bottom of Sherlock's gums.
Chatsworth's eyebrows rose in confusion. "Mr. Holmes sent me," Chatsworth said, gesturing at the shiny grey van idling at the curb behind him. "I've got supplies for the dragonet. I'm also to help you in any way you need for the next few weeks, until the dragonet can change into his human form."
." The sound of Sherlock cursing so coarsely is sexy, and he lets go of one of John's cheeks to press a finger against his rim, and then he pushes it in, and John almost strokes himself, so desperately hard. If he didn't want Sherlock to fuck him so bad, he could get himself off just like this, with only one finger inside him. Sherlock's fingertip slips in and out, pressing on John's rim as it does, and John says, surprised by the way his voice cracks and breaks, "I can take two."
John's face whips up, and he tilts his head slightly to the left, the beginning of a smile-that's-not-a-smile on his lips. "Yeah, I have. That happens when you go through a breakup."
battered and used. Now sit your arse down. I'll go make the tea. Oh, and Holmes?" John turned in the doorway between the kitchen and sitting room and said, very quietly, "Don't you dare touch that fucking egg or I'll dislocate every one of your fingers."
of telling me, you sent me off to run your errand for you and your little resurrected boyfriend! Were you hedging your bets? Keeping the old boyfriend on the line in case the new one didn't work out?"
"Why are you asking me?" Sherlock says with a glare. "This is the first actual relationship I've ever been in. Sex is completely separate."
Sherlock hums deep in his chest. For a moment, they're content to kiss and rock their pelvises together, but after a while, it stops being enough and starts feeling uncomfortable.
: lol. He likes them. Has a bit of a sweet tooth. Oh, and can I borrow your Magic Bullet to make the smoothies for him?
"Mycroft," John said dangerously, looking up at the offender with tight lips. "Why is Mrs. Hudson not surprised there's a dragon in the flat?"
Sherlock and John share a smile, remembering that night, handcuffed together and on the run from the police. When Sherlock had taken John's hand, after John had said
"Rebecca suggested I bribe you to go by offering to fulfill your sexual kink. If you had one, that is."
Sherlock lets loose a warm chuckle and his cheeks flush pink. He strokes his big hand lightly over Milton's back.
Sherlock stood up on his hind legs, his back to John. He'd already figured out how to open the cupboards and was digging through them one by one. "John, I'm very hungry. I promised you I would eat—why are you being so slow in giving my food to me? Do you expect me to find it myself? That's not very caring of you." He moved onto the next cupboard, sweeping a newspaper and the box of teabags onto the floor, narrowly missing a mug that John snatched away in time.
"Why are you asking me?" Sherlock says with a glare. "This is the first actual relationship I've ever been in. Sex is completely separate."
"You want to give flying a try, Sherlock?" Chatsworth asked over his shoulder as he opened the gate with a remote and drove through.
"I would've waited for you," John whispers and shakes his head. His lower lip trembles and Sherlock stands up as fast as he can, which is not very fast, and goes to John and wraps his arms around him.
a life outside of him, you know? And then he came back, and Gerald and I broke up, and I had to lie to you lot, and
to meet him. He grimaces instead and curses under his breath. His heart is racing and his palms are sweaty. He develops a mantra—
Sherlock goes into the kitchen to help John lay out the food. They work together in silence, their bodies comfortable in close quarter even if their hearts are divided. When they sit down at the table, they eat in silence for several long moments. Sherlock surreptitiously watches John, whose eyes never rise above the level of his plate. Sherlock endures the weighted atmosphere until he feels sick with uncertainty, and can't stand the silence any longer.
"For holding me while I vomited and cried and cleaning up my shit and sitting with me after nightmares and still letting me seduce you."
and then wait thirty minutes before taking another. Orally disintegrating does not mean it works immediately, just that it gets into your
He collapses next to John, who says, "I need to shower," and Sherlock nods, but pulls him into a bruising kiss first. When they pull away, John says, "You're incredible. Absolutely brilliant," and Sherlock says, "I know," with a twitch of his eyebrows. John ruffles his hair, which he hates, and says, "Humble as always," and Sherlock says, "Fuck off," but his voice is infused with affection. He doesn't know how other people can look at John and not want to touch him, but seeing as how he doesn't
John rolls his eyes, and pulls on his headlamp, positioning the magnifying glass over his eye. John holds Sherlock's hand down with his right and, with his left, he squirts and wipes, squirts and wipes until he can see the white of the bone, whole.
Zivko is the young guard who stands outside Sherlock's cell. Sherlock's not entirely sure why they need someone to guard it. It's not like Sherlock can pick the lock when there are dead bolts on the outside of the door. Even if he managed to get out of his cell, he's not strong enough to fight off both Zivko and the other guards stationed between him and freedom. It's most likely that Zivko's job is a sinecure and he's the son or nephew of someone prominent.
He clears his throat, pushing down the want that's unfurled inside him so fast that it's like being blindfolded, spun around, and then told to find his way home without being able to see where he's going. Just like it does every time he thinks of Sherlock on his knees, or behind him, above him,
Gerald's face clears, the sun comes out, and then he doubles over in laughter. John chuckles a little bit, because he can't help himself—when Gerald laughs, he makes John want to laugh, too. He repeats his question.

Sherlock's jaw works back and forth. His nostrils flare. John tries to maintain a straight face. Sherlock rips his hand out of John's trousers and stalks off in the direction of the road. John unhurriedly fishes his phone out of his pocket, calls Lestrade to come pick up the suspect, and then collapses against the wall in helpless giggles while trying to get his erection under control before Lestrade arrives.
happen?" Gerald asks. He moves back to lean against the wall between the dining room and kitchen, and crosses his arms, like he's settling in for a lengthy conversation. His face is twisted in anger and disgust, belying the casual slant of his body, though tears glimmer on the edge of falling.
Gerald turns his face to the side and takes another swallow of his beer. His hair swings like a single smooth sheet to cover the side of his face. "You felt you had less to lose with me so it was easier to open up."
Here I am, a year after I posted the first missing chapter in this work and almost two years after I posted the very first part of "It's All Fine." IAF is the work I am most proud of. It felt like a collaborative effort with not just Jenn and Katie, but the readers as well. I look back on it with a nostalgic yearning to repeat the experience. Unfortunately, I have no big stories in me. Only little seeds of ideas.
Last, but of course not least, thank you to every one of you who read and commented, who followed me from the original series format to this version. Every comment is treasured like nobody's business, but they're especially meaningful when they come from readers who follow along with an unfinished work. It takes balls, kiddos, and I thank you for your. Um. Balls?
"Monstrous, he is. Yeah. Cooking supper for your wife every night is really just an unthinkable offense."
John fishes the packet of dihydrocodeineone out of his kit and Gerald follows him to the kitchen. John hands him a glass of water and pushes the pill out of the blister pack and hands it to Gerald, who swallows it back with water and then drinks the rest of the glass.
"I can't show him how to shift with my clothes on," Chatsworth replied with his usual understated amusement at John's expense.
In Serbia, the sadistic guard Danilo reduced Sherlock to meat and blood and bones and then tried to take that, too. But putting his cock in Sherlock's arse didn't give him the right to own any part of Sherlock and that includes his mind. Does he need time to heal? Yes. But Danilo did not break him, the guards did not break him, the freezing winter, the belt lashes, the lice, being used as a human toilet—
"That's exactly why I like it," Gerald says, his words coming out slurred as he tries not to move his lips.
Gerald looks so happy to see him when he answers the door, that John's heart stutters and he feels his composure crumbling. Gerald's hair is up in the charmingly haphazard topknot he usually wears at home, or when he's working.
John sighed and turned around to find the driver only inches away. He flinched back, started to step back but the driver grasped him firmly by the bicep. John was too taken aback to rip himself out of the man's hold.
They're both staring at the suspect across the way where he sits in the back of the ambulance, an orange blanket around his shoulders, handcuffs around his wrists and a glare on his face, though he wisely avoids eye contact. The paramedic who's supposed to be tending to his smashed-up cheek and split lip is chatting up the new Detective Constable under Lestrade.
Gerald laughs. "High heels do amazing things for legs. They tighten the calves and elongate the line of your legs. I've seen you naked, and I can
The guards congratulate Zivko, slapping him on the back and telling him he's a man now. The boy actually smiles at their congratulations, but Sherlock can see the look in Danilo's eyes calculating how best to use this against Zivko. Sherlock has probably just made things worse for Zivko.
Sherlock drags Blaine’s preparation out in the same way he did undressing him. It’s not necessary to keep adding the slippery gel to his fingers or to keep pushing them in and out of Blaine’s arsehole, but Sherlock does it anyway. Blaine’s prick drips and drips, and still Sherlock fucks him with his fingers, letting the tip of his middle finger caress Blaine’s prostate at random intervals. He takes his fingers out altogether and Blaine’s focus zeroes on Sherlock. Sherlock strokes Blaine’s dick, his grip too tight, the strokes just enough for Blaine to begin panting, and then he stops and shoves three fingers back into Blaine. Another drop of pre-cum falls on Blaine’s belly. Sherlock takes a savage pleasure in watching Blaine’s face as he twists and pulls inside Blaine’s body.
"Oh, God, if I broke your nose...Jesus Christ, Gerald, I'm so sorry. Okay, let's have a look," John says, his heart pounding out
Sherlock frowned so hard, his eyebrow ridges nearly touched each other. "Why would you want to be by yourthelf when you have me?"
One of the prescriptions John gave Gerald for Sherlock is for 2 mg clonazepam that dissolves on the tongue and is, therefore, quick acting. The other prescription was for 5 mg liquid melatonin to be administered sublingually. That, too, is quick acting.
The night is aglow with the lights of London, but here on this patio, shadows hug the edges of Gerald's face as he walks toward John. His hair is loose and longer than the last time John saw him, four months ago when he ended their relationship. Gerald is wearing a polo shirt and seersucker shorts and his feet are bare.
John can't help the sharp inhalation of breath, nor the way his heart seems to flutter in his chest, nor the tingling in his fingertips, the warmth that seems to bubble up from his chest, his spine, the tops of his thighs. His groin. Even as John tells his body not to react, Sherlock yanks John against him and John makes a noise that's supposed to be
John sags against the wall and rubs his hand over his forehead in frustration. He's lonely and has nobody to talk to about what happened. (Obviously Sherlock isn't sympathetic about the breakup, and, of course, he has his own fears and sorrow to overcome)
but when he opens his mouth all that comes out is a croak, and he gives up trying to speak in favor of encouraging his mouth to produce enough saliva to wet his parched throat.
John laughs, surprising himself—it's the first time he's laughed in days. But then his pager beeps and buzzes against his hipbone where it's tucked into his scrub bottoms.
"A fungal infection on my skin, mostly over my chest and legs. I was treated for head and pubic lice."
"I just want to know if I can say other words so long as they're not about penises!" Sherlock growled, the words bunching together as he tried to get them out before John shushed him. His tail whipped around and knocked John in the back of the head hard enough that he stumbled.
and I did some seriously intense trauma surgeon training at Bart's and then I went to Afghanistan, saved a bunch of men who got shot, lost a few. And then, and then—"
"Then I take them upstairs to the therapy room and show them the tools of my trade and explain what I expect from them. We talk about what they want to do during their sessions and what instruments they want me to use on them.
"Okay," John says, drawing the word out. He feels a little lost. He's never known the Holmes brothers to be on the same side and yet Mycroft is flat out telling John that he won't tell him what Sherlock is hiding.
There’s a glimpse of something desperate flickering in Blaine’s eyes. He knows exactly what’s going on here and Sherlock can almost believe that Blaine wants this to happen, that he wants to get rid of the burden of running a criminal enterprise. Maybe he’s tired of playing the straight man with the beautiful wife and two small daughters. Maybe he’s tired of never allowing himself to keep a lover longer than a few weeks. (Sherlock has been the longest.)
John grabs his pad of paper and a pen and starts writing his list for things he needs Gerald to pick up. The embassy doctors gave Sherlock ten days of an antibiotic because of all the open wounds. It's the same thing John would have prescribed. The anti-fungal, antibiotic creams, and lidocaine is fine so John won't need to change any of those.
"I'm perfectly well except for—" Sherlock says, and then pauses. John's a powder keg, clearly grieving, furious with Sherlock in addition to himself, and waiting for just one spark to go off.
Sherlock keeps his face turned away. "I've confessed my love and it doesn't seem to have changed anything. What else can I do?"
He stops at the window, pauses a moment, trying to rein in his feelings, and finding he can't, not anymore. He feels as fragile and unsure as he did the first night home, when desperation and relief made him take John in hand, knowing it would be the only time John would allow him to break the rules without paying for it later. Oh, but he has after all, hasn't he? Paid for it?
All through his work day, though, John can't stop thinking about the fight. He thinks of the look on Sherlock's face, the one he swore he would never put there. It's easy to lash out when you're afraid—so easy to break a promise when forced to face those fears, fears he pushed down into the subterranean depths of his mind and convinced himself they no longer had the power to hurt him.
"You dirty little slag," Sherlock says affectionately. He plants his feet flat on the bed, brings his thighs flush with John's back, and brings every muscle of his lower body to bear as he fucks himself up hard into the juicy, slippery so-
"Can we talk?" John asks, collapsing on the bed, the wall at his back, and Sherlock to his left. He draws his knees up and rests his arms on them, his hands hanging loosely.
The answer becomes moot when Sherlock jumps off the bed—which is memory foam rather than spring mattress, a good thing, or the toys, and bottles, and boxes of condoms would've gone flying and rolling off the bed—and sheds his t-shirt, and pajama bottoms (no pants). Then he studies the collection of items on the bed, and tosses all the toys into the bottom drawer, before picking up a few bottles and laying them out, and putting the rest in the top drawer, as well as the condoms for oral sex.
“If you don’t want me here, Bradley, why isn’t one of your agents in my place? Oh, wait, let me guess - taking down a
His voice is neutral, calm. Sherlock can imagine him leaning against the wall near the window, his arse the only thing connecting him to the wall. Arms crossed. Legs crossed at the ankle. Relaxed.
and Sherlock, who has been waiting for this moment for almost six hundred days, drops into a crouch and clasps his hands over his head.
As soon as September rolls around, John falls into little pockets of sadness at random times of the day. The closer he gets to the fifteenth, the sharper the sadness gets. After the twelfth, he spends every night at Gerald's. He's not trying to escape his own flat, the home he and Sherlock had together. It's just that he feels so emotionally fragile. He can't stand to be alone. When they're at Gerald's flat, John stays curled up around him, like Gerald can protect him from the looming anniversary date.
. Before John could question where it came from, he was overcome with a sudden awareness, a feeling of being balanced between one reality and another. He felt he could see beyond his physical surroundings to the metaphysical landscape that made up his soul. He could reach in and find the hook that was destroying him and break its hold.
John's throat closed up and he almost whimpered in the attempt to hold back what felt like could potentially be the biggest, ugliest cry he'd had since he was a little boy.
Gerald had been quick to referee, to introduce Cyril to John, but John had kept a possessive arm around Gerald all night, glowering at Cyril who'd looked completely unaffected, and falsely cheerful.
"Once you're ready, you would don the coat and shoes, and then you would meet me at—I have a—a place."
doctor's office, we medical professionals tend to encourage covering up the patient as much as possible." Then he added, "For their dignity."
Although he can't help but wonder what Sherlock would've thought if he could see John having a wank in his bed. What kind of fucked up person does that anyway?
Rebecca gives him a predatory wink and pulls the door out of John's hands. The cab pulls away, and John is left standing on the sidewalk, smiling like he's mental, getting hard, thinking of all the dirty things Sherlock has groaned and whispered in John's ear every time they have sex.
"Yeah, I have. We spend almost all our time together! How else was I supposed to explain why I'm stuck at home for the next week or so?"
Apparently done admiring his handiwork at Sherlock's groin, John reaches behind him and snags the box of condoms. He opens the box, and pulls out a strip, rips one off, and peels it open. Then, to Sherlock's confusion, pops it into his mouth, where it disappears. He leans forward, and pulls back the waistband of Sherlock's pants, takes the head of Sherlock's penis between thumb and forefinger, and his mouth takes Sherlock down all the way to his balls in one tight, smooth motion. Sherlock yelps and his hips thrust up slightly before John holds them down. It's only when John bobs back up does Sherlock realize what happened to the condom.
"So," Gerald says, with a little flourish of his hand. "Pasta Alfredo and maybe a salad? Oh, and plenty of wine, of course. Because when you meet a gorgeous stranger and take him home, it's only natural to ply him with alcohol to lower his inhibitions."
And for the rest of the day, as promised, John did not complain about the drool. (Although he did complain—just
When he's been cleaned and stitched and stuffed with medications and solutions, a nurse pushes his IV trolley and walks him (very slowly) to a room where he'll stay before getting on a private plane and heading home. Mycroft is sitting on the bed wearing, of all things, a jumper and jeans. He hasn't shaved in a couple of days.
A bachelor sized basket of unfolded laundry hides behind the small sofa and the neatly folded white cotton pants in a basket next to it shows the job was started and abandoned halfway through. John wonders if Gerald is wearing a pair of those white cotton pants right now and he grins.
He looks so vulnerable standing there naked, his soft penis curled up against his thigh like a sleeping mushroom. Sherlock begins to catalogue the things Blaine will never do again. He’ll never need to wear clothes again. He’ll never use his penis again. He’ll never again see his children, whom he loves, or his wife, who he doesn’t.
Sherlock lets out an undignified squeak and tries to wriggle his way out of John's hold. "Go away!" he finally shouts. "I'm
Chatsworth hovered in the kitchen, clearly wanting to help, but John waved him off. Then he reached down and picked Sherlock up. As usual, Sherlock's tail coiled around John's waist. John rubbed his cheek against Sherlock's both as a sign of affection and to reassure him.
John expects Gerald's kiss to be hard, the opposite of a woman's soft pliancy but Gerald's full lips are soft and he lets John lead the kiss. They exchange open-mouthed kisses for a few minutes before John dares to dart his tongue out and run it along Gerald's lips. A soft, breathy moan escapes Gerald and that response ignites the desire in John's gut. Want and need twist and coil inside him. He grips Gerald roughly in his arms, pulling him closely and when that's not close enough, he puts his hands on Gerald's hips and yanks him. Gerald lands with half his arse in John's lap and they laugh against each other's lips.
"—poor niece, she were pregnant when he got sick. She were his favorite and same on his end. It was just back pain, and we thought he'd pulled a muscle. Finally, his doctor gives him a scan, and tells us it's lung cancer! That were six months ago, and he's been dead two—"
," he tells John, before yanking his fingers out of his mouth, the scrape of John's teeth causing a sudden flush of blood to his prick.
door opening and closing and then, finally, the scraping metal sound of the shower curtain rings as the curtain is drawn open and then closed. Then silence for seven seconds (other than the ambient sounds) and then—there it is—weeping.
"You need to pee," John said and guided him to the litter box set up in the kitchen. It was three sided, much smaller than the feeding pen, and held normal cat litter.
"I'll tie him to the bed," John offers with a grin, which disappears when he sees the look in Mycroft's eyes. "Sorry," John mutters.
At that, Rebecca's pager goes off as well. "Uh-oh," Rebecca says, grimacing at John, who echoes her dread.
"You can take a shower and shave later, but for now I want you to go back to sleep. You're going to get at least eight hours of sleep a night for the next month, maybe longer."
"And, as your Dom, I'd say, you can disobey, but you'll be having a lonely wank in the bathroom. Punishment."
When my firstborn was teething, none of the advice I was given worked. I'd read in a baby book called, appropriately,
"Well, babysitter or litter changer just don't have the same cachet." Chatsworth gave him a cheeky smile.
Chatsworth smiled, but it was a distracted smile. He closed his eyes. The air around him seemed to blur as though he was a pencil sketch and someone was smudging the picture with their fingers.
All through his work day, though, John can't stop thinking about the fight. He thinks of the look on Sherlock's face, the one he swore he would never put there. It's easy to lash out when you're afraid—so easy to break a promise when forced to face those fears, fears he pushed down into the subterranean depths of his mind and convinced himself they no longer had the power to hurt him.
human. That implies we're animals when not in our human form. Most dragons will take offense to what you said. "
Sherlock ducked his head, corkscrewing his tail a couple of times and pulling it in close to his body.
Sherlock rarely curses. He thinks it indicates a lack of imagination. So, when Sherlock uses a curse word it makes a big impact. Sherlock is happy to see that John's eyes are open wide in astonishment. He looks on the verge of saying something so Sherlock decides to just get it over with.
Rebecca pays the tab, and John lets her, and they walk outside, the sky still light at almost nine in the evening. A taxi pulls up, and John opens her door. When she's half in and half out of the cab, she asks, earnestly, "But you will come, right?"
The bed was getting crowded, too. John and Sherlock had slept together from the first day they'd met, when Sherlock was still in the egg. John wasn't about to force him to sleep somewhere else or—worse—on the floor like a dog. But every night, John felt he was pushed further and further towards the edge of the bed.
"You make it sound so ominous," John says, leaning close to tease a kiss from Gerald, who doesn't take the bait. "Fine. What do you mean by
Sherlock's eyes lift to John's face, and John's knees almost buckle with relief at seeing the recognition there, and now the urge to hold Sherlock is even stronger, but he can't, not yet.
Although he's madly in love with Sherlock, their move from friends to lovers has been abrupt, and he hesitates before continuing, face heating, "Clean. Myself. Out." The words are pointed but quietly spoken.
Sherlock knows the choice is between dying or surrendering. He still values his life because he has a strong will to survive, to return to London and John. But he also values his life in part because he lives in fear that there's something he's missed, that Moriarty has one last trick up his sleeve even after death and that someone will get to John and make him pay for nothing more offensive than being Sherlock's friend.
Gerald makes him wait fifteen minutes and by the time he comes in, John has moved from sitting on the bed to lounging half on and half off it. When he hears the door open, he snaps back to sitting like Gerald told him to and berates himself for how easily he slips into the role of submissive. He's not
"What if it catches fire?" Sherlock asks. The subtextual animosity of their relationship before Sherlock went away is gone, but Sherlock is still a little brother and little brothers are hard-wired to annoy older brothers.
"I truly hate repeating myself," Sherlock says, the words far more playful than haughty after all these years. "I
He keeps himself raised above John and John can feel the cool air over the cleft of his arse. His cheeks are spread wide by the position Gerald has him in. John feels completely exposed.
than I did then, but I find that I do. Last night was a result of three years of longing, John. Three years of wanting and not having and eighteen months out of those years, I was away from you and it was
The next thing he's aware of, he's being shaken awake by John, whose eyes are a bit wild, and whose keys jingle madly from his hand.
"Yes, it matters! I know you, John Watson, and I know you would never cheat on Gerald—or anyone else for that matter—unless it was with someone extremely important to you! Was it someone from your past? A
And John comes, abruptly and untouched, arse clamping painfully tight around Sherlock, who hisses and stares in shock at John grunting and straining and twisting below him, and has to keep John's hips in a death grip so he doesn't rip himself off of Sherlock while his muscles are so rigidly clenched. John moans, "Oh, shit, oh fuck, I'm sorry, I told you your mouth!" even as his cum splatters the duvet, and Sherlock thinks
to understand John's point of view, but he doesn't, and can't help but turn back, and say, "If we both want it—and I know you want it, John—then I don't understand why we can't at least
Chatsworth pulled a small paper bag out of a much larger one but didn't immediately hand it over. "I just want you to know that one of Mr. Holmes's lower level employees was sent out to get these things. He was told it was for teething, and of course he assumed human. I have no idea why the task was given to someone who doesn't know dragons. I looked through it and I'm not entirely sure that any of it will be very helpful."
He's normally pretty good at pushing away personal stuff when at work. He needs full concentration to work in an A&E, especially in a hospital as large and busy as The London Royal Hospital. He's distracted, but the ambulance bays are empty for now and there hasn't been an actual emergency yet.
and what it means for himself as a man. It drives Sherlock into despair sometimes that John's still not
"That's a very good question," John muttered. He let out a blustery sigh and looked up at Holmes. "Now how did you go about getting a dragon for a brother when you're human if you didn't experiment on him, huh?"
had a flashback has really tapped out his body. John knows he'll call into work the next morning to stay home with Sherlock and keep an eye on him.
John seems to accept this explanation, or is too tired to complain, but it takes him ages to relax against Sherlock's body. Sherlock counts out the minutes, his own eyes beginning to droop
. John asks, "Er, so you, uh, what—want to wear stilettos and your Belstaff while we have sex?" Sherlock shakes his head quickly, still staring at his laptop, and then it hits John. "You want
“I hate to break the mood, but I have to get my trousers off or my cock is going to be permanently damaged by my zipper," Sherlock says, sucking in a breath through his teeth when John bites his lip and grinds down several more times, drawing heavy groans out of Sherlock's mouth.
"It's not my fault you have tender human skin," Sherlock said, turning his head away from John. He pulled up his long tail and coiled it around himself.
The house is large, with a courtyard and "breezeway" as Elspeth calls it. It's a screened in porch with a small bar with two stools, a sturdy patio table with two chairs, and a TV mounted on the wall. It makes an impression on Sherlock because it connects the garage to the rest of the house and is pretty much all of what he sees of the house for the first week.
He pulls back the collar of Gerald's shirt to suck and lick along the tendon while Gerald hisses and sighs. John pulls back and looks at him. Gerald's eyes are dark, his face flushed, his hair tangled where John's fingers were twisting through it.
Sherlock obediently opens his mouth and drinks. Because Sherlock is half a foot taller than John, the angle John holds the glass at is inexact. As a result, some water escapes between the glass and the corners of Sherlock's lips and the water travels over Sherlock's chin and then down his neck to his chest.
From the moment he woke up the next morning, John dutifully took Sherlock's temperature. Out of curiosity, John took it more often than the instructions specified. After the big jump from morning to evening the day before, the egg's temperature seemed to have stalled. It hardly crept up at all over the next six hours. Finally, he forced himself to stop obsessing, and settled into conversation with Sherlock.
Chatsworth set the cooler on the table and unzipped it. Both John and Sherlock edged closer. "These are raw chicken bone legs and I froze a dozen for you, Sherlock. They stay cold longer than rubber or cloth. Plus, as their teeth come in, they can eat the bones. Since the bones are uncooked, we don't have to worry about splinters of bone getting stuck in their gullet or anything."
"Good. I wanted to be able to speak to you privately. Firstly, I never intended to put the onus of caring for my brother on your shoulders, so I would like to verify that you are indeed willing to act as his doctor until his wounds are healed?"
"Last year. It's not important—we can catch up later. If you break any rules, you'll get a firsthand tour of where I work, because I
and touches his tongue to the tiny white pill inside, then pulls it back into his mouth, remembering not to swallow or chew, but let it dissolve on his tongue.
"You're gonna sleep down here, okay? We'll see about the bedrooms when you're better, but for now there's no point you walking up extra stairs. Plus, I want to have you near me when I'm down here."
Sherlock is shaking so hard his teeth are chattering. His heartbeat is thunderous… how can John not hear it? Sherlock rushes to the flat door and locks it, then does the same for the kitchen door. Then he runs back to his chair, but John is nowhere to be found. Sherlock's so pumped full of adrenaline that his toes and face are completely numb.
Olivia gives her the look of long-suffering spouses everywhere. Half irritation, half amusement. Sherlock’s face turns red, and John hides his grin behind his glass of champagne.
In the bathroom, John gets out the kit he put together on Gerald's advice regarding anorectal hygiene.
John sits up, his body rigid, and his nostrils flaring, and says, "I sat there for a minute and a half, staring at you because I was distracted by sex. I've dealt with at least a dozen of your flashbacks, and that one was—because
"Ah!" John said, stepping towards Holmes, who—to John's smug delight—shrank back momentarily before gathering his dignity about him once more. "You want to
"Being glad to be home doesn't automatically mean you're glad he died. Event A—his suicide—resulted in Event B. Your rescue. Could you have helped him?"
Sherlock glares at him, and John laughs, then rolls off of Sherlock. By the time, Sherlock has stood up, and unzipped his trousers, John has shimmied his way out of his scrubs, and has his thumbs hooked in his pants. Sherlock surges forward to stop him.
When he sees Sherlock, he covers his mouth with his hand and tears squeeze from his eyes. Mycroft keeps himself in check while the nurse helps Sherlock sit, as comfortably as possible, in a chair, with his IV trolley safely tucked next to him.
"The thing is," John says and stops again. "I know we're men, and British men in particular don't like talking about their feelings, but you and I—we've lived on the edge of death together, Sherlock. After all that we've been through, do you really not trust me?"
. He could hear the echo of that voice whining out his name. The pain hit, but it was less powerful than it had been. Was it because there was no specific memory? Or was the spell losing its power?
He goes out for a pint with Lestrade and Mike regularly. He meets at least one of them at a pub every week, almost a regular thing. Everyone feels the pall of Sherlock's death hanging over them. Life seems to be devoid of vitality and John's grateful he's not the only one who feels it.
Sherlock's real hope is that he doesn't lose his usefulness as an informant because then they'll have no excuse to keep him alive so he doles out information as sparingly as he can. Then they bring in a guard named Danilo, a sadistic bastard, the kind always found in facilities like this. He's the kind of man who doesn't care about getting information out of Sherlock; he's only there to make Sherlock's life as horrific as possible. The other two – whose names Sherlock doesn't bother learning – will interrogate him occasionally, but their brutality is limited to a punch to the face here and there or locking him in the box. Danilo, though, likes to be able to
Sherlock sits silently, his mind sifting through examples of grief that don't involve the death of a loved one, so he can determine how long he should wait before cornering John and kissing him. Obviously, he can't ask John—even Sherlock knows that's beyond the pale. He watches John, who is also sitting silently, who, in fact, is beginning to look like a John-shaped thing in which John no longer resides. Suddenly, John seems far too still to be alive.
Dutifully, John turned to watch as a sizeable piece of shell was punched off the egg with enough force to send it flying into the kitchen.
mad, out of nowhere and he doesn't know why. Only he does, actually, because he swore to himself that he'd never make Sherlock feel that way, but then he went and did it, and now he doesn't know how to fix it—isn't sure he
John's face morphs from incredulous to appalled. He shakes his head slowly, and says, "Uh, no. Nope. Why would he? He knew how I felt about you!"
Sherlock ate three bowls of food and then promptly fell asleep halfway through the fourth one, his snout still caught in the plastic bowl.
"Stand up over here, please," John says. He realizes that if he's going to do this Dom/sub business with Gerald, that's going to be one of his hard limits – he gets to say
John kneels down and undoes the button and zip on Gerald's cargo trousers. Gerald lifts his hips without being told to and John tugs his trousers down so very slowly, trailing his fingertips as he goes, before dropping them behind him with Gerald's shirt. He never takes his eyes off of Gerald's. John wants him to know he's being conquered. Gerald is now laid out on the bed in nothing but his white cotton pants, already damp with Gerald's arousal. It's a beautiful sight. It's so much easier to tell whether a man is turned on, John realizes, although John would never wish that women were
John won't be going back to sleep. Once he wakes up, he's up for the day, so he quietly pulls clean clothes out of his dresser and wardrobe and then sneaks out of the bedroom. He has things to do this morning, so an early start gives him time to relax before his busy day begins. John showers, keeping as quiet as possible so as not to wake Sherlock. Then he goes into the kitchen and makes himself a cup of tea.
Sherlock turns his head and glares at John, squinting his eyes, and says, "It's Mycroft," as if that explains everything.
"If you're asking if he's within hearing range, then, yes, he's in the room with me. He's glaring at me right now actually."
, of course, it were an accepted practice. The article is titled "Why Did Men Stop Wearing High Heels?" on the BBC News website.
"You're convinced nothing Sherlock feels is real, despite what Mycroft and I have told you, because to
"You mean, you thought I was using you?" John asks, slightly indignant, then realizes Gerald has only known him roughly twelve hours and has every right to ask.
"What about Gerald?" Sherlock says, bringing his shoulders up in a half shrug, half arrested lunge for the bed. "You've been despondent ever since."
"What are you writing?" Elspeth asks. She's lying on her stomach and the sheet has slipped down to her waist.
She grabs John's arm and pulls him inside into the blessed air conditioning. John's wearing cargo shorts and a plaid short sleeve button down but it's still hot as balls outside. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so damn
Approximately ten hours after he meets Gerald, John is woken up by the insistent press of an erection against his backside. In his drowsy state, he doesn't think twice about pressing back against it. Gerald pushes himself gently against the cleft of John's arse. Gerald's hand - muscled just like his arms with large knuckles and prominent veins - reaches over John's waist and strokes John's prick, which begins to swell enthusiastically.
"I believe my brother needs to speak with a therapist about what he endured in Serbia. Did you read the medical brief?"
John doesn't even realize he was holding his breath until it all comes out of him in a rush and he gives in to his urge to comfort Gerald, but Gerald holds up his hand, refusing to meet John's gaze.
Gerald is vibrating with barely suppressed fury, but John doesn't lower his gaze, knowing every minute of Gerald's anger he endures is only what he deserves.
"Yeah, I guess...I just—this brings up another question. You said you liked being a sub. Does this mean you want to be punished for things?"
"I did," John says without self-consciousness and then lifts his head off the pillow to bury his nose against Gerald's scalp, sniffing with cartoonish exaggeration.
"How are you feeling about all this, then?" Gerald asks. "I mean, are you—it's quite a feat he's pulled. Are you angry?"
Gerald steps back so John can come in, but when Gerald leans in to kiss him, John thrusts the box towards him. Gerald freezes, then reaches out slowly to take it. He turns around and walks stiffly towards the kitchen to leave it on the worktop. John follows, but stands next to the dining room table, leaving several feet of space between him and Gerald.
"You are my heart and Moriarty knew it, even before I did. Everything I did was only because I wanted to protect you."
a developmental milestone you're supposed to have grown out of before adolescence. By the time a child is eight years old, they've begun to separate their perception of events from other people's intent.
Sherlock gets out of bed, and pads into the kitchen. He needs to relieve himself, but if John is still home, he doesn't want to miss the chance to say goodbye. From the kitchen, the back of John's head is clearly visible in his chair. Reassured, Sherlock uses the loo and brushes his teeth, before going to greet John.
Even though the FBI and MI6 have dismantled the hierarchy of the trafficking enterprise, they have yet to cut it off at the source. The people responsible on the European side, headquartered in Serbia, are looking for other buyers in Western Europe now that the American market is closed. This is Sherlock's last mission. The man at the top, the one responsible for the entire scam, is an important political figure, beloved by the armed forces of Serbia. Sherlock is so deeply undercover that not even Mycroft knows where he is. He knows where Sherlock is
and gingerly removes the wad of gauze between his arse cheeks. He needs to replace it but he doesn't know how he can get to the kitchen and find the gauze without John noticing.
"I'm going to write you a prescription for antibiotics and I want you to take them for three days. I'll get you a probiotic, too, so you don't get an overgrowth of yeast in your gut. I have to run to the surgery to get my prescription pad."
Sherlock weeps. It takes so long for him to die. One minute turns into two. Blaine’s struggles gradually decrease. Two minutes turn into three. Blaine is limp but still alive. Sherlock doesn’t take any weight off his forearm. Four minutes. Five. Six.
the condom, and the ephemerous thought is discarded by his brain as being unimportant. In fact, his brain is rapidly shedding all coherent thought not related to John, John's mouth, and what John and his mouth are doing to Sherlock's dick.
During the long car ride back to London, he found himself mostly bewildered, rather than distraught. He had
His lips travel from John's ear down to his jaw, to his throat where they rest against John's carotid.
"If you're confident you can put her off until tomorrow, John, then I'll leave it to you to give her the good news."
, was half my fault, and half his. He—I think—he did it on purpose, made it incompatible to go out on dates, and have a job, and the other things ordinary people do. We were lying to each other a bit, I think—we didn't have anyone else outside of each other, not really—I mean, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, you know, Molly, Mike.
about the turn things have taken. He doesn't regret it, not even as he has to pinch himself through the light cotton of his pajama bottoms to keep himself from running to John to comfort him.
John laughed. "Okay, okay!" He stood up and stepped to the crate and peered into the hole Sherlock had made in his shell. What he saw was mostly shadow—the eggshell was too thick to let in any light. "I can't see anything Sherlock. It's too—"
After a twelve hour shift in the A&E of The Royal London Hospital, John needed to shower, eat, and sleep, in that order. Before moving onto those tasks, though, he took the egg's temperature (101.7°) and found himself reluctant to leave it, as though it would hatch if it wasn't being watched.
"How long am I supposed to wait? A week, a month? How do I protect myself in the meantime? What if he doesn't feel—"
"Yep," John says. "It's sad, breaking up with someone you care about. It'll be a long time before we can repair our friendship."
John's jaw clenches as he feels hurt trying to spill out of him and he tries to stop it, but it's already out. "I loved you, and you broke me when you left, and I glued myself back together, and then you came back, and broke me all over again, and now I don't work right without you,” John says softly, quickly, feeling feverish with exhaustion and too many goddamned feelings for one man to handle in the space of a few hours. "No, that's not—not true."
. Sherlock says nothing. He keeps his fingertip lightly pressed on Blaine’s lip, not pushing in but not pulling away, and waits. He doesn’t have to wait long. After eleven seconds, Blaine closes his mouth over Sherlock’s fingertip and sucks the semen off it. Sherlock pulls back his hand and Blaine lets go of his finger with a pop.
*REMEMBER: Be honest in your journal! Behavior modification doesn’t work if you lie about achieving your goals. I get paid either way.
"Yeah," John says and turns back to face the bar, not sure he wants to get drawn into a conversation with a stranger. He looks Gerald over in his peripheral vision.
"Sherlock," Mycroft says gently. "If you put him in the position of being unfaithful to his boyfriend, he'll resent you for it."
Sherlock makes a dismissive sound, but nods in acknowledgement, before sitting down next to John. "You can fuck me on my back. Or I can be on top."
Before Sherlock came back from the dead, John wanted to keep his weekends free so that his schedule coincided with Gerald's.
Four tiny stitches later, John smears antibiotic ointment on Gerald's lip, but leaves it unbandaged.
For one shivering moment, Sherlock holds onto reality by trying to tip his consciousness over and into the warmth of John's eyes, whose eyebrows have just drawn together in confusion before he and everything around him blinks out of existence to be replaced with cold concrete, a sinister voice, and terror made all the more razor sharp by the joy and love that went before it.
Over Sherlock's head, John could see Chatsworth's eyes bright with merriment. When he looked back at Sherlock, he could feel his eyes brimming with affection for his little dragon. "No, I can't see the future. But statistically I have almost zero chance of dying today. And keep in mind that if something
Holmes drew himself up. "If I provide the information you desire, will you agree to release the egg?"
Sherlock's forehead rests against John's stomach and he reaches into John's bottoms and his nimble fingers wrap around the base of John's shaft and then slide up. His fingertips tug John's foreskin up and down over his glans before sliding down and then back up again, thumb stroking over the slit, fingers dragging his foreskin back and forth. John knows that if he doesn't intervene soon, he's going to come and this is a problem. This is a
"Sherlock, please!" John hisses. "Do you know how hard it is to want you and to know what's happened to you and to feel like a dirty creeping pervert for still wanting you anyway?"
"I—I missed you, too," John says nervously. "Um, why don't you lie down on your right side here. See if you can get back to sleep?"
"I'm sorry, Sherlock," John says as he takes off his coat and hangs it up. "I never should've walked out like that."
"I can't do it—I need help with my shirt. My shoulder and elbow," he says and his eyes slide away, not wanting to meet John's.
, of course, it were an accepted practice. The article is titled "Why Did Men Stop Wearing High Heels?" on the BBC News website.
John turns to Sherlock, and lays his hand on Sherlock's ankle. His thumb begins to rub little circles in the inside bone, and Sherlock starts to relax into the touch. John looks down at his thumb making circles around the delicate skin of Sherlock's ankle (he hadn't known they were an erogenous zone, but then again—everywhere John touched was an erogenous zone).
"Yes, at the, um, embassy. The doctors reports, they're in my bag," Sherlock says and points over his shoulder towards the sitting room. He turns to go and get it, but John stops him.
, will you just do it already?" and Sherlock says, "No," the word drawn out slow and sultry, and John presses back and then forward, and Sherlock purrs, "Oh, god, look at you, you gorgeous, filthy, little—if I just stood here holding my cock out, would you fuck yourself on it?" and John says, "Don't call me little," and Sherlock chuckles darkly, and asks, slowly, the timbre of his voice almost threatening, "Would you fuck yourself on my cock if I just stood here?" and John moans, "Yes," and Sherlock pulls his finger out, and then pushes his index and middle finger inside.
John stuffs the bowl, notebook and matchbox in his coat pockets, pushes himself up and holds a hand out for Gerald. John pulls him into a bruising hug. He buries his face in Gerald's neck.
The mission was outlined for Sherlock when he was still on the private jet that took him over the Atlantic. There are three bars in the French Quarter where Whitney goes to pick up his sexual partners, and they’re all being avidly watched by FBI agents. Sherlock and Tate will stay in a hotel in the French Quarter close enough to these establishments that Sherlock can reach them within ten minutes. As soon as they get confirmation that Whitney has settled in one of these bars, Sherlock will walk in and use his considerable skills in seduction to get picked up by Whitney.
“Come home with me,” Blaine says again but without the aggressive confidence of earlier. He’s far more undone than Sherlock and Sherlock is fucking undone.
Rebecca smiles, her eyes wistful. She reaches out and wraps John in her arms, her soft woman's body fitting against him in a way that feels strange after so long in a man's arms. John has hugged Rebecca on multiple occasions, but those were quick
Sherlock's face seems to be nuzzling against the back of John's neck, lightly snuffling, even, without his conscious permission, but he can't make himself stop, not when John seems to finally be relaxing
At first, John is nervous about having Gerald in the flat because he sees so much of Sherlock there, especially in the sitting room. Two months after he meets Gerald, John has the bittersweet realization that he's gradually let his own personality take over. It’s been eight months since Sherlock died.
John shakes his head; the last thing he wants to do while lying naked in the bed of a sexy stranger is talk about Sherlock. So he's shocked as hell when he starts talking about it anyway. He's never told anyone about his feelings for Sherlock and it's like opening a floodgate. He spills it all out, sometimes sobbing, sometimes laughing, the story far from chronologically cohesive. The whole time, Gerald never looks at him with impatience or pity.
Gerald steps closer. "I'm better than I was the last time I saw you," he says and there's still a note of bitterness in his voice.
When you’re the smartest person in the room, but rarely praised for it; when you know all the answers but nobody wants to hear them; when nobody can understand you because the way you think seems to them like magic, rather than logic, you spend your life in isolation. There is always a darkness creeping up behind you, flanking you, threatening to overpower you. What’s the point of being a genius when you have no audience?
Ten minutes later, Gerald is out of the shower and they're kissing on the new bed and ten minutes after that, John is on his hands and knees, already panting with desire. He remembers several women he dated telling him something along the lines of
"What about Gerald?" Sherlock says, bringing his shoulders up in a half shrug, half arrested lunge for the bed. "You've been despondent ever since."
John's nostrils are flaring. His jaw is clenched so tightly that it's making his head hurt, but he forces his voice to sound calm. "I'd not even wrapped my own head around what happened yet, much less know how to tell you."
Two and a half months after the press conference, Rebecca asks John to meet her for a pint when she gets off work. She's trying to talk John around to going to the  party celebrating the birth of Olivia and Bernie's son, but John is nervous about how he'll be received by Gerald and doesn't want to show up at such an important event if it will cause any awkwardness or draw attention from the main event—that being the little event himself, Milton.
"You bastard!" Gerald laughs. "Your possessive ex-boyfriend is getting his revenge and you're laughing at me?"
“You don't have to do anything right now,” Gerald says and wraps his arms around John from behind. “Consider turning it into a guest room eventually. You never know when you might need one.”
For several moments John can't speak. When, at last, he does, it's with a voice heavy with responsibility.
"I'm in love with you, Dr. Watson, but you are currently embroiled in a romantic relationship with another man. So, I'm declaring my candidacy for the office of Dr. Watson's lover."
"My dear, sometimes I forget that you're still learning the nuances of the English language. When I said
"It's normal, John. Release of endorphins, oxytocin, all that stuff. Makes you feel warm and cuddly, emotionally open, all the stuff men are not supposed to be. The orgasm was good, though, yeah?"
don't have time—I wasn't lying about that," but Sherlock shushes him. "Give me twenty minutes, all right?" and John nods.
I thank each of you, especially those who commented. I read things and don't comment often mostly because I read everything on an app on my tablet rather than directly in the browser so I'd be a hypocrite to fish for comments when I'm guilty of not commenting myself. So, I'll just say that all us writers beg for comments so when you have the opportunity it impetus to comment, do it!
is located on the first floor. The bathroom on the second floor was never finished, so even using the toilet and taking a shower required him to go down to the first floor.
"I need a shower and food, and then we need to talk," John says, wiggling his way out of Sherlock's arms.
After his breakup with Gerald, Rebecca and Cyril (who John is the closest to out of all of Gerald's friends) stay in touch with John daily and try to get him to open up about what happened. While John appreciates their concern, he can't say anything other than it was a joint decision to end their relationship, and eventually they stop, realizing they're just making things worse by trying to get him and Gerald to talk about it.
"Fine, order something," Sherlock says, rolling his eyes. "Although now what I have to tell you will be anticlimactic so I might as well just say it. NSY is holding a press conference on the twenty-sixth to clear my name. There, see? That's why I wanted to tell you right away."
"Jesus, Sherlock!" he says, exasperated and worried in equal measure. "Sit down. I need to see if you've chipped the bone."
Mostly he finds questions on sports websites about whether men can wear women's running shoes or hiking boots.
In this life, though, the concern breaks through some of the wall Sherlock is trying to erect to keep John from seeing him cry. It's bad enough that Sherlock spilled all that shit out last night. John already thinks he's broken. He doesn't need any more proof.
And while Sherlock wasted those months trying to convince John he knew what he wanted, John's relationship with his boyfriend would be gaining more and more traction, making it harder and less likely Sherlock would get what he wanted. So Sherlock decides to lie. Well, he's just not going to tell
Sherlock knows that his hunt for Moriarty’s people is about revenge as much as protecting John, but there’s guilt and shame mixed in as well. He loved playing the game with Moriarty. In his very darkest moments, he misses Moriarty and their little dance. He wanted to impress Moriarty just as much as he wanted to stop him. His confrontation with Moriarty on the rooftop of St. Bart’s wasn’t only a blow to Sherlock’s belief in his own supremacy, it was a glimpse into the abyss that Sherlock has been skirting for too many years to count.
"How am I going to get that stuff, Mycroft, when I can't leave him alone!" John said, then scrubbed his hands over his face.
Sitting in his hideaway contemplating all of this is driving Sherlock up the wall. And he's bored. He wants to go home—home to John, home to what's familiar and comforting. He'll just have to apologize to John for…what exactly is he apologizing for, though? The thought makes him angry all over again, but he takes the anger and smashes it into a ball, smaller and smaller, then locks it into a box and throws it into the basement of his mind palace where all the other shit he doesn't want to deal with lies.
Mycroft looks down at his notes, not deigning to answer. "Mrs. Hudson will need to be told. Have you thought of the best way to tell her that won't involve her shrieking the news to half the neighborhood?"
in freckles. Her eyes are pale blue. She's wearing khaki shorts and an old t-shirt that says “Gruene, Texas.”
John couldn't help but laugh. Then he laid his hand on Sherlock's head. Sherlock nuzzled into it and John felt tears in his eyes. "It's good to finally meet you, Sherlock."
After they're gone, John heads towards the kitchen to scrounge something up for supper. His instinct is to collapse on the sofa next to Sherlock and pull him into his arms, but he knows Sherlock wouldn't appreciate it.
"Last night was me tossing my hat into the ring," Sherlock says. He brings his hands up, pressing his fingertips together.
He took a step towards the kitchen and tripped, barely catching himself from face planting by grabbing at the kitchen wall. John turned and glared at Sherlock.
John starts laughing and then Gerald gives him truly stunning head that ends in a mind-blanking orgasm, and John falls asleep in Gerald's arms, surrounded by Sherlock's things and feels at true peace for the first time since he saw Sherlock fall from the roof of St. Bart's.
Gerald pays the tab and then takes John's hand and leads him outside. The air is humid; spring is just around the corner and even though it's almost eight in the evening, the sky is still light. Gerald hails a cab, and doesn't let go of John's hand until they're climbing inside, and then he takes John's hand again. John tries not to stare at Gerald, but he really is an incredibly good-looking man. John wants him but he's embarrassed to tell Gerald he's never actually been with a man.
He stops and bends over so abruptly, that John collides with his (ridiculously lush and shapely) rear with an
"Give me fifteen minutes, Sherlock, please," John says, wiggling his way out of Sherlock's grip. "I'll be able to focus better if you let me take a shower first. I've had a shit day."
"They're having a party to celebrate the baby, and they've invited us." John hesitates, not wanting to trip Sherlock's defensiveness by suggesting he has to be bribed to attend a social function with John, but also not wanting to be outright rejected for asking Sherlock to go. "Saturday night. Do you want to go?"
bit impatient with the glacial progression of time during that part of the flashback recovery process.
"No, Sherlock, no." John tries to get Sherlock to look at him, but Sherlock just leans heavier against him and John gives up. "I'm the one who's sorry—and I am. I don't have an excuse for how I behaved. I want—if
John doesn't immediately obey Sherlock's directive to shove his arse into Sherlock's face, so Sherlock gets a good grip around John's thighs and wrenches him down so that Sherlock's entire face is covered by John's arse, his balls bumping against Sherlock's brow. John moans and curses, and Sherlock alternates licking wide strokes over John's hole with thrusts of his tongue against and into John's hole until it's loose enough for him to work a finger into. He licks around his finger, and then lifts his head to watch John gripping the sheets so that he doesn't touch his cock. Satisfied, Sherlock lowers his head again, and keeps licking around his finger, crooking it up in a come hither gesture, and gradually fucks his tongue into John alongside his finger.
it. Desire unfurls low in John's body and blood rushes to fill his prick. He groans, half from pleasure and half from the frustration of not being able to get out of Sherlock's arms without hurting him physically
"What," Mycroft choked out. "Have you been teaching him?" John opened his mouth to defend himself, but Mycroft held up a hand. "Forget I asked."
John's heart rate goes up and he feels his face heat in embarrassment, as though he's been caught doing something wrong. "No, I—well a bit, when I was—younger, and still thought I was going to meet a nice, normal woman, and settle down. As opposed to a mad bastard. He'd probably experiment on any child of ours. But, I mean—that's just—not that we would have a child for him to experiment on. It’s just, we would be
The tension at home feels unbearable sometimes, even on the days John doesn't work or when Sherlock hasn't had a nightmare the night before. It's like the two of them can't relax, knowing that a flashback or panic attack can rip through their uneasy peace at any moment.
As Sherlock grew, it became harder for him to navigate through the flat without knocking something over or bumping into things. John and Chatsworth had to clear everything out that wasn't absolutely necessary and push the larger furniture against the walls to leave plenty of room.
. Semen fountains up out of Gerald's cock and John doesn't know if he wants to watch that more than Gerald's face so his eyes flit back and forth between the two. John takes his hands off Gerald's foreskin and just uses his hand up and down the shaft to work Gerald through the last waves of his climax.
John isn’t just the audience to Sherlock’s genius, though. He’s the light in the cold dark; the hymn in the empty church; the path through the thorn-sharp thicket. Without John, Sherlock may as well be living in a vacuum. Moriarty threatened to burn the heart out of Sherlock. John is his heart and he’ll do whatever it takes to obliterate that threat.
! —he can't fight it anymore. Silently, but quickly, he moves through the flat, turns the knob of John's bedroom door
Before he realizes he's made a decision, Sherlock jumps up from the microscope and darts for their bedroom. After showering and shaving, he shimmies into a pair of dark skinny jeans that John says makes his arse look like he's nineteen, and a blue button down with subtle silver stripes. He rolls up the sleeves because it's about a thousand degrees outside, but he doesn't want to meet John's friends wearing a t-shirt.
, obviously, anything John asks of him, he'll do it because he doesn't want to be anywhere but right here.
With Sherlock's head resting over his shoulder and his constant exclamations of wonder and curiosity, John found the ninety minute trip passing by in the blink of an eye. It was something wonderful to see one's everyday familiar world through the eyes of someone for whom it was new. The sun seemed to shine more strongly with Sherlock next to him and the green of the English countryside seemed saturated with color.
It's only then that he realizes the folder is no longer on the table. He didn't touch it, which means Sherlock must have stuck it back in his duffel bag. John doesn't want to go in there and wake him up so he lets it go for now. He sends Gerald a text message with the list.
Sherlock gets out of bed, and pads into the kitchen. He needs to relieve himself, but if John is still home, he doesn't want to miss the chance to say goodbye. From the kitchen, the back of John's head is clearly visible in his chair. Reassured, Sherlock uses the loo and brushes his teeth, before going to greet John.
after being rescued from torture and you made a promise on my behalf to be responsible for your treatment?"
, but she was indirectly responsible for making it possible. She is the sweetest, gentlest person I've ever met, and that's including my children. We email each other almost daily even when all we have to say is, "Nothing much happened today" and sometimes getting an email like that from Tia was the opening to reach out that I didn't even realize I needed until it was offered. I leaned on her a lot when I realized Pippin's heart failure was advanced enough that he would need to be euthanized, and I continue to lean on her for that and many other reasons.
John lost his balance, his vision flickering, and clutched the worktop to keep from falling but ended up on his arse anyway. He'd kept hold of the paper and pen, though. His eyes wandered the kitchen and noticed a shiny new food processor.
"What are you doing, Sherlock?" John asked even though he knew exactly what Sherlock was doing—the crumpled tissues said it all. After all, John had been an adolescent boy once.
tell you, and then you jumped, and I hated myself for not saying something before. I thought maybe you'd not have jumped if you knew how I felt."
"Mycroft," Sherlock said in an authoritative voice, "Perhaps you've never worn clothing such as this, but this hole is here for a reason. I certainly can't fit my legs through it so it must be for me to fit my penis through."
"I do. Very much so. Do you think you can come by tonight—I know it's late—but can you come pick up two prescriptions I wrote for him and drop them off at the chemist's? There's one on your way home that's open all night. I can pick them up tomorrow. I'll need to get some stuff from the shops anyway. I don't have much here for us to eat. You've spoiled me, always cooking."
Sherlock nods. "The head guard, Danilo, was behind it all. He hated Zivko, was jealous of him because he had a famous father—his famous father who, incidentally, ran a human trafficking ring--who had given Zivko the guard duty in that hellhole
Sherlock likes Rebecca and knows she returns those feelings, so he'll have at least two allies at the party. After another long look in the mirror, he decides he's about as ready as he's ever going to be. He grabs his phone, keys and wallet, and thunders down the stairs and out into the muggy summer evening. He hails a cab and gives out the address on the hand-written invitation.
, and says, "Hear, hear," and the two of them embrace tightly, smacking each other's backs, and holding on entirely too long for Sherlock's taste.
"Upstairs," Sherlock says, brows drawn tight, feeling like a child being fussed at for failing to do—whatever it is that children get punished for failing to do.
Gerald's arms wrap John up, and John leans into him, letting his own arms circle Gerald's waist. This isn't one of Cyril's
of love, whether from friends, family, or best friends. You said you've known he was attracted to you for three years, implying that he's been pining for you, but you also used the same language as a wronged partner—you said he was dating
More than anything, John wanted to give Sherlock his most authentic self, and not just because Sherlock could tell if he was hiding something. He wanted the kinship, the feeling of home that he had with Sherlock and that required truth and openness, no matter how hard it was to talk about certain things.
"Sorry," Sherlock mumbles, and tries to wrap himself back up, but his erection pokes out anyway, trying to communicate its love to John.
After the fight, Sherlock is exhausted, weary in a way he hasn't been since he first came back from Serbia. He feels shattered and too vulnerable, inhabiting a body that isn't his. He can't bear to look at John, to see the confusion and wariness in his eyes.
"We already do that," Sherlock said with an airy wave of his hand. John conceded that he wasn't wrong. "What's next?"
The something interesting involves his microscope. Only, he finds himself staring into the middle distance, unseeing, his mind on John and this party. It occurs to him, quite belatedly, that if he truly wants to show John that he's sorry—not, not that he's sorry. To show John how much Sherlock loves him,
John crouches in front of Sherlock and his hand strokes up and down Sherlock's thigh in a soothing motion. He doesn't realize he's doing it. "All right?" John asks.
"Also, once I put these stitches in, you're going to spend the next five to seven days having to talk without moving your mouth very much. Will that affect your work?"
) considering what happened last night. Was it even last night? Sherlock looks around the room and sees an alarm clock on the bedside table. It's 5:34 a.m.
"You can't, love," John murmured, though it made him inordinately sad to say so. "I'm absolutely knackered, so let me shower and grab something to eat. I don't want to leave you in here by yourself in case you get the idea you should be hatching while I'm sleeping. I guess I'll have to take you to bed with me." This last part he said mostly to himself.
With that, Sherlock turns, sways a bit in place, and then disappears back into the bedroom. Intrigued, John follows and finds Sherlock already spread out on the bed like a starfish. John slips into bed next to him, having to shove a few of Sherlock's limbs over to do it. As soon as he gets comfortable, Sherlock turns over onto his stomach and convulsively throws an arm and leg over John's body. Despite his willowy figure, Sherlock outweighs John by at least two stone, and John is convinced Sherlock has the ability to concentrate his weight into various limbs at will via some sort of Newtonian wave physics, as though he's made of a substance neither solid nor liquid rather than flesh and bone. John tries to get comfortable underneath the twenty feet of Sherlock's limbs currently pinning him to the bed.
John murmured another thank you and turned away, thinking he might dig out the scotch and have one or two (or a dozen) drams.
Then he does something Sherlock never expected, not even in his sweetest dreams. John takes Sherlock's hand, wraps it in both of his, and then brings it up to his lips and kisses the back of Sherlock's knuckles before gently letting go.
The nurse pokes her head out of the curtain and yells for an EKG and, just like that, the A&E explodes into action. Mrs. Gonzales finally gets John's full attention as he gets to work making sure she doesn't die from a heart attack.
At which point John realized he hadn't thought this out very well, as the soap was too high for him to reach, being tucked on the shelf above since John usually took a shower. He cursed under his breath. He was going to have to stand up and he knew the moment he did, Sherlock would pepper him with questions.
, John—the thing I care about most in the world. Not my reputation—I don't care what people think unless it keeps me from solving interesting puzzles. No, you see,
"However, I am not one atom less the man I was when I left you behind. In fact, I didn't think it possible to love and want you
It's four in the morning before John stops talking. He's utterly exhausted. Gerald's head is lying on John's chest and John is absentmindedly threading his fingers through Gerald's hair, his fingertips catching on tangles every now and again. The perfume of Gerald's hair is spicy and fruity; John wraps two fingers around a thick lock and brings it up to his nose to pull the scent in deeper.
Sherlock nods once and Blaine’s face breaks out into boyish delight. Sherlock can almost forget he runs a human trafficking ring.
even though all he wants to do is sink down onto the bed with Sherlock and sleep for about a hundred and fifty fucking years, because after the transition window, Sherlock becomes semi-catatonic, as though everything is reaching him through several layers of reality and really fucking bad wi-fi, and once he catalogues the correct response/reaction, he has to send it back, and John can become a
"Sherlock, do you want to—I mean, it's clearly determined to, um—it might help you relax if you want to go take care of that and then come back," John asks, his face flushing so beautifully pink.
Gerald is teasing but his eyes are dark with arousal. The idea of going home with him causes desire to uncurl deep inside John's belly.
" John shouted, startling Sherlock and Chatsworth both. Sherlock ducked his head, staring at the floor. John, feeling slightly ashamed for the volume of his outburst, continued nonetheless. "I cannot stay another night in this flat with you! You need to get out of here and go somewhere you won't be locked up in too little space with nothing to occupy you except finding new and mortifying ways of discussing penises!"
"Tell me what you want," Sherlock says, lowering his head to lick along the waistband of John's pants. "You can have anything you want from me."
With wide eyes, John asked Mycroft, "How long does it normally take for a dragon to hatch?" It pained him greatly to ask his next question. "What do I do?"
John showers, then cooks two chicken breasts on the stove, boils some linguini, and whips up some Alfredo sauce with peas, onions, olives, and mushrooms. He puts together a plate for Sherlock inside a sealable plastic container and puts it in the fridge. It'll heat up fine in the microwave. He eats in front of the TV and falls asleep on the sofa. His phone alarm wakes him up in the morning. Sherlock still isn't home. There's a text message on his phone, though.
For John, the next two weeks go by in a blur of heartache and furtive tears unleashed only in the shower or at the darkest part of the night into his pillow to muffle the sounds. Whenever he's at work, he can forget about breaking up with Gerald, but he never stops worrying about Sherlock being home alone.
"Oh," Sherlock says, sitting up straighter, pleased with himself, though there isn't a logical reason to be.
when there's literally billions of websites out there. Even if ninety-nine percent of them are garbage, that still leaves tens of thousands of pages. It'll be
, John, and you're tiptoeing around, afraid of triggering something terrible, and I'm tiptoeing around trying not to be demanding—"
Sherlock considers sending Gerald a bouquet of flowers, because no matter how jealous of the man he's been (and he has been
He pulls two clean towels out of the cabinet, one for Gerald to sit on (because his poor arse is probably stuck to the porcelain with sweat by now) and one to lay in his lap to catch everything.
"You want to hear me out or do you want to go to hospital? I work at the Royal London, I can have you admitted."
"Anyway, I'm sick of being stuck with Bernie—who, need I remind you, I've known my whole life—and Olivia, especially now they've got bloody Milton to pay attention to."
John walks two blocks before he realizes he's going the opposite way from the tube station. His body feels too heavy, his limbs leaden. He wants to sit down on the sidewalk and cry the way children do—heaving and sobbing, dripping mucus and tears—because it's the kind of crying that wipes a person clean, and John feels
John begins to list all the things that are wrong with Sherlock, so Sherlock puts up a hand to stop him.
"Don't get into the habit of answering out loud when he's talking through the bond. You'll still have the telepathic ability even when he's human, and it looks odd if others can't hear half of the conversation you're having. Another bad habit is to spend too much time conversing telepathically. It also looks odd when out around other humans. We have to do our best not to pique curiosity in unknowing humans. So, really, these things help protect us from exposure."
and what it means for himself as a man. It drives Sherlock into despair sometimes that John's still not
Before he faked his death, before Serbia, Sherlock could act as well as anyone in Hollywood. Fitting in at this party would be a breeze—he wouldn't mean it, but it would've been easy to feign. But the last two years have changed him. In so many ways, he's more raw than he used to be. His polish has been stripped away to reveal the naked, rough-hewn wood beneath.
"I believe my brother would benefit from the help of a therapist, but he's stubbornly refusing. He listens to you."
arse?" Sherlock asks solemnly, and John can't help another wheezing laugh, so Sherlock slaps John's knee, and leans down, and says in his darkest purr, "Maybe, instead of fucking you, I'll try all these out on you, and then I'll shove this plug up your arse, and make you wear it for the rest of the day, and tonight, and tomorrow all through work so that while you're saving lives, or stitching people up, or chatting with your co-workers, you'll know that I'm waiting here for you, and when you come home, I'll bend you over my chair, pull it out, and fuck you."
This brings a bright smile to Gerald's face, the same devastating smile that once stole John's heart. It affects him still but the ache it conjures has receded. Gerald pats him on the shoulder and then turns him towards the door to the house. "Let's go inside and fawn all over Milton so Olly and Bernie can preen."
"Oh! Right! Right. Well—" John looked up at Chatsworth's amused brown eyes and gestured over his shoulder. "I've got a tired and cranky hatchling to see to."
Gerald flinches at the words and he closes his eyes for a few seconds. When he opens them, his eyes glitter with tears, but his body language has subtly shifted, and he looks ready—eager even—to fight.
