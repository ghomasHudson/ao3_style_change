need to breathe, but he swore Watson was sustaining him, breathing for him. Watson was the air in his lungs and the blood in his veins.
"You wouldn't dare!" Holmes snarled, ready to lunge at his brother.
Holmes exhaled grey smoke, watched as it dissipated into the air. "Logic, brother. After evading all notice for fifty years, you think he would
"This isn't your will!" Mycroft barked, and Watson's grip on his shoulder tightened.
. Your sire is unknown; you have no children, no thralls. You live as a mortal and do not kill when you feed. You are invisible to them, Watson; a ghost, a fantasmic rumor.  You surface only to kill them, then disappear into the city once more. And if you have killed every vampire who discovered you, how could your identity be uncovered?”
“It is very vivid,” Watson said admiringly. Most people had minds that were hazy and imprecise, thoughts like flittering clouds which came together and drifted apart with no real coherence beyond their immediate focus. Other times they appeared to him as long hallways that gradually trailed into the dark oblivion of forgetfulness. Holmes on the other hand...Watson had never encountered a mind so meticulously visualized; some of the shelves had
“I know what he has told you, but the word of a vampire is worth less than nothing. They lie as easily as they kill.”
“Have you ever taken on a foe so powerful before?” Watson challenged, and Mycroft looked at him as if examining a particularly grotesque insect.
The inner door opened and Mycroft came striding out, Sturgerson in tow. “We have matters to discuss,” he said promptly, and Holmes glanced over lazily.
“I know." Then, perhaps eager to change the subject, Holmes told him of Mycroft’s ultimatum, the meeting that was to take place at the Diogenes. “I fear we must accept my brother’s invitation," he finished,  "and yet...” he let the sentence hang, fatally distracted.
His eyes wandered to the side of the bed Stamford had always claimed as his own, but the poison had been drained from those memories; they were now more sweet than bitter.
Mycroft held a glass out to him. “You should have a drink,” he advised, and the strangeness of Mycroft of all people encouraging him to partake any sort of medicament – even on as mundane as alcohol – made him reach for the glass.
be achieved.”
“I’m Diogenes. I would not be here if the thought of vampires terrified me. But while we are taught all vampires are murderous, I believe that is because we only follow the bodies. If one could feed without killing, as you seem to  have done, that would make them nearly invisible to our agents. I have long believed we had not met with any ‘good’ vampires simply because we have no way of detecting them.” His smile grew wider, “I finally have proof such theory is more than wishful thinking.”
Holmes had the soul of a scientist and an analytical mind to match, and thus naturally devised many interesting and morally questionable experiments he might run on the vampire while it slept...but he would not. He had given his word that Watson would be safe here, and he had no wish to make himself a bigger liar than he already was.
The smile shifted, became full of broken edges. “You must not have known him. Kramer was always saying odd things; he was an odd fellow.”
“Weren’t you?” Holmes asked, words pointed enough to cut and Watson felt the floor drop away from under him.
"I suppose not. Do you really think he can help?" He tried to imagine how Mycroft - another mortal, with all the same weaknesses - might offer true assistance.
The man’s eyes met his with a crack, telegraphing shock for the span of a heartbeat, hand flexing towards his breast pocket before he mastered himself, curling his fingers into a fist and forcing his hand back to his side. He looked away, frustration in the line of his shoulders, the irascible set of his jaw. “Kramer believed in a lot of things.”
"Has anything been touched?"
beat, albeit slowly. He had to feed- although rarely- and from an extremely selective diet. What Holmes observed spoke toward natural predator behaviors, though acutely augmented. Speed, strength, attractiveness. Did not a number of predators lure their prey in with bright colors, sweet smells and deadly promises? It was not so different.
“I don’t know why I bother to be surprised anymore,” Watson sighed, “though the last part is no mystery. You already know I do not kill when I feed.”
"You had just seen me. Ergo, I assume you have urgent news." Holmes peered at him expectantly, and Watson's discomfort grew.
He would need to remedy that, but it could not be done today.
John Watson had the most extraordinarily inconvenient sleeping schedule.
to help him at all, he had.
"What have you found?" the inspector asked, hovering. "How the devil did he get up there?"
"Your mind is... incredibly organized but so chaotically in motion,” Watson observed aloud.
It was those walls that held his interest.
Holmes watched him carefully. Presently he said, “Your presence in my mind brought a certain amount of clarity I had been lacking. I was suddenly struck with how different we were, how strange it felt to encounter the presence of another where I had only ever felt myself. And suddenly I felt certain that I
"I will," Watson promised, his heart swearing the oath as fervently as a knight on bended knee. "I won't let harm befall you."
It was a simple beauty, and all the petty evils of the world seemed small and far away.
Watson nodded, persistent wrinkle at his brow marring the preternatural smoothness of his face. But he obediently fetched up the tired-looking journal and set it down in Holmes' lap.
"I'll need to examine the body before it's moved."
But then again, what was Holmes if not passionate? So far as Watson had observed, he did nothing by halves. Whatever held his attention held it completely, whether it was crime or science or the violin, and he pursued each interest with a single-minded obsessiveness that bordered on zealotry.
The vicar blinked, taken aback. "I am sorry Mister Holmes, I don't believe I follow you."
"One learns to cope, when there is no alternative." He didn’t ask Watson to prove his claim; he had
Watson didn’t technically
It was almost comical that the one friend he had managed to make in a century was a vampire slayer. A drama that featured a near Shakespearean level deceit and hidden identities at play. And it only worked, he supposed, because Watson did not make a habit of reading the minds of the humans around him -- and in Stamford’s case, making the conscious decision not to.
Holmes set the papers down, looked up at his brother with a placid expression. “We already know a threat is lurking; we can take this as evidence vampires of a less congenial variety have finally arrived in the city. You’ve obviously informants among the Yard," he nodded meaningfully to the report, "what do they tell you?”
For a moment, it wasn’t Watson he saw.
But his best laid plans had not taken into account a body weakened for want of blood, and the morning passed with him slumped in his reading chair in a heavy doze. By the time he woke properly it was half ten, and he cursed aloud as he dove for his makeup kit in a mad scramble. To sleep half the morning away while on a case in which time was of the essence was insupportable, and he berated himself soundly as he made his way through the borough to Montressor’s shop on Dorsett street.
"He seems to care for you, in his way,” Watson commented and the banal sentiment of the statement grated on Holmes’ already delicate nerves.  Of course Mycroft cared for him. Such an obvious, useless observation...and yet he found himself not as bothered by it as he might have been. There was probably a reason for that but Holmes was not feeling up to the task of self-reflection at the moment.
It was not the first time Holmes wished he'd never met Watson, but it was possibly the most fervent. Bad choices. Bad choices were all he'd been handed since the man walked through his door. He should have followed his first instinct and had nothing to do with him ever again, though of course that would have been impossible once Langley's body appeared on the church roof. Why had Watson not simply disposed of the corpse? Oh right, he'd wanted to send a 'message'. Well, he had. One the entire damn city had heard and Holmes has been struggling to cover for him ever since.
Watson was still blinking at him dumbly when Holmes gave a sudden hiss, face contorting in pain and Watson reached for him without thinking. Of course he did. He had done nothing but reach for Holmes since the two of them first met. It was entrenched now, an automatic response.
"As you wish.” The doctor left and a bit later a nurse came by with the requested items, handing them over with a questioning look.
, he thought dizzily. The apex predator, the ultimate beast of prey. It wouldn't waste energy on the hunt, wouldn't expend itself in pursuit and physical submission. It would Compel its prey to offer itself willingly; to hold still while it drained the life away. He let his eyes fall shut, head lolling to the side as he panted. He could feel the blood leaving his body but couldn’t find it within himself to care overmuch. His mind quieted, raging rivers of thought turning slow and red.
“You are going to tell me it was not him,” Mycroft predicted as he threw a sheaf of papers down in front of his brother. Holmes sat slouched in front of the fireplace like a broken scarecrow, pulling lazily from the pipe tucked into the corner of his mouth. He had been at the Diogenes five days now, and tedium had begun to sink into his bones. He gave the documents a cursory glance, then returned his gaze to the fireplace, saying,
"Atch, wool. Too bad. Still, you might be of some use. I need a piece of your shirt." Holmes spoke quickly, obsessive sort of mania in his voice.
Mycroft lit a cigar, sat back with it held between his fat fingers. “Vampires influence the minds of the humans they are in proximity to. The most obvious examples are those consciously done; thralling, Orders and other such instances of deliberate persuasion. But there are unintentional effects as well. Sudden mass hysteria, or an abrupt rash of violence. Look anywhere people’s passions have been suddenly and inexplicably stirred to the boiling point, one will usually find a vampire has made its lair nearby. Not everyone is susceptible to such compulsions, but among the weak-minded, a vampire's influence is unmistakable.  We have reports of such violence escalating in several cities this past week; it is usually a sign that a vampire galère is on the move.”
Watson walked over to it and pondered. “Yes, I think so. I have leverage the poor soul tied to it did not.” Besides, of the two of them he wasn’t newly turned and starving.
It was a natural consequence of feeding that Watson be given a glimpse into the minds of those he drank from. He did not know why this should be, but it was an immutable fact of his strange existence, and one he seemed powerless to prevent. How much of a glimpse he received appeared dependent on several factors, including how deeply he drank and the people themselves; some minds were simply more “open” to him than others, and some more vivid and rich with color and nuance.
"I was concerned for your well being," he said defensively. "What have you discovered at the church?"
Watson looked unhappy. “No, I suppose it would not. And it makes sense that Deighton would be an accomplice, though it saddens me as well. The Father Deighton I knew seemed a gentle sort of man. But you
Watson blinked in astonishment. "Amazing," he said, voice holding quiet wonder, "Lestrade should pay you up front."
Mycroft ignored him, stern face even more severe and inflexible than usual. “Congratulations, brother mine,” he snapped, “it seems your depravity knows no bounds.”
"And how does that turn out for the vampires, from the perspective of human morality?"
"Hmmm," Holmes replied, "and what was his trade?"
"Aye, sir!" the cabbie said, touching the brim of his hat as he took off at a near gallop.
Holmes’ Master, and had no desire to be so.
“So you were robbing the clergy house,” Newman finished, face and tone darkening as he glanced up the stairs once more.
“Regent’s canal-” Holmes answered instantly.
"Lucky for us. So, that much is taken care of. But there is still the church to deal with, and Father Newman. What are your plans there?" Watson set the paper down. The headline was from the day Kramer’s body was found.
He sent the missive on its way via his Irregulars, then went to wash.
"But you did not read his thoughts?" Holmes asked quickly, and Watson gave a self-depreciating laugh.
Lestrade suppressed a shudder, swallowing thickly. “Good Lord,” he said again, all other words seeming lost to him.
"But you knew my name," Watson pressed, "you could have given him that. And he would have believed you - he may not like you much but he trusts your judgement in these matters."
Observations: Window closed but unlocked, chair moved a half foot to the left. The papers on his desk had been bothered, and there were several investigative tools which had been handled and set down again. Nothing was missing, he had not been burgled. But someone had been looking through his things.
"Then heal me, that I may protect myself." He finished writing out the list with a flourish and handed it over. Watson plucked it from his outstretched hand and looked it over, glad for its extensiveness, and among the obvious items like 'murder' were less comprehensible ones, like 'eat a pear'. That one almost made him laugh. "May I ask you about any of these?"
"Thank you for doing this," she said to him quietly as they walked. "But surely easing my husband's fear is not part of being a detective?"
He walked their length bent over like a hunchback, eyes keen and hawklike as he examined the stonework. He stopped at a point midway, noting the telltale signs where the mortar had dried a different color, the faint scuffs on the floor in front of it, small drops of wax where a candle had been held alight.
is our primary concern."
It was gone the next instant, Watson’s hand snatched away as though Holmes' skin were made of pure silver. The doctor inhaled sharply, looking down at him in something like awe.
"Fire," Holmes said simply. "He dreamed of fire. I told him it was nothing, though he would awake some nights in a cold sweat. You say he was psychic. If that is true, then-” his eyes burned, because his infatuation with Watson has not completely erased his guilt, though it has made it far more bearable "-then he
But Watson shook his head. "I could smell her fear easily enough; she
Holmes did not go. He stood his ground instead. “No. You need to feed; you are useless to me like this.”
Holmes harrumphed at him, "You are a Detective Inspector of Scotland Yard, an officer of the court; you have the authority of the Crown behind you. The bishop has information vital to your case, and the vicar was his man. You've as much right to summon him as you would any criminal's employer."
“If we only knew where he had gone, our work might be easier.”
"Can you? That may be for the best," Holmes replied somewhat regrettably. He was not proud of this; indeed, he almost wished Watson could offer him the same surcease from memory. But Watson's secret needed to be protected, the church needed to be investigated and Montressor needed to face justice for murder. If he were charged with arson as well it would hardly make a difference to the noose around his neck.
Point in fact, he
Holmes ignored him in favor of pursing his own line of questioning. “Judging by your attire and schedule, you believe sunlight to be harmful to you, yes?"
“The scene of
“No, I
"May I ask you again to take my case?" He entreated, and this time there was no imperiousness, no cagey smirk, no cards hidden up his sleeve, waiting to be played. He was simply a man asking for help - asking for
For a long time Mycroft was silent, staring down at the cache of papers with a dark look on his face. Presently, he poured himself a dram of whiskey and then, looking at the papers again, made it a double.
Holmes squeezed his eyes shut, face tight and whitened with pain. Yes, Watson's blood had made it more bearable, but it must still hurt a good deal. "Oh, Watson- I think my leg is broken."
"He was, yes.”
An explosion of pain, dazzling and white, hot as starbursts. Then darkness swirled around his mind, creeping in at the edge of his vision as the seconds ticked by, his body thrumming in agony. Everything went dim, distorted and there was the coppery taste of blood in his mouth. By the time he regained his senses the dead man had been removed, and Holmes chained to the wall in his place.
“Cocaine,” Holmes answered, unashamed because he saw no benefit in guilt. His vices were his own; he refused to apologize for them.
"Sah!” he shouted breathlessly, face windswept and reddened from the cold, “Mister Holmes, sah! I seen th' vicar take someone in! T’was just as the bell were chimin’ six. I marked it, sah!”
"I haven't given him any order since we arrived, but I have heard
“Oh-ho,
Leaving the city will not be enough; you will be searched for in connection with Montressor's crime, and it will look all the more suspicious that you are gone. Furthermore, you are tied to the church for reasons I still have not yet divined. Your supposed death will be a boon for me in that investigation as well."
"But you have not been entirely forthcoming either," Holmes countered, and if he noticed the change in the atmosphere he did not comment on it. "A man who is distraught enough to seek out a detective in the middle of the night because he fears for his life is not simply following instinct. You are a man with a few enemies at least, you have admitted to that plainly enough and there may be many reasons one of them would have you followed; to presume murder you draw either on past experience or paranoia-" his eyes glanced over the stranger, head to toe "-and you are not a paranoid man," he finished definitely. "You have a reason to believe this man wants you dead, and it is that reason you are withholding from me.”
Holmes could feel Watson’s distress like a distant ache; he would not be able to
“I was saying, I have spent the day reading all I could find on the subject of thrall, and while I can account for my own condition easily enough, I cannot account for yours. Vampires are not supposed to share a thrall’s feeling of infatuation. Is it possible you made an error?"
"God is very, very real, Mister Holmes. As is hell. Did you spend the hours in contemplation?"
“What?”
"I know. You were dying - I just... did what I had to do. And now I have to get you out of here,” he said, preparing to take Holmes in his arms once more. Baker Street was both close and convenient, but what Holmes truly needed was a hospital.
“I don’t know why you never bothered to learn it,” Mycroft replied. “It is one of the easier European languages to master.”
Holmes leaned forward slightly, that the rasp of his voice could be better heard. "Once, when I was seven, I smuggled a milk snake into my room. When it escaped and was discovered I blamed the cat."
Mycroft clenched his jaw, cigar smashing between his teeth. "
"I dare not tell you anything," Mycroft said flatly. "Whatever information you possess will pass to him, and if you are here then he knows far too much already.
So many years ago now, the images called forth were muzzy and sepia-tinged with age. It had not been a park then, but sprawling farmland dotted here and there with copses - crown holdings belonging to King George. There were no green lawns, no broad avenues lined with manicured flower beds or sculpted fountains, no willow trees with their branches like fingers trailing in the water.
Hopefully Stamford would do better there than was done to him. On that point...
Watson pondered how Holmes considered his natural state to be overworked and overwhelmed with data like some kind of machine. He was a marvel - not just to look at, but to hear those racing surface thoughts.
"No, you are not Stamford," Holmes replied gruffly, one hand braced on the mantle as he stared at nothing at all. He considered what he wanted to say, and how to communicate it in as few words as possible. Talking right now seemed an unbearably heavy task. "Stamford was...a gentle soul. He made me a better man by his influence. You have made me a worse one."
"You are lucky Lestrade's men are on watch,” Holmes slurred at him, coming awake, “they would miss an elephant if it passed them in the street."
Mycroft heaved a great sigh and busied himself with a drink as Holmes watched him and Watson watched Holmes. Presently he began to speak; that low, thrumming baritone filling the space between them.
Watson pondered that. "The idea is... disquieting. Hard enough to imagine some curse has been placed upon me; to think a disease, an organism, an infection is living within me..." he shuddered.
"It does have limitations," Watson replied carefully, "what do you intend to change?"
Holmes' words had struck deeper than he’d likely intended. Watson had thought, perhaps, that out of all this he might find someone new to trust, another companion. After years of being on his own, Stamford’s simple friendship had been richer than diamonds, more welcome than blood. Watson had not realized how lonely he had been until he suddenly wasn’t anymore, and he had begun to hope at finding a similar comradery with Holmes. Instead he found a man who needed Stamford as badly as Watson had, too damaged and dark to survive in this world without Stamford’s shining light. And two damaged men could not hold one another up in the night.
Holmes shook his head. "You see the brush strokes, but you miss the larger picture.
"He poisoned your wife?" Holmes asked placidly. "Is she dead then?"
"I am aware of it. Save that I would attempt to intervene on his behalf, and possibly be injured myself."
Might as well make the most of the time they had.
He shrugged. "That depends on how much blood is taken. Usually I take only a few mouthfuls at a time, and thus must feed every few days. In Langley's case, I drank quite a bit more; his blood sustained me for several weeks."
"Of course not.”
A thin and cynical smile slit the corner of Holmes' mouth. "If she is dead there is no fear offending her delicate sensibilities," he replied brusquely.
Holmes could only shake his head, and repress a shudder. "Who was it that twisted that mind of yours so spectacularly? I wager you were not always so callous."
Holmes closed his eyes and pressed his face into the jut of Watson's shoulder, listening to the slow beat of a heart that's speed did not increase with physical exertion. He was no stranger to London’s rooftops, but he had never traversed them at this speed, covering nearly a quarter of the city in a matter of minutes. Ahead of them Big Ben loomed high above the houses of parliament, and Holmes thought with a childish sort of excitement that he would like to climb it.
He balked, chagrined. "Holmes- I am sorry. I didn't mean –”
Holmes nodded, "That is an excellent idea. Far better in our hands than the constabulary I think."
Not Watson.
Holmes sighed. “That is a far more complicated question than you realize. This case has many threads. Even woven together, I am not certain they contain the whole truth.”
“Your lies, Mister Holmes. You entered my church under false pretense, took advantage of my hospitality...and yet all that might be forgiven. But you are a man much burdened by evil, and the devil's touch, are you not? The sin of deception is a particularly dark stain upon the soul, for how can Christ’s love reach a deceitful heart?”
In answer to Holmes questioning gaze he stood and moved to the far corner of the room, cold wall at his back. He closed his eyes, waited until the footsteps had nearly reached the door, then released his Will.
"Why else would the sire have stooped to espionage? You said yourself your kind prefers outright warfare when settling disputes among themselves, and you are the Prince of London, Watson, whether you intended it or not. You have held the city for fifty years by right of blood and conquest and your claim stands. But rather than issue a formal challenge, or attack the city directly this one lurks in the shadows, blackmailing priests to join his network of spies and sending out thralls to scour the streets in search of you."
He waited until morning Mass had started, when he knew Deighton would be busy with his sermons. Holmes was a skilled fighter but saw no benefit in taking on two men by himself if there was no need for it. He then he lingered at the corner of the house, watching for the cleaning girl to come out back with the morning wash and slipping through the door behind her. He would have between fifteen and twenty minutes before she finished hanging the laundry and shaking out the rugs.
"And to think this is reportedly the finest hospital in London. All the more reason to spirit me away to Baker Street.”
“What do you mean?”
...well. Watson would likely already be dead.
"You're up early," Mrs. Hudson said, looking him over with a critical eye, thin face pinched into a frown. "Or did you not sleep at all?"
“So Kramer
"My mind is no worse than it ever was. If you did not trouble yourself over it before there is no reason to begin."
Holmes continued as if he hadn’t heard. “I am given to understand lovers often keep secrets from one another; I have seen it many times in my work. Why, there was once a young woman from Norbury who kept a secret child from her husband-”
Holmes thought suddenly, and the rivers of logic running through his brain were momentarily routed by images of crystal-clear lakes and ice shelves along the arctic sea and other such fanciful nonsense. A product of the morphine, surely. He missed the question. “Hmmm?”
“What can you tell me of him?” Holmes asked, and the man hiked an eyebrow at the boldness of the question, Holmes’ lack of concern for propriety or guile.
“No,” he replied, voice brooking no argument. “If you can master yourself enough to feed without killing, then do so. Drink until you are at least sensible enough to follow basic instructions. There is work to be done tonight and you will be of no use if the only thing you can focus upon is blood.”
“Best not to risk it, then,” Watson said. “We shall have to work with what we have.”
"I should like to examine the church next," said Holmes, and on it went. He was shown to all the public places he asked to see; it was only when he requested a tour of the clergy house itself he met his first resistance.
The straps would not tear no matter how he pulled at them. “I can’t- the leather won’t budge,” he admitted at last. “It must be something to do with the writing on them. A protective spell of some sort. I can’t touch the silver either, I’m sorry.”
“He was influenced,” Holmes agreed, “But not by Watson.”
the man's presence in his mind. It had been decidedly uncomfortable, but fortunately Holmes had always had a rather high tolerance for such things as pain and discomfort. "Is that where the legend of the minion familiar comes from?" he asked. "The mindless, loyal servant of the cursed? Can your kind dominate human minds so thoroughly they become little more than slavish vassals?"
"Get a full night's sleep," Watson urged. "I will end my employment with the Yard tonight, and procure a body. I assume it is best to get this done sooner rather than later."
Mycroft shook his head. “I am only disappointed it took you so long to see it.”
“You murdered him before he could confess to anything. Makes his damnation rather your fault doesn't it?”
“If you can manage them so handily, I wonder why you bothered asking for my help. What have you to fear from the constabulary if you can simply Order them away?”
His eyes sparked a bit. Yes, he had been crushed by Stamford's death, and the guilt that came packaged with it haunted his every waking moment. But he had promised to live, and to work, and to soldier on. And he was still Sherlock Holmes. "Where is it?"
"It is not close to, but as you wish a list of things I would not do, eating pears must be on it somewhere. I see no reason to invite unpleasantness by being vague."
"No, we were quite alone. He was agitated, angry even. He told me he knew what I was...I admit I didn't understand at first. But he kept on, saying I was evil and would lead the congregation astray. That I should burn in hellfire- that was pleasant."
Holmes sighed and detached himself from the doctor. "It is time to part ways," he said, still feeling drunk from Watson's proximity.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Damn. It's been too long – get the chair,” Newman ordered, “we'll have to take him up. If only the other one hadn't died so soon.”
upon our first meeting? He must have known what I was.”
“Surely your sins weigh heavily on your soul.” Deighton said, and Holmes couldn’t stop the breathless puff of air that escaped his lips in lieu of a laugh.
“He threatened me, shot at me with silver bullets in his gun. I killed him in self-defense and left his body as a message and warning for the priest Newman.”
Holmes grinned, because Mycroft was only telling the truth, which is all they'd ever done between themselves. Nor did Holmes take any offense to the statement; that Mycroft deigned to come at all, however grudgingly said more than words ever could and they both knew it. "You are a treasure beyond price, brother mine."
But he could at least make him aware of the danger. "He has likely been planning this for some time. If so, we shall have a full-on war upon us."
A simple room, a barren room and even now his mind worked to a minimal degree. He understood it was not a room at all but a cage, a prison and the prisoner lay tied to a stout metal bed, lashed by thick leather bonds inscribed with strange symbols and ending in a pair of silver cuffs closed tight around two bone white wrists.
Despite having some knowledge as to the strength of Holmes’ mind, Waston had no real idea what to expect. Some people took more naturally to the art than others, particularly those with latent psychic abilities of their own. He didn’t know if Holmes was such a man; he had not been in his head long enough to find out.
And then, too late, Watson realized the danger; the direction all those innocuous questions about thralls had been pointing. “Holmes, no!” he chastised. “You do not understand what you are asking! A thrall is a cruel thing to do to a man. You- you would have no free will; if I even suggested that perhaps you should or should not do something, you would consider my opinion as superior to your own. My will would supersede yours in all things...that would be terrible!”
“I felt you,” Watson replied, “Just now. Distant, but unmistakable.”
, they will come for you. And if they cannot find you, then they will come for me. Me and whatever information about you I have."
“He was traveling back to the sire for more blood,” Watson surmised. “I may have been wrong to kill him, you know. If his Master felt one tenth for him what I do for you, he will want to disembowel me personally.”
“If you are the only vampire in London, then you are de-facto Prince; it is one of the few laws that govern your savage kind.
The nurse led the way to Holmes’ room and Mycroft followed, walking stick held out before him like a weapon, though it was hardly necessary. He had about him an aura of unapproachable severity that seemed to hold the entire world at bay, people moving out of his path to avoid him, like Moses parting the seas. He did nothing to prevent it.
Holmes' silent gaze held nothing but contempt.
"Yes, I will," he promised. He kissed Holmes once more, trailing his fingers down the length of his spine.
The words barely had any air behind them, but they echoed through Holmes’ bones and he obeyed instantly, because he couldn’t
"I think that would be an extremely unwise idea," Holmes said, accepting the cup. "And I am certain I have strength enough to find my way to a carriage."
“Holmes-”
kill it, if for no other reason than Watson had not wanted to answer that particular question when it was posed to him.
Holmes brushed past him into the foyer and turned, a gracefully fluid movement that brushed their shoulders together. "You need to hire me," he said without preamble.
"Indeed. I understand Blevins had only recently found work with the church;  if it is not too bold, might I inquire as to the nature of his duties?"
Holmes watched the man fluster and spit. When he spoke it was with the self-possessed tones of a man who knew his own mind absolutely. "I will do what I can to uncover the truth of this business, but it may take time. How long, I cannot say."
Watson shook his head. "Not outright, no. He said he knew what I was and then called me a 'tool of the devil' along with a good many other colorful epithets. Father Newman is quite well respected among the congregation and I didn't want trouble from the vicar or anyone else, so I left. A few days later, Langley began following me. Discreetly at first, but with more boldness as the days passed. You know how that story ends."
"Do you require physical contact?"
“Only if you kill them. A man under the command of a thrall will not stop. Not until he accomplishes his goal, or the thrall fades.”
- is going to believe in vampires any more than you did at first?" To be truthful, Watson was not at all keen on the idea of bringing another mortal into the fold. Certainly not one who worked in parliament. It could bring a host of problems to Watson's door...but if Holmes was correct about all of this, he had a host of problems on his doorstep already.
"I- I don't know. Though I have often wondered."
"It's alright!” he reassured quickly, “not enough to thrall or turn you, I wouldn’t allow that. But a little blood can heal minor wounds, prevent infection in larger ones, you will be perfectly well, I promise..." He was rambling, trying to both reassure and relay all important information at once.
"I know what you meant," Holmes replied, surprisingly not unkindly. "However, I am- I find myself unable to contemplate Stamford's life without pain, nor his death without guilt. Neither of those things are your fault.”
with you inside your skin. Were we to take a purely theological point of view we would call it possession, but I do not see why it must be attributed to an affliction of the soul. It is clearly a physical thing."
“Les’rade..” he mumbled, and the inspector bent down, ear next to his mouth.
Lestrade bristled like a bulldog, shoulders hunching up beneath his uniform. “The man’s only just started, it’s hard enough finding a competent sawbones willing to work the night shift for Yard pay; I’m not about to let you barge in and scare him off without a damn good reason. What it is you think he can tell you that you can’t get lookin’ at the body?”
Mycroft shook his head. "He must be. These creatures
Lestrade exhaled, much aggrieved. "Any hints that might help out with that? Strangers die in alleyways every day."
"Exactly." Holmes said, spreading his open hands. "You are in no danger of being addled; the doctor's parlor tricks have no power over you."
The lights were on in the surgery once again, and the good doctor opened the door just as Holmes reached the top step. Holmes thought to himself
Holmes sat back in quiet dismay. Three hundred years. He thought again of that black serpent crest, the intricacies of the mind behind it; all those subtle manipulations that had born out over months - years - of planning. And a vampire only grew stronger with age...
"And here I thought the point of the New Covenant was that no more blood would be spilled in his name,” Holmes countered, “And I rather think the diocese would agree with me."
"You're here much earlier than you predicted," he noted.
“What then can we do then?” Watson asked, despairing.  “I am no match for a vampire three times my age.”
"Just a few more minutes dear boy...nearly finished." It was said idly and without thought, likely because Holmes really was that tired, that engrossed in his experiment.
"Clarky!" he cried jovially, knowing it was a nickname Clark particularly disliked, and upon learning such had refused thereafter to call him anything else. "Do come in. I assume you have the letters?"
“What? Of that creature? What makes you think so?”
They walked arm in arm to the front doors of the Diogenes, where a man stood watching them approach. It was no one Holmes recognized, but the fellow clearly knew him, and his eyes widened as he caught sight of Watson’s pale figure. Holmes strode forward, placing himself slightly in front of the doctor. “I am here to see my brother,” he announced, “we are expected. And may I introduce my good friend, Doctor Watson."
"Shh, it's alright now," Watson said soothingly, rushing back to Holmes' side. He got a careful grip on the man and lifted him into his arms.
"I was reflecting on how much consternation you must be causing other vampires by your mere existence."
He had left Watson’s practice in the quiet hour before sunrise, arriving at Saint Cyperian’s in the steel grey light of pre-dawn. His Irregulars, that rag-tag group of street urchins he employed time to time as errand runners had been keeping watch on the church day and night, but they had nothing noteworthy to report. No beggard had yet replaced Mister Blevins as the intended target and so Holmes was obliged to wait; he could not go to the Yard with nothing more than his word that something nefarious was happening. Even if he were believed, it would take more than a sick parrot and a room scrubbed clean of blood to secure a warrant. The church wielded too much power and influence and the homeless, not nearly enough. Thus if he was to catch Newman it must be (quite literally) red-handed.
He had been devilishly difficult to get a read on that first night they met, despite the fact the detective’s mind had been more open than most. It had not been at all hard for Watson to sense him – point in fact he’d had a hard time sensing anything else – but there had been so damn
," He thundered, standing abruptly. "You will
Holmes did not feel like guiding the doctor to gentle understanding. His mind was hurtling swift down those fast-flowing currents of logic and he needed Watson to keep up.  "Why would you think it unlikely, when you have just revealed to me that vampires so enjoy controlling the power dynamics of human society? It should have been your very first suspicion." And it would have been Holmes' too, if he'd known then what he knew now.
“I’m not,” Holmes assured him, and the stranger paused at that, gaze going narrow and intense. Then he shrugged, examining his fingernails with practiced nonchalance.
Before beginning his research, Holmes made certain to wear gloves.
"In this area? That is concerning if true," the vicar said. "Aside from the church itself, the homeless do not often gather in this neighborhood. We do what we can for them, but..." his voice trailed off.
“He was only hired two nights ago,” the inspector said defensively and Holmes' amusement grew, some inimical mirth winding it's way through his dark eyes.
Holmes stowed the ring once more beneath his shirt, next to his heart. "He knew the risks inherent in our work; we both did. We each of us escaped death more times than providence should allow. He made me swear to him if he died - however it happened - that I would continue without him. Both my life and my work. I agreed, because it meant a great deal to him that I should.”
Watson was at something of a loss. But it was Holmes, so no great upset there. “But- no. No, I remember. I said, ‘best not risk it’. That- that could be misconstrued-”
Holmes picked up the first volume, flipping through it in an offhand way and Mycroft fixed him with a pointed stare.  “Be
Mycroft shook his head. “Foolish,” he intoned, and Watson felt a spur of anger on Holmes’ behalf.
The next few days at the church passed in an eerie sort of calm for the detective, akin to being suspended in the center of a vortex while all around him raged an unseen storm. Parishioners hurried by him without greeting, curates whispered to each other as he passed and Father Newman avoided him completely, removing himself from Holmes' proximity whenever they happened to meet, his mouth shriveled up like a raisin.
Another body hit the floor.
Holmes covered a smile, asked, “Have we any books on the ancestral clans of Ireland?”
"It is far better than either or both combined," Holmes said with certainty. "And I
Holmes' lips slid open and he leaned unconsciously forward, his skin feverish beneath Watson’s cold hand, Watson’s blood in his body making him literally burn with desire; with
“You think I would defile a book?” Holmes asked, sounding deeply wronged.
Holmes hadn’t said much of anything at all, sitting there watching Watson with his dark eyes aglitter, smug shape to his mouth that suggested he knew something Watson didn’t. Watson couldn’t bear it when Holmes’ looked smug, wanting to both punch and kiss the look from his face with equal fervor. Unable to do either, he vented instead.
“I am saying the man who killed Langley and the man who murdered this fellow are not the same.” He watched as two ash-faced constables trudged by, bloodless body carried between them, covered with sackcloth. Away a pace the young constable from the alley stood leaning heavily against the mariah, a sheen of sweat adorning his brow like a benediction. “Who is the coroner on shift tonight?” Holmes asked.
Watson kissed him back in passionate agreement. "The hours expand when you need them to shrink," he muttered between kisses, threading his fingers through Holmes' hair.
trigger warnings: blood, graphic violence
"I had never given it much thought before," he admitted, slowly turning the idea over in his mind.  It made a good deal of sense, now Holmes had pointed it out. He glanced over and found the detective silently laughing at him, some dark amusement flitting it way through his eyes. "What is it?"
Deighton was waiting for him.
"Can’t say," he replied, “They were in the fireplace; there isn’t much left of them."
"You didn't think it was relevant to tell me you had a maelstrom of supernatural forces ready to converge on you before drawing me into your troubles?" Holmes snapped, and Watson looked stunned, mouth working like a banked fish.
"Hmmm." Holmes considered that, watching the trees as the wind swept through their branches. Watson regarded him in silence for a long moment, wondering what the man was thinking about in that turbulent whitewater of a mind Watson had only glimpsed.
you. Nor will I fault him for it; it is far more Herculean a task than fighting vampires.”
"I should expect such dishonesty from you," Lestrade growled, skin flushing deep crimson. "Go on, get out of here."
Holmes had encountered many bodies in his line of work. After the first time seeing a man with his limbs stiffened in rigor mortis, the light utterly extinguished from his eyes, one never again made the mistake of confusing a living body for a dead one. The most lauded actor in England could not replicate the vacant, glass-eyed stare of a body severed from its soul.
Mrs. Hudson only huffed at him, unimpressed. "I do not serve tea to vagabonds, Mister Holmes, and I certainly do not rent them rooms. Go wash, or there will be no tea."
. They had barely known each other a month but already Watson was beginning to recognize the detective’s distinctive brand of frenetic chaos.
He was drug with excruciating carelessness into the chair and wheeled to the stairs, where several long boards had been laid down to make a crude sort of ramp. Together they tugged and pulled him up the steps, ceiling passing over him in a sickening blur of light and shadow, and then the feeling of being lifted again, going up again...up the staircase in main hall to the rooms above. A door unlocked and he was pushed inside.
"There was a plan," Holmes conceded, "and it worked. I admit I should have liked it to work a little faster, but I am alive and that was the main objective."
"Aye, did ye know 'im?"
The man took a seat, clasped hands resting on his knees. "I believe a man has been set in place to kill me," he said calmly.
Jackson, for his part, seemed finished as well. He donned his hat and gloves, and spoke only after reaching the front door.
“Do you regret it?”
“However,” Mycroft continued, “While the face of the Diogenes as a gentlemen’s club is a recent development, it has existed as a slayer’s coven for time immemorial, and it has kept careful records of all vampiric activity in London and its surrounding cities for well over a century. I will consult these records today and confirm the doctor’s claims. If it is true that he has kept the city free of their influence for the past fifty years, it will be noted. If proven right, I will need to speak with him. We shall need to formulate a plan."
"It has never stopped me before," he said lazily, searching about for his hat.
"My usual clothes," he said with amusement, wondering where Holmes was going with such odd questioning. "A grey suit."
Holmes gave a long suffering sigh. "I will stay an hour if you will stop badgering me," he grumped in reply.
a murderer. "I am sorry," he told her with genuine feeling. "It is as I said, someone was after him...or he was after someone."
“Thank you, brother.”
“If there is some way I can help, let me." He hated admitting it, but he
, Lestrade? I need to speak to him about the corpse!”
Watson glanced at him over Mycroft’s shoulder, and the hard line of his body softened. He eased back into the chair, composing himself.
And so it went, that great catalog of information spooling out. Holmes was right; it had taken only the slightest pressure and, far from concealing his thoughts, Watson now possessed more knowledge about ash trees than he would ever need.
“He has been here fifty years,” Holmes reminded him, “long before either of us were born. If he wished to take London, it would have been done before now.”
He turned the body to its front, pulled the man’s collar aside. Just above the collarbone two ragged holes stood out against the bone white column of his neck, the shirt beneath dyed half red. Like Langley, the man had been drained, but the blood that might have been drunk instead painted the walls and ground.
"I apologize for my husband," she said softly, "he has been under a great strain."
"That is... quite a long list of illegal activities," he remarked, unable to decide if he should be impressed by Holmes' reckless ingenuity or concerned, and settled somewhere in between the two. "I thought you were a man of the law. Why are you doing this?"
“I am honored to be among their number,” Watson said, and Holmes peered at him with a disconcerting  gaze.
"I admit I was in error," he said, and Holmes let it go. He was not here for sport.
"You took evidence from the body?" Watson asked, more amused than disquieted. "Does Lestrade know about that?"
Holmes took an unhurried sip of liquor, examined Watson over the rim of his glass. “Did it not occur to you, my dear Watson, that I had a very good reason for acting as I did?”
Holmes blinked, caught only slightly off-guard. “I recall reading that Montressor had confessed to that particular murder.”
Watson found a vein, slid the needle home and there was another pinprick in his arm, one more hole in the collection of old friends that had born witness to so many of his darkest moods.
Watson laid a cold hand on the back of his neck, and kissed the top of his head. "I will see you tonight," he promised, then let go of him entirely.
Holmes eyed his brother suspiciously, but Mycroft was one of the few men he had difficulty reading. “You are up to something,” he said with certainty, for that much was obvious.
But that hardly made a difference to Holmes; fools constantly spoke as if the nonsense they spouted were immutable truths.
"Oh, you murder in someone else's name. How enlightening."
“We were experimenting as per your suggestion,” he said warmly, but Mycroft only turned his cool gaze towards him with an air of disdainful apathy.
Newman barely had time to look up, had not even fully registered Watson’s presence in the room before Watson had him by the neck and in one quick movement dashed his brains against the floor. Then he turned his wrathful gaze to the vicar.
Holmes ran his hand over his chin and addressed the rafters as he spoke, "I told him as much of the truth as he would believe; that the killer was blond man, ex-military, abnormally strong, and whom the victim certainly believed to be a vampire."
city, and do not suffer other vampires to kill indiscriminately within its borders."
The door clicked shut behind him and Jackson led them into a comfortable exam room with a low bed, a desk and two agreeable looking chairs.
"You are in pain," he observed, already moving toward the brandy decanter. "Did they give you any morphine?"
“I don’t see the harm, and after all, it is something to do.  Besides, as Mycroft says, we may learn something of value.”
“I know,” Holmes replied, and a quirk of the doctor’s eyebrow was all that gave away his surprise.
Watson nodded, taking his leave and Holmes watched until the very last moment, until he was through the window and gone, silent as he slipped over the rooftops while dawn brightened the sky.
Lestrade's face pinched into a faint scowl.  "He's a rather difficult person to reach," he grumbled. "I had a telegram sent but have had no answer thus far."
After a breathless moment or five Holmes had spent exploring Watson's lips with his own he dropped his head onto Watson's shoulder, hopelessly overcome. "I love you," he murmured, and Watson’s arms tightened around him possessively.
“Why didn’t you tell me vampires turn to ash when they die?”
"Holmes is not yours to order about like a puppet!" he retorted hotly. The two stared at each other, dangerously close to violence as a familiar, preternatural cold began to permeate the room.
“I do not make a habit of reading anyone’s thoughts. It is a- an imposition.”
"I love you," he whispered again, his whole heart in the word.
Other things however seemed to hold a kernel of truth: aversion to light and silver, unnatural strength, the need to drink blood. He suspected driving a wooden stake through one’s heart
Montressor's street was quiet and dark, a welcome change after the bonfire frenzy of Cavendish. Holmes had stayed only long enough to make certain the fire was under control and the nearest families out of danger.
Once alone Holmes’ face crumpled in agony and he leaned his head against the back of settee, closing his eyes against the onslaught. His body screamed at him in an eloquent symphony of pain and he momentarily cursed his brother for setting him down so far away from the morphine bottle in his desk. A calculated move on Mycroft's part, no doubt.
"That's a wonderful idea," Watson said happily, no doubt eager to encourage Holmes to spend his time in well lit, public places where the threat of danger was minimal, and not sneaking into churches and skulking about alleyways where known murders lurked in the shadows.
He knew better now.
Watson’s brow raised in mild surprise. “Should I?”
he thought, and suddenly Watson was inundated.
one of our parishioners was causing a bit of trouble among the congregation. There were, I believe, allegations made of adultery between this man and another's wife."
“All right now, think of another object...but this time when you feel me start to push, push back. Try to keep that one thought away.”
Holmes looked up, a jeweler's lope screwed into his eye for reasons Watson could not fathom. It made him look distorted, a giant automaton come to life. He glanced at the clock. "Hmmm, yes...you may have a point. Very well, I'll to bed in a moment." Then he bent over his work once more.
"Sin hurts," the vicar agreed.
“And how did he succeed?”
"And would this plan involve driving a stake through his heart? I know you think me stripped of my reason and his death the only recourse, though I was told the effects of the thrall would fade within a week or two."
"All things considered you must agree the title is a fitting one," Holmes remarked, taking a long drink of the doctor's ale.
Watson looked disquieted, shifting about in his chair like a schoolboy. "To know anything more specific I would have to delve deeper into your mind - but it is very invasive."
Holmes marked that, continuing with his soft investigation and innocent questions and allowed himself to appear satisfied by the answers given. Finally, they were back at the beginning, Holmes standing in the chapel with Father Deighton as the priest listened to him talk with a grave expression.
He reflected on the fact that if he had to be caught, this was not the worst thing that could happen. There was a time limit on how long he would be here; he need only endure until nightfall. Any hours between now and then spent alone in the darkness and not in their immediate clutches was all the better for him.
“Yes,” Newman replied reluctantly. “He handed them over as soon as he was confronted. He - hadn’t been there long.”
"I believe you can learn something from him... you learned quite a bit from me our first night."
If he did not know better, he would have pronounced the man dead without hesitation.
“A startling coincidence then, I’m sure.”
feed from him!"
"Ah," the girl said, eager to be of use. "We've both those over 'ere." She led him to an area with a small variety of herbs used for both medicinal purposes and the practice of magic. Next to the herbs were a few books on occult spells and practices, kitchen witchery and other such flimflam. Holmes had already read most of them during his period of study and found them to be filled with nonsense. Whatever magic existed in the world, it would not be found there.
The priest shrugged. "It is no secret; he tended to Father Deighton’s birds. I can show you, if you like. Would you walk with me?" he asked, gesturing in the direction of the clergy house and Holmes nodded amicably.
"You have told me what you believe, and I do not doubt it is the truth as you see it. But you must allow me to collect the facts, and form my own opinion from them."
"I had
"Can you break the bonds on the bed, and tear it from the wall?"
“That is about to change,” Holmes intoned darkly, and Mycroft nodded.
Watson cleared his throat, said roughly, “I- I should be going. I’ll stop by Baker Street before dawn, let Mrs. Hudson know you are all right. She’s been worried about you.”
"The blood that should have been feasted on is currently covering the walls of the alley where the body was found,” Holmes agreed. “He wasn't killed for his blood. Besides, these neck wounds are not consistent with fang marks. The edges are far too ragged, the holes themselves too large and far apart, and there are no incisor marks as there were on Langley. Unless this ‘vampire’ is twice as large as a man and missing most of his teeth, he wasn’t killed by one of you...but we are meant to think he was.”
in a vulnerable position as well."
Watson chuckled. "It is entirely up to you if you wish to travel across the city looking debauched."
"Ah yes, Father Newman. How long have you been attending Mass at that particular church?"
Watson touched cold fingers to lips now blushed a faint pink by Holmes' blood.
“They don’t, really. It’s just something to
"Because you are innocent of any crime, and I regret having been the catalyst of your pain." He did not say the
"I am not," Holmes corrected, for the first time warmth in his voice. "I accept that my work can be dangerous; I also accept that it must be done. Were I a reckless man, I would have died ten years ago at least."
Fortunately, Watson learned long ago that vampires did not require mortal medicines to heal the sick. Not exactly.
"And for London's," added Holmes baldly.
He was roused by a sharp slap across the face, and when his vision cleared Newman sat crouched over him like a gargoyle, mouth twisted into a permanent sneer.
“A belief not currently shared by my brother.”
"Which war was it?" Knowing Watson had been turned in battle hardly narrowed things down; humanity was at constant war with itself. One of those things that never changed.
“England has never acknowledged sovereign Irish nobility,” Mycroft agreed, “or clan rule. Many clans have in the past made their own coat of arms in defiance of the crown, but they were never recognized in any official capacity.”
Newman face was a darkened mirror that reflected nothing. "I've forgotten," he said boldly, and the corner of Holmes' mouth twisted up.
The idea of the undead and creatures rising from their graves he dismissed outright. Watson’s heart
"I know, my son," the vicar said wearily. "I'm so sorry I made you wait so long, it simply wasn't safe, and the last one died before he could confess-"
"You made all of that up," Watson said with certainty. "There's no proof for any of that."
Holmes stood, regarding Watson for a searching moment. "Vigilante justice is a dangerous game, doctor. I hope for the sake of more than just ourselves that Stamford was not wrong about you, and I am not wrong about him." Then he showed himself to the door.
Watson doubted his fortitude, in such a situation.
“They are readying their clan for war,” Holmes surmised, then louder, “The vampire kept in Saint Cyprian’s clergy house was insane; that might go a way to explaining the epidemic of madness that suddenly gripped the church.” Montressor, Langley, the Vicar...all of them feeling the subtle corrupting influence of a vampire driven mad with hunger.
"Mm. For your client's safety. I certainly hope Doctor Jackson is doing well, then. Give him my regards."
Now tell me again, you did not think this information vital."
Cards on the table then. "It is obvious
Holmes barked out a laugh. "If it is comfort you are looking for, you'd have done better to seek company elsewhere."
"I thought you didn't believe in such things," Jackson mocked.
"And how often must it be done?"
The dense, black smoke belched up from the broken-toothed silhouette of the London skyline, mixing with the fog off the Thames and wrapping the city in a coal colored shroud of industrialized poison. The city appeared empty, people locked tight in their houses, monolithic buildings like gravestones standing silent sentry in the night while along the road oil lamps hung like forlorn ghosts, limning the streets in a dissipated yellow glow.
"A deranged one," Holmes answered, for while there was historical evidence that drinking blood had not always been looked upon with horror - and still wasn't, in certain parts of the world - that was not the answer Montressor wanted to hear right now, nor was it an answer that would garner any cooperation.
Watson felt something inside him shrivel, and said no more. Holmes had given him his answer, and it was a bitter pill indeed.
“What sort of secrets?” he asked suspiciously, gaze wandering again to the leather straps on the bed, a dim sort of understanding beginning to foment  in his eyes.
Holmes was aware of this of course, and it was not lost on him that Mycroft had lifted the warding spell anyway, nor that they were alone in the room together. But that did not mean there was any real trust there; Mycroft would have a contingency. Several of them, most likely. However vulnerable he appeared, Holmes had no doubt his brother was well protected in one fashion or another.
“Good,” he said encouragingly, “now...” he pushed forward, reaching out to touch one of the shelves before it could spin away.
"No, my work on this case is decidedly pro bono. However, like you I occasionally employ the destitute to help me in small endeavors, and they are often an excellent source of information. I know many of them in this area and their movements are visible to me while they go unnoticed by the general public. I did not know Mister Blevins personally but his disappearance was brought to my attention. I find the fact his coat was found while the man was not to be highly suspicious. It is still cold this time of year; a man with so little would not have left it behind."
“Only a dozen small observations. And no, not the one you destroyed. He was- caring for it, in a fashion. But it was not his Master.”
Lestrade shook his head, hands locking behind his back. “It’s a dark business. Your request and the scene itself were enough to secure a warrant to dig up the graves around the church, though we didn’t know what we were lookin’ for.”
"And age is the only vector by which a vampire's strength increases?" Holmes pressed, and Watson paused before he answered, because Holmes had a sharp look about him, something intense and driving lurking just under the surface of everything he said and Watson didn't trust it, that deconstructing gaze.
Lestrade acquiesced with surprisingly little fuss. "You seem quite confident about that, and when Sherlock Holmes is confident, I would be a fool to disagree. I'll send a summons this afternoon."
“Thralls are still dangerous, Holmes,” Watson cautioned, “and in your present state there is little you can do to defend yourself.”
Newman spoke up. "You come here in disguise, lie to us, flit around this holy church with ill intentions...how far down the path of sin have you walked, since giving your allegiance to a vampire?”
Five minutes later he was standing in Kramer’s parlor.
Mycroft was even more perceptive than himself, even better at putting pieces together and thus that short few sentences would tell him infinitely more than it would tell anyone else.
The man considered Holmes’ proposal, finally relenting with a shrug. “He rented some rooms over on Swinton street, near Regent’s square.”
His ploy was to keep the vicar distracted. He had already formulated three possible methods of escape, but the most likely required he wait until Newman was conscious and somewhat on his feet, when Deighton had – hopefully – spared a breath of attention for his injured accomplice. Then Holmes would-
Holmes stood, moving towards him with a purposeful stride. “Watson, come here. I’ve much to acquaint you with.”
"Were you present when the police made their inspection?" He asked the woman, stepping over to examine the bookshelf.
“I will then.”
“Consider it at any rate,” Mycroft said. “As the doctor is here, we might as well make use of him. Such an experiment might yield valuable information as to the mental capabilities of vampires and their thralls which can be used to further our cause, and I know of no-one reckless and foolhardy enough to willingly replicate your circumstances, brother mine.”
He blinked, smile frozen to his face for half a second before melting away, pleasure replaced by mild offense. "A parasite?" he repeated, searching the detective’s face for signs of jest but of course there were none; Holmes was a master deceiver.
"He is fond of the bird," Holmes continued after a moment, "but it is being neglected in the shed, rather than kept in the house where it was no doubt used to being before it was moved. Nor is the change a helpful one; it has pulled out half its feathers in distress."
That made him genuinely laugh, which was unfortunate because it hurt a good deal, lungs hitching their way through a spastic, broken chortle. "Oh, oh-ow. Oh please don't make me laugh so," he gasped. "It's excruciating."
"You won't like this," he said apologetically before ripping off the trouser leg around Holmes' injured knee. It had been shattered to a pulp, bone sticking out through the flesh and Watson's face contorted in anger and sympathy before he bit into his wrist and let a few drops of blood fall into the wound, then repeated the process with Holmes' arm and head and thigh, anywhere the damage seemed particularly severe.
"You can inspect the body when it's been brought down," Gregson bristled. "No one in their right mind expects you to go gallivanting across the rooftops."
"You have not yet confessed to a heavenly witness,” Deighton reminded him. “Were you to die now, you would go to hell.”
"I do not think so," Holmes said with damnable certainty.
, brother,” he warned, “Do not waste your gift.”
"Of course," Holmes finally replied with flawless diplomacy, giving a slight bow of his own. "Until tomorrow night."
Holmes was certainly right about that. Mycroft was mortal, but he was half the man his brother was he would still be a formidable adversary. At least for a vampire who disliked murder. "I would not," he admitted. "But I hope he will see that I have done more good for the city than bad."
"Indeed. I must examine the rooftop before your men bring down the corpse."
Saint Cyprian was small parish church of red brick with a deeply sloping roof set high above the street. Despite the hour a crowd had already gathered, necks craned to catch a glimpse of the body that could be seen crumpled against the grey slabbed roofing tiles. Out in the street harried looking officers bustled to and fro, futilely trying to disperse the curious onlookers.
“It is probable,” Mycroft agreed. “All the more reason it was foolish of you to allow yourself to be thralled.” He took a long pull from his cigar, regarding Holmes with a gaze twice as sharp and calculating as his own. “You realize the most logical explanation is that this ‘doctor’ has attached himself to you in order to infiltrate the Diogenes from within, to destroy us and thus leave London open to attack from the rest of his clan. If he ordered you to kill me tonight, you would not hesitate.”
Holmes let out a long slow breath from between his teeth, infinitesimal calculations taking place behind his eyes. “That is a problem,” he said, and Watson’s brow furrowed.
They would have to try something else.
Holmes. You don't really feel this way about me."
He left the alley some minutes later and ran into Lestrade’s hard gaze, the small man’s face pulled into a deep-furrowed frown.
“How kind of him,” Watson intoned with faint sarcasm, and yet even as he said it, he knew it to be an unfair sentiment. For what real grievance did he have against Stamford’s actions? Had not a similar compulsion led Watson to seek Holmes out as well? But, like Stamford, once he came to know the man he had declared a target, he could not go through with it.
"He was," Holmes lied smoothly. "I...had feared something like this. Montressor was not a well man. He was fully convinced Doctor Jackson was dangerous. We agreed he should disappear until I'd collected enough evidence to bring a case against him.”
He shrugged. “I don’t have much personally; London has had a dearth of vampires since before I was born. Most of our encounters have taken place outside the city – I suppose we’ve Doctor Watson thank for that. As such, this is my first time seeing one face to face, though I hope to remedy that eventually.”
"Modesty is a terrible habit, Watson, you should divest yourself of it as soon as possible."
“Hide!?” he repeated, aghast, and looked up with a scandalized expression.
“If he’s as mad as his father, would he need one? Anyway, if the boy was...deformed, as you suggest, well. He may have gotten loose one night, and Langley caught sight of ‘em.  Everyone knows Langley was half mad himself; his mind might have wandered to strange places. If the next time they met Langley attacked, and the boy killed him...you did say you thought it self-defense. And if he wasn’t locked up before then, he certainly would be afterwards.”
"I perhaps exaggerated on that note," he admitted. "I do have a pulse, but it is extremely slow, enough that it is clinically undetectable. I did spend a few evenings about fifty years ago counting my pulse at rest and during activity. It was, on the whole, terrifically boring."
be. The doctor has already informed you of my quick recovery thus far."
This was not surprising. That Montressor would attempt to leave the city was nearly a foregone conclusion. He was a frightened, superstitious, somewhat cowardly man and such men did not  often linger after being questioned by detectives in regards to crimes they most definitely committed.  Even when the questions were as innocuous as Holmes' had been.
"He arrived here unexpectedly one night and saw you drinking her blood. Am I correct in deducing that your heightened senses become somewhat dulled when you feed? When all you can focus on is the blood?" Distracted, hearing nothing but the pulse of blood through a living heart, the smell of it in the nose, its taste on the tongue and the hot slide of it as it coated the inside of a cold mouth...it might be possible to catch a vampire off guard.
"I know with absolute certainty that he is," the vicar said, voice steady with conviction. "And I know that he still lives, inasmuch as these creatures can be considered alive."
As to the man himself, Holmes found his feelings far from resolute. He had not liked the doctor upon their first meeting, or their second - and given the man had sought him out with the intent to kill, Holmes held that opinion as fair -  thus Watson had entered their third confrontation with Holmes being decidedly prejudiced against him. Somewhat surprisingly however, he found his opinion slightly improved on closer acquaintance. Once Watson accepted Holmes would not be intimidated by him. Once Holmes accepted Watson was in genuine need of help.
He screamed and collapsed - which in his experience was how most men reacted to being shot - landing half atop the injured man, who let out another low, tormented moan. Or maybe that was Holmes himself.
It was not possible for Watson’s skin to get paler, but the dawning realization on his face was compelling enough. His eyes were wide as the open sky, and his voice faltered slightly as he spoke. “But- no one has ever addressed me as ‘Prince’, nor offered either official challenge or allegiance-”
No trigger warnings
Holmes clutched his hand hard around his glass and looked away, but Mycroft would not be routed so easily. “He resigned from the order shortly after he met you; even before you took rooms together at Baker Street. He knew he could not serve two masters, both us and you. He chose you; take comfort at least in that.”
Holmes shot him a parlous look. "Hopping out the door on one leg is a tad undignified."
"The liquor is for patients," Watson chastised, then busied himself starting a fire in the parlor hearth.
"I will wait for them in whichever form they take." Watson replied somewhat earnestly.
Holmes’ good hand made a hard fist against the wooden armrest. “Obviously,” he bit out. “To that point, I should not have allowed you to stay at all.”
"You must give Montressor exactly what he wants. You must disappear."
Watson cradled Holmes carefully as a newborn babe as the detective began to relax, his arms surprisingly gentle in contrast to the grip his teeth had on the man's neck. He moaned as the hunger started to fade and with it came clarity, the awareness to know that Holmes was beginning to swoon. His human half wrestled control away from the beast and he pulled away at last, licking Holmes' wounds to close them, cleaning the last traces of blood from his neck. He stayed there, kneeling over Holmes with one knee pressed into the chair, holding him as the haze began to fade.
“You seem to have it all thought out.” Holmes' lips were quirked in a shadow of amusement, and Watson had the distinct impression the detective was laughing at him.
"The blood of the innocent, surely," Newman conceded. "But the blood of a sinner? Spilled in confession to save a man's soul? That is righteous, and the diocese are fools."
Watson let out something between a hiss and a growl, turning to stare at him in naked hunger. He took an unconscious step forward before stopping again, face distorting in something like pain. "Get
"Good man," he mumbled, trying to give Watson a pat on his hand and missing badly. And then he was asleep, face smoothing out at last, free of all suffering.
And there is was, the whole sordid business laid out at last, Montressor's guilt a front page headline scrawled all across his face. Lucy confirmed her husband's involvement with Langley's suicide mission herself, and Montressor's absence from the flat in accordance to the shop girl's account lined up with the time of Kramer's death.
"No indeed, it fades over time. It depends on how much blood is given, but generally a thrall will last only a week or two. After that more blood must be drank. I am unfamiliar with the particulars, but I understand the practice is a common one among my kind. Vampires often use thralls as a food source, and to help guard their lairs in the daylight while they sleep."
"Cedar," Holmes replied decisively, "and sage."
Holmes made no answer but gave the priest his full attention and the man spoke on, his voice growing fervent, eyes ablaze with a light other men might call zealotry. "Many a man comes to the church seeking forgiveness because he fears for his soul, fears the judgement that will be cast upon him, but such men as this are not truly willing to repent and atone for their sins. When a man seeks forgiveness out of fear alone a lie stains his heart, for his motives are impure. A servant of God such as myself or Father Deighton may forgive a sinner all other trespasses, but that one is beyond our reach. To truly accept the love of God and the forgiveness of Christ, a man must let go of all fear."
“He was quite good at that, wasn’t he?” Watson said, carding his fingers through Holmes’ hair, arm draped carelessly about his shoulders.
After a long moment which Holmes spent contemplating the merits of housebreaking the door finally opened, the doctor standing on the other side looking pale and dark-eyed, white skin almost translucent in the moonlight.
“I assume he relayed to you the conversation that took place between us this morning, thus there is no need for repetition; we shall move on. I have spent the day examining our historical records for the past one hundred years. There is a notable decrease in vampiric activity within the city starting approximately fifty years ago, supporting your assertion that you have been present in London and disposing of all challengers to your claim since then.”
in my hands. How could you trust me so? I tried to kill you!" Watson didn't understand it.
Watson looked up at him slowly, a slope-shouldered villain and
Watson had almost forgotten Sturgerson’s presence in the room, until the man suddenly spoke.
"I know. You
If Mycroft were not interested, he would not have commented at all.
Mrs. Hudson, who knew his habit so well, waited until nearly ten o' clock before knocking on his door.
Watson pressed his lips together. Damn Holmes and his infallible ‘logic’. "There is a trail of blood through the house, from the cellar to the upstairs, where carnage ensued. There is a charred corpse-shaped pile of ashes on the bed, and two dead men. There's enough evidence to prove they were dragging a bleeding man upstairs to some horrific fate; perhaps the corpse on the bed is his remains."
Holmes glanced at him and shrugged.  Holmes was always shrugging at him, it seemed. "When he next hires someone my Irregulars will inform me of it. I will then apprehend him, hopefully before he is able to kill again."
“Really? You should have come to me; I could have saved you the trouble. It was Mister James Montressor who killed him, if you still wish to know. I don’t know if he has yet confessed in front of a judge, but he likely will at some point.”
"Yes, yes...you are right," Holmes relented, aware that even that was suspect. "But you will come again, after dark?"
"Yes," he breathed, sinking against Watson, his body cold and hard and startlingly real. "I loved Stamford; I do still. But I did not feel for him what I feel for you."
“Had you been any other vampire, I would not have attempted it,” Holmes answered with infuriatingly pedantic reason. “But you bring up an interesting point: ‘how’ indeed.”
"The papers there- ammonium hydroxide will suck the iron out of the ink, so long as they are not too burnt. Here-" and then was off, that familiar focus back. But this time when he took to his desk, he dragged Watson along with him.
If James Moriarty was indeed the enemy who waited outside London, things were far more dangerous than any of them had realized.
trigger warnings: none
Holmes read aloud at the end of one such plea,
be rash enough to murder a man and leave his body floating in the open canal where it would most certainly be discovered, and at the very time he is attempting to ingratiate himself to the Diogenes? To what purpose?"
Watson's hands stilled and he felt a momentary flash of embarrassment. "It can be most enjoyable," he agreed, keeping his head down, his movements precise. "I usually ensure my patients are unaware of exactly what is happening, but I admit I do not erase their memories of the pleasure it brings them. Repeat clients are a dependable resource."
The vicar left and Holmes applied himself the task of cleaning his plate, displaying an appetite that was rarely present in his day-to-day life. After that he did very little, content to doze by the fire, the very picture of a penniless degenerate who was only grateful to have a full belly and a warm place to sleep.
“Holmes?”
Montressor eventually roused from his nightmare, waking in slow confusion at finding himself in the alley behind his shop. He stumbled to his feet, movements graceless and uncertain as he slowly made his way around the corner and up the narrow steps to his flat.
"I've no intention of it, old boy," Holmes replied with a shadow of his usual imperious smile, and Watson thought with a sudden pang,
He could not say for certain whether or not these differences effected the taste of the blood directly, but they certainly effected the overall experience. Back before he had learned to feed without killing, he had chosen his victims based on the repulsiveness of their thoughts, culling the most foul and corrupted minds he could find from humanities’ throng. He had not enjoyed feeding from them, touching those diseased minds with his own.  It had made him feel like twice the monster to have their polluted blood coursing through his veins, sustained by evil.
It was a grave error indeed.
"I will stay then," he said.  "My working here may be of benefit to you and the case."
Mycroft shook his head. "I have read of no such thing. There are many years of research here; not a single page speaks of thrall causing the vampire to become infatuated with his victim."
Watson's eyebrows shot up. "You smell like bird shit," he said bluntly. "I can barely catch your scent under all that. What on earth have you been up to?"
"It does seem to be a rather unusually high number of enemies for one man," Mycroft observed. His tone held nothing beyond the bland indifference he reserved for most things outside the scope of his narrow interests, but Holmes knew him far better than that.
"And is there any way to tell a thrall from a man?"
“Right away, he was.”
"My brother can make his own choice at that time," he agreed. "And if he chooses to stay, you will leave him alone."
"May I?" Holmes asked, stepping forward to examine the doctor’s canines.
had several very good reasons for cautioning you against it?”
"Bank ledgers," he muttered, shaking his head. None of this had anything to do with money. Certainly not Kramer's.
about the man. Like an address.
“It is ungentlemanly to listen behind closed doors, brother,” he chastised, but didn’t sound surprised in the slightest.
A moment later the thing shrieked in agony, Holmes' skull vibrating with the sound as it screamed and writhed in it's death throws.
Holmes found himself taut with anticipation. He immediately switched his internal thoughts from English to French, mostly to test whether or not the doctor’s claims were true, and if so, whether or not he could detect subtler things such as shifts in language. Did a vampire ‘hear’ the thoughts of mortals, or did they see images, or sense emotion? It was all quite fascinating.
A small smiled played at the corner of Holmes' mouth. “Hmm, an impressive theory. What of the holes in Langley’s neck?”
But the detective, it seemed, had other ideas. “No, stop- put me down, you fool,” he rasped, and Watson couldn’t even find it in himself to be miffed at the insult, because it meant Holmes was feeling better already.
Perhaps the most surprising thing about the whole business was how unsurprised he was.
"I will," Watson promised, kissing him back.
"Very generous of you," Watson said. "The Yard would surely go bankrupt if they had to pay."
The miscreant had been christened Enoch at birth, and it was the only thing his mother gave him before dying of consumption. Subsequently, he was known only as “Nock”, and he passed the time drinking and robbing and killing his way through a mean, miserable, savage life.
Watson's face grew pensive as he gave the question due consideration, the firelight flickering orange on his pale skin. Finally he shook his head and said with an apologetic shrug, "I honestly can't say; aspects of it defy any science I know. I've studied for a hundred years, trying to learn more but there is little in the way of true research. Much of what I know I have learned from studying myself.”
A long while later he woke in a hospital bed, strong medicinal scent sharp in his nose. The pain was dulled to a distant, discordant echo and the world held a crystalline, dreamlike quality that bespoke of heavy morphine. His wounds had been treated and wrapped, broken bones splinted and hidden beneath strips of white plaster. His leg was elevated against several pillows, and his arm lay nestled in a sling across his chest.
It was the first thing Watson had said that Holmes found himself disbelieving entirely.
"Go to hell," Holmes answered with savage brightness.
Three minutes later he was leaping across the rooftops towards the clergy house of Saint Cyprian’s Church.
He wasn’t much bothered by the fact. Walking was good for stimulating the mind, and there was much to consider.
Well, it gave him a purpose anyway, something he could use to prove to Mycroft that he was more than that damn monster who had thralled his brother. The monster Mycroft saw whenever he looked at him. The monster Watson saw when he looked in the mirror...
“I don’t want to leave you here alone the rest of the night, it’s unconscionable. As your doctor-”
"There was nothing you could have done. The evidence against Montressor was not strong enough to carry weight." And that, too, was the unfortunate truth.
"Tending birds," he replied, then got to the point. "Tell me about the particulars of your confrontation with Father Newman. Where and when did it take place? What was said?
“I would have tried earlier, had I known the vicar’s secret. But we shall have to wait until the thrall fades.”
Watson followed dutifully, hand resting on Holmes' shoulder as he worked and far from being a distraction, Holmes found himself better able to direct his thoughts when the doctor was nearby. The world made a good deal more sense when the doctor was within easy reach. Holmes worked quickly, hands flashing as he mixed up a small vial of chemicals, put a clean sheet of foolscap over the charred paper and poured a bit of the liquid over it. "Let us see what Newman was trying to conceal."
“The fact the letters were burnt points to their being genuine,” Mycroft added.
On the whole, he adapted to this sharp turn in his world-view with almost philosophical aplomb. After all, science itself was continuously challenging man to redraw the boundaries of his knowledge in an ever-expanding attempt to understand the fundamental principium of the universe. If this was a somewhat extreme example, it was essentially no different. Should he reject the facts in front of him simply because they did not align with his preconceived notions of the world? Of course not. The rational thing, the
want you to have them, that’s the trouble,” he answered unhappily, and Holmes quieted him with a kiss. Then he curled into the doctor’s cold embrace and did something quite remarkable.
It was Sunday, and the whole of the household at Mass when Holmes' dark figure sidled up to the kitchen door of the clergy house, made quick work of the lock and slipped inside. What he found was for the most part a typical manse - smaller than some but more than spacious enough for its purpose - and simple but comfortable arrangements; the reverend at least did not appear to concern himself with material gain.
Holmes saw no reason for dishonesty. "Better than I could be. Credit where it is due; this facility has excellent morphine."
him, beyond even all the very obvious and logical reasons why he should be bothered. He wanted to think on that. He wanted to
His next stop was the Yard, and he wondered if Lestrade had managed to identify the body ahead of him.
It was just as well; Watson had already gleaned from Holmes' mind that it had been too long since the man last had proper rest. To that end he carefully pried Holmes out of the chair and half guided, mostly carried him to the bed. He laid him down, removed his shoes and made certain he was covered; being without blood made the body colder than usual. Then...then he stood watch.
It had been warm and humid that day in his memory, and his lace cravat had been terribly uncomfortable; over-starched and scratchy. But fashion had been different back then, too. So much had changed in a century... he turned, his reminiscing interrupted by the distant sound of Holmes' approach, the steady beat of the detective's tireless heart now a familiar sound that seemed to quicken his own sluggish pulse.
Watson felt his interest pique. Stamford had spoken to him once or twice of these fugue states, to beg his opinion as a medical man. But of course all his information came second hand, and Watson had been unable to give him much practical advice. He had hinted that he might have better luck were he able to speak to Holmes himself, but Stamford assured him of the impossibility of such an interview, as Holmes was reluctant enough to speak of his fugues even with Stamford, and he would certainly not confide in a stranger. (That, at least, had been true enough, though of course Stamford had other reasons for keeping himself and Holmes away from each other. It was certain that had they ever met, Holmes keen skills of observation would have immediately made Watson an object of interest and Holmes would not have rested until he had learned the truth.)
"Perils." Watson looked thoughtfully at Holmes as the moonlight broke through a cloud to shine like silver on his raven hair, haloing him with a soft glow. For a moment he looked disastrously beautiful, a work of art painted by some forgotten master. "Aside from your work, what other perils are there surrounding you, Holmes?"
"I am sure it comes as no surprise to you when I say I have no desire to be freed."
to Holmes in here.
Watson smiled. It wasn't quite a smirk, but a dark mirth lingered there.
about what had passed at the clergy house, though it was obvious tongues had been wagging freely enough among the congregation. Only Father Deighton refused to acknowledge his new status as parish pariah, showing him even greater kindness than before- offering Holmes extra food, and furnishing him with a fine wool coat he'd paid for himself.
He was being petty.
The gentleman took an antique watch from his pocket and glanced at it, hastening his steps as he moved toward better, lighter streets and Nock was not about to let such pickings get away; the watch alone would afford him liquor and women for weeks. He pulled out his weapon - a Sheffield knife he'd taken off the body of a man he'd once killed in a bar fight - and slinked like a hungry dog out of the tar-black shadows of the alley.
“How poetic. Truly brother, what occurred was an accident, a miscalculation on my part for I had thought the vicar to be at mass; I had not realized he knew my identity. But here, look at me now; is the shadow so very great as it has been?”
nearly dead, slumped there against the wall. "Front door open, trail of blood to a hidden room, where someone was kept prisoner for...several months...yes. It should suffice."
Watson didn’t pay him much notice, flashing him a doctor’s smile, warm and reassuring. He reached out with his preternatural senses and probed the man’s mind, finding it imminently open to suggestion. Perfect. “Everything is fine, constable,” he said pleasantly, tone disarming in its open friendliness. “Why don’t you
"I am a man of justice; it is disheartening how often those two concepts diverge." He sighed, "Montressor must answer for his crime. I cannot do that without compromising you, and in so doing putting the lives of innocent - if incompetent - officers at risk. I think I speak rightly when I say you will not go quietly into that good night. If someone threatens you, you will not hesitate to kill them. You might mourn them afterwards and grieve for your actions, but in the heat of the moment you will protect yourself. If the Yard comes to your door and you refuse to meet them in the daylight, there will be questions. Even if you belay their suspicions, it will take root in others.
Watson hummed thoughtfully, then looked again at the dead man, his expression pensive. “At the risk of conceit, I believe this was a message meant for me.”
True enough, as if Holmes had summoned her from the ether, Watson soon heard footsteps echoing down the corridor.
He pushed the food away mostly uneaten and went to secure the garret room from the sun.
"Why would he require Langley to frighten Jackson away if the man had already gone?" Holmes asked reasonably, and Newman spread his hands helplessly.
"The meeting will not take place here. I am sorry brother, I will not risk it. I know what you would do for my sake; breaking your word is the least of it."
Mycroft glared at him. "You're damn right I won't trust it, but tell me anyway. I know
“Kramer was a friend of mine. What do you want to know?”
, and he didn’t like hearing Holmes say it. He was
It might have been hyperbole, or Mycroft might have been entirely serious. It was impossible to tell and with Mycroft, it was always best to err on the side of caution.
“Very well,” Watson sighed, resigning himself to whatever madcap scheme Holmes had just invented, “what is it you need me to do?” He had a feeling he was going to regret those words.
Holmes had been expecting a question of this nature, and gave an indolent shrug. "Most me life, I s'pose," he began, scratching at his nose. " ‘Twas a family sin, if ye follow. Didn’t get bad till I crushed me leg, an then drink was all as helped the pain. Didn’t help nothin' else though. After I lost me Annie, I swore I'd ne'er touch another drop. Got meself proper work; I done her proud. But then masser went off ta Normandy, and I didn’t have work no more. Not till the vicar took me in."
He picked up a cold, stiff hand, indicating with his finger as he spoke. "Note if you will the callus built up on the inside webbing of his left hand just here, between finger and thumb. He has calluses nowhere else on his hands; he is not a man used to hard labor. He is however a man who spends a great deal of time sliding a cue stick between his fingers. That and the white chalk on his sleeve says he was in the local gaming hall no more than an hour or two before dying. No time to eat, but time to shoot billiards. Clearly he had priorities."
"I will not be ordered about," he replied archly, even though he had intended to bathe anyway. The last week or so had left him smelling a bit ripe even by his somewhat lax standards.
"I suppose it doesn’t really matter," Watson conceded. "If someone is drunk and I drink from them, I do feel something akin to drunkenness, but I don’t believe I’ve ever had the opportunity to try cocaine. It struck me as useful for surgery, and not much else."
“What did you mean just now?”
“He has displayed a rare passion for the subject,” Holmes said mildly, “though I don’t suppose he would divulge the details.”
Watson pressed his lips together.  "I admit this may be somewhat beyond what I am used to,” he acknowledged a bit unsteadily, “but my concern now is your protection. You are as endangered as myself; if I need to slip out of view, so do you."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did my suggestion include allowing him to fall into a fugue state?”
"Do not be tiresome. We have been over this, you know there is not. That is why - much as I would rather not - I must wait for him to strike again. The proof must be absolute, and going to Lestrade ahead of time will do nothing save tip him off."
The vampire at least had the good sense to catch on quickly. "I meant for your own health," he amended lamely.
“I’d be grateful for any truth you can give me,” Lestrade said honestly.
“That is generous,” drawled Holmes in a way that Watson knew meant his request was about to be unequivocally denied, “but you will not be much use to me if the man is taken during the daylight hours.”
A brief inquiry of the marginally competent officers at Scotland Yard informed him that the dead man had yet to be identified and it was comforting to know the new world order had at least shown no effect on the acumen of London’s constabulary. Holmes found Lestrade in his cramped and paper strewn office, pouring over whatever mundane bureaucracy it was that kept the wheels of justice turning a snail’s pace.
“This is Saint Cyprian’s clergy house,” Newman explained. “It is only Father Deighton and myself who stay here at the moment, and his duties at the church leave him scarce time to care for his birds. As for myself, I fear I know little of the subject. So you see, your skills are sorely needed; perhaps God has guided your feet here.”
“I see no way around it, if everything is as you say,” Holmes rejoined nonchalantly, unaware of the danger at his back, the terrible peril he was about to place himself in. “You cannot protect me in the daylight, and wheelchair bound I am as good as caught.”
Holmes stepped back, away from the doctor’s cold reach. "No."
And so did Mycroft.
The good doctor did not make him wait, measuring it out with practiced hands. "A small dose," he explained, "because Lord knows what concentration this is at."
"I didn't think we were allowed to speak beyond the foyer, save for the Stranger's Room," Holmes observed, changing the subject because if Mycroft did not believe him anyway then there was no point wasting the air necessary to refute him.
"They do, for certain," Watson confirmed. "I can withstand early dawn and sunset now; I could not before. I heal faster, and I can - I can hear mortal's thoughts more clearly, if I concentrate."
Holmes paused, glancing at Watson. "Do 'sires' often keep watch over their protege?" he asked, and Watson nodded immediately.
He left Kramer's flat and immediately hailed a cab to Montressor's address in Marylebone.
Well, it was all conjecture anyway. Still, it was a working theory that didn't rely on magically animated corpses, so there was that.
Her lips pressed together so hard they went white, and she shook her head determinedly. "He couldn't have. He
His face and body went slack, eyes heavy and half-lidded as he responded to Watson’s silent wanting, arching his neck to present his blood for the taking and Watson had to close his eyes against the image, but it remained engraved like an icon on the underside of his eyelids.
"I do," Holmes said, not bothering to address the second question. "I have been questioning the vagrants who live within sight of the church. The pattern is gruesome but predictable. With Blevins gone, Newman will be looking for new blood."
"Good information is invaluable," he told her with a regal tip of his hat. He exited the shop, no doubt leaving her to ponder what the word 'invaluable' meant.
They began again, and once more the library whirled and danced about him, but this time when he tried to gain access, he could feel Holmes’ resistance as the shelves spun faster, eluding him. He smiled in approval, then let a bit more of his strength flow in. He reached out and grabbed hold of one of the bookcases...
It was very late; closer to dawn than sunset. The place Holmes next intended to visit would be closed for the night and thus it was back to Baker Street and those lonely rooms he perfunctorily referred to as 'home' but which had not felt as such for many months. Tomorrow he would pick up the threads of the investigation again.
"No, of course not; he wants you dead. However, he doesn't yet want to kill you himself, which is as favorable an outcome as one could hope for."
Newman glided up beside them smooth as a serpent in the Garden. "I will say the man had a problem with drinking," he reported in a low voice. "It was an old vice, and the cause of his banishment from the clergy house. Perhaps he simply succumbed to the devils drink once more."
He glanced up at them. “Do I have a reason to be concerned, Mister Holmes?”
"Were I to be followed, that would not be terribly helpful. Is there no-one you trust?"
He trailed his fingers down Holmes' face and Holmes melted against his hand with a sigh that sent shivers down Watson’s spine. Gliding his thumb over Holmes' bottom lip he could feel his damp breath, still hot and just this side of quickened. Holmes was so alive, so enticing and the scent of their joined blood thrumming through his veins was sweeter than honey...but he didn’t want to
Lestrade made his promises to do so once more, then left Holmes to his own devices. Once the inspector was gone Holmes sighed wistfully, finding a good portion of his attention claimed by Watson. The hard marble of his body as it pressed unyielding against Holmes' burning skin, the burnished bronze of his hair, the impossible color of his eyes...he wondered if such feelings really would fade with the absence of Watson's blood. If not, he was a lost man.
Sherlock Holmes was not yet asleep. This was not an unusual state of affairs but he saw no reason to advertise the fact and thus ignored the knocking at the front door in favor of turning his attention back to the monograph he was writing; a comprehensive study of poisonous plants indigenous to the British Isles along with their various effects upon the human psyche. He had spent several months in thorough research after all and was nearly finished. A vial of cocaine, near two-thirds empty rested precariously close to the edge of the desk.
Lestrade’s head spun around like an owl to regard Holmes in open disbelief. “Eh? He’s killed two men already, and nearly a third on his way out the door.”
"I am aware of it," Holmes answered, darkly knowing. "Whoever the sire is, he is incredibly clever- and patient. We must ask ourselves if the sudden rash of men out for your blood once the vicar learned of your existence was entirely coincidental. Knowing what we do now, it is likely it was not. For years now there has been only one vampire in London; a rouge element without clan or status, and every immortal player of the Great Game knew it. But they did not know who you were. Your anonymity has been your greatest weapon; it is now gone. There is little chance Newman did not send word of you. You have been identified, doctor. The game is afoot."
Watson smiled, unsurprised. "Technically you haven’t got a physician, I'm not sure they'll like that."
"Not yet. Had I known your intentions before I would have advised against it, but you are here now. Leaving abruptly in the midst of this case would do nothing but cast more eyes your direction."
“What we doin' then, sah?” one of the older boys asked, a stout young lad by the name of Cartwright.
“And what do you make of the deceased?” Holmes asked, playing into the charade.
Were the situation less dire, Holmes might have spared a moment to marvel at his brother’s guile.
"They've prescribed you morphine to take home," Mycroft rumbled as he motioned for the nurse to grab the handles and lead the way out of the room. "I told them that was unwise, but they insisted." He paused, "I shall be looking after it for you."
Mycroft nodded gravely, and the fingers of his left hand twitched. Then he turned and left Holmes standing in the hallway. Somewhere in the cavernous space, a grandfather clock chimed the hour of three.
Two weeks after they pulled Langley’s body off the church roof Holmes found himself in a dark alley thick with the smell of death, kneeling behind bins overflowing with decay and waiting impatiently for a nervous constable to bring over a lamp, that he might better examine the scene. A bloated half-moon hung in the sky like a distended stomach, pale light filtering down through layers of soot and grime, illuminating nothing.
“The victim was a murderer; the kind below even your notice, brother. A degenerate wretch who will be mourned by no-one. Indeed, it will no doubt be decided London is better off without him. Is that sort of human filth considered when assessing the boundaries of your doctor’s moral code, or does the Prince of London take out his own trash?”
"Be careful," Watson warned again, Holmes' words seeming to fill him once more with alarm. "If things are as dangerous as you think, perhaps we should abandon this whole thing."
“Not yet; I still have work to do.” Then he hit him with the shillelagh.
That is the conclusion we have come to, after checking the word length and finding it clocking in somewhere between fucktrillion and billiony-fuck.  But rather than do the responsible thing and trim it down, we decided to split it up into a series, to make it less intimidating for us to edit and hopefully for you to read. We also changed the title of this work and made the old title the series header, because we're the authors and we can do what we want.
Holmes whimpered but was in pleasure and ecstasy, Watson could sense that much as the feelings flowed between them like blood. They were well and truly joined this way, Watson’s teeth in Holmes’ throat the most intimate of kisses.
Holmes quickly weighted his options and chose the one least safe to himself but which would hopefully cause the least amount of trouble, pain and/or death for everyone else involved in the business.
Watson’s mouth shrunk into a hard line, and he brought the full force of his Will to bear. “
"Set it there," he said absently, nodding to an empty space on his left. "I'll attend to it after I've finished."
Holmes could do nothing but comply, his chest rising and falling as his breath settled into to a rhythm that was not his own.  It happened impossibly quick, the space between one blink and the next. Watson’s lips were suddenly against his neck, and there was a moment’s hesitation before his teeth broke through flesh. Holmes gasped, a sharp inhale of breath and it most definitely hurt...but the pain was not entirely unpleasant. There was something erotic to the blending of pleasure and pain, almost sexual in it's effect and his body responded accordingly, heart rate jumping, blood starting to pump through the wound in his neck that much faster.
“I don’t have to; ever since the thrall your emotions I can sense without effort, and with greater nuance than before.”
He flagged down a passing hansom cab, handing the man a half-crown. "Go fetch the first constable you find and bring him back here," Holmes told him briskly, "Tell him Sherlock Holmes requires his assistance. Be back in five minutes, I'll give you another half crown."
He was not there long enough to ask more than a few cursory questions when he was approached by a broad-shouldered man in a waistcoat of dark burgundy. He’d had his eye on this man for several minutes now, because the man clearly had an eye on him as well, his attempts at sublty utterly lost on the detective.
“Vicar says the doors were locked tight as a drum last night,” Lestrade said, puffing over again. He looked around at the crowd still milling about and nodded toward the corpse. "Shall we get him to the morgue now?"
“I hear you’re asking about Michael Kramer,” the man said, tossing caution to wind at last.
Watson left Holmes to his odd experiments and morose thoughts, shutting the door quietly behind him as he slipped out into the cold dark of pre-dawn.
trigger warnings: none
“He might have influenced him,” the man muttered.
His time here was to be little more than a self-imposed imprisonment.
it is - your "dead" client, Doctor Jackson. What name is he going by these days?" He looked Holmes over quickly. "He tempted you by promising to cure your wounds, did he not?"
“Back to the matter at hand,” Mycroft continued, his eyes daring any man in the room to speak over him, and none of them taking up the challenge.  “You have held a claim on London for the past fifty years, and during that time there has been an almost unheard-of peace. We have encountered less than a dozen vampires since then; unprecedented for a city this size. For that, I suppose, the Diogenes must thank you."
Holmes stomach clenched, his heart fluttering into his throat and for a moment he couldn't even talk. "Watson," he croaked, and then the doctor scrambled inside, closing the window behind him.
“Hmm?”
Perhaps it was foolish of him, but Holmes followed the doctor inside. He'd done a great number of foolish things in his life already; there was hardly a good reason to stop now.
to leave you at all, but your safety is my greatest desire.” He thought a moment. “Here then; I will scout the area tomorrow night. If there is no danger I can see, then I will come to you just before the sun rises.”
“Whatever she knows you can likely get from Montressor himself. The man is mad," Holmes said truthfully enough. "I doubt you will have much trouble getting a confession of one sort or another from him.”
Lies! I told him everything. He is a man of God. Surely a man of God would know how to banish evil..."
want anyone else to take Holmes from him.
Holmes stilled, because Watson had commanded it; under thrall his word was as good as an Order. "We should go," he parroted, because Watson had commanded that as well. None of that would likely do anything for Mycroft's feelings toward them, but things were as they were. Holmes
“Exactly. Unwrap me and take the evidence with you. Do not worry; someone will be by soon enough.”
“-Passes through the Green on the northeast corner,” Mycroft continued with a sage nod, “and what is thrown in eventually finds its way to the Thames.”
“Seems we’ve another murderer on our hands,” Lestrade sighed finally, mopping at his brow. “Bloody madman,” he muttered, and Holmes wheezed from his position on the floor.
And Holmes said simply, "Yes."
"Quite often, but it doesn't have to be an active thing. There no real need to 'keep watch' per se; they can "feel" when one of their own dies.”
The first two times he knocked on Montressor's door there was no answer, but after the third it cracked open and a red-faced man peeked out, wary-eyed and suspicious.
and cataloged it as data; one more thing observed, noted and categorized.
“That is my affair.”
Holmes was talking. “-possible you made an error?” he asked, and Watson’s attention snapped like piano wire, left him blinking like a half-witted fool who’d just been asked to do sums.

But after all Holmes was a man of reason down to his core and he did not allow opinion to cloud his judgement. Thus whatever his personal feelings toward Watson, he did believe Langley had been killed in self defense, and he believed too Watson was being framed for murder. It did not take a great deal of acumen to understand that his energies were best spent pursuing the killers, rather than squabbling with a vampire. That the pursuit would doubtlessly bring him into contact with the doctor at regular intervals was not a thing that could be helped; he was going to need Watson, whether he liked it or not.
It wasn’t that he wasn't interested - fascinated even. But there was something about Watson that unsettled him, something beyond the obvious fact that the man shouldn't exist. Oh, their paths would likely cross again; Holmes fully admitted his inability to turn away from a mystery. But this mystery in particular
Holmes would
"I did. Though that was not the last I was to see of Father Newman. Langley began following me shortly thereafter and one night I gave him the slip and shadowed
Mycroft took a long pull of his cigar before answering.  “It has many names. In German, it is “verbündete” In Dutch, it is referred to as “vertweelingzieling”, or “twin soul”. In English, it is simply called “bonding” or “the bond”. It is a rare phenomenon, occurring perhaps two or three times a century, and even among vampires, both it's origin and method remain shrouded in mystery.”
Watson was now the object of that intense focus, and it was nearly overwhelming.
He hadn't crushed a pen in years; he had far more mastery over his own strength than that. He sighed and pulled a handkerchief from his pocket, sopped up the mess and cleaned his fingers, rescued his journal, rinsed everything off in the sink. Mundane tasks, these tiny everyday details. Watson found quiet solace in them; they made him feel human.
"Chalk," Holmes revealed at last. "There was none to be found at the scene, meaning the killer took it with him, because it was his own."
believe his story -- Montressor had murdered the very man who
"As his confessor," Holmes interjected, "Deighton would have had a great deal of influence over Montressor. The man was not of sound mind, and who would know that better than his own priest? Likewise Deighton would know what to say to agitate his madness to the tipping point."
“She might know something of the business,” Lestrade argued halfheartedly, his will not in the fight.
“You might as well say it,” Holmes prompted after a long moment.
Watson referred to his notes once more. “Nearly empty; a half-digested pastry, that’s all, though remains of his breakfast were found in the small intestine.”
“The- the graveyard... turn it up.” It was all the wisdom he had strength for, and then the darkness claimed him utterly.  He gave himself over without a fight.
me." It was said too hurriedly, with too much vehemence but there was nothing for it now. Watson had long ago ceased to think of himself as anything other than Holmes' friend and ally, and it didn't sit well with him that Mycroft might feel otherwise.
“Perhaps you could try blocking me with superfluous information?” he suggested. “The first night we met I had a hard time gleaning anything from your mind, it was so noisy. Rather than suppress such a natural inclination, perhaps we could put it to use.”
"God... I love you," he whispered in broken awe, laying Holmes back down against the settee with gentle hands and pulling away his shirt to inspect the wound on his shoulder. It was beginning to heal already, flesh closing up on itself, and new skin beginning to grow.
"Very well. Then tell me firstly who precisely is in pursuit of you, and when you became aware of it."
"They are sending a wheelchair. The fact that I arrived before it tells you how incompetent the staff here are."
"If? You think he'll refuse?"
Newman was silent for a long while, seeming to consider the avenues before him. Finally he spoke, voice low. “I needn’t tell you how very serious this is. Were it up to me, I would have you dismissed from the clergy house in disgrace.”
“Fascinating,” Holmes murmured, and laced their fingers together, marveling at how quickly he had become accustomed to the doctor’s cold touch; how welcome he now found it. He closed his eyes and attempted to sense Watson in the same way, to look for him with something other than his eyes.
"Well fortunately you have been, or I should be worried," Watson said with a jovial smirk.
"No, that was
mad," Mycroft noted, "but you are not wrong that darkness threatens this city. Our scouts have reported increased nocturnal activity in the smaller towns outside London, and in the larger cities, things are beginning to happen.”
He looked up with heavy-lidded eyes and found the doctor staring down at him with open affection. Watson reached down to stroke his face and Holmes leaned into the touch, feelings of warmth, comfort and possession flowing between them. He could not remember ever being so in love...
“Wait- you’re going?”
“Did you fear it?" Holmes asked, sounding only distantly interested. Then, "I might ask what you are doing masquerading as a coroner for the Yard.”
The clock chimed midnight.
"Do you recognize it?" he asked, and Watson shook his head. Words then began to appear, and Holmes leaned it to read them.
"He accused you of being a vampire?"
“No,” Holmes said, and didn’t even twitch.
Holmes had to cover a snort. Far from being offended on Watson’s behalf, Holmes felt a slight flair of triumph. For derogatory as his brother’s remarks might be, the larger point remained; Mycroft was beginning to come around.
Watson blinked, uncertain he had heard correctly. “Permanent?”  he repeated, feeling stunned.
"No," Holmes said, his voice steady.
, Lestrade. A body tells me only part of the story."
“Away! Away from London...” he pulled a white handkerchief from his pocket and mopped at his brow. “I won’t stay here another night. Not one more night!" He muttered nonsense to himself as he shuffled about behind the till, emptying the drawer of the day's income. "You should go too," Montressor said, looking up at him, eyes large as tea saucers. "London is no longer safe; it is plagued by demons!"
"Father!" it screamed, the voice a deep, rasping snarl. It's eyes burned like hell fire, tormented and desperate.
Holmes gave a world-weary sigh. "I am never full divested from the case. Therein lays the trouble with distraction. At times when I can do nothing but
“Scandalous. What did you have planned for when we got there?”
The barest of smiles frosted the edges of Holmes’ mouth as things that had only been suspected were at last confirmed. “Then let me ask a less dangerous one: where did he live? Provide me with an address, and I’ll take my leave.”
“I have heard that thrall can affect men differently. Anything from slavish devotion to grudging obedience, though it often falls to the former. However, I have never heard of a vampire being similarly affected. Perhaps it is because I was drawn to you even before we shared blood.”
"I didn't," Watson insisted, and he could not flush with embarrassment but his body language belied the emotion, arms crossed against his chest like a shield, his gaze turned away.  "I thought whoever tried to come here, I could handle on my own. I have until now..."
The door slammed shut in his face. Well, wasn't that a curious reaction. He knocked again. "Montressor!" he called through the door, "What did you observe, that has you so frightened?" then, softer, "Was it the doctor? What can you tell me of him?"
Holmes immediately saw the way to her heart. "Well, I may be able to help you there. How much does he owe?"
Later, after he had mastered his darker impulses, he had tried to curate his patients in exactly the opposite manner. As he did not have to kill, and his bite had a euphoric effect that seemed the very opposite of unpleasant, he chose among his steadily rotating regulars only those whose mental landscapes he found particularly appealing. Most of these were women due to the simple fact that most of his clients were women (there were some very obvious reasons for this of course) and, on the whole, he found the flavor of women’s thoughts – if it could be called ‘flavor’ – to be more agreeable to him than those of their male counterparts.
The park was quiet that time of night, full moon shining valiantly through a thick blanket of clouds and Watson sat on a bench beneath a sprawling willow tree, staring out into the darkening evening, eyes bright and watchful. It did not matter that there was very little light; he could see in the dark as well as any nocturnal creature, and night was an old friend. In his mind he was replaying a few hazy memories of having visited this very place when he was a young man, warm blooded and alive.
In the inner room, Sturgerson looked up from the sheaf of papers he’d been reading through as Mycroft lumbered in from the foyer.
That was nothing more than what he’d expected to hear. “Tell me then, what did you find when you searched the clergy house?"
He cherished it.
“When its outcome concerns yourself, of course.”
The doctor sighed and shook his head, but Holmes was only one patient of many he was obliged to visit on his rounds. "Will you be leaving now, then?"
Watson felt it necessary in interject at this point. “Not if Holmes was responding to my unconscious desires, rather than my verbal ones.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The place he chose that morning was a deep, dark hole beneath a bridge he'd cleaned out and spruced up. A heavy stone no mortal man could move blocked the way in, half sunken into the soft earth. He sealed himself inside like a wretched thing, laid down and waited for the dawn to take his consciousness away.
Holmes cocked an eyebrow. "Do you often reveal yourself to people you don't trust? A dangerous habit." He shrugged. "The question was purely one of scientific inquiry. Famous literature and general consensus say vampires are undead; their hearts do not beat. And yet they also maintain that one of the only ways to kill them is to pierce them through the heart. But that is contradictory; if the hearts do not beat, then destroying it should hardly matter. Yours however does, implying the opposite. You are alive, in a fashion. Therefore, it follows your heart would be as vital to your continued existence as any man."
