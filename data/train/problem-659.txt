After we had traced the pattern of our dance once on the floor, I knew something was wrong. Our lines were there, I could see them, but they had little light where they crossed and not a single leaf sprouted from any of them.  I had asked why, but Sherlock had merely shaken his head, leaning more of his weight upon me. I hadn’t had time to think it through, but he was losing the ability to stand and some instinct told me that he shouldn’t fall across our design, that the little we had laid down was at least some protection.  So, I brought him to his knees in the centre where our steps hadn’t fallen and hoped I could re-enforce the pattern on my own.
He shrugged.  “I will not say no, but the effect will be short-lived as there are things we must each do after the bands are on to seal the charm.”
He wet his lower lip, left the tip of his tongue there.  The butterfly stung it repeatedly, close together.  Sensation darted from each piercing, one not subsiding before the next one began, down his throat, along his cheeks into his ears and on into his brain.
He wondered about the glue he had used on the key pads.  The odour had been mild; he could still smell it a bit.  Was it a hallucinogen?
The floor beneath me was very hard and very white.  I looked over at Greg.  He was looking up.  I did the same, squinting into the brightness.
“He is not likely to have known.  What I think he would like to have back is this,” Sherlock said, waving another document.
“I am sorry.  I picked up more hours at the surgery for tomorrow and Friday,” John said.  “I would very much have liked to have met him.”
I steadied Sherlock with a hand on his uninjured shoulder and stood.  It took me a long time, as though the air were congealing, and once I was upright, he slumped against my legs and almost overbalanced me.  His knuckles cracked against the floor.  I winced and wanted to bend back down to kiss them.
I paused on the front step, hand resting on my computer bag, gun tucked in my waistband, holding a slightly damp carrier bag of toiletries and watched Wiggins slide the suitcases out of the back of the taxi.  “There’re boxes of books in the boot,” I called.  “I could give you a hand.”
We released the shafts without further encouragement and pulled ourselves up onto the flat stones along the top of the wall.
“There you are,” John replied.  “Find somewhere to land, drink deep and show me your true colours.  I give you my promise now to stay with you for the rest of my life because a life without you in it wouldn't be worth living.”
I added milk to my tea.  “Sherlock claims neighbours are better sources of information than security cameras.  They’re probably better than the internet as well.”
John opened the car door before she could lean closer.  “Need an early night is all,” he said.  “Sorry about dinner.”
John turned his face, brushed Sherlock’s hair from his forehead.  With a slight upwards push, Sherlock’s lips reached John’s mouth.  It opened sweetly.
He bounded out from beneath my hand towards the mound, circled around the quiet restaurant at the top and sped back to me.
“You’ll be able to find your way back to the door, the light, your ordinary world,” Sherlock said, “only slightly the worse for wear.”
The hearth was cold.  Scattered over the pyramid of logs were the charred remnants of matches that had blown out, twists of paper that had turned to ash without producing a flame.
The fire disappeared and the music was lost in the clatter of carriage wheels over the cobbles outside our windows.
I inhaled the scent of his tobacco.  He’d taken to smoking other blends while he’d been away, sweeter ones, that spoke of his distant travels and reminded me of his long absence even while he sat in the same room enticing me with his aromatic smoke.
“I don’t have any shifts scheduled for a few days.  I’m sure I can arrange something for the later ones I’ve already agreed to.”  It would have been nice to have been asked first, I suppose, but why would he ask when he knows that where I want to be is with him?  His expression brightened somewhat, but he kept his eye on me when he resumed speaking.
“Why not the lights?” I set the harp on the floor and settled into my armchair.  There was a newspaper on the table next to it, but firelight wasn’t the best to read by.
The crowd closed behind him.  “You might feel differently by then.”  The words floated to us over the heads of the throng.  If he said more, it was lost as the musicians began again to play.
The lady with the embroidered cloak and her gentleman were standing.  He was untying the pale grey horse from the tree, the animal pawing the ground and tossing its head.  The woman was stroking the beast’s neck, leaning her face against its great head and it began to settle.
Sherlock was not sure John would wish to be kept.  He seemed too volatile to be confined.  And yet, he had held out his hand, turned his mouth to be kissed.  Sherlock rubbed his hand along the pollen-covered bark of the branch, held up his hand and licked the palm.  There was no mistaking John's taste.
The voice sounded deeper than John remembered.  He scowled, looked up slowly from beneath his furrowed brows.
He truly smiled at me then.   “When the time seems right, you will stand and begin to move, still beating out the tempo,” he explained through his curved lips.  “It will have become faster.”
“Some escaped piranha fish living here?” I quipped, feeling quite proud that I was able to.  I grasped the blade’s handle.
“These are delicate situations, assuredly,” I said, “but they happen.  People have pasts.  If there was a responsibility he wished you to discharge in his stead, he needed to let you know how to go about it.”
Sherlock raised his arm in that imperious gesture which summoned cabs out of thin air.  “Best not to speculate.  Whatever it is, I want to catch in on film,” Sherlock replied and opened the door of the cab that had obligingly pulled up to the kerb in front of Baker Street.
He huffed in a pretense of exasperation, but I could feel his muscles relaxing and he pulled his legs up onto the bench.  “Just for a minute.”
I tilted my head at Cattus when I passed him walking beside the donkey cart.  On the other side, leading the animal, was a husky man I assumed was Mato.  The cart's lantern lit the planks of the dock to either side and a good distance ahead.  I did not care for the way it made the darkness beyond look denser.
A plate of Mrs Hudson’s ginger biscuits had materialised on the table.  I took one as I passed.  Sugar would help.
I retraced my steps to his other side and undid that cuff.  The skin I could see was likewise unmarred.
“But there was only the faintest gleam of water visible in the distance from up there.”  I gestured towards the terrace steps.  “No wide river.  No landing.  No terrace.”
“Oh?  I thought I knew every corner of this park,” Madeleine replied.  She took the proffered hand, careful of the curved bluish nails.  She had a few scratches from those.
I peered through the dissipating smoke, saw the outline of the willow’s small branches waving in the air, catching fire one by one.
“Coming, Mrs H,” a voice said and the kitchen hallway door opened gradually as the rear end of Charlie appeared carrying a box.  It was filled with something that clanked and was quite heavy judging from the way he was holding it.
When I returned with it, I saw that Sherlock had pulled the coffee table flush with the sofa and stretched his arm across it, palm up.  The potato was in his hand.
I didn’t ask.  I’m not sure I wanted to know whether Wild-Eyed Jim had ever made Sherlock the least bit curious.
“You have not heard of the House of Usher,” Holmes stated, lowering the flame as the beaker’s liquid began to bubble.  “Their seat is in Usher Fell in the Lake District; if I had not known, the description would have informed me.  They have a manor house in the City, adjoining the Roman Wall, north of the Tower, one that did not burn in the Great Fire.  The funeral service will be in their crypt in the oldest part of the abbey where the pre-Norman foundations of the former monastery have endured.”
If I wrote the instant I awoke, I sometimes caught a glimpse of where I'd been in my dreams.  For so long, they had eluded me entirely.
“That I was young enough to take you as often as I want you,” I said and raised my hand a few centimetres off the cushions.  I couldn’t hold it aloft very long.  It dropped just above his knee.  Weakly, I gave his leg a squeeze.  He is just muscle and bone.  My hand slid away.
I saw nothing but the shadows of the branches, heard naught but the murmur of the stream.  I slumped against a tree, rubbed my forehead against the rough bark.
I stood over the box, one hand grasping the lid, whilst I caught my breath from taking the stairs two at a time.
“So that’s how they maintained the fiction for so long.  Madeline would come to London when Simpson would be back in England, which was not that often.  Wouldn’t the staff here wonder about the bloke that died here?”
"I was at home when you texted," Sherlock replied and glanced at the forensics team crunching across the gravel from the river stairs.
John drank the rest and put the mug in the basin.  “They do have a Greco-Roman vibe to them,” he said, without meeting her eye.
“Gabriel’s doing the front doors for some restaurant in Manhattan, I think he said it was.  I don’t have the details for Anji’s, except that it’s in Italy.  Anyway, Gabriel’s looking forward to meeting you tomorrow.  You can join us for lunch, I hope?” Mrs Hudson finished.
“A meal would not be amiss,” I replied and nearly smiled.  “Wouldn’t a gun have been more efficient?”
Near the top of the stairs, in languages I didn’t know, Sherlock’s parents were bidding their guests a cordial good-night. Mycroft stood to one side, leaning against the balustrade, nodding at times in silent accord and gazing out over the crowd at others.  No one intruded on his apparent distraction by addressing him.  If he acknowledged them, they nodded to him in return; if he didn’t, they nodded to themselves and passed on.  I wondered for whom he was searching; who it was they all seemed to know needed to be found.
The doublet fell to the ground.  From waist to brow, he reflected the moonlight, billowing sleeves rising and falling at his sides to the tide of the music.
My feet barely touched the stairs, so rapid was my descent.  I started to smile as I pushed the half open door wide.   I could smell the wood burning, hear the fire crackling.
I put the papers down in my lap and scowled.  “Could a storm do that to a stone building?” I asked, “even one in disrepair?”  I patted the papers on my knee.  “Do you think someone helped things along with a well-placed explosive?”
"Do you know how the creature was bringing bodies here...to now?" I asked, sitting on a stool and slipping the socks on.  I tried not to think about what might be dried into them and concentrated on how warm they were.
Wedged within the narrow compartment beneath the strip was a wad of yellowed cotton wool criss-crossed with scarlet thread and tied with an abundance of knots.
I sighed out the words, “Down in the woods.”  He had been under those trees needing a good sword hand while I was puzzling out what I was seeing.
Far in the distance, a light glowed, yellow and orange and white at its centre.  By it, I could see the fireplaces on either side of the room, both their hearths cold and dark.  The bench by the door was as I remembered seeing it last, but the workbench along the wall facing the door was gone.  The wall out of which it had been carved was gone.  The flint-paved floor sloped down to that distant firelight.
Sherlock buzzed and peered in multiple directions simultaneously.  “Yes,” he said, waving a leg and staring at the blur that sounded like Mycroft.  “What am I?”
“I would come and drink from you in your silken bonds,” Sherlock continued.  He held John tight against him.  “Or I would squeeze inside with you, so there would be no other space, just you, and me pressed into every nook and cranny of you.”
I thought the thickness of his coat must be a distinct advantage with such a pet and noticed the band was gone from her leg.
In the late afternoon, Mrs Hudson arrived with plates of sandwiches and fresh fruit and a pot of tea, advising me that Mrs Turner was much refreshed and enjoying having Mrs Hudson be her sous-chef for the time being.
I watched with fascination the progression of expressions on the man's face as Sherlock spoke, his words enunciated with his typical precision, their speed that of a native speaker of the tongue.
My head lolled against the window casement.  Each time I blinked, my eyes stayed closed longer.  Opposite me, Sherlock leaned his elbows upon the window sill, his face turned towards the terrace, a plate nearly empty of food I hadn’t seen him eat balanced on his lap.  I had, perhaps, kept my eyes closed longer than I had thought.
I conducted a self-examination before my shower.  That I had ejaculated was an understatement.  It almost seemed as though I had done so twice.  I even used a hand mirror.  There was dry semen everywhere, but my muscle was unstretched.  Perhaps it was an odd thing to do, but the dream had been powerful in its sensations.  It appeared that lavender had a hallucinogenic effect on me and an aphrodisiacal one as well.  I lathered and shampooed in the fragrance.
“You’re not actually injured, you’re feeling my injuries,” he answered, his fingertips rubbing circles at my temple.  “Of course, the shock of extreme pain could kill you.”
“Dr Watson’s stories are altered to protect those involved and those that cannot be thus disguised are left untold.  Do not let that concern you,” Holmes added.
I did not take offense at being likened to a goat or a sheep because the idea that I was being called home appealed to me.
John shifted his gaze to the keyboard over which there were two framed pictures: a line drawing of three animals merging together and a black and white photograph of a child in a feathery ballet costume.  John guessed that the latter was Ms Swann as a little ballerina.
The images returned:  motor accident victim, head injury, blood on the pavement.  Maybe they shouldn’t use police footage.
“After I found where you preened, I came to watch you swim with your flock.  They do well, but it’s so cold for them with so few feathers.”
When I had nourished myself to her satisfaction, she insisted I at least see the conservatories that we had not had time for the day before and so we did.
The wind whistled past the edge of the roof, rattling the bare branches of the moonlit trees that stretched in every direction below us.  I shoved my hands deeper in my pockets and looked up. The full moon held court in a sky wild with stars.  It was not a sky one could see in a city, not a modern one anyway.
It was my turn to hang fire while Corvus worked up the courage to speak his mind.  “What if it was someone else’s honour that he felt bound to defend…or…what if his secrecy was connected with his theory about the stones and the fungi, their sentience, their influence?  What if he didn’t want them to know?”  Corvus covered his eyes, his chest rising and falling erratically.  “You read…how it was with him.”  Finally, he looked towards Holmes again.  “This is why I have come to you.  If anyone can help me, it will be you.”  He turned to me.  “Then we won’t have to guess, we will know.”
I’d been through every scrap of paper, including the ones I’d already put in the recycling bag.  I’d even pried the carton sides away from the congealed stack of Strand magazines filling its bottom third, but the key I had not found.
I took a deep breath; the elixir had worked a rapid effect.  Bringing my cloak forward a little, I attempted to discreetly adjust myself.
“She was looking straight at me and her eyes were so sad,” I continued as I pictured them again, her light grey eyes so like Holmes’s.  “‘Who would like to pose their questions first?’ she asked and I felt my eyes widening with the fear that she would somehow lure me into taking the lead.”
“But it didn’t end there.  Several unsolved murders in the following years were blamed on this book.”
Bert stood up with similarly full pockets and found a knothole in the trunk near his side of the path and slotted his torch into it.
I felt a flush rising to my cheeks and steered the conversation in a different direction.  “Did you happen to mention this odyssey to Mrs Hudson?”
He looked up at the first floor windows.  The shutters were still closed.  He unfolded the note, glanced at the name written there and ran into the house, the glass in the fanlight rattling as he slammed the front door behind him.
John huffed.  “Yeah, OK.  I imagine that soaring over the park would have soothed my nerves more than stomping down to the pub.”
I put the paper and pencils down, walked around the bed, stopping by his outstretched arm.  I nudged and pulled until he was on his side again.  I paused, resumed breathing.  If he had been asleep, I had surely awakened him, but he showed no sign of it.  I took the arm that had had the mobile and positioned it along his side, let the forearm hang down near his waist.
He had turned away from the room, but he shook his head only slightly and smiled.  I saw no humour in his eyes.  We could be observed no matter which way we turned.
“Right,” I said, remembering the flowers that had sprang up in the wake of our dance steps at the ball.
“As a sea serpent should.”  Sherlock glanced at John.  “A creature best not aggravated, but a formidable ally.”
“Ah.”  Less nimbly, I disentangled myself from the herbage beneath me and stood.  Breathing was easier.  I stumbled.
No, not alone at all.  His partner of the moment had been wild for him but the dancer's eyes had stayed on me the whole time.  Skin gleaming, eyes gleaming, his panting loud above me.  I had reached up, touched his thigh.  Into whoever was on my lap, I had come.  My eyes had closed.  When I’d opened them again, my dancer was gone.
Smiling in return, I exhaled.  “'The Man with the Twisted Lip’ is one of my favourite chronicles of your adventures.”
“I hope you slept well,” she said.  “You’re as bad as Sherlock for staying up to the wee hours or beyond, but at least you take some rest afterwards.”  She was uncovering dishes as she spoke and fine fragrances were calling me to my seat at table.
Mrs Hudson nodded.  “Come down and have dinner.  We’ll open the windows in here and find you some clean sheets.”
The night grew quieter.  The halos of the streetlamps on the bridge seemed farther away as the lighted windows and portholes along the canal winked out.  A faint breeze tumbled dried leaves along the towpath, whispering as they went.  A fox rustled through the bushes.  A cat jumped down to the path from one of the boats and trotted away.
There was a drawing of the necklace that had been singled out for praise.  “That’s one of them,” I exclaimed.  “I recognise it from their photographs.”  I read some of the text.  “He does favour hyperbole.”  I sighed.  “The sisters parted with the jewels so light-heartedly.”
The figure halted and changed course towards us, arms already extended before he reached us.  “Mr Holmes, what a pleasure to see you again,” he said, clasping one of Sherlock’s hands in both of his.  “What brings you to us?”
“Except the one time when I fell out of a tree on the island and injured my arm.   He had to row the whole way back that day.”
“What?  We needed music for our entrance?” I joked, but Sherlock just prodded me and I opened the door.
“There is a practice range for firearms in the sub-basement.  Soundproofed, of course.  It’s best not to alarm the neighbours unnecessarily, although I do occasionally,” he said.
Despite the temporary refreshment of my shower, my fatigue had obviously reached the stage where my senses were not to be trusted.  I retreated inside, shut the door gently as though it might be thought rude to withdraw before...
It was the author, more than the consulting detective’s assistant in me, that spoke next.  “Did you record your thoughts contemporaneously or after events forced you from the house?”
Sherlock flitted towards the hearth on leathery wings, heard what he wanted half a metre up the flue.  He fluttered out, crouched, coat dragging along the floor, and reached up the chimney with a prudently gloved hand.
“So many departed lighter of spirit than when they arrived, and said so again and again as they bid us and you both, farewell.”  He inclined his head in my direction.  “You may have trouble finding places for the all the gifts.”
I stared.  Exiting or entering, Sherlock enjoys making an impression.  I hadn’t had the privilege of that view before, but I knew I would be able to draw it.  Anytime.  From now to forever.  From memory.
The light caught his eye over the rim of the crystal and I had the impression again of seeing the face of a clock in it.
No one stood around the fire.  Everyone had found a place to sit and await the dawn.  There was still a hum in the air, but much softer than before.
"There should be lanterns on the bridges, for a while anyway."  He lifted one oar out of the water and we turned slightly.
“If even half of these possibilities turn out to be true, he is a scoundrel of the worst sort, and should be apprehended as soon as possible,” I hissed.
The rain stopped.  I could distinguish Sherlock's face, pale in the gloom when he leaned away, clearer when he bent closer.  His eyes were in shadow, but his skin glowed.  I looked up again.  The stars blazed across the sky.  I nearly exclaimed aloud, but pressed my hand against my mouth at the last instant.  I glanced to either side.  There were branches in full leaf arching over the water.  We skimmed beneath them.  I reached out and caught at one, ripped off the tip of a branch.  The stars were bright enough for me to discern the shape of a willow leaf by their light.  I scanned the heavens, looking for constellations I knew.  I could barely restrain myself from whistling at the glory of it.  When I glanced at Sherlock, I could see that his eyes were closed.  Before us, there was fog floating above the water.
Excerpt:  I stared for a moment at him and his beautiful proportions. He looked back at me, standing still as a statue with the water sluicing over him, except that statues do not grow red and purple bruises across their perfect skin.
“I’m beginning to wish someone would put a stake through mine,” Sherlock muttered, snatching another biscuit.  “Time travel or an immortal being were the two hypotheses put forward.”  He looked across the table at me.  “We should consult them on our cases regularly.  They bring such a fresh perspective.”  He shoved the whole biscuit in his mouth.
John opened his mouth, gave a farewell lick before he sat up.  “Your favourite will have to wait until we’re healed.”
John finished swallowing another piece of toast and dusted the crumbs from his fingers over the plate.  “But later, we could find out how those things worked, although I don’t claim to have a clear grasp of either electricity or radio waves.”
“Two can play at this,” I said aloud and my arms wrapped about him.  I thrust upward with one hip and rolled us over.
Sherlock nodded.  “Lǎng gave it to me.  It’s his elder daughter, Zhen, performing, when she was still a student.  She teaches ‘round the corner at RAM now.”
There was no answer, but an increased flutter of wings.  Delicate legs walked along his shoulders, crept up his neck.  There was a bite, another, and another, twenty more.  John inhaled and held out his arms, palms up.  There were so many, he felt their weight upon his arms.  They were on his face, his lips.  He parted them and sunk to his knees.  Wings brushed against his chest.  He spread his legs.  Tiny legs and wingtips swarmed over him.  They stung everywhere.  His flesh swelled.  He groaned.
I studied him over the china.  Although the hollows of his cheeks were not nearly so pronounced, the shadows about his eyes remained.  He was not sleeping well; a fact to which the music I heard at all hours attested.  He paced as he played.  The music waxed and waned as he circled the room.  I heard it, that was, when I did not sleep through it, assuming, of course, that he played whether I was awake to hear it or not.  I frowned.  I was theorising without data on that.
I had not been told where to report for work, but the library or the laboratory seemed the likeliest.
“No ergot, which is the most common mould associated with hallucinations.  An array of the moulds found in dank places, mostly
“There we were, in the pleasant parlour of an eccentric stranger. Madame Willow explained to us that it was her older sister, Agnes, who acted as her spirit guide, a sister who had died at fifteen when they had both had scarlet fever.  She claimed that in her feverish dreams she had felt her sister drifting away from her and that she had reached out and clung to her with all the tenacity a stubborn, younger sibling could muster.  Her sister had insisted that she could not stay, but promised that she’d always come back if her dear Annabelle called her.  Madame Willow claimed that Agnes always had, although it had been years before she had shared that fact with anyone else.  Then, while we were all digesting that information, Madame Willow asked us to hold hands and we had, like obedient school children, complied.  She was very convincing.
Sherlock sat up.  Was that when John had covered him with pollen?  Sherlock could not remember.  Could John turn into a flower?  A bed of flowers?  A meadow’s worth of flowers, growing from the seemingly dead wood that covered the floors?
Baskerville looked in the same direction and ran ahead and round the clump of trees a couple times before I reached it.  Searching in the shade beneath the branches was a slow process and Baskerville had galloped off again before I found what I wanted.  I turned, waving the stick above my head for Baskerville to see.
The fire wasn’t large, but it was hot; the wood at the bottom a fierce orange that ignited fresh kindling in an instant, and larger branches soon enough.  Our little band was gathered around it, quietly drinking and eating, although Kit kept popping up to gather more deadwood from the edge of the clearing and Bert would go after him if he stayed away too long.
He turned and peered from underneath the towel.  A huge moth was circling the globe of the ceiling light.
“Oh, there was some arrangement when they built that,” Mrs Hudson said.  “When it was new, there was a private platform under the house.  That was part of the agreement, but that hasn’t been used in an hundred years, I think.  The tunnel and the tracks are still there though.”
It would not have surprised me to see a patent leather slipper and a stockinged shin appear atop the step.  Instead, a black-booted and trousered leg was our first glimpse of our visitor.  The rest of his person emerged in a graceful motion, clothed in contemporary fashion, his colours ebon.  He paused a moment on the pavement, then straightened his waistcoat and strode to our door.
It was an odd response, dropping his arms to his sides was what I had expected him to do so that I could remove the shirt completely.  The position reminded me of a bird shaking water from its wings and I found myself waiting for him to waggle his fingers to cast off the final drops.
“Once the lecture series is finished, we’ll go to Marsailles and take ship north.  It’ll be too warm for Florence until the autumn, whereas midsummer in Norway is quite delightful.  Hardly any night at all.  And we will resort to the sauna if the evenings are too cool for you.  You will like that.”
I was making a guess, no a deduction, about that stag being Duneyrr, and a moment later my deduction was confirmed.
John swung a leg athwart Sherlock’s hips, pressed his smooth groin against Sherlock’s curly one.  Hips rose to meet him.  A sinewy arm wound across his back.  The hips thrust higher, one shoulder, too. John looked up at the pale face that was now above him.
“Ah, there you are,” she said, setting a tray of covered dishes on the table where she had set the tea tray down the evening before.
“After calling on the Morrows, I felt I had to explore further.  I only just caught them before they departed for the Continent.  There were trunks and cases stacked in the foyer.  They were both going to stay for a few weeks with a friend who kept an apartment in Paris, then all were going on to Rome where another friend would rendezvous with them.  Further plans sounded like a long-delayed grand tour of sorts.”
That was the kind of lying detail Sherlock always talked about.  John wondered why Sherlock was doing it.
I took my seat and Corvus glanced at me as though to beg my pardon for excluding me from his pleading looks.
“Trust your ear.”  He leaned to the side and snapped off a long spike of small purple flowers as he went.  An inconvenienced bee buzzed after it.
Holmes was behind a newspaper again.  “I told her we might be away for some time and paid her two years rent in advance.  Despite being pleased with the economics of it, she said she would miss us if we were gone so long again.”
At first, John played soft, low sounds, a few notes up, a couple down, then up again.  A modified scale.
A person stood tall, arms high above their head, not far from where the mother remained watching her little boy atop the fire.
“Charm can be a dangerous thing,” she said, “but you look like you are more level-headed than to be taken in by it.”
“Yes,” I admitted, since there was nothing for it but to own up.  I searched my memory for traces of him in the tales, some charismatic seer or psychic.
And so I had returned once more to the library, with an expanded pharmacological aspect to my informal research objectives.  It was from these labours I had finally risen, stiff of neck and numb of buttocks, and decided I could make my way up to the roof and back without getting lost and having to summon Mrs Hudson from her slumbers.  It was approaching midnight and out the window I could see that the moon was just cresting the housetops.  The sky was clear and as far as I could hear, there was no wind.  All seemed auspicious for my journey.
As I went to join them, I saw behind her the glowing embers in the hearth and the pot simmering over it.
“You didn’t have time to make this,” I said, squinting at the red jewels embedded either side of the golden head.
When I looked, snowflakes were gathering on the shawl of the woman by her doused fire.  She got up, dusted off her skirt, shouldered the satchel her friends had packed for her and turned towards the western path where they were waiting.
“It will take years more before my explanation would truly make sense to you, so suffice it to say that they waste vast amounts of energy because they don’t know how to apply it…nor where.”
The full moon hung above the trees, huge and brilliant.  Beneath it, the fire roared, licking up the trunk of the oak.  Its bark had turned to burning embers.
I moved over to centre myself in front of the target and he stepped aside.  I shifted the knife from one hand to the other, unsure which I would use.  When it comes to throwing things, I’ve always been ambidextrous.  I chose the left and threw.  The blade struck within the outline, a little to one side, where the left eye would have been.  I glanced at him.  I thought he might smile; it had been a very good first throw.  Instead, he scowled.
I thought it best not to drink it, but touched it to my lips and smiled in thanks.  Though the coins may have included refreshments, I felt inclined to offer something in return.  A packet of mints in my jacket pocket appeared to have withstood my dousing, so I peeled back the foil wrapper and took one of the candies to demonstrate its edible nature and offered the open roll to my host.
Also, it was in the kitchens, I had met the elusive others who dwelt in the Manor, consistently or occasionally, and who were, therefore, my patients.  Billy and his nephew, Archie, who made the gardens grow, were often to be found there and eager to tell tales of their leafy domain, or in Archie's case, the latest botany or biology exam for which he was studying.  Wiggins and members of the Irregulars would flit in and out between their errands and information gathering all over the city and sometimes beyond.  They were less likely to share a story, obviously accustomed to silence and invisibility.  Discretion was clearly their watchword and I was new.  I would patch them up or prescribe a medicine or ointment if necessary when I encountered them, but they did not seek me out.  Thus, day by day, the roster of my patients had grown.  As well as sharing a meal and conducting an impromptu surgery, there was always history to be learned in the kitchens and they had many doors.  I was still learning where they were and where they all went.
The water had reached Fucker’s neck now and still he walked along the river bottom towards us, hands above his head now, clapping.
“Oh, John, I’m glad you’re home,” Mrs Hudson said, coming out her door, a wave of ginger and cinnamon following her.  “Have you told many people that you’ve moved back?”
I know nothing about this scientist except that he writes monographs on arcane subjects that he posts on his website, his housekeeper used to be Mike’s patient and Mike thought she was a nice lady.
“Yes,” I admitted, my hand slipping under my jacket to where my heart was hammering.  The case with the photographs rubbed against my knuckles.  Despite his more indulgent attitude since his return, I felt sure Holmes would find every bit of what I’d done foolish and not hesitate to say so.
But Sherlock and I had been travelling alone for hours and that had suited me better than a gaggle of strangers.
I did not rush after him; my brain and my body were slowing down.  I needed to last just a little longer.
My lips parted, but I seemed unable to sing or even hum and my clothes remained stickily upon me, except for my tunic and shoes which I had succeeded in divesting with the little dexterity remaining to me.
He had stood still for me, bright in the sunlight, cool skin flushing with returning heat beneath my fingers as I had gone on.  It had been he that had sighed then as I stroked and probed; he that had gestured towards the bed as my examination descended down the backs of his thighs.  Thorns had lightly scored the skin there, worse having been avoided only by the sturdiness of his trousers, since he had given no care for brambles once a possible clue had been spied.
Calendars have become less relevant to me than they were in the past.  I have undertaken journeys with destinations that have been when as much as where.  I have seen a hydra with my own eyes and helped to slay it so that neither of us lost any flesh to the beast.  I do not think the date upon which we slew it mattered, but there might be a significance to the time of death I did not yet understand.
I watched him, tall and lithe, turn from it and I strummed the strings of the harp a little faster as I gazed at him.
I peered at the darkness near the horizon and saw nothing but the undulating tree tops.  And then, a glimmer, a flicker in the dark.
Then, the years scattered us.  All round the world it seemed.  Murray had ended up in Afghanistan, too, and that had been lucky for me.
I gazed north again.  The air was violet, the stars white sparks burning through it.  The rosy glow had blossomed.  I twisted to face it fully.  Wisps of green smoke curled above the trees.
“For what?” I asked quietly, peering around us for a glimmer of light.  I found it above, sparkling through the skylight.
And then he murmured something I couldn’t hear except for the word ‘father’ and I understood why Sherlock hadn’t reduced this reptile to heap of ash.
How he played me.  I was trembling with the effort to utter no sound and make no sudden movements.  For him, silence seemed second nature.
I closed the lab notebook, rose from my seat and stretched, vertebrae crackling.  There was more research I wanted to do, but my head felt heavy and I thought some fresh air would clear it.  Since out was not an option, I decided to go up.
“The whole terrace does, but I’ve given up storing anything there.  Metal rusts, everything else moulders.  They were for coal, you know.  Some people have waterproofed them, but tanking is expensive and I don’t think it’s worth it for storage.”  She blew across her tea and the steam wafted towards me.  “I may have to do 221C though, or I’ll never find a tenant.”
I could not argue.  My muscles relaxed further with each degree the temperature climbed.  My leg was hardly troubling me at all.
My eyes searched for the landmarks they knew so well in vain.  None of the coloured lights that garland a city street lent their glow to the view below me.  No headlamps reflected in shop windows.  No well-lit buses growled by.  Only the moon outlined the bare crowns of innumerable trees and elicited a faint glimmer from a waterway that wound beneath them and out of sight.
Such as that my melodic skills aren’t all I thought they were?  Opening and unlocking, after all, had been among the first tunes I had learnt and I fancied I used them rather well.
“He didn’t tell Father what was in the box,” Sherlock deduced, flitting from the trunk to the low branches that swept to the ground behind Mycroft then back again.  He gazed at his brother.  “Puck didn’t tell you directly.  He wouldn’t be that brazen,” Sherlock buzzed through another circuit, his wings those of a bumblebee.  “So how have you learned of the box’s alleged contents.”  He hovered in front of Mycroft on the wings of a hummingbird hawk-moth.  “Ah.  Mummy.  Puck told his Queen and you ‘overheard’.”
I walked to his other side and placed my hands so they would support the violin as I might an infant.  He loosened his fingers and I eased the instrument away, laid it to rest in the case as well.
Cold mud squelched between his toes.  He followed the edge of the stream cautiously.  Twigs bent beneath his soles, rounded pebbles pressed up against them.  He bruised his shins on rocks, some jagged, others mossy and slick under his groping fingers.  He regained his balance each time, inched forward, clasped the broad trunk of a tree overhanging the bank, edged his way around the landward side of it, feeling for the roots with his feet.  When the number of steps he had taken would have brought him beyond the Marylebone Road if he had been outside, he paused again.
“Of all the things you saw last night, that’s the one you want to ask about first?” he said, the lines about his eyes crinkling in mirth.
I reached out and caught him round the thighs, guided him down.  He landed in a tangle, knocking the air out of me.  I grasped him more firmly; he was half on the bench, half off.
I huffed and leaned against the nearest tree to wait, ears pricked and gaze wandering over the gathering.
“You can have your blade in a moment,” Sherlock said.  “Only three more, but you need to turn over for me to do them.”
Sherlock shipped the oars and seized the spear.  My stomach sank when I saw him stand, stance wide for balance in the rocking boat.
I coughed and leaned forwards, glanced from side to side.  All the fires, were being extinguished, with water and dirt, tamped down by boots.
His fingers pushed beneath my collar, rubbing and squeezing the muscles at the top of my shoulders.  He was using both hands now.
He considered the drawings.  “Great likeness of Sherlock, you caught that superior expression of his, but Christ those veins are creepy.”  Greg glanced at the painting of the skull and the skull over the desk.  “Fits right in though.”  He nodded, looked at each of us, opened his mouth, closed it again.
I managed to move one hand enough to grasp above his knee.  I felt his muscles flex as he rose and fell.  I wanted to join him, to thrust up, wrap my legs around his back and pull him down, but I didn’t have the strength.
A black-gloved hand came around Culvert’s face from behind, another pulled his arm around his back, and judging by his grimace, yanked it up high.  “I think you’ve said enough for tonight,” Lestrade said, his features still half-hidden by his mask.  “But we’ll give you a chance to say more tomorrow and all the tomorrows after.”
He picked up his violin case.  “How do you think we can get to the next room?” he asked in an almost playful tone, but the look in his eye remained thoughtful.
“I didn’t.  He happened to walk through the park after you had retrieved the box, your glow bright on his phone.  So I did some investigative listening,” Mycroft replied.  “You know he writes, don’t you?  Has a little following on the internet.” Mycroft ruffled his feathers.  “Far from the magnitude of Father’s darling, but writers are dangerous, and the internet makes them even more so than the printing press did.”
"Aidan, good morning.  Can the Natural History Museum do without you for a few hours?  I have something with many features of interest over at Bart's morgue," Sherlock said.
Mycroft’s silvery glow lit up the bandstand by the lake.  Night-blooming jasmine and honeysuckle grew up its pillars and snaked across its roof, the scent of their flowers radiating into the darkness.  The hum of thousands of moth wings filled the air, pierced by the occasional note of a sleepy bird.
The music faded away and we stood still.  About us, no one chattered.  The air quivered in the silence.
John closed his eyes for a moment as his perineum was thoroughly cleansed.  “But I’m your doctor,” he offered weakly.
When voices began to be heard from within the towers by the gate, Sherlock joined us to say that Mato refused to take us outside the city walls through the cemetery beyond, however, he had been amenable to exchanging the cart and the net for the rest of the pennies and our cloaks, which had been serving to cover the creature.
I took another sip of tea and picked up the knife. The smear of blood on it was disappearing into the blade.  “What is it made of?”
My demure pursuit ended in the darkest corner of the room.  I pressed my palms flat on his chest and parted the feathers further.  My mouth joined my hands.  Suckling and nipping at the skin I laid bare, I chased the chill on his skin away.
I concluded that our renown had reached and made a favourable impression on Mr Braithewaite, however, from his enthusiastic handclasp and his rather awestruck gaping at Sherlock.  Braithwaite was a man of middle-years, of about my height, although considerably rounder and sparser of hair than I.  He emphasised the word pleasure in response to making our acquaintance, but with a meaningful glance at our surroundings indicated that he could not say as much as he would have liked due to the circumstances.
John giggled as Sherlock’s nose tickled beneath his arm.  “Ah, I don’t think the deodorant is meant to be ingested.”
The last bit's a new habit that I blame on my therapist.  Blog, she urges.  I haven't typed a single word that I didn't delete soon after, well, as soon as I figured out how to do it, but I’ve started thinking in narrative, describing experiences to myself, no matter how mundane, hoping to concoct something I can post to get a respite from her soft-voiced insistence that I should blog.
“Formerly, it was customary for cousins to marry.  If there was one of a suitable age, they would be the preferred match,” Mycroft continued.
Against the backdrop of my closed lids, I saw a boy staring into a shop window aglow with colours, wheels and rows and pyramids of inks and paints, brushes and easels and palettes, and an open treasure box with tiers of coloured pencils.  “Faber-Castell,” each pencil whispered from behind the glass.  “My name is Faber-Castell.”
I stepped over the flattened section of the low railing that divided the grass from the walkway and ran my hand along the edge of the long tear.  It had hurt.
John looked down at the table and shook his head.  “People say all sorts of things when they’ve had one too many.” He wiped away a circle of condensation from the wood. “Anyway, I can see why the estate agent told her she’d have to paint the whole place magnolia before putting it on the market and I can see why she showed him the door.  I’m surprised she didn’t shove him out a window.”  John crumpled the wet serviette.  “A lot of it’s Gabriel’s work, her sister’s grandson, if I’ve got the family tree straight, the rest was done by his classmates and friends.  She clearly doted on the lot of them.”
I checked the water again to see if Fucker was going to pop out of it, applauding his own performance.
Sherlock glanced at John and got up, dusting off the knees of his trousers.  “Well, if that swan’s taken up residence at the Pond, it might be best to give it a wide berth.”
“Later,” he said.  “Try them.  Choose the fingers.”  He moved his own slightly and the metal tinkled.
There wasn’t much in it.  He couldn’t have made a huge withdrawal or even a moderate one.  The scarcity of my funds should have made each pound more precious, I suppose, but where suspicion should have been, there was a pleasing sensation, as though he had touched me after all.
If it is, I refuse to rouse myself from it, for it is here on Baker Street with Sherlock Holmes that I wish to dwell.  Here, where his music curls up the stairs like smoke.  Here, where I leave my door ajar for it.  And here, where if I awake at night with a cry from a desperate scramble up a stony defile, his music can quell the roar of falling water and lull me gently into dreamless repose.
He turned his gaze back to Sherlock, but seemed to continue addressing me.  “I’ve been waiting for an answer from him for years, but he’s such a difficult butterfly to pin down.”
They proved intricate, those kitchen locks.  So, for a long time, I could only visit the kitchens after daybreak.  I was rather proud of my first successful nocturnal foray.
Mrs Hudson ducked inside.  “That was the marvellous thing.  I let the flat today and he took it ‘as is’.  I can hardly believe it.”
“Assault, rape, blackmail – yes, he must have tasted dreadful, but he was threatening me.  River takes that very seriously.”  We had reached the door.  “The rain will help wash it away.”
“Next was Kate Whitney.  She placed a small pistol on the table and gave it a little push.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Mary wince as the gun skittered past her.  Madame Willow released Mary’s hand and stopped the gun from falling off the table.  She didn’t pick it up or rest her hand on it as she had with the letters and the shawl, however.
The cool weight of Lady Holmes’ hand disappeared from my shoulder.  Its ache vanished with it.  “Best not to lose the current.”
It had the aroma of a boiled apple seasoned with spices and possibly a liqueur, but the yellow skin appeared firm and the stem with its single leaf looked as though it had been brushed with gold leaf.
"No, their lives ended quite locally," Sherlock said, "but not now.  That's why no record of them has survived, regardless of nationality, just like the others."
“It was this house that Dr Adamantine hoped to be given, not merely because it is in London, but because he wished to look for these.  There was always the chance that they had been at Usher and therefore were no longer a threat to him, but it was equally likely that they were somewhere in the city, in a safety deposit box, with a solicitor or among the papers here.  If we had not been with Corvus, Adamantine would have inveigled his way into this house and tried to search,” Sherlock explained.
I sniffed the steam from the tea and closed my eyes.  A wall of roses unfurled their petals, golden in the sunshine.  A breeze plucked at their petals, blowing some towards me.  One landed in my palm.  I rubbed my fingertip over the pale velvet of it and took a deep breath.  Rose entered me.  I sighed and opened my eyes.
I took a deep breath and hesitated to continue, less sure of the second verse.  The violin wove the melody into another shape; mist rolled over green hills, sandstorms scoured rocky crags.  The familiar tune returned and the words came to me.
Holmes glanced from the newsprint to me and back.  “You consulted a spiritualist,” he stated matter-of-factly.
My hand closed about my dagger.  A second later there was a thud.  Sherlock drew back.  My blade quivered in the wood of the bench less than two fingers' breadth from where his face had been.  Pinned by the point of the dagger, a small, serpentine thing writhed.  It did not appear to be attached to anything other than the wood.
Above the northern woods, the sky rippled.  Between the trees, a hint of rose outlined the bare branches
She tilted her head.  “Close to ten years now since I came back from Florida.  It took me a while to sort everything out after Frank’s execution.”  She shook her head.  “Time does fly.”
I took a few steps further into the room.  I could almost hear the music waiting to be played.  I pivoted slowly, cataloguing details.  I was not assessing or doing anything practical like seeing if I could identify the panel through which we had gained access to the room.  It had closed without my noticing it, as camouflaged now as it had been in the library, as if leaving was not an option.
“A smuggling case took me deep beneath the abbey years ago where I saw the family crypt,” Holmes explained, “and the Ushers have made significant, if esoteric, contributions to the field of music composition and theory through the generations.  I’ll play one of them for you sometime.”  He put a stopper in the phial and shook it.  “Although perhaps on a sunny day to counteract its mood, the airs tend towards the melancholy.”
I nodded at Kit and he moved towards them.  I followed behind in the torch’s light.  After us, Bert and Wiggins fell in.
I stayed well away from the edges of the bridge as there were no railings, but I could see that there were flowers growing along the moat's banks and ducks swimming in it.  A deep breath affirmed that the air lacked the stench usually associated with moats.
Sherlock stood in the doorway.  “Get your harp,” he said, “I’m going to show you something else music can do.”  He strode towards the far side of the room without another glance at me.
I snatched my hand away from the paling and turned to find an older woman smiling at me from the open doorway.
The moonlight lit half of Sherlock's face.  His expression was intent, his eyes open.  He seemed to be steering the boat, more than propelling it with the oars.  I wished I could assist, but I estimated that my silence was the most I could contribute.
He waved a hand at the room and nodded.  “You are to make yourself at home.  I only ask that you be mindful of my experiments if you choose to use the laboratory.”
I eased back under the covers.  “All right, then, Barrows will keep track of the little girl until Corvus can go to claim her.  But I still don’t see why Madeline did not clear everything up regarding her child once her mother had died and avoid…all this.”
“And they’re cherry branches, right?”  John asked, carving another slice from the leg of lamb on the platter in the middle of the table and adding it to the gravy on his plate.
My tongue flicked over my lips.  It’s an awful tell, but I managed to shift my gaze to the leather-bound book to which Sherlock’s attention had returned.  “You have a talent for acquiring things people have tossed away.”
There it was.  I opened my mouth and closed it again.  I had succumbed to the same combination of beauty and bereavement, although Mary had not been helpless in the aftermath of her father’s death nor so stricken by it as Corvus clearly was by the loss of his…
“Here we are,” Mrs Hudson sang out from the ginger-scented cloud surrounding her.  She set the plate in the middle of the table, maybe a little nearer Sherlock than me, and resumed her seat.  “I didn’t tell you her cousin’s theory.”  She turned to Sherlock.  “Eat a biscuit, dear.  You’ll need strength for this one.”
John stretched towards the nightstand.  “Because you told me,” John said, grabbing the slim bottle there, “and I was listening.”   He poured oil into his cupped hand, slathered it over his abdomen, down under his balls and up his cock.  He darted a glance at Sherlock, settled back on his heels and poured more oil over his hand.  “My arm around your waist would not be a pleasant thing right now.”  John rubbed the dripping oil over his thighs and back up over his cock.  “My hands on your hips though…”  John patted his thighs.  “Care to come closer, Mr Holmes?"
Mike had a smile on his face when he turned around.  “Thank you for joining me for this,” he said, walking back from the edge of the platform to the table.  “They appreciated hearing from someone with field experience.”
Sherlock appeared from the bushes, leaves in hair and cap in hand.  He held it out to me.  It was brimming with berries, red and purple and black.
“Oh, um, hello.”  The man standing in the hall peered around John into the apartment.  “Is Madeleine back?”
Corvus had turned to me when I spoke.  He held his hands out, palm up.  “Maybe with more time, without his sister also being so ill, he would have.  I don’t know.  Perhaps his father had had a natural child, a much younger sibling for whom Roderick was responsible.  He rarely spoke of his family.  He had visited mine during some of the shorter school holidays, but I had never been invited to met his.  Although I thought his father died one summer while we were at school, I have no recollection of him having told me that or of his appearing to grieve.  Maybe I heard of it from our schoolmates somehow.”
The blood was following the tracery of our lines through the air above them and turning an ashen grey as it proceeded.  From them, a faint odour of charred flesh rose up.
“Not like he used to when he was a child,” she said.  “When I was a girl, we would go for the whole summer.  It was glorious.”
Greg stepped back.  “No, thanks.  I’ll stick to selfies.”  He took another step towards the door.  “Besides, I like to keep my internal organs internal, if you know what I mean.”
“Yes, but I had just solved a rather big problem for them and I said I wanted to dissect him.  They did not want to deny me such a small thing,” Sherlock said, pushing the lever up.  “They offered me another from the litter since their bodies had been frozen, but I said I preferred a fresh sample.  They seemed satisfied with that.”
We were in the middle of the room when I next noted my surroundings, and I realised there was a space opening as the crowd moved back in silence.  The music, too, had stopped.  I thought the air might have left with it.  I looked at Sherlock, solemn and pale, and squared my shoulders, dipping my chin so infinitesimally, only Sherlock could possibly have detected it.
I was damp and fragrant as I stared out the balcony doors and rubbed the towel over my hair.  The moon was high enough to brighten the upper half of the courtyard’s eastern side.  The bare branches of the climbing vines cast gnarled shadows on the wall.  The garden below was dark except for the glitter of the fountain’s spray and a few gleams on the wet curves of the statues surrounding the central pillar.
"They've begun to regenerate," he said, "every single one of them.  And the parts we removed from the body this morning, may well do the same."
“Shit,” John muttered under his breath.  He hadn’t read the instructions on how to manually adjust the focus.  The blur resolved.  A man in a cap and knee-length coat balanced on the top of one of the posts for an instant, before climbing onto the low balcony.
John crammed the note into his pocket, wedged the tin under his arm, and grabbed his cane.  It was a long way up to his room, but it was a world better than the anonymous bedsit lined like a casket that he had endured for two months, even if its building had had a lift.
“When I was watching that through the viewfinder, I was telling myself the camera was malfunctioning,” John said.
He pointed to each of us in turn.  “Just make sure you come back from Marseille with all your internal organs in place.”
Sherlock shook his head.  His phone beeped and he opened a new file of photographs.  A wing had been recovered from the shrubbery along the river walkway and it appeared to be retaining its form.  Its edges gleamed a golden brown in the photograph, its translucent centre revealed the foliage beneath it.
I climbed back up to the landing, turned into the library and set the basket down by the coffee table with as little clatter as I could manage.  “What all is in here…”
He lifted an arm.  Without warning, I felt his hand curled around my neck, a couple fingers slipping beneath my collar.
The legends that clung to the ordinary building before me included vengeful ghosts and seductive witches, mad scientists and monsters, werewolves and warlocks, vampires and savage beasts and those were just the stories
The images changed again.  The hearts framed a face I recognised from my morning mirror, even in profile.  His robes were dark.  In his upraised hand was a handgun I knew almost as well as the lines of my face. Its muzzle pointed upwards.  The face turned towards me and kept turning until it faced right and then it smiled; the figure climbed out of the frame, one foot balanced on the point of the adjacent ace’s central diamond.  Nimbly, he jumped and landed crouched at the foot of the knave of diamonds, who drew a violin and bow from beneath his robes and began to play.  The knave of hearts settled on the ground, his gun balanced on one knee.  He tilted his head back, expression rapt, to watch the bow dance over the violin's strings.
I glanced at the sky; the clouds were drifting off.  I looked back at the water.  It was bright with the moonlight.  No more rain fell.
There she lay, in silver and black pieces, clasped by the black velvet.  He traced the threadbare edges of the indentations where the white backing was showing through the nap, eased the bell out of its niche.
I had slept there.  In the morning light, I had made my way home and slept in my bed for what seemed like a week until my training started.
John banged on the window of Speedy’s and dashed behind the counter as soon as Mr Chatterjee unlocked the door.
Mrs Hudson’s grip tightened on the frying pan.  She took a step into the dusty room.  “Sherlock?” she whispered.
The striking of a tambour drew my attention away.  The drummer sat on a log at the edge of the clearing, striking his instrument alternately with the heel of his palm and the tips of his fingers.  People were sitting, here and there, on other logs or stretched out on the grass.  Some rose to dance as the drummer played.
He lifted the computer bag from my shoulder.  It was a welcome relief.  I didn’t notice where he set it, but he was in motion again.  Metal slid along metal; heavy curtains parted.  Pale light illuminated the lacy patterns over the glass doors that were revealed.
John shook his head.  “I came round here to see if the bloke had somehow gone in this direction without my seeing him, even though I didn’t think it likely.  When I didn’t see him around here, I called Ms Swann to check whether she got home safely.  Happily, she answered.  I asked her to phone me if anything unusual happened before five, otherwise we’d see her then.”
“My parents ran the shop; my mother handled the bookkeeping and the ordering.  My father made up the bouquets and did some cross-breeding in the little greenhouse out back of the shop and my sister was born,” she said.  “That’s when I started coming back to spend the summers with my grandparents here or in France.  Nan said it gave Mama some time alone with Lily, like she had had with me.  I did that every year until Papa got a very good offer for the shop and decided he would take it and we would emigrate to Canada.  After that it was too far to visit every year.  In fact, I didn’t until I came for Da’s funeral.  I had already moved to New York by then.  I had dreams of dancing on Broadway, you see.”  She sighed.  “Life does take some unexpected twists and turns.”
Keeping it that way will be harder at Westbourne Park.  I’ll be at the entrance to her building at five. SH
, outraged missives posted to the publisher.  He was accused of promoting immorality, so, of course, everyone wanted this obscure series of transcribed medieval manuscripts for their home library.  The first printing sold out quickly, and a second printing was promptly run, but before it could be distributed to booksellers, every book in the set was banned."
By the gate, we dispersed to wait.  Mato fed his donkey and the rest of us leaned against the wall to take a bit of rest, except for Sherlock, who checked each of the knots attaching the net we had used to lift the beast from the river to the posts of the cart.  It made me wonder whether Sherlock was convinced the animal was dead and whether he thought it might be able to untie the knots if it was not.
The fabric of his shirt was stretched across his shoulders and the breeze had ruffled his hair, forming his curls into a wild halo around his head.
My smile disappeared.  I imagined walking forward a few paces and turning back to find Mrs Hudson gone, the door closed and locked, and no answer when I knocked.
I hummed my assent around the forkful of fish I had already put in my mouth.  “How was Wiggins able to do it so quickly and quietly?” I managed to say after a minute.
"London's risen," Sherlock murmured, more to himself than to us, it seemed.  "A basement level, most likely."  I could not catch what he said after that.  It blended into a pleasant hum as of a bee among flowers.
“I experimented a little,” she replied, flushing.  “Once I had the formula, it wasn’t hard, but none of my attempts to replicate it on my own ever worked.”
“Ship fires in Marseille harbour?” I asked, closing one hand around the box of tea and the other around my mug.
Sherlock glided over to his seat, and John arranged himself by the desk with notebook and pencil to hand.
lit up on the screen.  I glanced over at Sherlock and caught the side of his grin.  Maybe I’d try to draw that aboard ship.
My feet gave twinges of protest, but I set upon the dinner with renewed gusto so we could get back to it and had nearly emptied my plate when two sharp raps reverberated through the door.
“Quite new,” Sherlock replied.  “Well, from my childhood.  I did most of my early experiments in the kitchens, before the lab was set up.”
A yell rose up from the corner.  John spared a glance in that direction.  There was a crowd gathering near the kerb.  A flame shot up and the crowd fell back.
“Why don’t I put that up in your room for you, Doctor…John?” Mrs Hudson said and tapped my other arm.
"Oh, no you don't," I called, rushing to join him.  "You are not lifting anything until I have you somewhere where I can  check your ribs properly."
I did, opening my eyes.  Sherlock was on one knee before me, buckling something about my hips.  I looked down, avoiding staring directly at the rich darkness of his curls as he bent to his task.  I checked what was bumping against my thigh.  It was the scabbard and sword he had shown me earlier.
Kit found a knot hole for his torch and began searching the ground on his side of the verge.  After a minute, he held his hand out towards me.  In his palm, was an acorn.
“Chapalu’s been busy,” Greg replied before swooping down and capturing the tart.  “Every year, I forget how good these are, especially with this.”  He took a long drink of wine and looked over at me.  “Pity you and Sherlock missed it last year.”
She shook her head.  “I don’t go every year anymore.”  She patted her hip.  “I’ll hear all about it over breakfast.”
Sherlock propelled the boat through the water with an economy of motion that was thrilling to behold.
He minimised the video and opened another window.  It was a slide show of frames from the video.  Slowly, Sherlock clicked through them.  They were all side views until the subject was on the balcony and then the view was from the back.
John trained his field glasses on the curve of the Pond directly across from their perch.  “She’s talking to a woman with a camera hung around her neck,” John observed.
Sherlock touched the thorn to his tongue.  “Someone else stepped on this and cursed it,” he said, and licked the length of the thorn.  It hissed.
“You have a nice way with words, John,” Mrs Hudson said, “and, if I’m not mistaken, there are a few figures in among the branches on your walls that weren’t there before.”
I considered his priapic state and stroked a hand over the insistent evidence of mine.  “Something to take the edge off?”
“You have a specific half smile for when people admire your literary efforts,” he replied.  “Mind the push pins when you sit.”
When we had cleared the throng, I turned around again and stared.  Although I knew the tree was at the middle, from where I stood it looked as though it could have been beyond the people.  The ground was so flat, one couldn’t see that the crowd encircled it.
There were berries and pieces of fruit small enough that I could not tell what they were at a glance, so I sampled them, one by one.  Pear, blood orange, white peach and pomegranate.  Their juices mixed together like an elixir.  I took sips of wine between bites of fruit and at the end I chased the last pomegranate seed around the bowl until I had caught it and swallowed it.
“I adapted another one of Zhen's compositions for the violin,” Sherlock said, instead of answering.  “Would you like to hear it?”
“With Redbeard, it was the colour.  His clothes were always russet.  A thick, knitted jumper with corduroy trousers for winter and oxblood shoes, and for the summer a brushed cotton shirt and denim trousers, brown denim, a rusty brown, and leather sandals.  He preferred to be barefoot most of the time though.”  Sherlock rubbed his fingertips against his palm.  “I can still feel the textures.”  His brow furrowed.  “Maybe his clothes weren’t really that colour.  Maybe they just looked that way to me.”
The sleeping child had awakened and stood beside his mother, dancing a little from foot to foot, and tugging on her hand.  The woman rose, then bent down and hefted the child to her hip.  He was on the cusp of being too big for her to carry, but he grinned as he clasped his arms around her neck and his feet around her waist.
“My aim is true,” I said.  “Let me show you.”  I thrust with vigour against his smooth skin, perceived the muscles rippling beneath it with the most sensitive part of me.   My lips sought the warm join of his neck and shoulder, found it and bit down there.
“This location makes the most sense.  The security is excellent and when she wasn’t here, she usually wasn’t far,” Sherlock said.
He leaned back against the carriage seat and steepled his fingers at his chin.  “You can judge for yourself in a few months.”
“Yes, of course.  Black denim, black long-sleeved shirt open at the collar, black shoes, a black cap, it shaded the top of his face that day.”
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock said, holding the thorn up for me to inspect.  It was dry and brown, an inch long, thick at the base and needle thin at the end.  It looked as though it had come out whole.
Sherlock dismissed it.  The strength of the instinct to display held his attention though.  His wings grew dark; he added snowy edges and expanded their span even more.  He dipped and swirled about the light.  It showed the swallowtail shape of his wings to good advantage.
“I was catching my breath, my shirt-tails covering my satiated cock...which was a good thing because I was too tired to tuck myself away.   My eyes were half-closed…”  All around me the night had been moving.  In the middle of the clearing, there had been a dancer.  Pale, pale, like the moon overhead.  With the sway and twirl of the dance, garments had fallen away.  The beautiful dancer was a he.  “...and I saw a moonbeam dance.”  I lifted my free arm, stretched out my fingers.  “I wanted to go to him, but I couldn’t get up.  I had no strength for it and then someone warm and fragrant settled on my lap and one part of me seemed to have the strength the rest of me lacked.”  My arm fell back onto the root.
His serpent uncoiled from around his neck and spiralled down his arm.  Sherlock’s gaze dropped from my eyes to my mouth.
I twisted around.  Barely visible next to the door, was a bracket, and in its metal basket…something.  I reached up, grasped the something…a wooden something, and pulled it out.
“Shall we repair to our campfire?  Wiggins will have it going well by now.  You’ll feel the chill when we emerge into the open.” He turned towards the woods and I turned with him. “We can finish our wine while we wait for the moon.”
Sherlock pulled me lower still.  My knees buckled and I half fell on him.  I slid down to sit on the floor.  My head was on his shoulder, his on mine.  One of his arms was around me.  It was a parody of dancing, a still life, except for the rise and fall of our backs as we pulled in air, and the knife in my outstretched hand.
I sat back on my knees.  Sometimes an image just hits me and Sherlock lifting a candied flower to his lips was a vivid one.
The light shifted and I saw it.  Beside Sherlock, a narrow band of darkness was curling up from the bench towards the smooth planes of his cheek.
“Someone to put in the path of one of our parents, perhaps.  They do so love to collect interesting humans,” Mycroft offered.
‘Seeing red’ is an expression I’ve heard all my life.  I’d never actually seen it before though.  Woo him away, would they?
“When would that have been?” I asked, taking a sip of the tea.  It was always better than mine, even when she used teabags.
I sniffed.  I smelt the spices along with the yew and juniper and pine.  I rubbed my head against the log.  Its bark was very smooth.
“John,” he said, rising from his seat.  “Get your materials.  It is time to put the pieces together.
Ms Swann’s eyes were wide when she turned to Sherlock.  “No!  I…my reasons haven’t changed.”  She took a breath and looked back at the water.  “Whether the swan is a previously unrecorded mutation or hybrid or…” She waved her hand.  “…doesn’t matter.  I’d thought it might be a possible explanation for…”  She fell silent.
“I’m not even sure I’m awake,” I said, running my hand over a dry patch on my belly.  “Time for a trip to the hammam to clear the brain and loosen the limbs?”
For an instant, the moon cast the other animal in silhouette before it streaked across the ground after Baskerville.
She looked down at her cup.  “Kit,” she said.  “He was skin and bones when he got here.  Mrs Turner and I saw to that right quick, but it took a while to feed him up.”
He had noticed the little pot the day the old bookseller disappeared in my study and I had fainted.  I am not embarrassed at my response.  I would not have been ashamed of an even more intense reaction, but I had witnessed things that had helped prepare me, although I had not credited them at first.  Fortunately, not long after that improbable afternoon, I had the opportunity to establish myself once again at Baker Street and the glue pot had come back with me.
“Please,” Holmes said, with an open gesture of his hand towards the refreshments at Mr Corvus’ side.
Fortunately, I knew what an oleander was.  More botanical study was necessary because I did not know the names of more than half the plants in the gardens.
Sherlock looked up.  “It comes in flashes, your insight.  Like an eye that is recovering from an injury that swelled it shut.”  He frowned.  “Your protective spells are mainly unconscious.  You don’t know how you’ve done them and you don’t know how to undo them.  Even I haven’t seen past most of them.”
“I haven’t found anything yet.  It would appear that he knew by the time he drew up his will, however, and that is why there are the clauses about a child or a ward,” Sherlock said.
DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country, and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was—but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me—upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain—upon the bleak walls—upon the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few rank sedges—and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees—with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter lapse into every-day life—the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.
I seized his arm, no drop to waste.  His blood was warmer this time and it tasted…of course, it tasted, like roses.  In the sun.
feel it means?” he replied, his thumbs stroking the inside of my wrist, seemingly absentmindedly, as he continued to peer at the two circlets.
“Time is particularly flexible up here,” he said.  “You’ll see.”  He turned back towards the crowd.  “Shall we deliver our branches?”
“You are most welcome Chief Detective Inspector Lestrade,” Mycroft replied.  His glance lingered on Greg’s face, then swept to Molly.  “And a peignoir for you, my dear, something elegant for the boudoir.”
“Shall we lay our cards on the table and see if we can each see what the other has described?” he asked.
“John,” he said before pivoting on the balustrade and striding away along it to the side of the house.
On the ground, her son clung to his companion, or sibling, his head on their shoulder.  And then, he looked up.  The elderly woman was standing on top, one hand on the little boy’s shoulder.
“…Right.  I just…I need a moment to figure out what I’m going to do,” the shadow of Sherlock said on the screen.
The lights were bright, the centrifuge whirred on its own.  The desk chairs were gone, the lab table had been tidied.  I shoved up my sleeves.  The tiny scab at my cubital fossa was reassuring.  The centrifuge clicked off, its hum ticking to a stop.  I inhaled, checked the supply cupboard.  My view of the shelves of shining glass was unobstructed.  I blew out the breath I had been holding and returned to the library at a more moderate pace.
I looked down at Sherlock.  He was very pale, the blue of the vein at his temple visible beneath his skin.
“I had Billy put it in when he fetched the hansom,” he answered, striding towards the east doors of the abbey.  “As for the contents, I had him assemble those after he sent the telegram.”
I stepped closer to the window.  The fountain in the courtyard I had visited was not so tall nor did it have statues; it had been a modest feature with a column about my height ringed with carved ivy and a gentle spout burbling at the top.  The distraction of Lestrade’s arrival had followed and although I had now seen from the roof that the Manor’s buildings enclosed several courtyards, I had forgotten to ask which one my room overlooked.  Perhaps the upwards hand-waving while we had been in the courtyard had been a general indication of a room on the upper floors.
The swan’s feathers seemed to be folding in against the wing bones.  The swan appeared broader with each passing second.  One hand grasped the top of the railing, another was splayed against the brick of the building’s wall.  A leg clothed in feathery trousers was raised, a shod foot wedged between the bottom strut of the railing and the floor of the balcony.
I inhaled suddenly and began tearing at the buttons of my shirt.  My fingers were shaking, but I succeeded in undoing them and pulled the cloth aside.
They turned onto Baker Street.  Over the road, police tape no longer blocked off part of the footpath.  John paused at the crosswalk and peered down towards the station.  “The trains’ll stop running soon.”
“Any dances free up?” he asked with that song in his voice that was infuriating and alluring at the same time.
I kept up my humming; the brambles were thick.  Otherwise, my cloth would have been in shreds after a few more steps.  Faster and faster we went, the smell of crushed berries rising from beneath our feet.
“Bring a jacket, it’s chillier than it was when we looked out earlier.  Extra blankets for the bed tonight, too, I think.”
I rested the clay pot on my knees, hands still clasped around it.  “I suppose I should have come down to the kitchen and done this there.”
I swayed as my vision cleared.  I took a deep breath, lowered my soothed hand, and stepped closer to the door.
His hand smoothed over my chest.  “Hmm.  You haven’t met them yet.”  Cool fingers stroked against my heated skin and I shivered.
I pressed hard against my coat and the silver case in my pocket dug into my flesh.  There had been times when I’d taken it out and held it, still warm from where I carried it, but I wouldn’t open it because I couldn’t bear to see how beautiful he had been in those photographs, looking this way and that, assuming poses to keep the photographer distracted while he was being interrogated, all unaware.  All that beauty, of body and mind, all gone.
Both animals came to a halt, facing one another, with half a branch apiece in their mouths.  They appeared to be at an impasse.
I locked the gate properly and I hoped no one had taken advantage of its being unlocked for nearly an hour.
I pressed my forehead against his neck, settling between his arm and his side, one leg across his thighs.  Small patches of warmth were forming on him.  I rubbed his other shoulder and arm, feeling the extra line of bone beneath his skin.
I looked up.  His dressing gown was half off; the journal still in hand.  This close I could see the pulse at his throat.
Sherlock held out his arm from beneath my cloak.  It was streaked with dried blood, but his mother rested her arm along it as though it were swathed in silver brocade.  Together, they crossed the room to Lord Holmes and me.
Untapped reserves were found.  I sat up straighter.  “No, no, I can manage.”  I scowled at the satin ribbons and considered using one of my knives on the things.
“Ah, there’s our sleek, black fellow joining the fray.  His wings are up.  Oh, someone’s given him a nip.  They’re sorry for that now.”
The passage between the two rooms was longer than I would have expected.  The streetward side was panelled in wood that matched the library shelves and the wall opposite held a narrow door which was ajar.  Through it, I glimpsed a corridor running perpendicular to the passage, between the library and the next room.  What I could see of its wall was timber and brickwork, the former forked and blackened, the latter thin and yellow.
He could leave another part uncovered, sting it only a little, drink from it when it swelled.  John might still shout, but that shouting had a different timbre and there was so much more to drink.  Perhaps John would lie quietly in his silken bonds if Sherlock made him shout like that frequently enough.
My gaze wandered to it.  The youth with the winged sandals was missing from the seascape.  His sandals, and his cap, rested on the cushion in front of the window instead.
My voice lowered to a croon as the gap widened.  When two semi-circles lay side-by-side, connected by some supple hinge, a ripple ran through the metal.
Ms Swann got up, went into the other room and came back with a large sketch book.  She handed it to Sherlock and returned to her seat.
Sherlock dropped his phone as he reached for it.  I stepped closer, holding the light steady for him.
Once arrived, Mr Braithewaite had settled Sherlock and I in his waiting room and with apologies to us, had taken only Adamantine and Corvus into his office.  Our client had grown even paler than he had been at being separated from us and Sherlock had had to assure him we would be waiting when he was finished.  As soon as the office door shut, Sherlock said he would go downstairs for a word with the hansom driver and I said I hoped Corvus would not call for him until he had returned.
In the refrigerator, I needed to nudge aside a fresh pint of milk to fit in the half gallon jug I had bought. Seeing it was stranger than seeing body parts in there.  I finished stowing the groceries, grabbed a yellow apple and sauntered into the sitting room, rubbing it against my shirt as I went.
John stopped looking through his field glasses and checked Sherlock’s expression.  “You’re not joking, are you?”
“But,” Sherlock continued, “you have not connected the last vein you’ve brought along the arm...ah.”
I stretched one hand above my head feeling for the throwing dagger I had brought along from the firing range.  It had seemed the right weight for hiding up a sleeve and I had set it beside me on the bench.
Even in my distracted state, I had snatched my medical kit from the floor and once upon the bed with him had raised each leg in turn and dabbed an antiseptic of Holmes’ own concoction on every scratch.  Oh, how close some had come to dealing him a truly uncomfortable injury.  I had bent down and pressed my lips to those, the tincture tingling on my lips, and by the time I had finished, my respiration had been too rapid to be described as sighing.  Holmes had smiled as I capped the disinfectant and set it aside, his fingers uncurling on the sun-warmed covers like blossoms.  I had kissed the juncture of each finger and when his legs had eased further apart, I had kissed there, too, the sun hot upon my back.
In the morning, I didn’t even make tea.  I grabbed the bundle from the box, perched on the top step and began peeling away layers of newspaper.  Whatever it was, it had certainly been carefully wrapped.
“Not at all.  My tastes haven’t changed much over the years,” he said and took a taste.  “Mm,” he hummed.  “I’m happy so far.”
“Hydra prefer to bite their prey here,” he said and curved his other hand around the back of my neck.  “In the right place, their long fangs will paralyse the creature they have caught, then they shake it to snap the spine.  They hunt quarry smaller than me and usually in salt water.   It was strange to find one so far upriver and on the shore.  Perhaps I took him by surprise as well.”  He rubbed over the tender skin on my flank.  “Before I lopped off the last of his heads, he took quite a chunk out of me and by extension, out of you.  You’ve healed quickly, considering.”
I clutched at the branches, shifted my weight onto the foot already wedged in the pile.  How fast could I scale it?
There were singers on the gallery now or maybe the winged creatures painted on the ceiling sang.  The voices rose, urging me on.  My footsteps hit to their beat, harder and harder, until the floor resounded like a drum.  With each stomp, our fortress walls rose higher.  They would block every attempt against us.  All of us.  And within their safety, I could tend to Sherlock.
Perched upon the top rail of the footboard of my bed was the peregrine.  She turned her head and studied me.
“So, how did you like Summer?” Mrs Hudson asked as she entered the library with a large breakfast tray.
I leaned against the side of the settee.  “When you were gone, I dreamt of searching for you at the Falls,” I said and the falling water drowned out Holmes’s playing for a moment.  “I never re-lived any of our adventures nor a single hour of the many we spent in this room.”  My arm swept about me, then dropped to my side.  My voice dropped with it.  “I had to read my stories or my notes for that.”
I didn’t know who Wiggins was.  It was very late and I was very tired, but the idea that Sherlock might slip down the stairs and into the taxi if I talked about deposits and check-out lists set me to emptying the nightstand and desk drawers.  I didn’t want to spend an extra minute in the place.
