Steve had just barely made it down the stairs before Tony was knocking at the door, and he sighed at the Omega. “I told you I’d come down and get you.”
“Uh sorry.” Tony said again, confused. “My room?”

about controlling his tiny wife. “I’ll do my best.”
“He’s way younger than you, Stevie. Even if he does fall for you, what twenty year old is ready to settle down and mate up and pop out a few kids?”
why you’re so nervous, hm? Is tonight the night your gentleman Alpha spends some time
“I’ll be honest sweetheart, I don’t actually know what’s going on.” Steve didn’t
“Nobody was fine in that place.” Bucky tightened his grip on the wheel, fangs grit tight as he tried not to growl again. It wasn’t Tony’s fault he couldn’t afford anything better than that dump and Bucky knew-- he
“I promised you something lace.” Tony smiled sheepishly, maybe a little bit shy, closing his knees so he wasn’t quite so exposed as the Alpha stared down at the brilliantly colored garter.
“Prettier than me.” Clint chuckled when Tony made a disagreeable motion. “But he's already in love with some fancy uptown Alpha so you’ll have to settle for mildly inappropriate phone banter with me. Tough luck.”
“What the hell are you doing here?” Tony’s heart was pounding, his scent
“You can wear whatever color you want at our wedding.” the Alpha repeated calmly. “But I think if you’re going to wear a traditional dress or even a bride-suit, ivory or eggshell would be softer against your skin instead of blinding white. Trust me.” he winked. “I’m an artist, I know all about these sort of things.”
“Can I ask you--” Steve scratched at his head uncertainly. “What about government programs or anything like that. There’s gotta be things set up to help Omegas in your position? I remember a time when my parents had food stamps was that-- was that not an option for you back then? Or now?”
Tony tipped his head so the Alpha could scent him and only purred louder, tapering off into a pleased hum when Steve crooned into his ear.
“Sure thing.” Tony tried to quell the rush of
“Goddamnit.” Steve dropped his head into his hands and Tony only laughed harder, eyes sparkling and little fangs glinting in the restaurant lights. “If you weren’t so pretty when you laugh, I’d feel like a real jackass right now.”
“Not at all.” Steve latched onto Tony’s neck, digging his fangs in and worrying a purple bruise onto the Omega’s porcelain skin. “I want you t’go, get good and pampered, take all damn day. Do whatever you want.”
my muse.” Steve moved, spurred into action by the overwhelming need to be with his mate, to cover Tony and keep him safe, to protect this gorgeous Omega that was meant to be his. He crawled onto the bed on all fours and coaxed Tony back up into the pillows with a low rumble, stretched out over the Omega’s body and settled just enough of his weight to make Tony whimper eagerly, just enough
for his tentative heart when Steve startled and swore getting a glimpse of the dark blue, lace edged panties Tony had worn.
“I didn’t expect you to say that either.” he whispered. “And I missed you too.”
“Christ.” Steve dropped his hands in an instant, backed up several steps and cursed under his breath. “No, Tony don’t do that. Don’t do that, this was so stupid and now you’re making fun of me. I shouldn’t have even said anything.
He paused, cocked his head as he put two and two together. “Your birthday must be at the end of the month. Tony, am I going to be here for your birthday?”

'Ah! Ah! What-? What's hap-?'
So Tony wasn't sure if Steve was being serious or if this was some kind of trick. His defenses sprang up.
Steve sat up, slowly, which made Tony snap out of his daze!
A pause.
"Shh! Aunt Nat, you're speaking badly about Daddy!"
As quick as a bolt of lighting, Natasha was back at eye-level with Steve on the floor and slammed a bone-crushing fist to his chest again!

Something in Steve caught alight at those words.
" teased Steve now, smirking devilishly which made the young mechanic blush.
“Hey, Morgan,” he began, “Why don’t you tell me some of your dad’s stories.”
Tony's eyes were red and puffy; as was his nose.
Tony stopped short, confusion evident on his face.
"A-and wher-where i-is my d-daddy?" Tony's voice had risen an octave in an attempt to speak over his sobbing wails that still threatened to break through.
This, in turn, earned an indignant squawk of protest from Tony, a little offended, a snicker from Nat, a blush from both Bruce and Steve who rubbed the backs of their necks, embarrassed, and scoff from Clint!
brave for telling me. Because even superheroes like you,” Steve tickled the little boy’s chest, making him giggle.
Something that she also grew to love about the brunette was how he treated people and the good he hoped to accomplish with Stark Industries.
"That complicates things a bit," Steve whispered, a faint smile forming. Tony shook his head, smiling as well, "Since when have we ever done things the easy way?" They both chuckled.

Natasha’s perfectly lovely mouth fell open into a surprised
“Poor Omega.” Steve rumbled into his ear and Tony hiccuped and held him tighter. “Such a sad Omega, it’s okay. It’s okay. I’ve got you. I’m not gonna let anything else happen to you alright? Not a damn thing. You and Pete are mine to hold and mine to protect and we’re gonna be alright. Everything’s alright.”
He spread his fingers over the width of Steve’s chest as the Alpha moved in over him to steal a kiss, and Steve whispered, “That’s alright baby, I love your curves, can’t wait to find out how soft you are... everywhere but right here.” he checked with Tony just briefly before closing a lube slicked hand around the Omega’s cock and stroking him from base to tip, the soft curls above Tony’s sac to the already leaking head . “Yeah sweetheart, I love you soft everywhere but right

But instead, Tony had ended up with an Alpha who’d lasted all of forty five minutes before admitting he had to Google silverware and that he hated ties and if Tony hadn’t already been halfway to smitten over Steve Roger’s good looks, he

“A pretty good portion of it.” Definitely a lie, since Tony had set his allowance amount at
The thought made Tony whine, and the Omega buried his nose into Peter’s hair and breathed in the baby scent to try and calm himself. He was over reacting, Peter just had the flu but
“Tough shit.” Steve shrugged uncaringly, and Tony nearly spit out a bite of steak laughing at the unexpected answer from the usually polite Alpha. “I’d get you something for your birthday anyway, but since I’ll be out of town for it, I’m going to get you something
There weren’t enough words for the rush of relief that left Tony weak kneed and clutching at Steve’s arms for balance, and when the Alpha kissed him again Tony kissed him right back, holding on tight and trying to convince himself that this was really

“Good for you.” Peggy tucked Peter’s blanket a little tighter around his little feet. “A nice Alpha to pay for your Uber. But how much is he paying
The Alpha blushed just a little bit, and Tony glanced around to make sure no one was looking before darting forward and bussing a quick kiss to Steve’s cheek. “Tell me more about your friends.”

, nosing through the soft hair at Tony’s ear and shivering a little when Tony automatically squeezed at his leg under the table and then linked their fingers. Omegas needed physical touch just as much as they needed emotional support and stability, and since both Clint and Tony both went days and sometimes weeks without a kind touch from anyone other than family, sneakily stolen time in the few minutes before shift end and the rest of their crappy lives intervened had to suffice.

Natasha laughed until she choked, and Steve just grumbled, “You’re both terrible people.”
“Oh my god you’re beautiful.” The Alpha wanted to taste his way down every inch of Tony’s body, count the Omega’s ribs with dotted kisses and growl into the give of Tony’s navel. He wanted to tear the leggings off and bury his face between the pillow soft thighs and

“It was really good.” The money that Steve had slipped into Tony’s jacket pocket felt heavy and
“Yes!”
Steve almost hated having to lean back long enough to get condoms and lube from his side table drawer, but he dragged himself from the way Tony was squirming and trying to rub up against his palm long enough to shuck his own pants and open the brand new bottle of lube meant specially to cater to an Omega’s needs--

“You want me?” Steve gripped at the plush curve of Tony’s ass, spread the cheeks far so he could see the shadow of Tony’s hole beneath the champagne colored lace. “Want me right here? Want me to use my tongue and get you wet before I stuff you full?”
. “Steve-- Alpha-- Bite me.”
He blew out a breath, the exhaustion of the day’s shift rapidly catching up. “He put as much into the ‘job’ section of the profile as would fit but I’ve still got questions. I guess now he is a full time artist, so the money from playing ball and the military must be good.”
“Mr. Carbonell.” The Alpha suddenly couldn’t breathe, his chest tightening and throat closing up as he held out his hand to the most stunning Omega he’d ever seen in his life. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

Tony clapped his hand over his mouth so he wouldn’t laugh.
“Not a deal breaker.” Bucky was quick to assure him. “Not in the least. Give us a dollar figure and we’ll make it happen. In fact, Tasha keeps a place mid town for when she’s not out data collecting, so once you decide you trust us or once we’ve got some permanence t’this whole thing, you can live there and then you don’t gotta pay rent and keep your allowance for anything in the future.”
The Alpha reached for Tony’s cock where it lay hard at his stomach, bobbing with each body racking stroke, but the Omega knocked his hand away and did it himself, open mouth panting and swearing under his breath and jerking his cock in time to each snap forward of Steve’s powerful frame. Steve couldn’t decide if he wanted to watch Tony touch himself or if he wanted to be staring at Tony’s face as the Omega’s eyes rolled back and a gorgeous flush washed up his chest and into his neck, highlighting at his cheeks and making the Alpha half feral with the need to bite and
“Steve I’m-- I’m crazy about you too.”

With the Command ringing in his ears and buzzing like needles under the skin at the nape of his neck, Tony scrambled around the apartment gathering up enough things for a few nights away for he and Peter.

“You don’t ever sit on it though, right?” Tony picked up the dropped pillow and hugged it to his chest. “There’s not so much as a butt dent in this thing. Is it brand new?”
“Sleeping like a paint covered angel.” Tony smiled, the tips of his little fangs peeking out from beneath pink lips. “He’ll need a hell of a bath tomorrow.”
“Ohhh you better do what he says, mate.” Natasha’s voice came tinny over the speaker on Bucky’s phone where it sat on the side table. “When Steve starts hurricane cleaning, he’s always half a Swiffer mop away from
“Can I touch you right here?” Steve eased Tony back into the pillows with kiss after languid, passionate kiss, tugging experimentally at the rhinestone straps before pushing the other one all the way off and covering the exposed skin with his mouth, tonguing over the dip of Tony’s collarbone and digging his teeth in to the meat of Tony’s shoulder hard enough to make the brunette

The Omega stood up on his toes for a real kiss, and Steve groaned softly when their lips met again and again, the delicate points of Tony’s fangs teasing at his tongue. “I’m so glad you’re here, sweetheart. I’m so glad you decided to stay.”
The first box was full of but tops, comfortable t shirts in saturated jewel tones and a few pastels that would look gorgeous against Tony’s dark hair and eyes, long sleeves in various weights that would be perfect for the still cool nights and heavier ones for the change of seasons to autumn. There were button ups in slim fit cuts, lace at the collars and delicate, Omega-styled details that spoke of designer quality and boutique prices, and cashmere sweaters with low vee necks or wide collars to show off Tony’s throat.
***********
The Alpha put his phone down in time to see Peter tearing down the hallway headed for him, bare feet pounding down the hardwood floor, Bug held tight in one hand as the toddler made a beeline for the big bed and threw himself just as high as he could to reach Steve.
“Please.” Steve looked a little faint. “Yes.”
“Huh.” Tony pointed at an apartment option and Steve bookmarked it. “Well, I  knew when I saw her this last time that I could trust her with Peter. Bucky too, but Nat first.”
“I feel like I never had trouble with that, but hey maybe Pete just adores me endlessly.” Clint winked, and was far too gratified when both Alphas visibly straightened and preened under the attention. “You going over for the Christmas decorating party? Tony said something about a twelve foot tree and Steve sent out an SOS about a wreath or a garland or something?”
about it, but you’ll have to ‘allowance’ me enough money to make up for any doubles or whatever I give up to be with you. Tony had it worked out where Steve was giving him exactly enough for rent and I’ll need something similar. Like you said, I can’t give a damn about courting when I’m trying to survive day to day so if that’s a deal breaker…”
In a part of town far from Brooklyn Heights, Tony’s phone beeped with a message request and the Omega looked over at the measly three dollars, over at where Peter slept innocent and unawares, then down at the picture of the Alpha with sunshine blond hair and

“Mr. Rogers, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood--” Tony started singing,  laughing when Steve spluttered in shock. “A beautiful day for a

“Yep.”

Steve would insist on feeding Tony with his hands, soothing the underlying worry that his Omega wasn’t eating enough, quieting the rumble of mine in his chest with Tony’s weight on his lap and scent in his nose.

“Then what are you talking about?” Steve sighed at the painting one last time, then took it off the easel and tossed it into the trash pile with the others.

though.”
The baby was out cold, mouth open and drooling, clutching tight at Steve’s shirt with one hand and every other limb limp in slumber and Tony let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding when he found them messy, but safe and apparently happy to nap together, the sight doing something swoopy to his stomach and heart as he watched them sleep.
“I mean, he probably did.” Clint peeked around the corner. “My voice tends to carry. The whole diner knows you’ve turned into a Frosty Frieda since moving in with your sugar daddy and trust me, the whole diner disapproves.”
“He’s got it bad for this Omega.” Bucky fit his big hand comfortably at the curve of Tasha’s hip. “I’m sorta worried about him. Steve’s never so much as been in love and now he’s all crazy over this twenty something kid that he’s

“You need some extra cash?” Clint asked, and Tony countered, “You need every dollar just like I need every dollar, Clint.”
“Next time you should just drown me.” Tony was halfway to asleep after an absolutely mind-bending orgasm, and the words came out mumbled. “I know you’re worried about choking me, but next time just jam that thing down my throat and unload. I can take it and even if I can’t, dying by way of Patriotic Trouser Snake Firehose would be a hell of a way to go. Hoorah and Semper Fi and all that.”

Tony and Steve were snuggled up together, cozily, on their own love seat. It seemed that one of them could not spend five minutes separated from the other, before sticking themselves back to each other's side!
Steve guffawed right from his chest. Oh, that was
He burst through the doors, not two minutes later, with a stretcher and medical team.
“Natasha…” he breathed out, defeated.
Looking up to Steve's loving gaze, Tony felt the warm glow blossom in his heart. It made his breath stutter.
The energy was palpable to any passer-by.
"Sorry Steve!" someone called from above them.
He nearly entered the kitchen, but was stopped by a frantic Tony perched on top of the island.
Steve stood hunched over a little, clutching at his sides, looking like a scared golden retriever with wide baby-blue eyes!
I am so sorry I'm late, Tony, you know I'd never do that on purpose, right? I love you too much, baby doll.
Final chapter will contain smut with feelings! 😂
Steve heard it.
She smiled sympathetically.
Steve pulled his baby back slightly, until he could look into his eyes again.
Hearing his name screeched from the kitchen, Steve bolted from the couch to find the source of the sound.

rumbled through the crowd of racers. Tony blushed beside his sister. Steve shot him a wink, making him go a deeper shade of scarlett. Natasha was still smiling, and nodding to herself as if she saw something in Steve that no one else could. She finally held out her hand.
"I'm your everything," Steve murmured, nuzzling Tony's nose. He grinned dopily at his genius like the lovesick idiot that he was and kissed him long and lovingly.
When they parted, it left Tony moaning and panting. Steve laughed breathlessly, "Hold on now, we don't want my mom hearing anything further."
It all happened in slow motion.
“Ta-da!” he exclaimed excitedly.
"We still have so many things to say to each other," he sobbed, his voice thick with the wails yet to break through his throat. Tony mustered a small smile. A million blades stabbed and tore at his flesh as he lifted his arm to cradle Steve's hand that held his face.
Tony swatted Steve’s chest irritably.
he thought,
"Ste-eve... d-do you r-real-really l-love m-me?" Tony choked out and a few tears ran down his face.
He shot a glare in Steve’s direction.
They both shuffled swiftly back out and closed the door, so Nat could get Tony settled. She was the only alpha he trusted, and was fully capable enough to take care of him.
He gave the brunette's hand a reassuring squeeze before climbing into his Merc.

He was totally in bliss as Steve's voice surrounded him as well: soft-
loves you!" Bucky pressed, leaning closer, "I know it's your decision, but it's been months Tony. If you're ready for closure, then maybe you need to take the first step to talk to him. He's still hurting pretty bad."
The tension thickened in the room; wound up tight as a coil.
Tony could only clutch at Steve's back, at his shoulders and he wrapped his legs securely around Steve's waist as his lover rocked his hips against Tony's aching erection slid in and out of Tony's entrance!
Her hand stroked his tummy rhythmically, applying gentle pressure to relieve the knots. Accompanied by Nat’s gentle massage weaving through his curls, her alpha scent relieved the burning under Tony’s skin.
Blowing out a deep breath, Steve threw caution into the wind. He stared into those chocolate-brown orbs he loved so much. Deep pools of fiery emotion that made Tony who he was.
Steve chuckled, his posture relaxing a little.
He'd fight against the cosmos if he had to, to change the course of his future so that no version of himself would ever hurt this beautiful man before him! And to
He tried to snuff his whimpering, but Nat could see he couldn’t wait much longer.
Every time.
Tony heard it.
"Of course, Captain," the AI replied, with a hint of laughter in his voice.
He was too beautiful a human for this world.
"After all,"  Tony spoke again, "it's us- we'll work it out. We always do, because… because I love you."
Having your alpha partner knot you, meant that you both fully trusted each other and your partner was willing to help you through your heat. It meant that you both were ready to bond and start a family.

"You know, you should actually be
"You're my only hope, Tony, to not give up. If you go… then I'm done. I'll put the shield aside for good. And I can respect that - I can respect you going… but… if- if there's a chance you'd say yes to… to stay?"
“Ss- Ste-eve? S-Steve is- is…? Are- are you--?” Tony’s voice was but a mere meek whisper as he witnessed his mate make love to another omega not even 7 feet away from him!
In order for a female’s body to change, a signal is sent to her brain, and the brain activates extra cells to form and change to a male’s cock.

that mice mate and multiply by the dozen? Do you realise what that can mean for the compound? For the electricity and wiring and for the health and sanitation of this place?”
He smiled brightly at the love of his life.
He still caught Clint’s remark before the doors closed though: “I’m not the only one who thought that was weird, right? Is Steve sick?”
, Mr Rogers,
The genius always grumbled about Steve's teasing often, but he knew that pouting wouldn't help his case, because Steve would then just say it made him look even
“Rough day today?” he murmured softly. He felt Tony nod.
Both their hearts were frantic. They were inches apart from each other's faces.
Dr Strange's hands were flying in the air and his eyes looked like they were ready to burst from their sockets. Natasha would have laughed if she wasn't so absorbed.
“Steve!”
He chuckled fondly in amusement.
Blue sapphires bore into Tony's soul as he saw
This just made Natasha's job after the movie all the more serious.
Tony's head was turned away, eyes glistening and Steve understood; his own eyes softened.
curiosity.
Locking his eyes on the road, Steve felt the engine rumble beneath him. He felt the energy of the crowd, of their eyes all around him. The world held its breath and then the racer yelled that one word:
The soldier was indeed acting strange...
His voice turned to a whisper, turning away in shame.
“Frolic?” Steve giggled, “I think mice scurry, Love.”
"Come in," he called.
Next up is the letter "L".
The captain looked up tentatively. He met Tony’s gaze. And Steve saw how sunken in his eyes were, the bags underneath a bruised purple. He looked terrible.
It was fifteen minutes to Steve's house. For obvious reasons, he couldn't tell his father that he and Steve had been dating for far longer than what Howard had heard.
“Oh, would you just quit your ‘mother-henning’ Rogers!” Tony bit out through the pain. A huge burn covered his left forearm, his skin all shades of red and pink.
“We’ll figure something out Hon, don’t worry about it. Thankfully it just looks like it’s just these little guys in the area.”
Steve would give Tony his present later.
He kissed the genius again.
He pretended to ignore Nat's smug smile on his way to Tony's room.
Heat and lust consumed them as their bodies connected skin to skin!
She even shuddered at the thought of it.
That made her heart collapse for a split second. They only knew so few people they could trust to help them. So if Bruce was uncertain, their options just became thinner.
Today, however, the doctor was on point, because his robots caused twice the amount of destruction and casualties and the team left the fight with their vitals relatively low. It
It was then that their bond was formed.

Bolting up, Steve wasn't surprised to see Doctor Strange in Tony's ward…
on your ex-love, while simultaneously enjoying ill beatings!"
Steve heard the uncertainty. He heard Tony's fear. The hesitant undertone as his voice wavered and grew softer as he asked the question.
,' he thought.
my best moment, Honey, but you get my point anyway.
They became darker and glossier with unshed tears:
The bedsheets were thrown askew.
The brunette squeaked adorably, before he melted into Steve and he let his mouth be guided in a perfect dance. The blonde's lips against his were supple and smooth, enlisting breathless moans from the mechanic.
“Well, you wouldn’t be the first one to walk away then either!”
"My beautiful Judy Hopps!" Tony laughed, his eyes glittering.
He laughed, but it sounded empty, echoing in the room. The tears fell on the cloth of the blankets, silently dripping from ice blue eyes.
“I know you all are superheroes and you make it your life’s work to protect the city and more, but I will not have you making a scene and disturbing the patients and staff!” she hissed.
“Hey, has Tony come up here?”
"Would that ulterior motive be the fact that leaning over the engine would've given me a perfect angle to gaze at your beautiful body?" Steve stepped closer to the brunette. Tony took a further step forward, a little bashfulness creeping over his facade.
Clint caught her glaring at the screen.
Steve's touch was something else... It was something that Tony wanted to experience every
he heard himself think.
“Clint, I need you to get Bruce to take Thor outside while I get Tony upstairs to my room. You know where the tablets are, so I need to bring those too, but move quickly!”
“Yeah, I, uh… I just went to the garden to sketch for a little while.”

Usually, he would blame it on just too many cheeseburgers and beer, but he'd only had two burgers so far and his alcohol tolerance was the best in New York!
is what Nat was built for. She was an alpha. She was the
” He kissed Tony sweetly, revelling in the feel of his lips against Steve’s own. The sweet taste of coffee flowing through his mouth.
‘He looks tired,’ thought Tony sympathetically, surprising himself that he was so quick to care. Though, it had been a couple months already, but…
The Avenger whined pitifully, letting the tears fall and the sobs wreck his being.
“Never a trouble for you, Babydoll.”
“Steve”
“I love you too- you’re the love of my life…”
"Oh, nothing much, my Antoshka."
You don't have to worry about anything. You don't have to be scared of judgement. Because
" His father's footsteps grew louder as he climbed the stairs.
But Tony still remained skeptical.
"She didn't threaten to cut off my balls," he said, exasperated. Steve rolled his eyes, knowing this wouldn't go away anytime soon.
The brunette must have surmised Steve's anxiety in the blonde's pale face, however. A calm wave of pheromones brushed around Steve. Inhaling the scent, his shoulders immediately relaxed and he exhaled deeply.
.. I guess you're not
Tony smirked, “I think I know where this is going Aunty Nat.”
"Wrong moment for sarcasm, Rogers... But
And then there was nothing.
, he consoled himself.
With as much sensitivity as an AI could possibly muster, Jarvis continued to console Tony as best he could, in his current Little Headspace, after calculating that a nightmare such as that, would indeed trigger him into such a state.
Whenever I make my fics post-Endgame and have Natasha live, it's based off of this fic called, I'll Carry Your World - it's a Steve/Tony ship fic where they go to Vormir instead of Clint and Nat, but they survive.
"Hi, I'm Tony," he said cheerfully, wiping his hands over his jeans, "I'd, uh, love to shake your hand, but I doubt grease would be a good look on you."
Who had to return to heaven way too soon
He was shaken out of it by Natasha literally holding his arms to his sides and rattling him out of his panic.
Over the course of the next few days, as soon as the statement was made to the press and media, James Rhodes and Pepper took shifts guarding Tony's hospital room and making sure he was as comfortable as possible, away from the constant prying eyes of the paparazzi.
sorry! I didn’t see you, I’m so clumsy- I- I should’ve watched where I was walking, but I-“
Tony grinned, "Peter actually made me watch a Disney movie, Zootopia? And... every moment, I just couldn't help but see you instead...in place of the main character, Judy Hopps! She's the, uh... the first ever bunny to become a cop and who wants to fight for justice and is just so completely giddy and optimistic and idealistic- you name it! But, she's also incredibly sweet and positive too. She's resourceful and just as much a conniving sarcastic!"
"Those words carry a lot of weight," she mused, flicking up an eyebrow, "Hopefully your actions behind them carry the same amount."
"Point is, Steve: it doesn't hurt me anymore as much as it did before, because... when I heard those words come out of your mouth... When I heard you say that
“You don’t need to, Capsicle. I was just processing. I believe you. But you just have to realize that I’m going to disappoint you as a friend, or other.”
He flipped an eyebrow, "When were you planning on telling him you lifted your foot off the throttle at the last minute to give him the benefit of the doubt?"
"We can't be in control over our instincts all the time, Steve," Tony replied calmly.
“Shh, shh… there we go now… shh… aw, such a good omega- yes! So sweet and brave and so smart!” she crooned, nuzzling his nose fondly. Tony blushed a dusty pink, but he purred happily and burrowed as close as he could to absorb her warm summer-scent. Elation washed over Nat as Tony’s breathing evened out and his calmed scent resonated around her.
Tony was smiling.
The part where... where he'd have to let Steve go again... and let his heart become a hard shell of what it was before...
he thought to himself. The captain brushed away the thought, but it became increasingly a little more difficult with the quiet moans Tony let slip through his lips. Steve was careful when massaging in the ointment, but he never thought it would have
Steve couldn't help it- he was so damn
With one last knowing glare thrown at Steve by Nat, the elevator doors slid shut and a certain genius and supersoldier enjoyed each other's company, as they rode up to their floor.
Suddenly, he heard the sound of footsteps coming towards the communal living room. Smiling, the captain pressed a button on a remote to play some smooth jazz music.
Steve loved Tony--that was true.
my sweet baby,
But the nightmare then came forward once again, and Tony couldn't stop himself from letting out a pained whimper.
Steve cleared his throat.
They could already hear Clint's bickering as they turned the corner, and soon saw Bruce already shaking his head in defeat while the archer attempted to correct Thor on his mixed-up pop-culture terms.
"Beautiful," he murmured dreamily, causing a dusty, red-rose blush to appear on Tony's face.
And, even though his head was in his hands, everyone could see Clint's shoulders shake as he ultimately gave in and laughed with the others.
And legs tangled together in a web!
His heart leaped into his chest as his whole body lit up with sparks.
"Well, I don't want any of that," he answered, drawing Tony closer, rubbing his back slowly, "I just want Tony. I just want stubborn, fearless, intelligent Tony. I wanna tell him how much meaning he gives me. With his ideas on fighting techniques, his ideas on clean energy and even the arguments that we have. He makes my life interesting. He makes me wanna get up in the morning. And I like that… I guess… I guess I was just too afraid to admit it. To him or to myself."
Steve felt Happy’s gaze on him.
The captain opened his eyes and saw the far-away look in Tony's. The genius bit his lip subconsciously and seemed to forget his surroundings.
But Steve was worried, "Tony, we gotta take you to my mom- you're even bleeding!"
Losing to a machine- who would've guessed the irony for a man out of time?" Steve sardonically snapped to himself. He knocked his forehead against the glass, letting his breath fog it up absent-mindedly.
“I have to go. Here,” he handed Steve the money and made a beeline for the checkout.
For one thing, this was still
She stood by her team, mindlessly chatting. Seeing her brother, she gave Tony a hug.
He trudged back to the facility, alone with his thoughts.
"Shut up," Steve grumbled to her.

” Steve chased after the brunette but Tony had already locked himself in the bathroom. He’d enabled the alpha reinforced door layer too.
Nat sighed in relief. She collapsed into a chair, rubbing her face tiredly. Wanda sat down next to her and cradled Natasha's hands in hers, bringing them up for a gentle kiss.
“Lord of the Rings.”
'My daddy!... My daddy isn't okay! Where
"Well, I- thank you, Steve. For all the help, I really appreciate it."
His wounds would heal, internally and externally, as long as Steve was by his side.
he'd rather not linger on.
sorry, Tony, I- I have no idea what came over me, but it- it wasn’t what you think. I had protection and Bucky is on the pill. We didn’t go further into that bond. I didn't, I
Groaning, Tony lifted the smelter from the floor and started again on the mechanism.
Tony settled against her snugly like a pup, murmuring sleepily, “I love you, Nat.”
Steve jumped may fifty feet into the air!
"Don't take it personally, Miss Potts," Clint apologized, "He's just-"
Tony suddenly felt very nervous.
Then, Steve's focus centered on Tony again.
"He found out about me tutoring you and also got angry at my report results," Tony continued, "The usual happened then. He called me a fag and threw me. He-"
He looked into Tony's face.
Tony breathed in a deep gulp of air and instinctively clutched at his stomach. But Bruce didn't seem to notice- he was simultaneously trying to talk to Tony
Natasha basically slapped Clint upside the head about five times trying to convince him that it
“Tony, wait! Wait,
But then he took one look at Tony's tear-stained face and his protective instincts kicked in.
He gave a cheeky grin.
Tony was a warm, solid bundle in his arms, fit perfectly against his chest. Like two puzzle pieces finally connecting. It felt so good to feel that. The mechanic's arms clutched fistfuls of Steve's shirt as if he was afraid the blonde might disappear too quickly.
She sat him safely on the couch and went to check on the coffee in the kitchen. Thankfully, since F.R.I.D.A.Y alerted her ten minutes before the time that Tony would be coming by, his coffee was basically finished brewing.
Tony's eyes beamed and his smile shone as bright as the Milky Way Galaxy.
His heart flipped somersaults into his throat. His body flushed and goosebumps dotted onto his skin!
“Tony?” she spoke again, softly.
And with that, he forcefully grabbed Bucky by the collar of his uniform and yanked him down the corridor to the helicarrier outside!
Tony and Steve hadn’t even shared that experience yet.
"You'll never leave mine either," wailed the captain, choking back his thick breaths and trying to remain strong.
Tony’s heaving cries were like a repeated blow to Steve’s body. It pounded against his stomach; knocking out his every breath.
That smile that would be the death of Steve touched Tony's lips again.
," he shot at Steve, dryly.
"I love it!" Steve whispered softly.
Before Tony could respond, his dad socked him right in the face, sending him flying against the wall!
Tony turned with his soft brown eyes gazing vulnerably back at Steve. He had a small, hopeful smile donning his face.
changed then.
"The main thing to Nick was- was the fact that Judy actually
“W-were y-you – you a-and – and h-him-?” his voice came out tight, and quavering as he looked between Steve and Barnes “Your… you’re kn-knot- I can… I can sm-smell the—the scent, but – you-? You gave him… your kn-knot?”
"Hmnf! Hnn... Huh? What? What happened? Where-?"
Tony was sure of that fact.
Steve tossed the bouquet onto the side cabinet, letting his hands wave into a frenzy. "Still doesn't give me any excuse for my actions," he pressed.
Another sigh left Bucky's chest. Shaking his head, he decided to push it aside while he visited Tony.
Tony bolted right up in bed, screaming!
The pheromones swirled around the room and he couldn’t escape the smell in any way.
his Alpha!
“Well, is it working?” Steve smiled right back.
to- to use the- the studio," Steve replied, rubbing the back of his neck, shyly.
“When I grow older/ I will be there by your side to remind you / How I still love you… How I still love you.”
A thought then hit him.
Tony took a deep breath in.
thing and then I’m out of your life forever!”
"Quite poetic isn't it? Instincts brought us together and... instincts were our downfall," he turned to the alpha, shrugging off-handedly. There was silence for a good twenty seconds.
“T-Tony, I – you’re- I, uh-“ Steve stuttered helplessly. His whole body flushed with cold embarrassment. His heartbeat picked up erratically.
“You’re amazing Steven Grant Rogers.”
"Kotynok?" she mumbled sleepily, "What's wrong
"Yeah?" he replied gently, "So, uh... what--what happens between these two characters?"
“Uh Steve?”
Tony’s wide eyes met Bucky’s shocked expression. He froze beneath Steve. A millisecond passed in which a kaleidoscope of emotions passed between both of them.
Just then, Tony's stomach gurgle noisily in the room. Clapping a hand to his tummy, Tony made a face, "I feel kinda hungry."
Silence overcame the house.
"I lost the kid," Tony breathed, shame washing over him.
When he came back down to the communal area, everything was spotless and his husband stood proudly in the living room with a tray of cakes in his hands. Tony smiled. All the love he felt for the man bubbled up sweetly in his chest.
A strong sense of ease and warmth still flooded over him, though.
The blonde gulped, hoping he looked and smelled alright. The mechanic made his way over, smirking flirtatiously.
"Seeing as how he came into the hospital, I suggest the space that you give him last a little longer, wouldn't you agree?"
Steve drew in a breath and looked to the genius. Tony was still and expressionless. He was waiting for Steve to make the first move.
"If you said they had stardust DNA, then aren't the chances quite slim that Tony would be truly as happy deep down with another, than what he was with Steve?" Natasha murmured softly, trying to keep her voice comforting.
He gave the bathroom door one last pained look before heading downstairs in defeat.
The timetable on when I will post will vary, but they will come, so keep an eye out.
"You're closer to Stark than I ever could be, Nat, and to paraphrase your words,
A beat passed, the two of them simply looking into each other’s eyes. They tried their best to hear and say each of their thoughts through the best way possible- eyes never held away the truth.
The genius sounded on the brink of tears as well.
The brunette saw
"Hello Doctor," she smiled.
Tony had it all planned out and even managed to talk Fury into letting them take the trip.
"Really?"
"I, uh... I have something I gotta give to you too, actually. Uhm, c-can we just make a stop by my rooms first?"
Tony groaned and panted and it lit up the fire in Steve's core to hear those noises coming out of His Love. To know that he was responsible for causing those noises of bliss!
*                      *                      *
It only made Tony chuckle.
around her waist to reach the door!
"Then I won't take that privilege away," Tony murmured, his tone serious; his eyes deep and sincere. Steve's heart leapt.
Tony was now stroking the hood of the car preciously like a prized golden statue. Steve found himself smiling even wider.
Steve’s heart flipped. “
believe the surprise I have planned for us! I totally have F.R.I.D.A.Y on record to capture your face when-“
to keep this relationship going. A whole month of that kind of behavior on this new bond Stephen theorizes that we have-"
Steve pouted, pecking Tony’s lips, “But it will be so
But they didn't let go for five seconds.
A steel rod pierced mercilessly through Steve's heart. He felt his body grow weightless; numb - breathless and boneless as his legs gave out and he crashed to the ground in front of his teammate, in front of the one he never stopped loving. Pepper and Rhodey stood to the side, consoling Peter. The kid was already too young to lose so many people in his life.
But first: Tony
She held her palms up as a sign of peace, her gaze truly sincere.
But Steve's gaze never wavered from Tony's eyes.
A few tears cascaded down his face and he sniffled, the tip of his nose already cherry-red.
! It made his breath hitch, but he never broke his gaze with those dazzling, ocean-blue eyes...
A whole month of this behavior went by.
“Hon- Honey, please!
Shucking off his coat and tie and flipping off his shoes by the hanger, he walked into the kitchen to find his husband all dressed up in an apron and chef’s hat bustling about the room.
But Steve leaned down to kiss him sweet and slow, cuddling his small genius close, so that they were nothing but an entanglement of limbs binding together. Tony lost himself in the kiss. Sweet, slow and romantic. Not building towards anything; just a small reminder of endearment- of love.
Steve chuckled at Tony's expression and cradled the back of Tony's head with his other hand; one still placed over the genius' heart.
“My kotynok! I’m so glad you’ve put an end to Steve’s nervousness,” Natasha threw a wink at Steve’s deadpan look.
Tony laughed at his husband’s enthusiasm. He’d deny the squeal though, that came from his throat when Steve swatted him teasingly with the towel.
He gripped his shades tightly in his hand. He didn't call the armor.
Tony's sniffles grew softer, but he didn't separate himself from Steve's chest any sooner. He needed to feel Steve's skin under him. Feel his uniform. Feel his
But he then looked down, frowning.
Tony's stomach flipped with butterflies
Natasha sighed in relief. She then made quick work to undress him of his soiled clothes. Tony would never stop hating himself for this. The two of them were close, but it had never occurred that Natasha would see Tony in his most vulnerable form. He’d never let it go that his biology had gotten the better of him and that Nat had to do this.
"You may think of yourself as a mess, but you're my mess now, and I'm nothing if not an organised person."
He popped a cake into Tony’s mouth. And the man groaned with pleasure.
Tony didn’t think twice about yanking his husband flush against his chest and enveloping him in a hug! Breathing in his scent of sawdust and marshmallows, Tony felt home.
Natasha opened her arms, gesturing to the crowd of cars and people around them.
It was then all black and then blurry for all about twenty seconds. All Tony felt was the dull ache in his lower back and head. His whole face scrunched up, trying to force the pain down. He stayed down on his butt for a few more seconds, moaning softly. Then, slowly, Tony got up on his knees. Massaging his temples, he gradually opened his eyes to his surroundings.
They were all still relaxing in Natasha's living room. Eating snacks and enjoying each other's presence.
Tony nodded, dumbstruck.
*               *                *
Tony’s face was still in disbelief, his one eyebrow quirked up in question. Steve gave another sigh.
Steve sighed.
"Alright, alright. But I don't know what good it'll do."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well," he sighed, trying to make his voice light and humorous, "I'm the best you've got, Stark. So, let me channel my inner Sarah Rogers and help you out!"
Sighing, she ran a tired hand through her hair absently, contemplating the next step forward.
Tony scoffed, but Steve merely quirked an eyebrow, daring Tony.
Once he heard Steve's name and remembered the vivid details of his nightmare, Tony bolted out of his bed, shivering fervently, and called out to Jarvis, "Yes, Jarvis,
Tony placed a quick peck on her cheek, "Love you too, Sis. Thanks."
He couldn't think, he couldn't stand up- he just wanted- he
The scientist shook his head despondently, “What’s he been like, though? Since he came to stay here with you?”
The touch was firm. It was steady. He was surrounded by Steve!
Sufficed to say, Steve fell asleep with the biggest smile on his face!
More slick drippled from his hole and he curled in tighter on himself.
Nat was also getting worried, she was hesitant to admit.
The blonde drew in a breath and sighed, helplessly, "Tony, I don't know..."
Steve's head shot up quicker than the speed of light!
They listened for any movement.
of the door swinging back on its hinges against the wall.
Tony chuckled, leaning back a bit.
“Oh no, of course not, my baby doll,” Steve rubbed Tony’s arms up and down reassuringly, “Howard may have done those things, but I’ll never be mad at you just wanting your Daddy when you’re scared. ‘Cause you’re always so brave. My brave, beautiful boy.”
trust Steve not to pull anything, but Tony still couldn't quite as easily shake that hesitant (panick-y) edge off.
"Yes," he whispered back.
"And then?" Steve whispered thickly, afraid to go any louder to break the energy around them.
Sweet,
The next few minutes were filled with Steve tenderly applying disinfectant and bandages to Tony's cuts. He then applied some cream over the visible bruises on Tony's body; tomorrow, he'd do the rest after breakfast.
(See the end of the chapter for
The pair looked up to see Clint hanging halfway out of the vent shaft, waving apologetically. Though they all knew that he secretly found this to be
beloved in one piece as well.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, squeezing his ass.
Arms that surrounded him.
The former red-head assassin looked forlornly at the ground. She always hated this part of the mission.
"Your doctors are nothing compared to those of Asgard!" he yelled tearfully, storming out of the room.
Steve got the oxygen knocked out of him at a second kick to the groin!
Tony hummed contemptly as his Daddy then brought his hand up to kiss each of his knuckles softly.
, was that necessary?"
The red-head rolled her eyes and giggled at the small genius.
My smile is pained in fondness
Nat smiled as she marveled at the way Stephen's eyes shone just like Tony's whenever he'd go on about a new invention or a scientific development he'd been researching.
“Look Steven, I’m going give it to you straight.”
for the former playboy's head and heart to change, but seeing the good come from it and seeing Tony change into the person he was today was something really wonderful!
The young racer was abruptly struck out of reverie and was met with a smug-faced Tony gazing at him with glittering amusement in those brown, doe eyes. Steve blushed, flustering over his words, "Oh, I'm - I'm sorry - I don't even know why I actually did that- I don't even morally condone it, so I - I'm sorry, I've completely messed this up-"
"Do you mean that?" he asked.
Stephen caught it, and he blushed slightly, "Well, I mean, what's not to like about Tony? And I know you love him and want to protect him, so please know that I respect that. I wouldn't do anything to harm him."
observation skills, I'd like to compliment yours… What gave it away first that I'm a first-time racer?"
"Well, yeah," he replied, "Sure, you make me so angry, I might as well blast you just to shut you up-"
"Hi," he settled on, smiling sheepishly as he looked up at Tony.
“I… I’m scared,” Tony whispered, giving a watery smile.
In the corridor outside Tony's room, Steve backtracked his steps, profusely refusing to go inside.
“I-“ he, began softly, but choked up.
Switching on the light, he zeroed in on the towel cabinet.
His tearful cries overtook his breathless voice after stumbling out all of his fears. Steve’s heart shattered.
Something pierced her heart. A tear fell down her cheek.
He thread his fingers through the blonde's locks of hair, causing Steve to moan soflty. It was such a beautiful sound! He carded Steve's scalp gently with a mechanic's hands and massaged every inch. The blonde moaned again at Tony's hands.
It was perfect.
"What? What are you going on about now?" Steve chuckled and couldn't help but smile fondly at the genius.
It was at his touch.
Clint and Bruce hauled ass upstairs while Nat trailed after slowly, carrying Tony bridal-style and clutching him protectively to her chest. She continued whispering soft, sweet nothings.
Steve's head turned up into her steely gaze, his eyes still wide with fear and disbelief at Tony's abusive past, but he never broke eye-contact.
Natasha came into the compound living room and found Steve sitting by the window, rocking Morgan slowly in the chair.
Steve died because he didn't do enough. He was a disappointment to the Captain.
A dusty pink blush flowered on Tony’s face.
The door opened hesitantly. Tony's curiosity had him strain his neck to see who it was.
The hope that filled Bucky's eyes shone brighter than the fluorescents in the room.
It warmed her heart and she found herself smiling fondly at the brunette.
"Come, sit," he gestured happily to the chair next to his bed.
Steve brushed away the stray hairs from Tony’s forehead and peppered kisses all over his face and nose until his giggles filled the room.
His baby boy had had a nightmare and came to confide in his Daddy Steve right now.
But it felt
"Him and Sam? You don't have a problem with that?"
“But what about the mice?” he laughed.
So this is the last letter that I received and wrote for: the letter "Q". I knew I wanted one of my letters to be a poem. I'd always wanted to write one for Steve&Tony. I do hope you enjoy reading it!
"Aunty Nat's right, Sweetheart."
Tony was curled up in the corner across from Nat and smelt-...he smelt absolutely
did," he admitted honestly.
Of grief and regret
Steve's eyes softened and he even sniffled a little bit as he replied, "Oh of course, Tony, I'm yours!"
The buzz, the control, the smell of the gas and becoming one with the machine.
The next few minutes went by quickly, save for a few occasional hisses of pain from the brunette amidst his quiet hums of pleasure.
Her first act of endearment began with a good-natured punch to Tony's arm.
Tony looked up.
Cool and earnest steel blue eyes looked back at the conflicted eyes of chocolate brown.
And then the silence appears
"Yes, he did come to visit," Stephen replied, all traces of cheerfulness gone, "Much to my and Miss Potts' disapproval."
He'd win the genius back! He loved Tony too much to just give up. He'd prove to Tony how valuable Steve held him, even if it took the captain a thousand lives!
"You don't have to be scared with me, Tony. I promise you that ... I... I
Steve leaned forwards, nodding for Happy to continue next to him.
Nat noticed his blush, but didn’t comment on it. She merely quirked an eyebrow, giving Steve an assessing stare.
where Tony was.
**                 *                   **
Steve's goofy smile was more than enough to make Nat smile in return.
Steve couldn't do anything.
That brought Tony some consolation at least.
She silently dared him to go at her.
Morgan would come by later to visit Nat. He didn’t know how to feel about it, really. Maybe there would be room in her heart to let Steve into her life after all that happened between him and her dad.
"But," he continued, "She has to solve this case with the help of a fox, Nick Wilde. And Nick... you uhm... you get to learn of his troubled past. You get to see h-how he grew up... being bullied... And...  hi-his main insecurity is that, uhm, that the world will- will never see him as something outside of being a trickster. A liar."
Tony had become lost. And Nat was terribly frightened that Steve would be the only option to make him better.
“Woah, Honey,” Steve caught him before he hit the tiles, laughing at his dramatic boyfriend.

Steve rolled his eyes, even though Tony couldn’t see and slowly reached in and, one by one, he placed the five mice in the plastic box. He put a few sunflower seeds from his nibbled trail mix in there as well.
“My Honeybaby,” he murmured.

Tony ducked his head sheepishly. Steve cradled his chin, staring lovingly into Tony’s eyes, “I mean it- you’re my one and only, Mister.”
The words were out. Tony waited.
That earned a lot of shushing from the team, but the love birds obviously didn't care.
Steve wouldn't let himself be riled up, but he had to admit the doctor was good. His blood was boiling as he clenched his hands into fists.
The alpha slowly turned his body, and came face to face with Tony, stricken and shivering with shock.

He then suddenly heard the sound of tires screeching on the gravel!
“I’ve missed you,” Steve whispered, barely a breath, “Missed you terribly.”
Another beat of silence.

"My love for
As he dusted off, still keeping a weary eye on Nat, he looked up to see a very sleepy Tony! He was rubbing his eyes adorably like a tiny kid!
Steve smiled, raising his hands apologetically, “Alright, alright. As you wish, Honey.”
Tony’s smile grew wider.
It would be his first ever race tonight, if anyone was up for going against him. For now though, he observed the scene, trying to remain casual. There was an area to the side where sexy young women showed off their well-built bods and dance moves in skin tight clothing, or barely any clothing at all.
And it seems like someone else knew that too.
The brunette moaned happily, letting Steve dominate and cradle his head softly as the kiss deepened. Tony moaned, pulling Steve closer to feel every inch of his body. Kissing Steve was like kissing sunshine and honey. It was sweet and soft and tantalizing. His hands held Tony securely, his lips connecting them as one.
You would laugh and call me poetic
Fuck.
One of Tony's eyebrows was raised in silent questioning, the only tell-tale sign that he was truly confused by the turn of events.
Steve was
“Of course, Captain Rogers,” the AI chirped happily.
"No, Tones, no, no. Don't you dare blame yourself for this," Steve protested, rubbing slow circles onto the scientist's back, "
James, but... I know that I can't keep you from everything..."
Happy’s eyes saw through everything in Steve. It was oddly refreshing to have a calm council from someone who hadn’t resented him yet.
But again, it made him think about
Something inside Tony finally let go then. He was tired. He was tired of the resentment. Steve knew that he was in for a chewing out, but he wasn't backing down. Steve knew he deserved Tony's words that would come. But underneath all that, Tony still loved the man for braving it. For wanting to prove to the mechanic that he had genuinely changed for the better.
His four-year old self was still fidgeting non-stop and Natasha was at her wit's end trying to calm him down.
she knew they were standing there.

It was a tense few moments. Steve tried his best to recount what had happened in the store under the glowering looks from Rhodey and Pepper.

he wanted with this information and Tony braced himself for the hard part.
“We’ll work it out together, Antoshka. We always do," She rubbed his back reassuringly," And you’ll be alright. I’ve got you right here in my arms.”
Tony scrabble up messily, collecting his groceries and the stranger’s, babbling apologies back and forth.
"You're a remarkable person, Tony. And life's too short to let remarkable people slip through your fingers."
Natasha remembered how one conversation had led to Tony even having a panic attack.
"No. No. Nope. No way.
To add to that happiness, Tony couldn't help but smile, his eyes still closed, as he heard Steve's voice join in to sing along with the next lyric:
He buried his face in Steve's neck, but mumbled one last thing before dozing off under the covers, cocooned by Steve's warmth.
Tony almost cried with relief.
Please stick around for the next chapter and kudos and shares are always appreciated. 💙
So, he’d gone and booked the both of them a surprise two – week trip to Italy!
Tony's car was now only a few mere inches from Steve's foot. He was here...
Only a few more centimeters…
The Norse God's thunderous voice echoed throughout Natasha's entrance hall, accompanied by the gigantic
"You'll still be here when I wake up, right? You won't leave?" Tony mumbled, the vibrations tickling Steve's throat a little.
"We are getting the whole team, right?" Tony asked.
It couldn’t have been more universally complimentary: Steve was the artist of the past and Tony was the scientist of the future. Yin and Yang.
A sudden gasp escaped her!
"Says the man who initiated the kiss in the first place," Tony retorted, his nose scrunching up adorably as he teased back at his boyfriend.
"No, Sir, I-
"Hopefully he makes the decision that gives him happiness," Stephen murmured.
Tony looked up in wonder.
Tony looked dumbfounded and a little nervous, still, so Steve pecked him on the nose, causing the genius to blush and grin sheepishly!
Tony's heart stopped. His owl-eyes magnified even larger.

Steve’s heart summersaulted. “Oh, Tony you don’t need to be,” he murmured softly, “Because no matter what, you are

There was so much desperation in Steve’s voice, it made Tony’s breath stop. He looked at Steve again-
- I missed ya something fierce! I'm
"Please say something, Tony," Steve whispered thickly.
Tony whimpered again shamefully and more wetness gathered between his thighs. More sweat gathered over his bosy. He clutched desperately at his stomach and his eyes were screwed shut as he tried to ignore the pounding ache.
But then the thought hit him.
“Okay, so, I planned a small little picnic for us today, but then the rain happened, so I thought of the next best thing: a small indoors picnic by the fireplace. And don’t worry, I told the others to stay on their floors and not to bother us today.”
"Oh Tony, no! Iif anything it's my fault. I shouldn't have put so much on to your plate.
He could feel every nerve light up where Tony's hand touched--he felt safe; he felt rescued in Tony's hold.
"You grew a beard!" Tony laughed, finally smiling that dazzling look.
So, she was

Tony blushed

There was silence.
She gave a sympathetic smile.
So, this is a relatively short chapter, but I thought of just posting a breaker in the story. I estimate about two more chapters are left in this story.
“If Tony is hiding somewhere only Tony would hide, then there’s now way to discover that hiding place now. But I do hope he’s at least keeping warm. God knows I’d want to stay in a hot bath and bundle up away from all things scary.”
This one must've been terrible. He held Tony closer and shushed him gently.
," Tony continued, "You're a good man, Steve. You're practically made of gold, it's both refreshing and infuriating. Yeah, I know I can trust you, because that's who you are. And it's a good thing."
"Hi!" Tony greeted, his voice a calm breeze on the waves. His eyes told Bucky that he was surprised to see the fellow omega, but the genius' good nature was just as surprising to the former assassin.
Tony nodded. His eyes were still pinched closed; his lips pulled into a thin line.
, but the Omega never let himself fall to pieces in front of Peter, so he only lifted his chin and tried for steady, “Thank you. I appreciate it. We um-- we won’t be any trouble.”
This was about Pete and their future, not whatever the hell those Alpha-red tinted blue eyes were doing to his heart.
The front door was closed but not locked and that only dialed Steve’s anxiety up higher because his front door was
“I’m not saying that.” Tony tried to smile but it came out a grimace. “I don’t think he meant to do it, honest. I think we were both young and inexperienced with heat and Alphas watch a lot of porn, you know? I think he saw it in porn and saw the Omegas on screen pretending to be heat drunk and drooling and then really enjoying the sex while being pinned down at the nape of their neck... and I think he thought that it was a good thing, so that’s what he did to me.”

Steve caught the barely there trill as Tony regained his footing, and he wanted to

Tony had initiated kiss after kiss after sharply biting

“I… did.” Tony held out his hand for Peter as the recently three year old came tearing over with a piece of grass that was wildly fascinating, then went tearing back away to discover something new. “I hadn’t even realized we were close to the park until we left that wedding venue. I used to play here all the time, but once my Mama got sick we stopped coming. I was probably eleven the last time we walked through here.”
There was Peter’s favorite cereal and Tony’s favorite blend of coffee and the salsa that Steve practically drank on taco nights. Cleaning products since the service only came once every three weeks and the current spray Steve used gave him a headache. Twin sized bed sheets because the Omega knew the race car bed was inevitable, a water proof liner to help with the potty training, and a nightlight for the bedroom since Tony knew he’d end up in Steve’s bedroom full time and he didn’t want Peter to worry about the dark.

“I--” Tony was stunned-- no no, not stunned. The Omega was
“Great.” Tony made a show of turning around and throwing his hands up so Steve wouldn’t see just what it did to his heart to see Peter copying and teasing with him. “That’s great. Thank you.”
“It wasn’t fun.” Tony swallowed, thinking about long nights at dangerous shelters and being turned away from religious organizations because he wasn’t interested in adoption and

“No, don’t worry about it, we’re still roasting smores and setting off fireworks! Rogers parties never stop!” The noise behind the Alpha quieted as if Steve had moved inside. “Did you have a good day?”
That had been
Big hands at Tony’s thighs and the Omega gasped a little when he was bodily dragged right onto Steve’s lap. He scrambled to unfold his legs so he could straddle the Alpha’s thighs but the world went abruptly topsy turvy
“Bucky.” Steve stopped and pinched at his nose, counting to ten so his eyes weren’t red when he turned to glare at the other Alpha. “Stop talking or I’ll kill you.”
She shrieked when someone grabbed the back of her shirt and bodily lifted her out of the door and out of the way. “Damn it, Valkyrie. Leave him alone, go get your Alpha to give you another shot or something. Quit harrassing the pretty Omegas.”
“Too late bud, we already saw you grinning like a Goofy Gooberson.” Bucky set two big bag of groceries down on the table, then turned to take the smaller bag from his mate. “Why do you look all stupid like that? You texting that Omega?”

“I feel like I’d be inclined towards the Bridezilla thing.” the Omega admitted slowly. “But um-- why the wedding? Is that what you want? Or is it really just for me? Because we don’t have to if you’d rather not.”
“Pete!” the Alpha called frantic. “Pete? You okay? Oh shit,
, and Tony knew his face was burning as he peeled off a few bills for the sweet Alpha then dropped the box of steak off on her table. “His name is Steve and he’s very handsome. Very polite. He even paid for my Uber home.”
First it was the jacket that Tony never quite managed to return and Steve wouldn’t have accepted anyway, then it was the pillows. They went out for sushi one night and Tony mentioned loving spring rolls, so the Alpha had all the ingredients delivered for their next date night, and sent Tony home with the tools and extra ingredients to make it again. There was a discussion about sci-fi movies, so Steve ordered collectors edition sets of the Omega’s favorite series, and Tony didn’t dare mention he didn’t have a TV
It felt good.
"But why would you associate something as glorious as music with a term alike to sickness or violence?"
Five seconds that Steve didn't even feel was enough, because

Tony saw his daddy's warm smile directed at him and he blushed.
“Only you have my love,” he cried deeply, “Only you, Tony. Only you… Only your eyes will I see… every night before I sleep. Only your laugh is the sweetest sound. And only your heart has mine… even after it stops beating.”
He knew that look.
*                 *                    *
It took a few seconds for Tony to identify her and her familiar scent. But soon, his shivering stopped as Nat gently ran her fingers through his matted curls and let her hand rest on his cheek.
“I know I’m going to regret this so badly, but what list are you talking about, Tony?”
"I love you too," he whispered, almost too afraid to say it, like he was immediately preparing for the backslash and judgment, as from his father.
Alpha, please!
Tony gasped, flinching back minutely.
Tony leaned up too, but Steve stopped him, putting a hand on Tony's heart and he kissed him chastely, before the blonde swiftly removed his shirt and threw it across the room in one motion!

Tony hiccupped wetly before launching himself into Steve’s arms.
Clint and Thor were busy playing street racer video games on the floor in front of the TV, while Nat and Wanda were snuggling on the couch watching videos on Wanda's laptop.
The mad titan didn't know what he in for!
He waited until it reached 140m/h, then
Steve shuffled himself back up against his headboard with Tony in his lap and gently juggled him up and down with his knee... Stroking his baby's back up and down in as much a soothing pattern he could do.
Steve nodded.
"Do they make up?" Steve's heart was beating rapidly.
“Tony! Tony wait!” Steve called after him, but people were flooding in so it was easy for Tony to weave through.
The scene broke Natasha's heart.
Ten more seconds…

"Yes! It's quite remarkable. Stardust DNA is passed down through a selective few descendants from the families of the Luminals - the ancients created on Earth around the same time as the Atlantians. Tony and Mr Rogers must have that DNA, so their bond goes back eons. Now, through that bond, their subconscious, their- their gut instincts are in sync. It's like a whole other thread of communication formed besides the obvious one of talking."
"Can you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team," he joked, closing the trunk. Steve sighed. Hopefully he'd get his chance to show Tony that the genius

Pepper Potts tried feebly to hold Rhodey back, but she wasn’t fast enough, before Rhodey gripped Steve by his shirt and shoved him straight against the wall! Steve felt the wind punched out of him as he was strung up a few centimetres off the floor.
Panting and groaning as he shrunk against the cabinets, Tony's eyes watered as his heat began... and he had no idea how he was going to get through it...
He brushed away the thought, standing straighter.
Their voices faded away as Steve let himself absorb this new information about Tony Stark.
Steve hesitantly reached out a hand.
Getting to Tony’s penthouse floor, Steve let the brunette change quickly into a vest and boxers in the bathroom while he shucked off his shoes and stuffed his socks in.
She mostly exaggerated her movements for Tony's entertainment, but the thought of Tony's chocolate-chip pancake recipe really was quite appealing. Tony had taste!
Steve blinked open his eyes, coming out of the daze from feeling Tony's skin on his.
boy ever! And Steve knows this. That's why he misses you too. He misses you
A few slow minutes passed. The rain fell now like dew drops in the dawn, its steady pitter-patter drumming soundly against the roof.
"Shh... shh, now... hey, it's okay... It's okay, Tony, shh… There, now, it's alright… Shh… shh… You're okay… You're okay."
. Whether there is a bond or not, their connection is something deeper beyond simple Alpha-Omega DNA. It's something that many scientists and mystics believe is what was left from the glow of merging galaxies soon after The Big Bang. In layman's terms: stardust DNA."
they took one look at me, decided I must have stolen that fucking watch and were ready to have me tossed in jail!”
“You also forgot about the gravy.” The Omega giggled, lips moving at Steve’s bare chest as he spoke, reluctant to pull away just yet. He was reveling in the newness of the relationship and the freedom he and Pete suddenly had, the lack of stress Tony hadn’t realized was
call me Alpha again.”
He paused when Steve bent to kiss him, their breath clouding in the air as they parted. “What was that for?”
“You’re so wet for me.” The squelch of lube between their bodies was indecent, the scratch of Steve’s leg hair chafing at Tony’s rear over sensitive as they rocked together. “So wet, take me so well, gonna fill you right up, I swear to god.”
. “Anthony, I know. But if you would allow me to know your family, yourself and your mate and your child, my grandchild, then--”
No, it wasn’t Tony’s fault but everything
“Where did you grow up?” Steve found another green chili on his burger and dropped it on Tony's plate, not because he hated them but because Tony so obviously
Steve had still sort of felt like cracking Bucky’s skull open right up until he saw Bucky and Tony laughing together as the Alpha topped off his wine. Tony had still been anxious until he saw just how much Peter adored Natasha and even accepted Bucky, even though the toddler

He ducked to avoid a gross rag being flung at him. “Okay fine, does Mr. Rogers seem less

The second and third boxes were filled with bottoms, butter soft leggings in basic colors and then in fun prints, black jeans for work that had a little stretch for comfort and reinforced seams so Tony wouldn’t have to patch them so often, several pairs of dark denim with decorative pockets and all the structure needed to hug the Omega’s little waist and still fit over his rear.
and that’s not-- kids aren’t anything I’m thinking about right now. Not-- no. No, that isn’t really what I’m--”
The baby started crying and Tony immediately tried to hush him, the Omega clicking his tongue and crooning, “Shh shh baby baby. S’okay. Daddy’s got you. It’s okay Pete, what a rough way to wake up from a nap, huh? What a rough way for such a pretty baby to wake up from a nap. S’okay. We’re okay.”
with this mouth.” Tony looped his arms around the Alpha and yanked him in for a real kiss, a messy kiss, teeth and tongue and fangs biting sharp until they tasted arousal tinted blood. Steve groaned through it, sealed his mouth at Tony’s bottom lip and sucked hard, grinding his cock forward into the Omega’s soft body until Tony mewled and gasped and stood on his toes trying to draw it out longer.

“Here’s a list of items you’ll need to pick up to make sure the baby doesn’t need a repeat visit.” She tore off a list and handed it to Tony stiffly. “Pedialyte to help with his fluid intake, baby Tylenol to break the fever and a few other items. I would
“I never said silky.” Tony patted his Alpha on the leg and stood up to stretch, winking over his shoulder when Steve automatically groped at his ass. “But I did say lace.”
It was three am and Tony was only now off shift at the diner. The Omega hadn’t heard his phone buzz with the message from Steve nearly six hours ago and even though replying at some god-awful time of the morning was most likely a stupid idea, the Alpha had messaged back

“It’s almost why I didn’t want to use the Uber at first.” The Omega admitted very quietly. “I was afraid you’d look and see the pick up point and realize what part of town I lived and think-- I mean, I don’t know

“And no one faults
“You-- you smell good too.” Tony turned his nose enough to scent at Steve too, breathing in the already familiar scent of rosewood and heady pine that had lingered at the back of his throat all week long, every time he wore the Alpha's jacket. His fingers swept up to land in Steve's hair as the Alpha murmured something else hoarse and
that had come from Steve’s mouth during sex to argue about his hips being up. He didn’t have the will or strength to argue when Steve skipped the usual clean up and instead curled up with his head on Tony’s chest, and when Steve also spread his fingers protectively overly Tony’s swollen stomach…
left outside the tight channel the Alpha automatically reached for the nape of Tony’s neck, digging his fingers into the sensitive skin so the release of hormones would ease any flash of pain or discomfort, too focused on trying to make sure Tony felt good to think if he should have asked before trying to settle the Omega even the barest bit. “Too much? Does this make it better?”
parts of Tony’s story came out little by little, quiet conversations after Peter had gone to bed, hesitant questions and uncomfortable answers as Steve tried hard not to pry as he learned more about his Omega and the way life had brought Tony and Peter to this place.

about sex for the first time in years, for the first time since Peter when his stomach wasn’t as flat and his thighs weren’t as toned, and for the first time in a sugar daddy type of situation, but he couldn’t manage being nervous for long when Steve crowded him in against the kitchen counter and tilted his head back to kiss him senseless.

He rolled his hips pointedly and Steve turned his face into Tony’s soft thigh and sighed reverenly. “Damn Omega, who’s to say I don’t intend to spoil the hell out of
“Oh–oh–oh–!” Tony made an awkward sort of noise, both embarrassed and aroused when the plug slid free with a lewd sucking sound, lube and come sluicing down his legs and sliding with a gurgle down the drain. “

“Internal massage?!” Tony
If it weren’t for Peter the Omega would have given up long ago, if it weren’t for messy smiles and droolly kisses and the unbridled enthusiastic love of a two year old, Tony didn’t know if he would have made it to twenty one at all, he would have let this life tear him apart and cast him aside.

with less trouble than I had trying to wrangle that baby into a pull up for bedtime.” Bucky declared and the Omega laughed at him. “Dunno how toddlers can be that damn wriggly, it just ain’t right.”
he wasn’t going to mention it was the Upper East side.
And that meant Tony had to assuage Steve’s fears so the Alpha would be open to another date. Another date meant another bit of allowance which would go a long way towards rent, especially with Tony still too sick to work. He had to take another day and rest so he’d have the energy to be flirty and smiley for work to get good tips and afford groceries and some cold medicine for himself. He needed the money for a trip to the laundromat to clean their blankets and sheets after being coughed on for a solid week. He had to come up with the cash to pay Peggy to keep Peter while he tried to work extra hours, he needed to count his box of bills and make sure they were covered because the doctors appointments and medicine had taken all the extra money and Tony couldn't honestly remember if he’d had to dip into the electric bill money to cover that last prescription and before he could do any of that, he had to make sure Steve felt secure about them, that the Alpha wasn’t going to give up on them even though they couldn’t meet up for another few weeks and-- and--
A watery smile locked on Steve's face.
Tony’s head shot up, “How did you-?”
He looked into her sharp stare, seeing how she tried to cover up her worry.
'Mmmmhhmm...' Tony hummed contently. 'Feels nice... Feel too warm... Uugghh! Too hot! Mhmum... Why do I feel so hot? Ugh, it's like fire! Cold isn't working!'
and the next thing Nat knew, she and Tony were barreling across the carpet, wrestling each other to the death!
Stroking Tony’s cheek, Steve let himself get lost in his beauty. The soft wrinkles at the corners of his eyes that showed how much he was laughing these days. How soft and peaceful he looked as he slept. It was really beautiful.
, the blonde thought. Tony had probably already concluded at least a dozen alternatives at which this situation would pan out and, based on Steve's response -which Tony presumed would a negative one; ever the pessimist! - he'd select the response in which case, Tony would either bow out gracefully, or be hurt again at Steve's hands.
She gave Tony one last peck on the forehead and soon enough, quiet snores began to fill the living room. She rested Tony’s head in her lap and pulled a blanket over his sleeping form.
"C'mon Strange, you're keeping a scientist away from his science. A mechanic away from his mechanisms. A-"
Steve Rogers stood outside the Compound with his head hanging low; his hands on his hips and he contemplated the next step forward.
Pepper kissed his cheek, smirking, "We'll check on you later, Billionaire Philanthropist. Enjoy the jelly and Spanish soap operas!"
Tomorrow will be another day. Miss Rogers would go with Jarvis to collect Tony's things and have him stay here for the next few months until he turned eighteen. Then he wouldn't have to worry about Howard anymore.
"No, it was only one time between me and Bucky," Steve replied, if a little defensive, "It took a helluva long time, but me and him are in a good place now. Sam and Buck have been dating for three months now."
“Tony, you don’t trust me, that I know. But this is me reaching out, offering to help a teammate… hoping to help a friend?”
Slowly, carefully, at a steady pace so that Tony saw each movement and could back away anytime he wanted.
They dozed off listening to each other's laughter.
The omega sat propped up against the hospital bed pillows, calmly watching some TV. Bucky cleared his throat albeit timidly. Looking up, a small, bright smile appeared on Tony's face which surprised Bucky greatly.
Natasha pouted deeply, puffing out her cheeks and lips, making Tony laugh a bit harder!
find a way to break Mjolnir, so help me!"
He began undressing as Steve found him some dry clothes to change into.
“I need your help today with Morgan, Steve,” she said. Steve startled.
The double meaning of alpha possessiveness was not lost on the supersoldier.
The dizziness was still present and his head began throbbing. Tony tried gulping in some fresh air, but the nausea wouldn’t leave. Only a few more paces to Happy’s car, then it was smooth sailing. But then someone grabbed his shoulder.
Curling up on the floor
The crowd's reaction rose higher- clapping their hands and
Steve's smile was brilliantly bright. Holding out his hand, in silent question, he asked for Tony's.
His eyes were closed and a dopey smile donned his face. She chuckled, wiping away his sweat-ridden curls.
Steve entered the garage to find his genius going over countless holographic plans and blueprints. His hands maneuvering through the air skilfully. The captain smiled adoringly. His Love was so brilliant, Steve couldn’t be prouder. However, that also meant that His Love overworked himself to the bone almost every day. Thankfully, Steve knew how just the trick to change Tony’s mind about going to sleep.
Tony tried shoving Steve’s arms away, preparing to run off again.
“S-Steve?” Tony tried again, his voice a bit stronger, but it still came out as a tiny mouse’s whimper.
And they were alive.
"Alright," he agreed, "I'll take a chance. But I… I'm… I'm scared, Steve."
“Come on, Honey,” he murmured, “time for bed.”
*                             *                                 *
The alpha and the omega gazed into each other's eyes.
She was silent for a moment.
to hear you cry.
Rhodey rolled his eyes, squeezing Tony's leg comfortingly, "Don't worry Tones, you'll be out of here soon enough to put my nerves on high alert once more."
The ache, the burning, had cooled. His slick had Nat slide in smoothly, soothing his walls and bringing sensational relief.
The kind of breath you that you inhale when someone applies an anti-septic to a blood wound.

Everything was
The brunette gave him a poke in the shoulder, “And what is the subject, O-Captain, My Captain?”
Tony giggled at that, gazing up again into Steve's smiling face.
"We weren't together," continued Steve, holding Tony close as they made their way down the ramp to the group.
"I trust that you won't bust my engine, so you're welcome to take a look if you want," he offered, gesturing to his car. Tony's jaw dropped to the ground.
“Please leave me alone Nat,” he hurriedly said, stalking off to the elevator across the kitchen.
"Oh, I-I'm... I'm s-sorry," he mumbled to Steve, wiping his tears off with his sleeve.
"It's not like I
Steve frowned at that. He held Tony's hand in his, giving it a gentle squeeze. It made the mechanic blush once more, but Steve nodded gently for him to continue.
“Hardy-Har-
“Of course, Captain.”
"Wh-what's with the-the eyes, huh?" the brunette shivered, his voice wavering as he tried not to let his cries overflow, "Can- can't a guy c-come s-s-see his fe-fe-fella?"
He stiffly handed Steve his basket of groceries, not entirely looking his direction.
He held the genius closer as they sat on Steve's bed, the only sounds being Tony's dying whimpers and Steve's voice humming softly.
And everyone else looked completely fine. They were all laughing and drinking soda and Tony had been having fun the whole night.
so loudly nonetheless.
Happy’s car was nearby. Without a moment to lose, Steve picked up Tony bridal-style with the basket and all, and bulldozed his way through the crowd to Happy’s limo.

was left unsaid in the air.
“Steve,” Bucky’s thin voice was the only sound to break through in the room as he tried to bring Steve’s attention to the situation.
Caressing the tears off his boyfriend's cheeks, Steve placed one last kiss on his nose before heading to the bathroom for the first aid kit.
"All I'm saying is… you were left alone with barely any physical contact, any emotional contact or reassurance from me that I still loved you while I was working. We would, sure, go to bed together and wake up beside each other, but those moves were robotic, expected. There were no little moments of surprise kisses and cuddles and spoiling one another-
"I don't think I ordered any more flowers," Tony teased. It caused Bucky to blush, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly.

Just as their physical pain was caused by the body's flesh, long ago... their recovery was made whole again by a kiss, now.
It was a surreal few seconds. Steve wasn't sure if it was the evening breeze blowing by, but he could swear something in the air shifted then. Something
The quietness won’t quit
“Sweetheart, don’t you think it’s a little self-absorbed to refer to yourself like that?” Steve deadpanned.
by whoever her target was, and
Tony blushed. Steve placed another swift kiss on his forehead.
In the second it took for Tony to peer into the box, it took another for him to almost faint to the floor!
Without even a second glance, he threw Tony over the railing, sending the boy cascading, flying, down two floors and landing with a
He couldn't solve this equation.
Nat changed into one of her favourite sleep-shirts and slid in behind Tony, collecting him close.
He was family.
“Yeah?” he panted.
careful with that giving attitude there, Steven, because a first time racer like you can't really trust just anybody to get too close to his car," Tony grinned, flashing pearl-white teeth that made him look completely dashing. Steve's stomach flipped once again.
He turned his head. The man looked tired. In fact, Steve was surprised there was no glaring, no hateful bite in his tone… nothing. He filled out one last page and then focused on Steve.
"It's like this: if I win, then I get your blessing to take your brother, Tony, out on a date."
. Something small and dangerous, but people love it for its small and cute nature.”
Steve stuttered, "I-I di-didn't- you w- I m-mean- what? No!- I- I mean, I would never!- without-"
"Let's put your wheels to the test."
Steve briskly walked back into the living room after searching every possible place for Tony.
"Watch your step, on your way in, please Tony. I've been painting and molding - and God knows what else! - to cope. So, my art supplies are everywhere!"
"And I'm yours," Tony whispered thickly and teary-eyed!
Tony had had a nightmare.
But never let it be ignored the relief that Steve felt the next morning, when he woke up to the normal, adult Tony cuddling close to Steve’s chest still in a larger kitten onesie.
“But Tony’s version of ‘okay’ is different from ours. What if he
But she was so caught up in her thoughts, she didn't see Little Tony hiding by the door frame. He was sucking lightly on his thumb and listening in to Nat's worried muttering.
He felt it as it started bubbling up in
“Caramel pumpkin cakes,” Steve stated proudly, “for my pumpkin.”
thought Tony, rolling his eyes.
"Oh, I know," Steve grinned smugly, "Just gives me an excuse to hold you in my arms a little longer, is all."
Steve groaned, diving back down to sleep.
- Steve can't help you! He doesn't
He had spent every day and every night drinking in the crisp, honey tone of that voice once he realized that he was in love with the owner of said voice.
Tony clung to Steve, his tiny hands clasped around his daddy’s neck, hugging him fiercely.
... I hurt you so bad. I was a monster! So cruel and merciless and you didn't deserve that shield coming down- I-"

“Well, I-“
" a new voice suddenly called out. Tony squeezed his eyes shut, sighing. He leant closer to Steve before turning his attention over to a red-head standing in front of them.
try to pull something, well... it gave Tony a sense of calmness and increased confidence.
Natasha's narrowed cat-eye stare dug deep into Steve's skin and he couldn't help but to audibly gulp in fear.
talking about Disney characters.
They were true soulmates.
“Um J.A.R.V.I.S, can you tell me where the first-aid kit is?” Steve asked, still keeping a watchful eye on Tony.
He saw...

Cheers erupted all around!
His baby squealed at the sudden movement and giggled happily as he briefly swung through the air!
"Yeah, the, uh, nurse had to put this antiseptic on my stitches, but just then, Bruce needed help calming down, so she had to bolt. And I can't leave, because they're obviously going to check the cameras and know that I haven't gotten my full medical exam."
The thunder roared on. The rain beat against Tony's body. He stood with his hands around himself, trying not to shake. About seven long minutes passed, and he was just about to give up when the door opened and a baffled Steve Rogers stood wide-eyed at the door.
Steve took a good long look into Tony's eyes and the worry beneath the layers of cool facade.
win! Mercy! Mercy!"
Five seconds in which Steve held on to Tony's rough, calloused hand that had created so many wonderful things Steve was privileged to have witnessed being made. A touch like fire. Sparks flying.
Parting moments later, panting lightly, Steve stared dazzlingly at Tony, “God, I love you!”
The team found it both equally endearing and both equally
"Alright, Rookie… let's race!"
A melancholy sigh left Steve's lips as few tears fell from sea-blue eyes, but the baby continued to smile, hoping to make the alpha happy.
“I love you three thousand, Daddy,” Tony whispered.
Tony just didn't know it yet...
She pecked Bucky's cheek.

When it came to the people closest to him, you could see Steve's facade- his mask - crack at the edges. He would get desperate, and Captain America wouldn't be the one talking down a villain that held one of them at gunpoint.
gift in the history of make-up presents.“
'Tony's been in the kitchen for a while now... I'd better go check on him,' Natasha wiggled out of the burrow of pillows she'd formed with Wanda and slipped into the kitchen. Thankfully everyone else was (concernly) too invested in Thor and Clint's racing game to notice.
It was all he could do after seeing Natasha haul him like a piece of meat! But, then again... a lioness
It sunk down deep within him and took root in his soul. He felt it- he felt
“I suppose you know now,” Steve whispered, his breath hitching with every tear-filled cry, “I suppose you know now how much I-“
"Of course, Doll," Steve replied, smiling dopily.
Steve squeezed his hand reassuringly, “I sometimes get scared of sleeping too. I get nightmares of this all being a dream or a hallucination and I’m stuck in the ice again as the cold washes over me. I hear Peggy’s voice, but I can’t answer… So, I know it’s scary, but I’ll stay with you.”
Or to tell you something unsaid
"Well, did you order a confused omega? 'Cause I think that has been mailed successfully."

He made it.
Bucky was struck speechless, his mouth agape. However, Tony's smile was so infectious and welcoming, it made Bucky's lips tug upwards in a grin too.
” the anxiousness radiated off him and through his voice. Tony, sniffing the air, cowered further into Nat’s side as he smelt Clint’s uncertainty. He sniffled a shameful whimper.
“Oh, come here!”
Steve ignored that part of his head. He nodded for Tony to continue.

Thor furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, making him look like an adorably lost teddy bear.
“Thor,” Steve’s tone held no room for argument, “You’re the

clear to you..."
"Yeah," he mumbled softly, "Yeah, I'll take the first step."
Both of Steve's hands came up to frame Tony's face, gently. Steve's hands were big and warm and so careful with Tony. As if he was a precious treasure.
He was starting to laugh incredulously while Steve stared at him in shock, open-mouthed!
“That doesn’t exactly aspire much confidence Steve.”
They both inspire each other to be better every day, and are at their very best when they are together.
Natasha gently pulled Tony up onto his feet and guided him into her house. Tony felt weightless. His limbs fumbled loosely like noodles and he couldn’t seem to focus on anything. His gaze was far away. Nat saw how bloodshot his eyes were. His nose was still red and runny and tear tracks stained his cheeks.
He nodded in agreement.
“Come jump in, genius, I miss your warmth!”
But he didn't.
"I didn't raise no fag! I didn't raise no wimp who can't even throw a punch to defend himself!"
And the soldier realized that not a single word of what he just said was a lie.

"Please accept my apologies then, Steven Grant Rogers. I place my complete trust in you."
You're my Sweet Tony, I'll love you most for forever"
His tears of relief nearly burst through and he tried blinking them back, breathing in so shakily that Steve started slowly rubbing small circles over his back.
The light bulb went off in Steve’s brain.
Nat merely blew him a kiss on their way out.
She would make Howard suffer so hard one day.
He stood in front of the great brass statue. The memorial for the greatest defender of Earth. The greatest Avenger.
"J-Jarvis?" he called out, his voice still wavering with tears.
So, here's the link to the Steve&Tony video featuring James TW's song:
, my good captain," she purred innocently, "had come down to help me with the dishes. I then recall ramming you to the floor and you squealed like a five-year old girl! I believe your exact words before disaster struck were... "
‘It’s like talking to Nat and Tony in one person,’ Steve sighed, mumbling a ‘yeah’ in response. Jenny seemed satisfied with that and went back to her work.
Steve rolled his eyes again, but couldn’t help smiling fondly, “You need to rest. You need to sleep.”
“Well, you’d better come along, because you got some paperwork to fill out and I can’t carry Tony alone.”
"But..." Tony continued, "the past cannot be changed. It can only be rightened. And I'm not gonna run from it anymore... We both came out of it wiser. A little bit stronger too, so I'm not regretting it. Some days, yes, it will hurt, but old wounds still hurt, Steve, because that's just basic biology!"
Tony sighed, after a moment, internally admitting defeat, and stood up with his basket in his hands, acting as some kind of barrier, and faced the inevitable.
Steve clenched his teeth, willing the gut-wrenching sob to be forced back down, but it was futile. His hand shook over the statue’s heart, clutching at the air and hoping it was the cloth of Tony’s shirt to grip in his hands. Willing it to be Tony’s warm flesh beneath his clothes to hold against Steve’s own.
Steve hated that Tony always felt obligated to expect the worst from their conversations. Not that Steve had ever given Tony reason to think otherwise...
Steve would be courteous, he'd always ask for Tony's consent, but would go against Tony, only because he somehow always knew what was right for him at the end of the day!
The ride in the elevator was peaceful and quiet. Tony snuggled up like a kitten into Steve’s body and neck and Steve never wanted to let go of the feeling he had, when Tony was in his arms, right then and there.
funny!
Steve's soft lips dancing with his.
Steve's stare was open, puppy-eyed. But a little guarded layer of pride stood behind the look.
The red-head would never have so much fun in any other place than when she's with Tony- toddler or normal. She'd never admit to it straight off the bat, but spending time with him in his lab and helping him with his inventions and playing with DUM-E, was the most fun Natasha had ever experienced since working for SHIELD.
