The receptionist was now typing on his computer checking a card the shirt man had handed him earlier. Lestrade realized that he had never introduced himself, "My name is Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade" he calmly showed his badge, the mans eyes widened and he let out a soft chuckle, "That bloody bastard, this entire time I never knew your first name, he was always calling you Geoffrey, or Jeff, or Gavin, or other random G names" The man laughed again before grimacing as his shoulder moved, Lestrade wondered about that comment and became more suspicious.
John smiles fondly at him, "Of course love, but does that mean you will get the shopping with me?" he responds cheekily, Sherlock rolled his eyes but didn't stop smiling, "If I must" he says with fake (read half fake, half real) annoyance.
John and Sherlock look at each other before they start giggling, "Well...",Sherlock giggles, "at least I don't need to figure out how to introduce you two". John finishes his giggling and gives his husband a fond look. John leans forward and gives Sherlock another gentle kiss. It was peaceful in the little hospital room before John breaks the silence.
, he chuckled,he stepped into the cab and greeted Anthea and Mycroft. Mycroft told him that Sherlock was home now and thought John would appreciate the ride. John and Mycroft spoke for a while before arriving at 221B. John said goodbye and stepped up to the door and knocked. Mrs. Hudson opened the door and squealed, "John! What are you doing out in the cold love? Come on, I'll make you a cuppa and you can tell me what in heaven's name you're doing here young man" she exclaimed while pushing him into her flat and putting the kettle on.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but reached into his coat and pulled out his phone, Sherlock stared at the caller ID with undisguised annoyance. "Hello brother dear, and to what do I owe to hear your wonderful voice?" Sherlock answered sarcastically. The surrounding officers all stared at him, only Lestrade knew about him having a brother.
"Ah Shit!" both men exclaim, Mycroft holds his hand, while Anderson sits on the floor holding his jaw. Everyone's jaws drop, Sally shakes out of it first and she winks at Sherlock and John with a fond smile before roughly yanking Anderson to his feet and pushing him out the door with an angry look.
John turns to look at the receding figure of the bleeding rat-faced man, and then turning back to his husband, Sherlock gazes at him, "ready to go home my soldier?". John stares at his handsome detective, "Oh god yes".
The wound was red and angry looking, anyone could tell that it had been dug out and roughly patched. It looked like a starburst spreading out from the wound, the actual bullet wound was stitched closed. Sherlock promptly checked to make sure that none of the stitches were ripped, he let out a sigh of relief when he saw that they were all fine. He ordered a nearby paramedic for an ice pack to reduce the swelling.
John started heading down the hall and Lestrade started to follow him, noticing that Donovan and Anderson were following behind him. they must have caught what the man said, the three of them make their way to the hospital room, when they get there they see the man hesitate at the door before opening it and stepping in.
John grabbed Sherlock's hand and turned to walk away, walking briefly past Anderson when it happened. Anderson grabbed John's shoulder and tried to turn him to face him, "hey wait a second!" he said angrily, John screeched when Anderson grabbed his shoulder and fell to the floor, eyes screwed shut with pain. Sherlock quickly dropped beside John saying his name over and over. One of the soldiers that was closest tackled Anderson and restrained him.
"What do you want the freak for? Listen, you should stay away from him, he's a psychopath" she warned him. John's face turned to anger and he kept clenching and unclenching his fist. "Just tell me where he is, I know him and he is not a freak so tell. me. where. he. is!" he bit out. Donovan stared at him with annoyance and rolled her eyes, "You can check the morgue, he's probably checking a body that's part of a case at the moment". John looked at her and turned away sharply without a word. He went outside and hailed a cab after a few minutes.
Sherlock was waiting for John's call. After not being able to talk to John last month, Sherlock had been in a constant state of worry, he spent most of his time curled up in their (John and Sherlock's) bed, hugging one of John's favorite jumpers. Mrs. Hudson would come up and bring him food and tea and would try and get him to at least take a quick shower. Sherlock had always somewhat thought of Mrs. Hudson as a second mother, and after a relapse after John had first deployed, and calling Mrs. Hudson mum, Mrs. Hudson had taken it upon herself to take extra care of Sherlock, having always thought of him as the son she never had. During that month, Mrs.Hudson would sit beside Sherlock on the bed and would run her hands through his hair to calm him down when he was worrying to much and would send himself into a panic.
The two men blush again but Mycroft motions to the door, "Shall we, Gregory?" Mycroft asks calmly, his cheeks still slightly pink. Greg nods and starts heading out the door before quickly spinning around, "I knew you knew my name you arsehole, you can't pretend anymore!" Greg says victoriously, Sherlock smirks, "Of course George".
Sherlock thought as he paced the living room, John is coming home today and his plane wasn't landing for another 4 hours. Sherlock grimaced as he remembered the call he received a week ago.
Lestrade saw what was happening and quickly caught Sherlock along with Donovan, they slowly lowered the shaking detective to the ground. "W-where is he?!" Sherlock questioned vehemently.
John made his way up the stairs slowly before arriving at the door that was slightly ajar. He pushed it open wider and took in the scene, Donovan and a few other officers were looking around the flat while a silver haired officer tried to talk with Sherlock who was longing bored on the couch. John's eye's softened as he gazed at his Husband, feeling the wedding ring that was on his dog tags. Sherlock was skinnier than before, and paler too, John made a mental note to make sure he was sleeping and eating.
Rat face man is cut off by Sally Donovan's hand harshly connecting with his face. The air turns frigid and all noises cease, Donovan angrily stalks out of the room while Rat face man holds his cheek and looks shocked at what happened. Sherlock looks angry and on the verge of crying and John looks like he's about to commit a murder in 0.2 seconds.
The necklace had a marriage ring on the chain, and they all looked to Johns partially hidden left hand and saw an identical ring. Suddenly it all clicked and they realized that they were married.
Lestrade stood up and put his coffee in a nearby trash as he strode over to the man and receptionist. "Excuse me, I couldn't help over hearing, you said 122? I think you have the wrong room number mate" Lestrade said to the short man, the man in question looked at him in confusion and slight suspicion. "No, I am quite sure of the room number, and who are you? Why would you know whether or not I was right?"
nice to meet you John" Lestrade says before going to walk away, "thank you Greg" Sherlock says softly, Lestrade freezes before smiling to himself and walks away to join Sally.
"John can you sit up?" he asked worriedly, John opened his eyes, his breathing calming, "yes, but I definitely want to go home now, and maybe get some painkillers" he spat out. "Of course love", then turning to Lestrade, "can you drive us home... please". he asked softly, Lestrade looked back at John who was now being stood up by his friend's and putting an ice pack over his shoulder that was just re-bandaged by the paramedic.
"Ouch!" he says, but his face flushes. "We also already have a drawer full of sex toys." Sherlock waves him off. "I'd rather eat this ice cream."
Finally over dinner on the second day, Sherlock drained his water glass, and looked at John. “I think we should try out some of the bondage gear.”
John stood and surveyed the beds once Mike had left. Looking at them wasn’t changing the fact that they now had two twin beds in the room. John sighed.
After they’d shared thick slices of the cake around, and moaned about how good it was, Mrs. Watson declared it time for presents. Sherlock dashed back upstairs to find the things he’d gotten for John from inside his trunk. Suddenly feeling shy, he slipped the small box holding the bracelets into his pocket, and carried the bag of sweets downstairs.
Shock blankets and bars of chocolate for all who need them. I know it's a hard chapter. Things do get better later.
When all had been sorted, John rang off, feeling deeply unsettled as he hurried to make it to class before he was tardy.
“Sorry, you won’t see us again! Good luck!” Thomas called as they herded Kevin away, leaving John and Sherlock in relative peace.
“All right, you lot, enough,” John said, collecting his scroll from Tom to slip it safely into his pocket.
Mrs. Holmes was busy talking with a knot of people to the side, another middle aged woman who favored her face shape, and several  younger women in various country tweeds and plaids. Sherlock’s mother broke away when she saw them entering, ushering them over.
Sherlock’s letters came thick and fast with the Owl Post over the next fortnight, but then they tapered off again after that.  John has already sent him three notes and not heard  back. John sighed as his owl, Simpson, flew overhead at breakfast dropping off a letter from his mum, but no sign of anything from Sherlock.
“Ah, I hope you’ll excuse me. I see someone I’ve been wanting to talk to for ages. I’ll catch up with you two party animals later, okay?” She winked as she moved away.
“The two of you have become quite close over a very few months. Hmmm?” Mycroft arched his eyebrows skyward. “He stayed at your home for Spring Break, where he will be returning for another extended visit tomorrow. I wondered if we might be hearing a happy announcement by the end of the summer?” Mycroft tilted his head to the side as a smile that managed to look both mild and reptilian at the same time slid over his mouth.
Sherlock sucked in a shuddering breath. He had an overwhelming urge to cry from relief, but quickly blinked his eyes clear as a knock sounded at his door.
“Here, let me put the food in the kitchen,” John said, scooping up the large brown paper bag Sherlock had dropped. He carried it with one of his own across the living room, and into the back where he knew the kitchen lay.
“Not too bad.” Sherlock hastened to not look so ill that his mother would feel the need to call a doctor in. “Just a bit sick. I don’t feel up to a party.”
Sherlock took a few steps back, and before John had any idea what he was about, launched himself into a canon ball toward the pool. John cried out as a small tsunami of water crashed over his head. The children shrieked in delight at being caught in the blast radius.
The woman, who was it seemed merely an overly-helpful neighbor, placed the milk and toast by John, alongside a pot of thick red preserves.
Examining a Muggle office wasn’t turning out to be quite as exciting as he had originally anticipated. By the second week, as he sat sorting and stapling endless bits of paper together, he was quite certain of it.
“Glad you didn’t get stopped,” Sherlock said, trying not to stare at John while still cataloging everything about him. He was hungry for every detail.
“Don’t call it firewhiskey for nothing,” Owen chuckled tipping the bottle up. Again, they passed the bottle back and forth in turn, growing quiet.
“I don’t dance seriously anymore,” Sherlock waved one long, beautiful hand through the air, “but it’s still a good way to exercise, blow off some steam.”
“Ah well, shall we faff off, then?” Irene glanced around the room at the sea of glittering frocks and dress uniforms. “I think we’ve been here long enough to make a decent showing.”
“No, it isn’t okay.” John licked his lips. “Sherlock, I’m not ashamed of us. I wouldn’t want to hide us if we ever . . . once we were back in London.”
Sherlock's lips twitched in amusement, “If we must.” He said, feigning nonchalance, but he seemed just as eager as John when they scrambled down the cliff face to the sandy beach below.
He paused, head thrown back, arms straining toward the ceiling, almost in entreaty, almost in prayer. His moves were so classic, so elegant, he was nearly feminine in appearance, yet by the hard sinews and muscles covering the angular body, it was very, very evident that he was all male.
“Here, lean back just a bit,” John said, as he used a plastic cup to scoop up water to rinse out the shampoo. Sherlock kept his eyes closed to better focus on the sensations of warm water, and John’s gentle touch coursing over him.
John laughed  breathlessly, turning his face toward the hurried kisses that Sherlock pressed over his unbroken skin until Sherlock reached his lips.
John smelled amazing, sweetly warm, and salty, sleepy like Saturday morning with nowhere to go. Sherlock groaned, burying his face against the damp strands of hair plastered to John’s nape, inhaling deeply. John roused as he nuzzled at him, kissing and licking over John’s neck in an instinctual need to groom and soothe.
Sherlock was kneeling in the garden, half lost in the tall plants. He wore a straw hat with a brim squashed over his curls, and clothes that had once been probably quite smart, but now worn with age, looked good enough for yard work. A bee buzzed lazily over Sherlock to land on his shoulder for a moment before flying away. John smiled. Even in that ridiculous hat, he was gorgeous. Sherlock looked up as John’s shadow fell over him.
“I’d rather recruit you.” Sherlock dropped his gaze to his hands. “John, I could use a partner. I know it wouldn’t be the same as working in Afghanistan, but I do engage in some risky behaviour in my line of work. I could use back-up.”
“Ok. It’s just I thought you weren’t into that sort of thing for yourself . . .” John trailed off, waving a hand about. “Penis stuff.”
“True, but the same could be said of most people.” Sherlock paused as he chewed, obviously mulling something over. “John, you realize I hold you high above the rest of the population.”
“I hope so.” John blew out a breath, and looked up at the tent walls rippling softly around them from the breeze outside.
They tiptoed carefully up the stairs, making John feel like he was in sixth form again, and trying not to wake up his parents when he slunk in late.
“A book code. The first number designates the page and the second number is the specific word chosen. It’s ingenious. Unless you know the book being used, it’s almost impossible to crack.”
“Well, I’m off. Many more people to bless.” Lupanza bent over to retrieve her basket. “Happy Harvest!”
“Yeah, good.” John flexed his limbs, finding himself well caught. Rather than struggle, he relaxed into the feeling.
“Please, sir,” the Little Hobbit’s teeth were chattering so hard he could barely speak. “I meant no harm,” he lied. “The words over the door were written in Hobbitish. It wasn’t hard to read them."
“No, God, no.” John whipped his head around to look at Sherlock. His forehead was creased into a knot “No, I’m chuffed you asked me to move in. I’d like nothing better.”
John’s mum moved to open it, admitting none other than Mycroft into the house. Sherlock had expected some lackey sent to fetch him, and the sight of his brother stood in a Bajoran home was so incongruent, it took Sherlock a moment to process. He blinked stupidly as Mycroft looked around the mismatched sitting room with a sneer. Sherlock felt his spine stiffen, how dare Mycroft judge. . .
John navigated carefully down busy streets until the businesses thinned to residential houses, and those dropped away to fields. As the road cleared out, John put his foot down on the accelerator and took off. It wasn’t the Astin Martin, but John felt a certain thrill run up his spine with the knowledge that he was driving
“You should be past the half way mark by now,” the teacher chimed from the front. “One more hour left to go on your exams.”
The next two messages were ads for a dating service and a home remodeling company respectively. Sherlock ordered the computer to erase all messages before switching to the broadcast feed. It was far too early to hear anything about the retreat center, but he couldn’t stop himself from cycling through the channels, looking for news reports all the same. He eventually chose a show on farm life to pass the time, his eyelids growing heavy as the narrator droned on about likely cattle diseases.
“We don’t need luck.” Gant Izar sounded almost hurt. “There’s no reason the shield shouldn’t perform as expected. We’ve been working on this solid for three days . . . run all the necessary tests . . .”
It was then Sherlock realized with a start that he and John had been sliding in and out of Bajoran and Cardassian, mixing and matching the two languages together. He hadn’t even been aware of it. It was something that used to happen all the time between them, their brains naturally selecting the word that best seemed to fit.
John walked his mates down to the outer doors, and after promising Teddy AGAIN that yes, he would practice his flying over the summer, waved good-bye.  He watched them for a moment as they laughed and shoved at each other on their way to the carriages to the train station. He felt a small pang at not joining them, but a wide grin stole over his face as a joy bubbled up to replace it. He had a certain Ravenclaw to find, and he lost no more time moping about to start. He headed down to the Potions dungeon first to see if Sherlock was done cleaning up his space. John was quite disappointed when he got there to find the room empty save for Professor Leech shuffling through some papers at his desk.
After their early lunch, they walked the short way to the workshop. It was strange to see the place shut down and quiet for the holidays. It was usually such an ant hill of activity. John admired the window displays, and the life-sized pair of nutcracker dolls Herr Moser had left guarding the front door.  Sherlock gave them the password
Loud noises, and voices raised somewhere behind them, convinced Sherlock that haste was the most important concern of the moment.  “Come on.” He urged John and his mother to follow him through the service gate into the alleyway beyond. “Should we lock it?” Sherlock glanced back.
“Aw, Teddy. Leave off.” Owen grumbled, folding the letter away to slide into a book. “I’m sorry Eileen got a bit nuts on the perfume. It’s not that bad.”
John glanced over, irritated, to see one of the bridesmaids walking along, hand in hand with one of the groomsmen. They seemed quite delighted with each other, talking animatedly as they strolled along.
John sighed and opened the file the nurse had left on his desk. It looked to be a new patient. Except for a few notes listing the patient as a sixteen-year old girl, and her mother’s concerns that she wasn’t doing well, there was nothing to review.
John enters without hesitation, his heart beating quickly in his chest at the knowledge that Sherlock is nearby. He’s surrounded by darkness as soon as he steps through the doorway, but he walks on nonetheless. He’s in a long hallway lined with sconces, each one holding a single lit candle. They cast eerie shadows along the walls, but John knows there’s nothing lurking in the shadows that could be any worse than the very beings traveling alongside him. He walks along Moriarty’s blood-red carpet, unsure of his destination, but knowing he’s doing the right thing.
Sherlock turns to him and rolls his eyes. “Obvious,” he says, but won’t say anything more. John laughs and sits at the table, watching Sherlock with a small smile and amusement in his eyes. Sherlock is standing near the coffeepot, waiting for it to finish dripping, but he narrows his eyes at John’s hand, where just the tiniest bit of black fabric peeks out.
John frowns, his brow furrowing. He swallows the food in his mouth and stares at Sherlock, sure he heard that wrong. “Sorry – what?”
He leans back on his heels and watches as Sherlock suddenly takes a sharp, deep inhalation.  It’s shocking to see his inert body suddenly move; his eyes fly open and his spine arches off the bench and his arms flop to the side, and he holds himself taut for a moment before he lies flat again.  He blinks rapidly and his forehead screws up in thought and then he turns his head to the side, lifting one hand to rub at his head.
, and Sherlock needs to end this right now. He’s already lost John once, and he doesn’t think he can bear to lose him again, but in the current state of things, he knows he can’t keep him – not when he’s
John smiles at the little pipe fox curled around his wrist. A month ago, he’d been alone, scared every time he left his house, with nothing and no one to live for. Now he has this strange group of ragtag friends that’s beginning to feel like a family; Mrs. Hudson, Billy, and now Redbeard. And on top of that, he has
“Surely you can’t mistake me for an idiot,” the man says with a raised eyebrow. “These aren’t yours. But what a surprise you are, so willing to tell your name to a complete stranger.”
“I’m not leaving you, you arse!” John says, determination fierce in his voice. “I’m not leaving here without you!”
“You – could you have gotten us out of there at any time?” John asks, pointing his finger at Sherlock in accusation.
“Come up here?” John asks. His voice is gentle. Sherlock shifts, grimacing at the stickiness between them. He barely has the energy to shift the few centimeters it takes to be at John’s eye level. He rests his head on the pillow beside John, and John shifts, curling onto his side. They’re facing each other now, like they were in the beginning, and John tucks his knee between Sherlock’s once more. He strokes Sherlock’s face again, looks into his eyes, and Sherlock can’t look away even though John’s face is startlingly blurry.
“Honestly,” Sherlock says, looking away from John to glare at Mrs. Hudson. “If you’re just going to provide useless commentary, you can go downstairs.”
“Ready, John?” Sherlock asks, and John turns to look at him, sure his face is showing much more than he wants it to, but Sherlock just smiles at him again, surprisingly patient. Sherlock squeezes his hand, lets his thumb brush over John’s skin, and John can do nothing but stare. Sherlock squeezes his hand once more and then untangles their fingers, but his hand doesn’t leave the handle. He adjusts his grip instead, his hand next to John’s again rather than wrapped around it, and John’s surprised to miss the feeling of Sherlock’s fingers intertwined with his own.
“Honestly,” Sherlock says once they’re outside. “The nerve of that woman, calling herself a psychic.”
When they get inside, needlessly hushing one another on the stairs to avoid bothering Mrs. Hudson, giggling as John fumbles with his key and Sherlock just opens the door with a wave of his hand and accidentally makes it bang against the wall, John goes right to the kitchen and gets two beers out of the fridge. Sherlock sits in his chair, and John hobbles over to sit across from him.
He’s saved a response when Mary starts to speak. “I’ve found a nice little area over there,” she says, gesturing behind her. “It’s not too crowded, and it’s in the shade. Shall we?”
“When we first met, ill-intentioned spirits were taking advantage of your strong connection to the spirit world to prey on you,” he says. “The reason the spirits have been currently bothering you less is not because they have decreased in number, but because you’ve learned the value of your life, and so they no longer see you as easy prey. In turn, they bother you less, and the connection you have to other realms is less taxed, opening it up to more productive uses, such as Lestrade’s visits.”
Sherlock doesn’t understand. Something is changing, but he can’t bear to let himself hope. He clears his throat. “John, I –”
Her chin wobbles, but she steels herself for a moment, keeping the sob from escaping.  She shakes her head.  “I know where it is, but that’s not where I’m going,” she says.  “I don’t want to go alone.”
“John, this nectar is extremely delicious, and you can only get it once a year,” Sherlock says, as if what he’s saying is perfectly reasonable.
Sherlock feels his cheeks heat, feels an incandescent smile bloom on his face. “Are you hungry? I know a good Chinese place that’s sure to be open.”
“Right,” John says. “You’re sure.” He holds his wrist up to look at the pipe fox, and Redbeard lifts his head to look up at John. Redbeard squeaks, then settles back down on John’s wrist, pressing another little peck of a kiss into the pale skin on the underside of John’s wrist.
“Er, right, okay,” John says, taking the clipboard from her. He fills in his name, date of birth, and hometown, ignoring Sherlock, who is sitting stonily beside him, back ramrod straight, eyes trained on the fortuneteller. When John hands the clipboard back to the woman, Sherlock turns to the tote bag, taking out the skull. He places it on the couch beside him and then stares at the woman once more.
“Timing, Billy,” Mrs. Hudson chides, and John thinks this is all a bit much to handle and his mouth is twisting a bit.
“Alright, Love, I know,” John says, shifting her a bit and then holding the bottle out for her. She eagerly latches on and her cries turn to the sound of satisfied drinking, and Sherlock smiles and shifts closer to John. He throws an arm over John’s waist and burrows his face into John’s hip, content. He drifts into sleep a little bit until he feels John’s fingers carding through his hair, and he realizes Iris has finished her morning meal. He blinks up at John, who’s smiling at him fondly, and then he shifts a bit, enough that he’s slouched against the headboard.
John gives Sherlock’s wrist a squeeze and lets go. “Why don’t you go home?” he says. “I’ll be fine. I’ll meet you there when they let me out.”
John feels a burning behind his eyes. He stubbornly takes a deep breath, willing it to recede. “But I – I don’t want - ”
Sherlock is frozen, his eyes on John’s hand until John removes it. “I was – I’m clean now,” he says. For some reason, he
It’s dark in the forest, and as his eyes slowly adjust, he can see that tall trees surround him and Redbeard, none of which are in bloom, but which have enough empty branches to shroud them from the sunlight with a thick web of dead limbs overhead. There are so many trees that it’s difficult to make a straight path, but John does his best, aided by Redbeard, who seems to know instinctively which way to go. John’s head begins to throb as the cold intensifies, and he can see his breath blooming white in front of his face.
Sherlock smiles, but it’s different than his smile from before; softer somehow, absent in the crinkles of his eyes. “Wouldn’t that be interesting,” he murmurs, and Redbeard squeaks in agreement.
“I’m a spiritual being; I won’t die of natural causes. I won’t be grey and old. Therefore, neither will you. You wished to stay with me until something impossible happens. We have eternity, quite literally, thanks to your wish.”
John kisses him again, soft and sweet, and Sherlock feels desperation unfurl deep inside of him. He makes a
. John feels something for him.   His heart lodges somewhere in his throat. “John,” he says. Desire is pooling in his stomach, and his heart is beating faster. He’s grateful when John tugs him down for a kiss, parting his lips, pressing their tongues together.
It’s hitting him now - Sherlock faking his death, Sherlock coming back, Sherlock making him breakfast,
Thanks to Redbeard’s familiar presence, he feels marginally calmer when Mycroft returns, a cup of tea in his hand. John scrubs his hand over his eyes and takes the tea from Mycroft with a nod of thanks, and Mycroft sits opposite him, in Sherlock’s chair. It makes something ache in John’s chest, but he pushes it away.
“See you later, John,” he calls, disappearing into his room. John shakes his head at the lack of surprise this unusual behavior strikes in him and follows after. He goes inside and lingers near the doorway, watching as Sherlock pulls open his closet door. “I’ll be in touch,” Sherlock adds.
Silently, he slides out of bed, grateful for the light of the moon streaming in his window that helps him see enough to find his dressing gown. He ties it tight around his waist and silently creeps down the hallway; he mastered the art of sneaking about the house at night long ago.
–” John says, distantly aware that his face is wet and his voice is breaking. His fingers are so close to Sherlock’s face that he can almost feel the skin underneath his fingertips, but he has one last glimpse of Sherlock, looking at him with a sad, fond smile, his eyes red and wet, before Sherlock disappears in a whirl of smoke, and John is left alone, his fingers grasping nothing but air.
“Morning,” Sherlock replies, his voice gruff with sleep. John is still in his pyjamas, too, and his hair is rumpled. Sherlock has an absurd urge to smooth it down, and so he turns to make tea instead – John will surely want some, after all – but finds the kettle already on its way to boiling. He blinks at it, then turns back to the table to find John watching him in amusement.
“Cheers,” John says, holding up his glass to Sherlock. Sherlock holds his own out and their glasses clink, and they both take a long sip.
The man hangs up, and John is overwhelmed by the smoke coming from the man’s pinky. He covers his nose and mouth with his hand, and watches as the man dials another number before continuing down the street. John follows discreetly.
Still, the fingers of his other hand are clumsy where they struggle to glide across the strings like they once did. When he tries to play with vibrato, something he never used to have to think about, it sounds shrill and artificial, resting on top of the sound rather than being an essential part of its core. The sound is still unfocused, though it’s clearer than it was the day before, but he manages to play in third position without wincing at the shallowness of his sound.
“John, the spirit you met today was quite rare,” Sherlock says after a moment of eating in silence. “Not one you’d meet just any day.”
“So, have you had many clients lately?” Mary asks Sherlock after a lull in conversation. She turns to face him with a warm smile, her hands cupped around her mug of chai tea.
John looks towards the web and sees that Sherlock is indeed more entrenched by the web than he was a moment ago. Panic rises within him.
“Just different?” Mary repeats, amused, her brow arched. John spares her a tight smile and a shrug in response as they reach the top of the stairs. They head to the file room, a large room lined with tall bookcases filled with folders, tabs sticking out to notate where each letter of the alphabet begins.
“Hogwarts would have been hard for you, then,” John says, understanding in his voice. “All the magic everywhere.”
“How will you go back?” the woman asks.  She tucks a lock of hair behind her ear, watching him in concern.
John follows behind her in agitation, wondering how he’s expected to be calm in a situation like this, and how she can be so calm herself.  When they enter Sherlock’s room, John is overcome by how much of Sherlock’s personality is in here, and he feels desperation clawing at his skin, making it hard to breathe.
He feels terrified at the loss of connection because it means facing what’s just happened, but when he hesitantly opens his eyes, feeling naked in the face of this fear, he sees
“You broke the spell the next day. You must have, anyway, because I changed back into a boy, and you were the only one who could have done it. You must have loved me, even though I was a nutcracker. When you freed me, I woke up, but I was in someone’s bedroom and there was no sign of you.”
“I’m sorry,” John says. He finds that he means it very sincerely, and wishes he had something more substantial to say, but he’s never been particularly good at talking about things like this.
in the center. With a jolt deep in his stomach, he realizes that it’s Sherlock. He rushes ahead, his footsteps loud in the tunnel, but he doesn’t care; he needs to get to Sherlock
“That’s enough, Mycroft,” Mummy says, coming behind them and putting her hand consolingly on Sherlock’s shoulder, tugging him close so his back is pressed up against her front. He watches Uncle Augustus with wide eyes, who is tutting over the nutcracker and examining it from every which angle.
“It seems like you want to chaperone John and I every time we see each other, and I understand that, I really do. I even appreciate it, even if I wish it weren’t necessary.”
“You said you spent a lot of time there,” John says. “Must be important if you made a window just to look at it.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Not in the same way as someone who’s dedicated solely to the practice. Besides, Mary mentioned star charts yesterday, didn’t she? You’d have something new to talk to her about.”
There’s a food cart up ahead, though it’s not by any means a busy street, so it’s a strange location for one.  It’s a small, curtained off cart with a sign outside, illuminated by a string of light bulbs, that reads ‘Angelo’s.’  If it didn’t smell so delicious, John would turn around, given the strange location, but the smell is beyond enticing, so he takes a few steps forward, hesitating outside the curtain.  He’s just reaching out to part the red cloth when he hears a rustling coming from beside him, and so he turns to look, and then freezes, eyes open wide and hand halfway to the cloth.
“No, Mummy, it really happened!” he says frantically, the clues adding up and telling him what he knows is true.
His hands are shaking and he stands rooted to the spot, wondering if this is finally his psychotic break.
The rest of the day passes uneventfully. John wants to ask Sherlock about Mrs. Hudson, but Sherlock has been doing some sort of experiment in the living room, mixing strange liquids together while Billy watches and makes commentary John doesn’t understand.
Later that night, when John’s in bed, Sherlock goes to his hidden room and checks on his plants. They’re blooming beautifully, and the ground beneath his feet is soft and lush with thick green grass, so he adds some more lights, and with a strange but not unpleasant feeling in his heart, he makes some small butterflies and birds out of the lights to fly amongst the flowers. He adds a small pond in the corner, with a rocky wall above it. Carefully, he forms a waterfall. He smiles.
“Does that feel good, love? I want you to feel good,” John says. His voice is gentle, warm, familiar, and Sherlock curls closer, nuzzles John’s knee, doesn’t think he can speak. John’s fingers smooth up and down the back of his head again, and Sherlock thinks he would do anything for John in this moment,
He blinks in shock when he finds himself back at home, and he stares around himself for a moment as his brain catches up to his body. If it weren’t for the lantern Sherlock pulls out of his grasp and takes into the kitchen, he’d be sure he’d never left 221B in the first place. The lantern is with them, though, so he knows they’ve really gone and come back, even if he doesn’t really understand it. Now that they’re home and the magical atmosphere has been broken, he realizes that surely, Sherlock did something to get them home. Something occurs to him and he charges into the kitchen, his awareness and adrenaline snapping back full force.
Sherlock’s doesn’t know what to do; this is not how this is supposed to go.   They’re supposed to snipe at each other then ignore it and go back to usual tomorrow, not apologize or
Sherlock feels split open and he loves it.  He shifts his legs until John’s as deep as he can go, then rocks his hips and delights in the moan John lets bleed into their kiss.
John nods, determination clear in the tense set of his shoulders and grim line of his jaw. “Yes,” he says, “and I
Sherlock sluggishly blinks his eyes when he hears the old grandfather clock in the ballroom striking loudly. He sits up, rubbing his eyes, and sees that it’s midnight, but just as he looks away from the clock, he notices that the Christmas tree is getting very big – or maybe he is getting very small?
Sherlock realizes his face must be showing a lot more than usual because John pauses, setting the towel aside and taking Sherlock’s face in his hands.
He lets go of the sink and takes a piece of bread out of the bag on the counter. He shoves half of it in his mouth, chewing it too fast and doing his best to swallow it quickly; he knows he needs a few calories in his body before he leaves. He finishes it and takes another, and he barely tastes it as he chews, unable to focus on the simple act of eating with so much racing through his mind.
John lets out an involuntary groan, a breathy helpless sort of sound, worn with sleep but heartfelt just the same, and he tightens his fingers in Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock’s eyes widen and he looks down at the nutcracker. Sticking out of the nutcracker’s pocket is a little corner of something dark blue, a raised piece of wood that hadn’t been there the day before. Around Sherlock’s waist, his dressing gown is missing its belt.
“Help me up?” John asks, so Sherlock does, reaching down to help him up, steadying him when he stands, noticing how warm and solid John is underneath his hands. He turns and they go up the stairs together, all the way up to their own flat.
The last thing he registers is the sound of her frantically shouting his name before the world goes dark.
rather than how many wrinkles she has on each finger or the way her little eyelids crease or the ratio of iris to white in her big round eyes; he’ll have time for that later.
When they reached the room the five stopped, Mycroft looked at his brother softly, Sherlock looked like he was holding in a sob, and the others stared at the injured man lying in the hospital bed.
“Please, John is fine, otherwise I feel like I’m at work.”  I say lightly.  My nerves are allayed almost immediately by her gentle nature and bright smile.
“I thought you’d gone out again, until I heard the pipes in the bathroom.  I came up at breakfast, even poked my head into your room and couldn’t see any sign of you.”
When I cannot procrastinate any longer, I slip the knife in between the top fold and the shoulder of the envelope and slip the sharp blade along its width.
John smiles at the mess we have made of each other and reaches into the nappy bag to retrieve the wipes.  Rosie squirms to get away from both of us, not wanting her face or hands washed.
This chapter might make a little more sense if you have read Home, however you are Sherlockians, you are the clever people, I am confident you will be fine either way.
I wonder why John is here, not that I mind; it is always nice to have him around for a visit.  Rosie must still be at home with one of John’s team of babysitters, it is well and truly too quiet, and it is well past her bedtime.  Shame really, I could have done with some time playing with her or reading her a book.
“Yes, it’s lovely, isn’t it?” John shoved his hands into his pockets, rocking nervously back on his heels.
Kristin, the only female Omega in the office, who covered the social media, and correspondence, merely looked up and nodded. She was a rare creature, an Omega working even after bonding. Sadly her Alpha had taken ill, and she’d gone back to a previous position to make ends meet. She had two young children, and looked simply exhausted.
The day was bright outside, and Sherlock let the light cool breeze blow any lingering cobwebs from his mind as he strolled. This part of the city had a mix of Cardassian and Bajorans going about their business. Though the latter moved around with prominent ID tags clipped to their fronts, Sherlock could almost pretend things were as they’d been when he was a child. He had just decided to stop in at a café that served decent Bajoran food when a raised voice caught his attention. A pretty blonde Bajoran woman clutching a basket stood flanked by two Cardassian soliders, each of them easily twice her size.
“God, Sherlock, this week’s been awful,” John huffed, letting Sherlock’s sleepy warmth seep into him. “I missed you.”
Everyone it seemed was thirsty, and they shared the meager supplies, passing them around until they were gone. Sherlock’s fingers itched to pull John back into his arms, but he couldn’t with John’s mother right there. He laced his hands together tightly in his lap instead to stop them from going where they shouldn’t. They played a word game that Mrs. Watson suggested to pass the time. Sherlock had to smile. He remembered when she’d first taught him the game to help him learn Bajoran, and to settle them for dinner after he and John had been running in the garden all afternoon. They played, even laughing, until a flash of headlights, and a squeal of brakes alerted them to a vehicle arriving outside. They fell silent, waiting.
Once they had cleared the facility of their things, John suggested a walk around the beach. They found the walkable portion only extended half way around the island before being cut off by sheer cliff face. It left them ample space for exploring, shoes off, and trousers rolled up, splashing in the waves, poking in some tidal pools, and collecting driftwood left by the tide. Sherlock couldn’t remember a more enjoyable afternoon spent seaside.
John moved to the kitchen, uncovering a large pot to discover a very good-smelling vegetable soup bubbling away. He found a bowl, served himself and carried it to the table. After having Victor around, the room seemed ridiculously quiet. Thankfully Sherlock joined him a few minutes later, getting his own bowl. John complimented him on how good the soup was, and they ate in silence for several minutes.
It felt strange to speak the harsh clatter of Cardassian after so many months of living amongst Bajorans. Sherlock rocked back on his heels, glancing casually over at his two charges. The boys stood quietly to the side, looking down, hands clasped meekly before them.
The address took them to a sad-looking older building of flats on a quiet street.  Sherlock caught the outer door as a couple exited and held it open for John to follow. They quickly found the number to the flat they were looking for. Sherlock rapped briskly in the center of the door with his knuckles.
Sherlock came with a cry, letting John pump the last quakes of pleasure from him until he became too sensitive. When he could see straight, Sherlock pushed John's hand away from his own, still-hard erection and moved to suck the tip into his mouth. He wrapped his hand around the base he couldn’t reach, sliding it up to reach his taut lips. It was bliss to feel John fall apart because of him.
“Hello,” the man said mildly, looking over his reading glasses. He was a compact sort of fellow with short, sandy hair, someone who had lived a bit, leaving a softness to his face that creased as he smiled at Sherlock.
Mycroft cleared his throat again. “She did of course ask me to convey her regrets, and best regards for your graduation.”
Sherlock nearly leapt from the shed, John close behind. They crossed the field quickly, moving toward the wall, which if things were as they appeared, was no longer charged. The light was slipping as they reached the wall. John squinted in the gloom at a place where the electric wires were set some distance from the stone wall beyond. Sherlock held out a hand to stop him as John made to touch the wires.
“You taste even better.” John ran the flat of his tongue over the curve of Sherlock’s belly, laving over and over, covering Sherlock with even more of his scent with his saliva.
He felt a tiny bit bereft as he watched the taxi pull away. A stiff breeze had picked up, and John zipped his jacket higher. Throwing his shoulders back, he stumped his way to the glossy black door with the right number, and pressed the doorbell. After an agonizing wait, the door finally opened, and none other than handsome Victor popped his head out.
“Good for you. Oh, we will miss you here, John.” Bianca poured more wine in their glasses before raising hers for a toast. “To new beginnings, and old friends.”
Soon they lost themselves completely in artfully arranging the tiny figures around the room. “Here’s the mountains,” Sherlock said rucking up the duvet to pose the giants across the bed.  John used stacks of books to create a fortress on the floor.
Sherlock said nothing, merely wiping his mouth off on the back of his hand. Victor tossed him the bag, and he caught it neatly from its arc through the air, quickly secreting it away in an inner pocket lest Victor change his mind again, and demand other more degrading acts to complete their transaction.
“Oh, I’m so sorry.” Mrs. Kent cocked her head to the side. “I just assumed you were gay, dear. The pretty ones always are.”
“Nice to meet you,” the woman nodded cautiously, her face not quite sure what expression to settle on.
In the lobby, John stopped to speak to the security guard, introducing Sherlock as his new mate, and letting him know he’d be a new resident in the building. When Sherlock had described his flat as a little hole in the wall on Montague street, they’d agreed John’s place was the better residence to keep.
John risked another glance down. He almost couldn’t believe it, the great Sherlock Holmes on his knees servicing him. John could have wept if the man in question hadn't been turning him inside out with that clever tongue and those take-me-downtown-and-keep-going lips.
John grabbed his things for the bathroom and stomped off to take a shower. Sherlock moved to the loo shortly after his return. John was in bed curled on his side, covers over his head when Sherlock reappeared. He tried not to listen to his roommate’s every sound as he moved about the room. Eventually the lights turned out and the mattress shifted as Sherlock crawled onto his side of the bed. John tried very had to pretend he was already asleep.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. He watched Molly polishing off the sweet, thoughts roiling through his mind before he was able to focus them enough to ask a question.
“It’s a chameleon fish,” Sherlock explained. “They have a way to change colour with their surroundings. We’ve been working on a way to use the chemicals in their skin to brew a potion that will work on humans.”
Sherlock was at the table with his laptop, the kettle coming to a boil when John entered the kitchen.
On their walk home, Sherlock reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette on auto pilot, lighting it with a muttered spell. He took a drag, exhaling the smoke with a sigh. It was only when he glanced over at John that he remembered himself, and froze.
John continued to rummage inside the storage space, making an inventory. “Oh, look there’s a tent here, a lantern, firewood, sleeping bags.” He turned clutching a sealed bag labeled as marshmallows. “I believe we’re meant to have a campout.” He grinned.
“Alright.”  Sherlock’s voice was tentative, so different from his daytime tone. “Has that happened often  . . .”
With a grin, Sherlock led John back to the room with his waiting four poster bed. It was just as poncy as John remembered, but the bed was large and soft, and he happily kicked his shoes off, and rolled to the center of it, holding his arms out in welcome.  Sherlock climbed into them, sinking down onto John with a sigh. John rubbed his cheek against the top of Sherlock’s head.
Soft, warm heat radiated over John, the delicious friction sending waves of longing to pool low and heavy in his belly. He kept trying to bring everything closer, deeper . . . more. Someone was making positively decadent noises at the back of their throat, and just when John thought he might have to collapse to the floor, they parted for air. Sherlock looked fabulously gobsmacked, making John want to kiss the beautiful man all over again.
“You can drop it, Sherlock. We don’t have time for your childish theatrics.” Sherlock’s father paced over the carpet of the flat they’d been assigned at the military base.  “You've been coddled too long. That stops now.”
“No, thanks, I’ll just wait for Sherlock to get back.” John retreated to the bedroom. He made the bed and settled on top of the covers to read a book he pulled off Sherlock’s shelf.  When John’s stomach rumbled loudly, he abandoned the book, deciding to go out.
Sherlock’s new job looked to be simple enough, maintaining internet security for the Cardassian web in Dahkur province. He worked with ten others, had his own room with a door, and a superior who rarely stopped by in person. It would quickly be dull as dust if not for his side projects. Finding supplies that could be funneled to the Resistance with no trails left on the web, and no coworkers alerted was a worthy enough challenge. Sherlock found that he enjoyed the subterfuge more than he thought he would.
“God, Bianca, no. How could I ever forget you?” John freed his arm to sling it around the woman’s shoulders, giving her a squeeze.
It took but a moment more when something horrible happened. John seemed to jolt to an awareness as if he had been sleepwalking. His beautiful, contented expression crumpled like a bit of paper in the rain, and he pushed himself away from Sherlock, sitting up to clutch at his face as he moaned. “NO, no, oh GOD, no!” He looked devastated.
The incongruent orange pillar on the beach was closer to the water with the morning tide, but still easily visible. Sherlock felt as if he could reach out and pluck it up in one hand, but of course it was at least a kilometer away.
“The daughter and wife of a Glinn can hardly be said to be common. Irene told me you were knee-deep in some planning committee for a spring soiree with a flock of other officers’ wives?”
“Sherlock. Now that you’ve graduated, there’s a small matter that I’d like to take care of.” Mycroft reached into a pocket inside his robe, and extracted a small silver-wrapped box that he set in the middle of the table.
“Well, fine, get it. Hurry! He isn’t breathing well.” The first voice complained. “Come on John. Wake UP!” The sound of a hand striking flesh, twice, three times reached John as if coming through layers of cotton. His head shifted as someone slapped his cheeks, but it might have been on the person next to him, for all that he could feel it.
Thanks to all who have stuck by me with this story, encouraging me to keep chugging on. Cheers, and chilled glasses of sangria all around! We've only one more chapter to go after this, lovelies!
“Maybe I don’t want to be sensible.” She turned wild eyes his way. “John, what if I’m letting the best years of my life pass me by? I’m in the labs almost every night.”
Although Sherlock protested that it wasn’t necessary, John insisted, heading downstairs to fetch a plastic bag he filled with ice cubes and wrapped in a dishtowel. Sherlock was back under the duvet reading his phone when John returned. The cool light from his screen threw his features into sharp relief, the mark on his cheek looking even uglier.  John swallowed sharply.
Harry stopped John as Sherlock moved past them, carrying the last box outside. “So, you’ll call? Maybe we can get together for dinner next week?” Harry had changed into daywear and brushed her hair back into a ponytail.
“So you’ve finally decided to drag in at noon . .  .” Harry appeared at the top of the stairs in her dressing gown and pokemon pyjamas. Her eyes widened when they landed on Sherlock. “Oh, hello.”
“Really? Where’s Victoire got off to? I never see her outside Quidditch anymore,” John said looking about the table, realizing now that he said it how true it was.
“No worries.” John grinned at Lestrade, then turned to flash a private smile at Sherlock, a smile that said
Night had fallen proper when they finally stumbled out of bed for a shower. Sherlock did a fancy bit of magic and expanded the shower giving it extra nozzles so they stood in a waterfall of spray together, soaping each other’s backs and hair with ease.
She pulled the steering bar, wrenching the vehicle into a clear 180 degree turn to shoot back the way they’d come. Furel screamed, the large man making a surprisingly high-pitched sound, as they passed right below the Cardassians’ craft. While the larger ship took time to change course, Lupie flew low into a small fissure between jagged rock cliffs, the walls so close they nearly scraped against them.
Sherlock wasn’t sure there was enough room in his heart to contain the feeling that rose over him. “John,” he choked. “I .  .  . too.”
John felt as though he needn’t have bothered trying to dress up. Half of the people in the restaurant were wearing jeans and track suits when he located Sherlock at a small table with a cup of tea at his elbow.  He looked beautifully elegant scrolling through his phone, long legs crossed at the ankle as he leaned back in his seat. He was bathed in light spilling down from the large skylight over head, the sunbeams picking out the glints of red hiding in his dark curls. God, he looked like the subject of a Renaissance painting  . . . with an i-phone.
“Brilliant!” Victoire called flashing John a bright smile. John couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this happy.
“Please what, my wee laddie?” John’s fingers danced up the inside of his legs, teasing, tormenting, stroking everywhere but Sherlock’s obviously straining cock about to hit him in the eye as it bobbed.
“This way,” the lead man grunted and directed them through some pattern of his own knowing through the twisting hallways, each barely lit well enough to see. They continued without speaking, only the sounds of their footfalls, and labored breaths keeping them company. John fell in behind Sherlock and reached out to pat at Sherlock more than once as they made along. Sherlock wondered if he were aware he was doing it. It seemed to a gesture designed to reassure John as much as offer comfort to Sherlock, though he was grateful for it.
John reached the imposing building that housed New Scotland Yard without mishap. He pushed his way nervously past the front door into the chaos, and asked at the front desk to speak to D.I. Lestrade about a matter of some urgency. He used his Captain John Watson voice to sound firm, and thankfully, without having to reveal how ridiculous his reason actually was, John was led inside.
“Alright, listen up you lot!” John addessed the small crowd, falling into his usual spiel. There were rules for everyone at the farm. No stealing, no fighting, enforced curfew, and only sex with people of age who said yes. There was a duty roster and an expected amount of volunteer time each week. For those who wanted to work on missions for the Resistance, there was a list for that too. No one was allowed off the property without permission, but there were regular trips down to the river, and all the food, medicine, and clothing people needed. Also there was a Cardassian who owned the farm and was working with them. If anyone had a problem with that, they could leave now.
“The electric shocks had left me confused, something like a concussion.  It felt like this.  Like I have the past week.  I couldn’t remember a lot of the things that happened.  I still can’t.  Everything felt vague and strange.  What I do know is that he was there every night and after that first time, I know he raped me every night.  I lost whole days or only remember some moments from others, but I know how humiliating it was; how much it hurt.  Do you know what it is like for me to not remember things?”  He asks as his voice starts to really hitch now, emotion finally overcoming him.  I know he doesn’t want an answer though, so I stay silent and still.
He shrugs, and his hands move again.  One sliding perfectly along my cock, the other running up my side and then thumbing at a nipple.
He goes to get up, but I motion at him to stay there and I sit cross legged at his feet.  Rosie makes an escape as soon as her feet hit the ground.  She is so fast now that the baby gate at the stairs is a necessity.
Sherlock reads through the pages quietly as he eats.  When he closes the last page, he looks up at me and says, “Thank you, John.”
He is sleeping, the sedation from his last outburst forcing him to rest, but it is obvious that he is uncomfortable.  His brow is furrowed and from time to time he makes a small noise that could only be described as a whimper.
“I used to freak out more than that when I had a shower or brushed my teeth.  I didn’t stop doing those things.  They got better.”
My relief is palpable.  I reply with a time frame and a wilted sigh.  It is as if the stress of wondering was all that was keeping me inflated.
I tuck Rosie under my arm in the way that makes her giggle so much.  She puts her arms out like she is flying and kicks her legs as I carry her into the kitchen.  It’s a good thing she is so entertained by this method of transport because my ruined shoulder won’t allow me to carry her two handed.
“And here.”  I direct his touch to the one on the inside my left bicep, “and here” I roll my right arm away so he can see the other one, “and both palms”  I turn my hands up for him to see.  “And here,” I point at the dimple on my solar plexus.  As his hand moves across my chest he brushes my nipple, an accident or an advance, I am unsure, but my breath hitches and he must feel it.  His eyes snap up to mine, questioning, concerned.  I shake my head minutely.  He gives a tiny nod of unquestioning acceptance.  I let out a relieved breath and his eyes move back to my chest.  His shaking fingers continue their scientific exploration of the craters in my skin.
There are two pages both folded thrice.  When I open them, the photo falls face down in my lap.  The deer photo.  It must be.  I pick it up and turn it over.  I nearly drop it.  It is the photo I was expecting, except it has been altered, the face of the boy had been covered over with a newspaper photograph of my face.
I know he wants more, I’d be a fool not to, but I trust him to respect my boundaries, to not push me, and all things considered, I guess that that says a lot.
It has been months since the last attack, he must be getting itchy for another, there hasn’t been a spell this long since he started.
“No, you slept well.  You needed it.  Go back to sleep if you can.  I’ll be back here around six.  I was thinking of grabbing a curry.”
The process is arduous though, I don’t understand why I am so tired.  I try to sleep again and now the nurse only wakes me up every hour.  When she notices that I can’t sleep, she offers to clean me up a bit.  I decline her offer even though I know that there is still blood in my hair.  Not just blood either; there are small chunks that I suspect are brain matter.  I remember the panic that I felt when the nurse in Montenegro washed my hair; I don’t think I can do that right now.  I ask her to leave.
“I’m aware of how this sounds.  You must think I am a terrible person.  A terrible parent.  It’s not normally like that.  He is clean now, he isn’t dangerous, he is really a wonderful person.  He’s never done anything to threaten anyone innocent.  It was an isolated incident.”
“Right,” John says, remembering his trip to the fortuneteller.  “Molly.”  He pauses, and then looks at Billy helplessly.  “I don’t have her phone number.”
John blinks, taking in his surroundings in confusion. He looks up at the sky, and the moon is almost directly overhead. “What – it’s like we never left,” he says in awe.
“Of course I have,” Sherlock interrupts. “I’ve just deduced the deterioration of your relationship, haven’t I?” Something is twisting in his chest, something that says his brain is not working with him on this one, and he doesn’t know how to solve it.
, but things are different now, and John’s clearly not in his best emotional state, and Sherlock can’t bear to see John switch to
Sherlock is quiet for a moment, taking a long drink and then setting down his glass. He takes a drag on his pipe and John watches the smoke as it drifts out of Sherlock’s mouth, mixing with the cool night air, before Sherlock picks up his glass once more.   “And now?” Sherlock asks, his tone of voice deceptively casual, but John can see from the way his eyes are focused on the distant streetlights rather than him that he’s not asking this casually at all.
Sherlock nods. He takes a deep breath. The sound of the sirens, something in the air, seems to bring him back to himself. When he opens his eyes, they’re clear, but he stares at John for a moment and John is startled by the intensity. Then Lestrade is there, breaking the moment, asking what the hell is going on, and everything comes back to life.
“When you fell –” Sherlock stops and clears his throat, looking away for a moment. It occurs to John that Sherlock may have been worried about him, and he squeezes his hand in what he hopes is reassurance. “When you fell,” Sherlock repeats, “the bookcase holding all the files fell, too. It landed on top of you. The shelves fell out, and the edges were jagged metal. They cut into your back and sliced it open.”
John blinks and stares at Sherlock for a moment. Sherlock is unsure if he’s overstepped; he’d been sure to end his suggestion in a questioning lilt so that he didn’t appear to think he knows more than John because he knows he doesn’t, not in this area, and he knows he doesn’t have any say in what John does with Iris. He feels nervous for a moment, but then John nods.
John breaks the kiss and carefully lines himself up and he pushes in, going steadily in until he’s all the way.  John groans and Sherlock tilts his head back, squeezing his eyes closed and breathing shallowly, trying to keep himself under control, but it’s so much, and even though it’s only been a few hours since they’ve done this last, it feels like he’s coming home after years away, like everything is slotting into place, like electricity, like fire, like magic, and he squeezes his fingers into John’s back, holding him close, trying to calm himself.
do, and he sighs, looking at John again. His heart is pounding, but John is still staring at him, unwaveringly loyal even after having stomped out of the flat just minutes ago.
Sherlock smiles, eyes crinkling. “I need more data before I can answer that sufficiently,” she says, and then they’re giggling, and Sherlock’s spine curves into a gentle arc and she rests her forehead against John’s for just a moment, cherishing the soft curves of John’s waist beneath her hands, inhaling the scent of her shampoo, nuzzling their noses together, letting her hands smooth up and down John’s lower back, feeling her breath hitch when John’s hand slides under her shirt. John’s hand, warm and strong, strokes up and down Sherlock’s side, higher and higher each time, until her fingers brush the side of Sherlock’s breast, and gently, John kisses her neck, warm and soft, and then her thumb brushes over Sherlock’s nipple, rubbing it to hardness, and Sherlock moans, pulling John closer.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and doesn’t say anything, just shoves the third meringue into his mouth and wonders if she’d notice if he snuck a pie.
Some of them don’t seem convinced, though, and John’s body feels cold, and he’s sweating, gripping Sherlock’s hand with all his strength. The little fox steps closer to them, then suddenly stands taller, takes a deep breath, and shouts, “HE GAVE ME THIS!”
Mary is quiet for a moment, eyes trained on her tea, and then she looks up at him shrewdly. “But John has a need for your shop?” she asks, eyes searching his.
John merely nods because he’s unsure he’s able to speak. Together, they lift the lantern until the hole on top is beneath a large, shining fruit that hangs from the tree right above their heads, heavy with nectar. Once the lantern and fruit come in contact, nectar starts to flow out of the fruit. It’s shimmery and gold, flowing thick like honey.
been fun watching the two of you dance. Did you like how I gave you a few little glimpses of him in the tunnels, just to make it all that much more heartbreaking when you realized the truth of it all? It’s so
“We’re here for John’s payment,” he says. He sounds sulky once more, and John can’t help the way the corner of his mouth twitches.
“No one’s upset with you, Sherlock,” Dad says. He seems to understand the slump in Sherlock’s shoulders, the wideness of his eyes. “We’ve just never seen you do magic like that before. That was brilliant.”
“Mm,” Sherlock says again. It’s all he can manage. He hears John go to the kitchen and rifle through the drawer of takeaway menus, and he feels inexplicably fond of the sound, inexplicably fond of the way John calls to order instead of just going online like everyone else. He pulls the blanket more tightly around his shoulders and gratefully lets the familiar but so dearly missed sounds of John drift over him, pulling him further and further out of his own mind.
John attempts to close the door before the man can follow him in, but the man reaches out and grabs it before John can slam it in his face.  John glares at him, but the man just gives him a smile, so forced and polite that John just snorts and shakes his head; Sherlock’s acquaintances are nothing if not interesting.
Sherlock was grateful when the server moved on, leaving him to deal with his ridiculous drink in peace. He methodically worked his way through the fruit before tackling the drink itself. It was overly sweet, and very strong. He pushed it away after one sip.
It was a terrible thing to admit. Sherlock had sent several terse messages the first few days of his absence, but even those has petered off.
“Miss you.” John mumbled against his lips. God, Sherlock smelled delicious. John wanted to climb inside his clothes to press closer to his skin. Stopping himself from working his robe open, he plunged his fingers into the taller boy’s dark curls instead, and dived back in for another drugging kiss.
“Not everyone is as advanced as we might like, though. Older people cling to prejudices.” Sherlock waved a hand around. “The senior doctor at your office . . .”
“Or spill the beans on OUR plans to them.” Teddy grumbled, his eyes morphing a disturbing silver color as he glared across the room.
“No, definitely not there.” John shook his head, dropping the cloth to the floor. He lay his hand over the man’s pale stomach, spreading his fingers out. It pleased him, the contrast of his tanned skin against the light pallor of his lover. “This lovely white skin would burn there in an instant.”
An announcement overhead alerted them that they’d be stopping at Kings Cross Station in a matter of minutes. John forgot the text in the hustle and bustle of gathering their things and departing to find their next train. It was nearly dinner by the time a final taxi dropped them at the car park closest to their dorm.
Mycroft tracked the sound of ice water being poured from a plastic pitcher into a cup. “There’s nothing in it,” the man added, bringing the cup to his lips.
John pretended to nearly fall out of his seat. “Woah, was that an earthquake in here, or did you just rock my world?”
John felt like a thin veneer of “well” tacked over an ocean of not very well at all.  “Yeah, yeah,  . . . I’m good.”
“Fucking hell, come on.” John tugged his boyfriend toward the beckoning mattress. “I want to hold you on that great, big bed.”
Sherlock set the car in motion, slotting it smoothly into gear as he revved it into first. Again, John felt transfixed, watching his long, pale, clever fingers manipulating the gearshift, turning the wheel. They were leaving East Dean, and back on country lanes before John found his tongue again.
The sound of the waves, and the brisk smell of salt greeted them as they exited the car. The view from the top of the cliffs was magnificent, and John stood a moment soaking in the expanse of green downs and rolling blue beyond.
Gradually, John realized that Sherlock was asking him something, not merely murmuring a patter of  love and lust.
A number of dog handlers had already arrived, milling about, keeping their puppies on their leads by their sides lest they get over-excited at meeting so many people and pets all at once.
John sighed. “I am disappointed, but not in you, sweetheart.” He clicked off the wand and returned it to its place on the shelf. “I’m sorry you came out here to offer help, and had to deal with the likes of Reese.”
Sherlock fixed the interlopers with a steely-eye, and looking as regal as one could while caught starkers in a freezing lake, threw his shoulders back to challenge them. “It’s actually not true that you are meant to be out here.  Students of your year are not allowed by the lake without a chaperone. What happened in fact is that you got permission from Professor Pinworthy to use her classroom for a study group for charms. I’m sure she’d be very interested in hearing how you sneaked out the side door to come down to the lake on her watch.”
John wasn’t sure how they were going to say good-bye. In the end they didn’t. Sherlock stepped away, and slung his bags over his shoulder. With eyes glinting wetly, Sherlock simply raised a hand before he turned and disapparated.
“Do you know how much valuable information you’ve lost?” Sherlock forced out each word out hot and charged like a phaser burst. “I will be transferring the remaining detainees to a more secure facility where the physiology of those being questioned can be better taken into account.”
Wordlessly, John, who had managed to get his pants back on, handed him two more pots. When Sherlock was half-way through the second one, John plopped back on the sofa next to him, a selection of take-out menus in his hand.
Once the movie — and John — had reached a climax, Sherlock climbed back up on the sofa to enjoy some cuddling during the closing credits.
“You. Ex-army doctor. Invalided home. Working as a GP now, but you miss the excitement of field surgery. . .”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said, not knowing what else to say. He ripped a pinch off the bun, and brought it to his mouth.
John woke the next morning alone, feeling slightly disappointed. He’d half expected Sherlock to make another dramatic appearance in the middle of the night. Still, John had a busy schedule and little time to puzzle the mystery of his odd roommate. Coach had them running laps and doing a grueling regime of calisthenics every afternoon to get them back into shape after “slacking off all summer” as he put it. On top of a full course load, footie practice had him dragging back to the dorms utterly knackered. John fell asleep again alone that night, waking to a quiet room for a second morning.
.” Sherlock managed to answer, greatly proud of himself. Somehow he’d been able to form three whole words . . . in a row . . . and they seemed to be achieving the desired goal of moving him and a gorgeous, willing John toward somewhere private. It was more than he could have hoped for in the barely-acknowledged fantasies that occasionally crept into his consciousness when he drifted between waking and sleep.
“It’s a safe assumption.” Sherlock nodded. “But this time, we can bring the laptop, and use the light from the screen as a makeshift torch.”
Sherlock’s family was safe, and that was the best news, but they still didn’t want him seeing John. The idea of not seeing John had been horrid before, but after unraveling themselves together, after a night of sleeping cradled in John’s arms. Well, the idea of not being able to see John when he needed to was intolerable.
“Sherlock, do you know this man?” The detective inspector had risen, confusion writ across his face.
Thanks so much to all who left comments and kudos. It's been lovely to have so much support while writing this. This work is not beta'ed or Brit Picked, and I know so little about Afghanistan or how to speak Scottish. If I've made any glaring errors and someone knows better, do drop me a line. Again, thanks for the love, guys! It was a blast to bring this John Watson/Iain MacKelpie to life! :D
“Oh, John, Mr. Holmes, care for some more tea?” The accountant, Mona, stood by the bench, holding the kettle aloft. Sherlock felt quite parched at that point, and agreed for the both of them.
“Prophets. Okay, you’re right.” John pushed up onto one elbow. “Take a couple of the kids from your mok’bara class though. You could use the muscle.”
“We’re sorry, sir.” The boy called Almonz shuffled a toe over the ground. “We were only having fun.”
“Oh, husband. I’m sorry. I spoke with Sherlock about it. We agreed he’d give it up if he did extra music lessons.”
The man held himself stiffly. He had a detached air about him as he glanced about the room. For a moment, John fancied that he might be an anthropologist studying the average mating habits of the British upper class, circa early twenty-first century. John wondered if he were taking notes.
“You like that, hmmmmm?” Sherlock deep baritone voice was like dark chocolate on steroids vibrating down John’s ear canal. John made a completely undignified noise as Sherlock swiveled his hips, grinding the bulge in his trousers against John’s answering heat. His plush lips moved, mouthing kisses down John’s jaw to land at the soft skin under his ear. Sherlock’s teeth bit down with infinite gentleness. A jolt of electricity shot straight to John’s penis.
"SHERLOCK BLOODY HOLMES! You better have a damn good excuse for being in that hospital bed with a concussion and stab wound or so help me god I will make sure Molly doesn't give you any body parts to bring home and i'll invite Mycroft over for dinner!" he barked. Sherlock snapped his head up to look at John, "NO please! John don't invite Mycroft over! He'll eat all of our food and we'll starve!" Sherlock's baritone voice rising in horror.
I'm so sorry for the slow updates, I've been crazy busy with a lot of stuff, school, the musical, family stuff, and basically everything. But it's march break so i'm updating!!
John and Sherlock look at each other and turn back to the DI smirking, Sherlock clears his throat, "Detective Inspector Lestrade, Donovan, officers who are breaking my stuff, and the rat faced man who lowers the IQ of the entire street-" Anderson glares at him- "Let me introduce Captain John Watson-Holmes MD, recently returned from Afghanistan, and my husband" he says smugly as well as proudly.
While it wasn't gruesome, it still made many officers queasy and some tears shed for the family. The officers all turned to Sherlock who was trying to ignore the call, "Oi! Freak, answer your phone already, I don't know why someone would want to call you but we don't need to hear it constantly ringing" Sally shouted annoyed at him.
He looked back up to John's face and met his gaze, suddenly everything fell away and all he saw was his John. "John!" he screamed, not caring that every police officer turned to look at him, John quickly ducked under the police tape as Sherlock started running towards him. He just straightened up when he felt his Detectives tall body grab him into a back breaking hug, Sherlock started sobbing on John's shoulder while John ran his hand through the detectives hair, holding him as tight as he could, the cane already fallen to the ground. "Shhh, it's ok love i'm here now, i'm ok, and I won't be leaving again" John said softly while everyone, including a slack-jawed Donovan and Lestrade, continued to stare. Sherlock's sobbing turned into soft sniffling as he raised his head to look at his John, "Are you really not going back?" he whispered, John looked at him, his eyes starting to feel quite damp as well, "yes love, never going back, medically discharged and home for good" he said, then he grabbed the back of Sherlock's neck and pulled their lips together.
When John next opened his mouth, he spoke in a calm but firm voice, "Then why did you get injured when I told you to be careful on this case Sher, do you know how worried I was when I got a call from the hospital saying you got injured?". Sherlock mumbled something and John raised his eyebrow as if telling him to repeat what he said. The officers continued to look on in confusion and grew more uncomfortable.
"of course, let's go. Donovan can you take care of the gunman and-" Sally was already moving away, "Don't worry about it boss, i'll handle it" she said and walked off. John, Sherlock, and Lestrade started moving to the cop car when Sherlock suddenly turned around, marched over to Anderson who the soldier had let go when he saw Sherlock march over. In the blink of an eye, Sherlock had pulled his arm back and his fist suddenly collided with Anderson's face with a sickening crunch.
So... I've been thinking about making a separate fanfic about what happens after this scene. It will be a bonus scene about John and Lestrade meeting up at the pub and learning John and Sherlock's back story. So please comment and tell me if I should!
John finished the wrap he had gotten and stepped out to hail a cab, suddenly he noticed a black car approach him,
John walked inside and was greeted by a woman with dark skin and brown hair, she looked at him and her eyes softened when she saw his army duffel bag and cane. "Hello sir, I'm Sergeant Donovan. How can I help you?" she asked, he looked around while answering her, "I'm looking for Sherlock Holmes? Have you seen him? Tall lanky detective, curly black hair, can be a git often" he said with a small laugh, but stopped when he saw the woman's smile turn into a grimace and her features turned into annoyance.
Lestrade looked at him shocked while Donovan broke out of her trance and looked at John and smiled, "Husband? Well, if you're able to stop Sherlock from deducing all of us at crime scenes than I approve" she said, smirking but without the usual bite to it. Sherlock looked at her shocked before smiling a genuine smile and whispered a small "thank you Sally", not missing the Sherlock instead of Freak. John shook hands with her and than Lestrade who stuttered out a quick "nice to meet you".
"Excuse me, I need to get into room 122, please" a short blond man with his arm in a military looking arm sling asked the receptionist. He was wearing a black and white striped jumper and Lestrade could tell he was quite short from where he was standing. Suddenly, something clicked in his brain, 122 was Sherlock's room.
Sherlock got hurt on a case. John shows up at the hospital to make sure he's ok and surprises the yard. Surprise at the end involving Lestrade and Anderson.
Sherlock starts chuckling, Lestrade opens the door and turns his head back for a second, "Make sure you get my number from Sherlock so we can arrange at a meet up at a pub soon, alright?" he asks John, John nods. "Afternoon" Lestrade calls a winks at Sherlock and John before disappearing out the door.
The pair broke off their kiss and John grabbed Sherlock's hand in his a planted another kiss on his cheek. Sherlock smiled before freezing when he heard the officers shuffling their feet. Sherlock and John had forgotten that they had an audience.
Lestrade was drinking horrible tasting coffee in the drab waiting room of St. Barts, the consulting detective had gotten stabbed in the leg and hit in the head with a metal pipe by a murderer they had been tracking down for the past three days. It was only a small knife and luckily he only had a minor concussion but Lestrade still brought Sherlock to the hospital, ignoring his grumbling about not needing the hospital.
He had his eyes closed but opened them when he heard the door, the man had an IV, a black eye and split lip, obvious bandages around his midsection, and what looked to be an old arm sling. The officers were no consulting detectives but they could see some of an old scar through the hospital gown and could tell that it was an old injury that looked like it came from a gun.
John walks into the room with the three trailing closely behind, John still did not notice the officers, all his attention was focused solely on the man in the hospital bed. An IV was connected to his arm and his was typing away at his phone with a look of annoyance.
Anderson looked at him with nervous eyes and John turned back around, eyes softening as he looked at Sherlock and then Donovan and Lestrade. "It was nice to meet the two of you but if you don't mind I would very much like to go home with my husband now" he said, his voice still slightly edged with the commanding tone. "Of course you can, it was nice to meet you two, and maybe we can meet at the pub one day and you can tell me how you two met" Lestrade answered with an angry look at Anderson.
He walked over to Anderson and spoke in a quiet but commanding voice that carried across the now silent crime scene. The soldiers who know John shifted and and unconsciously stood at attention, knowing that when Captain Watson-Holmes used that voice, someone was about to get their ass handed to them. "My husband is not a freak or a psychopath, and I love him very much and he has many people who care about him, and if you ever say those things about my husband again, you won't be able to eat without a straw" he finished.
“John, you should have seen them.  Perfect specimens.  Five of them.  Bright yellow bands, perfectly marked.”
Mycroft arrives sooner than I would have thought possible, and I wonder, not for the first time, how far his abilities extend.  He nods at me and waves me back into the bedside chair I have commandeered.  I go back to reading the newspaper that I found in the cafeteria, trying to give Mycroft some privacy as he goes to Sherlock’s side.  I can’t help myself, I have to peek up over the pages.  I catch a glimpse of softness in Mycroft’s features for just a moment before I refocus on the paper.  I smile behind the paper shield.  It is nice to see those rare moments between the two rivals.  It only takes one of them to be unconscious.
His legs squeeze around me, his knees over my ankles pulling them down and apart, holding me in place against him.
I organise for Dr. Pawson to come back and watch whatever it is that Mycroft has in mind.  It is only a short wait until the doctor is back in the room.
She looks into my eyes with a bright light; I fight down the memory of the sound of fists against flesh that come with the bright spots in my vision.
I slip out as quietly as I can so as not to wake either John or Rosie.  By the time I get to the door I realise that I must have stood up too quickly.  Dizzy and blinded by a bright white that is only the creation of a drop in blood pressure.  I ignore the open door behind me, and grab for the banister, holding it tightly as I lower myself onto the top step.  It is always wiser to sit down than fall down.  A hard-won lesson, drummed in over time.
I am too apprehensive to ask and not presumptuous enough to just get into his bed.  Boundaries: he is fond of such things.
“I do feel the same way.”  I whisper impulsively as I take his hand.  I am torn between elation and fear.  It is my turn to stutter and blunder.  “But after what happened, out there, while I was away.  I’m not sure if… how I will cope with things… if you want it to be physical between us, I’m not sure if I can.  I’m scared of how I might react.”
“You cannot afford another concussion right now.  You’re still recovering from the last one.”  He rolls his eyes and I tell him to stay still.  “Why did you have to do that?  Why did you have to stir her up?”
“The Nightman.  Except it was his father.  And the lights were on.  It wasn’t Mycroft watching this time.  It was you.”  The anguish is still with me.  My skin prickles the heat.
He looks reluctant but agrees.  I am glad of the privacy.  I can feel composure unravelling like a dropped ribbon.  I don’t even know why I feel so stressed.
“To add confusion and doubt to everything else I was subjected to, that was almost too much.  That’s the thing; I could handle…can handle what they did to my body.  It’s only transport.  What gets to me is what it did to my mind.”
I sit on the edge of the tub and watch him.  My hand makes its way to his cheek.  Still rosy and cold.
I can’t look at him.  I just keep my eyes on the floor.  I know he knows something.  I have seen the way he has been looking at me.  I don’t know how much he knows.  I can’t look at him.  I cannot handle the way he looks at me.  I don’t know what to say.  I don’t know how to say it.
His back is to me as he edges the door closed.  His night vision goggles poke out from his pocket and his black notebook from under his arm.
I’m miserable by the time we arrive home.  Irritable too; spending the better part of two days in hospital can have that effect.  The cab ride had seemed longer than it should have.  The cabbie’s radio blaring Bollywood music and the sunlight splintering off the scratched windshield have done nothing for the splitting headache that just will not go away.
“It was nearly always perfect.”  Janette says with a soft smile.  “You looked sad when you spoke about your wife.  Do you want to talk about that?”
I am staring at the tiles I can see through the bathroom door; one of them is crooked.  But I am also reliving flashes of unwanted recollections.  They replay over and over and over again.  Goran with his fist pulled back.  Rasha twisting off the skin on my thigh with the pliers.  Rimac with his fingers up my arse.  Ivan bringing me water and choking on it because it makes me feel like I am drowning.  Waking up on the floor to the smell and taste of piss.  Zap ramming staples into my chest and arms and hands.  Shitting myself after hours and hours of trying not to.  Not being able to remember what day it is.  The questions again and again and again and the pain that always follows them.
My head hurts too much to read, I can’t focus on the words.  I can’t string together enough thoughts to work the cold case I have been tinkering with.  I don’t think there is enough to go on anyway.  It is one of those cases that is probably destined to go into the old chest that holds all my failures locked up together.
“Good night, Blossom,” I say as he holds her close so she can plant wet open mouth kisses on my face.  I wince as I will away the memory of the Nightman’s wet mouth against my own.  I am glad they don’t notice.
Shit.  I don’t remember that either.  Rosie is wriggling to get down and I distract her with the big magnifying glass.  She sucks wet marks onto the surface.  Her lips looking huge and twisted through the glass.
“Yes.  Mycroft organised it.  I was barely conscious, but I can remember how much the van shook when the bombs struck.  Apparently, no one at the compound was spared.”  I contemplate how much to tell John about Rimac.  As little as possible, I decide.  “There was one man that got away.  He wasn’t there when the bombs dropped.  I went back later, dealt with him.”
We eat quietly.  I don’t have any appetite, but I don’t want to bicker with John about it, so I choke down as much as I can.  Rosie eats as much as I do, and I try to lick the sauce off her fingers to make her giggle.  Inevitably, we get smears of sauce on both my shirt and dressing gown.  And quite a bit on my face too.
I grab the mail that I have stepped over multiple times as I came and went through the front door.  I flick through the letters as I go up with Rosie plastered to my side like a little pink koala.  Three of the letters look to be bills, one is from the London Symphony and one has a handwritten address; could be a case.
“Now, let’s make a plan, you mentioned you’d like to be better at regulating you anger, is that right?”
“All those things are adding to the pressure your under.  It is a lot for anyone to take on, but I do hear a tendency for you to place blame for your actions with others.  Do you think that is fair?”  Janette asks gently.  My heart is heavy.  Hearing it laid out like that makes me realise what a mess I have made of my life.  I have no idea how Sherlock can forgive me the things I have done to him.  I scrub at my face with my hands.  They come away damp.  I nod, not trusting my voice.  Janette continues, “but you want to make some positive changes in your life to assure that it doesn’t happen again.”
I had no qualms about shooting the man who attacked Sherlock and I would do it again tonight if I have to but, Christ, I could do without the subsequent interrogation.
Well at least that clears up my uncertainties about whether John is staying here tonight.  It had seemed possible that he might make a run for it after last night.  I am unsure what this means for sleeping arrangements.  I was more comfortable sleeping in his room than I have been anywhere for a very long time.  Maybe that was just the sleeping pills, or was it the change of scenery or was it John’s calming presence?  Too many variables changed at one time.  Very poor way to gather data.
“Sherlock.  Open your eyes.”  I say loudly.  He ignores me.  I am certain he has heard.  “I need you, for once in your life, to follow my instructions for just a minute.  Open your eyes”
As we drift off to sleep in the morning light I whisper into his ear as he did into mine earlier.  “I love you.”
He massages my shoulders.  Smoothing his hands along the length of my muscles.  His touch is firm and confident.  I know he must feel the scar tissue that mars the surface of my back.  Many of the scars are barely visible but touch will alert him to much more of the damage that was done.
“Shit, sorry.”  John says.  I hear him but only faintly through my rising panic.  My throat feels like it is closing up.  I freeze.  I hear the shouts of men that are not here.
The hospital room is dimly lit when I crack my eyes open.  I have a splitting headache and my shoulder throbs in sync with my skull.  I know that I am in hospital but have no recollection of getting here.  I have the vivid memory of feeling panicked.  Thoughts of Serbia drift in the periphery, but I know that that was a long time ago.  I try to remember what happened; what caused me to be here.  Each time I nearly have it, it drifts away like a name forgotten.  Almost remembered but alluding you.
“You had no right.”  His voice is strained but not aggressive.  It would be easier if it was.  A row would be much better than the empty pit of guilt and horror in my stomach.
We get great joy at watching Rosie gallop across the fields, and sometimes on the warm days, I even trot down the lanes with her on the old city carriage horse that we adopted to keep her thoroughbred company.
“Now?”  Asks Greg’s weary and exasperated voice, the phone must have woken him up.  “I expect this from Sherlock, but really John, it’s half four?”
“Don’t worry.  It’s too late now.  I’m not that hard to look up anyway, should someone want to visit.”
“I knew you would have it all under control.  You do have it under control, don’t you?”  The first hint of worry creeps into his voice.
“Would you like me to return the favour?” I ask hopeful that he wants to continue.  Watching him come undone is such a rare pleasure.
I use the spare time I now have, to organise a new mattress, new pillows, and new sheets.  Linda is a saint and she cuts the tags off everything and delivers them into the sitting room so as I can order a replica of each item.  Sherlock, of course, would want nothing else.
I was hoping for something a little more directive than that, but at least she doesn’t laugh at me.  Harry would have let go with a barrage of jokes.
Sherlock stands, goes to brush past me into the kitchen.  I can almost see him rebuilding the walls around himself and I am unsure that I should say what I am thinking.  I grab his wrist lightly, just enough of a touch to halt his flight.  He stops stiffly beside me.  I know, with instant clarity that what I want to say is true, but I am not sure how it will be received if I point it out.  I must act quickly, or I will lose the chance.  I lift my chin and swallow.  Decide that courage is something to strive for and that I am nothing if I lose my nerve now.
A nurse comes in.  I don’t recognise her, but she knows who I am and she tells me she will get a doctor.
“Where have you been?  I was worried about you.  I popped in to say hello and you were gone.”  She eyes me closely.  I’m sick of their scrutiny.
I’m not sure what makes me defy that voice.  Perhaps the fear that I will listen to it again in the future, when it tells me to be weak and scared.  The two things in this world I do not want to be.
Mycroft leans over Sherlock, he pulls the collar of the hospital gown away from this bruised throat.  Then he makes sure that none of the iv lines are tangled or lay across Sherlock’s arms.  He slips the sling off Sherlock left arm and folds the blankets down until they are low on his hips.
“You want to tell me about it.”  John asks softly squeezing my hand.  I try to regulate my breathing as I consider whether telling him will help or hurt.
He looks up at me for a second, and then speaks to the floor.  “My hands are shaking too much.  I can’t, wanted to, but I can’t get a vein.”
John carries my duffel bag up the steps for me as if I’m an invalid.  I’m sure that is the way he will continue to treat me while he stays; like a child.  The doctor was reluctant to let me go when I told him I live alone, telling him John was staying a while streamlined my discharge.  It is a good thing I like his company.  I just hope I can keep it together while he is here.
Once the cab driver drops us off at Baker Street it takes me three trips to get everything inside.  The first trip sees me leave most of the stuff in the street until I can pass Rosie over to Mrs Hudson.  She dotes over my daughter until I can get the playpen set up and the bags upstairs.  The initial awkward trudge up the stairs confirms my thoughts that Sherlock isn’t back yet.
“Lestrade cancelled on me.  He got called out on a double homicide and wouldn’t let me go along.”  Sherlock announced loudly as he barges through the door.  “Anyone would think…”
John is snoring softly against my shoulder his arm draped across my belly.  This is still relatively new, us sleeping together.  I don’t really know how to navigate it.  I have an erection.
“That’s not what brings you here today, though, is it, John?  Not directly anyway.”  Janette says.  “Why don’t you tell me why you’ve come to see me?”
I take a break for morning tea.  I’m not hungry, I just need a minute.  I sit on the back step at my clinic in the weak sunshine.  I finally take out my phone bracing myself for the message.
happen if you sleep.  I am losing the fight.  I clench my teeth.  Expecting the shattered molar to provide enough stimulation to keep me awake for
I sit down across from John and take my violin out of its case as John reads the article.  Nothing in it is at all surprising.   Typically, the press had done a bland job of reporting all the basic information in a way that will sell papers and whip the public into indignant rage and horrible fear, all while telling them absolutely nothing of use.  The part that they glaringly omit is that the criminal breaks into the homes while the residents are out and hides in wait for them to go to sleep before he attacks them.  He terrorises his victims before murdering them, subduing them with blunt force trauma to the head before tying them up and torturing them.  They also have not mentioned that he sexually assaults most of the victims with an unknown weapon both before and after they are deceased.  The burglaries are a distraction.  They are clearly not his motivation.  All this is information that has been withheld from the press.  As was my continued involvement; I had been on the case since the beginning.  I had decided to leak my involvement to the press yesterday.
Sherlock has hardly moved since he started talking but as I step closer, as I reach out towards him, he recoils.  It is the slightest of movements, but it stops me.  That small movement is like a stab in the guts.  I stand in the no-man’s-land between the door and the bed.
“Good.  I just want to recap a little bit to make sure I’m clear on all this.  Please correct me if I have misunderstood anything.  You have come in because you had an argument with your partner.  You have had a history of arguing and fighting with him.  One of your fights was serious enough to put your friend in hospital.  You are aware of how serious this behaviour is, and it is something you feel guilty about.  I can tell that.  I can also see that you have had a lot of stressors in your life recently; a new relationship, working through issues with your sexuality, you have moved house, you have a young daughter and you mentioned that your wife passed away.  Have I missed anything?”
I sit down beside him, realising how hurtful my words have been.  I try to explain.  “I told myself that lie so many times.  If you didn’t care, then I didn’t have to either; I wouldn’t have face up to my feelings about you.  It was easier to think you just didn’t give a shit.”
I turn towards him.  I kiss him.  This we have done often enough that it feels, well not entirely familiar, but not foreign either.
Somehow, I don’t believe it was easy though.  How could it be easy to go back and face someone who had done something so cruel and so… personal?
“You’re a bloody mad man.  You are enough to turn me grey.  I’ll have a unit swing by from time to time.  Keep your phone close and ring the minute you hear anything, alright?”
“Sherlock!  Get off your arse and grab Rosie for me.”  The frustration clear in his voice.  I look up to see that he has already turned away.  He is getting Rosie’s breakfast ready.  Rosie is crying from her playpen in the sitting room, but I hadn’t noticed until now.
At least that is something to do.  It is better than trying to sleep.  As was expected, it shows nothing suspicious, nor any change from the previous scan.
“You’ve been here all day.”  I don’t know how, but I know it is true.  “You should go home and get some rest.  Rosie must be missing you.”
He brings me undone with his touch and his heat and his passion.  When he tips his head back and tenses.  The look of ecstasy on his face makes me follow his climax.
The concern has only grown further by the time the taxi delivers me to the door.  I take the stairs two at a time.
The elephant in the room, the little divot and the long incision from the right anterolateral thoracotomy that saved my life after Mary shot me, and then saved me again a week later when they opened my chest again to stop the bleeding.
Sometimes I can stay in the moment long enough to catalogue some of the things he likes, where he is most sensitive, how he best likes to be touched, the pace.  He enjoys sex and I feel some envy for that.  Even when my mind is under control, often my body loses interest but a couple of times, I have been able to let go enough to come to completion.  I should consider those times a success, I guess but even then, I am left with an emptiness I cannot explain.  A lingering guilt that has no equitable foundation.  Despite all this; I want a relationship with John that includes intimacy, it’s just that nearly everything reminds me of what happened.  Even the simple fumbling hand jobs that have been the extent of our sexual bravery.
