"Of course. You know, John, what we do in these moments is to begin to open a door. It's nothing to open a door. Then, you can glance at the embrasure and, if what you see there pleases you, you can enter. The safeword is the certainty you can get out of it. Because what we do has a beginning and an end. It's a game. A
"To go interrogate Sanchez. She is married to Amos Sanchez, one of the musicians who was at the performance the night of the murder, and I'm dying to know which other musician he's sleeping with."
"You're okay?" he asks and that makes Sherlock smile.
They still look at each other for a few seconds before the doctor silently nods one last time before turning back.
“It’s an order,” Sherlock says coldly.
In front of him, there's Sherlock. He is already dressed for Christmas Eve with his black waisted suit and a shirt so dark it contrasts with his crystalline skin, poorly lit in this corridor where the lights are switched off. That doesn't prevent them from seeing each other's eyes. And that especially doesn't prevent the youngest one from figuring out that something is
, for God's sake. He doesn't extort confessions from him, doesn't take what interests him before throwing it away like any experience. He
"You two, get out."
Both of the men take a seat on a leather sofa which goes
"Sleep, now," Sherlock whispers, his hand resuming his stroking on the wounded forehead.
"Beautiful, isn't it?" Moriarty whispers and for a brief instant, they feel they're all breathing the same air.
"Five hours of sleep, that should be enough."
Once back in Baker Street, the doctor hadn't taken any offense at the faded lights and the silence. He had walk directly to his room, before falling asleep still half dressed, hand tightened around the mobile which he hadn't switched off after his small tour on the terrace. But that's something Sherlock doesn't need to know.
"Yes of course, I told him."
"And certainly not very interesting in the long run. I imagine she attracts men for whims without future. You can't build anything with this kind of woman. Well, good day Mrs Sanchez."
"Yeah. Yes. Are you making tea?"
. Do you understand me?"
"The fact r-remains that you are obviously not eating a lot. Sometimes, when mom comes home late, we order Thai food. I can give you the number if you want, they deliver."
Both flatmates are looking at the DI to verify if his phone call will end soon. He gives them a vague sign of the hand to tell them to wait still, before starting again:
"You're still having a hard time with your boss?" asks Molly with a soft voice.
He doesn't seem happy about it; he even looks like he forgot how to close his mouth. Sherlock forgot his wallet. His free hand rubs his forehead, his smile seems to require a heightened effort, but he turns around again to the brunette and pays the second
John smiles, stretching his jaw, and shakes his head.
!", simply explains Moriarty, raising his left hand in the air. "Of course you were going to see it, Sherlock, I know you."
"Would you like some tea?"
"Take off your clothes."
"It's Greg. I had to go to my place first to take a shower -it's the second time a jerk pissed on me this week- I'll be there in 10 minutes. He's not there yet?"
"You haven't come back to Baker Street yet?" Lestrade wonders, suddenly much calmer.

Of course John cannot answer. He simply doesn't know what to say. He hasn't looked at it directly since he left Afghanistan. It's not a matter of courage, it's a matter of "
"For Christ's sake, Watson!" Barrow bawls on the ground, his hand surrounding his nose, which is covered in blood. "You sick psycho! You're fired, do you hear me?
"John, we've been calling you for 10 minutes, are you sleeping or what?"
"I have to go, I will tell you what the Swiss have to say."
"Where are Sherlock and John?"
"Leave me, Greg," the brown-haired man curses by rejecting the hand with a dry gesture, still not aware that Ben's rib cage is moving faster and faster as if he's running out of air. "You were the first ones standing up, you obviously saw something,

Hi everyone, I hope you're all doing fine. Huuuuuge thanks for today's chapter as it's the lovely
There's one second of pure confusion, where only two violins and an oboe are still resonating in the odious mutism in which the room is suddenly plunged. The silence is a part of music, but this one is tinted with a deep red, overrunning the scene. John raises in his turn and the scream the harpist shouts out is the starting point of a long series of horrified cries from the first rows.
The door closes and he finally breathes. It's just a piece of fabric of poor quality and no way it's going to be a phobia, so John forgets the fictive red dots which seem printed on his retina and sits in his Speaker's chair which is only impressive by its name. He doesn't like this leather seat; during the summer, his bare arms stick to the chair by the sweat, and the rest of the time it makes an exasperating
,” he reads out loud, stunned.
"Is everything all right?" Not that he cares, but he has to start the conversation somewhere.
“What?”

"You're right concerning Benjamin. But you have to be more careful, he's cardiac."
“You know...” repeats the policeman, eyebrow raised, clearly not reading his friend’s innuendoes.
"Sherrer was a real connoisseur of Liszt. On the last thirty performances he gave, 87 % of them contained his airs...
name is Gregory."
She had looked at him, her chin lowered, with a timid smile. Wrongly. A facade to hide a wound.
"Sher..." John starts, coming closer from a step without realizing it but Sherlock's hand raises to tell him to stay where he is.
The psychopath slowly walks down the stairs. Theatrically, he clenches his fist against his chest, under the intensity of the song and he still doesn't open his eyes. He gets closer, a foot after the other as if he's walking on silk and he’s shaking his finger in he air to mark the rhythm. He should stop walking, John is sure about that fact, but no, he's coming closer and closer and now is so near them that John draws back by reflex. Sherlock doesn't move. It's inevitable and it ends like this: Moriarty is facing him.
extraordinary."
"Because Mr. Holmes asked me why we had a row during the interval, so I had to tell him that you were banging an old man."
is looking at her.
"Mrs. Hudson is just teasing me. Well, Sherlock and I can't be a couple. You know me."
Benjamin is crossing the door when he turns around towards Sherlock, to whom he addresses a tiny smile:
"Everything you did. For me."
It's only now that John realises this, but even if their pelvis hadn't touch, they had moved so hard on the mattress that they had made a terrible noise with the swaying head-board. The annoying closeness of the neighbors, typical of London, will certainly not forget to remind them of this night at the first opportunity, it's certain.
"Let's wait for Sherlock, otherwise he'll sulk," answers Lestrade, smiling.
"You could have died. For fuck's sake, you and Sherlock could have died! Did that cross your mind at one point or, like the two jerks that you are, you really thought you could handle it yourself?" his voice is so strong it hits the walls. He puts his fist against his hips and everything in his attitude reminds John of the DI they didn't remember to call before they went to face Moriarty.
John, pushed as far as possible against the cold wall so as not to touch his flatmate's naked body, frowns and asks:
"In conclusion, a day like any other. Like me. "
"You have jam on your sleeve."
"Ah... Okay," answers John feeling silly, turning around again.
John watches the long fingers squeezing the dark blue blanket in rhythm with Herrmann's music. Sherlock's joints are getting whiter under the effort and if he were able to put his hand on John's cock, the doctor could at least put his hand over his. But what Sherlock did to him in the evening after the party was sexual, undoubtedly. To take him by the hand, John isn't sure what that would mean.
"Were you able to come without Sherlock?"
"I have not answered you since
"Sherlock, for the love of God,
There is no noise outside Lestrade's office, they are alone and between Sherlock and Benjamin, there are thick invisible clouds filled with very tangible flashes of lightning. Doris keeps her Olympian peace which John worships beyond words. It really is time to have a conversation with Sherlock concerning good manners.
"Craig Jennings?" asks John, incredulous.
The doctor breathes in and bends forward, pressing his elbows on his knees.
"Wh.."
"Did you know the victim?" pursues Gregory eventually, because Sherlock still doesn't seem ready to open his lips.
John and Sherlock steps back by reflex, as their body were almost touching and John smiles as much as he can before he answers:
His right hand leaves his pocket to open the door. He turns around toward the doctor.
"I know what you're going to say, that it's the best thing to do, and maybe even tell me that this is the most respectable choice, right? Four months ago I would have believed you, but…" he smiles, shrugs, and explains in the most natural way possible, "that's not what I want."
11:05 PM
“Who were you talking with, Sherlock? Who were you talking with these past three days?”
"Yes."
"Ah. He is innocent. He wouldn't do a thing that would prevent him from seeing his son."
After his fourth journey to the vending machine which is short of M&M's, John finally stops on the seventh floor terrace to look at the city wrapped in a night punctuated by thousands of small enlightened windows. He closes his jacket and realises that it would finally be time to look for his jumpers, hidden by the good care of his joint flatmate. And as the wolf that Sherlock Holmes can be, John just has to think of him for his mobile to vibrate.
"Would you let me blindfold your eyes? Would you let me undress you completely, in the middle of the living-room, in broad daylight?"
white - deploying in the light of day and only blinks when his flatmate closes the door behind him. In a noisy sigh, John lets himself fall against the pillows and observes the ceiling. It's doubtlessly a dream, an illusion, it's certainly not the reality. Not because John had never imagined he'd wake up next to a man not completely dressed, but it's that he had never imagined he'd be so...
"We met Elisa during a case a few years ago. She works in a luxury hotel where there had been a murder and we went to question her."
08:37 PM
The blond coughs briefly, shakes his head one time, and crosses his hands behind his back, an unconscious gesture which proves he hands over the reins to Sherlock, who advances a step to scrutinise their first suspect.
"I'd say three more weeks to go with your plaster cast on your right wrist. Concerning your hip, we did an ostheosynthesis ansfw we... Well, you know, you're a doctor too"
Sherlock breathes in and leaves the kitchen. John quickly follows him and catches him by the arm in the stairs he’s ready to hurtle down.
And he can't stop thinking this is where Sherlock grew up, between those lands from another world, from another time. And everything is as beautiful as he is, as tall and extraordinary. Lakes have the color of his eyes, the rocks his skin's coldness. And the wind makes the trees dance thanks to the imaginary melody his violin sings. This genius is from here, from this land where humans are so rare they didn't see anyone, not even a house, for thirty minutes. So John wonders how Sherlock learned to decipher people, those he can't stand.
. Not good to show to the world (well, Tesco) the gender of the person he's living with. He enters the confectionery department and smiles when he recognizes Jessica, the student who has worked here half-time since September.
It's exactly what he was going to say, so why did she pronounce it with so much disdain? Her eyelids are quickly closing, her lips are half-opened to breathe better, and it seems like she's slightly trembling under the anger.
"Well, as Mr. Holmes said, I slept and it's when all these people began shouting that I woke up."
“Are you afraid when I'm driving?”
"Could the ballistics be wrong?"
"Well, I'd better go before he forgets me and we end up paying two taxis for nothing. Thank you again, Greg; see you tomorrow," smiled John. He shook the DI's hand with one last smile before running behind the £1100 coat he was seeing more often from the back that from the front.
John had remained seated on a plastic chair, looking at his flatmate wrapped in his long black coat, swirling around the white naked body, and rocked by the chiaroscuro of the scene, not a word had gone out of his mouth. Of course, Sherlock found nothing, John deduced nothing and this waste of time had only consolidated them in the respective muteness.
If, by any chance, someone's willing to beta the last 5 chapters (which are currently unbeta'd), please don't hesitate in commenting or contacting me on Tumblr!
like that. She seems above everything and everyone with an astounding simplicity and John is jealous. It's not worth it to try to hide himself behind other words, he's drunk anyway.
"I am a doctor, please let me through..."
"What about you, Sherlock, what did you do today?" John smiles as far as possible, determined to make this impossibly stubborn life still go on, whatever he might say.
John doesn’t need to nod; this is obvious.
"Ah," John nods before chancing his thin lips to the hot edge of the ceramic.
Lestrade gets up, his glass of champagne in his hand. Sherlock and John, seated one facing the other, follow his example. All three are looking at the dean, who hides her mouth behind a frail hand, but her shining eyes are the only proof they need to discern how happy she is.
The same evening, when John wakes up after his twelfth nap of the day, there are exactly thirty-four bouquets in his bedroom, all made with different a flowers.
“Are you okay?” he whispers so low that John has the feeling his heart stopped beating for one second to hear him.
"Moriarty likes to make a spectacle of himself."
"Blackberry always near her, dark rings under her eyes visible despite the make-up... She has a job with high responsibilities. Give up now, Sherlock, I'll resolve this before you," smiles John, leaning forward without knowing it.
"So, Mrs. Perkins gave me her till receipt, and as I told her, she went to the pharmacy to order the adhesive for her dentures on Thursday and not on Tuesday. Bad thing, old age is -makes you lose your mind."
“If you want to throw up, just warn me so I have time to park, alright?” worries Lestrade, sneaking side glances as the Astra Vauxhall starts to move.
"This has nothing to do with what I want, it's something that I
Sherlock nods his head once and turns toward his flatmate, to whom he's sending a delighted smile.
"Why?"
"You know Sherlock, for a sociopath, you are fucking brilliant."
John wants to hold on, so much, to not show his flatmate he's been so fucking close to climax ever since Sherlock put his fingers on him, and that it's tiring up his muscles, clenching his teeth and making him lose his mind. That doesn't escape from Sherlock, who tightens his hand around the fair hair to make him tilt his head backward.
"The top shelf."
“But as I was telling Mrs. Hudson, there are renovation works at the observatory this week so you can’t visit it…” he adds, slightly confused by their reaction.
, of course, the telescope. They arrive under a dome and the doctor loses his breath for a second. He never likes high, might that be if he's on top of a tower or at its feet. To raise his head to look at the white telescope makes him dizzy. It looks like the telescope is stucked in a gigantic spiderweb, expect the rods holding it are made of metal. The dome is open and the tip exceeds from a few meters. John feels so small.
"What does he want?"
10:57 PM
"Now."
Sherlock politely smiles, aware of the words' debatable absurdity and slowly drinks his beverage, filling the room with the fragrance of tea. It takes quite a while before one of the two men open their mouth again, but that's okay. Since a long time ago -since the first day, quite frankly- John understood that with Sherlock, their relationship is so simple and so pure, that even silence is not embarrassing. It's priceless, really, because if he had to burn a note every time he was seated next to a date, having nothing to tell her and suffering from the silence as the more terrible torture, he would be simply broke. Not that he's really rich. And not that Sherlock is a date.
"Benjamin has Down syndrome," explains the doctor to Mycroft but the gesture is in vain because the oldest Holmes has turned to his brother, of whom he drinks in the words.
10:10 PM
"Hello, Jessica."
"After what I've just read? Nope, thank you," laughs the woman. "Would you tell me how it happened, then? It's crazy that this guy was shot during the concert. And even crazier that you were there!"
"What are you talking about?" intervenes Craig Jennings, with a lost look on his face and a trembling voice.
"Sheri, go back home, okay? Don't take care of that," answers the engineer very calmly, covering her with a gaze as soft as a summer night.
"What do you mean
What am I supposed to "know"? -SH
"Possibly," concludes Sherlock. He lacked concern for this insignificant data before starting again, back to his flatmate, his eyes sliding from the DI to the nurse on his knees next to them. "I think John should go to hospital to have some examinations."
“Good evening,” the detective says with a cold stare.
“Give me two seconds to…” he heavily swallows. There’s a drop of sweat sliding along his neck and he gets ready to ask Sherlock for a pause when they hear a voice.
Despite the perfectly serious and concerned look on the youngest man's face, John surprised himself by smiling, and his hands didn't shiver once. Because no matter if a psychopath with an international reputation had just placed a time bomb on his back, which could have blown up Westminster, it was out of the question if he ended up with a wet crotch in front of half of Scotland Yard.
"Oh, no, not a cervical a collar; a leather collar, John."
"Hello Doctor."
His laugh gives John cold sweats.
"Yes, precisely,
"Don't move, don't speak. An ambulance is on its way."
"John, stay with me."
I know what you're trying to do. It's ridiculous. -SH
11:52 PM
"Greg, that's not..."
Long live AO3. Here's a new chapter already because the last comments just boosted me SO DAMN MUCH. Thank you all, you're awesome!
sure. But his flatmate slides his hand under his jeans to rub his buttock then, and sod it.
"Entirely," he repeats in a melodious voice.
"You come to spend Christmas at Baker Street?"
John smiles, and the fine wrinkles at the corners of his eyes embody the very concrete answer Sherlock was waiting for.
It doesn't change much, but when he and Sherlock meet a fifty-year old woman in the stairwell, John has the reflex to smile at her and wish her a good day. She would have probably never noticed their existence, but when they're about to enter a dead man's place, John always has a renewal of absurd politeness. They arrive at the landing on which they walked for the first time months ago, and when Sherlock takes out of the pocket of his coat his equipment to force the lock, John asks:
Seated on the leather armchair in his office, he gets lost in the alternative reality of another encounter with Sherlock, in Bastion Camp in Iraq, one evening before his garrison would have been called to the South of the country. Because it's often that which urged him to break the basic heterosexual education which society imposed on him: the idea that everything can change, even life, which can stop in an instant.
"Craig Jennings," answers Sherlock, not impressed at all, standing next to the window, inspecting a rope of his violin.
John nods and finally realises Sherlock is still wearing the same suit covered with dirt.
"It seems like everybody knows."
at you, indeed.
?” he asks enthusiastically, saying the last two words with a twangy voice that you only hear in cartoons.
"The killer wasn't placed in the back-scene," concludes Sherlock before stretching out his left hand to draw the trajectory of the missile in the air.

"Sir, please," Mrs. Cox tries to calm the detective.
"And what is going on between Elisa and Greg?"
"Do you ever think about what happened at the swimming pool?"
"Look at me, John." Sherlock repeats a bit more firmly. "Put your hands on my shoulders and do not leave them."
"Other than leftovers?"
08:37 PM
"Listen, Sherlock, the other night it was... I was a bit drunk, okay? It was Christmas..." John adds, as if it could possibly explain his actions. "I don't want... I don't want you to touch me. We are flatmates -friends, maybe- but in any case, I don't want... "

"Oh yes, very hot but... it didn't work out, you know."

They stay silent even if John feels Greg’s stare on him, absolutely waiting to talk about what is happening between the both of them (as it’s clear he understood) but John is really not ready for that talk so he goes back to the living-room, ready to fall back asleep on the couch when Molly and her boyfriend (

"A few months... 12, maybe."
"O-okay," John smiles, hurrying to slide off to give Sherlock the possibility of getting up.

"Do not get defensive, it's not a critique."
"Hello? Yeah, I'm at work, I don't have a lot of time... Ah, yes, in the second drawer."
"Never ever," responds Sherlock, whose voice is still half covered by the deafening music - his better ally tonight.
"I'm going to kiss you now."
Something's not right.
) enter with a short breath and red cheeks.
John rolls his eyes and quickly takes his jacket off and puts it on his knees before grabbing the black fabric over the detective.
And then there was Christmas, which could have been a holiday like any another (with a wry Sherlock and a slightly drunk Mrs. Hudson) if there hadn't been Irene Adler. He wasn’t sure what was the most dangerous, between the phone and her long legs. However, it is certain that Irene Adler came and knocked down everything. So much happened during that period that John doesn't even know what to think anymore about all this. There was her death (the first; the fake one), and Sherlock's breakdown (whatever he may think, it definitely was one), then her
And once more, sounds do not even seem to reach up to the brilliant brain because Sherlock contorts in his seat to try to see the musicians from all the possible angles, at the same time kicking the back of the seat where Angie Walsh is installed, who curses very vivid insults.
"How is she?"
The forensic frowns, looks around him bewildered, and walks with a ridiculous speed up to the chair, before resting the end of his buttocks as if he was afraid it could catch fire.
Hi! Did you know that I have a
"Lestrade sent me Sherrer's address. He'll be over there at 10."
"Really?" asks Sherlock, in a perfectly controlled grin.
Have you been drinking, John? -SH
"You are not ready but you're thinking about it. And that obsesses you," he looks at his watch and raises his head "It's late, go to sleep. We'll go question the Walsh sisters tomorrow."
. Now, Sherlock, go back home, take a shower, enjoy a good scotch and do... whatever it is that you usually do when I come to save you, and tomorrow I'll want every detail on this Moriarty."
You're right, I'm sorry. -J
"Mr Steele, could I see your papers, please?"
The ground and his shoulder and cold.
"We didn't need words to
The doctor smiles, following the example of his friend, and gets up to shake his hand, his left firmly attached to the file.
"Yes, I figured that out by myself, thank you," he barks inadvertently.
11:51 PM
? Thirdly, we have the lamest seats. You don't even have space for your legs!"
John Watson has been scared of heights since he was a little boy. Emptiness only means one thing: the death call; the siphoned life where they're all going to end. His legs aren't useful anymore, so he comes closer to the ground, his hands hold on tight to the humid mud. Sherlock promised he'd catch him if he was falling, so Sherlock, catch me.
"Well, clean up this mess and let's get out of here. And, Sherlock," Lestrade doesn't finish his sentence but John raises his eyes in time to see him staring at the detective, who answers with a nod.
And I don't have a girlfriend either. -SH
"Sherlock."
"I know you git, but
"No," she confirms so dryly that John keeps silent immediately.
Sherlock's hands release the button and settle on the doctor's shoulders, lower than his, that he's carefully dusting.
This time it's Sherlock who kneels and while he catches some of the fair hair to get his face close to the doctor's, his second hand rolls up around the hard length already wet with precome.
11:18 PM
Angie Walsh? Too young...

"John, I don't care what people think. People are boring. They're idiots, distracting sometimes by their stupidity, but in no case should their verities be considered as The Truth. Do you think it's right to take into consideration Anderson's claims when he calls me a freak?"
He's ready to give up, persuaded his flatmate is kidding just to make a fool of him, when Sherlock's body heat is pressing against him. He feels his back wrapped by the brown-haired man's chest, his hips against his and the back of his own thighs pressed by knees with striking bones. It's physically impossible, John knows it, he's a doctor for God's sake, but it seems that every tiny plot of land of the detective's body found a place against his. Sherlock's right hand settles slowly on his pelvis and lays his palm down, all of his fingers.
how the nights with Holmes were everything but relaxing.
Of course it is. But don't blame yourself, the majority of people have brains even lazier than yours. -SH
"Pregnant? Ah, no, you are..." but he doesn't finish his sentence and raises his look towards Steele before turning on his heels and coming down again up to the scene. "Where is Anderson?" he asks once among the musicians and the forensic raises a hand, a conceited smile on his lips. "Perfect, please take your place right here," Sherlock pursues, pointing at Sherrer's last chair.
"The cheapest," corrects Sherlock, his arms still crossed against his chest and his eyes fixed on the empty scene unlike the audience, getting bigger and louder.
;) -J
The engineer looks down while his teeth bite his lips. He's unmasked, it's obvious, but from what? John may recall the last twenty minutes in his mind, but he understands strictly nothing. He raises his small snub nose towards the DI but Lestrade shares the same completely skeptical expression, making it clear that it's not really possible to count on his help.
"Sheri, witnesses saw you during the interval," John interrupts with a voice that is drier than usual.
"You had never seen a dead man before?" asks Sherlock, with a bit of mockery, looking at the son.
who translated it and once again
Jim Moriarty sings Celine Dion and they're going to die this way. Well, that’s something else.
The doctor's hand barely hesitates and slips into the long black coat the detective didn't even remove. He doesn't need to see where he slips his fingers; he has done it a hundred times under the youngest's orders. Being the oneto make such a decision seems to offer him an absurd pride.
"What do you want to do now, Sherlock?"
"Lestrade," salutes Sherlock, eyes scanning the room around them.
The door opens and Sherlock appears. He scans the room for two seconds and frowns.
"So, I don't know what Sherlock promised to you, but, believe me, he already tried to handle a relationship and it lead to nothing."
that they are the only ones on all this damned Earth who can hear it.
"The mother was right since the beginning, concerning the shooter."
Angie explodes with false laughter, and in her badly closed mouth John can see chewing gum and her glottis. Charming.
The doctor just raises a hand to answer him. He has red cheeks from the sudden change of temperature, his eyes maybe a little inflated, also, and his breath is jerky.
John held his laugh with difficulty whilst pouring the boiling water in the two cups he put on the table, before taking his place to face his flatmate. They make the ceramics bang together, smile, and in one movement get their mugs close to their mouths before blowing softly.
were hurting him. When was the last time he had a proper meal? Oh yes, of course. Noon. Well if a crisp-bread sandwich and three peanuts stolen in the pub down the road could really constitute a meal. Faced with Moriarty, however, he wasn't hungry at all, but as always, everything had to become calm before the storm.
It takes an infinite time to cross the city from North to South, to slalom between the taxis, the cyclists and the European tourists who are crossing over even when the traffic light is red. The night is falling and the lights are rising. John rests his forehead against the window of their cab and he looks without seeing. Is Moriarty back in his snipers delirium or has he attached dynamite to some poor guy's belt? Are him and Sherlock making a terrible mistake by going to face him?
“Since when does Sherlock offer you flowers?” he asks.
01:20 AM
must not be the correct word," Sherlock says back with a squeaking voice.
"Sherlock..." starts John, flattening the newspaper on the kitchen table for a long time just to have something to do with his hands.
"Of course, when you rub yourself on me like that..."
08:36 PM
"Eh?"
Mycroft and John turn around and discover Sherlock in the doorway, only dressed in his black boxers, a tray in his hands - which John suspects to be the base of their wooden chessboard - on which he put a teapot and two cups. John takes advantage of the fact that the government official is turning his back on him to make a sign to his flatmate to bugger off and chop-chop, but waving by pointing at the stairs doesn't seem to be a clear gesture for the detective, who enters the room anyway. He by-passes his brother, who at least has the decency to look away when he gets closer, and puts the tray on the bedside table, pushing away the box of condoms which falls in the small space between the piece of furniture and the wall. He goes back under the covers in his turn, cheerfully pushing John who doesn't think he could be hallucinating more. In fact, it's not a dream, but definitively a nightmare.
"No, no, let's talk about it, because we're not moving forward. We questioned all the suspects established by the ballistics, right?"
"Very good deduction, John. What about you?"
"Why did you go to the concert, then?"
amused.
to give to Sherlock.
Both of them laid on their sides, facing and looking at each other, John immediately thinks he could warm him up if he's cold. Like a memory call, he raises his hand very slowly to give time to the impetuous mouth to shut him down with a snap of a tongue. He brings it closer to the fragile shoulder and wraps it silently. And still those two astounding blue iris are on him.
The man in the long coat seems to understand all the same because he turns back with the speed of a dog taken in fault. John intervenes on his path, keeps his feet firmly put on the pavement covered with chewing gum, and catches him by the shoulders when he tries to by-pass him:
"I do not see why our relationship is
"He's
"What
a good evening."
01:19 AM
Sherlock pulls a face and goes to the kitchen, followed by John with ruffled hair.
But Sherlock never forgets that John exists. Sherlock never forgets about John. So John moves closer, so brave and so quiet that he is. A step. Another one. Faster. All of his body crashes against Moriarty's and he hears his gun hit the ground at the same instant their legs swings over the guardrail. It's finally when he pulls Jim Moriarty with him in his fall that John Watson understands the definition of the word
The brown-haired man comes into the office and stands next to the windows. He crosses his hands behind his back and is looking at the Cox family with a superiority completely as equal as all the other times he questioned a suspect. John wants to roar, to ask for a little of condolence, but he knows that he doesn't have the necessary energy to explain to his flatmate what that is. It's with a light anxiety that John looks
There are some in the

"Sherlock?" Lestrade intervenes by raising a hand to prevent him from answering, which immediately works.
are enough to make the simplest of Londoners freak out at the idea of admitting that he would accept a little of support from time to time.
"This vents the frustration, you know."
John raises his head from his newspaper and looks to his right, the wall covered with the proof settled by Sherlock and Benjamin, where the suspects' photos have been ripped out last night. There's only Sherrer's pictures left, with and without his open skull, covered with a series of darts that the detective has been throwing since the beginning of the morning.
, thank you a billion times doll!
"I can't leave him, do you understand? I love him. Maybe not as others think, but I love him enough to fight for him."
But Gregory doesn't wait any longer and holds the engineer's arm with strength to take him up to a cell. Sheri gets ready to follow them, breath short and tears at the edge of her heart, and John almost jumps up on her shoulders to prevent her from going any farther.
The woman hardly shakes her head and slowly closes the door, plunging both men into the usual cold of the capital.
, he repeats to himself, but there's something about the detective that attracts him, as if gravity suddenly reversed before being materialized into his way-too-tall body. John hates physics.
"Can you put b-back the clarinetist p-please?"
a present, dear readers :) I hope you'll enjoy this chapter and would love to hear from you.
"Is he a friend of Lestrade? A known personality? A member of the Royal family?"
"Lestrade?"
"Funny," he smiles ironically before looking away again.
John raises his eyebrows and answers while walking towards his sister's chamber.
Something like that. -SH

. Because you are clever, terribly clever. You hide yourself behind shapeless, really squalid jumpers; you're lowering yourself, constantly. You fade, you shy away behind your big acts of bravery or your more discreet altruistic attentions... But you cannot run away or lie any more. I will see what you hide, at last.
Sherlock smiles one last time and that simple movement of his lips leaves a red-hot iron track on John's mind, who only thinks about the kiss he should have blown on it.
"Dvorak this evening, Tchaikovsky on Tuesday and Thursday, Liszt the week after, Paganini on..."
"There will be no chains, no dark and wet cellar. No latex, or woman in leather insulting you in German, either. You can remove these ineptitudes out of your head. It's not a question of suffering or shame."
"Fucking Christ, Sherlock what's your problem? If I called John and only John it's because I knew I could trust him and that you, you would blow up the whole thing!"
Sherlock uncrosses his long fingers before getting up and disappearing into the living room. He doesn't bring his empty plate to the sink and the doctor is persuaded that he acted so as a punishment. It's childish but, of course, it works. John finishes his tea and gets up in his turn to briefly tidy up the kitchen.
I'm so grateful for those of you who have read all those 27 chapters, I hope you appreciated this story as much as I enjoyed writing it. I'm sending you all the love and hugs I have in my heart. Cheers everyone :)
"A few...," answers Sherlock, shrugging a shoulder, obviously holding back the excitation sparkling in his eyes like a million stars.
"He was a v-very good horn player," Benjamin intervenes, nodding his head with elegance.
John waits that is friend is in the kitchen to rubs his face persistently. Lestrade used words like trust, himself and accept and they are resonating in him, bouncing in his ribcage, going up to his head and finds the natural path to the only name he thinks about since he was waiting alone in the waste ground: Sherlock.
"No, believe me,
They're backtracking, seeing the same paintings that are still so ugly, the same lawyers who are still so unbearable that John carefully avoids looking at them so as not to be tempted by the desire to scream at one of them. Even if it would be much more intelligent to shout at Sherlock. And even more intelligent to replace the shouts with words, because they really need to speak about this obsession that the detective has for this domination thing. And all this began because of a turtleneck... Unless it began before. In brief, domination or not, the fact remains that to mention their private life in front of a suspect is a mixture of non-professionalism and total disrespect, and it is this last point which still has John's knees trembling.
"Tell me a word," murmurs the same voice again, stuck on his ear, so low,
He nods awkwardly, mumble a few words to insult the fictional driver and shakes
"The..." he doesn't finish his sentence. He will not say the word that will stop everything. Not already. "Surprising," he finally confides.
"That's not
scores in his hands. It's always getting back to him as a gentle but firm slap behind his neck, even if it's bloody obvious, that Sherlock is genuinely beautiful with his almond-shaped eyes which are as offensive as they are cherishing, his milky skin and the brown curls contrasting on the top of his skull. Sherlock Holmes must have been created to drive the world mad and it's not John who'll say otherwise, not when the only thing crossing his mind right now is how much he wants to pull him into his arms and lay him on the bed against which they're sitting - but of course, it's not very polite to fuck somebody between sheets that are not your property.
"John, are you okay?"
"We questioned them this week. Of course, nobody saw a thing; no weapon, either. In short, we are at a standstill. The ballistics' report cannot help us more. According to if Sherrer was reading the score or was following Denosa, the inclination of his head doesn't allow us to establish exactly where the shot was fired from. Of course, all the suspects remain under surveillance and can't leave the country, but if you could take care of that quickly, that would help us a lot - with
"Easy! A bit of condolence cannot kill you, you know!"
10:10 PM
“Is it painful?” asks the older man while opening the left front door of his car.
Oh. No.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow, John smiles.
"It's not a common story. The newspapers say you're going to arrest the murderer soon?"
Lestrade sighs out loud and gets closer to the table to make Jones and Hendrik sign their deposition, and the doctor just has time to turn his head before glimpsing Sherlock's amused smile overlooking him.
"You spoke to her about the cure, then?"
. The worst part was here, in this living-room with the improbable wallpaper, the spying skull and the smell between dust and greatness where Sherlock reeled continuously. The worst was the calm.
"Well, seeing as you did not answer my texts, I wanted to come to verify that everything was well."
"The case is moving forward at its pace and it is not
"Yeah, act like I don't exist, why would I mind?" says John with irony.
"He had way more things when we came the first time," notices John, looking at only three boxes.
"Happy birthday Sherlock."
"Ready for what?"
"This scene is legendary," comments John, eyes fixed on the screen.
John wipes his right hand over his wet forehead and over his eyes, which he firmly massages so as to wake up. With the heat, the splint set on his left arm is even more stifling.  The medicine helps him bear with the pain of his broken shoulder, but makes him feel woozy and exhausted by the dizziness. At least he is conscious, which wasn’t quite the case when he arrived at the hospital yesterday.
"He's with me," reassures the blond with a shake of the head to Jessica.
Sherlock is still smiling at him, with a kind of pride the blond doesn't miss. It's quite mutual.
"Yes, she's kind of cute."
When he leaves Scotland Yard, he hesitates between taking the Northern line to join the Marie Stopes centre, near Fitzroy square, in which he still didn't postulate. When he was studying at Bart's, he came across young women dreaming about deepening their knowledge there and, even though he chose the path of gunpowder, he now understands this craze for this institution where he distinctly sees himself passing a couple of years. He's convinced that, in the Marie Stopes centre, he won't ever meet a chief like Barrow again.
08:36 PM
"Good morning."
on it. "The bullet pierced the left rear side of his skull. According to the angle, the shooter was seated behind him, in the seats up there."
"He is a driver, John," smiles Sherlock, not dissatisfied to be able to calm down the doctor's enthusiasm and his visceral hatred of lawyers.
"Focus, Freud."
"We have other things to settle."
Lestrade is settled on the back-scene, next to the suspects. He's hardly said a word since he arrived with his team. For sure, he had to play his last cards to authorise this reconstruction and, given the face he makes, he doesn't seem to believe they'll end up finding something. John can't blame him, either. He politely smiles at the DI, receives nothing in reply, then hides his stretched mouth behind his closed fist and pleads a sudden cough. God, what a bloody day this is.
"As flatmates," quickly corrects John, who feels compelled to say something, a hand raised to be sure to catch everybody's attention in the room. "We live together,
“That's why you told your friend Lestrade and his team of happy troublemakers, to come and handcuff me? I saw you arriving but I only saw  one cab… Unless you told your
, which are grumbling like the rising thunder. If it has the merit to make Benjamin smile, John senses around him the rising tension. Lestrade is up on his feet, hands in his pockets, and he scrutinises the detective harshly. And if the witnesses are looking at each other, apparently bothered, the musicians bend toward each other to murmur words the doctor easily imagines are filled with awkwardness.
He takes advantage of Sinatra singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" more cheerfully than ever, and that Mrs. Hudson is tilted towards her fireplace to give advice to Lestrade, before murmuring:
"Because."
,” John answers and the fight is over.
"I don't really know what kind of man I am supposed to be any more," John laughs bitterly, rocking from one foot to the other.
"Ah, it's about time. Tell him that I've been kidnapped. No, he would be capable to think himself a real detective and to try to find me. Tell him that I died, we will save time. "
. His lips are half-opened and are letting escape an obscene breath which is mixing with the stuffy moaning of the oldest. There are some improbable locks stuck to the sweat on his forehead and his eyes are of a rare darkness while his cheekbones are a lovely red. Sherlock releases the base of his member, sinks deeper than ever into the groaning mouth and puts his hand on top of John's to verify that he's still holding the tie, which of course he is, even if the doctor understands that his flatmate is about to come.
, standing on top of the stairs, wrapped in his suit, a hand on the guardrail and armed with his most bestial smile.
Elisa puts back some of her curly hair behind her ear and hesitates a bit before she leans to kiss his cheek. She smells like lavender and even with the ridiculous amount of flowers in the room, John can smell it. She withdraws and John looks at Gregory on the other side of the bed, arms crossed on his chest and eyes dark with reproaches. He seems to barely holding back an anger that John perfectly understands.
"Benjamin, how many times did you attend the performances of the orchestra?"
John breathes a sigh of relief, half-amused, half-exhausted by this endless day and gets up on his feet to take the young patient to the door before stopping in front of the coat rack. His white hand - the evidence of iron deficiency - grabs a green parka and puts it on, before making the shock of a hair cut by his mother disappear under the hood.
"I know what you're going to say," John answers, slamming the door behind him before beginning to pace up and down in front of the kitchen table.
"Did I miss something? I mean, the last few days, you have been..."
“No unkind remark about the double bed?”
"Oh, I doubt that," Mycroft smiles over his steaming cup, looking the doctor straight in the eyes.
so much?"
10:55 PM
"Ah, yeah," answers John, sadly amused by this stupid memory. "In training we had to learn to defend ourselves against an attack with a blade. There was this guy from Yorkshire, erh, James Pilton, I think, who had to play the aggressor. He was terrorised by the idea of really hurting me. I had to push him so that he agreed to participate. I wanted to play the wise guy by pretending I didn't know when he was going to attack but he actually surprised me. I flunked my defense and his weapon slipped. Fortunately, he wasn't holding it firmly enough to hurt me, but it was enough for me to be the laughing stock of the camp..."
Sherlock didn't shrug. "You're looking for a flatmate and a solid job, and I have both."
"You let a complete stranger, one who's admitted to stalking you, take you home and tie you up." John's hole was loosening around his finger, and Sherlock worked in a second one, slowly, carefully, taking care to stretch, to not tear. To not brush the sensitive gland just inside. "You let said stranger tie you up until you were completely immobile. You have no escape routes. I could do anything I wanted to you," Sherlock said lightly, thrusting slowly with each word. He leaned in and dropped his head, breathing a slow, steady,
"You've seen me fight?" John asked, pushing his finger in and demanding the muscles to yield to his will.
Sherlock, conversely, had lost the miniscule tremors in his body as he'd sunk deeper into his role. He knelt tall behind John, looking over the man's shoulder as he wrapped John in his arms in a embrace made false by the fact that his fingers were too busy knotting the rope in even spaced segments to make it true. When a line of knotted rope halved John's chest, Sherlock gently eased John's knees, and thighs, apart, until he was satisfied. When Sherlock passed the rope through John's legs, the edge of his hand brushed John's heavy scrotum, and John let out a soft moan that made Sherlock's ignored erection twitch in his trousers.
"N-no," the boy stuttered, face and petite body going tight at the penetration.
"How do you feel, John?" Sherlock asked as he pulled a condom and a bottle of lube from his nightstand and dropped the condom onto the small cradle of John's belly. The lube he uncapped and poured into his palm before the bottle joined the foil wrapper.
He gave no warning before he tipped the boy onto his back and promptly poured some oil over the scar, watching it trail down over the boy's taint to his hole.
John groaned long and low and the sound slowly morphed into a "Nooo".
"You're a
"Alright, then let's get that thermometer in," John said, the tip of his penis a heavy weight against Sherlock's sphincter. He inhaled deep and the breath stuck in his throat as John started to push in, and John had to pause to remind him "Don't forget to breathe and relax, Sherlock. My thermometer will never fit if you don't."
you?" he sniped, temper shorted by too little sleep and too much subpar coffee over the last three days, judging by the state of his tie.
crime scenes, I'd suspect that it was you doing the following, Doctor," Sherlock replied, evading answering the truth with his own accusation, unfounded though it was. Not that the captain would know.
." John was so unsteady in his bindings, writhing as he was, that Sherlock could already see his flushed, sweating skin inflaming beneath the dark blue of the ropes.
The man looked positively dazed and relaxed, and the expression kept even as Sherlock slowly released him from his bindings in reverse order. When he finally had John sitting, cleaned, at the edge of his bed, wet cloth and dirty ropes flung into one corner, and condom in the bin, Sherlock crouched in front of him and didn't bother stopping himself from reverently tracing the rope marks his bindings had left behind.
"Please, what, John?" he prompted. When John could only beg wordlessly, apparently too desperate to properly convey his wants, Sherlock rephrased.
The crowd cheered and screamed as John stood tall and proud in the center of the coliseum, his opponents all laid out unconscious around him. He lifted his face to the sun, feeling it beat down on his bare skin, drying the blood trickling down his chest and shoulder blade and leg. It had been his tenth battle. And his tenth victory.
Sherlock
He stepped away just as Watson started to lean into him, and strode to the sidewalk, hailing one of the cabs lingering down the block. Watson looked dazed and wrong-footed when he finally turned around to look at Sherlock while the cab pulled up behind him. He opened the door and gestured inside. "Mine's closer."
His doctor slowed when he spotted Sherlock, the last rent boy on the sidewalk, and frowned, confusion clear on his face. Sherlock belatedly realized that it was possible Watson might recognize him, but nothing for it now. It might even help.
His doctor's- his
He'd barely touched the tip of his fingers to Sherlock's tiny cock before the eunuch's arse spasmed tightly around John's cock, pulling his orgasm from his testicles as surely as if John had stripped his cock himself. Unable to help himself, John sank his teeth back into that sweet flesh as pleasure swept through him, his hips rocking and pushing harshly forward to encourage those soft wet muscles to drain him of all his seed.
"So that's beer. Not bad," concludes the brunet with a surprised face.
They should have talked about it. They should talk about it. They
"Can I handcuff you?"
"It is great to see you here, I didn't know you two had kept in touch..."
! What do you... what are you... Oh my God, you're still worried, right? Everything's fine, Sherlock, I can handle it, okay?" he said shouting, the mere concept of living in the city and being surrounded by sleeping neighbours had slipped his mind.
can say so). John and Mycroft do not need to know nonetheless. Because what would John say? Would he be happy to learn that Sherlock has saved someone's life? Would he be amazed, once again, by not having discovered that his roommate had disappeared for 72 hours? Would he drownhim under hundreds of pedantic compliments for this smoothly handled case?
You're using caps, which is universally known to be a sign of anger. -SH
" Because I... "
Sherlock still looks at him for a few seconds, without any expression on his shaded face, before detaching himself from the body he leaves behind. With a pace as slow as it is confident, he crosses the deserted road where John feels so lonely that everything seems a bit wobbly. It's every particle of his body which seems to awaken at the sound of this word, everything in his person and everything that makes him who he is; a proud man, an ex-soldier, and a doctor. Of course he's brave, he has always been so and it has never been an option. So, left alone on the pavement, in the obscene silence buzzing in his ears, John wonders why, whispered by Sherlock's lips, it sounded so fake.
It takes him still one second before he looks at the scene again, on which the musicians speed up wrists and fingers, the audience's breath being as warm as the notes. The violins hurry and the flutes exhale even stronger than the ex-soldier who puts his elbows on the guardrail, like completely aspirated by this brilliant whirlwind. The apotheosis is cadenced by the cymbals, the bass drum and the conductor's chaotic gesture. The drumroll meddles with John's heartbeat and the last note has the magic force which urges any spectators on to their feet, standing to face to those musician they're applauding until their hands hurt.
"I am very well aware that you have a lot of respect for this kind of place but: I want you."
"... No," admits John, without really managing to hide the shame behind the confession.
"Open your mouth," orders Sherlock, and the obscenity of the thing doesn't hold in his words except in the way he says it out loud.
"Unless you'd like to talk about the way you undress?"
John’s smile worths all the most crude insults of his repertory.
"And may I see your visa?"
"Can I help you?"
liked music.
"Yes, but I'm allowed to, because it's
“No, not really,” Sherlock says, highly annoyed by this lack of action.
His back falls heavily on the mattress and bounces slightly. Wouldn't it be better to have a case that would prevent them from going to Skye? Shit, that wasn’t good. Sherlock was rubbing off on him.
“No, John; no, it's not true! It's a farce, a doppelganger, but it's not him!”
"First, both of you hit a roof of the East wing. I think you fainted at that moment because Moriarty tried to stand up but he stumbled and made the both of you fall."
"Craig Jennings, Anna Sanchez, Shery and Angie Walsh, Doris and Benjamin Cox, and finally, Jared Steele," presents Lestrade by throwing the file on his desk which John hastens to open.
The DI nods once and gets up from his seat to hold everyone's attention. He gives his usual speech at the beginning of a reconstruction, between legal and technical terms and specifies that everyone here has to follow Holmes' orders. Some heads nod to show their approval. That doesn't make the policemen blink but it makes Doris Cox, who still doesn't seem to carry the detective in her heart, sigh very loudly.
11:47 PM
. Lestrade doesn't speak any more either, he raises his eyes towards John, eyebrows so frowned they're making the wrinkles on his forehead more visible than ever. It takes him a few seconds of silence before concluding:
"All this time, all this time thinking about Sherrer..." Moriarty continues, pulling a face half-disgusted and half-disappointed. "While he was just an accessory... A game for you and me. You know that, don't you?"
"She wearing a polo-neck to hide a collar," concludes Sherlock, finishing his beer.
"I am sorry," Greg murmurs to Doris who is wearing her smile like John used to carry his weapon during the war.
"Is everything all right, John?" asks the detective neutrally.
10:10 PM
"We're here to listen to music, John. You know nothing about it because you think music is a side dish like sauce you add to your meat, but do you know there are actually people who, when they're listening to music, do
"If they were playing Liszt when Sherrer was killed, then why are you asking them to play Paganini?"
. It's just that, it's going to come out that you and I..."
10:07 PM
She sends them alternately a sincere smile and in the absurd silence, and it's John who feels obliged to answer:
“It’s hard to find somebody with whom you can really be yourself when you’re into that kind of lifestyle. For a Dom as for Sub, for that matter,” he smiles one last time before standing up to fill their cups in the kitchen. “It’s a matter of trust, really. The day Sherlock Holmes will trust someone, I think he’ll finally accept himself.”
"Your hobbies are q-quite p-particular."
The younger man jumps with surprise and lets his phone fell between his legs while his hand lies flat on the wheel to violently turn it. The car they brush past blows his horn to a point that they’re not sure their eardrums aren’t going to explode, and the truck that pulls up short behind them makes them realize their heads nearly got embedded into the dashboard.
How do you know? -SH
are doing this. It's not an experiment, nor a misunderstanding. They're not coming back drunk from any stupid parties. And it's not only the discovery of John's body to gain his trust. They're fucking and there's no unit of measure high enough to define the way John's feeling right now.
, that John started to hate from all his future-ex-soldier soul.
John removes his shoes without using his hands. His body goes along the headboard and he closes his eyes. Even when Sherlock doesn't come to talk to him at midnight about his latest findings on the case John seeks his voice.
John turns his head to his friend and asks very low:
“You're lying.”
John only sees his back, as he doesn't want to get too close. Moriarty only talks to Sherlock anyway; he only sees him and seems to live only for him. All of this has a bitter taste of déjà-vu which could be tedious if it wasn't dire. John even has to check twice the bottom of his pants isn't wet and that it's not a green parka that he's wearing. He wonders who Moriarty killed here, as everything he does is meticulously thought to be about his
"I saw on the planning that you're doing your blood donation tomorrow? Is Sophie going to take care of it? "
10:59 PM
"Hello," she replies with a paid lip smile.
John smiles over the perfumed steam of his hot drink, which he turns slowly to melt the sugar Sherlock thought of adding.
“Sherlock, John, I have to get back to Scotland Yard. Call me if you discover anything new about Moriarty, all right?” Lestrade says, standing next to them.
Sherlock doesn't answer, but frowns his nose in an absolutely incomprehensible grimace, while Benjamin kneels down near the model improvised to point at the cut silhouette on which the head of Sherrer was glued.
"John, how are you feeling?" he added as he had no answer.
"I know, I know, Sherlock, me too. Don't stop, don't stop, please," he murmurs, catching Sherlock's face between his fingers before touching his lips with his.
"Why not? It's obviously not Sheri, she's already preparing a sham marriage; she wouldn't have done something that would have put the attention on her. And then you said it yourself: Jennings wouldn't do anything that would prevent him from seeing his son. The two other people who would have been able to fire, otherwise, are..." but John doesn't finish his sentence because he just has to look right in front of him to point to one of the potential suspects.
Sherlock continues his way to the end of the room. He catches his padded seat before pulling it up to the bed, in front of John. He sits down and both men are finally facing each other.
John inhales and twists on the mattress where his body sinks further down, his eyelids shuddering and his fingers getting tense. The night before, he didn't stay alone and dazed more than 10 minutes before Molly came to get him. He then helped her make Andy - as a perfect British man, drunk and slumped on a bench- walk to a cab, then he went with them to the coroner's flat on Trinity Street before carrying the florist to the couch. Certainly something no one would have done besides him, least of all the man who is supposed to be his best friend, who came back to Baker Street exactly 47 minutes after him.
"He's hated it for so long... Anyway, I need you to question Doris and Benjamin Cox."
He slowly crosses his arms against his trunk without even winking. He isn't really sure yet if he likes his current position, the one that Sherlock dictated to him, but he cannot refrain from thinking that his flatmate acted that way to protect John from hearing something that wouldn't please him. Nevertheless, the doctor is persuaded that he could face it, he knows to be strong. As to knowing if he wants to face it, nothing is less certain.
"Nope. So, we meet with Lestrade at 10 at Sherrrer's place, okay, fine, always a great pleasure to search a dead man's house."
11:08 PM
“Lestrade,” he adds.
With every new step, the doctor believes that Sherlock's going to stop, in vain. Sherlock is getting closer and closer, until they find the same awkward closeness of the pavement in front of Sherrer's place. There is no sun and John wonders what will be the excuse of his flatmate this time, but the youngest one says nothing. Delicately, he raises his hands and it's obvious he takes his time to give John time to step backward, to shout or to push him away, maybe. But John does not move, because for once in his life - only
He turns his head and sees the detective is already looking at him. He answers his smile with his own.
"No."
John, I know you don't want to talk about your family but is your wife's name Mary Watson? -SH
“To the Royal Observatory.”
"I thought you had more humor than that," the DI smiles widely, crushing his cigarette end on the ground.
His knees may be on the ground, but his spirit evaporates. With a feverish body, it's with even more strength that he hangs on to Sherlock's hips. Blindly, he feels his flatmate bending forward, squeezing the nape of his neck with an obvious possessiveness before he growls:
"What?"
John would like them to do a show of hands to decide if they should keep talking about Apple products battery life or to shoot each other, but in the end he's practically sure he'd be in minority so he prefers to keep his mouth shut.
The heart of the doctor misses a beat. He waves at Sherlock to make him stay silent. There's always this one phone call which we dread, the one which rings in the middle of the night and pulls us out of our life to plunge us into a nightmare of which we had never imagined the existence of. For John, the phone call arrives at 11:02 am.
"Why I'm losing my mind? John, do you know how long I've been protecting Sherlock?
I'm looking for a beta for the last (4) chapters of this story! If it's something you might be interested in helping me with, you can drop a comment or contact me on my Tumblr (link on my profile page). Thanks!
John frowns and turns his head to his flatmate but bloody of course Sherlock hadn’t take his gun and hadn’t tell anyone, as usual, unless this time they're going to regret it, he knows it.
"He works at Stanford & Wells, it is two steps away."
“I have a very reasonable size.”
That doesn't even seem to faze Sherlock who does nothing to prevent him from doing so, but who removes the crop out of his shirt to set it on the desk to his left before ordering:
"Very subtle," he smiles to Mycroft, who is on his feet in the middle of the empty warehouse.
"I know," John laughs heartedly to ease the tension.
He opens his eyes wide, blushes in shame with the same tint as his favorite armchair and automatically leaves the computer to put his hands between his legs, but he sees his perfectly closed jeans - and worse, the
"Hey..." he smiles to them, crashing his thumb against the remote control to raise the backrest of his bed.
"I'm kidding."
"No," he smiles, putting a hand on the guardrail, ready to take refuge on the first floor to hide from the remonstrance of this mother who's not even his.
"What are you reproaching me for exactly?" asks the doctor, raising his voice, always feeling terribly awkward when Sherlock states the exact composition of his day without any decency - no wonder John carefully avoids the living-room the morning following his
"It was easier to reserve that way with Royal Concert Hall," she answers without any emotion in her voice.
?" he almost grumbles, pointing at them alternately.
"Listen Elisa, I have to go. What? Ah, yes, well Tuesday I suppose."
"Eh? Oh, no, don't worry. I was just wondering if they were hiring at Marie Stopes Central..."
"Boys, can someone go fetch another champagne bottle in the cellar please?" asks Mrs. Hudson, finishing the second bottle of the evening.
The brown haired man, starting to drink his tea too, had a micro, absolutely-not-amused smile, his piercing gaze never leaving his friend in front of him.
"The sex. Well, sex will be a plus, as it is not something that we used to do before."
If he should only speak in euphemism, John would say that the last three days in 221B were not very easy to manage. He would say that he thought boredom was Sherlock Holmes' worst enemy, but that's only because he never saw him walking along impatience. They barely exchanged five words and slept in their own bedrooms, even if their bodies touched more than once when meeting in the corridor or in front of the teapot. That was enough for John, who didn't want to add any more pressure on both of their lives.
"She had a bad fall, but her vital diagnosis is not compromised; fracture of the fibula with a small movement which we reduced with a fixed immobilisation. She just came back from the recovery room and as you are the person to contact according to her insurance..."
To answer your question, when I'm touching myself, I'm using my imagination. -J
Mycroft Holmes.
"I prefer when you send me texts.”
"... That you didn't tell me before," he ends, swallowing heavily.
"That's what a lot of people think, right?"
"How's the rest of the group?"
"You see, it's exactly to avoid this kind of awkwardness that I didn't want Sherlock to get involved in it."
"We're done," retorts Sherlock by coming to shake her hand and before she closes the front door behind them, he turns around to add, "I found that the cello player in the third row was particularly bad."
"Well, it seems that everybody agrees in saying that the things I like are either unethical, illegal, addictive, or wear hideous jumpers. Even if the last two can easily be mistaken. And you can put back the crop, John - unless you like the contact of the leather in your hand?"
“It's your phone that rang. And this time I'm the one deciding to take it from your pocket.”
"How is the Nutcracker tour going?" suddenly asks the detective, facing the young woman.
, every time the neighbors were giving Harry a tangible look of disapproval, every time the books and movies he watched showed him the omnipresence of the heterosexual frame in which John never blossomed.
"That's odd... Well, yes, I slept well, even if I do not know the reason."
The ex-soldier goes immediately out of his thoughts and jumps at the sound of the word. He first looks at Sherlock, who smiles, though it's not him who asked the question but Mrs. Hudson, on the other side of the room.
"Remove your shirt," openly starts Sherlock, and this time John knows that they eventually jumped into a void.
"You all believe I'm guilty," the man spits when Sally's inquisitive eyes disappear behind the door. "I know that I shouldn't have left after the concert but I didn't kill this man. If I had really killed him, do you think that I would have told you the day I was coming back to London? And then, do you think that I would have returned?"
Combat, John is used to it. He fought next to twenty-year-old young men, against an enemy who he had never quite seen the outlines of but whom he had smelt the blood of. He even grew up with an alcoholic father and a sister who was a fan of Madonna; for sure, John's familiar with battlefields. Still, today everything is harder than what he crossed in his life. Maybe it's the old age, the fatigue, or both combined, but his shoulders don't seem as solid as before. And the prospect is harrowing
—Sherl..."
John's mouth closes but this time it's not lumpy to be filled with undefinable pain. Sherlock lies down against him, he's to tall, his body awkwardly curls up and he rests his hand on John's chest covered with the same blue sheet we can see in all the hospitals around the world.
"Useless detail," concludes Sherlock with a wave of a hand before getting up.
I can even swear it. -J
Are you mad at me for last time? -J
The afternoon, Sherlock brings a huge fbouquet because
“Wait, that’s why he uses the wrong name anytime he sees you? It’s voluntary?”
that are wandering in his damn skull, but he's quickly stopped by a voice as soft as a breeze.
John raises his eyes and shivers while the crop touches his face. He feels the leather rubbing his shaved cheek up to the sensitive part of his jaw, before returning back to his lips. The black tip pats them slowly in repetitive gestures and, while John's tongue presses the back of his teeth, he feels the pressure of the crop on his lower lip. He opens his mouth without any resistance, maybe wider than Sherlock would have imagined because his eyebrows raise in surprise.
“Ah, Doctor…” Moriarty continues, finally noticing  his presence. He pulls a face, snaps his tongue against his palate as if he was staring at a rotting carcass and explains, “in life, there are certain things you can't control. For everything else, there's Moriarty. I was there for Sherrer and I'll be there for many more people.”
"Okay, it's too late for bullshit but I want your damn arses tomorrow at 9A.M in my office, are we clear?"
"John, did you at least listen to me?"
"No, thank you," answers Sherlock, eyes already scrutinising everything around them in the lounge where they are led.
John nods, opening his eyes wide, and leaps to his feet, completely excited at the idea of going back to bed in his sheets which must still be hot. They still haven't found the murderer and that leaves dramatic questions, but they let themselves shamelessly carry by the temporary shiver to have at least settled a mystery, so minor it is. Sherlock, standing next to the coat rack, gives him his jacket, talking to the suspect who is still seated:
John bought a hot-dog and some chips at the small restaurant from around there, and Sherlock's fingers never stopped stealing those pieces of overly salted potatoes. John always pretended not to see it. Sherlock liked it. He still has his hand full of salt when he takes his mobile out of his pocket. The vibration came from a text sent by Lestrade, but he only sees one thing.
"Because he understood. Because he could have died when we fell but he was alive for a few seconds more and he understood that me and you, that we..."
"Come in," and this time he doesn't murmur.
"Read that," the detective imposes, putting a letter in his hands.
"But Gra-Gregory!" called Sherlock, stopping right away by the oldest man's forefinger, raised like a threat between their two faces.
Just surfing the web. You? -J
Because, yes, Sherlock Holmes is incapable of judging a hotel or B&B by its decoration, and even the receptionist’s clothing choice, but he knows more than anything the true strength of this place, the beauty of those mountains encircled by vast lakes as calm as they are gloomy. Everything else is so pointless.
“I got shot,” he replies in an exaggerate obviousness, as if those things were only too common – but that is almost the case and his irony falls flat.
"Sherlock?"
John pinches his lip and pushes his finger on the plastic button on his left. The window closes gently and with it fresh air sweeps the smell of cigarette which disappears with laziness. Of course, Sherlock has not smoked for months and he holds on tight -like a pitbull tied to the neck of his favorite poodle. The fact remains that the doctor wants to avoid unnecessary temptation. Greg gave up; he will be the only one.
They get up both of a jump. The youngest man closes the computer without waiting, dusts his jacket, and they both go to the antipodes of the room. It's not really surprising that Mrs. Hudson calls them "my boys", they are not more mature than teenagers when they act like this.
"Down the hall."
"Let's make it more pleasant, then," the detective proposes with a slightly lower voice.
"John!" cries out the woman, jumping in surprise, tightening up the dirty duster against her pullover. "Where have you been? I went upstairs to bring you some scones and Sherlock told me you went out!"
, for being the best beta I could ever imagined.
"On a scale from 1 to 5, how much do you estimate you want to test your tolerance to pain?"
, which was not very funny but he laughed anyway. Then he asked me if I suffered too much in the back of the truck and whispered very loudly he was hoping I did, then he got closer to me and he..." pinching his lips together, he smiled for one second and started looking at Sherlock again. "Buttoned up my parka. So that I '

, like a cane. And then the steps resound on the landing and the
"I'm making a reconstruction, John," he grumbles between his squeezed teeth.
"She is completely controlled by appearances."
They briefly shake their heads while she wipes her tears with dignity and a trembling hand and breathes to take back her calm.
"Yes, she's the one who did it the last time."
"You know what I'm dreaming of? That we enter the interrogation room and that we find him trembling, sweaty, and that it's obvious that it's him who shot Sherrer."
"Could we..."
Sherlock moves their chests closer and joins his second hand with the first one while insistently cherishing the pectoral muscles of the ex-soldier. He brushes the fair hairs before going back up along the neck, which he surrounds with a soft hand. He bends, nibbles the chin, and slides his teeth along the jaw before biting, hardly one second. John closes his eyes and the shivers rising along his back confirm to him that even in his possessiveness, Sherlock is the embodiment of sophistication. He reopens his eyes just in time to see the musician's long white hands sliding on his arms, which they test the power of in two apparently convincing pressures (because Sherlock's only wearing his boxers after all). The fingers continue their inspection up to the wrists they surround with a perceptible restraint and Sherlock admits in a breath:
"On your knees," he finally imposes in a voice that is far too delicate.
Enjoy your reading and please review; I'd love to hear from you, dear readers :)
"Ah, you're watching this one."
It's Saturday, I'm alone at my home, I have Internet... -J
"Hello, I'm John Watson," he comes to greet them with a tilt of the head, before taking support awkwardly against a shelf because no more chairs are free in the room.
John's eyes roll with despondency.
"People are never satisfied."
"Yes," he moans as he feels Sherlock's finger pressing between his legs until the first phalanx enters in him.
"What?"
"Stay with me."
I went by the morgue. Molly told me about it. She seems to like you. -J
“You can sleep next to me.”
"Psychological torture - to make you feel useless."
"I don't want any help!" he roars and that has the effect of a slap from Clara, who moves back instinctively.
“Did you choose it because of their sodding bathtub length?!”
"Not yet," mutters Mrs. Hudson, looking away. If it has the merit to make Molly laugh, that makes the doctor jump up.
John nods clumsily while he unbuttons his shirt in gestures he would want to be less fragile. He doesn't wear a tank top now that the temperatures are acceptable and he doesn't have the stupid envy to hide behind fabrics and excuses anymore anyway. He dances from one knee to the other to remove his jeans and boxers and doesn't mind that he's not very graceful right now because there's something going on in this living-room that has stopped his blood from flowing to his brain anymore and has sent it down to his cock. And it's almost awkward that he's already this hard while nothing has really happened yet, but
"... Yeah," responds John, almost sulking, who doesn't even know how his roommate can possibly know that. "Do you know exactly when Steele returns?"
. They switched off all the lights, until they are only enlightened by the screen of the small television, and while Sherlock's fist is put against the prominence of his cheekbone, John sees in this scene printed in chiaroscuro a sufficient reason to speak:
They get dressed in the staircase and go out in the small yard behind Mrs. Hudson's kitchen. Lestrade offers a cigarette to his friend, who politely refuses with a shake of his head. Even if he doesn't smoke, the cold makes his mouth produce a thick smoke anyway.
"No," the detective answers very honestly, and it's officially the most bloody awful day of their lives.
I'm searching but I have no idea. -J
On his right, seated on the ambulance's ledge, John was following with his blue gaze a pen a doctor was moving from right to left. Sherlock, as for him, accepted the blanket on his shoulders at least.
"Of course we don't..." the soldier mutters as he raises his eyebrows, as if stating an obvious fact, before suddenly realising: "Wait, what does that mean? You're not using them?"
"John Watson is a miracle," Sherlock answers as if it's absolutely obvious.
"Luljette Fetch... Fech..."
I AM NOT MAD. -J
11:05 PM
John took the wheel again, but this time Sherlock didn't say anything, he just opened his lips to indicate the road. They cross the land at full throttle; the doctor forgot about the main-road speed limit. They see dead trees and quite lakes; the car climbs up and down in this valley made of mounts and plains. The sun is lazy; it's there, wrapping them up, but doesn't warm them. Outlandish impressions, rocks and stones overhang some shallow bushes, mountains encircle and threaten them, yet John has never seen something that beautiful. All he knows about England are London and the southern beaches, covert by a few brave British. In the north, however, hides a treasure he's not sure he'll get over one day.
"Even so! You
The detective hardly wrinkles his eyes, glances entirely at John before informing him with a quiet voice:
“What's wrong with you? You're sulking because I took the wheel? You were texting while driving on the highway, Sherlock. You can't blame me for making both of us stay alive.”
"Staging. Complete. Total," concludes the detective before lowering his finger and advancing on the edge of the scene, closely followed by his flatmate. "Sherrer staged his own death. He's making fun of us. Since the beginning."
to get my son back. He don't feel good with her, y' know? Eleonora, she shouts all the time and since she started datin' her cook, she takes even less care of Tim. He has to stay in remedial courses till 19 hours even though she don't work, and I told the judge that I could take care of Tim at the end of school, my boss agrees, but the judge said no. She had a better lawyer than me. They said I were stupid and that I wouldn't know how to take care of the kid. I want to show 'em that I'm not dumb. This is why I looked for a job here. Mister Stanford, he's kind and even if I'll never have the money to pay him, I want to do a good job for him so that he'll agree to help to get Tim back."
09:05 AM
last name to emphasise his deductions. John didn't answer anything - of course, what can you reply to that? - he just nod his head once, a mechanical inheritance of his military training, to prove he understood, then they left without a word up to the mortuary where Sherlock proceeded to inspect Sherrer' body for himself, in spite of the advanced examination which Molly Hooper had already made under the pressure of Scotland Yard and
Sherlock unbuttons his suit jacket vest and gives away a delighted smile which provokes the doctor right the opposite.
They're alone here, of course, but to murmur gives John the illusion they're alone in the world. If they raise their voice, the doctor is afraid someone would hear them and burst this bubble in which they have taken refuge, and in which John refuses to be something else other than himself.
He didn't even pause to take in the sight before he was binding John's calves to his thighs in the frog tie, and by the time he was tying John's legs apart with more ropes leading up to the suspension, John's cock had filled out once more. It only took Sherlock one look at the picture John made, bound and spread, hole exposed to his gaze, for Sherlock's cock to stiffen once more. The whole tableau was only made more arousing when a flush spread down John's chest under Sherlock's watchful eyes.
"Oh, there's something I want from you," Sherlock said vaguely, sliding his eyes down the man's body, wondering what wonders were hidden beneath.
He moved his feet as far apart as they would go on the bed, until he was lying like a starfish, naked and stretched out, on top of his sheets. The duvet had already been pushed to the floor, "to keep from getting dirty," John had reminded him.
"Are you ready to get your temperature checked?" John asked, something strange to his smile, like always.
Sherlock stared at him as he hooked the fingers of one hand in the ropes over John's belly, and wrapped the other hand around the base of John's cock, ignoring the strangled sound that John produced at the touch. Without breaking eye contact, he tugged John towards him at the same time as he thrust forward.
Sherlock layered one forearm over the other, keeping the ushiro takatekote posture steady by gripping John's elbows and holding them in place.
"No," the boy answered shortly, as if annoyed, which only served to amuse John more.
The curve of Sherlock's arse was lush for a boy so young and fit easily into John's hand. Arousal curled tight in John's groin as he squeezed the flesh in time with his thrusts, easily lifting the slight weight of his catamite and holding it up at the hips, keeping them at just the right height so as not to disrupt the rhythm he was fucking into the tight hole as he fell forward. John caught himself with his other hand above the boy's head, which didn't even come to his shoulder. In fact, the body below his was so slight and small that John doubted that even the gods above could see Sherlock, covered as he was by John's muscular bulk except for where pale legs spasmed around the width of John's waist.
Sherlock nodded, but John was no longer looking at him. Instead, his eyes were fixed on the lube he was pouring onto his fingers, working between them to warm up the cold liquid. Still, Sherlock jumped when John's wet fingers traced his sphincter, massaging the muscle until the tip of John's finger sunk in.
The cry John let loose was likely loud enough to wake Mrs Hudson, but Sherlock ignored him and the pulsing cock in his grip and set up a harsh, furious rhythm. He didn't slow or pause - the foreplay had taken so long and they were both so hard that even though he'd wanted to take this first time slow, he couldn't. Not any more.
Truly not expected.
I like you. -SH
This is a case like any other: A body in a morgue to see, and nothing more. At least, John tries to convince himself of this. He would have given anything to stay in Baker Street during this awful February, bitten by the driest winter. It doesn't snow -at least, that's something- but he knows Scotland suffers from a far more impetuous cold. The idea of going over there in the Vauxhall Astra is not very pleasant. He will get through, though. He lived through much worse. As for Sherlock, nothing is less certain.
Molly had insisted over the telephone that the party was casual, but it seems like all Sherlock Holmes can do when it comes to coolness is a bespoken suit and a dark blue shirt. Maybe it's to compensate for it that John put on a simple white one.
"Is something wrong?" asks John, eyebrows furrowed.
But Sherlock doesn't even seem to hear him as he already takes support on Jennings' head with his hand before coming to sit down next to him. John takes advantage of it to look at the father whom he didn't even salute. The man has a terrible look, a pale complexion and glassy eyes. Of course, he remembers it now, Jennings began a hunger strike to get back guardianship of his son. Even if Sherlock had presented the thing as a completely funny act, to see him so physically decreased saddens John more than he cares to admit. The detective sticks his cheek next to the badly shaved one and eventually pushes the man away to take his place to look at the scene from his point of view. Jennings doesn't say a thing and sighs hard, but that makes Doris burst, her who finally shouts:
"No."
"Thus, what, are you saying we need a woman here?" the doctor smiles, raising an eyebrow.
It gives him a blow in the stomach, discreet but real, when he sees a man hidden in a long grey coat, a hat way too big on his head. The man has his hands in his pockets and his static presence between the children's laughter and the parents, in a hurry because they are double-parked, is terrible.
"Your tank top now."
"Where are the flatmates?"
"I had to see Sherrer's bedroom again!" the detective finally answers, struggling as much as he can.
"I don't..." starts John, his cheeks as red as he's uncomfortable, but Sherlock doesn't seem to notice him as he's already turned his head to look at the young woman again.
"Creepy."
“Because if knows and doesn’t kill me himself, Mycroft will by learning it’s I who teached his brother to use a riding crop. But don’t judge Sherlock, okay? Despite everything I can say… he’s a good guy, you know.”
;) -J
"I'm not going to leave him. Did you speak to him? Do you at least know where he lived, what he went through to get to the point where he's at today?" she moans, looking at them one after the other.
"And what happened yesterday with Elisa?"
"And in your Mind Palace there are also videotapes constituting the back-stage?" asks John, an amazed smile on his lips.
“I slightly doubt that,” the detective adds and that makes the psychopath bursts out a laugh.
"But, John, you're not like me."
"You asked me to not touch you," he explains by raising a shoulder, before getting up slowly.
Jennings shakes his head with difficulty by pushing his rag into his back pocket before leaning against the bonnet of the sedan.
"No."
The silence settled between them like a third guest of whom they didn't dare to interrupt, and both of them, British as always, finished their tea before it got cold. His eyelids full of a fictive sand, John spread his legs in front of him, turning his neck on its side before getting up on his feet with his cup now empty in his right hand.
"We banish straightaway any extreme act. No blood, no permanent marking."
Sherlock also looks at him, eyes harpooning him without any pity.
01:22 AM
"Months, it's been months that you're chasing after a murderer who was in the same room as you! What's going on with you, Sherlock, why can't you solve the case?" he roars, shaking the detective of whom he crushes the throat a bit more without hearing the doctor.
"You are so brave, John Watson."
09:05 AM
"And what about you Sherlock, why is your bed so big? To welcome your numerous conquests?" he laughs in return before realising the incongruity of the conversation.
"Are we really going to spend the evening talking about the way I dress?" smiles John leaned over his flatmate.
“What do you think of my
"That's why I was over there," says Hendrik all of a sudden, raising his finger like a student who wants to take the floor. "I am a head carpenter for the company and we were preparing the stage in Brussels when I heard about... Philipp."
They stand and face each other for the first time on this scene of the Royal Festival Hall, before understanding with the same voice:
"Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock... Look at us!
,' then forget it."
It's the noise of a lock which has been forced. Sherlock gets up with a feline speed and catches John's weapon in the pocket of his coat before the doctor has time to straighten up on at least his elbows. There is something terrible about seeing Sherlock with a weapon and it makes John nauseous; it's because the last time it happened, it stank of chlorine and there was a red point which slid like a snake over the detective's shirt.
"I forget Sherrer. I know the life of all these idiots but I don't even know the life of Philipp Sherrer."
"Maybe she wanted us to accuse her future brother-in-law, or at least, who, we found out through investigating doesn't have English citizenship... It's a bit extreme but she could have..."
Their fingers are brushing each other and while the soldier breathes in, persuaded that they're going to become entangled (a gesture he's always found a nameless intimacy in), he sees his flatmate's continuing their path before closing with delicacy around his own wrist. He smiles, an actor in the front row of a reversal of situation of a delicious elegance, and opens his mouth but no sound comes out of it. He plays a bit with his jaw before raising his eyes towards his friend:
’ without asking you the question in return. Does it surprise you that I'm talking about that, Sherlock?” he asks, looking at him behind his shoulder. “You know, I'm a philanthrope, I like when everything is going fine between everyone. But I hate it when it's not happening the way I predict it would. It's a matter of logic: I'm smarter than you all so it's normal that you follow what I ordered,” he says with a disconcerting certitude. “I immediately understood Philipp Sherrer’s potential. He was so lonely, it was beautiful to see. And he kept talking and talking and no one was listening. I ended up paying him a drink and
"Yeah, been there, done that," confirms John with a light grimace, moving his shoulder to emphasise his words.
"Denosa! Liszt!
He catches his coat which he puts on without waiting and greets his flatmate before disappearing behind the front door. John sighs noisily and tidies up the room without really believing that it would change something, before grabbing his blanket which he takes back to his bedroom.
The smile John imposes on his lips hurts him so much it's all his self-esteem that seems to crack open under the effort.
He lowers his head and sees the phone at his roommate's feet. Does he have any idea in which position John will have to bend himself to be able to do so? He hopes not.
"There, it's the m-movie I told you about."
“You don't know what it’s like to have awful things said about you.” Sherlock clenches his lips, stares at the ceiling, and thinks out loud.
Thank you so much ladies, you ARE the best!
here,” Sherlock decreets with a hard voice.
"Singing recital," John corrects, sighing.
??!! John ???! -SH
Also, I don't have a beta anymore on this story so I'm sorry in advance for the possible mistakes!
So now, here I am, discouraged by publishing in English on FanFiction. To put it in another way: I feel like a waitress, bringing some of you a meal that I made with all my heart, I see some of you eat it, then some of you leave, without saying anything (alright, most of you). And sadly, I can't do that anymore. So from now on I'll only publish on AO3 when it comes to English writings. I will at least finish So Brave, So Quiet, because the story needs an end.
It was a dirty, low blow; how Sherlock used his first
The blue crystalline eyes raise from the leather prison of the doctors' fingers up to his face, and it's as if John burned himself. He jumps, realising the ambiguity of his gesture, and puts the crop up awkwardly on the shelf to his left. He puts it up so badly, though, that it brings down the ashtray he knows is always filled, and he doesn't touch it anymore. Then he disappears into the kitchen where the kettle is finally ready. He takes out three cups, some sugar and milk, also, as well as three teaspoons and paper towels; in brief, so many useless accessories which only have the purpose of producing the maximum amount of noise to put up a front. It's with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker that he infuses the tea ball in each of the cups, eyes scrutinising the water coloring to a dark brown. When he returns to the lounge, the handles of the three cups hanging awkwardly at the end of his fingers, he finds Sherlock and Benjamin still sitting on the floor.
"What?" John asks, getting out of his thoughts.
His head on the armrest, feet exceeding from the other half of the sofa, Sherlock examines the crack-free ceiling above him. The shared living-room has no charm, even he can testify to that. Why would you have a television this big and a sofa this small? It's beyond belief. He looks at the chess game on his left and thinks he can bring it back to the bedroom as an excuse to John for his attitude.
"They're sleeping together," answers Sherlock, raising a shoulder.
"I'm working, John, I'm working and that's it!"
, and the other which is openly laughing at him all the way to his little finger raised by the very British education he received.
! Does anyone remember in which position he was before the bass player decided to be the useless hero?"
"Why?"
It's because the thought of cracking his back by dint of bending to tidy up all the pieces of scattered cardboards, clipping, and ties isn't really exciting that John answers unscrupulously:
“Stop rolling your eyes.”
"Mh?"
10:20 PM
John stands up and stands still, nude in the middle of his bedroom. He knows why his flatmate doesn't take a step forward, he knows that he's missing something that Sherlock's been waiting for from day one. And John doesn't have any more reasons to wait, either.
"Wait a minute... It's been months that I ask you, for example, to stop touching my computer and you're not listening to a single word. Now, I just have to say
"Yes, he didn't like the sofa thing at all."
Merry Christmas, John. -SH
"Well, we're going to try to reach it slowly, aren't we, Sherlock?" John warns by raising his eyebrows, but that doesn't make the detective react. Instead he's climbing on the sofa to put his face in front of papers hung higher than the rest of them.
“Sherlock, it's...”
The doctor gives an ironic laugh and puts a hand on his face but Sherlock is really serious. Then he asks, bewildered:
"What are you doing here?"
John opens his eyes wide and turns his head to Sherlock, who is suddenly buttoning his coat, as if extremely pressed to leave.
"Not at all, I use it for particular experiments, let's say..."
Are you working on a case today? -J
Steele once nods and smiles at the young woman before going back up to his place. And this time it's obvious, John knows what changed: they fell in love.
"You should go back to your place, Steele, Sherlock will be here any minute."
"And she's kind of cute," adds Mark in a knowing wink.
They turn their heads at the same time and the desire that is burning inside of them is gone from their pupils. They nod and John smiles more than ever:
09:05 AM
At Baker Street where a
They look at each other and don't speak because there're so many things to say that they don't know which words to use. Sherlock finds the solution as he leans forward and rests his lips against John's. When was the last time they kissed? Too long. That's what matter:
It's on the fourteenth floor of King’s College Hospital, against Sherlock's lips, that from that night on, John Watson doesn't
“No,” he answers with an outraged laugh.
"There is nothing between Elisa and I. I already told you, having a girlfriend is not really... my area."
He just has time to see Sherlock's eyes heightening in their orbits before he turns around to face the window, and begins a series of long notes, doubtless improvised, to verify that he tuned his instrument correctly. John slows down his gestures, by-passes his armchair on which he sits down. Between being alone with spare time and being able to listen to Sherlock, his bad mood and his creaking violin, it's not really useful anymore to pretend the first solution really holds the weight of the comparison. He rests his arms against the stuffed armrests, blocks his mouth in a discreet smile and sometimes closes his eyes when Sherlock improvises an oriental melody.
“You're lying, and I know you're lying because you stopped looking at me by turning your head, and you have this stupid laugh you feel obliged to regurgitate when you feel ill at ease.”
," and this time, it's an order.
I'm just a doctor. -J
It's not only shock, it's also a monumental slap. There's also a certain discomfort which pins down John, because not only has he never, oh never, talked about sexuality with Sherlock Holmes, he's talked even less about BDSM. He slightly opens his lips, searches for something that he can say in the ocean of words like
John bursts into laughter and turns his back on the detective before walking to the cupboard with the used catch: the one where they're accumulating tea they're always buying in a large number. He barely hesitates and finally takes the first one in front of him - a Russian mix of black tea from China and India - and continues:
"I only live to see you try."
"Even those two people," confirms the younger one with a sign of the head.
10:26 PM
Why do men always feel obligated to think another man's gay if he doesn't like a woman with an oversized chest? John already dated women with short hair and a bust loose in an A cup bra. She remained a woman, and some of them were much more attractive to him than what the society imposes as a beauty ideal.
which made him understand, in a most crappy way, that all of this is bullshit. It made him understand that this control he's imposing on his life, with the same sourness of a rope you put on an unfortunate's neck, will never save him.
The face is the same, undeniably, but all of it looks like an empty shell, a bottomless pit that gives John vertigo. He puts his hand on his face, rubs it, and breathes with difficulty. So here they are, and the police were right, and nothing has ever been so tough. There are tears that are trying to flow but the hardness is so big that all his body refuses any gesture, any expression. His reflexes that got him back from Afghanistan push him to worry about the only thing that really matters:
There is a few seconds of hesitation and John looks at them alternately, not sure that they're speaking about the same person, but when he sees the discreet smile of Sherlock, he explodes in laughter, followed by his two friends. They need to release the pressure and they do nothing to calm themselves, and when the detective decides it's time to go he goes back to the bedroom to get his coat. John starts tidying up the mess they've made and when he feels Lestrate entering in his turn, he understands it might not have been the best idea to let him do so:
Are you being ironic? -SH
John lightly shakes his head and smiles, and Sherlock can only do the same. There's something unique happening in the living room of 221B this morning and John knows why: for the first time, he feels that Sherlock and he are on the same wavelength. Together.
Sherlock doesn't comment those details. Instead he traces a path between the blond hair. John understands that even his skull must be strewn by wounds.
will put the condom on me. That would please you, right? Sweet, perfect doctor that you are. If that can still give you the illusion that you're the one in charge... Maybe you hope that you'll be able to take advantage of the darkness, to tell me that you can't put it on me, but don't you worry about that. When I'll touch you, I'll leave the lights on. Every. Single. One. It is cute, the way you switch off the lamps of your bedroom when you're bringing...
09:05 AM
They're judging each other from the ends of their eyelashes, they aren't using their mouths, to sound out the other one. John believes they're evolving in a very official silence but it's because he doesn't hear James Stewart's voice any more.
The detective has a smile and it's only because his mouth is stuck on his skin that John can feel it, and answers tenderly:
," he repeats between his teeth, with a crazy gaze, "Me and you, we're the same. So far away from the rest of them," he screams this time, pointing at the city, miles away from where they're standing. "Because we're superior to them. We control them. We dominate them. So, how did you not get sooner that all of this was about me? Only me? Wasn't I good enough for you anymore?"
"You... mh... Are you alright?" John asks withou knowing if they should talk about it or pretend nothing happened.
"Well, we are flatmates, as you may know," he answers with more animosity than he wants to let appear.
face is efficient.
"John!" called his friend, completely shocked by his gesture.
Incidentally, she is waiting for him on the front steps. Arms open, she welcomes him in an embrace,  being careful of his injury, and warmly pecks him on the cheeks before leading him to the living-room on the first floor. She rages on and on about road hogs, since Lestrade told her that John got run over, surprised he didn’t stay longer at the hospital. But he hardly listens to her and asks, as he gazes towards the two empty armchairs by the fireplace:
The detective lets go of the bitten lip, licks his own and doesn’t stop staring at John while he answers their landlady, raising his voice.
, Sherlock. It's always about you," said the ex-soldier smiling, slowly drinking his burning tea.
His body tilted over the German newspapers from 1987 and the typewriter, John hangs his look of a terrible grey to the crystalline blue one
This time, Moriarty puts his hands on Sherlock's chest, he's looking at him with his wet eyes but when he understands he won't get any answers, he starts to smile and nods before he withdraws and takes out of his jacket a Beretta he's pointing at the detective's head.
“Yeah, I know. Figure of speech.”
, let's be honest, he preferred that to exploding all guts out because of a fucking parka deflagration.
"Would you let me tie your wrists?" he asks with a soft voice. Mesmerizing, almost.
I'm touching myself, thinking about you -J
"Great," he smiles and it's clear with this false grin that he didn't listen to a thing that his friend said.
"What happened between you and Elisa?"
Benjamin Cox? Too...
"No, don't. I have to go to see her... You... Well... I have to go," he ends with a firm voice, hand already raised to stop a taxi.
Sherlock, standing next to the window, scrutinizes an indistinct point in the street, which is undoubtedly highly interesting seeing as he didn't even deign to turn his head when Gregory's assistant came to greet them. In the folder, which John reads scrupulously, there are photocopies of the reserved seats with the names stated by the DI and some quite terribly sad passport photos. Not as if anybody had ever looked good in a passport photo.
“Are you going to leave me here?” asks the freaked out voice, deep as a tenor's.
Congratulations for the case of the stolen jewelry. I saw you on TV. -J
"Why are your knuckles red?"
No, I don't. -SH
', with a stupid hope to see if Lestrade would be mentioned but without surprise, he only reads his own name. He then tries '
"Even if I prefer when nobody g-gets k-killed during my favorite tune," he ends with a shrug and this time, John gives a real laugh which relaxes the tense atmosphere of the room.
“Where's the body?”
? He entered this private and much closed space and now John's air is hitting Sherlock's chin. It is primitive, somehow visceral. And so terribly traitor, because John breathes messily...
"Did you hear that, John? The man takes care of flowers," smiles Sherlock to his friend, who's already rolling his eyes.
"I'll come with you."
He has the most remarkable intelligence on the West, East, South and North coast, and here he is driving Lestrade's car across the country, suffocated by the cold smell of cigarette and constant glances from his roommate. Oh sure,
John smiles.
," the doctor expires, feeling his shoulders relaxing all at once.
John nods once before turning around and running up to the stairs. He's not cold, but he's not warm, either. It's doesn't matter that he's running naked in the common areas because what matters is the look of Sherlock, Sherlock's hands, what Sherlock is giving him at the moment. He pushes open the door of his bedroom without a lot of grace, invades the small room with his erratic breath and runs up to the bedside table which he opens, drawer after drawer, to find the blue box, the one that he hadn't put back on the shelf in the supermarket.
“Sure.”
. His hands were joined in a silent prayer, his feet exceeding over the armrest, and even if this evening was going as usual, John could have sworn he saw a tear running down the youngest man's cheek. By far, and by his eyes bitten by his age he's trying to forget, the doctor wasn't sure he didn't have a hallucination. He stayed for a while in his armchair without moving, simply admiring the scene that never really left him. He thinks about it often, and the idea that Sherlock really could have cried just by listening to music pulls his lips in a grimace he's not really sure he has to call a smile.
John and Sherlock look at each other, understand, and it’s not smelling like ginger tea in the kitchen anymore but like chlorine.
"Very well, we are about to begin..." Sherlock starts, quickly interrupted by Anderson's quavering voice.
," corrects John, smiling at Molly who salutes them before going back to the dance floor.
"Very well, seen like that, everybody is controlled by something then," laughs John bitterly, crossing his arms against his chest and facing his unbearable flatmate with totally inappropriate ideas.
It may be in John's head, but it looks like a way to stop the conversation. Mrs. Hudson collects the empty plates and gets up to move to the kitchen, where she prepares the Christmas pudding (in which she added marshmallows this time) and adds:
Anyway. -SH
For the first time, Moriarty succeeded in looking at someone else than Sherlock. But of course, he's not talking to John directly and the way he speaks to Sherlock as if John isn't a human being capable of holding a conversation makes him feel like shit. Sherlock doesn't answer so Jim turns around to look at John with his impenetrable gaze. Silence doesn't seem to bother Moriarty who's getting so close that he only have to raise his hand... and here he is, touching John's splint.
And yet. -SH
"And... it is serious between them? Have they been seeing each other for a long time?" wonders John, without knowing really why, but Sherlock simply makes a movement with his shoulder. "Which means?"
“Yes, Sherlock?” He's ready to put it back with the receipt in his wallet.
“John, please don’t…”
want,” retorts Sherlock, squinting, already annoyed by the wait.
When John wakes up from a nap as deep as the circles under his eyes, he drinks Mrs Hudson’s cold tea. She is downstairs baking a cake, even if he told her repeatedly that he wasn’t hungry, and Lestrade is sitting next to him on a chair he brought closer to him, reading a book he found in Sherlock’s library about the different sorts of inks.
"Sherlock, I wanted to tell you…"
"We've known Mrs. Hudson for seven years, yes," the oldest one confides, smiling, and something in his eyes shows the doctor that he's particularly proud to be able to tell this anecdote. "Sherlock met her during his first case, he presented me to her and she immediately adopted us."
"He's gay," concludes Sherlock, raising an eyebrow, and John nearly suffocates on his beer.
John Watson isn't sure.
"So, you know Molly."
"That would be incredibly too simple, but simplicity sometimes has its advantages."
"I don't know if it's a good idea, he told me that she didn't like the family meals too much."
Are you spending the night with your brother? -J
He turns his back and keeps moving, again and again. You can't stop a man going wherever he's going, even if he doesn't know where that is. He recognizes the Waterstein cliffs for loving them so much, years ago. He's on top of one of them now. He sees the lighthouse, far away on his left, but it's not what he's looking for. He keeps moving and his body is stroked by the wind and the distant voice that calls his name.
"I'm fine!" The blond man yelled, who never understand why Sherlock always needed to use his first name as if he was slightly half-wit by not understanding the detective was talking to him.
"I don't understand, how can he not have a visa?" John stammers, looking at Sheri then at Sherlock who shakes his head to say he doesn't have the slightest idea.
"Oh, that would be
You were on TV tonight :) -J
“It's pointless for us to be here, John.”
"Good evening, Mark."
. He leaves his steaming cup, takes three enormous steps and comes back in the living-room. In the entrance, Sherlock's looking at him, his eyes so wide open they seem ready to fall out of their orbits, arms a little tangled in the coat he was removing. Their gazes are connected, they're holding on, like two tightrope walkers on a thread at the edge of breaking. It's the first groan coming out of the computer's poor quality speakers that gives the kick-off.
They walk side by side for about ten minutes before entering the first station they see. Sat in a dangling car, John thinks suddenly again about the interrogation which had taken place in the parking lot:
"The kitchen is in the same state."
"He knows we're throwing him a surprise party, right?"
But will you recognise me? That's the question. -J
“Oh, what does he want?”
"That's because you leave things to chance. Not him."
"You saw a kid with bronchitis, a case of gastroenteritis, three cases of eczema and a teenage girl who came for you to sign a dispensation for a sport class; how is that saving lives?"
From the first moment, from the first breath which dies in John's throat, he feels the kiss suffocating him, pulling outside of himself all the gangrenous desire he has been shutting down for months. Sherlock's tongue's invading him, makes their groans collide and mix, move them closer while John's arms hang on to Sherlock's still dressed shoulders. They are holding each other in a painful way, because neither of them will release the other one, not now when they're finally expressing themselves without using any words.
At the corner of Blandford Street, there's a small café painted in a sapphire blue. On the front window, there's an A4 page, soberly framed, which the owner is cleaning with a small duster. Of course, the road hasn't been blocked, but with the three police cars parked on the pavement, the residents are slowing down, taking off one earpiece and trying to catch sight of the reason for the sudden police invasion. There are two officers in front of the black front door that John is crossing before following Sherlock up the building's stairway. They stop on the second floor where the right door is already opened.
, and oh how John is falling right now. He has to leave earth, otherwise the impact would be fatal. He has to visit the moon, away from any gravity. He has to break the contact. But the skin is too soft and the gesture too evident. He lies back on his slide and lets the unwilling hand stay just where it is. His eyes close themselves and his sleep’s worth all the gold in the world.
"Stop moving now, I'm begging you," Sherlock whispers before he rests his hand on John's forehead.
," answers his friend before twisting himself awkwardly to let John undressing him despite the limited space.
"Arms out," John said, voice soft and warm, his smile even warmer, and his hands even warmer than that when their calloused palms pressed to the bare skin of Sherlock's ribs.
"Are you… asking me to move in with you?" John asked, expression slowly clearing, posture easing from bonelessness into something more alert.
