The silver-haired man sighed and held his hands up in surrender as the Citadel guards swarmed around their party. Behind him, Sally protested loudly and Mike gave a ghost of a smile. Despite their familiarity around the damn place, they were still being treated as a threat.
It was having mixed success, but suddenly S was in his mind, reviewing the deductions he’d made at the lab. He had a last name now: Watson. It was probably embossed on the tags around his neck--if they
John pondered privately. Even thinking thus, however, his grip stayed firm. Last time he’d been separated from S was still fresh in his mind. They were better together. Just the two of them against the rest of the world.
From the small crack in the closet, his light eyes followed these beings dully, searching for something. What was he looking for? Labcoat tugged on his sleeve, the hunger blazing in her eyes. He shook his head again. There was something here. He just had to find it. Then he could give in. Then they could eat.
The corners of S’s lips tipped up a little at that. John laughed and scooted forward in his seat, finally ready to surrender to what he now saw was full daylight. “So what now?”
Beside him, S had finished his little chat with one of the corpses and had not responded to his requests for a plan. Instead, he stood frozen for a moment before a small “Ah!” escaped his lips and he sprang into action.
The pounding interrupted his thoughts yet again. “I know you can hear me, you dead bastard!” More pounding. He was really going to hurt his hand.
) tunnel and onto the stage by a being who, by definition, had no working heart, he wondered if maybe the old sayings were wrong. Even figuratively, this was a dead man he had known only a few days. S. He didn’t even know his name.
Regret and remonstrance were luxuries he could not afford at the moment, however. S hauled the doctor’s limp frame out of the shack, still snarling and snapping at the dead around him. They weren’t out of the woods yet. He still had to get John somewhere safe. He broke into a run, his dead muscles better acquainted with the activity since his panicked charge earlier.
corpses. They were not heavy on creative thought, not unless food was involved, and even then, it was clear when you looked in their eyes that no one was home.
She looked taken aback, but S saw a spark of something in her eyes before John’s yelling caught his attention.
Thoughts flashed through his head faster and faster, small observations becoming larger connections.
They walked past what he now recognized as Covent Garden. He tried not to gawk (the dead did not care about sightseeing), but it had been years since he had gotten to appreciate London's unique attractions. Most of it was eerily untouched, as if waiting to be occupied once more.
if you want the long version of the last 7 gd months or if you just want to bug me--I love talking to people!
It was strange in many ways. John hadn’t ever heard a corpse laugh--or speak, for that matter--and this laugh was a deep, hoarse thing filled with halting breaths and shudders. He appeared quite tickled.
The door burst open, admitting the second wave of dead. More yelling. This time, ‘John’ was participating in the noise as well, shouting orders and foisting the bag of medical supplies on the overweight member of their group. “Mary!” He turned, fending off a corpse. It appeared one of Labcoat’s meals had already arisen in her absence. “Goddammit, they got Billy!”
) process had been strictly necessary, but he kept silent as he watched S pick one of the  two identical buildings and head to the door. The dead man seemed deep in thought, and John wondered if this had been an important place to him when he was alive.
You tried to kill yourself, John. Your brain was several minutes without oxygen. I found you in the flat, when I came back, when I wanted to reveal myself. -SH
John shook his head, upset at himself. "I'm sorry." He chuckled. "It seems like that's the only thing I'm able to say right now ."
It didn't make sense. If it was six weeks since the last time he forgot, as Sherlock and Greg said, the 6th time he forgot would be... 6 November. He smiled as he noticed that he wrote it down in the corner, and added it to 6. But now... There was a space of four months between 4 and 6... which REALLY didn't make sense. John frowned as he quickly poked through some more journals, trying to figure out the anomaly, frantically jotting things down. After around 20 minutes, he sat back. He hadn't forgotten 6 times... He had forgotten 10 times. This was the 10th time he had forgotten.
There was an empty feeling in his chest the whole time, and he kept wondering if it was better or worse than when Sherlock was dead - He paused in middle of folding a shirt and crooked his head - Sherlock... was dead. He bit his lip as he quickly put the shirt in the suitcase and felt for the dogtags around his neck, his breath short. Once he felt the metal, he breathed a sigh of relief. Sherlock wasn't still dead. He hadn't imagined the last two days.
"Because of society, you daft man. If people got wind... our lives would be ruined. I'd be lucky to be allowed to continue practicing, let alone on civilized people."
John pulled his hand out of Sherlock's and shook his head, looking down. "But if that happens..." He swallowed. "If I don't know you... If the last thing I remember is coming back-" He looked back up. "Don't you realize how finding out that I missed 5 years of my own life would effect me?" His voice shook. "If that happened..." He cleared his throat. "Put me away?" He took Sherlock's hand now. "Promise me. Promise that if I forget you, you'll put me in a ward."
"It was pretty romantic. I wasn't able to deduce anything, you even made me cry." Sherlock admitted with a soft blush, clearing his throat again.
Sherlock shook his head. "I had to live without you for so long. I know how it is to be without you. And even if you keep forgetting me over and over again, spending time with you is better. I just shut my mind down and ignore it."
I can't make any promises, but I REALLY hope to get back to this, as my RPs have picked up again and I seem to have gotten back my writing muse.
for God's sake." Greg hit the back of John's head with his palm. "You're not going to throw this away, John"
"You have Lestrade. And Mrs. Hudson. And Mycroft. And God, if you want, you can go to a ward. Whatever you want." He shrugged and sighed. "I'm not tired. I've made my decision. I pack and go to my parents."
John nodded. "I got it in October, yeah." He finished up his egg and stood up to put his plate in the sink. "Greg said that he found a few things of yours in the office, and brought them over to me." He stuck the plate into the sink and turned on the water, pouring a bit of soup onto the plate. "When was I supposed to have gotten it?"
Sherlock just moved closer to him, intertwining their fingers together and moved his head against John's knee. "This is the seventh time."
"God..." Sherlock's words hit him like a sack of bricks and he covered his face with his hands. "God, you're right..." He muttered into his palms, "If I hadn't texted you..." He turned to look at Sherlock, his eyes tearing up, "You're right. " His breath hitched a bit as he started crying quietly, "I could have killed myself, and you-" He stopped, "-Oh God..."
For all of the differences of the eras, he must say that he preferred the 1800s for the availability of his poison of choice. Though the 21st century was certainly enjoyable for the technology it offered.
When Sherlock came into the bedroom, their bedroom, his own bedroom, he closed the door and nearly collapsed against the wood of it. He sank down and just let the tears come freely. He allowed himself to cry like this because he know he needed it. He knew that he destroyed their relationship by lying to John, but he didn't understand why John wasn't able to see it was just to prevent him from any pain. Sherlock took a deep breath, before standing up again, continuing to pack his things. He didn't actually notice what he was packing he just sort of threw some stuff into the suitcase. He didn't care. He just wanted to snap his fingers and heal John... Fix him... Make it so that that he would be able to go upstairs to sit down next to the other man and fall asleep together. "No," Sherlock murmured to himself. "Shut up." But the thoughts only continued to get louder, pressing in around him and telling him that John would never return.
"I don't want you to go!" John shouted down. "I want you to have your life!" He turned to look down the flight of stairs to Sherlock. "
"But so much could happen, John. You could just forget to text me, I could just not get one of your texts, because I've got no signal. Anything could be wrong." He said with a sigh. "I have to live in current fear that I'll come home to find you dead."
?" John pushed away from the bed to peer down at Sherlock. "That's probably the worst thing you could have done! How am I supposed to trust you now?"
Watson was doing his best not to react, since he knew that this was how Holmes thought best. Though it definitely could grate on the nerves. After nearly a half hour, he set down his paper. "Would you
"Don't be. It's okay." Sherlock sighed and closed his eyes for a moment, completely leaning against John's hand. "I'm used to this by now. Your last attack was six weeks ago, this was the longest time between two attacks. We already thought you were cured." Sherlock murmured as an answer.
John pulled his phone from his pocket, opening up his text log. After a few moments, he looked back up at Sherlock. "This... is real?" He swallowed roughly. "And we-?"
"I don't mean to be hard. But don't promise such things, John. You can't be sure." Sherlock smiled sadly.
-a lot, but I should probably get used to being in a ward and being supervised." John reached up and played with the ring on Sherlock's dogtags. "I don't even know what is right or wrong in this situation..." He looked down, biting his lip. "I just... I want us to work, but I don't want you to have to change your life. I want things to be the way they
"Well, then he is an idiot too. But I don't think that he meant it like that." He explained and hit John's head again. "You are an idiot and you go back to Sherlock, live with him, marry him and have cute little babies."
"I know, honey, I know it. I'm not having any doubts about it, It's written on your face." Sherlock intertwined their fingers gently. "I don't want to be like your parents, sending you away, because I don't know how to deal with it... It was your suggestion."
Sherlock stared at the door where John had been standing just several moments before. He took a deep breath and pressed his eyes shut. No, no, no, he wasn't going to cry.
John sat down next to Sherlock as he blew at his tea to cool it a bit. "Yeah, the first time I forgot... I mean, this time... It's already happened six times now, so you're used to it... But the first time...?" He bit his lip and swallowed roughly to clear the tightness in his throat. "Did I punch you again?" He smirked as he took a sip of his tea, slightly burning his tongue.
love you. I don't want to put you away... I want to keep you, even if we have to start over every day and even if you wouldn't remember me at all, John." He said with a sigh. "If you want to break up, do it. But don't say you deserve to die."
John barely processed what he said, taking a few moments before nodding absently. "It wasn't worth it, you know?" He squinted at the ring and shrugged. "I wasn't worth it to keep going on... In my mind, it was just two years of hell... I didn't remember any of the last six months." He took the ring off of his finger and examined it, trying his hardest to remember what it was supposed to be.
"He jus' needs time is all." John sighed. "Las' time... You said i' was two weeks ago?" He took a swig from his beer, feeling oddly at ease now despite the issues he was talking about. "It obviously didn't stick." He huffed. "Bu' now... Now I'll lock m'self away so he'll have to deal with it."
"Are you sure?" Sherlock asked, locking his gaze with John's. "You could just stay here and maybe get another hour of sleep."
Greg shook his head. "Honestly, you're probably the biggest lightweight I've met. You usually just have a beer, but it
"What do you mean?" He pulled his hand away from Sherlock's head, propping his head up with it, looking down at Sherlock. "Did we just jump from friends to fiancés?"
John smiled at the obvious juvinility to the other man's manner of speech. "Yeah, it does." He sighed and tucked his hands into his pockets. "Every time I forget I get suicidal again..." He paused. "Well, actually..." He looked down at the floor as they passed an orderly. "I don't think it sounds so bad at the moment, which is scaring me a bit."
John nodded, looking down. "I..." He looked up, meeting Sherlock's eyes. "I think..." He said slowly, barely meaning what he was saying, "I think we should..." His voice descended into a whisper, "Go for a walk..." He bit his lip. "Get some air..." He swallowed. "You know?" He still hadn't looked away from Sherlock's eyes.
John ran his hand through his still-wet hair, and tilted his head. "Mary?" He squinted, working hard to remember. "I think..." He frowned and shook his head. "No... Nothing." He sighed.
', John thought and a rock caught in his throat. "I need some air." He looked up at Sherlock. "Actually, I need a drink... I'm gonna text Lestrade." He pulled his phone out of his back pocket.
"Then I make it look like we just met, that we just ran into each other. I don't know." Sherlock breathed slowly, obviously trying to keep calm. "A ward? Why would I put you in a ward, John?"
"Do whatever you want. It's not like it matters what I say, apparently..." Sherlock turned around and kicked against chair, shouting angrily and indecipherably.
A short while later, John stepped out of the bathroom wearing his bathrobe. He looked around the room anxiously, afraid that he wouldn't be able to find Sherlock, when his eyes fell on a figure on the couch. He stepped towards Sherlock slowly. John didn't want to leave the flat to go upstairs. He didn't want to leave Sherlock for fear of him disappearing, but he wasn't going to feel right sharing a bed with him just yet... He knew they must have slept together, but he didn't remember it... and it would feel
"John..." Sherlock turned to look at him. "Calm down." He breathed out again and sighed. "I won't put you in a ward. You'll get suicidal there, and I don't want that to happen. No."
John nodded and leaned into Greg, walking to 221B unsteadily. "I think..." He smiled and stepped away from him. "I think I'm good from here..." He leaned against the door as he pushed it open. "I c'n get upstairs m'self." He didn't want Greg there when he got back into the flat. He had a lot to talk about with Sherlock, and while it seemed that Greg knew a lot, he also didn't know that John had proposed... He probably didn't tell him everything after all, and this discussion with Sherlock was going to be a whopper. "Thanks f'r the drinks, the walk back an'..." He chuckled. "The pep talk."
"Yes, you are in treatment." He nodded and closed his eyes. "You are working now, yeah. You have gaps of memory that are missing, but you're able to work because you haven't lost any of your training." Sherlock sighed, looking up. "And yes, I like that very much, John."
"Stop it, Sherlock." John spoke firmly. "You're acting childish." He shook his head. "You need them too. You stay here where they can keep an eye on you and make sure you don't fall back on bad habits, and I go to a ward where they can keep an eye on me to make sure I don't kill myself."
John looked up quickly, his eyes red. "I-" He swallowed. "I can't do this to you again, Sherlock." His voice cracked and he stood up, everything spilling out, "I can't have you live with someone who doesn't know you.... You deserve better than me." He felt warm tears start flowing down his face. "You should just put me away and let me think you're dead." He sniffed and wiped his face with the back of his hand. "You should find someone new... Someone who could love you back like you deserve." John's breath grew short as he started crying... Really crying. "You... You should have just let me die... You would have gotten over me, and you would have had a normal life." He swallowed and turned away from Sherlock, kicking the leg of the table. "You shouldn't have
John sat forward on his chair, leaning on his elbows as he took another sip, and nodded. "I remember thinking of different ways... Before I texted you, I was looking around for... Well, you know." He inclined his head slightly. "I was certain you were still gone..." He frowned as he played with a strange ring around his finger. "I was so sure of it..." He trailed off, looking at it curiously as he set his tea down.
"No shit, Watson." Greg chuckled and shook his head. "We should go then. Do you want me to bring you back to Baker Street or do you want to stay with me?"
"No you didn't." John bit his lip as he looked at Sherlock. "You're just trying to make me feel better."
When Sherlock got down the stairs, he hesitated and looked at Mrs. Hudson's door, but he remembered that she wasn't at Baker Street but visiting her sister. So it wouldn't make any sense to go in and explain himself, she would have to deal with his departure. Sherlock stepped out of the building, closed the front door behind him and took a deep breath. It felt strange. Just like two years ago, when he knew that he was leaving Baker Street. But back then he was sure that there was a chance of coming back, but right now, he wasn't so sure about himself allowed to come back at all. Sherlock had a really strange feeling inside his gut... That this was his last goodbye to Baker Street.
There was Zoe, a woman who was schizophrenic and was forcefully committed by her family because she refused to take her medication.
Sherlock followed John out of the room, but stayed downstairs, looking up after him. "I don't want to move out, I just... want to give you what you wanted. I'll come back as soon as want me to, as soon as you feel ready to trust me again."
"Maybe you just need to see her. It could trigger something, and besides, the two of you get along quite well."
John clicked save and ran his hands over his face as he reread the entry. Yeah, that was basically it. He didn't feel like it really encapsulated the feeling he had right then, but he didn't want to remember it if he'd forget. It wasn't a good feeling. He just felt betrayed. He sighed as he clicked out of it and looked at the long list of journal entries. There seemed to be a LOT. He checked and there seemed to be over 80 entries. Well.. Reading all of them was definitely out of the picture. He clicked on one at random ("Journal 10 July") and started reading.
John noticed Sherlock flinch a bit as John set down the ring, and when he spoke his voice was strained. "You tricked me into coming to Bart's, where we first met. The lab, you know? You cooked us dinner and it was like a picnic. Candles everywhere and a blanket on the floor. We ate and then you asked."
"You need a bit of air, I know. It's like this every time." Sherlock sighed and lowered his head. "Usually you walk around and meet with Lestrade in your favorite pub to calm down."
Holmes, meanwhile, was standing by the window and fiddling with his violin, playing little snippets of pieces in one big Frankenstein of a piece.
John bit his lip as he smiled and wrote down "29th June" near the 2, quickly doing a bit of calculations and writing "11 days" near it. He skimmed through some more journals, smiling every once in a while and getting choked up at some things. He noted down a few dates on the list. So far it was looking a bit confusing to him. Sherlock had said that he forgot 6 times... But the dates weren't making sense.
Again, this is an RP that I'm polishing up into one perspective (even though there will be parts of Sherlock's perspective.) It's still a WIP at this point, so I'm posting this in chapters.
John stared at the door as it closed in his face. Well. That was. This was. It was a lot to process. He groaned and walked back to the living room, wanting to take his tea. And that was when he noticed... his cane was leaning up against the side of his chair.
Once he got dressed, he started looking around for a suitcase to pack his things in, which took longer than he expected, since he didn't remember where anything was kept. In the end he found a small carry-on sized rolling suitcase in the flat and carried it upstairs to start packing.
see him again, but now, with everything coming to light... He definitely couldn't fight to keep him around. When he got up to the point where Sherlock said that if he forgot he wouldn't come back, he felt a flare of indignation. John didn't care. He didn't care if Sherlock never came back. He honestly didn't care. Except he did, obviously. He hated that Sherlock lied to him because he loved him. He scrunched the letter up and stood up and walked back to his bedroom. For most of the next 2 hours, John researched nearby medical facilities and settled on one that sounded good. The next morning he was going to pack up his things and commit himself. He wrote down the address and shut his laptop. After giving his room a once over, he changed into pajamas and head to sleep.
“I guess that sounds odd, but they act like animals, right?” He shrugged. “Some animals get scared, even of their own kind. Fight or flight. We followed the ones that fled. Not that strange.”
, John mourned, looking at the waning stripes of light from the door--and his fists were an inconvenient and temporary fix.
They hadn’t known. The corpses were strong. They were aggressive. They didn’t seem to feel pain, and attempts to injure or kill them were met with no palpable response besides anger. The only thing that seemed to work was destroying the brain. This presented a problem, for such surgical precision (or ruthless violence, as Billy had shown) was lacking in most Londoners. They were ridiculously easy targets.
In all the strangeness, he’d let it drift from his mind, and God, he wished it had stayed that way. Things had been a little forced between them, sure. Secrets kept from each other, pasts better left untold. He didn’t even remember the last time they’d slept in the same bed, with all her night watch shifts. He hadn’t even gotten to say goodbye, to fix things.
John was dodging back and forth, fending off corpses. He was doing quite well, S thought, but there were too many, and every moment they stayed was a moment closer to sunset, to boneys breaking down doors and slaughtering indiscriminately.
A lanky teen leaned out from behind Mary and thrust a wicked looking hunting knife nearly beneath his nose. “Right ‘ere, Doc,” he said in a cheerful voice completely at odds with his...well, his knife.
Grabbing the food gratefully, John didn’t even question how S had gotten into the metal containers until S handed him a second already-opened can.
hunger. “You know, in all of our previous studies, we never found a corpse with this much higher brain function. All of that and you don’t eat brains? What are the chances? Maybe the two are linked!”
S stood by him, and appearing almost flushed in the fading light as they caught their breaths. He removed his hand from their grasp, leaving John’s oddly cold, to put his coat back on.
When he handed it back, John was amazed at the sheer number of words he had managed to enter on the screen. For a man who couldn’t seem to string more than a few words together without running out of breath, S typed unbelievably fast. When John actually read the words, however…
His brother’s mindless state had to end, one way or another. As sentimental and pointless as it was, Mycroft had discovered there was nothing he wouldn’t do to accomplish that goal. But he was running out of options and--yet again--people. He’d tried all of Sherlock’s old haunts, but the man had been in love with all of London.
Mary nodded once, firmly. “Alright, luv.” She turned to John. “Go and fetch Stamford. I’m assuming we’re looking for specific pharmacological supplies this time?” She was looking at John, but her question included the Minister as well.
It was not a yes or no question, and this was not something he wanted to try to speak nor put into text. Instead, he let John’s question hang there between them until the other man picked it up again, his brow wrinkled in thought. “So...you
S staggered, still growling like a man possessed, as he tried to wade through the enticing aroma and find reason on the other side. He needed to think clearly. If he couldn’t think, he couldn’t keep them away from John. No one was allowed to touch John. John belonged to him, not them.
“Don’t bother,” Mary cut in before Billy could accept the offer. “He needs to pick up that great bloody knife and remember how to use it to actually protect himself.” She nudged the piece on the ground before a silver-haired man grabbed it and helped him up, taking care not to jostle his arm.
John shook his head slowly, still staring back at him. “No,” he said, lips barely moving. “I’m trapped in a music hall with the world’s only leftover-saving zombie, I’m maybe probably definitely crazy, and for some reason, I’m
But he was on the cusp of a discovery, he knew it. Even if this epiphany was that he’d been an awful villain of a man, wielding wealth and intelligence like a blade against his enemies, he wanted to know about it. He could...enact justice, make amends, redeem himself, do
AN: I'm still plotting the end of this, and I think I may need to create a literal timeline. This end-of-the-world business is just the pits to schedule! ;)
“John!” She yelled as he finally divested her of the gun. The short man turned abruptly. Ah, that must be the fiancee then.
The light had faded even more during his cleaning frenzy. He was not worried John would try to escape while he slept because he did not sleep. Corpses were incapable of sleep, as far as he knew, and he barely even needed to rest. He could (and likely would) stand in the doorway all night watching his puzzling new acquisition.
John sat back in the chair, the can of beans dangling limply in his hand. He didn’t realize he had drifted off until he felt a prodding against his shoulder. S had (somehow) opened the tin and was now poking him with the handle-end of a spoon.
Still standing listlessly in the closet, he sharpened his gaze. The short man. Tan, but not above the wrists. Stands like a soldier. Wearing a thin ball-clasp chain: dog tags. Expert marksman but clear medical knowledge.
“You…didn’t ask.” S’s angular face portrayed casual indifference as he took back the knife, but his hurt at John’s recent escape shone in his eyes.
tags, and he was fairly certain they were. They would declare that he was a doctor. A surgeon, judging by the callouses. A surgeon in the military? RAMC, then. Stationed somewhere sunny...
But S was clearly not a skeleton. Thin as a bloody beanpole, yes, but still flesh and blood. He should not be able to run at all, much less outpace John as they sprinted down the stairs.
He straightened, faith in his own abilities bolstered for now. He was a soldier. He had always been prepared to die fighting. The broken bottle clenched firmly in his fist, he moved to open the shutters again.
Shaken, S turned his face to the sky. A rare flash of sense-memory reminded him that he had once blown smoke into the sky over the city just like this, mulling over his problems, his place in it all. The flash of remembrance quickly faded, but he smiled nonetheless. He may be dead now, but he was doing the same sorts of things he’d done when he was alive. And apparently he’d managed to kick his smoking habit.
He read it twice, just to be sure, then looked up at the undead enigma before him. Those pale eyes were focused on him. He seemed apprehensive, as if he both welcomed and dreaded John’s response.
“No. Here.” S rolled his eyes and pointed to the bottom pane, broken like the others but with a circular spray of cracks leading out from a point on the edge of the glass. It looked oddly familiar.
Without conscious thought, he wandered over to one of the tables still laden with props and grabbed a violin. He could hardly help that John couldn’t see--and was probably cold? He couldn’t tell--but maybe he could use sound to put them both at ease.
S’s fingers paused in their tapping. Hmm, mark two more traits: inquisitiveness and a sense of justice. Although the latter might be John rubbing off on him. Still, it seemed prudent to become more introspective. It stood to reason that all of the information he needed to rediscover himself was still inside his mind.
“Llll...lab,” she uttered beside him. He nodded. Food was always prevalent in the lab because...because…
The thought startled him, not the least because he knew it was entirely true. He had never cared much for his own survival, and the hunger was the only thing that drove him to maintain his existence. Now, he had to protect John.
He put a hand to his stomach, an aborted attempt to stifle the sound. “No--I mean, yes, of course, but--”
Anyway, enjoy and know that I love you all so much for reading and making me feel like this is actually worth reading. Stay safe and lovely, my friends! <3
In his solitary existence, he tried not to think about the horrid things. But with John around, S found himself thinking a lot more, and now he cursed his willing ignorance.
He shrugged to himself. Aging was such an ephemeral concept. The living struggled against it, and the dead no longer experienced it. He was the same as he had ever been and ever would be, as far as he knew.
He directed his gaze toward the front of the group where she crouched tensely against the wall. What had Mary done in the beginning that had been so integral to Mycroft?
was still dragging John down the streets of Old London. Barely paying attention to where they were going, so focused on breathing, on
Hoo boy, apologies, but my timeline changed...some things, and I inserted a new chapter in my current prewritten stuff. Nothing already posted has changed, but I had to make sure everything after that chapter still jived and...yeah. Here's a new chapter.
He groaned and turned to Mike, who once again gave a half-hearted smile. “I’m so sorry, Dr. Stamford, er, Mike,” he stumbled over the familiar address. This was John’s friend, not his, but they had both suffered the loss of a friend. “Thank you for your help. I’ve got to, erm, deal with something, but…” Again, he was at a loss. “Just...let me know if you want to talk, okay?”
“Take my hand,” S ordered as they entered the stairwell. He turned to wedge a metal bar in the door and then held out his hand.
He smelled delicious. It was always the scent that did it. It tickled his senses and awakened the hunger. He shook himself. Not now.
Without dreams of his own, it was going to be a long night. He reached into his pocket and grabbed some of the brain he’d saved. He eyed John to make sure he was truly out. Time for a snack.
“Ugh.” S’s voice came from behind him. John panicked for a moment when he felt two large hands grasp his shoulders and jerk him off balance, only to find himself collapsing onto a soft, familiar surface. It was the chair he’d slept in the last few nights. Had they reached the storage room already?
As if she was hitting the Tesco just round the block. “You need to take this seriously,” he hissed. There were zombies out there. Actual corpses walking about, trying to get a tummyful of brains. John shuddered involuntarily. “You’ve got your silencer, I see. What about knives?”
Had any of the others made it back? He’d seen Greg and Sally out the window. Even Mike had made it, bless his lab-confined soul. But what about the others?
This one, though—there was a glimmer of intelligence. And it had completely ignored the option of eating John. It was all very odd. He’d never seen a corpse behave so…human.
Labcoat had pulled away to approach the youngest one. Good strategy, he mused as he grasped the blonde’s leg and jerked it out from under her.
Greg Lestrade, former Lieutenant of Her Majesty’s Royal Marines, straightened his back and smirked. A little flirting could go a long way.
Inside, there were a number of helpful and unhelpful things: napkins, towels, toe blocks, ribbons, leotards, and sundry bits of refuse. A few candy and protein bar wrappers declared that he had been right in his deductions about this being a snack cache, but they were far too late to take advantage. However, another commodity appeared to be stocked quite well.
“What? You bloody corpse! You want me to shut up?” The grey-haired man yelled as he brandished a large knife at her. “If you wanted quiet, bitch, then you shouldn’t have fucking killed my friend!” She shook her head, moving to avoid the wicked-looking serrated blade
It had never occurred to S to question where he came from. He’d wondered who he was before, what he’d done, who had known him, how he’d died, but all of that was before his death. After his death, he remembered everything; he’d just never bothered to make the connection between the two.
For being so very quiet before, it seemed that every member of this particular group of the living was shouting now, warning their friends, yelling out their adrenaline...except the short one. The man remained deucedly silent, focused on each individual shot, quickly but carefully aimed at critical areas: knees, eyes, throat, head.
) frame. Sharp cheekbones in an already long, angular face now stretched in an expression to which it was clearly not accustomed.
The concession stand in the atrium would be the best option if the huge glass panes that had once made up the walls of the atrium had not been shattered some years ago. The stand could still contain nonperishable food, but it was out in the open, exposed to wanderers, living and dead alike. Dangerous for them both, but especially for John.
“Oy!” Billy yelled, no longer grasping the knife and instead cradling his wrist. “I didn’t mean nothin’, I swear!”
“S!” John had abandoned their stealth strategy and was now slugging nearby corpses. “Have you got a plan?”
One by one, the others walked in. Blonde woman, tall man, short man, fat man, grey man, small woman, dark woman, young man, another tall man.
John’s breath hitched. This was it. The corpse had chilled him overnight and was planning to eat him come morning. He looked wildly around the room for possible weapons, but it was all props, purposely intended not to hurt people.
It wasn’t a bad plan. But he knew the way down would not be as abandoned as it had been when he and Labcoat had come up. Of course, the way would be safe for them no matter how full of corpses it became: they were dead.
“Then go!” John shouted back. “I’ll be right behind you!” He shot another of the others and muttered, “Right after I find her.”
He liked the labs. Couldn’t remember why, but he always felt as if something was going to be solved here.
“Indeed.” S smiled, nodding at the hand still holding the beans. John bent to return them to his pocket, and when he straightened, he found himself quite...close. S made no move to put any distance between them, and John felt his cheeks heat. This...man. This ridiculous man who had just saved his life for the third time in as many days. For some reason, S had given up his habits, his diet, his very lifestyle for John. “Why me?” He whispered, his breath close enough to ruffle the other man’s dark curls.
John just hoped S was not a murderer. He’d said he wouldn’t eat him, but that didn’t mean he didn’t plan to kill him as he acted out the behaviors of his past life. Playing violin, texting, killing people, all in a day’s work for your average psychopathic genius.
Well, when people were dying, personal agendas could go screw themselves. If the minister was hiding something, he was duty-bound to discover what it was and make sure no one else died because of it. How he chose to do it, however, was entirely up to him.
Ah, yes. John handed the phone back to the man. “You should just keep this. You’re clearly going to get more use out of it than I can.”
Ever since he’d made it clear that he was not going to eat him, John had been almost exuberant in his interactions with him. It felt…good. Like having a friend.
When he’d been shot, he fought death and won, but recovering made him wish he hadn’t. He hadn’t wanted to fight anymore, and he’d figured death was the only end to it all. He’d fought himself more than anything else during that tense time, and when he’d made it through, Mary had been waiting on the other side. She’d been sweet enough that he’d fooled himself into thinking he’d finally gotten everything he’d fought for, that he was done fighting.
It was a haunting sort of place, he supposed, watching John take it all in. Empty and abandoned without warning, like most of London. But it used to contain music. The most glorious music and performances you ever heard, played by professionals on instruments made for just that purpose.
S ripped himself from those giddy thoughts. Normally he would be sneaking a bite as John slept, but he could not tear his eyes from the puzzle that was John Watson. And even if he could, he’d been quite put off his normal diet by the image of himself from a victim’s--from
Except for the doors, which were locked, bolted, boarded, and chained. Unlike the entrances of so many of the other ransacked buildings, this portal seemed to have held against the undead intruders. The posters around it and along the walls were blood-splattered and torn at the edges, but it was still as clear to John that
S shook his head. He opened his mouth, but then seemed to think better of it and gestured for the phone again.
He had theories. Of course he had theories. But he was following a trail long gone cold, and the consequences of following it to its end could be...unpleasant. He wrinkled his nose in distaste at the inadequate description. Disheartening. Hurtful.
“—a dagger...you see...before you?” He flipped the blade in his hand so that it faced John hilt-first and raised his eyebrows.
Sunlight streamed across ceiling full force, informing him that he’d slept late for once. A strip of light painted half of that angular the face, creating an eerie effect as it lit up one eye but failed to shrink the pupil. The pale face, now blessedly free of blood, remained expressionless as he stared.
Lestrade crossed his arms. “That’s not the impression I got earlier, sir. When you commissioned a unit to complete a mission whose ultimate purpose was unknown to most of its members.” All of this spoken carefully, without inflection.
Now S found himself pressed up against the booth, rancid blood and skin on his face and a crowd of dead scrambling in front of him. He snarled and growled and did his level best to convince them he was an unusually aggressive boney mid-transformation to forbid them coming any closer, but he knew it was up to the scent to mask his true intent. Besides, the smell of live, human John inside the booth was an enticement few corpses could pass up--even S struggled occasionally to resist its allure. Whether or not his plans worked, he would not be able to keep them off for long.
S groaned (a far more normal sound for a corpse, in John’s opinion) and pointed at him. “You...ssoldier.” He stopped and waited.
S sighed. He might not have full control of his voice yet, but that sigh communicated every bit of frustration and disdain he felt John was inflicting upon him. “It helps.” He said finally.
) work again, but in order for him to reach John, it would have to work on S. He’d have to resemble something even corpses feared, and the only thing that frightened the dead were those even more dead than them: boneys.
Satisfied that he had a minute or so to gather himself, John turned and assessed the interior of the booth. Scraps of ticket paper and little else.
Moments later, that silver was tarnished with blood as he smashed her head one last time against the cold tile floor.
Finding what he was looking for, he approached John, who sat rigid and waiting, and unfolded a large quilt, carefully laying it over him.
He turned quickly, trying to assess the threat. The heavy flop of his laden coat hitting his legs reminded him they were not quite out of options yet, but first:
It was an absurd thought in the midst of all this, but honestly, this was a corpse who talked, played violin, and kidnapped people before eating them; was it really so odd that he cared enough about his appearance to find a flannel and wipe off occasionally? He himself had discreetly used the blanket to scrub his face, but he still felt grimy and uncomfortable.
And now he’d lost them both in a single mission. A mission loosely rationalized as contributing to development of countermeasures but solidly based on his desire to search St. Bart’s for his long lost brother.
The man sat stunned for a moment but seemed willing to accept the offering. Still, it seemed neither of them were going to fall asleep any time soon (
He shook his head and shrugged. He’d worn this ensemble for years and it hadn’t mattered in the slightest. Besides, he knew for certain that anyone who tried to take this coat from him would have a fight on their hands. It was as much a part of him as his inoperational heart and his sluggish brain.
“Bit warm, but who’s complaining?” He took another sip. “I haven’t had a beer in ages.” He settled back in the plush red chair that S had already come to think of as his, then belatedly offered the bottle to him. “Sorry, did you want one?”
John clenched and unclenched his fists on the other side of the door before setting off for the labs to find Stamford. Mycroft had mentioned that Mary had become important to the establishment early on. John assumed it had something to do with her arms training, a skill she had (thankfully) learned from her father before he’d been struck down in the crisis. It was no surprise to him that those skills made her valuable to Mycroft. It was a surprise, however, to learn that she had become so important so quickly.
The words echoed in his head. His own voice. He hardly remembered what it was like to speak that easily, that
He trailed the bloody digits up John’s arm, smearing across his throat and onto his face. It was, he supposed, objectively repulsive. Yet John just stared, mouth slack beneath his bloody palm.
Raising his nose to the wind, he allowed the scents of the city, overrun with gunpowder, death, and decay, to permeate his senses. His city had fallen, but whatever her fate, S would always belong in London.
He took a breath. “Y’know, yeah. I am quite hungry. You wouldn’t happen to have a secret cache of rations around here, would you?” He asked, knowing perfectly well he didn’t. S seemed not to think much of the question either, narrowing his eyes at John and not responding to the ridiculous query. John chuckled weakly. “Yeah, thought not. I’m going to need to eat soon, though. D’you think you could find me something to eat?”
This time was no different. He knew he was making sound, hopefully music, his fingers plucking and caressing strings in a way that was clearly familiar, yet he just felt at peace.
His coat flapped around his legs, driven by wind and rain he did not feel. Around him were others. More heads raised, noticing the scent on the breeze he had already detected.
So, armed to the teeth and with experienced doctors and lifelong Londoners leading the way, the team marched into the breach.
For a panicky moment, he thought John was referring to Mary’s “leftovers” but John had not seen that. The living man was talking about
Thankfully, beating corpses in a foot race was still as easy as ever. Without rebar, they were forced to rely on the lock, but John did not plan on sticking around to find out how well it held.
Ex-Marine Lieutenant Gregory Lestrade stood in the doorway of his office, back ramrod straight and face grimly official.
He gestured to the dead around him. They were aimless now, but if they suspected food was right beneath their noses, well… He drew close to John. “Daaa...nnngggerouussss.”
“Look.” He pointed to the glass. Unsurprisingly, several of the panes had been shattered, leaving jagged pieces along the frame. John thought briefly of his improvised bottle knife and whether something like this would have been a suitable alternative--
It was a spacious room, dimly lit by the fading daylight as it trickled into the atrium. It was not the most private room, but it was his favorite. While there were a number of couches, chairs, and tables scattered throughout the area, it was not a space amenable to habitation. Every surface was covered in stage memorabilia, instruments, props, set pieces. It was a history of drama in one room.
He still needed to find dinner. It was a matter of minutes to dart into a few of the restaurants on the block. The third one yielded a few tins of beans. S smirked and slid the rations into his capacious pockets.
) had transformed into astonishment when John’s last semi-conscious action was to smile at S and murmur, “Absolutely fantastic.”
He continued, “Besides, we’ve been cooped up in this drafty old theatre for long enough. I need some fresh air, a little adventure,
And he did eventually, finally sparing a glance at John and his utter lack of amusement. “N-not eeat.” He removed one of his hands from John’s arm and pointed to his mouth, making a biting motion that would have been comical in any other situation and then shaking his head.
” he took a breath, “I had a hidden agenda.” This time, he returned Mycroft’s gaze, his dark eyes flashing.
John wondered, swaying slightly. The adrenaline from the chase had abated, leaving him weak and shaky. He definitely needed food. A simple tin of beans sounded heavenly, for God’s sake. But his makeshift knife from earlier was long gone, and he felt close to collapsing.
They wound through the halls in silence and finally emerged onto the street behind the hospital. He would need to communicate with John again, but even having gotten him out of the lab unscathed felt like a huge success. He was on fire! Thinking so clearly, and he’d barely had any of the brain! He could kiss John, honestly, although his newfound clarity alerted him that this would be deeply unwelcome, and not just because he was dead. But bigger problems lay ahead.
S shook himself and patted his pocket, roughly half the brain still left for later. It was now quite clear that John hadn’t known about his fiancee’s activities. And now he had a name,
” Fully awake and aware now, John’s eyes opened up to meet the eerily light blue gaze of the world’s only talking zombie. He was lying in an empty car park, hazily remembered corpses nowhere in sight. “Is that you?”
, he realized belatedly. He hadn’t understood at the time why S had smeared blood and God-knows-what all over his face, but now he marveled at the dead man’s forethought. It shook him to know that S had been protecting him since the moment they met.
, had he been that now as he looked around, John realized they were approaching the city center. Or at least, what used to be the city center before the corpses began to lurk there.
, that he tucked away for later attempts at thought. Pity he couldn’t control the memories he saw to find out more or he would have told (
His efforts were more and more hindered by the Crisis as it spread. Plans had been in place to preserve critical information, but he needed more than just essentials if he was to unearth his brother and his secrets. He was knee-deep in duplicating trade manifests and personnel documentation when it became clear that this information could be used to protect those left behind rather than continue the search for someone already gone. With a heavy heart, Mycroft had called off the search and used his position and particular skillset to build a safe haven for what was left of London.
John began to see the merit of S’s request to be interrogated earlier. Hoping to startle more information out of him, he asked, “Which one?” He’d bet it was one of the biggies. Cambridge. Oxford. King’s.
John had no intention of letting S control his life. He’d already been forced to march out here, in the middle of the dead zone of the city, to spend his time with a corpse--a fascinating corpse who showed extraordinary capabilities in music and deductive thought and who texted faster than John himself could type, but still a corpse. A dead man. It was time for the living to get going.
He inclined his head. Best not to dawdle. The hunger pulled at him just as much as the danger of the deader ones pushed him away. It was time. He looked up once more at the abandoned city skyline. Still picturesque but meaning nothing so much as the one thought he could always focus on: food.
He reached between them and dug into the small cavity, coming back with grubby, blood-smeared fingers.
John waited for S to recover from his dramatic spin before taking his hand and running toward the door. The coat had cleared a path, but it wouldn’t last long. They had to hurry.
He and Labcoat burst from the closet none too quietly, but the alive ones were distracted by the wave of dead at the door.
John was jolted out of his thoughts by the feeling of cold metal against his palm. For one bright, shining moment, he thought it was his gun, but the moment passed as he firmed his grip on the can of beans S was pressing upon him.
Roland Kerr Further Education College, the sign said. And he’d thought it was just an office building.
Taking advantage of his distraction, the blonde drew a knife from inside her vest and planted it in his abdomen. It did nothing, of course. Idiot. But the deductions continued to flow, faster than ever. A serial liar as well. Perhaps cheating? No, bigger. Secret tattoo, likely the name of a previous admirer. Unimportant. The locket she wore was clearly more so, maybe at the center of her lies. The initials, A.G.R.A. engraved upon its silver surface.
That, combined with the chill in the air which he knew S couldn’t feel, had him feeling just the tiniest bit envious of the dead.
“No idea.” S whirled away to inspect the edges of the room, ducking and leaning and all-in-all looking as ridiculous as John supposed a talking, texting, high-level-thought-thinking zombie ought to.
Perhaps that was for the best. Besides, he hadn’t confirmed his deductions. What if he’d made a critical mistake?
John blew out a sigh. “Look, I’m not exactly the foremost expert on baby names, and even if I was, I’ve no idea how old you are. You look about twelve, to be honest.” The corpse frowned at him. “How about I just call you ‘S’?”
The answer to that would take too long. He shook his head and tugged on his hand, pleased when the man stumbled after him. The fire escape was too suspicious now. They’d walk right through the door and out the back, so he could keep John close and maintain the ruse. No problem.
John fully intended to find his way back to the Citadel. He’d check to make sure his friends were okay. God, he’d even pulled poor Mike from his data analysis to join their medical salvage, and now he’d no idea if the cheerful man was even alive. The further he got from the room where he’d listened to the thoughtless beauty of S’s violin, the clearer his goal became. Get out. Return to the Citadel. Try to forget there was such a thing as a talking, texting, violin-playing corpse. Simple.
Lord, half of them had been in their twenties, barely tasted adulthood before they’d given it all up for the good of mankind. Or rather, partially for the good of mankind and partially for...some other reason. Something
welp, there's a new chapter. at long last. after....7 months? short version is simply that I quit my old job and went in an ENTIRELY different direction by starting flight school. good times.
“Thank you for your service, Lestrade,” he remarked, with just a touch of irony. “If you could just give me a few more details, I will allow you to get back to your life. Have a seat.” He gestured to the chair across from his desk.
“Shhhh…” One of the others shuffled closer. (Also dead. Everyone, dead.) She wore a bloody labcoat over a torn pink jumper. “Shhhh…” emerged from her mouth again.
John was far from helpless, of course. He could escape and dispatch this corpse, weapon or no, but that would leave him stranded here, hours away from the Citadel, by his calculation, with thousands of corpses in between. The odds were not in his favor.
He remembered close to nothing, himself. His previous life when he was, well...alive was a mystery to him. The only clues he had were himself, and even though he was thinking a bit more clearly now, his biggest blind spot was himself.
Shoving the other man backstage would not endear him to John, but it had been necessary. The man had put up with being taken captive, but he suspected having to watch his late fiancee’s brain being eaten in front of him would be the last straw. Last night had been one thing, but leaving the man alone during daylight hours was asking for trouble.
“Johhhnnn,” he moaned, trying not to stand out or draw any more attention to himself than he already had. He was surprised to find that he had to deliberately make himself sound stilted and guttural. Apparently John had helped him. Too bad he was unlikely to get an opportunity to thank him.
No better way to find out than to sneak a peek at the memories of the woman who had claimed to know him best. He took a bite.
--the blood and bruising on the ruddy column of John’s throat provided a chilling reminder. He shuddered.
Mary scowled. “Now who’s not taking this seriously?” She griped. “There’s no need to show off, John. If he’s got a broken wrist, he’ll be of no use in the city.” Billy whimpered at her feet.
Behind the stage, a maze of narrow halls led to a variety of dressing rooms, prep rooms, rec rooms, storage rooms, and even what appeared to be a gymnasium of some sort. He prodded John into one of the storage rooms and shut the door behind him.
John gaped as S swung the laden coat in a wide circle around himself, knocking corpses to the floor and giving them space to maneuver.
Still, without S, he’d never have found the beer. Besides, without the watchful corpse around, he might actually be able to get some things figured out.
But then the Crisis started, and the true lesson John learned was that there was always more fighting to do. It was the lot of a soldier, he supposed, to fight all the way to the grave.
‘Greg’ snorted, “Yeah, and the bitch that got him just got away. Like we should be doing, John!” He pointed at the window, where the fat man and the dark woman were already climbing out.
They were good at waiting. He had never much liked to do it, but that didn’t matter now. It was necessary. He gazed, nearly unseeing, at the far door, across rows of lab tables and broken microscopes.
Okay, you guys have been ULTRA sweet with your comments, and I love them, and I am coming around to reply to them soon, and THANK YOUUUU for being patient with me!!!
John looked at him, crouched there beside a gaping chasm in the sidewalk, those light eyes trained upon him expectantly.
A minute of quicksilver typing later, John was staring at a rather eloquently degrading paragraph of text detailing every way in which he was wrong. He hadn’t even finished reading the screen before S withdrew the phone, smug grin firmly in place.
Minister Holmes had clearly never been in the military, but then, neither had Mary. Mary had never taken orders well, and Mycroft did not give them. His strong suggestions and even more strongly supported arguments were enough to convince even the staunchest protesters of their own error.
What little shelter had been provided by the parking structure was rendered null and void now by the setting of the sun. Objects that must have been cars and buildings and such all carried a vague blue cast. He couldn’t see a bloody thing.
So consumed was he with his portrayal that he nearly ran into the dead man, who was now crouched beside a low wall and fiddling with a grate embedded into the pavement. Before John could ask what he was doing (which would have been Not Good, considering the various corpses within hearing distance), he had curled his fingers underneath the edge of the grate and lifted it.
He still could not confirm his conclusions, and his communication skills were as inept as ever. He might be able to write, but he couldn’t exactly remember. His body, the long-dead transport for his apathetic consciousness, remembered more than his brain did. He’d often find himself performing detailed tasks without really knowing why--dancing, playing the violin, picking locks.
Well, that wasn’t promising. “I’m not sure…” he trailed off, trying to decide how to interpret that. “You mean you were a murderer? Or were you killed, maybe? Or…” He searched for other meanings, but S just shrugged at him again.
The idea had come to him far too slowly really. He had disguised John as a corpse to protect him when they first met. The same strategy would (
“Fantastic,” he said, but now that the thought of what S had been like as a living, breathing human had intruded, he couldn’t get it out of his head.
He still suspected Morstan had been withholding information, but asking for more might have upset the careful balance he had struck. He’d been lucky enough to have not only a competent field agent capable of gathering intelligence but also her rather impressive fiance, whose medical expertise and war zone experience had made him a valuable member of The Citadel.
He nodded, then remembered his earlier determination to practice speaking. “Y-es.” Good, but more. He needed to push himself. “Three y-ears.”
John noticed what he was looking at and shuddered. “Lord, those clothes haven’t seen a washer in years. You’ve got all kinds of things to wear in here.” He held up a brocade tunic that looked to be roughly S’s size. S winced at the awful garment, eliciting another low chuckle from John. ”You’re telling me you’ve never bothered to try any of them?”
Admittedly, there wasn’t all that much to smile about, apocalypse and plague and downfall of civilization and all. The blank face turned toward him. “Doctor Watson, there’s been a change of plans. I want you and Doctor Stamford going with the group.”
He shook away the vaguely upsetting thought and held the door open wider, clearing his throat to try coherent speech. So far, his attempts had been sub-par at best, and he
John couldn’t help it. He collapsed into a fit of giggles. He was holding a can of beans, leaning against a door that was the only thing between him and a horde of corpses. Beside him was a friendly zombie who was hauling at least four cans of beans in his pockets and had used them to defeat said horde. It was absurd.
“What, ‘Mr.Zombie’?” He quipped rhetorically. “Yeah, thanks, I figured.” He continued to receive the creepy stare. “So what is it then?”
He was almost taken aback when the phone was returned to him. The message app was open and few words had appeared beside the flashing cursor. “Did you just try to text?” He asked in disbelief.
He nearly brained himself on the edge of the grate when S pulled him down to climb into the tunnel beneath the stage.
With this in mind, he settled in another chair he’d cleared, close enough to keep watch, but far enough to give John his space. The leather creaked under his weight, causing the other man to startle. He realized with a start that John could not see in the dark room. Apparently death came with a few extra vision perks.
The dark woman ran through the door, aiming a few last shots behind her, and wedged it shut behind her. “More coming. We’ll have to take the fire escape.” She gestured with her weapon.
The object in his hand was an innocent tin of beans, and even amidst the chaos and chasing and attacks, John found himself tackled by two rather unexpected sensations. The first was easy to diagnose: hunger. Beans sounded fantastic right now. The second, however, was some sort of shivering? Shuddering? He opened his mouth to gasp and what emerged was the smallest giggle.
To that purpose, John and Mike Stamford had been tasked with acquiring synergistic pharmaceuticals to strengthen the living population. The means by which Minister Holmes planned to introduce these new measures was above both their pay grades.
Greg cringed internally. Anderson was a right berk, but no one deserved the wrath of one, Sally Donovan.
The man reached out and grabbed his hand once more, tugged him forward a step, then tilted his head, those dark curls bobbing with the motion. The verdigris eyes narrowed to speculative slits. “Daanngerrrous.” And without another word, he turned his back on John and disappeared down the hole, leaving the grate open behind him.
S gnashed his teeth, trying to think of something he could do to communicate with the man without causing him to reveal himself. Boneys and corpses rarely talked. Until John, neither had he. He’d had little to say and no one to listen. But now, he was thinking and observing and remembering things like…
A minute or so passed as the corpse’s eyes darted about the room. He really was a curious specimen. John found himself warming to the concept of an independent study. Why did this corpse talk? Why hadn’t he eaten John?
When the yelling tapered off without John having gotten anywhere--he was stronger than he looked--he caught the short man’s gaze with his own. “F-ffinisshed?”
Other than Stamford’s crossbow and Billy’s knife, the rest of the party were carrying silenced weapons. A significant amount of training at the Citadel was devoted to learning stealth and stealth weaponry. Inability to stay quiet on a mission could mean death (or undeath).
Sherlock had been consumed by one of his mysteries at the time, chasing a shadow, a puppetmaster. Mycroft had been aware of it but could not afford to redirect his attention from international affairs. Sherlock was reckless, to be sure, but Mycroft had never imagined that he would lose himself so quickly.
He needn’t have bothered. More dead were coming, and the living had bigger problems. The grey man, ‘Greg’ pulled away and responded in a low voice, “Ta, still kicking here, but we need to go, John.”
“What?” He snapped irritably. The two of them stood just inside the heavily damaged main doors where they’d started. S got no further in his questioning as an unearthly shrieking split the air between them.
He seemed excited by the prospect. S’s mouth went dry. He shook his head guiltily, cutting off his excited patter. “What do you mean, ‘no’?”
Billy had carefully wiped the large blade on his trousers and nudged the head away with his foot, then turned and took no more notice of the thing as they reached their destination.
It was hard to argue with himself as the blood sang in his veins. The ticket stand loomed ahead of him, lit by streams of sunlight like a beacon of safety.
Before he could draw any conclusions, there was a scream. More dead streamed into the lab, drawn by the same scent that had brought him here. He heard the
Just as he suspected Mary had found herself a new line of work in the beginning of the crisis, John had quickly set himself to the task of aiding and protecting what was left of the medical workforce of London. But as he’d studied corpses, bandaged wounds, and dispatched threats, Mary had apparently been...what?
Mycroft sighed. “At ease, Lestrade. We are not a military operation, nor do I wish us to emulate one.”
An insistent pounding echoed from somewhere behind him. S’s eyes cut quickly toward the source of the sound before returning to John’s. “We need to go.”
“It’s only a sprain. I’m a damn good doctor. He’ll be fine. I’ll even wrap it if you’re that worried about it.”
S smiled at John’s disbelief. Even the daintiest ballerina had her vices, and S knew well that the men and women who danced upon this stage were anything but fragile.
John’s eyes widened above his pale hand, shaking his head and causing more blood to smear across his face.
It was an activity John took no pleasure in. As a doctor, he was constantly haunted by the knowledge that all of these supposed creatures were once (and likely still) human. They deserved respect and healing. Even the soldier in him winced at the desecration of the bodies post-mortem, although the practice certainly was not uncommon in war zones, even Before.
The room resembled every other classroom John had peered into as they’d walked down the hall. He’d no idea how S pinpointed this location amongst all the other rooms or even between the two buildings.
A smart, rich man who’d been bored often and obsessed with his phone. He was beginning to think he didn’t want to know about the man he’d been; he sounded like rather a spoiled brat.
He looked on with interest. Labcoat appeared to have been quite successfully well-fed. He tugged her sleeve and jerked his head at the door. It was time to go.
Labcoat was still backing away from the grey-haired man when he heard, “Greg! Everyone, sound off! Where’s Mary?”
He grabbed the bow off the table and put it to strings. It needed no tuning because, regardless of how empty his mind or elusive his memories, he always found himself coming back and playing. He hardly knew what he played, only that it made everything else fade away.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “‘Followed a few corpses’, Gregory?” He didn’t know why he continued to use the man’s first name, but the familiarity suited his purposes for the moment.
John wouldn’t let down his guard, but it didn’t take a genius to see he needed sleep. Maybe he was cold?
His eyes met John’s before reluctantly following the sound to its source. A hellscape of darkness and skeletons greeted him through the shattered glass of the lobby doors. No sturdy carpark doors this time. No rebar or cans of beans. There would be no cheating death and giggling in the aftermath.
He ran from the window and dove upon the man, who cried out in fear in spite of himself but still would not fight back, his eyes tightly closed.
John pounded on the door. It wasn’t so bad to get away from Zombie Cheekbones out there, but he was starting to get hungry. He turned around to survey his surroundings as his eyes began to adjust. He was holed up in what appeared to be a dressing room, complete with mirrors and make-up. There was a mini-fridge in the corner, but a quick check showed it had already been ransacked who knows how long ago.
He heard the other man let out a breath but ignored it, sinking into one of the last things that made him feel alive. He only stopped when he heard John shifting in his chair. He turned to see the man looking right at him, his pupils expanded to take in as much light as possible.
He finished his beer, setting it carefully beside the chair for later--who knew when a broken bottle might come in handy, especially when his only company was Mr. All-I-Remember-Is-Murder--and got up to investigate.
John sighed. “Look, I’m sorry I went out without you, but I was very hungry, and honestly, it’s been
He waited like a madman for that little voice in his head to pipe up, but it remained silent, and John again wondered if he was going insane. Pursued by zombies, hearing voices, befriending corpses, and here he was standing on the bloody sidewalk trying to decide if he liked it or not.
S recovered from his surprise and stepped forward again, his mouth doing something complicated that might have been an attempt at a smile. After a moment, he pointed at the phone again.
As S tapped on the phone, his eyes flicking between John and the screen, John pondered on the concept of communication and intelligence. It was often true that those gifted with high levels of intelligence had trouble making themselves understood, but this was quite an extreme case.
human. All the rhetoric of the damn crisis had gotten him to the point where even he had started treating them like animals, like objects.  This corpse had once lived a life, once been a man with impulses and desires.
Despite his general roundness and pleasant demeanor, Dr. Mike Stamford had an uncanny knack with a crossbow. To think such skills would have remained undiscovered without the crisis. He heaved the weapon over his shoulder and followed behind Mary, John, and a promising recruit, Henry. Billy Wiggins covered his back, followed by Soo Lin, Lestrade, and two guards from the wall, Sally Donovan and Philip Anderson. Minister Holmes was certainly right in that a capable group had been assembled.
John raised his eyebrows incredulously and straightened. “Right. ‘Course.” He unclenched his fists and walked through the door--and then was promptly left in darkness as it slammed closed behind him.
The shutters rattled and shook, the simple locking mechanism not meant to withstand such an onslaught.
“When you arrived at St. Bartholomew’s, did you see anything out of the ordinary?” He asked blandly.
John followed the motion of his hand with his eyes. S could really use a bit of extra weight on him. He looked painfully thin. Could corpses gain weight? None of the corpses he’d tested had seemed to gain or lose mass.
He smiled and turned to John, who was staring at their still-joined hands. “Jjjjjjohhn,” he forced out. He was not used to speaking. Labcoat had never required it, and honestly, he could not ever remember being too fond of it (or people) in the first place. But needs must.
, but I assure you I hold neither you nor your compatriots any ill will. I want the same things as anyone at the Citadel: the safety of its citizens and the swift destruction of those that might harm them. But I
He played until John’s transport gave out and he finally fell asleep, then played a bit more to accompany him into his dreams.
He snarled and grabbed the human from the shed and buried his face in that fragrant throat, rubbing his soiled cheek against the skin there.
He could not afford to be making mistakes like these. It had started with losing his brother, he reflected. Sherlock, the last person he had truly cared for, swept away, rendered insensible by the plague that had devoured the country.
S’s thoughts scattered when he saw the familiar white coat in the group of dead. He’d hoped to simply eliminate the threat, but he could not find it in himself to hurt the closest thing to a friend he’d had before John.
A dozen or so corpses shambled amidst the debris on the next floor. The moment S and John emerged onto the floor, all eyes were on them.
S was resettling the garment in question around his shoulders and did not even pause at the question. He just grinned and gave a pointed glance at his pockets as he directed his efforts to tugging the collar to a standing position.
The smaller man shrugged. “Don’t know if you’ve been paying attention, S, but we’re kind of in a zombie apocalypse. My phone won’t connect to anything. Don’t you think I would have tried that otherwise?”
Anderson seemed to be thinking along the same lines, but before he ran off to try to make amends, he turned to Greg once more. “The minister wants to see you, mate. Sounded important.” Then he was gone, leaving Greg with a sour taste in his mouth.
The dead were mostly occupied with the fresh kills in the room, but some had noticed the even fresher living man crouched on the floor beside his late bride-to-be. Of course, the short man was not entirely defenseless: he still held a loaded weapon (clearly better at keeping track of bullets than his deceased girlfriend), but as he watched, ‘John’ seemed to cave in on himself, unwilling to fight back.
S raised an eyebrow and nodded at him, as if following his thought process. He held up the phone with a mere two words on the dimmed screen.
, S thought grimly as he moved between John and an oncoming corpse. His coat swung and bumped his thighs at the quick movement.
Anderson shrugged. “Tried to warn you lot at Bart’s, but they came on so quick, it was all I could do to get back here alive.” Sally whirled away and walked ahead, seething.
“So someone shot through this window,” John said flatly. He was less than impressed. When S frowned at him, he continued, “We’re in a zombie apocalypse, mate.” He hurried on, trying to forget the weird taste of ‘mate’ in reference to the undead genius. “Bullets have been flying everywhere for the last five years. How do you know this isn’t just a stray shot?”
It was the longest sentence John had heard him utter. He even looked rather pleased with himself. But for a seemingly simple answer, it brought up some worrisome concerns. The crisis had started nearly five years ago, so S had been a survivor then. The tallies clearly marked days passed, hundreds of them.
If John had (privately) thought S looked rather cool wearing the coat it was nothing to the practically slow-motion glide of the garment swinging from around his shoulders--
Despite the calamity it had endured, Bart’s still smelled strongly of disinfectant. They had only encountered one corpse just as they entered, which Mary had quickly and quietly dispatched. Just to be safe, she’d allowed Billy to remove its head afterward, the two of them grinning ghoulishly at the sight.
He found the door he needed and opened it, but John was still standing in the middle of the stage, staring around at the faded splendor of the derelict theatre.
“Why?” John’s hands had finished their exploration of his neck. The skin remained unbroken, but he’d have a nasty bruise soon.
Certified genius, he’d bet. John regretted not having learned some sort of sign language simply for the purpose of using it to communicate with S in a less stilted manner.
The blonde woman nearly through the gates turned back, flashing a quick smile and readjusting her grip on her pistol. She stroked it lovingly as she waited to hear what he had to say.
John Watson had been through his fair share of scrapes. As a small, proud little boy with a querulous and overtly queer sibling, he’d been fighting, fighting, fighting since birth, it seemed. Medical school had been a fight against disease and exhaustion. The army, a true fight of violence and terror.
The corpse was still staring at him as if he could see through his eyes to the back of his head. It was creepy even without knowing he was dead. “N-not my naame.”
He didn’t need to survive, of course, but live music might have made his death more palatable. Though the store of symphony-ready instruments behind the stage went a long way toward appeasing that distaste.
In John’s studies, he had observed and discovered a number of things, but there had been no way to determine when a corpse had “turned”. Normal aging was effectively stopped, blood flow was stymied, any damage sustained by the body was considered superficial unless it destroyed the brain.
The fact that this was the word he remembered from his old life had always been a puzzle to him. He’d been walking around in a fog, unable to discern what was important and what was useless. No new information, just the one word, floating slowly but unhelpfully beyond his mental grasp.
John had been particularly vocal in his praise of S’s deductive skills. Even S’s own recovering mind knew that it was not normal for a corpse to function this way. He deduced he had already been rather a genius before he died (although the details of that life were still frustratingly elusive), so it should not have been any surprise to hear it confirmed by a living human. But it was a human whose opinion he cared about. A man he...cared about. And that man seemed...quite chuffed to be in his company.
He’d never seen this specimen before (thank God). He suffered a moment of rare relief that it had not been his Labcoated companion he’d found scratching at her face in the corner of the atrium. He supposed the humane (did he qualify for that anymore?) thing to do would be to dispatch the vulnerable corpse before the unfortunate transformation was complete, but John had little enough time as it was.
S raised his head, forehead crinkled in thought. “To...the start.” He sprang up from the chair and rushed out the door.
He’d barely been able to look at him. Months passed without any change from hunger and hostility. Treatments administered and failed. Mycroft had begun to consider putting him out of his misery--
S tilted his head to rest on the back of the chair and brought his hands up in their steepled, prayer-like pose again. “Safe. Known. Close.”
John stared right back as the full situation continued to bombard him. Bright side: he’d not been killed and eaten in the night. Of course, he was still trapped with a corpse inside a theatre surrounded by more corpses and--
S forcefully pulled himself from the memory, spitting out his mouthful of grey matter with horror and disgust. Was that what John had just seen? No wonder he’d fainted.
Of course it was dangerous. John was not an idiot. Going underground with a creature that may or may not be saving him as a snack for later was a terrible idea. But that
John seemed gratified by this answer but sincerely confused. “I won’t ask why because I’m betting I’ll get another shrug, but that makes sense. All of the specimens we denied nourishment or fed with alternate food sources went catatonic. The ones that maintained their…normal diets…well, they weren’t like you, that’s for sure.” He propped his chin on his hand and gazed at him. “What is it that makes you different, S?”
His straight-faced answer startled another laugh out of John. “Sounds a bit self-absorbed, if you ask me.” John eyed S, who was clearly struggling to be patient as he sat in the chair opposite. “Thought you didn’t know anything about yourself. How will me asking about it help?”
Holmes confirmed her suspicions. “We have reason to believe the Citadel has new vulnerabilities to chemical warfare. The corpses are as numerous and resilient as ever, despite your repeated raids.” He glared at Mary, as if the continued existence of the zombified human race were her fault alone. “If the threat is growing stronger, we will need stronger methods with which to fight it. I have already informed Doctor Watson of my countermeasures and he has assured me that they can be achieved.”
There was a pounding on the door. Labcoat was climbing out the window. He grabbed the locket from what was left of the blonde woman and began to crawl after her.
“S,” he asked, choosing his words carefully, “do you remember anything about who you used to be, you know…before?”
Post-mission files weren’t usually this depressing. People were killed, of course. Outside the walls, the odds were quite stacked against them. But half the party? Mycroft shook his head and straightened the folders so Anthea could--
"Oh... Well... Okay." There was a brief flash of disappointment on Sherlock's face, but it was quickly covered up. "A new start... Of course. If that's what you want, we can do it like that, sure."
Sherlock had lied. He said that this hadn't happened before. He said that they hadn't fought about this. John shook his head, tears threatening to start spilling over again. "And...?" He swallowed. "What happened?" He spoke without looking up. He felt betrayed. He knew this had to have happened... He knew that they weren't always as happy as Sherlock had said.
"I don't want to, but I think it would be better so you won't be reminded every time you look at my hand, you know?" Sherlock removed the ring from his finger, quickly attaching it to the chain he was wearing around his neck.
John groaned and forced himself into a sitting position, leaning against the bed. "'s too early t'go t'sleep."
"Well, I said that I would be busy and I was busy being dead. But I really couldn't tell you that, right? So I told you that I wouldn't be there because of your friends."
"Not about cases, no." Sherlock explained slowly. "You keep your journal there, though, but no one is allowed to read it besides you."
." He stepped back and sat down on Sherlock's bed. "Perhaps this is something we should sleep on?" He bit his lip. "Who's going where and all that?"
"I have no idea." He smiled and leaned in, putting his hands on Sherlock's shoulders, pushing him gently downward. "I just know that I don't want to leave Baker Street." He kissed him gently. "I don't want to leave you."
"Have you not heard a thing I said? He wouldn't go on and have a normal life. He wouldn't continue with his cases and save the world. He'd most probably start to take drugs again, slipping, he'd kill himself without you with the drugs and you know that."
Sherlock slowly opened his eyes, a dazed look on his face. John realized that he was probably just as shaken up by all this as he was. The detective sighed and sat up. "Her name is Mary Morstan. You found her through the clinic... She's a specialist in anterograde amnesia, apparently."
They took advantage of out-of-London cases to take vacations together, though they always had to be careful to keep their attentions to each other restricted to inside their rooms. But they got by.
John shook his head and swallowed roughly. "It's easier this way." He said flatly, and looked up at the bartender to ask for another beer. "This way it won't be a constant." John snorted. "Am I the
I had, up until now, a word document with the significant dates, but that ended up with me confusing myself and accidentally overlapping something. So I made it into an actual calender.
"Yeah..." He nodded slightly. "But I mean... I would be away from you." He swallowed. "And I don't think that would help in the least."
"I don't want you to think that I don't... I don't love you, Sherlock." He cleared his throat. "It's just... strange, coming into an old relationship like this. You know things about me in this respect, and I'm completely clueless." He leaned back on the counter. "I don't know what kind of a kisser you are, or... anything you like."
"Well look at that..." John bit his lip, grinning widely. "I never thought you were so romantic, Sherlock Holmes."
John took an extra large bite from the egg and put his fork down, thinking. When he swallowed, he turned his head to face Sherlock. "It didn't offend me... Not nearly. It just..." He paused. "It scared me." He looked down at his food. "It's just the reality of it all... The fact that I made such a big decision-and action- and that I forgot it."
John rubbed his hands together as Sherlock spoke, and some tears overflowed from his eyes. He sniffed, laughing slightly at his stupid crying, and rubbed his face roughly with his hands, getting rid of the wetness. "I'd do that, wouldn't I?" He chuckled. "I honestly would have punched you know, if not for the fact that apparently we've done all this before..." He reached for the other man's hand. "How many times has this happened?" He cleared his throat. "How many times did I forget you?"
John shook his head quickly. "No... The conversation started, and it needs to be finished..." He smiled shakily. "Besides, you probably should know what you're getting into if you plan to marry me."
He couldn't help but sign it so formally. He half wanted to just sign it "Watson" and be done with it, but he kept in his first name. Before leaving, he called the clinic to quit. Thankfully he got the message machine and he didn't have to try and explain himself to Sarah or any of his other co-workers.
"There is no need for you to explain yourself or justify yourself. Really. It's quite alright. You didn't want to wear it, so It's fine." Sherlock was obviously playing down the hurt he felt, and John didn't know how to fix it.
so many updates today!!! hehehe that's the good part of having it as an RP... You only have to edit it... No real writing required.
He took Sherlock's hand gently, running his hands over his fingers, coming to rest on Sherlock's ring, feeling the other man shiver in response to the touch. "I have an idea."
John stepped into the room, grateful that the light was off, and walked over to the bed, sitting down and leaning his back against the mattress. "So..." He sighed and threw his head back. "What are we going to do, Sherlock?"
Sherlock moved over to the small table inside the bedroom and searched for pen and paper. When he found it, he started to write.
"I'm not- I'm not trying to be." He retorted. "But you're clearly... You're on the street, Sherlock. That's not safe."
Also, as of yet I don't know /how/ to post it. I have it saved as a PDF, but I don't know exactly how to share it.
Sherlock moved a bit to the side, clearly worried about crowding John. "She screamed and woke everyone up in London when I walked in." He smiled. "After that she chased me through her flat with a pan, apparently sure that ghosts are afriad of dish soap, or something. Once I explained everything, she scolded me like I was her grandchild."
"I'd love a cuppa, thank you, John." Sherlock sighed and stood up slowly, following John into the kitchen. "Please just stay calm, okay?'
"I didn't say that it's better. But I thought that... If I'd told you all that, I thought you had enough reasons to just go. It was my last straw to keep you with me. I didn't expect Lestrade to tell you. But now you know about it and I know that I messed up, so just... I'll pack my things and leave." He murmured, turning his head to look at John.
It was past three by the time they pulled up and John slid out of the cab. He pulled out his wallet and counted out the bills to the cabbie, apologizing for taking him so far out. The man just shook his head as he drove off, muttering under his breath.
John smiled as he heard Sherlock's key in the door. Kind old Mrs Hudson from downstairs had been kind enough to help him cook for this dinner. Their first date, of sorts. In this life, at least.
John stared at the screen a bit. It was disconcerting to read his own writing without any memory of writing it. He scrolled back up to the beginning of the entry and squinted his eyes. "Eleven days since I forgot now." That would make it 6 November when he forgot that time. John bit his lip as he thought for a bit and stood up quickly, holding his laptop in one hand and grabbing a pen and paper with the other. He sat back down on the chair and scribbled out the numbers 1 through 7 - Sherlock had said that it was 6 times before this that he forgot, making yesterday number 7. He checked the date and wrote down "18 December" by 7 and jotted 6 November in the corner. He shut the journal entry and opened up the first one he had written, dated 20th June.
"Good morning, Holmes." Watson grinned at the bleary-eyed detective. "You seem to have missed out on some hours last night."
