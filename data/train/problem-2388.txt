, you're just an idiot. But you were in California, so you've heard of bisexual people and..." No, you know what. This wasn't working.
"So I'm helping myself to what's in the store and the cash register when the TV turns on. It's just a bunch of static, but it's an old TV, so that’s weird, but not-spooky weird. Then the
Dean produced one from his jacket, and handed it to Jimmy before shedding the garment entirely. His shirt followed, leaving him naked from the waist up. Jimmy carefully popped the trenchcoat's center seam, and then a lot less carefully ripped it in two. Scraps fell away as he cut at the suit jacket and pulled the white shirt down, laying kisses along the skin he revealed. Cas' wings – and they weren't wings, but it felt easier and safer to think of them as wings – interacted with Jimmy's face and neck like high-pressure water and got
“It’s ‘I have read and agree to the terms of service.’ No one looks at that crap,” Dean declared. “The
When she did, she leaned back in her chair, hugging her sweater around her more closely the way that she tended to when she was cold. “What are you trying to tell me, Dean?” she asked softly.
If Dean could see him right now, he would know that Castiel was fixing him with the same flat look that he gave people who thought blonde jokes were funny.
“Hell no!” he rushes to say, practically interrupting himself. “I am 6 ft 1 and have had a Sammy-sized amount of chick flick moments today. I am not answering that. Besides,” he argues, gesturing at Cas. “Angels don’t do that sorta stuff.”
“Please don’t act like this,” he practically pleaded. “You have to know I would never harm you intentionally. Being your soulmate—it’s not something I
“Nothing about you is a pretty sight for me,” Dean promises, stalking over, reaching the table in only five or ten strides. Briefly, he spots his brother out of the corner of his eye, hovering near the bathroom door, but he doesn’t let himself get distracted—not when he’s so close to getting answers.
I can already tell that this fic is going to test my Supernatural knowledge to the max, haha. So many Easter eggs.
“Yeah, well,” I size up what’s left of the amber liquid before shrugging. “That’s Future Me’s problem,” I tell him, realizing the obvious joke a second late—then snorting.
“No maybe about it. And Eileen knows all about monsters so…I’m sure whatever you have going on there will turn out way healthier than me and Cas.”
Sam sighs down at the bags of groceries that still need to be unpacked. He can figure out what’s coming. And it’s not going to be pretty.
you’re aware of my reputation. Have I adopted any shelter pets and let them loose in your house? Have I filled your car with ghost pepper-coated packing peanuts? Have I set up secret cameras in your bathroom and put the videos up on OnlyFans?”
“That and….” Castiel held the words in the space between his tongue and his upper teeth for a second before sighing. “How did you word it the other day? I’m going to sound like a ‘douche’ for saying this….”
“I have a meeting with my social media manager—” The two of them spoke at once, with the awkward bumping of two customers reaching the door to a coffee shop at the same time.
Cas pauses and any hope that I had he was just going to agree with me sinks to the bottom of my stomach like a stone. “You’re a very observant person, Dean,” he whispers, finally. “It’s part of what makes you an excellent hunter.”
“No.” He actually can’t think of a time he wanted sex less in his life. He just wasn’t sure how he would feel about Cas telling him not to.
“You mean he’s still around? I can meet him?” First a home, now he’s telling me I had other relatives. This was all sounding a bit too much like a djinn dream.
“Are you telling me that if you ran into Dean Winchester on the street—with those Disney princess eyes and those hot-as-hell bowlegs—and he asks to pound you into the mattress, you’d turn him down?” Meg scoffs in disbelief. Gabriel mumbles something under his breath.
I want to tell Bobby to can it with the whistling, but then I remember that this was the man who scared John Winchester away with a shotgun and decide against it.
He slid his hands up and down Dean’s back, feeling firm muscles first contract slightly and then loosen under his touch. “You’re probably right that a plan going forward is necessary, so… let’s work on that.”
That was stupid anyway. He knew Dean was at work—wouldn’t be able to pick up. He also knew that he was supposed to call Hannah in case of an emergency, but this was about as far from an emergency as it could get. A man that was not his father was claiming to be his father. It was non-news.
And yet, she can’t help but notice his little distractions—the way he watches the door when he’s not watching her face, the instant awareness he has that the waitress is approaching to take his order (“Still waiting for some people. Give us a few minutes?”), and the nearly-imperceptible jiggle of his leg under the table.
“Ben’s going to be okay?” Castiel asked after a minute, inadvertently knocking Dean with his knee. “You didn’t talk to him at bedtime.”
Anna and Gabriel exchange a look. “He wouldn’t bring it up on his own,” Anna thinks out loud. “And he tends to wear long sleeves, so people wouldn’t see it very often. But if someone asks about his name, he’ll sometimes mention it.” Well, that’s not going to help him narrow down suspects.
“Hell no!” Dean exclaimed as Castiel returned to the bed, the springs groaning under the weight of his knee. “Cas, you take that back!”
The other Me seems to sense my discomfort and quickly lets go but the two of them stay within a few feet of each other, the accountant—well, I guess the angel—looking over the other Dean’s body for injuries.
Jack had become the new god with a capital G, and Baby’s First Holy Act was to bring back all the people who’d been Thanos-snapped by Chuck. Then, he’d simply peaced out—something Dean still struggled to accept. How could Jack be hands-off when his surrogate father, the one who’d cared for him as if he were his own since before he was born, the one who offered his chance at happiness in exchange for Jack, was trapped in the Empty? Jack had told him it wasn’t possible to rescue Castiel, not right now. And to the kid’s credit, he did seem remorseful. But they’d all done the impossible a hundred times over. Castiel had been brought back from the Empty a number of times before. It was hard to believe that Jack had the power of all creation and yet couldn’t do anything. Dean tried to see him the way Castiel had seen him, and he decidedly loved the kid in his own way, but he sure as hell didn’t pretend to understand him.
Dean can’t speak. Can barely breathe. He’s spent his whole life watching people walk away. How can Cas look at him—just as damaged as the furniture downstairs—and see anything worth staying for?
“If you’re asking what the surprise is, that would defeat the point of a surprise. And if what you’re really asking is
Just as Dean’s sight started to return, a flash of light enveloped the room, forcing the brothers to shield their eyes.
“Uh, yeah, dude. Sure.” He laughs a little, confused. But Cas is smiling, still, so Dean just goes with it. “S’where I was heading before you hit me with a door, after all.”
Staring off into the night sky, Dean gives another nod, idle fingers playing with the edges of his worn leather jacket. “This is really the first time we’ve spent any length of time apart. I practically raised him after Mom died and Dad buried himself in his work.”
He tucks the phone into his pocket and unchains the bike. Swinging a leg over, he settles onto the seat and pushes off toward the sidewalk. It’ll be about half an hour before he gets home, but the breeze is light and the sun is still far enough above the horizon to make it a pleasant trip.
“Oh, I brought something new for you to try,” Cas says, reaching into the reusable bag he’s holding. He pulls out a long-necked bottle of dark liquid. “Blackberry honey wine. It’s made by adding honey to fermented berries. Should be lighter than the mead we had the other night.”
“To ask you to dinner, actually.” Cas keeps his tone light, just in case he’s read this entire thing wrong and Dean’s complimentary attitude had simply been the result of alcohol consumption and a flirtatious personality.
“Cas, this is my brother, Sam. Sammy, this is Castiel, my…” Dean pauses for the briefest time as he tries to find the word, so foreign to him when it should be so obvious. He wets his lips and finishes his sentence quickly, squeezing Cas’s hand tight and bracing for Sam’s reaction. “...boyfriend.”
references. They’d rewatched the original trilogy a handful of times already. “Guess that makes me the princess.”
Dean reciprocates with a smile and pulls back his hand, stuffing it into the familiar safety of a pocket but not before noticing the specter of the man’s touch lingering on his fingers.
He laughed then, remembering. “Oh, man. You shoulda seen Sammy, though. He’s a hell of a fighter but trying to navigate toy cars on a staircase in the dark? He fell on his ass so hard I thought we were gonna lose the mark. Claire was faster, though. She whipped in there and by the time these old knees got me to the room, Palpatine was ganked and the kid was saved.”
“No way, Sammy,” Dean said. He’d been pacing a groove around the map table, but stopped to cross his arms and glare at Sam. They’d been arguing about Dean making an appointment with Dr. Vallens, but he didn’t want some shrink poking around in his head. Didn’t matter that she understood (and was part of) the supernatural. The only way he’d been able to get those words out at all was currently sitting in the pocket of his jeans.
“Dean?” Castiel looked at him in dazed disbelief, pushing up onto one elbow. Despite swimming vision and only one good arm, Dean crawled over and wrapped him into a breathless hug. “Getting me out should’ve been impossible with the deal I made.”
and Cas has honestly never wanted to kiss someone so badly in his entire life. Right. He was on his way to try and make that a possibility before he assaulted the man.
The boy claps and stands up on the bed, climbing over Cas’s legs. Dropping the blanket, he unfurls his half-dozen wings, which settle behind him in a feathery cape as he steps into the pattern-printed pajamas Dean’s picked out for him. “I hope you like cars, bud.”
Jack gets in one more bounce for good measure, then plops onto his rear with a sheepish, “Sorry Unca Cas.”
Dean busts out laughing, having been played at his own game. “That stings,” he retorts, unable to resist one last quip before waving Cas over to the set table. “Make yourself comfy. I’ll snag us a couple of glasses.”
He can’t keep himself from grinning, all teeth and gums, as he brings the slice of his colony forward so Jack and Dean can see more clearly.
Thrashing as much as possible beneath the blankets (which is to say, not much at all) does nothing to slow the assault from Cas, who’s stronger than he looks. “Cas—haha—you son of a—ha—stooop it—hahaha—you’re gonna wake Ja—ack,” Dean laughs around the words as his body spasms out of his control. Only once he’s crying and red in the face does Cas relent.
While waiting for his burger order to finish cooking, Dean steps behind the one patron currently at the bar. A chalkboard sign advertises the bar menu full of craft beers, standard alcoholic fare, and “This Week’s Special: Angel’s Honey Mead.”
Castiel raises his eyebrows a smidge, skeptical of whether Dean is genuinely interested in the procedure or if he’s just lonely. “Yes. It’s quite the process, but I find it very rewarding. I get to have fresh honey at home and I get to make people smile. Not to mention there’s the environmental benefit to raising honey bees.”
Even Sam had gone off to spend time with Eileen after she rematerialized. And he’d agreed to bring Miracle along, at Dean’s insistence.
As the weak beam from Castiel’s phone reaches inside the doorway, he understands Dean’s caution. Shards of glass shine from several piles on the floor like tears shed over a casket.
The next act is a bit like karaoke but with dueling singers making up the lyrics as they go. Shortly after it starts, Dean gives another sideways glance and, this time, is surprised to find those vivid blues staring back.
“Hey, come on in,” Dean welcomes Cas at the entryway, gesturing inside to the warmth of the storefront.
Jack proceeded to relay the spell requirements in detail: leaves from a myrrh tree (easy enough), holy oil (also easy), some part of the angel’s earthly manifestation to draw him into their plane of existence (Dean didn’t like to think about this part, but he technically still had Castiel’s blood on his jacket), and a piece of human soul to bind him to their plane of existence. The last one was where Dean would come in. In order to extract the soul for binding, they needed to obtain a knife made of pure polished garnet and blessed in a very specific way. The blessing itself required some unique items they were going to have to track down. Jack gave them some hints, and Sam said he’d start looking into them immediately.
“Thanks, dude,” Dean says, then steps away, swiping the back of one wrist under his nose. “Alright, enough of the chick flick stuff. Who wants to try some deserts?”
Well, at that moment, the only feelings Dean had were destructive, and angry, and broken. This certainly wasn’t the first time Castiel had been wrong.
Gabriel plops the magazine on the table and raises both hands in defense. “Fine, you caught me. But you should live a little. You’ve clearly got a thing for this guy with the way you walked through that door humming and—holy shit—is that a homemade pie?”
, his hands coming up to wrap around Cas’ shoulders, and Cas can’t help himself. His grip on Dean’s hips spasms and he uses that leverage to push his hips against Dean’s with a growl. Dean
“I know it ended on a sour note, but I’m glad you decided to join us tonight.” He fiddles with the watch on his wrist and huffs a laugh. “I can’t imagine the scene Gabe would have made trying to get me up on that stage without you there.”
” and kicks a rubber stopper under the door to hold it open. Some early birds, eager to check out the town’s latest addition, have already gathered outside. Dean greets them all with a toothy grin as he takes his place behind the counter and offers up samples on a platter.
I’m still facing away from the two of them—and I’m pretty sure Cas’ voice is still directed at Sam, so it’s a plural “you”, not a me “you”—but I can’t help the way my neck suddenly tingles like I’m being watched. Even though the stove is in front of me, it’s my back that feels hot.
And with that casually-dropped bomb, he reaches over and taps Cas on the shoulder. “Can I get fries with breakfast?”
They featured Lisa in a pale pink dress with three flowered clips in her hair and Dean in a charcoal grey suit. They both were flashing shy smiles down at Ben, who walked between them in a button-down shirt and slacks.
She’d shown up on her doorstep an hour and a half ago in her favorite purple jacket and boots, saying “I’m kidnapping you” but providing no further details. Castiel had looked from the chapter he was writing—the one that was supposed to be Chapter 14, but which he was realizing should actually be Chapter 15, or maybe just be trashed altogether—and said, “Let me get my shoes.”
“I was going to tell you about Dean,” he promised, folding his hands into his lap. “I just… I wanted to know how
“Good. Now the rules. Aim for any green targets—whether on me or Sam or up on the walls in the room.” He handed Castiel a ridiculously unbalanced gun with scratches along the plastic grip. “If your shot lands, the little reader on here will tell you who or what you hit and how many points you got. Otherwise, it will just show you your total score. If you
“I think that ship has sailed for me. Cool Uncle potential only. I just meant that Jody and the girls should come over here more often to hit this place up for some lore. I guess, other hunters could stop by too. You know, as long as they’re trustworthy and won’t drink all the beer.”
“That kid eats half a burrito and he’s toxic.” - Dean insults Sam about this in "Yellow Fever" (4x06)
He closes the book. “I don’t want to do it like this,” Dean croaks, his voice surprisingly dry considering he’s finished almost half his bottle of beer. “If you want me to know how all that shit went down,
Dean’s body stiffens when I kiss him, and the rejection is like burnt coffee—everything that is wonderful about the kiss is drowned out by what’s wrong with it—and I pull away in utter shame.
Just like last time they were in the kitchen together, Dean is hyper-aware of Cas’s presence at all times—but, if anything, it feels less charged now than it was this morning. He’s not on high-alert waiting for Cas to do something that crosses into the inappropriate-for-friends zone because he’s already been there and bought the T-shirt.
“Wow,” Dean says and Cas winces. “Angels really have a kink for telling you to kill me, don’t they?”
For a minute, the author just sat there—staring at where he’d pulled his phone away from his ear—before finally placing it back, face-down on his desk.
“Come on, Cas… I wouldn’t… You know I wouldn’t. And besides, I thought that we weren’t pretending anymore. I think… a part of you knows that Dean isn’t quite as opposed to the idea of…well, you…as he appears.”
Dean leans forward, the pressure to convince Cas not unlike the need he sometimes feels to convince himself—that he did his best, that his intentions were good. “When you rebelled the first time—or maybe it was the second, you said that you did it for—for me, right?” he says, stumbling over the last few words. “I mean, I know you had other reasons, too, but--”
Cas looks at me, blue eyes wide and shocked, which makes sense because I’m basically volunteering to share my
Lisa wasn’t giving up though. “You’re with him every other day. And even when he’s not around, you guys are always calling, texting for hours.”
I casually look over my shoulder. My doppelganger is still out of sight making his call and the angel went to fetch us coffee—which is really just fuckin’ weird. But it means that this is the first chance Bobby and I have had to be alone since the barn. “What do you think of all this, really? ‘Cause I’m still wondering if we took a bat to the head somewhere. Time travel, Bobby? And angels? If they were real, why haven’t we heard of this happening to
telling me he was glad I didn’t betray you or whatever. Seriously—how do you put up with him so much?” Dean asked, turning to Cas with exasperated eyes.
“In any case, they’re not together, and I doubt they’re going to figure themselves out anytime soon.” Not that that had stopped me from trying to push them in the right direction at the bar the other night. But, like most Winchester-laid plans, it had fallen far short of the desired effect.
Her green eyes snapped back into focus. “I’m sorry,” she said, and at least had the decency to look appropriately sheepish. “You’re sharing something deeply personal—and potentially explosive—and I should stop treating it like it’s a TV show.”
Two seconds later, Anna and Aaron have appeared out of nowhere and each grabbed an arm. “We know you’re trying to take the moral high road and all,” Anna admonishes, as they steer him away from the locker room. “But there’s
Dean growls for what feels like the hundredth time, his wrist once again covered by his shirt sleeve but feeling exposed anyway.
Dean stopped moving, but left his hand where it was for a second. He waited for Jimmy to catch his breath and stop shaking. It gave him time to do the same.
Dean's jaw clenched and he squared his shoulders, trying to salvage what few shreds of dignity he had left. "You mind explaining to me." He wanted to shout, but didn't. "Exactly what the hell you were thinking there?" Even
"He doesn't, but..." Jimmy wasn’t finding the right words. A little annoyed, "Angel rest is complicated. Like, a more intense version of cuddling? Whatever that is?" He laughed, and brought his arm more tightly around Cas' shoulders. "Mostly it’s something you do with other angels, but seems watching you and me getting along so well qualifies."
Jimmy touched Dean's lips with light fingertips. "Do you still want my fingers inside you, beautiful?"
Cas reached back to adjust Ketch against him. "I would have expected more scar tissue, given your profession. You must have access to magical healing."
The phone sitting on the pillow crackled to life. “Right.” Sam sounded bossy. "Breathe in four counts, hold four counts, exhale for four counts, hold."
and you don't want it. Everything that should feel good about it hurts. And it keeps happening, but you keep finding yourself grateful to them anyway, because the
"Cas has - he's folded himself around all the places you said you could feel him. Supporting your back in kind of a - snowflake? That's where he is right now."
He was up the stairs and at the - well. It didn’t feel right to call it a landing. It was just the master bedroom, except there was no door. Dean and Cas just stood awkwardly next to each other in the middle of some insane architect’s floor plan. At least the
Dean looked away. He started to speak, changed his mind, and pulled Jimmy to him instead. His kiss was a timid thing. Jimmy followed his lead, until he gently broke away. "You want to wake up next to me. You could wake up next to me in the morning, middle of the night. Same thing. I'd hold you through a nightmare, and I'd hold you through a not-nightmare that's worse."
have is plastic wrap... and  you have a gorgeous ass, and I've never done it before, and I've always wanted to. But if it's too weird... there’s other stuff..."
Cas seemed to be repeating something, as undone and broken as the rest of him. It took Dean a few repetitions to make out "... thank you... thank you..."
"A window. The floor. My shoes. Some ugly curtains. A handsome man. That's five.” Dean was coming back to himself. Putting some space between them, he used a thumb to try and smooth out the slight, worried frown on Jimmy's face. "Your stubble. Your lips." Dean's hand explored lower until it rested on Jimmy's chest. "Your shoulders. Your heartbeat. That’s four."
Dean knew the vampires in Jimmy's head all had Transylvanian accents and capes, and the thought did make him smile. He was going to think about that. Because he wasn’t going to think about Alastair, and he
"Sam saw me in these things, didn’t he?” Dean touched the lace around his thigh. “Can we pretend it’s your kink? He won't make fun of you." No, actually that was stupid. "Forget it, the sexy costume thing isn't new. Sam’s probably just glad it wasn't the priest outfit."
"What am I supposed to do with you?” Jimmy ducked his head so all Dean could see was wild hair. “Other than just keep you in bed forever, I guess. But, ah. Not to be that guy. But the barbecue ribs downstairs smell
Jimmy reached up to grab Dean's hand, and just held it. "Yeah. And don't worry. I'll put a pillowcase on my head or something. It's not like he actually needs
, if he wanted to. He didn’t want to, not really, but the sheer novelty of the idea decided it for him.
"Cas?" Dean held his hand out. He didn't remember what happened to the lube, but this was his dream. Cas would have it because Dean decided he would. "It's not fancy massage oil, but it'll do."
Cas shifted his body, and this time his kiss was just above Dean's knee."You will have to tell me what that means, Dean. Keep your eyes closed, and only talk." An arm was curled around him, touching the planes of muscle on his chest.
"Whatever's in the duffle," said Sam, getting up. He cracked open the motel room door to snag the rubber doormat from outside, and used it to kick out the rest of the holy fire.
Cas fell against Dean's chest. He lay there for about ten seconds. And then dragged himself up, moving a little strange, like he was operating with a lag. He jerked open the chest of drawers and pulled out - yep. A spare blanket. Cas and the blanket both draped themselves across the bed, but the body that rolled into Dean's chest was Jimmy's.
Everything felt a bit dreamlike. More than could be explained by being in a dream. Dean's limbs felt warm and heavy and there was a pleasant tension to everything. Cas' hands stroked over his thighs and ass, his lace and stockings, and Jimmy's hands - now free - came around to cradle his back.
"I want to drive until we find a nice, out of the way spot where you can bend me over the hood of my car and fuck me so hard I can't remember my own name."
“You are children. Both of you,” Cas said. “You will not touch for fear of hurting one another, when you know that a touch would heal you.” He rolled into the well created by the two bodies, and wrapped one arm around Jimmy’s back, the other around Dean’s. Pulled them both to his chest, and held them there. Their breath rose, and then fell.
“Yeah, I -“ Dean’s voice caught in his throat. He could do this. He wanted this, damnit. “I can. Just give me a sec.”
"Now there's an idea. You were so good to me before, and you know how I feel about your hands." Dean spread his legs further to make his meaning as unambiguous as possible.
Jimmy reached out to draw Dean closer, pet up his stocking, stroke up his thigh. “I'm going to take these panties off, for Cas. Make things easier."
a big deal. So why did it feel like one? The words tumbled out in a rush -"You really want me to call you Daddy as a sex thing?"
Dean's tongue darted out to lick the pad of his thumb. Cas smiled, pleased. And then, because it was there, Dean sucked Cas’ thumb into his mouth.
"I’ll figure this out. I know what I'm looking for, just gotta find it. And if I can't help, I’m going to find someone who can, right sweetheart? We'll figure this out."
“I got good at kissing and giving her massages and things. But I never - and it’s not the same thing. I think I was sort of relieved, when I finally figured out about her and Roger, what's that all about? I didn’t think she’d leave because of Claire, and at least she was getting good sex somewhere.”
." He almost didn't want to say anything, but... "If he can do that, do you think he can stop your gag reflex? I mean, I don't... I'm not...."
"Any details you need me to fill in?" Dean was aware that Cas might take that as an invitation to find out everything. He hoped he didn’t. But Cas seemed more fascinated by Dean's skin.
And Jimmy got quiet, his eyes fixed on the image of his red, too-hard cock going into the slick warm heat of Dean's mouth.
Dean got his feet under him, trying to get some space between himself and the car. "Cas, I am doing the rock-bottom bare minimum here. Jimmy deserves so much more. And you, you're a literal angel. I don't even know where to
doing? Are you serious? You see who I have in my arms right now?” He surprised by how familiar this felt, considering this was the first time he’d ever held Jimmy like this. “How are
As if in response, Jimmy's body sat up. And it was strange to watch him struggle with shoelaces, but the tie was easier since Dean had started it. The coats joined it on the floor. And then Castiel carefully started undoing the buttons down the front of the dress shirt, a white tee showing underneath. "Does my vessel like
Jimmy had a moment of shyness, but only a moment. "We've got this picture of you taking off my tie and... tying my wrists with it?"
Sometimes Cas just said stuff like that, which took getting used to. But the reminder that something so far beyond his comprehension found him worthwhile was kind of nice.
"I don't really get off on calling people Daddy. I didn’t before. I don't know." He didn't know how to explain, not even to himself. "I um... I've never..." Did he really want to do this? He could always find something else. "I've never told anyone this but..." Lying beneath him, Cas found one of his hands, and interlaced the fingers. Dean held on, still too afraid to look at either of them. Cas probably wouldn't care, but Jimmy might. And the two were kind of a package deal.
Jimmy moved against his throat. Then very, very tentatively, brushed a kiss in the spot he'd been nuzzling.
It was strange. It felt like cool water darted through the marrow of his bones for a split second, just to be replaced by warmth. "I don't think I could do this for anyone else." Dean hadn't meant to say that out loud, but that was okay.
“He didn't start with the crown jewels, or I don't know, James Dean's Spyder? Some really good angelic sigils?"
"I'm sorry." Dean felt like he'd been completely wrung out. He wasn't sure he even could cry anymore. "I thought we could have normal."
And as soon as he knew he was allowed, Dean lost himself in open-mouthed kisses on shower-clean skin. He was hopelessly, helplessly turned on as he moaned into the skin of his lovers. They were going to get married. He was allowed.
"I think it needs to be you two, right now. Yeah. Okay. I want to watch you touch our angel. I think that's right. I'll be here, and I'll help things along if I can. It'll be his movements, but I can help."
"You help him to feel safe. He chose you. As long as that remains true, I will not allow you to hurt yourself."
The words went in his ears, but bypassed his brain entirely. The praise sent a current of electricity down Dean's spine, straight to his dick.
"What did you think about doing." Cas said it quietly, and didn't phrase it as a question. He probably knew, definitely suspected the answer.
Dean reached up to take Jimmy's hand from where it rested, and bring it to his lips, holding him close. He wasn't crying. But his breath still had that shudder.
When he moved into the bedroom, Jimmy was lying on the bed, against the pillows, one arm bent behind his head. Knees off to one side, but Dean could see absolutely everything, and he wrenched his eyes back to Jimmy's face, the bedhead and full lips and bright blue eyes.
"Clearly I got the best deal out of the three of us. But as fun as this is, I still want to talk to Cas."
Dean seemed to shrink into himself. Somehow the lacy undergarments were gone and he was in Sam's giant sweatshirt. He wriggled around, swathing himself in the red monstrosity.
The clean expanse of Castiel's skin was very close to Dean's face. If he got up on his knees, his cock would be at exactly the right level, they had stacked the pillows that way. Dean's tongue darted across his lips. It was all he could do not to reach out and touch him. But Jimmy had said no hands. So he waited.
as every inch of his hot and too-hard cock disappeared into Cas’ body, and he could feel the cool silkiness of the lube, and he could feel how tight Jimmy was, and how
Jimmy brought Cas into their huddle with his other arm. "He's exhausted," Jimmy said into Cas' hair. "He's pretending like he's not. But he is."
"I am sorry,” said Cas, after a long pause. “This is not the time to talk to my vessel about his family. He is afraid if he speaks to you at this moment, he may start to cry. I gave him a few images of your time in Hell."
Cas turned his head to kiss Jimmy, pulling his hair to tilt his face up. There was fealty in that long kiss. Then turned to Dean. Cas' fingers plucked the coat away from his face. He ran a thumb over Dean's lips. "Do I kiss you, beloved?"
Cas' face was still weirdly serene and hard to read. "If I thought myself capable of leaving a wounded beloved, I would walk into holy fire right now.”
okay. And so he pressed up, and kissed the only two people who'd ever had him at their mercy without making him feel helpless.
Then Cas shifted position, and began to pick through his hair in a strange motion that couldn't really be called stroking. It made Dean think of that one time he had to check Sammy’s hair for tics. The fingers on his scalp were very warm, almost hot, and it took him a second to realize Cas was systematically drying his damp hair.
"Hope," said a voice, one he now recognized as Cas.’ "The fire is not dead. There are lights in the darkness."
Dean wasn't sure if he was begging Jimmy for more, or asking Cas to let him look at Jimmy. But he was also really into the way Cas was holding him still, with his neck craned back just to the
that's sexy. But before you go..." Dean was still lying on his back, and undoing his pants as slowly as possible. Half way through, he paused.
but I don’t know if I’ll say the right thing. I’m not a therapist. Hey, wouldn’t that be great? If Castiel’s vessel was a therapist?”
" said Cas, his voice low and more like a growl, not breaking the rhythm he'd created, just a hair too slow. "My vessel says... your thighs... you're not a schoolboy anymore... I should stroke your thighs. Will you spread your legs for us? Just the smallest amount. Please."
, and grabbed Dean harder, pulling him closer. His head dropped onto Dean’s shoulder, breathing high and fast and shallow.
"It wasn't your fault." Dean kept his voice quiet and calm, and gently carded his fingers through the mess that was Jimmy's hair. "I swear. Wasn't Jimmy's fault either." There was fire on all sides, but Dean wasn't worried. They had a way out. They'd be fine.
. But he’d told Cas he needed to ask. Couldn’t immediately contradict that, that wasn’t fair. Dean wasn’t sure what he needed but at least he knew what he
"Did I ever tell you how he tried to say hello?" Dean felt Jimmy shake his head. He grinned. It wasn't every day he got to tell embarrassing stories about an angel. First he looked at Cas, to check.
Dean found himself leaning his face into Cas' hand without meaning to. "I'm sorry. Should I call you that? Is that what you were calling me? I'm a bit....confused, maybe? Hard to describe."
“Well, perhaps I will visit you some time—once you’ve determined your new apartment doesn’t have bedbugs.” A pause. “That was a joke, Castiel,” she told him, flatly.
Dean thinks, rolling his eyes while his back is turned to the others. “Look, we can answer questions over burgers just as well as we can trapped in here…I promise I’m not planning to pull one over on you as soon as the door is open.”
One that Cas had already brought distress to simply by being in Dean’s social circle. And now this blazing tattoo on his chest was probably going to upset Dean’s life even more.
“Found it upstairs,” he admits, propping it against the back of the couch and opening it up. The lock screen shows three people, arms around each other.
“No,” Dean said—too quickly. “I mean, yes. I mean, sorta…?” His voice kept fading in and out—a sign that he wasn’t keeping the phone close enough to his mouth.
An idea occurs to me that is almost irresistible. I remind myself that Dean is trying to help me out and that this would be an awful way of repaying his kindness. But on the other hand, I remember him telling me,
A few girls raise their hands amidst some dude’s snort—but the Professor quickly silences him with a glare.
That’s what Amara had said. But why God’s sister thinks I need the boy wonder version of myself, I have no idea. My eyes flick from the road—he can drive at least—down to my cellphone, scrolling through familiar contacts.
“So, last night, I was thinking…” Cas begins, and Dean’s calm evaporates faster than the butter he’s got going in his second pan. Quickly, he scoops another dollop in before placing an egg-coated slice of bread down.
I glance at the younger Dean. He seems uncomfortable. That, more than anything, has me questioning what I’m doing.
And there were other Charlies and Dorothys out there—other Deans, whose dads called guys they didn’t like ‘fags’ or ‘fruit loops’ and asked what the world was coming to when they saw two guys holding hands on TV.
. Just last week—a couple of badges came by my casino because they heard that I had been illegally importing the fruit for my cocktails.” The most confusing part of this is that Gabriel sounded delighted.
“Actually…” Castiel began. “My cousin, Gabriel’s coming out in two weeks. Considering I’m unlikely to survive five days of trying to entertain him myself, any distractions you can provide would be appreciated.” He paused. “I should probably warn you that he might literally blow up the door if he thinks that’s the easiest way of winning.”
"I will. But you and Sam, you're the ones that are still standing. Even Cas and me needed a respawn. Which is why I'm really glad
Dean decided that the best way to make his point was by example. "Here, I'll go ahead and tell you some things I don't want. I don't want to be hit, and I don't ever want to feel like I can't breathe. I don't think I’ll ever want to be called dirty, or a whore, or anything like that. But there are some things I might ask you to call me? I don't want to have my neck restrained. But uh... if we had the right equipment I think I’d be okay with being tied up, depending on how we did it?” Dean paused. ”That help?"
“...only live around seven weeks, but in their lifetime, they fly a distance equal to one-and-a-half times the Earth’s circumference. And yet, each bee only generates around one-twelfth a teaspoon of honey in that time. So it really takes tens of thousands of bees to…” Castiel turns around to make sure his companions are still following him and what he sees stirs a funny thrumming in his ears that has nothing to do with the workers whizzing about or the drones busy behind him.
Sam reached out a hand. “Hang on. Billie once said she would toss me and Dean into the Empty when we died. Doesn’t that mean humans can stay there just fine?”
Dean softens, thinking himself foolish now, but absolutely distracted by the fact that Cas is basically holding hands with him.
“That ain’t true, Chuck!” he calls, jogging after her so that they both reach Baby at the same time. She shoots him a dry look over the top of the car, a bitch face to rival the best of Sam’s, one eyebrow cocked in disbelief. He grins at her, letting his dimples out in full force. “Why’re you asking me to come with you if I’m so lame, huh?”
Cas rolls his eyes and shakes his head. “Gabe is a hopeless flirt and a sadistic jokester. But he’s one of the most tolerable of my siblings and he’s been there when I’ve needed him.”
Dean isn’t sure what he had been expecting other than maybe a small building with some plush seats and a wooden stage surrounded by velvet curtains. But as he walks up, he finds that the theater is really an outdoor amphitheater with a covered stage and seating area. A half-dozen food trucks line both sides of the grounds leading up to the rows of plastic seats.
“I apologize if I overstepped. You just really looked like you could use a hug.” Cas moves to open the door.
A tense moment passes before Dean snaps closed his shocked mouth and all of the defensiveness he’d been building deflates. He’s heard Cas warn Gabe about his joking and he’s heard him put on his parenting voice with Jack, but Dean has never seen this commanding side of Cas.
“Wow, okay.” Dean looks to the bed again where Chazaqiel—seriously, what a name—has curled up inside the blanket, head poking out like an animal from its burrow. “Chaz, can you speak, or…?”
He went quiet for a few moments, considering all the things humanity tended to measure in months. They weren’t exactly capable of imagining literal eons, and didn’t live that long anyway, so people tracked the monthly passage of time as a milestone after the birth of a child, an illness’s remission, or the start of a relationship.
Sliding his hands up Dean’s broad chest, Cas leans forward to cage their mouths in another kiss, hungrier than the last, hips grinding with the movement and drawing a whimper out of Dean.
“We’ll just have to make this a regular event, then. Besides, you’ve got another…” Dean pauses to do quick mental math, reaching behind him and picking up the wrapped pie. “...ten
Cas hesitates, looking at Dean like he’s trying to find a crack in the compliment. “You’re teasing me, aren’t you?”
He popped the cap off a bottle of painkillers and tossed a couple into his mouth, taking them down with a gulp from a water bottle and scoffed. “I can just imagine the stink-eye you’d be given’ me right now if you were here. Probably make that annoyed squinty face you do before using your superpowers on me. But man, I’d be lyin’ if I said having an angel for a best friend didn’t have its perks.”
“I will treasure this memory until the end of my days,” Gabe says, wiping tears from his eyes and setting the phone on the table. He moves to stand over his supine friend and extends an arm to help him up. “Need a hand?”
“You’re, uh— you’re welcome,” he replies, clearing his throat again to cover the break in his voice. “Go on and eat your food before it gets cold.”
One of the singers on stage steps too close to a speaker and the unbearable screech of feedback reverberates over the audience. The crowd collectively covers their ears and groans. The song ends and the performers hang up their mics, the one who’d caused the ruckus mumbling apologies as she goes.
Dean sniffles again and swipes two fingers across the wetness on his cheekbones. He laughs at the blurry image of Cas in front of him. “Would you believe me if I told you that the answer is ‘nothing’? ‘Cause I’ve got this dream of mine coming true and… I’ve got you here with me at the center of it. I’ve never had something like this before. Doesn’t feel real, ya know?”
He didn’t need the recording to remember the speech, though. Just as the Enochian warding had once been engraved on his ribs, Castiel’s last words were seared into the grooves of his brain. They spoke for themselves.
” with a partying smiley face. Castiel types slowly, but he wants to make sure his messages are accurate and free of typos. Scarcely has the address been sent when another message comes through.
Dean takes his place and taps his feet ahead of the music, wishing for a pair of cowboy boots. Cas, the poor guy, seems fit to take flight. Dean gives him two thumbs up for motivation.
Moving their bodies to the song at Cas’s lead, Dean giggles as Cas sings with giddy vibrato into his ear, “
Jack starts to sound out the next step in the recipe displayed on Cas’s phone. He struggles to pronounce the word ‘chocolate,’ so Cas helps him read the rest.
and watches through the window as large snowflakes bathe every outdoor surface in clouds of ice. He takes a seat in one of the booths and waits for Cas and Jack to show up, trying not to worry about them driving in the oncoming stormy weather. The wind howls like a banshee, tumbling furiously between tree limbs and around cars, over rooftops and through gutters, bullying the snow into flurries.
In an exaggerated motion, the fork takes a chunk of pastry and apple filling past his lips, sliding back out with just as much sluggishness. Cas chews and hums an unnecessary note of deliberation.
to apologize, even if Cas doesn’t hate him for what he said. So he forces himself to keep eye contact and takes a deep breath.
“Oh, no, hot cocoa is great!” Cas says, picking up a mug and holding it up to his face in both palms as if savoring the heat.
The Rowdy House club,” he says, poking at a patch of gold glitter still stuck to the side of Gabriel’s neck. “Because this is from arts and crafts with Jack?”
A few hours later, Castiel sits on the white porch swing with Jack on his lap, using the tips of his shoes as leverage to propel them both forward and back. Upon what Castiel figures is probably the 5,874th swing of the morning (at Jack’s insistence), he hears the rumble of a powerful engine and correctly surmises that it belongs to Dean’s sleek classic car before it makes itself visible, turning down the drive toward the farm. In the daylight, the impressive gleam of the Impala reflects the fall foliage lining the pathway as it comes to stop neatly beside Castiel’s truck.
“Very good,” Cas approves. “I’ll be the only one to touch the hives. Also, no running around like crazy and if any part of being out there frightens you, make sure you let me know. It sounds cliché , but bees can literally smell fear. That said, they should be fairly docile since it’s almost winter.”
Dean sobers. Jack is probably worried that their pet is stuck out in the storm. He ruffles the kid’s hair. “Don’t worry, Jack Attack. Gabe’s watchin’ him. He’ll keep him inside, right Cas?” Dean knows the answer, but figures Jack may need the reassurance from agreement nod as well.
“That’s an interesting name. Is it Spanish?” Dean imagines lounge chairs and sunset cervezas on some distant South American sand.
Finally serving himself, Cas refills his coffee mug, then doles out a few pancakes and a good portion of the remaining fruit onto his own plate. He takes his place at the table and drizzles a few light stripes of syrup over the golden circles before carving into the doughy goodness. “Are you ready to see Uncle Gabe later?”
Smiling fondly then, Dean was flooded with remembrance of his angel, the good times and the bad. Everything they suffered together. Everything they overcame. Castiel would want him to focus on the happy moments. He’d tell him that the bright spots, though few, were so much brighter because of all the darkness.
“When you said all that stuff about me, when I realized what was happening,” his throat constricted at the memory but he pressed on, “it was like I’d been caught in Jell-o or something. Everything was slower and way too fast at the same time. I couldn’t do anything but stand there and be useless while you poured your guts out to me.”
Cas moves both hands into Dean’s hair and rains kisses on his temples, his forehead, his nose, his chin. Forehead-to-forehead, they catch their breath together for a few moments before Cas gives one more quick peck to Dean’s lips and settles down beside him, draping an arm over his heaving chest and snuggling close. Dean wraps his arms around the other man, completing the circle. They lie there in comfortable silence for a while, enjoying the come-down.
“You were?” Dean whispers, a soft look flitting across his features, before it twists into a sort of sarcastic smile. “To kick my ass?”
, and suddenly, Cas has to pull away before his office ends up holding memories that will make it impossible for him to accomplish anything
“Give it a rest, Winchester. You had fun,” Charlie says. “Now, go sleep on the couch or something. I need my space.”
“Oh, hush. I love you, and you know that.” She scoots across the bench seat and smacks a kiss on his cheek, gripping his head dramatically as she does and making a loud
“He does not need to—” Cas stops mid-sentence. After a few seconds of thoughtful staring between the two celestials, he turns back to Dean. “He does not
Then where is Cas? Why would he leave without saying a word? The sick part of Dean tells him that Cas probably regrets what happened and couldn’t have gotten away fast enough. Another surge of uneasiness roils his insides as he realizes that he can’t even call Cas now with his broken phone and the contact number stored there.
Gabriel pulls another prompt from the box. “Well, here we go. This is a new one. An old country line dance! For this part, I’m going to need eight victi— I mean volunteers.” He hops down from the stage and dashes between the rows, high-fiving a half-dozen people before making his way back toward the front. He stops in front of Cas and Dean.
He stopped by once before his morning class to try to apologize, but he couldn’t build up the courage to tap on the door. Dean’s still fucking terrified.
When Gabriel returns to his place on the stage, he directs the participants to stand on taped X marks set up in two rows of four, staggered so that each person faces their partner with enough room to circle one another.
With his chin cradled, Cas lifts his hands to overlap Dean’s fingers and presses into the touch, closing those gorgeous blue eyes that remind Dean of a cloudless summer sky. Unable to resist the opportunity, Dean pulls his lover’s face forward and plants a soft kiss onto even softer lips.
Jack takes Dean’s hand and tugs him outside. Dean tilts back to face Cas as he’s pulled along and shrugs happily. Cas smiles behind his face net and follows close behind.
“Cas, buddy.” Dean’s voice shook. “Say something...please,” he implored, face pallid. There was a pounding in his ears and he suddenly couldn’t get enough air. The room swirled and tilted sideways in a nauseating whorl, vision going dark from the outside in.
And it isn’t only their day job that poses a problem—they are a far cry from a functional family unit. Cas always does that disappearing act of his and Dean… well, his head isn't much more than a bucket of loose screws at this point, with all the drinking and the daddy issues and the self-deprecation. As much as he might have once wanted it, he knows he’s no fit for fatherhood.
Gathering his clothing with clenched teeth to keep them from chattering, Castiel sneaks out of the room and tiptoes down the hall to the bathroom where he dresses and splashes some water on his face. Pointedly ignoring the dark circles beneath his sleep-deprived eyes in the mirror, he pats his face on a towel and cleans up the supplies from their first-aid-turned-makeout event a few hours prior. Dean’s two paper whisky cups lay scattered on the floor, casualties of the foray; Castiel relocates them to the wastebasket beside the toilet.
Cas throws his head back and downs the rest of his mead. He stands as the crowd cheers him on. “Assbutt,” he mutters grumpily in Gabriel’s direction, and his brother has the audacity to pat him on the back, gloating.
With a fresh piece of sterile gauze, he wraps Dean’s wrist as reverently as one would a cherished heirloom.
With a conspiratory smile, Dean beckons Jack around the corner. “Alright, hang tight right there for just a second, okay?”
Cas bobs his head in affirmation. “There aren’t many kids his age in the area, so it’ll just be me and Gabe.”
“Today is the six-month anniversary of the day you...well, you know. That probably doesn’t mean anything to someone who’s been al— around as long as you,” he’d almost said
” Dean rolls his eyes affectionately as he ascends the front steps. He’s normally the one to play mother hen, but it’s cute that Cas cares.
“And then— and then I watched you go. I didn’t even try to stop you. Why didn’t I stop you, Cas?” The tears were back. So much for not crying. “Why couldn’t I tell you that I—”
When all was said and done, Jack wished them luck and asked them to give Castiel his love. The fire faltered and blew out, leaving only a broken map table as evidence of the godly presence. Sam and Dean stood quietly, processing.
“They caught me in the barn kissing the neighbor boy.” Cas sets down his fork. “They told me my ‘rebellion’ meant I wasn’t welcome in ‘their’ home any longer,” he elaborates, bitter air quotes forming as he tells his story to the croutons tucked into their spinach and chard beds.
Socks slipping on linoleum, Cas skids into the dining room after Gabe. His asshole of a best friend—who apparently thinks he’s in an action movie—throws a dining chair into Cas’s path so he can’t immediately follow him around the table.
Castiel tugged something out of his pocket and extended his free hand. Face-up in his grip was his cellphone with the screen unlocked.
Cas recites the phone number quickly. Tapping away at his phone to enter the new contact, Dean looks up just in time to see Cas lift lashes from a staring contest with his shoelaces.
“Four, Saturday after next. We’re throwing a party for him in the afternoon. Would you like to come visit? I could show you the bees.” Cas taps his fingers on the counter expectantly.
freckles. He’d always had a weakness for freckles. And those wide shoulders, practically forcing their way out of the dress shirt that covered them, with a torso that tapered into slim hips and the cutest damn legs Castiel had ever seen? He’d never stood a chance.
Dean groans and slides his face away to bury it in Cas’s neck. “If you keep it up with the Spanish, we’re never gonna get
“Don’t move,” Dean threatens, a dark edge to his words that makes Castiel believe Dean’s had to use that tone before.
“Does it have those giant screens and reclining seats or are we talking about a dollar theater experience?”
“Dean,” he said again, though he didn’t answer the question. “You frightened me. I thought I’d come back just to watch you die.”
From the deep-set medicine cabinet, Dean withdraws a first-aid kit and a stashed bottle of whisky, setting them both on the counter. Ignoring the world-class stinkeye in response to his preferred therapeutic treatment, he hugs the bottle to his chest and opens it with his free hand. Two disposable mouthwash cups are pulled from the dispenser beside his toothbrush and he fills them like shot glasses, downing one on the spot. The other he holds out to Cas who takes it only to set it aside, reaching instead to grip Dean’s hand and unwrap the makeshift bandage.
“Dean, wait. Would you...like some company on your way home? I’m headed the same direction.” Castiel grips the handlebars and pushes his bike closer.
He wants to say that Castiel isn’t the only one who has fallen. That he’s not alone and that Dean has faith in
“Unca Gabe!” Jack tears off toward the house, interest in the bee tour dried up at the prospect of presents, playtime, and the candy Gabriel probably plans to sneak him when he thinks Cas isn’t looking.
In the background of the call, Castiel hears—what seems to be a rather large group of people—erupt into cheers. He and Gabriel make bewildered eye contact over the kitchen counter, though Gabe appears to be trying
Eyes watering with frustration and shame, he sinks further into the bed linens, starting to cocoon himself away from reality when the sound of his door creaking open sets him on high alert. He’s not sure why, but seeing Cas walk through with a to-go bag, a coffee cup, and a gummy smile is the last thing he expected.
“On your birthday, you get to have the fanciest of pancakes. Want some juice?” Castiel gets Jack’s favorite plastic cup from the cupboard and pours apple juice from the fridge. Adding a color-changing silly straw garnish, he sets the cup on the table and ruffles the kid’s messy brown hair in affection. This early in the morning, the boy’s hair looks like he’s stuck his head in a wind tunnel.
“That’s the only way you could possibly improve on such a lovely flavor,” Cas says, taking another bite with more haste.
Flicking the blinker, Dean maneuvers the Impala up the sloped driveway leading to their podunk motel. “And if he’s going for human, what’s with the wings?”
“Bitch!” Dean mutters softly, so as not to be overheard given their present setting, and kicks at Sam’s shins in a move his brother’s giraffe legs easily avoid.
Slumped against his headboard, Dean pulled his laptop open. Fuck it. He knew watching the recording again would drive him to ditch his beer for the hard liquor, but he needed to see that care-worn face again, however brief. Needed to hear those words of encouragement, despite their inevitable conclusion.
Dean takes a swig from his cup. “It’s stronger’n I expected, but I dig it. Makes me feel like a viking.” He strikes what he thinks is a heroic pose, earning him an amused smile from Cas.
They sit in wordlessness for a while and Dean swallows a few times, seeming to work up the nerve to speak. When he finally does, it isn’t at all what Castiel expects.
The first beer was just to get his brain to slow down a few paces, to quiet the incessant thoughts filtering in around the silence of the bunker.
Dean pads outside while Cas puts the kid to bed, pantomiming a phone call as he holds up his cell. He’d gotten that feeling again, that feeling of
Gabriel watches Castiel’s face change from concerned to worried. He knows that look all too well. “What is it?”
“Alright, kiddo. Settle down before you fall down. Let’s go inside,” Gabriel says to the child-shaped halo above him.
“And here comes dessert,” Dean says as he gets to the top of the stairs, carefully balancing the tray of goodies. He walks steadily over to the coffee table and sets the tray beside the DVD folder. “I know it’s a lot of sugar, so if you’d rather a cup of water or something, lemme know.”
Ominous clouds roll in, blanketing the endless road stretching before them in a gray pall. Dean clenches his hands around the Impala’s steering wheel. He’d hoped to beat the rain on their way back to the motel, but the summer storms had other plans. Soon enough, the sky darkens and what started as a smattering of droplets turns torrential.
Glancing down like he’d completely forgotten about the two items in his hands, Dean sighs, a cloud of warm breath pluming from his mouth. “It’s probably easier if I show you.”
Dean was probably only imagining he could feel Cas. But he closed his eyes and let himself pretend. "He sounds pretty."
"Hey..." Jimmy tucked his knees under him as he sat up. "I've got Cas, and now Sam it sounds like. I’ve got you. I’m safe.”
"Yeah? You haven't seen him lie to my face yet. Not as good at it as he thinks. But all you can do is wait him out until he tells you what's wrong." Dean got quiet. Jimmy had seen Sam rip a man's throat out with his teeth during that mess with the demon blood.
" Dean held up a Stanford sweatshirt that was probably the biggest size they made. “This thing could probably fit two people. Like. Two human people. Not a vessel situation."
"Don't have to ask every time. It's... sort of a dance? You'll figure it out. You can use touch, or just your eyes. But if you're not sure, words are probably safest."
Without further explanation, Dean strode to the nearby door and flung it open with too much force. It led to a bathroom, not a closet. Without saying another word, Dean walked in. Shut the door. Started the water in the shower, left the lights off. He didn't give the water time to warm before stepping under the spray.
"I'm sorry Dean. I wish I had an answer to give you." A slightly bitter edge to his pack-a-day voice. "I wish I had
Dean could feel himself stirring. He wasn't sure if it was the mental image, Castiel's voice, those strong arms or some combination of all three. Whatever it was, he was grateful it was working.
"I want both of you,” said Dean. “I don't care how. I want to let go." Held in their arms like this, he felt safe enough to
. You’re like one of those sexy calendars. You don’t have to thank me for wanting to take it all in."
"I might have gotten off to the idea." Dean had been thinking about Cas at the time, but close enough. Same ass. "It's okay if it stays just another fantasy."
Cas took the finger out of his mouth and curled it into his hand, an unconscious come-hither gesture. "You could help."
Dean stood, and started searching for towels in the cabinet. If he was going to be camped out in here for a while might as well get comfortable.
Oh… kay. He still couldn't figure out the plan here, but Cas wasn’t going to hurt him. So Dean kept his eyes closed. Waited to see what would happen.
"I don't know what the hell I'm doing here. I really don't." Jimmy muttered into Cas' skin.  Laughed. "Probably shouldn't have said 'Hell' right there. Insensitive – "
He closed his eyes and told himself that the world was already ending, it wasn’t like he could make things much worse. A hand came around his back, but Cas stayed quiet. Dean held on and took slow breaths and tried to tell himself he was allowed to have this.
And before Jimmy could answer, Dean kissed him. He misjudged slightly, and it landed a bit to the side. He kissed the other corner like he would bracket a target, and then kissed Jimmy properly. "Cas and me are supposed to watch over people like you. Fight the stuff that wants to hurt you so that you sleep at night without having to think about it. And we're supposed to have each other's backs, and make sure we both get home okay. So you promise me you'll let me know if whatever is going on with Cas gets worse." Having finally said what he came here to say, Dean came down for one more kiss. But this time, Jimmy turned his head to avoid it.
And yet, in spite of the illusion that the bird changed position from one moment to the next, when comparing his picture to the one on his computer screen, the two images mirrored each other exactly.
“Do you remember how much trouble I had navigating the studio the first few weeks?” Cas mentioned to Dean dryly as he stepped onto carpet so pillowy, he could feel it through his shoes. The actor nodded, a smile already lurking around his lips. “It was like that. But that’s the
Cas figured that the question was rhetorical, so he didn’t bother answering it. Instead, he switched topics. “Crowley implied he wouldn’t give this photo out as long as I didn’t provoke him. But I find it difficult to trust his word at the moment.”
“Look some options up if you want,” Dean responded, mouth already half-stuffed with popcorn. “S’long as it’s still got built-in recliners.”
“Look,” Dean sighed, the gust of air he let out brushing more of that tip-of-the-tongue spicy scent past Cas’s cheek. “I’m not sure how much this
“I think that maybe… she’s been really lonely,” Castiel explained, guilt inflating like a balloon inside of him. “My father left. Bartholomew didn’t work out. And she’s too abrasive to have many friends. Perhaps, with me gone off to a different state, she just wanted companionship… and now that’s ruined too.”
A second later, Cas appeared, blurry-eyed, with the best case of bedhead Dean had ever seen, and fucking hell, he couldn’t love this bee-loving, emoji-using, absolute dork of a human being more if he tried.
“I want… I want to know that I’m not all alone over here,” he stated, voice desert-dry and crumbling. “That if I’m going to make an ass out of myself tripping over feelings for my soulmate—the
“Not sure. Any time Sammy or I have suddenly gained powers, it’s not been the best thing, you know? I mean, a forcefield wouldn’t be bad or I could be that Nicholas Cage character from
the one you got to watch out for. That girl loves loading people up with the frou-frou girl drinks and roping them into Truth or Dare or some other sorority-game shit.” Castiel couldn’t help but wonder exactly what she’d dared Dean to do—and whether or not there was video footage.
Cas dropped his tea mug on the counter awkwardly enough that it tottered in place for a few seconds before settling. But by then, he’d already made it across the living room.
“Holy shit, Cas,” Dean exclaimed, his warm hand going to Cas’s side. “Hey, hey, it’s okay. I’m sorry, it’s okay,” he murmured into Cas’s hair.
“OK, that’s it for today,” Professor Mosely announces, glancing at her watch. “Assignments for next week—I want all of you to start a dream journal. A full page every morning right after you wake up. If you can’t remember what happened, choose a detail from another day, and consider what this might have to do with your significant other. We’ll be switching journals with a partner later.”
all their unresolved sexual tension already, he has to admit that the adjustment has been more uncomfortable than he thought it would be. Not long ago, he’d barely seen the angel wearing any less than three layers and now he’s in nothing but a pair of Dean’s sweatpants, his hair looking fucked all ways to Sunday.
“Not because of your mark or because Dean doesn’t trust you,” the other man was quick to specify, as if he was seeing directly into the paranoia in Cas’s mind. “It’s just—you deserve to be the one to tell Dean that you’re soulmates, and Dean deserves to be the one to tell you about his thing, okay? It’s not my place to meddle,” Sam declared. “…
“The plot thickens. Since your phone still works and has all its contents, that means that someone took out your SIM card—probably to copy it—and then left behind the copy, not the original. They could only do that if they had physical access to your cell.” She flinched slightly, “If that’s the case—”
And yet, just as I’m savoring this minor victory, he shakes his head. “Cas couldn’t have done anything to stop it. Not really. I thought that I was the one who drew Azazael’s eyes to Mom—but he was always after her—or after Sam, at least. If she hadn’t made the deal then, he’d have gone after Dad some other time—and she would have made the same dumb Winchester choice that we all make.”
thought is what puts his big gay freak out to rest. At least for now. Cas really would let him go on just as he always has if that's what he decided to do. So, all this pressure he’s been feeling? He’s putting it on himself.
“Marv. Or not about him exactly, but that something was up. I felt it. And I just didn’t do anything about it, okay?”
She waved it off. “I don’t mind all that much. And as I said, Dean’s stubborn. The more people who tell him he can’t make something work, the more he’ll prove them wrong. He once—” she started only to cut herself off with a laugh. “Once got told by his brother that there was no way he could even run a marathon, right? So, he immediately started training. Only Sam was staying at our house that weekend and he slipped bacon into Dean’s running shorts earlier that morning. One of our neighbors has this Yorkie—and even though the thing’s two pounds with a bow, Dean’s terrified of—” She laughed again and Castiel felt himself instinctively start to chuckle, too.
Later, Dean found them a hotel—a step up from the kinds of places he, Sam, and their dad used to stay when they were on the road. He was even able to buy toothbrushes and toothpaste out of the little convenience shop in the lobby.
He huffs at me, exasperated. “Dean, I’m not trying to offend you. I’m trying to make sure I don’t inadvertently set the Apocalypse back on track!”
“Eh, where’s the fun in that? I thought I’d get in early, check on some of my local branches, and surprise you for lunch. So…are you surprised?” He waggles his eyebrows.
“Scary thing is, I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or sincere,” Gabriel muttered. “Either way, you are normally waaaay snappier when I call and that means something’s up. Tell your big cousin… what’s got your panties in a twist?”
Dean, apparently, has questions of his own. “This Naomi bitch—what’s her deal and how do we get away from her?”
Jimmy folded himself across Dean's torso. Fingers touched his chest, and the sides of his ribcage. He kissed one of Dean’s nipples, played his tongue around it for a second. Dean moaned, arched his back. His movements were slow. His thoughts were slow. Everything felt good.
Cas turned to look over his shoulder. Dean suspected there was some silent vessel/angel communication going on, because Jimmy swung himself up behind Dean to also straddle Cas. He pressed up against Dean's back, reaching forward to drag down the zipper on his jeans. Dean twisted around to kiss Jimmy, and rolled his hips.
"You’re a gift. You’re the best thing that has ever happened to me. Already were, but this proves it. You were so gorgeous, babe. Like a vision or something. I don't know how to explain it. Cas must have done something. That's all I can figure."
" He hid his face in a pillow to try to muffle the laughing, and once that was out of his system he sat back up and looked at Cas. "Never change."
have sex with me, I will love you. But I’d probably ask that you come and watch Castiel fuck me into the ground in one of your dreams. Just because."
"You're saying these things, these solutions, ones I never would have thought of in a million years. You're right, Claire does need someone to be mad at for a while, and it can't be Cas. I couldn't show up at their door before. But with you I could. I couldn't protect either of them before. But with you I could. I have Cas, but you have
Dean was holding onto Cas' hair harder than he meant to. It took him a second to make sense of what he was hearing. Knowing that Cas was
let me say no to Zachariah, because there was no way I was going to let you go through that alone. I really want to kiss you right now but I need to put my knife away first, or one of us is going to get stabbed and Jimmy's going to say I told you so.”
"That's it." Dean closed his eyes and focused on the sensation. It was always a little strange at first, but it felt good. It wasn't long before he was starting to seek out Cas' touch.
He pulled Dean toward him, got a hand between his shoulders, and kissed so deeply, between his lips, breaking the kiss and waiting for Dean's exhale, before going back and kissing him again - and again.
Dean gave Jimmy a peck on the cheek. "Nah. You're cute. Chairs are fine. Headboards? Could be a problem."
There were hands moving across Dean’s back, over his ass and the backs of his thighs. Then the fingers began to explore deeper.
when Cas tried it. Which made sense. Or it would have, if he'd been in a state to do any thinking at all. Cas was slow, and sensual, not in any hurry, enjoying taking his time.
"Can't believe I'm the first person who gets to do this." Dean was entranced by the sight of his hand on Cas and Jimmy's dick. He leaned forward and placed a soft kiss on the very tip, but didn't take it into his mouth yet. Instead he let it rest on his bottom lip and gave Cas a chance to really take in the sight. Dean knew he looked good like this.
The closeness was so nice, and Dean hated to say anything to ruin it. So for a long minute, he didn't. But he couldn’t let Jimmy sign up for this saying nothing. "I'm no good at talking about things, unless something’s making me."
Jimmy went slower, so much slower that he was barely moving, and then took his hands away completely.
Then Cas pinned Ketch with an evaluating stare. “Protect his back.” It was too harsh to be a request.
"It's not like it would be legally binding or anything. I was just thinking there's no way I can marry you both unless a whole lot of people get a lot more open-minded. Add in the whole angel thing? No way. I mean, Pastor Jim would've done it. It sucks that he's dead. You would have liked him. I’m saying, the only blessing I want from on high is Cas. Not sure how that works - if I'm marrying him too. Or I guess you guys are marrying me, since you already said yes to the whole vessel thing." Dean stopped short. "Crap. Sorry, man. I didn't mean it like that."
The second he was entirely inside Cas, Dean fell forward into his arms. More than relief. That moment was pure, blissful nothing.
"Sorry." Dean felt an apology was needed, considering Jimmy had briefly been kneeling in a pool of Dean’s blood with more of it splattered down his front. This shouldn't be such a big deal anymore. It had happened what... six years ago? More? “Maybe this is a bad idea." He didn't want this to be a bad idea.
, that means, that means she’s going to be okay. I didn’t  - I didn't know how to make it okay, all I could do was stay away - and now you're here. And you're thinking what I'm thinking. So it's all going to be okay."
"If he likes you, he'll tell you to run while you still can," said Sam. He leaned himself against the other side of the island, and reached across for the single salad.
"Dean. You are aware I do not sleep as humans do." Cas’ voice sounded a suspicious amount of sleepy. "You would like to return?"
"Go slow. Real slow. I know you know where all my nerve endings are but it's more fun if you're a bit of a tease. Kind of like this." To demonstrate, Dean ran his fingers across the planes of Cas' back, along the edges of the places where Jimmy and Cas were joined. His circles got progressively smaller until he was tracing patterns over Cas' shoulder blades.
Cas dragged Dean close and kissed him, barely letting him get his breath back before kissing him again - and again - hungry mouth parting his lips, tilting him backwards and over into the curve of the car.
"Don't know why I'm nervous. Shouldn't be. I know you." Jimmy got a hand in Dean's hair. "You’re good to me. And you're so damn beautiful."
"I almost said yes to an angel frying my brain and wearing me as a suit. I thought it was real. I thought Sam was going to say yes and you were going to be walking around half-dead. Why the hell wouldn't I say yes to stop that?"
There was a moment of vertigo, as the entire world seemed to shift and then snap, and plunge into complete darkness. And it took Dean longer than it should have to figure out he was lying in bed, awake.
that. He just wasn't sure if his body was going to get the message. Fuck. Getting nervous wasn't helping. It was so much easier when he could focus on the other person's body, on getting them off. Just use his own body as a tool. That's what he'd been going for here.
"Babe. It's okay. Hold on. I got you. You're so good at this." Dean kept up a litany of praise whispered against skin unmarred by war as he made love to an angel who had only ever known war. "Cas, that's....
He shut the phone and darted back into the house, up the stairs, shedding clothes along the way. Left his pants on the banister separating the not-really-a-bedroom from the rest of the house, and headed to the bathroom to wash his hands and maybe his feet. He really regretted the no-shoes thing. "I have a fiancé and it's you!" Dean announced to the world, but mostly the part of the world occupied by Jimmy and Cas.
"At least Hell gave me that much." It wasn't a fair trade, but it was something. A hand through his hair, and he was being kissed again. Jimmy was starting to get hard. Dean wasn't having any luck there himself, but he wasn't bothered. Nothing could bother him right now.
"Babe, I'm happy." Dean sat up to pull Jimmy into a lazy kiss. "So happy." He flopped back down with the grace of a falling tree. "Maybe I can feel Cas? What's he feel like to you? Is he touching me now? He asked if I could feel him and I said no, but I'm not... this... this feels..
As soon as his leg was no longer trapped, Dean pulled Cas back into his arms, and fell backwards against the mattress.
Jimmy sat back on his heels, and seemed to forget about the lube for a second as he just looked at Dean, thighs apart, relaxed in Cas' arms.
"It's a lot easier when we talk about things. And I asked Jimmy to kiss me before he went to get you, and it was really good for both of us. This can work if you tell me what you want. Some people think that's not sexy, but some people are idiots, and I can prove it. Want me to?"
“What about arms and shoulders? Remind me to take you out shooting some time. You'd look badass with a shotgun." Dean was weird about people touching his feet. Too many things had tried to grab him and drag him away over the years. But if it turned out Jimmy really had a thing for feet, Dean could maybe figure out something.
It wasn't love, not by a long shot. He had been terrified. But Alastair had been the only source of warmth in that place, and Dean had been desperate enough to seek comfort there.
"Tell Jimmy - I thought you were going to die and you were carrying around parts of him and having drugged up orgies because the angels left
"That’s what anyone walking by is going to think. What is going on with those street-facing windows?"
"It's easier if you keep talking to me." Dean knew what to do, but right this second - he was just too afraid to move.
“It just... kind of hit me, is all. Just this idea that - I get to do this. I'm allowed to do this. With my... my husband."
Dean was towing Jimmy over to the bed. "Explain it more than that. I already tried, we all know how that went. "
Jimmy got tense. "The second you think it's safe enough for us to see them. The second you're sure no one is following us. That's what we'll do."
the edge of Castiel's shoulder blade. He was going to invest in some massage oil, that's for sure. With Cas holding on to him, Dean's other hand was free to pay attention to Jimmy's cock.
Cas hummed, and rocked Dean against him. "In a sense I stayed here, aware of you. In a sense also I took my vessel into me, and we slept."
For someone who had supposedly never done this before, Jimmy was almost suspiciously good at it. Maybe it was because it was a dream. Maybe he was just a lot more gentle than Dean was used to. Whatever the case, it didn't hurt at all.
"Actually, I think being a single-income household gives Amelia some more breaks. And I –  I mean it would just be stupid to go anywhere near Claire now, too many people on the lookout to kill Cas. But you know. Things could change.”
"Yeah, well... kids are like that sometimes." Dean smiled, thinking about all the times Sammy had been less than totally thrilled about being rescued. "I bet you never thought you'd be a dad, huh?"
"What was it like riding shotgun earlier? That was intense enough back there with Cas showing off his wings, and all we did was make out."
That was a possibility Dean hadn’t even considered. And now he couldn't tell if he wanted to apologize, demand an explanation, or just
