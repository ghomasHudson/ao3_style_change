“Alright?” The boy above him asked, concern now replacing the earlier anger that had swarmed the depths of those oceanic eyes.
,” John said, and Sherlock startled a bit, jumping from his skin before he tugged the pillow in his arms closer and nodded.
John took a deep, self-motivating breath and uttered out, firm and direct, “You can stay if you like.”
“No one’s there?” John questioned in response, seeing through Sherlock’s words, detecting that the genius before him was more than likely lying through his teeth —
He ignored it, let his mind go blank, let his thoughts waste away, let his brain simply sit and ponder, his head whispering tauntingly to him through the black nothingness, informing him of his plans for later that evening — a needle and a conversation with the very compelling figment of his imagination.
John’s eyes widened in bewilderment and he stared blankly at the boy beside him.
Sherlock bobbed his head once more, curls bouncing, and turned away, swallowing, heart pounding against his chest, dread blooming in his gut, his brain trying desperately to override the intricacy of his feelings — his heartfelt thoughts yelling
“So,” He muttered softly, and slowly met John’s eyes.
“And I thought

“Say what?”
“No.”
“You took it down.”
John would give the world for that and that alone.
John smiled to himself and slowly got to his feet, clicking his bedside lamp on and flipping the switch to those above them, before strolling back over to his desk, prepared to sit down yet again and finish up his editing of the night’s new video only to be stopped in his tracks by that deep baritone once more, piercing the soft quiet of John’s bedroom, illuminated by a soft, noticeably romantic — at least to John — warm light.
“Better not,” Harry winked, expression sly and teasing now, no longer creased with muted worry, “or else I’ll burn every one of these posters.”
Right then and there, John saw the corner of Sherlock's lips lift up for a short moment in amusement before dropping once more as he fixed his attention to the floor, swallowing nervously and kicking a stray rock in utter silence. John watched him carefully for a moment, realizing he should probably say something, considering
First, they had insulted him – called him a freak, a weirdo, an abomination, abnormal – and then they had pulled back their fists and had their fun. Across the eye, into the nose, slicing open his bottom lip, bruising his temples, yanking his hair, shoving him to ground, kicking him in the gut, stinging his ribcage, his arms, his legs, his chest. Everything hurt and then, abruptly, everything stopped. And Sherlock heard growling and snarling and suddenly the three boys standing over him were yelling and threatening something that wasn’t him.

, he was in John’s maths class. It was a silly thing really, and he had no real evidence or substantial reasoning behind it other than a short five minute exchange between his friends but why else would the musical genius suddenly change his style so drastically? Why would he alter who he was unless he was eager to prove wrong those who dissed him?

John giggled, “Saturday at six then?”
Sherlock jolted out of his thoughts and glared down at the distraction, a small message bubble appearing across the screen of his phone.

John bit his lip, grinned and then grabbed the door handle, walking out into the loud cacophony of sounds resounding within the walls of the school gymnasium and smiling to himself.
“Sherlock, do you —“ He froze, staring at the curly haired brunette atop his navy duvet. Sherlock had his eyes shut, his features relaxed and weightless, unguarded, utterly at peace in a way John had never seen them before. His hands were folded around his pillow, tucked lightly beneath that head of chocolate curls, and his pale lips were parted slightly, little puffs of breath escaping and he dreamed on, legs tucked upwards and thighs close to his chest, thin frame looking small on the wide stretch of John’s mattress.
When John pulled his mother's tattered old Toyota into the student parking lot, he caught sight of a lone figure walking slowly along the pavement, somewhat dragging his feet as he sucked on the end of a cigarette.
"A reminder that you are human," Mycroft leaned back and dropped his arm, glancing away from Sherlock's confused expression, and turning instead to glare at the boys and girls crowding together before the Hall of Justice, "And so are they."
Sherlock chuckled bitterly, “Yeah, I probably could. But that’s not the point, is it? I won’t be quick enough to dodge the other’s attack. They’ll kill me before I even pull back the arrow.”
Sherlock froze, blinked at the heater and then slowly pulled away, swallowing thickly and rolling his eyes, letting out a long breath of air, as though everything in his very life was entirely

In Literature class, as their plump teacher in her vintage skirt blabbered on about Romeo’s heroics and Juliet’s devotion, John discreetly pulled out his cellphone, glancing over at Sherlock of whom was staring, dead-eyed at Ms. Montgomery, chin resting on his fist, and brain entirely tuned out to whatever words were coming out of her lipstick clad mouth. His mind was a constant whirlwind of unanswered questions, his brain still processing, still coming to terms with the fact that
He went about his after-rugby-practice routine and headed for the bathroom he shared with Harry, locking the door behind him and turning the shower nozzle to hot, stripping down and quickly sliding past the curtain and under the spray of water.
But, Sherlock couldn't help but selfishly think, perhaps now, because of what he did, he'd be the one dying. And who could possibly save him?
What he hadn’t expected, however, was just how many notifications, just how many messages, just how many general people would find him so interesting over the course of a single night.
Molly dropped her gaze and chewed on her bottom lip, as though desperately looking for something to say, some way to help — why did she bother?
“As I’ll ever be,” He chuckled and slammed his locker shut, sauntering slowly over to where Greg stood and clapping him lightly on the shoulder, sporting an encouraging grin and watching as his friend turned, heading through the doors of the locker-room and exiting out to where the rest of their team was gathered, awaiting captain’s orders.

. No, not John’s video with his numerous subscribers who were all very vocally unafraid of voicing their opinions; not John’s video where all of his friends, everyone at Baker, the entirety of the world, if they so pleased, could see him; where he would stay, permanently,
John let out a sharp laugh and shoved Greg in the shoulder, the silver haired boy stumbling slightly and looking far too amused.
And that’s how he’d found himself doing the same, sneaking his phone out and behind his copy of the play just as Greg Lestrade was enthusiastically reading his lines as Tybalt.
“Sherlock Holmes,” The rugby captain stated, loud and clear, features serious but incredibly soft, “Would you like to go to some ridiculous space themed party with me this weekend?”
Sherlock froze, a shiver running down his spine as he pulled back slightly and looked up into pools of blue, “What?”
Their eyes met and stilled, fixated on one another, a dark desire and unspoken message passing between the both of them, not completely unreadable as John swallowed the lump in his throat and felt his cheeks heat at the very image that came to mind.
. Do have fun.” And with that, he was storming off yet again, faster than before but still at a fairly slow pace, seemingly too pained to push harder.
“Sorry?” John blinked away his daze and met Sherlock’s eyes properly, arching a soft brow in confusion.
He ignored the drink extended to him and swallowed, turning away from the three of them standing there, staring with narrowed eyes at his panicked expression, and, with the only excuse he could think of, he glanced at John, mumbled a short, “Bathroom,” and took off in the direction of the stairs, leaving a confused trio behind him.
With his lips still curved upward in mirth, John slipped his phone back into his pocket and strode into his room, placing his tea down beside his computer and fiddling with the mouse, watching as the screen illuminated instantly, his channel layout the first thing to pop up, along with several new notifications, all indicated by small, red spheres.

“I don't know,” he whispered, looking down at the water surrounding him, breath finally evening out as he stared at the bottom of the off-white tub, at his pruned fingers, at his practically concaving stomach. But didn’t he? Didn’t he know why? He hadn’t wanted to continue; he hadn’t wanted to wake up without Him there, to yell about the eyeballs in the microwave or the fingers in the fridge, to remind him to take care of himself, to eat and catch a few hours of shuteye, or remember to hydrate after a taxing case. He didn’t want a life without precisely that — so why not leave it?
He was still a tribute.
“My phone?”
Sherlock turned, leaning back in his seat and fixing John with a rather strange expression, brows drawn into a frown, features amused yet surprised — shocked, even.

Sherlock scoffed at the name but hit play anyway, and halfway through the video - a small screen recording of John Watson looking warm and wonderful as ever, talking brightly into the lens - the dancer was nearly falling out of his chair, blood running cold with both shock and disbelief, eyes practically bulging from their sockets, jaw beginning to drop.
Sherlock chuckled and smirked a little at her, arching a brow knowingly and gesturing sluggishly with his hands, "Then it must be true."

It wasn’t until very late that Sherlock found himself sitting in the passenger seat of John’s old, tattered car, staring out the window at his dauntingly large, lonely house, and dreading walking inside and losing the magic he’d felt at John’s flat, that warm sense of home, security,
John knew about the majority of his friends, though sometimes he didn't enjoy calling them that. He knew that they were rude, and arrogant, and untrustworthy. He also knew that they were judgmental, and close-minded, and, he did in fact know, that they were bullies. The worst kind, verbal and physical; the kind you see on television that practically keeps you from wanting to attend secondary school. And he’d known for a while that Sherlock, mysteriously calm and collected Sherlock, was one of their victims. Hell, honestly he seemed to be everyone’s victim. And as much as John hated it, he didn't exactly know how to stop it.
“Sherlock, it’s fine,” John said sincerely, hoping to reassure, “It’s all fine.”
“No, it’s not,” John said, quickly, and Sherlock couldn’t help it — he turned to look at him, their face so very close, their eyes staring, ablaze with silent questions, expressions glowing as they bared their souls, as they spoke of things they’d never thought to someday be a possibility.

As he stepped inside, his eyes darted over each and every thing he could possibly take note of — the living room was warm and cozy in shades of red and coffee brown, picture frames lined the walls portraying smiling visages, four people stood close together, the faces of infants, a family pet, a man in army fatigues. The sofas and rugs were floral and vintage, decorative prints and designs, along with oak tables and intricately painted lamps; the dining table bore a long table cloth smattered with arbitrary pink daisies, the chairs tucked beneath it covered in soft cushions of rosy hues. Sherlock’s features softened at the look of it all, one long couch and a small recliner positioned before a moderately sized television, a arched, open doorway leading to the kitchen, counters in white and black, tiled and dotted with speckles of gray. It was a home, it was lived in, it was warm and safe and secure and it held dear a family that cared for it and one another — Sherlock’s heart twisted desperately with want.
He’d done it. He’d just partaken in one of John’s videos, of which would be on John’s channel by the end of the day, of which everyone would be introduced to Sherlock Holmes — one of John’s
The tall brunette whirled around and fixed John with a pale, blank expression, his eyes, still their ethereal shade, glowing in the dark of the night, their position there, half way to the gate that lined the parking area, utterly unsettling, the depths of Sherlock’s gaze sparking the realization of just how very alone they were, the rest of the team already on their way home, the school shut down for the after dark hours.
It wasn't the first time he'd gone through a tearful farewell with the setter. He did it just before every reaping. Because he never knew which one would be his last. Sighing, Sherlock shut his eyes for a moment, swallowed stiffly, and turned away from his best friend, dashing past his family members and back down the hall towards the exit.

“You’re hungry? You’re never hungry.”

John Watson and his stupid YouTube videos, his stupid rugby practice and his stupid, rather adorable, love for classical music and Sherlock’s own videos. Stupid. He was an idiot. He was a popular kid, a jock, a people-pleaser, kind on the outside, manipulative on the inside. He was ordinary. Wasn’t he?

Sherlock quirked a smile but let it drop within an instant, turning his head back toward Molly and Haymitch, the two of them sitting in their chairs, across from one another, Molly appearing somewhat bewildered, whilst Haymitch was staring straight at Sherlock specifically, eyes narrowed as though he were curious, or skeptical. Sherlock stared back, observing, deducing.
Sherlock looked away shyly before beginning to exit the vehicle, his heart pounding against his chest as John snickered to himself in both awe and surprise. Closing the door behind him with a faint smile, he followed John towards the building, walking alongside him whilst he clicked the car key, only turning to Sherlock once it had honked in affirmation.

The sun had set as John’s rugby match finally came to a victorious end, field lights automatically flicking on with the onset of darkness and the soft shape of the rising moon. The parents and other family members lacing the crowd had cheered as John’s team scored the final point, the players throwing their fists up in triumph, another Home game conquered. The red and white clad boys had made their way over to the guests of whom had come explicitly for them, and with hugs and hollers had parted once more to head toward their locker room, eager for a good rinse and a good change of clothes before leaving with their families, more than likely heading out for a spontaneous victory dinner. John had headed directly over to the small tree, spotting the thin, pale boy thankfully still there, standing now, with a singly hand ruffling his curls as he watched the crowd dwindle with obvious trepidation. John shot him a wide, white grin as he approached, that he more than hoped displayed the entirely enormous amount of joy he was feeling right there, in that very moment.
John blinked, “Yeah?”
At John’s soft laugh and a huff of her own, she stepped aside and motioned for them to enter with the flick of her head, alien antennas bouncing from side to side at the movement.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded and stood awkwardly before his brother, fingers sliding over the face of the bee pin in his pocket, just as they had before, “Then again she had every right to be.”

But finding the front door seemed impossible in the maze of a hallway he’d suddenly found himself in. Everything suddenly looked different from earlier, his head pounding and sending him into a dizzying lost state. He passed several closed room doors, before stumbling upon one just slightly ajar, his hand instantly reaching out and pushing it open, curious to the light shining through the crease between it and the wall.
“But they’ll be dry,” John added, reaching down into his dresser and grabbing out a black and grey tee, along with a pair of what looked like navy jeans. He turned back around to face Sherlock and handed them over with his ever-present warm smile, his eyes alight with friendliness, his expression careful and sincere.
He watched as Sherlock let out a soft huff of amused air, his eyes brightening just slightly, his expression softening and his lips, pink and sculpted to perfection, lifting. John took pride in making the boy laugh; his skinny figure, those ethereal features, rising to display merely the smallest look of emotional bliss, but a look of emotional bliss all the same.
Carefully and gently, John placed his hand on Sherlock’s warm shoulder, softly shaking him back and forth and waiting until the ethereal color of those eyes slowly shimmered up at him, eyelids having fluttered open and brows drawing inwards with confusion.

And with that, he was ending the recording, loading the file onto his computer, editing, shortening, adding and subtracting, and exporting until he reached his utmost satisfaction.

for some time, aware that the social networking app existed but too weary to try anything new that strayed from the YouTube atmosphere and setting — it was stepping out of the loop, making things more real, and for some reason he liked the bubble of surreality that the Youtube world created for him. But John — of course it was John, it’s always John — had convinced him that maybe stepping out of bounds sometimes wasn’t all too bad because hell, in one day he’d done it twice. He’d both told John every little bit about his secret, his alter online ego, and created himself an account, the little white bird in the blue box now an icon on the screen of his mobile.
He watched as Molly held her hand to her mouth, obviously struggling to hide her grin, before she fiddled with the keyboard of her mobile once more.
“Chemical reactions, cause and effect; that sort,” He muttered, pushing back a stray curl from where it sat atop his pale forehead.
“I suppose it must feel different now,” Sherlock finally murmured, voice low and soft, deep as it rumbled out alongside John’s own, whilst he determinedly, desperately, tried not to meet the boy’s eyes, his breath catching in his throat as he winced. “Now that you know the truth. Now that you’ve seen me, now that you know I’m not some surreal, untouchable being; the magic is gone.”

Sherlock arched a brow and then frowned, reaching into his pocket and handing over the mobile rather uneasily, clearing his throat and shyly refusing to meet John’s eye, “Don’t run away with it.”

He held his breath as the blonde reached forward and took hold of Sherlock’s fingers, examining them with utmost concentration, as though the digits were out of this world, not of this earth, surrealistic in their ways. He was studying Sherlock as though he were something extraordinary, and Sherlock was entirely new to the sensation.
“Something funny, Holmes?” His maths teacher asked, halfway through a lecture on quadratic equations.

“And then we have his Alzheimers, also recent as he clearly still remembers whom he lost,” Sherlock glanced once at John before continuing, “Notice how he feeds the birds. His natural instinct is to feed the ones on the left and then the ones on the right, as he’s been doing, but occasionally, he falls out of pattern, throwing crumbs to one side, forgetting he’d done so, and throwing more, once again, in the same place.”

James grinned at his question and sat up in his seat, mouth stretching wildly across his expression, wolfish and overbearing, “Load of people. Mike says he wants it to be pretty damn memorable. It’s an important game, of course, so — it’s gotta be an important party.”
John bit his lip, turned away and then quickly cleared his throat, unwilling to believe her words and far too worried he’d prove her wrong — instead, he got to his feet, lifting himself from the bed and swaying slowly over to his closet, sighing and shaking his head.
Sherlock cringed, because seeing Molly adorn that stage, so small and skinny and utterly fragile wasn't right. She looked so innocent, too innocent, and meek and kind, and Sherlock didn't even want to look at her anymore – because, standing here now, he realized he'd gotten attached.
Greg let out a relieved laugh, a serious question turned humorous by the warmth in John’s tone, but he quickly shook his head and shot John a careful smile, relaxed yet agog, “Sherlock, you git.”
Within an instant, he was a fury on his feet. It all happened within a mere few seconds; things began crashing, there was screaming — someone was screaming,

But he never told anyone. And he never would.
Unable to help himself, John smiled, already aware of why she was standing so close to his car window, of why she was grinning from ear to ear, of why her cheeks were faintly red with exertion from jogging like a maniac passed crowds of loud people.
“I feel pretty daft, you know,” John’s words seeped through Sherlock’s busy mind, and he surfaced, his thoughts vanishing to the ‘
“So I’m told,” The rugby captain winked, and Sherlock let out a shuddering breath, loud to his own ears, but silent to the rest of the group sitting amongst him.

Sherlock gazed back at the boy, Victor’s ashy blonde hair messy and ruffled, the usual gelled straight strands hanging against his forehead — he looked like a wolf, snarling at Sherlock, eyes bright and threatening, growling out his commands, agreement the only answer suitable, the only response keeping you alive. With a sigh, Sherlock ducked his head and nodded, turning away and shoving Victor off, sauntering slowly over to where he’d thrown his backpack down in his earlier desire.
Sherlock looked up again at that, eyes widening softly before narrowing, as though they were readily observing John for any sign of insincerity. The brown haired boy swallowed, opened his mouth, furrowed his brows, closed his mouth, and then opened it again, only to mumble out, “Even from me?”

“Thank you,” Sherlock cleared his throat and dropped his eyes down to the closed notebook in his pale, slender fingers.
Sherlock stared down at his hands, fingers fidgeting aimlessly as he seemingly thought over John’s words.
Taking the hint, John nodded and put his hands up in gentle surrender, his features twisting to form another proper smile, “Right. Sorry.”
He shook his head and swallowed, reaching the rugby field and slowly stalking over to the benches, seemingly the first one out of the locker room in his hurry to flee from Wilkes. He sighed and sat down, putting down his things and looking up to spot Greg swaying over to him, one hand holding tightly to his water bottle, and the other twisting through his short, silver hair, dyed purposely that way a while back, its brown roots seeping through just a bit.

Sherlock swallowed and glared, appalled, taken aback by his brother’s actions and words. He watched, scowling, as his older sibling sighed and shook his head once more, glancing off somewhere unknown, most likely retreating into his mind for something else to say.
Within an instant, eager to keep from hearing John’s response, whatever it may be, Sherlock jumped to his feet, barely meeting John’s eyes as he turned away from the table, swallowing and clearing his throat, keeping his head downcast, “Enjoy the rest of your lunch, John.”

He could run and run and run and run and take his bow and arrows with him, and hunt things to survive, and be on his own, away from tedious people and the horrors of sentiment and emotion and the ever-present constant worry that one day – one day – he, or someone he knew, would be reaped.

Greg nodded his head and glanced at the group of them, smirking and shrugging his shoulders in his own disbelief, his story so very ridiculous even he had trouble believing it.
“Things were okay. He put up with my oddities and I helped him with his school work and we smoked together,” He seemed to paused as though he were about to say something else, but decided against it. “We got along. Tolerated one another. And he was gentle.” Sherlock swallowed, “But he was strong-willed. Controlling.”
John blinked before chuckling gently, one brow arched in curiosity, “Yeah, how’d you know?”
“Yeah, and my mum. My parents haven’t gotten on for years. Fallen out of love, or whatever. And my sister, well.”
Sherlock shook his head and held back a grin, exiting his messages and scrolling, instead, through his YouTube notifications, rolling his eyes at the shrieking users commenting on his own post to John’s video, before stilling his thumb as he came across the response he had been hoping for.
John swallowed and glanced down, expression hardening before he turned and arched a brow, shrugging a single shoulder Wilkes’ way, smirking lightly, “I’m single, mate. Why? You interested?”
And with a wink, he vanished behind the shelves, Sherlock left alone, standing still amongst the many novels surrounding him, posture rigid and stiff, heart clenching, ego bruised — and yet still, he knew, he’d let Victor into his dormitory later with open arms.

Neither of them said a word as John quickly began eating his apple again, forcing down his irritation as to not scare Sherlock away, the boy currently watching John with a rather terrified and confused expression.
“See,” John smiled and held the strap upwards for Sherlock to take hold of, “
“Come on,” John shouted out, pressing his foot onto the pedal and speeding up a bit so that he was looking back at Sherlock rather than at his sauntering side, “get in.”
“Though, Molly will
“We’re not trying to piss you off purposely, mate,” James guffawed, grinning at John’s uptight position in his chair, shoulders raised, eyes fixated and narrowed, “but he’s just not our style, yeah?”
“You might not when you’re brought down as an accomplice.”
Molly had stopped by a few times, but when Sherlock had merely continued to stare at the tattered old armchair across from him, she’d felt as though she’d been intruding, leaving him behind with nothing but that ever-shiny violin and a fresh cup of tea.
John grinned as they approached and instantly wrapped Molly up in a gentle, tight hug, eyes shining with admiration for his friend, heart floating with mirth at the sight of her, all giggly and bright and warm.
“Scotland Yard wouldn’t
Sherlock scoffed, "Good?" He shook his head, annoyed with himself, "It's sentiment."
“You’ll what?” Sherlock asked, deep baritone acidic as he glared down at John, “hurt me? Beat me up further? Finish what they started?” He made to walk away again, but John promptly stopped him.
to be bothered?
John inwardly patted himself on the back as he watched those plush lips curl into an easy, comfortable smile, and he moved forward to kiss Sherlock gently, their lips touching, soft skin against soft skin, a buzz of electricity soaring through the blood rushing within John’s veins, the warmth of Sherlock sinking into John’s entire skeleton, the scent of him — pine and mint and something entirely elegant, cozy — forcing its way into the thumping of his organs, the taste of him so positively wonderful John’s heart was allowing itself to memorize its every detail, beating only for the way Sherlock melted beneath John’s touch and shivered with every kiss.
Sherlock smirked, nerves calmly just slightly, “Clearly.”
Sherlock glanced down at his combat boot clad feet and frowned, his heart clenching with fear and worry and doubt and dread, his mind feeling foggy and unnerved. He swallowed, cleared his throat and glanced wearily over at Irene.
He shut his eyes tight, only to feel the touch slowly soften to a simple placement of hand, skin warming him through the soft fabric of his white dress shirt. He glanced up at John of whom was staring down at him in concern, blue puddles of distress shining down upon his pale, blank expression.
John beamed at him, “Good.”
Sighing and letting out an exasperated laugh, John put down his phone and observed Molly, eyeing how the color compared to her eyes, how the bodice fit her figure, how the shape of the dress suited her thin frame.

As always, your feedback is infinitely appreciated.

“Of which you uploaded. To YouTube.”
“What for,” Sherlock couldn’t help but spit out, back still turned to the boy behind him, heart hammering in his chest with the weight of it all — how irrevocably deep Sherlock had fallen, how close he was to kneeling on the floor in front of John’s feet and pleading, crying,

“Fucking stupid is what you are,” Victor spat out, yanking his black, uniform slacks on with vehement.
John’s voice forming those words, enclosing that sentence, was entirely unanticipated. And clearly, it showed on Sherlock’s face — his eyes blinking blankly and repeatedly, his throat bobbing as he swallowed the knot in his throat, his shoulders tense in his entirely upright position.

Too stunned to speak, Sherlock only narrowed his eyes further.

“Maybe not,” Victor shrugged, “but you still
“John?” A soft voice rang out that was distinctly feminine, and from around a corridor corner, a small, shorter than John, figure appeared, brown hair done-up in a messy bun, eyes cloaked with black liner, and lips shining slightly with the obvious indication of applied lip gloss.
“You got a new girl or something, mate?” Wilkes blurted out as John was busy packing away his school clothes and hoisting his backpack into his locker.
to touch, what it would feel like if John kissed him, ran his tongue along his bottom lip, tugged at his hair, grasped at his shirt. Sherlock inhaled sharply and shook his head, keeping with his dance, spinning forwards with the music, and trying hard not to let his unforgivingly cruel thoughts wonder further
John frowned at his phone, brows turning downward in confusion, head tilting slightly to the side, and before he formed a response, he glanced over at the sender, eyeing the way he stared straight ahead, as though his answer to John’s question were nothing to be perplexed about — as though it were simple fact.
“So,” Sherlock cleared his throat and dropped his gaze, glancing tellingly at John’s camcorder, “what’s the video on?”
John rolled his eyes, shaking his head and grabbing the final things he’d need for the field, eager to remove himself from the conversation, nearly every eye beginning to fall upon him and his confused, yet guarded, stance, arms hanging limply as he cleared his throat, “I’m surprised you even know what doe-eyed means, Seb.”
And yet again, Sherlock was taken by surprise, John’s warmth and kindness clutching the width of his heart and grasping it tight, squeezing it till it was bursting, his cheeks falling pink, his lips lifting into a smile, and his legs shaking with a mix of both enormous love for the boy and utter nervousness.
“Gardener?” John practically squeaked.
once again.
“Please,” Sherlock shook with the cold and the tightness of the firm grip on his arm, holding him in place, an escape this time utterly impossible though he still attempted to struggle out of the boy’s grip. He was sure that John was going to hit him, shove him to the ground, tell him
Sherlock let out a soft chuckle and arched a brow, biting the inside of his cheek for a moment before gesturing John onwards with a flick of his chin, “Go on then.”
His mother had her heads in the clouds, he had decided.
“Sherlock!”
“How did you get to be so
When Greg didn’t respond for a good while, John sighed and shook his head, fingers dancing against the screen’s keyboard.
He couldn’t allow this — no.
Sherlock scoffed inwardly and rolled his eyes, all too familiar with the introduction.
Sherlock turned slightly in his seat to glance over at the back corner of the room where a number of boys had angled their desks just enough to divulge in a rather lively conversation, hands waving and jaws jiggling vigorously with the speed at which they spoke. Amongst them, Sebastian Moran, James Sholto, Mike Stamford, Gavin –
Lestrade let out a snort and quickly nodded — because any bloke would be a fool to turn down a dance with Molly Hooper. The girl was practically flying with excitement before she whirled around to beam at John and Sherlock, her eyes wide bright, her painted lips lifted in a warm grin.
“And sure,” John went on, “afterwards is tough. Enormously tough. But you move on. And you meet another person that brings more light to your life. It’s one big cycle, Sherlock. And it’s worth being a part of.”
John grinned.
: hey can you give your friend a kiss from me thanks

The vibration from his pocket sent him jolting upwards, flustered and blushing as he reached into his pocket and yanked out his mobile, swallowing the lump in his throat and inhaling sharply as he read the screen.

“Yeah, alright — shut up,” Greg spat, before turning back to Carl and John, “his special talent, or whatever.”
Sherlock blinked.
“Everyone is raising their hands, the teacher’s choosing arbitrarily, fits are being thrown, books are being scattered about — it’s
“Do shut up,” Sherlock snapped, clearly with the desire to sound angry, off-put, but unable to carry the tone through, his voice shaking slightly and his eyes sad, “We all have tragedy in our lives. No sense dwelling on it.”

? Sherlock was so hung up on the fact that John’s newest viewers were obviously idiots, that he hardly noticed the boy had began talking once more, hands flailing animatedly.
,” and Sherlock bobbed his head as he took his own, swallowing and turning away from the foul substance — he wasn’t a fan of alcohol. Not when he saw what it turned his uncle into. But he held onto it, for appearance purposes mostly.
Haymitch sighed, and pulled his cup of coffee closer to him, lugging a small canteen of alcohol from his pocket and adding a few drops to the hot, caffeinated liquid, “You are simply given good luck and perfect opportunities. Miss one or the other and you’re dead.”
Taking a deep breath, the rugby captain placed a very gentle hand on the small of Sherlock’s back, stilling the boy in his steps, and he walked around him, smiling softly, comfortingly, and letting out a long sigh, “Come on. I’ll take you home.”
John quirked a smile, as those charmed by Sherlock’s bashful expression, and lifted a brow, waiting patiently for him to finish.
John let out a soft puff of laughter before gesturing with a shake of his head and beginning to move back in the direction of his class, gazing brightly at Sherlock, his eyes dancing over his slender form before setting his sights on Sherlock’s own.

. He swallowed a bit nervously and turned to the boy in the driver’s seat, of whom looked back, expression wistful and a bit shy. The two had gotten quite a bit done on their annoyingly exhausting Literature paper, and Sherlock had even managed to say a goodbye and a thorough thank you to both Harry and John’s mother, as Harry arrived home and John’s mother left for work.
Sherlock watched, swallowed, shut his eyes for a moment and then let out a long-suffering sigh, mind yelling at his heart for the next word that exited his mouth.
“No bloody way,” Sholto wheezed, face crinkling with amusement as he stared up at Wilkes, expression almost awed by his presence, “I’ve been trying to convince her since the start of the semester.”
Sherlock couldn’t help the breathless chuckle that escaped his lips, relief mixed with utter awe juggling loose a sharp, amused exhale.

Bill rolled his eyes and leaned back in his dining chair, lifting an exasperated hand and chuckling, glaring at Lestrade before facing John with an apologetic look, “My dad owns Murray’s Ice.”
Swallowing, blinking, fingers trembling, Sherlock whirled to John and scowled, anxiousness underlying those angered features, “
After a moment of blank staring, the brunette cleared his throat and looked away from John, eyes darting over each and every person before him, those exiting the coffee shop up ahead, those lugging about bags and briefcases, those sitting behind the glass windows of cabs and other cars - and just when John was about to broach another subject in fear of reaching an awkward silence, Sherlock spoke, voice confident, deep baritone laced with anticipation, and stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, head flicking towards a certain human being ahead of them.

John Watson reached for the button on his small camcorder and sat back in his cheap black chair, spinning in a circle and turning to smile warmly at the little red light. "What's going on everybody," He chuckled, ocean blue eyes brightening as he bared his teeth in a fond grin, "my name is John Watson and this is what's on my face." He spun in his chair once more and threw his feet onto the top of his desk, running a hand through his ashy blonde hair and sighing, "Math class."
John lifted a hand to his face, “Bloody hell.”
Sherlock winced at the insult, at the truth behind Wilkes’ question, and he quickly turned away, ducking his head downward to fix his eyes purely on the floor, refusing to respond to the brute hovering over him, the twinge of fear now turning into an aching sense of agony.
“Holmes?” Sebastian Moran slurred, his lips dragging away from the boy sitting atop the bed, his hair dark and slicked back, his figure thin but short, and his clothing normal, no costume at all, body clad in a white shirt and black jeans — Sherlock didn’t recognize
, popular rugby captain, golden boy and part-time YouTuber.
Sherlock sighed to himself as he crept slowly into the rather large, but almost decrepit, house, closing the rather tall, intimidating front door behind him and sliding his shoes off. He tiptoed across the white, cold tile and headed for the winding staircase eager to get to his room and lock himself away but only managing a few steps before a slurred voice called for him from the living room couch.
a good idea.
Mycroft turned and stared at him then, and for a moment Sherlock was sure he saw something in that lifeless gaze. Something kind, something determined, and something furious. But then his older brother glanced downward, glaring intricately at the floor as though it had wronged him in some way, and Sherlock was left questioning the emotions he’d just seen flicker across his older sibling’s features.
Molly stared, wide-eyed and frozen, her fiddling hands stilling against her sweater. She took a deep breath, nodding her head and swallowing, ducking her head down and away, and before she could open her mouth to say one more inane word of comfort, Sherlock was whirling into motion.
Just before he dropped his eyes and refocused on the next story Greg had begun prattling on about, John caught sight of a tall, thin figure speeding his way through and into the dining hall, pushing aside the entrance doors and slipping into the now empty dining line. John recognized him instantly — the boy of whom had sent his vinyls clattering to the floor. He took note of his ruffled curls and annoyed stance as he spoke animatedly to the ladies working the kitchen, clearly irritated with his last minute decision to eat. John admired the way he stood; tall and broad in his school uniform, far more casual than before, shirt untucked, tie loose, sweater vest vacant, and shoes seemingly sock-less. He studied the boy carefully as he swept past the elderly ladies working the line, grabbing simple things, a few chips and a water bottle the only thing sat atop his plate, and John frowned as he saw the boy blink down at his tray, as though deciding whether it were enough, before he turned to find an empty table in the large hall, which, of course, was no difficult leap.
Unconsciously, he pushed closer to John, and the boy immediately pressed his hand firmer against the small of his back, Sherlock’s rapid heartbeat settling just slightly with the comfort, his mind put temporarily at ease.
Ahh! Finally, am I right?
John chuckled and watched as Sherlock hurriedly scanned his eyes down the menu before seemingly deciding on something he found to his liking, head lifting once more and gazing at John, of whom took the hint to go first.
Even the teachers went home before he did.
Wilkes snickered and spread his arms wide in an audacious gesture, grinning wide and arching a dark eyebrow, “Obviously.”
His sister gazed at him with wide eyes, brows at her hairline, and let out a sharp, rather bemused giggle, the sound emanating both shock and disbelief, “Christ, John, are you in
And then Victor smiled, and the wrinkles by his eyes crinkled, his lips pulling back, white teeth revealed beneath a pale pink, kiss-swollen mouth, expression relieved and content, the very opposite of how Sherlock was feeling. The tall artist grinned and reached for Sherlock’s waist, running his fingers along Sherlock’s hips soothingly and humming to himself, smile turning to a smirk as he arched a brow and leaned in further.
“Hey, Greg?” John called after him, turning with a small, shy smile.

Shut up, shut up,
Sholto swallowed and let go of John’s arm, reaching for one of the plastic cups on the table and bringing it to his lips, taking a deep and rather thorough of ale, before slamming it back down, eyes sharp and squinted, mouth turned downwards at the corners.
,” He spat, and with one solid thrust of his arms, he threw the entirety of Sherlock’s thin frame to the floor, the cold tile slamming against this frail, dancer’s bones with bruising force and Sherlock cried out softly, curling in on himself and hugging his stomach, already aware of what came next.
it, shout it, confess it in all its idiocy, to the world, to John.
John smiled and leaned back, scoffing in amusement before glancing up at the dwindling number of students populating the hall. Nearly eight meant dinner time was near finishing, and it seemed the only real people left were groups of amused friends, too busy chatting or wagging off to notice the time. He purses his lips to hide his fond smile, thinking of how he’d expected to sit, eat and head out as early as he possibly could, the daunting realization that he’d be all on his own far too overwhelming — but, obviously, that hadn’t been the case.
“You’re practically skin and bones, Sherlock Holmes,” The elderly lady spat out, clad in her lavender blouse and dark magenta skirt, all frail limbs and dainty movements, standing before him with her hands on her hips,
Molly reappeared draped in the petite, yellow dress, its skirt flowing out behind her, whilst the blouse stuck tight to her figure. "Only," She spun around in the mirror before turning to wink at him, "if you want it to be."
“See?” John hummed, interrupting his frazzled thoughts, his voice an instant anchor to Sherlock’s rampant mind, “Not so bad.”
John frowned and lifted his head, storing their conversation in the back of his mind and watching as the three of them strode over to go about grabbing their own things, Wilkes meeting his eyes briefly to smirk, before ignoring him once more. He felt Greg tense beside him, noticed how quickly he was tugging on his gear, clearly eager to get out of the room, and, frankly, John didn’t blame him. The rugby captain stood tall, however, throwing the rest of his kit on and slamming his locker door shut, turning slowly to pat at Greg’s shoulder, the silver haired boy glancing his way and nodding. They turned to leave, keeping their eyes away from their other team members, and John found he was fully prepared to never have to speak to Wilkes again — but the moment was short-lived, and within an instant he heard that deep, wolfish voice beckon from behind him.
He pulled back slightly to look into those heavy-lidded eyes, the color dimmed only slightly in the dark of the party’s poor lighting, and with a smile, he asked, softly, “What is?”
John mused and grunted softly as he leaned forwards, placing his elbows on the table and looking directly at Sherlock’s guarded features.
“Because people don’t do that.”
And then John let out a soft sigh, not of irritation or exhaustion, but of mild concern, his brows creasing the skin between them, his eyes narrowing, and his tongue darting out to lick over the expanse of his bottom lip as he slowly, carefully reached forward, his hand, much to Sherlock’s internally incredulity and the rapid racing of his heart, grazing the soft surface of where his jumper covered his wrist. Those fingers stayed there, just resting, directly over those sore bruises, black and blue hidden beneath a layer of fabric, out of sight but obviously not out of mind, a touch so very close and yet so very far all the same.

It means so much to me and every comment from you all warms my heart.
. John was sat at his computer chair, elbows resting on his knees, head up and eyes wide, jaw just slightly open as though merely looking at Sherlock were causing him a sensation of great awe, bewildering the very core of his mind. Though he wouldn’t admit the simple fact, Sherlock was, frankly, terrified — full on scared off his head, worried and plagued with dread because what did this mean now? What was going to happen?
“Clever, that,” Greg smiled, bobbing his head happily John’s way, and John scoffed, shaking his head and daring a glance over at Sherlock, of whom was watching the floor, beaming only slightly, those sharp cheekbones pink and gorgeous.

” It was that – that thirst to be himself no matter the judgment or question – that kept John on his toes, observing Sherlock’s every move before he disappeared around the corner of the gym, hidden from view.
Fortunate bastard. He had long since escaped the reaping, turning twenty-four just last month, seven years Sherlock's elder. He'd made it. All those years, a possible participant in the Hunger Games, and not once had his name been called. Sherlock hoped to be just as lucky.
Because, for once in his life, Sherlock Holmes felt utterly, and hopelessly, helpless.

“Addiction to specific substances happens to run in my family,” The brunette beside him spoke, and John felt him grow tense in his gentle hold, “and alcohol tends to have the most unflattering effect.”
But, as bewilderingly new as it was, it was also oddly coincidental. He couldn't shake the small clue, the small suspicion, that had wormed its way into the back of his mind, that somehow, in some way, the anonymous dancer had been there, on that very day John had leaned over and played his music for his friends.
He replied with a small, shy nod and glanced from John to the others and back, hinting at a silent question and watching as John’s expression shifted to curious, to perplexed, and then to a final look of clear understanding.
And with that, John reached for the handle and poked his head around the narrow slot, his hand extending, mobile tucked beneath his fingers and against his palm. He had every intention of dropping the cellphone on the edge of the sink, but his eyes caught sight of something stark black, sharp and startlingly contrast against milk-bottle white skin. He heard Sherlock’s quiet protests far too late and as soon as his eyes took in the sight of Sherlock’s long, pale spine, he set his sights on the curving detail of a tattoo.
Sherlock had never felt safer.

"Easy there," he chuckled, a warm smile on his face, "Alright?"

Bill was the one tossing food now, which Greg Lestrade expertly dodged with a giddy smile. John felt his heart warm at the sight and shook his head in amusement, turning now to the last member of their table, a smaller boy with black hair and a wide grin, all teeth and blue eyes.
Sherlock swallowed, dropping his eyes, and then fixing them back onto the man before him, taking in the cold, detached twist of his features, the horrifying mix of amusement and impatience. And yet.
“Speedy’s cafe,” Sherlock replied, voice hoarse and unsteady as he kept his palms on the heater, the softness of his tone knocking John from that dark place deep in his mind, the one that urged him to lean in close and kiss the trembles right out of him.
“Saturday at seven, I reckon,” Mike stated and turned to them as a whole, “Pass the word on and invite anyone you like. Tell them to dress up too. I want it to be big!”
“Alright?” John’s heart picked up its pace.
John H. Watson: Yet again finding myself in awe of what
Sherlock swallowed thickly and turned away, his cheeks pink and nerves erratic, a slight tremble to his fingers that wasn’t there earlier. Upon seeing his reaction, Molly giggled and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, her smile genuine and warm, all sorts of kind and sweet and gentle wrapped up in one small, mousy package.
“Seriously, mate?” Bill gawked, mouth hanging open, a chip in his hand, not quite reaching its designated area just yet.
When dinner time finally came, the two of them sauntered downstairs, chatting amicably with one another, Sherlock a bit quieter than usual, nervous and shaky, out of his comfort zone. But the second he met the woman standing beside the stove, her bags of shopping dropped beside the fridge, he realized he had nothing to worry about, well and truly.
The rugby captain laughed softly and nodded, beaming brightly up at the other boy before clearing his throat, and letting out a deep, self-encouraging sigh, “You wanna go celebrate?”

“I'm fine,” he answered, opening his eyes and spotting John, close, gazing at him with worried features, downturned and solemn, and Sherlock hated seeing John anything close to upset.
“But they watch you everyday, on your channel,” John stated, eyes narrowed and lips pursed in confusion as he awaited Sherlock’s response, his lunch now entirely forgotten.
“Oh, cut it out, Powers,” Greg huffed, glaring at the black-haired boy with a scolding scowl, “John’s just yet to be on the receiving end of his — of his...”
John gaped, “What? Why?”
Watson to lay one on you. He’s far too much of a gentlemen.”
Lifting his shoulders effortlessly, Sherlock glanced back down at the ground, as though ashamed or far too shy to answer whilst meeting John’s gaze, “It’s obvious.”
Scoffing in amusement, John frowned, “How come?”
Sherlock smiled, looking down shyly and eagerly, much to his own embarrassment, wrote back a response, trying his best to remain calm and collected, cool and calculating.
, and
John desperately told himself not to gape at the boy. He hadn’t known the complexity of his situation, his heart clenching with regret for Sherlock, so very alone in a world that hadn’t been kind to him. John internally shook his head — Sherlock wouldn’t be on his own; not anymore, not whilst John lived and breathed.
Sherlock sighed and shook his head, staring down at the drink in his hand, and sniffing it nervously before he turned and let it fall with a large thump into the garbage bin beside him.
John huffed as he stomped towards the rugby field, his mind ticking rapidly with thoughts on seemingly every little thing he had plaguing him in his life - his brain growled at Wilkes, hummed happily at the thought of talking to Sherlock again, groaned at the idea of playing rugby for two hours, and whirled with new evidence towards whom
The ashy blonde chuckled aloud, beaming brightly at the thin figure a little in front of him, blushing slightly at the compliment and bobbing his head gratefully. "Thank you, that's," He paused, scoffing softly and joyfully, "actually really amazing to hear."
“What? Can’t dance?” He smirked, winking gently at the brunette before him, and almost instantly the boy’s entire expression changed from fearful to fond, features lifting, a smirk of his own pulling at those sculpted lips. And then John was tugging him towards the dance floor, their hands interlocked, those long pale fingers burning into his own, warm and lovely and
He heard an ungodly sound escape his lips at the thought and feeling of John’s tongue pressed against his own and within seconds, Sherlock was drawing away, a hand clasping over his mouth in embarrassment as he turned his flushed face from John half-lidded eyes. The hands in his hair and on his hip slid off, and for a moment Sherlock was terrified he’d made John uncomfortable, sent him away, screwed this up yet again, but those same warm hands had now found their way onto his cheeks, a slightly calloused thumb sliding across the top of his cheekbone, wiping at raindrops and what was left of Sherlock’s painted on freckles.
Sherlock glanced to the side, glimpsing at Molly's sorrowful and somber expression, watching as she took a few steps towards him, hand outstretched, awaiting the comfort of his own. He blinked, turned and placed his palm on hers, unable to keep his fingers from trembling, or his face from paling. Hooper quirked a small smile, of which was meant to console his empty features as she dropped his hand, and took a step back, returning to her original place beside the lady in pink.
John sighed playfully, “I was gonna be an alien. Molly picked out a really good outfit for me, told me it brought out my eyes, all this shit, and then expected me to slip on a poncho over it after dinner.”
“Nothing’s happened,” Sherlock spat out, gave John a short once over, and continued on his march towards the school parking lot — his discretely hidden limp didn’t go unnoticed by John, neither did the way he held his left arm, wrapped carefully around his torso, half hugging himself.

“It’s healing good,” John beamed softly, leaning back in the seat, that warmth disappearing slightly from Sherlock’s side.
“Mysterious alien princess from the planet Blossom,” Molly corrected, pointing to the flower in her hair before reaching out to grab Lestrade, yanking him against her hip, “and the brave young explorer who falls for her.”
“You’ve been spending an awful lot of time with that sick freak, you realize,” Seb stated, taking a step closer to John’s solid position in front of Sherlock’s grounded form, his mouth twitching with bitter amusement, “so much so that the boys and I have started to worry.”
John hated to ask the question, worried that, maybe, Sherlock was; Sherlock fearing him, in any way, could not be tolerated, not for John, not this brilliant genius of a human being — John would have thoroughly failed as a person if Sherlock ever found himself hating him.
Molly snorted and shook her head, linking her arm with his and strolling beside him, a small, friendly but eager smile across her warm, lightly powdered features, “I’m only curious.”
Sherlock didn’t look up. He could almost feel the disappointment in that voice, in that tone. God, he’d missed it. He’d missed that reprimanding pitch, that laugh of rage, those biting remarks.
On top of this, things are not very comfortable at home and I haven't had much time to write with finals topping everything else off.

— John vowed to protect him, to care for him, at whatever cost.
“Why are you so determined to ruin everything for yourself?” Sherlock asked, running a frazzled and utterly irritated hand through his thick, brown curls.
Sherlock connected his phone to the studio stereo and quickly found what he was looking for -
“Watson,” The cruel, dark-haired harpy smirked, lifting a hand to pat his upper arm, bobbing his head as though providing some sort of confirmation — of what, John wasn’t sure, “The noble captain that led us to victory!”
John H. Watson: Okay, but have you ever found yourself so deeply infatuated that you’re sorta at a loss of what to do about it so it just comes out in the weirdest ways, like when you look at a box of cereal or drink your favourite tea?
“But?” Sherlock ventured, quietly.
Sherlock blushed and rolled his eyes, tucking his phone away into his jeans' pocket and heading for his next class, hoping, deep deep down, that there was no double meaning to this, that John genuinely had wanted his number, had really truly wanted to spend time with him, and that he wouldn’t turn out to be like everyone else.
“Yes.”
— because Sherlock Holmes was
“Why’s that?” Sherlock asked, and took a careful sip, ignoring the burn to his bottom lip.
“Wonderful!” She squeaked, put down her paintbrush and skipped over to John, standing before his position in her chair and grinning from ear to ear, much to John’s impending horror. In one smooth movement, she took both his cheeks in her hands and giggled, teeth bared and eyes wide, “You know what that means then?”
He was pale and skinny, and his arms and legs were too long, too lanky. His fingers were thin and spindly, and the dark curls atop his head were messy and a pain to put in place. His eyes were of a freakish nature; green, blue, silver, and gold all mixing to form some strange, brightly contrasting hue. He was different, both mentally and physically, and those around him knew so.
“And maths,” Sherlock muttered shyly.
Sunken eyes,

very comfortable, in fact, that he allowed himself an inch of bravery.
Sherlock gazed curiously at the small apartment building as John drove into a rather wide parking lot, the tall structure complete with dozens of arbitrary windows and mediocre balconies, the walls of the place creamy in color and a bit grungy with obvious aging. He couldn’t help a smile from spreading across his features at the look of the thing, inexpensive, yes, and not too appealing to the eye, but Sherlock already felt more at home here, knowing John resided somewhere behind those walls, than he ever had in his own house, large and overbearing, lonely and, for him, unsafe.
“Bunch of loons, huh?” John yelled above the noise, beaming up at Sherlock’s rather entranced expression. Sherlock let out a soft scoff and nodded his head, allowing himself a small smirk before they both followed Irene once more over to the refreshments counter where he spotted the familiar face of Mike Stamford, of whom stood dressed in an odd assortment of clothing, his face bearing a poorly done smattering of green paint, and a blowup pink alien in his arms, half of the size of his own figure.
“I’m absolute shite at explaining these kinds of things but,” John shrugged and turned back to face the ceiling, shutting his eyes and smiling, warm and genuine, “for some reason, now, everything seems even more surreal, even more magical.”
He sighed and nodded firmly, “I know.”
, the butterflies in his stomach for the boy beside him rooting his feet to the ground, arguing with his mind and keeping him from taking off and finding his own way home.
John laughed gently, swinging his legs off the bed and swaying towards his computer, booting it up as he lifted the screen and nodding quickly, "Yeah, 'course. I'll just do homework."
He was one of his uncle’s closest friends, managing to make nearly every Sunday get-together without delay, always sat drinking a glass of whiskey, readjusting his glasses and excelling at their poker game. Occasionally, when Sherlock had been allowed residence in their home during said poker games, he’d slip out of his room for nourishment, or hydration, sometimes even for bits and bobs that may help in satisfying missing components of his experiments. The men gathered around the table had always stared, always judged, nudging his uncle and cracking a joke or two, insulting and cruel, most of which Sherlock had learned to ignore — however, Magnusson did not. Charles Magnusson simply stared, eyes like slits, narrowed and curious, raking over the entirety of Sherlock’s nimble form. Why the man had taken a liking to him — skinny, oddly structured, alien-featured, and pale — he’d never know.
his mind shouted back at him.
: a boy??? Please let it be a boy
“I cannot comprehend
“I’m not a blushing virgin anymore, Victor,” Sherlock snapped, well aware that he’d never been with anyone else
He walked back over to his leather chair and reached for the violin, untouched and unmarked in all the commotion. Perfectly pristine — as usual. He sat once more and hugged the instrument to his chest, swallowing and staring blankly at the smashed remains of what had once been the inners of their kitchen cabinet.
And, based on the balance of probability, he’d find himself lost in the darkness by the end of next week.
: I love you
“When do you plan on kissing him then?” She asked next, turning to face him and eyeing the still full cup of ale in his hand before arching a sculpted, amused brow at the small gasp that escaped his lips.
All he wanted was numbness, all he wanted was
Within a few seconds, John was placing his school lunch down directly across from Sherlock Holmes, and sitting with a huff, removing his red backpack and shoving it on the floor beside him.
Retweeted by John H. Watson
“If you haven’t already,” Sherlock muttered under his breath, and tired not to focus on how very enchanting a sassy, sarcastically confident John Watson just happened to be.
“I,” He began and them seemingly started to change his mind, shaking his head and pursing his lips, “Sorry?”
John let out a sharp laugh, itching to keep the mood light, “Why do I get the feeling that you caused far too much trouble?”
John turned to him with a shy smile, his cheeks shifting to a faint pink as he lifted a hand to rub at the back of his neck, “Well, Molly and I are trying to find this anonymous YouTuber.”
and hitting shuffle. He reached for his headphones, lain clumsily on the edge of his bedside table, tangled and knotted, and quickly plugged them in. The soft, melancholy quivering of a violin sounded, warming his ears, and he instantly relaxed, letting out a deep much needed breath of relief and humming along quietly.
The slamming of a lunch tray, minus a banana, atop his table sent him jolting upwards in shock, his head flying to meet the eyes of a rather amused looking John Watson, his dark blonde hair practically shining in the fluorescent light, his eyes as oceanic as ever, and his lips plush and pink from where his tongue had been coursing over them constantly throughout the day, a habit of John’s.
“Look at me,” John stated, firmly but not cruelly, his body turned in the long, thin boy’s direction, waiting expectantly for the genius to meet his eyes. When he simply continued to gaze worriedly at his surroundings, John cleared his throat, took a deep breath and commanded, far louder, “
He watched as John ran a hand through his hair and shook his head, closing his eyes a moment, as though in thought, before giggling loudly, high-pitched and somewhat manic as he focused his attention on Sherlock again.
“I’m not sure I was invited.”
“What, why?” Sherlock frowned, removing the cigarette from his lips to talk properly before turning to face John, his nose wrinkling rather adorably as he looked on at the rugby captain with perplexity.
Sherlock’s chest warmed and he snorted, nodding his head the best he could in his state, and humming eerily to himself, throat rumbling out the tune of a song he hadn’t even recalled remembering.
Sherlock smiled and watched as John grabbed the second cup, carefully sauntering back toward him and handing it over with a wink, eye bright and mischievous, and Sherlock took the tea gently, their hands just brushing as he grabbled hold of the hot porcelain.
“Sherlock,” that voice said again, and hell, it was almost angelic.
“Shall we?” The boy with the ocean eyes asked kindly, his expression warm and gentle, as always, as he lifted a hand and gestured to his beat up antique of a car. Sherlock nodded and followed the boy, locking the house up behind him before turning back and watching as John opened the passenger door for him.
, nor his
, he thought to himself.
a melody he’d been meaning to dance to for ages now and leaned over to click the record button on the top of his camcorder.
“Hey Greg?” He uttered, voice tilted with eager curiosity.
Moran scoffed, stepping back and away from the other boy, his cheeks flushed pink and a slight tremor in his fingers as they clenched at his side, “Back out into the hall, all the way down, to your right.”
When he looked up and led his complex mind away from his foolish thoughts, he caught Molly watching him, her eyes weary and cautious, as though she knew just what he was thinking and why he was thinking it. He instantly looked away, dropping his sights back down to the food still sitting utterly motionless on his plate. Of course it was, though. It was food. It wasn’t like it would crawl away from him and leap out the window.
With a slow turn on the back of his heel, Sherlock poked his head out the door, arching a brow in suspicion, curious as to why she was holding him up, "What?"
“Need another drink?” He asked considerately, indicating with a flick of his head to the table behind him. Sherlock bit his bottom lip and smiled shyly, shaking his head to the offer before clearing his throat and running a hand over his gelled-back curls, slick and entirely too-handsome for John’s entirely enamored heart.
Sherlock huffed and inwardly swore at his impulsiveness, reaching back into his duffle and pulling out his phone, scooting up with his back against the mirror and hunching over his knees, propping the video up and watching intently as it began to play.
“Oi,” John called out, loud as he could through the flow of falling water, “git!”
John watched him for a moment before he, too, fell down into a horizontal position beside Sherlock, their shoulders touching, hips only a few inches apart, lying identically, side by side, in the quiet of John’s peaceful bedroom, the rain falling down outside the only sound aside from their breathing.
John chuckled, high pitched and far too adorable for Sherlock’s well being, “That’s right; you’re far too clever to get caught anyway.”
— no, too short,
"Let's have a big hand for our very first volunteer, Molly
Sherlock, his mind allowing him one moment of clarity, scoffed and nodded, his eyes raking over Sebastian’s entirety — trousers unbuttoned and zipped half way down, shirt untucked, hair ruffled and messy, the sign he’d used to contribute to the theme and costumes long gone.
Sherlock chewed on his bottom lip, “I have homework.”
“Like you’re drowning yourself, to me,” John snapped back playfully, grinning wide and shaking his head at the boy as he pressed on whilst John allowed his car to roll slowly beside his striding form. He watched as Sherlock’s steps faltered a bit and a smile quirked at those pink lips, before the genius kept on, shoes splashing wildly against the gravel.
He knew it was her before he even turned around to witness her lithe figure approaching the stage at high speed, her expression twisted in agony, her voice desperate to be heard. Sentiment, he told himself as he gazed in disbelief, watching her take her sister's place, all while her younger sibling screamed her name as she was dragged off by Peacekeeper's of whom were most likely taking her to her mother somewhere in the crowd.
— smile matching the rest of her self-satisfied appearance.
party,” John corrected with an amused giggle, one of the ones that Sherlock absolutely adored, the ones that were high-pitched and sing-songy, the ones that made you want to laugh alongside him, “And I’ve thought about it.”
Another two hours passed before he realized the reason for his sudden blindness was simply because he hadn’t been able to cease his tears.
“Relax,” Sherlock sighed, pulling his bed sheets up to his shoulders and over his bare body in shame, heart thrumming rapidly in his chest and expression twisting into a wince at the sticky mess beneath the duvet.
"That was weird." Mike snorted, catching up to him and walking beside his team captain as they headed out the two doors that served as the entrance to the gym, turning and sauntering in the direction of the large, green field where a few of their team members already sat, stretching.
,” John laughed shyly, and chewed on his bottom lip, readjusting his backpack for what felt like the hundredth time and admiring the top of Sherlock’s curly head, “it means a lot, you know?”
“They’re different,” Sherlock mumbled, a bit desperately.
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably, swallowing and gazing directly ahead at the shop’s menu, blank expression masking the joy thumping in his chest, right next to the beating of his nervous heart, “That’s not what people normally say.”
John swallowed and looked down, his heart clenching, both with how much Sherlock had been willing to share with him and the idea that the dancer had bared witness to any account of vile intoxication — he wasn’t sure the extent of ‘
In three minutes, Sherlock Holmes could do a lot of things.
"Well, go on you two," The pink lady encouraged, "shake hands."
John heard more than felt the small, nervously irritated squeak that escaped his mouth and he groaned, turning away from his friend and staring after Sherlock, his eyes wide with worry, the corners of his mouth downturned as dread sat on his shoulders and whispered
John smiled down at his brown Oxford’s and nodded, biting his lip and silently cursing the blush that tinted his cheeks, “Bloody unreal.”
John swallowed and slowly, casually, looked around at the other students, taking note of the page they were on and quickly flipping his own copy to its rightful place, before going back to their stimulating conversation.
in love with one of them.
: I hate bullies.
His friend turned entirely red at his words and John instantly gave himself a point on his mental tally chart — hypocrites, they were; telling him to make his move with Sherlock when they’d been pining over one another for more than a year.
“Let me look,” John huffed out before reaching forwards and placing a hand on Sherlock’s jaw, to which he flinched away from, violently — not because he was scared,
finish that
John nodded and swallowed before reciting, "Someone told me to 'steal Coach the Roach's TARDIS and vlog the entire thing.'"
Sherlock arched a brow, “I’m not sure that’s how it works, John.”
John was aware Sherlock probably didn't trust him, but he’d prove to him his intentions were purely innocent.
A crush wasn’t enough to explain watching the same videos of the same person over and over and over again nearly everyday; a crush wasn’t enough to explain staring at the back of the same person’s head in Literature class for hours on end; a crush wasn’t enough to explain the swell in his heart every time he thought of those enchanting oceans; a crush wasn’t enough to explain the way he wanted to divulge each and every secret he kept dear to the same person, of whom he’d hardly had the guts to speak to until recently; a crush wasn’t enough to explain
With a huff, and as he pushed by the newcomers, he readjusted the position his satchel hung from his shoulder and wiped at his lips with his sleeve rhythmically, checking for any blood and simply to soothe, their plump form left feeling red and swollen. Victor completed everything as though he were standing on a battleground — even kissing was something to be won, when Sherlock had been under the impression that locking lips was like dancing, teamwork and a partner all too important for satisfaction as the end result. Clearly he was wrong — Victor fought a war on his lips,
Molly blinked, “And?”
His friend giggled and tossed the trousers at him before sauntering over to his closet, opening the wooden doors and digging through the many jackets and jumpers, her eyes fixed on what she was doing, though she continued their conversation.
Please leave me some love!
muttered into the confines of the small bathroom walls.
. It was all so very surreal, so much so Sherlock’s head was spinning, his heart was beating at unhealthy rates, and his gut was twisting with both nervous excitement and utter dread.
Ignoring his gruesomely hideous face in the mirror, he held both bags by their straps, one on each shoulder, and made his way out of one of Baker's ever-so-not-clean restrooms, angrily hauling the heavy door open, only to run directly into another human being, sending himself suddenly tumbling backwards.
Sherlock held back a groan, throwing his head forwards and pressing his palms against the sink, hair hanging down across his forehead as he shut his eyes and softly mumbled back a response, heaving out a weak, “What?”
,” He snapped, bearing his teeth in a wickedly, dreadful smirk, “what, you forget to eat or something?”
“What do you mean?”
“Have you told him?” Greg asked, brows lifted and expression warm, sincere.
“The night,” John added and shrugged effortlessly, fighting the urge to pull Sherlock against him and hold him close, so he’d never leave his side again. “You can stay.”
Sherlock scoffed and glanced over at the tray of food he’d bothered to acquire earlier, for no specific reason other than the fact that he’d been rather parched. He’d left all the edible bits he’d been required to get as well on their rightful plates, practically turning up his nose at their disgusting consistencies and unnatural coloring. But, there on his tray, sat a banana, and Sherlock quite obviously saw it as an opportunity.
"Sherlock," John's voice beckoned, soft and careful and gentle, "
He ran slender fingers through his hair and shook out some of the wetness, water droplets flying this way and that as he bent down, tucking his previous clothes, a boring old jumper and skinny jeans, away and grabbing his duffle, hoisting it carefully over his shoulder. He snatched up his phone and tapped the screen.
: yesss she’s so cute
And so it left Sherlock in a state of indecision, pushing open the doors to the studio and glancing at himself in the many mirrors, the urge to write out a small, superfluous message to the rugby team’s captain tickling the ends of his fingers. He slowly placed his hand over his pocket, feeling the rim of his mobile and pondering quietly to himself, chewing on his bottom lip with uncertainty.

Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
In one solid motion, John lifted his head and fixed her with the most telling expression he could possibly muster. And he saw the exact moment she realized his hidden, unspoken words, her features widening in complete and utter surprise, before her initial shock melted into a face both amused and smug.
Funny — how well the entirety of his view resembled his very life, how symbolic it all was. The dam that had kept him together, kept all his pieces afloat, kept his mind intact, had snapped and cracked and broken, broken completely, and now the entirety of his innermost thoughts were in shambles.
Molly nodded and stood, smiling wearily at Effie’s friendly expression. Sherlock simply stood as well, following silently as Effie led them from the fancy room, passing the rows of cakes and different snacks and the chandeliers and the glass and gold tables. Sherlock shook his head softly, pondering how just earlier that day he had been sitting in the woods, dreading the reaping, and now he was tribute, a possible victor, awaiting either his death, a ruthless end, or his triumph, a victorious champion of District Twelve.

Molly made a skeptical, throaty noise and went back to her painting, though she still remained slightly tilted toward him, as though she weren’t completely finished with her good-natured accusations.
Sherlock shrugged a single shoulder, his hands still pocketed, “Everyone.” He signified his point by glancing around the cafeteria, observing the other students chucking food at one another, laughing through their obnoxious chewing, jabbing fingers at their friends, lifting milk cartons haphazardly into the air – an awful bunch really. There should be no weight to their opinions. They were all idiots. So why did it bother Sherlock so much? Why did it

slowly — towards the student’s car park. It didn’t take long for John to break into a sprint and come up behind him, now changed into proper clothing, jeans and a beige jumper over a checkered, faded red and white shirt. He placed a hand on the boy’s shoulder, mouth opening in order to startup a conversation with his newfound friend.

With a roll of his eyes, Sherlock let out a huff, “Oh, right. Yes. Good on you. I guess chivalry really isn’t dead.”
