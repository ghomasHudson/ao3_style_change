“During our fight, he stomped my leg. Along with other small injuries,” he said, wincing.
“I’m not seeing anyone Sherlock,” he said quickly. Defensively. He didn’t look ashamed, though. He wasn’t seeing anyone though. After him telling me about his cheating on Mary, I doubted he’d ever date again. He’s still ashamed, and he’s still feeling guilty. So no, he wasn't seeing anyone.
I could still hear the music from where I stood outside. I played my violin at John’s wedding. I got many compliments. It was fun. John and Mary loved it. It was fun. I was happy.
“I don’t think I’d have any shirts in there that would fit you,” I told him leaning in the doorway.
“Sherlock,” I whispered into his chest. I looked up to meet his eyes. He was blushing so perfectly. He was bashful in nature, which is so adorable. “Hmm?” he said. I moved my hands from his shoulders, and brought them to his neck, pulling him gently closer to me. His eyes were wide with something I didn’t quite recognize. I decided that I better ask. “Can I kiss you?” I asked him. I felt his pulse. He taught me that trick.
“Letters?” John said, munching on some sort of vegetable.
I laughed as my phone rang. “Hello?” I said as he hugged me. It was a new victim. New signature. Interesting. “Alright I’ll be there in thirty.” I hung up the phone.
“No. No! I was just about to sit.” He sat and started to eat the food that was left out for him. “This is good, hmm?” he said, awkwardly.
“Apparently you like childish,” he said. I looked up at him and narrowed my eyes. He gave me a flirty smile.
“Ready to go?” he asked. He wasn’t looking me in my eye, but he was looking at my face, though. I smiled and walked with him as my stomach did somersaults. What is this feeling? What was it about him that made it so hard to push these feelings down?
“Y-yes,” he said, calming his breath, and leaning down. It was painfully slow. Our lips almost touched when the unholy cry of the kettle cut through the moment. “Fuck,” I whined under my breath. “Tea?” I asked him, smiling.
“What do we-”
I wrote the speech the best I could. I poured what little bit of my heart and soul I had left just for John. Was it perfect? Is this right? It had to be. The sun was starting to rise. I had stayed up all night. I had to hurry and shower, change, and consume large amounts of caffeine before I met John. It was going to be a long day. Most days are long in Hell, though.
I took a long sip of my tea, and stared intensely at the suddenly very interesting cup. “Just nerves, Mrs. Hudson,” I managed to choke out. “Oh no, I think it goes a little deeper than that,” she said, taking a seat by me. “Are you sure you boys are ready for this yet?” she asked. “After all you two have been through?” she said.
“Well,” I said, clearing my throat. “We talk, eat, drink, possibly too much drinking, and after that we watch a movie,” I said.
He chuckled anyway. He gave a large smile I had grown so accustomed to. It was a smile I hate that I have to share. It isn’t fair. Why should he give me this look, but then also give it to, What’s her name? Sarah? Lillian? Beth? I can’t even remember anymore. I am in all honesty not sure if I had bothered to learn it to begin with.
“Okay, Mr. We’re-not-a-couple and Mr. Married-to-my-work!” Lestrade yelled.
“Do I really look like I am in any mood to poison you tonight?” I asked, taking a sip of mine.
I didn’t hear him anymore so I got out. I turned off the water, and I wrapped a towel around myself. I stepped out into the hallway and into my room where John was standing by my dresser. His back was to me.
“Yes I do!” she giggled. “Daddy says.”
“Nothing helpful,” I said, as I watched him remove his jacket and roll up his sleeves to his elbows. There is something so attractive about that. I don’t really get it, but god damn.
“So stressed are we?” she asked as I brought the whip down against the dead man.
“I would hope.”
Sherlock ran down the stairs. He had been away for nine minutes. He was nervous too. That helped ease me a little. He was wearing the purple shirt that he swears still fits him. It is a tad bit tight. He wore that shirt with his suit. His curls were damp. He smiled sheepishly. “Hello John,” he said.
“Because it is a waste!” I retaliated.
“Here,” I said, handing him the tea.
“I think that you are trying to cover up your feelings in false cockiness and fake disgust because you don’t want to be rejected like you did Molly over and over,” he said, way too proud of himself. He thought he was so smart, didn't he? God he is so dumb sometimes. So sure of himself. He thought he could see right through me. Isn’t he foolish? Isn’t that adorable. Not that I put value to those sorts of things.
That was how we spent our honeymoon. Bickering, loving, and catching a couple of killers. Fun time. I definitely have a space in my mind palace for it. Rosie has her own wing. I remember everything about her. I don’t want to forget a detail.
I would usually ask him how he had figured it out, but instead I said, “You are truly remarkable.” He smiled. “I know,” he said.
No one moved. The room filled with deafening silence. I looked at John. “John, did I do something wrong? I don’t understand?” I said, panic setting in. I have a tendency to ruin these sorts of things. Today was supposed to be perfect. Had I ruined it?
JW: Good. :)
We laughed. “Yes, you may?” I said. He took my face in his hands, and brought our lips together. This one was different from the one I had given him. It was stiff at first. Mostly because I was not accustomed to this. I eventually relaxed into the kiss. It was sweet and slow. We were experimenting, after all. I explored his mouth with my tongue. I wrapped my arms around him, and John had his hands in my hair.
“You can bring it home with you?” I said,  hopefully.
“That’s the plan.”
“Quite,” I said.
I felt something brush against my side around my hip area. I am extremely ticklish almost everywhere so I jolted. When I did the soup went everywhere. It was extremely hot.
“Yes hello. Are we still on for tonight?” Sherlock asked. He was nervous. I smiled despite myself. This is the Sherlock he thinks he hides well, and maybe he does, but he can’t hide from me. This is what I am going to focus on. Not her betrayal, not her death. Nothing but him. I smiled. “Yeah, we are,” I told him. I could hear the smile in his voice as he said, “Good, I thought as such, but it doesn’t hurt to check.”
“Then let's go pick out a ring,” he said, wrapping his arm around me in a friendly gesture. “I am so proud of you.”
“Do you really want to talk about this...now?” John asked, alarmed. He hasn’t come up with a good lie yet. Good. “Yes,” I said. “I do. Now why were you avoiding me?” I asked. He didn’t look at me. He didn’t say anything for a while. “It’s not that simple Sherlock. It’s complicated,” he started.
“John, come here please!’ he called. I walked back into the living room. “Yeah?” I said. He turned out the lights and then turned on the flashlight on his phone while classical music played through its speakers. I laughed at how much of a dork he is. “Come and dance with me,” he said, beckoning me to come closer. I complied and let myself be pulled to him.
“I don’t know,” I said, cutting him off again.
“Molly?” I said. She looked up at me.
“I’ve missed you,” I said before I could stop myself. I felt that tightness in my chest and the heat on my cheeks. Oh god what have I done?
I stared him down. “Yes,” he said. “It was stupid and I’m sorry.”
“He doesn’t. I don’t know what this could be,” I said. He set down the coffee mugs and came up behind me. He wrapped his arms around me. He let his head rest on my shoulder. “Maybe it’s a lead?” he asked.
The next thing I knew, we were at my flat. “After you doctor,” he said, stepping aside so I can unlock the door. I did, and we walked inside. “You can put your coat anywhere,” I told him, removing mine. I don’t know why I said anything, he was going to do what he wanted either way. I went into the kitchen and put on some tea. He was scrolling through his phone.
“It’s not necessary. It’s not that big of a deal Sherlock, really,” she said, picking up Rosie’s diaper bag. “You did what you had to. I get that. You thought you had to save me. You don’t love me, that’s fine.” She turned at her heel and began to briskly walk to the door.
We went to a cafe nearby. We got our drinks and sat by the window. She gave me a friendly smile and gave none of the usual flirting signs she usually did. It was a relief, to say the least. I genuinely liked Molly but not that way.
“Yeah,” John said. “Sherlock?” he said after a moment. I looked at him and raised my eyebrows, implying that he had my attention. “Does this mean you’ll be willing to be my boyfriend?” he asked, nervously.
“Well, I think we should get going before we miss our reservation,” Sherlock said. “Oh yeah,” I said. “We’re off Mrs. Hudson!” I called.
He nodded. I started to wrap it up tightly. He winced. “Sorry,” I said before I thought.
I smiled to cover up a wince as I put the frozen peas on my head. I handed one bag to him. “Don’t be. If you hadn’t suspected me of such, I would think you are more of an idiot than you are. I am pleased to know you’re learning,” I said.
“You always made him do the killing. You prefered to watch.” I said, approaching him slowly.
“Yes,” I said. There was more silence, but this one was long. It was cruelly long. “I know this may be a shock. I could understand if…”
“So if we want to find out what’s wrong with John, let’s go back to when this first started?” she said, taking a sip from her cup.
It’s a simple trick that I can’t believe that I fell for. It’s one thing for people to make jokes or insinuate that John and I are together, but it was another to be directly asked if I had feelings for him. The body has a way of betraying the mind that sometimes can’t be hidden. It really wasn’t my fault.
“Oh uhh Sherlock made reservations and I have plans to watch a movie afterwards,” I said, sipping my tea, avoiding her eyes. Few know this, but she has a piercing stare that makes you talk despite your not wanting to. Her gaze can cut through your soul, and deep into your heart. “Are you okay, dearie?” she asked gently. “You don’t look to be yourself?” she said.
He leaned in and whispered, “Wait till our honeymoon.”
“Then what’s with the sudden energy?” she asked, cringing at the sound the whip made against the body.
John H. Watson.
“You’re nicely dressed, you had something important to do today, your wife is dead. Job interview. Although that doesn’t explain that particular cologne. It’s strong. Too strong for a job interview…” I said, realization hitting me.
I called John. “Do you still need that favor?” I asked.
“I thought you were at home?” I yelled back, throwing on the first pair of sweatpants that I found and a t-shirt from off the ground. I was in my house alone and I detest clothes, so I decided to be naked. I am now regretting that choice as I walk downstairs to where he was to see him in fairly decent clothes. I passed by a mirror on the way down. I looked like hell.
“Lesbien.”
“I understand,” I said, standing. “I’ll see you next week.”
“No? It’s 8, you were home, and I know you don’t cook. I brought food. I hope that’s okay?” he asked.
“You have nothing to apologize for,” she said.
I blushed at the realization. “John?” I said. His eyes snapped up to mine.
“Yes,” was all he managed. I brought him to me. It was gentle and slow. I licked his lips, hoping I wouldn’t have to tell him to open his mouth. He reluctantly opened up and I explored his mouth. He sighed into it eventually and seemingly began to enjoy it. He started copying my movements with his tongue.
“And do you take him to be your lawfully wedded husband?” she asked me.
“So we both-”
I could smell mint and wine on his breath. He was so close. His closeness was consuming me. I struggled to keep my breath steady. It felt like an eternity, and I didn’t mind it. He leaned into my ear and whispered, “I’ll teach you.”
He and Rosie moved in last month. We share a room now. I redecorated his old room for Rosie. Yellow color scheme. Happier. Gender neutral. I am not going to force gender norms on anyone, least especially a baby.
He licked his lips and appeared to think about it.
“I get you’re a ‘Hopeless romantic’, but I find this disgusting and appetite ruining. Can we leave now?” I whined.
I decided I would write him a letter, not that I ever intended John to read it. Not after all that happened. I went up to my room, got comfortable, and I let my mind go. It almost felt like I blacked out. I had little to no control.
I love you boys, and I’m so sorry for the Hell I put you through.
“I said-”
“Yes, her betrayal bothered me. Her death was a shock, but it has nothing to do with how this is going. I think that I, we, are just nervous,” I said. He looked at me, searching. His eyes told me that even though he would never admit it, he needed this. He needed a good night with good company. He had been through so much. I put him through so much. He needed one night of just fun. A night with no worries. He needed this.
I licked my lips, straightened up in my chair and nodded. I took in a deep breath, and I told her all about it.
I looked at him. He knew he should have gone for the man with the gun first, but he still went for the man who had me. He was trying to save me, despite his better judgement, he tried to save me anyway.
“It wasn’t just bus girl. It was you too. I loved the both of you. I loved you both differently, but I still loved you both. Adultery of the heart, is what I think it’s called. I’d be lying with her, but I’d be thinking of you,” he said.
“I’m burning this. I can’t erase it from your brain, but I can get rid of it for good.” He ran off.
“They are a professional, Sherlock. Maybe you should just try what they said?” he said.
John stopped. He turned to see what I had in my hand. His eyes widened. “Sherlock?” he said, holding his letter in his hand over the stove.
“Oh,” he said, standing stiffly.
“Do what?” he asked as though his ego had been wounded.
“Yes.”
“Stop, I can feel my brain turning to rotting,” I groaned.
He gave a small smile and we rode in silence to the restaurant. I was surprised by how nice it was. It was the kind of place Sherlock hated. He was a man of habit, so the change was welcome but surprising, nonetheless. We were seated at a table with lit candles, very normal sort of romantic. I briefly wondered where Sherlock even heard of this place. He looked at me, waiting for something. That was when I realized that I remembered the place. We had stopped a murder from accuring there about a year or so ago.
-Mary”
“It’s odd. I thought that the break would do me some good, but now I don’t know what to do with myself,” John said. “I don’t know why Molly wanted to keep her for the night so badly.”
“I wrote it about a month after knowing you. I didn’t realize I was falling in love with you. I just knew this is what I felt. Now I feel stupid,” he confessed.
I went up stairs as he sat at the table. I was terrified, so I used that energy to clean up my room a bit. I threw the clothes into the closet and I made my bed. I put on a shirt, and I straightened up the dressers and such.
“Molly!”
“Dear John,
“Then why? What did I do so wrong?” I demanded. I knew that I hadn’t really done anything wrong. I was honestly just trying to push his buttons. He was tired and would soon be too frustrated to lie. I wanted the truth.
Finally!
“It was bound to happen one way or another, I suppose,” I said.
I smiled and walked over to him. One thing led to another and I had somehow made it into his lap. I was in all honesty, lost to the moment. I craved closeness and clothes were just a hindrance. I figured Sherlock did too because he kept playing with the buttons of my trousers. “Take them off,” I told him. “No,” he said, still playing with them. He broke the kiss, and smiled wickedly. “I can’t. Doctor’s orders,” he laughed.
He crawled into that spot, and we laid there together. I quickly found out he was an aggressive cuddler. He had a death grip on me, and I didn’t mind it too much. I loved this closeness. I kissed him and fell asleep despite the mild discomfort in my lower region.
“What will it take to get you out of here?” I was ready to negotiate. The noise grew, and I could feel the walls closing around me. I kept myself calm, but barely. I had to hurry and get out of there.
We did this for a while. She had described Donovan, Anderson, Lestraude, and a few more of our acquaintances. A few of them were marital issues. Others were medical. Lestraude should really talk to a doctor.
“Yes it was,” he said. His eyes weren’t on mine, a little lower, like I’ve seen him do many times before. Not my eyes or my nose. He was watching my lips.
“Y-you’ve been deducing me?” John was having trouble speaking.
“The spouses will now exchange vows.”
“Daddy,” she said, pouting.
Not that I care. Why would I, after all?
“Sherlock, you read all the letters. Did it sound like I would be over it anytime soon?” he asked.
Rosie waddled in with her little three year old charm. “I-iot,” she said, bouncing her hand on my hair. I laughed and kissed her on her little cheek. I wrapped her and my fiance in a hug.
I kissed him along his jawline and his cheeks. I kissed down his neck and kissed his collarbone. He pulled me up to meet his face. “If you really want, I’m okay with you keeping them,” he said.
He held me close, but left some room for someone, because Sherlock doesn’t believe in Jesus. He kept me at a safe distance, but I was growing tired of safe. I wanted to do what I wanted. That's what I did too. I closed the space between us. I rested my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat that was quickly accelerating. He was nervous. We were barely moving. I can’t dance, after all. This was much less about dancing, and more of an excuse to be close. I wanted to be as close as I could. I never wanted to let him go.
He had left that letter at my grave when I “Died”. He left a few more, but this was the only one I kept hidden enough for Mycroft not to get rid of it when I “Went away”. His words were beautiful. I had never read poetry quite like what he wrote about me. It got me through the tourture. I had every intention of finding him, breaking the news, and then telling him I had no idea how he felt. That I loved him too.
“But, if you want you can touch me. Your hands don’t have to stay by your side, if you don’t want them to.” He looked at his hands curiously. “Don’t overthink this Sherlock. I know that is pretty impossible for you, but why don’t you try to think of this like an experiment?” I asked.
“Sure, sounds good,” he said, his voice slightly raised in pitch. Why?
I heard him downstairs. “Sherlock?” he yelled.
He laughed, which I decided meant that he agreed to me being the doctor tonight. I went and retrieved the brown elastic bandage. I brought it back with me. “You cannot be serious?” he said.
“Comfy?” he asked me.
“Dear Sherlock, when I met you, I didn’t know what to think. I didn’t expect us to become friends as fast as we did. I never thought that I would ever get here. I never thought I would call you my husband. It is a nice surprise. A very welcome one. You were there for me as much as you knew how. So I vow that I will try to understand your thought process. You are the kindest, funniest, most clever man that I ever got the honor of meeting. You are a royal pain in my ass, but I can’t imagine a day without you anymore. I vow to bicker back always. I vow to act like I never heard the same story you’ve told me a million times. I swear to make it my duty to keep you off tobacco. I will clean just so you have something to do when you’re bored. I vow to love you to the best of my ability. I know that I may not show you in ways that you can easily pick up on that I love you. Therefore, I vow to never make you have to question if I love you or not. I love you Sherlock. I love you. I promise that I love you. That is my vow. To love you like you deserve.”
“Well I just wanted to be sure!” John said.
“Oh don’t tell me you pulled the ‘It isn’t you, it’s me,’ thing. If so, I hope she slapped the hell out of you.”
“No, no, no,” he said, as I fidgeted with the sleeve of my coat. “I may not be as smart as you, but I have learned a thing or two.” I scoffed, trying to get him to second guess. Please decide you’re being stupid. Please, I begged in my head. I don’t know why I was panicking. I had nothing to hide.
“You aren’t actually going to make me guess are you?” I said.
“Sense when?” John asked, relief filling his voice.
I looked at John. “I guess it’s supposed to be a wedding gift?” I shrugged. I set down the note card. I looked at the small stack of white papers in my lap.
“Were we dating before?” he asked. “Because we did that frequently, and I don’t remember it being this awkward?” he said. He swirled his drink. I sat there for a second. Was this a bad idea? Should we just forget this ever happened?
I know that’s selfish. That’s incredibly cruel of me. I have no right. This wedding is my fault after all. If I hadn’t faked my death, John and Mary would have never met. I would be solving a case right now while John would tell me that I need to sleep.
“Lost track of time,” he said with a strange change in pitch. It wasn’t his normal voice. It was rougher, for some reason.
“You’re taking forever and you are clearly not fine. Let's get to the flat to lick out wounds,” I said, wrapping his arm around my neck as I wrapped mine around his waist to steady him. His breath caught either from the closeness and the unfamiliarity of my touch or from the pain. Maybe both.
“Do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?” she asked John.
“Sherlock, I know you. You have feelings like every other person on the face of the Earth,” he sighed. “I honestly don’t understand what you have against feeling things. It’s completely natural and it can be-” he started, but I was tired of the conversation so I started snoring obnoxiously loud. “See? There you go! Why do you hate talking about this?” John asked.
I was confused for a second until she said, “I took your pulse.”
“I’m sorry, but I don’t see any value in your fantasy,” I said, opening the door to our flat.
“Did you say she can have cake?” I asked John.
He kept his hands to his sides. I noticed this and broke the kiss. “What?” he panted, worried. “Am I doing something wrong?” “No,” I said.
“Murder, John. The game is on!”
I watched the way his eyes moved, the way hands fixed hairs that weren’t out of place. The way he mirrored my stance. He leaned in so slightly that it took a trained eye to notice. His pupils were dilated.
“That sounds like a lovely idea. You need to talk to her,” she said. “May I offer some advice?” she asked.
John never used emojis or emoticons. Why is he now?
“Not too far from here,” I said, gaining my ability to speak again. He nodded and kept walking. We talked about our friends and things like shows Sherlock had binged. It was pleasant and comfortable. He pointed out people as we walked. “Her son is getting married. He got a puppy and is very excited about it. That little girl has pulled a tooth without her parents’ knowledge, and is letting the blood pool in her mouth to scare the living Hell from them,” he chuckled.
The room erupted in cheers and laughter. “So is that a yes?” I asked.
“So? They have ‘Scientific evidence’ of ghosts too. Look, I am not saying it’s not real, but I don’t understand it. I don’t understand how people will give up themselves for another person who possibly doesn’t feel the same way?” I said, realizing that I may have given him too much to work with.
I briefly considered just giving a confession of my own, but there was a very small part of me that screamed, “What if I’m wrong? I’d lose John forever! I will never get over the humiliation!” I knew it was pathetic. The subconscious actions of a person doesn’t lie. However, what if I interpreted something wrong? All the signs say one thing, but what if they mean another? I couldn’t imagine continuing to go on with life with John. I needed him to say how he felt.
“John?” He pulled out a ring box from his pocket.
“You did nothing wrong!” he yelled. “Can’t we drop this? Why do you even care?” Oh, he was trying to redirect the topic. Not today Watson.
“This could change everything.”
But this happiness was Hell.
“Me? How so?” I asked, voice raising a little.
“No I don’t!” I tried to defend myself. She raised her eyebrows. She didn’t look as though she was buying it. Hell, I wasn’t buying it myself.
“I guess we do have things to talk about?’ he asked.
“Under her crib. I’m exhausted,” he said.
“Bossy,” he teased.
“I am more than ready.”
“I guess I could have figured it out. I’m sorry that you came out like this,” she said.
I walked into the room. “Hey,” I said.
I woke up to the sound of giggling. Molly and Lestraude were at the foot of the couch. His eyebrows were raised. Molly could hardly seem to contain herself. I glared at them.
“Why did you keep them? Was it funny to you? What did you think? ‘Look how broken he is without me’? I would ask if you knew the Hell I went through, but you clearly do!” he yelled.
He whipped around quickly. He had on one of my shirts and a pair of pajama pants on. He looked at me like I caught him doing something wrong.
“Nope,” I said, giving Rosie my finger. She swung it up and down in her baby death grip. She was growing fussy. She made little whining sounds and was getting a little red in the face. She was ready for a nap. She had a nice bath before coming to see aunty Molly. Her little stomach was nice and full. That always meant she was ready for a nap. I dressed her in a little yellow onesie that came with a baby tutu. Only the best for her.
“Anyone in particular?” he asked.
I walked over to where he sat. I sat on the arm of the couch, and I let myself slide to lay across his lap. He smiled down at me and played with my hair.
John smiled at me. He took out a piece of paper and began to read.
“Say bye bye to Sherlock, Rosie.”
We paid for the check, not eating and we decided to go for a walk. We stood closer than we originally would have dared. I could smell him, and I could feel the heat radiating off his skin. I felt his hand brush gently against mine. It was too long for it to be an accident. He was rambling about a case, not looking at me. I smiled to myself and brushed my hand against his. We went back and forth for a while until our hands finally clasped together. His were warm, and had a few smooth scars offsetted by the occasional rough spot. It felt nice, and his face was better. Did he really have me convinced he didn’t like me? He’s so bloody obvious. He’s always been.
Not me. Never me.
“Oh! I must help plan this wedding boys. I called it first,” Mrs. Hudson said.
He looked up at me. “What? Sherlock, use your damned words, please,” John said.
“Hmm?” I said.
“Will you, as these people as witnesses, give me the great honor of making you my wife?” he asked loudly.
“That’s not even how she sounds!”
But I somehow got on this topic. I don’t know how. Oh yes, letters. What is it with therapists and letters? She wanted me to write an apology to Molly. I told her that letters are a dumb idea. We went down a rabbit hole.
I tried to walk at a slow, steady pace. I didn’t want to show up too early, but I didn’t want to be late either. Would I look too eager if I showed up directly on time? I hadn’t considered the possibility that I would show up almost thirty minutes before. Damn. I was going to walk away, but Mrs. Hudson practically pulled me into the flat. She had apparently been watching for me by her own accord. “John Watson! Come in and share a cup of tea with me! Sherlock will be ready before long. Come and talk to me for a while,” she demanded gently in the way that only an older woman can.
I looked at him. “You got Chinese from that place?” I asked.
“No,” I said.
“No! I’ve almost got it!” I turned to face him.
“Sherlock, I know how you love my husband. I know. I always knew. You can fool him, and maybe most of the world, but you can’t fool me. So I’m going to apologize to you. I’m sorry. You probably hate me. I don’t know how you do it. Because there were moments when I wanted to kill you. He would run to you, always. This isn’t me bashing you. No one can help who they love. When you helped plan our wedding, I couldn’t wrap my head around it. The amount of pain in your eyes when he wasn’t looking. You know, he called you selfish once. He said that it was in your nature when you were dead. I now see he was just hurt. You never made a move while we were together. I was still jealous of the two of you sometimes, you know. Even after we married. Even when he was mad at you, I could tell he loved you. He holds you on a pedestal. He’ll always run to you. He can’t help himself. That’s why you have to save him. I’ll have more details in the video. BURN THIS NOTE
“You what?” Lestraude yelled in the alley where I had him meet me. I rubbed at my arm. Nicotine patches were so uncomfortable, but I needed the brain power.
“Girlfriends aren’t my area.”
She hailed a cab. She made Rosie wave “Bye bye” at me as they rode past.
“Dance? But I thought-?”
I sat and solved and waited. I listened to the comfortably familiar sounds of John moving through the flat. I felt something give me a jolt of energy that I didn’t recognize. He showered, dressed, and walked into the kitchen. I had this all planned. I had made breakfast like Mrs.Hudson would have normally done. I made tea and told her if she ever mentioned this again I will tell the ladies in her book club about her and Mr. Whatever-his-name-is.
“No, you put God knows what in the microwave. I will not be eating a damned thing that goes into that,” he stated sternly.
“Whether you come out to everyone else is your business, but you have nothing to worry about. They won’t think of you any differently.”
“Yes. Yes. Yes. A million times yes,” she squealed, throwing herself at him. The restaurant cheered. I had to hurry and leave.
“But…are you sure?”
But I couldn’t say a word. I found myself at a complete loss. John’s feelings were obvious, or did I just want to believe that? Was I giving myself false hope? What would he think of me? How the hell do I do this?
He stopped. “Nothing, I just. Wow. Okay. Sherlock, is this your way of saying you reciprocate my feelings?” John asked. I nodded, seeing as that was the only thing I was able to do. I brought my knees to my chest and held them there, feeling suddenly self-connsious.
I decided to put the generic things everyone put in these. A mildly embarrassing story and wishes for them to live long, happy lives together. The words were empty, however. I didn’t want them together at all. I still wanted them to live long and happy, yes, just separate.
“It is,” I said. “I wanted to give us a little extra time.”
Me: sure
“Do you want something else? I brought other food. Why not get some soup?” he offered.
“Fuck John, if I had bloody words to explain, don’t you think I would have used them by now?” I snapped.
When we got to Andre’s, he was still telling me about life as a doctor. I was uninterested, but found myself intrigued. He was so...universe help me...cute when he was excited.
We had been dating for a few months now. We still are in our shy phase. I doubt we’ll get out of it any time soon. I am okay with that, however. I love watching the color spread across his face. I loved the way his pulse spiked when we touched.
I sat there, in his lap. I was shocked. “You did this on purpose!” I accused him.
I looked at the blank document before me. It was late. The night before the wedding, but this had to be perfect. Everything had to be perfect. The dresses, the venue, the photographer, the guest list, and this, my best man’s speech. Why was this so hard?
He groaned. “How am I supposed to enjoy seeing you like this when as soon as they come in you’re going to jump up?”
“Awwe did I make you mad?” he teased.
“Does Mycroft know?”
“I’m gay, Molly.”
“Why in bloody hell would I use a plate that I will have to wash when the container works perfectly well?” I asked, walking to where he was standing. I could smell his cologne. It was freshly applied. He doesn’t have a car. It’s probably in the satchel, but he doesn't normally keep a bag. He finds them to be a pain. Odd.
We shrugged and brought it in. “I didn’t think he liked gift-giving?” John said, pouring two cups of coffee. I pushed aside the case flies, careful not to mess up my work.
She came and stood in front of me. She gave me a quizzical look. “You’re not the only person who can tell when something is wrong. Now, what’s on your mind?” she said, setting down the clipboard she had been using.
P.s. You have done miracles before. Just one more please. Don’t be dead. I don’t care how. Just don’t be dead.”
“Okay,” I said, patiently waiting for her to tell me this person’s business. I loved this. I think this is technically gossiping, but still.
“You’re kidding,” John responded.
Me: Yes. We r ok now
“Gross,” I said, as we walked to go find a ring.
Love. It’s funny that I will let myself think of that now. I have loved Sherlock for a while. I didn’t really understand it. I have loved before, but I have never fell that hard, that fast before. In all honesty, it scared me. Sherlock had to have known. It was torture. I would date girl after girl to try and forget. After all, he was married to his work.
But John has already moved into my mind palace. The walls are covered in framed photos of memories I never want to forget. It was a slow progression that I didn’t understand. It was all consuming. The best way to describe the feeling is that it is like a fire. It slowly grew and if I didn’t keep it under control, it would burn me alive. Leave me in unbearable pain and scars that would never fade,
“I am a doctor too, Sherlock,” I reminded him.
I tried not to blush, but I thought about it and answered honestly. “It wasn’t just one event. It was more of an accumulation of things. I can’t pinpoint when, but it was a while ago,” I said, taking a drink to avoid his gaze. Are first dates always this awkward? I didn’t think they were?
“I’m a man of habit, and don’t worry about your ignorance of dancing,” he said, moving suddenly. He was suddenly in front of me. He took one of my hands in his and wrapped the other arm around my waist and brought me close to him.
I hoped I was saying it right. The way people looked at me had me beginning to guess. Why are they looking at me like that? I got to the end.
“You’re joking?” he said laughing for real as we walked.
“Are you having second thoughts?” Sherlock said, I guess deducing my thoughts, or maybe he was just voicing his own anxieties. I sighed and ran a hand through my hair. “Yes, but not because I’m second guessing how I feel about you,” I said. No more secrets, no more lies. “If this is too much-” Sherlock started.
I sighed. I was forgiven. I felt a little better now that Molly knew the secret I hadn’t realized I had been keeping. I wasn’t sure why it was a secret either. I wasn’t ashamed. Maybe I was just uninterested to the point that I didn’t realize it until later on? Who can really tell?
He rose up, and looked confused at my face. I smiled, and I couldn’t help it. He was just so cute that I laughed a little. He looked absolutely mortified. “What?” he said defensively. “What is so funny?” he demanded. I realized he was getting really upset.
“Hello,” I said in response.
I started to feel a little better. “Okay last one,” she decided, subsiding her little laughter.
Nothing much has changed. The difference is that when I look at John and want to tell him he’s beautiful, I do it. When he reaches out to hold something at night, I’m there. When I compose music, I tell him he’s who it’s for. When he writes me letters, he knows I keep them. He knows they are my treasure. He knows I love him, and I get to know how much he’s always loved me.
I leaned against the counter. “Miss Rosie?” I asked.
“Nothing is funny. You’re just so cute,” I said, grabbing his hand. I loved seeing him all bashful and blushy. “Was it bad?” he asked.
Please John taking the fucking hint.
“What do you mean?” John asked, confused tears fell down his cheeks.
“Cake? You want cake?” I asked, lifting her off the ground. “You don’t get cake!” I teased.
If she hadn’t made my brain short circuit, I would have easily figured that was not her intention. Molly is an intelligent woman that I have worked with for a while. I should have expected her to catch at least a few of my tricks.
“I was uhh, meaning to apologize. I made you feel like I was avoiding you, and you didn’t deserve that,” he said. I watched as his ears went red.
“Does-?”
“He won’t shoot John. Just-” I was struck in the face hard enough to knock me to the ground.
“No!” he snapped, louder.
“I wasn’t; she had plans,” I said. I felt a vibration in my pocket. I looked and gave a sigh.
“So, you’re gay?” he asked.
He smiled wickedly. “And apparently you like ass,” he said, as I gently elbowed him. “You can’t use that response every time,” I said.
“Well how about we get your mind off John? Maybe all you need to do to fix what’s going on is step back a little?” she suggested.
Rosie helped cut the cake, but we weren’t allowed to cut unless it was the perfect angle. She would not have it otherwise. She danced on my toes, then John’s. She drank every sugary beverage she could get a hold of. She ate anything sweet. Needless to say, she had a great time.
“Yes,” I stated, feeling quite pleased. I wasn’t quite sure why, however. I was constantly making these deductions.
“When did you find out that I-”
“Don’t do that,” I warned. I narrowed my eyes to let him know I meant what I said.
I hoped my gaze bored holes into him.
I gawked at him as he laughed. “Sorry, sorry I had to. The look on your face!” he laughed.
“No,” I said. “I told her that there is nothing wrong with her. I just don’t like women.”
“Well, how do I put this? You’ve been acting like a lost puppy,” she said. “Not only that, your head seems to be elsewhere. You haven’t bothered Lestraude about a case. You clearly are not sleeping,” she went on and on. “You’re snippy and in a bad mood most of the time. Is this all because of John possibly being upset with you?” she asked me.
When I finished, it was five pages long and I realized it was dark out. Rain fell hard outside. I checked my phone. It wasn’t too late. It was only 8:30. I was debating food when I got a text.
He was so excited, and I have drank before. Not very often anymore. John can’t handle all of that commotion all the time. Mrs. Hudson wasn’t the biggest fan of it either.
I didn’t respond. I needed a few more moments to prepare. I didn’t want John to think anything was up. I wanted him to act naturally. It was the only way to get definite results.
He started to avoid me like I avoid the grocery store. He seemed anxious and hyper aware almost all the time. Then he would be normal. I would think, “Thank the universe that’s over,” but then he would get jumpy and make an excuse to be as far away from me as possible.
“How long have you known?” I asked.
“The girl who was proposed to!” he said.
“Oh? Why’s that?” he said, the slightest shake in his voice.
I had a feeling everyone would hear about this, but I didn’t care. All I cared about was the smaller, beautiful man on top of me. I took in his smell as I heard him giggle. “Looks like we won’t have to tell anybody,” he snickered. He looked at me. He was so cute. I kissed his forehead. “I’m going to go back to sleep,” I said.
“Usual place?” he asked.
“Oh,” I said, smirking. I raised one of my eyebrows and forced my body to relax. “And what do you think, Doctor?” I said, putting emphasis on the word, doctor.  That must have made him mad. His face went red and he scowled at me.
“John. I-” I didn’t have the words. This plan was a disaster. How do I explain something like how I feel to him? I hardly understand myself. “I feel for you,” doesn’t sound like it’s enough. I took his hand and placed it on my own, quickly beating my heart. It was like a drum in my ears as I held John's hand to my chest.
“You’re right. I don’t, and you know I hate not understanding things. I won’t understand unless you tell me,” I said, leaning towards him ever so slightly. He wouldn’t meet my eyes. “Sherlock, can’t you just live with my being sorry? I can’t explain. You wouldn’t like it. You find feelings disgusting don’t you? Human error? Why would I make you deal with something you find so disgusting?” he said. It felt like a punch to the gut.
So despite my nervous energy, I sat still and talked to Mrs. Hudson. She told me the latest gossip from her favorite store and her book club. I wasn't particularly interested, but it got my mind off of everything. For a while, that is. “So where will you boys be going?” she asked.
I did remember remarking how he shouldn’t knock dating until he tried it because he made fun of most of the people there.
He made a soft gasp, needing air. He looked beautiful. His hair was a mess, but that was my fault. The first few buttons of his shirt were undone. He walked to the living room, and I followed. “Would you mind if we sat while kissing? I am in all honesty, weak in the legs at the moment,” he said.
“I am willing to trade,” I said. “I’ll give you this one I wrote, if you give me the one you wrote. No burning. I must warn you, there is no poetry in mine.”
“He did? Are you lying?”
I realized I just allowed myself to admit that I loved him as he jumped on the back of the larger man. He let me go, only to ram John on his back into the wall. I caught my breath best I could and charged the man with the gun as John fought the bigger man.
“Can I please finish a sentence?” she demanded.
“Bye bye” Molly said in an exaggerated high pitch voice.
“You wouldn’t dare,” I said.
“No, it’s ruining my dinner,” I said, but I doubted he was listening. I watched as lovers made the faces that read, “When will that be us?” It was disgusting. It was pathetic, but even I had flashes of wedding bells. Not for me of course, why would I ever imagine that?
“If you know then why put me through this? I know you don’t feel this sort of thing, so why did you do this?” His body shook. “I try to get over you. I do everything in my power, but then you give me little glimmers of hope. Then after that you dash my hopes and break my heart again and again. Do you find this funny? Am I just a joke?” he yelled. I stayed, unable to speak.
“Why are you so against marriage?” he cried.
You would have thought I offered the man sex. He was way too excited for a nap. I felt like he practically dragged me to get in a comfortable position on the couch. He used me for a pillow.
“Is that a challenge?” I accused. I leaned closer to his side of the table.
I wanted to be happy. They deserved that. It’s hard to be happy when at the end of it all, I’m the one who was left behind. Mary was with her date. Lestrade was god knows where. Janine is off with whatever man I told her was bad news. She never listens.
He stepped out the doors with two bottles in bags. Strong winds whipped his scarf and coat around. The cold paled his skin a little in some places and made it turn pink in others.
I couldn’t help myself. I had to ask. “Were you?” I asked.
“Not that I don’t love that you did this, but we are not the kind for this. Not yet at least. Let's go somewhere else?” I suggested.
They always figured it out, They would feel used, and betrayed. I can’t say that I blamed them, but Mary was just a friend. I told her all about my feelings for him. She knew it all. I thought we were like brother and sister. Then she tried to kill him.
“Not like this. Much more civil, a lot less blunt, but you deserve an explanation. I decided that this was one of the best I could give. There is nothing wrong with you. You are amazing in every sense, but I just can’t. I do love you. I know this probably doesn’t help, but I don’t know what else to do. You don’t have to forgive me. I just wanted you to know.”
“So?”
He looked at me annoyed. “No. I just showed you a ring box to be mean. Yes. Yes you beautiful idiot.”
“You got married. You loved her,” I said.
“Oh? Sherlock, what would you know about that?” he asked, eyes boring into me. I wasn’t even drunk, and here I am, saying too much. He leaned in, trapping me with his eyes. He was studying me. Is this how my clients felt? I felt like he was trying to stare into my soul.
We talked about other things and we drank, not enough to get drunk. Just enough to enjoy this moment of calm. It was rare that I got moments like these. My brain rarely allowed it. The wine stained John’s lips a deep red color. I watched, enchanted by the way they moved while he talked.
I was so happy for them that I went home alone.
“Are you ever curious about the feeling?” he asked. “The ones that would make you do the stupid things? Don’t you ever wonder what they are like?” he asked, making eye contact. My stomach started to ache very slightly. It was a nauseating feeling. My chest felt like it was going to explode. My heart hammered as my chest got tighter and tighter. I blushed despite myself. I didn’t mean to. I didn’t know why I was.
“Perhaps I could suck it up and ask her to talk over coffee?” I said.
He didn’t. He’s moved on. Still, the memory of teaching him to dance made my heart skip. We were so close. The music. I could feel his heartbeat. Surely he had felt mine. It was so loud in my ears. Thinking about it made my cheeks glow with warmth again. I hated it. I hate this. It’s my fault though. Now I had to deal with it.
I really hoped he didn’t remember that part.
“Why-why didn’t you say anything?” he demanded, turning towards me.
I could see something in his eye that I didn’t recognize. I decided that perhaps I should keep my true thoughts to myself. “Well how else am I supposed to view something that makes no sense?” I asked. This left room for him to believe that I could change my perception. He can’t change my mind, but it makes him happy to think that he can.
I could have died. I did, I’m sure. She looked at me. Did she think I felt for her that way? No. She knew that I didn’t. She just had me diagnose myself. She tricked me. Successfully. How did I let this happen?
“That is the basic idea.” I said.
“I loved it. I love you. I love you so much.”
We didn’t break eye contact. “Why is it so hot in here?” I asked, removing my coat. He looked at me, and he laughed. “Damn Sherlock. I didn’t mean to fluster you so much. I was just asking a question,” John laughed at my discomfort. Bastard. My insides seemed to turn to mush. That made no sense.
Right now all I can think about is how much I miss John. I just want to be around him. Like old times. Like when I would lean over his shoulder to see what he’s writing for him to shut his lap top. It would be as nice as that time I teased him when he accidentally called me “Love”. It would be like our rainy days, huddled up here in our flat, staying as far as possible from each other, but I would have never felt so close.
“What?” I asked.
“What is it?” John asked.
“Okay. This person is experiencing symptoms that they are unused to. Their symptoms are sweaty hands, constant redness in the cheeks, a seemingly permanent daze, high heart rate, jelly limbs, dilated pupils, a constant fear of stinking, obsessiveness, clinginess, and shortness of breath,” she was almost giggling. I rolled my eyes.
“I am the most observant man in the world, John. I do have a few theories,” I confessed. I took his wrist gently in my hand. “Your pulse is going abnormally fast.” I said.
“Well why don’t we change the subject?” he said.
I went without a word to the kitchen and put tea on. I remembered his hurt leg and my head, so I made an ice pack with frozen peas and such. After the tea was done I carried it in there, grabbed a bottle of over the counter pain medicine. I balanced my frozen peas on my head and tucked John’s under my arm. I decided to put his doubts at ease with an act of care.
“Yes.”
“Very sure.”
I didn’t love her? Is that what she thinks? I do love Molly. Just not romantically. “Molly! Wait!” I called after her. I ran after her. She was a few feet in front of me. There was an unusual lack of people on the streets today. Maybe it was because lightning and thunder promised that a storm was coming in.
I decided to take a chance. “Dinner?” I asked him.
“Sherlock,” John said. He was playing with his food, avoiding eye contact.
He swallowed and took the cup back from me. “Thank you,” he said, barely above a whisper. “I’m sorry for suspecting you.”
“And what was that?” he asked.
“Were you listening to me?” he asked.
“Hello,” I said. “Can we talk?” I asked suddenly.
I couldn’t help myself. Pride is funny that way. “Thank you,” I said.
I woke up John. Turns out he can be just as shy as I am. He turned beet red as they lightly teased us. We played cards with Mrs. Hudson. Had some wine. Played with Rosie some. She preferred blocks alone to play along with her stuffed animals.
I didn’t mention that I didn’t feel like being embarrassed by my inability to dance. Maybe another time. If there is another time, I thought. Nope. No, don’t do this today. Today will be perfect so help me God.
I could have gagged myself as she started to cry, like she hadn’t already known about this for weeks, months perhaps.
John was quiet for a moment. “Aren’t you even a little curious?” he asked. I looked at him. He had taken a similar position on his chair opposite from me.
I was just so, so happy for them.
Molly looked up. “I better go Sherlock,” she said. “I’ll talk to you later,” she said.
“Everything. You have too much locked away. Your love language seems to be extreme acts that you see as helpful. I mean, almost killing yourself with drugs? Faking your death? Sherlock, wouldn’t you rather he just know? What next? What is the limit?” she asked gently, but stern.
“So you already know, then?” he asked, fear in his face was clear. Poor boy.
“Who?” I asked.
His breath caught. I let him have this snippet of truth in hopes he will give me some of his own. Fair trade, afterall. “Sherlock. You don’t understand,” he said.
He rolled his eyes. “Sherlock, can’t you see even a little value in it?” he asked.
She nodded and listened to my story. “May I ask you something?” she said, abruptly. I nodded.
“Shut up!” he yelled, facing away from me. He wouldn’t meet eyes. Tears spilled down his cheeks. Fuck. This wasn’t what I was trying to do! SHITFUCKDAMNITFUCKFUCKFUCK!
“I pronounce you husband and husband. You may now kiss,” she said, stepping out of the way.
“Does her death bother you?” he asked, with cool caution. He didn’t make eye contact. “I would understand if it did,” he continued. “Stop.” I told him.
I found something he could kind of fit, and we crawled into my bed. “I heard that, uhh, couples often enjoy each other’s warmth when in bed together. Is that something you would want to try?” Sherlock asked, that cocky attitude gone. I smiled. “Ofcourse, get up here,” I said, patting the spot on my bed that would be dedicated to him.
“I know.”
“What?” he asked.
“Sherlock. I need you to answer me honestly. Do you have feelings for John?” she asked, reaching across the table to place what I guessed was a friendly hand on mine, giving a reassuring squeeze.
He gave me an innocent look. “What do you mean John?” he said, bringing his face to mine. “You got worked up all on your own.” I got off of him quickly. “You are-” I started, but he cut me off.
He looked up at me with his strikingly beautiful eyes. Neither of us could break eye contact. I saw him move his glass to the side a little. “So that’s it?” John asked, fidgeting a little. “I’m forgiven?”
I pulled him close for a kiss. Rosie threw her flower petals around. I kissed him. We closed the gap between us. His hands were on my hips. My hands caressed his face. Rosie tugged at my coat.
“Good night,” he said, leaving me in the living room alone.
“Please,” he said, sitting on the arm of the couch. I went to make us both a cup, shaking. Damn tea. It was just a kiss, so damn, why was the world so against me getting one?
“Sherlock,” he warned.
My stomach dropped as I remembered the letters. I never put them up. “John-” He found the one he left at my grave.
“I wrote you a five page love letter?”
“You’re-”
“What?” he said, allowing himself to be pulled.
“Sherlock, when saying ‘It isn’t you, it’s me,’ is almost an insult, you do know that? Look, you just went through something traumatic and-”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Love letters seemed to be our specialty.
I looked in the mirror. I decided not to think of her now. I wasn’t going to think of my time away. I am definitely not going to think of Mycroft and his warnings. Tonight I am going to wear a suit. I am going to the place Sherlock made a reservation at. I am going to enjoy this date. And hopefully get a second one.
“You’ve never seen yourself blush,” John said.
“I do not,” I lied.
“Nope. She’s not a big girl. Only big girls get cake,” he said, taking her from my arms.
“No,” I said.
“What?” I asked him. “Why are we stopping here?” I asked.
Now I’ll never know.
“Look,” he said, handing me the paper. I looked at him, but I took it.
Or maybe he’d be pulling me gently to a bed we shared? Maybe we’d already be there and I would finally know why people like to cuddle?
“Am I forgiven?” I asked.
JW: R u home?
“I had to make sure,” John raised his hands in defense. “I do have another question,” he said, blushing deeply.
“He’s afraid,” I said to my good and only friend, Dr. John Watson.
“Wait, really?” I asked.
“Could you let me-”
“Yes, but I am not that blunt and you know it,” he said.
“I can see and feel those things,” I reminded him.
“Why don’t you start from the wedding? Would that make it easier?” she suggested.
“Hm?” I said.
He looked up and smiled at me. “I found her bee.”
I got her a bumble bee plushy when I was out of town on a case. She had grown to not want to sleep without it. “Where?”
“So know this. Today, you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you saved. In short, the two people who love you most in this world. And I know that I speak for Mary as well when I say we will never let you down, and we have a lifetime to prove that.”
“No, I was incredibly pushy.”
“Well how else was I supposed to know what’s bloody wrong with you?” I demanded.
“I’ve had it for a while,” I confessed.
Why can’t I stop myself?
“Yes,” I said. “Letters, It’s stipid I know. She said that I have too many bottled up emotions. She suggested letters.”
I cannot express the joy I felt. It was a poem John wrote to me while I was gone.
“He should make a quick recovery,” John said, startling Sherlock. He turned to see John and Mary arm in arm. I was so happy for them. They truly deserved this. Happiness. Normalcy.
“Now?” she asked, taking Rosie from me. “We’ve nothing to talk about Sherlock.”
“I suppose that is what we are doing,” he said, finding where he felt comfortable placing his hands. He picked my back and my hair. He lightly played with it as we went in for another kiss. This one was much better than the first two. More natural, and less scared. His hands explored. My back, my legs, my hair, my waist. They were excited, but careful. Intent, but gentle. I felt the muscles from under his shirt.
He looked at me. “Don’t you have anything to say?” he demanded.
“May I kiss you? On the mouth preferably this time?”
“I’ll see you later,” John said, starting to walk out.
“I’m sorry you were too,” I said. He gave me an annoyed look. I just smiled back.
“You can’t do the actual killing. You don’t have the nerve,” I said, slowly turning to meet him.
“I don’t know?” I demanded.
There was a light knock at my door an eternity later. John was at my door. He looked sheepish.
“That look. Don’t do that,” I said.
I looked at her. Did she think I was stupid? “You are very clearly not over it. Please, at the very least you deserve an apology. You deserve so much more, but I am sorry to say, an apology is all I can give you,” I said, walking towards her.
“Not the way I love you,” she said.
“Okay.” I picked him up in a bridal style. I carried him up the stairs and into his room. We stayed there all day. Basking in each other’s love. I know, gross right?
I sighed and looked at my closet. It was well past one in the morning. Mrs. Hudson was asleep now surly, not that she’d ever come up to my room anyways.
“I want you to tell me what these people that I am describing. These are real people, so I can’t tell you who they are. You understand, for their privacy.”
“Yes.”
He gave a small huff of a laugh. “Understood. So what did you say to Molly?” he asked.
“Only you. Others only speculate I’m sure,” I said.
He came close and held me by my hips. “Don’t tempt me.”
He kissed me. I was utterly confused.
I hated the silence. He clearly had a question on his mind, but he was too afraid to ask.
“Sherlock. You have to understand. You have never told her no, and that gives her hope that maybe that you may feel the same,” he tried to defend her.
I decided to test it out. I sat in the kitchen all night, looking through cases I wasn’t planning on taking, but I need an excuse to be up so late. I also could use the money in all honesty.
“I saw you put it on my grave. I’ve had it ever since. I had the others at one point, but Mycroft took them from where I hid them. This is the only one I have left.”
“I’m not stopping you.”
He went in and I stayed outside. I recited over and over, “Just a game. Just a game. It’s just a game.”
“Obviously, that is what you are paid for,” I said. I was still feeling the lingering effects of embarrassment from oversharing. That made me a little…snippy.
“Yes, I do.”
“We were just arguing,” he tried to defend himself.
“Sherlock, please. Let it go. I’m over it,” she said, her voice rising in pitch.
I wanted to ask him if he was avoiding me. I wanted to get out in the open, fix the problem, end this. I couldn’t seem to form the words. I wanted to so badly, but all I could do was look at his lips and imagine what they would feel like against mine. Not that I care.
But then why was my body freaking out? I was hot and cold. My heart hammered like a bass drum. He was so close. He looked so what girls would call cute. That face was so tired, but so kind. I never understood why his heart was so big. How can he have gone through so much and seen so much, and still have regard for anybody. I sure as hell didn’t.
“I mean that I am feeling things that I don’t understand or have words for!” I snapped.
There was a long silence. Then John said, “But I thought you and Irean-”
Mary was a friend. She was fun to be around. I wanted to hate her like the other women that John was with, but how could I? She was so sweet, and she was kind. She was empathetic. So empathetic. I remember the apology she sent me. It was with the other cd. One that was to be burned after I listened to it. It was for me, and for me to only hear it once.
Should I tell him? Is this a big deal? Should I be panicking? I looked him over. He was my best friend. He confessed to being in love with me on paper, so if he tries anything I have proof. I knew that made me a bad person, but you’ve always got to have a safety net.
“So where are we going Doctor?” he asked.
I looked up at the ceiling and drifted. “Is he avoiding me?” I asked myself.
“Don’t move,” he said. “I don’t want to kill you, but I will.”
John stood there with the spoon he reached past me to get. He was shocked. “Christ Sherlock are you okay?” he asked.
“Why would he be?” I said in response.
“Gay, yes.”
She looked like she could have slapped me, and she did.
“You are an ass,” I said.
We have been dating for three months now. We have a new normal. It was much like the old normal. We still solved cases. I now live at 221b Baker St. Sherlock is still an asshole. I am still as I was, but now we’re together. No secrets, no shame. At least I assume no shame because Sherlock will randomly grab my ass whenever he feels like it. Not that it wasn’t welcome, but still. The man seems to have no shame.
“Starving,” he said.
I nodded, and I went into the kitchen to get the plastic container of soup. I was being very careful, seeing that it was hot. I was carefully removing the lid, but it was difficult. I was trying to not get burned. I was a little too focused on the task at hand so when John entered the kitchen I didn’t notice. I didn’t hear him behind me.
So I asked the only person whose professional opinion I can trust. Me.
“That you had feelings of ‘The romantic sort,’ for me,” he smiled wickedly.
“I remember this place!” I exclaimed suddenly.
We paid and began our commute home. On the way home, he stopped.
“Okay.”
I put on my coat, and I walked outside.
“No! No! I never said that!” I said, panic setting in.
“Quiet!” I snapped.
“Yes,” he said, sitting on the opposite side of the bed from me. “Also you’re wrong Sherlock, your poetry is so beautiful,” he said.
“What?” I asked.
“Where are you going?” she asked.
He smiled that easy smile. I would almost take it as flirting. No. He wouldn’t flirt with me. He gave me all the signs, but no, he would never flirt with me.
“Know what?” I asked, as a server in a suit poured me a decent amount into my glass. “Thank you,” I said to the server, and waited for Sherlock’s response.
“No, but how can I say no to someone so adorable?” he said.
He looked at me for a moment. One second. Two. Three. He blinked and checked his watch. “Damn, it’s late. We have to be up tomorrow,” he said, standing. He smiled and walked to the kitchen.
I spit it out. “Hot,” I said with a scalded tongue. John laughed hard at my pain. I gave him an evil eye. He tried to stop, but was struggling. “Not funny,” I said.
“You don’t love me. You can’t help that,” she said. “You can’t make yourself feel something you don’t,” she said.
“I hope she says no,” I only slightly joked. John stared at them, he wore a large smile. He was pulled in as everyone in the restaurant by the young couple’s sector.
“Fine, just cold,” I said, standing close to the heater. It warmed me up nicely.
Best wishes,
“You didn’t have to,” he said, walking into the hallway.
It took my being away to realize just how much my life would suck without Sherlock Holmes. He was insufferable. He’s a know-it-all, and he is a jackass. He knows how to push all your buttons to get what he wants. He has little to no regard for others, but he is also generous, sweet, and smart. He is always confused and loves attention.
“Hmm? Oh! To my flat?” I offered.
“No?” I said. “How would I ask him that and expect an honest answer?”
“Don’t thank me, I had my own reasons, so you plan to work at the hospital?” I asked him.
“But I’ll forgive you because you’re an idiot,” I tried my hand at conscious flirting. I didn’t like it.
“How long?” he asked.
“I wasn’t mad,” she said, walking away.
“I uhh. John.” I closed my eyes. This was so much harder than I thought.
“No. I don’t want to hear it,” he said, snatching his arm free. “I can’t believe you did this, but at the same time, it’s not surprising. You could never understand. This is a game to you. Molly and I are just a game?” he asked,
He breathed in deeply. “Can we go to a bed? The couch isn’t very comfortable,” he said. I smirked.
“Well this entire situation is rather embarrassing now,” John sighed, relaxing into the couch. “I can’t believe how stupid we’ve been,” I said.
It was quiet and boring without John around. It was so quiet. I almost called him, but he probably didn’t really want to be with people right now. The flat was so cold. It was so quiet right now. I hate the quiet. It lets me think.
“Molly.”
“Are you just saying that because of the position you’ve found yourself in?” I teased.
“Fine!” he spat. “You’re the genius, you figure it out.” John looked terrified. I could see the instant regret in his eyes as I smiled.
It was my turn. Damn it. I stood up. I felt like I was shaking. Was I shaking? I didn’t know. I could hardly hear myself speak over the sound of my heart in my ears. I gave my speech and avoided the eyes of my audience. I looked out into the eyes of all the people in front of us instead. John and Mary were my audience. No one else mattered here. Not today. Not even me.
“Have fun boys!” she called, as Sherlock and I walked out the door. I hailed a cab. He and I got into the back of the cab. We were quiet, neither of us saying a word. I am fairly sure that I stopped breathing at one point. It was so stupid. I have been closer than this to him before, so why was it so different now?
“John is still avoiding me, and I don’t know why,” I confessed.
“Care to sit?” I ask, looking up at him. “If you aren’t too late for whatever has you up at this time?”
“Molly!” I yelled. She stopped and turned to me. Her makeup made black rivers from her eyes. My heart broke for her.
Me: U need a break. Molly was happy
“I was surprised to see that Mrs. Hudson isn’t here?” John said.
She sighed and looked away. “I think I always knew, but was letting myself stay in the dark,” she said. “I didn’t let myself believe it until I stepped back and looked at everything, and I think you should do the same. After you blew me off the other day, I decided to ask myself why. I know this sounds desperate, but forgetting I knew who you are and looking at you through the eyes of a stranger helped me realize…” she looked away.
Tonight was going to be perfect, so help me God. Even if it is just one night, I could live with one perfect night. That was all I was going to think about tonight. I hung up the phone, and looked at my closet. Now which suit should I wear?
“Are you sure?” he asked. He looked a little self conscious. I offered my hand to him.
I laughed at him. Intentionally loud so he will know just how ridiculous he sounded. “Oh, is this my diagnosis doctor?” He glared at me.
I looked at John and Mary. I was at the table with them and Mary’s maid of honor. People said some words. They were poorly written and had no drama, but John and Mary seemed to enjoy themselves. Maybe I should just toss out the speech I have and wing it?
“He’s going to go kill his family if we don’t stop him,” I said, getting up and pulling him with me.
“But isn’t that place a little under ten minutes away?”
“Not you, if that was your concern,” I lied. I was a little snippier than I had meant to be, but these questions seemed to be going somewhere I didn’t want to go.
You could have heard a pin drop. I looked at him, wide eyed. He snapped his eyes up to me. “Well? Aren’t you going to say anything?” he said. He looked angry, but I knew better. “How can you look me in the eye and say that you find emotion disgusting then ask me what’s wrong?”
“It’s fine, really.”
“I want to play Who am I,” he said.
I set down the letters. I kissed him. I had to. I had no words to explain what I felt after hearing this. I just had to have him close.
“John. You idiot,” I said as the man John had pinned got up and rolled his shoulders.
“Okay, I will.” I stared him directly in the eyes, getting uncomfortably close to his face. I watched with excitement as the blush started in his cheeks and spread to the rest of him.
All in all, a great evening at 221B Baker Street.
“Okay,” John said, looking at me. His eyes looked me up and down. I knew I looked bad, but I didn't think I looked that bad.
“Maxine, you are the most i-important person in my life,” the man proclaimed as his voice shook. The paleness was quickly replaced by a scarlet blush.
He laughed a little. “I feel like shit,” he said.
He looked me in my eyes. He sighed, and extended the letter to me. I handed him the one I wrote. I was so happy to have my treasure back, but then reality hit. I was sure my face was crimson. He held my confession. It was five pages long, and I can’t remember exactly what I wrote. I was beyond embarrassed. I had to literally go do anything. I couldn’t stand there and watch.
“Yes exactly! It isn’t you though Molly. It has nothing to do with you at all,” I said.
I don’t know why I care. It doesn’t make sense. None at all. I should consider myself lucky to have anyone that I have known for this long and that has gone through this much with to still be able to look at me at all. After all I put him through, I am lucky that he doesn’t hate me.
Good. I’m not sure I’d be willing to answer it. I played with my rice.
“But I do love you Molly! That’s what you don’t seem to understand. You are one of the most important people in my life. I love you so, so much, but…”
“You need to have a talk with John too,” she said.
I looked up at her. I was forming the “Yes,” but my words got caught in my throat. Were we ready? “I don’t know,” I admitted. “John?” I heard Sherlock call from upstairs. “You’re here? What time is it?” he asked. He looked down to where me and Mrs. Hudson sat. “Oh I’m late! Give me ten minutes and I’ll be down!” he called.
“Yes, why don’t we go somewhere else?” He smiled, blushing lightly. I loved it when he did that. “Okay, if that is what you want?” he said.
John ran to my rescue instead of getting the gun away from the smaller man. I love him, but he can be stupid.
“Hi,” he said.
“If you don’t stop I’ll return you,” I joked.
He looked up at me, and our eyes locked. Neither of us said anything. He opened and closed his mouth. He wanted to say something but couldn’t? If that makes sense, which it doesn’t.
“Yes,” I said. “Maybe it’d just be best to rip off the band aid all at once?”
“Well, nothing as exciting as murder, but a case?” Molly said.
I pulled out the contents. A red note card fell out from the mass of notebook paper.
“Don’t be. I made this decision on my own. Isn’t that right, Rosie?” I said. She whined in response.
I looked at him. “Are you serious?” I asked.
“I don’t blush that often!” I tried to defend myself, but it was a hard defense to make when I was blushing already.
