“Thank you, I gladly accept but can I call my aunt? Don’t want her to freak out” said Peter scratching his head awkwardly.
Doom’s Castle Latvria
“So you’re still you” laughed Peter
“It’s nice and everything, but how are we going to save my dear Anthony?” boomed Thor standing up
“Thinking about your love one, i’m guessing,” laughed Bucky
Thanos was back with a bag from the earth shop. His little one would be pleased. The chitauri were looking at him weirdly, yes he never did this for anyone but, his gem deserved everything, the control will be more easy.
Peter nodded at the condition before giving one last regard to Tony and followed Doom inside the castle. He came to the conclusion that his best chance, to stay with Tony, was to listen to Doom and stayed inside this castle to protect him. They walked for a very short time before entering a corridor.
Thanks for the kudos and comments
“What a mistake” replied Tony
“I’m Groot?” asked Groot at Rocket
“Wait, before asking why Magneto is here?” asked Bruce really confuse
“Hey Punk i was looking for you” smiled Bucky sitting next to him
“Yes I will, I will redeem myself,” said Wanda standing up “ Please tell me when Tony is awake and I will ask him to forgive me”
“So stopping what?” asked Clint one more time
“Anthony is very strong and a mighty warrior, fear not Peter, he will wake up again” boomed Thor with a smile stilling holding Tony’s hand.
Done for now thanks for the kudos and comments
Thor was in the common room chatting with Rocket and Bruce when Gamora and Okoye entered inside the room. They waved at them before talking about the upgrade of the spaceship. Thor really wanted to save Tony, the man of iron didn’t deserve this.
Bucky smirked even more, he knew his best friend and that was pure jealousy. Steve was too easy to read and specially when he was in love. And he was totally in love with Tony. Bucky came closer to Steve, before punching his arm
“Ok please don’t die on me” said Carol gathering his energy.
Bruce and Thor laughed at him. That was nice to see someone in Team stark like themself. Tony deserve redemption even if he did some bad things, he was only human and that was the human nature.
“Yes and thank you again for your very kind hospitality” smiled Peter
Gamora was sitting on the floor, drinking some water, the training session was awesome. Okoye was next to her, drinking water as well. They had a good dynamic, Okoye was smart and strong so that was just perfect.
“Charles, what did I say about reading my thoughts” answered Erik fondly
“What kind of trouble?” asked Charles following Rhodey with Logan out of the room
Thanos smirked at that, well this was actually really fun. His stone was really funny and entertaining.
“How did you pass the security?” asked Okoye suddenly
“Guys we need to go, emergency meeting right now” entered Rhodey “Trouble are on the way”
“Not that was me, i did it, even brainwashed” said Bucky looking at the sky
Natasha was waiting in front of the castle, the person was late but that wasn’t surprising, Wakanda was highly secured. As for everyone here, the strange made an impression on her, he was really powerful.
“Well that settles it, please follow Okoye, she will show you your room” said the King pointing on of the Dora Milaje
Peter let go of the controller. He fall into his thoughts one more time. The stranger reminded him so much about Tony. That was really strange, he was sassy and sounded a bit like him. But well that was impossible, Tony was a prisoner from Thanos and Tony was only human. He missed Tony so much also so maybe that was it, he was seeing some signs everywhere.  With a little sigh, he took back the controller before smiling at Shuri. The princess smiled back and they played again.
“I will not mess up not because you need him but because i want to know him more,  and he is really interesting” replied Stephen “ So please Captain just leave.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes and he killed everyone except me.” whispered Eitri” And he took my hands”
“We were supposed to?” asked back Corvus Glaive
That was really not good, thought Tony immediately. The Titan must have something on his mind. He wanted to go inside his head just to see his thoughts but the mad titan would have know it. So he just followed, really worried.  They stopped in front of a room and Thanos just smiled at him before asking Tony to enter. Tony, still tense, entered inside a room. Which was really weird. They were a huge bed on the mild and some of comfy couches. That was a really cozy bedroom.
Steve snorts. "Like one of King Howard's assassins could get through our borders – through
"I was just –" Tony starts, but he can't finish the sentence.
"I've tried," Steve says sadly. He waves a hand over the contracts on the table between them. "This is the smartest way. The safest."
he's nervous. Tony had sent a note back with the kitchen staff saying he would, in fact, join Steve for dinner. Which is a good sign.
"Is that all you appreciate about me?" she asks, wicked smirk turned over her shoulder.
She rolls her eyes, then crosses her arms and meets his gaze. "Really?"
Tony barks a laugh, and Steve grins at him happily, like he feels like he's done something right. They wander down the rows of flowers while Tony points out their meanings.
"What do you mean?"
Steve wants to bite the same spot.
"It's not," Steve says. "I… was rough with you, I know. And then, before we could talk about it, before we could do anything else, before I could show you… anyway, I left. That wasn't fair. I wish I hadn't had to go. I'm sorry."
"We'll ask them why they're coming through our borders, try to find out if it's part of a larger attack plan."
But he's Steve Rogers, so backing down here isn't an option.
"Patience, love," Steve murmurs against his mouth, and Tony whines, tries to hitch his hips and get some friction on his cock. Steve is hard, too, Tony can feel his erection, the base thick and heavy, the length of it deliciously long.
"Sure thing," Clint says, giving Bucky a soft but meaningful look on his way out the door.
"Steve," Tony moans, water sloshing out the side of the tub as he thrusts his hips up, seeking friction again even as Steve rubs at his sensitive prostate.
"What do you mean, a virtue exam?" Steve asks through clenched teeth.
"Stay here," Steve tells him with another gentle squeeze to his hand. Steve slides out of the bed and moves over to the table with its spread of food. He fills a plate with a selection of items and pours them each a glass of wine. He rests the plate on his forearm and takes a glass in each hand, bringing them back over to the bedside table. He puts the glasses down first, then the plate, and crawls back into bed.
On the other hand, Tony had cancelled dinner with him days ago, and Steve hasn't seen him since that day in the garden.
of Starkland. Why doesn't he just give us the aid we need to protect his own borders? If the Chitauri get through here, they're going through to Starkland anyway. Why does he insist you take a Consort?"
He stares at them all. He's about to whine to Pepper about not being able to make a choice, when he sees it.
"Wow," Steve says, blinking. "That sounds amazing. And they have it everywhere?"
Tony makes a noise that sounds like a strangled laugh, but he clamps down on it right away, like he hasn't meant to let it out. "I'm in heat, and I'm slick," Tony gasps. "How much more ready can I get?"
Steve blinks at her. "But… you don't
Steve feels his blood run cold, and glances at Bucky, hoping it's a joke. The grim expression on Bucky's face tells him it isn't.
Tony stares at her again. Suppressants? Just like that? He hadn't had to speak to any councils about it or anything? No bureaucracy to deal with, a bunch of red tape that just wouldn't ever be cut through? Tony had been on suppressants because he'd been at the Academy, but he's never known of an Omega out in the world, in Starkland, who was on them. Bonded or not; if nothing else, it was a good way to get themselves bonded to someone.
Sam, again, doesn't wait for an answer. "So as far as Prince Anthony knows, you're some scary lord who's going to treat him the way he's been taught to expect – like his wants and needs are secondary, unimportant, and he's not much more than a body to warm your bed."
In fact, the crowd itself is quite small. He sees Wilson near the front, with a couple of other men. One has shaggy, dirty blonde hair, while the other has dark hair grown out to his shoulders, and only one arm. Ah. That must be Steve's friend, then, the Beta from before the war.
"Are you okay, honey?" Steve asks him.
Tony slides a hand down the inside of Steve's thigh, lets his thumb caress the tight, furled hole between his cheeks.
"And it's a very romantic gift, for someone dumb as you, congratulations," Bucky agreed patronizingly. "However, whatever it is you told him to build, he ignored you."
"I know. I'll just feel better if Nat's here. I trust her, and you can, too."
There's a dark-skinned man standing on the steps of to the palace, smiling warmly as Rhodey gets out of the coach. He turns to help Pepper out, and then loans a hand to Tony. As Tony steps out of the coach, Rhodey gives his hand a reassuring squeeze.
"It's not… the baths, exactly," Tony says, cringing. "It's more of a water issue."
"What?" Steve rounds on him. "What the hell is wrong with you? What the hell makes you think I give a damn about – about who he might have–"
," Bucky said, letting his head fall back in exasperation. He stared at the ceiling for a few beats. "You told him he didn't have to feel obligated, that he didn't have to sleep with you."
Of course. Now, as it's sinking in, Tony realizes he'd been incredibly stupid.
He feels an itch under his skin, a prickle of warmth. They're happening more and more frequently now as his heat draws closer. It will surely only be another day or two.
"When you're right, you're right," Tony says, pulling his shirt up over his head, shoving his pants down to his knees. He's not wearing elaborate lace undergarments this time; he's naked instantly, and Steve's hips judder in the empty air at the sight.
The coach comes to a stop in front of the main doors of the castle. The rest of the caravan had stopped further away, in the city proper, under the direction of two men who had waved them down. One would take the stores, and one would take the army.
Bucky glares at him, but before he can retort by telling Steve what a monumental idiot he is, the drawing room door opens and Clint walks in.
“No, I disguised myself because I wanted to see if the humans were worthy.” explained Tony “ I decided to keep my human look, it’s really great indeed”
“Yes and he will be safe here the same for you if you stay” proposed Doom
“ Well i don’t want to talk with you, like i said  i will never forgive you and yeah i don't want to know you”
“Shuri decide to improve the difficulty for the upcoming outcome with Thanos” answered Okoye smiling
“Of course she will” laughed quietly Peter
“Rogers” replied Stephen already bored
“Hey, Peter” smiled his aunt, happy to give his nephew a hug.
“Is he alive?” asked Tony scared for his point break
“Well I noticed that already” laughed Rhodey
“The pit between the avengers is very strong now.” said T’Challa “ I’m hoping that will not stop us from saving Stark”
Doom smiled at him before looking at Tony, yes he would protect him from threats. Thanos was one of them but an inside threat lurking in Wakanda, making people think it was a friend. Everyone was caught in its lies but Doom managed to save Tony from it before it killed him. And now Doom was going to destroy it.
“Latvria, where Doom lives, is protected by a UN decreet if a country dared attack it, they will face a war basically” answered Erik
“I will do it”
Ship of Thanos, somewhere in space
Gamora was training with Okoye and that wasn’t easy, she was really strong. So that was just perfect. With a swift move, she was on the floor, Okoye smirking at her.
“Can we see him?” asked Peter hopeful
Wanda was in front of a room and was hesitating before knocking at the door. It was a really bold move to do it but she didn’t have any choice, she needed answers and the best person to get them was the person inside of this room so she knocked and waited patiently.
“So what’s the update” whispered Tony at Stephen
“Yes but why do you want to help us? Do you want something in exchange?” asked Stephen frowning
Thank for the kudos and comments ^^
The dining room was just in front of the kitchen, so that wasn’t really complicated to find.it. Peter entered inside it and took place on the huge table in the middle of the room. The chairs were ridiculously big but that wasn’t surprising.
“Destination?” asked T’Challa at the guard again
“Good to see you too” smiled Clint back “ Hey Nat.”
“So i will do it” answered Thanos” I will prove my worth to him”
“I will because he is really strong, he just need to rest and to heal” smiled Strange patting Peter’s back.
“What do you want then?” asked Thanos gently again paradoxal for a murderer.
“I want some cheeseburgers and french fries from Burger King” answered Tony simply
“I’m fine and ready to kick some ass” laughed Clint again “Right Nat?”
Steve was in his room, thinking about Edward too. The guy was really powerful and he definitely could help them for rescuing Tony. Yes he could be friendly with Edward, persuade him to help them and Tony will thank him and they will be together definitely
“ So wizard, keep the stone and protect it. Same for you owner of the mind stone.” smiled Tony
Peter was already walking toward Thor, siding with them. Peter was furious, Tony didn’t deserve this. They were ready to fight if that was necessary. But Steve Bucky and Wanda came inside the room.
“Sure who do we need to stop?” asked Erik getting concerned
“My name is Carol Danvers” replied Carol “ And I’m here to help you with your Thanos problem”
“This is the bedroom area of Doom’s Castle, your room is here,” said Doom showing a door “ Tony will be move next to your room when he will be able to leave the tank”
“No i didn’t do it my lord” said the chitauri kneeling"
“His majesty T’Challa asked me to come since I’m very good with minds and he thought I could help Tony.” smiled Charles “But I guess, I’m no use if my patient is not here anymore”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes that was a pretty amazing” laughed Tony” And you then, how did you became the Sorcerer Supreme”
“I sense greatness in you and i respect that” said Thanos staying mysterious” Eat now, you must be really hungry”
“No thanks to Stark right?” laughed Clint again
“So my children, i need you to go to earth for retrieving the two final stones.” smiled Thanos
“Her name is Morgana La Fay, she is a witch from earth in the middle age.” smiled Loki dreamly” We will be Queen and King of Sakaar and we will be worshiped”
“I too love” answered Charles “ I really want to protect him but you know Tony, he will never ask because  he doesn’t want to be a burden”
“That wasn’t a bad comment, just curiosity” said Thanos with a calming tone
“Clever guy. You always asked the right question” smirked Tony “But to answer you, i’m willing to help because Thanos isn’t right, killing half of the universe not a good idea”
“Right now, Tony need the people who did not betray him or hurt him” concluded Rhodey letting the people he mentioned inside the room
Tony bowed respectfully at the King and winked at Stephen, before following Okoye. Stephen watched the stranger leave, well he was watching his bottom more, that butt was on point. A bit like Tony. After a moment T’Challa ended the meeting, leaving everyone at the occupation.
Tony looked at Thanos with pure horror, the titan was truly mad if he thought, Tony will accept this. Tony stepped back toward the hall, watching the mad titan furious.
“No one is here” answered Bucky
More people are here. Couldn't help myself and I had the X-Men to this story haha
“Yes, he never changed” added Rhodey with a sad smile
“Yes because Peter will keep us update, he promised” smiled May hugging Pepper.
“ He was trying to kill you!” objected Steve” What was i supposed to do? Let him kill you?”
“Charles Xavier, what are you doing here,?” asked Bruce curious
“Logan, you have to calm down, you are going to destroy every bots here” sighed Charles watching the carnage around.
“Care to explain?”asked Carol finally
Thanks for your nice comments and the kudos ^^ See you next time!!
“It’s not a problem, Doom would never separate Tony from his children,” said Doom dismissing the thanks.” Doom believed that Tony would wake sooner than Doom believed, the tank is very efficient.”
“I guess friend rhodey has a guardian angel” smiled Thor as well
“Yes, he is safe here, far from those traitors who could hurt him” replied Doom looking angry
Bucky was talking with Vision about everything, he was sorry for what happens and leaving Tony behind. Vision reassured him about everything and that Tony will probably not hold anything against him because that wasn’t him that was HYDRA, he was just a weapon.
This is getting a bit darker. Hope that will be fine with you.
“Doom invited you for a very concerned matter and it’s the security of our Tony,” said Doom gravely “ Someone is plotting a very dark schema against him and we need to stop it before it’s too late
“Let them come, Doom is ready to do anything to protect his Anthony” smirked Doom “ You can stay if you want, every child of Tony is welcome here”
“Of course sire” smiled Proxima sitting next to Corvus who was smiling as well. He always loved a very good massacre.
Everyone was projected against the wall and Doom twisted his hand and blocked them with the metal around him. Then he took Tony in his arms, removing every medical cable except for the breathing mask. And just like that Doom disappear in a black portal while carrying Tony bridal style.
“Oh i see, sound harsh for them” laughed Tonu quietly
“I missed you my love” sighed Rhodey after the kiss
Steve watched the exchange from afar, he was thinking, he was really happy for Tony to be back, far away from the mad titan, but inside a part of his mind, he was really pissed that he wasn’t the one who saved him or even carried him in his arms to the medic bay. He failed both of his important steps but now he was ready, he wanted to be the first that Tony saw when he will wake up. Stephen was watching the soldier with a concern look. He couldn’t read inside the minds like the witch but the facial expression of the soldier doesn’t look sincere.
“The bots are really strong, it’s nice” smiled Gamora happy
“Well i never asked for this set-up” laughed Stephen” Someone is playing The matchmaker”
“You are jealous, don’t lie to me Punk” smiled Bucky “ I know everything about you don’t forget that”
Stephen was meditating in his bedroom. Yesterday, he had feel a weird energy, similar to an infinity stone. Which was a bit weird, because it didn’t smelled like the time stone or the mind stone. Thanos had the power and the space stones so maybe that was the soul stone here on earth. Well he needed to investigate further. He stood up and leave the room, and went toward the throne room he needed to speak with T’challa.
“How long have you been created that suit because you couldn’t have done it overnight,” asked Peter smirking
“Quill glad to see you up” smiled Rocket” And welcome”
(See the end of the chapter for
Next one
The next one is here
“Hungary and it landed next to Latveria’s border” answered the guard showing a map.
“The Vision in person. Doom is impressed. Why are you here?” asked Doom in the doorstep of the living room
Doom nodded at Peter. Hammer was holding a grudge against Tony but that wasn’t just this, unfortunately, there were more in this but Doom didn’t want to worry Peter more. Erik was looking at Viktor, his friend knew something but didn’t want to say it in front of the kid.
“Of course it would be my pleasure” smiled the chef “ You can wait in the dining room”
“He kidnapped Tony claiming that we couldn’t help him here,” answered Rhodey
“Well, we will save him, but first let’s go say sorry to everyone.”
Peter ran at the end of the roof and jumped using his web to go away. Steve sighed, well that wasn’t easy. But he needed to talk with the kid more, needed to be forgiven by everyone but the kid had to be the first. He sighed and leave the roof.
Tony was really mad. That tiny cage was annoying, he couldn’t use his powers and his arms were really sore. Thanos was truly mad, thinking that he could beat him into submission. “Who created that fucking cage” screamed Tony furiously. He was going to murderer the creator of that shit. “Someone will fucking pay for this” He screamed once more before stopping because he knew that no one will save him here. The heroes on earth will be probably too late to save his sorry ass. He sighed once more. He had to save his own ass again like he used to. He sat down and thought about a way out. Well, there was a way but that was insanely dangerous. He will use it if he had no other choice. Thanos will never had access to his powers and he will not let him do this to him.
“Oh really?” asked Tony tilting his head
All the assemble was quiet in front of the stranger. He was so powerful that everyone decided to stand down. Fighting him was useless. With a gentle smile Tony landed graciously. Well they will listen to him now, and they will not try to restrain him ever again. T’Challa decided to sit back on his throne and invited Edward to do the same in front of them.
“Come in,  don’t wait outside” smiled Rhodey letting them inside
Charles laughed at that, Logan was very fond of Tony and very protective, which was funny because he was considered a loner but with Tony he had a totally different personality like a big protective bear.
“We need…..”
“Yes but HYDRA tortured you so you can’t take all the blame.” replied Vision” And Tony knew that too
“He deserved it” snarled Bruce” He has no right to insult Tony”
“Well i’m a spy and i don’t want to be useless like someone” replied Clint with a huge grin
“The doctors and Shuri are going to take care of him. Don’t worry” smiled Stephen hugging Peter
“Doom demand to see Tony Stark right now” boomed the guy speaking in the third person
“I know, but he can’t know that i’m here, protect them for me, i will be back” said Tony once more before flying away.
Well it was time for Tony to protect the worthy one, the true power of the soul is coming and that will not be pretty for his enemies.
And with just this sentence, he was off, flying toward the palace. Stephen watched the god of Thunder leave, and gently helped Peter stand up before walking toward the palace. Everyone who where outside, came inside. Thor was running in the corridor with his precious man of iron in his arms. He entered inside the medbay and deposed his precious load on a bed and let the medics do their job. Shuri was already inside the room, ready to help Tony.
“Great, we really didn’t need him with all of the problems right now” groaned Logan
“Never”
“Sound dangerous, I’m in” smirked Shuri back.
“My sister is the best at what she do, please rest assure, everything is going to be fine” smiled T’Challa nicely
“Well that was so nice, Shuri is awesome and the plan for saving Mr Stark will be soon ready” answered Peter smiling brightly
“Well it was” smiled Sam still laying
Entering Doctor Doom, couldn't let him out of my story
“Me too it’s so nice” smiled Mantis behind Drax “Too happy for you”
“I was just admiring your skill” smiled Gamora standing up
Everyone looked at the door. T’Challa was watching them with an unreadable expression and Okoye was just furious.
“The king of Asgard shouldn’t bow,” said T’Challa with a smile “ Thank you, Edward, for stopping the blast”
“Please call me Erik, Magneto is only my alias” smirked Erik at their shocked face but his eyes showed just how angry he was in reality. “ So what about Doom then?”
“Who are you?” asked Steve finally fixing the woman
Stephen was walking with T’Challa in the royal garden. They were talking about a lot of things. Stephen didn’t blame him for that, because he helped the sergeant Barnes for correcting the wrong done to him. But the king wasn’t aware of the state of Mister Stark when he had leave the bunker.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony was surprised by the statement of Stephen.  He seemed to really care about his past human life and that was actually really sweet. Tony smiled tenderly, the wizard was really amazing.Stephen watched the tendre smile on Edward’s face. Well that was really strange and in another way, that smile was so familiar. Maybe a bit too familiar.
Tony smiled at their conversation. They wanted to save his human self, that was really nice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Doom smiled at that, making smiled Tony’s children was very rewarding. He sat in front of them, waiting patiently for his new guest. He watched the kid and the android talking happily. Doom was happy to see that some people cared for his beloved Tony. Suddenly the door from the room opened brusquely and a man with a powerful aura stepped in.
"It has to be
The harvest had been weak this year – the snow had fallen a full month early, and while the province's farmers had worked hard to bring as much of the crops in as possible, their stores for the winter are just barely passable.
Pepper's small, dry hand covers one of his, but she doesn't say anything. Tony stares at the castle as they approach, his knee bouncing anxiously.
It's different this time – it's the kind of orgasm only an Omega can have on a knot, and Tony writhes, shakes, shudders with pleasure that seems to go on forever. His eyes are rolled back in his head, his limbs jerking, his body clenching hard and fast as he comes and comes.
. All his choices and decisions have been made
from the glasses?
"Oh, yes," Tony says, nodding exaggeratedly. "Absolutely."
It's too soon, it's too fast, but Tony slinks back anyway, his slick hole so wet but so tight. He cries out but he doesn't stop moving, pushing back deliberately.
Steve wants to pinch himself. He'd been doing well, he'd thought. Tony had seemed interested in the story, invested in it. What had he said wrong?
Cold in the pit of Tony's stomach, but he steels himself for the rest of it. He knows what's coming.
Tony stares at her, mouth slack. "What?"
"I mean, it's like words come out of your mouth that have
He'll just have to make sure he's clear this time.
"I think – I'm quite tired," Tony says, wiping his mouth with a napkin and setting it aside. He hasn't touched his cake. "It's been a long day of travel, I should probably head to bed for the night."
"Yeah," Tony moans, almost dreamily. "Yeah, gimme y'r knot."
Pepper's grin turns slightly feral. "No, but you are."
Steve smirks. "Nope, just as fragile as the next guy, I guess."
Tony looks over her shoulder, at the people – the engineers – in the hallway, at Rhodey. Rhodey has an odd expression on his face, as well. Some mixture of tentative awe, encouragement, even pride.
"Nat –" he tries again.
Tony's cock and belly are slick and messy with his own come, his cock still half-hard. Steve reaches down and wraps his hand around it, stroking it slowly but purposefully.
Tony is desperate, gorgeous, and needy, and Steve wants to give him everything. He wants to give Tony the hard fucking he's begging for.
. He can see it in Steve's face that he really hadn't meant anything by it.
with Steve.
"And what about Anthony Stark? Do you have a soft spot for him?"
"I don't want to –"
Steve supposes it is. At least, it would be, if he were still in Starkland.
, Tony," Rhodey reiterates, watching the castle as they approach it. It's late afternoon, and the sun is already low on the horizon. The short days of the winter seem somehow even shorter out here, this far from home.
you don't want that."
The appointment with Dr. Banner goes well. Tony had expected it to – he is, after all, still untouched by an Alpha – but he wouldn't have put it past his father to plant some misleading evidence or buy the doctor off entirely just to embarrass him. So, either his father had left it alone, or his attempt to make the doctor lie had been unfruitful.
Tony doesn't say anything for a long moment, but he stops fleeing.
"Morning," Steve says, tilting his head up with a grin. Tony leans down to kiss the top of his head, resisting the urge to just drop into Steve's lap for a cuddle. The paperwork looks important.
They stand there awkwardly together for a while, then Steve brightens up. "Will you show me?"
"We're not the middle of
"You can still back out," Bucky says softly. "I'm givin' you the gears here, I know, but the real bitch of it is that this is going to be it for you, pal. You don't get to choose how the rest of your life goes after this."
"I promise, I'll come home as soon as I can," Steve tells him, pressing a kiss to Tony's temple. He stands, setting Tony down on the bed. "You can – stay here, if you like. Or go back to your rooms, if you'd be more comfortable, I don't… whatever you want. Natasha and everyone else will take good care of you."
Steve gives one shoulder a sad little hitch up. "That's the thing about being a leader, Buck. Sometimes you have to sacrifice the things you want in order to make sure your people have the things they need. We don't have the stores, the soldiers,
"A water issue."
"So, an Omega Consort is gonna go to an Alpha, usually, right? That's just how this works, that's the point of the Consort training – to be the perfect mate for some nebulous, powerful Alpha. Kings and queens, rich folks, powerful folks. Those are the kind of people who are gonna get these Omegas, right?"
No. This whole trip has felt like a death sentence because if he's not very, very careful, it may actually be one.
It's the not knowing that's killing him now. What will the people be like? What will Lord Steven be like? Will he have normal Alpha appetites, or strange ones? What
"There's the palace," Pepper murmurs into his ear, leaning into his space. He looks up in surprise, his heart hammering in his chest. He can see it before them. It's still a ways away, but the ground is even and the snow has been packed down by traffic before them, so Tony can see it clearly up the road.
"Does it have to be
"I want you to have your own space," Steve continues. He's either oblivious to Tony's heart breaking, his stomach sinking with the feeling of being unwanted, or he's soldiering on anyway because he doesn't
Tony's body to accept him all.
Tony cries out into his mouth, but he doesn't clench up or shy away, so Steve allows himself a few moments to push his fingers in and out. Tony's hole is tight, but open enough to take him if he moves slowly.
Tony sends a note to Steve to cancel dinner. He
Steve steps forward, reaches for Tony's hands. Tony startles, but he doesn't shy away, so Steve takes both hands in his own, squeezing them lightly.
Steve dips his tongue into Tony's navel, swirls his tongue inside. Tony moans.
Tony swallows, feels his throat bobbing, and glances down at the handful of plants in Steve's hands.
"I didn't want this. I don't want some – some property. I always wanted a
"He didn't
"Is there something wrong?" Tony asks, spine tense. Steve sits down and pulls Tony down onto his lap, burying his face in the crook of Tony's neck.
Steve looks down at the contract, at the last page he's flipped to. There's a straight line across the bottom, waiting for a signature. He stares at it.
Had plenty of punch where it mattered most
"You can't stay until spring, Tony," Pepper reminds him, wrapping herself in an additional few layers of clothing. "We'll be in America in days."
He feels his body next; loose-limbed and warm, his muscles slightly sore. His legs are a little shaky, his asshole a little loose from Steve's huge knot. His skin is sticky with sweat and slick and come, and he needs a bath.
of an Omega, acting like he could be an engineer, like he could do something other than lie on his back and spread his–
"You must be the Prince," she says with a small bow of her head. "I don't believe we've had the pleasure."
"You must have been grateful."
"The intensity with which I have wanted to fuck you has nothing to do with obligation, and everything to do with how deliciously gorgeous you are," Steve growls. He softens his tone, but squeezes Tony a little more tightly to himself. "I won't make you do anything you don't want to, and if this is the last time you want to have me, we can get you started back on your suppressants and it'll never happen again. But if you want me to? If you'll let me? Tony, I would…" he trails off, shaking his head a little. It's too soon for declarations of anything, and Steve's not even entirely sure what his own feelings are yet, anyway. He just knows that he wants to see Tony come on his knot again and again, wants to see the way he loses control, his whole body seizing with overwhelming pleasure. "I would," Steve repeats lamely.
The fever has broken, and his heat is over.
"Tony," Steve says, and leaves it at that. He does reach out and place a hand on Tony's knee in a gesture meant to be comforting.
"Tony?" Natasha's face is pinched, her eyebrows slanted in concern. "Are you okay?"
Steve rolls his eyes and starts flipping through the contract paperwork. "Why am I doing this again?" he asks, pained.
"No, of course not," Tony tells her. "It's simply late."
"It's going to be okay," Pepper says, pulling Tony out of his rushing, wild thoughts. "It really is, Tony."
It's Tony's turn to snort. "Relax? Oh my god, Pepper, have you even been paying attention?"
Tony shivers, and Steve feels his cock swell between them.
Tony's heartbreak, doesn't want Tony to want him.
She sighs. "When he came to me this morning, do you know what he said?"
Tony sits down, waiting until Steve has sat down before taking the pot off the stew and dishing some onto Steve's plate. He serves himself second, pouring wine into each of their cups.
want to have dinner with his Alpha, but they've almost reached a breakthrough on one of the long range weapons, and Tony prioritizes.
"You know it does," Wilson tells him, tone low. "I don't like it either, man, but we've been –"
Tony gives a sharp little nod. "I'm here because I've been bonded to your Lord. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be bonded to such a strong, powerful Alpha, to help him run his household and his kingdom. I look forward to offering any and all assistance that I can when it comes to navigating the politics of kingdoms, and bringing him happiness in all the ways that I can."
"Want them closer to the prince's room, or in the 'other motherfuckers' wing with me 'n Clint?"
"May I present Prince Anthony Stark of Starkland, son of Howard." Ms. Potts' voice carries into the room. "And you are?"
"Is it dangerous?" Tony is suddenly gripped with a choking sensation, a tightness in his chest. What if something were to happen to Steve? He'd be out there, unprotected against the elements and the enemy, and it could be an ambush. Steve could end up killed or captured. What would happen to Tony then? Surely he'd be shipped back to Howard, in disgrace and used, and he'd never be able to escape again.
"I understand things were done a different way in Starkland, and when you were at the academy," Steve tells him. "But that's not the way it is here. I don't even know how you think you might have offended me, but I can assure you that even if I
. "They're Omegas who have been taught proper manners and political history and diplomacy and –"
And oh, Tony longs for that to be true. Still, a hopeful, confident promise isn't exactly a
And if they fulfil all of their potential
Tony blinks.
"Sure," Tony shrugs. "Built the pipes and the drainage systems, use gravity to make the water flow where you want it."
"My lord," the young man says, keeping his head bowed. Steve desperately wants him to look up again so he can stare into the young man's eyes.
Steve sighs, and it sounds relieved. Of course he does. Tony understands – Steve doesn't want to take Tony to bed again, but it would be better if the kingdom thinks of them as bondmates. Meals together are a good way of solidifying that. Steve would know that.
But if Tony goes on suppressants, he won't even
Steve puts him down on it gently, using his body to push Tony onto his back. He takes hold of Tony's hands, pushes them up over his head and down onto the mattress. When Steve releases them, Tony keeps them there obediently, so Steve gives him one more kiss before pulling back, lifting himself up, and moving to stand at the edge of the bed between Tony's spread knees. His hands slowly go to Tony's waistband, telegraphing his intention.
"I think you know I don't."
"So how are things?" Natasha asks him, her voice too obviously casual. "The castle is simply
"Good answer," Natasha says, gracefully climbing to her feet. She takes one more grape, and heads for the door. A moment before she reaches it, there's a sharp rap on the wood. Steve feels his heart jump.
"You have
And finally, there's the “big guy”
about the walls," Tony grins, as though he hasn't heard Steve's question, or as if he's misunderstood it. "But he had the palace engineers in to look it over, and not a week later they were doing the same in his chambers."
"These are for you," Steve says, thrusting them out. "I picked them myself."
That first heat, when they had consummated their bond, Steve had done something for him that he hadn't expected. He'd been taught how to do it, of course — they'd been taught how to do most anything sexual at the academy — but it wasn't something an Omega should expect from their Alpha, as it was designed to give pleasure to the receiver, and generally Alphas were not so interested in the pleasure of their Omegas.
"You mean that?" he asks. For the first time, he's starting to believe it.
She squeezes his shoulder in her small hand, then stands up and heads for the door. "Now, I've been on the road for two weeks, I need a hot bath and bottle of wine."
"He had to go, Pepper. I thought he wanted me to go with him but he said it's too – but it doesn't matter, this is good, right? I mean, now I don't have to, like, be at his beck and call, and whatever. I'm free to read and, and get to know the castle a little better, and do whatever I want without having to, to go see to my Alpha's cock, or anything–"
He's been trained in several different types of sexual discourse, of course, but he's going into this blind. Would his Alpha be rough? Cruel, perhaps?
"Oh, I knew you were okay," she says. "I did my homework. I just thought I'd properly introduce myself, and I wanted to get to know you a little better."
"Great. Come with me, I can show you around the castle, get you set up in your rooms. I'll send someone for your things." Wilson gestures toward the stairs, then begins climbing them, slowly so that Tony, Pepper and Rhodey can fall into step with him.
"Strip," she tells him, rearranging things on the table. She picks up a sweet-smelling soap and the shaving blade, heading back toward the washroom. Tony, knowing better than to argue with her, follows behind while undoing is pants. This, at least, he's familiar with.
A cold feeling of panic and dread drops in his belly, and he feels his face drain of colour. "I was just–"
"If spring doesn't come early, we'll actually run out of a lot of our stores," Steve says. Bucky already knows all this, of course. They've been talking about these things for months while Steve had waffled back and forth between asking King Howard for assistance and being willing to pay the price for that assistance.
The lace forces Steve to lick and suck with more pressure than he ordinarily would, but the texture of the lace over smooth, silky skin is intriguing and sexy.
"A running water issue."
"Why wouldn't I want to?" Tony asks, jerking his head up, looking panicked. "Of course I – you're my Alpha, and anything you want to do to – with me, I would want that–"
Tony nods. 'Steve' sounds like a nice name. Friendly.
"Okay, yeah, but he's never done
"–Oh my god, Steve, that's not what you
Tony glances at the clock as well. "Anywhere specific I need to go?"
"Tony?"
"Yes!" Clint says, pumping a fist in the air. "Do I get your Omega sex kitten, too?"
Tony's cheeks – which, honestly, shouldn't he be immune to sexual embarrassment by now? – heat and he scowls at her. "Stop that. I'm not going to talk about my… relations with my bondmate. Not with you."
Tony's moans are near constant, and he's shifting and rocking on the bed, seeking more, seeking friction or penetration or anything he can get.
"I'm not," Tony admits. "I could… tomorrow? Dinner, tomorrow."

Barnes shrugs a little. "Won't know until you try."
"So that was weird," he murmurs under his breath. "Where's Lord Steven?"
idea. I'm just saying – isn't there another way?"
+++++
the sarcasm in it, "I'll take my leave, then."
"Sam sent them back with Redwing," Steve says, nodding at the paperwork. "The troops have managed to push the Chitauri back past the river."
"Wait, you did what?" Steve asks, blinking.
"Of course," Tony says, pulling the door open and gesturing Steve inside.
"Sure."
He'd be lying if he said he hadn't been thinking about the more… intimate details of taking on a Consort as a bondmate. At the same time, the thought of it all makes him uncomfortable more than anything else. What if King Howard sends him a simpering fool of an Omega? Or worse, one with cunning and more loyalty to Howard than to their new Alpha? Steve doesn't think they're doing anything out here in America that could be a problem, but he still isn't sure he'd be comfortable with a spy coming into his home.
Prince Anthony just smiles at him, but it doesn't quite reach his eyes – it's not anything like the beautiful little smile Steve had seen a few moments ago.
Tony shrugs. "I have a – a good memory. And the life of an Omega… well, sometimes you have to be able to say something without words."
"You feel so good, honey," Steve groans, thrusting harder. "You're so good for me."
Steve cries out underneath him, fingers clenching and digging into the bedding, and Tony takes his time, slowly swallowing Steve all the way down and then drawing his head up to the tip, then softening his tongue and lips and throat and sinking back down.
"Wanna watch you come like this all the time," Steve growls, grinding his knot deeper into Tony's prostate, reveling in the way Tony whines and gasps and squeezes around him. More slick leaks out between them, and Steve's thighs are soaked, wet and slick with Tony's fluids, and it's so hot Steve's own cock gives another valiant twitch, pulsing and spurting more come into Tony's body.
"Come in," he says, looking up gratefully. Bucky comes in, with Bruce, the castle's doctor in tow.
know is that the guy's probably a giant asshole. Howard would never have sent Tony to an Alpha that wasn't.
"So what if I want to use the team to build something else? Do you think that would be okay?"
"I am
He glances back to the bouquet, eyeing the selection. "Yellow carnations," he points out.
Tony starts slowly, swirling his tongue and bobbing his head, and Steve can honestly say, with complete and utter sincerity, that he's never had a blowjob like this. Tony's mouth is hot and wet, his tongue talented. He starts to bob faster, tilting his back and angling his head to open his throat, and suddenly he's sucking Steve all the way down to the base. Tony's throat opens and the tight, hot grip of it around Steve is heaven. Tony's throat clenches around him, then he pulls off with a little cough. He grins, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand as Steve stares at him, slack jawed.
The pink skin is fresh and clean, furled and wet with moisture from Tony's own body and from Steve's saliva. The muscle pulses as Tony's inner walls clench and release, arousal and heat and hormones readying him to receive Steve's knot.
"Hi," Steve says, smiling. "You look…" he can't find a word that encompasses how beautiful Tony looks, so he trails off. He swallows roughly. "You look good."
Tony and his team work that way for days. They make breakthrough after breakthrough. By the end of the fifth day, Tony sets the team to mass production. They have so much to do that Rhodey goes around to the other smiths in the kingdom and has them working on the various pieces.
Tony bursts out laughing, surprised by the off-colour joke from her. "At least we can take comfort in the fact Howard sent you and Rhodey with me. Though, I
"So you asked King Howie for help and his response was to insist you take on a sex kitten for a bondmate? Seriously?" Clint asks, looking between Bucky and Steve.
"Regardless, I'm not disappointed. If anything, I'm impressed. I've been impressed with you since you first got here. You're handsome, you're smart, you're kind – Tony, I never would have given you those, if I'd known. I promise."
. A threat to you is a threat to everything!"
She's literally blocking Tony from view, and Steve wants to shove her out the door. He can smell Tony from
Steve stares. "I've never met him. Not yet."
"I'm sorry," Tony murmurs.
"Well, see that green bit there?"
And when they prove to be big everywhere
"I hear congratulations are in order," she says. Her tone is light, but there's an edge to her voice Steve doesn't miss.
"Prince Anthony, it's a pleasure to meet you," Steve says. "I have been looking forward to making your acquaintance for some time. You're as handsome as I'd –"
"Oh," Tony says again.
everything and a good Omega knows how to cook, clean, and sit on a knot.
"Oh, Lord Steven!" she calls back over her shoulder, eyes twinkling merrily because she's awful. "You have a visitor!"
"We'll have to consummate the bond," Steve finally says, keeping his voice gentle. "But after that, if you don't want–"
interested? Had he… he had been so charming, so dashing. He'd seemed to want Tony, when Tony had been in heat. Had it been an act? Hormones, instinctual from the smell of Tony's slick?
," she breathes, voice musical and husky. "And a handsome one at that."
Steve bends over him, draping himself over Tony's back, and he slides in, hard and rough. Tony cries out because Steve is big, and he's been inside Tony already tonight but it doesn't matter, it's still big, every time. Still a stretch that opens him wide.
"I think you can handle it, honey," Steve rumbles in Tony's ear. Tony keens, digging his fingers into Steve's thighs. "But I won't do anything to you that you don't want. Do you want me to stop?"
The door opens, and it's not Rhodey striding into the room at all. It's Natasha, Steve's redheaded friend. The one Steve had said would stay behind to keep an eye on him.
," she growls. "Just because you're an Omega–"
"I wanted to introduce myself," he continues. "I'm James Barnes, I'm the Captain of the Guard here in America, and a good friend to Lord Steven."
Steve blinks, searching Tony's face for a smile or a twitch to indicate that he's joking, but Tony looks serious. Serious and terrified.
"How do you feel, love?" Steve asks him, moving up to lay beside Tony. Tony is sprawled out on the bed, not sure what day it is or how long Steve has been torturing him so sweetly, or how to answer that. He feels everything.
Pepper walks over to the bed and starts to sort through the undergarments.
Steve strokes his hand a little faster on Tony's cock, watching in fascination as Tony starts to harden again. The head of his cock is deep red, obviously sensitive, and Steve wonders how far he can push Tony, how many times he can make the Omega come for him.
"No, you won't," he says, resigned smile twitching up one side of his mouth. "You can't. This is my life now, Pep. Whatever he ends up being – whatever he wants to do to me, that's what I was made for, right?"
Steve's loving arms. He can admit that, now. That Steve cares for him just as deeply as Tony cares for Steve. Steve has been nothing but kind, has been gentle and generous and Tony hadn't ever expected it. But it's time to stop hiding from it.
The people of Starkland had long cut ties with Krasnyygorod – there'd been a trade embargo for years, mostly based on the way they treated their Omega population. There had been a few refugees through the years, but Tony doesn't think he's ever met an Omega who'd been through their rigorous training programs.
Tony deepens the kiss, letting out a quiet whine as he shifts and climbs over Steve to straddle his lap.
"Not how the kingdom's gonna see it."
Steve wraps his hands around Tony's waist in return, spreading his fingers wide so he can touch as much of Tony as possible. Steve can feel the heat of his skin through his clothing.
"You can… go ahead and schedule whatever you need to," Steve says. "But whatever the result… I don't want to hear about it, okay?"
It's clearly not one of the richer provinces. There's a fair amount of activity at the front gates, and Tony images it's the townspeople preparing for his arrival. God, he'd hoped to avoid a production, really. The last thing he'd wanted was to be gawked at by a bunch of local farmhands who don't know the first thing about a Consort.
"I asked the same thing. I don't think they're
Howard Stark is stubborn enough that Tony is fairly certain it's not the latter.
"We could just turn around? Head back to the mountains, find a cave to live in?"
He's beautiful. The colour of his shirt brings out the flush in his cheeks. His facial hair is impeccably groomed, but his hair is mussed and his eyes are lined with a smudged layer of kohl – it makes the deep golden flecks pop from the warm, rich brown of his irises. His slacks are grey, hugging the curves of his hips and the muscles of his thighs.
Bucky has been Steve's friend since long before Steve had been named Lord of America – since before they'd both joined the army, even. Bucky had pulled Steve out of one of many scrapes with an angry older boy when they were both children, and they'd been inseparable since then. Bucky had been there his whole life, up until the Beta had gone off to join the war effort to fight back the Hydra hordes for King Howard. He'd been gone to war for nearly a year when Steve had found the apothecary on the edge of the province. The one who had given him an elixir that had cured his many maladies and had transformed him from a sickly, tiny Alpha into the bulky, robust one he is today.
He stares at her, shocked, for a long moment.
"Let me – let me talk to Tony about it, okay? Before you – before you do anything." He directs this last to Bruce, who just nods.
Tony had wanted to study
Bucky sighs and rolls his eyes. "It's an exam to make sure he's never been knotted before," he says. "You
Tony had tried looking at the scenery – all he'd seen was snow, snow and more snow, so he'd given up that little exercise in futility.
Tony wants to argue, but he can't think of an argument. Especially not after everything he and Natasha had talked about. If there were ever a place where an Omega could be an engineer, he supposes America is it.
from under her eyelashes.
Steve flops back into his chair. "Another one? I really think they're coming, Buck."
He really is beautiful.
Steve crooks a finger under Tony's chin and tilts his face up to meet Steve's eyes. "Tony, I've thought about you like this since the first time I saw you. How could I not?"
His body language shifts immediately, and while his spine stays straight, he somehow manages to tip his head down just enough to present a picture of submission, of reverence. "I'm not anyone special, really," he says, letting his voice take on the slightly breathy tone people expect from a Consort.
A dark-skinned man opens the door, and Steve blinks. He'd never actually
"I want you. I care about you. I want… I want this. Us."
"Nothing!" Tony says, sounding defensive. "I shouldn't have said anything."
"Prince Anthony, I believe his highness is just concerned that you might find the procedure invasive, or uncomfortable. Your highness, Prince Anthony is quite used to these exams – not only are they important to track his health, but they were performed every six months at the academy. It's a medical procedure the prince is quite used to."
He pops his head up from the nest of blankets to see if he can find Steve. Maybe Steve had gotten out of bed to secure them some breakfast. Tony hadn't eaten much over the past few days, his heat pushing aside any appetite, and now he's ravenous. He'd seen all manner of delicate pastries in Steve's rooms over the past two days, and his stomach growls hopefully as he looks around.
But how do I make him lose control
Sam gives him a warm, wide smile, and it brightens the gloom of the room immediately. "See, that right there? That's what you'd call a good start."
"It can hurt, sometimes," he finally says. Tony's body tenses a little. "But I don't want to hurt you," Steve adds. He sighs. "It's not supposed to. Hurt, I mean. If an Alpha is careful, if he makes sure to be gentle, it doesn't have to
Tony blinks, unsure what to say. He can't think of anything, so he clutches the new bouquet tightly in his fist, and turns to leave the garden. Warmth hums over his skin, and he can feel a low, warning cramp deep in his belly.
"What's all this?" Clint asks, gesturing to the contracts on the table. "Is this why we have bribery baked goods?"
"That's not what I meant to–" Steve stops himself, gives himself a little shake. "I meant to be more suave about that," he admits. "I wanted – when we talked, the other day, in the garden, I told you you had no obligation to me."
It doesn't mean 'I want to bend you over the nearest bench and have my way with you'.
"Oh, Tony," she says with a sigh. "His subjects are very loyal, did you know? Anybody I've talked to in town has nothing but good things to say about Lord Steven. And surely you've seen how fiercely protective his friends are?"
Tony gives him a smile. "Thank you, Mr. Barton. It's nice to meet you, as well."
Tony heads into the bathroom, reaching for the hem of his shirt but then stopping dead in his tracks as he looks around the bathroom.
"I was… I mean… has it… always been that size?"
"May I?" he asks, voice husky. Tony nods, eyes wide. He licks at his swollen lips, and Steve keeps his eyes on Tony's face when he undoes the buttons and ties at his waist.
“No,” Steve interrupted. “You’ll tell me the rest when you’re ready.”
The genius broke the kiss and started making his way towards Steve’s neck leaving a trail or kisses and sensual nips in his wake. Once Tony reached the place where his lover’s neck and shoulders connected, he gave a particularly hard bite, causing Steve’s sure fingers to falter on the small button he was currently attempting to undo. Steve could feel Tony’s smirk against his skin, but decided to ignore it in favor of undressing his lover.
Steve was a good 5 minutes behind his teammates and had been tasked with looking through the remains of the buildings and directing anyone he found to the Shield evacuation points. There weren't many people left in the city, but Steve had managed to come across a good half a a dozen stragglers in his search.
Steve gasped slightly as the cold air hit his now fully erect penis. Tony’s mouth made its way back to Steve’s ear, the smirk back on that infuriating mouth.
“I missed you.” Steve breathed, the sound almost too quiet for Tony to hear.
“Then we should cuwddle with her too.” Peter retorted adorably.
“Bull shit.” The CEO cried more loudly than before, his finger flying up to poke the super soldier in the chest.
"This is the great hall," Wilson tells them. "Steve's not into the whole 'throne' thing, so we don't have one of those." He rolls his eyes, and while it seems fond, Tony can't help but be struck at the disrespect of it. Howard would probably have had the man beheaded.
"I'm Prince Anthony's valet," she says to him. "Pepper Potts."
The rush of slick and come that slips out of Tony's soft, open hole when Steve finally pulls out of him is almost as hot as the tiny little moaning sound the Omega makes at the loss. Steve pets him, soothes him, and kisses him as he rearranges them on the bed to get under the covers, pulling Tony tightly to his chest.
that you can just inspect for
"Knot me, knot me, knot me," Tony is chanting, and Steve pulls back before thrusting forward, harder and faster, again and again. Tony's breaths are coming out in desperate sobs, his hands grasping at the bedding.
. Everyone else can see it."
His fingers fly over the paper, drawing out equations and trajectories and arcs. He theorizes chemical reactions. He builds in his mind towering fortresses, long-range weapons, and diamond-hard armor.
"Do you see yourself right now? Do you have any idea how cold it is out there? I'm not going
"Or something to that effect. Because you never once told him you liked him. And, frankly, I would have said the biggest idiot in the whole kingdom could see that he's head over heels for you, too, except
"Thank you for the thought," Tony finally says, throat tight.
The training centres in Krasnyygorod had long been a terrible story told to misbehaving Omegas in Starkland. Not as a threat, of course – that would have been cruel – but as a cautionary tale. 'Sure, you can't be a doctor, but at least you don't live in
He had passed, though. Not because he'd believed any of the garbage he'd spewed during exams or discussions. Because as much as Howard hated to admit it, his Omega son was, while useless in all aspects of politics and inheritance, a genius. So Tony had learned how to game the system at school.
Steve obliges the request, hands gripping Tony's hips hard, and there will be bruises. Bruises that Tony will press his fingers into, tomorrow, to feel the sharp edge and revel in it, in how much Steve wants him. Steve is fucking into him hard, and Tony cries out with every thrust, but he pushes back, too, matching Steve's rhythm and meeting his wildness with a wildness of his own. Steve pulls Tony's hips back, pulling him onto his cock, growling and fucking Tony harder than he's ever been fucked in his life.
," Tony moans, squirming. His whole body trembles.
Not that he has any control over his heat whatsoever. He misses the suppressants desperately. He wonders if Steve had really meant it when he said Tony could go back on them after they… consummate.
"Tell me what I've done wrong. At least so I don't do it again," Steve says, stepping forward again. He's holding the flowers down by his hip. "Please."
"It's all the way to the south," Steve grimaces. "And we can't go straight down, that would be too risky."
Steve is nowhere in the room. Tony works his way to the side of the large bed, getting up on unsteady legs and padding over to the bedroom door. He reaches down for Steve's shirt, laying crumpled on the floor. Tony drapes it over his shoulders and buttons up the bottom buttons to hide his genitals, at least. Just in case.
Tony whines again, grinding down on Steve's lap.
depends on Lord Steven liking him.
Steve's expression, instead of the amused cheekiness Tony had been going for, falls into that look of sympathy again.
"Just—" Tony raises himself slightly on his knees and then pushes down again, his vice-like hole gripping and squeezing Steve's cock wetly. "Just right," he sighs, sounding less strained now. He raises himself up again and pushes back down, sets himself a slow, deliberate rhythm.
"No. Well, I mean, it was intense," Tony says. "But it didn't hurt."
"I didn't–"
That had gone spectacularly badly.
. I will stay in this coach until
He pulls at Tony's hip, pushes his leg over, and rolls Tony over onto his back with very little assistance from the Omega himself.
"In America, apparently, they do."
normal Alpha appetites?
"It's not important," Tony says again, because it
"It's not your
"It's not about his training, or his schooling, or anything else. It's about
"Yes," Tony says, sort of hoping Steve won't ask the next question. Of course, Steve is bound to ask it.
"No, honey, no," Steve says, nuzzling in behind Tony's ear. He takes Tony's trembling hand in his own. "It's not dangerous. We're just going to go ask some questions, try and get some information."
"Hold your panties out of the way for me," Steve instructs, voice almost hoarse, before pushing back in, this time with two fingers and his tongue, and Tony obeys immediately, reaching back to pull the lace fabric off to the side so that Steve has both hands free, and he slides his other hand in under Tony's body, cupping his cock in the lace. His cock is a nice size, bigger than his frame would suggest, but Steve has big hands, too, so he can mostly cover the bulge of it. Tony cries out, thrusts his hips forward mindlessly, fucking into Steve's hand.
"Long day?" Tony asks her, opening the door and gesturing toward his sitting room. She sweeps into the room and sits down, somehow managing to make flopping onto his sofa look graceful.
"Very noble of you," Tony says, very quietly.
Now, Steve supposes it had always been the Consort academy, not just any boarding school.
, Nat, you know that. I wanted to find someone to share my life with."
"Captain James Rhodes," Rhodey says, thrusting out a hand to shake. Wilson does so with a firm grip, then turns to give Pepper a genial bow.
Tony just glares at him.
"Do you like it like this?" Steve asks, murmuring the words into Tony's skin. He wants to know everything about Tony, he wants to know his favourite ways to make love so that he can do all of them, make Tony scream and cry under him. "When you're riding me like this, taking me? Do you want my knot like this?"
"By the time you get the tub filled I'll–" Tony cuts himself off, his whole body freezing.
Tony sinks further onto him, trying to pick up speed with the kiss. Steve slides one hand up Tony's spine, up to the back of his neck, and grips him there to hold him still. Tony's body instantly freezes, then relaxes into the dominating touch, and he lets out a sigh of pleasure as Steve takes control of the kiss, keeping it slow and deep.
Tony's eyes pop open wide as he falls over the edge, his cock pulsing and his ass clenching as he comes. It spurts between them, splashing up over Tony's chest, over his nipples, and it's gorgeous. He looks sinful, wild and fucked out, and Steve follows him. He feels his knot grow, feels himself swell and pulse, and then his vision whites out and he's coming, pouring himself into Tony's body, coating his insides with his spend.
"At least my heat is over," Tony says, trying to sound cheerful so Steve will stop sounding sad.
"The king's son?" she asks, humming thoughtfully. "That's interesting."
"But if you have any regard for the 'little guy', you should make note to have that same generosity toward him."
Natasha smiles again, slow and sly like a cat who'd just lapped up a bowl of cream. "I bet he was."
When the pants are loose, Steve dives his fingers inside the waistband and begins to pull, and that's when he looks down to see what he's revealing.
The guy's hilarious.
Tony huffs in a very unprincely manner. "I'd be shocked if it did," he admits. "But you didn't ask me if I was honest, you asked me why I was here. Do you think I'll be honest if I tell you?"
At least, that's what his lessons had told him. He's not sure about the sexual desire part of things – he's had sex, of course, with the Beta professors and some of his Omega classmates. How else would he be expected to learn, really? And it had been fun, god knows he'd enjoyed it. Excelled at some of his lessons, there, really.
No, they all sound too pathetic.
He doesn't pretend not to know what she's talking about, but he doesn't agree to it, either. She walks out the door without a second look back, as though she knows he won't be able to
"So, you're King Howard's heir," Barnes says, and it sounds not-quite light. Ah. Tony supposes he should have expected suspicion. The highest ruler's only son sent off to bond with a provincial Lord at the edge of the kingdom – and most people wouldn't know just how very much Howard hates his Omega son.
He doesn't know where it's coming from. It's not like he's never done this before, though it has, admittedly, been a while. But somehow, this feels different. More meaningful.
"And now I want you to know you're not obligated to do anything else," Steve says, nodding. "Do you understand?"
It feels heavenly, the grime and sweat and slick coming off him and leaving him warm and clean and sweet-smelling.
"No," Tony says, his voice cracking a little. He doesn't take his eyes off Steve, either. "No, thank you, Ms. Potts. That will be all."
"Please," Tony gasps, a rush of slick easing the way further for Steve's questing fingers. "God, please, Steve, I need your knot."
There was nothing slight that I let into me.
He doesn't mind the primping, truth be told. It's the idea of it, the idea that he has to somehow
"I'm not," he says, and it's a little quiet. "I would never."
"That's good," Steve says, pressing back in. He licks and sucks, using his hands to push Tony's legs apart, spread his cheeks. After a few moments, he slides his fingers in under the lace and pulls it to the side, stretching it over and up to expose Tony's slick, soft hole.
"That's true, you didn't," Bucky agrees, taking a pastry from the beautiful basket that had come with the packet of contracts from King Howard's messenger. He bites into it, flaky crumbs dropping into his lap as he leans back on the sofa.
The first taste of Tony's slick on the lace of his bodysuit is ambrosia. The musky scent of it and sweet taste on his tongue pull a groan out of him – a groan completely drowned out by the startled yelp from Tony when Steve licks hard at the lace covering his opening.
"Huh," Tony says, giving them both a nonchalant grin. "I'll admit I wouldn't have expected you to just come right out and ask it."
To his surprise, her body language exactly mirrors his. She hasn't changed her facial expression but her lips look pouty, suddenly, as she glances up at him from underneath her eyelashes, lifting a hand to tuck a stray lock of shockingly beautiful red hair behind her ear. "Oh, but, your grace, you're a
Tony pushes at Steve's thigh, then the other, over his own shoulders and then higher still, until Steve takes hold of his own legs, hands under his knees, and spreads himself, opening himself, showing Tony his hole.
Steve had immediately gone to the front lines to help with the war, and risen through the ranks to lead his own company – a company he had insisted Bucky join. Steve had led Bucky and their men to the heart of the Hydra kingdom and defeated their leader, the Red Skull, effectively ending the war. Bucky had lost an arm in the battle, and Erskine, the apothecary who had given Steve his potion, had died while they were away.
He leans forward and wraps his arms under Tony's chest, under his hips, and pulls him close against Steve's torso. He's strong enough to lift Tony without any trouble, so he picks Tony up, holding him so that his knot stays in place. Tony moans mindlessly as Steve rolls and lays on his back on the bed, letting his legs dangle off the side. Tony's legs are draped over the outside of Steve's thighs, so when Steve spreads his knees apart, it spreads Tony's legs further apart.
"You – you can call me Tony, if you like. Steve."
Tony's lips are slack, his eyes half-lidded. His cheeks are flushed, and he's still breathing hard, looking stunned.
"So what now?"
To say I got hammered is saying the least !
"Is everything okay?" Steve asks, quirking one eyebrow.
"So you'll bond with an Omega you've never met. Steve, I
"Steve's room is down this hall," he says, waving at a hallway as they pass. "But Prince Anthony, we have your room just up this way."
For a long, horrifying moment, they just stare awkwardly at one another. Steve can't think of a single thing to say.
, Tony thinks to himself.
"Okay. Thank you, for coming for a walk with me," Steve says, still watching him carefully. "Would you… like to have dinner with me? Soon? It doesn't have to be tonight, it can be tomorrow, or the day after. Or… I don't know, you might be busy."
"It's expected," Bucky says.
"I'm sorry," Steve says again. "Sam… brought news. I wanted to let you sleep."
Then he leaves the room. Bruce is in the hallway, waiting for him.
"Nothing. We had a good time. We are well consummated. No problems with the bonding contract here."
Steve clears his throat and speaks first. "I wanted to apologize about… everything."
He's saved from too much more pacing and obsessing by a hesitant knock on the door. He rushes over to it, running his hands over his torso to smooth the fabric of his shirt.
They serumed up a super soldier

"So," he says, putting his cup back on the table gently. "Have you sufficiently convinced yourself I'm okay?"
"He'd said he could – that Starkland had running water.

White roses, to signify a new beginning. Peony for happy life and good health. Orange roses for fascination, aster for patience, white chrysanthemum for loyalty, and a fistful of myrtle to symbolize good luck and love in a marriage.
"You're shaking," Steve says. "Are you okay?"
He dips his tongue inside then, feeling the tight muscle stretch around him, and Steve moans, his balls twitching against Tony's forehead.
"I don't think you're all that excited to be here," he finally says. "But I don't think you're here to hurt him, and that's the only thing I give a shit about."
"I love you, Steve," Sam says after a moment. "I want you to know that. You're a very good friend, and you're very heroic. People look up to you. I'm telling you this so that when I tell you this next part, you understand it's coming from a place of love. You can be
Tony nods, mouth falling open on another gasp, a moan. "Only yours."
Tony wraps his legs around Steve's hips for purchase, grinding against him as Steve walks them through to the bedroom, to the bed, and he lays them down, covering Tony's body with his own.
offended, I would not
"I'm sorry," he says. "I really had no idea."
His knot thickens, and Steve can't help it, he grinds himself in deeper, tries to get as deep into Tony as he can as his knot locks them together, stretching the rim of Tony's entrance.
"This says Stark will be bringing his valet and his bodyguard with him. Ask the staff to make up rooms for them?"
Tony glances up. Rhodey has already left the coach and is outside talking to some of the soldiers they're traveling with.
do to him in that bed.
"But how many people would we lose if we tried to do it on our own?" Steve says. "And if we send the whole army to the waterfront to keep the Chitauri at bay, who's watching our eastern borders?"
I was finished off by a man who was big enough
He hadn't thought he'd want that, but he had. It had felt good, if intense.
With sleight of hand as his specialty
"It's delicious," Tony says after he's chewed and swallowed his bite. He glances up under his lashes and catches Steve's gaze still on him, and his cheeks flush again.
"You gonna be okay, Stevie?" Bucky asks, a beat or two after the door closes behind Clint.
That left Tony's coach, with Pepper and Rhodey, on the road up to the castle alone.
He'd been so
"When you traded, when you signed those contracts with my father. It wasn't about me, I know that, I know Howard foisted me–"
Tony feels his cheeks pink a little. "I appreciate the thought. It really is lovely of you."
The note had explained that Steve's new bondmate was, in fact, the Omega son of King Howard himself. Not that, Steve supposes, that's any kind of positive aspect in most people's eyes.
"Thanks," Tony says to Wilson. He reaches for the handle in the gate, pushing the door open.
Steve stares at him for a long moment. He's suddenly gripped by the intense need to taste Tony, to taste the ambrosia of his slick, to see if it's as good as it smells. He moves forward slowly, placing his hand on Tony's back and sliding it down to the round firmness of his ass. Tony shivers.
"Hey, Stevie," Bucky says, flopping into the chair across from him. Bruce comes in with more dignity, moving with purpose until he can sit in the third chair.
Steve grins back, then leans forward and kisses him, tasting the wine and chocolate on his lips.
"Lots of flowers have more than one meaning," Tony continues. "Take the yellow rose, for example. On the one hand, it can mean joy, friendship. On the other hand, it can also mean jealousy, a decrease of love."
to him."
Tony blinks at him, confused. "Don't want to what?"
Steve leans against the headboard, resting his hands on Tony's hips. He licks at Tony's lips until they open for him, and then performs a thorough exploration of his mouth.
"Okay, that's fair," Steve says. "I know it's kind of… but I told you, Tony, I don't want to hurt you. I'll do everything I can to make sure I don't."
God, this guy is
Wilson takes them further down the hall, then they climb a flight of stairs and cross over a viewing alcove into another wing of the castle.
"So… what do I do with that?" Steve asked plaintively.
Natasha had said to treat him with care, Steve remembers. Right. He can do that.
in the first place. Now, King Howard was clearly drawing a line in the sand: Steve Rogers isn't royalty by blood, so his bloodline ends here.
Tony nods, and raises a hand in a wave, but Steve is already on his way out the door, leaving Tony alone in the bedroom that smells of their lovemaking.
On the plus side, the fact that most of the coaches and horses had stopped earlier means that there isn't a crowd in front of the castle, waiting to stare at Tony as he gets out and walks to his doom.
And then… it doesn't bear thinking about.
"That'd be great," he says, not taking his eyes off Tony.
"So who else went with them, to question the Chitauri?"
"Steve," he interrupts, putting the wine bottle down on the table. He's rough with it, and a droplet of red liquid slides down the side of it, staining the wood.
"Just because I'm an Omega
He's never been to Krasnyygorod. His father had threatened to send him there a time or two, to be sure, but it hadn't been safe for him to visit, even as the king's son.
She blinks at him. "No. Tony, you're not getting it. It wasn't about the aqueducts. It was about giving you something. A project. It was about giving you the opportunity to design, to build, to be a part of this kingdom in a way you could
He wiggles, pressing his ass to Steve. He's not sure when Steve had turned him, rolled him and spooned up behind him to hold him in their doze, but he feels safe, protected here. Warm in Steve's arms.
saying the wrong thing. Again.
The worst part of all of it is that Steve is so fucking
+++++
Pepper is there, beaming at him, but she's not alone.
What if Tony can't satisfy him? He doesn't know what an Alpha likes – he knows what he's been taught to
Steve feels more nervous than he has in his life.
Steve snorts, then slaps his hand over his mouth to stifle the laugh. "Pretty much," he says, grinning with a shrug. "Is that… okay?"
"What?"
Wilson opens the third door, stepping back to allow Tony entry. "This is what we've got set up for your bedchamber, there's a full bath in the back. There are two other rooms in this hall, you can do what you like with them. If you'd rather, you could have Ms. Potts and Captain Rhodes move into them, even. But I assure you, we have a full security team and the halls are guarded day and night."
. There's no point treating me like…"
Steve can barely hold himself still. He moans, fingers clenched into the bedding, watching Tony devour his cock. It's gorgeous, and he wants to burn it into his mind to relive it over and over. Tony's pink lips stretch around Steve's girth, and he wonders what Tony's lips would look like stretched around his knot.
Tony glances down at himself as Steve closes the door behind them, noting the bruises from strong fingers and lovebites all over his chest and thighs. It makes him shiver a little, this evidence of his Alpha's pleasure. As much as he'd like a bath and some breakfast, he'd happily take another spin on his Alpha, too.
He doesn't even realize he's still hard until Steve's hand dips below the water and wraps around his cock, stroking him with strong, sure fingers. He's not moving fast, but his pace is even and confident, and Tony almost doesn't know what's happening and then he's coming, fast, his body shivering and clenching as he does. Steve's fingers move down, two pushing inside him, into his clenching hole, and it sets off an aftershock. Tony's hands grip the sides of the tub, his knees falling apart as Steve fucks into him with his fingers, rubbing at his prostate and making Tony cry out needily.
"I want you to have a good time," Steve says, lifting his free hand to stroke Tony's cheek. "I want you to feel good. I want you to feel good because of me, because of what I do for you. Do you understand?"
Clint blinks at them both. "Wanna clear it up for the guy in the room with multiple concussions?"
"Bruce has to
"That was…" Tony starts, then doesn't finish it. Steve doesn't need him to, though, so he just grins and crawls over Tony's body to kiss him.
It's not just because Tony is his bondmate, though that's part of it. It's not even that they're virtual strangers.
The entire Kingdom was aware of King Howard and Queen Maria's plight when it had come to producing an heir. Queen Maria had suffered miscarriage after miscarriage before she'd produced a successful live birth. The child had been a male Omega, much to the consternation of King Howard.
There hadn't been any kind of ceremony for their bonding, of course, but one of the terms of the contract Howard had signed on his behalf was that Tony and Lord Steven would have to consummate their bond during Tony's first heat after the signing.
"And we could take 'em," Bucky argues.
Tony does shudder, at the thought.
"Thank you so much, your grace," she says, injecting just enough sarcasm into her tone to make him smile.
"Oh, about the same," Tony says, but this time Steve can see he's not being entirely truthful.
She helps him shave off all his body hair and neaten up his goatee, using a basin of warmed water, then uses the rest of the hot water to fill the bathtub.
"May I present his highness, Prince Anthony Stark," Rhodes says, stepping to the side. "Prince Anthony, Lord Steven Rogers – your Alpha."
Tony doesn't say anything, but he rests his head back down on Steve's shoulder and snuggles closer.
"Sure," Tony says, swallowing what he
He supposes he'd never believed he'd actually be contracted to bond with an Alpha, that Howard would, at least, never force him to suffer
"It's – it's still Steve. If you want."
wanted to give him his own kingdom – which Steve hadn't even really
the weaponry to take on the Chitauri horde if they decide to come for us. King Howard
Tony arches an eyebrow behind him at his friends. If Steve had any intention of hurting him outside of knotting, he would have done so the evening they had dinner together. Rhodey looks put upon, but Pepper gives him an encouraging smile.
Wanda entered inside the room and she sat on the couch. Rhodey was making tea for both of them. When he finished, he sat in front of her and both of the cup on the table.
“Back on the ship. You collapsed from exhaustion.” answered Thanos petting his hair
“Asgard has been destroyed but what happens here?” asked Thor
“We will”
Ok i'm really lat again. I had the blank page syndrome and couldn't write a thing i'm really sorry.
“I will T’Challa, I’m sorry” bowed Thor slightly
“My specialist told me that you could do it and i really want to have it” simply answered Thanos
“Well you jumped in front of the gauntlet and you collapsed from the fear and exhaustion” replied Thanos back
“About?”
“I need you to take me to the border of Latvria without telling anyone” answered Peter with a smile full of secret
“Doom did what?” asked the man next to Charles getting furious
“I guess i am” laughed Vision as well “ Shuri made an exceptional work”
Charles smiled, his husband was the best thing that happened to him. After a moment, he left the room quickly and walked toward the training room where Logan was destroying things.
“Hey Clint” smiled Natasha hugging the archer
“Yes and he is very virulent about people who were behind Tony during the civil war” answered Rhodey again.
“Those kids could cause a diplomatic incident,” said Charles sighing.
“Well it’s true”
“Take the praise Shuri, you are absolutely amazing” smirked Peter
“Guys something happens, i can walk without Tony device” laughed Rhodey nervously, not trusting it
“Your spaceship for saving Tony’s life”  smiled Steve “ It’s time to move”
“My sister or I will kill Thanos” smirked Gamora
“The soul stone still in an unknown location” concluded T’challa
“And me” added Mantis
“Yes i agree with you, now i will show you something.” Shuri said “Follow me”
Tony was sitting around a table with Thanos and his children, they were having a dinner. Proxima was glaring at him, but well he didn’t care at all, he was the soul stone and she was weak. So he looked at her with a smirk.
Doom’s Castle Latvria
“Yes the stone would be mine soon. Well it’s over you can go to your activities”
“Let’s agree on a point,” finally said Stephen “ The news of Tony’s kidnapping must stay in this room, the rogues shouldn’t be aware of that or your team Rocket.”
“Indeed it’s an amazing result, here he would have wake up in one month maybe more.” replied T’Challa from his seat “ I believe we don’t need to plan a rescue mission.”
So sorry for the delay. I was far from home without internet. Yeah!
“Yes it’s nice” said Rhodey
“Please keep your mouth shut” said Tony bored and with a wave of his hand seal her mouth and trap her against the wall
Stephen sighed at the answer because he was sure that Peter and Shuri were on their way to Latveria. He really hoped that Peter and Shuri knew what were they doing. May looked at the guard surprised, Shuri was the name of the princess here and a very close friend to Peter. So it wasn’t to complicate to connect everything and May knew that her nephew was again on a mission to save Tony. She sighed at that, her kid was too reckless when Tony was involved
“Ah the other Peter.” smiled Peter Quill” Welcome in the cool team”
So his human life had a kid, that was too nice, and this kid was so cute. Ok that was weird, he was feeling protective of this kid too. Couldn’t be too bad. Well the magician guy was worth of the stone, and he was so hot and awesome. He could be his soulmate. Tony just laughed, earth was so funny. He will probably leave his invisible disguise soon, needed to see if the others people here were worth it. But not now, he needed to wait a bit, running away from Thanos too, well the titan was definitely not worthy even with 3 stones but well he needed to give him a chance, his neutral position was telling him to do this. But right now, he will stay on earth looking after the cute kid, that was strange, he had the urge to protect him at all cost. Even the magician seemed to do the same t. But well he was the soul stone so more protection for the cute kid named Peter and his kind of adoptive son.
Peter Quill was visiting the wakanda with Gamora. At first he was not happy about being on earth but after a moment he just kindled the beauty of this place. Gamora was just happy that his boyfriend was getting better every days. They will be able to defeat Thanos together. Peter was feeling better now because after his wake up , he wasn’t able to walk. But Gamora was with him every time and that was the most important
“ He took my friend” groaned Thor “ He took someone from me again”
“Stopping what” said a voice suddenly
“You are so cute “ said Gamora with a huge smile” What?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah, but you met Tony only a week ago, i’m kind of curious about why did you agreed? asked T’challa
“But that will not stop us of saving Tony” boomed Thor
Vision heard everything from where he was and decided to take the matter into his hands. Tony was his creator and if someone could save him easily it was him. He was done staying passive. He had unlocked his memories of JARVIS and wanted to help. So without making any noises, he fazed through the wall and began his flight toward Latveria.
“What did you do this?” groaned Steve scrubbing his arm
“We will too” answered everyone else
Tony smiled at the wizard, well this human was really interesting. The dinner will be really fun. Steve was still shocked. Strange was unbelievable, the stranger was dangerous and Strange asked him like this for dinner.
“Let him try” simply said Tony snapping his fingers and Loki was gone” Farewell my friend, and can’t wait to see you again.”
“Well you are not wrong”
“Well we need a plan, we can’t create a diplomatic incident as I previously said,” said Charles trying to calm the god
Peter smiled brightly at Thor, but Stephen looked at Thor’s hand, a jealous feeling was creeping into him. He knew that Tony saved Thor and they were close because they were avengers but he didn’t know that was that close. Stephen wasn’t afraid to say that he was jealous but that was clearly disturbing him, Tony and he weren’t even an item and he didn’t want to end up like Steve. Thor, unaware of the tension, simply put Tony’s hand in both of his hands and smiled sweetly at him. Pepper, even on the phone, didn’t miss anything of the exchange and smiled at herself. Strange sounded like a decent guy for her best friend, but he is still going to get the shovel talk if they actually end up together. She was hanging up with May when someone knocked at the door. Rhodey walked immediately toward it, opening the door.
“Wait Tony was kidnapped by the mad Titan?” asked Carol shocked
Thanks for the kudos and comments ^^
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony arrived inside his gold jail, taking the place of his clone quickly. He decided to sit on the chair next to the table, waiting for Thanos to come in. He was also wondering about this call. That was kind of weird, Thanos had never disrupted him during a healing sleep.
“Yeah, the smartest person I know” smiled Okoye before being interrupted
Doom raised an eyebrow at that, of course, he heard about the mad titan who wasn’t entirely wrong and Doom himself wanted to join him but now that he hurt Tony that was a totally different thing. Those pathetic heroes weren’t able to protect the only good thing in their team. And now they were trying to heal him with stupid things. Stephen was ready to fight, that Doom wasn’t trustworthy and he looked at Tony like he was a precious gem. Thor was more and more furious, that guy was a serious problem right now. Rhodey was highly annoyed seeing Doom again. The rest of the room was really confused about what was going on.
“Well now we just have to awake a dying star” said Eitri with a sigh
“What do you mean by that?” asked Bruce curious
“So what do you want?” asked Peter suspicion
“Of course”
“I was very concerned about Tony and decided to take the matter into my own hands but Doom seemed to protect Tony” answered the android sitting next to Peter
“Well Stark deserved whatever Clint said “ smiled Wanda already preparing her powers to strike.
“Yes i got the point but i’m so scared for him, i need to do something” replied Thor
“I needed to ask if someone found a way for saving my dear Tony?” asked Thor again.
“Wait, he is not supposed to be assign to residence” asked Sam surprised
“Sorry but I’m tired of seeing Tony being hurt” answered Erik sighing “ I just want to hide him from the world”
“He was in Team Cap during Civil War right?” asked Bruce to be sure
“I’m so going to kick his ass” replied Pepper before receiving a hug from Rhodey
“Strange, what’s happening inside,” asked Steve “Let me go inside, I want to see Tony”
“Because i said so” replied Rhodey” I don’t trust any of you near Tony”
“We are in the temple, be nice Groot or they will kick us out” smirked Rocket coming toward the bed, making people in the room laughed.
“Who is this guy?” asked Thor furious  standing up ready to fight
Stephen followed the conversation between Miss Potts and Peter. They looked close to each other and he didn’t that the CEO of Stark Industry was in a relationship with Peter’s aunt. He smiled sweetly at that, and in the back of his mind he was really happy that Tony and Miss Potts weren’t together. That was a real good news for him. Thor wasn’t paying attention to the conversations around him, he was asking help from the All-Father, asking to give strength to his dear Anthony and make him wake up. He couldn’t bear to lose someone close to him again. Thanos will pay and he will revenge his brother and his Anthony even if it would cost his  his own life.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah from earth, well i can respect your wish, i will return soon”  smirked Thanos.
And after that comment, all hell broke loose. And a huge explosion took place inside the room. Wanda had unleash her powers on the team in front of her, clearly wanting to hurt them. But suddenly a huge orange dome took place around Thor and the others protecting them and had aspired all the red magic.
“Wanda?” asked the person opening the door “ Why are you here?”
“Strange” said a voice suddenly
“Nice to meet you chef Louis” smiled Peter “ Could I have some blueberries pancakes if it’s possible of course”
“Thank you” smiled Peter before heading toward the corridor once again.
“We have a major situation, Tony had been kidnapped by Victor Von Doom” answered Peter” And we can’t attack his country because it’s protected by a bullshit decreet. So I need your help”
Thor was restless, walking back and forth. He was really worry for his Anthony, he knew that the doctor were doing the best. Bruce watched the god of Thunder. He could understand the state of Thor. The Hulk was really worried as well and was restless asking to see Tony. Natasha was watching the door, she couldn’t help but be worry for Tony and after everything that happened, she really wanted to settle everything with him. Clint was at the back watching the floor. Bucky was here too in the back, he was worried for Tony too and wanted to apologize for everything. Sam had a hand on his shoulder, comforting him.
“So our rescue plan was useless with you around” replied Rocket
“Well then suit yourself” smiled Shuri leaving the room
“ I’m not talking about Doom but Tony’s team, I want to murder mister perfect teeth and that damn bird” answered Logan stopping his carnage
Tony followed the titan, in a part of the ship that Tony had never explored before. He looked around him really curious. This part was really different from the rest of the ship. That was more cozy. Yes that was a weird term to use but that was true. The corridor had a huge carpet and the door didn’t look like a spaceship door, but more like a manor.
Thor was lost in his thought about his dear friend Anthony. That orange shield who was coming from him was definitely not from earth that was so powerful stopping the infinity gauntlet like this. It was almost like the soul stone but that a stupid thought mostly an hallucination from the pain., his man of iron was a pure terran.
“Clint is here” answered Rhodey “ And it’s a bad sign”
“In here” screamed Tony “ I’m inside this room”
Sky of Latveria
“My bedroom” 	answered Thanos
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry about that” replied Carol “ But i was really too worry for my friend”
“Good, so please refrain yourself when you don’t know Tony” concluded Strange looking at Edward
“Well you discussed a lot of that donut ship and it’s an amazing man” laughed Stephen with sparkling eyes”
“Your specialist is stupid, i can’t do this, i’m a fucking male for god’s sake” replied Tony still furious
“Well i found a nice planet to live named Sakaar and i will probably go through time and pick my love one”
“Ah you are really smart” laughed Carol “ Let’s head back inside.”
“I’m looking for the true culprit of the bombing who killed my family because I’m getting to understand that Stark wasn’t responsible and since you are his best friend, I think you can help me Mr.Rhodes,” said Wanda biting her lip worried about a negative answer
“Well not for long anymore, i will free you and come on Sakaar visiting you” laughed Tony
“ANTHONY” screamed Thor watching Thanos taking the man of Iron
“Not a surprise,” finally said Carol
Shuri made the plane land in a field and sat next to Peter who was getting ready in a very stealth suit made by herself. She was very proud of her work, the suit was perfect on Peter. As for Peter, he was really apprehensive of that mission, one mistake and a major diplomatic incident could happen.
“Stormbreaker is a fine weapon, it will help killing Thanos and saving my dear friend Anthony” smiled Thor throwing his weapon.
The next one is here
“Maybe” smirked Steve
Thanos was walking through the ship, looking for his precious little one. He looked inside his room and smiled, well he must be tired, even a soul stone needed his rest. He closed the door slowly not wanting to waking him up. Just after he decided to walk toward his own room, he deserved some rest too. And his conquest was approaching so he need his strength even if the heroes of earth were some minor enemies
“No we are waiting for Edward and Captain Marvel to come back” replied Okoye rolling his eyes
Clint fall in the floor, screaming for all the memories that Stephen sent to him. Steve ran toward Strange ready to strike, but Edward punched him back with his magic.  After a moment, the spell broke out and Clint stood on his feet quickly.
“The Hulk is restless and really want to smash Clint as well” added bruce
“I considered him my best friend” replied Thor “ I need to help him this, how he is precious for me”
“I’m Groot” answered Groot before coming closer to the bed as well.
Carol looked once more at Tony, asking for answer once more. Tony sighed and moved his head toward the door, asking her to follow him. They excused themself from the room and get out, walking toward a huge balcony.
“Well Rodey forbid you from entering and I can’t do a thing about that.” answered Stephen “ So please excuse me I need to bring this inside”
“Hey guys, did someone saw Vision here?” said T’Challa entering inside the room
“Very nice sweet rabbit” answered Thor, yes the rabbit gave him a new eye and that was working even if that was from a different color.
“Do you still have some powers?” asked Peter again
Doom’s Castle.
Peter recognized him instantly, he was in the same room as the great Wolverine who was really angry. That was purely amazing, he would have never imagined being in front of the Wolverine. However, he quickly changed into a frown when he remembered that Tony wasn’t here anymore again. Stephen was just choked by everything that was happening. First Tony who was gone, now two of the X-men and the well-known villain Magneto were here. That day couldn’t get weirder.
Tony was still wandering through space around the ship. He was thinking about everything special about why he didn’t change his name or taking again his designation again. But he liked Tony, just soul gem was a bit too frightening for the people around the universe. He really wanted to being able to travel around all the universe but it was impossible with the others two stones here. He sighed that was sad.
“So Peter, do you know the stranger?” asked Shuri after the game
Ok one month late, i'm so sorry about that but i was in Sweden for this time and i didn't have the time so i'm really sorry.
“You will be mine my precious gem.”
“I have a fascination with his brain” smiled Doom softly. “And here, he will just die because of your unadvanced medicine”
Tony leave the jail with a huge smile.Now his friend will be so happy, he totally deserved it. The chitauri looked at him weirdly, they never saw someone happy it seems. He stopped when he smelled a great fury within the ship. Look like Thanos discovered everything.
“Peter is perfectly fine, he is a guest of honour in Doom’s Castle” finally said May “Tony is not in danger”
“Someone useless?” asked Bruce lost
“Hey can i talk to you?” asked a voice suddenly
“He will”
Tony was back inside his room in the bed. The clone was gone for now. He would be really useful in the future of course. Tony smirked and fell in a resting trance. That was exhausting: taking care of a cute kid. He woke up later when he heard a huge noise coming from the middle of the ship. He quickly flew toward that. He found Thanos killing a bunch of chitauri.
After his phone call with his aunt, Peter decided to look for the kitchen. Doom had said that he was allowed to do anything he wanted and right now he was really hungry. He arrived in the kitchen after walking through a very long corridor. He opened the big door and stopped in awe, the kitchen was really huge and modern.
“You will take your words back” said Thor angrily” Or you will die by my hands”
“What happened here?” asked T’Challa raising an eyebrow
“He is not here anymore, Thanos took him, his name is Tony and i will save him” said Stephen with a fire look
“Ah your love” said Bucky with a smirk” He was really pretty when i saw him during the Civil War, well before beating him and leaving him in Siberia”
“And he is working damn well, lucky bastard” smirked Rocket
“Well not too difficult” smirked Tony
“Nice plan but if she is a mortal, you will need this” said Tony giving an apple from Idunn
They flew together toward the room, chatting and laughing. They reached it and landed it slowly next to Stephen. Everyone was looking at them with a wondering expression before that Rhodey ran toward the woman and kissed her on the lips
So sorry for the delay, i had to many works in university but i will try to update more
Fight lot of fight and angst i think
