It had been hours since Tony had stalked into his workshop and put it on lockdown. Steve had tried knocking, when that hadn't worked he asked Bruce to shout through the door. He’d begged Natasha to try-she’d refused,
Any further to the left and he’s going to hit his head on the fixture again. The acrid smell of chemicals hangs thick in the air and the shelves are lined with bleach and cleaning rags.
Steve sets his jaw maybe he was too presumptuous in thinking that he could ignore every snide remark. “He’s not a monster.” Tony’s making this personal, but then how could it be anything but. “He’s my friend.”
He gets up and Steve rushes to meet him, stopping short and not daring to touch in case he might break the spell.
just… just look at the Iron Man. I’m here Tony, just breathe with me.” Steve grabs for anything that’ll placate him, Tony is
“Ms. Romanoff is on her way, sir,” the AI pauses almost hesitantly, “with Mr. Wilson.” Tony eyebrows involuntarily raise at Steve who shrugs tucking his hands up under his elbows.
He loops his arms under Tony’s knees feeling his bare thighs quiver against his cheeks and under his touch, Steve’s hands finally settle on either side of Tony’s ass as he moves him into the position he wants with Tony’s legs resting on his shoulders. The angle’s better, but the sound’s muffled the usual mechanical hum of Tony’s workshop drowned out and all Steve can hear is the erratic breathing that comes from above and the slight creak from the workbench below every time Tony shifts or jerks unexpectedly.
looking at me like that. I hate it when you look at me like that.” Tony nostrils flare as he takes a step forward jabbing a finger in Steve’s direction.
“There’s something on the monitor.” He states, congratulating himself for dodging the potentially Freudian slip on answering Steve’s initial question.
he says, the heat from the bath making him hazy, watching Tony through eyes he’s barely keeping open, leaning into his hand like a cat that’s being scratched behind the ear; he hadn’t even realized he had a headache until Tony’s ministrations stopped it buzzing in his temples.
“S’Pepper.” He says looking up guiltily. He holds the phone in his hands like he can’t work the damn thing.
“It’s so I can do right by somebody else.” She ventured as they both stood staring at the headstone in silence. “How did
“Did your friend say which number it was?” Sam hovers behind her looking from one end of the corridor to the other.
Nobody’s going to hear him. Nobody comes to check on him anymore. Because it was always Steve’s job. Steve who drew him up by his wrists from his desk and let him fetch up against his chest.
His ears prick on instinct. “Hi Pep. I’m on my way t-“ Tony’s overly-chirpy-everything’s-fine-act is cut off by Pepper on the other end. He hears Tony stutter to get a word in. “Yeah, Bu-“
Tony’s skin felt exactly like it had in the dream, smooth and soft, but with a delicious give under Steve's fingertips, his control starts to slip the higher his hands go shaking with the anticipation over flinching muscles.
he’s pretty sure that if the penthouse had neighbors, they would need a cigarette about now. He’s glad they don’t have neighbors, Tony doesn’t want anyone to hear the Steve that curses like it’s the only vocabulary he knows, who begs and pleads – that’s a side of Steve Rogers reserved for only him.
has the generosity to trace a fingertip along the seam of Tony’s balls making him jolt and suck in air through his teeth;
She instinctively shrinks back wondering if he was going to fall for her beguiling, feigning innocents she clutches the phone to her chest and smiles, “Morning Steve, up early?”
He says and doesn’t finish, his whole body shaking in Steve’s arms when he seats him in his lap. His skin’s clammy to the touch and he’s so pliant,
, can’t think of one damn thing to say, he stands there stammering running a hand through his sweat-damp hair,
Steve says sensing the shift in mood that signaled the end of whatever they were trying to achieve here, “What are SHIELD files doing in a warehouse belonging to Howard?” He looks over at Tony whose expression is waxy and pale.
but if he does he knows it’s going to push him over the edge, ground him before he’s even had a chance to fly. It’s already
. That thing Steve feels that makes this so easy swirls in his chest and he can feel the warmth of Tony’s lips that are millimeters away, the heated body that was pressing against his, the friction of Tony standing that close-
He stays there until his skin is flushed pink from the heat and his fingertips have started to crease. The sun is well and truly up by the time he’s regained some semblance of control and ventured out into the common areas.
hands to the shoulders, push, done, over-finished-nothing getting out of hand. But Tony smells of scotch-he’s making a bad decision, Steve knows he’s no better for letting him do it; his blood rushes South and his hands won’t let go of Tony’s hips because he started something, and now his dick is straining in his pants and Tony’s giving him that rough,
Firstly apologies for how long this has taken to update (life has been incredibly busy), aannnd for the fact it is now 5 chapters long instead of 3! Whoops!
Steve’s back at the tower some two hours later than he planned, it’s nearly 3 am by the time he lets himself in, the front door comes into contact with one of Tony’s discarded shoes nudging it further into the room.
Waking up at 2 am had become such a common occurrence in Steve’s routine that it was almost a cliché. His dreams had been getting all mixed up, they used to just be about Bucky,
Steve could kiss her, Tony goes limp in his arms almost like the panic has drained the last of his energy.
Tony cut off with a protracted groan never quite finishing his sentence, Steve holds him through it as he squirms in his grip, his hips stuttering through his orgasm and coming down the back of his throat.
Steve asks, half joking half wanting an excuse to get his soapy hands all over him, “You not coming in?” He rests his chin on the edge and looks up, they’ll never both fit, the tubs big but it’s not
He feels himself losing control, the handle he had on whatever was telling him to savor every moment and take it slow slips and he bucks his hips up making Tony cry out.
“Nat, this is a mess,” he says without turning to look at her, “tell us who she is, you’re in good company.” Steve’s hand momentary squeezes against Tony’s chest, a gesture of calm that only he feels. He glances up at Steve his eyes the softest blue, cool and quiet grounding Tony in the way that only he could.
A small part of him that was still controlling the honest morals of Captain America stops him from shoving Tony back against the workbench. He’s still what Steve would
The hair pulling, it really shouldn’t do what it does for him, the tingles from his scalp jolting right down to his dick, if he wasn’t already on his knees they’d have buckled by now.
like he shouldn’t be touching. His whole body is lean muscle wrapped in a flimsy t-shirt and sweats, and he flinches, a soft moan escaping his parted lips. Steve’s hands wander lower to his hips and he uses them like handles, pushing and pulling in time with Tony’s careful measured movements.
Steve instinctively moves to hold Tony by both shoulders and his hands stop short hovering inches away. “Don’t
He comes back up when a hand brushes his knee, Tony’s sat back on his perch, one sleeve rolled up to his elbow, trailing his fingers in the water and smiling.
Steve can feel the tremors in his arm, sensitive ears can hear the frantic fluttering of his heartbeat.
Tony sidles closer, Steve’s hand that was gripping his elbow slides up his arm and circles muscles that flex on instinct, he lets go of Tony’s wrist; lets him move his hand up and down, flinching every time Tony rolls his foreskin back to the point where it's almost painful and the cold metal of his watch catches the bare skin of his stomach where his shirt’s come loose.
Tony’s waffling, he’s not even looking at Steve anymore. “They didn’t hurt anybody though, I’ve gotta get down there.” He turns and disappears before Steve can stop him.
Tony might have protested if he wasn’t so preoccupied, pushing Steve’s foreskin back exposing the oversensitive head that’s glistening and dewy, rubbing his own cock against it with his spare hand and sucking in a sharp breath at the contact. Steve’s knees could buckle, and his eyes are screwed shut when Tony works his skin over them. He not sure he ever agreed to this, the overwhelming feeling of being fused to Tony in such a way because that’s what it is - overwhelming. The slight stretch of his skin over Tony’s cock, the slick rub of their heads together, Tony’s hand that’s working him into a fervor. The calculated strokes along both of them, the complete contrast of the roughness of Tony’s palm that catches on the soft velour of his foreskin.
“Why do you have to be so perfect.” His voice has lost its silken flow and turned to a throaty rasp of lust, he growls in approval when tight walls clench around his finger; which quickly becomes two.
The scraunch of the service elevator grate draws his attention, the muttering that follows, echoing through the vast emptiness of the derelict warehouse that was the decided meeting place. It’s apt really and it suddenly occurs to Steve as he listens to the approaching footsteps, that Tony suggested it out of spite – some poetic representation of what they had become,
,” Tony sniffs dismissively but it’s not an outright denial so it’s the best Steve going to get. “I was desperate,
“And I haven’t heard from you in over twenty-four hours, comms weren’t dark on this one, you were supposed to call yesterday.”
they took it.” He gestures at his tablet with a clumsy hand that nearly knocks the tumbler flying. “This footage? Useless, all fuzzy black edges and a few useless security guards going down.” He flips the device up in his hands holding it closer than needed to Steve’s face, it shows a still, a dull black outline of a person, soft and blurred like when a camera catches movement. “Somebody is
“So, this is the place?” Sam looks up skyward to the dull apartment block sat atop the store in fifty shades of brown.
“Pepper….” Tony chirps, eyes darting to Steve as they trade awkward glances. “Me? I was… working out, couldn’t sleep, thought it would help.” Tony’s bringing his breathing under control as he shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot. He goes quiet and Steve can hear Pepper on the other end.
isn't like you,” Tony smirks, it sends a wave of shame through Steve’s whole body, he shifts his weight awkwardly, doing his best to pretend he wasn’t here to see if Tony would listen to him,
Steve shakes his head. “Can’t sleep?” He asks choosing to look down at the magnolia neutrality of the floor tiles instead of at Tony, because that rush, it will come again, the urge to hit him and kiss him all at the same time when he pulls one of his stupid stunts and leaves everybody who cares in the dark until his triumphant return.
So a bit more character development, world building, plot development etc... Not much smut (sorry! - Chapter 4 for sure! Which I hasten to add
” Steve struggles with the words, his hands restless with the need to touch brushing Tony’s then pulling at the fabric on his t-shirt.
“A little breezy to be taking telephone calls out on the fire escape Nat,” he points with his eyes, the rest of his face immovable and screwed up like scrap metal.
Steve should feel embarrassed, he’s got no idea what he’s about to do, but somewhere within the last ten minutes eagerness had overwritten inexperience and Steve’s body seemed only too willing to comply when Tony had essentially told him to
She waves for them to both come into the room she’s in. It’s light and airy with the same carpet as the hall and the same peeling wallpaper, but the large windows are all thrown open on their hinges and at this height, the air is clear from the pollution of the streets.
“Maybe not-” Tony stands, eyes tracing the ridges and planes of Steve’s body, “-but at a hundred bucks a bottle, it’s still gonna taste good,” his tone’s so light-hearted and easy that it makes Steve's chest hurt like it might burst, his cheeks already aching from the size of his smile. Tony gestures for him to get in the tub, like Steve would need any encouragement.
They taste as good as they look, nectarous and lush to the point that his jaw and throat ache for the flavor again. He must have been pulling a face or making a noise because Tony laughs and feeds him another. Touching it to Steve’s bottom lip before he moves it within his reach.
“Not all the time,” they both turn to look back at Ilona. She makes a ‘gimmie’ gesture for the photograph, “That’s not where they kept him, he was here,” she points to the cell disappearing out of shot. “This one-” she says tapping where the chains meet the floor, Natasha already knew what she was going to say, “-This one was
“Pepper, what would I do without you?” He says, jumping up from his desk and kissing her on the cheek as he skids out the workshop. “I have to find Steve.”
Tony says again, it’s like a dare, his voice shakily breathless, like he’s not in control anymore as he shoves a hand underneath the waistband of Steve’s shorts; and he knows anything Tony finds in there is going to tell him the opposite.
“You better be going in to apologize,” she says tucking a stack of envelopes underneath her arm. Steve winces, it made sense that she would know the whole story already, she was Tony’s confidant and closest friend, “Just to be clear. I’m doing this because I need him to get over whatever it is ASAP. Natasha and yours’ little stunt unearthed something else that requires his attention,” she glances up flashing Steve a tight half-smile as she taps keys in rapid succession. The access panel flashes green releasing the lock with a mechanical
He made his way back to the TV room relieved to see that Tony was still curled on the sofa where he had left him, only he’s nestled further into the warm spot that Steve had left behind with his hands tucked under his cheek, he shifts and groans in his sleep. And it shouldn’t,

“An old friend’s visiting,” Her face warms, then drops a little, “Paying her last respects to Coulson.” She says bowing her head at the somber note.
He can feel it building in pit of his stomach, making the back of his neck prickle and pulling the corners of his vision to a grey blur, his whole body feels like it’s about to explode and it pulses agonisingly close to tipping over the edge each time Steve hits the precious bundle of nerves that makes his balls jump up to his body.
Tony hands are hot through the cotton and the friction of the fabric grazing over taut skin is something else, it lights every nerve on fire, his hips rock forward.
Tony’s eyes flare with anger when they make deliberate contact with Steve’s who blinks back tears because this was the last thing he wanted. “And

They’re pressed together so close he can’t exactly hide what’s quivering in his pants. He tries to tell himself it’s a perfectly natural reaction to touch…
Tony’s staring down at the phone and gripping it in a white-knuckled fist, he looks up at Steve with the same wild expression he had in the kitchen. “Everything all right Tony?” He asks cautiously approaching with one hand out like he is taming a wild animal.
job Captain,” Tony smirks shoving his pants back on and stepping closer. Steve never ceasing to be amazed at his recovery time. He moves into Steve’s space, standing so close that Steve can see the slightly flushed gleam of his skin, can feel the graze of fabric against his own when Tony moves closer.
He curls, searching with the pads of each digit for the spot that’s going to make Steve jolt, and Tony’s reward when he finds it? Steve lets out a noise
he stresses, “then we call it a night. Got it?” Steve does his best to ignore his body screaming at him to finish what he started, he half wishes he’d suggested a cold shower before there’s any more detective work.
Tony sees Steve flinch at the mention, his hands momentarily balling to fists before they relax at his sides again. He grunts by way of response.
He must have been at least doing something right, it spurs him on. He moves faster ignoring the numbness that was creeping up his knees, keeping the pressure of his tongue just right and focusing on the heat from Tony’s hand on the back of his head that told him the rhythm to keep, a slight push when he wanted it faster, the hard yank at his hair followed by a groan when Steve did something he really liked.
But Tony knows. Tony remembers. The way Steve reacted to his touch that first time permanently etched into his brain. It had been
Tony says and Steve swallows dropping, not entirely sure why it feels so right. His kneecaps feel like rubber when they hit the hard metal tread plate on the workshop floor.
Tony’s shoulders stiffen under Steve’s gaze and he folds his arms, glancing once at the exit towards the direction of his workshop, a glance Steve doesn’t miss.
Steve swirls his tongue around the glands at the head of Tony’s cock, leaving it feeling sticky and tasting the distinct saltiness that wasn’t there when he started,
“What do you make of this?” Natasha passes a print to Sam, it’s high quality taken within the last ten years at least, “there are chains on the

Fourteen hundred hours. On the dot, Steve’s been standing there for the best part of half an hour, hands stuffed deep in his jacket pockets clenching and unclenching his fists, driving his nails into his palms. Swallowing doubt and nausea that he wasn’t coming.
He smirks. Steve glances down, past the equator, then back up before his whole body erupts in a blush.
He watches as Tony’s brow furrows and he starts to pace. Steve has no idea how he’s walking around, he’s still there dumbstruck and dazed against the kitchen counter because it’s the only thing holding him up. “Some files? Do we know what was in them? Right. Yeah, of course, it’s late. No. We’ll deal with it tomorrow.” He hangs up the phone without a goodbye.
she says. The picture, the one currently making Natasha’s stomach knot, is of the cells at the Hydra facility documented when the base was found empty and destroyed.
sloppy kisses and the sudden shock of cold of the arc reactor pressed against his too sensitive skin on his back. It makes him twitch and moan, he can’t think straight enough to decide whether it was a moan of pleasure or protest.
He ends up back in his workshop, seething and gulping scotch neat from the bottle, it stung that Steve would go to such an extream, he’d watched the recording one more time, just as a sadistic punishment for himself, it definitely wasn’t Steve or Natasha that slinked through the cabinets like smoke.
you were still pissed at me.” Tony throws his hands high and rolls his eyes, making a point of checking his watch. “Right, it’s ten minutes past two,
Natasha paused and stepped around to face her gripping her on both shoulders. Squeezing her until she looked up, a storm brewing in her wild eyes, “you wanted answers years ago.
Deft hands start to work the hidden zippers on the suit and Steve obligingly lifts and twists and lets it be peeled it off and chucked on his floor.
“She knew him…” There’s a pause Tony thinks he can hear Steve's breath quicken. “I’ve put a tracker on her,” Natasha says and it’s the first time Tony’s seen her look as guilty as hell.
Tony walks backward guiding Steve with him, the smirk still on his face watching Steve obey; he stops when his back hits the edge of a metal workbench; leans up like he might be going in for a kiss and Steve’s there ready, Tony never breaks eye contact as he runs his hand up the back of his neck, Steve’s stomach flips and he starts to feel hazy, but instead of the soft touch of lips, Tony yanks a handful of his hair,
just made me feel a little better about my crappy middle name, that’s all.” Natasha hears her snigger and she rolls her eyes.
“Well. I’m here.” Steve says nothing and tightens his grip on the nothing in his pocket. Tony’s words are bitten out and clipped short with precise anger, but they haven’t spoken face to face in what felt like forever and the sound of Tony’s voice strikes every nerve, brings them raw to the surface.
The pacing was doing little to placate his body, the softest glance of the fiction from walking alone was making him grind his teeth and his face flush with heat.
Steve isn’t sure whether to laugh or be terrified, he’s saved by his stomach letting out a monstrous growl, reminding him that he still hadn’t eaten that morning.
stood closer than two strangers waiting for a bus. When he felt weak he imagined that they embraced, and Steve got to inhale the coconut scent of Tony’s hair and the heady tang of his cologne, just like he used to.
It's close to 2 am when Steve is jolted awake by his subconscious; he’d been in that godforsaken valley, up to his knees in snow mixed with a mud slick, the more he struggled against it the further it pulled him down, soaking his uniform making it too heavy to move, making it feel like he was wading through setting tar. He could see Bucky lying motionless twenty yards away, he shouted until his voice was hoarse, taking step after arduous step that got him nowhere until the sharp ingress of icy wind in his lungs had him sitting up too fast, a mess of clammy skin against recirculated cool air and tangled in bedsheets.
Steve rolls over; every muscle is tenses, and movement is awkward when you’re this hard; Tony’s brought him to the brink
look while he rolls the stem of the glass between his thumb and forefinger. It makes Steve’s mouth go dry every-single-time.
candles, so many that Steve begins to wonder if Tony might have robbed a church on his way here. The light they emit is ambient and low, flames flickering off every shining surface, Steve feels like he could star gaze in his own bathroom; the tub’s full of water and bubbles and Tony’s sat at on the edge leaning on an upturned palm with that mischievous smile on his face watching Steve’s reactions. “What is all this?” He asks unable to hide fondness in his voice.
The delicate skin of Tony’s ankles, his tapered calves and lean thighs. The warm indent at his hip bones, the flat of his stomach and the soft downy hairs below his navel.
There’s that wave of nausea again, Tony breathes through it, ringing his hands until his palms are red and his knuckles are white. Holding back the tears, holding them back until he can’t anymore.
if there’s a chance I can find him then…” Steve’s voice breaks, and he trails off from the high pitched squeak holding back the lump in his throat. He thinks he sees Tony react the slight drop in tension from his shoulders and the flash of concern across the lines of his face that have been pulled tight, “I never meant for it to get in such a mess,
“He’s out there again…. The one I told you about, shall we find him before they do?” Ilona watches Natasha and Sam disappear into a yellow cab, then crouches to be at eye level with her creature. He rumbles and she reaches for the pendant she keeps around her neck, pulling it out from where it rested in the dip of her chest warmed by her skin. It’s a titanium surgical pin, about two inches in length and tapered to a blunt point, its surface polished and machine perfect as it reflects the light coming in from the open window.
His back twists to an arch when fingers plunge deeper than before sending a wave of ecstasy crashing over him and blanking his mind of any kind of lucid thought. Some aborted groan escapes his chest, he thinks he might come if Steve does
Gloves are pulled off with teeth and spat on the floor. The sound of each buckle that unclasps and every strap that comes loose is exaggerated in the silence of the half-lit bedroom.
Steve always finds it a little difficult to go from fighting all-out in the streets to the delicate dance of high-stakes socialization within the space of a couple hours. Thor only has one mode, which he deploys with gusto on the battlefield or in a ballroom, and Hank is terrible at social events even if he’s had all day to prepare for them. But Steve likes to think he’s not so bad at this sort of glad-handing meet-and-greet normally—he did an awful lot of it in the war, after all. And now he doesn’t even need to feel like a hypocrite:
gala is raising money for the Maria Stark Foundation, which will do a lot more good out in the world than war bonds ever did. It’s just that he’d like a bit more time to let the adrenaline burn out of his system first.
“Right.” Cap smiled at him, a brilliant flash of white teeth. “Do your thing, Iron Man. I’ll buy you all the time you need.”
Cap winced a little at the whine of the drill, but Tony was at least 80% sure any residual noise from the alarm would cover it. The more important thing was that he was also 80% sure he was drilling in towards a system hub that, when he could get close enough to physically jack himself into it, would let him override a bunch of the ship’s electrical controls, including the doors, engine, and basic steering.
He pries up another panel, gently shifting bundles of cabling out of the way, looking for the purplish ones. The sunlight is so strong in the cabin now that it’s almost getting hard to tell one color from the next. When he locates one, he starts to work it free of its neighbors, loosening cables so they hang outside the panel. Everything is sharp-edged: the sides of the panels, the stiff bands the Vog’ila use for their cable management, the cut ends of wire. At least he can still wear the gauntlets; otherwise his hands would be shredded by now.
He only realizes that Tony is maneuvering him when the backs of his knees hit the edge of his bed and he sits down with a hard
“Dunno. You do all right. Didn’t you pull me outta the path of an exploding centipede earlier today?”
The largest single piece of the suit is the chestplate. There’s no way to swap it out for something else; without it, the suit is useless as a controlled environment, useless as armor. Many of the other torso pieces attach to it directly, so without it much of the suit will be unwearable even if the other pieces are, separately, fine. Tony won’t be much good in a fight, and he’s forfeited his ability to exit the ship while they’re still outside a friendly atmosphere. Of course, if it comes to that, Cap won’t be in any better shape. Captain America is many things but ‘sealed against vacuum’ is not one of them.
Steve tucks down to finish his slide and pops up to his feet on the other side of the centipede. It clacks its mandibles angrily and heaves itself out of the building, legs flailing. Glass rains down everywhere. He just barely glimpses Iron Man out of the corner of his eye before he feels himself being lifted and pulled backwards by a strong grip across his chest.
, and there it is, trying to scale a skyscraper, back legs still scrabbling at the street and sidewalk; it’s already knocked over two of the postal relay boxes nearby. Several legs closer to the front are jammed into the first- and second-floor windows of the building that it’s attempting to climb. Iron Man and Wasp fly around it in a complicated pattern, trading off blasts. Thor is still rising, for some reason. Steve makes a quick assessment and vaults off a nearby parked car, building up some more speed. “Iron Man!”
“All right, all right. Eager soldier.” Tony presses two fingers into the knob of bone at the back of Steve’s neck, then draws them down Steve’s spine, all the way down. Steve shivers hard and spreads his legs a little, hopefully. Tony chuckles. “
The suit’s shock absorbers kicked in, automatically compensated for the gravitational pull, but once they stabilized and that sensation cleared he realized that he could still feel a hard drag-- the Extremis. “Uh oh.”
The click-click-click of the Vog’ila’s hooves as it moved into the hangar was unhurried. The bastard thing probably figured they didn’t have anywhere to go, so it wasn’t in any great rush. Tony zoomed in on a tiny panel on the side of the ship. Whatever the hull was made of didn’t do much to attenuate x-ray radiation—he wondered if maybe irradiation wasn’t a problem for the Vog’ila the way it was for humans; certainly any human-built space-faring vessel was going to have a shit ton of radiation shielding—so he was able to peer into the opaque surface at least a little distance to see the structures and conduits underneath. He very carefully replaced the bit on his finger with a smaller one, slapped some targeting sights onto his HUD, and started to drill through.
Steve can’t think. The day’s activities began with him getting thrown into a New York cab by a gigantic centipede, and he’s barely had a moment to sit down since then. The only thought in his head right now is how good Tony looks, and how good Tony smells, and how much better he would smell if Steve got his nose right up into the carefully tousled hair at Tony’s temple. He shouldn’t do that. There are very good and compelling reasons why he shouldn’t do that, but right now he just can’t think of what they might be. His eyes drift shut as he nuzzles the side of Tony’s head. His lips brush against Tony’s cheek in a way he can almost tell himself is accidental.
Tony wrinkles his nose in disapproval, but moves on to unbuttoning the rest of his shirt. “Do you want more than that? Do you want my mouth on you?”
Clearly Tony is not going to drop this until he gets some kind of answer. Steve looks down; taking his gaze momentarily off of Tony is the only way he can think clearly enough to form a complete sentence. “If you—you could. You could. If you wanted to, to… to do that. To me. I wouldn’t, uh. I wouldn’t be opposed.”
“Well, he made a similar sort of argument when I tried to push back. I don’t know what the final damage was, he wouldn’t show me a receipt, but I feel like I ought to apologize for it anyway.”
, though… well, I guess you need the super soldier shoulders to balance them out. Us mere mortals will have to make do with more modern tailoring.”
“I can assure you, you were very much present for it. In fact, I would say that you were integral to the entire process.” Tony’s tone is soothing, but there’s something in his voice that makes Steve think he’s suppressing laughter. He risks looking up over his fingers, and sure enough, Tony’s lips are twitching. “Cap. Steve. Winghead.” He pauses. “Can I say that? Can I call you Winghead when I’ve just had my dick squeezed half to death inside you?” Steve laughs and presses his other hand against his face too, flush burning all the way down to his collarbone. A damp thud indicates that Tony must have underhanded the ball of washcloths in the general direction of the bathroom. “Really,” Tony adds, “you have no cause for concern. I had a pretty spectacular time, and I have some reason to believe that you did too.” He gently takes Steve’s hands, pulling them away from his face. His smile gets bigger, brighter. “Losing track of things for a minute there is far from a bad thing. I’d consider it evidence that the sex was just
Three 10-foot-tall aliens armed to the teeth (did they even have teeth?) versus one Captain America armed with a single shield, and he’d fought them to a stalemate. Tony swung up into the hatch, holding onto the edge of the door with a gauntlet still hot from the welding. He felt like laughing hysterically. Why the fuck not? One squishy human in a homemade tin can and he’d hacked their stupid ship, under fire, why the hell
“Sorry it’s… it’s kinda gross. The sun dried it out some, though.” Cap waggles the remaining scrap of fabric sort of sheepishly. Tony realizes that he’s apologizing for putting a piece of his undershirt, which had been tight up against his sweating, heaving torso for who knows how many hours, on Tony’s head.
They came to a branch in the hall. “Left!” Tony gasped. When Cap didn’t respond, he took point; fine, Cap could cover his six if he wanted. A few steps down the left passageway he realized Cap probably couldn’t hear him, even with the comm-link. Nothing for it—the hall was too narrow for Cap to pass him now without stopping, turning the suit parallel to the walls, and letting Cap awkwardly scrape past him. They didn’t have time for that. It was probably better for Cap to bring up the rear anyway; they
s, a weary but fond smile on his face. He levers himself off the door and sways into Steve’s personal space, then runs his hands along both the broad satin lapels of Steve’s jacket. “This lovely little anachronism is to blame? I’d never believe it. It’s been fitted to you like a glove. And if somehow it’s not, I’ll be having
Steve almost flies off the bed, choking on a noise halfway between a gasp and a shout. Tony laughs delightedly and kisses him, swallowing the follow-up sounds that spill out of Steve as he starts to stroke.
Cap grabs the back of the nearest seat with one hand and braces the other on Tony’s hip. That’s just smart, because Tony won’t be able to fly the ship if he falls over. He can barely feel the warmth of Cap’s hand over the heat inside the ship.
Tony’s hips hitch, sinking him deeper. The slight tremor in his body, which Steve can feel against the sensitive skin of his inner thighs, spread wide to accommodate him, says that Tony is still holding himself back. “Ok?” Tony pants. “Relax. Relax. You feel amazing, fuck, but you gotta relax, ok, let me in.”
“Hey!—” he starts, but a half-second later Thor and his hammer come screaming out of the sky at a tremendously irresponsible speed, crackling with lightning, and the front third of the centipede explodes.
The metal—or metalloid, or whatever it was—scratched under the bit. Thank fuck. OK. Now he needed to locate the locking mechanism, or some portion of it. Hopefully there was a locking mechanism. If the door was friction-fit… well, maybe he could disrupt the seal by drilling at one edge? But a locking mechanism would be a faster way through. The door was smooth and featureless on their side, so no help on the visual landmark front. He ran his right gauntlet in a wide arc over it, listening to the ringing scrape of metal-on-metal.
Cap sprinted around the corner and ran down the row of ships, boots pounding the metallic decking. He had the shield on one arm and a broad grin on his face under the helmet. Two Vog’ila skittered into view behind him, honking and blatting urgently. One of them didn’t appear to be using all its legs, and the other was awkwardly cradling its weapon with only one forelimb.
Steve squeezes his eyes shut and turns his face back into the cradle of his folded arms. “Not a problem,” he says, muffled. “I haven’t been… it’s not a problem.”
The corny, heartfelt, Captain-America-has-your-back thing still caught him like a punch to the gut, even now. Great. He shook his head and turned his attention back to the ship.
“I still feel like I didn’t contribute all that I could,” he insists. Tony sighs, but Steve forges on. He may as well—it’s not as if his face can get much redder. “I’d like… if you were all right with it… I’d like another chance. To show that I can do more.”
how repulsor energy behaved, he’d never seen—the clatter of things-that-weren’t-hooves-but-he-was-calling-hooves-in-his-own-head-because-close-enough was getting louder by the second, there was no fucking
And it’s a fascinating problem, really. It’s been so long since he last saw any kind of math that didn’t make immediate and complete sense to him. He knows the Vog’ila are working with the same basics: their weapons and their ships don’t run on magic, so they aren’t violating any of the truths that Tony holds to be self-evident. The idea of really digging down into the data encoded in this ship is an enticing one. It’s so warm. His hands and feet are even warmer. He could just sink down into the math, let it flow into the waiting spaces in his brain, lose himself in it until it opens up for him and all becomes clear.
Cap laughs again. “More clothes, fewer clothes, jeez Tony. Make up your mind, you’re worse than a cat.”
Tony nudges Steve with the point of his elbow. “Once more unto the breach. Come on, Cap, I could use the back-up.”
heard Cap just fine, the helmet now locked in on the alarm frequency well enough to filter it most of the way out. “Yeah, fuck, here—” He slowed slightly, letting Cap run right up on him so that he was in an awkward half-crouch, almost plastered against the back of the suit. Tony twisted from the waist, flung one arm out and fired off a few blasts down the hall over the top of Cap’s head. He could just about hear a squeal and the chaotic thumping of something very tall, with a whole lot of limbs, hitting the walls and the floor.
“I’m just saying. With our luck, you’ll turn out to have super swimmers or something, and imagine the scandal if the paternity suit lawyers get their claws into you.”
Tony chewed on his lower lip, rapidly flipping between scans, trying to make sense of the systems he was seeing, the ways they interacted. “Probably not? Maybe a rental, once?”
He’s decided that the mysterious unit of measurement that keeps showing up on the map screen is referring to distance. He’s calling it a vogsec. He has absolutely no idea how it stacks up to feet or miles or AUs or parsecs, but he thinks, based on the scale of the map, that it’s closer to miles than anything else.
Steve and Wasp watch from a safe distance as Iron Man carefully approaches the enormous carcass. Wasp gasps when something erupts from the crater with a new spray of centipedal goo, and Iron Man makes a boot-jet-assisted hop that puts him a good twenty feet off the ground, but it’s only Thor standing up and shaking off his hammer.
“Believe in the scientific method,” Tony suggests, and drops a gauntleted finger down onto the control panel.
Steve’s brain informs him, unhelpfully, before apparently signing off. He’s suddenly kissing Tony, for real, and his grip tightens at Tony’s waist, probably wrinkling Tony’s jacket. He sinks his other hand into Tony’s hair, stiff with whatever Tony puts in there to style it, breaking apart to thick silky softness as he runs his fingers through it. Tony pushes his body up against Steve, hands falling from Steve’s face to deftly undo the bowtie that Steve is still wearing.
Tony and Jan don’t seem to be having any trouble, even though they were fighting just as hard as he was. It’s enough to make him wonder if the serum has something to do with it. Perhaps it makes his body hold onto adrenaline for longer, keeping him wired and ready for action.
He weighs the second plate in a gauntlet thoughtfully, then unhooks the pouch and walks back towards the bow.
Steve smiles sheepishly at him. “I went to your guy. He had me try a bunch of suits, but when I explained what I wanted, he told me that it was a custom job, and he’d have to bring in a specialty tailor for it. I said that sounded too expensive.”
Tony keeps two fingers pressing into the very base of Steve’s spine, stroking lightly over the flat planes of his back with the other hand, every so often encountering a tender spot, bruised from the fight earlier. It’s firm pressure and light touches and unpredictable little sparks of pain; the counterpointed sensations make it hard to focus on anything else. Somewhere in there is the click of a bottle cap, and then a finger is petting cold and wet against him, just stroking over his opening, back and forth, until Steve goes limp against the bed. Only then does Tony push, one smooth motion to get his finger in Steve up to the last knuckle. He gives Steve just a moment to adjust before he starts moving, fucking his finger in and out.
There are two emergency water pouches, one built into each thigh plate. They’re the termini of the suit’s water reclaimer system. He originally borrowed the concept from Dune, and it seemed like a good idea at the time, but even though he knows the water is perfectly good, and he’s used it in a pinch to wash out a wound or quench red-hot metal, he’s always been too grossed out to actually drink it.
He’s actually not entirely sure that the plate will stay wearable once he powers the reactor up. He’s trying to get close to 100% of the bundle attached, which is an awful lot of alien cabling. Since he doesn’t know what the exposed wiring is made of, he doesn’t know its conductivity, its resistance, what corrodes it, anything. There is a non-zero chance that the whole thing melts to slag after it’s been turned on for a minute or two.
“I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t an option,” Tony says reasonably. He removes his shirt and waistcoat together and gently tosses the bundle onto the chair with his jacket. Steve has seen the reactor before, but he’s never been able to look at it like
“I was the best man for the job and you know it,” Tony says, swallowing down the impulse to say any of the rest.
Anyway. Now the groupings of cables that he wants to connect are all set, and it’s too bright to comfortably sit up at the forward window, so Cap is sitting by Tony, leaning on the bulkhead that forms the opposite side of the passageway where Tony has pulled a bunch of cables out of the wall. Tony keeps his attention on the panel he has open and the cables he’s connecting to the reactor, eyes squinted against the light. He’s aware that Cap is silently and shirtlessly sweating behind him. Not a helpful thought.
“Not feeling all that pretty,” Cap says, sounding like he’s only reluctantly admitting it. “Mostly… sweaty.”
He twists another wire into place against the exposed metal casing of the reactor. Sweat drips down his forehead; he has to twitch his head back sharply to keep it from falling onto his work. He’d love to wipe it away, even though it’ll be replaced immediately with more, but his hands are buried in the chestplate and a mess of cables, and he hasn’t got any to spare.
“Just sit there and look pretty,” Tony mumbles distractedly, trying to cut through a band without damaging any of the cables around it. There’s a faint snort behind him. He rewinds what he just said. Eh. Hardly the worst thing he’s ever said to Cap.
“I rejoice to see you well, good Captain!” Thor booms. Squinting, Steve can just about make him out high in the sky, silhouetted against the late afternoon sun. He still can’t see the centipede, but he can hear it smashing into buildings and vehicles around the corner somewhere.
The control panel flickered off. A loud sighing noise indicated that the engines had died completely.
ship, now—and slapped the patch over the hole, broadened his beam a little to tack the edges down, holding the sacrificial strip against the beam to use it as the universe’s most make-shift welding wire, then focused the repulsor again and lowered the power to weld a continuous seam all the way around. No gas, so the weld was nothing short of hideous, probably not half as strong as it needed to be, but it was the best he could do and it would hold. It would just… it would just have to hold.
Right. Fuck. Tony fumbled for the compartment on his hip, got his biggest cutter bit out, flipped up the cap on the left gauntlet’s index finger and fit the bit into the little chuck there. If energy didn’t work, maybe a simple mechanical process would. “Please don’t be harder than tungsten carbide,” he muttered under his breath. “Please don’t be harder than tungsten carbide.”
… anywhere near me.” Wasp twists around, trying to see the back of her own suit. “I already got spattered when Thor hit it, and that’s burned
Cap is bare to the waist, with about 20 acres of pale smooth skin on display. He still has his uniform pants on, tragically, but he’s also still wearing his thick leather belt, which is not at all a bad look. As promised, his broad shoulders and many, many abs are streaked with shining lines and dapples of sweat. The rise and fall of his absurdly oversized pectorals is even more obvious than usual because he’s breathing a little heavy in the heat and jesus holy fuck Tony cannot be looking at this right now.
Cap had been up in the bow for a while, shouting back whenever Tony managed to connect a cable that caused something on the target screen to light up. If Tony is wrong about this—which is a possibility, he certainly does not read Vog’ilan writing—then they’re screwed. He doesn’t
Steve finally does roll his head to the side again, careful to not dislodge Tony’s hand. He squints up at Tony’s face. “Are you going to hurt me?”
“I guess it doesn’t matter, really,” Tony says, after a moment of silence. He rests a hand on the back of Steve’s head, then starts petting his hair, almost absently. “I get tested every doctor’s appointment, and I’m clean—there’s paperwork I could show you, which you should definitely insist on seeing—”
“I didn’t turn any fucking thing on. You can feel gravity because we’re caught in a new gravitational field. The biggest gravitational field going in this part of space.” Cap stared blankly at him. Tony flipped up the faceplate, holding out some vain hope that his expression would better convey to Cap the seriousness of the issue. “We’re falling towards the sun.”
He can hear Tony rattling around in his bathroom. Probably he should be worried about that, but he can’t work up the ability to worry about much of anything at the moment. He’s not tracking time very well. After a while Tony comes back. Steve turns his head to the side to look at him, but otherwise doesn’t move.
This stubborn son-of-a-bitch. Tony glares at him and his stupid, pointlessly self-sacrificing face. “Drink it, Cap. I’m dismantling the suit, remember. If you pass out from dehydration, I won’t be able to move your dense ass. I need you on your own two feet.”
Cap is kneeling directly behind him, stupid tactical pants straining at the seams over his thighs. He’s wringing a torn piece of fabric between his hands—his undershirt, or what’s left of it, anyway. The searing sunlight washes his coloring out and makes his sweat-covered chest and arms gleam like polished carved marble. His eyes look inhumanly blue, all iris, pupils shrunk down to pinpricks as they try to deal with the excess light input. His hair is damp, pushed straight back where he’s been running his hands through it; it should look darker, wet like that, but the light burns it into white-gold. The leather of his belt is soaked where the sweat from his waist has wetted it.
“Furtive fumblings in the tents and trenches, hm? The dark of night, a helping hand…” Tony trails off, smiling reassuringly. “It’s all right, Steve. I get it. But if it’s all the same to you, I
Tony leads him up the stairs to Steve’s own room. He waits patiently while Steve unlocks it, then follows inside, leaning back against the door to close it. For all that he still cuts a fine figure in his tuxedo, Tony must be exhausted by now too-- and in fact the smile that Tony directs at him is a rather tired one.
Subconsciously he must have pulled at them because there’s shuffling and movement, the hand disappears, Steve instinctively follows it lurching forward off the counter.
Steve doesn’t need to be told twice, he’s sitting up eye level with Tony and bringing him into a bruising kiss, one hand knotted in his hair and the other yanking down his shorts as far as his position will allow, they end up hooked on one ankle before he’s pushed back into the pillows by hands flat on his chest.
Tony shrugs his shoulders and rocks his head from side to side in a non-committal gesture working his jaw and swallowing his mammoth sized bite. “This wasn’t yours was it?” He says frowning and holding up what was left of the crust of the pizza, hip-checking the fridge door shut before wandering over to join Steve who’s picked a spot on the far side of the kitchen counter to lean.
Behind closed doors, it’s all clothes being ripped apart, muscles, sweat, bed sheets being destroyed and that one time they did it in Tony’s workshop and Steve put a dent in the metal bench.
Tony’s not watching his face, he’s watching his hand that jacking Steve off. A slight furrow in his brow and the way the tip of his tongue licks at his top lip says he’s up to something. His face is red, flushed all the way down to his neck, his skin’s burning hot when Steve lolls his head against his shoulder because he feels like he might go limp and come all over the vinyl floor if he doesn’t lean on something solid.
go South, they can be civil to each other. Steve will brush off every smirk, every snide comment. He can’t leave it the way it is.
, he got his hands on Tony’s bare skin, slid them right up under his t-shirt, grazed his nails along his ribs and felt the heat from his chest. He’d heard Tony’s breath stall in his chest; the shell of his ears catching all the sordid things Tony asked him to do.
There’s a hand splayed on the small of his back, Tony’s steadying himself and Steve notices for the first time how his breath is grating, and he feels a twinge of selfishness in his chest because all he’s done tonight it take; he quickly forgets all of it when Tony adjusts his angle. Steve tosses his head back and gasps, tries to speak against the sound of two bodies slapping against each other, the jangle of his tags and the repetitive creak of the bed.
, MY t-shirt.” He huffs but uses it to mop up the filth nonetheless. Steve laughs doing a half-roll/half-stand off the bed.
“Did you know-” Tony starts, picking a choice fruit for himself, never once taking his eyes off him, “-that strawberries are quite a
Tony must have nodded because Steve frees himself with a sigh of relief, lets them pool at his feet with the rest of his discarded costume.
He bites his lip until he can’t anymore, Tony’s coming undone in front of him and Steve’s whole body aches with need, the pressure already too much as it twists in his stomach.
There’s a cage, an enormous buzzing electric cage with something monstrous pacing inside. It draws up on its hind legs and thunders a menacing bellow of a roar. It ricochets off every metal surface. It makes a tiger sound like a kitten. A low snarling responds from the corner of the balcony. “Easy Reyna, He didn’t say anythin’ about your mama.” Dugan eyes his teammate as he emerges from the shadows, some eight-foot armoured Werewolf. He chuckles when Steve and Tony both jump and raises his eyebrows at the way Steve puts himself between Tony and the Warwolf. “Werewolves and Manticores don’t get along. Mind you Manticores an’ anything don’t seem to get along. Damn thing nearly took my arm clean off, dented my ever-lovin’ fedora too.” Dugan holds his hat up in dismay, takes one last drag on his cigar and flicks the stub into the cage below, much to the occupant’s disgust, sparks fly up as it throws itself at the bars. “Quit your whining! You’ve caused me enough trouble.”
Steve chokes on air when Tony catches his eye again deliberately letting his lips linger on the edge of his glass and raising one eyebrow. His suit's getting tighter for sure, he slides a finger under the collar in an attempt to loosen it and does his best to look attentive at what Fury was prattling about, pretending that he hadn’t
“Ha-ha, the mighty Captain America makes a funny.” Tony sulks, but clanks over to the window still in his armour and stands next to Steve. “OK, spying was my bad could we maybe not mention it again?
“Bottom drawer.” It’s as good a ‘yes’ as any, he props himself up on his elbows watching the muscles on Steve’s back ripple and flex whilst rummaging through his bedside cabinet. He’s leering and it’s shameful what just looking does for him.
But not him, come on, we’re meeting an old friend.” She gives Sam a ‘hurry up’ gesture and he glances once back at the stairwell below then back up at her.
Steve rakes a hand through his hair rifling through the papers he had hurriedly stashed in his desk,
He perches on the edge of his bed letting the last remnants of sleep ebb away, feeling the soft, plush carpet between his toes instead of the frozen soles of his boots.
He breaths against Steve’s throat watching him swallow and do something close to a nod. Tony shifts hovering over him whilst reaching for something in the nightstand; he’s relying on touch to find the small bottle that’s in there and Steve running his big hands
“Like what?” She clicks across the workshop floor in a pair of dangerous looking heels giving him a quizzical look, “You’re not answering your phone, I thought I would bring you the good news.
wear too much to bed,” Tony’s hand is gone from the tags, he leans up on his elbow, fingers sliding underneath the waistband of the last piece of clothing left between them, as if to back up his statement, Steve tingles at the overwhelming sensation of another’s touch on the taut skin just at the base of his cock.
” he steps directly in front of Steve, rolls his shoulder and braces like he’s about to catch a pass from a quarterback. “Okay. I’m ready, give me the lecture.” His lips quirk up at the ends, and Steve rubs the bridge of his nose.
his voice sounds strained but laced with amusement and he pushes back to release himself from Steve’s arms.
“JARVIS, please remind Steve he will be doing Tony’s laundry tomorrow.” He laughs before he’s silenced by a kiss, or two,
Tony clicks his tongue when he spots the chafing on Steve’s neck and traces it with a finger then goes up on his tiptoes and follows the same line with his lips. Steve hums in contentment, the soft cool cotton of Tony’s shirt that he only just feels against his skin, the warmth from the candle flames, the careful hands that push and pull him out of his uniform lifts the weight of responsibility from his shoulders, fools him into thinking that maybe, just for a moment he can shut the world out and be Steve,
He lifts and pushes at Tony’s hips in one smooth motion, sitting him up on the bench as he gives a weak protest and shifts, arching a little straighter at the sudden shock of metallic cold on his bare backside.
” Steve stands there unapologetically, feeling his chest swell and skin prickly everywhere Tony’s hands were on him, “Come on,” Tony gestures for him to follow as he disappears into the ensuite.
Had anybody of been watching it would have looked like a perfectly timed movie kiss. Captain America and Iron Man against a backdrop of the New York skyline whilst fireworks explode overhead- they don’t have anything on the fireworks that go off in Steve’s brain when they pull apart and Tony utters one-breathless-word-
… It was just an old dusty warehouse; low risk but it still had cameras.” Steve hears the call end and guiltily steps into view.
Steve leans to grab a fruit only to have Tony jerk the plate away. “What makes you think you’re getting any?
Steve subconsciously braces every muscle in his body, stretches up to his full height. “That’s not fair. I never-“
Steve not sure he’s found the right rhythm; he starts off slow once he gets the hang of not gagging. Flattening his tongue against the underside and pressing the tip along the vein that he can feel Tony’s rising pulse through. Tony shudders and goes tense and Steve starts to pull all the way back until his lips only just cover the head. He feels Tony grab him by his hair and hold him where he is in a mild rushed panic,
He can hear it in his head, he can also hear Tony panting in his ear, spliced with the pop and suck every time he draws back from his skin. So, what comes out is some guttural grunt as his head lolls to the side offering more.
Sam twists it this way and that, scratches his head, looks at the lettering on the manilla file and asks, “How did you get this?”
I’m still following up on all the people who Obadiah supplied Stark weaponry to when everybody thought I was dead in the desert.
“Tony, you disappeared. Nick Fury nearly cast a kitten! You turned off comms, sensors, you didn’t tell Pepper where you were going, she nearly bit her nails back to the knuckles for crying out loud! I was left holding the bag when we couldn’t find you!

isn’t helping his balance; he falters when they slide up his thighs and he’s chest to chest with his lover. The small sliver of iris that’s visible against his dilated pupils is an incandescent blue in the moonlight. “I found it.” He says breathless holding up the bottle and flushing with heat, feeling foolish that all it takes is looking into Steve’s eyes to make him swoon and

Steve blinks up at him. “Where have they all been?” He asks, already guessing Tony had something to do with it.
Natasha’s long gone and he’s relieved, guilty and a little bit empty to find that Tony is nowhere to be seen.
“Besides, I have something that belongs to him,” she strikes the pin on the edge of the desk closing one eye and tilting her head to the side to catch the frequency it resonates at. Skippy twitches his large elongated ears and does the same.
Tony panics and rushes over to where Steve has retreated looking like he’s about to bolt. “It’s just… I can’t
Steve kept finding his bed too big, his hands too empty and the nights too cold and lonely, he misses all the times he has woken to Tony curled against his back,
Tony falls asleep half splayed across Steve’s chest, his head resting over where the metronomic thud of Steve’s heart keeps perfect rhythm, with one of Steve’s arms wrapping his shoulder.
you in public?” He doesn’t even let Steve answer before he’s stretched up pulled him by his neck and stuck his tongue in his throat.
now and left him leaking all over himself. He manages to get up on all fours vaguely aware of Tony planting his hands on either hip, apparently, he’s done with the gentle caresses and kisses. He doesn’t have time to brace himself on arms that were already shaking before Tony’s in.
The ex-special ops agent’s current status, marked with an enormous red flag- DECEASED KILLED IN ACTION.
And maybe it was the alcohol, maybe it was the thrill of it all but Tony sits unabashed, with his cock jutting shamelessly out into the space between them smirking down at Steve on his knees who vaguely remembers something about ‘covering your teeth’ before he licks his lips and takes Tony’s cock all the way down his throat on his first attempt.
Tony ruts against him, grinding with his hips as he bends to kiss and lick at Steve’s bare chest; tracing the outline of his muscles with his tongue; every kiss, touch, earning him grunts and groans from the man beneath him who bucks to meet him with each thrust. Steve’s large hands are on his waist, stroking over his back and down his thighs.
the teasing hem of the Guns ‘n’ Roses t-shirt he had on stopped mid-way down his thigh, the folds of it caught awkwardly at his crotch. Steve shuffles forward until he was close enough to run his hands from the back of Tony’s knees, up his thighs to where he can lift his shirt.
It didn’t stop Steve feeling a little hurt that Tony hadn’t come to him for help, he thought after New York…. Well, he’s not sure what he thought.
” Tony says closing the gap between them and looping his arms around Steve’s waist to pull their hips together, “-see
-it’s the possessive side of him that he’s never been proud of. He chokes on a gasp and catches Tony’s elbows in each hand when he strokes the outlined shape of his cock through his shorts.

The gate to the cemetery creaked on old hinges when she pushed it open; eyeing the suspicious shadows flickering unnaturally under the arcing willow that’s tendril-like branches brushed the manicured turf.
“Hey, Tony.” Tony was halfway through a comically large slice of leftover pizza. “How’ve you been?” Steve says crossing the kitchen and shooting him a tired sideward glance. The stone tiles cool and smooth beneath his bare feet are his focus, not the sudden rush of excitement mixed with trepidation that soaks his spine and settles into a tingling warmth at the base.
not that Steve cares because Tony’s sliding his hands under his jacket, pulling it off his shoulders, he’s got fingertips that feel like they’re everywhere when they coast over the thin cotton of his shirt. They linger over his nipples that have gone as hard as bullets from Tony’s touch.
“What? Oh, s’you,” Tony blocks his way folding his arms across himself, tucking his hands up into his armpits and tensing his shoulders, “What d’you want?” he says to the floor, the way his words blurred to one gave him away, so did the smell of alcohol on his breath, you didn’t need super senses to pick that up.
He sets it back down, his lips shining under the bright fluorescents. “You wanna go to bed willingly, or should I drag you kicking and screaming?” Steve says, folding his arms and watching Tony’s huff like a petulant child.
Tony’s still up orbiting blissful oblivion when Steve pulls out and drops heavily beside him on the bed, “Hi.” He breaths looking at Tony through half-lidded eyes hazy with contentment.
,” Cap says, and he was already a little pink in the cheeks from the heat, but Tony is willing to bet that if he looks back again, Cap will have gone bright red.
. But once he worked out how to pry up the paneling, it’s easy enough to pull each section, make a very crude splice, feed in a little power from the suit, and watch what lights up. Not complicated. Just time-consuming.
“OK, that one’s bad, even for you,” Steve laughs. His face is still hot, but amusement defuses the situation at least a little, and he needs all the help he can get. Tony can flirt with anyone and anything, in any situation, and the interaction will barely leave a ripple on the surface of his composure, but Steve has never quite managed that trick.
a picture,” Tony says. He smooths a hand over Steve’s ass, just skimming the curve until his palm slips into the hollow of Steve’s lower back, where he applies harder pressure, almost as though he’s testing what it looks like, pressing Steve into the bed like that. Steve sighs and tugs a pillow towards himself, folding his arms on top and burying his face in them. His back arches under the pressure of Tony’s hand, and it must look obscene, like he’s begging for it, but it feels so good—absurdly good, good like nothing has felt in longer than he cares to remember—that he can’t muster up any objection.
“OK.” Cap said it like he wasn’t upset, but he looked a little pale under the helmet. He didn’t get seasick, so far as Tony knew, and he’d patiently submitted to any number of Tony’s high-speed flight maneuvers in the past, but he wasn’t sure if Cap had ever really been in zero-G for more than a second or two while strapped into the Quinjet. If it turned out he got spacesick… well, there wasn’t anything to be done, but it would probably get unpleasant.
The clattering stops, replaced briefly by the sound of running water, and then Tony reappears, a variety of damp and dry cloths draped over one arm like a butler. A nude butler. Steve grins at the sight. Tony shakes his head at him, smiling. “Well. Don’t
“We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.” Tony smiles—not his million-watt PR smile, but the smaller, warmer one he uses sometimes around the team. “I mean that. We could call it a night right here. Or we can do just what we’ve been doing—we can go on having a nice time without anything else coming off. Or—” He pauses and thumbs open the top button of his own waistcoat, looking Steve right in the eyes—“well, or everything else is on the table, so to speak. This can go as far as you’re comfortable with it going.”
fuck. A joy in the sack. A feast for the eyes and a banquet under the hand. Full credit for teamwork.” He’s still smiling, but his voice goes briefly rougher again. “I’d have you in that suit every night just for the pleasure of peeling you out of it.”
Cap glanced at him, a tortured expression on his face. He so obviously wanted to run out and fight, but he was battling with his innate desire to coddle a baseline teammate. Even though Tony wasn’t technically baseline any more. Even though anyone in their line of work basically gave up all right to or expectation of coddling. They’d been down this road a million times before; it was one of the many things they’d fought over that led to the current state of Tony-sans-Avengers and Avengers-sans-Tony. There was a Vog’ila clattering down the rows of ships towards them, though, so: not the time. “Go, hit them all you want, don’t be a hero, just get me enough time to figure this out.”
Steve bites down on one of his forearms. It’s been too long. It’s too much, he’s going to split apart, he can’t do this. A hand slides up to the space between his shoulder blades, rubs firm circles there. “Breathe,” Tony says. Steve takes a shuddering, unsteady breath. “There you go. Come on. In and out, nice and easy.”
The giant centipede’s legs punch perfectly circular, conically-tapered holes straight through the asphalt, each one about as big around as his shield. Their rims are smoking slightly. Hank, watching the monitors from the Mansion, is having fits over the comms about getting a sample of the acid on its legs, but Steve is heartened to note that most of the team seems to be ignoring him. Iron Man and Wasp are bantering freely. Thor is insulting the centipede’s parentage. And Steve is blocks away, running to catch up, because he’d had the rotten luck to get thrown by the centipede’s whipping back end, and the fight moved on while he was catching his breath and extricating himself from the mangled cab that he’d landed on. It sounds like things haven’t gotten completely out of control yet, but all the same, he’ll feel better once he’s back with the rest of the team. The whole thing is already a little embarrassing. Luckily, all he has to do is follow the holes, and eventually he’ll find the battle.
Tony shakes his head. “I could go back to my room to get some, but I really can’t abide the thought of running into one of the others in the hall right now—or, god forbid, Jarvis. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but no, I guess we’re going without. I am definitely buying you a huge box after this, though, so you’re ready for the next person who comes around. You can’t just take people on their say-so these days, and even if a woman is on birth control, no birth control is 100% effective.”
“But I didn’t even… Did you—did you, um.” He blushes harder. Tony raises an eyebrow, but waits patiently. “Finish?”
“Oh, but discussing fashion at a gala is very classy. Practically tradition, really.” Tony leans back against the counter and smooths a hand down the front of his waistcoat, ostentatiously luxuriating in the feel of the embroidered design. He stops just above his belt buckle, which draws Steve’s eyes there entirely without his input. Tony’s tanned hand stands out beautifully against the snowy white fabric. “You know, the only real problem with modern suiting trends is the fact that the pants are tailored so close, sometimes it can be difficult to get out of them. It’s much easier if you have some
Even Captain Hates the Cold is feeling it. Cap has his helmet off, along with his jacket and undershirt, the removed pieces of his uniform folded up neatly on the floor on top of his shield, because of course even when they’re falling into a literal sun Cap is a good little soldier. Tony has just been shedding suit parts wherever he happens to be when they become too much to bear. He’s down to the boots, the gauntlets, a white tank top that has seen better days, and the tight undersuit leggings, black with fine gold tracings of embedded circuitry. Cap has definitely seen him in worse; being caught out in the world’s most expensive yoga pants paired with a shop tank doesn’t even rate.
know,” Tony says, smiling ruefully again. “I think I’ve been wearing suits since I was three or so. About as soon as they could get me into dress shoes and be reasonably certain I wouldn’t fall over, anyway.”
He shakes his head, which serves the dual purpose of dismissing Cap and telling the helmet that it’s on active duty again. All the HUDs come online at once before sorting out to his usual home settings, most of the others sinking away into nested tabs at the edges of his visual field. This all takes place against a white background, but in the moment it takes for the HUDs to go through start-up, the helmet’s lenses auto-polarize, and he can actually
luck, luck inflected by the presence of his immense genius. Still. Still. “I’m just saying, this ain’t exactly jump-starting your mom’s Toyota Corolla.”
he upped the power, shot the door again. The beam splashed and dissipated again. There was maybe a slight discoloration to show where it had impacted the door, that was all. Holy fuck. Whatever that material was, it had some kind of energy deflection properties, he’d never seen anything even remotely like it, he could be looking at a brand-new element here—
“Yes, great, thanks, hilarious.” Tony shoots him a poisonous look. “I’m in the middle of escaping from a hostile alien planet in a stolen spaceship and now I’m going to die a horrible death with Captain America making bad jokes at me. I know I’ve lived a life of sin, but you could cut me a
“Hold out that hammer, will you?” Iron Man asks, still hovering. Thor extends the arm holding Mjolnir obligingly. Iron Man flies close enough to reach out with the opened vial and catch some of the goo dripping off the hammer. He settles back in the air and stoppers the vial with a flourish. “Great. All set. Now let’s get home before Thor ends up naked on the street.”
“Fantastic.” Tony steps back and starts unbuttoning his waistcoat in earnest. “Do you want there to be mutual touching?”
Gravity hauled at him as the ship struggled to pull away from the base, burning through the atmosphere. He was flying it half on instinct, half on wild assumptions and semi-educated guesses, but it was working well enough to get them the fuck away from this planet. Hopefully his shitty weld was holding, although he assumed they would rapidly and explosively decompress if it failed, so it wasn’t like he’d have any warning if it was going to be a problem. Not worth the energy to worry about it. (He worried about it anyway.)
“No? Too bad, I think you could learn a lot about contemporary trends in suiting by really getting a
Steve’s whole world narrows down to the sensations that Tony is wringing out of him. He can’t think beyond the heat that Tony is driving into his core, the need to move within Tony’s sure grip. Everything ratchets tighter, hotter. He gasps for breath, mouth open against his forearm. Tony adds a little twist to his wrist, the gel making obscene wet noises as he squeezes around Steve.
, it was obvious that they’d been seen, and in fact a moment later heavy rounds tore through a ship one row in front of them. Tony ducked and swore, trying to keep from jostling the gauntlet he had jammed into the side of the ship. Everything would have been 10,000 times easier if he could have interfaced directly by way of the Extremis, but whatever systems the Vog’ila had going on, they weren’t talking to him. There was code and programming there, but it was barely recognizable as such, and he had no chance of learning the language, syntax, or even the basic underlying logic of it under these particular circumstances.
throw it, but it probably wasn’t coming back if he did, the dimensions of the space were all wrong for ricochet return angles. Losing the shield wasn’t a good outcome.
“So you have this, which I guess you use for its intended medicinal purposes.” Tony hefts Steve’s bottle of clear aloe, which he does in fact use for scrapes and burns. “It’ll do, although really, there are better products out there, I’ll make you a list. But unless you’re hiding them very, very well, there’s not a condom to be seen in this suite, which I have to admit is a little concerning.”
Three Vog’ila were in the hangar, carefully picking their way around the room. Tony kept the suit pressed up as close to the curve of the hull as possible, and Cap stayed as close to his side as he could without getting in the way. The Vog’ila were making noise continuously—trills and low burbling sounds—but when one gave a single, loud
He can’t quite tell what the cables are made of, but there is for sure something insulating on the outside and something conductive on the inside, so for now he’s assuming he knows enough to at least attempt to work with them. There are groups of cables bundled together in what looks like a pretty rigorous form of cable management, and the cables are definitely color-coded. He just doesn’t know what any of the groupings or colors
“Oh, give it here,” Iron Man sighs, staticky through the helmet’s filters. He holds a gauntlet out to the Wasp, who hesitates, then pulls a small vial from a pouch on her belt and hands it over.
And it wasn’t even a lie, because he turned to the next ship over and focused one palm repulsor to a tight-beam emission, lasered out a ragged oval of hull-stuff, followed by a sacrificial strip of the same, practically in the same move spun back to the ship—
He turns back to the panel with renewed determination. Nobody who looks like that should die of incineration in an alien star with only Tony Stark for company, it’s just not right. He’s got a solemn duty to the universe to preserve this person, ideally in a shirtless state. He cuts one more quick look back over his shoulder. For inspiration and all that. “Sweaty’s a good look, you know, some people pay money for that. I’ve been reliably informed there are entire websites dedicated to versions of the look you’ve got going on right now.”
There are three front doors lined up like ignition coils to choose from each one looking about as derelict as the next, “That part she left out…” Natasha reaches for the flip phone in her pocket. Her hand freezes and Sam’s eyes go wide when the air shifts and goes heavy, vibrations rumble through the floor beneath their feet, like a distant engine firing up and a voice echoes around seemingly coming from nowhere and everywhere all at once.
“A little breezy to be taking telephone calls out on the fire escape Nat,” he points with his eyes, the rest of his face immovable and screwed up like scrap metal.
But that noise the rough-gravelly sound pitches straight to the recesses of Steve's brain that was still churning over the event in the kitchen and throws it back into sharp focus, when Tony’s rough fingertips had been pressing against the vein that ran along the underside of his cock and he’d been rubbing himself off against Steve’s thigh.
The bedroom smells faintly of cologne, the closer his proximity to the bed the more it teases his senses luring him in. He can make out Tony’s sleeping form in the scant light spread out and taking up the entire bed. Steve is
It doesn’t even occur to Steve as he crosses the quinjet bay in the darkness that he hasn’t seen another soul for at least an hour. He tugs at his collar and shakes out his thigh, the worst of the humidity-induced chafing concentrated at the neck and the inseam of his pants,
“What? Tony, listen there’s something important I need to tell you. The team that was cataloging the files found something… something important…
,” he pauses to stop his voice cracking, “Then I find my best friend growing up is still alive, and…
His shirt ends up on the bathroom floor and Steve pushes him back to the bedroom where the candles are burning low, never once breaking the kiss, he works the stiff fabric of his pants loose letting them pool at Tony’s ankles immediately going back to strip him of his shorts.
“What was so important you couldn’t tell me over the phone?” His eyes settle on Steve’s for a fleeting moment before snapping to his feet. Steve shifts, restless in his own body, this was harder than he had ever pictured in his head.
“So?” Steve yawns and stretches making every muscle flex and ripple under his too-tight shirt. Tony coughs, does his best impression of nonchalance but steals a glance anyway.
would be able to pick up on Steve’s ill attempt at hiding that he was as keyed up as a dog on heat that had been fed viagra.
“Steve.” Tony does a shout-whisper, nothing, he doesn’t even stir. “Steeeve.” He tries again, leaning over the sleeping blond and pawing at his shoulder. He rolls onto his side and clumsily swats Tony’s hand away.
Tony goes quiet, dropping his shoulders and leaning on an upturned palm. He draws a pattern on the worktop from the condensation of his glass muttering, “Because you’re so perfect,” and pulling a face.
and exactly what Steve wants. Every moan gets swallowed and every curse word bitten off. He pushes harder, faster deeper knowing Tony’s body so well and the angle he needs to hit that precious bundle of nerves deep inside.
Tony’s kissing and sucking at the skin behind his ear leaving it damp and alive to the feeling of his deliberate exhale that blows cool air across his hairline, his body arches; an involuntary reflex, a desperate, silent plea for more.
answer, everything about this situation should not be turning him on this much-but everything about it feels so forbidden. The location, (OK not ideal, but hey who’s around to judge?) the danger of being caught, because it’s
than Steve ordering him to drop his armour, he would have protested, lectured them about how it needs to be stored correctly and given the respect it deserved because it was
Natasha watched her stuff her hands into the kangaroo pocket and scuff worn shoes on the grass. “You look…” She sighed taking in the twitching and eyes that darted around restlessly, the shoulders that drew up around her ears, the slight stoop in her posture in an effort to make herself smaller. Standing at least five foot eight she’d always had an inch or two on Natasha. “How’ve you been?” She eventually settled on.
The water’s perfect, soft like it’s had salt added and warm against his skin, he sighs finding himself shutting his eyes again and sinking beneath the surface with his weight cradled, his muscles letting go of tension he didn’t even realize he was holding onto.
JARVIS wouldn’t even tell us where you were..” Steve rakes a hand through his hair. Pent-up anger mixed with a dozen other emotions he’s too drained to place boils just underneath his skin, He hadn’t meant to raise his voice. Tony looks back at him bewildered and blank. Steve meets his eyes for the first time. Softening his tone to reluctant exasperation.
“I was-” Tony tilts his jaw up and nibbles his lip thoughtfully looking for the right excuse that’s going to pull Steve away, if only he
The hands that are holding him up slide in the sweat against his skin and it’s too much, the way Steve’s biting his bottom lip with his eyes screwed shut, the way his whole-body rocks with each push, the way he cuts off Tony’s groans by bottoming out and knocking the air from his lungs.
“It’s not going to get me drunk,” He smiles, letting his eyes slide closed at Tony’s fingertips running down his thighs then back up the inside trailing along the red skin in the crease of his groin where his pants had been chafing. Steve jolts at the touch, almost sloshing champagne onto the bathroom floor, but he lets Tony have his way.
“Steve,” he wheezes growing impatient for an answer he rattles the handle not really thinking it through, the door unexpectedly gives and he stumbles into Steve room.
Tony’s slick lips are sliding down his shaft and Steve’s groaning, barely registering it’s himself making such an indecent noise; the bed creaks under his weight as he arches his back to stop his hips thrusting forward and fucking Tony’s mouth. His tongue feels like it everywhere swirling over his glands before sliding down claiming every inch of his unrestrained erection.
He knows the looks he’ll get if he goes upstairs. Two-day-old t-shirt, snot of the sleeve and ominous vomit splatter down the front adding to the menagerie of stains, jeans that are falling past his hips because eating didn’t seem all that important anymore. It’ll be the pitying look of ‘poor Tony, betrayed by his friend
Going with the idea that Steve hasn't worked out Bucky killed Tony's parents yet, just in case there was any confusion. Enjoy guys! :)
He snorts awake his eyes flying open and startling Steve whose still leaning over him and narrowly misses being clocked in the jaw when Tony sits upright scrubbing a hand over his face and wiping the drool off his cheek.
Then everything goes eerily quiet, the back of Steve’s neck prickles and he hears Tony draw in a long steady breath. “Do they know who it was?” There’s a pause when Pepper answers. “Was anybody hurt? No?
don’t want to find out.” She watched her shuffle a few steps and stop in front of a newly positioned headstone of polished black marble and gold inlay.
“The only way out of SHIELD was in a body bag, Tony. She went into hiding years ago… It got complicated,”
or waking up alone in the TV room with a stinking hangover having been ditched after said incident. His memory of it was, a
He moves the plate back into Steve’s reach, leaning in to kiss him soft and sweet, “well, you’ve got me there… I really do.”
Tony Stark never learned how to cry with style. No blown glassy eyes with a lone tear rolling down his cheek.
Tony gasps, Steve trusts upwards in lieu of a response and watches the air get knocked from his lungs and his cock that’s trapped between them pulse and glisten at the tip.
Only to have it lost in his throat. It has him waking up at 2 am, like clockwork, downing the water that’s on his sideboard and wondering what it all meant. The whole Bucky/Winter Soldier situation was still raw, and he
It’s a minute or two before Steve releases the vice-like grip he’s got Tony in and lets him sag against his chest before he unsteadily takes his own weight again.
Natasha follows Sam’s gaze. The whole place is oppressive, looming over them and cutting a solid block out of the horizon. Unnecessarily complicated and messy electrical cables span the whole length of the street hanging overhead like mesh wire that’s going to fall down on top of them. Natasha sees him shudder and stuff his hands into his pockets. “This is the place.”
They don’t know he’s lost a lover; nobody knew Steve hadn’t slept in his own room for the best part of three months.
Steve stands alone in the corridor reeling from the wake of his conversation with Natasha. Clenching his hands to fists out of nervous-frustrated habit, because it came back to Bucky. It always came back to Bucky and now there was someone else involved.
“Well, lookie here! The Avenger boys have come to see how the Monsters get things done!” Timothy Dugan strolls over to the new arrivals holding his arms outstretched in camaraderie. A dented fedora in one hand and missing a large portion of his uniform and synthetic skin off his forearm. He grasps Steve’s hand, shaking it vigorously. “Captain! Good t’see ya!” He booms. Steve manages to wrestle his hand from his grip. “You too Anthony, even if you don’t have the curtsy to lift the plate up on that thing.” Right on cue, the gold faceplate flips up, Tony flinches to speak. “There’s a good lad, respect your elders. Well, chitchat aside, to what do I owe the pleasure.”
Steve has to strain to hear, that’s how quiet Tony’s speaking. He nods and shifts accommodating him when he leans closer.
his voice dropping low and his fingertips stretching out and tracing the shape of his lips before pulling down on the bottom one, he tucks his thumb under Steve chin and tilts his head up, and Steve opens his mouth. He lets him in, he hollows his cheeks and sucks until Tony’s fingers scrape at the back of his throat. He flattens his tongue and laps against them, the same way he would if it was Tony’s cock instead.
He wasn’t lecturing, why did everybody think he lectured? It was more, trying to get Tony to see why everybody had been so worried, why Steve hadn’t had any sleep in the forty-eight hours since Tony had decided to jet off solo and cut communication with the whole team.
