“They can’t do it without me,” he said, smirking. “They’ve decided they can replace John, but they can’t find a double for me and nobody will watch if I’m not in it. Same production company that does
“It’s not random, not the way you’re thinking. They already knew each other. They have something in common.” He grabs John’s arm. “I need to look at the evidence again from the first three.”
All the calls she made after he came home, even when she was going through her breakup with Clara, all her concern was about him. She might have a way of saying things that sounds less than helpful, but she’s been worried. If anyone is selfish, it’s him.
“Yeah, me too.” If he had to preserve anything from that time, he realises he would do the same as Harry. If he hadn’t been in the army when their dad died, he might have cleaned out the old house with her and argued over what to keep. Now, it doesn’t matter.
He has cases, and that keeps him busy. It isn’t the same as it was when John was here, but it’s enough most days. The Work can’t love him back, but he is a knight errant. He has done his duty; he kept John safe and allowed him to be happy.
He doesn’t hesitate. Running to him, he grabs him in an embrace and doesn’t let go. His clothes absorb all the water from Watson’s body and he doesn’t care. He’s wet and cold and his heart is beating as it hasn’t for years. It’s wonderful.
But there was room for a bit of doubt as well. The evidence of the body, the circumstances and timing of the event, the new manager. And Jason Bradford, the elusive cab driver.
Holmes wasn’t interested in team sports. He played violin in the orchestra. Though his talents were respected, he never had a team ready to back him up. That was why, Watson supposes, he made friends with people like Wilkes. Better to keep your enemies close, and remind them that you have the power to hurt them.
He’s arrogant, too, and John can see why he has rubbed so many people the wrong way. He paces, tossing out words and syllables, talking more to himself than anyone, occasionally barking a question at Lestrade. He closes the door on Anderson, the tech, wonders out loud about
Dennis, who seems real enough, and hardly the waiter my dream brain would supply, returns to see if there is anything I need. “Mr Holmes will be here shortly,” he informs me.
I laughed. “No, it makes a good trophy.” I sank into his chair. “And it is the only thing I shall gain from this case.”
Bessie cried over me, and Miss Garvey sternly informed Aunt Kitty that her children ought to be punished for pulling such a stunt. She asked my cousins if any of them would like to be shut up in the Red Room overnight, and there were no takers.
Someone who will tolerate the things that help him cope. Not the drugs; he's given that up. But the violin, the pacing and talking to himself, the irregular hours. Most people have tidier lives; they eat and sleep at regular hours. Having a flatmate who plays his violin at all hours, who takes up space with experiments and leaves clutter all over (
“You can come back to mine,” Holmes says. “We still have the other thing to deal with. Our serial killer. I’d feel better if you’d sleep at my place.”
Sherlock lies on the bed, looking up at the ceiling, waiting for John’s footsteps, his key in the lock. All of his things are here. Of course he’ll be back.
The carriage is not crowded; they sit side by side. Most people are alone, looking at phones. A few have newspapers, and one or two have closed their eyes.
Putting on his jacket, he stops, frowning. “Didn’t you have a case last week? Sherlock said it was a two, at best. Tied him up for an evening.”
John turns to look at him. “How am I supposed to know that?” He blows on his tea. “My memory is fine, Sherlock.” He smiles.
But he does. He resumes the torture, landing repeated blows on his victim’s back. Sherlock raises his head and turns, looking over his shoulder at me, soundlessly pleading.
As an adult, I decided it would make sense to start a list of names and phone numbers, just in case there were more fights and I was required to pick someone up.
Sherlock is silently studying John, reaching some conclusion, perhaps. Maybe John has overstepped, coming to him like this. The case is solved— both cases— so maybe he’s changed his mind.
“There is something you can do,” Mary says. “If you could come home, just for a few days, she might be willing to talk. She’s been difficult, so don’t expect much from her. I think she’s still hurt that you left.”
The man took a step towards me, his whole demeanour threatening. For a moment he simply stood there, towering over me. Then quite suddenly he tore off his mask. “I am the King, it is true. Why should I conceal it?”
a father— without having to go through all the tedious parts of what that entails. No pregnant wife to appease, no messy childbirth, no colicky screaming, no tantrums and terrible twos—“
“Holmes!” Watson hissed. “Let’s go!” He tossed the last packets in the fire, grabbed my revolver and tucked it in my coat pocket.
? He was the one who helped me plan it, who insisted that you not be told. I’m thinking now that he was wrong about that. You should have come with me.”
Mary is slipping on a fluffy wrap over her dress. “David’s just been short-listed for a job with Spenser, the big publishing house. I hope we’ll be celebrating soon.” She smiles up at David. “Shall we?”
, John. I merely take an interest in seeing compatible people come together. Mike has been taking an interest as well. Since he brought us back together, I have complete faith in his ability to assess compatibility.”
“I will. I just need some time to acclimate myself.” He licks mousse from his fork. “You’re still at 221b, then.”
“Fine.” He has no intention of doing this, but Harry isn’t really hearing him. Even so, it can’t hurt to talk to Ella. Or maybe there are therapists that specialise in whatever he is. A confused bisexual who might be in love with his gay flatmate.
Though a ghost, John was still a child, curious about the world he hadn’t been in for so long. He hovered around me sometimes, and observed my cousins with interest. At other times, he wandered the house, taking things that drew his attention and finding places to hide them. He never talked much, but I did sometimes speak to him, especially when I got into trouble for moving Charles’s marbles or hiding Emma’s ring. I scolded him then, but he did not understand. He liked those pretty things, and saw no reason not to take them.
Sherlock clears his throat. “There’s another bedroom. Upstairs. You remember, John. It’s just storage now, but I believe there’s a bed under all those boxes. Somewhere. So, yes. There is a room.”
The water tasted normal, so he took another swallow. Brook was staring at his throat, watching him swallow.
“What are you on about?” He mumbles this into the pillow. “How d’you know I live here, anyway? You’re stalking me, aren’t you?”
“What for?” She slumped into John’s chair and pulled out her phone, began pecking at the screen. “I haven’t broken any laws.”
“Well, you said we have an early flight to Corsica or Crete or whatever island we’re spending a week on, so let’s just—“
The things he had observed suggested why John might have killed himself. It was necessary that this possibility not be denied.
Through the window in Ella’s office, I watch the rain come down. I stepped in a puddle on my way in, not looking where I was walking, and my shoes are wet. My toes are squelching inside them.
Just a quick intake of breath. When she let it out, it was gone. She’d never actually been jealous of John Watson, and at that moment she’d actually felt sorry for him.
That’s not entirely accurate, he thinks, backspacing. His life was messed up before they met, and is not
Hours later he woke in the dark and sat up, his heart pounding, cold sweat pouring down his sides. He flipped open his phone and saw that it was a few minutes after two.
“Please,” she said, clutching her papers and smiling hopefully. “Please tell me there will be a reunion episode. We all hoped you would do something for the tenth anniversary, and when there wasn’t a reunion, I wondered—“
Again, he looks surprised. “I thought… it might be hard for you, living there. That you’d move out and find a girlfriend. Get on with your life.”
It must puzzle certain people that a man like Watson remains a bachelor, sharing rooms with a man as antisocial as me. I did not often dwell on our situation, but every now and then I felt some doubt. What could a man like Watson, handsome and eligible, see in a man like me?
Other passengers had looked up from their newspapers and phones when he spoke. If his face had won him his first roles, his voice had helped him get more serious roles. He’d even been asked to do voice roles. Though the last one he’d done was a jaguar, there were worse things than playing a cartoon cat.
He is silent for a moment, nibbling at a biscuit. “At any rate, he’s moved on. He’ll get married and have a happy life now, and clearly I won’t be a part of that life. He’s even grown a ridiculous moustache. For a man, that means either an affair or a mid-life crisis. Or both. He’s moved on.”
Rolling his eyes, Holmes gives a short laugh. “Oh, I see. Now you’re going to flirt with me. I’m deeply flattered, Doctor, but you should know that I consider myself married to my work. And since I’m widely considered a sociopath— well, you can draw your own conclusions, if that’s not too much work.” He shakes his head. “What the fuck. You thought I was straight. I think I’m insulted.”
What now? He’ll find another horrible bedsit, visit Rosie on weekends. Or maybe Mary will leave London and he’ll only see her occasionally.
The shower gave Sherlock more time to think. Not all of the things he’d imagined over the last years were wrong. John had been depressed, desperate. Although he hadn’t killed himself, he must have been close to that point. And now, after years of hiding, it was going to be difficult to be out in public as himself. There would be the paparazzi, to be sure. They wouldn’t be able to go anywhere without being recognised. He could imagine the hoopla there would be about John’s resurrection. John had no doubt imagined it, too, and was willing to brave it in order to have his life back. He’d been away for years, though, and might have forgotten how brutal it could be.
Maybe he should have thought this out before the first date. He might have questioned John and planned the second date before the first was over.
“I don’t think I ever really hated you,” John says softly. “Back then, I was confused. But I’m not now. I wish I could take back all those years. When I saw you at Barts that day, I felt like a fool, being forced to learn the same lesson all over again.”
He’ll never get tired of this. All the cups of tea, the morning production of eggs and toast. The evenings, the conversations and the silences. He will be old someday, and even when he gives up the Work, there will always be something to do, and he will always have
“Well, Watson. I’m a bit wiser now, perhaps. I still miss you, and I have never known what to do about that. Once I thought I could bring you back, but maybe you wouldn’t have wanted that. The last time I saw Molly, she seemed happy. She was ready to die. She said she wanted to fall asleep and not wake up. Maybe that’s what you want, too.”
John is able to impress Andy by listing all eight drummers that Judas Priest had. Andy introduces him to Stefan and they launch into a discussion of the ideal configuration of a seventies band.
“Why did you hate me so?” I asked her this without animosity. I was merely curious at that point, wondering why she had made my life miserable when she had everything she wanted— a beautiful house, an attentive husband, healthy children. “I was just a child, and yet you treated me as if I were a threat.”
He wonders: what kind of woman is she, the former Mrs Watson? She was perceptive enough to see something good in John, but foolish enough to throw it away. She left him; Sherlock knows that was part of John’s depression.
He’s a bit envious, as always, of people who are completely comfortable making a fool of themselves. John often makes a fool of himself, but he’s never been that easy-going about it. Somehow it seems that if you’re making a fool of yourself and you’re obviously enjoying it, you’re not a fool, not really.
“Before I met you, I never thought of marrying, mostly because it is illegal for men like you and me.”
My brother set his cup down in the saucer, where it was refilled at once by Watson. Mycroft smirked up at him.
“I was prepared…” I gave another pitiful sigh. “Well, evidently you have had better luck than I. When is the happy day to be?”
On the appointed day, I was waiting at the port, watching each person as they disembarked, looking for the only one who mattered.
.” He’s pronouncing words carefully, he notices, because his lips are not fully cooperating. Speech is such a complicated thing.
He is surprised to notice that the hour is up. He schedules another appointment for the following week.
I awoke in the infirmary, burning with fever. “Where is Victor?” I remember asking. “Has he gone to Heaven?”
“That’s right,” said John. “Sally Donovan will have a recurring role as a prosecutor for the Crown. In the opening episode, Anderson is a conspiracy theorist suffering from schizophrenia who is accused of murder. Molly Hooper’s doing a guest appearance as a lawyer representing him. Mike Stamford will have a small part as the person who introduces Ian and Baz, which is appropriate since he’s managing both of our careers now.”
Watson nods. If Holmes wanted company, he would have asked. “You know where to find me. Think I’ll start coming up with some interview questions.”
Sherlock’s attention is suddenly diverted back to the street. “There— that cab!” He grabs his coat. “Let’s go!”
“The incident that Wilkes referred to when we arrived was the disappearance of a student whose bed was found empty this morning,” Holmes explains. “Instead of calling the police as any responsible person would, Mr Wilkes, seeking to avoid unwanted publicity, organised some of the teachers to search the grounds for the boy, without luck. About an hour ago, the body was found by a couple of boys who must have known where to look.”
She returns to the kitchen, sits in John’s chair. She knows her father lives here and has come here because— “You’ve had an argument with your mother.”
“Not at all. But why would you spend your best years with me when you could have a pretty wife and children?”
As soon as he opened his mouth, it would be obvious. The eyes behind those goggles might blanch at the sight of his fangs, one of which he’d broken two nights ago, caught on a studded dog-collar. Why were people still wearing those things? Goth went out ages ago. He ought to have noticed the eyeliner, the black nail varnish…
. Such a depressing word. His own family was shite. When he left home, all those years ago, he thought he could shake off any nostalgia. Even Christmas was shite at the Watson house. No crackers, no pudding, no Father Christmas. Just a lot more bottles than usual. And yet, in spite of shite holidays and forgotten birthdays, nostalgia insists on visiting him on those days like the ghost of something past. He remembers how glad he was to go away to school. He remembers thinking that the worst part of his life was over.
It was a complex case. Miss Morstan had preserved her father’s papers, one of which was diagram of a building, signed with four names. This was the beginning, the theft of a treasure, its concealment and recovery and subsequent disappearance over a span of some thirty years. As I say, the case was much deeper and subtler than I originally suspected, but by the time I had listened to Watson prattling on about nonsense (no doubt in some futile attempt to turn Miss Morstan’s attention away from the odd circumstances we found ourselves in), and by the time I had grown tired of watching her slide her hand into Watson’s, pretending to be in need of manly courage, we had learned the strange history of the treasure map, as well as the origin of the pearls. They were part of a treasure which was to be divided four ways, the only surviving shareholder being a man named Jonathan Small, who had made a deal with Major Sholto to recover the treasure and bring it to England. Sholto had died before revealing the location, but one of his sons, Bartholomew Sholto, had found out where it was hidden. Unfortunately, he was dead before we could question him. The method of death was a poisoned dart, which made an interesting addition to my index of weapons.
She’s pursing her lips, studying him with the same intensity that he’s inflicting on her. She knows him well, probably better than he’s ever known her.
He remembers that moment. It wasn’t a decision so much as it was simply gravity, doing what it was always meant to do. He could not resist the pull. Whatever happened, he would always love John Watson.
“You do not know my mother, Watson, or what she is capable of. We will not change her mind by defying her. It will only make her more determined. And devious. We will outlast her, agreeing with her, but not carrying out our promises.”
“Let’s begin, then,” said Molly. “We start in the surgery where Jason and Neil work. Holly stops by and talks with Neil. So that’s me and Mike up first.”
Mycroft Holmes is a man who weighs risks and benefits. I can understand this, as long as I know where his limits lie. If it comes down to saving his brother or maintaining some sort of international balancing act, how willing would he be to sacrifice Sherlock? Would he call it
Ignoring Sherlock, he addresses John. “Thank you for your help with the Priory School case. It was not an ideal resolution, but the Crawfords are grateful to know what happened. And the Starks, well… changes are being made at the school to ensure that nothing like this happens again.”
Unremarkable. She was now with Clara Stoddard, John’s former manager, in a romantic relationship. That was interesting enough to pursue, if necessary. She also seemed to blame Sherlock for her brother’s death. Did she really believe him dead? She was certainly angry about it and likely had a theory that implicated Sherlock. He would come back to that.
William could sleep in the room next to the maid’s room. She glared at me as if I had broken his hobby horse or stolen his marbles.
Back in the days when he’d been pining for John, too embarrassed to say anything, Molly had pined for him. It took him a while to realise it, and the light only went on in his brain when Mike had explained it to him.
The woman staring at him gave him a flirtatious smile. Women did that, now that he had fully grown into his odd looks, no longer appearing alien. Men did it too. The women he dismissed, having no interest in that. The men… well, at Cambridge he’d indulged himself a few times, enjoying a degree of anonymity, or at least disregard. It was always disappointing, though, when they seemed more impressed with the fact that they’d just shagged Alex Tribble than with anything about
It ought to be a gradual thing, like respect. It ought to be logical, to counterbalance the animal instinct that is sex. There are different kinds of love, and none of them seem to obey any rules. Sherlock accepts that he
Sherlock is a man who lives in his own head, thinking about things that John can’t easily imagine. While this and other things (small explosions in the kitchen, mysterious containers in the fridge John has learned not to open, and late night violin concerts) might make Sherlock a terrible, inconsiderate flatmate, John finds himself too fascinated with the man to care. It’s an interesting life, occasionally a dangerous life, and it’s his life now. He doesn’t miss the peace and quiet.
Fake Jason was gone, Mr Smith was telling the others, taken away by the Intergalactic Police that Alex had called at some point. Now it just remained for Alex to explain why Jason had been abducted and why the alien had come after him.
“Welcome home, brother.” He did not rise to his feet, his considerable bulk making that difficult. We had never been ones for brotherly embraces, anyway.
Matt gives him the address and his number. He enters the information in his phone, along with the date. Leaving the cafe, he feels like something has lifted from his shoulders. And he’s not limping.
He draws himself up, crosses his arms defensively. “I told you before. I’m not cut out for this. I didn’t want it, and now that it’s not working, I can hardly be surprised, can I? You and Mike thought I would cure whatever was ailing John Watson. Well, he’s fine— found a job, worked through his gay phase, and reconciling with his family.”
“You’re afraid he doubts your commitment. If you haven’t talked about it, though, you don’t really know what he’s feeling, and you could be mistaken. Again, communication is the key. Why don’t you tell me how you met?”
As I watch them lower you into the ground, the hole in my heart does not close, not even a little. If anything, it grows larger.
When he arrives home that evening, the flat is empty. Sherlock is gone, and hasn’t left a note or any indication of where he went or what caused him to leave.
When all his inner parts seem to be working, the doctor says John can go home. His legs are fine, but he’s slow on the stairs because his gut is still healing and he has no stamina. Sherlock sees him to the sofa, props him up on pillows, and covers him with blankets. He hovers a bit, watching John fall sleep.
He thinks this is his sixth scotch, or maybe his seventh. It’s a celebration, so that’s fine. You don’t sit there drinking ginger ale when your mate is telling you how amazing his baby is.
“Not important. Get up now, or you’ll miss your cue. It’s time to go be Alex Tribble, saving the world. Or Sherlock Holmes, falling back into the gutter.” His grin was vicious, triumphant.
Greg grinned and grabbed John in a bear hug. “Glad you’re back.” He nodded at Sherlock. “This one— quite a handful, but I think you might be good for him.”
“You may not believe it, Mr Watson, but your master was a very taciturn young man,” he said, eyes twinkling. “We could hardly get him to say a word.”
Holmes has obtained a bacterium and infected himself, supposedly to gain a confession from a man who used the same agent to kill his nephew. As always, it is a matter of money, an inheritance that should have gone to the nephew, had he not died.
“I heard about that. You know, I worried about you, seeing what you were going through. That was actually part of what made me keep going. I know that sounds stupid, but I used to imagine that we were together, weathering it all.”
The John Watson I saw that night at the Landmark was a different man from the one I left when I stepped off the roof at Barts. I hadn’t known this Watson before, the one who thought he looked good in a moustache, who was wearing an actual suit for what was obviously a date, who was about to have dinner in a restaurant that had a wine list. My John never let the stubble grow, even on his day off, and never thought of growing a moustache. He didn’t like suits, would put on a tie and jacket over the same checked shirt he wore to work if he had a date, and would rather order a beer than decipher a wine list.
People worry about me because I never do anything but sit at home, thinking about Sherlock. They keep urging me to go back to work. Christ, it’s been months. It still hurts.
“You know, I was in love with you for a long time.” She is surprised to find herself blushing. It’s not as if he was unaware; they’ve just never really talked about it. “You didn’t do anything to encourage me, but I still loved you. I know you thought I was pathetic--“
I hurried back to the study, where Watson had just succeeded in getting the safe open. I knelt beside him and began shuffling through the papers, “Someone is up. You must go, and I will be directly behind you. Wait for me at the iron fence.”
“If he’s going to help us, he needs to know how serious this killer is,” Holmes snaps. “Now, describe what you saw on the footage. Better yet, show it to me. Send it now, so that I can open it on my laptop.”
“Jesus, Sherlock. Don’t tell me. I’d rather not know. Okay, I got him. 19 Gascoigne Place, Number 7, Hackney. Appropriate— drives a cab. A hackney, you know. Sort of an archaic term now—” More clicking. “Oh. Want to see what he looks like?”
“Miss Wickham suggested that we two go to see a musical, and so we did. We were able to get tickets to
“To some extent. We had a conversation, and that helped me understand why you were seeing her. You’d just returned from Afghanistan and were having trouble adapting to civilian life, and there were some problems in your marriage.”
I heard the mail arrive, but was contemplating a problem, and so did not move from my chair. Mrs Hudson would eventually bring it up.
Lestrade did not look grateful for my suggestions. He looked weary, annoyed, and resigned. He stood. “I’d better get started.”
“I'm afraid not.” He shook his head ruefully. “Doctor Watson is, as we both know, an impulsive man. He is a man, however, not a boy. His decisions have not been sound, but they were his to make. All that was left in your account he spent on trifles. I set him up in a surgery, but he could not make it work. He gambled, ended up in debt. I gave him a sum, hoping that he could reestablish himself at Barts, but instead he invested it in this ridiculous South Africa scheme. Diamonds, for God’s sake! The man knows nothing about serious investments, let himself be persuaded by some very questionable people calling themselves businessmen. I did try to discuss it with him, but he would not hear reason. He said he needed to trust his luck one more time.”
“I came to Priory a year before you did,” Holmes says. “It was the third school I’d attended in as many years. You might say that I can appreciate your position better than most, having been the
At this point I would begin to cough, which would suggest that I had a consumptive disease. As a doctor, he would know that such a cough spelled doom, that it was too late for him to save me.
He settled into his chair. “You really ought to listen to your doctor, seeing as how you’ve paid for his expertise. About Milverton— what will you tell him?”
“As it happens, I will also be out,” Watson said, appearing in the doorway. “The Wickhams have invited me to dinner. Apparently they liked what they saw.”
“Your mum’s going to be angry when she finds out you’ve run away,” John said, changing the subject. “You can’t live with me.”
No one explained to me what had happened. At five, I had already lost one parent, and knew something about death. Sometimes on my walks through the woods I would find a bird or a mouse that had died. I was not afraid to touch them, though my nurse did not like it when I brought them home to study. I only wanted to understand what was happening inside those small, cold bodies. I knew about blood, that it flowed through living bodies, but when the heart stopped, the blood did not move. I had seen small skeletons in the woods as well, tiny white bones picked clean by insects and other animals. I was not afraid of death; I was only curious. I wanted to see the membrane that separated the living and the dead. I wanted to look through it.
“I will.” Ending the call, he stood and filled the kettle, set it to boil. “Magnussen has been arrested. Mycroft told me.”
He feels no antagonism towards Ella specifically. Having a therapist embarrasses him. He shouldn’t feel this way, lots of people have therapists, and there’s no shame in that— but he has never seen himself as the type of person who needs to talk to a professional about his life. Life isn’t easy, never has been, but that’s just how things are.
“Good. Let’s keep it that way.” John rearranges them so they’re lying side by side. He puts his arms around Sherlock and kisses him again. “New normal.”
He used to think about what it would be like to meet his nemesis again, years after they both left school. He’d imagined what he would say, how he would feel. That day in Barts was nothing like those imaginings. All the clever things he’d thought of were gone the moment Holmes turned and looked at him. There’s a name for the phenomenon:
“He’s married, then?” Though I myself had suggested it more than once, my heart sank. He had probably fallen prey to some needy girl who would produce a tiny new Watson every year and lose both her face and figure within five. I should have discussed it with him. I could have warned him about women’s wiles, how they use tears and flattery to—
He was putting bread into the toaster and had a carton of eggs and a rasher of bacon on the worktop, pans waiting on the stove.
Then they head outside and stand on the pavement for a moment, neither of them sure how to end it. John thanks him profusely for the food, the wine, the evening. “It was very nice meeting you,” he says as they stand at the kerb.
is the right word, but I’m with my flatmate. So not dating, living together. He’s… he’s gay, and I decided to be open… after Mary, I mean. I thought I’d try. See if I’m… really.”
The history teacher sits behind the desk in his classroom. He is hunched over, but his expression is belligerent.
Molly ran to open the door. Before opening it she paused, turned back to look at them, smiling, and said, “Now, don’t say anything until you’ve heard me out. Promise?”
“Do you remember?” I ask him. “I said I love you, that I would be here, waiting for you. I promised myself that I would make it up to you for being so blind, for thinking you didn’t have a heart, for not understanding that you did all this for me. You have my heart, Sherlock.”
You told me to put on the navy one. I don’t know why on that particular day you didn’t like the other one.
. Maybe he’s been following Watson around, waiting for just such a moment, when he can point out once more what a miserable failure he is.
“My actions were reasonable, under the circumstances. And what did you do? Instead of doing what I bid you do, marrying that girl — what’s her name — and settling down in a medical practice, you go running off on some ill-considered scheme, getting shot at and fleeing for your life back to England. You are very lucky not to be dead. I would be quite annoyed if you were, after I took such pains to keep you out of harm’s way.”
” Sherlock turns and regards his friend. That’s what he supposes Lestrade is, after several years of working with him. He owes the man something, he knows, for giving him a chance, giving him the publicity that has brought in clients. It was Mycroft who got him off the streets (yet again), but his rehabilitation was much quicker after he met Lestrade, knowing that he had something to work towards.
“It’s never random. He’s choosing his victims. The different methods are meant to throw us off, keep us from thinking it’s a series. And Scotland Yard wouldn’t have a clue if I hadn’t noticed the sign.” He looks proud. “That’s why they need me.”
John wasn’t well even before he sat down. Recuperating from his injuries, he has clearly lost a lot of weight in recent months. He seemed hungry, but as he ate his dinner, he became uncomfortable, which suggests that he hasn’t been eating well lately. The meal was too heavy for him. Financial troubles, Sherlock had deduced. He’s probably been living on instant noodles and canned beans. And he saw the moment when it occurred to John that there would be a bill for the meal which he would not be able to pay. His face paled, and he looked unwell, excused himself from the table.
was haunting him. I stood in the shadows, watching and listening. Charles told him to go back to his own room, but Edwin refused, and eventually Charles let him sleep in his bed. John seemed satisfied with this outcome. After moving Edwin’s marbles to Emma’s room, he lost interest.
Holmes gives Lestrade a severe look. “Male, mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Fish out of water, ill at ease, eager to talk to a friendly face. And
Why did she do it? He doesn’t understand. Was it for John? It couldn’t have been for Sherlock. She must have seen it, though. A woman that perceptive would know how he felt about John. Maybe she thought John needed him, too, more than he needed Mary.
“I’d like to make a confession,” the old man said. “Not because I’m religious, but because in everyone there is something that wants unburdening. There are things I have kept to myself which I would like you to know. As you are one of the youngest men Scotland Yard has promoted to Inspector, I think you might benefit from my experience. And I would ask you not to reveal what I say to anyone else.”
I do. I move my chair closer to his, put my arms around him and kiss him. For a second, he seems too shocked to react, and then he grasps my arms and holds on, kissing me as if I were breathing life into him. In our alcove we can’t easily be seen, but I don’t care who’s watching. I kiss him until he comes up for air. He looks at me, his eyes wide and amazed, and then he grins.
“I grant that she is amiable,” he replied. “Not a superficial prettiness, but something more spiritual. Though her situation inspires pity, she has clearly risen above her misfortune.”
He looked at the evidence he found online. For the most part, all the English-language accounts came from one source, the AP bureau in Japan that first reported it. He looked at Kyodo News and a few others to see if there were any details AP had omitted, but concluded that no other bureau had done an independent investigation or attempted to dig up additional details. Japanese news tended to be more fact-oriented that western news, less inclined towards speculation; there was no investigative reporting in Japan. It was scandalous enough that a big star would commit suicide there; no Japanese reporter would unearth or dish up any dirt about it, and no media outlet would report it.
He wasn't sure what to say to Sherlock. It was pretty much a harmless fantasy, but it was an odd one, too. Why had he told Greg that they were childhood friends? What benefit could it give him to say that?
“Truly, John, I am sorry.” Holmes stares out the window. Watson sees his face reflected in the glass. His eyes are sad, not cold and mocking. “I’m not begging for your forgiveness. That is yours to give or withhold. If we can’t be friends… well, I accept the consequences.”
My return was made known to Lestrade, and with his help we succeeded in arresting Sebastian Moran for the murder of Ronald Adair, who had caught him cheating at cards. Adair had foolishly attempted to blackmail the second most dangerous man in London. I proved that Moran had killed him with an air rifle by using a wax likeness of myself. The bullet Moran fired into it matched the one that killed Adair.
John looks disappointed, and Sherlock feels a physical pain in his gut. It’s ending. John lies to him, he lies to John, and the end is getting closer every day. He knows what he ought to do, but can’t bring himself to do it yet.
Sherlock, being the younger, is the sole focus of her displeasure now. Her friends have eligible daughters; she has an eligible son. Such arrangements require more intense negotiation than most international treaties, as well as skills that she has spent her entire life honing. Sherlock has nearly reached the ideal age for marriage, and she is ready to open deliberations with several families. Her displeasure lies in his refusal to consider marriage at all.”
And once again, John is sitting by himself, a lump of regret settling in his gut. He’s not sorry for making a fool of himself in front of these people. Melancholy just his normal state after the party’s over. People will begin leaving in pairs, and John will finally go off into the night by himself.
“She is an American,” he said. “I met her when she performed at the Opera House in Prague. After that meeting, I enjoyed a relationship with her for several months. Obviously, she is not on my level. Though she would have made an admirable queen, it was necessary to end our relationship.”
Rather than carry the boxes home on the train, he takes them to the post office and mails them to his flat in London. He leaves Harry a note on the kitchen counter.
A month later we stood together in the church of St George the Martyr in Holborn, watching the happy couple make their vows. The blessing given, they turned and started down the aisle, both of their faces glowing.
The phone, handed over with complete trust to a stranger. The inscription on the case, the scratches where the charging cord is plugged in.
The sun is going down and he’s suddenly tired. Sleep doesn’t come to him much these days. It’s been a long time since he’s used himself up enough to go into stasis. Since Watson died he hasn’t killed himself once. There are ways he could do that. He could walk into the ocean now and drown, his body weighted so he would never be found. He wonders what that would be like, to drift forever under the waves.
There’s a sudden run on vegan milk, several people vying for the last carton of unsweetened almond milk. We step away from the case, stand in the middle of the aisle.
Sherlock cringes, just a bit, sad to think that he’ll never hear John say those words and really mean them. All he has left is brain-damaged John, who says and does inappropriate things.
Suddenly understanding that he is the one being set up, John falls silent. Maybe Sherlock owed Molly a favour. Maybe he lost a bet with Lestrade. Something like that…
Holmes), he suspects he’s simply bored. Nothing to do, no desire to do anything. At a time of his life when he should be having interesting days in the operating room, barely enough time for lunch, and return to his flat every evening relieved to collapse in his chair and have a break from the madness, he lives a small life.
It wasn’t clear whether John was improvising lines or actually speaking to Sherlock, himself. He wasn’t sure it mattered.
His sister might have been involved as well. If John did fake his death, it’s most likely that he would have confided in someone. His sister Harriet, with no ties in the world of acting, might be that person. Arguing against this was the fact that they had never gotten along. But blood often turned out to be thicker than imagined. If John needed her, she might have helped him, especially since, as his only living relative, she was likely the beneficiary of his insurance and the legatee of his will. That would be another thing to check, whether he had made a will. If he had, it would be public record now.
“It’s not that easy,” Holmes says. “Requires a lot of vigilance. Mental focus. The only time I’ve heard you slip was when you were drunk.”
The following scene was the one Sherlock had been dreading. In the original episodes Molly’s character, Holly, didn’t find out that Alex was an alien until the final episode, and spent every one of the previous episodes pining after him, trying to get him to notice her. Since Alex had no clue about love or relationships, he always missed the meaning of her hints and suggestions. He was kind to her, but uninterested and sometimes puzzled by things she said. This was meant to be humorous, but always felt cruel to Sherlock.
She sighs. The work will get done when it gets done. She’s just one person with two hands, and doing a job carefully is much more important that doing it quickly. A certain Detective Inspector might drop by and ask what the hold up is, and she’ll explain, and he might stay and chat, or even ask her out to lunch, and that would be fine. Very much so.
“Of course you did. And I suppose I forgive you for running off like an idiot and getting shot in God Knows Where.”
He scoffed. “Because it would mean killing a part of my soul. I just couldn’t. Not another fucking alien.”
He finishes his sandwich and decides he will treat himself, even though it isn’t Friday. There are some scones in the case, a few Danish pastries, lemon squares, and several kinds of cake. He opts for a slice of chocolate cake.
on the side, an ordinary container like the ones found at picnics and sporting events. It occurred to him that accepting anything from Brook might be risky. He was quite thirsty, though. Surely Brook wouldn’t try anything tonight. Irene had said he wouldn’t, that he needed this boost to his career.
But I should have given something to you, at the very least my friendship. I told you that your death affected your friends greatly. For me, it was devastating. I wished that I had allowed myself to be closer to you, that I had talked and listened instead of keeping to myself. My distance from you and the others was motivated by my fear of exposing myself and hurting you, but I regret it now.
I waited, returning her gaze with what I hoped was a fond look. At last she laid her spoon on the dish and looked me in the eye.
Victor laughed. “Right. It’s that brother of yours, isn’t it? You know, he threatened me when you left rehab. Said he’d ruin me if I even so much as admitted that I’d known you.”
, he told himself. An actor needs to be able to let go and put himself into a role, to let instinct take over sometimes. He and John had experienced many such moments— leaving the script, the carefully prepared lines cast aside in an epiphany. It was brilliant when that happened. Just— flash! — and one of them played off the other’s inspiration. In those moments it almost seemed as if they could read each other’s minds.
I can’t exist in this limbo much longer. I have to choose a path, up towards the dim daylight of the world without Sherlock Holmes, or down into the darkness.
Third point. John came home late more than once, giving no excuse or an obviously fake excuse. It hadn’t occurred to Sherlock that he might have been seeing a counsellor, but that’s probably what it was. He recalls how embarrassed John was of his limp and how he hated seeing Ella. When his limp disappeared, he called and cancelled his appointment, clearly relieved not to have to go through that. He hates talking about his problems, his feelings— it embarrasses him not to be whole, to need that kind of support. Of course he wouldn’t tell Sherlock.
“Thank you.” Watson sat down on the Queen mattress and looked up at Holmes. “How do I look on this one?”
When John shoots the cabbie, Sherlock realises that there is another kind of love. Or maybe it’s what he’s been looking for all along, the thing he had almost decided was a fairy tale. He loves John Watson— selflessly, with his whole brain (never mind his body).
I am a good dancer; my mother made sure of that. There is little about my figure which my tailor feels a need to disguise. People may not call me handsome, but striking is a word sometimes used to describe me. If I wanted attention, I could have females flocking about me. But women at balls are silly creatures. One cannot have a serious conversation with a woman in a gown who is scouting the dance floor for partners and picking up enough gossip to last her until the next ball.
John is a bit flushed, he notices. He nods and pretends to follow what Sherlock is saying, but his attention is clearly on the man in the corner.
I probably should have asked which Rosamund was in a bit of trouble. When I arrived at the school office, a girl I’d never seen was waiting for me. She had blond hair with pink highlights.
In that moment, all the pieces I’d been ignoring came together. My aunt would send me to some sort of religious school where my soul could be saved. Well, I am sure she did not care about my soul, but she did care about her darlings. Clearly she had begun to fear my influence over them, as if I were possessed. That is what the unspoken fear was, that I’d come under the influence of some evil spirit, who had brought all these strange things to Greenwood Hall. They could not see John, of course, and assumed all the peculiarities were caused by me.
He didn’t move, though. Instead, he sat rooted in his chair, rubbing his hands on his trousers, uncertain and afraid to ask.
“It’s the social instinct, Doctor. Birds of a feather. Us and them.” He gives Watson a weary smile. “You’re an idealist. You believe there could be a society without hatred, but I think you’re wrong. Wherever unity finds a foothold, people will invariably look for a way to create division.”
Brook paused, drawing the moment out. This was his big scene, and he intended to use it to his advantage. Sherlock understood the impulse, but didn’t think it would do him much good. He simply wasn’t a good enough actor.
John is hungry; he hasn’t eaten much for the last week because there was a glitch with his pension being deposited. Tea and toast have been his go-to meal, alternating with noodles. He’s sure he looks awful, his skin grey and his eyes puffy.
Her broad face flushed with irritation. “What are you doing, boy? Lurking about, eavesdropping? Come inside and meet our guest. And mind your manners.”
“That is what the dying man confessed to me. He gave me no name, no date, no explanation of his method. Though I had many questions, I mumbled the words of absolution, and he left.
If this is a dream, it’s the most vivid one I’ve ever had, even counting the nightmares after Afghanistan. It might be wishful thinking, too. It answers all my fears in a way that dreams never do. It lets me believe that Sherlock is alive, that he has faked his death and plans to return to me once he’s finished the work before him.
I smiled. “Not my problem. You’ve spent so much time browbeating Watson that the woman has most likely left the country by now.”
Watson maintained his composure. “Madam, your son has graciously patronised me. I hope my service to him is sufficient to repay his generosity.”
Lestrade shrugs. “Doesn’t give us much to go on. Sherlock’s been staking out different bars, talking to regulars to see if they’ve noticed anything. The first one was a gay bar, too, but the second murder took place in a park, and the third was in a car park. All three victims were gay, though, which made us think that he’s stalking gay men.”
led to a couple of movie roles, but though his performance was praised, neither film did well. After four years, the cop series would film one more series, the show runners deciding to end it before it got stale. He would soon find himself jobless again, which was why he was considering the alien role.
“And now?” John licks his lips, avoids looking into those pale eyes. “Are you doing this just to get your friends off your back, so you can say you tried romance?”
He stopped at a display of socks. Sherlock did love his silk socks, so much that he kept them indexed in his drawer. And socks were something you really couldn’t have too many of.
Sherlock was an addict, and I used to be hard on him about that. Alcohol is bad, but drugs scare me. All those hours I spent learning about the effects of various drugs on the human body made me realise that using drugs recreationally is like playing Russian roulette. I hated the idea that Sherlock was so casual about his former drug use, and always suspected that he’d go right back to using if I didn’t keep watch over him.
By the time his return is announced, we’ve established ourselves as a couple, sleeping together, snogging when we feel like it, and learning how to make love to one another. It isn’t difficult; we’ve lived together before, and I guess our bodies have been anticipating what would happen if we were reunited. We were ready for that.
In Sussex he has owned a cottage for years. He brings just two things with him, his violin and Watson’s urn. He buys an old dog, names him Toby, and walks the South Downs.
Two weeks later we were returning to Baker Street midday, on our way home from a not-very-interesting case with a disappointing solution. I was grumpy because the case had fizzled after a promising start. And I had not anticipated that sentence diagramming was actually a skill I needed to retain. John seemed unperturbed. And he knows his grammar, even gerunds. He is a pragmatic person, a doctor and a soldier, and crosses things off his list when they’re done.
Watson talked with Miss Chadwick, carefully mindful of my warning not to flirt. While we were dressing for dinner I had advised him to frown more. “Whether you intend it or not, every woman thinks you are trying to seduce her. Do not lead her on.”
Ella tells him that he’s healing, and that he needs to think about what he needs. His career has been about caring for others; now he must learn to care for himself.
“Nonsense. I’m enjoying the walk and have no wish to sit around with invalids. Go, Watson. You worry too much about me. It is not the Professor’s modus operandi to follow his enemies into the wilderness and assault them. We will see him again, but not today. Go, take care of this woman, and we will see one another tonight.”
The block where John Watson lives is dismal, a honeycomb of tiny cells with single occupants. Sherlock walks down a poorly-lit hallway that smells of dampness and old cooking grease. These are flats where people live because they have no other choices. In one of these cells, John Watson is probably preparing tea and toast for his supper, or maybe a packet of instant noodles. No one would willingly live like this unless they were desperate.
“She is a singularly lovely woman, is she not? And intelligent as well. Our royal client was right; she would have made an excellent queen.”
We lay tangled in the sheets. Wanting to see his face, I let him take my prick from above. As I felt myself swallowed up inside of of him, I experienced such ecstasy that I could barely contain myself. He slowed at my signal, allowing my excitement to build slowly, filling my belly with an anxious warmth that finally was released when he whispered in my ear,
Milverton shrugged. “In such matters, Mr Holmes, one does what one must. You understand— you have a reputation of your own to uphold. If it were threatened, no doubt you would weigh the value of mere money against disgrace and dishonour. Clearly, the lady has not done anything
But maybe he just needs to leave Sherlock alone to work out whatever’s troubling him. He did tell John that he sometimes doesn’t talk, even for days.
“When he heard John had committed suicide three years later, it disturbed him. He felt guilty for keeping quiet, so we had a drink and he told me. As far as I know, he never told anyone else.”
She shakes her head. “I couldn’t say anything about his love life. As far as I know, you’re the first. But I have seen enough of the man to know that he’s a sociopath. He gets bored, and will use you until he finds a new pet. That’s what sociopaths do.”
I’ll be seeing you again very soon, and when I do, I expect you to be ready. There’s no point in sitting home, looking at your gun and thinking about killing yourself, or walking the streets at night, waiting for someone to do it for you. Not when there are things happening out there. Murders that need solving, wrongs that need righting.
John sits at his desk in his tiny office at work, going through his email. Sherlock hasn’t responded to his texts; John has no idea where he is or what he’s up to.
I sipped my tea, letting the steam warm me. “How do you feel about a holiday on the continent, Watson? We could go to Paris, perhaps. Lots of museums, much to do in and around the city. We could easily fill a week with entertainments there. Or perhaps you’d prefer to leave the urban jungle behind and spend a walking holiday in Switzerland. Exercise and fresh air—”
I shift my gaze, taking in the sitting room. It looks as it always does, papers, clothing, files, dishes filling every available space. It feels like home.
“It’s been a while since we went to a concert,” said Watson. “I know it’s not my birthday, and yours isn’t for another week. What’s the occasion?”
“Much as I would enjoy pretending to look for a gift for a friend while perusing all of this—“ he waved a hand at the narrow space— “I won’t waste your time. You were John Watson’s manager when he died.”
He thinks about the beehives, the cottage he has imagined in Sussex. That might happen, but there will not be anyone standing at the door, calling him in for tea. Sherlock will be alone. That’s the way it must be. Alone will protect him.
she gave herself away. Like all women, she protects the thing she values the most. A mother would head straight for her child, an unmarried woman will grab her jewel box. Miss Adler went to the place where she had the photograph hidden — a recess behind a sliding panel in the drawing room, just beside the bell-pull. When I called out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it. Tomorrow we will watch the flat until she leaves, break in and steal it.”
The furniture in the small sitting room was probably second-hand, purchased from a shop that catered to modest incomes. A small-screen television set told him that Jason Bradford didn’t watch much, probably kept it on in the background when he was home.
“Hush. Did you really expect that you could walk out dressed like that and come home smelling of perfume? Did you not expect to find me waiting for you?”
Holmes nods. If he had a heart that could die, it would stop beating now, as Watson turns his back to him and starts down the stairway.
John’s mouth may have been open for a bit. It’s an odd question. Everybody knows they’re straight until something happens and they know they’re not. Isn’t that the way it works? “I just knew. When did you know you were gay?”
A week later he had obtained a violin that I might use. It was not as fine an instrument as his, but it would suffice for my lessons. Every evening we went into the chapel, where we would not disturb the other students and staff. He taught me to read music, and to make my instrument sing.
“I confess that I’m knackered,” Watson said, leaning back in his chair and stretching. “Might just crawl into bed and see if I can sleep.”
He didn’t take it. “True. It just feels very sudden. Having three daughters is a lot to get used to, even without the mothers. I feel… responsible. What if they get in trouble?”
“It’s a good name.” He smiled and touched my hair, stroking my curls. “Stay alive, now. Go back. Live your life.”
is fine.” He smiles again, feeling even more brittle as he does. “I guess Molly told you something about me.” Molly isn’t the matchmaker, just the link between the two matchmakers— John’s old classmate Mike Stamford, and someone named Lestrade, a cop Sherlock works with. It’s Molly who knows them both and helped arrange this date.
Wickham and his wife seemed like people too ordinary for my mother to bother about, which told me that she had sought them out specifically with Watson in mind. Perhaps she had met them through one of her charities. My brother spent spent the fish course allowing Mrs Wickham to tell him about her sons, the main course interrogating Mr Wickham, the banker, about the minutiae of that business. He has a gift for making boring people talk because he is equally boring.
He’s angry, so angry— with Sherlock, with himself, with Mary. He should have refused Mary and stayed with Sherlock over the weekend. They might have been able to talk things out.
When he hid a dead mouse inside the cake tin, right next to the last piece of lemon drizzle, knowing that Mycroft was looking forward to eating it when he came home from school, he waited with a degree of patience he rarely demonstrated. When the reward would be red-faced, angry Mycroft crying about a piece of cake, he could have waited much longer.
“I’m suggesting a therapist, but also a support group for newly-divorced men. It might help with some of what you’re going through. All of your adult life you’ve been a husband and father. Navigating new relationships, dealing with your ex, being a parent to your child— all of these are things you might benefit from talking about with other divorced men.”
“And I’ve apologised for that,” he snaps. “What can I say? I’m a horrible person. I said you were gay, an insult that every boy there casually threw at every other boy at some point. It meant nothing. You’re gay, I’m gay. Who gives an actual fuck? Move on, find a real identity crisis if you need to have one.”
Mycroft cocks his head, looking at Watson as if he wants to ask a question, but isn’t sure what that question might be.
Awkwardly I stand and face him. I want to hug him, to make sure he’s actually real, but he looks uncomfortable and I remember the wounds on his back that must still be healing. A hand shake feels wrong, though. He’s been dead, and now he’s here, in the flesh.
“You thought I’d leave you because that’s happened to you before. Someone left you, someone you loved.”
He hears the front door open and close, Mary calling out for them. He stands up and comes to meet her.
Watson smiled and shook his head. “I’m glad I managed to survive, then, if only to avoid your displeasure.”
They both freeze for a moment. He stares into those grey eyes that haven’t changed, still seeing every detail.
“Of course.” He regarded me with something like pity. “Sherlock, what you did might have kept him safe, but safety is something you cannot guarantee, however good your intentions. Do not blame yourself.”
Holmes gestures towards the empty chair. If they’re going to have it out again, they might as well be comfortable.
Holmes: I confess that though you do not possess genius yourself, you have a remarkable power of stimulating it in me.
“Those thing have always been live. This is recent. Live, televised theatre is just beginning to come back. Once, it was just the way television was made, but now it’s new again— immediate and authentic. Puts people on the edge of their seats, waiting to see somebody forget a line or trip over scenery. Tickets for the studio audience will naturally be priced accordingly.”
as he’s been calling it in his mind, he phones Harry. She might have read the papers, but his name was not revealed in the article. Holmes refused to allow the police to release it, and he must have some kind of pull with the Yard.
John laughed. “Nope. Too many paps lurking. In your refrigerator I found mustard packets, the hot kind that Chinese restaurants give you, soy sauce, a pack of cigarettes, and a very cloudy jar of olives. I disposed of the cigarettes because I think it’s unpleasant kissing a smoker and I intend to kiss you— a lot. Fortunately, some bloke came to the door. Didn’t even ring the bell downstairs so I guess he had a key. Handed me a box of food,
“I’ve already told you,” Sherlock snaps. “I’m not doing it!” He’s stopped clanging things, but now slouches into a chair with his tea.
It’s a gorgeous suit, more than I could ever afford, and it fits perfectly. How Mycroft knew my measurements— well, I’m going to have to check for cameras in the flat, I suppose.
When we arrived at the flat, my plan was to collapse on the sofa and take a nap while pretending to be in my Mind Palace. I was hoping John might join me and run his fingers through my hair. I would put on a shooting movie to lure him to the sofa.
It’s into the wee hours and neighbours are starting to complain. John’s eyes are on Sherlock, who is talking with Stefan and Andy now. Matt is giggling at something Sam is telling him, and Christopher is pulling off his wig, running a hand over his head.
The opening was the same for every episode, a thirty-second retrospective showing the arrival of an alien ship somewhere in Britain, accompanied by uninspiring, forgettable music and B-movie sound effects. The writers had never been specific about the location of the series, but it was filmed in Wales. The concept was boringly cliche, the ship a flying disk, the aliens tall and thin, their skin shimmering for no scientific reason. Several aliens beam down from the hovering saucer; their exploration is interrupted by the arrival of a police car. At once the visitors beam up, the ship abruptly departs— but one is left behind. In the succeeding montage of events from the show, Alex displaying his alienness in the context of a middle-class home and an ordinary school.
Holmes nods. “Systematic harassment goes on at many schools,” he says lightly. “Seems the most likely explanation. Our job is to uncover the system by which they have harassed this boy.”
“He put it into the fireplace, I think, intending to burn it. It must have blown out. The floor was where I found it. I saved it because… well, it didn’t seem right to destroy a thing like that, written with such loving care.”
And he could tell that John didn’t really like the salmon, but was just being polite. He obviously wanted something not on the menu, but was embarrassed to ask, and Sherlock had ordered the same to put him at ease because he didn’t really want anything but the mousse cake.
It wasn’t for want of trying. Over my years working with Scotland Yard, I’d come close to dying a few times. I’d had broken bones, nearly drowned twice, and was shot once. Always, John was there, reminding me that it was not yet time. I felt my years, but there were always cases to solve, ghosts who had stories to tell me, and I went on.
“Yes, we do have chemistry,” he agreed. “Our characters, though, will eventually become stale. Then they’ll decide to give one of us a love interest, probably me, and that will be the final nail in that coffin.
I went to live with my Uncle James and Aunt Kitty after that. She was my father’s younger sister, married to James Wentworth, who owned a glass factory. There was a great assortment of glassware in their house, a course of hazards for a child like me. In addition to being
He grinned and rose up on his toes to kiss me. “Ten years,” he said, slipping his arms around me. “We’ve done well, haven’t we?”
Edwin, too scared to enter the room, taunted me from the doorway. “Beggar in the house!” he chanted. “You’ll be begging to get out!”
He might have said the same thing about himself. John was the first person he had dared to love, the one who made him realise that he was capable of loving.
This was also the first time John had allowed anyone else to see him. Though they believed that the Red Room held ghosts, my cousins had not been aware of John, only his pranks. I saw now that John could control his visibility, appearing to them only if he wished.
“I assume no such thing. Traditionally, marriage is for procreation and a financially stable home for offspring. Even today, parents urge their children to marry partners with money, lest they be dependent on them forever. No, we start with my assumption, that money is involved.
In the ACD tale, as Holmes and Watson flee the scene, Watson is nearly caught, but shakes off the constable who has grabbed him. Lestrade describes to them the man they almost caught, and Holmes laughs, saying, “That’s rather vague. Why, it might be a description of Watson!” It was, of course. ACD might show his heroes breaking the law, but he would never let them get caught.
“Stop that!” I said this without much energy. “I can deny you nothing when you do that, John. You have me. I will never marry— you know that.”
“You were with a rather large group of people. Obviously your attacker took advantage of that, hiding in plain sight. I have already spoken with your friends; they didn’t see who you were last talking with. Damn, Watson! Don’t you know how easy it is to slip something into a glass? Never take a drink from a stranger, you imbecile.”
Wondering what kind of danger Sherlock is facing, how long it will last, whether he will make it home at all— these are the thoughts that keep me up at night. When I sleep, these are my new nightmares.
But he hasn’t really done anything about men. He has friends, like Murray, who are married or have girlfriends. A few who are unattached, like him. Are they gay, too? He doesn’t know. Internally, he still panics when he thinks about going to a gay bar and trying to pull men. He’s spent so long denying it that he has never learned how it works, socially. He can’t even say the words,
! Please, Watson— this is worse than I expected. The building itself is a sullen block of concrete, reminiscent of a prison, but I thought at least your cell would have some character. I am appalled that you live in such a… such a…” He looks around the room, as if hunting for a word that will announce what this is.
“Eventually, though—“ He sighed. "Holmes, I am not made like you. I mean, you may not have romantic feelings, but for me… That is…what I am trying to say is—“
The man who pushes the door open looks grimly determined. His greying hair is spiked, as if he’s been running a hand through it all night.
His own decision was that none of them were worthy of his notice. He would wait before bestowing his love on anyone.
“This is not you, Watson, however tidy it may be. It's joyless. It looks like one of those dystopian films where everyone lives in cells and gets their meals through a little slot in the wall, like letters. Cameras everywhere. Sirens go off and everyone takes shelter, waiting for Big Brother to address them.”
“Calm yourself, Watson. The trap is already laid. Shooting him, however satisfying, would have ruined the work of several months.”
It’s dark outside, and the windows are closed against the rain that never seems to stop. I hear it against the glass, waves of wet, sheeting off the bricks. Ordinarily it would sooth me into sleep, like white noise. Not tonight. It feels like I’ve been tossing for hours.
, he said, pointing at me. He was sure that I was a liar and should not be believed. I would break all of his toys and leave a mess.
he had learned that this was no joke. The police drama filmed just eight episodes a year, each filling a two-hour time slot. While this ought to have given him lots of time off to do other things, he soon realised just how many hours a script took to film. Most of that time was spent waiting.
It was an ordinary black cab, Sherlock noted. The meter ticked but did not advance. The man’s badge was displayed on the dash. Because the part of the brain that interprets written symbols does not work in sleep, he could not read the name. But the face was one he knew.
At the flat, everything seems as usual, but quieter. Mrs Hudson knocks quietly when she comes up with soup or biscuits and doesn’t stay to chat long. John is sleeping more than his normal seven hours. Including all the little naps, he’s averaging nearly ten hours a day. This is expected, given the severity of his injuries.
Bessie grabbed my arm and dragged me back up to the nursery, where she began to fuss over my hair and clothes. I had not buttoned my jacket rightly, I saw, and my stockings had a hole just below the knee. As she pulled at my hair, I listened to her frantic fussing.
This swimmer is alone, no boat. A mad loner, perhaps, trying to set some kind of record. As he approaches the shore, Holmes can see his arms moving, his face turning to take a breath every few strokes.
It was obvious that you had real talent, even though you were stuck in a silly story about an alien. You made Alex real, showed his vulnerability. You made people love your character.”
“I’m not so small,” Watson huffed. “Why must you always be pointing out that I’m short? Does it give you a feeling of superiority?”
Did John want an acting career? He had missed London, he said, and was tired of being dead. While Sherlock would be happy to keep him in his flat, pottering around and making tea, John would probably want to work. What shape that would take remained to be seen. And Sherlock would adjust to whatever reality John wanted.
“Yeah.” Sounds about right. “Wasn’t a very good murderer, though, was he? Said cocaine was poetic. Din’ even tape my mouth shut.”
It isn’t any trouble, really. A moment of exasperation that his lover, who has no doubt spent the day stretched out on the sofa doing nothing observably productive, couldn’t be arsed to walk over two streets himself, is soon replaced by a sense of contentment that he can do something useful for Sherlock.
“He killed Adam,” Charles says. “He wouldn’t leave him alone. They never do. They think they’re better. They hate people who aren’t like them, and nobody stops them from the things they do. Nobody does anything.”
This girl was in her early teens, short for her age, blond, blue-eyed, and wearing an Aran jumper. I deduced that she might be related to John Watson. Perhaps a distant cousin, a niece several times removed. She studied us back with equal curiosity.
Those all sound like reasonable things to do. For a person in his position, frankly, anything would be progress. But he wonders: what kind of
“Honestly, I don’t think it would matter at this point. There are actors who can carry that label and nobody is shocked. You might be one of those. You’re not a romantic lead, so they probably wouldn’t care. But I don’t recommend making an announcement any time soon. If you wait, you might become another Jeff Goldblum—“
I felt Watson’s hand on mine then, and opened my eyes to see him looking at me with concern. “All right?” he whispered.
He breathed in and out a few times and found, to his relief, that he felt fine, except for being rather stressed.
“You know I’m a doctor too, right?” he replies. “It’s safe. Safer than what I might prescribe for insomnia. Can’t hurt, might help.”
Like that, only more surreal. The scenes were filmed with real actors, and then drawn over digitally to make it more dreamlike. Even the sets were largely animation. When Magnussen abandoned the project, all of the original film disappeared, probably destroyed. The rotoscoped version might still exist; I’m sure Magnussen has it in a safe somewhere. The thing is, before the production had completely closed down, somebody pirated a copy of the rotoscoped version. You can still find it on the internet, if you know where to look.”
They walked out together. “They’re using the segment tomorrow night,” said Lestrade. “How many rumours do you think we’ll see popping up on social media?”
They warn him that Sherlock is a sociopath, but John puts that down to jealousy. They seem surprised that John would still be with him. And Sherlock has now disappeared, leaving him behind.
The door opens and Molly enters. To her credit, she doesn’t scream. She does faint, though, quietly dropping to the floor, her eyes rolling back. While he might flee now, be out of London before she calls Lestrade to report a missing corpse, Molly might also buy him some time. She always looks at him with affection, though he can hardly understand why. Her eyes are red now; she’s been crying, grieving for him. She won’t betray him. Really, he has no other choice.
Sherlock catches a cab and goes straight home. If John hasn’t picked up his things, he will wait. John will come, and Sherlock will apologise. They’ll talk. If he has to, he’ll even beg for another chance. He’ll tell John he’s been an idiot.
I had not been so near to a person as they passed from life to death; there was much I wanted to ask him.
After Mycroft left, Watson busied himself in the kitchen, washing and drying the tea cups, returning them to the cupboard.
“Not really. When I talked with the police, I remembered a few details. Mostly it’s a blur, though. Like a dream.”
“There’ve only been three victims so far that we know of, so it’s hard to say,” Lestrade says. “We don’t have a profile.”
The writers of the last season had been tepid, he thought, so having someone new might be good. But a love interest for Baz? That might not be good, depending on who they paired him with. And depending on who the writer was.
You have observed me at countless crime scenes, and have learned something thereby, I think. I ask that you apply my methods to the present situation. Milverton was clearly expecting someone. He was armed with a pistol because he knew this person wanted to kill him. The murderer, a woman who had been victimised by him, entered the house, shot him in the neck, and left.”
For a moment, he just stares at the paper, the angular yet elegant handwriting, and remembers sitting in the classroom, the chalk squeaking as Mr Hilliard wrote on the board, the smell of paper and books, the scraping of chairs on the wooden floor. Holmes sat across the aisle from him. Having been on the receiving end of his tendency to spout off embarrassing deductions, Watson hadn’t spoken to him. It was unnerving, though, knowing he was sitting there. He focused on copying down whatever Hilliard was saying. Why was Holmes not even taking any notes? By then he’d decided that all his claims of being a genius must be true, and that the other boys, even the poshest and most arrogant of them, were cheating off of him. And here was Watson, sitting so close that glancing across at his exam paper wouldn’t have required any obvious neck stretches. He’d assumed the note meant that Holmes was going to let him copy his notes, maybe even cheat off his next exam. A sure way to be expelled, if he were caught.
, but not nearly as good. I played a sexy nun who was pursued by the devil… well, you get the idea. Not something I’m proud of. I did it because I needed the money, and on the chance that I might find another job. And then I was cast in another movie, one that wasn’t so terrible. My third movie was the one that opened opportunities for me, and after that I didn’t have much trouble getting parts. I felt truly lucky, seeing all the other hopefuls who had made those first two movies with me still struggling.”
John steps back. “I’m serious. I don’t just want to sweep this all under the rug, go to bed and pretend everything is fine now. I need to say— I’ve been been a rubbish partner. Boyfriend, lover, whatever. Basically, I’m rubbish at being gay. Only I am, I guess. Gay, I mean. Or bi. I don’t know. I wasn’t attracted to that idiot murderer at the gym. And I don’t want Mary, though I’m willing to put up with her if I have to, so I can see my daughter. I only want
He understood that a first-name basis was assumed in interviews like this, and in the entertainment business in general, but disliked the intimacy it implied. The smile Morstan gave him meant mischief; she was known for her provocative interviews and probing questions.
While he’s staring at this scene in horrified fascination, Lestrade asks him a question. He replies,
It’s fear, she realizes. Once you’ve been rejected, it’s harder to trust yourself, to think you deserve another chance. It’s hard to trust someone to give you that.
Then Murray launches into another story about the delivery, making the whole thing sound like a three-ring circus with nurses twirling plates on poles and the star attraction refusing to come out. “You wouldn’t believe—“ he begins, giving Watson a look of horror. “Oh, well, you’re a doctor. I guess you would know about that.“
“I love you,” he whispered, remembering John on stage, holding his face, kissing him. “You. You’re everything.”
John’s RAMC mug is in the sink; he puts it in a box. The sitting room is full of his books, medical journals, his mail. In the loo he finds shampoo, soap, toothbrush, razor. Everything goes into the box. He folds the corners in and sets it out on the landing with the suitcase.
He looks a bit sorry, as if he believes that they might just have sex and forget about what’s happened.
“He does this because he gets off on it.” She gives him a chilly smile. “You’d better go. Freak’s calling you.”
“Your lot will not be much better now that you’re back,” I said. “I’ve been working cases, but not much is coming into our account. I’m not worried, though; we’ve been penniless before. I have no doubt that our luck will improve, now that you’re back.”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said. “It puzzles me, to be honest. He wasn’t dating anyone seriously, had broken off amicably with his last partner. He’d done several movies that were profitable for the studio and increased his box-office appeal. He had other projects lined up, enough money to live quite comfortably and call his own shots. His mother was dead by then, father also dead, never in the picture. He was free.”
“You are a fool,” she said to me. “You risk everything, and I am no longer willing to be your insurance policy. You might have gone into a respectable profession, but I have given up on that. You and your brother will receive nothing when I die. The entire estate will go to your cousin Alistair.” She paused, letting this sink in. “Because you are my son, however, I will give you one chance. If you marry, I may relent. And I do not mean a sham marriage to some older widow. You must marry with the intention of producing an heir.”
If the box contained the treasure, Miss Morstan would be out of his reach, too wealthy to accept his proposal. He would remain with me, at least for a while.
“He’s a good man, Sherlock. Not great, but good, which is infinitely more important.” He smiled, shaking his head. “I always hoped that I might one day see you become not merely a great man, but a good one as well. So you have. I am content.”
“She knew,” I growled, heading towards the hiding place. “She saw through my ruse, but played along. What gave it away?”
He slips into his coat, wraps his scarf loosely around his neck. “There’s something I have to look at. Some of the evidence.”
He hummed in reply. He was wondering if John would watch tonight. If he did, he wondered how John would feel about it, seeing them all reprising their roles and dedicating the whole thing to his memory. Would he feel guilty? Would he regret that he was in hiding, wish that he were on stage them? Maybe he missed those days when his best friend was an alien. Or maybe he was glad to put it behind him.
Maybe I’m an addict in my heart-of-hearts. I’ve always had that fear, that something would tip me into that dark place and I’d drown. That’s what happened to my father. And it’s happening to Harry, too.
Mrs Hudson giggled. "Oh, don't worry. There's all sorts around here. Mrs Turner's got married ones."
The priest is asking him, “Will you take this man to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?”
He smirked a bit. “Shall I tell you now? I suppose I am as certain as I ever will be. Very well. I have known you all your life, Sherlock. As your older brother, I spent more time with you than anyone else while you were growing up. You have always been dear to me, and a source of worry as I observed your character develop. It was around the time that our father died that I realised that in spite of your brilliance, you were not a very moral person.”
I take a couple days off from the surgery, but finally decide that I need something to distract me besides telly and Mrs Hudson’s chattering. I’ve let her think I’m ill, so she fusses, brings tea and biscuits and asks if I need anything at the shops.
On the day of my father’s funeral, the coffin was closed. I imagined him inside, his eyes shut, his face stern as always. I remembered how it felt when he used to lean down and look into my face in order to discern if I’d told a fib, how I’d always instinctively shrunk away from him because sometimes I wasn’t sure myself whether I was lying or not. The truth so often seemed like a lie, and lies were sometimes easier to understand. I knew that my father was dead, that a bullet had killed him, but I could not wrap my mind around what that meant or how it had happened. I had not seen, and could not imagine.
The barista was new. Not only new, but tall and gorgeous. Dark curly hair tumbled over his forehead as he smiled at John. “What can I get you?” His voice was like chocolate, dark and suggestive. His name tag said
“Oh, Mycroft!” I cried, restraining myself from embracing him. “Your kindness will be repaid— as well as the money.”
“I didn’t feel… anything for him. He was a boy who had an unfortunate life. Abusive mother, a jealous sister, a manager who didn’t look out for him. It’s a tragedy without any meaning. As I say, audiences prefer comedy. If there must be an unhappy ending, it has to mean something.”
Going back to the bedsit seems like too much, but it’s dark now, and he isn’t familiar with the neighbourhood.
Over the next twenty minutes, John begins to understand what Sherlock does. He’s brilliant, amazing, deducing the last hours of the victim’s life from the smallest details— her coat, her stockings, her shoes, her makeup and hair, the dampness of her coat, the flecks of mud on her legs.
He does all these things ruthlessly, swiftly, and with an inexorable, cleansing ire. His anger is not at John so much as at himself. John is an idiot; he couldn’t know that Sherlock can’t handle romance. Sherlock invited him to share a flat, to go on cases. Sherlock kissed him first. He can hardly blame John for accepting the invitation.
Staying in hospital is not an option; he leaves through the window, returns to Baker Street. The burns are already mostly healed. The broken bones are mending as well. He was in stasis for four days, assumed to be in a coma.
But John seems like a steady person. He has regular habits and urges regularity on Sherlock, reminding him to eat and sleep and dragging him out of the flat when he can’t move from the sofa. When they met, Sherlock perceived that he was suffering from depression, probably the result of his injuries and his divorce. Because he doesn’t talk about either of those things, it’s hard for Sherlock to know what his recent mood is about.
John sees a counsellor and arranges time with his daughter. Sherlock broods and jumps to conclusions.
Martha was a romantic; whatever she’d seen on John’s face all those years ago couldn’t have been adoration. A part of him wanted to believe it, but it was too late. Whatever John might have felt, it didn’t matter now, did it? He thought of the cabbie, and the fantasy his mind had spun that night. John was dead, and Sherlock had to accept that like a normal person.
I imagined running into him some twenty years hence. I would be prematurely grey, bent over before my time, out of work and living off my brother’s largesse.
“An apology? Will you send me a photo of your face right now? I’d like to see what an apology looks like on you.”
I waved a dismissive hand. “It is as I have always said, Watson. While sentiment is the natural state for a woman’s mind, it invariably biases a man’s judgement. I intend to sit up a while, contemplating the matter. Go to bed, Watson. We will discuss it in the morning.”
“Of course not.” He sighs, suddenly looking very tired. “Molly, thank you. This is going to take a while to sort out. I think I’ll head back to Baker Street. Thank you for the tea. And for… explaining.”
“I don’t know,” she replied. “It was a lot of pressure, being John Watson. He was such a genuine person, not really made for the celebrity he found. I think out of all of us, he was the one who most wanted to be a normal person. He started working when he was four, had his first break when he was seven.”
Turning my back to his torturer, I lay myself against his bloodied skin, my arms wrapping around him. He shudders; he can feel me.
Anticipating that Sherlock had no intention of observing the day, John imagined him growing a bit teary as he realised again how much John loved him. He wouldn’t make Sherlock feel bad about having forgotten, of course. He’d kiss him tenderly and say,
But I was not a normal person. As long as I had his bones, John would stay with me. I told myself it was for research purposes, having a ghost to observe close at hand, but it was really because I had missed him. He represented the happiest moments of my childhood. Placing a heavy lock on the box, I slid it under my bed, warning my landlady not to touch it. Had she known what was inside, she would have thrown me into the street.
His first instincts were right, he realises. He had regrets that first morning, but managed to push them aside in the first flush of having John. He saw it that evening in the restaurant, when John introduced him to his wife as his
“I should hope so. I like being useful to you.” Instead of going into the kitchen, he came to me and sank into my lap. “You’d be lost without me.”
There was love of family, an unavoidable love. And there was the love he would reserve for a girl who liked dead mice, which was an unlikely love. And there was courtly love.
Holmes and Wilkes were friends in school, weren’t they? And now, Wilkes is acting as if he has nothing but contempt for Holmes, as if he can’t believe that Sherlock actually has a someone he can call a friend.
fault, that I haven’t forgotten how he betrayed his brother, turning over personal information to Moriarty. And I advise him to fuck off.
Greg shuddered. “Ugh. Not fond of that bloke. These days he’s been looking like he’s got the best secret up his sleeve. That cat-swallowed-the-canary look. He’s better not have anything fucky planned for tonight.”
“I will convince Miss Adler to let me inside by a ruse. You will wait outside the house in a spot where you can see into the window. When I signal you thus, by waving my hand, you will throw
isn’t a thing. Sex is what gives you both pleasure, whether it involves penetration or not. Every couple has a different way of making love.”
At Baker Street, they sit on the stairs, getting their breath back, giggling at the ridiculous thing they’ve just done. John looks up the stairs, towards Sherlock’s flat, and wishes that he had a place like this to call home.
“The only thing I’m worried about is my stalker. If he makes one more remark about how he’s my biggest fan—“
“I’m fine, Mary— we’re both coping well, I think. I at least had the benefit of thinking about what was going to happen for a couple weeks before the reunion episode aired, and understanding what it would mean. Sherlock was blindsided, though.”
We squeeze hands across the table. I catch sight of Dennis, hovering nearby, looking like he’s waiting for an opening. I nod at him and he approaches.
“You’re on the continuum, with everyone else. Maybe you’ll find a comfortable spot along it, but it won’t be through deliberate choice. As for your new relationship, I sense that this is a person you feel some commitment to.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand. “But I did. Subconsciously, at least. It bothered me for days. When I found out my cabbie’s name was Jason Bradford, it seemed too much of a coincidence. The universe is rarely so lazy, John.”
Sherlock smiles grimly and shakes his head. “I don’t believe you. You have not yet realised it, but you want something else. Right now, you’re just indulging a fantasy. We could continue as we have for a few more months, I think, but eventually you’ll realise that you’d be happier if you and Mary reconcile. Or if not Mary, then you’ll meet another woman, at work, perhaps. At first you’ll believe that you’re not flirting, not responding to her obvious signals, and for a while it will seem harmless. And you’ll think about how much easier it is to love a woman. You can introduce her to people without being embarrassed. You already know how to live with a woman, how to have sex with her. And you might have more children. You’ll be surprised when you realise this, but you won’t be able to deny it because it’s true. And then you’ll come home and tell me we need to talk.”
After he’s cleared the dishes, he picks up his book. There’s a small telly in the flat, but he finds it depressing. It reminds him of the set that was always on when he was growing up, a constant background noise, his father lying on the sofa with eyes half-closed, staring at it. He loved his father, hated what he became. Never really abusive, he simply gave up. He might have encouraged his son to reach higher, but in every word he spoke, the implication was clear:
. Are you too muddled to remember that right now? It might be important if that nurse decides to question you. She’s a sharp one. Thinks I’m lying about our marriage, keeps trying to trip me up. Asked me your middle name, when your birthday is. Mine’s January the sixth, just so you know. There will be a quiz later.”
Finishing off the bottle of scotch is not what he wants, but it’s some kind of answer to a question he can’t quite form. He pours himself half a glass and admires the amber liquid, the way it slides down the sides of the glass, leaving shimmering trails. As the child of an alcoholic, he supposes he’s susceptible to that kind of beauty.
“It was dark, and she wore a veil. We had concealed ourselves in the alcove behind the curtain you observed. As for the murder weapon, you won’t find it. She took it with her. This is what the evidence tells us.”
He looks at his phone. Eight minutes after the hour. Well, it’s not like an appointment. People get to the pub whenever they get there. Murray’s bound to be a bit late; he’s only just come home on leave. John can sit here enjoying his beer, settling into the atmosphere.
Harry is living in Swindon now, in the house she bought with her girlfriend. Rather than answering her message, he takes the train down on Thursday after physio. If they are going to have a lengthy, pointless conversation about what’s wrong with him, he may as well have the satisfaction of glaring at her while she rants at him.
As he sits drinking his morning tea, Sherlock thinks about John Watson. Even without much prior experience, he knows that their date was a disaster.
“No. You loved him— you know I’m right, Sherlock. I don’t mean that you’re gay, but love isn’t always about sex. You loved him. You just pretended not to like him because you were afraid. I can see that now. That’s what you do, you push people away so they can’t know you. You pretend you don’t care so they won’t hurt you. What bothers you most about this reunion is that John’s gone. That’s why you’re angry.”
Sherlock slowly got to his feet and looked down at his attacker. “Well, you haven’t grown much, have you?”
I don’t dwell on my own grief; that has been solved, though like his wounds, it’s still tender. I tell him about Lestrade, who never gave up on him, and Molly, who kept his secret.
“Perhaps you should get some of your girlfriends to take up a collection and pay for it,” Holmes suggested. “The real mystery is why there are so many mattress stores. And why they all collect in the same strip malls, next to VCR repair shops and Beauty Supply stores. They must be fronts for something, maybe laundering money. And so many sales people loitering about. They’re like flies. Let’s go before they come over here and start persuading us.”
Mike and Molly were just being kind. It wasn’t Sherlock who needed a date. They could see how pathetic John is, and were trying to fix him up. Sherlock was only doing it as a favour to them. He could clearly have any man he wanted. Why would he choose a pathetic, boring, damaged army doctor?
How to Recognise a Disguise 101: hair colour, eyewear, facial hair, blend-into-the-crowd clothing. I do remember a few things Sherlock taught me.
This confirmed the feeling he’d been having. He hated giving in to paranoia, but when someone is actually stalking you, it’s not paranoia, is it? Still, he didn’t have any proof that Brook was anyone other than a somewhat overbearing fan.
Moriarty pauses, smiling. “We’re alike, yes, but not in the way you think. We both ruthlessly pursue what we want. Unfortunately, what you want is ordinary. You want John Watson. At this point, you don’t really care about the secret. You just want him back. And you’re willing to do anything for that, aren’t you?”
And now, her pathetic dream had come true. They were doing the episode she’d written (had probably been writing since she was fifteen), and the endgame was out in the open: Holly Martin would finally confess her love to Alex Tribble, and at last Molly Hooper would have her chance to kiss Sherlock Holmes.
Watson sighed and shook his head. “Moriarty has escaped, then. Holmes, this is not a trivial matter. That day he appeared in your study, he said as much. He will not let it go, even if his gang is broken. He will come after you. No, I’m not leaving your side. There is no errand important enough to take me away from you.”
John could see who the loser was going to be. As he danced with Sherlock, saw him smiling at him with such love, he hated that it wasn’t real. But it was too late. He had to go through with it, even if Sherlock wasn’t serious about any of it.
There was the time Lestrade found them at Angelo’s with a romantic candle on the table. He must have repeated this to everyone at Scotland Yard, because the next time John ran into Hopkins, she asked, “How’s your boyfriend?”
“But why, Watson? Women adore you— and you are always a bit flirtatious with them. I think you do it to annoy me. Your feelings towards females are softer than mine, and a marriage would give you an appearance of respectability. It can only help your career, something you must undoubtedly consider as you are about to set yourself up in practice. A wife would complete your life, whereas I can only complicate it. Why would you want to stick with me? I’m stroppy, unpleasant, untidy, arrogant, petty—”
John’s image was more carefully curated. He had perfect girlfriends, always looked the part of a teen crush. People made a lot of money on his every action, his words, his appearance. If he endorsed a soft drink, or a hair gel, or an acne cream, fans bought it. There was a lot of money tied up in his image, a lot of people counting on that money. His life was meticulously choreographed, every moment watched over by someone.
I heard nothing but my own heart beating and the air that rushed in and out of my lungs. Surrounded by the mist, I felt almost as if I might drown in it. I strained to listen, to see something. As I reeled, the mist rose; I lost any sense of up or down, within or without. I do not remember fainting, but that must be what happened.
“John.” I may have moaned this. It was hard to talk when he was nipping his way up from my collarbone to my jawline.
He met Sherlock Holmes at seven, as promised. The flat was rather nice, though cluttered with boxes. Still, anything was better than the bedsit. And Sherlock was an intriguing man, as well as a handsome one. Possibilities there, perhaps.
Many beds lined the narrow dormitory; all the children seemed asleep, though it was far too cold for me to be comfortable under the thin blanket I’d been given. Shivering, I wished I had asked for another blanket, but each student had one and only one, and I knew I must be grateful for that poor gift. This was not a place where one was meant to be comfortable. It was a school where humility was enforced and the flesh mortified. That is what I was told by the man who showed me to the room where I was to sleep. He was young, with a thin, sallow face, a junior teacher. He told me that I would be in his group, and that tomorrow he would assess my ability to read and do arithmetic. I had no worry about this.
There must have been some dark corners in the sunny landscape he presented to the world, but Sherlock could not imagine him taking his own life.
And years later, when they reminisced about their life together, they told each the same stories— summers at the shore, the first kiss at the infirmary. They remembered saying goodbye when John left for Afghanistan, and the happy reunion when he returned. It was odd, but after a while it didn’t matter that they hadn’t met when they were seven or snogged in the pantry. By the time they had their golden anniversary, the story had become their truth.
“I prefer to text,” he replies. He’s looking at Watson, who is standing at parade rest, looking back at him. His old friend/enemy/lover has thinned out some, which tells Holmes he’s been injured and then ill with an infection. Maybe he’s really done with the army now and will be content to follow Holmes to crime scenes and write up their adventures. That would be enough, he thinks.
Mr Grimshaw looked down at me from his lofty height. “Would you like to go to school, Master William?”
Still awake, half asleep, a state where dreams might seem real, where you might question whether something really happened.
“I have much to confess to you, as well.” Tearfully, he laughed. “We are a couple of rogues, aren’t we?”
And the whole time Holmes was deducing him, telling their classmates that Watson wanked to pictures of Johnny Depp, he was probably wanking to equally embarrassing pictures. He was walking around the Priory campus, gayer than a picnic basket, checking out guys and rating their hotness, lying in bed at night and fantasising about that boy in maths class.
John lay strips of bacon in one pan, then cut a chunk of butter into the other pan and began cracking eggs into a bowl.
Pulling me closer, Sherlock wraps himself around me, and soon we’re together in a warm cocoon. Sherlock relaxes, but he’s not asleep. His eyes are open, looking at me in the darkness.
He’s trying, really trying, to be the old John Watson. Some days it feels like he’s reaching the top of that hill, and other days it feels like he’s just been kicked back down to the bottom.
I guessed that I was the first living human he’d seen in a while, that his ghost had remained here, in this shut-up wing. What had he done all this time? What had happened to his parents? Did he know he was dead?
“Because you like him. And I’m pretty sure he likes you, too. Just ask him. Meet him for lunch. Everybody eats, right?”
, not because he was afraid of the fallout if he refused, but because Molly and Mike and Greg, and even Phil and Sally, were the closest thing to friends that he’d ever had. They understood his life without asking, without him needing to say a word.
, we were both under a lot of pressure from all sides,” John said. “We didn’t spend any time together outside of rehearsals and filming, so we never talked about it. It would have been rough, I think, if we had tried for a relationship.”
Aside from the man’s brilliance and his ability to rub people the wrong way, John hasn’t deduced much. People dislike Sherlock, insult him and call him
I wish I could remember more about that night I spent in the Red Room. I think I must have fallen asleep at some point, but I don’t remember what led up to that. I only remember waking in the morning to the sound of someone jiggling the key in the lock. The door opened, and there stood Miss Garvey and my three cousins.
“Immensely.” I pulled his trousers down and pushed him into the chair where Miss Morstan had been sitting. “I don’t share, Watson.” I took his prick in my mouth, running my tongue around the head, already glistening with fluid.
“Good.” Matt considers him for a moment. “I’m glad you’re coming, John. Oh, and there’s a contest. Everyone has to choose a song to lip-sync. Only seventies music.”
Mrs Crawford wipes her eyes with a handkerchief. “He won’t talk about it. I don’t see how— if we can’t get him to open up, how is a complete stranger going to do it?”
I had grown old. My family was gone, except for my nieces. Greenwood Manor was sold when my cousin Edwin finally died of alcoholism, the glassworks long bankrupt. What little was earned from the sale came to me. I used the proceeds to buy myself a cottage in Sussex Downs, where I now planned to live.
take holidays, Holmes! Do not make me ask again— just tell me what has happened. Why do you suddenly want to leave London?”
“For the heir to any throne, that could simply mean that they were photographed together. It does not imply anything indecent.”
,” John said, exasperated. “And I’ve been telling you: tea. It comes in bags. You put it in hot water and let it steep.”
“William,” he said. “Do you think the world will be kind to boys who are lazy and uneducated? It seems to me that Mr Anders is doing us a favour by preparing us to meet what surely lies ahead for boys like us. We should thank him.”
“I don’t have friends.” I huffed out a breath. “I have just one: John Watson. Of course I value you.”
Dr Huxtable is standing with Holmes now. Watson remembers him as a younger man, a literature teacher when he and Holmes were students. He’s in his fifties now, his hair thinning, his features sagging. He looks completely devastated. Wilkes is nowhere to be seen. Holmes is nodding as Huxtable speaks, and they shake hands when they part.
Who even uses words like that? It makes them sound like they wander the streets at night with bats, looking for people to beat up.”
“Me too.” John laughs. Not a full giggle, but Sherlock sees him relax a bit. “I don’t love you in spite of you being a man, or because of it. I just love
“I’m glad. You seemed a bit lonely. The nurses have been vying for your attention, so I thought I’d just step to the head of the line and see if you were interested.”
Sherlock wasn’t much on sitting around, but he wouldn’t even be in this scene, so he said nothing more about it. The dialogue was mostly backstory and exploration of character conflicts.
He arrived at the final rehearsal still in a dark frame of mind, and noted the looks a few of the cast members were shooting at him.
When he thinks about Mary, he’s angry. She was the one who insisted on marrying when they found she was pregnant. He’d never wanted all of that, wasn’t ready for that kind of responsibility. Even so, he’d shouldered the blame, taken a vow, and done his best. In the long run, all it had gotten him was a letter.
John shakes his head and does not sit. He stands silent, clenching and unclenching his hands, looking at Rosie. His voice is quiet when he speaks; he always sounds calm when he’s really angry. She knows.
His distress began when he realised that he was in love with Victor. He’d been drawn to boys before and had no doubt that he was gay. Mycroft had noticed too, and had warned him.
Now that he’s back, he still sees their faces. Some days, he envies the ones who didn’t come home. It’s a terrible thought, that death might be preferable to the life he now lives, the life people risked their own to save. An ungrateful thought.
John wakes up with a headache and gut pain. He hasn’t anything but paracetamol in the flat, so he takes that. For most of the day he lies on his bed and tries not to think about last night. He doesn’t check his bank balance or call his sister. More bad news is the last thing he needs.
The authoritative woman with the half-glasses handed me a small piece of paper with a phone number written on it. “We tried reaching her mother. She doesn’t answer.”
Ms Morstan sounded like she was at the end of a very short rope. “If you give me your address, I’ll come and get her.”
He observes Watson, constantly, though he pretends not to, looking away the moment Watson notices. It’s unnerving— and oddly flattering.
“He’s a doctor. An army doctor.” He runs down the remaining stairs. “Mrs Hudson! He’s a doctor!” He grabs her and plants a kiss on her forehead.
I was so engrossed in the article that I didn’t even hear Mrs Hudson letting someone in, didn’t realise I had a visitor until I looked up and saw my brother Mycroft coming through the door.
He throws some bills at the driver. Once inside, he takes the stairs two at a time. Halfway up, he can see that the suitcase and box are still there. The door of his flat is open, and maybe John has come back.
John clears his throat. If he hears them saying rude things, he usually jumps into the fray, tells them off in a Captain Watson voice, his remarks including a lot of profanity. But this John Watson is different, and Sherlock doesn’t expect him to speak up. It’s fine. Sherlock doesn’t need a protector, though it’s nice to have one.
It wasn’t all, he suspected. John Watson was alive in this world, and that wasn’t something he could forget. There wasn’t a moment when he didn’t imagine John holding a cricket bat, about to brain him. John, his voice rough and hurt, asking,
. In this case, however, her delusion will be quickly forgotten. Now, then. The plan. We will burgle Milverton’s house tonight. According to Edith—
It went on and on, the two of them borrowing every romantic trope that had ever existed, trying to outdo each other.
“Come on, Holmes!” Watson motioned, still holding his revolver. “Don’t stand amazed— the household is awake and the police will soon be swarming the grounds! Move!”
“What?” Watson looks around. His eyes are bleary, but the place looks just as it did when he left for the pub. “I tidied up.”
From the vantage point of fifteen years on, it looks like a genuine offer of to tutor him. Arrogant, yes. Insulting, for sure. But he wonders now if that isn’t just how Sherlock Holmes manages his world.
, but I can see that you have once again attempted to tinge it with—“ He draws a breath, not sure where his sentence is going.
He catches sight of Holmes, who is talking with a member of the local constabulary. The scene has been secured and photographers are documenting the body and the surrounding area. Holmes has already done his own examination. When he sees Watson, he comes over to where he is waiting.
“I’m no longer a boy, Holmes, and neither are you. We’ve known one another for years. You’ve put me through medical school, given me everything you promised. Don’t ask me to leave you now, not when I owe you so much.” His eyes shone with tears. “If you fear something is going to happen to you, at least keep me at your side. I could not forgive myself if I went off and left you, not even if you order me to go.”
The image of himself lying in an alley with his entrails spilling out gives him a hard shudder. He’s seen plenty of disturbing things in his time in Afghanistan, but that was a war zone. Last night was just an evening out with the mates, harmless fun, loud music and too much alcohol.
The bed is chilly. Sherlock hasn’t come to bed, and John is pretty sure he won’t. He played his violin for an hour and is now sitting out there, sunk into his chair, brooding. Eyes closed, he did not acknowledge John when he said he was going to bed.
When I opened my eyes, a child knelt before me. I guessed his age to be close to my own, perhaps a bit younger. He had pale hair that seemed to drift around his head like a halo and wide, blue eyes. His skin was very white. Holding out one ghostly hand, he touched my hair; the cold went through me again.
“This conversation, though interesting, is keeping me from business which awaits me,” I replied. “I’ll bid you good afternoon, Professor.”
The kiss was a mistake, he realised. He should have just told Victor that he didn’t want to see him again, that they weren’t friends, and could never be friends because Sherlock wasn’t a person who
He looks around the small living room. All new furniture, less dowdy, in pale neutrals. The old carpet is gone, replaced by an off-white rug woven in a geometric pattern. It’s like a house you’d see in a magazine, spare and monotone. The sofa looks less comfortable than the old one. That’s where he’ll sleep tonight, he guesses.
Mycroft stands up and puts his coat on. He holds out his hand to his brother. “Good luck. Reach out when you need me.”
That time, maybe it was more about his wife. If he seemed uncomfortable, it could be because she made him uncomfortable, swanning over to the table with the man she’s left him for. She was showing off, looking for a reaction from him. He wanted to her leave, not provoke more questions from her.
Again, I awoke. I felt cooler now and able to swallow, in spite of the pain in my throat. The nurse told me I’d been ranting in my sleep, calling out for someone named John. She assumed he was a brother; I did not explain.
This is dangerous ground. Somewhere in his libido lies something that he’s thought about. Maybe he’s even fantasised about kissing a man. Having sex with a man. Just a lark, maybe. Don’t lots of men go through that? It doesn’t mean anything.
It’s a pitifully small life. When he thinks back to his days at uni, there was always someone to have a pint with, to hang out with and tell stories, or pull girls, or just get roaring drunk with. Not much point in any of that, either, when he thinks about it. It seemed good, though, letting loose, when he spent most of his time studying.
In the building where I lived, I met a ghost, a young woman, who was carried inside after being hit by a runaway carriage. I learned her story from the charwoman who cleaned my rooms. Flora Buckle was her name, and she had expired in the room below mine. When I say
When he sees the small army doctor follow Mike Stamford into the lab, he deduces him silently, as his habit is. Few people enjoy being deduced out loud, so he generally saves that for crime scenes and interviewing suspects.
No score there. He tries again. “Why are you so late? I didn’t know if you would even be here for dinner.”
Sherlock looks unconcerned, John thinks, even smiling a bit. Perhaps he’s become impervious to their jibes and insults, but to John it’s unprofessional and an insult to Sherlock, who gets no fee from the Met for his work.
Sally Donovan and Philip Anderson had played the stereotypical mean kids, Todd and Vivian, who thought Alex was weird and were always looking for ways to embarrass him. Sherlock had played his character as naive, but unfazed by their ridicule. Since he himself had often been made fun of in school, he’d developed something of a protective shell, using insults and arrogance as his primary weapons. Alex was different, though; he never bothered humiliating bullies. In the context of the show, the strategy worked. In real life, he found it useless to put up with idiots.
As he trudged up the stairs to his own flat, he thought about his options. Not just for this evening, but for the future, something he hadn’t cared much about when he started acting. He had turned twenty-eight in January, having survived drugs, and it looked like he might actually make it to thirty, a number he’d never thought to see ten years earlier. He had a brighter career than most actors his age. If he made good choices, he could expect to get leading roles until he was ready to retire. This was what he’d dreamed of when he gave up the drugs and started his career in earnest. Any way you measured it, he’d arrived.
We headed down to the street. Mrs Hudson stood by the door in her wrapper, looking concerned. “Mr Holmes,” she said. “What has happened? Is the doctor all right?”
“You said you don’t have friends,” he begins. “You surrounded yourself with enemies. Didn’t you ever wish, though—“
“A love affair, Watson. She is a spinster, a woman of great size but no great charms, who has fallen in love with a man interested only in her fortune, though that is the smallest thing about her. So, a small-scale bigamist, perhaps, looking for a gullible, insecure woman. She has doubts, but wants me to tell her this man is her true love, and will hear nothing against him.”
“It was a blind date. A friend of a friend in common. I had made up my mind to be open to new things, after… it was after I was wounded, when I thought I might die. After I got the letter from my wife saying our marriage was over. It was weird. I was angry and sad, but I also had this weird sense of liberation. When I got back, my friend Mike wanted to set me up with someone, and asked if I was open to dating a man. I said yes.”
“Practical, under the circumstances. It gave me some control over them. Look, you can stop the martyr act. People are horrible. You’re not the only one who’s—“ He makes an impatient gesture. “Our stop is coming up. We’re going to meet the parents of this boy and try to ask him some questions, if he’ll talk. I need to think about that now.”
