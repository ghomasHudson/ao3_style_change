He said all this without looking at me; his gaze was fixed on his lap, his expression ambiguous. I thought I might venture a little more. “Were you still at home then?”
"Marvelous," he said, gently. "I shall hold you to that. But remember I am quite uninformed. Who is trying to kill you? What will be over in a few days? Whose trial will Mycroft ensure?"
“Come in,” said my boy, muzzily, from behind a fragile and enormous map of old Yorkshire, dated 1774, which he was studying for purposes as yet undisclosed but apparently enthralling.
"On the contrary,” I answered, “I think it is evident that I do. Pray take a chair. I can spare you five minutes if you have anything to say.”
After four months he began to smile a bit when I teased him, and read aloud with me in the evenings, and even consented with a laugh to accompany me to dinner when I asked as prettily as I could. After five months he had re-established his practice at a new set of rooms in the center of the city, and begun seeing to the health of the Irregulars in his spare time, as well as the recovery of as many as he could reach on his Saturday charity calls. Sometimes he still sat blank-faced, slumped at his desk, staring down at the empty sheet which had been meant to receive a story from his pen. But then he would shake himself, and stand, and fetch his walking-clothes, returning after some hours abroad with a look that was somber, but clearer; and watching his efforts, I began to feel we would recover him after all.
I had. I had shouted it at him. We hadn’t spoken of it since, Heaven curse my spineless reticence. I could have wept before him. “Forget that, if you can—please. I’ve rethought my position. I’d be proud to stand in court for—if there was no consequence to you, I’d be more than glad, for you—”
His whole face changed. “Do you think she would think so? She mustn’t. But to admit I’ve never found my way to love her as I ought—I promised her everything!” His eyes were filling up with grief. “There must be some way to help myself—a specialist, a chemical aid, a treatment of some kind. I ought to try. She is good to me.” He looked at me, pleading, and my heart sank. What he wanted seemed unlikely. If a help for this kind of problem existed, would the creator not be known? Wouldn’t John have heard of it already in the course of his studies? But I was not a doctor; and I had never sought a medical correction to the course of my own development.
It took me three cigarettes and a considerable amount of self-scolding to begin: every word I could offer him seemed a poor, weak thing. "Forgive me"—for leaving him without a word? How could I ask it? "Believe me"—that there had been no better choice? I had found none, but that scarcely justified me. "Come to me"? It was all I wanted, but clearly he could not, or the entire point of my flight was made moot. In the end I only told him the facts as they had happened, and tried to write out a little of my useless regrets. "I would very much like to hear from you," I added at the last, "at least to know that you are all right, and will take particular care of yourself until I can see you. I will promise to be as careful as I can if you will do the same.”
“Then go! For goodness’ sake. I don’t mind. I’m pleased you told me the truth. And not just because it was flattering,” as he opened his mouth to speak. “I should be horribly sorry if you were to become afraid of me now. I like you to be honest with me. It’s the best chance I have at loving you well.”
Unexpectedly, he laughed at that. His laughter is a sound so perfect, I take it like an arrow to the breast. I blinked.
“All right. Ordinarily I should argue the point, but I understand the circumstances are—difficult. That said, I should like to be quite clear, Holmes. Do you mean to say that if you successfully bring this man to court and a charge, I may kiss you?”
He had ceased smiling. “All that I have to say has already crossed your mind,” he said, and took a step nearer.
“Oh.” I stared at the firm line of his shoulders, the bowed head, and tried to grasp this. “Oh, that’s--well. That’s significant.”
“We’ll pursue other avenues, I suppose,” I said, vaguely, when Holmes stayed silent. “I’ll wire you when we’ve struck something.” Holmes still didn’t look up, but raised an incredulous brow. “Well, I’ll wire you when we need you,” I amended myself. If Lestrade caught the implication he chose not to be insulted by it.
“Yes.” Sherlock looked as though he were in pain. “Thank you, Mycroft. I suppose--that is sufficient information. We can’t go to the wedding, of course. It wouldn’t be safe.”
“Lock it up, will you?” he said, softly. “Keep hold of the key. I’ll tell you if I need it.” And he laughed at the look on my face. “It’s all right, Holmes. I want to stop pressing my luck, and have a little hope.”
“If I must,” she conceded, but doubtfully. “I’ve got a double batch of bread in, now, but that’ll be done in an hour. I suppose I could sleep over at Dolly’s.”
“You are a lifelong distraction,” I said. It was an absurd rejoinder, but he let out a laugh that was nearly a sob, and took my face in his hands again. After that there was no talking.
He had thrown everything on the bin, then gone sulking in the bath, pulling his head under the water as long as he could. He immerged with a profound inhale, feeling very dizzy. But he was still thinking about that treatment, so he tried again and again, each time trying to stay longer under the water. He concentrated on the feeling of bubbles coming out of his mouth and nostrils, his heart pounding hard on his chest, his lungs slowly filling with carbonic gas, until his mind was blissfully blank.
Halfway down the stairs, Sherlock realized that he was still dressed in the dark pristine costume he usually wore during the day.
He sat up straighter to write in his notebook his observations: The evolution of his experiment and the current time, which was 2 am.
So he huddled up even more on Sherlock’s embrace, turning his head to put his lips against Sherlock’s temple.
He was nervously clenching his fist when he entered the restaurant, easily finding the detective alone at one of the most secluded tables.
Sherlock blurted a sigh of exasperation as he deported himself on the left to avoid being crushed by a couple who was arguing about the gift for their respective mother-in-law The young dancer despised crowded stores, even more than John did. But when the other teen had asked him to come he just couldn't have said no, because it meant that John was at least talking to him again. And it wasn't like John had talked to him much in the last 2 weeks. In fact, since that night, since that party, things had been pretty tense between the two friends.
Wobbling a little from alcohol (he had tried to make her shut up by getting her drinks after drinks, and it was finally her full bladder who had allowed him to escape) he staggered unto the sofa, letting himself fall next to Irene. The girl’s wig was a bit awry and her lips and cheeks were noticeably more pinkish than earlier. Kate was curled at her side, her fingers intertwined with Irene’s ringed ones.
“It's impossible in central London, John,” said Sherlock with a muffled voice, “The light of the city makes the sky too bright for us to dicern-”
John remained frozen in place, mouth open in horror as Sherlock reached for the door, which only rattled when he tried to turn the handle. They both tried to open it, but gave after a few minutes, hands stiff with cold.
His mind was numb for a couple of hours, barely noticing when Mycroft arrived and sit at his side, putting a cup of coffee next to his chair. The dark liquid was already cold when Greg came and went, talking lightly with Mycroft about some deposition that John would have to make at the Yard in a couple of days.
Sherlock took a deep breath. Molly, a university comrade, was always saying that he was sexy in his purple shirt. No time like the present to test that theory.
Sherlock’s voice seemed unusually loud in the emptiness of the night and the faint buzz from the electrical cabinet.
“I know, I'm really sorry.” John looked at his feet, bringing his courage, “But I've asked you to come because I want to-Sherlock?”
But every now and again, he asked himself if maybe putting a little bit of effort in his clothes could be a good idea? Even if Sherlock had never said anything regarding this subject (and he never dared to ask, how pathetic would it be?) some of the glances he caught during their last date had made him cogitate.
“If you said so”, said John, still slightly out of breath. They were making their ways to the exit when a loud slamming noise made them flinch. They looked at each other with worry.
John had always regarded formal wear as constricting, inconvenient, and uncomfortable; nothing that he wanted to deal with in his life. He rarely bothered to buy new clothes, even more rarely tried them before buying. If his clothes were keeping him warm and decent, that was what he was looking for, and he was content with it.
He stored this line of thoughts for later and came to stand awkwardly next to the table, lips dry as he waited Sherlock's reaction. The detective could only blink for a full minute, his eyes making up and down motion as he detailed his lover's appearance.
John caught up with him and they stood in the dark hallway, trying to calm their frantic breaths, both attentive to the tiniest noise.
Sherlock didn't even move at this display of testosterone. He simply rattled the door one last time and listened to the dull sound it made when pushed.
But he had built confidence over the years, and his mischievous smile and acidic humor had seduced over three continents before winning Sherlock's love.
He was in no mood to mess around with prepping his bunny. His cock was already rock hard. If he didn’t get inside of him he was going to lose his mind. He put the huge broad head against the tight little hole and started pushing in.
The bunny gave a pain filled whimper. His wolf chuckled and laid down next to him. The bunny sure did a lot of crying about things he enjoyed.
“You shouldn’t hang out with them!” Luna said in shock. “Karen does drugs. She only came here because she got kicked out of her old school.”
The wolf curled up against his lover as tight as he could get. It was almost as if he was trying to sneak away from the pain inside of him. He needed to get away from it!
That was the pattern for the next few days. She only took Wednesday night off. She had violin practice after school and her parents liked to hear her improved playing after dinner. Rosie didn’t mind missing out on her drug fueled study session.  She loved playing for her parents. She hoped that one day she would be as good as her Papa.
Sherlock took a deep breath as he rose up half way off his lover’s length. He let out the air as he slammed back down. Pain shot up his spine as the cock was forced back painfully deep inside.
The wolf opened the container that held the small suppositories. He took out three before shutting the lid. There was no reason to put it off. John lifted his leg and placed it on the closed toilet. He pushed his tail out of the way and slowly pushed the first one in.
Sherlock didn’t want a nap! He didn’t care how badly it burned inside of him. He wanted more of John.
The wolf knew what his bunny needed. He knelt back down and wrapped his hand around his erection. He barely had to touch it before his little bunny cock exploded. Sherlock let out a long cry as his body was rocked with an intense orgasm.
John smirked as he began to slam as hard as he could inside his sweet bunny. The smooth, tight passage was gripping his mammoth throbbing hard wolf cock with everything it could. The lube from earlier had dried up but his cum was working just fine.
WIthout anymore warning, John began to pepper Sherlock’s backside. Sherlock started to cry right away. Normally his bunny tried to hold his tears back. It must have been his illness that took away his self-control. John felt horrible with each wack but he knew Sherlock needed it. The bunny didn’t like listening to him.
John felt his knot beginning to deflate. Sherlock closed his eyes and snuffled as his wolf began to move again. He was going a bit slower this time but it still hurt. His wolf opened his jaws and brought his teeth down on his neck.
Panic began to grip him. Was John going to take him right in front of all these people? A pretty rosy flush spread over his face.
Despite the fact she did have friends and a girlfriend Rosie still felt like an outcast. Her girlfriend, Luna, was a quiet girl who didn’t like crowds. That wasn’t a problem for Rosie. She respected her partner’s needs and wants. The only problem was it didn’t leave Rosie much of a chance to hang out with her other friends.
Sherlock knew there was no point in fighting his mate. If he did that would only make the wolf angry and he might hurt him or someone else. His pink ears flopped down on over his pale, flushed face as he tried to hide. He didn’t want anyone to see him in this humiliating position.
“John, you always manage to 'forget' them on the locker rooms after practice or have them 'stolen' in less than a week after Christmas anyways”, countered Sherlock.
, he replied; instinctively using one of Sherlock’s favorite comeback, I just want to know what the other had found for Harry, so I don't buy her the same thing.”
Back at Baker Street, he climbed the stair in silence, unwilling to wake Mrs. Hudson up. He wasn't injured, and Sherlock was unavailable to the word until next morning, so there was no need to worry her.
In 20 minutes, Sherlock had deduced the height, shoe size, stance and favorite meal of the burglar, the probable place of next robbery, insulted the whole London police force as well as made the CEO secretary flee the office in tears after he revealed that her boss has clearly no intention to leave his wealthy wife for her.
He made a flapping noise with his “wings” trying to emphasise his point. But John only smiled harder.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Why did everyone have to be this stupid? He found the frame of the man in the crowd.
The young woman shifted slightly, leaning on the sofa toward him. She put her hand on John's arm, pinning him with her intense glare.
“I know what I said, Sherlock”, snapped John. His companion shuddered at his side, his eyes worried under his wild mass of dark auburn curls. John seemed to catch himself and winced. He sighed deeply and came again. “Sorry. It's just... I know I should have come sooner. With all these people, it will be hard to find a gift for Harry.”
Sherlock detailed the boy’s face, trying to discern suspicion or malice, but he only saw honest astonishment, with a hint of interest.
“You think I'm a small man with hairy feet, who love nothing more than to eat and stay at home all day long?”
Sure, other people had called him brilliant before. He was a genius after all, with an IQ higher than most of the people in this country. But that boy had seemed to genuinely find him interesting. For once in his life, Sherlock had wanted things to be different.
Sherlock had went home in state of shock and confusion, playing and replaying the scene for hours in his bed that night and all the night ever since.
Inside, it was a swirl of customers rushing for last seconds gift at it was only days before Christmas. On the alleys, children were running excitedly with parents shouting at them, arms full of wrapped boxes. At the entrance, a blond teen was standing with a bemused expression on his face.
The mother didn't even turned toward him, the cry of her baby in his stroller covering the teen voice.
“Totally. She had already put the gift under the Christmas tree. It was hardly a difficult deduction”.
John forced a pinched smile. “I wish we were somewhere else. Like, warm at home in front of the fireplace, you see?”.
Sherlock was waiting for the usual reaction: threats, swearing, or even a punch, but the boy only looked at him in awe, mouth open. To his horror, Sherlock felt himself blushing. He was so used to be told to “piss of” that he was unable to proceed in front of this obvious display of admiration.
Sherlock nodded, carefully avoiding pointing that was exactly what the other teen had said the year before, and the year before that one. In fact, it was what John had said every year since Sherlock had been friend with the young rugby player. Why John kept being late was beyond his comprehension: his sister's birthday was the 22
That how he ended in a posh shop, the address recommended by Mycroft, with his personal saleswoman focused on him. It took her 10 seconds to destroy all of his illusion about how he even have an idea of what would flatter him.
The feeling lingered for a couple of hours, before blues eyes and a bright smile were coming back to his mind, the boy’s voice echoing on his head.
It has been a wild chase as the killer, accustomed to the area, had tried to sown them in the maze of factories’ alleys. First on his heels, John and Sherlock had chased him, but had underestimated his ingenuity. The killer had hid in a dark corner of a warehouse to set them a trap, witch both of them fallen right into it.
“Well, if you were Gandalf, you'll have to wear a beard, a cape and a walking stick, and yell thing like ‘run you fool’ or ‘you should not pass’ with a deep and cavernous voice”, replied John with a knowing smirk.
He immediately leaned with his back against the door, holding his breath. What was wrong with him? He was a float of words yesterday night, and now he only managed 2 sentences? If he hadn’t already convinced other boy of his insanity, his last words will surely do the job.
“Sure? I've crossed path with Anderson, a guy of the 3rd floor, and he was yelling they should find us hotel rooms as the firefighters were going to spend the night here.”
“Tonight is the perfect night to do it! Flirt, use your imagination and your charms. Tell him that you want him to put fire to your forge, to find your Arkenstone, to claim you Lonely Mountain, to become...”
But the truth was, it had been different. The blond boy had looked at him with interest, stayed friendly, even after Sherlock had rudely deduced him. He had even called him brilliant.
“I know,” interrupted John gently with a shrug, “It's just... I would have been more romantic, you know? Cuddling under the stars...”
And the coat! John had fantasizes about that coat alone. The heavy fabric was perfect to grab the infuriating detective for shut-up kisses, making his lips the same shade as the red buttonhole, the collar turned up to echo the sharp line of his cheekbones.
But, unsurprisingly, the two of them were once again separated as soon as they put a foot in the alley of the 2
Sherlock repressed a shiver, shifting on the high chair in front of his microscope. His kitchen was uncomfortably cold, but he had to maintain low heat and a high level of humidity to study the mould he was working on in optimum conditions.
“Hey, it's ok. No worries, it’s… it’s really ok,” interrupted John, reassuring him with a gentle wave of hand.
He sent their location to the DI phone, listening to his mutter as he located them on his car’s GPS.
Sherlock only frowned deeper, finding John’s gleeful smile infuriating. Sherlock knew the teenager was pleased with their costumes and was in a hurry to show them around at the party, but honestly, Sherlock didn’t see what was incredible neither with his own nor with John’s costume. Sure, his coat was kind of nice, the burgundy color marching Sherlock’s costume, and John had neglected his monthly visit to the hairdresser, letting hair strands slightly wave around his face. But why did the chestnut colored pant had to be cut short? Plus, the October night was chilly, and John only wore flesh-colored ballet slippers with fake hairs glued over. It was rather impractical. And couldn’t he stop playing with that fake gold ring already?
“Yes, Irene helped me with the costume. She wanted me to dye my hair red, but I don't think my mom would have like it. But you still recognize me as an elf, yes?”
“Oh, not you this time, dear! I think it comes from one of the higher flats. But we need to get out! The firefighters are evacuating the whole building”.
John couldn't help grinning thought the dinner. He felt warm and giggly as Sherlock's fingers kept brushing on his wrists while he played with the ridiculous cufflinks, his mind getting clouded by desire as they shared small talks and a delicious bottle of French wine.
That meant that John had wanted to find him, and so had to ask for Sherlock's flat number, because Sherlock hadn’t put his name on his door, only letting the gold 221 hang. So surely the other neighbors had been so happy to told John about his worst habits, and yet he had persevered, had found him and was now asking him for a coffee.
He had to left Sherlock's side when they reached the hospital, only to be put in the waiting room, as soon as the paramedics had been assured that the blood on his shirt was Sherlock's and not his own.
“Vanished, damn it!” swore John. “Do you want to try to come down? Maybe we can try to catch him at the entrance?”
“Yeah!” the exclamation was completely sincere “you’ve really guessed that only from her shirt and deodorant?”
“Do you think it’s going to take long?” asked the blond boy after a moment “I’m new in this neighborhood, I don’t know the protocol here.”
Tonight, even more than laterly, Sherlock found himself amazed by John’s behaviour toward him. The teen was always so kind, so conscious about was other may thinks of Sherlock. He was never shy to call Sherlock amazing, and fiercely defended him again any malicious attacks. Sherlock absentmindedly chewed his lips, trying to dismiss the familiar pang in his chest every time he realised that John mad done remotely kind to him. It was a never-ending war with himself, to remind that they were friend, good friends, and that nothing positive would emerge from a change of that situation.
John practically stumbles of exhaustion when he enters the flat. His scared shoulder is crying in pain; he is thirsty and a he has a throbbing headache. Through the curtains the sky is pink and purple, a new day already starting, ending a night of nightmare.
Mrs. Hudson left his side to look for Mrs. Turner, another widower of the building, in an attempt to have more information about the whole mess. Sherlock choose to avoid the bigger group of neighbors who were talking, standing together in various states of undress. He wasn’t a very friendly person and his habits of playing violin at the wee hours of the morning hadn’t increased his popularity in the vicinity. Moreover, Mrs. Hudson had been right when she pointed out that it wasn’t his fault “this time”, as he had quite the reputation to be the one who started fires frequently with his experiments. That was why he had simply turned off his fire alarm. Maybe he owed his life to his only friendly neighbor.
Then Sherlock heard the sound of the steps whining when the boy stepped on the stairs. John was… he was walking downstairs. He wasn’t going back to his flat!
“Grandparents. A hand knitted one, with an ugly pattern, I'm afraid. And there is already a second packet with a 'John' nametag sit next to Harry's one.”
They never went for a romantic stroll on the pack, hand in had. But they had hectic chases after renowned criminals, fit of giggles at crime scene and bickers about the appropriate place of body parts in a fridge. As everything they did together, it was
“Does he?” Sherlock snored in disdain when John nodded. “This film becomes more and more insane with every new character.”
“No, sir, you can’t,” said him with the tone of a man who had repeated the same sentence for the nth time “Please, just wait here and let us do our work.”
“John, you've been dancing around each other for so long it’s not even funny to watch anymore! I don’t know how you manage the sexual frustration at this point.” She turned toward the dark-haired teen with an appreciative look “Besides, he looks amazing tonight, you've chosen the right costume. Quite a candy for the eyes.”
He looked for his roommate through his half-closed eyelid, finding him in the middle of the dance floor. The dark-haired teen was dancing, his eyes closed, focused only on his body and the music. Some of his curls have come free from his gelled hair, bouncing on his forehead as he moved. John felt his breath caught in his chest, mesmerized at the sight of Sherlock's wave of hips, the fluid movement of his shoulders. As when he was conducting an experiment, or playing a particularly complicate piece on his violin, Sherlock was oblivious to the world, totally focused and very, very attractive.
They barely made back home before Sherlock was all over him, kissing frantically the skin he revealed little by little, unfastening layers and making buttons pops open one after the other.
“Well, no vampire tonight, there will be orcs, elves, dwarfs and hobbits! I think Greg had a great idea with this Hobbit theme party!”
They weren’t the only ones dressed for the occasion : they've already passed skeletons, zombies with fake necrosed body parts, mommies and werewolves with different levels of facial and body hairs.
The voice came from his side. Surely it was the blond boy trying to be “nice” or even “friendly”. How dull.
The detective quickly shot his arms close, wrapping John into his coat. They shifted a moment, trying to find a comfortable position. John more compact size helped them to arrange him, his head twisted against Sherlock’s neck and his legs cradled between Sherlock’s long ones. They intertwined their hands on John’s stomach, and he quickly started to feel the warmth spreading in his limbs through the layers of clothes. He slowly relaxed, settling a bit more into Sherlock’s arms. The detective shifted slightly, and John felt Sherlock fondle his cheek against his temple.
John was bouncing with energy, compensating for the gloomy face of his roommate. Both teenagers were costumed and making their way through the London's streets illuminated with Halloween decorations.
John was unable to divert his eyes from Sherlock’s frame as tried to push away his feeling, repeating “out of your league, John, so much out of your league” like a mantra. But who was he fooling? He had been attracted to his roommate for far more time he allowed himself to consider.
Over an hour passed before John managed to extract himself of the mass of dancing bodies. Gosh, it had taken him ages to get rid of that girl!
But it was obvious that it was all an act, and their inability to regain a natural relationship wasn't helping. John was unusually abrasive and prone to outburst, while Sherlock was unnaturally silent and careful around him, resulting a constant tense atmosphere between the two teens.
Shaking himself, Sherlock resumed looking at the other teens. His eyebrow raise as a pathetic excuse of a dragon made his ways to the dance floor. The boy had applied brown make up on his face, making him look like he had felt on a pile of mud before coming to the party. His costume consisted on a cheap plastron obviously coming from a knight costume and a nylon cape messily cut to make it look like wings.
They resumed running, taking the stairs two by two, hurtling on the roof by the heavy access door left open by the burglar. They separated to look for the suspect, slowly making their ways between chimneys and electrical cabinet
Mycroft finally had to grab his arms to prevent him to harm the surgeon when the man tried to refuse him the access to Sherlock's room. The posh man spoke softly to the surgeon, obviously playing of his influence in the British Government, until the man agreed to let John go to Sherlock's room. Without even a word of thanks, John was out in the hospital hallways.
It had been a 20 minute cab's ride to go to the crime scene, an abandoned warehouse in the dock area. God help them, it was a bloody mess. Literally. There was blood everywhere, the body barely human anymore, the smell awful and acrid.
Surely “doing something romantic the 14th of february “ was listed on some on Sherlock’s chart. The manic scientist had established “romantic” lists when they first started getting out together, and John should admit that he found it strangely sweet when Sherlock hid his insecurities under the pretense of “scientific” experiments. He usually indulged him, as Sherlock was nothing but enthusiastic about his scientific experiments, especially when he chose items on the “sex position” list.
“My dear boy,” I said, keeping myself calm with a considerable effort. “I have learned, all in one night, that you have another brother, with a lover of his own, of whom you never speak; and that some men like us marry publicly, before God and man. I am shocked. That does not in any way prove that I consider you and I, and everything we do, anything less than sacred.”
I gathered myself, and went to my desk, and wrote out some letters, to old clients in high places, to Lestrade, to my brother. I had to muster all my resources, and gather any scrap of intelligence that might help me to corner the man. I might couch the threat in general terms, except to Mycroft; but every one I wrote to would care enough to bestir themselves if we were in danger. On sealing the last note I found myself struck with a rare emotion: gratitude for my friends. I generally thought of myself in plural terms only with John: he and I stood together; he and I would depend on one another. But when it came down to it, we two were not alone in the world.
“Reasonable, yes, of course,” I muttered, collecting my wits piecemeal. I leaned over to light the lamp; fumbled about the nightstand for my reading glasses. He propped himself up against the headboard and waited for me, his head bowed down, hair in mad disarray, proof proper of his mental state; he’d been running his hands through it without noticing. The letter lay in his lap, unsealed. I took it up. It wasn’t much to read: concise to the point of rudeness. The refusal was properly explained, the congratulations quite correct, but there was none of the warmth one would expect for a brother on the point of marriage. Laying it down, I attempted to muster my thoughts.
I could easily have left them at peace in their ignorance, had I not been so recklessly happy with him. Barely twenty-four hours from our arrival we were seen kissing tucked away in the greenhouse. I can’t imagine how I’d expected to get away with it. I suppose I should be grateful that it was my mother’s lady’s-maid who spied us, for she went to Mother directly, and no gossip started in the lower halls. Father seemed almost indifferent to the act itself, if bemused. I suppose as a man of the world he’d seen stranger things. But he was protective of Mother, and she was humiliated, and frightened, and it made her wholly unforgiving. Victor was sent off at once. I was put on a train to London a few days after, with instructions to apply myself to my studies unwaveringly, and the threat of complete financial foundling if I was seen with him again by anyone.
I had startled him again. I took a step back, and sat down in my chair; looked up at him, leaning now upon the mantel and drawing on his pipe in nervous bursts, studying me. “Of course. It’s your brother’s wedding, Sherlock.”
He was at a loss for words, but I saw the truth in his face; he’d meant it just as he said it, and all at once I felt like weeping. “What, at the club, with a priest, and a crowd?” I asked, more softly; laid a hand on his cheek.
“Cliche,” Holmes murmured, without rancor, as Lestrade went down the stairs, and I shut the door behind him, “the final refuge of a man unable to give comfort.” Which was an admission in itself, not lost on me: the situation had put Holmes in need of comforting.
Mycroft's read, AM WELL IN SPITE OF APPEARANCES STOP FURTHER DETAILS FORTHCOMING VIA USUAL CHANNELS STOP. I hoped my brother had not been frightened. I forgot sometimes that I was really all he had in the world, but being alone myself just then, I felt it suddenly and keenly.
“What’s wrong?” I am not usually so direct: I prefer to tease him toward happiness with little gallant unmentioned attentions when he is low. But I was so surprised at him, I spoke without thinking.
“Yes. Oh, God.” He grabbed my shoulders. He was going to kiss me. He doesn’t do that in public, not in the middle of London, but then he was: I barely had time to see it coming before he was kissing me, urgently, and then he was in my arms, small and solid and beautiful, sniffling into my neck, while I savored the feeling of his hot, wet breath in my skin; and then he pulled back wet-eyed and said, “Put it on me, will you?”
I have a very great deal to tell you about my current reading and my experiments, and some theories I am developing regarding agriculture, most notably the cultivation of the bee-hive. It would not do to write my thoughts out now—I want to see your face as I tell you. Your eyes are a particular joy of mine. That was (truthfully) a good part of my motivation in bringing you into the cases, to begin with: to watch your eyes’ changing expression as you discovered the truth, and delighted in it.

Ten years after the events described above, I brought him there, to Montpelier, to the house by the lavender fields. I paid the lady of the house to take a week's vacation, and let us have it to ourselves: such is the privilege of resources. I gave him the key to the place as we approached, a calculated move. He propped his cane against the wall in order to unlock the bolt. I waited until he had the door open, and then swept him up in my arms. He would have knocked me over the head with the cane had he retained it—his reflexes remain deadly quick—but as it was he could only sputter in outrage as I strode over the threshold, and deposited him within.
He could tell I was nervous. I haven’t done anything to surprise him in a while; it isn’t easy to catch him off guard. And it’s so simple to please him in other ways. He likes little things. Cold beer in the fridge when he gets home. Cheese toasties on rainy nights. He likes flowers. I hadn’t expected that. I got them, the first time, because they were beautiful, and so is he, and I wanted to. I left them on the counter in a beaker. He stopped still in the middle of the kitchen when he saw them. I was working at the table, studying the effect of heat treatment on the viscosity of wood stain. I realize that’s not an ideal experiment to perform in a small, enclosed space. Well, I had the window open, or I think I did.
Watson's friend Dr. Maxwell's views on male intimacy as a natural experience were common enough among the rural and working class. But they were rarer in the educated classes and officially condemned by established medical opinion. A few gay men were writing accounts of their own experiences by the end of the 19th century, and there was organized legal and social activism taking place, but a medical exploration of gay intimacy as a healthy human developmental variation would be published for the first time (I think) in 1914 by Dr. Magnus Hirschfield ("The Homosexuality of Man and Woman," with data collected from 10,000 participants), five years prior to the foundation of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft--the Berlin sexology institute and center for activism. The Institute's library, 20,000 collected works on trans and gay life, was raided and burned by the Nazis in 1933, and the center closed. Hirschfield was also an active member of the WhK, a German organization founded in 1897 to advocate for full social and legal acceptance of LGBT citizens.
I had just enough time to watch new depths of black self-loathing opening within me, when, “Oh,” he murmured. I heard the catch in his breath that meant he was moving carefully against his injuries; looked up, to find him just taking his seat again. He watched me in attentive silence; and the abyss retreated from me under his gaze.
“I ate at home,” I objected, but feebly, and sat down too hard in the chair he’d gestured towards. My legs were beginning to tremble.
Throughout, I was nearly murdered a half-dozen times in an unamusingly creative variety of ways. I went to Narbonne, to Nimes, to Lyon, to Montpelier; they followed me. An ordinary interview was abruptly interrupted by a bullet fired through the window nearest my head, passing so close as to leave a burning sensation across my endangered ear; the gendarmes in my company rushed outside, but found no one to chase; no one in the street seemed to know where the shot had come from. Later, a letter was sent to my address, containing a powder which, analysed, proved a chemical agent which could have paralysed me in an hour had I inhaled two grains of it. Another night I returned home late to find scratches on the window—someone had been trying to cut through the bars with a saw. Still another day, in the thick of a sudden spring rain, I was set upon by thugs on the banks of the Saône. There were three of them. I had a revolver in my boot, which I could not get at until nearly the end of the scuffle; a knife of good steel, and my fists. I fought them off without a word said between us. They fought like trained men and not vagrants. I will never know who they were.
“If you use that tone on my given name, I will have to leave,” he said, “or else kiss you now. I am mortal, Holmes. There is only so much I can bear.” The absurd, shining good-humour on his face was my undoing.
I haven’t often seen Sherlock speechless. Mycroft studied him curiously before adding, “I confirmed your relationship to the Doctor when asked. I did not volunteer details, but I thought that much was forgivable.”
He was there, golden in the warm soft pool of lamplight, reading—weary about the eyes, a little wistful in the mouth, but calm, and safe.
He shook his head at me. "You would not retire. You'd last three months, and then some enduring injustice or some badly-hidden secret in the neighborhood would catch your eye, and draw you back into the fray again. You forget that I know you. I know that you cannot leave a man like Moriarty alone, to do what he does to the innocent. But there are always men like him. It will never end. No,” as I started to speak, “listen to me. I understand, you have to do this, now. You have to meet him. But Holmes, you know me, too. You know I can't leave you alone in it. It is impossible. Don't ask it of me."
As to the man you saw at the Falls, we think there are five likely possibilities, given your description of him. Your brother assures me his sources are surveilling them all thoroughly. Of course it is very important that our man, whoever he may be, does not notice he is being sought. But the necessary artfulness of caution is infuriating. Terrible as the work of a battlefield is, it is at least straightforward. One sees what must be done, and one does it. How did you ever find the patience for cases like this?
I stepped inside. There followed some minutes of the inexact, familiar, kind exclamations anyone receives on their sudden arrival home. She seemed surprisingly worried over me. My insufficient weight and my apparent weariness were fussed over, and the state of my shoes and my bag and my hat, and then she insisted on hanging my things for me, and hustling me up the stairs, with promises of tea and sausages, and no attention paid at all to my repeated, “I’m really all right,” which I meant to follow with, “but there is a hired murderer waiting just outside and you ought possibly to take a day’s holiday,” as soon as I could get a word in. This I only managed to convey once I was seated at my own table, with a napkin on my lap, and my cup steaming.
“That my brother is also an inveterate self-debaser? That he cheerfully enjoys the fruits of his moral decay? That he would publicly claim a marriage founded on buggery?”
I didn’t anticipate you breaking my heart deliberately. I only thought—I am a difficult man to live with. I’d imagined it would be exponentially more difficult to live with me now that you feel you love me. There are myriads more ways I may misunderstand you, and wrong you. And I have no more to offer you now than I had before. I already loved you, though I've been a very poor hand at showing it.
“It’s not natural. It's a pathology of the mind!” I was breathless. He rose to his feet, red-faced, and stumbled a little as his stiff leg failed to hold him. He bit his lip against the pain, steadying himself. When he spoke his voice was worryingly quiet.
“Why on earth?” I knew I sounded hurt. I was hurt. “As you said, you did not begin this affair. I did. Do you think I respect myself so little? Or do you still believe I am only using you for my own pleasure?”
“Don’t mind me, it’s just that I’m happy,” was my poor attempt at an explanation, which flustered him further.
I'd meant to write a quiet divorce for John and Mary, but if I've understood my reading right, there was no such thing available. Divorce would require money, a lot of it, and public humiliation; being cut out from one's social groups for the shame of it; appearances in court; proving before a doctor that the husband could not respond sexually to his wife, and the marriage was unconsummated! I couldn't imagine John and Mary having the resources nor the brazenness for all that, so I wrote them a practical separation, which was much more common: separate houses, separate amours, and financial support for the wife, who would be unable to work or claim property.
"Forgive me. I had told you everything in my mind—a hundred times, I—You recall our friend, Professor Moriarty?” I said.
He was listening still, but with a look on his face I had not seen in years—an apathy, a kind of surrender of his courage in the slump of his shoulders and his downturned mouth. He was with me, but I was struck with the sense that something had been emptied out of him.
“There are assassins about. I only want to be sure everything’s all settled before I drag John into some accidental adventure,” I said. And then I heard myself, and my heart began to beat faster; but she only smiled at me.
“For a look at the truth I will, yes. But some truths require a gamble to be discovered. Money doesn’t. Money can be come by in more reasonable ways.”
All at once I was wide awake. I pushed up out of his arms to look down at his startled, sleepy face, faintly rosy in the fire’s dying light.
“I know. At any rate, no, there has been no appreciable change in my—condition. There is nothing in the literature of any use. One doctor laughed me out of his practice; another told me to drink cocoa instead of liquor in the evenings; a third recommended I give up frigging myself and pay her better attention. It cost me all my restraint to keep my seat and thank him for his time, instead of knocking him over.”
I hated seeing him sitting quiescent in our own home, saying such things to me quite calmly, as though I would agree with him! “It wasn’t luck, Watson. It was you—your courage, your decency. You did right by your orderly, and in retreat he saved you. You were good enough to Stamford that he thought to bring you to me. You have made yourself my friend. I found you by chance, but I won’t lose you by one.” I was perilously near committing myself, and I couldn’t find it in me to regret it. “Can you believe that, at least—that whatever you may lose, you’ll have me?”
“Good boy,” he said fucking him harder. “You can do this. I knew you could. You can do anything. You look so sexy. Your little hole sucking up that toy.”
The young jumped slightly when she heard her phone buzz. She quickly picked it up and looked at the messages.
John carefully removed the device and sat it on the floor. He quickly grabbed a towel and wrapped his bunny up. The bunny began to stop trembling as soon as he was wrapped in a warm towel.
The bunny had already agreed and he wasn’t turning back. He had taken several enemas to make sure he was cleaned out. He wanted to make sure he was ready for what was going to happen.
Sherlock wasn’t one for social events. Bunnies, in general, didn’t like social events. All the noise and activities could be very overwhelming for a bunny. Bunnies didn’t like strangers either, it was part of their prey instinct. Yet, somehow John had talked him into going to a Halloween party.
The fox looked down at the bunny. He was trembling under their touches. He decided to keep pushing forward. John seemed to know how much his bunny he could take.
Sherlock spread his legs and started to whimper as pleasure as his lover took him. It could feel John’s knot swelling at the base of his cock. He was terrified of it, but he knew he would have to take it. It would hurt, but it would feel amazing.
“Stop being a child. You’re going, Sherlock, and that’s all there is to it!” John snapped. “Now go out and buy yourself an outfit. Take my card if you want and get whatever costume you think will be suitable for a party.”
“I love you too little one,” the wolf whispered playing with Sherlock’s ears. “Daddy has a very special treat for you.”
Sherlock was riding along with her that morning. He knew something was on his daughter’s mind. She was strangely quiet during their ride. When he had gone to tuck her in the night before she was already asleep. That wasn’t like her at all.
It felt so good as the rod pressed into his prostate. Waves of pleasures spread through him. He mewled in disappointment when John slid the wooden spoon free.
The next night Rosie was determined to just do her homework and go to bed. She needed to get a little extra sleep. Her felt like she was pushing it to the limit.
The wolf lined the toy up and started pushing in.Sherlock’s mouth dropped open as he felt the massive head start into his body. The tight passage clamped down around the large intrusion.
Sherlock threw back his head and screamed as his body was rocked with orgasm, the massive cock battering deep inside. He felt it in his throat. The tears were flowing harder than ever as his cum coated the carpet below them. John gave one hard thrust as he exploded inside his bunny.
“Naughty boy,” he said feeling his knot start to deflate. “How many should you get for being such a good boy?”
Sherlock only response was to embrace him tighter. John smiled fondly and raised his head to kiss the part of Sherlock’s jaw he was able to reach. Sherlock shyly dropped his head, hiding his flaming cheeks from John’s gaze. John didn’t push him, simply nestling his face against the mop of curl on his shoulder. They stayed immobile a long moment, listening to the roar of the wind, John eyes on the sky while the detective preferred to keep his face buried in John’s neck. John finally broke the silence.
He went directly to the bathroom, not bothering to lit the light on his way. The burning hot shower he took left him clean and sleepy. He felt himself slip away, the exhaustion and worries of the day catching him as he entered their bedroom.
John didn't intertwine their fingers, but he held them tight when he stepped once more into the crowd. Sherlock followed him, their arms brushing when they walked closer than before. There was suddenly a myriad of sensations from his hand to his shoulder, and he struggled to find his balance. He was sure that John would feel his elevated heartbeat from the contact between their palms. Or was the accelerated throb he detected coming from John?
He found a relatively calm spot at the side of the crowd, leaned against the showcase of a closed shop, and resolved himself to wait until the end of the firefighter intervention to go back to his experiment.
This time, the man turned back, but only to send them a dark glare and mumbling something rude about disrespectful teenagers standing in the way. John stepped in front of Sherlock before the passionate dancer could say something even ruder in return.
He hadn't been standing for more than five minutes when he saw a fireman exiting the building, pullinga young man by the arms. His blond hair shined under the streetlights as he let himself be dragged outside the building with great reluctance.
“Right. So, maybe I can get her a new DVD or something? They may have some Doctor Who Christmas sales mayb- oh, sorry.”
John despised formal wear. Even as a younger man, he had never been interested in fashion. He preferred the classic design of simple cut, the plain materials, the predictable way of black, maroon and light colors. The obligatory army uniform had been a relief, and he never regretted the imperative of the fashion season. Back from Afghanistan to civil life, if his clothes were outdated, well, so it was.
John had a chuckle before gazing at him “Well, unless you have a portable radiator hidden under that big coat of yours, I guess I just have to bare up until Greg arrive and put us out of our misery.”
Sherlock tone was detached, as usual careful not to betray his inexperience in relationship. John frowned, considering his answer honestly. Sure, he would have never considered cuddling in a rooftop by night while freezing his ass as “romantic”. But that was before. Before Sherlock. Before becoming SherlockandJohn. They weren’t following any of the patterns John had had in his previous relationship. They had never been to a movie together, Sherlock had never brought him breakfast in bed, and John had never bought him flowers. And even when they did do something that could have been considered romantic, such as dining at Angelo’s with a candle on the table, they were speaking about crime scene, dead bodies or international art trafficking.
John stood up the moment the surgeon came out of the operating room. He didn't wanted the reassuring words, the sugar coated banality the man usually told to frightened family member. He was a soldier and an army doctor. He wanted to know precisely which arterial had been touched, the depth of the wound, which limbs has not been enough irrigated, during how long. He needed to know in order to calculate the damages, the nature of the therapy, the length of the recovery, the extent of the scar.
“When the fire alarm started you obviously put your clothes on in a hurry, but stayed inside the building in order to help, long enough that the fireman had to pull you away for you own safety. You have been restless since then, indicating a will to go back. You want to help, even by neglecting your own safety, indicating you’re adrenalin junky, if I had to say.
Sherlock reluctantly got up, following her as she stepped out of his flat. She was already leading him down the stairs, toward the entrance of the building. On his way down, Sherlock crossed paths with a firefighter: a heavily-equipped woman knocking on every door on the floor. A powerful smell of burning was already filling the corridors.
“I...” he stuttered hurriedly “I need a wrap top for my dance class, and it's really hard to find in the men's section, so I-”
John was curling up tighter against his legs to save as much heat as possible but Sherlock’s voice made him still.
So here were, chasing the principal suspect through darkened company’s buildings, the blogger racing after his mad detective.
Sherlock rolled his eyes with a disgusted grimace, make clear his thought on the matter of his brother’s relationship with the aspiring policeman.
They had avoided each other the next couple of days, until John had just sat at Sherlock’s table during lunch ours and had commented on the quality of the school’s sandwiches, his tone forced and his eyes never leaving the plastic table.
“What are you, 17 or 7?” snapped Sherlock, “Besides, if your mother had coerced you to wear costume every year during your childhood, you'll hate costumes too. Have you ever seen my brother in a vampire outfit?” He flinched with a dramatic roll of eyes, “he looks like a Transylvanian sausage. It's a sight you don't want to remember.”
“Fair point”, conceded John, “But we can't spend the night here. Do you think that if I tried to make S.O.S. signals with my flashlight someone will see it? Or I can try to let myself slip into one of the ventilation duct?”.
Sherlock opened his eyes, gazing at his blogger’s profile. In the dim light provided by a lonely street lamp, John’s face was wan, his lips pursed in a thin line and his sandy blond eyebrows gathered.
John looked always, letting the two girls share some sloppy kisses. As if they were magnetized, his eyes immediately fell on Sherlock’s frame.
“You are incredible,” whispered John. He realized suddenly what he said out loud, and both teen blushed spectacularly, before turning away from each other. Sherlock's hears were burning and he forced himself to breathe calmly, glancing at John when the teen forcibly cleared his throat.
Sherlock felt his heart pounding in his chest. The plain looking boy was in fact a more complex puzzle than he had anticipated, and the challenge was thrilling.
“I can tell that you have been living in London for some time, but your family comes from Scotland. You are conscious about your heritage, but more because of the poor state of your family finances than the geographic localization. I also know that you’ve played rugby for some time, but stopped to focus on your medical studies. An understandable choice of career as you have a serious knight-on-the-white-horse complex, doubled by a craving for adrenaline. I’ll end by saying that hiding your homosexuality is actually a good idea as the neighborhood isn’t actually gay friendly.”
“Do you want me to stop?” John nibbled on the soft earlobe. John had incredible control and even in a near-rut, he was able to make sure his mate wanted it.
“Sit on my cock. NOW.” John commanded, dropping the spoon to the floor. “I want you to ride me, my pretty little bunny.”
She didn’t think she would have a problem but the second she saw Luna she knew she couldn’t do it. She quickly ran out of the room before Luna could see her. She had had no idea where she was going but she knew she couldn’t’ go to class.
A nervous-looking squirrel ran up to them and handed John a bottle of lotion. The small creature quickly ran off, giving Sherlock a look of pity.
“Alright,” John said carrying his sweet bunny into the room. “Greg is ready for his turn. I can smell it on him. Let’s go to the bedroom.”
Her little talk with Karen made her feel better. She took another moment to collect herself before heading to class.
“It needs to be this way,” the wolf said taking control of the situation. “If you wear one then I can give you something to help you sleep.”
Her pencil flew across the paper as she solved equation after equation. She liked math and it took her mind off Luna. She had texted her girlfriend over an hour ago and she hadn’t gotten back to her. That wasn’t like her at all.
“Almost done,” the doctor urged as Sherlock’s hardened in his hands. “You’re getting so hard. You must love it.”
Tears sob down Sherlock's cheek, into John's chest hair, “Ah,” was all he could say, just little “ah's,” and, “ah”  and "Aaah!" All of them sublime, ascending-pained sounds between high staccato breaths with every inch forward of John's monster cock.
Cold milk. Sherlock knew that feeling. Bloating quickly overwhelmed him. Milk was a tricky thing. If John only used a small amount on him it could cause painful cramps that pushed him to orgasm. If his wolf used to too much it felt like he was slowly dying.
Tears filled the bunny's eyes as he felt his wolf bottom out deep inside of him. He felt his body tremble as it tried to adjust to the massive feeling inside of him. Of course, it never fully would.
Sherlock yelped as he felt John shift inside of him. It felt like he had slipped in even deeper! To his surprise, John stopped moving. What was wrong? Had he said something?
“That was amazing,” Sherlock said, trembling and kissing his lover’s rough, pointed ear. “But I have a bit of advice for you.”
“This is going to be your new training dildo,” the wolf explained. “You’re going to wear it all the time until you can take it without lube.”
Lestrade looked down at Sherlock’s red and sore looking behind. There were already welts starting to rise above his supple skin. He couldn’t help but look at the thermometer that was sticking out his tight little hole. It read thirty-nine degrees Celsius.
Sherlock looked up from his book and pushed his floppy ears out of the way. He felt a wave of excitement and fear fill him. He tossed his book to the side and stood up. He quickly removed the dressing robe he was wearing.
“Well my Dad says you shouldn’t judge people,” Rosie said. “Maybe she did have some problems in the past and she is trying to get her life in order. Everyone deserves a second chance.”
Sherlock tried to rise to his hands and knees but found himself unable to. He just didn't have the strength.
Sherlock did his best to relax as his inner muscles rippled and spasmed as John started to fuck up into him. Sherlock cried out in pain as he was battered into over and over. He pushed the pain to the back of his mind. He only wanted to think about the pleasure. Each trust was nailing his ruined prostate.
“I doubt it will stop hurting completely,” John said. “But once it is manageable I want you to push back.”
“Not big enough inside my little bunny?” John asked, running his finger from the tail to Sherlock’s stretched hole.
Sherlock nodded, trying to force his body to relax. He knew it would feel good once his body relaxed. The burning intensified as John slid further and further inside of him. The bunny gave a long cry before collapsing into the rug. He knew there was no getting away from his lover.
Mrs. Gladden was really understanding about her math homework. She had given her an extension but warned her not to do it again.  Despite everything Rosie was feeling pretty good until she got to Creative writing. Luna was in that class as well.
HIs body, inside and out, tensed up as he fell over the edge. As soon as his orgasm ended his body went limp. He collapsed against the bottom of the tub. HIs insides opened up allowing the water and milk to go in deeper.
Sherlock drifted away as his lover fell into conversation with the others. Music with a deep base was filling the room. Sherlock loved music. He loved the feeling of it of giving into the music and letting it flow through him. He couldn’t hear anyone talking about him. He didn’t feel anyone's eyes on him.
Sherlock was wailing, a pained, plaintive sound rattling the bunny's petite body in its intensity. John behind him was pistoning up into Sherlock's overused, puffy red hole, lost to all the world, blind to anything that wasn't shoving his giant knot inside his lush Sherlock’s body.
John couldn’t believe he was taking it so well. He replaced the thermometer back in his mouth. 38 celsius. Much better. He set it back down on the bedside table.
Sherlock whimpered pushing his face down into the bottom of the tub. His floppy ears dropped down over his eyes.
Sherlock wanted to be there. He wanted to feel the fire that shot up his spine with each thrust. His body had other ideas. His arms and legs were fighting the restraints that held him. Part of his brain was telling him he needed to get away from the pain.
To John’s surprise, his bunny agreed right away to a threesome. He was excited to show off what a good little bunny and good fuck he was. John constantly praised him during sex and told him no other bunny could do what he could. He couldn’t wait to show it off to their fox friend. He was going to be amazing!
The bunny reached up to touch the belt. He didn’t fight it. He simply rested his fingers against the leather. That’s when it happened. It seemed like he was dying as his orgasm ripped through him. Every nerve was on edge as his body began to shake uncontrollable.
It was warm but not too warm. His stomach began to grumble as he was filled. So much water claiming him, cleaning his insides. John always loved fucking him after he had an enema. He was so clean inside and ready for him.
Greg quickly lubed up his cock. Globs of lubrication slipped from his fingers and fell to the sheets. The fox got in position and started to push into the bunny. Sherlock gave a yelp of pain as the cock slid into him. The fox paused his actions and looked down at Sherlock in concern.
“I get that,” he said looking down at a pad of paper in front of him. “I have to write you up for this regardless.”
“Ride me,” John said slapping his bunny's perky ass. “I know it hurts but you can’t focus on that. Focus on the pleasure, my little love.”
The wolf bared his teeth as he slammed harder, rougher, inside, jackhammering inch after inch after inch of his cock into the tight passage. Sherlock howled in pain as he was quickly filled. His wolf didn’t wait before he started fucking in and out of him. John wanted to take his bunny as hard and fast as he could.
John shook his head reaching for the normal thermometer. He leaned forward and placed it under his bunny’s tongue. All the moving was causing Sherlock to cry in pain.
“That’s my boy,” John said, giving his friend and playful spank on his behind. “You love it. No matter how you fight it. You can’t hide it.”
Sherlock let out a frustrated whimper as John pushed the handle inside. His body had no problem sucking the wooden rod into itself. John carefully slid it all the way in as he toyed with his lover’s puffy white tail.
He opened the tube and dropped a large amount onto his cock. He didn’t want to hurt the tight bunny. Two canine knots would hurt another canine. It would tear the bunny apart if they weren’t careful.
Sherlock bit down on the pillow to keep from screaming as he was penetrated. It felt like someone was driving a cricket bat up his backside. He wasn’t ready to take something that large.
The young girl picked up her math book, notebook, and other supplies before shoving them in her backpack. She felt like her heart was breaking in two. She pushed her head under her pillow and started to cry freely.
Rosie could hear the nervousness in her friend's voice. She was clearly worried about her but she didn't care. She had what she wanted.
“It hurts pretty bad,” the bunny explained as more cock was pushed into him. “He isn’t as as you but...it’s...it’s different. And little prep...”
Karen nodded as Rosie tried the cigarette again. She had a better experience the second time. She smiled as she exhaled the smoke. She handed the cigarette back to Karen.
John got to his feet and stood in front of Sherlock. His scary big erect cock was only a few inches away from Sherlock’s face. Without having to be told bunny opened his mouth. “Wider.” John snarled. The big bulbous head was too big. It took Sherlock shifting his lips until the cockhead popped in, filling his mouth immediately. John’s hands quickly found their place in Sherlock’s silky soft hair. He tugged at those curls impaling Sherlock further onto his manhood.
“I’m glad you came to sit with us,” Marcus said. “I was hoping you could help me with my science. I have it here somewhere.”
Greg decided not to warn Sherlock that he was pushing in. He was scared that he would tighten up if he knew the cock was coming. He lined up and pushing inside alongside John’s cock. Sherlock’s mouth dropped open and his eyes snapped closed.
As his orgasm approached he did forget. All he could think about was Sherlock's insides squeezing around him. He focused his sharp hearing on listening to Sherlock’s moans and cries.
Roise loved the new bag! It was blue and looked like the galaxy. There was even a union jack on the front pocket.
Sherlock started to ask what it was but didn’t dare. John didn’t seem like was in a mood to deal with too many questions. He opened his mouth and allowed him to give him the pills. John carefully gave him the water to drink it down.
Greg paused for a second He didn’t want to hurt the bunny and he wasn’t going to force him to do something he didn’t want to do.
“Want to play Mario?” Rosie asked picking up her game system from the floor. “I have the newest one.”
“Ah!” he cried as the knot fully swelled in him. It's enormous pressure was directly on the little bunny's already abused prostate. He couldn't take this level of violent pleasure. “I can’t!” The bunny screamed.
Despite the feeling he was being ripped in two Sherlock felt his tiny bunny cock beginning to hardener. He pushed back against the huge invading cock. He wanted more! If John asked him he would let him use an extension to make his cock even bigger. He wouldn’t care if it hurt. He wouldn’t care if he bled. He would do ANYTHING John wanted.
The bunny was crying freely as the thermometer fully slid into him. It felt so massive inside of him and he knew it wasn’t going anywhere for a few minutes. John would want to take his temperature twice to make sure it was accurate.
At that moment the bathroom opened. Rosie jerked her head in the sound of the door. To her surprise, she saw Luna standing in the doorway.
the rest of the dildo in. Sherlock screamed and arched his back. He was bleeding. He was sure of it. He began to sob heavily as his body tried to adjust to the toy.
“You gave them to me,” Rosie said shaking her head in confusion."I NEED them. You have to give them to me."
Rosie listened for the sound of his footsteps. As soon as he was out of ear shot she slipped out of bed. She was careful not to make noise as she retrieved her torch from her dresser. Next, she grabbed her math book. She slipped under the blankets and flicked on the torch. Another half an hour wouldn’t hurt.
It was bigger though. Even though it was John who had unusually high control and balls of steel when it came to restraining himself, he was still was still in a near-rut, making his cock size and knot size slightly engorged. The doctor rolled his bunny onto his side and pulled him close. Sherlock gave a soft moan as he was settled back against his broad mate. Some people were still staring at them. Many sets of wide shocked eyes were set on them. Sherlock saw wads of money exchange hands.
John opened the box of nappies and took one out  As he slid it into Sherlock’s body and around his waist, he heard his bunny began to cry heavily. The poor creature was practically sobbing.
Their pairing was an unnatural one. Even in a world of animal-human hybrids, it wasn’t supposed to happen. A wolf and bunny weren’t supposed to be a couple. They were supposed to be enemies. The wolf was supposed to fight the bunny; not fuck it. Yet, that was what was happening in 221b baker street.
“I was wondering if we could sit with my friends once in a while,” Rosie said. “I got to sit with them yesterday and it was really nice.”
“We’re having chicken.  It’s a bit early because we’re going to the cinema tonight,” he said deciding not to nag his daughter. “Why don’t you set the table? Your dad is going to be here any minute.”
A powerful cramp was starting to build in his gut. His body didn’t want anything to do with the cock inside of him. He brought a hand down to rest on his stomach. He wanted to take it all. He wanted to cum with John’s knot in him.
Sherlock let his body relax and accept the two large knots inside of him. The fox shifted a bit pushing his knot into the bunny’s prostate.
“Hello,” he said when someone picked up. “This is Dr. John Watson. I need to speak to Dr. Hugen. I have a pretty serious question.”
John would get mad surely. He would yell at him, as he often did when Sherlock did annoying things  He went back to remove the outfit. Surely, it was a crazy idea to wear something like this.
A lot of fear crept over Sherlock’s face. There was no way he was going to be able to take two knots. He couldn’t take a wolf AND a fox. It would kill him!
Rosie zipped the bag closed and picked up her phone. What if she needed more? Math was under control for now but about her other classes? What if Math got hard again? There wasn’t any harm in getting more. She quickly sent Karen a text. It felt like forever but she did get one back.
He was a little nervous about being with someone different. John was the only partner he had ever had. Getting a good hard spanking could help him relax. They decided to wait until Lestrade arrived. It would be a good show for him to help break the ice.
To her horror she found Luna walking into school holding hands with another girl. Rosie knew that girl. Her name was Sarah and she was an old friend of theirs.
The little bunny’s backside was turning bright red under the hairbrush. It clear to John that there would be some bruising later.
“Yes,” John said. “I want to see you take him. Once you get going I’ll get more involved. Lube is on the bedside table.”
Moriarty. She felt her heart beginning to race. She knew her own family would come up if they were talking about him. She didn’t know much about him but didn’t want to learn about him. The teacher, Mrs. Stagg was sitting at her desk. She gave a Rosie a worried look when she noticed her eyes fixate on the board.
The fox swung the strip of leather through the air with as much force as he dared. The sound of it smacking with Sherlock’s soft skin filled the room. Sherlock threw back his head and wailed with pain. He was panting heavily and pushing back against the blows.
“Not a chance” John growled, groaning in appreciation when he lifted Sherlock’s frilly skirt.  “I’m going to make sure everyone knows who you belong to.”
When they reached the school Sherlock wished her a good day and she was off like the wind. Perhaps he was being silly. John told him he worried far too much about her.
As much as Sherlock complained about John’s massive knot it was never enough to make him come once he got used to it. It didn’t hurt anymore and he wanted more.
Rosie was excited for lunchtime to come around. She needed to talk to Karen. There was no way she going to be able to keep up with her math class anymore. It was too hard! With all of her advanced classes, she was getting overwhelmed.  She needed some help.
“Next week I’m going to fill you up with super soapy water,” John explained. “I’m going to put an expanding nozzle inside of you and tie you up. You’re going to hold that water until you think you’re really going to die.”
“No more! More! Stop! Harder,” the bunny begged, his body unsure if it wanted to stop or wanted more of the agonizingly ecstatic pained-pleasure. “Please!”
John removed his hand from his cock and placed began to play with Sherlock’s tail. He knew his lover was in a massive amount of pain. All he could do was help him relax. He held still inside of him for a few minutes. He hoped it would help him adjust.
Sherlock moaned at his words. He knew he was right. He knelt down in that tub and allowed John to ram that giant nozzle into him. Once the water started he would cry and beg for it to stop. Despite this, he knew he would cum. The water would fill his insides and make him cramp. When the cramping became unbearable he would orgasm. This is how it happened every week.
Despite all the pain he was in Sherlock could feel himself hardening. The dildo was pushing against his prostate hard. It was sending shocks of pleasure through him.
