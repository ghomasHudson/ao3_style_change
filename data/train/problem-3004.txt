Dean decided to go out for a supply run, remembering that they seemed to be low on some food when he was digging around for breakfast. He made up a list of things to get, asking Sam and Eileen if there was anything they needed before he decided to head out. Cas had offered to go with him earlier so once he was ready to go he went to look for the angel, finding him sitting in a chair in the library, reading through a book.
“It startled me so badly, I almost fell out of my chair. It wasn’t until I saw the look of fear that had washed over my father’s face that I really began to get nervous, god I’ve never forgotten that look. He tried to hide it from my sister and I, tried to smile and say everything was going to be alright, that he was going to go check on our mom and to stay by the fire where he could find us.”
“Well, I’m aware that after your mother died, you and Sam spent your childhood jumping from town to town as your father searched for Azazel and that you took on a father-figure role to Sam. Then eventually you both started to hunt as well.”
Once they finished the tree and the rest of the library, they went on to add lights, garland and other little decorations in the map room and along the staircase, as well as throughout most other areas of the bunker. It was amazing how much they had done, just the four of them, but it looked great when they had finished.
Cas looked at him skeptically but didn’t question him any further. He slipped his hand off Jack’s shoulder.
Just as that thought appeared in his head, all traces of Cas’ fingers were gone. He whined a little at the loss, moving his hips back to try and regain what he lost and then he realized what that meant, what would happen next. He couldn’t wait, he wanted him now.
“Ahh oops. Probably my fault.” Chuck grinned at him, raising his hands in the air in fake innocence.
Still, Rusty was a bit disappointed that Cas wasn’t here when it finally happened. Sure, Rusty was happy, but it didn’t feel completely right, it felt like something was missing, someone was missing. Rusty kinda wanted them both, wanted to nail them both. Rusty couldn’t get enough of them. Always wanting to hear every detail they could about them. 12 years of want and Cas didn’t even show up. To say Rusty was disappointed was an understatement.
Cas stretched his arms out slightly with the coat, giving Dean one of his annoyed faces, but all Dean can think about is how adorable he looks like that. He couldn’t help but smile a little at how concerned his angel was for him. He knows he’s not technically an angel anymore, but to him, he’d always be his angel.
“Guess I know now where Dean got it from… why he was so weak, why he always seemed to attract such disgusting, broken people, why he was so easy to break.”
He tried to speak again. This time actual words managed to come out, and words that would not make him want to flit off the moment he said them.
Cas pushed John forward, the man almost tripping over his own feet as he went, his eyes flickering around the tall walls that surrounded them.
Slowly, Castiel sat up and slid off the table, Dean not far behind. Cas just stood there though, as if not knowing what to do next, but luckily Dean did. Dean bent down then, grabbing his previously discarded shirt from the floor a few feet away and used it to wipe himself semi-clean, then handed it to Castiel to do the same.
Dean was confused for a moment and then horror spread across his face as his eyes widened, realizing what exactly Cas had meant by that.
“The disappearances. Every so often we’ll hear about it and they’re never found. Not any of them. My family wasn’t the first to go missing and they weren’t the last. David paused, taking a breath. “I know that there’s something out there and it certainly isn’t a bear. You being here just further confirms that, so don’t lie to me.”
In the past, when he lost Cas, he knew death wasn’t always the end and it still tore him apart, but now there’s nothing left. Nothing left without him. Nothing left without the hope of seeing his face or hearing his voice. Seeing that look he had in his eyes whenever he saw Dean, a look that Dean could never place, until now.
The tears were flowing freely again, “It was so hard. And I couldn’t tell Sam, I still could never tell him. When he was young, it shouldn’t have been something for him to worry about. And then when we got older, the way that the two of them would butt heads… it would have only caused a bigger rift between them. Sam would have gotten angry and then he would have left. I just- I just wanted to have a family, I didn’t want to be alone, but then he left anyways. He left dad, but he also left me and when dad found out… he was so mad, Cas.”
He curled into it, wanting to be consumed by it and then heard a small chuckle from very close by. He paused, opening his eyes and blinking away the sleep from his eyes.
The wound wasn’t massive, but the rate of the flow would’ve been quite worrying if he had still been alive and on Earth.
Dean was practically whimpering, practically begging, and who was Cas to deny him of what he so desperately wanted.
“Well, since you’re just about done with your lunch, I was thinking maybe we could watch a movie if you’d like to?’
Dean sat there on the bed, nuzzling his face into Miracle as he held onto him tightly for just a few moments before letting him go.
Dean looked at Cas again, pulling the phone away from his ear and reaching it out towards Cas for him to take. Offering him a reassuring smile, Dean let go of the phone once Cas had it in his grasp.
Not knowing what to say, or what to even do in this kind of situation, I mean, who even has to deal with a kind of situation where their best friend, aka the person that they’ve been secretly in love with for years, finds a pair of their fucking red panties by mistake. Nobody, that’s who. So, here he was, having to make it up along the way, something he’d been doing for most of his life now.
“Wha- no why would I-” Dean was surprised, and it must have shown on his face because of what Sam said next.
Maybe asking about it would be fine, maybe Cas wouldn’t mind as long as he didn’t specifically bring up what he had been drawing most recently. Maybe if he just phrased it as the drawings as a whole Cas wouldn’t be as uncomfortable about it all, and neither would Dean.
"And let even more people die? No, not a chance.” Dean paused, watching as Cas gave him a look. Sighing, he gave in. “Okay, let me think about it."
Dean blinked, rubbing his eyes with the back of his free hand before the memories of the night before came flooding back.
“I really never expected to be very good at it or like it very much, but… I don’t know… I guess over time I just… I enjoyed drawing things that made me happy, moments that I didn’t want to forget. Some of the things I loved most in this life, no matter if they left or changed, I’d still have them here…”
He slammed the door shut even faster than he had opened it. When he turned around he noticed Sam staring at him in confusion, and then there he was. Lucifer was there, he was in the bunker. What the hell had Dean just done. How were they doing to get out of this? He had no weapons on him and neither did Sam, they were completely unprepared.
“So what’s the plan then? I don’t understand what you need little old me for, unless it was just for a therapy session.”
When Dean looked back up at Cas, he was surprised by the sight that met him. Cas looked just as nervous as Dean felt. All the confusion on his face from moments ago was now completely gone. There was also a trace of something that Dean couldn’t quite place.
Once he felt the hard ridge on the knife, Cas removed both of his hands, using his right one to slide down into the correct pocket until he felt the smooth metal on his fingertips. The force of his hand sliding into Dean’s pocket, however, had caused his jeans to slide down, only by an inch, but that was more than enough for Cas to catch a full view of the sliver of pink that stuck out beautifully against Dean’s skin. His breath caught in his throat, trying his best to not react in a way that would catch Dean’s attention because now he knew the answer to the question that had been plaguing his mind before. Dean was most definitely still wearing the same panties that Cas had caught him in the previous night.
“Oh, I see. I could go then. I don’t wish to make you uncomfortable,” Cas said, starting to get up from the chair, hearing it creak loudly in the silence of the night.
Crowley and Meg didn’t stick around any longer than was necessary. They listened to what Cas had to say and then left with a quick goodbye, not wanting to be around a group of angels this large any longer than they needed to.
“It was… more than just your voice though… I don’t wish to make you uncomfortable and I really do mean it when I say that I had no control over it, but I could… feel you…”
Cas wasn’t entirely sure where Dean’s charger was and he realized now that maybe he should’ve asked Dean if he knew exactly where it was, but it was too late now and he decided that if he couldn’t find it in a few minutes then he’d go back to ask.
now, he’s pretending that nothings wrong and has been magically fixed but it’s not. He- okay I know what happened before you were taken, he actually managed to talk to me one day, so I get it, okay? But he’s still pretending and it’s not okay,
Hello everyone! I'm posting a bit earlier than I thought I would. I was worried I would be late this week since I got busy with the next chapter before finishing this one... oops. I'm just very excited about it, but first, let's get some shit done!
Rusty’s cousin loved the stories of the Brothers Winchester just as much as they did, but this night changed everything for Rusty.
Cas seemed like he wanted to say something else, but closed his mouth instead and gave a short nod. Something still seemed to be off with his best friend, but after a few moments of consideration, Dean decided that it was better not to piss him off even more.
He looked down as Cas’ cock, hitting his stomach, as he wrapped a hand around it, sweeping his thumb over the tip.
“Shut up, Dean,” Cas commanded as he gripped Dean tight and raised him off of Rusty. Dean gasped, feeling the pain, feeling the blood, feeling everything seem to shift and want to flood out of his body.
Cas was not far behind him, all it took for him to finish was a strangled noise that came out of Dean’s throat and he was gone. The wave of pleasure hit him and flooded through his body. Cas rode out his orgasm on Dean as he grabbed hold of his dick to help him through it.
Cas couldn’t feel anything else, he couldn’t think about anything else, just Dean. All he could think about was this absolute agony from Dean and that he needed to make it stop, he needed to help him. Now.
Dean couldn’t deny that Cas had a point, maybe several points, but he didn’t actually have to say that out loud.
Nobody else could know this loss he felt because Cas wasn’t even his to lose. Not truly his. Dean didn’t know Cas could even feel love, like the kind of love where you fall so deeply and so hard that there’s nothing else. There’s only that person, that person who you would do anything for. You’d die for them, kill for them, risk everything in the world just for them.
Well, that was fun. I love Balthazar so there was no way I wasn’t going to bring him back. He 100% deserved more screen time. Also, I'm sorry but no I could not resist slipping a little Cowboy Cas is here again because reasons.
Little did they know, Dean had just happened to be walking down the hallway when he had heard voices. He really hadn’t intended to listen in on the conversation, not until he heard his name among the rest of the distorted words.
“Okay, maybe just, help me find everything. We don’t need Sam coming back to this mess because I don’t think he’d ever sit anywhere near this table again.”
That was when his mind decided to remind him of the existence of the sketchbook that he had held in his hands not even three hours ago. That sketchbook that he was pointedly trying not to think about; guess that plan had failed.
“Shit,” Dean muttered out, having to take a step or two away to actually reach his phone that had apparently bounced a few times in its great escape from his pocket. Although this hadn’t been planned, Dean was not one to miss out on a perfect opportunity so, as he reached for his phone, he made damn sure to bend down just enough that his ass was sticking out completely in Cas’ direction, his shirt riding up just enough to expose the lace waistband that hid beneath it.
“Yeah, always is. Why don’t you walk me through it? It’s not like I don’t have the time, right?” She chuckled.
Dean really was still quite tired, after having stayed up later than he probably should have the night before and eventually, he must’ve dozed off. He wasn’t sure when or even for how long, but it had happened.
“I’m fine,” he brushed off quickly, sitting up on the bed. He knew it wouldn’t be enough though, he wasn’t fooling anybody.
Dean had been lying on his bed in his room. He was on his phone, looking at pictures. Photos of Cas. This night had been a good night, he was able to remember the fond memories of Cas without all of the regret and shame he had normally felt when thinking about Cas.
Dean pushed himself back so he was in a more comfortable position, while Cas knelt down and climbed on top of him.
And then it wasn’t enough, Cas’ legs finally gave out and he was collapsing to the ground, his back sliding down the wall until his ass hit the ground, his legs sprawling out before him, giving Dean an even better view, if that were even possible, which he hadn’t believed before. With that fall, also came an inexplicably loud gasp, one that seemed to even shock Cas himself, for making and then, Cas was coming. Sitting on the floor, spread out and absolutely wrecked from the pleasure, Cas was coming all over his chest and his hand and Dean only wished that he had played some part in that fucked out look that Cas had painted on his face.
Cas saw past all of Dean's flaws and all of his scars. When he looked at Dean, he didn’t see a broken man, the broken man that Dean saw when looking in the mirror. Castiel saw a man full of love, driven by love. He saw a man that fought for his family, his friends, the whole world because of how deeply he loved, because of how selfless he was.
Cas leaned back then, his face coming back into Dean’s view and it was once again so close to Dean’s.
Cas ushered him to bed, both him and Sam. He didn’t want to keep them up and he promised that he would still be there in the morning, he really had nowhere else he wanted or needed to be.
Then, before he could fully process it, he was coming undone, his knees going weak as he did all he could to keep himself upright, his left hand shooting out quite clumsily to grab tightly onto the sink to keep himself from collapsing, the other hand still preoccupied with other matters. He tried his best to remain silent, to keep himself under control, but it was difficult, extremely difficult and he failed spectacularly. The whimpering gasps shooting past his lips with no regard or consideration that the only thing separating him from Dean was the door which was not very thick at all.
Dean rests the shovel against the railing and walks over slowly to Cas. When he reaches him, he lightly takes the coat out of his arms and places a gentle kiss on his angel's lips, a smile still plastered to his face.
This was all before Dean had finally opened up to Sam, before he shared with him why he had been affected so strongly by Cas’ death this time. When he told Sam what Cas had said, and how Dean had said nothing in return. This was before Dean had started to eat just a bit more of the food when it was brought to him, before he started to spend more time out of his room and around Sam, before he actually started to leave the bunker a few times when it wasn’t for a liquor run or due to Sam pestering him to get some fresh air. All of this was when Sam had finally become hopeful that his brother was clawing his way out of the dark pit of despair he had dug himself.
Jack brought them somewhere more private, not wanting to be overheard by the others, and then he explained everything. He didn’t leave out a single detail. Cas stayed eerily silent throughout the story, watching Jack the whole time. It made Jack even more nervous, having Cas not saying a word like that.
“No, no, everything is fine, or at least it will be soon,” Cas said as she ushered him into the house.
At some point during the night Dean rolled over, still asleep and his arm stuck out, landing on one of Cas’ arms. It sat there for a while before it tightened slightly and worked its way down to his hand, holding on tight and bringing it to his chest.
He wasn’t too concerned about walking out of the bathroom like that. Partly because he’d done it plenty of times before and didn’t care much and also, even if he did, he knew that Cas wouldn’t be back for a while now. It had only been like thirty minutes maybe since he’d left.
A creaking sound finally broke him out of his thoughts, one that made him jump just a little. It was only Cas though, which normally wouldn’t have been such a big deal, except right now the only thing hiding his
“Okay,” he breathed out. Dean turned over then, reaching out to turn off the lamp, before moving back to his starting position, but he was tucked even closer to Cas now. He could feel the warmth radiating off the other man.
“I didn’t have to be there. We are all so fortunate to have you in our lives. The whole world is lucky for that. You made this world better and saved it in so many ways. Ways that your father could never have dreamed of.”
Dean put it as bluntly as he could, not even sure how Cas had missed something this big over how many fucking years. Apparently, he most definitely had missed it though, at least if his eyes widening five times the size was any indicator.
He tried to put a hopeful look on his face, but it felt forced and it probably wasn’t very convincing.
“You just watch the eggs, okay? Just nudge them around a little every few minutes. I’ll turn off the bacon so it doesn’t burn. You think you can handle that?”
He closed the door behind them and stopped, letting go of Cas’ wrist. He shuffled his feet awkwardly before looking at Cas and then the chair sitting in the corner that was facing his bed.
Dean nodded, already knowing what he was talking about. He got up off of Cas, and reached into a drawer and grabbed a bottle of lube out.
Once it was done, he headed back to heaven and searched for Cas, they had work to do. He caught sight of him after a bit of searching. He was conversing with some of the new angels, Dara and Jasmin, probably trying to get to know them a bit better. It was interesting to watch. Cas looked so fascinated, probably by the fact that they were among the first two of Jack’s creations.
The motel wasn’t as crappy as most of the ones he was used to. It was actually quite nice and cozy. The inside of the room was clean, the walls made of wood and the bedspread a red and black checkered plaid pattern.
Cas tried to brush it off, but he couldn’t help the staring. He hadn’t noticed last night, he must’ve been too preoccupied or happy to be back to notice, but Dean was different. He
Dean doesn’t know what to say at first. He chuckles awkwardly, “uhh Sam must’ve put it there as a joke. There’s this sort of tradition… for humans with it…”
“Dean,” he said softly, almost mirroring the tone of Dean’s own voice. Then, “What the hell happened?” Cas asked before he could stop himself because yes, he was concerned but he was also a bit upset with Dean for getting himself into this and worrying him like that. “I swear if this was part of your dumb idea to use yourself as bait-”
Now that Sam was gone, Castiel turned his face back towards Dean, who was still very much dying, coughing up his own blood.
On Cas’ first case back from the Empty, when Dean made him wear that absurd hat. Cas had felt so ridiculous and embarrassed at first, but then when he looked at Dean when he saw that look on his face, he couldn’t help but smile. He couldn’t refuse Dean, so he cracked a joke about it, hoping to get some kind of reaction.
Dean’s heart warmed. Was Cas really going to go through all this effort for them? It was their first Christmas that they had all spent together and Cas was just trying to make it special. Dean couldn’t help the sense of fondness he felt for the angel.
“I know, I just- If I talk about it, then it becomes real, then it becomes something that I have to truly accept.”
That’s when it happened. Dean looked at Rusty, he actually looked at them. He couldn’t believe it, in the middle of the fight, Rusty had finally been noticed by the hunter. Rusty thought and hoped that Dean was going to kill this stupid, delusional clown once and for all. But then, all at once, Rusty’s dreams were crushed and fulfilled all at once. The clown had won, but Rusty had won as well.
“Yeah, I caught it,” she chuckled before her tone got a bit more serious. “So, there was a reason I called, as much as I like checking in, I caught wind of something going on in Colorado. I was hoping you guys could find someone to check it out.”
Although Dean would never admit it to Sam, these bags were actually quite handy. He didn’t have to pay for all those shitty plastic bags or worry about them breaking if he filled them too heavily. Plus, the handle was a lot nicer to hold onto with the fabric instead of the plastic thinning out and digging into his hand or arm. Maybe he could get behind using them… maybe.
When Castiel’s eyes finally landed on Dean, his heart broke. Dean’s wrists were tied together, holding his body up as they hung from above him. Cas could tell that he was unconscious, his head lolled to the side, his breathing shallow, but steady. He also noticed the small patch of blood on his temple and the way it’d begun to roll down the side of his face.
Hastily trying to distract them both with a subject change, he walked further into the room, careful this time to be certain that no chairs were blocking his path. “So, what’re you both working on in here?”
After a moment, Cas began to move again, lifting himself up onto his forearms, bringing his face in line with Dean’s so that he could look him in the eyes. He paused there, just looking at Dean before leaning down and placing another kiss to his lips. When he pulled back, there was a smirk on his face, one that had not been there before. Slowly, he sat up, so that he was kneeling above Dean’s thighs.
Not wasting any time now, Castiel hooked his fingers beneath the waistband, carefully sliding the panties down Dean’s thighs before getting rid of them completely. The cool air was a shock to Dean, he could feel it cling to his newly exposed, damp skin as his cock bounced against his stomach, finally free from the confining fabric.
“I’m not completely certain as to why since I hadn’t asked him and yes, there was a message, but no, I do not know what it said.”
“What the hell do you want, “ he sneered, clearly annoyed as he took another drink from the bottle in his hands.
Just then, Cas heard footsteps coming down the hallway. Hastily, he put the bed and the sheets back how they originally were before turning around to face the door. Not a moment later, Dean appeared in front of the doorway, already clad in sweatpants and a loose-fitting long sleeve shirt. His hair was still noticeably damp. Cas could see the little dribbles of water trickling down his neck and the shine of his hair.
“It’s okay to feel like this sometimes, but you need to remember that. You need to remember who your real family is, that we don’t care about your flaws, we care about
It was Dean’s turn to nod his head. It felt like there was a lump in this throat, and he didn’t know what to say next.
Before Cas had even pulled his head away from Dean’s ear, he had already slipped a finger inside himself. Dean could tell that this is what he was doing from the noise Cas made, and the way his grip tightened on his neck slightly.
This time, he told Jack everything. He told him about how miserable Dean was and how he would hardly eat anymore, how he would spend less and less time with Sam and Eileen as time went on, how Sam would, more often than not, find Dean passed out drunk on the floor. He also told Jack what Dean had told him, he knew he might not have wanted him to, but he knew that Dean would come around and probably understand why he did it. He told Jack about what Cas told Dean, that he loved him and that it was killing Dean that he wasn’t able to say it back, that he never got the chance to say it.
Dean has to stop himself. He needs to remember what Cas had said. He knows deep down that Cas was right. Cas saw who he truly was, he knew Dean completely and that scared Dean. Cas had seen every part of him for what it was, and he also loved the parts of Dean that might not have always been driven by good intentions or something other than love.
He knows why. He was confused and afraid, there was so much happening. One minute he was fighting Death, thinking that he was going to die. He felt his heart literally being crushed. Funny isn’t it? Now he knows what that really feels like and how he would gladly take that pain in the place of this pain he was feeling now.
“Nothing’s wrong, Cas,” he insisted, his eyes returning to Cas’. “There was just a lot that you missed while you were gone. For starters, Lucifer came back-“
Cas knew Balthazar just meant it as a sort of joke, but he couldn’t help but feel guilty about how he left Dean.
Reassuring Castiel that John would certainly be treated be hell’s best, she pulled him away, one hand on his arm.
“I first got the idea when I was human… to draw, I mean. There was this person I met who found sketching calming, he told me that it helped him focus, to feel like he had a purpose in life and that, no matter where he’d go, or what he’d be doing, he’d always have this book with him. It was one of the only constants in his life back then. I didn’t think much of it at first, but I liked the smile he got when he talked about it and it was interesting to me how he’d just sit down somewhere for hours it’d seem and draw in this little thing.”
Dean swallowed, his eyes were wide. He wasn’t really sure what exactly to say here. This certainly wasn’t what he was expecting. He never thought that Cas… that Cas felt the same way that he did, that Cas could even feel something like that. He wanted to say something, to let him know, but then Cas’ face hardened a little.
He always felt so embarrassed if Cas turned his head towards Dean, feeling caught and turning into a clumsy mess for a few moments.
Sam didn’t say what really happened, they both knew that Dean wasn’t ready to hear it yet and Sam didn’t want to push him any further than he already had.
It was quiet for the rest of the night, apart from the few little snores that escaped Dean every so often.
“Well… I’m not really sure if Jack really wanted me to say much about this but I guess he’s not here. So, before I came here, back to you and uh, and Sam, I was in heaven, which you already knew. But I was there for longer than I let on. With all the angels that had returned, there was a lot to be done, along with a few changes that Jack had wanted to make to heaven.”
“Considering my being exclusively attracted to men, I guess I would have to say that Dr. Sexy is quite attractive… objectively speaking of course.”
Dean must have done just that, because a minute or two later, John had disappeared. With the threat now gone, Dean could now focus better on the angel before him.
Dean dropped the bag on the table and sat down, beginning to unpack whatever it was that was in the bag. First, he pulled out a burger, which thankfully, was not squished from the impact with the ground.
Then, Cas’ hand was pressing firmly, but gently over the swollen ankle, his hand glowing as he focused his attention on healing the fresh wound, along with the other more minor injuries scattered around his body.
“What?” He questioned, trying to give him a look of his own but ultimately failing as the smile that he was trying to conceal broke out once again on his face.
“I mean I know you like to follow me around like a lost puppy sometimes but come on, Cas,” Dean chuckled out.
Surprisingly Dean hadn’t gotten annoyed by having a shadow, or more like two since Cas was back. Wherever he went either Cas or Miracle wasn’t far behind, sometimes both of them. If he was being honest, it was usually Cas, but he was happy to spend some time with the angel, he’d been wanting just that for the past few months and now, here he was.
“O-okay,” Dean stuttered out but released Cas’ hand as he sat up. Despite this, he couldn’t shake the disappointment he felt at the loss of contact with the angel, even if he had been the one to let go. He tried to ignore it and distract himself by changing the subject.
“Hi, Cas,” she spoke. “Sorry, I missed you last night. I was out on a hunt and only got back early this morning.”
Dean sighed, walking over to the big tub of dog food they had, taking the scoop and filling it up before walking over to the food dish and pouring it in. Miracle happily began chowing down the moment Dean had stood up fully again and walked back to the tub of food to put away the scoop.
He blinked his eyes, looking down, he saw grass, he was laying on a field of grass, and then he looked around. There surrounding him were the rest of them, they were all there with him. They were all looking around, amazed. Smiles broke out across their faces as they took in the sight before them and realized that their plan had actually worked. They had done it, he had done it. He could save Dean, but he knew he needed to wait. He couldn’t just abandon everyone here, not like this. Some had been gone for far too long and so much had changed, most of which was only in the past few years. Now that they had time, he needed to finish explaining everything. The angels needed to know just how bad heaven had gotten, how needed they were, he also needed to fill them in on why that was and all the things that had happened since. He knew that once they got to heaven, they could probably fill in these angels, but it didn’t feel right just leaving them like that and unaware of everything. He needed to be there, to do things right for once. He owed them at least this much after everything.
Either way, no matter what happened then, things were definitely different now. Sure, he hadn’t explicitly said to Cas that he didn’t mind when he watched him sleep, but he also didn’t say that. He had told Cas to stay with him the first night that he was back, hell, he even asked Cas to come and sit closer to him for god's sake, he pleaded with him not to leave him.
I didn’t even do anything, I mean trust me I tried to find something, anything, but nothing. There was nothing, and that was forever ago anyways…”
it. Cas could feel everything that Dean was feeling in that moment, but he wasn’t completely sure why or how this was even happening. All he could feel was intense pleasure surging throughout his body, he could feel Dean, could hear him inside his head, moaning his name.
Dean was extremely quiet next to Cas. The song had now changed. Cas could feel eyes on him, he knew Dean was watching him, but he didn’t dare look up at him, terrified of what he would see. He just sat there and listened to the music playing.
“Okay well, it’d be nice to know that you’re just flying around now. A little warning would be nice.”
I will say that I think I can only promise I'll update at least once a month though, maybe more if my brain cooperates. I have no idea but I'll just say I'm halfway done the next chapter (because I gave up on this one at one point) so that looks very promising.
Staring blankly back at the angel, Dean processed what he had just said. When he did, he just shook his head, a small smile appearing on his face.
“I- I love you, Cas,” Dean murmured, his nose bumping against Cas’ nose and then he closed his eyes. As Dean leaned forward Cas’ breath caught in his throat and then their lips crashed together, finally. It took 12 years, but finally, it happened.
Cas leaned forward in his chair now, as he called out in a voice louder than he normally would’ve used, “Hi, Jody.”
“I know it’s not much, but after I enjoyed yours I thought it might be nice to return the favour.” Cas sounded nervous as Dean still hadn’t spoken. “It’s alright if you don’t- if you don’t like it. I’ll-”
The hunter rolled his eyes and watched how Cas' expression shifted from worried to satisfied, while he finished his burger. When he was done, he looked around for a second, before he took the angel's plate and placed his own in front of Castiel instead.
Cas was the one to remove his lips from Dean this time, a smirk on his face and he licked his lips for a moment while looking directly into Dean’s eyes. Then he reached down, hand gripping at the waistband of Dean’s boxers, waiting for him to lift his ass up slightly so he could get them off him fully. He got down to his knees then, looking up at Dean who was watching him, lip between his teeth, just waiting to see what Cas would do next.
After Cas had finished, Dean just held onto him, holding the angel against him as he collected himself and came down from the high. Then, placing a soft kiss to the top of Cas’ head, Dean chuckled at the lifeless being on top of him.
Ready to put on a show, Dean sauntered out of his room before he could overthink things, in search of a certain blue-eyed angel. Conveniently, the search didn’t take him long, finding the angel wandering out of the library and through the war room at just the right time.
Dean looked up again, a little surprised by Cas’ offer. He hadn’t stayed with Dean like this in a long time. It felt like a lifetime ago when Dean would wake up, startled to see the angel hovering above him, watching as he slept. He found it a bit weird back then, but in a strange way, he also found it calming, reassuring even. He felt safe.
Dean had made him watch so many of those movies. He would ramble on and on about the next movie he was going to make Cas watch as he fumbled around the kitchen making popcorn and grabbing a few beers, before dragging Cas to the den. Cas remembers these nights fondly. The nights where he and Dean would both curl up on the two recliner chairs, Dean with this huge childlike grin on his face, still rambling on about how much Cas would love this next movie.
As the days went on, one dream turned into two, each one seemingly progressing further, but never quite had them going all the way. These dreams were all that he could think about, he wasn’t able to focus very well on the case, and Sam was beginning to notice. He asked him on more than one occasion if he was feeling alright.
“Okay… that’s good then…” Dean wasn’t sure what else to say, but that little question remained in his head.
Sam didn’t know what to say. Why didn’t Jack tell him this? He must’ve seen the puzzled look on his face because he continued.
“Maybe that’s why he was always gone for so long, why he sent me on that first case with the nuns all by myself… I don’t know, I just knew back then that I had to do what he said. If he said something was evil and needed to be killed, then it had to be done, I had to do it, no questions asked, even if I didn’t want to, even if I didn’t understand why it was so bad.”
“Fu-ck...Cas, I’m gonna- fuck” Dean didn’t have a chance to finish speaking before he came undone. Dean couldn’t hold back, his vision went white as he came hard. He didn’t know the last time he had felt such pleasure, if ever.
Dean had also found himself checking on Cas more times than he could count, needing to reassure himself that in fact, yes, Cas was still here and yes, he was safe. There was the odd time, however, where it had taken a few seconds to spot the angel. Whether it be because he had been crouching down and in the process of drawing another symbol or because there was just a tree blocking his line of sight, those few seconds made his heart stop and interrupted his ability to breathe.
“The problem is that it’s weird, man. You’re just standing there staring at me, for who knows how long!”
Dean snuck his way under the blankets to join Cas in his warm cocoon, pressing his cold body against Cas’. The newfound coldness must’ve disturbed Cas, as, after a few moments, Dean heard a small groan, and saw those blue eyes blinking lazily at him.
“Yeah, uh yeah, we could do that, I mean it is tradition after all, don’t want bad luck or something if we don’t, right?”
out? God, he was never going to be too lazy to do that again. But that was an easy solution for the future, he still had to deal with the present to get there, or rather survive it.
Dean scrambled to get out from under the tangled sheets of his bed, his leg getting stuck in the process, causing him to almost face plant on the ground. Once he was finally free from the tangled mess and had picked himself up off the ground, he quickly started to make his way to the bunkers’ kitchen. The closer he got, the stronger the burning smell became. When he was only a few steps away from the kitchen, he heard some muttering.
His legs were becoming weak as he was getting closer so he slowly slid his back down the wall all the way to the floor until he was sitting on the cold tiles. He spread his legs out a bit, with his knees still bent slightly as the bathroom wasn’t large enough for them to be stretched out all the way.
He’d only been out for an hour or two when he felt that something was off. Not being quite able to place it at first, he paused, focusing all his attention on that one thing. Then, all of a sudden, it hit him like a damn truck. It was
Dean turns around then, walking back to his bed and sitting on the edge. When Cas doesn’t move from his spot a few feet away, Dean looks at him.
Cas could smell the bacon now. He made his way over to Dean, who was standing over the stove top, checking the bacon, picking up a piece with a pair of tongs.
“And I-I know that growing up he didn’t want that life and I was always so scared that he’d leave and go to college and find a new family. That he’d forget about me. He’d have a normal life. I knew that’s what he wanted, just to be normal, but I couldn’t be, and I couldn’t leave the life behind. This- hunting… that’s all I was good for, all I’ve ever been good for. But Sammy… he was different. He was smart, he wanted to get out, to have a real life and go to college, and you know what I did, I fucking dragged him back into this. This life that he never even wanted, all because I couldn’t do it alone, because I was so weak. All I was good for was taking orders and following them. Maybe that’s all dad saw too, just a good little soldier.”
Without much thought about what exactly he was going to say, or really any thought at all, his mouth just blurted out probably the worst thing it could’ve in this moment.
Their eyes met and there was so much concern behind the other man's, that Dean could only nod, which made Cas sigh quietly once again, but he didn't look away. Just like that, they were staring at each other, like they did so many times already, but now that Dean was aware of how Cas felt, it seemed to feel different. He tried to look away, but he couldn't find the strength. Absently, he licked his lips and the angel's eyes flickered down for just a second, but it was enough time for Dean to look away.
He just laid in bed for a few minutes, imagining what could happen, how it could feel to have Cas inside of him, to becoming a whimpering mess at the hands of an angel. These thoughts wouldn’t leave his head.
Dean was the first to break the eye contact as he pulled Cas into a hug, nuzzling his head into the crook of his neck. Dean breathed him in, felt his warmth, and smiled. This is what he had been needing, this was the only thing he needed. Cas, just Cas. He had been longing for this angel for months now, needing to look at his face, stare into those eyes, hear his laugh, just hold him. Dean just needed to hold him, it’s the one thing he knew he needed, the thing he had been craving for months.
A buzz startled Dean then. It was his phone. He pulled it out and turned it on, clicking on his messages. There was a new message from Sam.
Cas pulled the phone away from his ear then, just a few inches and turned his head to look at Dean. “Shh, go back to sleep.”
Cas had decided he had enough of this. He removed his mouth from Dean and smirked a little when Dean made a noise of disapproval. Dean would not be disappointed for long though as Castiel had plans for him.
Cas was certainly panicking now, worried about the safety of them both and of the Winchesters. Nothing good ever happened when he was around.
Cas looked at Sam for a moment. “You didn’t know…?” He asked slowly, now feeling unsure about the information.
Then Cas was watching as Jack slowly faded away, leaving him alone. In a few seconds it was if he was never there to begin with.
Then, he brought his fingers back down, being more gentle now than before. He took his time stretching Dean out, not wanting to hurt him or push him too far, but it soon became apparent that he really was not pushing too far. In fact, Dean was quite vocal about it.
Dean let out a sigh of relief, just knowing that he was still there. He felt himself starting to drift off a little.
This was even better than Dean had imagined, everything about it was better. His brain couldn’t have imagined a scenario quite like this or the actions Cas would take leading up to it or just how it felt knowing it was Cas doing this to him.
He just laid against the table as Cas basically slammed into him, not holding anything back. He tried to use his arms to support himself a little, but every time he got a grip, the force of the angel would unbalance him. Eventually, he gave up, just letting his cheek lay flat on the table, feeling the angel’s thrusts getting more sporadic as he went.
Yes, Dean didn’t like camping, who really did in their line of work? But he could still appreciate what nature had to offer.
Now finally taking a huge bite of his burger, Dean tried to remember everything that Jody told him while chewing.
“It’s alright, Dean. I don’t mind,” Cas soothed, gently rubbing his thumb along the side of Dean’s hand.
The sound of someone clearing their throat broke them from their daze. It was Sam, who chuckled once they both looked up at him.
When he was done, he loosened his grip in the sink, letting himself slide down onto the cold tiled floor of the bathroom. His knees stayed bent as he did so, the bathroom too small to allow him to lay them out straight in front of him. For a few minutes, he just sat there, feeling himself coming down from it all.
Later that night, Cas had just gone out to do… well Dean doesn’t really remember what. He just knows that Cas said he’d be back in about an hour or so. He hadn’t really been paying much attention if he was being honest because he was exhausted from the day. They had practically wasted the whole day in the woods getting lost and the only useful things they figured out was that Dean really shouldn’t be navigating and that the bugs were fucking horrible.
Jack dropped it, still looking a bit confused, but this wasn’t something that he was willing to fight Cas on.
“Oh, isn’t that nice,” Jack said as he walked over to Dean to take it from his hands, “And it has blue eyes, just like you, Cas,” he said looking at Cas.
“Yes. I thought I raised you better than this… but I guess I was wrong.” John looked away from Dean, almost as if he was physically unable to keep his eyes on his son.
Dean just holds on, breathing Cas in, finally able to breathe, finally able to stop the worry or stop himself from being crushed by just the thought of never being able to hold his angel again because here he was, and he never wanted to let go.
left out something important like this, he really just thought that it had slipped his mind, what with all the other things that had occurred. “Why would you leave that out?”
Dean gave his hand one quick squeeze before dropping it, instantly missing the touch, but also knowing they had other things they needed to be doing now that he could walk by himself.
Once he was in the bathroom with the door closed, he turned on the light. He didn’t want it to wake Sam and he sure as hell didn’t want Cas to get a good glimpse at anything.
It might not have made sense to anyone else but it made sense to him and he knows that it made sense to Cas too.
“Dean. I’m not falling for your tricks. I told Sam I’d stay here and that is exactly what I intend to do.”
Cas didn’t really say much, just gave him a brief nod, saying “sure,” before Dean brought his attention back to the phone.
Once the food was just about ready, they heard voices coming from the hallway, Sam and Eileen were finally awake.
Dean took it out of the box, hearing the tissue paper crinkle in his hands. He unfolded it, getting a bit anxious, just wanting to know what was inside, what could Cas have possibly gotten-
he was being pressed against a wall. Cas was there, face inches away, he could feel his breath on his lips. His earlier anger melted away as he looked into those ocean blue eyes. They both just stood there quietly for a minute, just staring into each other’s eyes, getting lost in each other's gaze.
David nodded his head at Castiel’s words, taking a moment to prepare himself for reliving the worst night of his life.
Dean was nervous, he had never been with a guy before, and he’d never even tried something like this with other girls or even alone. He didn’t know what to expect, but he trusts Cas, he knows he wouldn’t do anything to hurt him, and that he’d stop if he asked him to.
Without warning the clown had shoved Dean onto Rusty. The clown had hurt Dean, but it also made Rusty's deepest wish come true, to finally nail the eldest Winchester.
Dean smiled at Cas’ confused face, “Yeah that’s perfect. Now you take the egg in both hands…like this,” he said, grabbing the egg with both hands, “and then you have to gently split the egg- put a bit of pressure on the crack with your thumbs, and pull it open a bit.”
Dean tried brushing it off. Cas didn’t want to drop it though. He could tell something was wrong, he just didn’t know what it was.
“Well, after you… I killed Raphael. The new power I had gained from consuming all the souls in purgatory allowed me to kill him. And as for Lucifer… let’s just say you missed a lot while you were gone, I’ll fill you in on the details at some point, but long story short, he escaped from the cage a few times and at one point he had a son, which is nothing like him, might I add. His name is Jack and… well he’s quite sweet actually, takes after his mother.”
John seemed to realize his mistake, but it was too late now and Mary was furious. If looks could kill, John would’ve disintegrated.
Under his mattress, Castiel kept hidden a sketchbook, or, more accurately, two sketchbooks since the first one had long ago been filled up. Castiel walked over to the bed, kneeling down and lifted up the corner of the mattress. Once his eyes focused, they grew wide in horror. Both sketchbooks were no longer there, he lifted up the mattress a bit more in a last ditch effort to see if maybe they were just in a different spot under the mattress than he remembered. No luck though. They were gone. Castiel wasn’t really sure where they had gone or who may have moved them. He knew for certain this was the only place he had ever put them and they couldn’t have moved on their own.
Cas laid a hand on Dean’s cheek then, and in an instant, they were both cleaned up, so Dean reached down and pulled a blanket that they had knocked onto the floor on top of them both. He pulled Cas even closer to him, placing a kiss on his forehead one last time before he started to doze off.
The second Castiel was alone, however, he pulled out his phone, thankful to see that it was right where he had left it. He unlocked the screen, gazing down at it, wanting to call Dean. He just wanted to hear his voice, to make sure that he was okay, but then he felt a presence appear behind him.
Rubbing a hand across his face, Sam pointedly decided that ignoring Dean was the next best course of action as his focus returned to the screen on his laptop. That left a few moments of silence in the library, the air feeling thick as Cas’s mind decided to wander back to a certain red undergarment that was now only about two feet away from him.
Castiel’s dick twitched at the sight, his eyes unable to move away from the man standing before him in his fucking panties. He felt as if he were dreaming, praying that if he really was, that no one would disturb him. Ever.
Dean’s hand closed around it, his fingers brushing against Cas’, lingering for just a moment too long to be accidental. Cas’ eyes flick back up to meet the green eyes that’re already looking at him, a shy smile spreading across his face.
Cas had offered to pick up some food while Dean showered once again, but unlike the previous night, Dean was careful not to go wandering around in the open dressed in only a certain article of clothing, and Cas made sure to not fly into the room, this time opting for using the door instead.
They both seemed to get on board with Cas’ plan pretty quickly after he explained it and any hint of hesitation over the plan was washed away once Cas had finished explaining what he had planned to tell Mary before John and Bobby showed up.
Dean must’ve noticed too, the sporadic movements of Cas’ body, the extremely heavy breathing, the way his eyes had twisted shut. Dean knew that Cas was close and he didn’t mind, not at all, in fact, he practically dared him to come, with only a whisper in his ear.
So, one day, when he knew Sam was out and was going to be out for pretty much the whole day, Dean went into his room digging through his drawer for a very specific pair of panties, before grabbing his sweatpants, putting them back on and making sure that they were hanging very loosely on his hips. This pair was already visible when wearing his sweatpants at a normal height since the waistband came up so high, so now, there was no fucking way that anyone could miss it. The way the emerald green fabric was so clearly being overtaken by the black lace that wrapped high around his hips, almost connecting at the front, but parted by a small dip in the material that was connected by two small v-shaped details.
“That’s when the idea started to form. I thought about it from time to time back then, never really trying it though, there was so much that was new to me already that I couldn’t try another thing. Everything was so exhausting to me still.”
“What, so does this freaky connection still work?” Dean chuckled out. “Like can you still feel… whatever it is that I’m feeling? Because gotta say, that might be a little inconvenient if we were on a hunt or something,”
It hadn’t been long since they started with the symbols, maybe just over ten minutes, but that whole time was filled with silence. It wasn’t as if they really
So, maybe he was in denial about Cas’ feelings and maybe he completely knew it. It wasn’t like he didn’t
Once Dean had figured out all the details, he went to Cas to surprise him with it. He was quite touched that Dean had gone through all this trouble just for him, but Dean was more than happy to.
“Cas, I’m sorry, I know that it’s not what you want, but I thought it would be the best thing for everybody. I thought- I still think that it’s best if I’m not involved with things.”
“C-Cas?” he stuttered before his words came out in a rush. “What are you doing here? You shouldn’t be here.”
“That was the last time I ever saw him, the last I ever heard of my mother. Just like that, they were gone. My sister though… she was young. Hard for me to control. And she was scared, all the screaming, the whatever it was that was rushing through the woods. There was no wind that night, but I could hear the trees moving, the bushes rattling around, the sounds of our tent being torn up. I was a kid, I didn’t know what to do. I tried to calm her down, but I think now that my fear just made it worse. And then she just freaked out, started thrashing around, probably not sure of what else to do, probably just wanted our parents, and then she ran off. She was gone, before I could even realize what had happened or where she went, she was gone. Just disappeared.”
Cas sighed heavily, looking back at Dean. “I seem to have lost my phone charger. You wouldn’t have happened to see it laying around have you…?” Cas asked hopefully.
“Well, now that that’s out of the way would you stop being so stubborn and tell me what’s the matter,” she spoke, her voice was warm yet commanding at the same time.
“I was all alone then and everything went silent. No screaming, no rattling of the branches, nothing. I stayed by the campfire that whole night. Not moving. My dad told me to stay there where he could find me, so that’s what I did. I stayed there until the next morning when those hikers found me.”
The bunker was silent today, although that was not unusual as it was a bunker and there were only three people residing there. Cas still wondered, however, where everyone was. It was already past midday and he hadn’t seen much of either brother today.
Cas sat there and watched while Dean brushed his teeth and then walked over to the light to turn it off.
I took care of it already.” Cas’ posture straightened out, with his arms crossing over his chest as he spoke.
Heaven was quite quiet still which they were all grateful for. There had been way too many problems with it in the past few years and it was good to see that the angels had seemed to have worked out many of the issues they had been having previously.
“Why did…” Dean trailed off, building up the courage to ask the question he wanted the answer to the most. “Why were so many of them of me…?”
“Cas… I uh, I’m sorry for just looking through them… the books I mean. I just- I wasn’t thinking and-”
“Dammit, Cas! Where the hell are you! What’s going on? I can’t take this anymore. Get your feathery ass back here right. The hell. Now.”
Jack was dreading the moment where he would finally have to tell Cas about the deal he made. He knew he wouldn’t be happy about it, simply because it was with Chuck, and anything to do with Chuck seemed to be a bad idea. Cas hadn’t exactly asked him how he had done it at first, too in awe by it all. He wanted to get to know as many angels as he could, to get to know his son's creations. He also wanted to try and help any of the angels he had brought back with him to make this adjustment as smooth as possible.
Cas felt a mix of happiness and guilt at this moment. All he wanted was for his hunter here with him, he wanted to hold him, he wanted to tell him everything was going to be okay, that they’d be okay. He needed Dean to feel something other than this emptiness that Cas felt within him. Dean deserved the world, he deserved to be happy, he deserved to be able to live a free life, but he couldn’t. Cas had broken something inside him and it caused him to lose hope.
was in fact something that at first glance seemed to just be a sliver of his underwear poking out. That was until he noticed that it was not the normal, plain-looking fabric he had expected. No, it was textured. Upon further inspection, he realized that it was
After the first day, Dean had started to notice a few small changes in Cas. He and Dean had been spending a lot of time together recently while he had been staying with them and it had been nice, but now he was noticing just how close they had really been now that they were out of the bunker. It was almost as if Cas was his shadow, not letting Dean out of his sight or more than a few feet away at most times. It was a little strange and Dean couldn’t seem to get any space from him or any time alone.
Just as he’d finished throwing his things inside and closed the trunk, he heard footsteps entering the garage. Without looking up, he knew who it was, just by the sound of the footsteps.
It was their nightly routine, that they hadn’t meant to continue. Dean had asked for Cas to stay for just that one night, but then that one night kept happening until it had been over a week. Over a week of the same thing. Neither even had to bring up the topic of Cas staying anymore because they both knew that he would and that he wouldn’t leave until Dean asked him to.
They spent more time at the pet store than he had meant. He only wanted to get a few chew toys for him and a new leash since the other one had, well, gotten a bit chewed up.
It only took about 5 minutes for Dean to finish with the bananas, and then he made his way back over to Cas, checking on the eggs and how Cas was holding up.
That day they caught a break in the case, when Sam had left early that morning it was to follow up on a lead. They were pretty certain they knew who one of the wolves were, it was a man they had spoken to on their first day there. He was a local, Tommy Davis, and worked at the restaurant they went to for dinner the first night. Sam had stopped by the restaurant early to find out more about him and was told that he had called in sick the past two days. He had managed to get the man’s address. They weren’t sure how many people he lived with, but his manager was sure that he was living with some family.
Dean passed him the whisk, and Cas just looked at him with a puzzled look on his face, as he grabbed the whisk out of Dean’s hand.
With that Dean took the few steps towards the door and opened it. He jumped in surprise, however, when he was greeted by Miracle who was excitedly jumping at his legs. Kneeling down to Miracle’s height, Dean ruffled up the fur on his face before bringing the dog into a quick hug.
“He headed out about an hour ago, said there was something he needed to do, but that he’d be back with some coffee later. We didn’t want to wake you yet, you looked peaceful.”
Cas looked just as confused as Dean thought he must’ve looked himself, although he wasn’t sure why. He also looked a little freaked out, which was rare for Cas to show.
“Yes, that’s very convenient. I think I found something as well. Back in 1973, there was a family who went camping in the area that went missing. The campsite was found by two hikers ripped to shreds, but that wasn’t all they found. There was a survivor.”
“Ye- Yeah, slept great.” He stumbled out, feeling a bit embarrassed. His eyes shot to Sam’s bed then, seeing it empty and made.
“Yeah, okay. Maybe later we could head to the police station as well, I mean if we can’t find what we need.”
Those words still ring in his head. They play on repeat. He should have said it back, should have said anything! Why didn’t he say it back?
Only after the creaking had started to settle did he lift his gaze back to Dean who he found was watching him from the bed. He had a curious look in his eyes, one that Castiel couldn’t quite place. It didn’t last long though as Dean soon turned away, leaning towards his bedside table to turn off the lamp which he had turned on earlier.
This last part came out in almost a whisper, he wasn’t sure if Sam had really heard him, but he hoped he did. Dean wasn’t sure if he would be able to repeat it. It felt so good to tell someone, but it also hurt to get the words out.
It wasn’t just worry surrounding Dean’s health though as he, Sam and Eileen had discussed on more than one occasion. His worry also focused on another area, on what he’d said to Dean all those months ago, on how Dean had dealt with it, on how he felt about it now. He knew that if they were still so close after all that, that Dean either didn’t really mind or that he had just refused to accept that Cas was being serious.
Finally he brought his lips to the tip, and slowly sunk down on Cas’ dick. He fit as much as he could inside his mouth, and kept his hand wrapped around whatever he couldn’t fit. Dean started to bob his head, up and down, relishing all the noise that seemed to be flooding out of Cas’ mouth.
Cas had been gone for a while now. Maybe a little too long. During that time Dean had since made, and eaten a sandwich. Dean assumed maybe he was having trouble finding the charger, but maybe he didn’t want to ask for help, probably wanting to do it himself. Either way, Dean decided to head over to see if he had found it and was just sitting there on his phone as it charged or if he really did need some help.
Dean shook his head, trying to make the voice shut up, but he couldn’t ignore it. Taking a breath, he decided to break the silence.
They ended up watching two movies before Dean decided to call it quits. He was getting tired, almost nodding off near the end of the movie, but he still wanted to shower before bed. It had been a long ass day and a nice hot shower sounded pretty great. Grabbing his plate and empty beer bottles he headed to the kitchen.
“Well, uh, when angels die we go to this other place, not heaven, not hell, not purgatory. It’s called the Empty. Us angels and demons are sent there for an eternal sleep to relive our biggest regrets in life, our worst memories. There’s no escaping the past there.”
Through all of this, Dean could feel his pants becoming tighter and tighter until he just couldn’t take the pressure. Fumbling a little, he undid the button, followed quickly by the zipper. He kept his jeans on, however, but now they just hung loosely on his hips, threatening to drop with the smallest of movements.
“It’s okay… Take your time, Dean, I… I just want you to know that I’m here, just to listen if that’s what you need. I just want to help.”
The kiss was sweet and gentle, full of love and emotion. Neither of them needed to take it further than that, not yet. There would be time for that later.
When they got to the store, both of them got out of the car, but not before Dean reached around to the back seat to grab the bags that Sam had insisted on him using. After listening to Sam ramble on about all the benefits of using reusable bags he gave in, if not only to get him to stop talking so he could leave.
Dean had been rambling so it took Cas a few moments to catch up and when he did, a few things caught his attention.
At that Dean actually did drop the plate, but thankfully, it was just into the sink that was filled with soapy water, so it didn’t break.
Sure, he has a few pictures of Cas, but it’s not enough. Cas isn’t really there, he isn’t there for Dean to touch, to hold, or to feel his warmth. The room that belonged to the angel once was mostly bare, as if no one had ever even used it, so there wasn’t much comfort to be had there.
They kept telling him to go wait in his room, but he didn’t want to just sit in his room all alone, so ultimately, Cas had offered to stay with him until everything was ready. He had already done so much earlier in preparation of today so everyone agreed that it would be for the best.
He turned around and started walking over to the chair. Dean took this chance of not being under his watchful eye to hop out of bed and scurry into the bathroom before Cas could turn around and notice a certain problem in his boxers.
Dean was getting annoyed with Sam. Why the hell couldn’t he just leave him alone, he just wanted to be left alone.
“Jack, I am so very proud of you, but you just left Sam and Dean after that? Have you checked in on them since you left? Do you know about all the pain that Dean is going through right now, and Sam I would assume as well if he had to watch Dean go through this...”
“Good. Now it’s about time you and Jack get back to work so you can make good on this promise sooner rather than later.”
He didn’t have many photos of Cas, but he had a few. A couple of them were with their family, Jack, Sam, Dean, and Cas, there were also a few that included Mary as well. Dean’s favourite he had by far was one he took of Cas sort of as a joke. Cas had only noticed at the last second that Dean was even taking a picture of him. He had made him wear that stupid cowboy hat on a case once, the first case that they had worked once Cas had come back from the Empty, when he managed to annoy a cosmic being so much that it let him live. That was a story.
