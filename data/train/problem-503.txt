He has a great deal to think about, as do I.
He was losing it now; losing his focus.
Sherlock gave it a withering glare. “
John glanced at his phone. He could have sworn he had gotten a text alert, but there was no message.
Yes, as I have said elsewhere in my private writing, I knew not only of the existence of the elder brother but was actually well-acquainted with him very early on in my friendship with Sherlock, but because of his position and responsibilities, for years I could not reveal that Sherlock even had a brother.
Mycroft nodded. Despite his inarticulate spluttering, he knew that the nurse was not just competent but genuinely concerned for his brother, as was the night nurse, and he thought that the idea to provide him with a different medium in which to express himself was inspired. He was also keenly aware that the choice of crayons was more than appropriate.
Sherlock Holmes is not handsome in a conventional way. His hawk-like nose, gaunt frame, and deep-sunk eyes are nothing like the broad-shouldered and ruddy-cheeked gentlemen that peer out at one from the pages of the popular magazines. He is most certainly no advertisement.
He scowled as he considered this.
The other nurse opened her mouth, trying to parse a reply. She felt awful about the whole thing.
Ex-boyfriend?
“Yeah... sorry.”
I did know. His horrible, dark moods and equally horrible periods of mania were, to be blunt, not normal, and although I have touched on them in my published writing, only I, his brother, and our dedicated landlady knew the true extent of it all.
“What happened?” I demanded, instantly kneeling to examine her.
Sherlock coughed, waving cigarette smoke from his face.
“You have certainly been needed to apply your skills in rather urgent circumstances on some of your cases,” Mr. Bloom blurted out. I was surprised that he did not burst into flames from the look his wife gave him.
“So, she knew that you did not… that you had not got far in school?”
I was horrified. I found that my hands were shaking. I clutched the letter until it was quite a wadded mess.
And then it all came tumbling out of him.
“But why can you not—or why do you choose to not—control yourself?”
And he had done it, hadn’t he?
I closed the door and sat her down, then sat down myself. I did not wish to be intimidating in any manner. “Please tell me what you have been experiencing,” I said simply.
“No?” He raised his head and looked me in the eye, clearly astounded by this revelation.
“No. It was a long night. I will attend to the most immediate of my responsibilities from here. I wish to remain close at hand in case… my brother needs my attention.”
“What did you get, love?” Greg prodded.
“Oh, Mrs. Hudson,” I managed. And then I paused—Sherlock would be proud as I did some rapid deductions from her words and calculations in my head. “I am sorry, but did you say disfigured?”
John dragged his shopping list out of his pocket, then looked at his trolley. Damn. He had somehow not put half the items he needed into it and would have to backtrack. He shook his head, willing himself to concentrate.
stable, John. There were a great
“Did you ruin your hat as well?” I asked as I gently ran the sudsy cloth over the dark curls.
As she was with everything pertaining to the running of the house, she was direct and firm with each applicant. The first had been terrified by this, for some reason—and I really do not understand this because I can discern the difference between firm and stern—and of course would not have lasted five minutes under our roof.
“You are wondering if it ever bothers me that our behaviour is, in fact, strictly forbidden in the Bible.”
I could not help myself one moment longer. I burst out laughing. “Oh, the horror!” I exclaimed. “You do know that Mr. Wilde was arrested for a bit more than wearing ‘aesthetic’ outfits?”
The older brother waited patiently, the slightest of smiles crossing his lips. Sherlock would never be able to come up with one word to describe everything that the ex-army captain had been to him. What they had been to one another. There simply wasn’t one—at least in English.
“You have,” I replied encouragingly.
Finally, with some wheedling, begging, bargaining, shouting, and finally commanding, John had gotten the thin man down into their landlady’s flat for a festive Christmas dinner.
Her mouth fell open. “By... what?”
I hoped that he had gotten some sleep.
“Yes. It was definitely smallpox, not cholera or typhus.”
It was that last thought that, fortunately, brought me to my senses—at least somewhat. As I considered the possible dire consequences of being revealed, my lust (and there is no other word for it) began to gradually diminish, just as ice cream in its dainty dish slowly loses its shape and texture when left out.
Oh, my darling’s face! He is just the loveliest thing in the world. I began by getting the sponge good and wet, and then wringing it out over that glorious, uproarious head of dark hair. The curls, in protest of the heat, apparently, had sprung up everywhere, but they are so very dense that I had to work a bit to get the lovely, cool water to his scalp and douse his brilliant and overheated head.
As always, Sherlock was not at all modest, barely noticing when the last layer—pants so worn they were really just a waistband and a memory—had been carefully lowered. He allowed his brother to steady him as he stepped into the tub, first gasping at the touch of the hot water, then slowly lowering himself down into it with a sigh of contentment.
The nurse’s mouth fell open in shock.
I was away several hours. Mr. Thatcher was, indeed, quite ill. He was an older man—quite old for having a daughter of Miss Thatcher’ age, I thought. I could hear his laboured breathing before the young lady had even shown me to his bedroom—they had rooms over his shop—and I knew that I had my work cut out for me.
Or was it?
His brother shook his head and, scowling, flapped the blanket ends a bit.
“Surely, Watson, you are aware that governing this empire is not simply a matter of signing papers and making speeches.”
“Low blood sugar,” John offered, still staring daggers at the taller man. “Probably time we got something to eat.”
John sat up in bed and groaned. He knew what had woken him up. A sound. A noise.
“Mrs. Bloom, you have accused my dear friend Watson of some heinous behaviour, and, what is worse, you accuse
“But then as I examined the crime scene, those feelings resurfaced?”
“Do they not have a servant to tend to the household?”
immoral behaviour is apparently as difficult as performing acts of goodness. It is simple enough to
“Oh, that’s a corgi; isn’t it adorable?” The shop girl beamed as she held up one of the baubles.
“Please, can we not speak of it any longer?” He sounded exhausted. He
“You love that I’m a brat,” he responded, smiling smugly at me as he held his arm out.
And with those five words, I knew that all would be well.
“What upsets you so?” I had asked for what seemed like the hundredth time.
“Not do?” I pictured our dear landlady bustling about, going up and down the stairs. Ah. “We do not cook.”
My chest suddenly felt tight. I kissed the crown of dark curls. “I knew he was cruel in his words and attitude towards you, but why have you never shared with me that he was also so hard on you in this manner?”
Mrs. Hudson snorted in amusement. “I look forward to that,” she stated, turning to precede me down the stairs.
“And once there, I was attending to your investigations—I assure you I was, but… my love—you are just so very beautiful. When we are intimate together, I cannot think of a single other thing. And sometimes—yes—it does spill into other times of our lives.” I took a deep breath.
“Not at all,” I admitted. “He does not seem to feel the heat the way most people do, though.”
“I have dressed in that fashion, more than once.”
Greg patted his shoulder. “I know. I feel the same way. Thank you for having me here for this.” And then something occurred to him. “Did Mycroft really get him those things?”
I decided to humour him. “How did he look at the waiter, then?”
I cannot describe the noise that issued from my dear friend’s throat. It was anguish and sorrow. It was anger and frustration. I rose and took the few steps I needed to be in front of him. I took his injured hands in mine and looked into his eyes. “Sherlock?” I said quietly. He shook his head, unable to speak.
“Try harder not to forget the rules?”
“Several times, yes. This is the fourth that I know of definitively and I suspect there were a few incidents at a time when I was abroad.”
Those were the only things? Wasn’t there something else? Someone else? He remembered someone who would sit and listen to him play for hours—someone on whom he himself could focus, shutting everything else out, for hours.
My dearest John,
“Sounds good, mate.”
Yes. Get out of there. Excellent idea.
“Lord, he can type,” the nurse exclaimed shortly.
No. He wasn’t fine. He wasn’t safe. He wasn’t supposed to be at Mycroft’s. He wasn’t supposed to have a nurse. John did all that. John took care of him. Where was John?
“As I have already explained, he had lost a ring. Do keep up. Ow!” His exclamation was the result of me applying the nail brush perhaps a bit more vigorously than was necessary.
“He could not bring himself to do so on his own behalf—in either guise. He was quite panicked. I regretted not being able to bring you with me, particularly then, as he seemed quite on the verge of a nervous collapse. Having a doctor there would have been reassuring, for I had no idea what to do for him.”
He considered this.
“These periods of mania of this intensity are rare for him, fortunately. I have not seen him this bad for quite some time.”
His little brother nodded.
Sherlock is locked in the next room, all by himself. I hope that he is not too cold. We cannot allow him a fire or even a candle at the moment; the risk of him setting fire to the curtains or bedclothes is too great. Everything has been removed from the room, in fact, except for the bed and a few books (we have decided that he cannot do much harm to himself or anyone else even if he throws them) and some paper and pencils. When it becomes dark he can neither read nor write, but there is nothing else to be done.
“What?” I exclaimed in (mock) horror, the anxiety of the moment dissipated.
“Eventually. But, dear brother, you have to admit that it becomes more and more difficult for you to recover yourself.”
“Doctor Watson,” she repeated somewhat sharply, “I am not as delicate as you may think. Tell me honestly how you are doing.”
of the locals were a bit reticent, but in most of the shops I was told—and this will come as no surprise after today’s exchange—that Mrs. Bloom is considered a rather fussy customer.”
“Good lad. Now, you must be a brave pirate. I’m going to give you an injection, right over your eye. It might hurt a bit, but then you won’t be able to feel it when I stitch you up. All right?”
“Sherlock, I was so rigid I found it nearly impossible to dress until I recalled the maggots that you assured me would remain on your table (and they did not),” I reported grimly.
So that was how we had ended up in my bedroom, with my darling draped rather decoratively across the bed and being no help whatsoever—I was most assuredly home. And now I had drawn out of my valise some new articles of clothing that I had purchased during my absence from our home, eliciting his exclamation—and I admit that I was a bit cruel to threaten to leave again.
The DI wandered into the kitchen with the crumbled wrapping paper in his hands. He tossed it in the bin and then leaned against the counter, watching the doctor as he retrieved mugs.
hearing a sound?
It is not being in a deep, dark hole. It is that the hole is in oneself—a deep pit in the chest that feels as if nothing will ever fill it.
When I was finally able to get a few sips in, Sherlock nodded vigorously. “That is well,” he commented, taking a sip from his own glass. “You have often commented on the calming effects of brandy, and you must be calm, for now we must discuss our plans for tomorrow.”
Really? The scene that he took in with once sharp glance made him sigh. There was David, one of his oldest assistants, and Malcolm, the gardener. Both men were kneeling, one on either side of… really?
“I can manage on my own. I am so foul and I feel so vile. You should not have to do this.”
So, when he had arrived in England, he hadn’t looked like that. He had been, if not well-dressed, at least not in the rags he had had to peel off him immediately after his retrieval. His hair had grown out naturally and was back to its usual dark curls. It had to have been trimmed at least two months earlier, but not since (Mycroft was aware that Sherlock had been dyeing and styling it differently with each undercover identity, at least in the beginning; obviously at some point he had stopped). When they picked him up, he had clearly been clean-shaven at some point, but hadn’t shaved at all in—how long? A week? Longer? Filthy but not overly-long fingernails. They knew how and when he had gotten the injury to his temple, but what about the rest of him? What were the ages of the other injuries to his person?
“Do you want to write something?” The doctor offered his clipboard and pen. Sherlock’s writing sprawled across the paper. He wrote rather slowly, they all noted, and seemed to be concentrating quite hard, but then he handed the clipboard back to the doctor. “Germanium-nickel-uranium-sulphur?” he read aloud, struggling a bit to decipher both the handwriting and the spelling. He had transposed several sets of letters.
I know nothing whatsoever about china, or silver, or crystal. We received a great deal of all of that when we were married—Mary and I—but that was one of those things at which I was doomed to “fail” as a husband. Mrs. Hudson’s familiar settings are, I am sure, not terribly fine, but we are (Sherlock is) hard on delicate objects and I am certain that she does not on a regular basis use her “best” for us. Clients—now that I consider it, I do believe that she does bring out the finer china when serving tea to a lady or gentleman. I am certain that for our friend Lestrade, she does not go to such ends. And I am equally certain that neither he nor Sherlock nor I cares one whit.
That leads me to the second accusation I hurled at you that day—that your time at war was characterised by a false bravery buoyed by bright uniforms and the self-importance of the soldiers of our mighty nation. You are, in fact, the bravest man I know. I have endangered your life so many times, and you have never once shirked even the most unpleasant and hazardous of circumstances. How I could let such a falsehood pass my lips is inexcusable.
Both our client and his maid had seemed genuinely surprised for not having realised that the latch was not operating properly, so it was unlikely to have been in that condition for long.
Astonished, I sat on the foot of the bed. “
“You did half the work,” the doctor reminded him, smiling at the empty plate in front of him. “And now, if you do half the washing up, I will consider it a Christmas miracle.”
The security director, whose hand was still extended, stared as the undeniably most brilliant but rudest man he had ever encountered hung his head at the shorter man’s command. “Sorry,” he mumbled into his scarf.
“I’m asking about what
Yes, the person I love is very much a man, as am I, and he has an organ like mine, and here in my private writing I can admit that even though I have enjoyed—
“Your hands are in need of re-bandaging,” I finally said. “Will you allow me?”
If I did not know him better, I would have been jealous. As it was, I was aware that his every word—his every tip of the head or placement of graceful fingers on Mr. Bloom’s arm—was an act delivered with the express purpose of steering our encounter in the desired direction. Somehow, even in the midst of my anguish, I was aware of his mastery and command of the situation and had the greatest hope that he would somehow reconcile the entire debacle.
Then—and only then—did he begin to draw with them on the clean, white A4 paper the nurse had found for him.
“Surely just asking after an injured man wouldn’t raise any alarms.”
The woman—who reminded him of someone, but he couldn’t put his finger on who just then—returned with a glass of water in one hand and a neatly-folded flannel in the other. “Come sit back down,” she said firmly.
“I should certainly hope so,” he snapped back, but it seemed to be without his usual vehemence. “I have to admit that I am impressed.”
Both Sherlock and I, our eyes wide, looked in astonishment at Mr. Bloom.
Batteries were inserted, and Greg grinned as Sherlock immediately figured out how to make both the lights and the sounds work.
To hear him say anything at all.
From the first, there was an admiration—an
Oh, yes, my escape. I withdrew my handkerchief from my pocket and blotted the perspiration from my face and considered what had occurred that had compelled my retreat.
Was he back at his flat on Montague? Probably. Staying with his brother or his parents had never worked.
“Yes, it is acceptable as your doctor,” I assured him. “Now, when we are done, will you make me happy and lie down for a while?”
Sherlock shrugged, slouching back into the sitting room and handing John his glass.
Numbers—years—were still rattling around in my head, and I clearly have been living with Sherlock for far too long, because the question sprang from my lips heedless of decorum. I am still, as I write this, burning with shame, but I must record here my terrible question.
The detective frowned and took a generous sip of his wine.
Why not? I did as had been suggested. He had even left me my current book so I could read while enjoying my refreshment. When I was done, I removed my boots, deposited them by the door, and discovered a third note inside my left slipper.
God, he missed Sherlock shouting at the characters.
I had, as you accurately included in your story, told you about the baboon and the cheetah, but of course I had at that time just mentioned a few of the animals—the most dangerous ones, for your own safety. There were several other species on the property. One of these animals was a bonnet macaque, a very small subspecies of monkey native to India. In fact, there were six of these creatures. For the most part, they preferred to live with the gypsies, who apparently spoiled them with attention and food. You might be familiar with these animals. Due to their size, relatively simple diets (they eat primarily fruits and vegetables), extreme dexterity, and somewhat agreeable temperaments if not provoked, they are often trained as performing animals, some even being dressed in small outfits. They have tiny, human-like hands and very long tails.
God, John missed him. He was not gay. He had never—not before Sherlock—even fantasied about being with another man—but now, there was nothing unless it included ivory skin, dark curls, and a baritone voice that sent shivers straight through him.
I have just had Sherlock Holmes in my lap, and I adored it.
“Exactly. Now, what changes would you expect a household to demonstrate if it has been reduced from two people to one? Recall that I was getting my information primarily from the shopkeepers.”
I did not like to see him ill or injured, of course, but I did revel in the opportunity to take a hold of his sinewy arm; put a comforting and supportive arm around his waist. Touching him to take his pulse or check for fever thrilled me.
“Idiot! Have to find him… Let me go home!”
“Christ! How is he doing this?”
“Thank you.” Greg sat back, tore the paper off, and opened the thin cardboard box. “Hey, nice! Thanks!” he said sincerely at the sight of the elegant grey shirt and matching tie.
Mrs. Harold Bloom.
“Not going home.”
“Yes, thank you,” I repeated, watching as she deftly laid the table. I had not had much of an appetite the whole day, and now I found myself ravenous. The cold duck looked delicious. “I shall clear the table and bring the tray down myself later,” I added.
but he couldn’t wouldn’t would he ever ever again oh god please let him again let them again
“Why were you… let us start at the beginning. Let me.” I moved to perch myself on the edge of the bathtub and put out my hand for the flannel and soap, which he handed over with a sigh. I rubbed them briskly together, creating a lovely-smelling lather, and then began at the top.
It was mid-August, and my dream had been somewhat prescient, as the day was turning out to be positively sultry. Although Sherlock was dressed in his usual frock coat, with a light grey silk waistcoat, crisp white collar and cuffs, and black tie, I had chosen one of my lightest suits. Our client—a Mr. Charles Harper—was attired similarly to me.
Does she know that I often stand far more closely than is necessary to Sherlock? Does she realise that both of us touch the other’s hands and arms and even faces far more often than what might be considered decent? That we press our legs together when seated in a hansom?
“Her daughter was attending her—she was about twelve, and seemed quite sharp and responsible—and she said that she would get her mother safely home.”
He was restless. After absent-mindedly handing me both glasses (I put the second on the small table beside my chair), he retrieved a cigarette and lit it, gazing into the cloud of smoke, deep in thought.
“It did not seem terribly sincere.”
“That is a rather strong statement,” I managed. “Mr Holmes is quite eccentric, but he is most certainly not evil.”
“Nothing new under the sun,” he agreed. “I was hoping against hope to discovering something new and definitive—but do not be concerned. It could very well be that there is nothing definitive beyond what you have mentioned. It is simply how my brother’s mind works. I suppose we can consider ourselves fortunate that this particular manifestation of his illness is an infrequent one, and each time that he was previously struck he did eventually recover.”
“Wet,” his brother announced.
“What?” The rocking did not cease or even slow; it was apparent that he was completely unaware of what he was doing.
I am glad we have no need of such trappings of domestic life—china and forks and the like. We do not need those things for you to know that I do love you.
“He should eat something before he begins to take any tablets,” someone remarked.
She looked at me keenly. “Doctor Watson?” she ventured, “Is there something amiss? Oh, I should not be telling you such a terrible story.”
It had been many, many years since he had taken any classes about biology, but he was perfectly capable of reading the doctor’s report and he did understand what
So, he carefully trimmed the head of thick, dark curls and delicately shaved the horribly thin face and did not once even open his mouth except to ask him to sit up a bit; lift his chin.
“So…” I prodded.
“Where do you think he’s headed?” Anthea asked.
I did have a vague notion of your activities, as my own dear husband occasionally indulges in reading some rather fantastic stories—although I do attempt to dissuade him, and to entice him with much more wholesome fare—and he sometimes shares with me some details from your pieces in The Strand. Since my return, I have taken it upon myself to seek out and read some of these lurid tales myself.
“Thank you.” I did so, and also eagerly consumed the eggs, toast, and kippers.
“Very well, then,” I acquiesced. “Shall we place the same advertisement?”
He paces and pokes at the piles of papers that litter our rooms and fill every corner, sometimes tipping them over in despair and frustration. He tugs at his clothing. He tosses correspondence to the floor. He does a great deal of damage to the mantelpiece and even the furniture with his knife, and I have taken it away from him on several occasions.
No, I had no idea what that little phrase truly meant. Here is what transpired—
Mycroft sighed and let his head sink into his hands. His elbows were resting on his immense dining room table. He had shoved his dinner—mostly untouched—away from himself, across the glossy surface.
He sighed. He was stretched out upon my bed, watching me keenly as I drew my clothes out of my valise and put them away. He had been curled around my case, on his side, but now he gracefully rolled onto his back and, dropping his head over the edge of the mattress, continued to observe me, now upside-down.
Sherlock has interjected along the margin]
Now, I must admit to a bit of negligence on my part. It was not a deliberate oversight, and I pray that you will forgive me. I am sure you understand that at the time I was under a great deal of duress and not quite myself, and that immediately afterwards I wished nothing more than to suppress any thoughts of what had occurred that dreadful night.
“Yes, precisely,” he snapped.
Then he deliberately pushed the thought out of his head. He didn’t need to go there. He had been going there far too often lately.
The thing was—if he had shown the least bit of discomfort or confusion, she would have stopped. Really. Honestly. It was just that he—hadn’t.
“What?” Mycroft demanded.
“I was not certain until our encounter this afternoon.”
He raised his head and stared at me quite ruefully.
a table) in his house with the bullet-proof window glass and the triple-failsafe alarm system and the motion sensors and cameras and the panic room(s) and the grand piano and…
“I don’t think that you are,” I responded. “Let me check you.”
Not even when he fell heavily to the floor, mumbling a string of numbers.
It would be hours before he could fall asleep again.
“I... might have gotten that months ago.”
This time when he woke up he was a little afraid, but he knew that he was safe under his blanket and no one could sneak up behind him because he was… invibiz… invizle… Big Brother’s dressing gown made it so no one could see him.
“Yes, he does. Let him have a good soak,” she suggested. “I’ll take these down to be washed,” she added as she gathered up the wet clothing.
So I left them alone and rang the bell and when Mrs Hudson came up I stopped her from entering the room; I withdrew with her to the hallway and whispered, “Who is that? What is this all about?”
We were doomed.
What had he done?
He nearly dropped his lens in his shock. I had never done such a thing, not even during our first case together, when I was still weakened by my war injuries and subsequent illness.
“I hate doing it. I think it’s confusing him more than he already is, but he was hyperventilating. I did get him to take the tablets instead of an injection, at least, and he seemed to understand that I was trying to help him, not hurt him, but I’m still not sure it’s always the best thing for him.”
“Will you pick it up?”
“What’s the matter?” his brother asked. “It’s perfectly safe.” He tried to pull away, but Mycroft had a good grip on his hand. He kept his tone of voice as even as he could. “You’re going to come home with me for a bit. All right?”
“John,” he said—and his voice had a bit of that “must I explain this to an idiot” tone— “I am hardly in a respectable line of work. I consort freely with people from all walks of life, including the very lowest. I have had murderers to tea and been seen dining with prostitutes. I know more about the dirty, unseemly side of the so-called upper class than anyone. Illegitimate heirs traced; secret marriages exposed.
you to come home, but yes, I did mean that you would do better to stay away—perhaps find someone normal to be with. I am a horrible, hateful person and do not deserve to have you here.”
“And then, when Mr. Harper helped you on with your coat and walked you to the street—well, I do not wish to be indelicate, but your condition was rather apparent to me.”
“I have an older brother who is currently not my problem, nor am I his.” The shrug of careless disregard was rather theatrical.
“He’s… his appetite is off,” she offered. She had been warned that the elder Holmes brother was some high mucky-muck in the government and a prick about details, but that he also obviously loved his younger brother because it was “no expense spared” and he had, in actuality, given up his own bedroom for the slender man.
“It’s not allergies, but he’ll still be sick if you force him to eat that,” Mrs Parker stated firmly.
Very sweet. Extra sweet. He liked that. He wasn’t usually allowed to do that. Someone told him not to; that it was bad for him.
“Did she not attend school before then?”
“Are you all right, Sherlock?” his brother asked. Anthea, observing from behind him, caught the slightest note of anxiety in his voice. “What were you doing?”
in the manure?” I asked.
“Once again, I cannot deny that. It had come so that I knew that I was making my wife unhappy with my inattentiveness to our home life, and I admit that I withdrew to my club to avoid unhappy scenes in the evenings. This was by no means honourable behaviour, I will admit, but it was not a crime.” I managed to keep the note of triumph from my voice.
John squatted down and looked up into his eyes. Sherlock frowned and tried to gaze back at him, but he appeared to be having trouble focusing. The doctor reached for the healing injury on his temple and the younger man flinched, but only after a slight pause. “God, did you have to dope him up so much?” the doctor growled.
A wild and unbecoming and almost grotesque thought formed in my mind. What if she and Sherlock’s elder brother got married?
“What do we do?” I considered this. “We... carry the coal and heat the bath water ourselves. We attempt to manage the laundry being brought in and out. Take in the deliveries and the post. Attend to the cleanliness of our rooms—empty our pots ourselves.”
The second part of her sentence came out all in a rush. That was guilt, for sure.
“No, I suppose I do not,” Mr. Harper admitted in some puzzlement. “I admit that I am not terribly interested in my garden—in gardens in general. As long as the lawn is kept short for tennis and croquet, I honestly do not care in the slightest about flowers,” our client explained.
“Harry?” he asked unnecessarily.
“New nurse, is it?”
“Why don’t you just try?” the nurse encouraged, putting out a hand.
Mycroft’s calm façade faltered just the slightest bit. “No, Sherlock, I have not,” he stated, glancing at me and mouthing
“I am!”
As I cannot do that, I must do the next best thing and explain to you that I truly did not mean a single thing I said. I was frustrated and angry at myself for not solving that case more quickly, and although I blamed you, it most certainly was no fault of yours.
“I see,” John nodded sagely. “Murders and whatnot?”
“Now what would you want an eye patch for?” He suspected he already knew the answer and smiled at the mum, who was looking a bit calmer.
It was painfully apparent that he would not be able to undress himself. I ushered him into his bedroom, got him seated on the bed, and began to remove his formal garments. Even now—out of habit, apparently—he sat straight, but he seemed unaware of my attentions. I found his nightclothes and gently (affectionately?) garbed him in them.
He knew that there were more samples that probably should have been gathered before he bathed, but he found himself so completely unwilling as to be repulsed just by the idea. It wouldn’t matter anyway, would it? It was extremely unlikely that the perpetrators of any of the dozens (at least) of assaults fell under any sort of category of common criminal. The people he would be looking for would not ever be appearing in any sort of regular court, that was certain—no DNA evidence required.
I—then and now, as I write this—marvel (and wonder) at her concern over his well-being, and I am more than touched by her solicitude for him. Our Sherlock is like the finest of china—admirable under heat, but unable to weather the slightest blow.
And in all of this, there is Sherlock, and there is me.
“No?”
Wordlessly, he held up a long box with a clear plastic front.
“No, there is not tea—not for you. You are to remove all of that muck and get into the bath immediately.” I pointed sternly down the hallway towards the bath-room.
“Yes, your body does,” I agreed. “Why are you having such a difficult time understanding this?”
“If I order something, will you at least try some of it?” John peered at the short food menu. He was grateful that the security chief had steered them towards the bar. The food menu there was just nibbles rather than full meals; he was much more likely to find something that wouldn’t overwhelm Sherlock here than a full-service establishment. He held his thumb over the prices as much as he could; for once he was selecting items because they sounded good rather than whatever was least expensive.
And of course that leads me to wonder how much more of your writing is invention—sick fancy. Are there truly any people to worry about their reputations? Or are they all inventions of your sick mind? Your wife told me that Mr. Holmes is a mad man; that he has bouts of insanity. Who is to say that any of these so-called cases ever happened? How could they have? Is he so mad that he believes it all to be real? Is that it? Do you take his flights of fancy and sick inventions of murder and robbery and turn them to your own benefit? I understand that you make far more from your writing than you ever did from your failed practice. I do note that the law is not involved in many of these ‘cases’—is that because they do not actually exist? How Scotland Yard turns a blind eye to this—I am at a loss.
The eye rolling was BAFTA-worthy, but the thin man retrieved the wrapped box and shoved it into the DI’s hands. “Merry Christmas,” he mumbled as he slumped next to him on the sofa.
“Come on. Your brother will be right behind us. Let’s get this done so we can get out of here.”
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
“He was found wandering around outside,” he informed her coldly.
“Of course, my love.”
“Also being delivered shortly.” She smiled the tiniest bit.
He obediently held his hands out to her as she wiped them with a warm, wet flannel, then startled her by grabbing it and bringing it to his mouth. It was that gesture—so reminiscent of her little brother when he was a toddler—that decided her.
“It explains a lot,” the other nurse agreed.
you know about it?” he inquired gently, as if afraid to spook the man.
“No, sir.”
She sighed. “Please. You cannot do this. He cannot manage without you by his side. When you leave him like this, you know that he does not eat or sleep. I do not wish for him to sink into one of his spells of melancholia.”
“I cannot take it all, of course—I will be able to purchase new clothes in New York,” he murmured, balancing two folded shirts, one in each hand, and examining each closely. He dropped one into the case and dropped the other to the floor. He did not glance in our direction or indicate in any way whatsoever that he was aware of our presence.
“Stop talking about her!”
“I got you more of that tobacco you mentioned enjoying last week. Have a smoke. –Sherlock”
I considered lying on Sherlock’s bed, my drawers pulled down and my hand on my prick.
“No idea, but he’s all right. It’s all fairly harmless.”
The scowl turned into a frown of bafflement. “What do you mean? I’ve had presents from everyone I know and a great number of people I don’t know.” He gestured toward Greg’s gift to him—a book about forensic psychology.
That he had chosen me—dull, ordinary John Watson—well. I am still flabbergasted.
A slight motion; Sherlock must have nodded.
“I am a moral woman,” she began—
I am alone in our sitting room. Sherlock has retreated to the bedroom—the window now repaired—and has banned me from entering. His anger and despair frighten me, but I do not wish to intrude. He is entitled to his privacy and his thoughts.
“Coming!” he called out, never taking his eyes off the body of the pale naked man helpless on his bed. He grabbed the cheap duvet from where it had fallen onto the floor and, with an abrupt motion, covered him from the chest down, being careful to ensure that the bed frame and ties were obscured.
“Absolutely,” I assured her, assuming my best “gruff doctor voice,” which made her smile.
She knew he despised turkey and, after an unfortunate incident involving sub-standard refrigeration, goose as well, so she had done roast beef. Per Sherlock’s preference (and hers, to be honest), she had done it extremely rare, and John had skilfully removed almost paper-thin slices from it, placing small portions on each of their plates.
“Lavender. Right,” the young man who had been attempting to assist them agreed numbly.
“Sherlock,” I said quietly, “I’ve brought your violin.”
“What have you been up to?” Winifred asked Solomon suspiciously. “Hey. You. Drink your milk, love, and finish up that lovely mousse.”
“It shall be both of us,” he finished, nodding his head in affirmation.
“Leave him alone. Grab a chair.” Victor indicated a small stack of folding chairs leaning up against a wall. They looked suspiciously like they had been liberated from… well, the local funeral director was likely not pleased. They were erected around the tiny table. Victor produced a pack of cards, each grabbed a bottle of beer, and they began to play.
“I am
He smiled gently. “You told me,” he replied.
That was a rather ominous statement.
“You all right?”
“I brought some vitamin E lotion. It should help.”
I gave him a moment, sipping my sherry and watching the firelight dance across his fine features. Then I broke into his reverie. “Sherlock,” I said quietly, “may I interrupt?”
“Well... I made some inquiries when I went out this morning.”
“Well... I...”
It is now ten o’clock and—here is his warm milk. I believe that I will encourage him to put on nightclothes and see if he will lie down with me in an hour. The lightness of the mood in our rooms is such a welcome change.
“What about your brother? Despite your father’s precautions, I am certain that his powerful observational skills detected all.”
“Come have some tea, then. You always like that,” I cajoled.
And then the image of exactly what had greeted the maid leapt out at me and I could not contain myself—I burst into laughter.
“Really? How indiscreet... of our landlady, and the thousands like her, who take in lodgers to support themselves.”
The last time he had gotten a new suit he had been with… He had been with Sherlock—had been taken shopping by him, actually. They were going to be attending some fancy dinner at his brother’s and Mycroft had apparently suggested that the doctor’s wardrobe was not up to snuff.
I made quick work with my sponge—and every stroke of it drew from him a whispered sigh of satisfaction; of contentedness; of desire. He was, without a doubt, in desperate need of a bath, and I was vigorous in my ablutions. And then I was done and he was fresh and clean and both of us were so very rigid and without preamble I engulfed him with my eager mouth and at the same time stirred his balls until he became quite speechless and rather unsure of his legs and it was a simple thing to tip him onto the bed and to rip off my own trousers and as I rather violently attacked his lips with my own my prick encountered his and I moaned and I thrust and I grasped at him and he at me and I knew that all my hard work with the sponge was going to waste as we both grew hot and soon soaked with perspiration as I continued to almost angrily thrust against his lovely cock and then I wanted to take it in my mouth again but—
Mycroft scowled at the sight of his brother, pale and dazed and silent and vague, slumped sideways on the sofa, his bare feet protruding from the blanket spread over him. “What upset him?” he demanded, observing the sluggish movement of his brother’s eyes uneasily.
The nurse looked across the table. “He’s not usually like this, is he?” she asked Mycroft, watching him slowly dip an orange segment first into the tea and then into the jar of marmalade. “I know who he is, and that he’s been gone for a long time. His physical condition speaks for itself. I don’t need to know any more about that, but I do need to know about his usual behaviour so I can note any signs—well, any
“Oh, Daniel,” she called out to a tall, dark-haired man close by. “This is an old acquaintance from
“Do you mean that?” I managed. “You would have him tended here and not sent to one of those awful places?”
“But if he’s not here, won’t he be a target for—”
His was as well; he cleared it before continuing. “So… you see… I could not return to the farm. I wanted to know more about the folks who suffered as my sister did. I wanted to see them treated better.”
By then the visitors had ceased, and they retreated upstairs gratefully. Sherlock had noticed—for the first time, apparently—the decorations.
Waiting in the blackness of that room; straining our ears to hear the peculiar whistle—and Sherlock instructing that I take the chair and him the bed—all of that I have faithfully recorded. I admit that I was momentarily disappointed by his instruction, wishing to be next to him, but swallowed my objections. As we were maintaining absolute silence, I could not have spoken anyway—but in fact in retrospect I was grateful for it, for, as I would learn later, Sherlock’s reason for this might have saved my life.
“Perhaps I will not shout, my darling, but until you tell me what occurred neither of us will know. Come sit up here with me.” As I so often did, I arranged him on my lap. “Now, will you tell me what happened? What did you forget?”
That Mycroft’s servants are of the most discreet natures possible is not even a question. “They do not question my orders, nor do they discuss them, nor any of my guests,” he proclaimed. “No one would dare breathe a word about my brother--and if anyone ever
“I had those bruises ‘round my neck—from that dreadful man in Battersea? My collar was causing me a great deal of discomfort… but then I recalled the trials of our friend Mr. Wilde and came to my senses.”
“You’re correct,” Mycroft apologised, snatching up an ashtray and stubbing the offending object out. “Here, Sherlock.” He held the ashtray out and, reluctantly, his brother echoed his action. The nurse yanked the heavy crystal object from him and spun around, walking hurriedly out of the room with it.
It was a pirate pistol.
—that I had never experienced with anyone else. His interest in me, his inclusion of me in his cases—insistence, really—his complete ease (to the point of immodesty) around me—how could I have not construed it?
“Good job!” the nurse praised him. “That was a definite success,” he remarked to the housekeeper as she took up the empty plate.
“It’s all right, love,” she murmured. “You can go to sleep. She won’t be coming back.”
Lestrade nodded to the two men who now approached the body with a gurney and body bag. When he looked back at his odd companion, he was alarmed to see that his expression had changed once again—as had his colour. Even in the oddly-tinted glow of the street lights, Greg could see that he was going not just white but grey. Shit. Bugger was going to…
We had left in a rush, of course, and even though Mrs. Hudson had tided and cleaned as she had promised (threatened), there is still that air of chaos that makes our rooms so homely. There on the mantel was one of my pipes (not my favourite, which I of course had taken with me). There was one of Sherlock’s magnifying glasses tucked across the tops of some books. He somehow miraculously left his table of chemicals and scientific equipment surprisingly clean, but there were a few odd objects left there regardless—one left-hand glove of dark green leather, the dried-up bits of some sort of shrubbery, and a letter from which a corner had been torn and, I recall, tested to confirm the presence of something-or-other that he proclaimed brilliant and devilish and led to him seizing his violin and playing me a merry few hours of tunes in triumph.
“Mrs Turner. Mrs Hudson must stay off her feet until she is healed, and we are considering who might assist in the running of the house.”
I chuckled as I crossed the room to the fireplace, where, having adopted Sherlock’s habit, I tended to leave my pipes decorating the mantelpiece. I was not, at this point, surprised to find a fifth missive underneath my favourite one.
And so, we finished our meal. As I had promised, I stacked the plates and whatnot back on the tray and placed it, covered, on the sideboard. Whilst I was doing so, Sherlock wandered into his bedroom and changed his coat for a dressing gown, then retrieved my smoking jacket. I accepted it and made myself comfortable before falling into my chair.
[The good doctor has cut the ad out of the newspaper and neatly glued it at this point in his narrative.]
He was being very quiet—very still—just observing everything, and Solomon gave him one final, thoughtful look before dropping the capped syringe in his pocket. Maybe this trip would go all right.
“It is… I am not ignorant of this morning’s… situation,” he admitted haltingly.
[John has replied:
“Skin. Yes. The skin on my knees is rough. Too much creeping about at crime scenes, I suppose.”
than capable of expressing her views on any other subject.”
“The ear case? What does that have to do with it?”
All right, so maybe not. So maybe “showing off” was a better term. Swaggering and being rather horribly rude to Molly (he did feel bad about that in a vague way; he had been so flummoxed by her crush on him back then). Being so very clever about getting his hands on John’s mobile (of course he knew that Stamford didn’t have his on him—he was always leaving it somewhere) and the thrill that had run through him when he felt it touch his hand. He had never felt anything like that before.
“He was… agitated.”
Yes, he had. Even though they had lost track of Sherlock months—many months—earlier, every target he hit—every operative he took out—they knew he was still alive; still working.
“I’m not leaving until someone… him. I’ll speak with him.”
The detective smirked... and then—there was the
“Mycroft! I’m so sorry. I did not mean to injure you. Truly I didn’t. It was just that the knife was there and so were you and… and…” His speech faltered and slowed for the first time all day.
. We had a fitful night, and by morning I was grateful to rise, our bed was so uncomfortable. Oh, excuse me, please, Doctor. It must be the claret.”
I dropped the letter and nearly ran to embrace him. “My darling,” I whispered as I held his rigid frame. “It has nothing whatsoever to do about ‘deserve.’ It is true that you are not in any sense of the word ‘normal,’ but I am grateful beyond words for that. I thank God every day that you and I came together. I did try ‘normal’ for a bit—as you know—and it was a disaster. No, Sherlock—I love you, and that means every bit of you—even the less-than-loveable bits. I know that you do not intend to be cruel, even when your tongue is biting and wicked. I know that you cannot do anything about your… moods.”
Damn.
I have been reflecting on how very different our lives our now—mine and Sherlock’s—than when we first began to share diggings. At that time, the novelty of everything was nearly overwhelming—living in London, sharing rooms, and of course assisting in and chronicling the infamous exploits of the consulting detective. At the beginning, in addition to being somewhat hampered by my still-healing shoulder and leg, I was still quite weakened by my terrible injuries in Afghanistan and the subsequent illness that nearly took my life, but that of course has changed. I do wonder if I would have recovered quite so swiftly and so completely if I was not being persuaded to run across moors and climb roofs and all of the ridiculous things I do for my mad man—I believe a great deal of my recovery was simple self-preservation. And I am glad for it.
“When the waiter came ‘round with the tea, you were discussing... well, persuading Mrs. Bloom not to make a fuss about the temperature of the water, and so both of you were distracted. I was looking directly at Mr. Bloom, and he at the waiter, and his reaction, though slight, was noticeable.”
And so there he was, stretched out before me and positively beaming at something he had detected. He easily pulled himself upright and hopped down from the sill to the floor, landing lightly on the balls of his feet. He caught my eye and his grin widened. “Oh, this is a fascinating one, my dear friend,” he declared, unselfconsciously brushing the seat of his trousers with a free hand, and then he startled me by suddenly reaching toward me. “What’s this?” he exclaimed, pulling the chair next to which I was standing away from the table. “Have you counted the forks yet?”
“Has she?” I asked a bit duplicitously. I knew it to be a fact, and I knew that my darling had been spending time with our landlady—reading or talking or I know not what—but it was time that previously had not been available to her when she was so burdened with all the tasks required for tending to our rather odd household.
Very solemnly, I gave her my doctor’s permission to rise and resume her activities.
“A great deal of soft tissue damage; infection,” reported another doctor. “We’ve taken blood samples and started him on broad-spectrum antibiotics. He really should be in hospital. It would be much easier to continue examinations and treatment.”
“And that is when I left our rooms.” He remained silent. “Did you receive my letters?”
Solomon now crept back into the room warily. Winifred was seated on the sofa next to their patient and was speaking in a soothing voice to the impossibly pale man while casually taking his pulse. He was taking hitching, gasping breaths and shaking.
“What do you mean, ‘if I should not’ recover?”
Chocolate biscuits and jammie dodgers and a nice, crisp apple, sliced, peeled, and dressed with some lemon and cinnamon sugar.
How keenly he had observed the eagerness with which his brother had consumed the meals that the clever doctor created for him—so it had not been the taste of the food that had repulsed him all those years. It had been the texture and the proportions. Now it seemed to make so much sense. He truly did like many strong flavours (his dedication to vinegar was a bit alarming), but despised anything mushy, lumpy, or stringy. He liked soft, smooth foods like cream soups and chocolate mousse. He enjoyed clean, crisp bites of fresh fruit (as long as it was peeled) and the crunch of toast. (That he had a sweet tooth was a known factor, as was his love of chips and crisps and streaky bacon.) It had taken his clever and fascinating blogger to realise that even foods that he liked could be overwhelming if too much was offered at once.
“It’s not too bad, but Mummy was very smart to bring you here. I’ll get you patched up in no time.”
He spun around and slammed his back against the window, panting and wide-eyed. He lost his grip on the blanket draped over his shoulders and it slid to the floor. He looked down at himself and his mouth opened in horror. He lunged across the room and, his hands shaking terribly, swiftly retrieved pyjamas. His balance difficulties caught up with him as he attempted to slide his feet into the bottoms, but he managed to cover his legs.
When he was done, he carefully made his way to the library on the ground floor. Solomon followed. He browsed along the full shelves, occasionally removing a book. He stacked them on the table—there was a round table of heavy oak with four chairs around it—wobbling back and forth across the room unsteadily.
“Please leave off from your attentions.” He turned his face from mine. I instantly felt shame.
“Excuse me?” Mycroft raised his eyebrows in exaggerated disbelief.
“You should have seen him during the initial examination.”
Mycroft had no idea why he had kept the book all those years—years during which he had learned that yes, his little brother was perfectly capable of—and willing to—poison friends and family simply to observe the effects of some formula or other. But he had also learned that, unlike the criminally insane man profiled in the book, the younger man would not ever kill someone he was close to—the very few people he allowed himself to grow close to, that is.
Sherlock smiled a bit wickedly as he leaned against the wall and counted the cash from the wallet that he had just liberated from its owner. More than enough—more than enough to take care of the swirling horribly jumbled unfocused confusing overwhelming thoughts. He needed to focus, and he knew exactly how he was going to do that.
But ignorance it was, and Sherlock’s inability to articulate his torment—the nature of it, the cause, even the lengths of these fits that seized him…
“Doctor Watson,” she called out, “the young lady at the door requires your services.”
“But you do it anyway.” He was silent with misery at this. I felt awful. “We do not need to continue this discussion right now,” I offered. “I have missed you terribly and I want to hear about the not-murderess and her ineffective poison.”
Winifred nodded and smiled softly at him. “Don’t worry, sir. I’ve got him.”
“Get him calmed down,” the older brother hissed. “He’s going to make himself ill.”
“When you rose, were you truly stiff in that way—not just because it was morning? Because I have observed—”
Finally, Sherlock had hit a wall. He had consumed a surprising amount—one and a half pieces of toast, three-quarters of the orange, and most of his tea—but now his uninjured eye was closing of its own accord and his chin dropped to his chest a few times.
I sensed, however, that he was not himself, and therefore took the lead—a cloak for him, an overcoat for me, and silk hats for each of us, tickets in my pocket-book, and I literally guided him down the stairs to the street and hailed a cab. I realise now that it might have looked a bit odd, but in the moment I did not care one whit—I put one gloved hand on each of his shoulders and encouraged him to descend the stairs and head out the street door. He was so very complacent then—standing and waiting patiently as I whistled for a hansom. I had timed things generously, so we were not pressed to arrive at the theatre.
“So, what did you do?”
acceptable.”
“Well,” I managed, my throat tight, “you are, as usual, correct on all points. But how did you know?”
“And did not inform me.” I admit that I sounded a bit angry—even those few months together had made me protective of the man and of my relationship with him. I was jealous.
Solomon frowned. “Aren’t you?”
“First, that’s not the point, and second, she hasn’t gotten one in several years—since her father died.”
Oh, I realise now as I cast my eyes over this—I have forgotten to note the most important portion of last evening. How could I do that? Perhaps because at the time I was so overcome with emotion that I was fairly embarrassed for myself afterwards.
It was important. He knew that it was important. It was important to
[This portion was written during their confinement.]
I am certain that you can imagine my horror upon reading your story and instantly recalling with deep regret my neglect. I am afraid that you and The Strand will be receiving letters of complaint and admonishment, and I wonder if there is any way in which I could rectify this situation in some way. Perhaps I could write to the magazine editor anonymously so that an explanation might be included in their next issue?
“Of course, she would not!” Mr. Bloom blurted out.
he wasn’t speaking now
“Oh, John…”
“He’ll want something on when he gets cold,” the outgoing nurse had said. It was fine.
“Is that a ladder?” she asked, pointing.
His movements were equally distressing. In his wanderings, if a chair was in his way, he would sometimes step over rather than around it, or push it roughly out of his way. He would seize items from a table or shelf and examine them briefly, but as soon as he lost interest (which was immediately), instead of returning them to their places, he would drop them—not as one deliberately drops an item such as a boot that one has removed, but more as if he had become entirely unconscious that he was holding anything. It was fortunate that the objects he was selecting were for the most part unbreakable—the worst damage was a few crumpled pages of a book, and the pen he discarded rolled under the sofa and did not reappear until Mrs. Hudson cleaned.
“I do. I promise you as I promised our parents that I will take care of you to the best of my ability, and now I promise that I will not send you away. Those rooms are yours—and you could visit for social reasons on occasion, you know (his voice took on his usual stern and condescending tone at this)—but particularly whenever you need more care than your doctor and your landlady can offer on their own.”
And so, he was working that night—that first time. The first crime scene. The first appearance of a too-thin, strung-out young man with intense grey eyes, dark hair, and an oddly commanding voice.
“Don’t make a scene, Sherlock,” he said in a low voice. “Just get into the car. You’ve had enough of an adventure for one day. You’re still not well. You need your medication and something to eat. Wouldn’t that be better?”
John rolled over and looked blearily at the clock that glowed in the darkness of his bedroom. 3:12 a.m. He rolled back onto his back and stared up at a ceiling that he could not see. He wiped angrily at the tears that slipped down his temples.
“Simply because I sometimes must perform rather tedious tasks, it does not mean that I think that
“No. He was struck by an omnibus.”
She explained that upon mutual agreement you had completely broken off contact and indeed did not know precisely where in America she was living, nor her assumed name. To her new acquaintances in New York, she described herself as a widow of an officer in Her Majesty’s army. If pressed for more details, she would feign grief, thus embarrassing the questioning individual into a withdrawal of their inquiry.
“I was confused a great deal of the time. I did not have a nursemaid, but the housekeeper tended to me. She was frightened. She begged for my father to send for a doctor.”
“A what?”
“It is not ‘justifying’ anything,” he replied sharply. “The longer he remains here, and the better he becomes, the more his desire to leave will drive his actions. He’s already tried leaving three times. If he tries again—
“That’s getting right to it,” I commented a bit bitterly.
Mrs. Bloom apparently experienced the same epiphany as I had, but of course for her it was not a moment of victory. “’False...’” she managed, the word sticking in her throat like a fishbone.
“What? Were you badly injured? What did the doctor do?” The outrage I felt still sometimes boils up within me even now.
The gold paper glistened as he stripped it off, and then he was perfectly still, just looking.
“Art therapy?”
And then he straightened the poker, and for a short time I found myself quite distracted by his wiry frame.
“Officially, my brother audits the books of some of the government departments. Unofficially, he is the eyes and ears and sometimes the voice of those at the highest levels.”
“He was stretched out on the floor, and he put his head down for a bit, and he fell asleep like that. I don’t know what woke him—I think he was dreaming—but he absolutely flipped out.”
It had a lovely-but-fading Union Jack on it. It reminded him of the cushion—
“Now, this one’s from me.” John handed him the second package in penguin wrap.
Mr. Harper gazed at the retreating figure and then looked back at me in some surprise.
He glanced at the stack of books. There was one about chess; two about chemistry. One was about the history of the use of fingerprints in criminal investigations that had been a gift from Sherlock himself.
“He was talking about the books,” he mused. “I gave him a chemistry text and one of those old-lady murder mysteries.”
“No, he’s not usually like this,” the elder brother responded despondently, watching him as he tentatively bit into the orange segment; chewed and swallowed slowly.
“Why does this upset you so?” I demanded. I was truly confounded. “Do you believe that I think less of your abilities because I become distracted? My darling!” I cried. “I could not possibly lose my fascination with and admiration for you and your amazing abilities. You truly astound me—no matter how many times you explain what you have observed, and your deductions, and make it seem so apparent, it is anything but. Every single time, you amaze and astound me. I will never, ever grow weary of it.”
The morning of the seventh day, he rose not long after I did and joined me for breakfast. He was still having trouble eating, but he did try. I was so very proud of him.
Mycroft sighed as he set the electronic lock and alarm on his home office. He would not have admitted it to anyone, but he knew that he was moving slowly. He was exhausted by the situation with his brother, and on top of it, his reappearance had obviously necessitated the implementation of several emergency security measures for key members of the government—himself included. He had also shifted his resources; the large number of his people who had been engaged in worldwide surveillance 24/7 while his brother was away, monitoring for signs of his brother’s activities—and his brother himself—had been informed of the prodigal son’s return, but instead of giving them a break, he suggested the high probability that their target would, if he had not already done so, be returning to London.
“How long do these fits generally last?”
“No what?” He fought to keep his voice even; the familiar baritone articulating that single word with utter precision thrilled him, and he felt his heart rate increase.
He frowned at her in confusion.
I had not thought to send a message to Mrs. Hudson warning her of my arrival, which was not very wise of me, for as I was using my key to gain entry I was greeted with the quite alarming sight of our intrepid landlady bearing down upon me with an extremely heavy umbrella.
“Mmm. I suppose. I’ve discovered how a Mrs. Madison had been poisoning her husband, bit by bit.”
I nodded in understanding. The subject brought to mind the excellent Violet Hunter and one of our earliest cases together, at that dismal house five miles outside of Winchester. She had been put into that not just grotesque but ultimately quite dangerous situation specifically because she had been working with the Westaway’s agency.
I completed my unpacking and Sherlock rather decisively shut and put away my valise, as if to assure himself that I was truly returned home and would not be using it again any time soon.
“Thank you for arranging everything, Doctor,” Mrs Hudson said softly. I had found her sitting on her bed, her back against the headboard, with her foot raised by cushions. She was reading a magazine, which she laid aside when I tapped on the door before entering. She also had, next to her on the clean coverlet, two additional magazines, two novels, stationery, and a pencil. I looked down at these items in surprise.
Since he was a teen, really, his brother had been so terribly unhappy. His brilliance and observational skills, while a bit off-putting when he was a child, had not begun to actively affect his life or his sense of self until he hit puberty. That, combined with his realisation about his sexual orientation and the mess that was adolescence in general, had hit him hard. Neither Mycroft nor their parents liked to recall those years—the cutting, the lashing out, the withdrawal and depression, and eventually the drug use and associated criminal behaviour—it had been a low time for all of them. His first year at uni hadn’t been an improvement, even as Mycroft began stepping in more and more.
“Then why did it happen?”
I am exhausted. This day has been particularly difficult. I am not certain as to why. It is not the anniversary of our first meeting. Neither of us celebrate birthdays this month. It is, as I have mentioned, not yet quite three years.
I bit my lip. I knew that this was a distinct possibility. I hesitated and reconsidered our situation for a moment. But no…
It was quite simple to identify our adversary as we entered the dining room. I had only a vague recollection of her visage—I truly did not attend to our neighbours at that time—but I did recall her having a fondness for a somewhat flamboyant costume (actually, that was something Mary and I had a bit of a laugh about more than once—if there was a choice between attractive and alarming, she would inevitably select the most alarming possible. We strongly suspected that her wedding gown had been a rich, vibrant green). It was simple enough to see her in the crowd, and I indicated to the mâitre d’ that we were to join them—for she had brought her husband.
I assisted him in divesting himself of his soiled clothing. I also removed the bandages from his hands. “I will re-wrap these when you are warm and dry,” I commented. “Now, in you go.” I steadied him as he stepped over the rolled edge of the bathtub and sat with a grateful sigh in the warm water. I let him soak for a bit, then took up a flannel and soap and began with gentle ablutions to cleanse his skin. He allowed me this, and then startled me by grasping my wrist.
“Father Christmas brought some special presents for my special boy.”
She didn’t know if it was in reaction to the soft click of the switch or the light itself, but it broke through the thin veneer of sleep. His reaction was instantaneous. His eyes suddenly wide open, he shot straight up in the bed and, before she could even react, he had leapt off it, landing on the floor on the far side of it with a heavy thud.
“You reek of smoke,” I commented sternly. “We are going to have a talk, and then you are going to change your clothing.”
“So, you were stimulated before we even rose, but you managed to kerb your desires by considering my extremely enlightening and purposeful experiment (and they did not get very far away from the table after they fell off).”
“Mmm.”
“Make it so,” the older brother commanded.
“Is Mycroft with you?” He sounded petulant now.
“Yes, John?” He appeared instantly, wiping his hands on a rough cloth.
“I will, and you know that I will. You are at great risk of doing something reckless and dangerous, and if that is the only way that I can prevent you from injuring yourself, then that is what I will do.”
“You are very clever, Doctor. Yes. I thought that I could show her the recipes whilst I read them to her, and I will write the orders as she observes, and I will spell out the words for her.”
“Not bad, little brother,” he whispered as he watched her get herself to her feet, coughing. “All right?” he asked the nurse insincerely. “Why don’t you take him down to the kitchen and see what Mrs Parker has made for him to eat.”
He grumbled deep in his throat but I took no notice, instead retrieving the items I needed from around his room.
He began to consider that. How had he gotten back into the country; how had he been travelling through Europe? He must have had something. He wondered about his appearance, as well. Surely someone so thoroughly dishevelled would have attracted some attention at some point.
Mycroft had never had any problem with lying to anyone; this was no exception.
“Oh, Doctor, for once, it was not his fault. I am afraid it was something that
They let him get as far as neon before assuring him that he had done very well and could stop.
She stood still, her arms folded across her chest, listening to the soft receding steps. Finally, sure that the woman had reached the ground floor, she took a deep breath, calming herself and composing her features before turning towards the bed. Sherlock’s eyes were open a bit and he was gazing blearily at her, his face slack and his mouth open.
And as I write this, it occurs to me that—well, if I write here as a true and accurate record of this episode in our lives, I must be true to myself. I have grown so accustomed to stretching out with him in these fine rooms, on the fine bedclothes, that I have not once considered that it would [the doctor has lined out ‘would’] should end. The only nights we have been apart were the two when he was at his lowest and most violent, and I hated every minute of the long, dark hours.
“Mmm.”
He fell silent at this; apparently all of his objections had been thwarted.
in the not-too-distant past. And milk. He knew that he had a fever but didn’t think it was terribly high. Withdrawals? Possibly. His head certainly hurt. He recalled injections. So, probable.
“Oh, Sherlock,” he muttered. “What have you done now?” He strode quickly across the meticulous lawn.
I believe that Sherlock has turned a corner and is truly recovering.
word,” he prodded.
“It is,” he agreed.
“You call this living? When was the last time you had a bath?” His nose wrinkled.
“That’s very good,” Matilda told him, nodding approvingly at the empty plate.
I braced myself. What would her demands be? Money? Public confession of my sins? Turn myself in? This was the moment I had been dreading all this time. Is this how Sherlock felt when faced with the inevitability of his death on that precipice at the Reichenbach Falls?
Maybe he could sleep a bit.
Just John.
I could not deny it. I shrugged my shoulders, unable to come up with one useful word in my defence.
you told me that I had to ensure that I was decently garbed when the maid was here.”
The young man seated in front of John moaned. “My poor sister,” he mumbled. “I’ll never make this up to her.”
When Winifred arrived shortly before midnight, she was surprised. She was let into the house by one of Mr Holmes’ assistants, who motioned her in with one finger across his lips. Beyond the foyer, the immense home was dark and quiet. He turned away from her and melted into the shadows. Shaking her head, she mounted the stairs as silently as she could.
Greg’s eyebrows shot up for an instant and Sherlock snorted. “I suppose you want me to open that one so you can find out what you got me,” he commented drily.
Perhaps predictably, Mrs. Bloom recovered herself first, and she was livid. “How dare you?” she hissed. “How
“Yeah. They got him back, but he had gotten hold of a scalpel, and… damn. This hurts. That mark on his leg. You know?”
“He did not,” my darling agreed, “and when the housekeeper summoned one anyway, he would not allow him entrance.”
He was still standing on the towel, wiping himself down in a methodical, slow fashion. He ran the sponge across and between his legs; reached around and continued his ablutions.
“Not at all. Everything was quite warm.”
“Some shrimp scampi and some peas. He did really well.”
Sherlock clearly abhorred her.
“Oh, goodness, Doctor! Here I am, going on about breezes and gloves. Whatever did you ring about?”
“It’s fresh butter, and Mrs Hudson has outdone herself with this bread—it really is a bit of heaven. Sit down and have some.” (I was already in the habit of addressing him at times as a truculent child.)
“No one was wearing gloves,” she remarked. “Some young men did not even have their hats on,” she added. I could tell that she was trying to sound censorious but was having a difficult time of it.
“Look… who are we talking about? Parents?”
He had been frustrated at first; he had tried tomato ketchup. He had tried steak sauce—and barely tolerated an idiotic story from the idiotic server about how her little daughter thought it was “Al’s” steak sauce rather than “A-1.” Finally, he had tried something called Heinz 57 that was close. Not perfect, but close. It was a simple thing to get white bread or a lovely soft bap—they called it a roll—and very nice bacon, but why in heavens’ name was it so difficult to get proper brown sauce in the U.S.?
He thought briefly of Sherlock’s ridiculous method of naming his contacts.
“Mr. Bramsen explained that it was a woman’s ring and that he had lost it in a rather compromising situation. He would not explain more until I came to meet him, and he begged that I come to him alone, as he did not think that he would be able to fully express himself in front of more than one man.”
“Yes.” She looked down at the top sheet on the clipboard. “See?” She held it up and pointed.
“Yes.”
“Now, as we were discussing, I have brought your violin from Baker Street, but it is to remain safe with your brother until you are well enough to handle it.”
“We dine out.” We preferred that to purchasing foodstuffs from the street vendors.
“What did I do next, John?” he nearly purred.
And clearly he was an absolute mess. Not even remotely in condition to see his parents, was he?
“You do not suffer from an illness such as cholera,” I agreed, “but you suffer nonetheless.”
He did not reply.
“Do you think it would be more efficacious to go through an agency?” I asked, listening to him rummaging about in the next room.
“Please,” I replied. I sat back comfortably to afford myself a good view of the players.
“My dear Watson… I can’t… so many bits…” He waved one hand toward his wardrobe and dresser.
God, how he wanted to tell her to try a training cup—or a bottle—how eager his little brother would be for nice, cool water from one. He wondered if he should… no.
The blasted bell had rung just then, and as I leapt from the bed in anticipation of our landlady knocking one of us up, I was instantly aware that my prick was positively engorged.
Unusual? More unusual than what? Than finding himself in a jaw-droppingly posh house as a private nurse to a patient apparently so important he had had to sign a confidentiality agreement?
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed. He pulled the straight-backed chair up and sat in front of him, still clasping the book. His brother’s eyes wandered in his direction slowly; he didn’t seem to be focusing on anything in particular. “I have thousands of books. How did you manage to find this one?” He looked down at it, running his fingers across the title. “Why did I even keep it?” he mused.
He huffed impatiently as I tested the water and adjusted the taps, then continued stripping, carelessly dropping his shirt onto the pile on the floor. I looked pointedly at his combinations.
perform acts of charity.” And with that statement, she placed herself utterly into Sherlock’s hands.
“It’s Felicity Thatcher from around the corner,” she explained. “Her father is quite ill.”
He raised his head and looked down at his legs. They were slightly spread, and each ankle was tied to a corner of the bed frame. It was (fortunately) a narrow bed, so his legs weren’t uncomfortably far apart, but he had absolutely no range of motion. He couldn’t even get his heels off the mattress.
“Leave the door open on your way out,” the older nurse instructed.
That was why his brother wasn’t talking
“Now that I know the extent of it…?” I prompted him.
It was no use.
“There is hardly room for both of us,” he demurred, purposely mistaking my intent. “If you wish us to sit together, should we not avail ourselves of the settee?”
“Sherlock, although expressing discomfiture upon the subject of having—or not having—children is not common, for some, it can be an awkward subject. You yourself are extremely uncomfortable discussing anything about how babies come into the world.”
“You have a great need, brother mine,” Mycroft supplied sadly. “I am afraid that our mother’s affliction has cursed you far more than we realised. I did not have any other recourse but to send her to that asylum, and if you persist in your current activity I will have no choice but to have you placed in one as well.”
“Happy Christmas, John.”
“And you know that there is rarely a time when saying hurtful and insulting things
I remained quiet. I am not sure how to describe exactly what I was feeling at that moment. Yes, of course, as always, I was proud of him for being absolutely correct. I was touched that he spoke of my infirmities with such tenderness. I recalled with gladness his ministrations when I was stricken—stoking the fire and turning my chair towards it and gently covering me with blankets and—and this is most touching—insisting at times that I stay inside and not follow him as he plunged out into the frigid air in pursuit of a case.
words—you and Mr. Sherlock Holmes are living in a heinous, filthy perversion of a moral marriage. Just the thought of this makes me feel ill. You are going to hell—and before that, you are going to prison.
He went on to describe where his line of inquiry had led him—firstly a butcher. A barber. A chemist. As he continued to list his visits, it occurred to me.
” he cried out.
“That would be most gracious of you—and we will remunerate you for your assistance, of course. Now,” I continued before she could utter an objection, “I am woefully unaware of what exact tasks are required. Mrs Hudson will have to instruct you.”
I closed my book, rose, and went over to my desk. Sure enough, there were a few letters, and I was not surprised in the slightest when the now-familiar folded sheet fell out from between them.
As I made my way through the streets, dodging prams and costermonger’s carts, I wondered if anyone amongst the throng was such a person and on such a nefarious errand as that.
What? They were headed in the wrong direction. Baker Street was the other way.
“But I was not making any motions the least bit evocative of that activity. In fact, I should think it was rather the opposite—pulling a sharp fork from a chair’s seat seems a rather off-putting action.”
Sherlock nodded and then shivered.
“Is your sister still there?”
Keyed up, neither of them had any inclination to retire, so they both changed into something comfortable and found one of the many filmed versions of
“Come on, now. Time for dinner,” she instructed as she rolled down his pyjama leg. He shook his head rather violently. “Oh, don’t be like that. We need to have our dinner so we can take our medicine.”
Still, they do hurt.
Did Sherlock care about that? He had had plenty of time to consider it, and he had come to several conclusions about himself:
“Yes, Doctor. You are free to come and go as you please—as long as it does not distress my brother overly.”
“Erm… okay.”
“Send it to me,” Mycroft ordered.
“Mr. Bramsen shaves twice a day, and he puts cream on his face and on his hands, and when his sister, with whom he resides, is away, he dresses in her clothes and puts on a wig and goes out where neither of them is known and he… She is away for a fortnight this time and he went out wearing her riding costume and her ring and while he was out he lost it and he could not think of what else to do but to request that I assist him in finding it before she returns.”
Sherlock looked thoughtfully at his hands, holding them out in front of his body.
John sighed deeply and sunk into his chair. Dinner had been quite good, if he did say so himself, and he had just poured a glass of beer for himself and wine (from Mycroft’s basket) for Sherlock. His mate slumped into his own chair and tasted the ruby red liquid.
They had all taken heart in learning that Winifred was coming on duty at midnight; if anyone could take the situation firmly in hand, it was the calm and motherly nurse.
The second was untidy about her shoes and hat and gloves and, well, everything. Despite my attachment to my darling, I am still an admirer of the fairer sex and I was decidedly unimpressed. Mrs Hudson concurred and off she went.
What the fuck was he doing? He slammed himself against the wall, away from the opening. Idiot. That’s how they got you.
“The way he looked at our waiter,” he replied calmly, overlooking these rather ridiculous jibes.
“No…” the government man replied, uncharacteristically hesitantly. “I won’t be sleeping.”
killing him sometimes takes a great deal of self-control. We have impulses, you see—we all do—we all have
Solomon, who had finally gotten his now-limp patient resettled on the sofa in the elaborately decorated, positively Victorian bedroom (the chauffer had helped get him up the stairs), jotted some notes on the clipboard. Both brothers (he had no idea who the older man was except that he was the brother of the man that he was tending—wasn’t he supposed to be dead? He vaguely remembered headlines from a few years back) were sleeping; after they returned the older brother had disappeared for a bit, then reappeared and stretched out, fully clothed, on the bed and allowed himself to drift off—but only after he had assured him that he would watch the younger man carefully and alert him if anything unusual happened.
“What about rote memory?” the doctor inquired.
“How do you think Mrs. Hudson would feel, having a stranger move in here?” I continued.
It is ten o’clock according to the bells of the unseen clock. Sherlock has been released from his imprisonment. He is injured, weak, and ill. There is a look in his eyes that I have never seen before.
“It’s frightfully windy today,” Mycroft noted, nodding at the lowering sun. “I am a bit concerned about that old tree coming down.”
“Nothing. He just flipped out. I had to sedate him.”
What had occurred to me as I struck out from the hotel into the bright, fresh day was this: everyone who saw me, decently attired and walking with calm purpose, would have assumed that I was off to attend to some mundane matter—stopping at my tailor’s, or at the bank. If I had my medical bag with me, everyone would assume that I was on my way to attend to a patient.
“What?” He had taken me entirely by surprise.
Later he would ask for the chocolate mousse and more milk up in his bedroom—for him and for the nurse. Or perhaps she would prefer a cup of tea—the stronger, the better.
Clearly this idea tickled him, and he said it so comically—with a theatrical wrinkle of his nose—that I had to laugh. “I shall enjoy blowing the whistle, but I expect a coin for my efforts,” I responded, relieved that his spirits seemed to be lifting.
“I’ve been observing the ebb and flow of the crowds going through the doors,” he explained, trying not to smile at the shorter man standing so close to him.
they all looked and sounded and smelled and felt and even tasted different
“What in heaven’s name are you doing?” I exclaimed rather energetically.
back. He had no idea how or when that had happened. Where had he been? He frowned, unable to recall…
“I am simply not meant to be an invalid,” she admitted in mock despair. “Woe is me; I am committed to a life of activity.”
“Do not lie to me, John,” he said softly. “And please leave me. I do not wish to be with you at present.”
I nodded, unable—unwilling—to respond to this jab.
Sherlock frowned as he considered this. I could feel him under my hands, restless and trembling. Then he shook his head. “No,” he said, speaking more slowly than he had been, “it does not matter what you promised Mother and Father. It is my decision and the responsibility falls on my shoulders alone.”
“Knackered.”
“My last stop was at your previous club. I spoke to the servants and members who were having lunch, and those who recalled you had nothing unpleasant to say. They seemed to understand that you had been, at that time, experiencing difficulties.”
But I am losing the scent, as it were. I started out considering how changed my life is from what it was—how our lives together have changed, and considering what we have just been through—three weeks of absolute misery and even fear—I am recalling quite clearly the first time I encountered Sherlock Holmes “in the dumps”—which is an understatement that I regret not addressing terribly effectively at the first.
I admire our dear friend so. She is so observant and respectful of the feelings of others. She truly understands and cares for us—Sherlock in particular—and never questions his queer states.
A while later, I hesitantly knocked on his door. “Holmes, I’m going to dress now. Are you all right?”
Sherlock, of course, noted the sudden change to my demeanour and looked over at me sharply. “Something has occurred to you. What?” he demanded.
Except that sometimes being special was scary—when he was sleeping, sometimes he saw himself in a long, dark coat and uncomfortable-looking suit and shoes, acting very grown-up and using big, hard words. Sometimes Daddy was there with him, reminding him to be polite, and sometimes he wasn’t, and then ‘Lock would say something rude and the grown-ups he was talking to would be angry at him. That frightened him a bit.
“This. You bought this in person. You went into a shop. You swore you’d never go into one again during the holidays.”
“Well, sir, we did what most sensible folk were doing. I packed a picnic basket and some rugs and we got on the train and we went to the seaside.”
“You did really well with drawing and writing today. Do you think you could you do more? We really need to know where you’ve been and what’s happened to you. I understand that you’re having trouble speaking, but you can write formulas, and numbers. What about words?” He paused and swallowed. “God, Sherlock. We need more information. Can’t you draw it, or…
“I see,” I mused. “I will make it clear that I am just popping out to retrieve some things that we need in the short term. I do not wish for him to believe anything except that these circumstances are temporary—that we only wish for him to get well—and then we can return to our lives.” And then that thought had caused me a flood of apprehension. “We
?” he asked in bafflement.
His brother allowed himself to be slowly guided out of the bathroom. His chin was to his chest and his steps were unsteady. The new nurse (Mycroft had stopped even wondering about their names) was calm; steady. Almost clinical. That was fine. He got his brother seated on the bed and bent to retrieve the shirt he had dropped. It was not a proper pyjama shirt, he noted, but one of his oldest buttoned shirts. He frowned at its appearance. Apparently, Mrs Parker had held onto it to be made useful in circumstances exactly like this.
He sat up, glanced around for his clothing, and three minutes later was out the door.
Mycroft thought he heard him attempting to reply, his chapped lips barely moving, but he did not know how to respond, and was thankful when Sherlock fell asleep. He ran his fingers through the dark curls.
The older nurse sighed and motioned for him to follow her. They entered the bedroom that their patient was supposed to be using. There were several pieces of A4 paper on the table. He approached them a bit hesitantly. From Winifred’s demeanour, he suspected that he wasn’t going to be seeing pictures of faeries and bunnies.
He squatted down. “May I look?” He indicated the papers with a wave of his hand and was gratified when Sherlock, without looking up, nodded. “Thank you,” he told him. He gathered a few sheets, stood up, and began examining them.
Mycroft Holmes, staring at the incongruity of scenes of torture and violence executed in sixty-four waxy colours, wondered if Mummy had saved the “scribbles” his brother had done so many years earlier. He desperately wanted to see them—he
“I have told you that my father had, for as long as I can remember, expressed dismay at my… my birth.” I knew he was blushing—even after all those years, Sherlock found discussions regarding such matters upsetting. “And that he was probably not, in actuality, my father—in that sense.” That sentence came out all in a rush, as if he wished to get past it as quickly as possible.
Mycroft rose and stood deliberately in his brother’s path.
Mycroft watched as his brother’s eyes opened wide. What had he remembered?
“John,” he finally started, “does it bother you...”
Mycroft and Winifred, having reached an uneasy truce over the cigarettes, stood and watched Sherlock as he dreamily went through the motions of playing an imaginary violin.
My instincts, at least at the moment, were correct, and once I had laid everything out, he seemed to rally a bit, standing and waving me out of the room as he stared at the elegant trousers and shirt and—well, all the bits—that I had placed on his bed, being especially attentive to arranging all the items so that they could be easily donned in order. Eventually he emerged from his bedroom (I had retired to my own bedroom and donned my evening apparel, then waited for him in our sitting room) dressed as elegantly as he ever did. Truly, he could have appeared in a tailor’s advertisement, so beautiful was he.
He liked the crayons. They were just like the ones that Daddy got him, except they were all out of order. He fixed that as he considered what to draw.
He blinked in mock surprise. “How could I not,” he wondered, “when it is so apparent?”
“I suspect that their love was more… vibrant. Alive. Vivid and bright and a bit dangerous.”
There are days when I simply cannot look at him enough. I never grow tired of observing him—razor-sharp cheekbones, piercing grey eyes, ivory skin, and the glorious dark hair; the deceptively sinewy strength of his limbs; his long, slender body.
“No, I will not be making any arrangements beyond ensuring that you remain here in my home until you are recovered enough to go home. We will discuss it further upon my return.” He took a deep breath. “Sherlock, I only wish for you to be safe, and if it is possible, to be well.”
“John… Watson,” he repeated.
“Damn,” she sighed now. “Although I’m surprised that’s the first time we’ve had to do that.”
Those closest to the detective were not supposed to become targets.
“There is a distinct seven-minute interval between periods of intense activity,” he reported succinctly.
“No,” he replied after a moment of thought. “He can wear mine for now. He’ll need shoes, though—he’ll never fit into mine.”
She glanced at her watch. “Actually, it’s a good thing you’re awake. Time for some more tablets.”
Sherlock’s mobile rang. When it was clear that he was going to ignore it, John sighed and bent to retrieve it from the branches of their tree. “It’s your mum,” he said, “and you are going to speak to her and your father.” He thrust the object under his mate’s nose.
That was it. She gave up. He had her dead to rights, and with corroboration to boot. She was screwed. Without another word she glanced at her watch, signed off, noting the time, handed him the clipboard, spun on her heel, and left.
“Can’t you stay with them?”
“That must have been frightening, especially for a small child.”
“Nuh… noh no no no no,” he moaned.
“Oh, my love! Of course we can.” I would not have wanted to move right at that moment even if he had risen from my lap. I needed time to collect myself; his sorrow was so heartfelt that he had nearly brought me to tears.
“Of course. My apologies.”
[This short section was also apparently written later; it is in pen.]
“Because your observations of my actions reminded you of our intimate acts?”
Persuading him to take in any sort of nourishment has been equally ineffective. At this point I do not care in the slightest what he eats—if he would only eat something. Sometimes he can be convinced to take some cake or a jelly—he does love his sweets. But anything proper and strengthening—a lovely roast pheasant such as what was brought up last night—he eschews.
keeping quiet
“I mean that there is a suite of rooms in my home that can be prepared as we deem necessary—and I can hire attendants to keep him safe day and night.”
He twitched his face away from mine. I should have realised at that instant that there was something truly wrong. Instead, I presumed it was merely his discomfort and continued my ablutions, repeatedly rinsing and wringing out the sponge. When I reached his waist, I emptied the bowl into the slops jar and refilled it with clean water.
“You are withholding something from me,” I accused, and he bowed his head in acquiescence. “Why? What is it?”
We sat for a long time after that; my legs cramped a bit and I finally shifted from my position crouched in front of him. I rose stiffly and sat next to him on the bed. All three of us remained in silence for a few moments.
Yes, the constable was now pointing her hand firmly down the street. “I said, move along,” she said firmly.
“Yes… he is not well. I do not think that—”
She blinked. “Everyone?”
“Not without
“You’ve even got a badge,” the uncle chimed in, leaning forward to see.
I left him standing alone on the damp towel, staring dully down at it.
I must be overly tired from the strain. I am fanciful and foolish. I must desist.
“Sherlock,” I began, my own voice hoarse with emotion, “your brother is correct. You are not at all well. You are confused and ill.”
“Wasn’t sure I’d go through with it,” John admitted.
, really.”
Sherlock peered suspiciously at the people who stood before him. His head ached and he felt horrid and for some reason he kept thinking about Kathmandu, which was odd because he knew nothing at all about the far-off city except how it sounded and looked and smelled and felt and he was a bit dizzy because everyone seemed so much shorter than him and he hadn’t seen the tops of so many heads and they were all dark-haired and not English and not England and the food was unfamiliar and odd and it made him feel ill all the time but he just had to put up with it didn’t he because he was there to do a job not have a holiday and he would never go there for a holiday especially not without John but John would like New Orleans and San Francisco but not Las Vegas—
I wrapped my arms around him, and I cannot say with certainty how long we remained there. He was garbed only in a shirt and drawers, and every bit of him was cold to the touch.
The government man’s eyes widened slightly. “So suddenly?” he asked,
The other half often ended in spending the early morning hours in A & E or in some rancid room in some dilapidated, disgusting building that should have been (might have already been) condemned, holding the head that housed one of the most brilliant brains he had ever encountered as owner of said brain puked his guts out, or raved about oysters and playing cards, or sometimes just went cold and silent and terrifyingly still and Greg was now an expert at taking pulses; at counting respirations.
“Are you admitting,” he responded in a low tone, “that my activities at a crime scene encourage—” His brows drew down.
“Tomorrow.”
“Yes.”
“Mrs Simpson used to read me your stories, Doctor Watson—about Mr Holmes and his detective work. So very exciting!”
“Mmm?” I replied, nibbling a bit.
“My sweetheart,” I whispered against his ear, “I wish for you to sleep for a while. Can you manage that?”
“Not entirely.”
I nodded. I felt (still feel) the same way about my war wounds. For long periods of time they do not cause me pain, and I am lulled into a false sense that they have finally, completely healed and will never interfere with me again, and then I experience an unusually cold, wet day or a particularly hard run or other form of violent exercise and the next day I am in agony and frustrated and angry about it.
“Change… subject,” he mumbled.
He would have given his left hand to receive one more—just one more.
No, he told himself as he so, so carefully cleaned and bandaged the horrific wound on his leg, Sherlock moaning and whimpering. He hadn’t been involved in searching his clothing after his retrieval. In fact, no one had even mentioned what he had hidden in his coat, so how was he to know that letting him go to the loo by himself was a bad idea?
“I… oh.”
He ran his hand across each spread, rather oddly from right to left. Sometimes he would pause, and one long finger would tap a particular spot, and then he would move on. Sometimes he would linger at one location, thoughtfully rubbing it.
Finally, to his great surprise, he noted that his brother had been on a grocery shopping site. He shook his head, emptied the virtual basket, and erased the browser’s history. Because who really needed 25 different jars of marmalade and ten tins of halved pears in syrup?
I did not enjoy my solitary breakfast one bit. As I had done the previous morning, I held a book in front of my eyes, but I did not absorb a single word. I had no appetite. I finally gave up and returned to my room, where I rather viciously threw my things in my bag and checked out. I was going home.
“Did I what, sir?”
“I myself admit to being a prisoner to my own particular urge—as the good doctor here has written about more than once. My personal shackle is cocaine, and although I do at times attempt to resist the urge to take it, the urge is much stronger than my desire to avoid it.
John surveyed the sitting room. There were plates from breakfast still on the desk and empty mugs of coffee and hot chocolate perched around the room, with bits of wrapping paper strewn everywhere, adding a festive air.
It had been a long two days. Sherlock’s patience with Christmas Eve and Christmas Day festivities had never been long, and this, the first time they had celebrated the holiday since his return, had been especially trying. Understandably, there were many people who wanted to spend some time with him, or at least phone. He had thrown his mobile across the sitting room in frustration before noon on Christmas Eve. It had landed (and John was positive that this was deliberate) in the branches of the tree he had erected.
no bed no sheets no duvet
His decisive way of securing the viper (and in my original manuscript of this story, I correctly quoted the detective as naming the serpent a
I paused at this, the image of him sprawled across either of our beds on his stomach, his nightshirt pulled up above his hips and his bare (and delicious) bottom on display for me.
“Please.”
And there he was, hanging out of the window—quite literally. He was balanced on the sill—sitting on it—the entire upper part of his body suspended over the ground outside it. He was gripping the frame tightly with one hand, the bony knuckles white, as with the other he held his glass and minutely examined—something.
“Come in and help yourself to some of Mrs. Hudson’s lovely bread-and-butter. There was cake but I ate it all. —Sherlock”
“And I sat on the sill and leaned nearly backwards with my glass,” he recalled, mimicking the position by turning and leaning with his back against the window. His head was tipped back and I found myself wishing to place my lips on his white throat.
“Don’t force him,” Mycroft commanded angrily. “What do you think you’re doing?”
“Would you like me to read to you?” the older man asked.
“Oh?”
“Make it stop, John,” he whimpered. It seemed as if he was thousands of miles away from me.
“Thank you, Uncle Greg!”
to touch him.
“I am certain he does not mean any of it,” she pointed out. “He has nothing but respect and affection for you. He is out of his head, as you have said. He would never say anything so hurtful otherwise.”
“I… I would have consulted the schedule,” he stammered.
“How is he?” It was about six in the morning. Mycroft entered his room briskly. He began to retrieve clothing for himself.
“Hello, John,” my darling greeted me, entering our rooms. “How are you feeling?”
There was a pause, as if he was seriously considering his options. “Yes, I promise,” he finally called out.
“You were a bit hard on him,” Dad pointed out, gently, pouring his wife a glass of wine.
philic.
I immediately went for my medical bag and then my overcoat. “I will go at once,” I declared, settling my collar and taking up my hat. “Sherlock, do behave yourself whilst I’m out.”
So just then, having added three different sizes of spoons to my growing list (I had a book of etiquette back in our rooms and would have to use it to discern exactly what the differences were between them—at present I could do nothing beyond noting the relative size and any outstanding features of each piece), I glanced over to see how his investigation was proceeding.
“Can you come sit down for a moment?” I finally enquired, as easily as I could.
one—something that only you and I need to know about. Like our other activities.”
“Red roses?”
Devoured it, really. He is of course a very fast reader (not that I am slow) and made a remarkably quick but thorough study of the dreadful piece of correspondence. When he was done, he sank to his knees again and gently caressed my face. “Oh, John. You have had a terrible shock. What shall I get you? Do you want tea? Brandy?”
“No!” he shouted. “Have to find John!”
Of course, Mrs. Bloom
When it is dark, we ascribe nefarious intentions to the most innocuous of men simply because he is out of doors without the benefit of the light of the sun.
, and it is
Surprisingly, Sherlock had partaken of the dishes he ordered, which consisted of a dish of smoked salmon with a lively sauce and a toasted brioche with camembert. Instead of beer, he had a glass of wine that, he reported solemnly, was “acceptable.”
. We kept separate bedrooms. I even, at times, lived elsewhere—ostensibly due to the detective’s maddening habits involving his chemical experiments—which proved nothing regarding our relationship or our natures beyond Holmes’ brilliant if rather eccentric one. That I often tended to him in an intimate manner—well, the man was notorious for getting himself shot at, stabbed, or nearly drowned in the course of his investigations, and his recurring illnesses necessitated my medical attentions as well. Every eccentricity of my love could, in fact, explain any possible scenarios of supposed inversion.
I considered rising, dressing in some fashion (if there ever was a day that made our bohemian manner of dressing appropriate, it was this one), and descending to speak with her. I considered rising, throwing my lightest dressing gown over my shoulders, and ringing for her. I considered rising and, dressed still in just my vest and drawers, collapsing onto Sherlock’s bed to await his return.
Day 8—Tuesday, 11:06 a.m.
I wrote him my first letter of apology that very night, after securing a room for myself. The hotel desk attendant seemed completely uninterested in hearing a reason for my late arrival or lack of a reservation. It is London, after all, and life in all its activity does not stop when the sun sets.
He moved like an old man, wobbling a bit, and at one point she reached out a hand to support him as he leaned rather alarmingly to the left. He had flinched, though, so she had pulled her hand back as quickly as she could. She realised then that there was something very, very wrong with him.
I did not even blame her for her honest address to our previous neighbour. Mary did not have any female relatives, and although she had attended a reputable boarding school in Edinburgh and at the time of our meeting was working as governess for a quite nice family, she did not have any friends in whom she could confide. She had come into our marriage with a young lady’s fanciful dreams, formed whilst she was still at school. So when she began to encounter my behaviour, which was without a doubt nearing madness at times, she had absolutely no resource upon which to call beyond the ladies’ magazines—and I am fairly certain that none of them carried articles about what to do when your husband ran off with his former flatmate to investigate mysteries, not to mention my other less-than-ideal behaviours. I reflect on this with a shudder—she might have had a perfectly lovely marriage, home, and family if I had been a proper husband. Instead, faced with such queer circumstances, she, quite rightly, turned to her new acquaintances for advice. I do not know if other young wives are as blunt and honest as Mary was, but I suspect that ladies are quite a bit more forthright with one another than as they are portrayed in books and plays—or as they behave when in the company of men.
“Do you need the toilet?” the nurse asked. Her voice was even and calm.
“I am so grateful that we had such a lovely time that day,” she continued quietly.
He was startled by Sherlock’s hand on his wrist. “Yes, brother mine?” he asked gently.
“Ta, mate. Sherlock, what do you say? I could use a break.”
“Can you come sit down?” his brother suggested in a somewhat kinder tone. “Can you sit and talk to us for a while?”
“That man—that horrid, disgusting,
In fact, although initially I had been filled with unease upon her selection of an hotel, at the moment of our arrival, I realised that she would hardly be inclined to create a scene in such a public and dignified locale. For the first time since I had read her letter, I felt the smallest bit of optimism about the outcome of a tête-à-tête.
“Certain? And how do you know that?” I teased. It was perfectly obvious that she had already been up and about for the past few days, when I was not at home. It does not take a consulting detective to notice that her boots were pushed under the settee in her sitting room with fresh mud on them.
“Be positive about what?” Greg surprised himself by reaching out and grasping the yellow tape.
“You found them? I know that I am not always terribly organised with my books in particular Mrs Hudson despairs of me but I was fairly sure that I left them somewhat tidy at least did she have that pipe repaired is she being cautious about opening the door has the greengrocer gotten a new boy the last one was awful he barely knew a turnip from an onion what is the weather I do not even know what day it is there will be trout for dinner but I refuse to touch sprouts you don’t intend to force me you never do did you bring a newspaper the youngest footman has a sweetheart Mycroft’s flue needs attending to in his bedroom I mean can you convince him that I could have a pen and ink I promise I won’t stab anyone I didn’t meantolasttime itwasanaccident Ilikeapencilforsomethingsbut don’tyoulikeapen youarethewriterdidthatlastpiececomeoutyetIratherlikedthatone—”
going to dress. Good. Mycroft’s pyjamas were comfortable, but they were—well—they were Mycroft’s. He finished his breakfast.
“Yes, of course there is cake,” I replied instead, fighting to keep my own voice light.
“On your desk,” he nodded.
The doctor took this in the manner in which it was intended—a compliment—and headed towards an attractive display.
[A note from Sherlock is written along the margin: It is understandable. Do not trouble yourself.]
“There was—Lestrade. And… damn…” He swayed, and Matilda took a few steps closer. “Supposed to protect him…. protect them.” His voice was growing rough. “And there was… and our bed and my bee and… and I want to see him. I want to go home.” He nearly fell, and Matilda ably grabbed him by the shoulders. He looked around at her, desperate and afraid. “Home. I have to… go… go home. He… oh, God… thinks I’m dead. Have to see him. Have to… have to fix it… have to…  John!”
“I honestly cannot fully explain it,” I admitted. “I have never felt that way at any of the more gruesome scenes. But sometimes, like that morning, you are undeniably
I followed him and closed and locked the door. He glanced at me with an odd expression before removing and dropping his waistcoat to the floor. His tie and collar followed, and I could see that his shirt was, indeed, rather soaked through.
Or is it because that is the way he would have wished me to be—stoic when presenting myself to the public? Brave and steady and calm in the face of danger?
“I think that would be lovely, sir,” the nurse nodded. “Sherlock, would you like to have dinner with your brother?”
So I will wait for Sherlock to return, and I will keep my tongue still as he describes—as he is bound to—his victorious, glorious adventure on the heath or in the pub or having a sword fight in the Hall or wherever he ends up.
“Apparently Mr. Bloom spends a great deal of time going ‘round to the shops, apologising.”
It was Mrs. Bloom who recovered soonest. “Well,” she managed in a querulous tone, “are you done?”
She laughed—a warm, affectionate chuckle. “Oh, please do not feel so uncomfortable!” she cried. “I am not one of those women who believe that being over or under a certain number of years has any great significance. I was eighteen years old when I married and nineteen when I had our son. He passed away not long before his tenth birthday.”
. He did—he
“Nothing. Which is brilliant,” he responded enigmatically.
“What do you mean, he didn’t get there?” Mummy huffed.
“Yeah, I do,” the short young man agreed. “Not that it’s all that remarkable an achievement.”
He, of course, had warned me at our very first meeting of these periods of melancholia, but as he did not experience such a low time immediately, I somewhat put his words about sometimes getting “in the dumps” behind myself. Besides, I wondered, what would a few days of sulking mean to me, anyway? I certainly found myself in a foul mood for a few days at a time more than once—is that all he meant? If so, I would simply do as he requested and leave him alone until it passed.
ability, my love. You know that I, and nearly everyone else, succumbs regularly to the need for food, and sleep, and… release.”
Nothing else in the way of normal pursuits, the way she told it, in fact. You were clearly not engaged as a general practitioner of medicine to any great extent. In fact, I heard that your waiting room was often empty for days at a stretch. I most certainly never referred anyone to your services, nor did anyone with whom I was acquainted.
“By that I suppose you mean my new pyjamas.”
It was equally impossible for him to keep to one topic; his ruminations took an increasingly convoluted path, and between that and the quickness of his speech—he had long ago abandoned full stops and now was losing the spaces between words—he was creating a labyrinth of images and topics that flowed into one another and turned around on themselves and went off on inexplicable tangents in a truly dizzying fashion.
“I’m going to New York,” he replied impatiently. “Do you not
Finally, to their great astonishment, Mycroft Holmes himself had announced that he would stay with his brother, and they had all taken that moment to quietly exit the room.
“What will happen to… Belinda?” Sherlock’s query, delivered with no warning, brought me to an abrupt halt. I had been neglecting him of late, I had realised, and that evening I was attempting to rectify the situation. He was, when he asked his surprising question, quite bare, and I was rather enjoying the feel of his smooth skin under my fingers as I rubbed lavender oil into it.
At that point I had looked back at Mycroft Holmes, who had once again fixed his gaze on his frenzied brother, temporarily and only somewhat calmed, and although he would deny it to his dying day, I do believe I noted the slightest glistening in his keen eyes.
“Fine,” she snarled through clenched teeth. She turned on her heel and stormed out of the room.
“John, if you would…”
She continued relating our maid’s history as I re-wrapped her foot. “First she was in the scullery of a country house…”
And now his brother—his newly inarticulate brother—was back with him. He knew if he whined in confusion or frustration. He knew if he moaned in pain or cried in fear. He knew if he didn’t let someone know that he needed to use the toilet.
“Mmmy,” he stated firmly.
“How is he today?” he inquired, pointedly ignoring both the offered hand and the name.
“We can take turns,” he exclaimed after examining them. “Doing the same… puzzle, and count… time us.”
“Well, thanks, but what good does your opinion…  I mean….”
He considered this for a moment before shaking his head.
Damn, damn, damn. He had nearly made it. It had been quite easy.
“Good God, Sherlock. Enough. I am heartily sorry to have pressed you to recall such horrible events.”
“Now,” I said firmly, “if you would pour a sherry for each of us, I believe we have something more important to discuss than the restaurant’s china pattern.”
“Conundrum?” Mr. Bloom repeated. I waited for the detective to make a cutting remark—he despises this habit. I was surprised that instead, he leaned forward with that piercing look in his eyes that has, more than once, brought the most hardened criminal to his knees, babbling confessions and begging for mercy.
“Come sit down,” she rather commanded, taking a seat herself and looking quite pointedly at me. I sat and waited; I know that tone in her voice. “I am sorry to hear that Mr. Holmes is still so ill. But tell me now—how are
“But now that you know the extent of it…” he paused and seemed unable to continue.
“What do we have here?” she asked Christopher, who was making some final notes regarding his shift on the clipboard.
I nodded. “They did not have any children when I was acquainted with them. I presume from your statement they still do not.”
“And do you understand that it is perfectly natural, and that I did not intend to slight you and your investigation in any way?”
“Oh, just shut him up,” Derek snarled.
of us of practicing perversions that will most certainly bring us to trial and probably put us in prison.”
He knew that
Which he could not do now.
Tiring of his picture, he put the crayon he was using back into the box and looked up at her curiously. He pushed the book and papers aside and, untangling his long legs, he slid off the bed and approached her. His walk was hesitant and unsteady; his expression open and innocent and unsuspecting. She glanced up at him and stared, astonished at what she was seeing. She glanced down at the notes again and a word jumped out at her.
“Because you will find that you are one short.”
Stop that. It was just transport. Overcome it.
Not a good place to be standing.
And he had caused every single mark; every single scar.
For the first hour he threw whatever he could get his hands on in a wordless fury, bellowing meaningless noises of frustration.
“Uh…” Christopher shrugged helplessly. It did sound rather implausible read out in a list like that. “Maybe?”
The elder brother now pulled back and looked at him carefully. The data—the injuries, emaciation, inarticulateness, disassociation—bombarded him. His brother needed a doctor—that had been obvious based on the injury they witnessed him sustaining—and until he was seen to, he could not say with assurance what the next step might be.
The once-great consulting detective, formerly one of the most observant men in England, would attempt to deduce himself.
She had started slowly, offering to read the book to him. He had nodded, eagerly, and scrambled up onto the bed with it, patting the mattress to invite her to sit with him. She had done so, and for a bit it had been fine. She read to him (it was a book about snakes) and let him examine the photographs for a while.
It is a testament to the depth of my sorrow that I did not feel the slightest objection to her accusation, but I did attempt to clarify my position. “I am not retreating, my dear lady,” I informed her. “He does not currently desire my presence.”
“Mrs. Hudson knows.”
The next part was a bit trickier—Mycroft’s entire household staff was well trained—but he was careful and observant. He made his way to the ground floor. No one appeared to be about. He ducked into the kitchen and had to dash for the safety of the pantry as the concealed door that revealed the stairs which led down to Mycroft’s office/bunker soundlessly swung open. One of his brother’s minions—neatly clipped hair, black suit and tie, white shirt, and black sunglasses—appeared and, without a glance around himself, headed out towards the garage. He waited, then crept towards the door, listening intently.
And then he broke. “God, Greg—I’ve missed him so much. He’s been so wound up and so adamant about not wanting it. I know it’s got something to do with his time away and after… when he came back, but it’s been torture watching him. He’s been needing it so much. He’s literally got the weight of the world on his shoulders and I can’t get him to eat or sleep or even stop and look at me for one minute. He’s killing himself over it all, and I just want to take care of him.”
