Dean bolts to a sitting position, shoving Cas away in the process. His chest is heaving like he’s run a marathon. “Henry,” he says, and his throat is sore.
Upstairs, he can hear Dean walking around his own kitchen, most likely putting away the groceries Cas left him stranded with. Even his footsteps sound confident and sure.
He ignores the fact that he’s sunk back down into those feelings of hopelessness he thought he’d shaken off for good. Or that some of the customers have commented on the missing vase, saying how much they always appreciated seeing the little bright spot there on the counter. Dean doesn’t know what to say to that.
Cas was by no means an expert, but he used every trick he knew, listening as Dean’s breath hitched, learning what made his hips buck up. When Dean began to chant
Cas has done a lot of ill-advised things in his life, but maybe the most egregious is not letting Dean Winchester finish that sentence.
It’s not how Dean likes to do things, but he needs this. Needs the distraction, needs to blow off some steam. He hesitates for a moment, but maybe changing things up will get him out of his head a little faster, so he agrees to take her back to his apartment. Had he known, he might’ve straightened up the place a little bit, but she doesn’t seem to care and before long they’re on the couch, picking up where they’ve left off. She shakes her hair loose and Dean threads his fingers in it, tipping her head back as he kisses her.
He’s been here before. He knows what to do, yanking and pulling at twisted metal until his sliced hands run red with blood. The bus looks empty but he knows Henry is in there and he doesn’t stop until he’s physically pulled away and forcibly thrown to the ground, two police officers pinning him down as he continues to scream.
had been a breakthrough session with his therapist. The realization that there was literally no way to please her had left him with an unexpected sense of freedom.
Everyone Cas told about the breakup seemed shocked and surprised, and, well, Cas wished he could say the same. He and Daphne had been together long enough for them both to realize that it wasn’t right, but at the same time, things were good enough to outweigh the stress of breaking up. It wasn’t ideal, Cas knew, but he also didn’t know how long he would’ve let things go on if she hadn’t told him they were through.
It’s mesmerizing to watch the play of emotions cross Dean’s face...the blush that stains his cheeks even as he tries to keep his chin jutted forward in some attempt at insolence. He can see the war between Dean’s desire to pull away and how his throat clicks as he swallows, his eyes flicking down to Cas’s mouth.
“Well, that sounds like the perfect camp for you.” He happens to know Cas is bringing home two more books from the library today all about amphibians.
Dean’s been doing his best not to think as he drives, just letting the miles between Bobby’s house and his destination build as the day progresses. As he heads south from home, the scenery gradually changes, softening from the ruggedness of South Dakota to the rolling hills and never-ending farmland of Iowa. Two hundred and fifty miles is an easy drive, no reason to get an early start, so Dean slept late, then took his time getting the car packed. As a result, the early October sun is already setting by the time he turns east to make the final push into central Iowa. Bobby accused him of dragging his feet and, while Dean would never admit it, he wasn’t wrong. He knows this “trip” is supposedly an opportunity, but he can’t shake the underlying feeling that it’s a banishment. He’s been on thin ice, he knows that. He knows Bobby has given him more chances than he deserves, keeping an eye out for him even when Dean would rather he didn’t. Even though he tries to keep his light hidden under a, well, not a bushel so much as a greasy old trucker hat, Bobby has been more father to him than John ever was. So when Bobby told him in no uncertain terms that he’d be taking this job, Dean swallowed down any objection and began to pack his things.
Dean breathes, too boneless to get his pants back up or all the way down. With his t-shirt rucked up and the air conditioner blowing cool air on his sweaty skin, he listens to Cas’s footsteps in the hall followed by the sound of running water. He’s back a minute later with a cold, wet cloth that he uses to clean Dean up as best he can.
Dean stops himself from rolling his eyes, but just barely. “Was there a press release or something?”
“She got picked up,” John said, fiddling with the controls until the dryer whirred to life. Dean ushered Sam past their father who followed them out into the kitchen. Unsure of what to do, Cas stopped in the laundry room doorway, trying to stay out of the way. “Look, when your mom gets back, I’m going to need you boys to be extra good helpers. It’s a lot of work raising two fine young men.” He reached out to ruffle Dean’s hair.
He waits for the three little dots to show Dean is typing to appear. At this point, he’ll take anything. Even a thumbs up emoji. He waits and then he waits some more, rationalizing what might be delaying Dean’s response. Maybe he’s driving, maybe he’s having it out with his dad.
It had been Billie’s suggestion to ask if he could try without sedation first. Seeing how that had worked out, he decides maybe her other idea is worth a shot, too. He wishes there wasn’t a stranger sitting and waiting in earshot, but he doesn’t let that stop him.
Before the teams could even vacate the field, John was gone again, tires squealing as he drove away.
“Well, once you know, we can get her on the schedule. Or she can call in.” He pulls a business card from a little holder by the cash register. He starts to hold it out, then stops, wetting his lips. Without overthinking, he flips it over and grabs a pen. “If she has questions and it’s after hours she can always call my personal number.” Looking down as he writes, he adds, “Or you can. Whatever.”
text from the parking lot and finds him waiting just inside the doorway, a duffel slung over his shoulder. Dean hurries to take it from him and puts it in the trunk.
Dean doesn’t believe him. Not when they’re scarcely having sex anymore, like Cas doesn’t want to touch him. Maybe Cas is afraid of hurting him further, maybe he can’t get past the sickening way Dean’s been tainted, either way, Dean feels it for the rejection it is. And why shouldn’t Cas change his mind? This new knowledge means he’s been duped. Dean is fundamentally different from the Dean Winchester Cas thought he was meeting all those years ago. He’s not the same person Cas dated and asked to marry. Dean feels like the life they’ve made together was built on supports made of sand, that everything they thought was true is shifting and lurching, eroding beneath them.
“Maybe he’s having second thoughts,” he suggests to Lady Marmalade over breakfast the next morning, but when she gives him a skeptical look, he reconsiders. “Yeah, you’re right. That’s just wishful thinking on my part. It’s probably wedding stuff.” It seems a given that Sam will want Dean to be his best man. Who else is there? But because it’s so obvious Dean decides that maybe that’s the problem. Maybe Sam has somebody else he wants to ask. Maybe someone from his firm would make for a more politically strategic choice. “No, you’re right,” he says to Lady Marmalade. “Sam’s not the cynical one. He wouldn’t bring that bullshit into his wedding.” But maybe there’s someone else, a college friend or a law school colleague. Maybe Eileen has a long lost brother she wants to give the honor too. Someone who would be more comfortable in a tuxedo. Hell, maybe someone who already owns one. Balthazar probably has an entire selection of them in his closet. He imagines Balthazar looking horrified as he flips through them like pages in a book. “Wool in July? Have you lost your mind?”
Cas’s hands are shaking by the time he gets back up to his apartment and he sets the coffee cup down on the counter without drinking any of it. It had taken all of his nerve to walk into the coffee shop today. He told himself he’d been distracted with Lady Marmalades’s care--and he had, no doubt about it. There’ve been medications to administer, signs of infection to keep track of, a special prescription food as her digestive system recovers. Her belly was shaved, which he expected, but a patch on her front leg (he knows it’s her front leg, but he can’t stop thinking of it as her
It’s blatantly insane, the way Dean can make Cas’ mind go blank whenever he’s got his mouth on his cock, the heat around him almost rendered unbearable. The way he makes Cas’ body arch into every swipe of fingers, every touch of tongue and lips on skin. With every swipe of tongue down the length of his cock, Cas’ skin burns, his nerves sparks, his fingers on Dean’s shoulder harden and leave a trail as they drag down the expense of his back.
“No, go get yourself a beer,” Cas laughs and allows himself to brush a thumb on Dean’s cheek, fingers ghosting over the line of his jaw before letting go, and the other man has the audacity to
It’s a dance more than it is an act. Clothes get shed as Dean murmurs praise against Cas’ lips, soft apologies for words gone wrong; hands run over skin, re-discovering each way to make the other moan and gasp and whine. Cas is fascinated by the way Dean’s strong body, built for war and battlefield, becomes pliant under the weight of his hands and the softness of his fingertips.
“You ever going to tell me what’s up between you and Rob O’Neill over there?” Balt asks, watching as Dean crosses the room with a beer in hand and joins Sam and Charlie outside.
And it’s fucking scary too, how much he’s already unable to let go. How it hurt earlier watching him ready to go out the door with no clue when or if Cas would ever see him again.
So Cas tells him about Dean’s words. He tells him about the despair he could feel in every line, how Dean seemed to always hold on. How Dean kept saying he missed him. On occasion, how he wrote “I love you still”.
Right there, amongst the ruins of what they once used to be, stands the man he fell in love with all those years ago.
Dean’s whole body shudders as the words tumble out of Castiel’s mouth. From the way his voice breaks to the pleading tone inside his voice and wraps around his heart already aching.
Dean groans, his hands squeezing a bit tighter at Cas’ hips as he pushes his mouth on Cas’ cock himself, burying his nose into the soft curls at the base. Dean always had a hard time accepting praise before, but he reacts to it beautifully during sex, and Cas has yet to get tired of it. He groans, his head falling back against the shower tile as his thumb caresses Dean’s cheekbone lightly, enjoying the feeling of his own cock going in and out of Dean’s mouth as he lets him take control, taking Cas all the way into his throat like he’s been made for this.
“You mean I can message you in the middle of the night when my stupid leg wakes me up?” Dean says, and Cas can almost hear the smile in his voice.
He reaches out for Cas’ hands and tightly intertwines their fingers together, squeezing lightly to offer comfort. It’s something he’s been doing more recently, knowing that Cas needs the reassurance.
good wearing an obscure band shirt with a pair of ripped jeans. Especially not your ex, and definitely not after you almost spilled your fresh coffee right into his face.
It scares the shit out of him, but he pushes the scary part down his throat and concentrates on the rest.
The simple mention of Jimmy’s name is enough for his face to fall, and he knows for a fact that his British idiot of a friend figured out
He looks like a kid again and suddenly Jimmy’s transported back to 8 years ago, an image of Cas lying in a hospital bed superposed to the one of him right now lying inside his own bed.
“I want to —,” Cas whines as Dean’s hand twists in an almost painful stroke around him, his thumb smearing the droplets of precome on his length. “
“Listen Winchester, you still have a couple of days to decide,” his team leader says, his Cajun accent as thick as ever (sometimes Dean thinks the man does it on purpose), “but you gotta know that whatever you decide, we’re still gonna be here for you. Bravo Team isn’t going anywhere, no matter what you do,” he continues.
I know that I need to move on. I know that I need to live a life that’s more than just the echo of the person I used to be before we parted. But for now, simply moving is enough. There’s something easier that sits within me as I fight and learn, as I memorize the military alphabet and go through the next lesson- easier than thinking about everything I lost. Easier than thinking about your chest cracking under the paramedics' hands, than the starking white color of your skin underneath the blinking blue light of the ambulance. Easier than remembering the weight of your lips on mine the last time we kissed.
“I’m that transparent, huh?” Dean says, a faint smile on his face as he ducks his face to look at Cas.
Cas nods against him, silent. It takes a few more minutes for Dean to slightly draw back to look at Cas. He brings one of his hands to Cas’ face and cups his cheek tenderly, swiping a thumb underneath Cas’ eye softly. Cas closes his eyes and pushes slightly into the touch, a sigh escaping his lips.
He can’t help but wonder if Cas trying so hard to hold onto the last shred of sanity he has left means he’s probably never going to be okay again; but he figures that’s not a question he wants to answer right now, sitting alone in the Impala while he listens to his friend from miles away laughing at the irony of the situation he’s got himself into.
“Have you- do you know where he is?” Cas asks carefully, knowing that the John subject is a bundle of very intricate feelings in this house.
“Dean Winchester, are you really about to turn down a slice of the best apple pie in town?” Charlie asks as she plops down next to Cas.
His hair is a mess, as per usual. His eyes are the brightest blue Dean has ever seen, and he sure as hell isn’t saying that because he’s completely, utterly in love with him (or maybe he is, but that’s not the point, the point is they’re beautiful and Dean could stare at them for hours). He’s not wearing a shirt either and it’s a sight for sore eyes, miles and miles of tan skin exposed to Dean’s eyes only. But it’s when Cas stares back at him with a tiny smile that Dean feels the actual, goddamn butterfly in his stomach starting to dance.
But for the first time in a decade, the middle of May doesn’t bring Castiel nearly as much joy as it once did. Now it’s forever going to be attached to the memory of his brother bleeding out on the floor of a stupid convenience store, and Cas feels like he’s just walking into never-ending shades of gray.
“Dean? Dean what’s going on?” he asks, immediately straightening up in bed, body tensing in reaction.
“The point is you’re not responsible for the death of all these people, Dean. Are you really telling me that you’re not glad most of these dickbags are gone?”
“You alright?” Dean asks after a while, his breath warm over the skin of Cas’ neck where he’s been pressed for the past 5 minutes, his chest flush against Cas’ naked back. “You’ve been hiding in here all night, I didn’t want to bother you. But you know you can talk to me, right?”
“For the record, I didn’t know either,” he says in a whisper. “That’s the other thing about all of this. I’m human now, and everything is different. I guess I’m still discovering new things about myself every day.”
He doesn’t know how long he stays there, staring at the headstone. It’s easy and quiet, and he surprises himself thinking that Jimmy would like it here somehow.
“It was a mess, and I don’t say this lightly. I had watched people die before, but this… it was horrible. He barely managed to speak through the hiccups and he was losing so much blood, so fast.” His voice breaks on the last word before he picks up again. “We managed to drag him to safety but he was bleeding to death. He died in my arms.”
“Yeah, but you’re not the one who told me,” she argues. “Besides, I love Jess, but I don’t know if she even
“No, I mean you’re an idiot for thinking that I’m… Perfect or whatever. Fuck, Dean, half the time I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. I’m scared too. I feel like one day you’re gonna wake up and realize what a deadbeat I am,” Cas says a little forcefully.
When Benny doesn’t follow up, Dean raises an eyebrow. “Okay? What’s wrong with my mail? Is there a 1 million check in there? ‘Cause if so, we’re going to Vegas.”
“You can get all the colorful cocktails you want if you keep sending me straight to oblivion afterwards,” he whispers with a grin, peppering Cas’ skin with kisses until he reaches that sweet spot behind his earlobe.
“I got so scared of losing you, I thought-” he says, his voice slightly watery still. “I thought you were
“Dean,” Cas whines, rocking heavily on his fingers and diving down to capture Dean’s mouth into a trembling kiss. “Dean, please.”
It takes about half a minute before there’s a warm weight settling against his back and Dean grazes his lips against the curve of his shoulder blade and up the nape of his neck.
Dean looks at Bobby with complete and unadorned sincerity. It’s perhaps one of the first times that he isn’t presenting a front, or putting some defense up. It’s raw and terrible and it’s been simmering within him for two complete days, ever since he watched as Cas went through security at the airport, and it’s so huge to voice out aloud.
“I’m excited for you to meet him too,” he finally says, ripping his eyes away from the horizon to look at Cas with one of his ever-loving gazes. “You nervous?”
He’s starting to babble, which is code for stress when it comes to Cas. Dean reaches out for his hand as Benny sits back on the couch after one last friendly slap to Cas’ shoulder.
“Do you remember when we fought a few months back, on this very same deck? When I told you that Jimmy didn’t hold my sobriety badge, and you asked what was the reason I stayed clean?”
In all honesty, he already knew that. It’s not like it’s news or like he’s discovering it on the spot. But the understanding dawns on him nonetheless.
She sets her bag on the table and makes her way to the couch, sitting in-between both brothers. One of her hands slips to Sam’s knee while she bumps Dean’s fist with the other.
“You’re a dick,” Cas shoves him playfully. “Alright. Well, as I said, we met on the first day of 5th grade. The professors at school had taken a look at my charts and decided to make me skip a year, so I ended up in 5th grade when Jimmy was still in 4th. That’s how I met Dean.”
He’s asleep when it rings, which is partly why when he finally grabs his phone on the nightstand to answer, his brain doesn’t grasp the dramatic aspect of the situation right away.
He manages to get his act together after 5 solid minutes of staring into nothing and leaves, his body acting on auto-pilot while his mind stays behind. Lost in a memory of soft lips and warm skin.
Dean sighs, trying Cas’ phone again when he hears the distinct click of the door opening and a silhouette that is so unmistakably
“And I know that this isn’t what you want to hear. I know that you can’t possibly understand what I’ve been through and how it impacted me, because I don’t talk. And even if I did, I don’t think words can convey even a quarter of how damaged I am. And that’s… that’s fine. No one can, and it’s okay, really. I shouldn’t unload a decade of wounds and trauma on anyone that’s not qualified to hear about it.”
to go back to being Speedy Gonzalez at some point, but until then I’m gonna try and treat my body gently,” Dean answers.
. I’m going to miss you,” he adds, finding the strength to plaster a small smile on his face. “But you really
Cas smiles a little. “I mean, if you don’t plan to take me skydiving, I think I should be safe. So yeah.”
Dean doesn’t stop his thrusts immediately, letting them both ride it out together until they grow slower and he finally sinks down on Cas completely and stops moving.
“I heard you yelling. I came in here and you were… you thought you were back there,” Cas explains, watching as Dean’s eyebrows shoot to his hairline. “In Afghanistan. You kept telling me we had to find Jamie.”
Someone once told me that living is more than just surviving. That you need more than just oxygen in your chest. I don't know if that's true, but every day I’m able to drag these bones from the bed feels like a small victory. Every day the rivers in my mouth don't flood my lungs I count as survival, and for now, that's all the living I can do.
Cas seems to realize Dean is going through something as he stays silent, and draws back slightly to look at him. His hands on Dean’s skin are running lightly on the curve of his back before they settle gently on Dean’s hips.
Not the way he can’t seem to be able to breathe anymore. Not how his heart is in his throat, not how his mind keeps telling him it was always bound to happen, that Dean will always choose to leave over staying. That Cas would never be enough.
“Dean, this is Teddy Watkins,” Cas continues, catching Dean’s eyes over Teddy’s shoulder. “Jimmy and Ted did their residency together.”
“Cas? He came here a few times after you were gone. I think he was looking for you, really, but he never specifically said so.”
When he’s finally done with his compulsive behavior, he pours himself a second cup of coffee and tries to put his mind to work. Balthazar emailed him some photos for an article he’s working on that’s due later today, and he does his best to sink into editing what he’s written.
Cas melts against his mouth, forgetting for a moment that it’s January 20 and it’s crazy cold and they’re not supposed to be there outside in the middle of the night. Dean hums into the kiss like he always does and it sends a little thrill into Cas’ nerves, like some sort of electroshock.
“No,” Dean interrupts, tugging Cas closer against him as he rolls on his side to press against his chest. “What the hell do you have that’s weighing so hard on your conscience that you feel the need to get up at 6am to go
Cas has absolutely no idea who Jamie is, but he guesses it’s a bad omen if Dean only talks about him when he’s in the middle of what looks like a PTSD crisis.
But it’s real. They’re real. They won and they’re free. And Dean loves him so much that sometimes it still feels surreal, being able to stare at him with no shame, knowing they’re allowed the chance to be here together for as long as they want to.
I could tell you that I don’t think about you anymore, that I don’t wonder where you are, or if you’re happy with someone else. But I don’t, because I know the words will just die in my mouth and all I’ll be able to do is smile and admit that I have no idea how I made it this far without you.
Sometimes Dean realizes how much he loves him, and it hits him almost as hard as grief does. Tonight especially, it hits him right in the middle of his soul. He kisses him then, trying to ignore how huge that feeling is as it expands through his chest, and he can feel the smile on Cas’ lips as he licks into his mouth thoroughly.
“Okay, first off this is stupid. You need to stop thinking you deserve to be treated like you’re expandable every time you do something wrong.”
Sam rolls his eyes in an exasperated gesture while Dean takes another sip of his coffee, watching as his brother seems to be struggling to find his own words.
“I know you are, Charlie. I just… I don’t have the strength for this right now. I need to find a place to stay, start my PT, and then maybe once I get that settled I can start looking for a job that fits with all of my broken pieces.”
. And all I could think about was “It’s been two months since I saw him last and I still have so many things to say to him”.”
Dean’s pretty sure today is going to drive him crazy. It started with a spilled coffee on his desk, evolved into having forgotten lunch and running to Charlie’s in the midst of lunch rush, and now he’s stuck trying to figure out what the
and that Dean loves so much — and watches as Castiel finishes making scrambled eggs, wearing only a pair of boxer briefs and that old faded black rock band shirt that suited Dean just fine but somehow fits tighter on Castiel’s broad shoulders and muscular body (which is
. Yes, sure, he loves his job, but his job literally includes running into danger zones and possibly getting killed at any given time. He doesn’t have a
For years he resisted the urge of looking up Castiel’s social media profiles. Resisted sending texts or emails. He had to accept the loss and deal with it, and being so far away in what was essentially another galaxy had been helpful.
“You keep doing that,” Castiel finally says, meeting his eyes again, “Calling me your “friend”, but we have… sexual intercourse every day, sometimes several times a day, I don’t see how that still qualifies me as a “friend”. Do you have sex with all your friends?”
“So what you’re telling me is you made a choice for yourself, you lied to them both, broke both of their hearts in an attempt to… what? Keep them both for yourself?”
Yeah, that’s probably what broke Cas down. Because Dean- of all the people that crossed the Novaks’ streams- is probably the person who’s been the easiest to love all this time. Even after a decade of radio silence and a kaleidoscope of wounds still solidly standing between them. Hell, he’s still as easy to love as the day they first met.
John had left Lawrence when Dean turned 16, fourteen years ago. Both boys had assumed he was dead and by the time Dean had left, nothing had made any of them think that John Winchester could still be alive. But Dean told Cas he was just a few months ago. That he had just bailed on his kids because it was apparently too much for him to handle. He hadn’t said anything else about his dad and the subject had only been partially touched on since then.
This time Dean can’t resist and literally burst out laughing. When he manages to get his composure back, Cas is still looking at him expectantly waiting for an explanation.
Dean groans against his lips as Cas dives down for one more kiss before slightly pushing him out. “I hate this.”
He thinks of his team, of brotherhood and friendships made, of the time he cherished as a Navy SEAL, and of every teammate he’s ever lost.
“James, please,” Dean interrupts with force. “I knew we’d end this way ever since Cas picked up heroin for the first time. I knew he’d break my heart. Of course he’d choose heroin over me.”
When he parks in front of the building, the window from Castiel’s bedroom is lit up, so at least Dean knows he’s in.
He expected the bitterness. The cold anger, even the rage; but all he feels is some sort of deep relief. A rush of affection, and a deep curiosity.
They’re silent for a moment as Sam switches their plates and Dean keeps sipping on his coffee, looking everywhere inside the café but at his brother. He locks eyes with Charlie for half a second, but it’s enough to have her cross the shop and drop on the seat next to Sam.
He’s halfway through the room already, walking across the moms and crying kids, the elderly that’s almost asleep in his chair, when he catches sight of him and his heart stutters in his chest. His eyes focus only on him, Jessica rendered only a blur next to the one he only has eyes for.
Dean’s been through war, ran on more battlefields and into more war zones than his brain can even remember, but somehow it only takes a couple of steps into the hospital to throw him off his feet, metaphorically speaking.
“Mhm, fuck work,” Cas whines as Dean kisses the side of his mouth and goes down the expense of his neck, littering kisses against his skin. “Don’t go.”
Sometimes it’s in the morning when Cas’ arms wrap around his waist and his face presses into the space between his shoulder blades as he’s preparing breakfast, and he’ll just smile an “
Dean, in all his post-coital haze, must notice the wheels running full speed under his scalp, because his mouth softly brushes against his forehead, both arms bringing him closer against him.
He does his best to push them back down his throat and makes his way to the counter, trying really hard to control his breathing.
I’ve grown to be far more cautious; to keep my heart closed in an attempt to save what’s left. In truth, this is the person you left me with.
“Had a bad day. Bobby invited me over. Drank too much. Now I’m lying on the floor of my old bedroom.”
“But you are, Dean. Your doctor has been saying your recovery is phenomenal. I guess I just don’t want you to go too quick and ruin this.”
And I know it’s got nothing to do with the place, and everything to do with how I’m haunted by the memories of us. You’re still here because I can’t help but carry you with me. You’re always here, in the back of my throat, your name carved into my bones. You have not been gone since the day I left.
Dean asked him about it a few days later over his morning coffee, as Cas wrapped himself around him while he prepared scrambled eggs for the both of them in only his boxers. He felt the muscles of Dean’s back stiffen slightly as he explained that the conference would only be three days and that he’ll be back by lunchtime on the fourth day, before brushing a kiss into the dip of Dean’s shoulder.
. Cas thinks to himself, bracing himself for a true Winchester interrogation as he raises up to his feet and comes to sit on a stool on the other side of the kitchen island.
“I suppose yeah, once we get to see each other again. When the time’s right,” he explains, before his heart makes another loop inside his chest as he reads Dean’s text. “Listen, I’m gonna go home, if that’s okay with you.”
Cas sighs, his heart in his throat. “There are already so many lies, so many things unsaid between us. I didn’t mean to find and read them, and I could’ve just gathered them and put them back in the box once they were on the floor in front of me, that’s also true. But I did, and now I can’t really be like “I don’t understand why you’re acting like this, why your head keeps saying “
“You don’t get to leave and come back years later throwing accusations around just because you can’t live with yourself, boy,” Bobby erupts, getting up from his chair and making his way through the living room to stand across Dean. “You
And Dean laughs. He can’t help it. A smile gradually appears on Castiel’s lips as Dean somehow manages to get enough composure to respond.
“My point is, if I ever turn into something like him, you gotta tell me. You gotta talk some sense into me.”
“An asshole, for one,” he scoffs. “Benny is — was, a teammate. He became my team leader shortly after I joined Bravo, and he was also my closest friend ever since I set foot in Virginia.” He raises his head to look at him, “You’d like him, actually. He’s a smug asshole, about 6-7 years older than us. A true work of art. I hope he comes around here at some point, but uh… team guys don’t really get a lot of vacations.”
“Yeah, about your injury. But I’ve known you since you were born. There’s something else creeping beneath your bones. You’re… different.”
Once Cas is settled, he brushes a kiss onto his naked chest, relishing the slight shiver that goes through Dean.
He looks beautiful under the dull light of the moon, the tattoos on his chest almost rendered more visible under the white glow, his scars creating abstract patterns into his skin. Cas knows all about Dean’s struggle with how he sees himself, and if worshiping his skin every opportunity he gets can help him see how gorgeous he looks, scars or no scars, then Cas is going to worship the shit out of his body.
“I just sent everyone home. You were starting to get cranky,” he says before cupping Cas’ face between both of his hands, chuckling at his scandalized face. “What? You know I’m right.”
“Jimmy, hey,” Charlie says softly, almost crouching to catch his eyes. “I swear he’ll be okay. I know it’s scary and we don’t know exactly the extent of his injury yet, but you gotta calm down, man. You’re a doctor, you know the drill.”
“I talked to him last week. I still expect to see his name pop up on my phone with one of his stupid jokes.” Dean says with half a smile on his face.
It takes a moment before Dean stops squirming, before his breath starts settling down, and before he stops shuddering. Cas doesn’t let go, keeps brushing a thumb on Dean’s cheek, letting his other hand card through the mess of his hair after a while.
Dean almost died not knowing how much Cas still loves him, because Jimmy has denied the truth from both he and Cas for almost 10 years, like the fucking coward he is.
The memory of you imprinted on my soul has become heavier than it should be, a weight that I still shoulder, still don’t know how to finally put down. I’m so tired of missing you, of waking up with your name still heavy on the tip of my tongue, still folded behind my teeth and embedded in my bones.
Dean smiles, his eyes still closed, and turns his head to brush a kiss inside of Cas’ palm. There are so many emotions running through Cas as he remembers everything they’ve lived here. The countless amounts of tears he’s cried missing Dean, looking for him in every single detail he could manage to grasp at. And now Dean is here with him, tightly wrapped around him, and they’re moving together towards something beautiful.
But Dean… still loved him then. Dean loved him through every single one of the letters he’d written all over the world while they were apart.
“I kinda want to go again- you know, fuck you into oblivion and all that shit you kept whispering into my ear earlier.”
“Slow the fuck down, for god’s sake Balt,” Cas rolls his eyes, but grateful that Balthazar keeps up his antics. “I don’t really know when I fell in love with him, to be fair. It might have been the first time I saw him, or it might have been later, I don’t know. And he’s the one who kissed me. Sophomore year, under the bleachers while we were skipping our math class together.”
“Okay kiddo, we’re past your bedtime. Let’s go to bed.” Dean says as he tosses the pictures back into the box. “Come on.”
“What the hell is wrong with you?” Cas says, and suddenly he looks more tired than pissed off, more concerned than anything else.
The thing is, things did happen. There’s a giant Dean-shaped hole in both of their heart, an elephant in the room they never ever touch.
“Yeah,” Dean answers softly, bringing the glass of whisky in his hand to his lips, enjoying the way the alcohol warms him up, slowly making its way down his throat and to his stomach. “Yeah, I really am.”
It takes a lot of strength for him to pull back gently, to rip his lips away from Cas when all he really wants to do is clutch him closer, cling onto him until they both forget everything about the past.
“So Cas has barely been away for a day and you’re already being all Broody McBroodiest about it?” Bobby says, clearly teasing him.
When Castiel hangs up and finally crashes on his couch, he feels like he’s suddenly a decade older. Holding back a sob, he sinks his face into his palms and quietly proceeds to cover his eyes.
But ever since Castiel started using, things feel… for lack of a better word, lighter. Sure money tends to get in the way. But Cas is used to doing crappy jobs for a crappy pay-off, and he’s got more than enough to buy what he needs anyway. It’s not like there are any dreams lined-up for him anyway, nothing to save for.
“Hey, it even rhymes!” Dean says before yelping once Cas decides to straddle his lap and goes to town on his mouth.
They’re a reminder that grief doesn’t always have to be a burden. Grief is a journey, and they’re on this one together. One year might just be a drop into the eternity that is life, but it doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to hurt. Time will pass but you won’t forget. And that’s okay. You’ll get there.
It takes Cas a while before he accepts Dean’s embrace and finally let go as the hunter holds him close and tight against him, whispering sweet, soothing words as an attempt to calm him down, one hand threading through the thick lock of dark hair.
Balthazar rolls his eyes dramatically and Cas can’t help but laugh at the sight. He hasn’t seen him in a while, and it’s nice to go back to their usual banter.
He’s on the phone the next minute as he paces around the room to collect all of his things, and barely 20 minutes later he’s off.
He looks insanely hot in-between Cas’ thighs, lips stretched tightly around him, a mess of precome and saliva escaping his mouth at the corners as he slides down faster and faster; his eyes vibrant green from where he’s looking up at Cas under his perfect eyelashes.
“I only want to take a shower if you’re coming with,” Cas grumbles against him before lifting his head up. “But we should probably wait until everyone’s gone- wait, where is everyone?”
For my non-smut reader, skip the scene when Dean and Cas are on the phone the first time (once you reach the smutty part).
“It’s not the place that’s important. It’s the people that were here,” Cas explains. “It’s the life we’ve lived within this space. It’s Jimmy’s residency driving him so insane that he’d make pancakes at 3 AM when coming back home. It’s me fighting my addictions for the past 9 years. It’s you all those years back, walking in here and settling down with me for the first time. And it’s you coming back to me a little over a year and a half ago. It’s us deciding to be together again. It’s Holli and Leia joining us.”
It feels surreal, being able to have a very nice conversation with him after all this time. Dean realizes right there at that very moment that he wished Castiel wouldn’t have to leave.
He loves Dean, he really does. At this point in their life, it almost feels like he and Sam are part of their fucked up family. But he’s also starting to develop a weird case of jealousy towards him, and he hates it.
Cas rolls his eyes. “I’m only here because I promised Alicia I’d keep an eye on your stupid ass, and because I’m trying to be a good friend. Maybe I just don’t want to meddle.”
He wipes his hand on a rag before taking his phone out to check his texts. Cas hasn’t sent him anything yet apart from two hours ago when he told him they were getting started.
It takes his phone buzzing repeatedly for Cas to finally snap back into consciousness, and even then he’s not sure his soul is still in his body. He promptly dismisses Dean’s call and reads the last part of the letter he’s been holding for the past 5 minutes.
Dean’s blood freezes in his veins. There are three things that are never spoken of in the Singer household: Donald Trump, the Pythagorean theorem (don’t ask), and John Winchester.
out of every chapter that landed on her lap (sometimes less than 24 hours before posting) and still managed to look good while doing it;
It’s one of those nights where Dean hasn’t been able to fall asleep and as such, has retreated to the peace and quiet of the living room, leaving Cas to sleep alone inside the bed they now share. Except now when Cas wakes up alone in bed, he immediately gets up and chases after Dean.
Soooooo... How are we feeling about this? Did you notice all the little tidbits that are threatening to explode? What are you expecting in the next chapter? TELL ME EVERYTHING. 👀
There’s something peaceful about waking up next to a sleeping Dean. In fact Castiel is almost sure he hasn’t slept this well in… well, a decade.
And so, I will continue to twist ink into your name for as long as I can hold my pen, as long as your echo finds a home beneath my skin. You will always be a story I was meant to write, even if I’ll never be able to change the way it ended.
“No, I have an article due in a couple of days and I still haven’t managed to get to it. Also I still need to do the grocery shopping at some point. It’s been a mess.”
It’s not like he expected him not to be there. He had to be there, Jimmy was everything to him. His last man standing. It’s not even like he was holding out hope for Cas to still be available, for Cas to still want him. He made it pretty clear a decade ago that Dean wasn’t what he wanted.
*side-eyes next chapter* WELL WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN NEXT? (for real though, give me your best guess and assumptions)
His voice is so heavy with grief and sadness that Dean almost forgets how to breathe as Cas keeps going.
And Dean and Cas’ special star shines on as they kiss, and kiss, and kiss, like they can’t ever get enough of each other’s lips. They’ll probably catch a cold in the end, and none of them cares.
His lips are on Dean’s jaw now, making their way to his temple, and Dean delights in the little shiver that goes through his body as Castiel’s lips move on his skin.
But that’s the thing about Cas. He gives and gives and gives, and Dean feels like he’s the king of all assholes because he keeps breaking promises- like being there with Cas when he gets their pinky promise tattoo on his hips, mirroring Dean’s.
Balthazar’s eyes are too fiery for his own good, but Cas knows his friend enough to know he values their relationship too much to fuck with it. He makes a point of adding something, though.
“No it’s not. And it’s alright. I got you,” Cas whispers against his mouth, and Dean suddenly feels wetness against his lips. “You don’t have to apologize to me for missing him, too. I know how it feels.”
But still. Witnessing it playing out in front of his eyes even after 10 years, especially with all the pain that Jimmy’s death brings?
Dean awakes to ice-cold skin being pressed up against his, hair tickling against his jaw as Castiel buries his face in the crook of his neck. Both of his arms find their way around him on instinct, bringing him closer, enjoying the weight of the former angel against him. He only seems to be wearing boxer briefs as he usually does now, but for some reason, his skin feels like he just went through two ice baths.
“How was your shift?” Cas asks, bringing the bottle to his lips and taking a sip of his beer, still without glancing at his brother.
Dean watches him go down the street until he’s into the building, and then starts texting Charlie to set up the next part of his plan
“Yeah, okay,” he says with a soft smile. “But you’re gonna have to bear with my slow ass, I‘m still a recovering mess.”
When Benny doesn’t answer and hands him the letter, Dean shakes his head, feeling slightly dizzy. Sick, even.
Cas laughs next to him. For a moment Dean considers. Getting to wake up next to Cas every day, knowing that he’s
“It’s okay, I’ve got you,” Dean murmurs, dipping down for a slow kiss before pushing him down on his back. “Don’t be too loud though, Benny’s next door.”
Benny laughs at him as he stands up. “Is that a yes? We’re gearing up for an op, everyone’s here. They’ll be happy to see you.”
Dean lets go of Cas’ hips reluctantly to fiddle with the inner pocket of his jacket, until he finds it and brings it out.
Posting early for no other reason than "it was ready and I couldn't wait to share"! I'm probably gonna keep updating on Fridays/Saturdays from now on because I like it better than Sundays lmao.
The way from the cabin to the devil's trap had felt so much shorter the first time around, when he hadn't been thinking about it much, distracted by the walkie-talkie communication. Maybe they had long passed the building, traversing the forest in an angle just slightly off, obscuring the cabin from their view?
That name had been his missing link to reality. It reinforced the fortress walls, turned it into the place of absolute safety that had been promised. He swore to himself he wouldn't lose the name again, no matter what.
Just that it wasn't. It had been ripped away from him just like that. No warning, no solace, not even a goodbye. Cas had assured him he didn't have to worry about the deal, that it was unlikely it would ever come to fruition. And Jack had believed him, both because he trusted him and because these words matched with what he knew about life.
"Rowena." Sam grabbed her sleeve. "Rowena, we know you're not betraying us. We trust you. Just, please. Tell us what's going on."
Dean stepped forward and lifted one of their arms to touch the smoke that made up the demonic presence. The tendrils avoided the spot where his hand was and the red smoke wafted around his fingers.
sense was a shift in the atmosphere indicating the momentary connection of two planes. Or the familiar, melodic touch of grace reaching out to his own through the ether, promising safety, acceptance, forgiveness, promising something that was unconditional and eternal.
"My gr—" Jack swallowed his initial response. Despite the fact that this voice gave him the inexplicable impression of talking to someone he knew and trusted, Jack had been manipulated and lied to by strangers too often to just throw caution to the wind entirely. "God."
She left the cave, but before Sam had much chance to wonder if he was supposed to follow, she was already back. And what she was carrying was too absurd to leave him unaffected.
A soft rustling of cloth heralded the witch's return and he felt rather than saw her crouch down next to him.
It took her several seconds to ingest his words and the suddenness of the outburst that followed surprised Sam enough to flinch slightly.
"That wasn't what I—" Roderick frowned and shook his head. "Figures you know Feathers, too. Where the Winchesters go, Castiel can't be far."
gaping hole in his memory, gnawing away at his sanity. He didn't know how he had gotten to this room, strapped to a torturing table. The last thing he remembered was a tornado of demonic force inside of him, his mind suddenly filled with more voices than he could count. And then they had pressed him down, down, down until he had lost any and all awareness of his surroundings.
Dean faltered, withdrew from him. The sudden shift in power drained most of the color from Balthazar's body. The oily substance took over, claiming the angel almost entirely. Then it reached the strand of grace that connected him to Castiel, and burrowed in deeply. Castiel screamed, an involuntary outburst in his true voice, and felt Dean flinch in their body before the Empty's hold on Castiel grew strong enough that a surge of despair dragged him under.
"Not a demon," Sam said, finally sitting down in the passenger seat and closing the door on his side. "And not a Shapeshifter," he continued, taking back his tie pin before fastening his seatbelt. "But Dean, you're acting exceedingly strange! Since when do you know how to
Jack didn't give Roderick any chance to complete that sentence and rushed him with renewed vigor. The demon tried to stab him on arrival, but Jack's heightened senses had also increased his reflexes and he could easily dodge the attack. Maybe his eyes had regained their golden glow, because the other man was now staring at his face with a caution that hadn't been there before.
, listen to me," the voice implored, a ruptured whisper in the sudden quiet of the room. "I heard what he said, and he is mistaken. I may be dead, but you are
"I did," Dean agreed, his hands hovering over the steering wheel without touching it, as if that could absolve him of what had happened. "And I didn't like the sound of it."
Dean thought as his foot was pressed down against the gas pedal without his own doing. Only after the sentence was out in the open did he wonder if it had been a good idea to talk to an
Chuck must have realized he was running out of time, so he snapped his fingers to finish the symbols around the sigil and there was nothing Jack could do about it. Another loud gurgling sound pulled his gaze back to the fissure. It widened and then spit out a humanoid form. In the moment of passing between realms, the figure was still entirely covered by gooey, black oil, but the substance dropped away mid-leap.
"It's a marvel, isn't it? Maybe carbon-based life is fine after all, yttrium is so... bland anyway. Maybe I should bring back animals."
Absurdly, the phone in his hand was his last threadbare connection to reality, feeling the vibrations tingle against the nerves of his fingers while numbly staring at the display. Even crying had been better, but his last tears had left him a while ago. The vibrations stopped again, sending him back into the swirl of ice and blackness in his mind.
Moving as quietly as he could, he went over to the table where the contents of Sam's backpack were still spread out. The colors of his surroundings weren't as vibrant as they were in daylight, but what he could see sufficed to write a short letter on the notepad. The pen scratched over the paper as a chorus to the soft snores from behind.
Whoever this peculiar man was, Jack was thankful for the distraction, and for the simple fact that he was no longer all alone with thoughts and feelings that were far too loud. The voice still danced around a feeling of familiarity that he couldn't quite pinpoint. He latched onto the chance at conversation, anything to keep him from falling back into that deep hole of despair he'd been stuck in before.
Dean could feel the dread rise again, clawing at his chest. He swallowed against it. When he finally found his voice, it was a raw, trembling thing.
Lit by smaller torches at the walls, the room's layout was vaguely familiar to Sam. A lavish bed adorned the opposite wall, together with a smaller table. The side of the room they were standing in held another table, a bigger one, with various food plates arranged on top of it. A part of him expected to see the walls lined with an abundance of books, but the only thing present in these shelves were golden figurines depicting battle scenes.
Time had lost its meaning in this fortress of memory. He didn't know if he had re-lived every single choice he regretted for minutes or decades now. A whispered string of a thought told him that it would continue for longer, so much longer. That this was only just the start. That he would repent for eternity. That he deserved nothing less.
The demonic essence wasn't suffocating this time, had merely interrupted whatever reaction had been happening between grace and soul, before backing down to give Castiel sufficient room again. Confused beyond measure, Castiel didn't know what to think.
"We could create some new ones, too," Chuck said as he followed the squirrel. "Or bring back dinosaurs, they were epic! Yep, I—"
way... or our way," Sam agreed. "He got what he wanted in every other universe. And he wiped out all of them as soon as he had it. But this one's still here."
Hearing Dean referred to as a meatsuit only served to increase Jack's fury. He redoubled his efforts, putting all of his anger into the stabs directed at the most vital parts of a body inhabited by the
"My interior design was clearly superior," Rowena whispered to him and he realized they were back in the chamber where Jack and Dean had slept while Sam and Rowena had been doing research on the Empty in what now felt like a different lifetime. Only that the furniture looked entirely different now, even though the general arrangement was similar. He tried hard not to linger on the memory, not to allow his mind to summon the faces of the people whose loss he'd be unable to cope with.
Considering the suggestion, Sam nodded slowly. "Right. I keep forgetting. How long has it been for you now, three days?"
Castiel sighed, had to force himself not to avert his gaze once more, to face the light directly until his entire field of vision was filled with a starless night sky.
Names were lost to him, but there was still recognition of the feelings attached to each of the faces in his mind.
The deepest, darkest basin of his mind had kept Cas' last words to him out of reach, but now it all came back to him, dragged to the surface forcefully. It was a gasping, thrashing thing that had been close to suffocating. Never before had hope burned like acid in his lungs.
Turning his attention towards the man, Dean offers a slightly nervous smile, hoping his bravado covers it up. “Heya, Cas. Nice digs.”
Scrubbing his hands over his face, he lets out a slightly hysterical laugh. “You’re a fucking dumbass.”
“Death,” Dean huffs out a laugh. “Now she’s a hoot. If she’d join the fuckin’ party we’d actually be golden.”
Rejection, honestly, isn't a new thing for Dean Winchester. It's something he takes in stride, something he accepts and moves on from. No sense in moping over something that's already done.
“Expulsion?” Mary blurts out. “How will that solve anything? He should receive discipline and learn how to correct his wrongs.”
Dean reflexively reaches up to touch his face. His cheekbone is still a little tender, but he thinks he does a good job at hiding his wince. “What?”
"You don't have to be good," Castiel says, sitting back in his chair as he regards Dean. His eyes are so intense, Dean only just notices the spectacles resting on his nose, the lenses catching the light and reflecting it. "You just have to enjoy it."
i know the time jumps seem weird, but this story is more like a compilation of detailed snapshots of their life together. it'll smooth out into lengthier pieces as it goes on. also i don't mean to have more dean pov than cas pov but that's just how it's happening ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“He will be,” Castiel says. “Tell Benny to call me first thing in the morning.” He’s still angry, not trusting himself to go seek out Benny on his own. And he still feels guilty, too; a mix he knows he doesn’t want to approach Dean with.
Left alone in the room with the listless woman, Castiel sinks down into the chair. It has a cushion on it, a fraction more comfortable than the plastic chairs in the other waiting room. He pulls his phone out of his pocket, flips it open and closed a few times, then sighs and sets it on the chair next to him.
“It’s different every time,” Sam says. He rolls up Castiel’s floor rug neatly, leaning it against the wall of the living room. He pulls a can of red spray paint out of his bag, crouching to start coloring the wood floor.
in regards to both the Winchesters that he often needs to physically distance himself in order to gather his bearings.
Letting out a shuddery breath, Castiel straightens. He holds out his hand towards Sam, steeling his resolve. Everything confusing in this world will be brought to clarity in the next, and right now, in this moment, he feels more determined than scared. This is not his life. This is not his world. This is not his story.
Dean’s expression softens as he stares at the D-ring his wrists are connected to. He wrings his fingers together slowly, and when he lifts his gaze to lock with Castiel’s, the reporter feels his gut sink heavily to the floor.
The man rolls his eyes, turning his back to Dean. Pissed, but knowing his limits, Dean leaves. He turns up the collar of his leather coat, bracing himself against the windy, damp evening. He's frustrated. He
Massively confused, but also knowing that the man is talking about Dean, Castiel frowns. “I don’t understand.”
young. My bar is eighteen and up. It just completely escaped me to check his I.D. when I set him up for work."
want to be a prostitute his whole life. Hell, he never wanted to be one in the first place, but life sucks, and his manages to suck a lot, so. Here he is.
!” Castiel takes a step back to steady himself, the ground beneath his feet rumbling with the man’s rage. The man matches his step. Castiel’s eyes feel like they’re about to burn out of his skull. “The obvious answer is to just take you out of the equation.”
“You’d be surprised as to how many men would be willing to follow you around with a pillow,” he reassures her. Another kiss to her forehead, then he gestures to the tray. “Will you be able to get that?”
When Castiel comes back to himself he throws his hands up to his throat, trying to quell the coughing fit trying to overtake him. “Jack?” He repeats,  voice raw.
Whuffing a laugh, some blood drips onto the locker where a kid has his head pinned to the cool metal. He opens one eye, making a show of looking at each kid’s groin. “None of you ugly, small-dicked jerks.”
"I did," the man says. Without his trench coat Dean can see his body better; broad shoulders and chest, thick forearms where his sleeves are rolled up. His hair looks windswept despite the wetness in the strands, his five o'clock shadow bordering on salt-n-pepper scruff. His eyes are as pretty as the morning sky. "I'm Castiel Novak."
Not answering right away, Castiel puts the perfectly medium-rare steaks on the wooden cutting board. He slices through them with a knife, peeling them into beautiful strips, then turns on the oven light to open the handle and check the baked potatoes.
Michael looks at Dean imploring. Dean shakes his head as casually as possible, sending a smile up to the waiter. "Spritzer?"
Castiel pushes off of the wall, offering Charlie a clearly forced smile. “I’ve got your help now, though. I think I might sleep a little better.” It’s a lie, but he doesn’t want Charlie to be worried about him.
Dean’s eyes water a bit more, the green of his irises like water lilies on a spring afternoon. “Thank you, Castiel.”
Flushing brightly, Dean folds his arms over his chest. "I ain't tryna hook all my life, y'know. Career changes are a thing."
. He both existed and was non-existent at the same time. Every time police questioned Sam he insisted that he hadn't heard from Dean since he was sixteen years old, and he prefers it that way, thank you very much. Police eventually stopped bothering the young Winchester. Castiel thinks there’s something there, but he’s not about to fly all the way out to California to try and shake down a kid that, for all of the evidence in front of him, could care less what his psychotic brother is getting up to.
"Me neither. Look, Mike, if you're really sorry about what happened, that's swell and all, but I left that life behind and am doin' good now. I don't need to be dragged down memory lane so you can get your kicks."
“I want you to stay with me. I don’t ever want to be anywhere you aren’t- not anymore. And it scares the shit out of me when I wake up in the middle of the night and you’re not… there.”
Castiel doesn’t think it will ever get normal, as he quietly loses himself in the sensation, his lips parting to allow Dean’s tongue in.
Sitting on the deck, he reaches for the bottle and comes to the realization that he might have left Afghanistan as a wounded shell of a soldier; but here in Lawrence he’s still a soldier. Only the battlefield is now home and it’s left to him to patch things together again.
And so they stay like that, safe into their own embrace, breathing together. Dean raises a hand to card gently through Cas’ hair after a minute, his eyes closing as if on queue. Cas gasps quietly against him at the touch, and Dean melts a little at the sound.
“Because my entire life I only had Jimmy, and no one else. I never even knew who my dad was, and my mom was a junkie. I know that she cared for us but like, heroin came first. In retrospect, it’s kinda hilarious that she somehow managed to pass that down to me, but anyway. So the concept of anyone caring enough about me to tell me “Hey, if you need to escape, I’m here for you” was so strange and unreal for me that I couldn’t even believe it.”
Even now, the world's turning slows when I think of you. It’s as if my body can still remember the weight of your touch. I know it won't always be like this, your name won't always be razor wire in my throat. But for now, I have to accept that the pain will still hang around the edges of the hole you left inside my soul.
And now here he is. Hopelessly in love and happier than he could’ve ever dreamt to be, almost two years after coming back to Lawrence thinking his life was done.
Somehow, this hits Jimmy even harder than the rest. Castiel had always been the taller, more muscular out of the two of them. He enjoyed running and sports as a whole, when Jimmy was content to just stay on the sideline and cheer both his brother and his best friend on whenever they had a game. Cas had lost so much weight the past few months that all of his muscles had melted away.
“What was that for?” Cas smiles against his lips afterward, a hand wrapped around his cup of tea while the other goes to Dean’s thigh. “Did I forget my birthday or something?
Bobby huffs and Dean hears him come closer, the sound of his steps on the concrete floor of the garage he’d know anywhere.
“You were,” he smiles sadly and for half a second Dean seems shocked by the admission. “I know that sounds stupid, doesn’t it. Because to me, for the past ten years you were the one who walked out because I did drugs. Or as Jimmy put it, because I was a fucking junkie.”
He doesn’t know it yet, but his world is about to collapse before it rises from the ashes of the past 27 years.
Balthazar leans his back on a chair, and Cas can see how he quickly takes in the entire room’s appearance, and the way Dean’s stuff is scattered all over the place.
There’s a single tear rolling on Castiel’s cheek as his voice breaks on the last word, and Dean feels his own heart tearing apart. He knows nothing he would say can fix it, nothing he would do can bring Jimmy back and Castiel can’t heal if he doesn’t let himself grieve.
therapy? You?” Bobby says, a huge grin on his face. “Wow, that’s something I never expected to hear from your mouth.”
Dean must hear the change of tone in his voice because he immediately does as he’s told and turns around to face him, both of them sitting crossed-legs on the edges of the deck. Cas instantly misses his warmth against him, but once Dean faces him he brings both of his hands to Dean’s face and wipes his tears with both thumbs, eyes intensely locked into his.
Cas doesn’t know what to say. To be fair he doesn’t really know why it’s irking him so much. He knows it comes from a place of concern, but Dean deserves this. He’s worked so hard to get to this point, and Cas really wants to be happy for him.
But Bobby doesn’t move, his eyes still wide as he stares at him. So Dean’s left with his hand stupidly in the hair, the coffee weighing more and more as he waits for the older man to pick up.
He doesn’t know why he feels this insecure. It’s insane, it’s not like it’s a regular Joe sharing his bed. Cas’ hand is on his cheek suddenly, brushing a thumb at the apple, going down the line of his jaw and Dean sighs into the touch, closing his eyes on impact.
I am not the soft, gentle person you once knew. I have become a thing of edges; more bone than marrow, more the riverbed than the water. The anxiety has bloomed in my chest, and these days everything trembles. Nothing here is still.
Dean hums against Cas’ mouth, tugging at his lower lip trapped between his teeth. Cas hisses at the sensation and Dean quickly let go before kissing him again, and again, and again.
It feels like he’s walking on clouds, and it’s a very weird state for him to be in after all the panic and anxiety of before. It vaguely feels like he’s been on a rollercoaster that took him through the entire spectrum of emotions in a matter of minutes, and he honestly kind of feels like collapsing right here and now.
“I’m not saying this will absolve him or whatever,” he starts, his voice more rough than he intends to. “But maybe, just maybe this will help you, at the very least to understand why he did what he did. And I think if we’re both serious about going through with this, about healing and rebuilding our relationship. I think this is important.”
“Alright,” Benny complies. “If he does anything stupid, you have my permission to smack his stupid head.”
“I needed to get out for a couple of days. Okay? I need a break. I thought you’d be happy to see me.”
It’s been 6 years since Dean left. 4 since Cas relapsed. He’s going to clock 4 years sober in a couple of weeks, which is huge.
There’s a shadow of a smile on Castiel’s lips before he answers, his voice soft. “It’s been 8 years or so. It could’ve been 10 but I relapsed at some point.”
Cas comes with Dean’s name on his tongue barely a minute after, and Dean follows suit mere seconds after.
Jimmy checks their surroundings only to find out that Cas has made his way back outside and is lying on the deck again, staring at the sky. He scoffs, shakes his head as he returns to preparing his backpack.
“I’m not an angel anymore. I can’t save you. I can’t even heal you properly. So you’ve got to stop-”
When Dean comes out of his room it’s already bordering 7 pm, Cas has just sent his article to the publisher and is currently pumping his fist in the air. Dean laughs as he makes his way to the living room and collapses on the other side of the couch with a deep sigh.
“He said he didn’t, and I quote, “Want to be with a fucking junkie”. That this was too much for him to handle.”
Dean works his chin up to Cas’ shoulder, his cheek deliberately pressed against the side of Cas’ neck, where it’s warm and inviting and smells like sleep. The hunter can’t resist and drops a kiss where Cas’ shoulder meets his neck, the skin soft and delicious.
, Castiel decides on Tuesday as his alarm goes off at 8 am for what seems like a fucking eternity. He eventually stretches his arm to grab his phone from the bedside table and turns it off, the effort leaving him breathless.
Castiel’s voice is low, clear. The one he uses whenever he wants Dean to understand something important, whether it’s about bumblebees being the most important thing in the universe or telling Jack about the constellations when they watch the stars at night on the bunker’s roof.
Lying in bed, eyes glued to the ceiling as if it holds the secret to the universe, Castiel doesn’t remember if he’s even managed to fall asleep at some point since he went to bed last night. It’s too easy to lose himself in the vacuum of silence that bathes the whole place into sanctuary. Too easy to forget that there’s still a world out there that awaits him somehow.
Charlies raises her head to catch his stare, and he can see that her eyes are glassy. His stomach feels like he’s swallowed cement and the mere thought of finishing his plate makes him want to puke.
He wants Dean to re-learn him, too. Wants to feel the weight of his hands down his chest, taste the salt of his skin, the yearning on his tongue. Wants to feel his face buried in the crook of his neck, his breath skitting over his skin as he’d fill him up until all he could see, breath, smell, feel, hear, is Dean, only Dean, Dean,
Dean can’t resist. He knows her enough to know her intentions were good, and it’s not her fault she didn’t know when he’s the one who doesn’t so much as talk. So he wraps her in his arms, in the middle of the ER, and gives him a hug like not ever before.
Neither of them seems to want to let go, their embrace warm and full of everything they don’t want to put words on. Cas closes his eyes, breathing Dean in as the other man’s mouth brushes a feather-like kiss over his temple. He doesn’t speak, but he doesn’t need to. It’s almost like Cas can feel the tenderness that’s overflowing from his entire body.
It’s true, he doesn’t. It can’t go lower than where it is already. They’re not speaking, Bobby hates his ass. Even if this goes wrong, it can’t be worse than it already is. Which isn’t really comforting, but it at least gives Dean the push he needs to get out of the car.
Dean used to think Castiel’s hair was glorious, but that was even before realizing than Castiel’s post-hair sex is a
Dean finally turns with the pan in hand and puts it on the table before wiping his hands and sitting at the table.
And he tries again now, offering Dean the best of his puppy eyes. Cas refrains from smiling too wide, well aware that if their dog saw it, Dean’s tentative argument would be done in a flash.
And to crown it all, now that he’s home and preparing things for tonight’s meal, he’s missing the star ingredient for the dinner he had planned.
He even considered calling Balthazar at some point, but quickly remembered that the “Dean situation”, as Jimmy called it, had been so carefully kept under wraps for the past ten years that most of his friends don’t even know who Dean is.
He has been there, and he doesn’t think that’s what Cas deserves, so he keeps going, watching him carefully as he squeezes his hand. A silent reminder that Castiel is not alone in this.
“You say that you love me, you say that you want to be with me,” Dean whispers but to Cas it feels like a scream. “And all I can think is that I don’t know how to be yours.”
For a second Cas looks stunned, until he looks like he’s about to say something… And then he rises instead, puts the bottle of Jack down right next to Dean’s thigh with a loud slam and leaves the room.
It takes a while before Cas speaks again. Dean can hear the edges of his anger woven into his words.
Castiel is purposely avoiding Dean’s eyes. Which isn’t good. It’s never good. So Dean bends down a little, extends his hand to tip his chin slightly up until their gaze connects.
“Do you want to go for a walk, maybe?” he asks tentatively. Not sure what he’s doing but going for it anyway.
I still do. That’s the issue here, I still do. And the ashes from the burnt letters are glued to my skin, the shadow of the words you wrote returning to ask me
For Dean, it turned out that riding into the sunset actually meant getting Cas back, knocking some sense into him, getting his own head out of his ass and figuring out this thing that had been left wildly untold between them for a decade. After a while, it also meant a house on a lake, Sunday visits to the farmer market, double dates with Sam and Eileen on the regular, and enjoying the back-and-forth of all their kids and relatives as they fixed up the little house they bought together.
“Be quiet,” Dean laughs around his cock, letting his tongue lick slowly at the slit where precome already drools before sliding all the way down his length.
This was before he fell for humanity, before he started feeling things, before he became a member of Team Free Will.
So when Sam wanders in the bunker, leaving his beloved library to tell Dean he’s going out for a while, hopefully catching a movie and get food on his way back, it’s safe to say that he’s pretty surprised at the sight of a black and red striped sock on Dean’s door-handle.
Cas smiles, emotions bubbling up to the surface at the sound of Dean’s voice- it’s stupid, really. He knows that he’ll be home in about 48 hours, that he’s barely four states over and that Dean is most likely sleeping in a bed they share, in a place they’ve been living in together for the most part of the past year.
At that Cas slightly tilts his head to take a look at Dean’s face, propped up on an elbow. His eyes are shimmering with what Cas is almost sure are unshed tears.
Dean’s heart sinks a little at the clear sadness that seems to be emanating from Charlie’s words. He turns his head to look at her and feels his resolve starting to crumble.
He’s standing in the middle of the room, running gear in place, hair fucked sixty ways to Sunday, and
I’ve been pondering for months, wondering if I should come clean. Truth be told, I wanted to tell Cas 8 years ago. I was gearing up to doing so, but then he relapsed. I found him on the floor of the apartment’s bathroom, a needle still inserted in his arm, and the only thing he was able to tell me before he crashed was your name. It took everything in me not to crack, not to come clean on the spot. He was trying so hard, Dean. And I believed, at the time, that the truth would kill him.
“My point is,” Cas continues, smiling at Dean. “It’s okay to discover new things about the person you share your life with. I don’t… I can’t say that I have a lot of experience with how relationships work, but I think it’s healthy. And I don’t think you’re a bad boyfriend just because you,” he gestures at his underwear. “Didn’t know that I liked wearing bright underwear.”
“Cas,” he struggles to say as said-Cas trails his tongue down his shaft before going up and suckling at the tip, eyes never wavering from Dean’s face. “
“No sports, for at least a week. No biking. No running. And for the love of God, don’t wind up in my E.D again or I’m pretty sure your brother will rise back from the dead and haunt my ass.”
“I got it because I needed a reminder of you,” looking at his tattoo where Cas is still drawing the contour as he speaks. “I needed you with me, even if you were gone.”
“Okay. Do you mind explaining yourself or are you just going to sit there and…” she gestures at him. “Wallow?”
Cas makes it home around 9 pm, drained and exhausted, but at least he doesn’t feel like he needs a constant fix to stay upright. He pushes the front door half expecting Dean to have gone out as well because he doesn’t have the heart to deal with any of that in the state that he’s in right now.
My kill list weighs a ton in my inner pocket. I started writing down the number of people I had killed during my first deployment. Names, if I had them. At first it was just a way to try and keep rationalizing the killing. The tip of the spear goes where it’s pointed, after all. I’m not responsible for them. At least, that’s what you’re convincing yourself, that’s what you’re taught.
Cas finally tears his eyes away from the ceiling and ocean blue meets forest green, and Dean’s heart misses a beat before he picks up the words again.
It’s subtle, this missing you. I’ve never really been able to find the right words to describe how it feels to miss you, but longing from home comes the closest. Not having you next to me feels like every cell in my body yearning to be somewhere else, somewhere that feels like home. And I’m not entirely sure that feeling will ever go away, but maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be. Maybe these bones were built to miss you, and your absence is the price I have to pay for this strength.
In retrospect, Charlie’s silence should’ve been the first sign that all hell was about to break loose, but Jimmy didn’t have time to stop and contemplate it.
I have tried to get rid of your memory, mostly by self-destructing. But you’ve always been able to find me even when my heart begs you not to. In the end, I don’t think anything will ever manage to get you out of my mind. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to properly let you go, or even if I’ll have any say about it.
It really was a stupid fight, about Dean’s birthday and how he didn’t want to celebrate. It spiraled from this to a fight about many other things that Cas doesn’t even want to think about anymore. They usually try not to go to bed mad at each other, but tonight was the exception. And now Cas tries not to break down as he watches Dean’s hand tremble as he runs his finger into Holli’s fur.
His smell lingers in Dean’s nostrils, a faint hint of fabric softener; Cas’ citrus shampoo. And for the first time in two months Dean finally feels like he’s made it home.
Cas smiles back, his panic quieting in his stomach. Maybe he’s actually going to like it, here in Lawrence.
They stay like that for a while, silent and cared for, the only sound disturbing the quiet comfort being Holli and Leia chasing each other upstairs. Dean thinks back to 11 years before and writing that last letter to Cas. He thinks of how broken-hearted he was, of how giving up on Cas made him want to throw up. He remembers grabbing the closest piece of paper, abandoning his neat writing for a scribble in capital letters. He remembers everything he wrote down, how his stomach twisted as he promised Cas to finally let him go.
It might be the way Charlie’s voice when she tells him Dean is in the hospital after barely getting out of his last deployment alive still rings in his head, or the way his heart crumpled and threatened to give out ever since.
Love, in all the forms you might find it, can be messy and complicated. It holds an ability to sit in the deepest parts of your soul and ache, and even the air you breathe becomes a weight to be carried.
Jimmy had thought, probably wrongfully, that moving out of Gallagher’s would’ve at least slowed him down. He assumed that Cas had started using because of the abuse he sustained, but the abuse was gone and he was still high as a kite every night.
When Cas comes, it’s with a shout and a moan that Dean swallows with a kiss. He shakes through the strength of it as Dean continues to stroke both of them until he comes over his own fingers with a whimper and Cas’ name folded behind his teeth and heavy on his tongue.
There are questions he still doesn’t dare to ask, doesn’t even dare to poke. Is he okay? Is he single? Does he still think about me every day, like I try not to? Does it still hurt when he thinks of me?
“What’s going on, sweetheart?” he asks, knowing damn well what’s going on but refusing to take the words away from Cas.
Dean hauls Cas up and kisses him deep, eager to feel those full lips on his again. His fingers trail on Cas’ sides before they reach Cas’ perfect ass. Dean draws back slightly to lock eyes with him, eyebrow cocked in a silent question.
But he also can’t do that to Cas. Can’t expose him to the shit he’s dealing with, can’t allow him to feel how broken he is. Can’t fuck him up the way he invariably does whenever he gets close to anyone.
I only learned a few months after Cas’ overdosed that you two actually fought like hell every time he poked a needle into his vein. That it almost broke you apart, but for some reason you kept holding on. That Cas had always been convinced you would leave because you were so tired of it all. That’s probably why he wasn’t surprised when I told him you left. I believe some part of him had always expected you to.
I honestly don’t know if I could have loved you more than I did, but maybe I should have tried. Maybe I could have held the pieces of myself together a little longer. Or maybe I need to accept that sometimes the water just pulls you under, and drowning isn’t a question of how hard you tried to swim.
Again, this simple sentence seems to be acting like a slap to Dean’s face and he lets go of Cas’ hands, his green eyes glinting with hurt. But Cas aches so much that he doesn’t find it in him to even care. It’s like fire eating at him inside, ripping through his guts and wreaking havoc all the way into his throat.
When Cas walks through the door of his apartment that night, he’s determined to tell Dean about the letters, and generally set on getting to the bottom of what’s been happening between them both, for the sake of his own sanity. He doesn’t know how he’s going to get there, or through this, but he has to. If not for the good of his own sanity, then for Dean. Dean deserves to know.
“Hey,” Dean says, instantly brushing the pad of his thumb to wipe the tear off. “I’m here. It’s okay.”
Dean just rolls over and tries to get back to sleep. After 10 minutes of tossing, turning, and trying to figure out why the fuck everything hurts so much, he gets a hold of his phone and shoots a few texts to Charlie and Sam.
call, Dean. As a team leader and as your Master Chief, I’m bearing responsibility for that. Not you. And you need to get over it instead of ruining your own life. You’re out Dean. You need to start living instead of being stuck in survival mode.”
Then there are the other scars. What Cas can only guess are bullet wounds, littered on various places of Dean’s body. A long white scar traced on his lower abdomen that’s probably from a knife or something close. The careful scars on his hip from the surgeon that replaced it with a titanium one.
Learning that you’ve been toyed with, especially for more than ten years is probably never an enjoyable thing to go through.
“You know what, I told Sam this was a bad idea and maybe I was right,” he scoffs. “I’ll leave you to it.”
Dean steadies his grip on him then, his palms resting against Castiel’s shoulder blades, and lowering his head to catch his gaze. His eyes are closed now, and Dean can’t resist but dropping a kiss on his forehead, and the bridge of his nose, and his cheek, before he finally presses one on Cas’ chapped and appealing lips. Dean smiles at Castiel’s little huff of pleasure as he finally opens his eyes, and wild blue meet steady green.
Cas could almost believe it, believe that the kiss Dean places on his head is a promise of something better to come — but some part of his brain knows that this is not the right way. That this is not how you mend your broken pieces back together, no matter how hard you try or how good this feels.
When Cas lies back on top of him and finds his lips again, whimpering sweet nothing into his mouth, Dean feels like he’s going to explode.
Disclaimer — there's a quote from Jamie Tworkowski's in there. Kudos to you if you find it (and go read his book, it's one of my favorite).
Cas finishes his drink, thanks Balthazar, and makes his way home. It’s starting to get dark already and he has half an hour to figure out how the hell he’s going to tell Dean he invaded his privacy and basically read his diary.
If he could fly, Sam would probably be halfway across the globe right now. Instead, he just runs back to the war room, grabs the keys to his car, and leaves the bunker so fast one might think he’d got his skivvies in a bunch.
Thank you so much for your constant love and support for the past 17 chapters. As I'm used to saying, there would be no story if it wasn't for you guys.
Dean tucks himself back under the cover for a few minutes, waiting to see if his angel finds his way back to their room. His mind inevitably wanders to the few time this happened before, when Cas didn’t return until he went after him, and his stomach twists as the worry rise again, sour in his throat.
“I can’t believe you’re a Cosmo guy,” Dean says almost playfully as Cas starts preparing their cocktails.
“I’m sorry,” he finally says, his voice soft. “About the yelling, and what I said, and the broken plate. I’m so sorry.”
Dean nods with a weak smile, seemingly lost in thoughts as he looks around the room and starts putting things down, making the empty space his.
Dean lifts the paper bag and the coffee cup. “Charlie asked me to run an errand. Said you might need a pick me up.”
And then his brain catches a sniffle and the distinct sound of dial tones, and he turns on his heels, finally catching Cas… and takes in his appearance.
Cas seems to take the sound of his voice as queue to press even closer to him and even hooks a leg over his, half of his body resting on top of Dean and an arm slung over Dean’s middle. His breath is hot where it skitters on the skin of Dean’s neck, and Dean tries not to think too hard about how good it all makes him feel.
“Because I keep… You keep doing things and I keep discovering sides of you that I didn’t know, and I’ve known you for… What? A whole decade and even more?”
Dean doesn’t say anything at that for a long while. Cas knows he’s thinking about every single time his mom and dad fought, and how John made a point of being home less and less as time went by. And sure, Cas can see why Dean is making a connection here, but it’s nothing like what’s going on here.
Grief is like a trainwreck, it hits whenever it feels like it, punching you in the guts when it sees an opening. Dean didn’t expect to be hit by the equivalent of a truck right in the heart at 3 in the morning. But here he is, on the verge of tears, with Cas heavy and warm between his arms.
It takes a while until the papers are sorted. Teddy makes one final quick exam, urges Cas to stay put for at least a week, and they’re finally allowed to leave the turmoil of the Emergency Room. They’re walking through the last corridor before finally stepping outside in the fresh air, and it takes a lot out of Dean not to reach out to Cas, to weave their fingers together. To reassure himself that Cas is
“You look like you’re made for it, so gorgeous with those sinful lips of yours around my dick,” he says, knowing exactly what’s going to bring his boyfriend right over the edge. “And don’t get me started on how good you look once you’re covered with my come.”
It starts happening on a random morning, when Cas stumbles into the kitchen all grumpy and still sleepy, raven hair sticking in
He tries to ignore the pang of deception inside his chest- the crux of it all folded beneath his ribs, easy to forget- as he sits down in bed, covers pooling around his waist.
Dean shrugs, feeling a bit surprised that after a decade of observing Cas he never figured that out. “Alright. Well, finish your tea and we’ll head out, okay?”
“I swear to God if you tell me you’re not pushing people away I will ask Captain Lindberg to get me to Kansas and I will kick your ass myself, Winchester.”
It’s been three long years since I’ve left. I still hope, everyday, that you’re doing okay. That you’ve managed to rise again. Sometimes I awake at night and my first thought is always for you. This side of the world or the other, my first thought is always for you.
Dean chuckles, resists the urge to roll his eyes at Benny’s dramatic antics. “Alright, don’t get excited. I just have an appointment with my doctor at Little Creek tomorrow morning, and I forgot about it until this morning.”
It takes a while but Dean’s breath slowly evens out, and Cas patiently waits for him to settle down as he bathes into the warmth of his body against him. After all the shit they’ve been through, the days of stolen glances and awkward conversations, this feels like a fever dream.
“It’s not too bad, considering. I’m going to PT about three or four times a week. As for news, well… I’m living with a friend right now and my doctor wants me to wait until she clears me to find an actual job. So not much to do apart from concentrating on therapy.”
list. He rises to his feet and wraps Cas up in a tight hug, one hand still holding his drink while the other lightly pat his shoulder.
The stars are always there, but we miss them in the storm. We miss them in the rain, and in the fights, and in the doubts. We miss them in the dark, in the sleepless nights, in the ache of something once lost.
“A party,” Cas repeats patiently. “We could get Jess and Sam here, and Balt and Alicia. Obviously Charlie—,”
But Dean was always a beacon of hope to Cas. Even when things at home were terrible. Even when Dean and his brother landed at Bobby’s for a couple of months, he was always there to cheer Cas up.
“I know,” he starts, turning to watch Dean closely. “I actually- I stumbled upon this box months ago and uh… I read it. Actually, I don’t think I would’ve managed to talk to you on the deck that one night, the one we were talking about us before you moved away- if I hadn’t read these.”
“You too. Thanks for the coffee, the record, and the walk,” Cas says, his eyes lingering on the curve of Baby’s lines before he starts walking toward the apartment’s front door.
He needs him against him right now, he needs his weight on top of him, his mouths against his. He needs Cas to make him whole, to have him in every sense of the way.
“You okay?” Dean asks once they settle against each other, Cas’ face resting in the crook of Dean’s neck, a hand resting above Dean’s heart.
He quickly wonders if Dean’s made it to Virginia yet. He hasn’t heard from him, and he suspects he probably won’t until at least tomorrow. He refrains from grabbing his phone to send a quick text, enquiring about Dean’s whereabouts, because after last night he’s probably the last person Dean wants to hear about right now.
, Castiel,” the doctor grumbles, and Cas rolls his eyes. “Don’t give me that look, you’re lucky you’ve only got minor injuries. This could’ve gotten way worse.”
In all the mess, Sam and Balthazar stand out from where their sitting crossed-legged in the corner, apparently sorting out through all the mess that used to be next to the TV. The picture they make would be hilarious if it wasn’t for Cas’ worse-for-wear look as he clocks Dean entering the room.
. It used to be connected with hurt, to Dad getting angry and his hand falling heavy on me or Sam, and then apologizing. He’d say the words as if it could erase everything, as if telling your kids you love them could only be something attached to hurting them first.
Dean raises to sit, both his arms wrapped around Cas’ waist, his hands resting in the small of Cas’ back. Cas’ hands find their way onto Dean’s hair, threading through his dirty blond locks and tugging slightly, just the way he
“I don’t know who nailed this into your head, if it’s my fault or if Jimmy made you believe that this was somehow true, but this thing about you being hard to love? Too complicated? That is
Cas hates the relief that courses through his veins at that moment, realizing Benny is not romantically involved with Dean.
Cas’ hand moves higher on Dean’s thigh at that exact moment, making Dean turn his head to lock eyes with him while Sam explains what’s in both cocktails to Jack.
Dean ponders for half a second. Thinks back of the past two months, of waking up and aching for Cas. Of wondering if he’s ever going to feel good enough.
“Basically,” Benny says gently. “If he says yes, that means returning to the same schedule he had before his accident, with the addendum that he’d be leading the team as well. That means more responsibilities.”
Dean’s hand quickly cups Cas’ cheek as he wipes out a tear with his thumb. Cas’ breathes out at the touch, both of his hands resting on Dean’s chest as he closes his eyes.
“What did the bunker ever do to you?” he exclaims instead, purposely steering the conversation away.
He opens the door and his British friend is indeed standing in front of him. He’s dressed unusually conventional, with a pair of jeans and a red flannel instead of his usual black slacks and button-down.
He’s in his space suddenly, with his stupid sweatpants and his old Red Hot Chili Peppers shirt that may or may not be the one Dean gifted him during their Senior Year. With his stupid fucked up hair and his light stubble and his goddamn blue eyes shining like some kind of beacon for lost souls.
Balthazar is silent for an entire minute — which is a feat in itself. Cas observes quietly while sipping on his drink, trying to calm his nerves.
The other man closes his eyes on impact and pushes into the contact. Cas can’t resist and drops a soft kiss on his lips, just because he can.
. It also acts as a starting point for the story to start diving into heavier shit as we go, so please, please, please, check the trigger warnings before each chapter, and reach out if you feel like I might've forgotten anything.
Dean is setting up plates on the table when he says, “Do you think you’d manage to tell me anything about you at all?”
even after all this time. You’re still that same gentle soul that wants to do good by the people he cares about. Everything you do, it’s always out of concern, out of
“I’m clean. Haven’t had sex in months, but for what it’s worth I got tested a few weeks back at the hospital. Now get your ass over here, ‘cause I have a flight plan right now and it involves you.”
“He doesn’t. In fact, I don’t think I’ve heard him use any term of endearment towards anyone but you.”
“We’ll be fine, Dean,” he whispers slowly, gently, one of his hands running soothing circles over the fabric of the flannel Dean’s wearing.
It’s like he’s on autopilot mode then. He checks his phone once he’s behind the wheel — no text from Cas. It’s not like he didn’t expect it, but it’s still a ping directly to the heart.
“You’re beautiful,” he says slowly, enjoying the blush that appears at the praises on Dean’s cheek. “So beautiful for me, baby.”
Mostly because he wakes up curled around Dean, his head pillowed on his chest, legs tangled and arms wrapped around him like he’s afraid Dean would somehow bolt in his sleep — not that there would be many possibilities, seeing how much they’re both wrapped around each other. And it doesn’t feel surreal, they’re not pressed together by mistake, or because Cas wound up in Dean’s bed after a crisis. They’re here, wrapped around each other in Cas’ bed because they
It’s barely pushing 7 when Cas gets up and finds Dean hunched over the kitchen island making breakfast. The words tumble out of his mouth even before his brain processes, and it takes a lot out of him not to reach out to smooth the hurt he can see over Dean’s face for a flying second.
“I’m so sorry,” Jess says against him. “I thought I was doing something clever and nearly gave you a heart attack instead.”
I miss looking at the world through your eyes, where I would see nothing but beauty. You had a way of looking at things that made everything make sense, and there is so much about this perspective I miss. So much about you that I miss.
Dean’s mouth follows the curve of his jaw, nips at his ear before he gets down his neck and mouths along the line of his throat. His breath ghosts over his skin, sending goosebumps through every nerve and Cas briefly thinks that if he had to die from a heart attack right now that would most likely do it, and it would be
“Nightmare,” Dean says in response, barely a hoarse whisper as he burrows closer into Cas’ shirt, face entirely pressed up against his chest. “I was- back there. J-bad.”
Dean doesn’t know exactly what pulled him out of his slumber in the first place- he’s vaguely aware of a weight against him, of another body pressing next to him but that’s about as much as his exhausted mind can gather.
He brushes a kiss on his forehead as he leans back slightly to look at Cas, cupping his face between both hands, brushing a thumb along Cas’ cheekbones.
He doesn’t have to look at his brother to know he’s probably wearing that kicked puppy face, the silence that follows is heavy enough for him to know. After a few tense seconds, Jess breaks the ice tentatively.
“Someone — my roommate actually — walked in and stopped me before the call got picked up. He’s actually the reason I’m here this morning with you all.”
“No, I didn’t take any meds. It’s not physical. I just… I’m not entirely sure I can get up yet, that’s all.”
Balthazar seems a bit shaken up as Cas recalls the story quickly — Dean found him on the floor, called 911, then Jimmy. How Cas went into cardiac arrest and was revived by the paramedics on scene, in front of both his twin brother and his boyfriend. How Jimmy was beside his bed when he woke up, but not Dean.
The speed at which Michael flies towards Castiel is unseeable to the human eye. Castiel himself catches glimpses of it in bursts- his wings burst from his back with violent force and gore on instinct, much less elegant than Michael’s. Black bones, black feathers, black veins, black black black and charred by Hellfire. He moves just in time to dodge Michael’s attack, his six wings carrying him away in a tornado of dandelion fuzz and leaves. He hasn’t felt his power surge like this in years, but he still worries it isn’t enough to match Michael, an archangel.
Inside the hospital room, Dean’s propped up in bed with a mountain of pillows behind him. As Castiel enters he sees Sam dive onto his brother, bury his face in his chest, and squeeze him tightly. Pain flashes over Dean’s features but he doesn’t tell Sam to get off, instead wrapping one arm around his shoulders and lifting the hand with the finger monitor on it to brush through his long hair. There’s gauze wrapped around his head and an IV in his other hand, but overall he looks alright.
Castiel weighs Dean’s question thoughtfully, and when he replies, his words are careful. “I want to know the whole story.”
"I accept your apology," Dean says. Michael visibly relaxes. "But I'm not sure… what you want. You can't possibly want to- to
Sighing, Benny grips Castiel’s bicep. “Brother, I’ll tell ya til’ I’m blue in the face: this ain’t your fault. None of it is. Not knowing he’s eighteen, bringin’ him home to his drunk daddy, him bein’ a prostitute or any of that. It ain’t. Your. Fault. And I’ll tell y’again: he’s damn lucky you were there to call the police when you knew something was wrong.”
“Game Nights” are ridiculous. Castiel doesn’t even hide his displeasure at their apartment turning into a zoo when Dean’s friends and brother come over. Food, games, the television
“Well buddy you gave me eight reasons and two thumbs not to trust you,” Dean reflexively says, some of his old defensive sarcasm breaking through his carefully built walls.
Castiel straightens and closes the fridge, opening the freezer. There’s fresh meat packaged neatly next to his TV dinners, and his eyes bounce between the two with indecision.
“Not that kind of talk,” she says softly. They get into the car, Dean wishing she had cushy seats instead of the weird leather stuff. He’s still in his gym clothes and his skin is sticking to the seats uncomfortably. She doesn’t start the car. He turns his head to look at her, curious and confused. “Well- sort of like that. Do you… do you know what being gay is, Dean?”
“You don’t want to assemble a crib when you can’t get up off of the floor on your own?” Castiel asks idly, thumbing through the swatches.
The changing leaves reminds him of her hair, the swirling skies of her eyes. When it rains he thinks of her curled up with a book in front of the fireplace, and when the sun shines he thinks of her covered in dirt in the yard, planting bulbs to bloom in the spring.
“Alright, well the cliffnotes is that I’m the Righteous Man and you’re the Guardian Angel.” Castiel opens his mouth to interject, but Dean cuts him off. “Look, we can’t get into semantics right now. God’s dead and when he tossed our asses something reset and Michael came back from where we threw
“Dude, he’s never interviewed before. He’s iced everyone out. Last I read he’s attending some fancy lawyer college in California and basically pretends like his brother isn’t locked up in maximum security.”
“Release,” Castiel repeats flatly. “I did the research on your case, Mr. Winchester. You were found guilty on all accounts. Your DNA placed you at every scene of the crime, and eye witnesses tie you to the scenes. You didn’t resist arrest when they came for you.”
Softening a little, Dean reaches out to punch Kevin gently on the shoulder. “I really appreciate that, man. I-” he scratches his throat idly, looking down at his lap where the box of makeup sits. “I dunno why I like it, but… it makes me feel good.”
Castiel’s heart grows heavy. “Not only is he in the hospital and about to press charges against his own father, he’s now out of a job.” His fingers fidget with the lining of his pockets. Dropping his voice, he turns his eyes towards Benny, moving in closer to keep their conversation private. “He… he told me he was a prostitute, Benny. What if he turns to that again?”
. I was just a kid. Didn’t know what I wanted.” He puts his elbow on the table and rests his chin on his clean hand, turning his gaze out the sliding back door to Castiel’s neatly manicured lawn. “I kinda feel a little overwhelmed with the freedom.”
In the kitchen there’s a fresh pot of coffee on the counter. The clock on the oven says 6:37AM and Dean hates that he feels so good for being up so early. They didn’t get in until after one. Dean hasn’t even checked his phone. The latest he can get away with getting home without being detected is around eight, mostly because it’s easy to sneak into his basement room.
fun fact: this is the very first segment i wrote of this story. the rest of the story was built around this very chapter. the beginning scene was stuck in my head for
Letting out a little sigh, Dean turns a small smile towards Charlie, elbow deep in soap. He only buses when he’s frustrated and has to step away from customers, and Charlie knows this well. “I’ll be fine. Just gotta keep away from him before Cas fires me for serving him cold soup or somethin’.”
“It’s not because of you.” He finally says. “Bobby was right. At my age I want to settle down, not casually date. But the more people I meet, the more I realize that perhaps… I’m not meant to be in another relationship.”
The momentary distraction costs him when Michael grabs his ankle and swings him like a shot put. He sails a quarter of a mile before righting himself, wings flapping, but as soon as he’s straight Michael is in his space, sending his fist to the softness under Castiel’s chin, cracking his neck and jerking his head back. Blood fills his mouth, his vision blurring slightly. Michael grips the lapels of his suit jacket, swinging him around again, this time hurtling him towards the earth below.
you'd be in hot water. But seein' as this is an unrelated incident, there's nothing to investigate at the bar. He worked off the books, tips-only. If he leaves now no one's the wiser. Not gonna lie, Cas. Gotta save my ass, too. I like that idiot too much for him to get in trouble for just tryna live."
“This is a safe place for you to express yourself,” Castiel reminds Dean gently. He takes a step back. “You deserve all of the goodness you receive.”
Dean had told his dad he wanted to quit wrestling, and his dad grumbled “s’long a you pick somethin’ that keeps you offa your ass”; so, satisfied, Dean joined the cross country team. Running was super boring at first. Also he sucked at it. Long distance and Dean were apparently not friends. But he practiced more, and Kevin was also on the team, and eventually running became… cathartic. Weird.
Shaking his head, Dean pulls back slightly to grip Castiel’s hands tightly, smiling sheepishly. “You were right, Cas. Look- I’m sorry I’m such a dumb kid. I think I’ve got life figured out and then I just… fuck up, y’know? And I’m pretty used to fuckin’ up but I think this time I managed to learn a lesson.”
“I…” Dean says slowly. “...figured I would stay here. Or also go to Bobby n’ Ellen’s, with Sammy.” That sounds right.
Dean can’t help but snort, some blood spurting out of his tissue-stuffed nostrils and landing on his shirt. Trevor. That’s worse than
“Mrs. Winchester,” the principal sends her a tired look, “Trevor is in his final year of school and has a record as long as my arm. It’s my leniency that has allowed him to cause so much trouble. He will be expelled. From here he can go on to get his GED and still lead a regular academic career if he chooses to go to college.”
Clenching his jaw a few times, he lets out a sigh and closes his book on his finger. “You have to understand my hesitation, Dean. Many people already misconstrue our relationship.”
“I’ve gotten really good,” the other boy says wryly. He sits directly across Dean, so close their knees touch. He opens up the shoebox to reveal all sorts of makeup- way more than Dean’s ever seen on his mom’s vanity.
Bobby says, “Electric carving knives,” which, judging by the laughter, is the thing he’s thankful for every year.
The only reason he'd even tried his luck at a strip joint was because it would be in the same vein of work, but safer. Cleaner. Still shitty but at least somewhat comfortable. Better than motels and gross back alleys. All of the dancers in that club were a joke, anyway. Dean watched them. They could bump to a beat but aside from awesome flexibility, none of them were that great.
Their laughter dies when they see their dad parked in a space that isn’t even a parking spot, pacing back and forth in front of the car. When he sees them he darts forward, the look on his features that of a haunted man.
Ah, fuck. Castiel, the hot straight widower who knows pain that no human should know, wife and unborn child gone. Castiel, possibly an ex-priest given Dean’s keen intuition and some of the stuff he says in passing. Castiel, with a past Dean really doesn’t know anything about but can see the weight of in his eyes, on his shoulders.
There it is. The dreaded question. The one that can change someone’s view about you in one single word. Dean had to face it a handful of times, but it doesn’t even come close to how terrified he is that Cas might see him differently after his answer.
“Oh. Sam, huh? Well, that’s nice. Did he tell you anything else, or did you lose the ability to think for yourself while you were running around waving a gun in your hand for the sake of this country?”
He heard quiet shuffling as Rowena was moving about, but didn't pay much attention to it. The searing pain in his arm kept him from dozing off entirely, even though his body had surpassed the state of exhaustion a while ago. So he just let his thoughts drift behind closed eyes, void of coherence.
"Leave us!" she barked before the demon could even speak to announce the visitors. As soon as the gates closed behind every demon that had been in the room before, Rowena's poise flaked away like dry leaves. She crossed the room, stopping just a few steps away, eyes wide and unguarded as she took in each of them. "I thought you were
No counter-attack happened. Roderick just stared at him in silence for a moment, then slowly sat up and dusted off his jacket. If he'd been lying, then surely the demon would have taken this chance to just kill Jack? It was all true, then. It had to be. A floodgate opened up inside of him, sweeping away any remaining doubts in a wave of relief so intense, Jack didn't even know what was happening until he had already flung himself at Roderick in a full-body embrace.
Rowena's book was laying open on the table, but Sam apparently didn't have to look at it for some freakish reason. The language wasn't even Latin for this variant of the spell and Dean would never not be impressed to hear the strange words float off Sam's tongue as if they belonged there, to see the purple glow erupt from his brother's hands, opening a rift right there in an open space in their library.
Unable to follow this way any further if they wanted to avoid this second group of guards, Sam and Rowena split up to try the doors on both sides of the hallway. Sam's hand closed around a doorknob, turned it as quietly as it was possible in the rush he was in, but found the door locked. Rowena seemed to be in the same predicament. The third door Sam tried finally gave in and opened up the way into a vacant chamber without any windows or other exits.
"Samuel." The other voice quivered and broke side by side with his own, and the hands cradling his face traveled downwards. His jawline was trailed by the weightless touch of fingertips. The last thing he expected was the press of lips to his own, too gentle for the smoldering pile of ash that remained of his life. Lasting no longer than a couple of seconds, the contact still sufficed to startle his sobs into silence.
With a tired sigh, Dean halted in his pacing to stare out the window, a play of light and shadow on his face when lightning flashed again. He let the fingers of his left hand run over the small white pearls he wore on his other arm, gently tugging the bracelet around his wrist.
Rowena lifted one shoulder in a shrug. "We had to get out of the palace, and this is the only part of Hell where they cannot easily follow us."
Then one of the demons was thrown off his chest and it took him a moment to realize that this hadn't been his own doing, but Sam's. The hunter and the demon were grappling on the floor near his feet and Jack remembered the blade he was holding. He tightened his grip on it and made another one of his attackers fizzle out of existence. The third one was still keeping him pressed to the floor, not giving him a chance to get back to his feet.
Sam shook his head in something that would have been amusement if his emotions weren't feeling as dried out as his body. The numbness was probably a good thing. He sat up a little straighter, wincing at the pain in his arm and trying his hardest not to think of anything at all. It didn't take long until Rowena returned with a second serving of water in her hands—no shoe involved—which he accepted gratefully.
Ooookay then, I am writing a story that makes decisions on its own without asking me for permission, and apparently it's also in the bible. Nothing to see here, folks, move along. (How creeped out should I be?)
He held it over the unlit candle, but nothing happened. Frowning, he shook the box gently and heard a rattling sound from inside, in time with the clatters of the hailstones against the roof. The cone from Roderick's flashlight shot over to Jack's hands. He saw Roderick close his eyes and wondered if demons could feel tired.
"That's, uh—I'm just saying, that's an odd stance for someone who used to rule the place until two days ago."
"You'll still be in control for most of it. I won't harm you, you have my word!" Castiel shouted, his voice small and forlorn in the haze.
Dean moved quickly through the darkness towards the voice to pull the boy into a hug, the afterimage of an orange glow still in his eyes. "You are staying out of fights from now on, you hear me? 'Least until we get to train you some more on human combat."
"It's the thing again, isn't it?" Sam asked, finally letting the mistreated scarf fall back to his chest. "The one Dad refuses to talk about?"
"And the way you did it, a blade from behind! Of the two of us, I thought you were the honorable one."
Rowena smiled and Sam returned it. It was an involuntary reaction that his body remembered how to do, muscle memory so ingrained that it could still function even though there was no happiness to be found here at the end of the world. He saw the darkness he felt reflected in Rowena's eyes, just as unaffected by the notion of mirth as his own must be looking.
In the face of Dean's verbal equivalent of a whiplash, even Sam budged and complied. As soon as the door closed and the seatbelt clicked, the car sped back the way it had come from in reverse. In front of them, Castiel saw the center of the storm front brewing in a cone of darkness.
How on earth was he supposed to explain to his brother what was happening when he himself barely had a grasp on it, had felt like reality was sliding through his fingers ever since their whole world had exploded?
Jack was stunned into silence, but his face must have spoken all the words he couldn't say, judging by the way Roderick squinted up at him.
He listened into himself for the doubt he should have found there. But the doubt was locked away in that box, together with everything else. This was probably too soon, but then again, 'soon' pretty much lost its meaning when time itself was about to end. They could have this, here, now. It felt right.
What was a god anyway, considering all the information they had now? Why were Amara and Chuck equals, but with opposite domains? Why was it Light and Darkness? And why was Light currently trying to wipe out life itself while Darkness had been an ally to them before they had screwed that up?
A wordless scream left his lips, channeling the rage buried deep inside of him over a derailed life that was so rarely under his own control. It set into motion a desperately hatched emergency plan to draw the attention from Jack back to himself. The trails of smoke that had been moving away from him actually paused at the perceived sound of Sam's breaking point.
Sam cleared his throat. "Yeah, and I also left some money for this family on the desk. So it's more of a... purchase now."
Dean watched the movement of the nearest wall, the twisting shapes inside of it that always withdrew before they were fully formed. Castiel had to push away the memory of being one of them with a shuddering intake of breath.
Sam gasped awake to the sound of shattering glass, but he couldn't tell if that had been a nightmare. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and found himself entirely disoriented. Not only had he never seen this room before in his life, the gray light falling in through the shuttered windows had such an odd quality to it that he had no idea what time of day it was.
"Rowena, listen to me." Sam grabbed both of her hands, uncurling her fists in the attempt to stop her from descending even deeper into that spiral of her personal despair, his own misery forgotten for the moment.
He could only just find the presence of mind to shift back over into the Veil right as both brothers turned towards the source of the ear-splitting noise and blinding glow that they'd probably attribute to the lightning bolt. Causing harm to their eyesight was far from his intentions. Dean seemed thoroughly distracted squinting up into the sky with a peculiar expression on his face, but Sam pulled him out of harm's way, further under the roof and into the building.
And now Dean was—gone. Probably dead. The idea was too big to grasp. Sam's body twitched, strained against the bonds that held him as the knife dug deeper. Dean had always been there, the roots of a comfort he'd known since childhood. No matter what nightmare their lives turned into, Dean had been there—but no longer. That knowledge was unbearable. Sam was in free fall, swallowed by a dark abyss with teeth made of pain and broken hopes.
"Because," Dean said, weirdly calm. "Earth is already screwed if we don't do something. It's time to get desperate."
The power from the hallway surged up again, more insistently this time, testing the strength of the barrier. They spent a held breath staring at the flame pattern burning down almost entirely before coming back to life much weaker than before.
"I couldn't save anybody," Sam whispered, drawing another new shade of pain into the room. "They're gone... everyone's gone. It's just us now."
Cast out, locked away in the shadowed areas between the windows in the deepest part of the dungeon to be forgotten, to spare the majority of angels the shame that your mere presence would cause. The one and only being still remembering your existence would be the torturer on their daily visits.
Cas closes his eyes, a smile grazing his lips and warmth expanding through his chest where Dean’s hands are tracing nonsensical patterns.
He doesn’t know how long he stays there, watching the back of Cas’ head as he pointedly ignores Dean. He looks just like any other day, his jeans hugging him in all the right places, the flannel that he’s wearing no doubt one of Dean’s.
“Y-yes, I’m okay. I’m sorry I almost scalded you with my coffee,” he manages to stutter as Dean picks up the box from the floor and hands it back to him.
Dean finishes his coffee in silence as Cas turns his attention back to his computer and his article. When he rises to his feet announcing that he’s going back to bed and that “he should too.” Cas does nothing but plaster a soft smile on his face.
There’s mirth in Dean’s eyes, and Cas knows they’re headed for a merciless battle. Not that he has any complaints.
Dean smiles at him in the darkness, tracing a path with the pad of his thumb across Cas’ cheekbone, watching as he lays on his back before leaning down for a kiss. Cas frames his face between both of his hands, gently brushing his thumbs along the line of Dean's stubbled jaw as they kiss languidly, before following Dean’s movement as he dips lower and lower and
Cas usually prides himself for his patience and understanding (key word being ‘usually’, in that case).
Truth be told, Jimmy almost backs down the minute he sees Cas. Both he and Dean had fallen asleep in their seats waiting for a doctor to come find them when Cas would be awake and responsive. It was bordering 6 AM when one finally did, and only Jimmy had been allowed to come see his brother for now as part of the “Family Only” policy of the hospital.
The cold winter air hits Jimmy in the face. An icy north wind that renders his hands and nose numb as he walks down the street to Gallagher’s. It’s the middle of February and the entire town of Lawrence has been wrapped in a blanket of snow for the past week, a reminder that winter is particularly rough this year. It’s Saturday and Jimmy has been working all day long in a fast-food downtown. It’s shit but it pays pretty well, and God knows they need the money right now.
“I don’t want you to stop because of me,” Cas finally says with a voice so tiny that Dean barely recognizes it, his gaze down on Dean’s chest.
“Not much. I remember the claws on my back and being tossed across the room. And then I remember you driving me here, pulling me into the tub. Falling asleep. That’s pretty much it.”
Jess has been a part of the family for 6 years already, and despite not having seen each other in real life as much as they should have (Dean’s schedule was hectic, but combined with Jess and Sam’s, it was almost impossible to find some free time to get together — god bless technology for all the video calls). They’ve managed to develop enough of a meaningful relationship for them to get along like a house on fire. Sam pretends he hates it, but Dean knows he secretly loves it.
, Dean answers playfully, very satisfied with the light moan that comes out Castiel’s mouth once he mouths at his earlobe,
I know I write about you more than I should, I know it’s unhealthy. I guess it’s because I don’t allow myself to talk about you, to let your name leave my lips. But I know eventually I need to find a way to let you go. I know it’s impossible to heal while my bones are weighted with longing.
Castiel’s hand slips into Dean’s hair, carding softly through the dirty blonde locks as Dean breathes against him.
But right now tightly wrapped into Dean’s arms, his body pressed against Dean’s, he doesn’t find the energy to care about any of it. Instead, he finds Dean’s hand and laces their fingers together.
Cas’ heart breaks a little more at the vulnerability he can feel loaded into each of Dean’s words. He holds on a little tighter, burrows a little closer into the warmth of Dean’s neck and closes his eyes for an instant as he listens to the low rumble of Dean’s voice.
He knows it’s only coming from a place of shitty self-esteem and fear, that Dean has no intention of taking Cas away from him. But being 4-month free of 16 years of a very shitty life doesn’t erase the trauma that goes along with it, especially when you’ve spent that entire time trying to keep your brother safe. Everyone used to be the enemy. Jimmy loves Dean, but he’s having more and more trouble figuring out if he’s a friend or an enemy when it comes to Cas’ drug use.
In front of him, Cas’ face twists into a small smile, the strains of tears on his cheeks still visible as the dull light of dawn starts illuminating the room. The rain is still falling, its rhythm still steady but quieter. Dean’s nose brushes against Cas’, one of his hands removing the hair that flopped on his forehead and smoothing them back tenderly. Cas’ eyes close as Dean brushes a kiss on his cheek softly.
of you. We’re retiring. Together. Because we’re old and we have a life that’s worth more than dying because of a werewolf. Okay?”
“I didn’t want to break the mood. We were having a good time, I didn’t want you to be sad. Or pissed at me.”
Castiel is the one who typically handles their mail, solely because Jimmy’s schedule between his shifts doesn’t always allow him to run around doing errands. But for obvious reasons, Jimmy couldn’t slip the letter addressed to Dean in their stack of stuff to post like he usually does with his regular mail.
,” Dean laughs, getting out of Benny’s embrace and picking his bag up. “Come on, let’s get this show on the road.”
“I’ve been thinking about what you and Charlie said yesterday and… well you’re right. It’s not like I’ve got something to lose. We’re already apart, so the only way this can go is up, not  down.”
“I know where you hide the key, dumbass. I would’ve just crashed for the night and you would’ve never known.”
He left Virginia right after his appointment, seeing no reason to stay longer since the entire team was still on the OP they’d been called for after their bar meet up. Dean had stopped for the night in Kentucky, just deciding to make the 20 hours drive without stopping.
“Okay. I’m happy to hear you say it. Now I’d like to go back to the part where you opened a letter that was very obviously not addressed to you.”
The answer to his text comes in less than a minute, and Dean’s heart makes a back-flip inside his chest.
“Dean, will you fucking listen to me,” Cas all but yells, his hand on Dean’s shoulder fisting his shirt and bringing him closer in front of him. “You’re not going to the fucking convenience store.”
“I know, sweetheart,” Dean says with a smile as Cas turns to look at him, both arms wrapped around his knees. “We’re way past that right now anyway. Come here.”
He’s not sure if his arousal rising in spikes at the sight is a good thing, but that’s probably a subject for later.
Jimmy can’t even look at him. His baby brother, lying on a shitty bathroom floor, in the middle of the night, in the worst part of town. Almost already gone.
Benny’s mouth stretches into a thin smile, his gaze leaving Cas for a while to rest on the water down below.
It takes him roughly 20 minutes to get from his place to Charlie’s coffee shop. Once he does he barely registers the environment, only making his way to the counter to order his usual out of habit.
“But —,” Cas starts but Dean cuts him off. If he let Cas speak, he’s just not going to go through with this.
All of this shit started with Jimmy lying to them and Dean walking away because of it, and now Dean is going to leave again? Dean is going to leave him behind to go back to running into crossfires and potentially
Christmas is just a few days away when Dean parks the car in the airport’s parking lot before he strides through the arrivals hall to wait for Cas. It’s been a little bit more than 3 months since their goodbyes, and Dean’s heart remains in his throat all that time.
Most days I hold your name on my breath, but say nothing. Because to speak it is to attach weight to my throat; to hear the sound of a broken wing beating. Some days, to speak anything at all is to remember what it was to be a grown, growing thing. To remember who I was before you.
“It should have been his choice, Jimmy!! You stripped it away from him! Not to mention that you not only broke his heart, you quite literally fucked him up for good.”
. Waking up in Dean’s arms, despite feeling like every dream he’s had for years feels like being on literal fire.
“Thanks Char. Nothing’s done yet, though. Maybe I just won’t ever be able to overcome all that shit and I’ll stay with you until we’re old and fat and owner of too many cats.”
Yet here he is, curled up on his brother’s couch after spending all day effectively hiding from everyone.
“You did the right thing calling us,” she tells Dean, her black hair shining weirdly under the strobing blue light of the ambulance. “A couple of minutes later would have been too late. You got lucky, finding him this quick.”
Dean finally turns to look at him, green honey eyes starring right at him in the obscurity of the night and the comfort of the Impala. There’s a shadow of a smile on his lips as he comes closer and kisses the angel softly like it’s just a normal thing to do.
I guess my point here is, I don’t want you and Cas to live a lie anymore. I don’t want to hold this secret that’s been poisoning the three of us for so long close to my chest. I don’t want to go to bed every night wondering how would our lives could’ve turned out if I hadn’t been so stupid and selfish. I want to see you again. I want Cas to know that you didn’t give up on him, that the only asshole in this story is me. Even if it means he’ll hate me for the rest of our lives. I want you to know that Cas loved you so much, and he still probably does. I want you to know that you still have a home here, with us.
Before he changes his mind, Dean reaches for his phone inside his pocket and hands it to Cas. The other man eyes him carefully, half a smile on his face as he seemingly types his number on Dean’s phone. There’s a slight ringtone half a second later, indicating that he shot himself a text to have Dean’s number saved inside his phone as well.
Dean’s breath is warm against the line of his neck and Cas keeps scrolling like he gives two fuck about his Instagram timeline — he doesn’t, not really. Not when Dean is pressed
He doesn’t answer, keeps his eyes closed. Until Dean’s voice cuts through his thoughts again, soft and grounding.
to know. How much Jimmy poisoned his life with a choice he made on a whim, terrified. How Jimmy was planning on telling him, on telling Dean. How he begged for them to forgive him, hoped for them to fix what he had broken. He deserves to know that Jimmy only wanted to protect them and that he clumsily made a mistake that ended up breaking all of them apart. He deserves the catharsis of knowing the truth, of allowing redemption to the other person he loves the most.
“Why are you crying?” he asks softly, raising a hand to thumb at his cheek, wiping the wet strike away. “Don’t, please.”
And as Cas kisses him like there’s no tomorrow, Dean lets out a breath he didn’t even know he was still holding.
Dean scoffs, looking down his feet. “No, no. We’re sharing a place. Things are… I don’t know. We’re… friends, I guess.” He shakes his head in disbelief. “I don’t know.”
He woke up from a drug-induced coma 2 weeks after with a titanium hip in lieu of his left hip, a big part of the left side of his body marked forever by a stupid explosive device, and his whole career shattered to pieces.
Cas' head is swimming into the memory of Dean’s hands, Dean’s skin, Dean’s lips moving against his. And for the first time in a long time, this morning doesn’t seem so dreadful anymore.
“So- um. I realize I should probably have asked before doing this,” Cas said, apologetic as he slowly started walking towards Dean after petting Holli, who gleefully followed him close behind.
It’s always been like this with Cas. It’s in the moments he’s the most vulnerable that he lets go, and even after all this time it’s no different. Dean turns his head just enough to brush a kiss against the bolt of his jaw, his thrusts starting to grow erratic as he approaches his own climax.
“Well I thought you were him, hence why I came outside. But… I have no idea where he is. He’s not picking up either.”
“This can’t be happening,” Dean laughs bitterly, looking up at the sky as so many mixed emotions fill him. “After all of this? After the offer, the promise of me finishing my career behind a desk? How they treated me? And now they want me
It’s a nice summer night, the sky is clear enough for Castiel to see the stars from where he’s lying on the grass. The buzz of the city slowly dies down as the minute goes by, and Cas enjoys every second of it.
Cas nods, carefully trying to avoid looking at him in the eyes for too long as he starts sipping on his coffee. It’s insane how good he looks, and Dean mentally has to smack himself because the poor guy is grieving, he shouldn’t be allowed to think about this.
Dean chuckles sadly, and a sharp thrill rings through Cas’ entire body. This is a voice that he hasn’t heard for a long time. The one he would have whenever he’d find Cas high, or after a fight. This is Dean’s breakdown voice, and it’s
“So when Jimmy told me that you didn’t want to see me anymore? That you somehow decided that we shouldn’t be together anymore? I didn’t question it. My brain immediately went “
He made his way to him instead, sank to his knees and held him close as Cas broke down in tears. A mixture of “
As part of his therapy, he resumes going to the range a week after he settled at Charlie’s. Sam and Bobby come along, and after an initial period of adaptation, Dean feels confident enough to knock it out of the park and put 5 bullets in the chest of his target, earning a whistle from Bobby.
Dean and Cas have very different ways of dealing with the secret they've unraveled last chapter. Dean runs, like he's been doing for 10 years. Cas crumbles to his feet and battles to stay above water. Can they meet in the middle?
Cas wrote him a letter, knowing Dean has been having a hard time balancing work and life, knowing he’s been beating himself up about not spending enough time with him.
Cas nods, a smile on his face. It’s actually kind of insane how fond he grew of Benny in only 5 days.
When Dean steps back just by a hair, there’s a part of Cas that immediately senses the shift in his demeanor, from the way his shoulders almost guiltily set to the glint in his eyes when they find his.
It’s so good it hurts in all the places that haven’t really healed, all the spaces that his absence has carved out into his bones, where his fingers used to find their place easily. Dean’s hands are on him, finding their way under his shirt and he wants it, wants more. Wants to feel every sweep of hands and every bite of teeth on his skin.
Cas hates that he loves it. Dean is still out of reach most of the time. If only he cut the crap with his
“It’s a 24-weeks-course. It’s divided into 5 distinct parts. You’ve got orientation first, which is 3 weeks, and was formerly known as Indoctrination. I think the name speaks for itself.”
he was. By the time he reaches the end of his first day there and as he barrells through his hotel room and falls face down into the -desperately empty- bed, he’s already reaching for his phone and punching Dean’s number in.
Jimmy bites his tongue. He can’t blurt it out like that when Cas is very obviously at his lowest. It’ll only do more damage.
Dean doesn’t know what he looks like, but judging by the journey Cas’ face goes through while looking at him, he’d have a few guesses as to why he looks so stunned.
“Okay, come on now. I just… I just want one day to think about it. I’m not saying I’m going to say yes, I’m not saying anything at that point. I just- I wanted my coffee and a couple of hours to figure out what the hell I want to do with this. I wanted a hug and a kiss from my boyfriend, I wanted to discuss this with you.”
“I saw him on the floor, I saw the paramedics cracking his chest to try and bring him back. I saw him dead, and I didn’t know what to do. I thought Dean might have been involved in Cas getting so wasted in drugs, and then I understood once he was gone that I was deeply wrong. I know-”
He’s just tired. Tired that everyone seems to be okay with keeping stuff away from him. So instead of saying anything more, instead of yelling or cursing Charlie for enabling this lie to go on even longer, he just sits there and watches her in disbelief. Even tuning out what she’s saying because he cannot for the love of
“I wanted to talk to you, you know?” Dean says, taking the glass to his lips. “Every day during training, after my first OP, or during my first deployment… every time, I thought of you and how badly I wanted to talk to you.”
“I mean whenever I get down, I don’t know how to get back up, and it’s eating at me. I thought I had it all under control but then… Sometimes it just feels like I’m swimming in a bowl and there’s no way out.”
Cas checks his phone an unhealthy amount of time on his way to his therapy appointment. Unfortunately, Dean still hasn’t answered his text when he makes it to the therapist’s office, and Cas really tries not to overthink it. Dean isn’t usually on his phone much, but he’s probably even less on his phone right now knowing Benny’s with him. But it does hurt to see the little text, those four words staying unanswered. Cas tells himself that this is what he gets for not returning them right away in the first place when he tucks his phone away before his session.
It’s an old code between the two of them, one that dates back to Dean’s first date and countless of mishaps that lead to both Sam and Dean walking on each other’s while in bed with someone.
“You can stay,” Dean cuts him off, the hand that was on Cas’ thigh suddenly making its way to his waist, both arms wrapping around him.
Dean’s eyes close again and Cas goes as far as stroking a thumb over the line of his cheekbone before they open again.
“Hey, I’ve been trying to reach you for 10 minutes. I’m just out at lunch with Jessica and,” he scratches his neck, cursing himself for being uncomfortable over the goddamn
“When I relapsed… I was in such a bad shape, Dean. I wasn’t eating, I wasn’t seeing the light of day, I wasn’t seeing
There’s a couple of things about Dean that drives Castiel insane. Some of those always have- the way he smiles in the morning when he’s not completely awake yet, how he hums into a surprise kiss, or the way his eyes crinkle when he laughs. Some of those are new, because in the 10 years they’ve spent apart Dean has grown and evolved, like they all did. And so the way he laughs is different, more carefree somehow. The way he’ll spend an hour explaining a movie plot that Cas has no care about whatsoever (and he knows it) only because he likes seeing the little scrunch in-between his eyebrows when he doesn’t understand half the plot of Captain America. His voice when he talks French for no reason, or even the way his fingers curl into Cas’ shirt when he pulls him in for a kiss at any given moment.
They’re making their way to security when he finally grabs Cas by the sleeve of his jacket and stops him on his track. The other man looks at him curiously, one eyebrow raised and his signature head tilt.
Benny smiles around the neck of his beer bottle, eyeing him in that special way he has to tell Dean he knows he’s bullshitting.
Dr. Moseley had been his therapist right after his overdose over 11 years back, and had helped him navigate the ups and downs of addiction. She also knew all about Cas’ struggles regarding his relationship with Dean, and had been a great support for him to start moving on. When he came back a few weeks ago she welcomed him with open arms, almost picking up where they had left off all those years ago, and was thrilled to know that Dean and Cas had made their way back to each other. She helped them navigate this new relationship, assisting Cas in dealing with his trauma and his fears, and so far it had been a true change in his relationship with Dean.
Actions spoke louder than words. All she could hope to do now, after Castiel had met his final demise, was protecting that which he had treasured above all—protect it in his name, in the name of the world, in the name of all that was right. She had chosen to do exactly that, had grabbed the hope Dean Winchester had extended towards her and brought it to full bloom.
"And I've always wanted to use one of those things. They have a certain style, you know? Great for dramatic plot twists."
Known that all orders had been nothing but random, that there was no plan, known that their loving father was nothing but a farce. Her purpose could have been renewed, she could have lent her strength to a cause truly worth it.
It wasn't a question. Roderick narrowed his eyes as if it had been an insult. Jack swallowed, feeling bad for having said the wrong thing—again—even though he really didn't understand why anyone would be offended by this. In an attempt to fix it, he added, "I know what it's like to be different, to feel like you never fit in."
"Rowena," he repeated her name quietly and let go of her hands to pull her into an embrace instead. "You're the living proof that change is real."
Dean took a few deep breaths, regaining his composure enough to continue. "Here's the thing. None of you deserve that crap. Yes, we've all done horrible stuff. You, me, Sam, C...—we all have. And we all wish we could just take it back, undo it somehow, but we can't. And I sure as hell know that we'll never forgive ourselves for what we've done. But we can forgive each other. That's what family is for. And Jack, you always have been family.
Sam rubbed his hands over his face, blinking in a manner that indicated he also had troubles with adjusting to reality—only that his reason was the far simpler one of having been torn out of sleep too abruptly. The sight of his brother's bleary eyes was familiar to Dean after countless Code Red missions where they had dragged themselves over an airfield in the middle of the night, the shadowed remains of nightmares still clinging to them. He wished this new world could have made things easier, for both of them.
There was just a soft swirling sensation in his chest, but nothing else. It was insane how much he longed to hear a clueless question, a sarcastic remark, something. Anything.
Sam pushed his way out of the car roughly, giving way to a gush of cold air blowing in through the open door. Once outside, Sam stood in the middle of the road lined by desolate fields. His head was tilted back as he stared up at the cover of clouds, enormous mountains of a gray so dark it was a warning in itself, smothering what little daylight remained. If Castiel truly was a banshee, he couldn't have come up with a more obvious portent.
That garnered him another eyeroll as the witch got back to her feet, but he was sure he also saw a thin smile before she turned to leave.
Something crumbled inside of him, tore at his insides in a way the knife never could. Everything he'd kept so carefully contained these last few days broke free. A wail grew deep inside his chest, violently escaped when steel met flesh another time. His vision went blurry to thoughts of Eileen. He could barely see the smile on the face of the demon who cut into his shoulder.
He took special care to bury the fact that he had been unable to see the exit after entering the Empty. Cas really didn't need any of that right now. It was maddening not to have any other way of helping him back to his former strength, to even just do something as simple as give him a smile of encouragement.
Sam cleared his throat awkwardly, lifted the arm that Jack wasn't holding onto, then pushed it forwards in a determined movement.
They ended up in a messy heap in the middle of an onion field, the flaming rift the only light source in the darkness of night. Dean's fingers still refused to let go of the reassuring fabric they were clinging to and he nodded towards the rift, breathing heavily. "Close it! Can you close it?"
"Thus spake the Lord, those who disobey shall be punished. And Dean Winchester, the ultimate killer, had one last moment to repent before drawing his last breath."
he replied in relief to the voice he had deemed lost forever. Slightly surprised by the change of language, he followed where his old friend led, but withdrew his grace to let it hover at the outmost border of the violet light.
Despite Dean's penchant for exaggerations, his assessment of the situation was, in fact, quite accurate. Their motoric abilities were under Dean's control and that was a good thing. Castiel was still disoriented and struggled to get used to the connection with a human body again, even though he remembered how much at home he had come to feel in his own vessel. Carefully, he nudged Dean aside just the smallest bit to take in a deep breath. It was strangely unsatisfactory in the Empty, no comparison at all to having a body on Earth.
been incarcerated for wronging them all, for following the lure of a trumpet call to an army of ruthless fanatics. No, she'd been imprisoned to repent for the few things she
Sam was surrounded by an air of exhaustion. Even worse was the look of loss and utter defeat in his eyes. Words prickled on Dean's tongue, but stubbornly refused to emerge. It was Jack who finally cut through the silence.
Stuck in a perpetual loop between them, their joy expanded into exuberance that carried them to unexplored heights. Castiel had never experienced anything like it, was blindsided by the way it made him feel. Their body was warm all over, tingling, prickling in suppressed laughter that had no outlet.
Does Dean have PTSD that he never talked about with him? Did he misread or does Dean really just need time to accept that he’s still worth loving?
Cas will grasp at Dean’s shirt, a desperate attempt at trying to anchor himself to reality. Dean will brush a kiss on his forehead then, whispering into the darkness of their room.
Dean takes a deep, shuddering breath as Castiel’s thumbs lightly stroke his cheeks, and he can’t help but push into the touch despite himself. He already dreads the loss, the soft promise of skin running along the bolt of his jaw.
“You know, ever since I left… ever since you and I broke up-“ he starts, but he has to stop as his voice breaks. He catches his breath and picks up. “I’ve tried my best to move on without you. And I never… I don’t think I ever really did. Somehow you were always there within me, even when I tried my goddamn best to forget you. In Virginia, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, on any fucking OP in any godforsaken country. I carried you along with me just like I carried my gun. You were always just
“I know I’m being dramatic,” he says, looking down on his feet again. “I just- I don’t know. There’s something wrong about being alone now. There’s a part of me that’s scared that he’s going to run again, and I don’t know why.”
Dean rolls his eyes at that, because sure, he knows. But he can’t help the smile that ghosts on his lips watching Castiel frowning at him while they wait for the tattoo artist to come back with the stencil.
“I do. I’ve just been favoring coffee all this time, but I actually love getting tea in the morning.”
Growing up, I didn’t believe in soulmates. I was exposed to the concept of loss at a very young age, and it left me with an inability to believe in the idea of forever - of fate. Everything to me is temporary, and love has always been a fragile, dying thing. Love has always been an idea, more than anything real that I could hold in my hand- until you came along.
Sometimes, when the quiet creeps along my bones, I find myself wondering if I could have done more, if all of it was my fault. Maybe I could have held you closer, or done more to fight the monsters that tortured your sleep.
“I’ve tried,” Dean says, raising his hands in a defensive posture, his voice slightly cracking. “I’ve tried
He tries to retain a groan at the way his back is hurting, focusing on Cas instead, but Dean’s been through this shit enough times by now to know it’s going to be hurting like a son of a bitch for a long while.
He briefly wondered during the night, what being alone again was going to look like. He handled it so badly after Jimmy’s death, constantly being on the verge of cracking his sobriety or collapsing. Months have passed now. Jimmy died more than 4 months ago, and Cas feels a bit more confident. But Dean not being around anymore- even if it’s for the greater good in the end- still scares the shit out of him.
for it- for Dean’s hands on him, and Dean’s arms pulling him closer, wrapping him up in his warmth. He sighs and Dean chuckles on the other end of the line before they start chatting.
“A bit,” Cas admits, basking in Dean’s warmth, pushing into his neck to hide his face against his skin.
How do you tell your brother that you’ve spent the past ten years running away from your feelings only to find out that you’ve been played like an absolute idiot? And in turn, the first thing you do is run away again?
Benny pats his shoulder as they make it outside, a hand already going to his pocket to take a cigarette out.
“Tell us what?” Sam chimes in, an eyebrow raised at his brother as he stops messing around with his salad- the freak.
Dean brings the cover tighter around them both and Cas brushes one last kiss to the center of his chest before closing his eyes again, a yawn escaping him.
It ends with a thorough make-out session on the couch and an even more thorough make-out session in bed.
No one should be allowed to look this hot this early in the morning. It’s criminal. Dean’s pretty sure there should be cosmic laws against this.
If he only knew how many times Dean drunk-dialed or drunk texted him, asking about Cas, telling him all about how much he misses him. Begging Jimmy to let him talk to Cas. In fact there’s very little that Dean hasn’t told him, and how much he’s still hung up on Cas is very clear.
It’s like standing over a precipice, wondering if you have what it takes to take the dive. Hovering in the empty space, waiting for your body to decide.
He’ll press a kiss against Dean’s skin, where it’s warm and smells likes home and everything Cas has ever wanted.
While listening to Ray talking, Dean turns his head to watch Cas across the room. The other man is hunched over a table with an older woman while they’re both drawing on a canva together. Dean can’t help but smile at the picture they make.
“I shouldn’t have, either,” Cas ponders, his brain groggily trying to provide a response. “I’m just worried about you.”
After losing mom and having to move halfway across the country to a state he doesn’t know, where he doesn’t know anyone besides his brother, having to be stuck in a classroom full of others with “new kid” labeled on his forehead might be close to what grown-ups have been calling ‘Hell’.
“No need to liquify for me kid, I know I’m a big guy but I really am just like… eh, some sort of a friendly bear.”
“Cas said he’d wait for you, huh?” Charlie asks, a smile on her face as she wraps her arm around Dean’s shoulders.
“What were you thinking about, all alone?” Dean asks after a while, his arm wrapped around Cas’ middle, keeping him close, craving the connection.
Dean might be close but it’s insane how just hearing him like this, undone only by Cas’ words and his voice, is doing things to him that shouldn’t be reachable just via phone and his own hand. He twirls his fingers around his shaft, using the precum that’s been slowly pouring down his length to slick it and accelerates his own thrust into his hand, unable to stop the low grunt that escapes his lips at the sensation.
Dean doesn’t pretend like he’s not crying anymore and tears are running freely on his cheeks. Jimmy can’t resist and wraps him into a hug, not unlike the one he gave Cas just an hour earlier. Dean is slightly taller than him, so Jimmy ends up with his face buried against Dean’s neck. He can feel the way pain is wreaking havoc inside his best friend’s body, but the other man is not making any sound.
And yeah, okay. Dean has no objections to that. So he lets Cas stay right where he is; lying halfway on top of him, safe inside his arms and, yeah,
It’s like the dam that’s been holding him steady for the past 10 years is finally breaking, and he’s barely able to see through the tears gathering in his eyes. It feels like shattering all over again from the inside out, and Dean’s not sure if he can even breathe anymore.
“It’s okay,” Cas says, his arms around Dean’s neck. “It’s good that you’re working full-time again, that means you’re doing good.”
It’s there that he finds him; lying on the hardwood floor of his bedroom, eyes glued to the ceiling, his breath a steady rhythm in the silence of the apartment.
Cas nods, still not talking but at least there’s something different in the way he eyes Dean curiously as he starts removing the pieces. He keeps his other hand on Dean’s knee while Dean handles the removal, and then switches.
“Being a smug little asshole is literally half of my personality,” Dean scoffs, delighting in the way Benny laughs at that. “You of all people should know that.”
, be careful with that please,” Cas’ voice comes up from the living room where he, Balthazar and Sam are packing. “I’d like to keep it in one piece, if you don’t mind.”
In short, they’re handing him his dream job on a silver platter, a year after what he still considers close to being thrown out after 10 years of active duty in one of the most elite teams of soldiers in the world.
Dean hands him the paper bag and the cup of coffee, and Cas smiles as he uncovers a white box with a slice of Charlie’s best apple pie. As well as what appears to be a vinyl record neatly wrapped in a white package.
“When I’m in Lawrence I’m constantly reminded of everything I did wrong before. And I see Cas every day trying to deal with his pain, trying to help as much as I can, but…” He stops again, gaze glued to the sky as Benny stirs up to finally sit next to him. “I feel like a hypocrite most of the time, because I ain’t doing much better either.”
“I see Cas every day. I know exactly what I’ve done,” Jimmy says, the air punched out of his lungs as he struggles to breathe. “And I absolutely hate myself for it. I don’t know how to fix it. I’m scared and I feel like shit and I thought I was doing the right thing, but it’s been hell ever since.”
A low chuckle escapes Dean’s lips as he nods, looking down on his knees. “Yeah, well. Life’s unfair. Jimmy wasn’t supposed to die at 27. I wasn’t supposed to end up being a human wreck, yet here we are.”
Why does everyone seem to know exactly what’s going on even when he barely touches down on the matter?
“I mean your fear of being abandoned, of having to watch Dean going away again is running so deep that it pushes you into this need of having control,” Missouri starts explaining, her voice assured. “That’s why you read the letters Dean wrote for you months ago. Sure, it helped you understand why Dean acted the way he did, but it was also a violation of privacy. But this time, with this letter? Dean reminded you several times that he hadn’t opened it, and told you several times that he had planned on talking about it with you afterward. But you took that choice away from him because your brain immediately went into a control mode directed by fear.”
Damn Benny and his stupid ability to see right through him even from thousands of miles away. Typical.
It’s not that he has any doubts about both of them liking the other. He’s spent close to a decade running into combat fire with Benny by his side, and Cas probably knows him better than anyone else on the planet besides his brother. It would be a massive surprise if they
And yeah, sure, he has a point. Cas knows he’s being unfair. He knows he’ll most likely regret reacting like this later on. But he’s also halfway into an anxiety crisis, so he’s not quite sure it matters anyway.
Explicit content is not coming (no pun intended except maybe now that I'm laughing.......) until a few chapters, but I felt bad knowing some people might have gone into this story thinking it was a Teen and Up, only to end up being faced by Explicit content down the road. So, yeah, this is a very Explicit story. Not just yet, but at some point, it will be.
