John looked over his shoulder and smiled: a tall man was leaning against the door jamb.
If he had not known about John's sexual inclinations, he would have thought that something had happened between them, thus fostering a friendship, as in the past with Sarah Saywer.
I don't think my fiancé would be happy-
Since his arrival, Hamish had done nothing but chat to himself to keep himself company, eat and sleep.
"Ah, just forget it!"  said Greg annoyed, standing up and turning his back on him.
Instead the man had stayed by his side the whole time, chatting mainly with Emma, answering her questions, despite some being clearly silly for the detective's great intellect.
Excluding the crying that he had announced his presence in the apartment he no longer shed a tear, although Sherlock was convinced that that record would be broken as soon as his brother made an appearance.
"Do you have to go home right away?" asked Sherlock.
-Sherlock! Your brother is not at our service! -John scolded him good-naturedly.
Would they end up having sex?
-And on your brother- he couldn't help but add.
“Eww” Hamish said from his perch on Sherlock’s shoulders.
Still visibly sleepy, Daniel sat down with obvious fatigue, showing his bruises to the British official who, in the space of a few moments, catalogued his wounds.
" You didn't know what you were doing, or you didn't know you were a father?" asked Greg.
-Terribly... I thought the world would end as soon as you walked out that door! -he replied with obvious sarcasm in his voice.
-Your hair: you have paid special attention to your hairstyle, looking for something elegant, but not too eye-catching, and the same goes for your makeup, light but refined.
It had been a few years since he had last danced, but they had always told him it was like riding a bike: impossible to forget.
Sherlock met John's gaze and looked up to the sky, before turning to Emma.
"Oh, that’s so romantic!" he said.
Mrs. Hudson smiled knowingly.
Sherlock looked around in the flood of sweaty and half naked bodies surrounding him and tried to find a good vantage point that would allow him to keep an eye on both the dance floor and the entrance to the club.
-I think you're right- Sherlock said before ending their hug and standing up. - I'll send a text to Mycroft to send someone to rearrange your room- he added.
-As usual- John commented slightly amused.
__________________________________
-Sherlock with your immense intelligence you decided that jumping off a roof was the only possible solution to save our lives...-
-You need to talk to Mycroft: he can find the right candidates, do his routine checks, so that in these thirteen weeks Baby Girl will meet the aspirants parents and choose the couple that seems most suited to her needs.
- Bedroom...- Sherlock ordered in a husky voice between kisses.
" movement through the pages of his blog.
Also, Emma wanted to spend some time with you and Sherlock-added Jack.
John hurried to shake his head.
-Mycroft is here? -asked Sherlock feeling the anger mount towards the man; those words were confirmation that Mycroft and of course Lestrade had hidden something from him.
What had happened? Why did she take that decision, especially on that day?
Mycroft frowned and squeezed the phone between his elongated fingers, taking it a short distance from his face: attached to the text there were two pictures.
The first thing that caught Emma's attention when they entered the museum, after a short wait in the front garden, was the skeleton of the dinosaur placed in the center hall.
It was a mistake, a bad mistake, but now Gregory had to give him a chance to make up for it.
What are you talking about? -Greg asked, clearly confused.
-The hideous wallpaper, Mrs. Hudson's cookies, the skull on the fireplace... - he readily listed.
Even John, in the past, had let himself go to affectionate statements with his partners immediately after orgasming, and so he was well aware that at that moment the brain is so clouded that it does not know at all what is babbling.
In the forty minutes that followed the apartment was silent, interrupted only by the noise of turned pages of the volumes consulted by John, bringing back to the doctor's mind the many evenings that he and Sherlock had spent in a pleasant silence, one engaged in his all-important and wacky experiments and the other immersed in reading a paperback or busy with his laptop until once again, like so many other times, the bell rang in the living room breaking that harmony.
Sherlock identified three voices: a man, clearly John, and two women, one adult and the other, saw the ringing and excited timbre, a little girl.
The detective did to speak again, but just then Lestrade appeared by his left side, a tired look on his face and a notepad in his right hand.
The doctor frowned but remained silent.
It was dusk.
Everyone was staring at the screen, but I was looking at you.
When he stood in front of the black door for a few moments he was unsure whether to open it with his own key, which had finally found his place in the right pocket of the jacket or if to knock the gold-plated doorbell.
John stood silent for a few moments, looking down and staring at the tip of his sneakers.
He could not allow that thought to take hold in his mind.
"Someone had to take care of them since their benefactor had disappeared" John said.
In the empty apartment, Sherlock looked up from the microscope and, after taking a deep breath as if he needed to regroup the pieces of himself that had run down the stairs with John, stood up and walked in measured steps towards his bedroom to get the ultrasound machine.
-But things will be different, there will be rules, and don't even think for a second that being roommates will change things between us again.
His analytical mind scolded him for that inappropriate behavior, so far removed from his usual attitude, and the sound of a car in the distance reminded him that they were in the street, against the wall of a church nonetheless, but as much as the idea shocked Sherlock, he could not find within himself the motivation to break away from John.
- And as if that were not enough it is almost a quarter of an hour that we're here talking about John-she pointed it out.
-Excellent-
-Then you should start from there: we all make mistakes Johnny, but nevertheless we have to keep trying-
The detective would get over it: Sherlock would brood a little because things hadn't gone the way he wanted, but then he would realize that this was the best solution, so he would contact Irene, and everything would work out in the best way.
That leaving him behind was the hardest choice of his life, even harder than giving up cocaine?
Sherlock nodded slowly, reflecting on his words before standing up, again controlled by the nervous energy that characterized him and which with a few steps led him to the office door.
You are Golden!
-Oh, please, Anderson don't inflict your opinions on the rest of the world! If you decide to die for the person you love, you don't back down at the last minute- Sherlock said bitter, trying to ward off the unrelenting thoughts that made their way into his mind.
Greg shook his head on his knees.
-How could you do that to me? -
John nodded standing to his feet, then dropped the brush dirty with red paint on the newspaper carefully placed on the doorway.
-Tongue on your teeth and lips- John repeated sliding his tongue on his lower lip as well, trying to move his thoughts away from the dirty images that were surfacing in his mind.
-Why would I? Usually information like this comes at a price- he said in a lower voice.
-I know I'm not the ideal man to build a family with, but I promise you I will do everything I can, and the impossible if I have to, so that you always have everything you need and that you, Hamish and the little girl are happy.
-Gregory asked me the same question when he was in your place and, unlike Sherlock, Mycroft has a portrait of Alastair in the living room of their apartment.
"Did you miss me Misha?" John asked, stroking his plump cheek with a finger.
Emma had nodded.
"Sherlock, this is really a mean thing to say!" reproached him again Molly.
The rest of the day passed by checking and completing old reports before they were sent to the archive, waiting for news from the Barts morgue and toying with the idea of going home and resuming the investigation the next day, but he was aware that he would not be able to relax despite good intentions.
But Sherlock denied him that comfort too...
Why had he toyed with his life like that?
Sherlock reciprocated his gaze for a few seconds and gave only a quick glance at the outstretched hand the man had offered him.
John frowned.
John frowned to those words and waited for the other to elaborate his words.
"One never refuses tea, does it?"  she asked.
When John had come down to the kitchen for breakfast, Sherlock had shown him the message, and the man had decided to accompany him, obviously after making him promise that as soon as the case was resolved he would keep his promise and spend a day with him and Hamish .
Greg shook his head: although he had always had a decent luck with men and women, there had been a few occasions in his youth when he had to resort to the help of professionals, especially during the confused period of adolescence, when he could not tell if he was more attracted by his rugby teammates or cheerleaders.
After a few more moments of silence, Mycroft decided it was time to address the main topic, the one that mattered the most to his brother.
-In the eighteen months we have lived together, the two of us have eaten together many times with dinners and take-aways, not to mention the time spent together during our stakeouts, but each time you made it clear that it was not a date for all those who were within earshot-
"There will still be days when I will be unbearable, when my experiments will annoy you, when I will not say more than five words in twenty-four hours... - he listed again.
-Oh, no! - John said, standing up to get another couple of beers.
-Anyway... I think, I hope so...-John confessed with a little smile, looking at the man’s ice-blue eyes.
John chuckled amused, lowering his gaze for a few moments before bringing his eyes back on Sherlock, in time to catch a glimpse of the man's amused smile.
-But, I still don't understand how you became friends with John-concluded.
-How old is she? -asked Sherlock, his voice blushed by the prolonged silence.
-You should look in posh areas of London: Mayfair, Belgravia, even Knightsbridge.
-Why John?
Perhaps the death of their father when they were both young had had more substantial effects than Sherlock had let out in his retelling, something that had led the two brothers to consider feelings as weights that could put them at a disadvantage with their enemies.
Fuck, they were Sherlock Holmes and John Watson!
John stroked his chin and let his fingers slide over the beard that covered it, immersed in his thoughts.
Sherlock nodded, while his brain wondered whether John's words had been ironic or mischievous.
-Jack Michaels.
John stared at the table top a short distance from himself, silent, clearly unsure of how to respond to the river of words that had run over him.
John smiled happily.
John's arms tightened around the black-haired man’s shoulders, leading John to stand on tiptoes to decrease the height difference between them, responding to the kiss, sinking his fingers between the black and silky curls of the detective.
-Nothing.
I stopped the bleeding and we were almost ready to go when they started shooting at us... My first thought was the boy, so I tried to protect him while Bill and Joe loaded the others into the Rover" he recalled.
Emma looked at the skeletons and stared a few moments before looking back on the detective.
"No one ever found my deductions brilliant" the detective said.
Was it the first time Sherlock Holmes had come to terms with jealousy?
"Just like your father, mh?" he said.
The best pair of jeans the man owned.
At thirty-seven, Sherlock was able to somewhat control his own deductions, slightly aware of the impact that certain revelations could have on the life of the person he had brilliantly deducted.
The next moment a strong arm tangled around Sherlock's waist and soon after John's compact body was against the black-haired man’s back, bringing their pelvis close and making them move together to the rhythm of the music.
His father's piercing eyes rested once again on him, staring lovingly and sadly at John for a few moments before speaking.
At first glance John Watson was the average English man: slightly boring, reliable, whose life was punctuated by work five days a week and football every Saturday afternoon; lover of tea and chocolate biscuits, books and incredibly incompetent with all forms of technology, and whose ultimate aspiration for a perfect Saturday night was to sit on the sofa in front of the TV with Chinese food take outs.
I had no purpose without you!" said John, trying to control his anger.
-Why did they bring a candle? - Emma asked immediately.
-I'm 16! If I decide to fuck strangers for money, it's my choice" he said once again with that cold, detached voice.
Sherlock entered the small hall and followed Mrs. Hudson to her apartment, looking at the seventeen-step staircase leading to the apartment he had shared with John.
The next moment two strong arms tightened around his hips, and a solid chest was against his back.
Forcing himself not to think about the clear meaning of the song and determined to take all the time he needed to make the right decision, John reached out his arm to the lamp next to the bed and turned it off, causing the room to fall into the dark.
"Are you still in love with him?" he asked, taking one of John’s hand in his.
Looking for the perfect family, which would look after him with love and he would not miss anything, making sure he will grow up like a normal child.
-You were controlled 24/7 by Moriarty's men, even the slightest mistake would have shattered the entire operation.
As the episode went on, Emma laid more comfortably against John's side, leading the man to place an arm over her shoulders.
It was the second smile in a few minutes: it was certainly a good sign!
__________________________
" he had always made it clear in advance that he was not looking for a love story, that his mind was occupied elsewhere, and that the only thing his lovers could expect from him was a simple one night stand.
"Besides, you’re wrong" Irene said.
Sherlock opened the bathroom door moments later, dressed also in his pajamas and in his blue robe, busy drying his black curls with a white towel.
Lestrade frowned.
They asked if he could meet them at Vauxhall Bridge- she said, clearly sorry to have interrupted that moment of intimacy.
-As if Gregory could do something without me knowing... I know about your first meeting in that horrible alleyway, that Gregory offered you dinner that same night and that he let you into our house, shortly after I left.
The detective shrugged, granting his permission.
-No problem-
Sherlock took a deep breath and moved his head in a nod.
But he didn't specify how long he'd be away, and I didn't ask him.
From the way the boy was favoring his left side while standing, John considered that Daniel must have at least one broken rib,  moving gently his fingers closer to his right eye and softly touching his eye socket to check that it was not broken.
John looked at Sherlock and saw him in a dumpster, immersed in the dustbin to his knees, looking at the corpse; the doctor passed the police tape and made to approach the dumpster when he heard the call.
Jack smiled ironically.
-You should know by now how much I'm well-behaved... Even at the cost of ruining my liver-answered Jack with a smile.
Definitely an unsuitable environment for a child- had answered in an absolute tone Mycroft.
But once the case is solved...-
She says I always carry useless things with me- Emma said moving a hand on the water's surface.
-Okay, thank you. I'll try to stop by as soon as possible" he said, ending the phone call.
For a few moments there was silence in the bathroom, interrupted only by a few coughs from Emma, until the little girl laid again her eyes on Sherlock; the man knew instantly that a new question would come soon, so he decided to precede it.
Sherlock rolled his eyes annoyed.
The only thing that mattered to man was that he was able to carry out his plan: he had untangled the spider's web.
"Hello guys- said Greg, nodding his head to John who promptly returned.
Every single time Sherlock-he reiterated as if he wanted to make the concept clearer.
You've never run away from a difficult situation, and I won’t allow you to do it now" Sherlock said, closing the half open door with a thud.
As much as I'd like to believe that these special attentions are for me we both know you love me, but you're not in love with me.
John joined him, watching him put on his coat, a confused expression on his face.
Greg recovered from his gloomy thoughts and nodded.
Every little attention, every little touch from that moment would belong to Sherlock, forever, and before he took that step he wanted to make sure he wouldn't end up regretting that choice.
After taking another deep breath, John settled down next to Hamish, his legs crossed on the floor, as he was six years old, and in the parish of Saint Thomas along with the scouts' group, observing the little boy.
The smile he received in response was the most beautiful he had ever seen and would have seen for the rest of his life.
-Ok Sherlock, but on one condition... As you said, we are about to become a family, but I realized that in the last few days I have deliberately stepped aside so as not to interfere in your father-son relationship...-he confessed.
-You think it’s appropriate… - John asked without finishing the sentence.
"You really can’t wait to talk about your feelings?" asked cutting.
Once I could see, once I could feel
Initially Mycroft had made some resistance, but in the end, he had to admit with himself that he preferred that closeness to having to speak on opposite sides of a table.
As usual there was a mistake... There was always a mistake.
"You were dead, you bloody idiot!" he replied, venting the anger that animated him from the moment he saw Sherlock in the back of the room.
"Leukemia- answered John without looking away from the detective.
Sherlock nodded and made his way to the kitchen, but John's voice blocked him again.
Following an instinct, Sherlock stood up and, after wearing his blue silk robe, opened the door of his room, thus finding himself in the living room.
-Poison... What a dull and dirty way of dying- Sherlock commented clearly disappointed at that uninteresting crime scene.
"You could do that today" the other one pointed out.
-Don't even try Sherlock! I'm really mad at you- stopped him immediately the woman.
Sherlock shook his head slightly, stopping quickly his inevitable objections.
-Because he's an idiot and I'm the masochist in love with an idiot-replied John without needing to think.
Over time, more and more people began to trust and let me take care of them.
Despite years gone by, Anderson’s presence still bothered John.
What do you want? - he asked him for the last time.
-Thank you... For being honest with me- he said before standing up with some difficulty.
You only saw what you wanted to see... This would be the best day of Sherlock's life if he found out-Greg commented vicious.
Sherlock exhaled, clearly tired of ever having to explain even the most obvious things, before staring his cold gaze upon Tommy.
The next moment John looked for his boyfriend’s ice blue eyes and exhaled deeply.
The smile on the blonde's face reached  his ocean-blue eyes making them even more beautiful and Sherlock was pulled into John’s stare.
As soon as the child noticed that he had caught John attention, Hamish giggled again, leading John to smile pleased and lay his forehead on Sherlock's right shoulder slightly embarrassed.
John looked at the man's face next to him for a few more moments, toying with the idea of sinking his hand into the raven curls and waking him up, but nature overcame affection: a vague rumbling rose from his stomach, forcing  him to return to reality; the day before he had only eaten a sandwich for dinner and now he was definitely hungry.
-Let's go, John!- Sherlock said, walking with quick steps toward the door, followed a short distance by the doctor.
-What a son of a... - he murmured, before turning around and heading to the doorway where he had left his coat.
The woman placed her hands on her knees perfectly aligned with each other and stared at him a few moments before answering.
-How many times did Greg show up on time? Every time we are forced to reheat the food because of the dear Inspector- replied Jack.
-Do you blame me?
When he noticed that Mrs. Hudson had arranged a cup of tea in front of him, Sherlock smiled at her.
It's the men who approach him... He just chooses according to his fancy and most of the time, his choice falls on a pale lanky man with curly black hair-said Jack, staring carefully at the consultant to make him understand the true meaning of his words.
"Gentlemen, why don't we try to... “Lestrade stepped in.
-Maybe... Aren't you a little young to be out at this late hour?" Greg asked.
What was so special about Jack to receive such treatment?
“Why her?" he finally asked.
He knew that sooner or later that moment would come: it was Sherlock who convinced him to come home, but it was evident that even the detective could not bear the silence and embarrassment between them.
You are... Fuck! You're Sherlock Holmes, my Sherlock.
The doorbell rang a second time and John was forced to play a balancing act to get back on his feet without letting Hamish out of his arms and, before heading to the front door, the man stopped next to the stereo system and turned off the music.
Because it would explain a lot of things...- Sherlock added.
Determined to enjoy the Pride, John had put Hope on his shoulders and with her improvised a few dance moves to the rhythm of the music that was coming out loud from the speakers, while Greg was walking by his side holding Misha’s hand.
-Is that why you kicked him out despite being well aware of his physical condition?- asked Greg again.
-How would you say I'm not a catch? I have everything a woman could want! -he retorted slowly following his friend up the stairs.
"Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with your appearance" John said.
"Sorry" John muttered when a small lament came out of Daniel's half-closed lips, moving his fingers away from his right eye. -Can you open your eye for me, please?-
The woman merely shook her head.
The doctor laughed again.
Although, if he had to be completely honest with himself, Sherlock would have chosen the same name.
There, in their living room, in the arms of the man he loved, John Watson was definitely at home.
"Sherlock it’s late, I'm tired and Robert has waited long enough...-said Molly taking a couple of steps towards the door, approaching him.
Mycroft felt a callous hand settle on his right side and a little kiss was placed on the back of his neck, triggering a shiver that ran through the man's back.
A wave of rage took hold of Sherlock, causing him to let out an angry grunt before bringing both hands around John's cheeks.
"I had a really good evening," John said, stopping by his armchair.
The hand that had hold the remote until then reached for his black curls at the back of his head, still slightly damp for the shower and sank his fingers for what was quickly becoming a relaxing and reassuring gesture at the same time.
"It’s for you," Sarah said in anticipation of his question.
I think it was a way to clear his head... He could have found worse methods-commented the woman, almost overthinking.
And this one had to really love Sherlock Holmes if after the great evening spent with John, the first thing that Sherlock found waking up was a message from Lestrade calling him back to work.
-Is John home? - Jack asked, following her gaze.
It used to be a private museum in memory of Sherlock Holmes, with most of your personal items on display.
That was their new normal nowadays.
The detective remained silent a few moments, carefully observing his partner’s face, reading the anxiety and concern that had animated John the previous day, the thoughts that had prevented him from resting quietly, the total honesty in his words when he said that Irene would be a better parent than he was.
Sherlock Holmes does not know of the existence of feelings, he probably removed them deeming them useless in favor of some stupid information about bees or the type of soil that was most likely to be found in a remote corner of London.
The detective looked up for some information, reading what the woman had not told him in her eyes.
"Not good?" asked Sherlock.
If you want to continue to brood unnecessarily on your discussion by endlessly analyzing my brother’s words be my guest, but personally I think you need a higher mind-
Would he use the new attraction Sherlock felt towards the doctor to force him to clean the fridge from the body parts, probably making the request for a second refrigerator only for human remains?
_____________________
"Normality is boring John... " he said in a whisper.
-Well, you and I know I'm a very stubborn man. I'm going to stay here until you listen to me- Sherlock said persistent.
-No, not much-
John watched the sky clear, despite few scattered clouds, and glanced at his wristwatch: he had to hurry if he wanted to get to London on time.
"I think your knowledge of human biology stretches enough to come to the right conclusion: in thirteen weeks Baby Girl will go into labor and... - said John trying to maintain a neutral tone.
Sarah glanced inside the box and approached him, putting both hands on his shoulders.
He could have done research, asked for the club’s cameras tapes to Mycroft to observe John's behaviour during his "alternative Mondays", but he knew from the outset that it would not be enough.
"Mycroft wants me to take care of him" he said without taking his eyes off the baby, now voraciously sucking.
He had to gather as much information as possible, he had to shed light once again on the mystery that John Watson was.
-You know me! I would never sleep with someone on the first date-answer Jack, an expression so innocent on his face that it made John laugh loudly.
-As for your question, I can't answer for Dr. Watson, but personally I'm married to my work and I can't afford distractions of any kind.
And relax your mind
John put an end to the kiss and sniggered, feeling Sherlock’s rumbling laugh close to him, before meeting his eyes and winking at his lover.
Your pain, what you've had to endure over the last three years because of me, was the best cover I could have.
"Okay, I just have to go in the guest room and wake him up, so you can meet him" Greg said, turning his back on the man.
Tommy had been the last person he had slept with before Sherlock showed up at "Pride" before things got terribly complicated between them... They had fun together, John remembered that the boy was affable, funny and that like him he had no high expectations from that night.
The idea of an addicted( or fomer addicted) John was born after reading "One day at the time: no way back" by KeelieThompson1.
Do you want me to come back later? - he asked ironically, unable to hide his amused smile.
As soon John's hips began to move back and forth, Sherlock clenched down where he felt John moving inside him.
At those words Mycroft halted, unable to breathe, to move, unable to cope with the mental image that those words had shown him.
Sherlock smiled and nodded his head, as if wanting to take note of the rebuke.
-Yes, Stephanie? -
-All right. You have no idea how happy I am to see you... You are a vision for my tired eyes- Greg said once their kiss was over, taking his companion's hand and guiding him to the living room.
Reassured by the conversation that, he was certain, would help him clear his ideas, John focused on his work proving as affable and charming as always to his patients and making himself a cup of tea mid-morning while he made small talks with Sarah.
"I read your blog" said John, once he put his glass on the table.
John nodded and gave her a calm smile.
The chances of him showing up at Harry's house were minimal: a forced cohabitation would do nothing but bring their differences to the surface again.
He had not earned the nickname "Three Watson Continents" by establishing a serious relationship with every partner he had slept with, but in his case it was different: each time his partners knew what they could expect from him, how far they could go and above all they knew that they could not make many claims.
Sherlock bent down on his knees and watched the body for a few moments with his pocket magnifying glass before standing up and giving way to John.
"He’s a pain in my ass, dead or alive," John answered, staring at the floor in front of him.
Daniel shrugged, trying not to be intimidated under Mycroft's careful scrutiny.
John waited for the silence to descend into the hall to speak again.
Annoyed by that idea and trying not to listen to the little voice in his head that pointed out that the man had never snapped his fingers towards him, he turned to Jack.
When John finally managed to return to his office, he was decidedly more confused and slightly worried that, considering Sarah's opinion on his clothes, he would have more luck impressing Sherlock if he showed up naked.
-I would have known how to behave, instead of being suddenly assaulted by journalists.
-It's all so boring. It's not a murder! Why are we even here?- he asked Lestrade.
Lestrade was now living with Mycroft so Sherlock excluded him from the list as well as Mike who had two little girls; certainly not the right environment for John with this peculiar situation.
"Go on then" he said, determined to indulge his boyfriend’s madness.
Sherlock relaxed briefly against John, hiding his face in the other's neck, before breathing deeply.
Would you let me, John?- Sherlock asked him in a thick voice.
John briefly imagined a possible marriage, the expression on Sherlock's face as he proposed, the knowledge that no one could ever separate him from Sherlock.
Sherlock frowned.
The man lowered his head, looking at the tip of the loafers for a few moments, and then shook his head slowly.
The only thing that was wrong was the mahogany stick to which the man leaned on.
Sherlock stared at him for a few moments, unsure whether to address that subject immediately or whether to wait until the main course.
Sherlock tilted his head to the right, clearly unconvinced.
-Before I left, you were always eager to tell me every little, useless thing about you, so why do you want to leave me out now?" he asked again.
He was aware that those words were strong, that they would probably hurt the black-haired man, but that didn't make them any less true: he had fought hard to find a balance and stability in his life after Sherlock’s death and he had no intention of seeing everything collapse just because of Sherlock.
Just as you asked me- the cabbie merely said.
-Anyway... That night we talked a lot and found that we had a lot in common, so we exchanged phone numbers and a few days later we met outside of work-concluded Harry, a pleasant smile on the lips.
Their glances met again with those words: was that the goal of the evening?
He closed his eyes and let himself go to a shaking breath.
But I'm sure you read the files and that you are already aware of this-commented John, shaking his head a little.
His first reaction was surprise, he was almost tempted to break away, but then he understood the true meaning of that gesture and let himself go against that known, solid and friendly body.
John sighed and hold the girl's hand between both of his.
John had spoken at length in a calm and reassuring voice, exposing the idea in an articulate and exhaustive way, leaving no room for doubt, always with a smile on his lips to prove to Baby Girl that there was no hidden trap or agenda and that his words were sincere.
Sherlock finally realized that the stories about your one-night stands weren't just stories, so what?
What about him?
The girl let go a happy laugh and returned to stare at the monitor where the image of the child had appeared again.
At least this time, Sherlock got away with it without bruises.
Tomorrow he had an important appointment that would require his full attention and all his strength, he could not afford another sleepless night because of Sherlock Holmes.
It wouldn't be easy for him, but he would have been willing to do it if that would have helped John in some way.
He nodded his head without even considering shaking the hand of the other man and turned to the male steward, clearly ready to follow him; the man smiled at him and opened the plane's tailgate, showing him the iron ladder that would lead him to the runway .
Perhaps John could have believed him; perhaps if their relationship was only in its infancy or if John had not repeated evidence to the contrary, of the great heart that Sherlock hid behind a wall from the majority of the population and that only a select few had the privilege of seeing.
Also excluded was Lestrade, whose number was imprinted in his mind, and Mycroft, because a special ringtone was assigned to his number.
The man shook his head.
No one could say he hadn't tried.
-Dr. Watson. It is a pleasure to finally get to meet you: I have heard a lot about you.
"Are you ready?" asked John, preparing himself for a full day with the two Holmes brothers.
A tiny part of his brain kept pointing out to him that if they were now in that situation, if they were forced to fight to save that relationship that had been born under the best auspices and that had made John believe in a peaceful future, it was because of Sherlock's mistakes, because of his silence, and because of what had happened with Irene.
"I can find time for it" said the other man, stepping aside for John to walk before him and make his way to the kitchen.
No one knows him as well as I do, why John persists in these stupid relationships? - he said clearly confused and annoyed.
There were so many questions that still couldn't be answered: what did take John away from home every Tuesday night?
-I don't want to talk about this-.
"We are having a drink after our dinner" she confirmed.
Committed to filling Sherlock's plate with a small portion of pancakes, without realizing it, John began humming the song, dropping his eyes on the detective's long, elegant hands when he put the plate in front of him, trying to to remove from his mind the memory of how those hands had grasped him, hold him tight to his chest, of the delicate caress of those fingers in his hair.
Sherlock nodded: he had not forgotten anything about the few hours of pure happiness he had experienced with John before Hamish's arrival.
"Gregory, please talk to me" he said, ignoring the pleading vein that had accompanied his words.
This case is different, it always has been and we both know it- Sherlock repeated it.
Baby Girl stroked her belly with one hand, gently, almost without noticing it before meeting the doctor's blue eyes.
John frowned.
-At least for now-
"Now what do we do?" he asked without addressing neither of the two Holmes.
Then there were many photos of John with a little girl, almost ten years old, Sherlock estimated, and these were the funniest photos and the only ones in which John's smile was sincere.
"Later” his father greeted him before turning his back on him and getting out of the kitchen.
That morning, when  he got up the apartment was  empty: both John and  Mycroft  had already  left; he had tried to call his fiancé to offer him his  support , to  remind him that though Mycroft had never seemed mournful after Sherlock’s death, Greg was  there in case he  needed  him.
Mycroft endeavored to smile at him and stroked his short hair, still slightly damp after the shower.
The sound of the downstairs door heralded John's return.
-I think it's better for John if we try to get along, instead of avoiding each other every time we're in the same room.
-As far as I know, John didn't mention it with Sherlock.
The door opened and when Mrs. Hudson appeared on the doorstep, Sherlock smiled.
That avalanche of emotions he couldn't identify was about to suffocate him, but Sherlock was aware that letting John go without making him at least partly aware of those "feelings" would be the biggest mistake of his life.
For the first time since he got into the car, Sherlock  felt his older brother's gaze on him.
The man had spent the night in the police station and, although it was not the first time he had spent sleeping at his desk,  Mycroft could not help but wonder if he would come home to change clothes or if will wait until he sure to find the apartment empty.
I don't know if I should congratulate you or give you my condolences-said Jack, staring at the friend.
____________________________
If everything had gone according to plan that night he would have been at home, with the only person he had missed in those years.
-Dr. Watson? -
"Is that all you've managed to scrape together in these years?" he asked, trying not to give importance to the hot, sour feeling that had awakened in his stomach because of the last photograph.
That affability was completely gone, giving way to a clearly unexpected pain, which was compounded by a latent rage.
Aldershot Cemetery was, as was often the case in small towns, embedded in the main church: graves hundreds of years old mingled with those decades old or a few months old; access was allowed via a small wrought-iron gate further closed by a chain with a padlock.
Had he rushed to take refuge in Jack's arms?
-And don't forget to ask her about her new lover! -
It was obvious that she wanted to ask him something, but that she did not know how to do it, and Sherlock decided to help her.
Jack sighed.
But even before he was fully conscious, John remembered the difference between cinematic fiction and reality: instead of the gentle sun that lit up the room, Sherlock's bedroom was still shrouded in semi-darkness caused by clouds and rain that he felt falling insistently against the window panes; the harmonious song of the birds had been almost brutally replaced by the distant rumble of thunder to herald yet another rainy day in London, and the hope to feel Sherlock's strong body next to him was disproved the moment John reached out to the portion of the bed occupied the night before by the detective and found it cold and empty.
If only they knew...
I had already lost friends and fellow soldiers during my years of service in the Army, but I never suffered for anyone as...-said unable to finish the sentence.
Greg nodded before leaning forward on the desk, both arms on the desktop cluttered with paperwork.
"I'm trying to get Mrs. Hudson to run away with me to Gretna Green and get married" he told him, making the old woman laugh.
-It should…-
-How did you met him? -asked him incapable of postponing further.
You stopped me when I was in danger of becoming cruel, you saved all those criminals, because if it was up to me John, I would have killed them one by one just because they had driven me away from you.
Sherlock observed him a few seconds before nodding briefly.
John flashed a smile at him as Sherlock put his violin and bow in the case.
John quickly observed the books in the library and recognized most of the titles, including classics and new "masterpieces" of children's literature, but one volume in particular caught his eye, leading him to remove it from the shelf and browse the pages to a few moments, noting that some of them were more consumed than others.
_________________________
So, I lied, and I accepted the lie that was being told to me, with the certainty that that chapter of our story was definitely closed.
-Are you going to meet him later? -
-It’s a bit like River Song and Amy Pond.
Okay, you have a reputation, but it's nothing new, I always knew you were “Three Continents Watson”...
-  It's rare to find someone who loves us despite our flaws, who defends us even when the rest of the world says we're wrong, when…- she said sighing.
He then walked up the stairs to his room, followed a step away from Jack, leaving Sherlock with the weight of that condemnation.
At least I know that my man will come home to me at the end of the evening dragging behind his best friend, drunk and desperate for the death of my little brother, despite being able to pick up a lookalike of yours every time he goes to a club.
-Sherlock... No one knows better than me that although your feelings towards each other are very strong, nothing ever happened between you two.
Yesterday morning you asked me if I knew why I was apologizing... I'm sorry that you're suffering from the consequences of my mistake, that it's hard for you to accept Hamish for who he is...
-SHERLOCK!- John reproached him, a note of embarrassment and disbelief in his voice.
It was physically impossible!
The expression on Gregory's face was awkward, hesitant, as if he were afraid to say the wrong thing, but in the next photo Gregory and the boy walked away together, exiting six minutes later from an alley.
A frustrated sigh slip out from the detective's disclosed lips before he began his "obvious" explanation.
"The same intelligence" John added.
An ironic laugh rang out in the room, before John turned slightly to meet the black-haired man’s face once again.
John focused on the monitor for a few moments, moving the wand only a few millimeters and pressed another button on the console.
John turned in anger, read to hit anyone who stopped him, but froze when he saw Jack.
Ever since he had seen John with Sarah, he had always tried to split John Watson his friend and blogger from John "Three Continents" Watson, a charming man who needed just a few jokes and a smile to bring his conquest to bed.
Do every time what is expected of you, not because you want it but not upset your partner.
-Do you remember when you came to Dartmoor to help us with the Baskerville case? - he asked Greg.
-I don't understand what's so hard. It's pretty obvious what the back is and what the front is - commented the detective, causing the young woman to giggle.
It was enough for Greg to look in his eyes to know that the other was sincere; despite his great knowledge of mankind, there was still a sphere in which his partner was almost completely ignorant: despite the ability to recognize potential threats from the movement of an eyebrow or thanks to a nervous tic, both Holmes brothers were completely unable to handle their own emotions.
"Would you like a drink?" the woman asked.
Without adding anything else, he got into  the car, keeping himself slightly away from the man and placing his bag on the ground between them.
Molly handed him the bottle and he approached the baby's face, until the latex teat was between Hamish's lips.
-Let's see... I can tell you that wool and cotton don’t do justice to our dear doctor.
"What was this for?" he asked after clearing his throat.
His mother should explain better that word: for his mother, home was the Mansion just outside London where he and Mycroft had grown up and where his father spent his summers returning from Cambridge.
Sherlock stared at him for a few seconds, cataloguing the information he found written on the man's face.
As soon as John had left the stage, headed for the small group of friends and family, Sherlock had left the shed, unable to breathe and to stay an extra minute in the shack.
-It's not finished yet, but you can see that for now he doesn't need a lot of stuff around him- John carried on.
-An elegant way to define stalking-
"What's your name?" Greg asked, realizing that it had now become a necessary information.
"Of course I will" Boss reassured her.
-Oh, don't forget rule No.1-Jack added suddenly.
Upon John's return home, Sherlock became convinced that things would soon return to their daily routine of experiments, clinic shifts interspersed with boring crimes and take-away food.
"You always look at the bright side of life, don't you, Johnny?" she asked sarcastically.
Sherlock stared at him a few moments, a little bit annoyed at being deprived of a worthy fight but before he could say anything  five-year- old Hamish stood in front of him and stretched the front of his t-shirt with the skinny fingers of his right hand.
-I don't believe in fate. I don't like the idea of leaving my life in the hands of an unknown entity-
For his part, Sherlock melted into his boyfriend’s arms, leaving him in complete control of the situation, enjoying the attentions that he had been missing for so long, certain that John would never intentionally hurt him.
"Do you really have such a low esteem of me?" Greg asked then, unable to hide how much that situation hurt him.
Don't tell me. I know your name and I honestly don't care to know anything else-he added in the same frosty tone that several times had petrified Heads of State and Ministers.
When the doctor finally opened his eyes, a satisfied smile appeared on his lips as soon as he met Sherlock's gaze.
"You have no idea how much I'd like to punch you right now" John said, trying to control his instincts.
But you can't cause unnecessary stress to a pregnant woman, especially in a particular and risky pregnancy like Baby Girl's.
The only good thing, if he could have defined it that way, would have been getting caught by his father.
"I have a blanket and at first kids don't need a lot of things... - Baby Girl started.
Jack immediately noticed the presence sitting in the chair, the same armchair that for all the years of his friendship with John, had always remained empty and inaccessible.
Mycroft nodded before heading to the entrance hall to retrieve his briefcase.
-Coffee?- he asked the two men.
-You will be an integral part of her life.
Trying to walk against the wind, he slowly walked towards the car, as if he could avoid that encounter somehow, but when he was a few meters away, the car door at the front right opened waiting for him.
"I could have helped you!" retorted John with the same anger.
By the time Sherlock finally felt fully satisfied and ready to return home, it was late afternoon.
He walked through those familiar corridors, in which he had found himself countless times and breathed the smell of the hospital in his lungs.
Until he could get rid of that image and the anger that raided him every time, he couldn't think of a possible future with Sherlock.
John let go of a slight laugh, then glanced at the package Sarah had left next to him.
“Sherlock I don’t want to get upset cause I want to enjoy this day; also I don't want to force you to come with us because I know you all too well and I know I would end up ruin my day and the kids too. So I'll just accept your reasons with a resigned sigh and a shrug and I’ll keep getting everything I need for this afternoon ready. Greg is gonna be here soon" John told him, focusing his attention on the bag.
"I can understand it" Sherlock said, clearly reading what the other man had been silent about.
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind “
John passed his hand through his short blond hair and remained a few seconds in silence, before raising an equally furious look at the detective.
Love?
"Maybe Sherlock has something else to do" John told the little girl.
In the next ten minutes John focused on cooking breakfast and when it was all ready, Sherlock sat down at the table, in his usual place, and looked at the plate of scrambled eggs and toast that John had put before him: the blond didn't particularly like that kind of egg , but every time Sherlock decided to have breakfast on his plate he always found scrambled eggs.
-Neither did I.
"John, look at me" Sherlock said almost softly.
In doubt, Sherlock decided to continue.
Carefree laughs and recommendations to be silent to avoid waking up Mrs. Hudson had led John, standing on the first step, to turn to the detective, still at the bottom of the staircase and to lay a few kisses on the black-haired man lips, both hands on Sherlock’s cheeks.
Clinging to the scarf like it was his only lifeline, John rested his head against his friend's right shoulder as a broken sigh escaped from his slightly open lips.
There were four men... One of them was still a little boy, he would not have been more than twelve years old- John said, looking up and taking a deep breath.
You also know as well as I do that the idea that Baby Girl can keep the baby is not practical and clearly impossible: Social Services would take the baby away from her the first week, if they ever allow her to leave the hospital with the baby.
Hamish Watson shrugged.
-You know the theory on the five-stages of pain.
"I could ask you the same question" he said with a serious expression on his face.
John wondered how much of the detective's adventures had been revealed to the reporters, hoping for a moment that the man had left aside the bloodiest details.
The military man, perhaps sensing that this was a special day, had agreed and promise Greg to let him have news as soon as possible.
-I have my toys, but Mom wouldn't let me take them with me.
-Really? -
Jack hugged his friend as well and locked the office door behind him, then showed the lunch bag he was clutching in his right hand.
-Sherlock...-reprimanded Greg without turning his eyes away from the man's.
John was definitely a patient man, otherwise he would never have been able to survive for eighteen months in the same apartment with Sherlock Holmes and his experiments and the severed body parts in the fridge.
Greg nodded, freeing his hand from the other man’s hand and standing up, stretching slightly.
-Fine! Go and enjoy your boring movie and your boring night-Sherlock said before John's lips were on his.
"What did you mean by his services?" Greg asked again, following him into the kitchen.
When John had called him from Waterloo station that morning to inform him that he would be home for a few days, the man had not asked questions and with a little bit of luck he would not do so for a few days before forcing him to talk.
Sherlock smiled mischievously and lowered his head, kissing gently the skin of John’s shoulder, sensitive of the wound that had interrupted John's military career; the wound that had led John in his path.
Now everything was clearer...
Instead of answering, the woman nodded to the nearest waiter and ordered Assam tea, returning to lay her eyes on John’s face as soon as the waiter turned his back on them.
"I can see now that it was not one of my brightest ideas" he said.
-Ah... You're here - said the doctor, abandoning the cane by the door and moving toward the kitchen.
"Believe me there's nothing that interests me less, but since we are going to work together again, I need your attention to be focused solely on work and not on silly sentimental problems- answered the detective.
John looked at her surprised and in response the woman shrugged, bringing her attention back to Jack.
-You should... When John is on the dancefloor, it's pure electricity-
-Go home Sherlock-
Sherlock scoffed.
He wandered through the kitchen, rejoicing for a moment that it had not been turned back into a laboratory and approached the kettle, controlling the water level and then putting it on the stove.
“Be good for your Daddy” Sherlock said.
Aware that he had no alternative, John sighed and nodded, thus decreeing his surrender.
He turned his back and took off his jacket, casting a quick glance at John who had followed that exchange in silence, and winked at him to reassure him.
The woman shook her head, moving her brown curls and entering shortly after in the kitchen.
"Don’t forget what I told you...” John murmured as he made his way to the red door.
However, despite the laughter and the fun, John could not get rid of a constant and annoying thought in his mind.
John laughed.
It was strange to think that this small tombstone could contain the ever-active cyclone that had been Elisabeth Watson, a woman genetically unable to stay in the same place for more than two minutes in a row.
-You learn to live with it... There will be other men, other people who will make you feel good or who will help you feel less lonely.
-Don't get me wrong, I never forgave her for her involvement in the events that led to your death, but during your absence, I got a chance to meet the person behind the cop.
-Not a penny more... Are you going to visit your mother? -Mr. Watson asked him.
-Mycroft would pay my bail and then give me some medal... The only reason I'm holding back is because I want John to do it- he answered honestly.
He was afraid of the infamous Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment before putting his arm around the blonde's back again.
____________________________
"The person you love is alive, John, do you remember how much you suffered when you thought you had lost him forever?" he asked.
He turned around as he heard the door, and as soon as his eyes rested on the visitor, Sherlock saw them wide open.
At those words John risked a glance at Sherlock, realizing once again how close that episode was to their situation.
"I'm sure Hamish will love them" he said, nodding.
As John Watson tried to do good with his medical knowledge, Greg Lestrade scrambled to do the same with his work.
Sherlock stood motionless in the embrace, until the woman broke off and looked at him for a few moments.
Did Sherlock really believed that John would have shunned him for the rest of their life if the child hadn't been there?
-Always on the same day? - he asked.
Maybe it wouldn't have been as difficult as he thought to rebuild that relationship...
-Mh... Move your tongue on your teeth and lips and tell me if you notice anything different- John said in a slightly hoarse voice.
The detective sighed, clearly unhappy with the situation, but stood up as well, following the woman into the kitchen.
"I know you already have plans for tonight but are you sure you don't want some company?" he asked when he met the doctor's eyes.
“Hey little monsters!!” Greg's voice burst into the living room moments later. “Let me take a look at your t-shirts... Wow, you look so cool!” he said, a smile in the voice that made Hope laugh.
Once we were separated for three weeks and when I came back home your mother got pregnant with you...-commented the man with a small smile on his lips, lost in his own memories.
I'm telling you this because I want you to understand that now, after Hamish's arrival, I've become as protective and fierce as my mother.
This time, however, instead of sitting on the uncomfortable carpet, John lay down on the portion left free by Hamish on the plaid, then turned to his side to observe the child.
John laughed and hid his face in the hollow on his partner’s neck for a few moments before meeting his gaze again.
John laughed.
-Okay, but why don't you think about it for a second?
-You chose her when you saved her life and kept it from me, even though you saw me struggling between the truth and that bullshit of the witness protection  program, and you did it again when you went with her to fight Moriarty’s men-added John.
"I don't think I'll ever be able to put into words the love I have for my little girl" she began, feeling John's watchful eye on herself.
I saw less burnt pieces of coal" Jack retorted.
"I'm coming!" he said to the mysterious guest waiting for him on the other side of the door.
A few months ago, some associates of the firm went for a drink to maintain good relations between colleagues... Don't look at me like that, I drank a ginger ale like a pregnant woman! - she said at once, noticing the change of expression in John's eyes.
-We're taking it slow- he said.
-What am I going to do, mom? What should I do?
Molly looked down, caught red-handed: it was the first time her role in Sherlock's fake suicide came to light.
When they finally arrived at their destination, Emma seemed to remember his presence.
If the idiot was back in the apartment, then Mrs. Hudson had seen his face bruised for his blows.
-That man is really rubbing off on you... - she commented without malice in her voice.
-Then how do you explain the fact that they both took the poison at the same time but the girl manage to survive?- Sally asked, trying to avoid a fight between the two men.
John smiled again.
Sherlock picked it up and allowed himself a smile, unable to free himself from the feeling that things would soon return to normal.
"You have found your lost boy” said the British official, unable to bear the tense silence between them.
This time it was Greg who raised his eyes to the sky, but let the sarcastic comment slide, letting the room fall silent.
The next moment, he turned and opened the door, leaving him alone in the apartment.
-How about Dad? I can see you as Dad- he then commented, moving his head slightly to meet the man's ice-blue eyes.
A flash of wrath appeared in Sherlock's icy-blue eyes, leading him to curl his fleshy upper lip and give him an almost wild look, which he managed to hide within a few seconds, causing the usual mask of indifference to fall on his face.
Sherlock rolled his eyes heavenwards.
John sighed, letting himself go against the back of his armchair.
"So maybe after dinner we can pick up from where we left" Daniel said, referring to their previous talk.
Before Sherlock could say anything two shots were knocked on the door and few moments later Donovan appeared on the door.
Jumping off a roof was the only way?
When the waiter walked away again, Sherlock looked up at the blonde man, clearly reading his emotions on his face and hinting a smile, feeling slightly more confident.
It's bigger on the inside-
It's the period that everyone regrets after a couple of months when the problems and quarrels increase, and you don’t seem to find time for sex!
"Who said there will be next time?" asked the detective, an eyebrow raised in surprise.
Jack smiled sadly and for the first time Sherlock found himself thinking of the many sad smiles that had disfigured John's face during their friendship.
The clashes with Mr. O'Neill were still in his memory as if they had happened the day before and not thirty years earlier; every  time he knocked on their door, his father-in-law did not fail to point out his disapproval with  his hair, his tight pants or the chains he used instead of the belt.
Watson knew that the return from the land of the dead of the Reichenbach's hero had not yet reached the press, and since returning to London Sherlock had spent much of his time in Baker Street, going out only a couple of times to meet with Molly at Barts.
"Not bad" he said.
-Okay if there's nothing else... - he just said, turning around and walking towards Jack who had waited patiently in the corner.
-You like it... - Sherlock said, looking up at John's face.
John found himself unable to take a step in any direction: initially he wanted to leave and forget that evening and all that had happened, but once again he found himself encased in the need to run to Sherlock, curling up against him and wait for everything to settle as if by magic and the desire to close that chapter of his life behind once and for all.
The group of friends stayed together for another couple of hours, continuing affably to tease each other and simply enjoying the company, without murders or the sadness that had accompanied them in recent years to spoil their mood.
Slowly John opened his eyes, instantly meeting Sherlock's and ended the kiss, dissolving the tangle that he and the detective had created in less than a minute.
And this time, contrary to what had happened with Molly, Sherlock reciprocated the embrace, clasping his arms around the woman's waist.
"At this stage of pregnancy, if the baby helps us, I'm sure it won't be a problem" he said, bringing the machine closer to himself.
At the age of six, however, he was totally unable to handle the situation: from his point of view, the people subjected to his "scrutiny" had to be grateful to him for the revelations that he discovered with a single glance.
"So, you thought you'd trade some of my knowledge with instructions on how to build that time machine?" asked Sherlock.
"Hey Misha" said Greg, stroking the baby's back, prompting a smoldering look from Sherlock for the nickname.
Moreover, the anger meant that there was still hope: despite the detachment, changes and continuous secrets that seemed to want to separate them, the doctor was still there, ready to lose his voice screaming to make him understand that he had misbehaved.
"And how will you explain it to John?" he asked.
"So, what's your plan?" asked Greg, ripping him from his thoughts.
Of course it's a date- Sherlock answered upset.
-No, I won’t. Maybe you forgot our conversation...-
The problem, however, was that John had no intention of talking about what had happened with Sherlock, at least not now: everything was still so confused, Sherlock's visit had only made things worse, and John definitely needed time to think.
It had been an eventful day... Damn it had been weeks since his life changed its perspective at any moment without the smallest clue to prepare him for the events that were about to happen.
Was there anyone forcing him into prostitution? Or was the red-haired man his pimp taking part in his salary?
He had not gone far; he had made only a few steps, moving in an almost hunted way trying to put order in his confused thoughts, clutching between his trembling fingers one of the cigarettes he had made a habit of keeping in the inner pocket of his Belstaff in the past few years.
The film was now coming to an end with the protagonist now on the cross losing his chance to save himself because of a condemned man more cunning and quicker than him.
-They did, at least some.
"You are home" Sherlock said in a voice heavy with sleep, his eyes still closed.
If only I'd got on the roof... If I'd done anything to stop him...
Hiding his feelings behind the usual detached and indifferent mask, he heard a motorcycle and looked up in time to see John leave on the bike, trying not to be overwhelmed by the panic that seemed to take hold of his person.
-Why are you still here? -asked Sherlock, surprised and slightly bored.
Emma turned her gaze to Sherlock, who had been in the kitchen the whole time, despite having now abandoned the cup of tea.
How could such a small and common name hide such an important and vital person?
It would be obvious to everyone that John Watson and Sherlock Holmes were together... And an unexpected thrill descended the detective's back, forcing him to come to terms with his own feelings and expectations he didn't think he had.
No music at two o'clock at night...-
The man had always had light sleep and, as a consequence of the last three years, was able to wake up even because of the slightest change around him.
-Oh God... Sherlock- John murmured in a hoarse voice, moving his head to meet Sherlock’s full lips again.
"No, you're the one who spends hours in front of the mirror, so that every curl is perfectly tidy and at the same time messy" John answered back, happy to see a contraction at the corner of the detective's mouth, the closest thing to a smile the man would allowed himself in the presence of Jack and Mrs. Hudson.
Desire.
-Sherlock Holmes? The Sherlock Holmes? -
"What do we do now?" he asked once again not addressing anyone in particular.
The first few days were rough then luckily, she met Boss who took her under his own wing and hasn't lost sight of her since- narrated John.
-Ehi buddy! – John greeted him, losing himself for a moment in the ice blue eyes of the little boy.
-Do you remember John's eyes? Smiling, full of life, shining every time he laughed? -she asked.
-John! Jack and Emma are here!"  called Sherlock as he approached the stairs leading to the doctor's bedroom.
"There's hot water if you fancy a cup" the man said.
Greg took a few moments to pour the sugar into his drink, before bringing his eyes back to his interlocutor.
John, the bag of white sliced bread in his hands, stood still for a few moments, trying to put his thoughts in order.
Sherlock swallowed several times, trying to find something intelligent or even just coherent to say.
What was Irene thinking?
John frowned, openly skeptical.
"Jack was complaining about your cooking," John explained with an amused smile.
"We're not married" he said.
His first thought had gone to Mrs. Hudson's uncertain health, but the woman had reassured him and told him that she simply did not consider it necessary.
A flat screen tv was placed on the wall at the bottom of the room, perfectly in front of the sofa; a desk was on the right side of the room with a laptop and everything needed to work arranged neatly on the coffee table.
What the hell was Sherlock doing on television?
"I'm not sulking" Sherlock said, with a petulant voice, without looking away from the slides under the lens.
And it was precisely that weakness that suggested his modus operandi: he would continue his relationship with Gregory, of course after getting rid of the boy who had tried to take his place, and would generously forgive Greg, showing his magnanimous and gentle side.
I always thought part of him died that day.
-NOT NOW MYCROFT!
- You were the one who told me that you weren’t interested in any kind of romantic bond from the beginning, so I kept repeating to myself that if all I could have was a friendship then it will be enough for me-admitted John.
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
-Why would I leave London when I have everything I need here? -asked Sherlock sincerely curious.
"It's time for you to hold your son" the woman explained, before walking in the living room followed a few seconds later by the detective.
Did I forget something? - he asked sincerely curious.
Emma shook her head, disconsolate.
-It's not bad. I wasn't sure you'd remember me- Tommy added sinking his hands into his pockets.
"Is there anything in particular that I shouldn't talk about with your mother? “John asked, looking at the detective.
Molly nodded.
The curiosity increased even more when they saw the captain come out of his cabin and, after settling his hat on his head and checking that his uniform was in order, standing in front of that mysterious passenger.
Mr. Watson nodded.
At the sight of the candle, John frowned and then raised his eyes to the sky in frustration: certain things seemed to never change.
- The press has been informed, but they still don't know the reason for the press conference.
"How can we break up if I don't even know if we're still together?" John asked, looking up at his friend.
-Trust me. He knows everything.
-You are.
He lit a cigarette, trying to make order in his thoughts, and it was then that he saw it: abandoned on the ground a few steps from himself, lay John's cane.
) who returned to the clinic for the third time in a week.
Do you promise me you're going to think about it? -
-I need it Lestrade " he said.
John stared at him a few seconds before nodding: such an offer would never happen again, and John was aware that he had to take advantage of it now to shed light on some dark spots that always accompanied and tormented his friend.
"What should I do with him in the meantime?" he asked.
John looked down on his hands clenched around the still wrapped sandwich.
Sherlock looked away for an instant, making no attempt to hide the amused grin that bent his lips.
For a moment it was tempting to ignore it certain that it was Sherlock, but on the other hand Mrs. Hudson did not yet know of their quarrel: maybe she had tried to contact Sherlock and having failed had contact him.
A slight smile appeared on the black-haired man’s face.
A bit like you: unique and very special- he said with a slight smile.
-Give me a few minutes to change and I’ll find you.
It had become a part of him.
"I told you he'd need some time" Greg said.
Lestrade took a deep breath, trying to calm down, standing up and laying both hands on his hips, staring again at the other's imperturbable face.
John hinted a mischievous smile.
-Now I need to bleach my brain to get rid of this picture...-said Greg shaking his head.
To those words, Sherlock smiled.
-His name is Robert, he works with Special Operations, and we met by chance during a seminar a few months ago- she confessed.
The woman rolled her eyes, approaching the small refrigerator and pulling out a bottle of water.
Sitting at the bottom there was a midnight blue scarf.
A presence appeared behind him, and without turning around, Sherlock realized that Mycroft was there, finally understanding the reason for his presence in front of that door.

The child, fearing he had been left alone, began to complain, but just then in the room the notes of "
- To be honest, you let me down John: being a doctor you should have been the first one to point out from the beginning that the possibility of keeping the baby was practically non-existent, instead you allowed Baby Girl to cultivate this stupid and useless fantasy...
John sighed and nodded in turn.
-They're going to tell you a lot of things about your dad.
Sexual healing, oh baby
He would fight with tooth and nails, that was for sure, but how could he rob a child of his family, his real parents?
"I don't like them either," Sherlock admitted to her for the first time out loud.

How long had it been since he had called Greg?
"I'm gonna do my best" he said, ending the call.
-Every year Mycroft spends the equivalent of the British public debt on donations to various museums.
"I will, don't worry" his friend reassured him.
“My mom says I'm too curious, but my teacher says curiosity is good. What do you think?" the little girl replied.
John sighed, upsetting his hair with a nervous gesture, still shocked by the innocence with which Sherlock could talk about a similar subject, before looking up at his partner.
On another occasion that thought would have saddened him, leading him to operate with the utmost caution, but what Sherlock had done to him that day did not lead him to be kind towards the man.
John thought, looking up from his menu and staring at Sherlock's face, still immersed in reading.
-Damn it Sherlock! Will you try and control yourself?" said Mycroft, berating his brother, hurrying to comfort the child.
This had been the motivation that had driven him to behave as he did.
Jack stared at him for a few moments, clearly surprised by the interruption and possessive tone that had transpired from the man's voice.
-Leave? Where should I go? Don't tell me we're out of milk again.-the doctor said.
For a few moments the room was silent, while the two men indulged in small moments stolen from the outside world and "normality", until Greg covered his mouth with one hand, trying to hide a yawn.
- It's my turn to play 20 Questions-Daniel added, an almost childish tone in his voice.
Anyone with superior intelligence would have a foot out the door the moment they orgasmed-commented frosty.
"I'd rather avoid it, given the time and the fact that I haven't finished breakfast yet" John said, but moved his plate away to the center of the table.
Every time I think of you
Sherlock snorted and crossed his arms.
After buying the paint can and the appropriate brushes, John returned home, wore clothes that were more comfortable and suitable for the work he was doing, and immediately put himself to work.
"You don't remember me, do you?" he asked with an embarrassed look.
Sherlock kept staring at him, waiting for the other man to continue.
Baby Girl nodded quickly, slightly discarding the blanket to show the tiny bulge that Sherlock estimated with a four-month-old fetus.
"Holmes left his bag by the door, I think there's everything you need in case he's hungry or he needs to be changed" his father told him.
Might as well put a ticket booth at the entrance-commented Jack sarcastically.
"So, what's your "real" name?"asked John, genuinely curious.
A crying child.
After taking a small sightseeing tour and waiting for Mycroft and Greg to arrive, the three settled into one of the living rooms.
"Why Uncle John doesn't use his cane anymore?" the little girl asked him again.
"How generous of you" Greg said caustic, closing the suitcase and grabbing it by the handle.
-I have a special permit. A friend of mine works here, and then I suspect the receptionist has a crush on me-said to justify his presence in the reserved area.
After that, they will try to contact Baby Girl's family, but as soon as her parents renounces all responsibility for the baby, the little girl will be considered "adoptable".
-Come on Mycroft...
Did you want to tell me that you didn't need me anymore, or that there's no place in your life for me anymore?
John stayed back in the apartment a few moments more,  unsure whether to try one last time to change his partner's mind or follow the children and Greg downstairs.
John nodded, undecided on how to end that evening.
John shook his head and walked with Hamish to the bathroom, to begin the evening routine.
-Then we will do as you said- she said.
-What happened John?
Are you coming with me?" he asked, meeting his partner’s gaze.
-The dead man in the bin? Sure... They're all looking over their shoulder for what happened to Harry- Daniel commented before taking a sip from his own cup.
Anthea curled the right corner of her mouth, the equivalent of a bright smile for the woman.
Sherlock had moved closer and looked at them.
In addition, you have seen our apartment: it is definitely smaller than this house and I assume your Estate.
For a few moments John stiffened, surprised by Sherlock's unexpected move, but relaxed again when he heard the happy sigh that ran to Sherlock's lips, once he had settled comfortably against him, his long legs folded on the sofa, an unexpected smile to curve his lips.
Why scold him if he had only said the truth?
He understood why Mycroft had disappeared so early that morning and could not be reach in any way, leaving it to Anthea to filter out his phone calls.
To those words, a warm applause rose from the group of people sitting in the front rows representing John's family, leading the doctor to smile again, despite the nervousness that radiated from his posture.
That small insignificant gesture made by Sherlock, a man who refused to take his cell phone even when it was in his jacket pocket, made John understand how frightened the man was at the idea of seeing their relationship end, by the prospect of seeing John leave, or being separated from him, the only person able to tolerate  understand and love him, even for just one night.
Finally alone John returned to the living room, looking at the photographs on the walls almost in search of an answer.
Greg looked at him surprised and John make to answer him, but he was preceded by Jack.
So at least you'll have a chance to see your doctor tonight... Even though I don't know how much you're going to like to see him completely drunk.
Despite the hatred John professed towards him, he had not made the slightest hint of leaving.

Or to keep my memory alive?
He looked up and saw Jack a few steps away from him.
It took him a moment to locate the black car waiting on the track.
5) "Sexual healing" by Marvin Gaye
"Of course, just a quick stop to say goodbye to Mrs. Hudson and Hamish and then we can go" he said, stepping aside to let John out of the apartment, seizing the surprised expression on John's face.
Of course, we can't do all this living apart...
Knowing his brother's refined tastes, he was certain that almost nothing of the old bachelor's apartment at Elephant & Castle had found a place at the one he now shared with the British government.
Believe me, Mom, I've been asking myself the same thing for the last few days.
"Ours is not that kind of relationship" Sherlock replied instantly.
"-I could put him in foster care.
-I followed the doctor's orders!
Listening to the sound of footsteps on the ladder, Sherlock realized that John was in a bad mood.
-Anything-
"She could have been a teenager" Greg said.
That's when he heard Sherlock's voice.
The last time Sherlock shared an apartment with a stranger, it didn't go very well-she said without explaining further and letting the silence fall for a few moments.
Sherlock played for a few seconds with the glass of whiskey he had in his hand and wondered for the umpteenth time how much longer he would have to wait and what the hell was he thinking when he had let himself be persuaded to be there that evening.
-Despite everything I couldn't have asked for anything better- John whispered.
If Sherlock was a force of nature when he was awake, as soon as he fell asleep he was the embodiment of serenity: Sherlock indulged in sleep so rarely that his rest was incredibly deep, impossible to disturb or interrupt with external noises.
It was only when the dinner was over that the atmosphere changed: usually Sherlock consumed the few bites that consisted of his dinner in front of the microscope, busy taking notes, while John settled on the sofa in front of the TV.
Totally inaccessible to him.
Everything I know about him, I know thanks to your mother's stories and the portrait Myc keeps in the living room... You two never talk about him-said Greg serious.
John chuckled, before heading to the kitchen where he retrieved the blue bag in which for years now they had been storing everything they needed for a day out with the kids.
Sherlock saw him walking up the stairs, a sign that their date would be over soon, and he stepped towards the man.
Jack merely nodded, then looked at his friend.
John chuckled amused and then addressed a mischievous smile to him.
"The old Molly so clearly in love with me?" asked him, without malice in his voice.
For his part, Mycroft was surprised by the myriad of emotions that passed on Sherlock's face for once devoid of the usual mask of indifference: there was surprise at that unexpected discovery, the anger at being deceived and also anger at himself for letting being deceived once more (
It had become apparent to him a few minutes before that this was not the road to Baker Street, even  though he had only managed to find now the strength to ask that question.
The British official took refuge behind the kitchen island they had in the middle of the room and grabbed the edges with both hands, staring at him with a serious and furious look at the same time.
Sherlock had received the message twenty minutes after John's departure, while he was busy venting his frustration on the violin, tearing ungainly and horrible sounds from the instrument.
A twin smile appeared on the face of the British official, surprising the doctor.
-Maybe another time...-Sherlock reassured him before lowering his gaze and taking John’ erection in a loose hold before moving his head closer and licking a slow, winding line along the entire length.
Sherlock sneered, shrugging his shoulders.
John turned to the boy and remained silent a few moments, his gaze fixed on Daniel's injuries.
John nodded.
How could he never notice anything? If all this had happened before his eyes without him noticing, Sherlock must have been right all along when he called him an idiot!
There was a moment of tense silence, in which a myriad of considerations crossed John's face, until the doctor sighed.
Could it be that John understood what generated that acrimony before him?
-Oh, no! I don’t think so –
Sherlock frowned, wondering how to ask the next question.
"Not good? “he asked, frowning.
He approached the sink and, after passing a hand on the steam-covered mirror, allowed himself a long look at his own reflected image.
Sherlock immediately brought his eyes back to the man’s face, ready to apologize, looking for a way to fix his mistake, but the expression on John's face confused him: he had expected pain because of the sensitive tissues, but the main emotion on John's face was a mixture of embarrassment and lust and pleasure.
Are harder to hide than I thought
Although he had tried to get angry with the detective for the constant presence in his life and mind, he knew perfectly well that he could not blame anyone other than himself.
I was convinced that once they passed the Acceptance Stage, everyone would move on with their lives and forget me... It wasn't pleasant to think that the only people I thought were important to me would end up erasing me from their lives, but it was the most reasonable solution...-said Sherlock, stopping midsentence.
An affectionate expression accompanied by a slightly amused smile appeared on Molly's face.
We can go to the zoo, or to the London Aquarium...- John proposed with a little smile.
If I tried to contact you, and believe me, I thought of hundreds of ways I could do it during my absence, they would have known, and you would have died...
"Believe me, I was too, when Sherlock talked to me about his idea this morning" he said.
