The detective inspector(DI) had invited Sherlock to dinner, and the world's only consulting detective gave in once Lestrade had managed to bribe him with another case. A cold case.
Lestrade slumped into John's chair in defeat and noticed that Donovan was already ordering the rest of the crew out of 221B. No, there has got to be another clue, anything to help the frustrated detective inspector right now who was pondering over Sherlock and John's disappearance. If this was not a prank, but how could he prove it?
“Okay so what did they say and why didn’t they call my number? I had given Sebby my home phone number.”
But they hadn’t seen the last of Jim as another message arrived shortly afterwards. ‘Johnny boy, ask Sherlylocks if he has found the cock and bull bomb yet – JM’
Sherlock’s eyes, which were previously brimming with tears, now glowed with some kind of anger. Eugenia noticed and whispered to her mother, “I am worried.”
Accompanied by his two bodyguards, his ever-present assistant Mary and his PR advisor and business manager Mike Stamford, the wealthy, influential man left the studio with a snooty expression on his face and a confident step that always made him look taller than his modest five feet seven inches frame.
“I like it too,” John kissed his brow tenderly, “But I can’t do it soft baby. I need to do it hard.”
“I really want to marry you. I don’t want this to end Sherlock, not in six months nor in sixty. I want us to be together, grow old together, share his life, this home, this wealth, everything.”
Sherlock pretended to be shocked but deep down he was enjoying this too, John could tell. Oh the varied workings of an eccentric mind belonging to a brilliant man! The lips opened and Sherlock slut-swallowed John’s huge appendage, letting it glide straight down his throat until the tip of the throbbing erection hit the back of his palate. The sensations were exquisite and John groaned like an animal in the stupor of a rut.
“There are other places for you to hide them, including that friend of yours, Jim. Anyways, be gone. It seems my nana had a change of mind and changed her will accordingly. All that she owned is also mine. Not just my thirty odd percent but the entire thing. I no longer need your toxic presence next to me or even an iota of your help anymore. Just don’t expect a payoff or bonus because you’ve already stolen about a hundred and sixty million from me already.”
“Okay,” Sherlock said with a giggle and got into John’s car. Phil had parked his car a little ahead of John’s and was now marching towards their car with great gusto, crinkling his nose as he saw the vehicle John had driven up in. Clearly upset and jealous, he had just opened his mouth to call out to Sherlock again when John intercepted him – physically and verbally. “Hey, that’s a no-parking zone,” the blond man pointed, planting himself straight into Phil’s path, “You don’t really want to inconvenience Sherlock’s neighbors and have them complain to Sherlock later, do you? Be sensible now. Move your tin can a bit ahead. We’ll be done in just a few minutes.”
“I thought so. He didn’t inform you yet. Maybe he wanted to do this in person but I thought you should know.”
“Hello Sherlock,” Sally greeted him shyly, “I am so happy to be here, especially since you’re here too. I mean….” She glanced at her sister and added, “I mean we can sometimes have lunch together, can’t we?”
The chest creaked and moved due to their movements but neither of them even bothered to give that a second thought. They had everything they wanted right there, in each other’s arms, the refuge neither man had sought but which they were reluctant to give up right now.
“John I may not say this enough or often,” Sherlock was still wearing boxers and shivering this time, though John could tell he wasn’t even aware he had so little clothes on, “But I need you on all my cases. You are a great sounding board. You talk, suggest, question and that’s how I also question myself and spell out answers, sometimes I form the answers as I speak with you. It’s so much better than talk to the wall or the skull.”
But he knew he needed to talk to someone, so he dialed the only other option. His former landlady Mrs. Martha Louise Hudson.
John leaned forward to blow away a piece of lint which was clinging to the edge of the chair whilst still kneeling between Sherlock’s legs. His hands were on Sherlock’s knees, about to leverage that ‘push’ up motion to help him stand up. Sherlock at that precise point rolled his head back on his shoulders, exposing his long milky throat, eyes closed.
A few amusing visions of Mycroft being the overprotective brother and his father fending Greg off rudely swam before his eyes. Despite everything, it made Sherlock smile. “They were trying to protect me,” he said curtly to the other man, “Anyways, what do you need to talk to me about and how did you manage to get in here? The housekeeper didn’t announce you, nor did the security personnel at the gate.”
Mycroft was wringing the neck of a bottle. Sherlock was practically eye-stabbing an apple. Then suddenly Sherlock made a comment that drew everybody’s attention and practically turned the situation into a matter of real concern. “Speaking of navigating so well through life and relationships, eh?” He asked, sarcasm oozing out of every word, “Says the one who is dating a criminal mastermind?”
“Would you explain something first?” Sherlock counter questioned him and to humor him, John nodded. “Go ahead then.”
“As always, your imagination runs wild,” Sherlock huffed, “But I respect your wishes. Would you like me to help you clean up?”
The next moment he sucked hard on it and fondled the younger man’s taut balls, giving him the double stimulation he needed for an instant release. It worked like a charm and Sherlock came cursing and swearing, spilling into John’s mouth, then crying out his name and moaning aloud. He shook and shuddered all over, tugging hard on the handcuffs and making John worry for a moment that he might injure himself.
Despite his misgivings he couldn’t say no to the man so he quickly got out of the house through a side door, walked past the courtyard, down the steps to the sunken area where they had a rose garden and a picturesque swimming pond. More steps, upwards this time, before he crossed a bridge and there was the Olympic sized pool shimmering in it’s full azure glory.
“He is a king alright. He even has his own zoo, he has deer and sheep grazing on the grounds, he has tree houses and outhouses bigger than most people’s city homes and of course three swimming pools. One indoor and temperature controlled, one swimming pond which is all natural and a third one which is Olympic sized and has a manmade waterfall feeding it.”
“Feels good,” Sherlock moaned, teasing his own nipples and touching himself, pupils dilated as he took and gave pleasure in equal proportions. When he felt a mild twinge in his groin and a corresponding vibration in his balls, he slowed down and started to rotate and grinding his hips on John’s huge cock, letting himself feel every inch of it in his tight, volcanic hot channel. The needy groans from John gave him a greater impetus to prolong this pleasurable moments, the sight of this powerful, wealthy, poised man totally helpless with lust was a sight he could cum a hundred time to!
, he was devastated by the sight of Sherlock’s locked room and the emptiness of his life had started to bite into him and his soul. He had nothing left here to contribute to, nor did he had any hope to hold on as a string of survival. He would have stayed back and fought the prejudices if there had been prejudices. His logical reasoning told him Mrs. Hudson was totally correct in everything she had expressed so far.
“Sherly,” the voice turned towards sinister, the playfulness replaced by dark undertones, “If you’re
“As you spoke of a woman being stabbed to death I suddenly saw this weird vision of another women, I don’t know who because I couldn’t see the face, just her form and outline, hanging from the ceiling. She had hung herself, she was dead, she was just hanging from there, a lifeless corpse, just as a doll would……” He paused and cleared his throat repeatedly as he choked up, “Excuse me, but I just got emotional as I remembered…. Or was it even a memory or just some fear? I don’t even know what to think anymore Mary….. believe me, when Sherlock visits me I feel better, better than any other time. He has this magical power to make me feel better. But today he won’t be here, he sent a note.”
Which John did, feeling really diminutive in an office cabin that was big enough to accommodate a basketball court and sitting in front of a man who was six feet seven inches tall. Kayden looked at a file, glancing through some pages while concentrating on one or two, while John waited awkwardly but patiently. “Okay,” finally the lieutenant colonel broke the long silence, “You saved my best sniper, Sebastian Moran. You also saved one of my other officers, Sebastian Smith. Reports say you took down a jeep of ten guerrilla fighters in Afghanistan, all on your own, using just plastic explosives and….what is this…..liquid nitrate?”
Hope flared in Sherlock’s heart. Maybe he would get exonerated of all the crimes he hadn’t committed but was still charged for. “You found that out?” He asked quietly.
He was still magnanimous enough to appreciate the meagre efforts on the ‘offering’ and picked up a cookie when Sherlock stopped him by grabbing his fat wrist.
“Are you happy?” John asked as they sat in the bathtub together one evening, staring through their glass floor-to-ceiling windows and looking at the Paris nightscape and the Illuminated Eiffel Tower in the distance.
On any other day he would have considered that the usual activities of a beaver or squirrel or rabbit but that day all he saw and heard were stalking monsters intent upon killing him. With trembling hands he fetched some boards and boarded up the windows of his bedroom.
“Oh my God,” Eugenia rushed towards her son. Magda, who disliked the doctor just as much, calmly got up and said, “I’ll go get an ice cream for my grandson.”
“If I had, would you have put in the effort to become the man he needs, to be the person you are today?”
He had to give in, however, when he woke up with John jerking off for the third time in under one hour. Clearly doing self-service was only stoking the man’s libido and he was unable to keep it in his pants. Feeling sorry for him and also for himself, after all how could he sleep with those sounds and the bed shaking constantly, Sherlock removed all barriers of bedding and clothing and offered himself like a ripe fruit to his partner. John wasted no time at all and dove down to suck his cock while Sherlock grabbed his hips and pulled him closer, returning the favor. Hot wet lips worked on his cock and John groaned with both pleasure and relief, feeling some pressure come off his achingly hard organ. He knew something was wrong with him but with this state of constant arousal he was hardly able to think. Thoughts were left off for later, the time now was for action.
“Good God, that’s some serious generosity. It’s not a case of someone with 100 billion giving away one billion. This is something awesome, unheard of.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything, either in defense or offense. Truth was that this point had been scratching and nagging at the corners of his mind for a long time but after his reunion with John he had been so happy it had slipped from his mind over the past two day. He had been able to forgive Jim but unable to forgive himself for being so gullible and silly. How on earth had he accepted a highly-sexed man like Jim was okay with them not fucking for two whole years.
“You know what,” Mrs. Hudson suddenly acted like she had had enough for that night, “It’s all the fault of my sister and dear niece, talking about those tales and fables. It’s impacted you girls psychologically. Let’s got to bed dears, I will shut the windows if that makes you comfortable.”
“We should look for motive,” Jim commented, “But don’t be surprised if you don’t find any. This guy wasn’t someone well-known, so getting any backstory will be very tough.” Greg was about to say something to that when Sherlock butted in, “People sometimes kill for sport and the motive there is mostly just that…. their own ‘amusement’. The way this killing was done, it seems someone took perverse and extreme pleasure in committing the crime. This fellow was taking a piss, then he was chased, from there to that place, see the tracks…..the attacker tried to hide the prints later by dragging something like a stone or boulder over it, leveling the footprints completely.”
“I will resist digging in. You do your work and keep the data and facts ready. I won’t get involved unless I really have to.” John gave an indifferent glance. Greg lowered his voice, “Do you plan to tell him the truth at any point? My suggestion is that do that only when you are a 100% confident about him and have spent enough time reading him and his intentions. As I said, boy from a good background, has education, common sense and wit, but you are the sort of
“Look, if you need more money….” Mycroft sounded a bit….desperate? But John stopped him, “Please, don’t even go there.”
Sebastian pushed John’s glass towards him and forked a piece of fish, bringing it to his own mouth. “I understand that. You don’t want both of them in bed with you. But the alternate arrangement, of one being a lover and the other being a friend or housemate, that too doesn’t look likely to happen. If that was what you wanted, you shouldn’t have started fucking Sherlock.”
By now the group of people retreated back at a safe distance and were watching him, one person stepped forward cautiously. John was confused, why were they backing up from him.
"Friend of mine. When I say ‘friend’...." Sherlock stared at the skull himself and then took off his Belstaff and scarf.
Sherlock checked the time on his laptop 11 O'clock pretty late now, he set his laptop to the side of the table.
A sudden chill came over John, sure that someone was staring at him. And definitely not from the usual gaze, usual eyes. He turned to find Sherlock grinning at him, giving one of his 'interested' looks. Not good, not good at all. John mentally panicked as Sherlock strode toward him after dismissing himself from Sally's company.
Only to be stopped by the same woman be saw before behind some yellow tape. John frowned at her and was about to say something before a plaque was shoved into his face.
The Detective Inspector grinned at Sherlock, "Just meet someone interesting today. Thought you might want to check him out."
"Sorry?" The blond startled. His close-cropped hair flew up, the tan lines on his face paled a bit, and his near perfect posture faltered a bit. All hinted toward military.
"No! I mean, it's crazy, Sherlock. You don't need to buy me anything," the blond bumbled out. Sherlock's eyes lit up with hope when he saw a hint of red rise up to the tips of John's ears.
"Problem?" Sherlock mentally grinned as the DI groaned and leaned on a wall that separated them from the British Government's men. Maybe they should do this more often, it was already amusing watching Lestrade struggle to keep up with him.
He nearly jumped when the door suddenly hit the wall with a surprising amount of speed and Anderson was suddenly shoved through the opening, Sherlock also stepped in nonchalantly.
John suddenly jumped when his pocket vibrated. He shoved his hand in his pocket finding a phone, he was surprised he hadn't noticed it. The smart phone was a emergency communication device for some spirits.
something and the brunet growled frustratedly at the paper. He flipped it upside-down, right-side up, and started to tilt the page all over the place until Lestrade snatched the paper away and ripped it.
John practically growled at the small camera hidden behind the books on the highest shelf of the room and stomp-climbed up the furniture to it before everyone else in the room. Wait, John mentally smacked himself across his head. Dummy. He forgot that Mrs. H and the annoying minions were in the room with him.
And even though Lil Sherlock had bemoaned, he knew that he didn't really want to be like Myc. He wanted to be like John, and he was absolutely sure nothing in this world could separate him from John in a million years.  Not even in a billion! Take that, five-year-old math!
"Of course Mummy. John's here," Sherlock rolled his eyes. Mrs. Holmes grimaced and sighed, she didn't know what to do with her youngest son's imagination.
Sherlock shook his head and frowned, there was a waxy paper that was sticking out from beneath the files. Sherlock pulled out the piece article and blinked.
human being and likes to condemn his own mistakes onto his flatmate who was currently (risking his life) trying snatch that little piece of cheese off the mousetrap.
He finally came across a room shared by four people, and three spirits. The door was covered in 'keep out' and 'danger' tape, so he deduced it meant the room belonged to a young teenager. John could only assume that the same teen was left in charge of the kids. If the kids were left with adults then the adult would've also taken off their shoes, but there were only three pairs of shoes outside. Toddler-sized. So the someone else in the room had to be the owner, the teen, who went by their own rules.
"He'll be taking the room upstairs, Mrs Hudson," Sherlock responded before John could protest. The blonde gave Sherlock a murderous glare before smiling at Mrs Hudson and then followed the landlady into the flat.
Sherlock watched John walk up to him from a few metres away. Half of the detective's mind was frustrated by their find and the other part was satisfied that John was walking in a straight line with no signs of a limp.
Sherlock being restless stood up again, decided to ignore that statement, and continued to rifle through the British Government's papers. Five hours, twelve minutes and three seconds since he's last seen his blonde companion.
Obviously this kid sitting in front of him wasn't his counterpart's, heck the guy only told him when to advance. It was a peculiar sight, even as a specialised medical-soldier spirit, he's never seen a child with a head full of silver hair before especially this late in the melanocyte-clock. There also wasn't any sick or unhealthy vibe coming from the boy.
Sherlock ignored him, swivelling toward the direction of his own room coming back with a camera and some papers. John frowned; what was Sherlock going to do, interrogate him by  using peer pressure with his penetrating gaze?
"Seriously, why does he always look so sad and plain all the time?" Sally Donovan frowned in John's direction. Everyone was catching their breath from the latest pun, even Sherlock had to control himself from laughing like an idiot.
"John, what are you saying?" Young Sherlock stood nimrod straight, there had to be telltale signs. Of lying. But John's eyes stayed sorrowful, he wasn't lying.
The lights suddenly turned off and John blinked trying to adjust his vision, he could see the man in front of him was red and frowning. Then something snapped in his mind, no. It couldn't be...
"John?" Sherlock asked softly without realizing it. The whole specimen in the slide forgotten over the mysteriously familiar blond who knew of his past. Lestrade cracked his neck and tilted his head, trying to recall whatever John told him.
Sherlock hated limited information he frowned at the blond and returned his attention to the window. "Look across the street. Taxi."
That was when John froze. How the heck did that man know he was a doctor? To the rest of the world he didn’t even exist. Unless...
Right, Harry probably thought that John was some normal human being who couldn't see imaginary friends.
Sherlock contemplated the fact whether John was actually a witness or a spy paid by Mycroft to stalk over Sherlock.
I wanna rewrite this lol. Please bear with me, school life has absorbed me and I'm pretty sure this fic is over 6 to 7 years old. Pretty sure I made it when I was in middle school or junior high.
Blurry, things were so blurry. There were voices everywhere, so distant and disoriented like static, like far-away voices. Where was he, where was this? John blinked to a view of a bunch of people crowded around him, well the fuzziness was starting to fade a way by now.
Lestrade hopped out of the chair as quickly as he could and sighed, "Sherlock, I'm here because I'm concerned about you."
Disclaimer: Obviously freeform, and I write for fun. Or from Boredom. Very obvious that Sherlock is not mine or anybody's. He owns himself just like every other person owns themselves. Okay, maybe BBC Worldwide Limited, Hartswood Films, Moffatiss and ACD too.
Anderson was squirming in his chair at the moment, and John felt bad for him. Just a little bit. The guy was a trouble at times but- no he
The ever-so-good DI then asked the poor landlady to describe what happened again, because she was the first one at the door right after the explosion and shattering glass. Lestrade patted Mrs Hudson's shoulder with condolences, trying to calm her down, because what else can he do while she frets of her tenants' safety?
Daniel was about to reply when John cut in, staring directly at Harriet Watson, "For God's sake Harriet, you called me here what do you want?"
"Lovely tone as always brother mine. I'm calling in regards of the good doctor you have in your flat right now."
Especially after that awkward discussion about today's crime scene, Sherlock had smugly described then solved the murder in less than a minute. Of course, solving it, as in how the murder was commenced. Finding the murderer was another story.
The detective inspector shooed his team out of the kitchen before they trampled all over it, "Just, go take some photos and grab some evidence bags."
Lestrade flipped the paper around and blinked vaguely at it, Sherlock frowned. "What does it say Inspector?"
Concern was all that John could feel from the man in front of him when Sherlock's name was brought up. This was most likely a bothersome overprotective person who abused their power for whatever reason to try to get closer to Sherlock. Who else would go through all that trouble just to kidnap a 'new friend?’
smart; and the list would go on for miles and miles until the brunet received enough elbow jabs from John telling him to shush up. Sherlock decided there and then at his ribbing session, to change what he knew about John from a small file into a large cabinet.
Mike shrugged, "I heard this happened once, don't you remember? Years ago, this one spirit decided he just couldn't split with his child. He eventually went missing, but there were rumors that he managed to become a human."
"A-Are you talking to me?" John sputtered in the cabbie's direction, his voice sounded foreign to even himself.
Lestrade had already ordered food trying to convince Sherlock and John to eat, not like Sherlock was going to eat anyway.
and that the rude detective is actually missing, only to be overheard and then lectured (quite harshly) by Lestrade.
"Sherlock, do you know that I don't exist? I'm just part of your im--imagination," John spoke softly but his voice broke at the end.
Lestrade entered the room with a stupefied expression, Mycroft does tend to exaggerate his decorations. Sherlock scoffed at the DI face before jumping out of Mycroft's chair and then landing on the mat purposely scrunching the fibres. If one word could express what Sherlock was feeling at the moment was; bored.
No, no, no, no, no, no- That wasn't right, it was supposed to be the other way around; John was the one punched in the face and he never punched anyone in the face at least a few minutes or hours ago.
me. I had to make a great deal just to get Donovan, let alone Anderson, out of their working hours," Lestrade shot Sherlock a look.
As if by fate, he saw the familiar mop of dark curls again. John's curiosity quickly overwhelmed his current distress as he stood up quickly, trying to see who was the owner of the hair. A bit frustrated, the blond ended up on his tiptoes, trying to look over the crowd of people.
appreciate it when Mycroft kidnaps me," Sherlock sarcastically announced to the CCTV camera in between some old books making sure that his bothersome brother would get his message. Lestrade turned his head in that direction also and saw the small device, he walked over there and picked up the tiny camera.
"You knew him, yet there is no such meeting recorded. You have never crossed paths before, yet you know even more than Sherlock does."
He's done the impossible, he's met his long lost child, and the feeling of accomplishment was overwhelming, but now what?
"I could hear you all the way down the street in a cab, you must have really gave Donovan a headache haven't you?" Sherlock glanced at John while surveying the room and gave a satisfied hum.
Upon arriving to the university building, it was already evening and the sun could barely be seen. This area was different though, the place was completely void, dark, and vacant.
Great, he was fully visible, if the police happened to notice him then that meant Trouble. With a capital 'T'. However, John could sense three imaginary spirits in the house somewhere. And miraculously his teleportation skills still worked, because none of the officers were guarding the front door at the moment. Idiots.
Should John take a risk and teach his egoistic flatmate a lesson? Would Lestrade or Mycroft ever hear the consulting duo?
John nodded his head with confidence. That was a lie, John was actually cold-sweating as he exited the restaurant into the night's cool air.
"Picked him up at the crime scene, thought he might be useful," Lestrade pulled a chair and sat down, "He actually was, well helpful. Don't look at me like that, this guy helped us a lot. He even gave us some hints on how the death was caused."
It was a marathon and John was going for the grand prize, the golden medal(cheese). The doctor was 15 metres away, 10 metres, and now 5. Before John could reach the (d*mned fourth chaos em-, er I mean) cheese, the doctor did the strangest belly flop to avoid being caught by the sudden intruders that entered the room. The one who just spoke seemed very agitated and was tapping his umbrella as he spoke, oh wait that would be Mycroft.
The older Holmes swiftly dropped to his knees and looked under the chair expecting to see something of interest, but he saw nothing beneath the poor piece of furniture. Lestrade had also seen Mycroft do that and did the same.
Lestrade laughed obliviously and patted the flustered blond on the shoulder. Sherlock, however noticed the very obvious lie.
Note to everyone, just trying to finish this chapter so any mistakes would be my fault because I don't plan to beta this right now. Why longer sections? I obviously feel awful for not updating.
"More bullying, a lot of the spirits are leaving their children," Anthena sighed, looking over to Mycroft.
"Why, is it where your toys?" Lestrade snickered. Sherlock gave him a death glare which shut him up, and briefly glanced at the map memorizing each and every turn. The map was closely related to his childhood, Sherlock could feel it. Lestrade just shrugged his shoulders. "Sherlock, maybe we should drop this nonsense. It
Sherlock heard Lestrade's voice calling out from behind the door and tried to keep a straight face. Then he looked down at the miserable lump again and the consulting detective cracked up once again. John rolled his eyes and got up to check whether Anderson was okay.
"It was very obvious, John," lil Sherlock spoke as loudly as he could, all while puffing his chest out in pride. He took ever one of John's compliments very seriously. After all, John was his best friend. Sherlock smirked, and only John knew about him the best.
Double trouble, John's getting more freaked out. Especially when he sees a kid without a imaginary spirit.
"Once midnight passes, you will never see me again. You'll eventually forget me, Sherlock, you won't even remember me."
He closed his eyes, and rubbed his temple waiting for Sherlock to say something. Nothing - he didn't hear anything. Frowning, he looked up and nearly jumped out of his chair. Sherlock's face was just inches away from his. Sherlock's hands shot out and grasped John's head firmly, using both thumbs to lift the corners of his mouth.
It definitely wasn't Mycroft's since the words weren't as loopy and looked a bit jagged, plus Sherlock would recognise his brother's hand writing from any age. The handwriting though was definitely creepy, they gave a strange vibe which sent chills down his spine. The detective glanced at Lestrade and noticed that the DI visibly shivered and read the words.
" John exclaimed as he gingerly set the bracelet down on the table next to them, then reached an arm out to feel the brunet's forehead. The taller child swatted away the offending hand.
The team searches up and down the flat, only finding random (gruesome) body parts displayed in a variety of hidden areas. Lestrade's team is less enthusiastic than before entering the house; Anderson secretly (yet loudly) hopes that the body parts are
Couldn't be. There was no way that was Sherlock Holmes, it was just his mind playing with him again. It was unknown for a spirit to see their past child again but John just had to try. Dream or not, he had to try.
- Actually, many thanks to PaperbackHeart (on Fanfiction.net!), they volunteered to beta chapters 1,2,& 3! Enjoy. :D
Sherlock noted himself to categorise this into John's small yet growing file, and for the first time Sherlock relaxed and lets out a chuckle. Then the consulting detective looked down the road to where a police officer was apparently approaching the cab that they had just stopped in the middle of the road. The passenger got out and pointed at both of them.
with no child. Not to mention, he didn't even know if he was an imaginary spirit anymore. Whatever was happening to him today was too confusing and abstract for John to process. He turned around and leaned on the glass, trying to get himself together.
"The boy," John blurted too quickly, Sherlock noticed that the blond was playing with bracelet on his hand again. "He saw a man with a cap and glasses, but the woman arrived in a cab with no one else and was found dead next."
, Sherlock prayed silently while keeping his fingers crossed behind his back. He saw John's eyes soften immediately as if he had just read his mind.
"Sherlock Holmes," John muttered confirmation, before grinning like one of those little imps. In Sherlock's case, he meant kids. However, John's grin was-charming.
Oh yes, and whose fault was this? Who exactly was responsible for why both Sherlock and John shrunk into five-centimeter figures?
"All this for a favour, Sherlock?" John was torn between punching and throttling his stupidly selfish flatmate.
sir. Now what do I do with this guy right here?" Sally interrupted quickly, and to John, it definitely sounded like she was trying to cover up the gun incident. Before John could strain his ears any longer, the sergeant rolled her eyes and grabbed John's elbow unexpectedly. John let out a small yelp, and his heart hammered against his chest. The contact felt extremely alien.
“I understand,” Greg smiled, “Take my car. And buy a new one after selling that scrapheap of yours.”
“And what if I am not any of the things you assume I am,” John asked, “If I am really a well-settled educated man with a good job or business or professional, single and eligible.”
John didn’t seem taken aback by the statement but he didn’t jump at that idea either. For a few minutes he thought over the suggestion, then nodded, “I see that you do have a good point and it might prompt someone from my past life to get in touch, offer to help me ease back in my former life. But consider the cons as well Sherlock. What if an enemy shows up sooner than a friend or a conman decides to take advantage of my condition and swindles me or pushes me down a rabbit hole? Now it’s not just me,
“Look, if it makes you feel any better, I am happy to go for this concert and after-party, but I’d suggest take Sherlock with us too. We haven’t gone out as a trio and I feel we must do that sometimes. You know, he shouldn’t feel I am hogging all your free time. Me and you together doesn’t mean there won’t be any more Holmes-Watson.”
Suddenly they saw Sherlock speaking to Mrs. Smallwood. They hadn’t noticed her join the group quietly. “Sherlock,” Mycroft called out, “Come on.” Sherlock raised his hand in acknowledgement and quickly wrapped up the conversation.
Yes, we often hear their laughter. Unbridled and refreshing, like the gushing waters of a brook or the pristine spring water that signals life, hope, love. For us they would always symbolize so.
“You row very well,” Sherlock said to John as they took a rowboat ride on the huge lake, “Seems like you knew the technique well.”
Jim acted with cool calculation and complete control, as he was used to, as Sherlock knew him to be. He pushed Sherlock back against the door and stood on tiptoes to kiss him hungrily on the mouth. At first Sherlock was shocked, then he fell into the honeytrap and kissed back, before it occurred to him that Jim didn’t mean any love here. He was simply displaying one of those ‘power-play’ moments where he had Sherlock right under his thumb! He disengaged quickly but not before Jim had bitten him on the lower lip, rather painfully. The copper taste of blood hit his tongue, as did the familiar scent assault his nostrils and Sherlock yelped and pulled back from Jim, clutching at his mouth. It hurt. It really did. For all his other faults and dominating habits, he had never been treated like this by Jim.
They came downstairs hand in hand, smiling and looking forward to the visitors and the day ahead. But a sudden and loud crack of thunder made Sherlock jump. The weather had worsened in the past half hour. A window in the house slammed hard and noisily.
He eyed the smooth buttocks spread out before him as Sherlock panted on all fours, hips moving back and forth in the same rhythm in which he was being fucked by his boyfriend. John grabbed at the pert cheeks, then bent down to place sucking kisses and little bites on them, then spread even further to watch the space, the central wet crack in which his huge cock kept appearing and disappearing. It was an erotic experience, exacerbated by the unusually loud and needy noises made by Sherlock who was almost relentless that afternoon.
“Here is the hatch,” Sherlock located it amidst some hedges, bushes and a garden light. Together they unlocked and pulled it open.”
In fourteen minutes Seb was there on the other bike and found Jim already there, sans the cage and with a helmet and biking gear on.
Sherlock would have given up had those growling cries and guttural grunts from John not sounded so sexy and delicious but even he had his limits. His arse was on fire and around dawn he eventually stopped John forcefully. “Jawn, stop, stop,
Sherlock emerged from a door of the office building, waving his arms and shouting. Behind him was Haines and Ben, a lawyer and also Dr. Mike Stamford. Ben was armed and was brandishing a gun, growing that he would anyone who harmed Sherlock or even John. A baffled senior official of the institution also followed them, shouting, “What are you doing guys? Lower the gun, lower it now. Everyone at their stations, let them meet. The chief is coming here, along with the superintendent. They will deal with this. Allow them to meet and talk.”
Sherlock felt his heart clench as he remembered his family. Like all families there were issues, arguments and disagreements, there was sulking, sighing and glares. But at the end of the day they were a family and they genuinely loved and looked out for each other. He cursed himself for forgetting that and focusing only on Jim, the lovely and lissome James Moriarty who had blinded him with his aura charm. How foolish had he been, how selfish too! Could he ever go back to them and ask for forgiveness, like Gretel just mentioned, and set things right? Will it become better and they’d be reconciled again? Or would they tell me ‘I told you so’ and blame him for trusting a wicked manipulator and taking such a big step for Jim???
. John stayed tight-lipped about makeover while Mary made a gesture of ‘awesome’ and said, “Way to go, sexy Shezza!”
“Stop it Mycroft,” Siobhan scolded him, “They are already suffering, don’t push them harder than this….. mam, papa, Uncle Reggie, is there nothing we can do? Should we look for that creature, should we go to that spot, what do we do?”
That was precisely why John Hamish Watson woke up that morning feeling rather ecstatic. He no longer lived in a shoebox flat.
She relented slightly and put her hand over his, pressing down gently. He looked at her properly for the first time.
“Of course not,” John said, “You should be with your family tomorrow. Hopefully next year even I will be part of the celebrations, the grand Christmas lunch and all that. Now, let’s celebrate Christmas a day early on my estate. I’ll ask my cook to prepare a grand Christmas Eve dinner feast.”
“You do realize Jimmy,” Sherlock said as they all went down the stairs, “That you do not have to break in. You are an invited guest. You have every right to walk in through the door. Oh by the way, you haven’t yet tried to break into the basement area and scaring old Hudders. Hee-hee!”
Sherlock heaved a sigh of relief. So this man wasn’t stalking him or harassing him. It was truly a very extraordinary coincidence. “No, I have come here for some information, actually information of a personal nature. I-I have a friend who works here. He hasn’t been around for a few days and I am a bit worried. So I thought I’ll check on him or at least if I get to know that he’s gone somewhere out of town…..”
“Oh please nana, no embarrassing childhood stories please,” John immediately intervened, then he took Sherlock’s hand and said, “By the way, meet the man responsible for this sudden change in me and who actually pulled my ears a bit. He is the one, the trigger and catalyst.”
“Me too,” John agreed, looking at the main street that ran past the inn and the ‘headwoman’s’ gardened Edwardian style house around the corner, “I wonder if he girls have better luck.”
“Um, no, not needed really. I was coming down anyways. I wanna go home now Sebby or maybe just for a ride on our boat. It’s a bit boring to stick around here without anything to do!”
In twenty minutes the two older men were convinced that whatever had happened between John and Sherlock had only brought them closer. Mycroft took an instant liking towards John and even accepted his invite to have dinner with them that evening.
John had some difficulty falling asleep that night. Maybe because the place was too quiet or too still or too dark. One or more of these factors. Or perhaps it was that strange feeling from the afternoon when, while entering the village, they had stopped to bury the animal and he had become aware of someone watching him keenly from the woods. His room was small but neat with a sloping roof on one side and two large windows which let in a lot of fresh and crisp breeze. The room was cool and airy, not cold, very comfortable to sleep with a light blanket on.
Sherlock was not having any of Phil’s possessive nonsense anymore. John’s return had emboldened him. “I am tired Phil and I need to rest. I had taken the day off and I had my personal work to attend to. Mrs. Hudson, please keep dinner in the fridge. I’ll have it tomorrow. You can take the day off tomorrow actually.”
“My brother in law was the man I was courted by and I mistakenly thought maybe he loved me and was going to marry me,” Rosalie murmured, her breathing problems making it difficult to talk constantly or louder, “I am not going to hide something from you, especially at this age and this stage of my life. I was pregnant when he abandoned me, resuming his playboy ways. It’s his brother who married me and adopted the baby as his own. No one got a whiff of it. My elder son turned out to be just like his father and John’s dad, who was my husband’s son, also became something very similar. The first one was worse, he shirked responsibilities and became violent if opposed. He was only forty-five when he was killed in a pub brawl in another part of the world.”
That was when an old lady, who had just finished purchasing some dog food and a chew toy, stepped past them and gave Jim and Sherlock a keen and somewhat condescending look.
Reginald was about to open his mouth again when Sherlock cleared his throat and said, “I discovered this quite by chance. I had broken into Mycroft’s house to retrieve a gadget he had confiscated from me earlier and found them….in the bedroom. It was late night and he was feeding him strawberries and cream…..ehm, in bed.”
“Sure thing,” John said happily and eagerly, “I look forward to your visit. I have made some plans with Sherlock for his birthday and I want to ensure Phil doesn’t cause any trouble or hindrances there. So I devised a clever plan. Along with Sherlock I shall invite him to lunch as well but not just for the meal. I have planned in advance for this and I’ll give him Treatment 222, according to your guidebook. It’s time for him to receive that! He just doesn’t seem to get the message that Sherlock is happy with me.”
. I am not his boyfriend Mrs. Hudson, nor am I someone he knows very well. In fact, we met just yesterday afternoon and
When Mike Stamford nodded with a grim expression John wiped his face with a towel and stood up on the exercise mat. “Christ! That man has been with us for ten years. He set up the charities. Then for the past seven he has been handling all the accounts, events and selections.”
“Well, well, well,” John grinned, “Now it makes sense to me. Alright then, let me finish up here so I can fulfil my promise to him. Mary, will you ask the kitchen staff to prepare a picnic basket for us please and to get the bikes out. No, not the regular bikes or mountain bikes, ask him to get the quad bikes out for Sherl and I.”
“I can’t even imagine this, to be frank it sounds scary and forbidding. I just hope this is nothing but just a myth, an old wives’ tale which is better heard by fireside than believed in. No one deserves such a fate, nobody at all. Imagine, they would be so miserable, spend their entire lives being unloved and alone. You know Jim, I am awed by all this but I’d rather not think about it anymore. It’s very disturbing.”
“No. I am a bit out of touch with the medical and surgery world but from what I remember last, this must be a multiple organ transplant and recovery process. Would easily take up to six to eight months, so it will also involve hospice care. Then there’s the expensive health insurance that she must take on, so she’s not compromised in this way again. Just fill in the rest of the details and send it to her as soon as you can. Mary or Gretel can help.”
“Goodnight,” he said, turning the light out on his way, “I shall see you at the breakfast table tomorrow at eight-thirty sharp. No breakfast in bed when there’s company to eat with.” The last thing he heard from her was a prayer, she was praying for his health and happiness.
He had understood already by then that John would need a lot of support at this juncture. The man was just about beginning to recover from his earlier depression and complexities, insecurities, angst and misfortunes in his personal life. To lose someone who was the last parental figure left in his life, it would be a big blow to the man. “Of course Mary, goes without saying,” Sherlock was in the bathroom, squeezing toothpaste on his brush, “I shall speak to him right away and be there next to Rosalie until he’s back. Thanks for letting me know about this tragedy. I truly appreciate it. I shall speak to you again soon, okay? You take care and try and get over this if you can. Enjoy the cruise and advance congratulations to you and Joseph for your wedding. Take care, I have to go now.”
Sherlock literally fell asleep in a flash. Soon he was breathing shallow and even, like a small child. He lay very still, eyes closed and a single hand sticking out of the covers, clutching at the edge of the pillow. Beams of the room lights and moonlight fell across his sleeping form and John had to admit, quietly to himself, that while he hadn’t exactly chosen Sherlock for his looks, that attractive face and long, flowing, sexy form was definitely a bonus!
“And Sherlock?” The DI raised his brows. He didn’t elaborate further but his questions dripped with connotations.
“Well, it’s red,” John said, “The color of the V-day theme. It’s delicate, like you are in bed. It’s unique and sexy, pretty much like you are.”
“Hey, it’s me,” Sherlock whispered whilst sitting on the stairs leading to the attic. He kept himself positioned at a spot where he could keep an eye on anyone who might come up here.
“Yes, good idea,” John agreed, “We’ll row back now….. And sorry about this. I know it’s very icky the way I threw up in that paper bag but I didn’t want to sully these clean waters or the bottom of the boat so….”
The springy thing made Sherlock’s body bounce and before Sherlock could even say ‘Jack Robinson’ he was stripped naked. Moments later he was being fingered and the detective moaned so loud that even the aroused John had to halt and request him to keep it down to some ‘decent’ levels. Sherlock didn’t really listen though. He was mounted like a bitch and he let it go, screaming and cursing as he was made to cum again and again by his studly partner who held on to his own climax till Sherlock was begging to be allowed to fall asleep. Only then John let go and filled Sherlock up to the point where he could hear the squish and squeak of his cock moving in his own prodigious cum.
“I….uh….so then tomorrow? Where should we meet? The church? Is that where you are staying or do you have any other address?”
As John wallowed in guilt and regret, Sherlock described the situation in an easy, carefree manner, showing his spirit was totally unscathed despite the violence he had been clearly subjected to. “Got surrounded by them because I couldn’t manage to inform the Yard guys on time. I mean, I did inform but I didn’t text them the exact location in…..plain language. Used Morse code, which you taught me partially, and ended up giving a slightly wrong spot. By the time they came, I had taken two down but the other three got on to me and I got thwacked around a bit. I think I also….ouch……” he stopped as John gently pressed his chest. Their eyes met and Sherlock nodded sheepishly, “Got a cracked rib as well, I think.”
He had purchased a thick gold band with a hammered finish for his beau. It had a diamond embedded on the crest, the shiny stone was set in the middle, a ruby and an emerald flanking it on either side. “I thought the emerald compliments his eyes and the ruby his lips. The eyes reflect the diamond’s brilliance. I had to pick it up, it was screaming out at me and seemed to be made for my man.”
John nodded, still overwhelmed. Mrs. Hudson introduced herself and the staff and John barely managed to reply. He just kept looking around in awe.
He wasn’t able to finish. A scintillating climax, which consumed him from top to toe, washed over him almost as a rogue wave in sea would overwhelm a ship, the latter too powerless to resist the direction and force of the wave. Supremely aware of his own loss of control and the sensational effects of his climax, Sebastian slammed his foot on the brakes, lifted his hips up hard, put his hand on Jim’s head and pushed him to take him in deeper. Then he shot, thickly enough to almost choke his lover before he let go of those dark locks. Jim pulled his head off the erupting cock just in time not to choke on the load and got a couple of shots across his cheek and his chin instead.
He was not a bisexual, which he often told himself he was. After a few one-night stands and several moments of deep-introspection, Mycroft realized he could only be friends with women. Even an affair wasn’t possible because both his physical and emotional orientation was entirely towards men and not the fairer sex. He often contemplated coming out to his parents but kept putting it off for a better time, a more appropriate moment etc, delaying the inevitable.
Mycroft found that lack of empathy a bit odd but his mind was on other things. So he quickly went to the café and joined the two men. The moment he sat there and saw Greg’s expression, he knew something was seriously wrong. “What happened here?” He asked, “Please don’t tell me it is something worse than what we just encountered.”
“Tell me the truth, why were you there?” John asked. A weird thought nagged at the back of his mind. You’re acting like a spouse John, you’re behaving like a typical partner who is the older and more stable one in the relationship. Friends don’t really go overboard when one of them indulges in a bit of a ‘hobby’. But he couldn’t stop himself from worrying about Sherlock, despite noticing that he looked perfectly normal.
“No, we struck a good bargain, it was a win-win deal. See, Jim needed someone who wasn’t in awe of him and could overrule him sometimes if need be. Mycroft is just that man. At the same time Mycroft isn’t me, he isn’t a kinky slinky bastard in bed, so when Mycroft is too busy and I am around, I still get to have that odd one night stand with him. Though he never stays back, he always leaves once we are done…..what happened? Too much detail? Too scandalous. Hello, this is 2012, not 1912. If Oscar Wilde lived in our times he would have been a reality star, a playwright, a BAFTA winning scriptwriter. Anything but a man who went to the gaol for being in love with another man.”
“Yeah, I am about to go mad and no one cares,” Sherlock stormed and raged, “Hudders has her life, you have your work, Lestrade refuses to give me cases, Mycroft has ensured no client can reach me and I am….just fucking stuck here all by myself. I am bored,
“My name is Gregory. Second name Lestrade. You can start with Mr. Lestrade. No need for this sirring. I am a bit squeamish about this.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened to the maximum possible. Was he seeing this right or was this all a dream, an illusion? John wanted to be taken???!!!
Both of them knew it was the brother speaking and not the Ranger but neither of them had either the boldness or the heart to explain that point to Mycroft Holmes.
“Strange,” Greg Lestrade commented as he and Mycroft Holmes sat in Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen, enjoying the long leaf oriental tea she had served as much as the delicious chocolate brownies with vanilla and caramel sauce which she had also provided as an accompaniment. She had seen them grow up, in shorts, therefore they shared a very different equation with her.
Sherlock moaned into the kiss and instantly kissed him back and John, already hard as a rock, grabbed the twin mounds of Sherlock’s bottom and squeezed hard. Another moan and Sherlock was swaying on his feet. John quickly spread out the thick picnic mat and lay down.
“We can’t just leave like this,” Irene issued a warning to both of them, “Seb and John will feel bad. Don’t forget, one is our boss and the other is your senior Molly. We can’t do these knee-jerk reactions and expect them not to be offended. And it was a one-off incident and it’s true that being on your own on that deserted highway was not a great idea really. If we’re careful, don’t venture out alone beyond a time in the later evening hours. Take the car, stick to the village. We should be fine.”
“I know about that, right? I have been there. We made a mistake and it took us several years to correct it. But eventually things get sorted out. If you have done the right thing, some power above will help you get to your destination. If your car breaks down, a trucker will give you a ride. If your boat develops a leak, someone will pass by on a raft and take you on. Just be there for him and I promise you, he’ll be there for you too.”
John nodded, amusement still written large on his face as he looked at what Sherlock was doing. The things Sherlock said to justify his eccentricities! In situations he described, there were many other needs that one had, including water, oxygen, shelter, medical supplies, even some amount of other foods to help sustain a natural balance in the body, but pemmican was most important, of course!
“I….what do I do?” Sherlock said, looking left and right, “As the crowd things they will notice what’s happened down there.” He looked decidedly more prudish and less brash than he had at the Buckingham Palace, where he had arrived in just a white sheet,
Mike Stamford was taken aback at the badge being flashed on to his face. “Superintendent Greg Lestrade,” he read out, “Scotland Yard Special Investigations. Homicide Department. DI Anderson and Sergeant Donovan. Okay, well, I was not expecting this visit. What’s it about?”
Eventually they did put up a reasonably good tree and Sherlock teased John about sticking to the lower branches while he added the ornaments and the star on the top. All surgeons at Barts had been given a Christmas gift hamper by the management and John utilized those items for an early festive celebration.
“No one just goes poof BB, we have to get to the bottom of this,” Sherlock opened the door and said, “Get in. We will get him back, don’t worry.” The gardener got in on the passenger’s side and the two zoomed under the portico, parking with the wheels still spinning. “Wait here,” Sherlock said to Ben, “I don’t want your mom to emerge from the kitchen and start fawning over you and asking if you’re feeling well.” He leapt up the stairs to the porch and inside the hall where he saw Lucy, one of the maids. She was humming a tune while dusting a large standing lamp and its ornate shade with a feather duster. “Lucy,” Sherlock asked, “Where is everyone? I mean…… Mrs. Hudson or Haines, where are they?”
Despite the assurance he had just given and his inner vows to keep this as professional and distant as possible, as soon as the car was out of sight John literally hotfooted back to the bedroom to be with Sherlock.
“Never mind,” John swallowed the emotions that had welled up in a lump at his throat, “It’s nobody important.”
Sherlock took in a deep breath and looked at Jim meaningfully, “Is it what we saw two weeks ago in the woods? At foot of the hill we live on? Remember, they were burying…..” Jim nodded, also remembering, “The other creature, the one we wanted to search and our fathers searched for, for several years and failed. Was it around? Is it…. is it dead? Maybe the evil was contained inside it while it was still there but when it died, that means-that means we are the only ones carrying this particular curse within ourselves. That is why the evil manifests in us in ways we haven’t known in the past few years. You are right, I find an unexplained joy in killing now, like the very sight of blood excites me.”
The sounds of two men wrapped up in their passion could be heard from several feet away as Jim and Sebastian kissed each other madly, deeply. They were at ‘Jim’s secret location’ which was some distance away, tucked between two cliffs and a number of minor hills, a shaded cove whose waters flowed into a very unique cavern. The roof of the cavern was partially open and one could see the skies above. Still, a large part of the cave was shaded and covered, giving the spot complete privacy.
Reeling under the irritation of being ordered about and remote-controlled like some clockwork mouse, Sherlock decided to get it over and done with. He had left the Watson ranch/hamlet on his own for the first time and he intended to spend some time buying a gift for John. No way was he going to just waste time with Jim, so the latter could keep condescending him constantly. He got the food and water and mints on a tray, choosing a small espresso for himself, and half slammed it on the table between their two chairs. “Go on, gobble up,” he scathed, “Do you want to buy the café too? Maybe I could convince John to buy a café as well, since he is so wealthy after all.”
Not used to being impressed easily, nor addicted to wealth and grandeur to the point of being awed by such a display, the young man didn’t offer an exuberant response. “It’s okay,” Sherlock remarked noncommittally as he observed the books closely, taking a couple of them out to look through them. She seemed amused and chuckled, stepping closer to him and looking over his shoulder at the books he had picked. “Just okay Sherlock? This is one of the grandiose mansions in this country, it’s literally a mini-palace. I was also told you love books so I chose to bring you here first and foremost. Still, just okay?!!”
“He is not a real addict. There were low phases in his life. He used to say he needed that…..heroin, I mean heroin, and sometimes cocaine, to think clearly and solve cases or finish a composition, complete a task at the lab. But-But don’t let that bother you, he has not lapsed in the past four years and I am sure this must be just a small…..”
He regretted his outburst immediately. Her eyes were filling with tears. Raising his hand in a gesture of honesty and sincerity he said, “Sorry, I said a bit too much. But I’m not okay with some things and you did cross the line. It was a bad idea trying to date someone at work……”
Fortunately for her, he relented immediately and like a gentleman and made her smile from ear to ear. “I shall be back in a jiffy, before you even know it,” she said with a wink and dropped a feather kiss on his cheek before heading out through the side door. A couple of smokers returned at the same time and as she stepped outside, she found herself alone in that narrow alley next to the nightclub. Only about twenty meters ahead was the main road and people were passing by even then, as were cars. It was a Friday night and nightlife here in this midsize town was not too bad. It was so vibrant and there were such varied options.
Realizing Sherlock needed some relief as well, John thrust in two fingers and probed a bit until he found the sweet little bundle of nerves inside the depths of his lover. He rubbed on it insistently and Sherlock groaned deep in his throat before undignified squeals came out of him. Moments later the fast-moving hips stilled and hot liquid spilled on to the sheets as the detective spread his long legs as wide as possible in a moment of ecstasy.
“Ohhh Goddd,” Sherlock felt a genuine pinch of sadness and shock, “Yesterday I was with her. She did appear a bit pale and was having mild breathing problems. The doctor checked but didn’t consider her condition serious enough to warrant a ventilator or even additional oxygen. She spoke to me for almost an hour. She called me…. I-I guess she must have felt something, she probably wanted to say goodbye.”
“Surv…ival….survival situationnnn….aaahh,” Sherlock went and grabbed John’s right hand, leading it to his erect cock that slapped noisily against John’s abs every time the detective rose and fell on him. John obliged, not asking any further. Whatever inhibitions he had about Sherlock putting up a tent in the middle of the room and making some odd medieval survival food was totally gone with the latest developments. He found it rather nice and arousing to have sex on the sleeping bag, with the tent shaking around them. Even though he knew this was make believe it gave an impression of fucking during a campfire night and it stoked his libido and desires a notch higher.
“Stop-Stop-Stop,” John said loudly, covering his ears and blushing bright red as Mrs. Hudson walked in with the food and they could hear Mr. and Mrs. Holmes downstairs, “Why am I even listening to details of your sex-life?”
Sebastian didn’t show any signs of being nervous or anxious. He didn’t even mind the slight jabs made about the posh folks even though he was one of them and was surely included in that snark. He said in a completely normal and calm tone, “It was supposed to be a first anniversary present for us, myself and my lawfully wedded darling husband. Since the watch was available in two different hues I got the pure rose gold one with the champagne dial for myself and the platinum chain, emerald colored dialed model for Jim. Jim’s my husband by the way. Yes, I happen to be a man who comes from old money but I have earned quite a bit for myself. Me and Jim, we started a bank and today it’s one of the best on the block and has branches across the continent and more than five thousand employees.”
When the procedure finished, the doctor had an accomplished look on his face. “There,” he said nonchalantly, “Easy peasy! You will be much better soon. What? What happened? Something bothering you?”
Traded insults. He told me with all the recipe books and instructions I read I should be somewhat okay at cooking. I told him with all the porn he watches he should get better at fucking.
John said gently, “With all due respect, Mr. Lestrade, a man’s inner persona should be the answer to his woes. No cigarette or pipe can make up for it or fill-in the missing blanks.”
“No, it’s even more telling. I know they’re…. um, they are spending nights together…. Same room. That says something, doesn’t it?”
John was caught in a weird situation where he was stuck between a rock and a hard place, literally. Being next to his housemate while they were doing some self-service was mortifying but what made this even worse was that he was hard too, hard as a rock and erect as a pole, and felt a strangely compelling need to jerk off side by side with the other man. As soon as that thought occurred to him, John closed his eyes and held his breath, hoping he didn’t give Sherlock the impression he was awake. No way was he going to be able to handle this situation without making it worse and more embarrassing. Best option was to stay quiet, pretend to be asleep, and hope Sherlock fell asleep soon after he had cum.
“Don’t have to. I’ll open an account in Citibank, where you and I will be join-account-holders. This cheque goes right there. That’s why I asked them to name us both. Let’s build your fortune elsewhere, not through those Mycroft-curated accounts. Only thing, you trust me right?”
“How about my cock,” John whispered hotly into Sherlock’s ear and felt the tremor that ran down the younger man’s body, “Along with your favorite vibrating toy…..ohh, eager are we?” Sherlock had thrust the toy into John’s hand already. Apparently he had it under the pillow all the time. John kissed his lover’s bottom and rolled him over, staring into those dazed blue-green eyes, “How did you know?”
Eurus and Siobhan stared at their feet in embarrassment and consternation. They knew the man had a point.
She peered into the narrow and small hallway between the kitchen and the bedrooms on the other side. But she heard sounds from the bathroom instead, right next to the kitchen and on the same side of the hallway.
“Love doesn’t work all the time. Sometimes it isn’t even enough…. Do you have any idea what I went through? What my family went through all because of me?!”
John finds out something that helps him label Sherlock, Mary and himself according to their present situations. One is furious, one is oblivious and one is doomed.
Sherlock shifted a little uncomfortably, “I got injured yesterday. It’s nothing to worry at all. Just a minor and little gash on my right upper arm. But it’s difficult to wear clothes on top of that, stings a bit.”
Moments later he got the confirmation automatically as a near naked John, with only his underwear on and an unbuttoned shirt, came stumbling down the corridor and the grand hall much like Sebastian had come downstairs a minute ago. His pants were in his hands and so were his shoes. “Oh thank God you have your pants on,” John panted when he saw his friend, hopping from one foot to the other to get the pants on. “Yeah I do but thank God you have your shoes on. I don’t and I think I have also injured my……” he tried to stand up and went loudly, ‘Ouch!’
