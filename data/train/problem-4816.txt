"You're never going to get any sleep just staring at those screens. It’s bad for your eyes, don’t you know that?"
And with that, Steve was gone, half vaulting himself over the edge of the bunk onto the floor. He didn’t look back to see if Tony was following.
With the lights out, Tony felt Steve climb into the adjoining bunk and get comfortable. It was another twenty minutes before his eyes had adjusted well enough to see past the glowing light of his screen. When he did dare to look up, he was surprised to see a pair of eyes staring back at him in the dark.
"Oh, sorry, am I keeping you up?" Tony reflexively dimmed the light of his screen as far down as it would go.
Right now it was hard to think of anything other than the warm, even breath of the man beside him, ghosting gently over his shoulder. Tony found that the more he focused on it, the more his own breathing slowed to match it, and his body subconsciously relaxed. Before he realized what was happening, he had drifted off to sleep.
The next morning, Tony woke slowly. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt so warm and comfortable. He wasn’t about to give it up just because his brain decided it was done sleeping.
Tony hurriedly scooped up his things and disappeared into the next room. Climbing up to the bunk next to Steve's, he dumped his stuff unceremoniously onto the mattress. "Mind if I crash here?"
A sudden shift of something next to him had him reevaluating his position with lightning speed. Now fully awake, Tony tensed, remembering the situation he found himself in the night before. This was Steve’s bed, presumably with Steve still in it. Tony peeked one eye open, turning his head slightly to try and determine the status of his bedmate.
“I think we both know you can’t be trusted with all those toys of yours over there. Why don’t you just stay here for the night? Relax. Get some real sleep.”
Nat called out to him again from her perch above the mess. "Jesus, you don't have to move your whole bunk Tony, just. Go. Sleep. In. His."
After a brief moment of thought, Tony turned the screen off his tablet and set it aside. Semi-blind in the sudden darkness, he carefully climbed his way over to Steve's bunk.
Tony barely glanced up from his tablet, but she knew he had heard, because after a few minutes he began methodically packing up his stuff.
Steve came back from discarding his hoard of empty bottles and stretched. "Well, I'm done for the night. Mind if I turn off the lights?" Tony shook his head, already curled up once again around his tablet.
Before he could even think of what to say, Tony felt something pulling him down, awkwardly, to the warm mattress.
Tony shivered at the calm, even tone of Steve's voice so close to him. It was cramped, with the two of them squeezed into a single bunk, but not entirely uncomfortable. Tony briefly wondered if he’d ever had this level of contact with anyone, ever. Unlikely.
Tony huffed a laugh "Between the people in this room which one is A) wearing a spangly outfit and B) of no use?" He said a bit harshly, gestured to Rogers. They glared heatedly at each other until Bruce piped up from the corner.
‘Please, like I need it.’ He scoffed mentally. He hoped Rogers didn’t think they were pals just because they had worked together and saved each other’s ass.
Pepper was quiet for a minute. Tony wanted to reach out to her, comfort her. But he was the one who had caused her to be in pain.
It grated on Tony’s nerve and he whirled around sharply, his eyes sad, hurt and angry. "ARE YOU MOCKING ME?!” Tony snapped angrily. Steve fell silent, confused by Tony accusation. He could see both the unshed tears and Tony’s will to fight blazed hot as molten iron in the forge.
The worst part was the dreams, for a few hours each night he got to feel what it feels to have Steve only to return to hellish reality. He was so sick of hurting, he wished he didn't love Steve half as much as he did, but he couldn’t stop. God knew, he had tried. Thankfully, his sense of responsibility overpower his urged to drown his sorrow with alcohol or he would have turned to alcoholism again.
Rolled back onto his feet, he launched himself toward Thor, grabbed him by the arm and cape and swung him into another tree.
It was amazing Pepper didn’t address the elephant in the room yet. She probably thought he was having PSTD like after Afghanistan and the fight with Obie. Amazingly he wasn’t, that was the only good thing with the soul-bond, even when he was dying in space he felt like he wasn’t alone, that Steve was there with him, reached to him, protected him. It was a nice illusion.
‘So what, you’re hardly the only one, everyone knew what a monster I am. The Merchant of death who grew rich on the foundation of millions of innocent’s death, the biggest killer in America.’ Tony thought.
The portal shrank and Steve couldn’t breathe, a large part of him wanted to stop trying to. The super-soldier turned away, unwilling to watch the portal shrinking, locking Tony away forever.
Familiar barrier slid into place. “But it didn’t change anything, Captain.” Each word fucking hurt. Tony was in hell, pushing Steve away was ripping out part of him. “I still not going to let a stupid bond dictate my life. You shouldn’t either. You are only 26. You should go out with a bunch of people. Enjoy life.” Tony managed through what felt like a mouthful of sawdust, of chalk, of razor blades. Even the thought of Steve with someone else pain him beyond words but Steve deserved to be happy, Steve deserved everything. Every single brain cell knew he was doing the right thing since the only thing he could offer Steve was broken shards of himself. Sure some part of him believed he could rip open his chest and just hand over his heart to Steve like it was not going to kill him but that part was obviously deranged.
It was a lot like his old apartment only much bigger. He smiled at the thought Tony had been keeping a tab on him. The wooden furniture only lightly finished, but the bed was soft and fluffy, warmly covered in a dark blue duvet. There was a small couch he liked the look of. The book shelves by the desk were fill with all manner of books -novels, biographies, anthologies of poetry, even books on genetics and robotics pass. There was a large blackboard for him to pin up tactics and different training scenarios.
Tony thought he heard Steve’s heart-wrenching begged. Guilt again, as sharp as the cut of a whip, melded with sadness, fused with fear for Steve. “JARVIS, save the rest of the suit’s power for the return.” Tony commanded, trying to be optimistic even though both he and JARVIS knew the odds of him surviving were non-existent.
Tony broke the chain Howard had over him when he was 17. What he didn’t see is the chain Obie had on him. Leading him to continued Howard weapon business despite never liking or has any attachment to weapon. No Tony love making things like circuit board, as in computer, car engines, robots and A.I. If he had been anyone else’s kid, or allowed to make his own choices, he would’ve gone the route of Steve Jobs, or Bill Gates. He never really cared about weapons.
The strong disapproval tone of the Alpha made his stomach churned. It irritated Tony, he was not going to let the bond or fucking Rogers told him what appropriate or not.
Anthony gurgled what was supposed to be a growl, his eyes rolled into the back of his head as his back arched, the pleasure doubling.
Now that was the most thrilling thing he ever heard. His head felt light and his legs wobbly: who would have known a man could get drunk in a lady’s good opinion.
Tony has always been beautiful, but the force of it punches the air out of Steve’s lungs. Even then, it doesn’t matter that Tony is beautiful with his downy hair and precariously constructed confidence, because to Steve, he will always be
“Nah, ‘cause that would require you asking for help in the first place,” Sam says. It’s not mean, merely observing. “You gonna do it, then?”
“I’m not going to make fun of you,” Tony says lightly, and he studies the picture, really studies it, intently looking at the group shot from Peggy’s funeral. They’d all reconvened in the suite Tony had booked for the occasion, once old man Rogers had retired from the festivities and they’d all been a little too buzzed on camaraderie to willingly separate. “Hey, remember when you found Wanda crying in the bathroom?”
“You will need him,” Steve says. “And he will need you. And if you do not tell him, you will not be there when the world needs the Avengers.”
“If I wasn’t leaving, you were,” Steve points out. “After Loki, we all split. You left after Ultron. You didn’t exactly keep in touch. I got the message after that.”
“I tried so hard to do everything right,” he says once he can speak, so quiet that he isn’t entirely sure that Tony can hear. “I tried to do everything right, because with you I did everything wrong, and - ”
part to focus properly, illicit scenarios lighting through his brain like wildfire, and he coughs into a fist while rocking back and forth on his heels, hoping to get rid of whatever way he’d been looking at Steve that had made him offer up an alternative.
Precisely three dry-heaves later, Tony does exactly as recommended. It’s disgusting, bitter-tang invading Steve’s nostrils as he closes his eyes and leans a shoulder against the inside of the stall. He keeps his hand on the back of Tony’s neck, belatedly aware that it’s too personal of a gesture, but supposes that Tony’s drunk enough to not mind. After all, it’s not like the touch is intended as anything more than a simple grounding.
“No - I mean, yeah. Yeah, I know her. Knew her, really, but we were never close. Everhart worked at the office with me before she wormed her way into stuff like this, that was all.” Christine looks almost exactly as she had when he saw her last, roots touched up and sporting a rather shocking amount of bare skin for a spot on a national news station. She’d transitioned to screen by starting local before quickly landing a position on one of the popular morning shows, and now she routinely features on the national news channels with reports on whatever political issue she’s deemed worth investigating.
“Do you know why I said no before? When you tried to show off the suit?” He keeps it all tightly reined in, the fire and ice in his veins all at once, signaling an end that he’s decided to run into.
“And you don’t want to be an Avenger without me,” Tony says, carefully watching Steve for a reaction. He stays frustratingly unruffled though, hands settling on his hips as he licks his lips before speaking.
“I’m sure he’s got his reasons,” he says diplomatically, sitting back down on the bench across from Tony.
“Rhodey!” Tony says, all exaggerated delight, and Steve hates that he can gauge how genuine Tony being at almost any given time. “Where’ve you been all night?”
Rogers is a grown man, Tony decides savagely, as he swipes a jam-and-brie canape from a passing tray. He can handle himself.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Rogers is hardest to convince to take up residence at Stark Tower. He’s been resisting it the longest, and only gives in once Natasha convinces him that Tony is one of the better landlords in the five boroughs.
They move to D.C. for SHIELD. The distance from the Starks does them good, and Peggy travels less. She is a saint, Steve thinks, when one day late in June he weeds the garden he’d started shortly after the move. He wipes sweat off his forehead and leans against the white picket fence, aware that he’s being watched from the window. This summer is shaping up to be a particularly warm one, wet enough that he barely needs to water the cosmos flowers, climbing high and flowering magenta-red and pale orange and sunny yellow.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, taking great care not to drop the contents of the plastic bottle as he climbs out of the window and sticks out his thumb, rubbing it along his eyelids.
“Tony.” He’s too short, not willing to tolerate Tony’s cleverly disguised avoidance now that the cat is out of the bag. There’s no point in playing it safe anymore. “I don’t think we should see each other again.”
He could cry, but instead he laughs and listens to the teenage boys talk about Manny’s newest girlfriend and Zeke’s upcoming birthday. When they’re approached by another couple of teenagers - pretty, confident, looking like everything is dandy and their lives have gone untouched - he adopts a defensive posture immediately.
The sun creates a halo around his head, golden and ephemeral and animating all the auburn strands woven in amongst the darker brown. Steve can see the way the light catches and bends, near blinding in its beauty and the hairs startlingly prism-like for something so alive.
“I love you,” comes Steve’s response, and this time neither of them hide their smiles as they kiss a little too inappropriately for the current time and place. Tony hooks a knee over Steve’s leg and forgets about his coffee for a second, the stirring in his chest and his hastily thrown-on pajama pants enough to tug him into more alert territory. Steve slides a wide palm up the inside of his thigh, hot even through the fabric, and Tony’s got half a mind to cover it with his own palm and urge him onward until the sharp trill of a bicycle bell jolts them back into the present.
“C’mon,” Tony wheedles, faceplate snapping up. “Anyone else in the world would kill for this opportunity.”
Rhodes chokes on a tortilla chip at that, and when Carol merely entertains Tony’s staring contest, Wanda is kind enough to dislodge the chip and restore Rhodes’ ability to breathe.
Steve doesn’t answer him, though, not in the verbal sense. He just moves swiftly and assuredly, and that’s how Tony knows he means it and doesn’t end up instinctively scrambling away as Steve comes at him. There’s a warm and heavy touch at the back of his neck, firm but not forceful, and Steve positions himself precisely so that when he leans in, his lips land squarely on Tony’s.
“So?” Christine’s voice breaks through his thoughts unpleasantly, and he does his best not to loudly sigh in her general direction. “Who’s buying you stuff?”
Never before has he considered himself a coward, but the problem is, if he’d asked, he’s fairly certain he knows what Tony would’ve said. Tony would’ve given him the truth, and that would’ve meant no more living in the dark about what it really means to be in love with a billionaire he’s now met a grand total of three and a half times.
“Did you know you’d come out of the wormhole?” It’s not Steve’s most pathetic attempt at redirection, but it’s pretty close, and he tries to recover some of his dignity by snagging a few passing caviar-topped something-or-other while Tony blinks.
He swears he sees the tops of Tony’s cheeks twinge barely red, but then Morgan spills pancake batter down her front, and that requires tending to.
Things change. People change, and they see Howard less often as he gets involved with new ventures that Steve and Peggy don’t quite approve of. He plays the role of doting husband as well as he has been, unofficially helping Peggy wherever she’ll allow, and they keep each other going.
“Depends,” Tony says, word drawn out. He rocks side to side on the bench they’re occupying, slow and creaking with a jab of his index finger to Steve’s thigh before he settles upright. “Pot.
Steve just rolls up his sleeves and offers to help, and before Rhodes can finish asking him to scoop avocados for guacamole, Carol is pushing a pitcher into his chest.
“Some might think that you must have a mighty large ego to assume that you’re the only thing that can stand between planet Earth and total destruction.”
Steve had shoved the magazine back under the bed and let the not-a-relationship fade into mutual indifference.)
It feels good, though. Steve’s nails along Tony’s hairline, just light enough to make him want more, to make him want to close his eyes and hum into it and beg for something that he can’t quite put a name to but is unattainable nevertheless.
“Well, yes,” Pierce says, leaning back against the edge of his too-large desk and crossing his arms over his chest, still holding the damn remote. The volume is too loud.
Yeah. Considering what happened last time, drinking alcohol with Tony is going to fall under the highly ill-advised category.
“I don’t work for TIME,” he says, eventually, once it sounds like she’s done. He slurps at his drink, lukewarm and definitely not meant to be consumed outdoors in near-freezing temps. “So I’m really not sure why you’re contacting me.”
“You didn’t bring me here just to tell me about some unrequited tragic love story,” he says, unable to keep the awe out of his voice. “You brought me here to tell me that you love me.”
He rocks back on his heels as they come to an intersection, and Pepper wordlessly indicates that she intends to continue heading straight, so he waits at the light with her.
“We’re just trying to get along,” Steve says, but suddenly it feels suspect. “Morgan’s been with us the entire time.”
It’s an expert diversion, almost like she knows, which seems impossible but nothing ever really is where Natasha is concerned. He denies her the pleasure and waits, wondering if he can finally plant the apple trees he could never fit in his yard in D.C., and looks over once he realizes that he doesn’t even know how sustenance works in this world.
Under a luxurious white duvet and smelling of expensive botanical hotel shampoo, Steve can’t seem to close his eyes. His fingers want to navigate through his phone and craft convoluted questions, but he doesn’t have Tony’s number, only Pepper’s, and he’s not about to use it. There’s Twitter, but he knows without having to
“Banner took off with my favorite jet,” Tony’d said, a scowl hiding a tender bruise of an emotion. “And since Speedy Gonzales keeps reminding me that if last year’s model happens to crap out in the middle of the ocean, he’s kind of the only one without flight capabilities - ”
“He can come without needing to work,” Tony cajoles, and his arm flops like a fish-out-of-water in Steve’s direction, almost as if he wants to reach out but changes his mind at the last minute. “You like a good party, don’t you?” He directs that last bit at Steve who clears his throat, unsure of what answer is expected from him.
“You’ve at least got to let me pick your brain about the time travel,” Tony attempts to compromise on his way out the door, once Steve’s packed him a bag of rosemary and rubber-banded asparagus bundles, the spring still too cool for the cosmos to take root. “You can’t just dangle that in front of me, it’s absurdly unfair.”
Steve is no longer alone. There’s a presence beside him, one that refuses to fade as adamantly as he refuses to look, unwilling to be wrong about this. It’s an aura that he recognizes, one that calls to him in a tricky maneuver of instinct older than he is.
Tony squints at him, partially in disbelief but mostly because he can’t get a read on the guy for the life of him. There’s an urge to make fun of the same person who voluntarily donated his live body to science, but he just sips his own drink - from the rim, like a normal person - and waits for another potentially less offensive thought to enter his brain.
“I guess we were the only ones believing you might have crossed over,” Natasha says, eyes flicking over to Tony, who is impressively stoic.
“Sweetheart,” Pepper says, sipping her wine as she watches her daughter pull a yogurt smoothie off a shelf. “Do you remember Steve?”
Steve lets him have a minute. Steve takes his dead weight without complaint and sweeps his fingertips along the length of Tony’s spine, and it gives him chills.
The funeral is still held in England, where he had known Peggy longed to rest long before she ever admitted it.
“Was I selfish?” he gasps out, and he’s already been kneeling at the side of their bed, but he feels like he’s collapsing into the ground. “Coming back to you?"
“I know,” Tony assures him, and Steve relaxes, arms settling back into position. “What, you’re not having any regrets, are you?”
It’s not a question. Natasha just smiles back sadly while their glasses are refilled, and throws one back with him in solidarity. It’s just as nasty the second time around, but Steve needs to have been numb hours ago. By the time he’s done fighting back the urge to gag, he notices that she’s got her phone out.
“You’ve got a shitty poker face,” Christine informs him, glancing over. “Are you really telling me you wouldn't sleep with him, given the chance? I’ve heard he does swing that way. Occasionally.”
“I’m only doing as instructed,” she interrupts, and yeah, okay, he’ll concede that she lacks the tendency towards social niceties that Pepper had resolutely stood by, and he respects it. “If you’re looking to decline, I’ll inform Mr. Stark so he can proceed accordingly.”
Steve rests a hip against the counter and runs a hand through his hair. He’s in dire need of a proper cut and shave, but Alexa likes rubbing her face against his beard, says it feels funny. Besides, after what happened at the mall all those months ago, he likes being able to go places incognito.
“You must have been thinking of us,” she says, and there it is, that look that promises unspoken secrets, and he’s missed her so, so much.
Beth shrugs and takes a long drink of peach milkshake. “I don’t know, that’s just what she told Bonnie.”
He hadn’t meant to ask it quite like that exactly, but something similar had been in his head and now he’s rather glad that he didn’t get the opportunity to voice it.
“So,” he says, having to nearly shout to be heard clearly. His cheeks warm when Tony leans in to hear him, cataloging the furrow between his eyebrows while hesitating and parsing through his words. “This must be a pretty typical night for you.”
(And yeah, maybe Tony hasn’t exactly been subtle about his thoughts on the matter, but that’s neither here nor there.)
Josie forces him to buy things for himself, saying his clothes are wearing at the seams and making him look like a hobo. She sends Elliot with him, and Zeke and Manny want to tag along with their pocket change, and they stop in the mall food court before they head back. Steve buys them each a giant cinnamon roll and it’s the closest he’s felt to normal since before Siberia.
There’s really no good argument against that, so Steve nods once. Tony turns around, some sort of signal that has the driver opening the front door and coming around to open the back for them. Steve crosses the distance with measured steps and pours all of his concentration into standing perfectly still as he waits for Tony to finish getting in the expansive leather backseat. He doesn’t watch as Tony undoes the button of his jacket, launching sideways to sprawl heavily, but he does hesitate because he knows that as good of a show Tony might be able to put on, he’s not of sound judgment and Steve doesn’t want to allow a grave error to take place.
“You’re hilarious,” Steve says with not a hint of humor as he sets his free hand on his hip, feeling his toes curl into the soles of his shoes. “Absolutely fucking hilarious.”
It’s not significant, he tells himself sternly as he ends the call, barely remembering to say goodbye. It’s
“You kind of made an announcement on live television,” Steve reminds. “And you haven’t been seen with him since.”
He’s still holding his latte, he remembers, only he’s adjusted to accommodate Tony, which means that the inside of his left arm is all pressed up against Tony’s side, half under the flapping of his suit jacket. There are too many clothes, he thinks desperately as Tony opens his mouth to allow for the ordinarily objectionable Eau-de-coffee breath to waft up and momentarily interrupt the salon-garbage-wind smell, except that thought is all wrong because there are just as many clothes as there should be.
The door is pushed open, nearly noiselessly, and Steve turns his head to see Peggy who appears to be equal parts uneasy and unsurprised.
he simultaneously feels things he hasn’t felt in years and things he’ll swear he’s never felt before, but yeah,
“How do you feel about a Reuben?” Tony asks, tapping his fingers against the never-ending menu. “Do you think it’s too early for a bagel with lox?”
“Yeah,” Tony says, sitting up straighter. “Because the way I figure, it’s one of two things. One,” - he holds up an index finger, again - “it’s worse than the whole brainwashed buddy sob story, which at this point, wouldn’t really surprise me. If Natasha’s SHIELD data dump taught me anything, it’s that even I’ve got a lot to learn in that particular area. Or two,” - he flicks up his middle finger, then pointedly folds down the first finger, earning an eye roll from the man sitting in front of him - “it’s not bad but you still don’t want me to know about it, which begs the question of why, and means it’s probably worth putting on a little puppy dog face and playing the dead parents card in order to get it out of you.”
, and he presses in to get a better angle, to get in deeper, because if this is real, he’s not missing the opportunity to give it all he’s got.
“You know,” Tony says, while Steve is still wondering if he’s missed something, some kind of explanation for why Tony has cornered him in the corner of the grand lobby of Stark Tower which is currently transformed into some sort of formal wonderland complete with gold balloons and tiny little hors d’oeuvres with French names that would be unpronounceable if Steve wasn’t the type to remember the basics of the foreign language requirement part of his degree. Tony nudges Steve’s hand, the one gripping the stem of the champagne, with the back of his own champagne-wielding hand. It’s cursory, but Steve flinches and earns a momentary frown for his trouble. “Like in a press conference,” he clarifies. “I open up the floor, you raise your hand, I call on you. ‘Yes, you there. With the hair of a thousand - ’”
“Steve.” Pepper is tapping away at her phone with one hand while nudging Tony with the other, some unspoken language exchanging between them as he shifts out of the way so she can settle into the car. Steve starts, jolting upright as he remembers that there are more than two people gathered in the tiny bit of space he’s on the fringe of. “I can put you on the guestlist for the party we’re having for the grand opening in a couple of weeks. There will be half-decent catering, just bring some form of identification, and I’ll make sure you get a couple of exclusive comments for a piece. If your editor is interested in that sort of thing, of course.”
He leaves out the part where Tony had thrust the reactor at him, in a room not far from where they currently are. He doesn’t want Tony to know how another him had so scornfully, so
Rogers looks down at where he’s about to fit nearly half an egg in his mouth in one go and lowers his fork with a sheepish, stilted half-smile.
But Tony hugs him goodbye, and Steve holds him close, and the bands seem to fall away. He can breathe. It’s amazing how the panic recedes, how the anxiety ebbs away until he stands up and feels at peace.
“I said I would,” Steve says, and Tony is slipping away, one body part after another until Steve is reminding himself that this isn’t a loss that requires lamentation. The last to go is his hand in Steve’s, but before it does, he catalogues the sensation of knuckles pressed into the center of his abdomen. “I'd like to think I'm a man of my word.”
“Good,” Steve says, fully relaxed into the depths of the couch. “Dead on my feet. Not ready to deal with everything ahead of us.”
“Different,” Rogers says, carefully cutting into a thick slice of Challah French toast. “Better than the egg white omelet, though.”
Steve rolls his eyes and Tony grins, impossibly wide, and Steve presses his lips together so he doesn’t end up mirroring him.
“I’ll have the car come around,” Tony says, and Steve can’t imagine a world in which that’s no problem at all. It’s surreal, to think about cars at his beck and call and flying armor and flying androids and super-powered individuals. It’s an environment that Steve couldn’t slot into for longer than an afternoon even if he wanted to, even if Tony let him.
“Tony,” he says, because he’s even more tired than he was after he married Peggy, more so than when he asked an alternate Tony to send him back where he came from. “Look at where I am. Look at where I ended up. Think about who it was that inspired me to go and get a life, the only life I thought I could have.”
“I’m serious,” Tony says, limbs akimbo as he attempts to straighten his ass on the seat and settle his feet on the floor. “Get in, or I’ll tell Joe here not to leave until you do.”
This world is the one he gets to stay in, permanently, in all of its blazing glory, and that’s nothing short of a goddamn miracle after everything he’s been through.
Tony links their fingers together, and gradually their tendons and ligaments relax until their joined hands rest easy.
Steve must hear the bruises in his tone, because he knocks their shoulders together and smiles brilliantly. Jesus, his teeth are appallingly white.
It’s not that late, Steve thinks, as he rubs the sleep out of his eyes and rubs a hand over Serena’s head. He gets up and takes in the usual morning chaos, lost for how he managed to sleep through as much as he did, but then stops in his tracks.
Steve just nudges the back of Tony’s hand with his, a comfort before they have to go in and break the news. It’s not a bad thing, Tony’s certain they won’t be disappearing forever, they just need a mental breather so they can regroup and apparently that’s a thing that they need to do together, but he knows it’s going to shake things up for everyone.
“That’s very admirable,” she tells Tony indulgently. Then, to Steve, “I’m afraid I must go see Jarvis for a bit. SHIELD business. Would you prefer to come along with me?”
He’d known what he’d said back then, back when he was high on adrenaline and infatuated beyond belief. He’d made promises he couldn’t keep, taken actions he’d come to regret, and had generally made a clusterfuck of things ever since.
“I don’t know what to say to him,” Steve admits. They’d come so close to patching things up, so close to reaching what they’d never really had before, and then -
“You think I don’t know?” Steve asks, leaning back in his armchair, listening to Peggy’s even breathing as she naps in the bedroom. He sips his lemonade while Fury watches him more intently than anyone with two functioning eyeballs.
There’s sticky baklava at a summer barbecue, and Steve sneaks neatly cut pieces every time he walks past and looks positively devastated when Maria Hill swipes the last of it.
“Forget ‘you can sleep when you’re dead,’ you don’t need to sleep anymore. You’re not off the hook yet, Rogers.”
“You’re impossible to ‘no comment,’” Tony says, hands flinging all over with his suddenly nearly-empty champagne flute sending faint splatters of sticky liquid all over. Steve angles away as subtly as he can, wanting to return the rental in as pristine a condition as possible. “With your blue eyes, and the whole boy scout thing you’ve got going on.”
Tony’s chin is dipping wildly, his story-telling skills rendering him utterly captivating as Steve sets his champagne down on the table and commits every word to memory.
“Thought you’d be interested in hearing what they had to say about Stark,” Sam says frankly. “You two have got some kind of history, don’t you?”
“Tony,” he asks, determined to know, “did you want me to come here so I could get to know your kid?”
“Absolutely not,” Tony interrupts. “I’ve been paying contractors obscene rates in order to get a pool and outdoor kitchen up and running by the time you get here. There is no way - you do not need to chaperone. The number of bodies in that house count as more than enough birth control. I can
So he nestles in, head tucked right under Steve’s chin, and happily resigns himself to basking in the afterglow.
“You want one?” Tony asks before Steve can fully collect himself, his signature attitude back as he angles smoke in the direction of a pretty brunette dressed in red. “No one would have to know.”
In bed, Steve grips Peggy’s hand so tight he’s afraid she might break. She doesn’t say anything, doesn’t complain, not until his hold eventually loosens.
Once in the air, Tony lets FRIDAY take over the controls and they sit in the cockpit and debate whether or not it would be irresponsible to have sex without another human available to pilot in case of an emergency. As much as Tony argues that he can tap out and take over for FRIDAY in an instant, Steve’s seen enough to justify his reasonable doubt and they end up just talking with Tony half-curled against his chest.
“You idiot,” Tony says, but it’s so fond it makes Steve’s insides twist pleasantly. “What the hell did you do?”
Those goddamn brown eyes narrow, and all the air whooshes out of Steve’s lungs as he bobs a little too low, coming perilously close to getting water up his nostrils like a fucking idiot who’s too dazed by the man in front of him to swim properly.
“I don’t know where he is right now,” Steve says, amused. “Focus on finding Bucky, and getting Wanda’s powers under control.”
“You can bring her back for dinner,” Tony says, and Steve collapses onto the couch. By the time his embarrassment has ebbed, Tony’s doing the same, a safe distance away. “Tell me you and your super-soldier hearing missed that entire conversation.”
“No one said you had to get up with me,” Steve reminds him, and Tony grumbles incoherently, safely assuming that Steve will get the gist of it. He does, or he must, because he just wraps an arm around Tony’s shoulders to pull him into his side. “He cared about the garden. The least we can do is get it up and running again.”
Steve doesn’t have to think about his answer to that, but he does pause to make sure it comes out the right way. “I think you’ve always been as nice as you’re capable of.”
“Great,” Steve says, still thumbing at his phone and patting his front pockets to ensure he’s got his wallet. “Just let me lock up, and we can get going.”
“I'll be there at six,” Steve accepts victoriously, mentally fist-pumping. It doesn’t matter that the timing is almost too late to be professional, what matters is getting into
“Well, obviously,” Steve says, lips curling into a sarcastic smile. “Obviously we all hate them. Why do you think we’re here?”
“Absolutely not,” Tony says with a shake of his head. His hair is shorter, Steve notices. It must fit under the Iron Man suit better this way - less chance of flopping into his eyes and obscuring his vision mid-flight. “You know me, avoids responsibility at all costs. But since Pep dragged you down here - ”
Steve finds the convention center downtown and parks his bike, staring. There’s nothing to indicate what the building is being used for, but he glances at the newspaper in hand to confirm he’s in the place in the accompanying photo. He holds it up, comparing, and just as he’s decided to approach, a young woman pokes her head out of a pair of doors.
It figures that Rogers hasn’t eaten in just as long, and Tony raises an eyebrow as he shakes out a packet of brown sugar for his oatmeal.
Steve ends up in the middle of the couch as Ratatouille begins to play on the tv, with Charlie on his left, Christina in his lap, and Beth on his right. Bonnie wiggles her way on the floor near Tony, who’s got Jackson and Serena leaning into him. The older boys are still acting like they’re too cool to hang all over Tony, but the way they’re watching what they’ve previously deemed a “kiddie movie” while they could be doing anything else gives them away.
“Is there anyone that’ll be looking for you?” Steve asks, determined to stick around only as long as it takes to ensure Tony’s continued safety, and not a moment longer.
“We did it,” Steve’d said, and they were a horrible smelly mess, his uniform torn and ruined and Tony swallowed a joke about having to make him a new one in favor of tucking the memory away in a place to be forever cherished. “We did it together.”
He glances around, knowing that if Steve wants to eavesdrop, no walls around here will stop him. That being said, the man does possess an iota of tact, so Tony ventures back out to the front porch while knowing that it’s enough of a gesture to guarantee that Steve will grant him privacy and tune him out completely.
Rogers looks at the menu but doesn’t order when a waitress comes by, so Tony shoots her a charming smile and asks for the coffee pot and two waters.
“Which part of it?” Steve asks, head tipped back still, and Tony knows he only does that when he’s trying to keep himself together. He lets him have this, whatever shreds of composure he’s got left.
“You want a comment? I’ve got a comment for you. It’s like, I didn’t even know what I was doing,” Tony says, gesturing at himself and then the room at large. “I didn’t even know what I was doing, because of the adrenaline, you know? But you ask me, and somehow, don’t ask me to explain how, I remember exactly what it felt like to be up there. There was a nuke, you know? And then there was someone in my ear telling me to try and get rid of it. Those are the facts. That’s what I know. But you forget the part of it that has to do with you, you know?”
“I suppose it’s a lucky thing you didn’t spend all that time putting your own rooms together,” she says, scratching at the short bristly hairs on Steve’s nape while Tony huffs and reclaims Steve’s hand for himself. “Unless you saw this coming.”
“This is my husband,” Peggy says smoothly, pouring out orange juice for the three of them. “Tony, this is Steve.”
“Not a vegetarian,” Rogers says, turning around to press his rigid spine against the edge of the bar, observing the room in front of him. “But I’m usually much better when it comes to trying new things.”
“Not many people make me wait,” Fury says, but he’s relaxed, open. “Not even when I’m doing favors for the founder of SHIELD.”
He needs to get a grip. Normally he can navigate his feelings for Steve rather adeptly, so much so that no one suspects a thing, but it’s been one hell of a week. They’d only sent old Steve to his original universe the previous day, and they’re about to -
Writing this little fic was so much fun, and to know that other people could get some enjoyment from it really means a lot to me. I just want to thank everyone who was kind enough to take the time to read this through and leave kudos/comments - writers always appreciate any kind of feedback.
“It wasn’t long after I visited you,” Tony says, uncharacteristically outwardly contemplative. “After I found out who you really are. I put the pieces together, and you told me to find something to live for. I started hiring contractors, Pepper found out, and we decided to end things.”
Tony slots into the after-dinner assembly line with ease, drying the washed dishes that Crystal and Hannah give him before handing them off to Manny and Lance to put away. The adults do their best to keep everyone to their usual schedule, but Tony is new and bright and shiny, and no one wants to get ready for bed.
His fingers give him away, trembling as he navigates through the server and deletes every copy of the article except for the one stored on the backup USB drive that he shoves into his bag.
“Well, that was before you sent a nuke through a wormhole and saved the city from aliens,” Steve says. He shrugs and flattens a burgeoning smile when Tony fixes him with raised brows and a skeptical quirk of his upper lip. “And besides. I was perfectly friendly on the street. Let you molest me and everything.”
“I don’t think that’s the point here,” Tony mutters, and uses his glass to point to where Rhodes is sprawled loosely in his seat, progressively growing sloppier as Carol comes back from mixing another pitcher full.
“As long as you don’t get mushrooms, fine by me,” Tony says. “Now come on, let me show you how to talk to FRIDAY, this is the perfect opportunity. FRIDAY? Yeah, I know, I think he’s afraid of the future or something, try not to hold that against him.”
Steve rolls his neck around, cracking it back and forth, and then fixes Tony with an incredulous glare. “I just finished telling you that my long lost best friend murdered your parents, and you want to focus on whatever else I might be keeping a secret?”
Steve just eats his ice cream. It’s fruity, he thinks, and nothing he would ever pick out himself, but it’s good.
Yeah, he knows he lets Steve get away with murder. It’s not news, not to him at least, and certainly not to those with a keen eye and an ounce of awareness.
He offers Steve a hand that’s taken without delay and takes them up across the porch. As soon as he reaches for the doorknob, there’s a guiding touch low on his back, and it sends a flare straight through him.
Steve reaches for his work ID badge because it’s more accessible than his wallet, lets the guy do whatever verification he’s supposed to, and avoids Christine’s watchful eye. He signs with the miniature stylus where he’s directed to, and then the courier is scurrying back towards the hall that leads to the elevator bank.
No matter how certain he is that Tony will escape and be found, Steve keeps an unconscious eye on the date.
Steve’s never seen Iron Man in action before - when would he have? - and the countless reels of footage he’s watched over the years don’t even come close to doing the real thing justice. It’s breathtaking, awe-inspiring, and every other cliched phrase in the English language. For a brief moment, Steve regrets refusing not only the offer he’s just turned down, but the one from years prior, too.
When he doesn’t answer, Tony stuffs a fist against his mouth, presses it there hard. They don’t look at each other, two men who don’t know each other, not really, and yet have intimate knowledge of each other’s framework and blueprints much more than can ever be sufficiently illustrated for anyone else to see.
For a moment, Tony’s face goes stormy and stoic at the same time. Steve thinks maybe he’s reading the room wrong, that he’s fucked up and taken things too far and crossed another kind of line in his inappropriate drunkenness.
“Give Peg my condolences,” Howard says mildly. He’s not quite hardened yet, not the man Tony had spoken of, but Steve can’t be sure that that means anything will go differently. Decades still stretch out in front of them; plenty of time for him to become absent and for Tony to become bitter.
Goddamn friends who knew how to get under his skin and important men who kissed like there was nothing else in the world that mattered.
“So you’re not going to fuck off to another timeline like the other you did?” Tony asks, a million worst-case scenarios filling his head. “Because I can’t believe you’re making me say this, but I might miss you if you leave.”
“You might’ve mentioned it before,” Steve admits, wrestling with the distorted resentment clogging up his airway. He lights up his cell to see two missed calls from an unknown number (one guess who it belongs to, he thinks cynically) and a message from Natasha about some attractive guy she met at hot yoga.
She shoots him an amused look of disbelief. “Steve. Why do you think the lawsuit suddenly disappeared?”
“No,” Steve says, because this is important. He reaches out and stops just shy of the center of Tony’s chest. “You shouldn’t give me more than
Steve uncovers a grill and sends Tony and Morgan to the store while he goes on a run, and when they come back he mops his sweaty face with his shirt and cooks burgers for them. There’s corn on the cob and Morgan voices her concern that barbecues are for summer only, but Tony puts her in yet another bathing suit and she loses herself spinning in an inner tube, singing at the top of her lungs as FRIDAY plays her favorite songs.
He misses everyone already, and he’s barely been away, but Tony distracts him as they drive further out of the city towards his house.
“Tony’s been kidnapped,” Steve says, and he has to stop before he ends up breaking the mouse. He shakes out his hands, nerves and tense adrenaline lacing his entire body. “It’s all over the news. Pierce wants to capitalize on it. Wants me to write about how he had it coming.”
A well-placed hand to the mouth shuts Tony up, and Steve can see that Tony looks almost nervous, like he’s chattering away at a mile a minute because he doesn’t know what else to do. Steve’s nervous too, his mouth going dry as he licks his lips and slips a not-so-casual hand into Tony’s back pocket, pulling him in.
bruising Steve’s feelings in the process. “You really, really care about me!” He picks up his pace again, pretending to swoon like an old movie star with his hand pressed to his breastbone and everything.
She leaves then, but it takes at least ten minutes after the clicking of her heels has faded for Steve to summon the strength to place the lid back on the box and get back to work. He ends up staring at the computer monitor for the better part of the next few hours without really getting anything done, mostly just spell-checking his work and reading the bits that Christine has contributed.
Natasha turns quickly, gripping his wrist so her nails dig into the underside, nearly enough to break the skin.
“I know,” Steve says, because that’s not what he’s getting at. “I just don’t want to leave anything unturned.”
Tony’s brow furrows minutely before he’s chuckling along. “You came awfully close.” When he looks up at Steve, his head tilts. “You don’t remember?”
“Not with things the way they were,” Steve says, because he doesn’t know how to say it all. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t. He shouldn't.
Tony isn’t sure who kisses who; all he knows is that Steve is willing and pliant under him, surprisingly good at taking direction since conceding temporary leadership. Tony relishes the ability to direct the scene, loves how Steve doesn’t question it and does his best not to let thoughts of how the culmination of years of work and trust and friendship has given them this privilege overwhelm him.
“But I don’t know what it will be like to see her in person again,” Beth says. “And one of Elliot’s stupid friends has a crush on me, apparently, and he’s not half bad when he’s not bragging about how he’s gonna be a successful doctor someday.”
“Not yet,” she breathes while they stand still, and he listens. “It takes some practice to get it right. I don’t want to lose you, now that you’re really with us.”
What matters is that Tony had always been just out of reach. From the beginning to the end, from Loki to a platform with Rogers, Steve has never been able to reach out and ask for him. Steve thinks he knows Tony, inside and out, but he can’t be sure when Tony has always held himself at arm's length from all but a precious few.
She holds up a fistful of crumpled bills and Tony laughs, pushing the espresso machine back to its proper place and crouching in front of his daughter. Steve can see the twinge it causes him, but he doesn’t even hesitate as he pulls the cash from Morgan and flattens it all out.
"Why not; Captain Rogers? America needs you." Fury leaned closer, giving Steve the usual I-am-concerns-son look, but right now I have far more important things to worry about. It touched a nerve. "The world needs you."
Everyone else treated Bruce with kid gloves, and it got to him. Bruce was uncomfortable around everyone. What he needed was someone who WASN'T AFRAID OF HIM, DIDN'T PITY HIM, AND RESPECTED BOTH HIS GENIUS AND HIS POWER WHICH HE KNEW BRUCE COULD CONTROL. BRUCE NEEDED a friend who understood his plight and that was what Tony was being!
Steve gave him such a hard look Tony felt like he had been turned into stone. “You were lying, Howard Stark was a great man, how could you degraded him!” Rage bubbled inside of Steve.
Tony blinked and then, huh, Steve was right in Tony’s face, his eyes spitting fire and his mouth was set in a moue of displeasure. Power. Danger. Control. A triumvirate was visible in the lines of the man's body and the set of his shoulders: bold and dominant. “Impudence.” He said in a tone so dangerous that even Tony felt a spike of fear wrapped around the base of his spine, the sudden urge to bare his neck and do everything he could to calm the alpha down, was new. He absolutely hated it! “Take that back.” Rogers growled.
Looking at how tensed Tony was the Agent humoured him. “There is someone.” his mouth quirked a little. “She is a cellist.”
‘Tony... a nuke? You what?’ Steve’s heart stopped for a beat as he realized what Tony was suggesting. He felt the panic rose like billowing smoke, felt it choked his soul. “NO, Tony don’t!”
He brushes his hands together, shedding any lingering dust, and pokes around the built-ins flanking the fireplace. There’s nothing to be found, not that he’s looking for anything in particular, and once he determines that there’s nothing to be seen aside from the bare-bones furniture, he moves towards the kitchen. It looks exactly as he remembers, which is eerie and comforting at the same time. The water works and the electricity is still running, which is good to know. Poking around in the refrigerator and cabinets turns up absolutely nothing besides a few boxes of baking soda and stray sugar packets, and Tony can’t help but frown.
“I got sweaty. Didn’t see the point in showering when I’ll just get in the water with her after we eat,” Steve points out.
The grating sound of dry heaving makes Steve wince, and he rocks back onto his heels to distract his body from a more visceral reaction.
“That’s okay,” Tony says, and Steve knows he’s being studied. “I’m serious, no one’s asking you to. You don’t ever have to go into open combat ever again, if you don’t want to.”
“You could come upstate,” Tony says with practiced nonchalance, and the thought of this being something that he’s had to work up to gives Steve a funny feeling in his stomach.
“Everything,” Steve says, looking at Tony, drinking in the easy set of his shoulders, the loose lines of his body, blessed with the knowledge that this Tony can be his,
There are towels sitting on a lounge chair. They hadn’t been there before, and Steve hadn’t noticed anyone pass by, which is worrisome because he’s practically paid to notice things that other people would miss. One thing he doesn’t miss, though, is the way Tony’s tiny underwear clings to the very tops of his shapely thighs. He’s got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of, Steve thinks absently, and then feels his cheeks burn as he processes that thought, rubbing his towel over his face to hide the flush just in case the late hour doesn't do an adequate job.
“Do you want me to have asked you here to get to know Morgan?” Tony asks, and Steve can’t look away from his mouth as he talks.
He never responds to Tony’s messages. He just lets them haunt him on the days he isn’t busy convincing himself that nothing ever happened.
“You trusted me,” Tony says, and now he’s angry, hands clenched into fists and words dripping with loathing. “You trusted me to ferry you onto a private plane, and you didn’t get sick so I convinced myself you were capable of consenting, and then I tricked you into a guest room so that when it was over, I could leave you alone and sleep without a guilty conscience.”
“You know,” she starts, “after you published that piece the way you did, I wondered whether I’d misjudged you.”
Tony can’t help but lapse into hysterical giggles as Steve shows him a can of whipped cream and a bottle of chocolate sauce, the latter of which has a vibrant pink sticky note attached. It says
Tony rests his chin in the palm of his hand, speculative, eyes still bright and reflecting the renovated kitchen back at Steve.
“...So I’m thinking we reframe the narrative,” Pierce is saying as Steve blinks back to the present, tuning out the Audi commercial now playing. “‘Stark’s Last 48 Hours.’” Pierce holds out demonstrative hands, and Steve can’t believe what he’s hearing. “We’ll gussy it up, talk about being the last ones in with him. What do you think?”
There’s mortadella on focaccia sandwiches leftover from a sponsored lunch at the office, and Steve frowns and needs five bites before determining that he likes the fattiness, but isn’t sold on the giardiniera.
“That’s right,” Steve says, sipping at his drink. “You were there to interview Hammer. What is it they say, kill two birds with one stone?”
Steve does, but only after he’s shimmied out of his boxers, and that nearly distracts Tony entirely.
Then there’s a noise from the phone in his hand and he remembers who’s on the other end, and curses.
“Maybe that’s the problem,” Steve says to the window. “Meanwhile, you won’t let me do anything for you.”
“They were nice,” Steve reassures. “Feels a bit strange to be allowed into the inner sanctum like this, but they’re nice.”
“Don’t knock the steamed spinach,” Tony says, picking through the home fries left behind in the corned beef hash skillet. “It’s heart-healthy.”
“Not you,” Steve says obviously, and Tony scowls at how easily he’s turned the tables between them. “The other you.”
Morgan gets dropped off with Pepper on Sunday afternoon, because she’s got school the next day and Steve’s flight leaves in the morning. When it comes time to say goodbye, Morgan won’t let go of Steve’s leg.
“When did you get so boring?” Tony asks as a black limousine makes an appearance in the lot. He’s apparently too entertained to pay it any attention, eyes fixed on Steve. “Seriously. When we first met, you were so much fun, and last time in New York you wouldn’t even - ”
“That he had a secret,” Steve says, his eyes reflecting the moon as he looks up, and Tony watches him intently, beer forgotten on the step beside him as he ignores how their hands grow clammy together. “I don’t think he wanted me to know, at least not at first. But she could see how it affected him, and I think she thought if someone else knew, it would hurt a little less.”
“Come here,” she’ll say instead, and he’ll gather her up in his arms, swaying on the linoleum in their kitchen. Sometimes there will be music floating from the radio, and sometimes the soundtrack consists of nothing more than birds chirping and insects buzzing, filtering in through the open window over the sink.
“Everyone,” Tony says, gesturing behind them. “You’ve met Rhodey, Rhodey likes you. Well, as much as Rhodey likes anyone, that is. I’m still trying to get the others to play nice with strangers, but you know what they say. You can take the kids out of their war-torn Eastern European country, but…”
“Yeah,” Sam says with a chuckle. “I think the kid has made him go soft, though. Either that, or the separation.”
“We need help finding people,” she says. “And we always need money. Denise thinks we can move somewhere smaller by the end of the year, and the damn mayor won’t let us stay. They think getting conventions and performances up and running will help, somehow.”
“There’s a tight turnaround here, I’m sure you know, TIME wants to make the announcement sometime next week - ”
Through the smoke and alcohol, the atmosphere and pure Tony that’s circulating through Steve’s veins at this point, Steve is just barely aware enough to be sure that his odds on making it out of this in one piece are slim to none.
Steve shrugs. His mouth is redder than Tony’s thumb and glorious. “Just thought it would be nice to go back. Didn’t get to fully appreciate it the first time around.”
Steve swallows around a lump in his suddenly Saharan throat. “That’s kinda not how things usually work, you know.”
So far, he’s only learned three things that are even remotely in line with what he’d come here to find out.
“This is what’s been keeping you up at night,” she says, and it’s not a question. “You knew - you know.”
pushing Tony where he wants him, and Tony goes without complaint for once in his life, just as eager and frantic as Steve is. He just rubs up against Steve’s front, jerks his hips until they nearly tip onto the mattress, and they begin losing clothing like their lives depend on it. They can barely manage it all before Tony’s arching into Steve, teeth on his collarbone as things just keep unraveling.
He doesn’t know what Steve is thinking, why he keeps reaching out to him like this, but he has to assume it’s a good thing. Steve lets their hands fall, switches sides so that he can walk with Tony’s fingers twined with his, pushing the cart with his available forearm. Tony doesn’t get it, which is puzzling because he knows Steve like he knows the back of his hand. This is markedly different though, and as they make their way to the checkout, he can’t figure it out.
"Not at all." Steve surveyed the mess over his growing collection of empty beer bottles. "Do you usually sleep with that many electronics?"
Tony grabbed the nearest pillow, dragging it over his face in a vain attempt to hide his embarrassment. The pillow smelled like Steve.
“It’s not even eight. This is a perfectly normal time to be calling,” he points out, because he actually does remember all the conversations about appropriate out-of-office conduct.
“It’s alright,” Bucky says with a shrug, and he hugs Steve goodbye. “Was good to see you. Don’t be a stranger.”
“That’s okay,” she says, falling to the flats of her feet, and her hair is beautifully woven together in a way that he swears it wasn’t when they were back in the first clearing. “Do you want to talk to him? Or do you not want to?”
He had been tired, and knew that he couldn’t take care of his team if he didn’t take care of himself, so he passed on a pile of blankets on a too-short couch. Tony had stretched out in the bed obnoxiously, complaining about Steve’s long limbs until they were bickering like children. It wasn’t until Steve brought down the metaphorical hammer that they shut up and closed their eyes, knowing that they had a rough road ahead of them if they were going to defeat Ultron.
that he hadn’t hooked up with Tony while they were both drunk beyond comprehension, and that he hadn’t forgotten an entire once-in-a-lifetime experience with a man who sends mixed signals and quite literally has made a career out of convincing people to worship him.
Tony shrugs as they make their way to the kitchen, stomachs rumbling and sun shining bright through all the windows.
“And where do you plan on sitting?” Tony asks in amusement, and Steve carefully places himself on Tony’s lap, careful to let his own legs carry most of his weight.
“Talk about a man with one hell of a plan,” Tony says, his chuckle coming out overly breathy. “Yeah, yeah. You don’t have to ask me twice.”
The instinct to keep it all to himself is so strong, ingrained from a lifetime of secrets, but this is Tony, and it’s one more chance than he ever thought he’d get, and he’s not going to let it slip through his fingers.
She raises a manicured eyebrow while opting not to follow through with her end of the handshake, and Steve is simultaneously thrilled that he’s gotten the opportunity to actually meet her and dreading whatever judgment she’s reserved for him. Unlike him, though, she seems well-rested and well-practiced and doesn’t reveal anything he doesn’t already know.
“It was only two fingers,” Steve says as he deposits the fourth and final bullet in the plastic kidney-shaped basin on his other side, the forceps getting dumped as well. “And there might have been something in that compartment, you never know.”
When he gets back to the house, it’s still quiet. Josie likes to go to the library and read law texts, wanting to be ahead of the curve in the fall, and Denise had mentioned grocery shopping. Steve drinks an entire glass of water in less than a minute, and then refills the cup and adds ice before sitting down at the counter. He’d methodically thrown out or cleaned any sign that Tony had ever been here, and now he almost regrets it.
“Do you think he’ll have one here?” Rogers says, and really, Steve Rogers has never been one for idle chit-chat, so Steve responds accordingly.
“I do,” Steve says, thinking back to when he’d first been in Wakanda after Siberia, and how T’Challa had offered to construct him a new shield, but Steve hadn’t been able to think about it without seeing anything other than Tony lying on the snowy concrete in his suit. He’d declined and asked if they couldn’t come up with something else, and Shuri had been more than happy to exercise a little freedom.
“Probably,” Tony says, sounding very far away, the single word ringing in Steve’s ears. “It’s my weekend with Morgan, and she’s got a classmate’s birthday party. Didn’t want to keep her from going.”
Pierce rolls his lips together unflatteringly. “Do you realize the kind of opportunity that’s fallen into our laps, here? This is a once-in-a-lifetime shot, kid. If we play our cards right, this can be huge. You were one of the last civilians to see Stark before he flew to Afghanistan, and we can capitalize on that. Leave the speculation to everyone else - we can talk about whether or not you saw it coming, if maybe this is karmic retribution for all that he’s contributed to the war effort, all the signs that point towards him being an irresponsible cocky - ”
“I don’t need anything,” he says softly, truthfully. The band is gone, and Steve knows it won’t be coming back. Not anymore.
They don’t talk about it a lot in the house. The kids all know him as Steve, not as Captain America and he appreciates it. They know who he is, it’s not a secret, even if some of the younger ones don’t quite understand what it means. But Beth asking reminds him that he isn’t just Steve, and he rests his spoon in his bowl and thinks about the piece of paper in his toiletry bag.
When Tony recovers, he says, “Hey, you wanna defile the hot tub tonight? It’s got a state-of-the-art filtration system.”
It all means nothing, Tony explains when Steve eventually loops back through the yard, inexorably reeled in by its magic. He’s still wearing the crown, Steve notes with extreme satisfaction low in his belly.
“I'm going to be a superhero,” Tony informs Peggy, smiling with crumbs sticking to his mouth. “Just like Captain America in the comics.”
But he declines to try Bruce’s turmeric lattes and evades capture the entirety of Clint's phase involving the casseroles of his midwestern past. Tony almost envies the way Rogers tactically steers clear of tater-tot casserole and every other dish that begins with cracking open a can of cream of mushroom soup.
Steve catches the past tense, the implications in those few words, and Tony almost looks shy. His own words get stuck on the way out, a muted gasp of wonderment, and the emotion overtakes him.
“You mean, since you threatened the sanctity of my apartment before falling out of a hole in the sky and convincing my editor that neglecting to show up tonight was a fireable offense,” Steve interrupts, and swears Tony’s smile stretches further than humanly possible.
Steve doesn’t want to give in so quickly. He takes a sip of coffee and immediately grimaces - how Tony is downing the stuff without gagging is beyond him.
,” Tony says, and he flaps his arms about, earning Steve’s gaze and the special quirk to his mouth. “The other you. You know.”
“It’s not like I thought it would be,” Steve says, almost wondrous as his nails carve half-moons into Tony’s deltoids before deliciously raking up and down. “It’s so full, but it’s like - it’s like - ”
“Just…just, thank you,” Steve says, and he wants to rip his hair out and bruise Tony’s lips with his, wants to start the conversation over and ask if the girl had been a mistake because if she had then maybe they can see each other again, wants to get all these crazy ideas out of his system for once so they can stop eating him alive from the inside out. “It means a lot that you did this for me, and I want you to know that.”
“Rebuilt it after Ultron,” Tony says. This car is red and obnoxious, and so very Tony that it warms Steve down to his bones. “I put it off for a while, but then Pepper drew up plans. I was going to let her keep it, but she wanted a blank slate when she moved back here. Understandable, of course. You’ll see her place, we’re picking up Morgan first. I could’ve flown you private, you know. Have you land somewhere a bit more discreet. Not that I’m complaining, of course.”
“He says he’ll tell us what’s coming,” Steve reminds him, like Tony hasn’t been there to watch his attitude towards his other self turn from skeptical to tolerant over the years. “He’ll do his part, and we’ll do ours.”
“No,” Steve says, because that’s not what’s happened here. “I just know you. Better than either of us want me to, probably.”
“I’m not gonna get stuck,” Tony grunts stubbornly from where his leg is a hair away from some questionably exposed wires, the upper half of his body mostly hidden from view by what is supposedly some kind of engine. He’s got an arm fiddling around inside of it, and there’s been an awful lot of cursing and clanging in the last sixty seconds. Steve is justifiably concerned. “You
Tony’s arm shifts, elbow unhinging until fingers are running over the inside of Steve’s forearm. It’s brief, just a silent acknowledgment, but it sends shivers down Steve’s spine. He tells himself that it’s from the air conditioning and his damp hair.
Tony’s head tilts sideways, and Steve, emboldened by the fact that he isn’t running straight away, fits his palm to cup Tony’s cheek, fingers reaching up to curve against his scalp.
“You’re okay,” he says, because whether it’s true or not, it’s all he can think to say to keep from fixating on how his palm broadly covers the entirety of the visible swath of skin, and then some. “You’re gonna be okay. Just go ahead and throw up, okay? You’ll feel better once you get it all out.”
He can feel Rogers looking at him as he pulls almond milk from the fridge and granola from the pantry.
that I’ve effectively been retired since I managed to convince Vision and Rhodey and the murder twins to stay on. Tell TIME that their person of the year is about to effectively
“I’m not a virgin,” Steve says, and Tony can’t decide which one of them he wants to smack in the face.
“Think you proved that with the article,” Tony says, before twisting to the side with a, “Happy, give me a minute, can’t a billionaire get a minute around here? Who cares about a fine, I’ll just pay it, you - ”
Thirdly, Steve has learned that Tony trusts Rhodes implicitly and unconditionally. If Iron Man does in fact retire for good, or even temporarily, Rhodes is prepared to take over the team and fill the space Tony will leave behind. It’s almost hard to listen to the bare admiration as Tony talks about how long they’ve known each other and how many times Rhodes has come to his aid, a deeply-forged friendship that transcends the conventional definition of the word, and Steve voices his gratitude for War Machine’s willingness to step in.
The voice on the line reminds him of a much sterner Pepper Potts, but no less capable as she rattles off what sounds like a press release. It’s the same spiel she opened with, sounding no more plausible a second time around. He stares blankly at a garbage truck noisily making its way along the not-yet-awake street below, trying to ignore the bone-numbing December air in favor of concentrating on what this lady is actually saying.
A little slip of the tongue, Steve can handle no problem. Tony can run his along Steve’s bottom lip and press inside and Steve just lets him, keeps his hands nice and gentle. The moment he snags Steve with his teeth though, just a razor-thin drag, Steve goes taut. Tony is close enough to hear how Steve’s entire body freezes, can practically see the infinitesimal tightening of fingertips on the back of his neck, and greedily digs in deeper.
“Why don’t you give me a tour?” he asks, and Tony’s smile grows wider as Steve keeps going, refusing to falter, flowers still locked in his fist.
“Come on,” he says. “Or else you won’t get to decide where to stay, and I’ll make sure you get the smallest room ever.”
It’s true - there had been a throwaway couple of comments somewhere between the cocktail bar and the pool, halfway through a discussion on the potential growth of social media beyond Facebook and Myspace and the subsequent effects on Tony’s various ventures. But when Steve had logged into Twitter after landing in JFK the previous afternoon, he’d had an unexpected uptick in followers, prompted by the follow of one Tony Stark.
Steve would do a lot of things for a decent mattress and daily Starbucks runs, but selling out isn’t one of them.
Tony cuts himself off, lashes fluttering closed before snapping open. He looks almost scared, and Steve rubs a thumb over his cheekbone.
Steve ushers them inside, pink-cheeked and adorably flustered as the woman continues to stare with eyes the size of dinner plates.
Tony grimaces magnificently, letting go of the framing and letting the door swing fully closed behind him. Steve attempts to remind himself that the man in front of him isn’t his responsibility, but people choke on their own vomit all the time, and remembering that is all it takes to push open a stall door and coax Tony forward, free hand outstretched in case he needs the support. He doesn’t, shoulders drawn tight as he stumbles forward till he’s standing over the toilet, bent at the waist in a way that looks supremely uncomfortable.
“Yeah,” Natasha says, all soft and kind, the way he only rarely got to see before the Snap. “Why, you’d rather he explain it all to you?”
They argue it for a while. It’s like sparring again, going back and forth, and Tony wakes up some part of Steve's brain that he had believed to be long dormant. He shakes his head and is harmlessly impatient as he tries to convince Tony to see it his way, but he feels loose and easy no matter how wound up he gets, and he has to remind himself that this Tony is not his for the taking. Rather, he relishes the rekindled flame that lies within him, lets himself feel the sparking embers that he thought had been dead for good.
“You matter, Steve,” Tony says, and they’re coming up on the airport. “You matter so much, to so many people.”
“About that,” Pierce says, and he’s straight-faced but perversely so, like he’s fighting back some sort of sick thrill. “We might need a different angle on that.”
No, he decides, forcing himself to swallow rubbery egg before washing it down with too-hot too-bitter coffee. He can’t go down that rabbit hole, because if Steve has any hope of making it in this industry - if he ever wants to live somewhere with a dishwasher, if he ever wants to be able to buy himself the nice seasonal beverages without worrying about the dent it’ll make in his bank account, if he ever wants to write about anything more important than which ski pants accentuate the backside the most without compromising comfort in the front - then he has to forget about Tony Stark’s dazzling eyes and sincere little looks.
He gets fluffy white cream all over his mouth, and Tony can’t look away. He’s vaguely aware of his jaw unhinging as Steve swallows, Adam’s apple bobbing smoothly before he’s licking his lips clean, leaving behind wet, shiny, spit-slick lips that would kill a lesser man.
“Who gave you these questions, anyway?” Tony interrupts, sitting up. “A bunch of diplomats in wolf's clothing? When did you turn into such a people pleaser, anyway?”
Back at work, Steve is putting the finishing flourishes on his contributions to the article about the after-party. Most of it centers around the fashions of the night, but he makes sure to slip in just enough indulgent detail to allow readers to feel like they’re getting an exclusive peek into one of the biggest events of the year. A fly on the wall kind of approach, he thinks, pen slotted behind his ear as he leans back in his chair and rakes a hand through his hair for the tenth time that afternoon.
“I didn’t know how to belong after everything,” Steve says, and his hands feel big and clunky, and he doesn’t know what to do with them. “You had Pepper and Morgan, and Rhodes and Happy. And you’d been without everyone else for so long, and after what you did for all of us, I didn’t want to take anything else from you.”
Steve lets a beat pass, like he isn’t sure he believes Tony, and a bit of guilt flickers through him.
“So what about them?” Tony asks, willing to suspend some serious disbelief and buy into Steve’s giddy optimism if it feels this heavenly, like early morning gold and liquid sunshine pouring over them. “If we’re always in love, what happened to them?”
“He’s probably a fan,” Tony says, ego still wounded from the way he’d gone unrecognized and ignored in the bakery.
And it’s definitely got nothing to do with the fact that he never expected to be here, privileged with drinking in Tony Stark’s secondhand smoke while buried under the sparkling vanilla-strawberry scented grit of Sin City. What even is his life, Steve thinks with a silent choked laugh, opting for another swig of beer as Tony opens his eyes. They land on Steve without any sort of detour, and Steve hopes he hasn’t been caught staring.
“You ready to get outta here?” Steve knows how it sounds, but can’t bring himself to regret it, not when Tony wets his lips with a sliver of pink tongue.
She says it blithely, tucking a strand of expensively highlighted blonde hair out of her face. Gold bracelets jangle and plink against each other as she moves, and Steve does his best not to do that thing where he flares his nostrils in annoyance.
“Of course she knows,” Tony says, and he goes to pinch Steve’s exposed arm but Steve neatly steps just out of reach just in time. “She knows everything.”
There’s so much that he can barely wrap his mind around it when he’s like this, muscles pliant beyond his control. Memories of conflict flash through his head like they’re on a movie reel, someone’s finger glued to the fast forward button. Every argument they’ve ever had, every unkind word, all the times they’d been apart and Steve had thought of Tony while wondering if Tony was thinking of him too.
It’s an answer that makes very little sense if Steve is here to help defend the right to Iron Man’s existence, and he wipes the lingering cold seeped into his fingertips on the thigh of his pants.
Steve knows it’s time to take his hand away, but doesn’t. He rakes through Tony’s hair again, feeling minuscule shards of ice that pierce his skin before turning to fat water droplets. Tony is patient, pale lips open a mere fraction and long lashes unblinking. There’s no excuse for how quickly Steve’s mind is sliding into places it shouldn’t remember: wondering if Tony’s mouth is as soft as it had been before, if Tony would let him sneak under his quarter-zip to brush the warm skin of his waist, if he’s brave enough to do anything he’s ever wanted to or if he’s destined to have only ever gotten the briefest taste of liquid-sweet indulgence.
“I’m right here,” Steve says, and he sounds like he’s okay, maybe just overwhelmed, and they can handle that.
“You should go,” Steve says, pointing with his coffee-holding hand at the flow of traffic in front of them. “Your lady says you’ve got a meeting to get to.”
Steve settles their things while Peggy readies a groggy boy for sleep, his hearing picking up their little conversation as he brushes his teeth in an opulent bathroom with gaudy gold fixtures.
Steve slides in after what he considers an appropriate amount of hesitance, thanking the driver and offering up his hotel location as the door shuts after him. “Joe?”
“Who else is there to talk about?” Steve says, raising an eyebrow as Christine dips her head in concession. “He’s been one slip of the hand away from being escorted off the premises all night.”
“Maybe there’s a reason for that,” he says, and she holds up two palms in dramatic defeat as he finally shifts the top of the box off the bottom, carefully placing it to the side.
It’s always going to be like this, Steve thinks with resigned wonder. He’s always going to be left speechless and in awe of Tony. It’s a struggle to reconcile, but he’s managed worse. If Tony trusts him, then he can return that, because it’s
“Can you go - maybe faster?” Steve asks, ragged and wrecked and it’s simply amazing how quickly he’s come undone. It makes Tony wonder exactly how much effort goes into his collected disposition, except he knows the answer to that, knows that it’s one hell of a constant effort. “Harder? Can you just - more?”
Steve prays Tony doesn’t notice, and decidedly doesn’t watch as Tony lingers before joining his girlfriend in the car.
Natasha just licks a smear of icing off the meaty part of her thumb and resumes her tortuously slow unwrapping.
“Yeah.” Tony shrugs and lets go. Steve wishes he hadn’t touched him to begin with. “Come on, they don’t bite.”
Tony could only watch as she stepped inside the elevator, wiping tears from her face and asking JARVIS to call for a cab.
Steve jerks his head up without thinking, looking at Tony without really meaning to. It’s only once they lock eyes, Tony’s wickedly unfocused, that he realizes he’d sort of been counting on escaping the restroom without a single word between the two of them. So much for that, he surmises, and tries to quell the rising desperate laugh from deep inside of him.
“I’m glad you thought so,” Steve says, mouth fully curling into a smile. “I’ve never been a fan of micromanaging my team.”
Steve looks around them. A doe and her speckled fawns disappear between two trees as their footsteps approach, and none of this would make any sense in the real world because fawns aren’t born in the fall, but maybe it’s time to stop trying to make sense of things.
“I’m a little worried about the state of your relationship if your girlfriend has taken to reading employee handbooks to you,” Steve says dryly, and for a second during which he demands of himself
“So do I, kiddo,” Tony says, extending a palm for a high five that Alexa returns. “Besides. He doesn’t have the patience for this kind of precision work.”
“Where what?” Tony demands, and he finally stands up. “Where you weren’t wanted? Goddamnit Rogers, why are you always like this - ”
When Fury becomes director, Steve manages to get a message to him via Peggy who is still as sharp as ever.
Steve takes the cigarette and holds on for too long, because buried underneath mental images of Tony’s surprisingly muscled upper half and the desire to run his hands through the slowly drying ringlets smeared across the tops of his ears, shifting them out of the way so he can run the edge of his teeth along the delicate cartilage shell, he does remember some of what he’s there for. It’s a tactic, perhaps one of the easiest in the book: waiting for the interviewee to fill the silence.
Steve snorts, thinking of what he had gotten a glimpse of before he left. “No. He definitely still had his secrets.”
Time passes. Steve isn’t sure how long they sit there; clocks don’t tick the way they used to. He thinks he sees Tony scrub a hand over his face, but when he speaks, he sounds normal.
“Not Cap,” Steve says distractedly, tucking the leaves in amongst fluffy waves. It feels natural, like this makes more sense than anything Steve has ever done before. “And I don’t know what Coachella is.”
Pepper comes by the next morning to pick Morgan up for a dentist appointment, and Steve pretends he isn’t eavesdropping as he helps Morgan lace up her sneakers.
“Um. No ma’am. I mean - no, Captain. Captain Marvel? Miss Carol. I’m not - and you’ve got to be at least twenty-one anyway, so - ”
“That’s what I thought,” he says with a sort of certainty to it, and he grins, and for a moment it’s like looking into a mirror despite the fact that Rogers is many many years younger than him. He stands up then, holding out a hand. “Come on. Tell us the rest.”
“We’ve got a landline,” Steve tells him, and recites the number, and Sam recites it to Bucky, who will memorize it.
“Then trust me,” Tony says, and he soothes the pinched skin with a sweep of his thumb. “Besides. I’ll be offended if you don’t like this.”
Steve remembers learning of their separation, back when he and Tony had been at each other’s necks in the worst way, and doesn’t even briefly entertain how all those factors could have influenced each other.
“I mean it Rogers, order whatever you want, whenever you want,” Tony tells him. “Even at this time of night, places are always open.”
“Is this where you want to be?” Tony asks, searching for verification as he holds Steve’s chin firm between his thumb and forefinger. “You’re not just here because Natasha is sleeping, or because you’re scared or lonely, or because you’re trying to lock me down while we’re both unattached?”
So Steve grills and Tony settles into his lounger with his tablet. It’s peaceful and almost fantastical, and they eat outside in the dark with glasses of red wine. Between the two of them, they polish off close to two bottles, and Tony is gloriously red-mouthed as he talks about how Carol is supposed to visit next month, dependent on whether or not the galaxy throws anything new at her.
Tony doesn’t answer, but he does keep talking as he begins walking. “You think I don’t know exactly who you are? Of course I know that you know Happy. I’m not an amnesiac, and the helmet’s equipped with more than adequate impact absorption. I meant, how do you know he’s out of commission?” He stops a few yards away and casts an expectant look at Steve. “Are you coming?”
“Seems wrong to talk about a woman I don’t know like that,” Sam admits, “but yeah. Who lets her spew this kind of crap?”
“No?” Steve says, head swimming. It’s a bit of a miracle that he's still managing to form coherent words. “Maybe that’s what I’ll write about.”
“I used to think chemistry was boring,” Tony says. “But then I built a particle accelerator in my garage.”
Tony doesn’t argue, even if it looks like he might. They both know the chance of Tony ever needing anything from him is nonexistent, but the not-quite-closed door will have to be enough of an offering to leave behind.
It’s a sophisticated building, futuristic and impersonal when Steve is granted access. There’s a brief moment during which he considers hovering just inside the entrance, but thinks that he’s been left alone and might as well take advantage of the opportunity to poke around. Of course, as luck would have it, most of the doors and halls he encounters greet him with a dissonant buzzing and a lilting accented voice informing him that he doesn’t have the clearance required to bypass the security parameters.
“You are going to be very angry with me,” he says solemnly, and from the set of Rogers’ jaw, he knows he’s believed. “But I need you to do something. If not for me, for her.”
Steve thumbs at the sweat on Tony’s brow and then he’s being rolled on his back, shifting obediently as Tony guides him. He draws strength from somewhere, resisting the urge to lose it all as he picks up where Tony leaves off, holding on so tight that he almost worries it’s hurting until Tony’s plants a steadying hand on his chest for leverage and then fire licks through Steve’s veins and all he can think is that nothing will ever compare to the sight above him. They move together until Steve swears they’re one, rocking and gasping and promising each other everything there is to promise.
“But you are a hero, a soldier; shouldn’t your purpose be to fight for the love of your country, for the world? Would you rather for the world to be inflamed and for billions of people to die?”
Whatever Tony saw in him, it wasn’t enough to convince the genius. His precision glare nailed him as sharp as brown daggers. "Enough not to say how high when he says jump?”
Howard let her go and smiled at her, they still feel like they were held together by that invisible current.
It also explain Steve jealousy as Tony Stark had history of dating man, woman of every caste especially beta. Pepper is special case since she is less territorial, a lot more understanding, and had care and work for Tony for years
Palms to palms, their hands met, fingers gripping hard like a soul grasping another. They watched each other as Steve filled him until it seemed that the two of them were melting against each other, and Tony didn’t know where he ended or where Steve began.
Bruce withered under their looks, sighed slightly, looked down at the desk and removed his glasses before wiped them on his shirt. "A warm light for all mankind. Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube." Bruce started, looked up at them finally.
Bruce looked up, waved his hands to indicate his work. "Uh. I just want to finish my work here." He hedged, tried not to make any wild accusations.
Vaguely, Tony noticed Romanoff in the driver seat. A tiny frown on her face instead of that coolly appraising expression she favored; it only safe to assume that Shield knew. Damn, he would need to bribe Fury to keep Shield’s mouth shut… he must made sure Pepper never ever found out or she would leave thinking Captain America was the best thing ever for him!
He roused into the lonely, predawn light. It felt lonelier than when he was alone before, like another, a bigger piece of him had just left. A hollow ache opened in his stomach. He felt completely empty and bereft.
The sharp-clawed of dread and fear grabbed onto Steve’s chest that even a simple act like breathing took more strength than necessary. He vaguely aware of the aliens that were slowly converging on all sides, but all he cared about on was whether he’d see a red and gold blur come back through the portal, sans missile.
Cap circled Tony, his stepped slow, sure, as he looked down at him with such cold hard disdain-like only Howard did. No wonder Howard loved him so much. Surprised, surprised-like father, like his lab rat! It was nearly a relief because finally; Rogers was showing him his true color. It was another proves that Howard was so wrong about Captain ‘perfect.’ He was just some asshole vintage Ken dolls with a stick in his pert, 1940’s ass.
It was so weird. Steve had been clinging to the last thing he had that's familiar, the last thing he had that was close to home - how to be a soldier, how to obey orders-like a baby with a security blanket that he became completely blind to the glaring facts. Only when Doc. Banner said it all, Steve realized that Tony-- as irritating as he was -- and Bruce might have a point, and if they did, he couldn't let it lie.
He ignored the voice of reason in his head and press on. He was doing them both a favor, not ending up like Howard and Maria blasted marriage! Pepper was amazing and loyal, she was safe!
So I had been asked by one reviewer in fanfiction about Howard being Steve mate and how he would feel about Tony. So I would clear it all up…The origin of Steve feeling for Howard come from THE PULL that was not even nearly as strong as THE PULL toward Tony but still pretty strong since Steve and Tony is Twin-flame soul-mate.
One of thing his past had taught him was how to slice people with the edge of his tongue, gouge into people with his intelligence and drop them with a glance… Just like his parents did to him.
“At ease, SOLDIER!” He heard a voice, turns around, and saw a tall, bald, black man, with an eye patch over one eye, wearing a leather coat. The man stayed out of his arms reach--stared, appraised him with his powerful, one eye gaze -and had more than a dozen guards with guns in their hands backing him up.
Tony was a firecracker of energy and ideas that by the time he was 16, Tony had created half of Stark industry’s new weapons and a brand new suppressant for Omega. It hurt that Howard claimed all Tony inventions as his, but he told himself, Howard was right it gives them better marketing. It later became one more reason for him to resent Howard.
Maria felt hatred toward that bitch unlike anything she’d ever felt toward another person. She knew her. She had sat at her dinner table. How could anyone knowingly cheat with a married man? A father of one? What did she expect to get from it besides a bigger office? Maria was baffled.
Tony stepped back to allow the other man passage. He pulled his sunglasses off, fiddled with it. “Let me show you your room, Captain.” Tony said in the same voice he used in Avengers’ debriefing.
Steve frowned at that, not sure how to answer. Tony nodded, thought Rogers might be coming round to their line of thought.
Took away his armor, sure, but unless his adversary planned to remove him from the game entirely, he would always be the most dangerous thing in the room. He would just build a bigger, better armor and defeat them.
Once outside, he ran along the street in bare feet, came to a screeching halt as he looked with horror, wondered at how much the world had changed. A sense of panic whirled inside of him, as he looked around in a circle at the sights of almost familiar buildings and street signs, yet cars like he had never seen before and light--moving images like movies, only in color. It was almost too much for his mind to comprehend, to keep up with what was going on around him.
Your soulmate understood and connected with you in every way and on every level, which brought a sense of peace, calmness, and happiness when you were around them. And when you were not around them, you were all that much more aware of the harshness of life, and how bonding with another person in this way was the most significant and satisfying thing you would experience in your lifetime. You were also all that much aware of the beauty in life because you had been given a great gift and would always be thankful.
Captain Asshole’s lip twisted into a slight ugly snarl as he glared down at him. Rogers used his superior height and bulk for intimidation this time; an outdated alpha move that would never work on Tony Stark. Iron Man had faced a bigger and far deadlier enemy than a subpar super-soldier. If Rogers was a villain he wouldn’t last 6 seconds fighting Iron Man. Tony hated himself for finding Roger’s eyes so hypnotic.
Sometimes Maria blamed Tony, saying it was all Tony’s fault for being Captain America’s soul-mate, that his existence had renewed Howard’s desire to find the Super-Soldier relic. For years, Tony believed it.
The paintings were a jewel in their own right. The old paint still bright and gleaming as if it was enameled. They also had a tempura panel.
Maria and Howard, in the early days of their relationship, had once been deeply in love at first sight. Maria remembered so clearly the day she met Howard, he walked into the room and she felt this wave of energy. The force of the bond caught and held their senses, something inside them sang with glee. It was like some part of them that had been asleep for their whole life woke up with a jolt. Both of them whimpered. Maria just knew he was supposed to be in her life.
The alien glared at Tony before a bright glow erupted around Loki’s body. Tony ready for any attack, fully expected Loki to lash out, but the shimmering passed uneventfully with his cloak, and Loki’s headdress faded. The alien slowly raised his hands in the gesture of surrenders.
If there was anyone in this hovercraft he willing to trust even minutely, it was Doc. Banner. He didn’t trust Fury and his minions as far as he could throw them- and that included Rogers. Thor seemed like a good guy but he was Loki’s brother. So he would earn Banner trust and alliance.
“So, Steven tell me more about yourself,” Anthony’s voice was velveted soft, lazy with provocation. But his gaze wasn’t lazy it was predatory, like an animal on the scent. “What do you do for a living?”
Just the thought of it made him felt ill. He had enough of the bond for one lifetime. He had lost both his parent’s love because of it, had become the object of their hatred and disdain because of it. And now that stupid bond tried to come between him and Pepper. NO fucking way he would let that happened!
It was just an image, not even in color, but Tony felt a bolt shot through his body. Captain America was still as youthful as he had been in those film reels that his dad used to keep around if a little was more tense around the eyes, and somber around the mouth. Something inside Tony twisted, and he was overcome with an intense feeling of longing.
He knew how it felt to have blood in your hands, to felt like a monster. Tony had dreams of ghosts hanging at his back or crawling toward him with blood pouring from their mouth and gazes corrupted with hatred boring. The dying, spluttering gasps play on repeat in every silent moment. He had felt his hands burn darker and darker, as his sins creep down beneath his butternut skin to grate against his bones as an ever-present reminder. The guilt gets heavier and heavier to bear and turning to face his past becomes an impossible task. His past sin was a combination of ego and ignorance that have created for him a noose that made it nearly impossible to breathe. The stains of his sins was so distorted on his hands and bones he could feel the filth of them at every waking hour. He wanted to end his life! Yet what good would suicide do but made him forever a murderer of countless of life and no longer hope for atonement.
The statistic that never got mentioned was that 2% of soul-bonded couples had broken up or divorced since the early 17th century. Every case highly publicized in the news because people believed soul-bonds were sacred and everlasting and wanted to know what went wrong.
For a second Steve looked hopeful and it hurt that Tony had to reject him again. The deep parts of Tony arched for him the most. Not just his body but his soul. Some parts spark. Others melt. It was a flux of chemistry and catastrophe. He needed to close his eyes to Steve’s beauty and his ears to his charm. But most of to turn himself into an impenetrable fortress to resist their pull of their bond
“Don’t.” Tony cut him off. “Just don’t, Rogers. This can never work out.” You’d have more luck mixing acid and potassium than they ever becoming friends. This was kinder for both of them.
As if reading his mind she wrapped her arms around him, pressed a kiss into his hair. “Yes, you could. You just needed time. I knew you, Tony, you would never break up with me if you didn’t feel really strongly for him.” She pointed out, ever the voice of reason. “And I would be with you every step of the way.”
“Look.” Tony said, “I know that you’re probably over the moon about having a Bond with someone.” His eyes met Steve’s and they were burning with an indefinable intensity. “But I already have someone and I would really appreciate it if you would keep the bond thing a secret.”
“And you think you’re so above me.” Steve’s voice tight and fierce. Anger boiled inside of him mixed it with bitter water and filled him, consumed him. He wanted to hit something or break something. He was afraid he’d hit Tony. ‘Why not? You know he had goaded you to hurt him since you both met. He probably a masochist.’ His mind supplied wickedly. “I’ve seen the footage….” his words dripped with scorn.
Captain America reflexively caught his shield and strapped it tight to his arm "That's enough!" the Captain ordered, glared daggers at the god-like alien, reigning in his anger at the Alien for hurting his mate. As much he wanted to beat the other Alpha down, he knew he needed to handle this calmly to avoid an intergalactic war
Steve didn't bother arguing he just grabbed Tony a second time. This time with both hands so Tony couldn't pull away before pushing him down the hall.
It was funny how the idiot thought he could ever match up to Tony in his suit. “Bring it on!” Tony snarled at his face, bared his teeth. He would show Captain fucking America that he didn’t have what it took to be a top dog!
Watching them from the driver’s seat. "Is that another Asgardian?" Natasha called over the sound of thunder outside. She hadn't gotten a good look at their intruder.
The hammer-wielding man looked around, realized he would've killed the man in blue spandex if he hadn't blocked in time. He immediately looked ashamed and nodded in agreement, to stand down.
And the brutal aroma of the Omega unfurled around Steve; so dark; so deep, it threatened to drown him; the rich, enthralling, allure that had to be illicitly addictive. Dangerous, demanding; the Dominant Omega Tony Stark.
Everyone waiting on earth jumped up and cheered saved from the violent death of the nuclear weapon aimed at them. All letting outs a breath they didn’t realize they’d been holding, exhausted relief washing over them. Fury looked down grimly, knew the sacrifice the heroic act had brought with it.
Anthony felt Steven stumbled backward, found his footing, and grappled with Anthony’s ass. Steven growled something low. Steven’s body felt like heaven against him, his arms like magic. Anthony undid Steven breeches in no time. His penis reared up, hard and eager. Anthony felt Steven’s desire roared like a wild beast. Steven groaned into his mouth and pulled off his beloved’s breeches. Then Steven lifted him higher. There was nothing but Steven. His skin. His scent.
Tony looked up at Rogers-who was reaching out to him- with contempt spread thick across his features. Rogers had no right to make him feel like this, not now, not when he could see himself spending the rest of his life with alpha as special as Pepper.
Steve entered the spare room only to see it was an art gallery. There were tins of various color paints; no doubt Tony had heard that Steve like to draw murals on his walls. Steve walked around like he was at a loss, a hand stretched out to touch the walls.
His hands were shaky as he poured himself a glass of gin even though he knew it couldn’t do anything to him… one of the downsides of the serum.
It’s only when Thor let out an exultant cry and Natasha huffed a laugh that Steve turned around and looked back up and suddenly saw a little human-like figure fell rapidly from the heavens. Oxygen once again rushed into him. He couldn’t help but gasped and broke into a smile. “Son of a gun!” Tears of relief spilled over, wetted his cheeks.
More references Steve didn't understand but he ignored it. “I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.”
Tony felt Steve’s grip on him loosened. “Be safe.” Captain America steeled his jaw and headed back into the ship. He had an archer and a spy to find.
Tony seemed to be mumbling to himself. "I gotta get this superconducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris." he surmised, looking around to figure out the puzzle. He tugged on the stuck rotors, fruitlessly.
I meant sure he knew one of his child going to be Steve’s soul-mate- possibly an Omega or Beta- but he never thought it would be his only child. And the fact that Tony surpassed him at a young age was salt to wound for Howard’s pride.
Maria wasn’t stupid she knew Howard would want a successor but she had hope that it would be much later. The big problem was Maria was young, enjoying her life to the fullest and focus on her modelling. She hated the idea of being burdened by a screaming, crying, puking baby. Even the idea of a baby swell inside her, like a cancerous growth made her felt sick.
Tony turned red with anger; it was Howard who had degraded Tony his whole life. The man loathed him so much for Tony’s presence reminded him of his failure in searching for Rogers and would take out all his anger and frustration on him
"That big; ugly..." Steve paused, noticing Tony's glare “…Building in New York?" Not quelled by Tony's persistent glare from across the desk, but Steve at least had the decency to look contrite.
After a quick signal from Steve, a loud clank sounded as Natasha landed the Quinjet; loading gate already opened. Then the Black Widow brought with her some equipment to restrain Loki who offered no resistance when he was shackled and loaded onto the Quinjet, meekly followed their orders. It made every one of Steve’s nerve stood on end, he was still doubtful about Loki's apparent surrender.
He and the other Avengers helped out the midtown clean-up efforts. Tony complained but they all knew he was glad to help. It was hard but fun. It was days after they finished helping out that pained him. Without anything to take his mind of everything he had lost, he easily fell back into his depression.
He pushed the car with his tiny hand and it stopped at someone feet. Fear curled in his stomach, he knew whose foot that was. “I thought I told you to focus on your study!” a voice growled.
Steve felt a surge of anger that he wrestled down quickly. "Howard is a great man." he said instead, carefully even.
Tony's eyes were disappointed and mocking. That was it the man was an idiot, he could be the other's leader but never Tony's.
Sighing he got up, carefully getting out of bed, tried not to wake his deeply asleep lover. He went lazily to the shower, showered and dressed then took an elevator to his lab. Turned on the coffeemaker, he asked JARVIS to play his usual music.
Their lips crashed against each other like swords. There was nothing of sex in any of it, nothing of tenderness, only passion meeting passion like a naked flame erupted between them, around them. Searing flame welled, swelled then raged through Steve, through Tony and burned. And they were no longer kissing, they were devouring each other. And it was all so perfect and -- oh God!
A dangerous glint in Bruce’s eyes, he let out a humorless chuckled “I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.”
Again Tony made his way to her mother. “Mommy, are you okay?” concern thick in his voice. His mom looked at him and he could see dark, furious rage directed primarily at him, for the first time his mother didn’t look pretty, her face contorted to something ugly and frightening.
As it was, he and Thor watched in surprise as a giant green shape launched itself at Tony with a roar, and snagged Iron Man only a couple of dozen feet before he hit the ground. Hulk cradled Tony close to his chest as he broke their descent with the building and then finally with his own body. Rubble and dust seemed to rain from their explosive impact. Hulk none too gently tossing the man off him to the concrete of the road.
That was about all Tony could handle, especially since he had so obviously failed Coulson. He stood up abruptly and walked out without a word. He might hurt Fury if he continued to be in that room.
Steve felt those words sunk into him like bullets. A bitter, cruel, and undeniable challenge, it was hard to think beyond the pain those words caused him. There was some degree of truth with it, but Steve had pushed himself 10 times harder than all the other soldiers so he could earn the opportunity to try the serum. It wasn't handed to him. He had earned his powers, just like he had earned the privilege of going out into battle!
It was refreshing as it was surprising for Bruce to finally have someone brought it up without even a flicker of hesitation. He could feel the other guy preened in the back of his mind. With what he used to read about Tony Stark he wondered if it was just childish curiosity and penchant for trouble. Even Betty couldn’t be fearless of him. She was simply able to look pass her fear.
Tony’s stomach tightened as he could felt Roger’s attention in the soles of his feet, the very air that he breathed, in his bone. He hated that he had to put an effort not to spare a glance or a glare at the super-soldier. Tony being Tony, it only took him a second before once again exerted his cold control, his mask of arrogance and security firmly back in place. He would show Roger’s how little control the bond had over him!
There was also the problem with his nightmares. The slightest noise would rouse him from sleep. But Pepper being the amazing woman she was, never complained once about his nightmares waking her. She understood that Obie’s betrayal had wounded him deeply and ripped his fragile and wary trust to shreds. She calmly talked him through those first few disorienting moments until his breathing calmed. Then she pulled his arms around her as he drifted back to sleep.
This Steve is different. For as hard as he’d been when they first met, nearly six years prior, he’s shed most of that. At least, he sheds it when they’re alone and he doesn’t have to worry about his duties as Captain America. He’s gone from being solid stone to a giant marshmallow with a tempered chocolate shell, and not for the first time, Tony resists the urge to yank Steve in by his collar and kiss him stupid until he cracks right open and comes spilling out, all ooey-gooey deliciousness.
“I’d like that very much,” Steve says seriously, with so much direct eye contact that Tony is immobilized by it. “If you’re okay with it.”
Tony chuckles, a low and easy rumble that Steve can feet down to the roots of the hairs on the tops of his big toes.
in fancy red lettering, and not for the first time since arriving, Steve marvels at the clear home that had been built in this Tower. “There was this whole lead-up, I had to send the murder twins to South Korea and pray they held up their end of the American Express bargain, and Banner used some kind of alien stone - ”
“Here’s the thing,” Tony says, twisting the lock behind them before turning to face Steve, back to the door and arms crossed over his chest. “You can kiss me like a virgin under the bleachers all you want. I can do that, if that’s all you want for right now. But when you keep touching me like you have all day, it kind of sends mixed messages.”
And Steve is reluctantly prepared to admit that no, he doesn’t remember much after the strip club and that’s why he doesn’t think that anything about spending time with Tony is a good idea when a vaguely familiar man approaches.
Tony knocks aside the primitive, childish urge to stick his fingers in the gaping hole in Steve’s thigh, because aside from being inappropriately close to his groin, it’s also more than a little gross.
“Oh!” Steve cries out, and he’s so utterly present that Tony wants to shout, wants to make sure some abstract power out there knows that only he gets Steve like this. “Oh, Tony - ”
“You know all about me.” His eyes are intent, fingers bluntly squared off as he drums them on the slightly tacky tabletop.
“You ever give up the gig? Or are you like, permanently on call? Always sniffing out the latest scoop?” Tony’s not quite as demanding as he’d been five minutes earlier, but there is a weariness in the way his hand scrubs over his neatly trimmed signature facial hair that makes Steve want to give him an inch. He knows an inch with Tony can turn into a mile faster than anyone on planet Earth can run one, but old habits die hard.
“Because as it turns out, there’s a bit of nostalgia in me after all,” Tony says, and he’s grinning ruefully. “It’s just something I want to do. For you, for me, who knows? Maybe it’s for my old man. If you don’t want it, I’ll give it to someone else. Hell, you don’t even have to use it. I can let Morgan use it as a sled in the winter.”
Not that he can blame her, he thinks once he’s made it through security and is clutching his boarding pass and a greasy breakfast sandwich that’s only marginally settling his still-roiling stomach. He’s crossed a line, a dozen lines, and while he’s sure that Tony brings people home all the time -
Tony tips his head. His eyes are thoughtful, critical, and Steve refuses to allow himself to squirm. He keeps as steady as he can, pushing back the threatening panicked eruption until he can be alone.
She perks up once they arrive, and it’s true that on a Tuesday afternoon the beach is mostly empty. There are a few surfers and a particularly handsy couple that Tony snorts at as he watches Steve set up towels and chairs and an umbrella. He wants to ask why Tony’s got all this stuff on hand, but then Steve watches Tony slide a pair of water wings on Morgan’s upper arms and he doesn’t need to.
“All of it.” Steve’s mouth feels dry, his tongue sandpaper against the backs of his teeth. “I let so much go unsaid.”
But then the seamless glass melts out of existence and Tony appears, smiling so big and genuine that his eyes nearly disappear.
“Someone got a little clumsy here,” Tony says, reluctantly pulling himself out of the very comfortable chair. “Knocked over a bunch of stuff, had to clean it up - ”
Instead of snarking back or anything of the like, Tony’s face goes queerly soft and his knuckles whiten around the door frame before releasing entirely, the door resting open just a fraction of a hair.
The cashier is definitely at least past retirement age and couldn’t care less about who they are or what they’re talking about, thank fuck. Tony slots his card into the machine and considers his response.
“Oh, chocolate chip pancakes!” Peter says excitedly when he appears, his pajamas dragging on the floor and wrinkles from his pillow still pressed into half his face. Steve’s not entirely sure he’s awake, but then he asks if he can get some eggs going, and Tony moans out a yes that has Steve looking at him sternly.
There are so many places Steve could take this, and he folds the pizza box back together as he plots out the different courses of action. There’s an instinct to rip up everything he’s ever written about Tony Stark, to refuse to finish the article for TIME, to launch a smear campaign on what a manipulating piece of shit the man has always been. Underneath, he wants to fold himself up until he can’t feel anything anymore, so he can finish the piece and then return to life as normal, tenderly crafting odes to a past lover under the guise of working. Maybe he needs to pick up journaling, or therapy. he thinks with a chuckle aborted in the base of his throat, cutting off his air supply.
Tony wants to crawl into his lap and under his skin until there’s negative space between them, but settles for asking, “Can I show you something?”
a powerful motivator. And now, TIME is nothing Steve can turn his nose up at and Tony had seemed genuine about his intentions for a minute there, but he has repeatedly demonstrated how capable he is at getting others to do what he wants regardless of how questionable the motive is.
When he pulls away, Steve misses him instantly. He doesn’t chase the feel of him, though, settling for raising an eyebrow.
The SuperTarget is blissfully cool, the AC on full blast, and Steve commandeers a cart with all the authority of the former Captain America as Tony pulls his slightly sweaty shirt away from his body.
For a moment Steve thinks it’s going to be terrifying, that he’s going to lose the ability to breathe and he’ll freeze up inappropriately and reveal himself as the worst kind of person in the entire world. But that doesn’t happen, and he just leans back a little to look at the kid in his arms, and smiles at her wobbly smile and slightly watery eyes.
“He’s not going to be forgotten,” Tony says with conviction. “We’re not going to let that happen. And you heard him. He might be one of the most self-deprecating bastards I’ve ever met, second only to you, but he meant something to people in his universe. No matter where he ends up, they’re going to remember him the way he deserves.”
Steve gets in the pool with her, swimming laps until she clings to his back, all high-pitched squeals and giggles in his ear as he drags her around. Tony watches from a lounger, working away on a tablet even as Morgan splashes him.
He trails fingertips down Tony’s arm, traces the delicate bones of his wrist and then lightly tickles up exposed abdominals until he’s sketching over where he knows the scars from the arc reactor spread out. Tony doesn’t seem bothered, his breathing approaching that evenness that Steve knows like he’d always known the weight of his shield.
“JARVIS can help,” he offers. “In the kitchen. Or you can order in, whatever you like. You see how Natasha abuses the city’s delivery boys and the team credit card.”
He gorges himself on minuscule crab cakes and Kobe sliders. The open bar has his favorite scotch but that doesn’t stop him from swigging champagne whenever it’s handed to him. In the back of his mind he’s aware of Rogers’ hulking form, poured into expertly tailored dress blues (military event then, probably) and politely shaking hands with everyone vying for his attention. He looks like he’d rather be anywhere else, starched and uncomfortable with a perpetually full flute of champagne looking like a doll’s accessory in his expansive hands.
Tony’s everywhere from the start, wide hand a brand through to his thigh while the other curls into the meat of Steve’s shoulder before finding Steve’s face. He holds him there, palm flat and insistent against his cheek, kissing like he’s afraid Steve might run away at any moment. Only that doesn’t make any sense; surely any second now Tony will realize he’s kissing some second-rate moron who turns into a stuttering irresponsible imbecile every time they meet. After that, he’ll come to and see what a horrible error in judgment this is, hopefully saving Steve from having to admit that he’s the one who’s making a mistake.
Steve breathes easy as Rogers leaves him and joins Tony. He watches as Rogers touches the back of Tony’s hand to get his attention, and feels his own mouth curve into a smile as Tony looks up at Rogers.
Steve lifts their joined hands to kiss their knuckles, and Tony stares, enthralled despite the nervous roiling inside of him.
“I’m torn between wanting to ask if you were ever in that sort of a situation as a teenager, because I’m really doubting it, and slamming you up against the door until you’re begging me to stop.” It’s so matter of fact, his voice inhumanly level; meanwhile Tony bites down hard on the inside of his cheek to keep from letting out a moan at the mere prospect.
“Just pick some in your size and let's move on,” Tony says impatiently, having thrown a fistful of options in the cart. “I’m getting some of these t-shirts, by the way, you want your usual size or one that actually fits properly?”
Steve’s fingers squeeze almost too tight, five pinpricks of pain accompanied by the faint crush of wood.
The men’s room is gratefully empty with the exception of a young cater-waiter on his way out, and Steve takes care of business as quickly as he can before contemplating splashing water on his face. Ultimately he decides against messing up the pomade and concealer Christine had coaxed him into allowing her styling team to push on him, and is about to head out and make his way to the curb when the door smacks open, ricocheting against the wall to reveal -
“I know,” he says, just as unnecessary. “But you and I’ve only really spent time together under more structured circumstances, so to be invited here in the first place was unexpected.” He shakes his head. “I thought you’d want to meet at a restaurant or a hotel bar. Or the Tower, even. I didn’t really think you’d invite me out here.”
“You hate feeling useless,” Pepper supplies as he ambles alongside slightly untidy hedges and pretty multicolored flowers wrapping around the side of the house.
and there’s stuff about ethics in his chosen profession swirling around his suddenly gooey brain. It takes all he’s got to shake his head, because even if he knows that it means nothing, that Tony loves to flirt like he loves to fly and save lives, his body refuses to get the memo. There’s a too-warm rush down his front, swirling around his navel, and he isn’t some newbie anymore, he should be better than this, better than falling for Tony’s well-practiced tactics and tendency to harmlessly seduce at least half the people he comes across.
“Yeah, I’m gonna need more than that,” Tony says, gripping the edge of his desk and wheeling himself in tight under the surface as he exaggeratedly reaches as if to grasp the phone sat in the corner, almost too far away to realistically access. “Otherwise, I’m calling a shrink. Or 911.”
“My father works a lot,” Tony remarks, nibbling at his toast. He doesn’t even sound sad and Steve hates it, knowing that the wheels are in motion and that everything will go as it should, exactly as he wanted it to.
“Because I don’t remember, and I don’t know if I wish I could,” Steve admits, and the shame clogs his throat. It takes a long pause to fight past the thick, slimy, crawling knot of humiliation, and Tony remains just as quiet. “I remember the pool, and the strip club, and waking up naked and feeling like I was missing something. I don’t remember what happened, only that we got on a plane. Except I’m not entirely sure that I remember that on my own, because I might just be remembering the extrapolation of events and the confirmation from when you told me that I nearly got sick.”
He lifts a single eyebrow in her direction. “You want a refresher on how invasively inappropriate that would be?”
And yet, on Christmas morning, he watches the kids open small piles of presents for the first time in years, and he feels like maybe he’s less empty than he used to be.
“You invited me here presumably without any kind of agenda, for one,” Tony starts, holding up a single finger with the hand that isn’t loosely holding his beer. “You’ve been acting all kinds of weird since we got here.” He puts up a second finger. “And you keep touching me, which hey, I’m not complaining about, but you can’t tell me it’s not out of the ordinary.” Steve doesn’t even flinch as Tony waves three fingers in his face, coming dangerously close to knocking the lip of his bottle past his reluctantly grinning mouth and smack-dab into his perfect teeth. “If you really want a fourth one, we can talk about what we’re going to do with the house, because if you have a plan, it might be worth sharing with the class.”
“How I feel isn’t important,” he says, once he’s taken a few sips and set the glass back down. Tony opens his mouth like he wants to argue with that, so before he can, Steve moves on to another question. “There’s been a lot of talk surrounding the autonomy of superheroes, and in the last several months, many super-powered humans have caught the public’s eye. How do you feel about the pressure on and within the government for an increase in regulation of these types of individuals?”
Tony swallows, scanning Steve from head to toe, because he knows that if he doesn’t do it now, he’ll be too distracted later on to catalogue it properly. His hair is a disaster zone, courtesy of both Tony and the pillows, and every inch of his body seems primed for this. From the rosiness making its way down his neck to his chest, to the leaking tip of his velvet-hard cock, it’s vulnerability stripped down to its bare bones.
“No,” Tony says bitterly. “You just left without telling anyone where you were going, without any way for us to contact you.”
She just pulls her left leg up to rest on the seat, and they settle into easy conversation about life in the compound. Words come much more readily from her than ever before, and while she’ll never be as talkative as Sam, he’s content to let the lulls come and go as they make their way through the suburbs and into the country.
“What I think isn’t important,” Steve repeats for what feels like the millionth time. “What’s important is that the world is torn between admiration and condemnation, and - ”
Steve books reservations even though he hates using his name for selfish reasons, and they sit through tasting menus even when it’s clear that Steve is unsure of every coming bite. Tony knows when to clear Steve’s plate for him and when to turn his own food over, loving that he can go purely off minute muscle twitches and still get it right every time.
“Would you like some lemonade?” Steve asks, footsteps heavy as he walks to the kitchen, slow but sure on his feet. He hears Tony close the door and follow him, but by the time he has added the mint and poured two glasses, Tony is still winding his way through the house, presumably investigating every nook and cranny. Patient, Steve sits at the breakfast table and waits, re-reading the morning newspaper.
“You laugh,” Steve says, doing his best to hold back a chuckle of his own, “but look who stole the last of it.”
cupping, leaning in with bated breath and so utterly focused on forging ahead and doing what he’s always wanted to do -
Hell, Tony doesn’t even know how long Steve was planning on staying. They hadn’t discussed travel arrangements, or lodging, or anything, and it’s only now hitting him that they’re a few hundred miles from the compound with nothing but one of Tony’s cars and the clothes on their backs. Nighttime is rapidly approaching, and it’s a testament to Tony’s patience and tolerance wherever Steve is concerned that he’s let it go this far without stepping in and leaving his overbearing and control-freak prints all over it.
“You regret it.” Steve repeats it plainly, deliberately, and watches Tony for the second the underlying meaning registers.
Perhaps a draft is to blame, but Steve feels a ripple of goosebumps at the nape of his neck as he gets his feet underneath him.
“It’s perfectly safe.” Tony is attempting to cajole him, even as Steve rests his hands on his waist and shakes his head. “Unless you’re prone to motion sickness, in which case I ask that you give a guy a little warning, because I might not be a sympathy vomiter but the joints are pretty delicate and - ”
“I’ve been asking myself for months,” Tony says, and the words are the kind that should rage against the dying light, but instead they're just resigned. When they look at each other, Steve can feel the exhaustion settling in. “I’ve been asking myself what I did wrong. Did I wait too long to give back the shield? Should I have had Pepper insist you stay with us? Should I have chased you down as soon as I knew you left town?”
He just waits there with the dumb smirk on his face, the one Tony is constantly torn between wanting to kiss or punch. Tony crosses his arms against his chest, then uncrosses them, letting out a brief huff.
It’s not a come-on, Steve tells himself firmly. Tony’s got Pepper and Steve’s got - he’s got - he’s got
“Doesn’t Stark count as an A-list celebrity?” he asks after a beat during which he’s sure Christine notices his preoccupation.
“This is private property,” Tony returns. “Any neighbors peeping through their front windows will just add to the 1950s charm of the place.”
A muted crash sounds back from inside his apartment, reverberating against the thick glass windows. It’s loud enough to have him turning quickly, nearly knocking the phone four stories down, but he saves it at the last split-second and squints into the dim light of his living room to see nothing more than a body being thrown onto the couch, feet kicking up on a sturdy wooden table. The source of the noise, he quickly concludes, is the television remote that’s been thrown back onto the catchall tray in the center of the table.
and Steve panics, searching for his phone as the early morning sun sears into the forefront of his pounding head.
“Here,” Steve murmurs, and easily works Tony’s shirt up and off, and Tony immediately draws them together from shoulder to hip, cursing under his breath and burying his face in Steve’s neck.
“I don’t think you’ve been humble a day in your life,” Steve says dubiously, mouth quirking up into an almost-smile, the color in his face already receding.
“That’s very nice of you,” Rogers says with a quick nod and the ghost of a smile, and then he’s gone.
They’d driven down from the compound sometime after lunch without much of an itinerary. The entire plan had consisted of Steve turning to him a week after they’d sent his older counterpart back into his original universe, asking if he’d be willing to check out the house situation with him, and Tony merely replying that he could arrange to have his weekend schedule cleared. It figures, really. The two of them aren’t exactly the plan ahead type, too used to improvising under pressure, and this is no exception.
The Avengers keep busy, and that’s fine. Steve doesn’t need Tony’s undivided attention; he only needs Tony sometimes, enough to make sure the time machine is ready to go when he needs it. He watches as Tony progresses, watches as he improves the tech and gear of everyone on the team, and otherwise stays out of the way.
He’s overcompensating, he knows, trying to cling to something before it threatens to retreat. He’s frenetic, kissing Steve over and over and running hands up and down his back to keep him close in case he feels like trying to get away, and Tony knows he couldn’t stop a determined Steve Rogers even if he wanted to, but he’s not missing this.
Carol ducked out during the wee hours of the morning, which was a surprise to approximately nobody. Rhodes shakes Steve’s hand and there’s a silent conversation, and Steve knows that if he doesn’t do right by Tony and Morgan, he’ll be getting his ass kicked by the War Machine armor.
“Denise and Josie are right about not talking to strangers,” Steve says, pushing her hair off her face. “And I’ll talk to Beth about letting people in without adult permission. Okay?”
“I’ve never done this before,” he says plainly, and Tony feels a rush of such overwhelming fondness.
The touch on the back of his neck disappears and Tony’s head swivels instinctively to see Steve looking mildly sheepish, now rubbing the back of
“Absolutely not,” he says, gradually raising himself up so he can look into Steve’s earnest eyes. “That is absolutely
“You’re not really on the clock anymore,” Tony says, doing a fantastic impression of sobriety as he licks his lips spit-shiny and stares intently at the side of Steve’s face. Steve only knows because he’s looking right back, trying not to and failing miserably. “So if that’s the only issue - ”
“I want to know what you think,” Tony insists after an hour or so, now sprawled out on the furniture with one heel propped up on the table and his arms crossed under his head. Steve hasn’t moved since sitting down except to cross and uncross his legs.
“Veto,” Tony repeats, bopping her on the nose, and she ducks out of the way and grabs her drink. “We’ll run over more viable options on the way home.”
(Which means that he’s ninety-nine percent sure that it would be news to Steve, who would protest and attempt to disprove the very notion if Tony ever endeavored to get him to see it.)
“How about this,” he starts, and when Steve tries to argue, he’s suddenly being smothered by a warm hand. Tony’s got his palm pressed solidly against Steve’s mouth, fingers still smeared with grease and smelling of burning metal and coconut hand soap as they curve towards Steve’s jaw. The gesture isn’t as jolting as it might’ve been once, the sensation dulled where it hadn’t been the last time Tony’s made contact there, but it reeks of informal intimacy.
"... I owe you an apology. You did well, Tony." Tony's eyes opened as Rogers landed on the ground next to him with a thud. Rogers’ alpha pheromone impinged on his senses, his nearness reached for him, wrapped insidiously around him, tempting him closer. Rogers was TOO CLOSE for his liking.
Before he even realized it, he found himself heading to the lab Tony working in. Tony made his blood boil with rage, but he also made him want, made him feel alive again. He needed to see what the other half of his soul was up to. He wanted to be near Tony.
Tony shook himself from that thought. This was the main reason why he needed to stop this bullshit! He was never his usual self whenever he was around Steve! The man was like a typhoon that could easily sweep him away if he let his guard down. He was a Dom of Dom, he needed the control.
Tony was waiting for Steve… Captain America right by the elevator. He stood up straighter: sharp, crisp, composed. Not Tony but Iron Man.
He couldn’t bring himself to say the words; they caught in his throat as he searched for any sign of Tony’s brightly colored suit. There was no trace of him and Steve had to say the words. He tried to force them up to his throat and out of his lips…
He waited with bated breath to hear Tony say something and let out a sigh of relief when his soulmate did.
Tony continued, liking the look of Steve’s face even as the bond railed against him. Then he smirked and delivered the final blow to Roger’s humongous pride. “You would rather be my dead father’s soulmate. HAH, I would RATHER GO CELIBATE FOR LIFE than even entertain the idea of being with you!” Rogers would break more than a couple of his bones for this!
After failed in replicated the super-serum, searched for Captain America and revolutionized the arc reactor, Howard hated that another thing in his life had failed. He had turned all that hatred and frustration to his only child!
Steve backpedalled slightly, looked over at Doc. Banner "No offense, Doc." he said, pairing it with a placated hand gesture in Doc. Banner's general vicinity.
“I can close it. Can anybody copy?” She said into her wrist receiver, holding the staff steady in her hand as she waited to hear from her teammates. “I can shut the portal down.” She clarified, panting and staring into the glowing revolving tesseract power pouring out of the machine in front of her.
He heard a familiar baseball game on the radio… that couldn’t be right. He became instantly alert as he heard the sound of footsteps closing in from outside. A pretty Omega in a nurse uniform entered the room. Her lips curled into a charming and smile at the sight of him. “Morning…” she looked at the watch on her right wrist-- a watch he had never seen before, even Howard couldn’t make a watch that small “… or should I say afternoon. You’re in a recovery room in New York City.” His enhanced senses razor-focused sensed her racing pulse, notice the tension in her shoulders and fear in her eyes.
A few moments later, Iron Man came across the nuke headed right for midtown and turned immediately to follow it.
Tony unwilling to admit even to himself that a big part of him couldn’t bring himself to let his soul-mate stuck in ice even if he thought Rogers was long dead. “I…” he could choose not to answer at all or said he was after the serum in Steve’s blood but somehow he felt compelled to answer with the truth even if it was only a half-truth.
The blond paused outside the door, still torn apart by the possibility of Fury keeping secrets, decided to do a little investigating himself.
JARVIS pulled up the location ‘Stuttgart Germany, 28 Coolins, Straza’ and Tony repulsor blasted his way toward the scene.
Tony felt like he was looking at a vicious tiger in the eyes, unpredictable and powerful, and it was so fucked up that he was fucking turn on by it.
But of course, Captain Bigot was too proud and arrogant to recognize that, which was such a 1940 century alpha thing to do that he shouldn’t have been surprised. After all, Rogers came from the same generation as his bastard of a father and Obie.
Loki’s held Thor gaze, his eyes unreadable “Did you mourn?” Loki asked, almost mocking and goading Thor.
The only thing he knew was he couldn't lose his focus on those eyes, captured by, trapped in, a pair of big, well-set, freaking beautiful heavy-lidded eyes the color of brown and green and gold were melted together and lit on fire brown. Those eyes held him entranced, he felt like he could stare at those eyes forever.
It pained him to see the little things Tony would do for Thor and Bruce like making a cabinet in the kitchen wholly dedicated to the various flavors special brand of tea for Bruce and Pop-Tarts for Thor.  He even prepared a zen garden and a green-house for his Brucie-bear. Not to mention making time to play chest with Bruce and watched period dramas with Thor despite his busy schedule. All this coupled with the fact that most of Tony’s past lover was... Beta made Steve wondered if Tony would prefer if his soulmate was Bruce instead.
“He gives up the Cube and he's all yours. Until then…” Tony said, flipping his mask down to show he meant business. “Stay out of my way…” he turned his back and strode away, grumbling under his breath as he went “Tourist.”
Children were taught about how perfect, wonderful and sacred soul-bond and Twin-flame were since they could speak. Notwithstanding the bullshit that TV and adults tried to brainwash children with things like 'Something about being with your soul-mate made your blood sang with the serene hum of Zen gardens and all the ever-lasting beauty and joy of meeting your soul-mate.'
Tony had reached the monitors, without sparing a single glance at the super-soldier and it angered Steve. Tony looked at the monitors.
“Is this not your natural state?” Loki walked through the crowd. “It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power…” Loki's eyes glanced over the kneeling humans, all too afraid and lowered their eyes or already done so “for identity.”
Tony held back a shudder and tore his eyes away from Rogers. Why did he let JARVIS persuaded him to give the tour in person again? He should have just order JARVIS to do it. ‘Because you really missed and cared about him’ his traitorous mind supplied. He wouldn’t let a stupid bond rule over his life… especially after it had cost him his best relationship. The Omega hated how easily Steve undid the control he had spent 13 years and more perfecting. He needed to corral Rogers’ siren-like allure.
Then he realized that he was in the bed he shared with the Alpha he loved. Pepper was lying beside him and could have heard his moaning St-no, Rogers--don’t start calling his first name just because of one measly sex dream.
"I remember a shadow…” his eyes pained. “Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!" Loki replied, raising his voice at the last words.
Rogers looked away, rolled his eyes. It annoyed Tony so much, that the Captain America behaved like Shield lapdog. Didn't he heard what Tony and Banner said, some leader...
Tony heard the bone-deep despair sound of Rogers internally screaming his name through the bond and he couldn’t contain the tear that fell from his eye… ‘If there is a next life…’
Spurred into action, Steve quickly prevented a second shot by launching his shield at him; it clanged off Loki's armor and ricocheted back. Steve charged, his shield slipping back on his arm as his punch connected with Loki’s jaw causing his head to snap to the side.
Howard betrayal hurt so much that there were days Maria could barely function. She was a mess. She wished she could rip her heart out of her chest
Without letting himself think about it further, Steven brought his mouth to his. The kiss was instantly deep, instantly seeking. Anthony drank him in, absorbed his scent.
Steve’s body was pulsing with an electric charge. He contained his enthusiasm it was enough that Tony was alive and safe. He needed to wait until Tony was ready or it would only backfire.
Tony’s beauty struck him like a lightning strike, searing his senses. A pull almost overwhelming to process, far stronger than anything he ever felt toward Howard. He was staring back at Tony and he felt like everything slowed down, like everything fell to silent, at that moment he couldn't even tell if he was still breathing or not, even the sound of own heart-beat was lost to him.
Tony looked defiant for a moment before he forced himself to calm down. This wasn’t the time to argue, he needed to appeal to Captain America. “We needed to stall him, Captain. I could buy us some time.” The one who said this wasn’t the sarcastic billionaire anymore but Iron Man. The Super-soldier gripped on him tightened. “Captain.” he pushed. “Think of the civilians at risk.”
"Look, it's not that hard." Tony insisted, ignored the sound of Roger’s voice and his Alpha pheromone that called out to him like a siren call.
“Shut up!” Howard growled. “I could do whatever the hell I like! Don’t forget who paid for everything around here!”
“The guy's all over the place,” Natasha Romanoff mumbled to herself as she watched Steve and Loki fight from her aircraft
"Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?" Tony asked, instinctively placed his hand on Rogers' shoulder, as if looking for more support.
Rogers continued to put his foot in his mouth, bristled Tony even more with how blatantly insensitive he was being in front of Bruce.
Steve’s eyes followed the brunet, his mouth in a tight line before he sighed and set his shield against a wall and walked out.
Nearing the coordinate supplied by his AI, he saw a crowd of people and a jet hovers overhead. Tony looked down towards the front of the crowd and of course, the so call alien god adorn in emerald green battle armor, complete with gaudy golden helmet horns and magical glowing scepter battling a man in a blue spandex uniform-Captain America. Because hey, let’s just hang out while an alien with superpower and a super-soldier battling nearby while a jet hovers overhead ready to shoot. And Pepper said he had a survival instinct of a moth…
“You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.” Steve’s voice as hard as iron.
