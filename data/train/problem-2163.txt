‘‘Oy!’’ John exclaimed, slapping Sherlock’s arse playfully, which made Sherlock’s eyes widen and his brain functions stop momentarily.
John froze upon seeing Sherlock Holmes, the love of his life, completely immobilized by fear and shame. The first thing that John thought was that he was going to kill Mycroft with his bare hands.
‘‘John’’ Sherlock said, his voice filled with wonder, as if John showing him love was the last thing that he expected. So John consequently, and naturally, decided to kiss him in every available surface. He kissed Sherlock’s tears and sadness away, considering a victory when Sherlock giggled after he nuzzled the detective’s neck.
‘‘What… what about you?’’
‘‘I don’t know’’ John swallowed the water fast, a drop of it running down his chin. He wiped it angrily, ‘‘I’m taking more shifts at the hospital too’’
‘‘Of course, I know. A John person. My John’’ John wondered if Sherlock was even aware of what he was saying at this point.
Sherlock finally lowered his hands, ‘‘It isn’t? You want me for more than just... that?’’
John nodded, taking a deep breath, and smiled. He smiled his real smile, not his pretend one. He let Sherlock see it, again. He vouched to always let Sherlock see it, from now own. He took the envelops, noting that they had dates in the back, and were in order from the oldest to the newest.
‘‘It only works if you induce a reality that the subject would accept’’ Mycroft walked towards them, closing the door behind him and thus separating them from his soldiers. ‘‘I couldn’t prevent him from doing his applications on you, so I… assisted him. And I made sure that your health was cared for’’
Said detective was lying on his bed, bellow his covers. Only his face was visible and it was the most frightened John had ever seen it. John just took a moment to look at him.
‘‘I don’t see why that’s funny’’ John frowned, looking genuinely hurt ‘‘That way everyone wins’’ and Sherlock just laughed harder.
‘‘William, I know when you are hiding something’’ John said keeping a straight face. Sherlock was unable to stop himself from giggling, falling backwards on his bed, and John followed right after. He sat cross-legged on Sherlock’s bed, looking at him with so much affection that Sherlock had to take a deep breath.
‘‘I volunteered’’
‘‘John, you are not paying attention’’ Sherlock returned the video again and paused it ‘‘this is about a serial killer that, between the years 2006 and 2010, brutally murdered thirty three women all over the UK. The official report said twenty six but I’ve discovered the final seven in other cold cases. Our capable Scotland Yard failed to see the connection, apparently’’
After Irene Adler, however, Sherlock distanced himself, and their intimacy was reduced to what casual acquaintances have. Well, to what colleagues have. No more hands brushing against shoulders, and definitely no more penis jokes. Again, John’s priorities were the ones of a trash can, and so not in the right place.
Once they were alone, Sherlock turned to look at John with uncertainty, and John placed one hand on Sherlock’s waist and one on his cheek. Sherlock put the tip of his index finger on John’s nose. ‘‘Don’t look at me like that’’ he whispered, but his eyes were soft and his lips were forming a shy smile.
‘‘How was the trip, Johnny?’’ the woman Sherlock deduced to be Harry Watson said as she greeted them at the airport. She was resting her elbows on an unnecessary metal fence (just there to make her look good, apparently), with her indigo eyes, short brown hair and just a general rock star attitude.
Harry raised her eyebrows. Then she laughed, ‘‘Yeah, mate. That was obvious from the start. Why would he be upset with you, though?’’
Harry smiled, but then her face turned alarmed when John pulled out his phone. ‘‘What, right here?’’
Sherlock turned his head slightly so that John could see his smile, but remained with his back to him, strategically hiding his blush.
LONDON Nw1
‘‘I’m going to need you to get your head out of your arse John, for God’s sake’’
Sherlock blinked rapidly, a flutter of eyelashes, and for a solid minute he just gaped at John. Said army doctor patiently waited for Sherlock’s next move, which was to say ‘‘I’m sorry, I stopped listening when you touched my face, what did you say?’’
‘‘Right. Well, I can give you more cold cases, if you want’’ Lestrade finally said, picking some files from his bottom drawer before Sherlock could even answer and giving them to him. Sherlock looked at the pile for a second, trying to decide what to do.
John laughed again, giggling until his forehead came to rest on Sherlock’s chest. He lifted his face, running his nose up Sherlock’s neck and murmured ‘‘would you mind terribly if I kissed you?’’ which effectively reduced Sherlock to a pile of goose bumps.
‘‘You can’’ he said, smiling, then he sighed ‘‘Do you know why I always remind you of Redbeard?’’
Sherlock tried to breathe out the discomfort, the smell of Tabaco the least of his concerns ‘‘Did you… like her?’’
He shook his head, ‘‘I don’t know why you are so reticent on being alone and miserable’’
‘‘Yes, Sherlock, I have met John’’ Lestrade said, pinching the bridge of his nose while John laughed.
The inside of the box had unequal rectangular compartments, and in each of them were ‘John related’ things. In one of them was a stack of pictures of him, some of which were clearly stolen from the med school and military related photo albums, and others that Sherlock must have taken himself. John looked at each of them in a daze, wondering why Sherlock had kept them. In another compartment were his dog tags, or, better still, one of his tags, which lacked the string. He remembered the last time that he had seen them.
Eric’s eyebrows raised and he was about to say something when Sherlock intervened ‘‘John knew that the war was inevitable, so he went to use his abilities to save lives, in an environment where many were lost’’ He kissed John’s lips ‘‘He is the bravest man I have ever known’’
John got up, looking down at Robert as his features relaxed, as his frown disappeared. Sherlock watched as the strongest man he knew finally reached closure from the darkness of his childhood.
-I’m your…
‘‘You don’t
And Sherlock said, rather quickly and without stopping to take a breath ‘‘Moriarty was in the roof and he said that I should kill myself or else he would kill you. But I thought that that would happen so me and Mycroft-’’ And John interrupted him with a ‘shh’ to his ear.
‘‘It’s up there’’ He smiled cordially, and Robert raised his eyebrows, leading the way.
‘‘Yes. You are incredibly smart and full of intuition for some things and dim for others’’
‘‘Sherlock Holmes’’ John’s voice lowered several notes, the captain in him finally having enough, ‘‘You are insensitive, at times. But never cruel’’ He took a step back, looking at Sherlock up and down, ‘‘Cruelty doesn’t suit you’’
John hummed, biting at those nubs until Sherlock moaned loudly. ‘‘Maybe its beside the usual culprit’’ he felt Sherlock’s heart through his lips. Its rhythm was erratic, which almost made the doctor in him worried.
This time Sherlock frowned, ‘‘What does she have to do with anything?’’
‘‘Promise’’ Sherlock begged. He was begging, John realized, on his knees, ‘‘Please, promise me’’
‘‘Enough’’ The older woman said, and she looked like she was trying not to laugh. Sherlock knew that she would help him before she even got up from her chair, so he smiled at her in gratitude. ‘‘I’ll get you the letters’’ she said ‘‘But you’ll have to look through them in front of us’’.
And Sherlock feel asleep, warmed by the embrace of John Watson, his army doctor, his home.
John wished he had enough brain capacity at the moment to know what the rational, adult thing to do is.
Sherlock smiled, relieved at John’s lighter tone, ‘‘I do’’
‘‘Oh’’
‘‘We need to talk about this, before we do anything’’
‘‘You were always pathetic. You asked for a divorce to get my money, and then had to do monstrosities to see it through’’
’’ John sang, quite awkwardly, and Sherlock just took a deep breath before saying.
‘‘Jesus Christ’’ John muttered to himself, ‘‘Throw a pity party, while you’re at it’’
about you. Don’t talk about how upset you are, don’t act like you’re disappointed. He will already hate himself for failing, and he will probably think that he is unworthy of your affection and time. All you should do is care for him’’ Clara had said, her voice, even over the phone, was soft ‘‘Be a doctor, John’’
‘‘That was… amazing’’ John said, as he cuddled Sherlock in his arms and kissed his face. Sherlock smiled as he remembered the first time John had said that, in response to Sherlock’s deductions about him, so long ago.
Sigh, ‘‘Not my dog tags either’’
John nodded, even though Sherlock couldn’t see him. He tried to busy himself with the dishes because his hands were starting to shake a little. Had he always felt his emotions like this? Was he always this... sensitive? His father would have a field day punching it out of him.
John groaned loudly, and his hips moved on their own accord. Sherlock hollowed his cheeks and relaxed his jaw, and that sight alone threatened to make John in, ‘‘I’m coming, baby’’
‘‘Tell me about her’’ He whispered, and John didn’t need to ask who he was talking about.
me to be with you. This person’s plan seems to rely on me believing that you hate me and don’t want me in your life any more’’ Sherlock waited for John to argue. When he didn’t, Sherlock continued ‘‘That’s what I meant when I said that the memories were thematic. They were about you’’
Given all the facts, Sherlock was trying harder than ever to make John happy. He finished the piece and carefully placed the bow and violin in their case, just as John murmured ‘‘that was lovely, Sherlock’’
When they arrived, Harry was in the living room with Alice, smoking a cigarette. She put it out as soon as she saw them, rising from the couch to meet them. ‘‘Are you okay?’’ she asked, her gazing shifting from John to Sherlock, not really sure who she was most worried about.
He half expected Sherlock to follow him, but the detective didn’t. I was almost worse that he didn’t. Now John would have time to think.
John smiled.
Premise: Marry Watson was a manipulative person. John asked her to marry him because she forced him to. He adjusted every last aspect of his life to accommodate her. She didn’t like having sex with him, only when she did, which was two months before the wedding.
The case, as it turned out, was barely a two. Sherlock realized this as he walked in and took a look at his surroundings.
After a couple of minutes of silence his phone rang. John answered it without looking at the screen, a smiling.
Sherlock smiled, caressing John’s bare chest with his other hand. ‘‘Let’s stay here’’ he whispered, feeling something, which he couldn’t name, flutter in his chest. There was a deduction waiting to happen, so he looked at John with narrowed eyes, which made John frown.
‘‘There is the added benefit of cheaper groceries, too. I don’t mind the vegan beefs or vegan snacks, you know? Just give me some broccoli’’
They went through the motions, pretending they were Sherlock-and-John. Sherlock analysed everything quietly and inquired John’s opinion. John interviewed the witnesses and interested parties because he was better with people, while Sherlock lurked nearby, attentive. Sherlock deduced the husband’s blame and offered evidence. John said ‘amazing’ when it was due.
in his mind like a mantra. He rose from the bed and squared his shoulders, trying to be brave, even as tears continued to fall from his eyes.
John smiled, looking at him briefly before turning his attention back at the handcuffs ‘‘I’m sorry I didn’t come sooner’’ He said, leaning down to press his lips against Sherlock’s shoulder.
John smiled, kissing Sherlock again, and thankfully the conversation changed into less dangerous topics. Dinner ended as it normally does, with everyone groaning and wondering why they ate so much. Sherlock was still struggling with  desert when their guests parted and John came down the stairs with their gifts to Mrs. Hudson – a perfume and a couple of jewelry. She gave them jumpers, which they put on before going to their own living room.
Sherlock took a shuddering breath, biting his lip to keep his emotions from showing. He remembered John being kidnapped by Shawn, by Moriarty. He remembered purposely scaring him at Baskerville’s and actually dying in front of him.
‘‘Aren’t you a little old to be called upon?’’
‘‘Alright’’ He took a deep breath, ‘‘How about I-’’ another deep breath, ‘‘Alright’’
Day 3: Family Gatherings // 12 Days of ficmas 2016
Sherlock hummed, and his face turned a little red, ‘‘What if I want to try it, at least once?’’
He stared at John with frightened eyes ‘‘You care… for me?’’ Sherlock’s voice broke as he brought his knees up to his chest.
Sherlock looked a bit sheepish, ‘‘It was a good plan’’
Harry scoffed, ‘‘Shut up, dork’’
‘‘What’’
John was silent for 7 full seconds, processing Sherlock’s words, before he said ‘‘Sherlock, A.G.R.A is in prison’’
Sherlock snorted and walked away. It was only when he reached the street that he realized that John was stuck in a conversation with the DI. Panic rose to his throat like acid when both man turned to look at Sherlock, and he turned around to try and calm himself, repeating his mantra. After a few minutes (which felt like hours to Sherlock) John finally made his presence known by touching Sherlock’s lower back and murmuring ‘‘Shall we?’’.
It’s not like Sherlock could do anything that was unforgivable to John, anyway. He traced his fingertips on Sherlock’s face. He hoped this newfound freedom to touch each other wasn’t just a product of his grief, stuck within this time bubble. He liked touching Sherlock, and it seemed that Sherlock liked to be touched. He smiled, ‘‘Okay’’
He held Sherlock by the hair with one hand and his prick with the other, just grazing it around Sherlock’s lips, which he opened and closed, trying to kiss it, to suck it inside.
, he tried to say,
‘‘Can I warm you up? Will you let me?’’ John moved closer still, and now his knees had hit the mattress,
They had slept so much that they skipped breakfast and went straight into lunch, with Harry casting looks at them every other minute. John raised an eyebrow at her, and she sighed ‘‘As you know I had a little party planned for today. However I can cancel it and-’’
‘‘Really, John, the experiment was hardly that drastic’’ Sherlock said, even though he kind off feared for his health every time he crossed the hallway from his room to the living room.
‘‘My John’’ he whispered, dripping with affection, so sweet it gave John a toothache.
’’ John frowned ‘‘
John shrugged, feigning indifference ‘‘Wasn’t the life that I wanted. Wasn’t the person I wanted to spend it with’’
‘‘Why did you say gay like that?’’
John bit his lip, looking at Sherlock’s clothes to see if anything jumped out. Nothing did, of course. The man looked impeccable. ‘‘You didn’t have lunch today’’
Sherlock smiled back. John had asked him to deduce everyone on the plane, unintentionally turning it into a challenge when his hand came in contact with Sherlock’s thigh and when he praised him after every deduction.
Sherlock took a deep breath and opened his eyes. John’s face was so close, so beautifully painted with happiness and affection that Sherlock just had to raise his lips again for John to kiss. But John must have seen something troubling behind Sherlock’s façade, because he backed away to sit on the bed.
Sherlock smiled, biting his lip, moving faster, more desperate. ‘‘John’’, he sobbed.
He spoke so quietly that he was surprised when John didn’t ask him to repeat himself. He had his back turned, so he felt rather than saw John getting closer. His heart raced, his hands shook and he released a trembling breath when John’s fingers brushed the hair on his nape.
Sherlock grunted, displeased, ‘‘I’ll do it’’ he said, but didn’t proceed to do it. They kissed for rather a long time after that, actually. ‘‘Jooohn’’ he eventually wined, probably upset that John’s clothes weren’t removed by sheer mental force alone.
‘‘We’ve established that you’re a genius now, John. Do keep up’’ Sherlock smiled.
John raised his eyebrows, looking at Lestrade for permission before knelling down beside the girl. ‘‘No obvious signs of trauma’’ He looked at a forensics person lurking nearby and extended his hand, silently asking for a glove, ‘‘Ta, mate’’. He felt for lumps around her neck and arms, ‘‘I would guess’’ he glanced at Sherlock, ‘‘that she wasn’t killed here. She was asphyxiated somewhere else’’
‘‘Given the fact that that’s the only thing physically wrong with him, I think he was poisoned with heavy metal, probably gold’’ John said as he rummaged through one of the drawers to get a syringe and a tourniquet.
‘‘You sex him up, Sherlock! You sex him up’’ She yelled and John ran before Sherlock could respond in any way.
Sherlock left with a last kiss to John’s lips, which tuned into a second, longer kiss. Which turned into a third even longer kiss, which-
John chuckled and his lips ghosted upon Sherlock’s before finally, and gently, making contact. John gave him chaste kisses for a couple of minutes, sometimes stopping to call him beautiful or amazing, before he replaced his lips with a thumb, which caressed Sherlock’s bottom lip. Sherlock frowned and opened his eyes, silently saying
In the years of Sherlock and his acquaintance John had never seen it, and a treacherous part of his brain supplied that it could be a last message, just for him - maybe even a small piece of paper saying ‘I’m coming back’. The box was shallow yet wide, the kind of box where a fancy shirt would be sold in. He sat on the bed, anxious, and slowly opened it.
Sherlock clenched his jaw and brought his hands up to place his fingers against his temples. ‘‘But the six Thatchers… The aquarium… Mary… she…’’
‘‘Why?’’ Sherlock came closer, his lips dangerously close to John’s ear, ‘‘Are you going to punish me?’’
Sherlock’s blush deepened ‘‘Yes’’ and John’s mouth hang open, bemused, as Sherlock pushed him into lying on his back so he could straddle his hips. He placed both his hands on John’s chest, effectively keeping him in place as he rolled his hips against him. His whole body shook as he felt it again, the thrill that ran through him the night before at being the object of John’s desire.
Sherlock frowned, ‘‘As I’ve already said, yes’’
John wouldn’t (ever), because he would never hurt Sherlock like this, but he was impossibly aroused from the idea of it. He got up from the bed and started to remove his clothes, ‘‘You. Are.
‘‘Where is the body?’’ John asked Lestrade, and Sherlock bit his lip and continued walking around the victim’s bedroom as the DI explained that it was, in fact, just a robbery and so the presence of a doctor was hardly needed.
John nodded, and both of them were smiling ridiculously wide. He felt so relieved that he could fall asleep right then and there, ‘‘I’m falling asleep right here and now’’
John felt like it went on for ages. Eventually Sherlock subsided, content to only stroke John’s hair and press his lips on his forehead, over and over again. John’s sobbing became sniffing. And then it became nothing. They held each other like they were frightened a false move would make the other pull away. John’s growling stomach was what forced them apart.
Sherlock blinked a few times, staying quiet for over half a minute, as if re-reading every BDSM article in his mind. ‘‘Will you...’’ his voice sounded small, timid, ‘‘Kiss me?’’
-He didn’t win.
‘‘I haven’t even kissed you yet’’ John said, mostly to himself. Sherlock stopped breathing for a moment, but didn’t lower his hands.
Sherlock pushed him against the sink, unbuttoning his shirt ‘‘People always arrive late at a party’’ he murmured, moving on to open John’s flies.
Time stood still.
John shook his head, his face falling at the mention of James’ name, but he wouldn’t be distracted, ‘‘Why don’t you like her?’’
Conclusion: The baby wasn’t John’s.
John pictured Sherlock’s beautiful face.
He moved to take a sip from his tea, but Sherlock gently stilled his hand. ‘‘It’s hot, John’’ He moved closer, ‘‘Here’’ and blew on the rim, between their fingers.
‘‘Right’’ John sighed, relishing on the freezing cold air of the night. His body was so warm he felt like he would melt. ‘‘I’m going to melt’’ he said, a bit concerned, but Harry just scoffed.
‘‘Please’’ Sherlock sounded distraught, now. He came behind John to caress his hands, pleading with then. Pleading with him. He bent over and touched his cold nose to John’s neck, ‘‘Please come home with me’’
‘‘Oh, really?’’
‘‘Stop’’ he said, placing is index finger on Sherlock’s forehead, as if it were his off switch.
John looked at him for a moment before deciding he was satisfied and starting the car again.
The cab ride was quiet, just the way John hated. He wasn’t one to dwell on thoughts and feelings, particularly shame. Rationally, he knew that he had nothing to be ashamed off. He couldn’t, however, help but feel like he revealed too much. Sherlock knowing bondage positions and BDSM practises was one thing. He was a detective, curious about most things unusual, things that could help him solve cases. John knowing BDSM, however, was a completely different matter.
John chuckled ‘‘Oh, you wouldn’t mind?’’
John chuckled, sleepy and still caressing Sherlock’s head ‘‘Want me to kiss it better?’’
Thank you so much for reading it. This community is the kindest I've ever come across, so thank you so much!
‘‘I thought you said it was for John’’ Lestrade had a hint of a mocking smile in his face, which was probably what prompted Sherlock’s honest response.
‘‘Not at all’’ he whispered, but he might as well have said ‘please’, and welcomed John’s lips on his with a whimper.
‘‘What, going clubbing?’’ John frowned ‘‘Love, I want to take you dancing at least
Sherlock swallowed visibly, and had the grace to look a bit sheepish and apologetic. There was a knock on the front door, which Mrs. Hudson answered, but John’s eyes never left Sherlock’s.
‘‘No’’
Eventually Harry and Alice went to their room, and only Sherlock and John remained at the living room. They sat cross-legged, facing each other, in front of the fire place, holding hands and kissing. John had playfully wrapped them in fairy lights and placed a Santa hat on Sherlock’s head. The doctor, as it turned out, was very skilled with his tongue, and Sherlock had to move away to catch his breath before he passed out. John, not at all deterred, just moved his lips to Sherlock’s neck.
''John. That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard''
‘‘Sherlock’’ John breathed, pulling away, which was unacceptable.
John smiled at him, before he jerked himself upward, caressing Sherlock’s arse cheek, ‘‘Did I hurt you, baby?’’
Sherlock's eyes met his, a bit embarrassed, and said softly, ‘‘Lube?’’
John nodded. He knew that, rationally. But it was comforting to hear it from someone else. He brought his hand to trace Sherlock’s cheekbone, and the detective sighed, closing his eyes.
His chest felt heavy as he bit his lip before saying:
Sherlock nodded, and he looked surprised at John’s deduction ‘‘Ever since that, Mycroft reminds me of Redbeard whenever I’m displaying any sort of emotion towards someone. A way of saying ‘Be careful, this will hurt you’. He said it to me at when Uncle Rudy fell ill, at your wedding…’’
He wasn’t wrong.
John frowned as he drank, raising his eyes to Mycroft’s before averting them again.
The evening went by quickly, and soon they were retiring to their bedroom, which was composed of two beds separated by a small nightstand.
John sat beside him, stroking Sherlock’s hair and watching the room. The last time that Sherlock got this drunk was at John’s stag night, when they were suffering from the words unsaid. It seemed like so long ago, the time of their life when different people were pulling the strings of their fate: Mycroft on one hand, Moriarty and Mary on the other. He remembered bringing Sherlock back to Baker Street, both drunk out of their minds, and carefully flirting with him, trying to see where he stood with his feeling for John.
There were three seconds of silence, after which hell broke loose. Men rushed in from both doors and the top windows, screaming at them incomprehensible things. John pulled Sherlock down to the ground, lying on top of him.
‘‘You have an answer for everything, don’t you?’’
‘‘I’m not- It’s not for me. John likes being in the action too’’
‘‘What did Harry do?’’ John asked as soon as they were alone. Sherlock sighed.
-You’re my…
John had already arrived when Sherlock went downstairs. He was leaning against the counter, arms crossed over his favorite Christmas jumper, and his face erupted in a smile when their eyes met.
‘‘You’ll never guess who is coming to dine with us’’ She said as they proceeded with their chores (Sherlock was peeling potatoes and John was cutting onions). They looked at her with questioning eyes, and she smiled ‘‘Eric, Nathan and Maggie’’. They both frowned, looking at each other, and Mrs. Hudson sighed ‘‘Mrs. Turner and her married ones’’
He closed the door and leaned against it, mumbling a ‘goodbye’ before hanging up. He didn’t want to think about what all of the meant. He couldn’t. The reasoning that he had come to – under Ella’s supervision – was that Sherlock killed himself after Moriarty destroyed his image. The premise was that John wasn’t that important, and so jumping in front of him wasn’t a big sacrifice. Needless to say the grieving process wasn’t as healthy as it could have been.
Sherlock moaned, biting his lower lip and frowning, ‘‘You really do’’ he said, sounding awed.
Mycroft’s face did something that John could only describe as a ‘Bitch, please’. ‘‘Doctor, I’m leaving for a job at Eastern Europe for two months, maybe three’’ he lowered his cup and got up ‘‘I have to ask you not to leave Baker Street until then. I want to be here to supervise you… moving on, as it were’’
‘‘Right. He did tell me that he quit, something about it not being stimulating enough’’ Lestrade emended, not really paying attention to anything (not even the papers which he was signing) so he missed Sherlock’s confused expression.
‘‘Sherlock, you had a relapse. I’m not going to stop caring for you because of it’’
John did, nodding and starting to smile, ‘‘Okay’’
‘‘No, love’’ John tugged his hair one more time, reprimanding him ‘‘None of that’’
‘‘Do your job, then. Turn away the cameras, place security at our doorstep... I don’t know’’
He didn’t wait for a reply. John turned around and continued walking. He wanted to run, but he thought it would look ridiculous. It would feel pathetic. But he already was pathetic, so what was the point of pretending he wasn’t.
Sherlock looked taken a bit aback by his bluntness. Insecurity flourished on his face again. He cleared his throat, ‘‘You-’’
experience, very humbling’’
She openly smiled at that, reaching beside her to get a cigarette. She blew out the smoke as she said ‘‘I met Marry once, you know. Two years ago. When you were still dead’’
John was looking at him with so much love and desire that he ran over to him, crushing their bodies together and wrapping his arms around John’s neck.
‘‘Tickles’’ He whispered, complaining, turning his head to stop him, but John just started to lick his face instead. ‘‘Ugh, you’re like a dog’’
Harry laughed at that ‘‘Christ, no. I recognize an abusive relationship when I see one’’ Sherlock drank a sip of his water, never taking his eyes of her as she continued ‘‘Honestly, they say you marry replicas of your parents. It was scary seeing that kind of manipulation and not being able to do anything about it. It was our childhood all over again’’
…’’ John murmured.
‘‘Just’’ John sighed, closing his eyes and bumping his head on the seat, ‘‘Deduce away, would you? Get it over with so I can move on with my life’’
Mr. Fletcher was arrested by the DI at around 6 am, when there were only a couple of people cleaning the place, but John and Sherlock stayed away from all the commotion, dancing to an absolute classic. ‘‘
Sherlock blinked a few times, looking at John up and down, before getting up from his chair and coming around the kitchen table to stand in front of him, ‘‘You called it off. The wedding, you... you called it off’’
John looked from Sherlock to his glass, ‘‘So you don’t like her?’’
Sherlock had walked into Baker Street with his big coat, a worn out backpack and a terrified expression. John had been seating on his chair, reading a crime novel. They stared at each other for about fifteen seconds before John got up, looked up and down at Sherlock’s fragile frame and left the room.
help with the case. You don’t understand the method enough to comprehend my reasons’’
‘‘Hello?’’ John voice shook and he sniffed. Only then did he realize that he was crying.
John sighed beside him, breaking Sherlock’s reverie. He could feel it, his love for John, crashing against him like a wave, making him curl his toes and bite his lip. Sherlock stared at him for a few seconds before he touched John’s hand with a tip of his finger, focusing on the velvety texture around his knuckles. When he realized that that wasn’t enough, he tried to, as carefully as he could, place himself between John’s arms, feeling his heart beat even faster as John started to wake up.
Sherlock barely had time to register that the man’s voice was vagally familiar before Moriarty was yelling again, shouting orders walking out of the room.
‘‘You
‘‘No, answer it. This person has been calling you all morning’’ John said, and Sherlock lifted his head to look at him.
Harry sighed, ‘‘Of course you don’t. This isn’t why you’ve come to me in desperation. Or why you’ve been avoiding your fiancée’’
Her frantic hands on his arms were the last think he felt before everything went dark.
Sherlock could feel the difference between this John and the one he had been seeing the weeks before. The water around Sherlock’s body felt like it always did, as did everything else that his senses were receiving. But as he looked at John he felt as if he’d been woken from a dream and his mind was slowly beginning to work again. It wasn’t perfect, and Sherlock didn’t trust himself or his memories, but it was enough for him to know that at least John’s touch was real.
Sherlock turned his head to the side, like a puppy, ‘‘You were jealous of Irene Adler’’
) and bra – which was light brow and doing its work splendidly.
Harry looked at John incredulously for a second. There she burst out laughing.
John thought taking a deep breath.
Sherlock froze, thinking for a moment, and then he drank. ‘‘You loved Sholto, but you weren’t sexually attracted to him. And sex is important to you’’
Sherlock backed away slightly to nod, solemnly, as if they were discussing battlefield strategies. ‘‘Three’’
John shrugged, ‘‘You were composing sad music for me’’
John took a second to remember who they were talking about. Oh, right. His fiancée. ‘‘That I don’t want to get married. I’ll tell her that... that I don’t love her’’
They walked for a few seconds before Harry tugged at his arm, ‘‘Go on, then. What will you say to her?’’
‘‘Lead the way’’ Sherlock rumbled, and John bit his lower lip as a thank you.
known for its Christmas parties. It was the event of the year for everyone who was involved with crime work – open bar, invitation only, middle aged men and women dancing like there was no tomorrow. For Sherlock, this has always meant 30 minutes of people ether ignoring him or calling him a freak before he decided to leave and spare himself the trouble.
‘‘I need your help’’ Sherlock said as a hello, and continued before any of them could say anything ‘‘On the 14th of December my boyfriend and I were at Regent’s Park. There were some children playing there, and one of your students asked us if we wanted to write ‘Letters to Santa’’’ Sherlock made the air quotes with his hands ‘‘We did, but I don’t know what my boyfriend wrote and I
He had walked out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist and the tags around his neck. Sherlock had been seating at the table, trying and failing to keep his eyes away from John’s chest. John had laughed, finding it amusing that Sherlock was excited with military things, and gave the detective the tags by putting them around his neck. John, at the time, had though that the interest was innocent, but reviewing the contents of the box maybe he was wrong. Maybe Sherlock had had a
‘‘Please’’ Sherlock raised his head, his eyes genuine, ‘‘Just the tip, please’’
John stopped breathing. Sherlock had taken the time to print at least a dozen of them – a specific number that must have been stipulated by the printing store. John held one of each dazzled. Sherlock had not only imagined them being together – which would have been more than enough to give John a heart attack – but had imagined them being
Sherlock pushed against John’s chest, rising to ride him. His chest was a bright pink, his hair on disarray falling on his eyes. He looked like a rent boy, biting his lip in pleasure.
‘‘In my room as well’’ John said just as quietly, breathing in deeply. And there it was, the tension, something strong forcing all of the air out of Sherlock’s lungs. He nervously ran his tongue on his lower lip, and John’s eyes followed the movement.
John’s expression turned very serious all of the sudden, his hands still on Sherlock’s hips, ‘‘and why would I be thinking about leaving?’’
’’ he sang, his voice perfectly low and husky, and Sherlock went weak in the knees.
Sherlock blinked some more, then nodded.
‘‘Oh look, a tunnel! I think I’m losing you’’ John mocked before ending the call.
The detective had hidden his face with his hands, and John was just about to apologize when Sherlock rushed over to him, engulfing John in a hug. ‘‘John, you didn’t need to… to push away the woman you love for-’’
Sherlock didn’t use what remained of his strength to push him away. Instead he took a deep breath, swallowing around his pain. ‘‘What’s the point… of having-’’
‘‘I’m no expert in human interaction, but I don’t think that that would be well received’’ Sherlock ran his fingers through John’s hair, marveling at its softness, until he noticed that John had fallen asleep. ‘‘Whatever was given to me…’’ Sherlock whispered, liking his lips before continuing ‘‘I think you’re the antidote’’
‘‘It’s fine, love. It’s okay’’ He kissed Sherlock again and leaned back to look at him more carefully. His lips, purple before John’s ministrations, had stopped trembling from the cold, but Sherlock was still shivering ‘‘Let’s get you home, into a hot bath then under the covers, yeah?’’
‘‘Yes. So right now, things are not going their way’’ Sherlock frowned and his whole body tensed ‘‘And if you had this much power and resources… what would you do next?’’
Harry eyed Sherlock for a while, then she raised her eyebrow at John and said ‘‘Yes, for seven years… give or take’’
‘‘Burning your heart out… proved to be harder than I thought. I told Mycroft to convince you not to tell John that you were alive. I placed Mary Watson in your lives to make sure that you were kept apart. I’ve drugged and manipulated you’’ Moriarty sighed ‘‘But I’ve come to realize, my dear, that sometimes, being literal is the best course of action’’ he clapped his hands and yelled ‘‘You can take him now’’
‘‘Sherlock?’’ John’s voice, with the softest and kindest tone which he has ever uttered, anchored Sherlock in his confusion. John was closer now, both hands on Sherlock’s face, a frown above his assessing eyes.
‘‘You have the temerity to patronise me about relationships when it’s you who’s traumatized and emotionally stunned’’
John hiccupped again. It might have been a sob.
John extended his hand, ‘‘Let me throw them away, then’’
John guided him out of their flat, and Sherlock welcomed the warm seat of John’s car without any questions, sighing in relief as John’s hand came to rest against his thigh. ‘‘Thank you, John’’ he said, not really sure what he was thankful for.
instructor?!’’ John repeated, feeling his brain faculties slowly cease to work because Sherlock was, in fact, a very good dancer.
‘‘Children, my phone is ringing. Stop this’’ She yelled, then to the phone her tone took an approachable edge ‘‘Hello, Harry Watson speaking’’ but her posture changed to a tired one, and she said with impatience ‘‘Hello, father’’ She looked at John ‘‘You want me to pick you up tomorrow at… yeah, fine. See you later then’’ She hung up and took a deep breath.
, Sherlock thought, and John’s frown deepened into concern.
John laughed, glad that Sherlock’s mannerisms translated into the bed, as well. ‘‘You look like you want to taste it’’
John though, biting his lip. His heart was hammering in his chest as he tried to come up with something to say. He eventually went with:
Sherlock swallowed visibly and shook his head.
‘‘Sherlock.
‘‘I- I prefer it if he’s happy’’
They kissed for some time – which in their minds was considered an eternity – until John’s back informed him that he was, in fact, in his late thirties. ‘‘Can I interest you in a horizontal surface?’’ He asked between kisses.
Sherlock nodded, unconsciously raising his chin asking for another one, and John seemed happy to oblige. He straightened up again to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
John felt nauseated, ‘‘Can’t’’
John took off her shoes and socks too, before diving in for another kiss. Sherlock, with the part of her brain which still seemed to be working, deduced quite brilliantly that John was only wearing her jeans (
The first thing Sherlock noticed when he came to was the sunlight. The second was that even with his headache, his mind was clearer and sharper. He opened his eyes to the moving green scenery outside his window, and he contemplated it for a moment before turning to look at the driver who was – according to Sherlock’s calculations – the most beautiful man in the world.
‘‘I know’’ John whispered. And he let himself stop pretending for a second, so he could look at Sherlock’s lips like he wanted to kiss him. He could look at his hair like he wanted to tug on it. At that neck like he wanted to bite it. ‘‘I know, beautiful’’
can also… make sweets’’ John frowned, strangely offended by a couple of candy canes. Sherlock looked at the army doctor, incredulous, before he was taken over by a laugh fit.
‘‘Sherlock Watson has a very nice ring to it’’ John said, making Sherlock laugh. He placed his head over John’s heart again, let out a deep sight and whispered:
John took a sip of Sherlock’s tea, clenched jaw and a frown on his features. Sherlock pondered what to do for a second, deciding to kiss the tip of his nose quickly, trying to convey something akin to support. John was startled for a moment, but he soon let out a chuckle, pressing his lips to Sherlock’s.
‘‘I’d like you to leave’’ John said, his voice quiet but undeniably dominant. Robert was looking at him with a curious expression before he got up.
‘‘Jesus’’ John whispered, shaking his head ‘‘Why go through all that trouble? What could they possibly gain from that?’’
‘‘Sherlock’’ John mocked, smiling. He realised the cigarette was still in his hand and put it out on a wall, before throwing it in the garbage. Save the planet, and all that. ‘‘Did you know I went vegan?’’
This one, incidentally, is a girl. She looks, from what is visible of her face, not even twenty. The killer had placed her kneeling, sitting on her bare feet, chest to her thighs and forehead to the floor. White shirt and blue jeans impeccable. Blond hair tied neatly in a bun. She couldn’t have been dead for more than a day.
Sherlock gripped John’s hand, slightly amazed that he was allowed to do so. ‘‘That’s not your job’’
‘‘Why not?’’
John took a deep breath ‘‘Will you-’’
The metaphor was quite obvious. It went beyond abusive spouses and unbreakable marriages. Sherlock made the connection to him and his own horrible life, but John finds that to be very unfair to Ed Shewan, the dog slayer.
him. He wasn’t the weirdo who didn’t have friends or has never been in a date. John Watson, the most handsome, sexiest, bravest, kindest man in the world had chosen
Sherlock snorted with what little strength he had ‘‘Me too’’
‘‘Asphyxiated?’’ Sherlock knelt beside John, as if trying to see what he was seeing, ‘‘There are no strangulation marks on her neck, doctor’’
Sherlock hailed a cab, his grip on John even harder, somehow. ‘‘No. Not enough data. Not enough... enough experience to reach a conclusion’’
‘‘John, you don’t understand what you’re saying, okay? You… you… are going to remember the things that I’ve done to you and-’’
exactly
‘‘Yes, love’’ John frowned, looking at that beautifully hopeful face and wanting to punch himself, ‘‘I want everything. Everything that you want to give me. I want it. Whatever you want to do, we’ll do it. If you don’t want a... BDSM relationship, we don’t have to do it’’
, smiled cordially and extended his hand ‘‘Sherlock Holmes. It’s nice to meet you’’
Sherlock bit his lip and resumed his course to the bathroom, where he stayed until he heard John returning. Making sure he was presentable, he came back to the living room with what he hoped was a welcoming smile, but he must have missed it by a mile by the way John frowned.
‘‘I’ll be back shortly’’ He said as a goodbye, walking out of Baker Street with a plan.
‘‘I remember drinking and throwing up’’ Alice said, unaware of the inappropriate touching going on in front of her.
‘‘That his
‘‘There is a case, you said?’’ in a casual tone. He put on his coat and walked out with Sherlock, as the detective discreetly texted the DI for instructions.
‘‘I think that you need to do some soul searching before this weeding, John’’ Harry said, pulling away to look John in the eye. ‘‘This isn’t fair to you or Sherlock’’
John’s voice echoed loudly in Sherlock’s mind, making him unable to think rationally in his mind palace and, at the same time, a prisoner within its walls. He tried, nonetheless, to piece together all that had transpired in the last months. There had been cases, such as the one with the six Thatcher busts, in which Mary’s past came back to hunt her. People had died because of one word, a code word, and Sherlock’s arrogance caused the death of someone else. There had been a christening, several times when he helped baby sit… John’s soft and beautiful face as he played with Rosie.
Sherlock sat up straight on the tub at that, slashing water around and effectively wetting John’s trousers. ‘‘John, it’s my fault that your wife is dead. She gave her life for mine, jumped in front of a bullet. Why are you pretending that it never happened?’’
John set his jaw. Why was getting mocked by Sherlock somehow a hundred times worse than almost dying in the desert? He had to go for the kill. ‘‘This is how, while Irene Adler was manipulating you as easily as taking candy from a child, I saw right through her’’
John pulled the string of his dog tag and looked at it with a raised eyebrow. When he met Sherlock’s eyes, the detective was blushing. ‘‘I thought that it would be useful to have that-’’
John looked at the ceiling as his hands made patterns on Sherlock’s skin, his mind blissfully blank.
‘‘Sherlock there is… something that I’ve wanted to say… to you’’ He was whispering, as if afraid of his own words. Sherlock was afraid too, but he seemed to be unable to make any sort of deduction. Just like John Watson was the variable that Moriarty could never predict or control, he was also a conductor of light immune to Sherlock’s reasoning. ‘‘Well, there are two things’’ He cleared his throat and said a bit more confidently ‘‘Do you wanna go away, with me?’’
‘‘We met at work’’ John murmured to the room. An internal monologue questioning the necessity of all of this happed after that, and John’s resigned side won. He sighed before adding ‘‘She is a nurse. Her name is Mary… she’s funny, I suppose. And… clever. It makes sense moving in with her’’
And really, Sherlock should pay John compliments more often, because his answering grin was radiant, even if it didn’t last long. John parked in front of the Inn and Sherlock was just about to leave the car when John’s hand caught his.
And then, just like with Irene Adler and the phone, John had an epiphany.
‘‘I know how hard it is to forgive yourself sometimes. Especially when you feel like you’ve hurt someone you care about. But believe me, Sherlock, you have made me feel so happy. You’ve made my life worth living even on the dark days’’ He kissed Sherlock again and just stared at him for a while. When he became satisfied with what he saw, he went to bathroom to get ready for bed, and Sherlock just slumped backwards, thinking that he would get a sleepless night of overanalyzing and stressing about everything.
‘‘Have you figured out, then? Who the killer is? Is that where we’re going?’’
Their breathing synchronised, equated. Their heartbeats becoming one harmonious rhythm, and just as John was about to go under, he heard Sherlock’s soft voice.
‘‘Where were you, just now?’’ John asked, tugging lightly on Sherlock’s curls to calm him.
Sherlock looked down at both of them, their pants and trousers still forming a barrier, but even so he’d never felt so raw and exposed. He bent over to kiss John and inevitably pressed his hips harder against him, making them moan. They began to grind against each other, harder and faster, their breaths becoming shorter and their moans louder, until there came a knock on the door.
‘‘I-’’ he conjured Sherlock’s face again, ‘‘I like that he is gay and wants sex’’
Harry hummed, ‘‘Okay... what else?’’
‘‘This is rather forward of me, I realise’’ He said, his heart was hurting his chest from how fast it was beating, ‘‘But I was wondering if I could move in with you’’
‘‘Oh! Well done. You need to practice’’ Sherlock joked, backing away to look at John with a smug expression.
John drank, ‘‘Not that rare to catch the flu, this time of year’’
Sherlock removed himself from John’s arms, walking backwards slowly ‘‘Well yeah, but…’’ He placed a chair right in front of the stage ‘‘We can give it a slight twist on Christmas’’
Sherlock only looked up from his microscope when John set the bag on the floor. He frowned, ‘‘John, what-’’
They once intertwined their pinkies on the cab home, when they were high after the conclusion of a case and their cheeks hurt from so much laughter. The day that their most treasured internal joke was born: The Decently Sized Joke.
Sherlock played the video.
‘‘At the time, yes’’
She raised her eyebrow, ‘‘Go to Sherlock, then’’
As it turned out, though, that evening was destined to go as horribly as evenings could possibly go.
Sherlock grinned, shaking his head, and he pulled John down again so he could rest his head on his doctor’s chest. John wasn't convinced, but he let it slide. It was clear Sherlock liked a little pain. John made a mental note to keep lub in every part of the house.
‘‘John?’’ Sherlock said, an edge of apprehension in his voice. They were walking home hand in hand, and John tugged Sherlock’s a bit harder for reassurance.
‘‘Who we are’’ Sherlock swallowed, inhaling deeply ‘‘it matters. Even when people try to convince us that it doesn’t’’
John moved closer, standing just behind him and wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s abdomen. Sherlock looked at their reflection, felt John’s forehead against his shoulder blades, and wasn’t able to do anything about the tears escaping his eyes. ‘‘Can you make something like a safety image or message in your mind palace? Something that plays when you have these thoughts?’’ John said, and Sherlock ran his fingertips on John’s arm.
John inhaled, deeply, and looked at Sherlock’s worried expression before walking away from Ed Shewan’s (soon to be Taylor Mayden’s) house. He hoped he was going in the direction of Baker Street.
, John thought,
‘‘John’’ Sherlock called after him, not even having to run to catch up. Those damn legs. John hated them. They would look so pretty around John’s waist. Or over his shoulders.
‘‘No?’’ John laughed, shaking his head as well ‘‘Why don’t we get some food into you?’’
Sherlock, who started crying again, nodded. And John, beautiful, fantastic, brilliant, luminous John, made a point of caressing every inch of Sherlock’s face with her fingertips before trapping her bottom lip between her own. Their mouths softly danced around each other, curious tongues and breathy gasps setting the rhythm.
’’ Sherlock grabbed John’s arm, stopping him in the middle of the sidewalk. He forced John’s eyes to meet his by placing his gloved hands on John’s cheeks, holding him still.
‘‘I wanted to t-’’
Sherlock rolled his eyes, ‘‘I did, actually. You can’t guess, John. You need to observe. You came into contact with a patient with a severe case of influenza’’
‘‘What? Of course, he was. Implying that he was the result a childhood trauma that persists to define you would be terrible story telling’’ Mycroft shook his head, and Sherlock nodded, agreeing. ‘‘You’ve always… felt so much. Your heart was so pure and beautiful, always has been. I’ve never wanted it to be tainted with sorrow, and yet it was: Redbeard died. After that I helped you develop a thick shell, and reminding you of him was my way of remind you of how dangerous feelings were’’
‘‘Sherlock’’ He said, going for a joking tone.
my uniform?’’
John widened his eyes, and when Sherlock climbed the stage John scrambled to sit on his chair murmuring ‘‘Oh sweet baby Jesus’’ as a mantra.
Sherlock waited a beat before saying, quietly ‘‘If you are worried about me hurting him…’’ he stopped. Harry raised an eyebrow, the ghost of a smirk on her lips ‘‘I am trying… not to do that’’
After her last overdose, Sherlock found the need to master her emotions without the use of drugs. She did so compartmentalizing her feelings to such an extent that she almost saw them as numbers, or chemical equations. Between the years 2007 and 2010 Sherlock knew boredom and emptiness, so much so that she often wondered what the point was. The cases that Detective Inspector Lestrade provided were a palliative distraction, something to keep her going.
Sherlock nodded, looking at the door with a frown ‘‘I don’t think I can get out of here’’ he whispered, only looking back at his brother when Mycroft took his hand.
‘‘Will you m-’’
‘‘Nonsense, there must be something you want. A novel, maybe?’’
‘‘I’m not drinking to that’’
idea the stage I found Sherlock in?’’ John yelled, finally putting out his gun, even if just to keep it by his side.
’’ Sherlock sang, and John seemed awestruck looking at his boyfriend’s hips.
John sighed, uncomfortably aware of how much this situation was affecting him, ‘‘I can’t subjugate you’’
-Who knew that you would be such a sap? – John pulled Sherlock in for another kiss – A sap that is wearing too many clothes, I might add.
‘‘Sherlock Holmes, you listen to me: (1) I honestly think that I get dates because of a made up obligation, so I was not broken hearted that you drove them away. In fact, I was relived. And (2) I didn’t stay because of the cases’’ He paused to caress the shells of Sherlock’s ears and smiled as he finished ‘‘I stayed because of you’’
John’s face softened. He ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and pressed his lips to Sherlock forehead. ‘‘I know you are scared. I’m scared too. But you will not face this alone anymore’’ He kissed Sherlock softly, gently, reassuringly. ‘‘Is that okay?’’
Sherlock nodded, lying down on John’s chest again, placing a kiss to his chest and sighing contently.
He was at the park where they had played earlier that day, sitting on a bench next to some fairy lights, hugging his knees for warmth and (thankfully) wearing John’s jumper, scarf and hat. Too sore-throated too yell, John ran to him. Sherlock, seemingly lost in his world, only noticed John when he was helping him into his Belstaff.
John’s laugh was more an exhale, his smile turning mischievous, ‘‘I think we’ll just have to be touching each other all the time to be whole, then’’ he shook his head, ‘‘What a bummer’’
Sherlock Holmes was lying on the middle of the bed, hands braced on his chest. The blue shades were drawn, making Sherlock look ethereal. An angel.
John opened his eyes, ‘‘Don’t what?’’
‘‘Sherlock didn’t tell me exactly what father said, but you can imagine’’ to which Harry nodded. There was a beat of silence before John continued ‘‘I still haven’t talked about this with Sherlock, but I think we should go back to London. Spend Christmas there’’. The
‘‘I envy you’’
Sherlock widened his eyes, but shook his head, ‘‘No’’ he sighed. There was a pause, a soft inhale, and ‘‘I’m sorry I said that you liked her because she was dangerous. I’m sorry for implying that it was you fault. I didn’t mean it. I had to give her ammunition otherwise she-’’
-Nhg – Which, in Sherlock language, meant yes.
‘‘Oh,
- get into me’’ Sherlock murmured to John’s ear and another hiccup erupted. It was John’s time to widen his eyes, and he bit his lip to keep from laughing at the innuendo.
Day 4: Fairy Lights // 12 days of ficmas 2016
(See the end of the chapter for
When he was in the army, this meant jumping in land mines to try and rescue his comrades, pulling out bullets and cutting off limbs before sadness and compassion could freeze him.
, Sherlock thought, strangely resigned.
‘‘Yeah?’’ John murmured, still a bit groggy.
‘‘Oh!’’ Sherlock exclaimed clapping his hands, interrupting the conversation John and Mrs. Hudson were having, before running up to their flat to change his clothes.
Sherlock shivered. He took John’s wrists to push him away, inverting their positions, with John sitting on the bed and Sherlock standing up. He removed his clothes slowly, mostly because his fingers were shaking, and he closed his eyes while removing his pants. John made no sound for a few seconds and eventually Sherlock’s curiosity got the better of him.
The Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers were known to be legends among the military community, hence why being one of them literally opened doors. Sherlock had asked John why, once, and the doctor told him tales of their feats, but never the one truly responsible for their fame. Moreover, between all the seven fusiliers who composed the Fifth, John was the only one who knew the whole story – being the only one who survived Kandahar unharmed. Not even the official file – given to Sherlock by Mycroft -  had all the information.
Sherlock looked at John again, but his smile wasn't surprised. It was more apologetic, sweet. Filled with compassion. It was answer enough. He lied on John's chest again.
Sherlock frowned, his eyes glistening, ‘‘No, you didn’t. Mary’s enemies did. And they would have done so had you delivered her to Mycroft or not. If they found her there, they would have found her in your house’’
Sherlock sobbed and bit her lip.
Sherlock seemed to bask under the endearment, but only a little. ‘‘I need to show you something’’
He raised Sherlock’s legs, because he had a feeling that if he licked at his hole it would make Sherlock beg for him.
‘‘No’’
John smiled and side eyed Sherlock before raising his chin ‘‘No, I don’t believe you have’’
It was his turn, he realized. He thought of how Sherlock had been so kind and helpful since he came back. John felt a discomfort that he would never admit to. He tried to smile, ‘‘You like Mary’’
John nodded, running his thumb over Sherlock’s cheekbone bone directing his attention back to his father ‘‘You think that you want what’s best for me or that you love me… but it’s not true. You love an idea of a family that never existed. You loved the healthy and happy wife, your two heterosexual and intelligent children. And in your love for this idea you despised your family’’ John frowned, taking in a deep breath before continuing ‘‘You can’t accept my happiness now, because you’ve never cared for it’’
John shrugged, trying to ease his discomfort
John took a moment to just look. Then she touched. Then she straddled Sherlock’s lap and continued to kiss her silly.
, guys. We
‘‘Why is half you face completely bruised?’’
Sherlock heard footsteps outside the door and was just about to grab something to protect himself with when a sudden dizziness hit him, forcing him to sit on the bed and place his head between his knees. The door opened and closed, the footsteps got closer still. Sherlock eyed the men’s shoes, trying to gain some control.
now’’ and John just laughed harder.
The detective opened his eyes, and the fear and confusion in them were slowly replaced by relief and softness. ‘‘Hi’’ he said, his voice small.
John closed his eyes, running his palms against his face and counting to ten before he put on his coat and boots. He took out his phone and tried to call Sherlock, but the detective’s mobile had been turned off. ‘‘If he comes back, tell him to call me’’ John said to Harry.
John’s cheeks hurt from smiling, ‘‘You are ridiculous’’
‘‘Please, don’t. I’m… I’m fine’’ Sherlock said, looking at John with a smile ‘‘John… made me feel better’’
‘‘John?’’ Sherlock’s voice was small, as if woken out of a reverie. John just pressed both palms against his face, running his thumbs on those ridiculous cheekbones, smashing their lips together over and over again.
It wasn’t very sexy, because Sherlock kept having to stop when he was taken over by fits of laughter, but John and the cleaning staff were really supportive, often offering their applause and yelling their approval. When they were going back to Baker Street, John held his hand and couldn’t seem to stop smiling. He looked at ease, completely and irrevocably happy, and Sherlock decided that this was a very good Christmas tradition.
‘‘Sherlock, don’t move’’ John said with wide eyes aimed at Sherlock’s hair. The detective was suddenly on edge.
‘‘What else?’’
(3) Sherlock was the reason John got fired from the clinic.
‘‘He-’’ John sighed, sitting down on the chair beside Harry, ‘‘It was a misunderstanding’’
’’ He took Sherlock’s hand in his, bringing it to his lips ‘‘You have every right to take some time away for yourself. To rationalize the things that are said and done to you in your own way. I could never be upset for that’’
‘‘I haven’t asked you yet’’ He protested, and Sherlock backed away slightly so that he could.
John laughed, placing his hands on Sherlock’s hips and giving him a last kiss on his neck before turning him around and leading him to the kitchen table.
Sherlock looked at John again, and suddenly the gravity of everything that happened on the course of all those years dawned on Sherlock. ‘‘John’’ he whispered as his vision blurred.
John’s heart softened. His whole body did, in fact. It was such a Sherlock thing to do, to try to understand John’s feelings by equating them to his experiences. Trying to be fair, in his own way. John wanted to tell him that it wasn’t necessary, but the words got stuck in his throat. For his vulnerability to be viewed as a gift and not a weakness, for his tears to be cherished. He’d never felt this kind of affection. He wanted to show Sherlock the same respect.
John smiled at him before kissing his cheek just as Eric hummed into his whine glass ‘‘To which war were you assigned?’’
And Jesus fucking Christ if John didn’t almost bite his fist to keep from coming. He squeezed his dick at the base and bent down to lick at Sherlock’s hole, getting it wet and loose and ready.
‘‘But I love you so much’’ John whispered back, raising his chin to press his mouth against Sherlock’s. He pulled back with a frown, ‘‘But! You look very silly in my clothes, William. We’re gonna have to break up’’ he said, which made Sherlock giggle and hide his face on John’s neck, who involved him in a tight hug, rocking him from side to side.
‘‘Sherlock… hm… we should talk’’ John said, making Sherlock’s heart race ‘‘Now, I’ve noticed that lately-’’
Sherlock’s jaw clenched, and he opened his mouth just enough to fit the rim of the glass. He shrugged, ‘‘You were angry at Irene Adler’’
‘‘I can’t stay for long of course, there are pressing matters at hand at the office. What with another referendum concerning the European Union and the Greek situation my hands are tied’’ John gave him his tea as he sat on the couch beside Mycroft, who smiled as he brought the cup to his lips. Something changed in the man’s features, so subtly yet so clearly to John that he momentarily thought that he had accidentally put salt instead of sugar in the tea. Mycroft continued ‘‘I hadn’t seen such crisis since the Italian austerity. However, it is always nice to visit the Vatican’’
‘‘The famous Mr. Holmes’’ He said, running his hand down Sherlock’s arm, a flirtatious smile on his face. Sherlock felt bile going up his throat, remembering the last time that a psychopath had been interested in him, and took a step back.
‘‘I know, right. Shocking. Who could have seen this coming?’’
‘‘I’m sure we have leftovers’’ Sherlock said, calmly. John turned to look at him with raised eyebrows.
Sherlock nodded, and he rubbed his chest absently, like it was hurting too. He looked down at the bouquet.
John sat up, looking over at Sherlock, ‘‘How do you know that?’’
‘‘John, I just remembered that I have an appointment’’ Sherlock almost screeched, finally turning around with an expression that he hoped didn’t convey the fear that he was feeling. He rushed to the door and grabbed his coat and scarf ‘‘Can we do this when I get back?’’ and he left the flat before John (who at this point just sat there, bemused) could say anything.
Sherlock laughed at John’s improvised mask and yelled ‘‘It’s not
John (
Sherlock walked around aimlessly for almost thirty minutes before he decided to go to Scotland Yard. The DI welcomed him with a resigned sigh.
Finally, when he was thirty-nine, this meant walking into 221 B Baker Street with a suitcase in one hand and a bouquet of daisies and sunflowers in the other.
John sighed. Then he swallowed. Then he inhaled deeply, keeping that retched smell trapped in his lungs, as if he were taking the dumpster with him. He didn’t look at Sherlock, but he let himself be guided.
, and John complied by running his tongue on Sherlock’s bottom lip.
He couldn’t trust his voice. Or his hands, for that matter. He placed the teacup not too carefully on the tray again and caught Sherlock’s chin in one hand, brushing his thumb across those lips. ‘‘You worry about me, beautiful?’’
. I have… no idea what you are talking about’’
‘‘She’ll talk me out of it if I do it to her face’’
‘‘Yes,
‘‘You flatter me’’ He shook his head, smiling ‘‘But seriously, love, we kissed for the first time half an hour ago. There is no pressure for us to do this right now. Or at all, really’’
‘‘I know something else that you can –
‘‘That’s all I was to you?’’ John moved his elbows to his knees, coming closer, ‘‘Someone who fed you?’’
‘‘Yes, you have. You are perfect. And this isn’t a scene, anyway. We aren’t playing. This is just you and me’’
It was already happening. His need to have Sherlock overwriting every last ounce of rationality from his mind. Sherlock was really smart to do this kneeling down, John thought. No way John could resist him.
Suddenly Sherlock was grabbed by three pairs of arms and carried out of the room. It seemed that only his room had been decorated so extensively decorated. The rest of the house was still in bricks and concrete, light bulbs hanging from the ceiling and rooms without windows of doors. They soon reached a larger place that could be adapted into a ballroom. In its center, there was a pile of stumps of wood.
‘‘Can you go to my room, beautiful? Can you lie on my bed and wait there for me?’’
They still pursued the case though, Sherlock not being able to stop smiling even as he confronted the killer – the pianist,
John didn’t think they could, but he didn’t say anything. What was Sherlock trying to convince him of, exactly? That he could pretend to be his submissive to solve the case? What the hell was even going on? ‘‘I think maybe you’re confusing affection with trust’’, he said, because as much as Sherlock claimed to like him, it still couldn’t be classified as the same as what John felt for him. Someone else held that spot.
Ed could have said that most of the money was his. He could have said that he just wanted a shred of dignity. Ed said nothing.
‘‘I should have done the autopsy an hour ago’’ she grumbled, lowering the sheet that covered the body ‘‘Mathew Rodrigues. Age 27. He was studying to be a-’’
-Nhg.
‘‘We kissed for the first time 24 hours ago’’
‘‘Then leave, asshole’’
‘‘John. Irene Adler manipulated both of us into playing her game, and we did. I saved her from death and you were jealous of her. Until
John inhaled deeply, trying to control his erratic heart, ‘‘I won’t do it raw, baby’’ his voice was soft, despite everything.
, even though Sherlock didn’t say that aloud.
‘‘So you’ve hurt all those people to… turn me into who
’’ He cursed, drying his cheeks ‘‘Sherlock!’’
‘‘John, I think I just wanna go to sleep’’ Sherlock murmured, and John started to walk both of them backwards to the bed, not willing to let Sherlock go, and the detective just laughed harder. He slumped down, effectively stopping the hug, and John went to his knee to remove Sherlock’s shoes, socks and eventually trousers.
Sherlock nodded, looking at John ‘‘There is always two of us’’
They stared at each other for a few seconds, stunned, before Harry knocked louder. ‘‘We’re going!’’ John said, his voice a bit affected by what he’d been doing.
Sherlock moaned, a sound so beautiful it could create and destroy the universe. ‘‘You do?’’
‘‘Do you remember last night at all?’’ John asked Alice, sitting down beside Sherlock and placing a hand on his thigh. Sherlock dragged it upwards a bit, too close and too far away at the same time, making John gasp.
‘‘Don’t sleep. Lestrade will be calling shortly’’
. Sherlock’s heartbeat was loud against his ears as his hips came down harder and faster in desperate need of John, and John did nothing but provide, his own affection transparent in the way he moved. Sherlock only had time to think how this was even better than the first 7% solution he’d taken before everything erupted in hot bright pleasure.
Sherlock sat in front of him at the table, but they weren’t alone for long before John ran up the stairs, bringing the food, a plate and some cutlery.
This was going to be over embarrassingly fast.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at that and John frowned at his reaction.
‘‘I didn’t think you would come. I mean you… you-you said you didn’t…’’ Sherlock hugged his ribs, leaning against the counter and frowning. He was blinking hard, as if unsure of his own eyes.
‘‘You want to let him in?’’ John asked, bemused. Sherlock took one of his hands in his, enlacing their fingers, and kissed him quickly on the mouth before directing his attention at Robert.
‘‘Exactly! This is not the kind of disgust that you can fake. And he did have alibis, which is why he wasn’t convicted. But the whole public, and Lestrade himself, believe that he did it, and so he was shamed at every turn until he committed suicide in 2011’’
John woke up startled, reaching for a gun underneath his pillow that wasn’t there. It took him some time to remember where he was and what he was doing there. He glanced at Sherlock, who seemed to be in his mind palace, and wondered if the detective had eaten like he’d promised. One look around the room for used plates informed John that he hadn’t. Sighing, he took the phone and ordered them both some food.
‘‘John’’ he said, closing his eyes momentarily before continuing ‘‘It’s your father’’
‘‘I didn’t protect you’’ John whispered, finally meeting Sherlock’s eyes ‘‘I
‘‘Alright’’ He nodded ‘‘What’s the plan?’’
Sherlock blinked a few times, finally inhaling deeply and raising his chin further, ‘‘Yes’’
‘‘Oh, you know... Had to fight seven men to get those flowers for you’’
‘‘I could never hurt you, love’’ John said, finally holding Sherlock’s wrists, only aware of the term of endearment after he said it, when Sherlock’s eyes widened in disbelief. John raised one hand to run his fingers through Sherlock’s dirty hair, and decided that he needed a plan ‘‘How about we order some food, and while we wait for it we get you cleaned up?’’
‘‘I need experience’’ he said. Whispered, even. Possibly begged.
‘‘John’’, he said, and it was barely a word. It was an inhale. A hiccup.
Knowing that he had the detective’s full attention calmed John down a bit. If only a bit. ‘‘What are you doing?’’ John said, and he was surprised at how calm he sounded.
‘‘I’m really considering putting broken glass on the floor’’ John murmured. His eyes seemed unable to stay open.
Day 10: The Yard’s annual Christmas party // 12 days of ficmas 2016
Sherlock finally subsided, the smile gone from his face, ‘‘Okay’’, and his pupils blew a little wider.
‘‘Oh?’’ John walked over to him, ‘‘Perhaps I should try a version that doesn’t involve talking, then’’
‘‘Well, I’ll be alright’’ Sherlock closed his eyes again, grounding himself by John’s warmth ‘‘But most importantly, we are alright’’
‘‘How’s father?’’ John asked with an edge to his voice that Sherlock didn’t like hearing.
John wasn’t really hungry, but he forced himself to eat as much as he could. Sherlock seemed to be in a similar predicament. He looked cute as he frowned at the food, as if he were asking it what to do with his crying best friend. A laugh escaped John before he could stifle it.
They’d come for her in the middle of the night.
Sherlock laughed, a breathy exhale, and kissed John’s chest, ‘‘I feel the same’’
John bent over to retch inside a dumpster. He hadn’t eaten today, so nothing came out. Small blessings.
Sherlock’s bottom lip trembled and he watched, bewildered, as John pulled him towards Sherlock’s (their) bathroom. That room was also a toxic waste, but John made do, speed cleaning as Sherlock waited by the threshold. Once he was done, starting the water on the tub, he felt rather then heard his phone ringing, and he didn’t need to look at the screen to confirm that it was Mycroft. John took it out of his pocket and removed the battery, confiding his absolute attention on Sherlock.
‘‘Said what like what?’’
‘‘No, love. It’s just… your voice is… fuck, it makes me…’’ John murmured, and Sherlock suddenly understood.
‘‘Well, if it ain’t Johnny’’ Robert said, getting up from the couch with the help of a cane ‘‘It’s been seven years since I saw you. You had one of these as well’’ He raised his cane. John hugged him and gave him a few slaps on the back, but Robert’s attention was soon directed at Sherlock. ‘‘And you brought your… flatmate with you’’ he said with contemp.
John has always considered himself a brave man. Impulsive, at times, but nonetheless capable of making hard decisions under pressure – decisions which rarely kept him up at night, or filled him with regret. He didn’t mull things over, and he didn’t hold grudges against himself or others. What is done is done.
‘‘If it happens, you need to understand that it’s not about you. It can never
‘‘Sherlock?’’ John’s voice brought Sherlock out of his own mind, and he wondered how long it had been since he started examining the cases ‘‘Greg called me and said that I wouldn’t let you in the flat without a case? I have no idea where-’’
John hummed, diving forward to brush his lips against Sherlock’s, ‘‘Where is my heart, you little thief?’’ He pressed their mouths together more strongly, ‘‘Is it here?’’ and he licked inside of it, making the kiss as skilful as he could manage.
‘‘I’ll bring you a cameo pendent from Bulgaria, Doctor’’ Mycroft smiled stiffly and left, turning his back to a bewildered and hopeful John, who pulled out his wallet and the business card inside of it.
‘‘Good’’ John suppressed the ‘boy’ at the last second.
-Yes – John stretched the ‘e’, leaning forward to kiss Sherlock’s temple.
‘‘Christ’’ John said, out loud, moving to take a seat on his chair. Careful not to touch Sherlock’s vulnerable form. Confusion and arousal making it hard to breathe.
Sherlock moved his other hand to his own prick, arching his back and throwing his head back with a groan. I was the most erotic thing that John had ever seen in his life.
Robert hesitated for a rude amount of seconds before shaking it, his eyes accessing Sherlock in a way John did not like. ‘‘Well, Sherlock and I are going to get ready and then we will come down to help with dinner’’ John said, taking Sherlock by the hand to their bedroom, and Sherlock showered first.
‘‘He can’t even look at the pictures’’ John, beautiful, smart and perfect John said.
‘‘It ain’t daddy if he doesn’t reek of scotch’’ Harry grumbled only to John’s ears as she welcomed them into the house, then said louder ‘‘Why are you two so wet? Jesus’’ which brought Robert’s attention to them
John sat back on his chair, watching him, releasing him. ‘‘You want to know what it is like to submit to a person, so you can understand what the victims felt?’’
- wait, what do you mean ‘saved her’?’’
‘‘Yep’’, kiss, ‘‘Very much’’, kiss, ‘‘Possibly too much’’, kiss, ‘‘You could annihilate me, Sherlock Holmes’’
‘‘That was a bit forward of you. I haven’t even said yes yet’’ Sherlock said against his lips, and John laughed.
And it was good, really. All good. Perfect, in fact.
‘‘Who is he?’’ Sherlock asked, raising from his chair and holding John’s wrist, preventing him from aiming his gun at Mycroft.
‘‘So, you think that Mycroft wants to turn me into an ‘emotionless sociopath’?’’ Sherlock made the quotes with his hands.
John sat down again, caressing Sherlock’s thigh gently as he raised his chin to press their lips together, easing the tension in Sherlock’s chest until he forgot Robert had even been there. John erased all the negativity from their lives with a simple touch of lips, loving Sherlock despite what felt like all the forces that had always kept them apart. It was at that moment, at their post-apocalyptic kitchen, that Sherlock truly believed that he was going to spent the rest of his life with the man he loved. He’d resigned himself to the fact that it could never happen for so long, that there would always be something between them, that even as he deduced that John was about to ask him to marry him he didn’t truly believe it. But now…
It had been a cold and uneventful morning at 221b when John Watson came back home. The climax with Moriarty and the woman they knew as Mary Morstan left scars in their wake, simultaneously bringing Sherlock and John closer together and leaving a palpable tension between them.
John took out one by one with a smile on his face. ‘‘So fancy’’ he said wiggling his eyebrows and kissed Sherlock’s lips ‘‘Thank you, love’’
John laughed, ‘‘I have to admit: no one has ever had that reaction upon seeing me naked. It’s doing wonders for my ego’’
They had breakfast quickly before going out, walking around Edinburgh and trying to find a park to play in, which they eventually did. The snow wasn’t fluffy enough to build a snowman with, but they did make sure the other one was properly wet and dangerously close to hypothermia before they decided to call it a day, lights of twilight already filling the sky.

Sherlock drank, ‘‘You had a relationship with James Sholto’’
John turned on the lamb on their nightstand and sat cross-legged on the bed with a frown ‘‘Sherlock Holmes, you listen to me. My stress tonight was caused mostly because I put you in his path in the first place. I know what he’s capable of and I didn’t protect you. You are in no way responsible for anything.
Sherlock groaned as James Moriarty sat beside him, placing his hand on Sherlock’s lower back.
the love of his life had asked. The answer, of course, is that while it doesn’t excuse his actions, Sherlock is fundamentally a bad person. He has always believed that, and yet John showered him in praises he didn’t deserve, an affection he’s always desperately craved, but shouldn’t receive.
‘‘No’’ Sherlock rushed to say, interrupting him. He played with the hem of his shirt for a bit before whispering ‘‘Please, don’t leave me’’
Sherlock looked down, guilt rising up his throat like acid. He took another sip, working up some courage ‘‘Do you… see that kind of dynamic… with us?’’ he whispered.
John drank again, and raised his eyebrows, ‘‘That’s amazing’’ he laughed, shaking his head at himself at being impressed, even after all this time, ‘‘How did you know?’’
‘‘John’’ he whispered, and said army doctor turned to look at him a bit startled.
This time Sherlock had a good reason (or he thought he did), for Lestrade had called him with a case just 15 minutes after John left with what’s-her-name.
Sherlock watched John removing the yellow overall though the storm glass in his door, and when he noticed that John’s head was facing his way, he turned around and went for his wardrobe.
‘‘John’’
‘‘You think relationships are beneath you’’
John’s expression turned serious, ‘‘I don’t know how to give it back’’
‘‘Your
-O nhg – Sherlock moaned. It wasn’t her finest or most articulate hour.
‘‘It’s fine. And he is only gonna have dinner here. What I’m worried about is Christmas day’’ She sighed ‘‘Don’t let him ruin our mood’’
Sherlock smirked, ‘‘You start’’
‘‘The problem is when people assume that you are, then’’
Sherlock shook his head, raising his eyebrows ‘‘Don’t know, but I do think that Baskerville holds at least some of the answers we need. But more to the point: you have frustrated their plans. I don’t think they wanted the memories to stop at you hating me. I think they wanted me to realize that you were not worth my affection in the first place… maybe making you behave out-of-character, somehow’’
Sherlock and John’s eyes met, and John’s face softened in a grin ‘‘Well thank you for giving us this opportunity. You will make sure he gets it?’’ He took the paper and pen while the little girl nodded vigorously. Sherlock took them to, looking down at the white parchment before swallowing.
So Sherlock proceeded to being kissed at multiple areas of her chest, and some of her neck. John eventually placed the tip of her finger on Sherlock’s bottom lip.
‘‘He loved Mary’’
John sighed, and even though Sherlock didn’t sound too inebriated, he said ‘‘Fine’’
John’s mouth opened and shut, and he suddenly wished he was sober. The alcohol was making it difficult to think, ‘‘I... I didn’t mean it in a derogatory way’’
The next 2 chapters will be in John's POV because Sherlock will become... an unreliable narrator, to put it mildly.
John looked at Mycroft, raising his eyebrows ‘‘How the hell did you hear that?’’ he asked, even though it lacked the conviction and anger it would have had two years ago. John’s motto now-a-days was ‘resignation’.
Eventually Sherlock just rested his head on John’s chest, listening to his heartbeat, while John lightly ran his fingertips on Sherlock’s scalp.
The cab ride home was silent. It was only when they were hanging their coats at Baker Street that John cleared his throat.
John moaned around and fucked him with his tongue until he couldn’t get enough. Until his jaw started to ache. ‘‘You taste like honey’’ he said, when he moved up to take a breath, making his fingers do all the work.
His suspicions were confirmed when Sherlock whimpered, ‘‘Will you fuck me, John?’’ He turned his head to look at him, his hair falling on his face, ‘‘Will you fuck me raw, just like I wanted you too?’’
Day 5: Snowman // 12 Days of Ficmas 2016
Looking at the coat hanger, John realized that Sherlock had left without his. He took the Belstaff and was assaulted by the freezing air of nighttime Edinburgh.
Sherlock smiled, biting his lip as he nodded in agreement. ‘‘It wasn’t you, I know that now. I know that you are real and… the John from my recent memories wasn’t. Not even my mind can conjure you and all your… traits’’
‘‘I had to ask Mrs. Hudson’’ He grumbled and John laughed, throwing his head back. Sherlock finally smiled, somewhat relived. Maybe John wasn’t going to leave after all. ‘‘And I was only trying to make you see that living here isn’t a
was implied.
. His relief was short lived, though, because as soon as Moriarty’s steps died out the shooting started. Sherlock was still not in total control of his body, so he couldn’t look around to see what was happening. He used all his strength to fall to his side, taking the chair with him, in the hopes of escaping the line of fire. Pain irrupted from his shoulder just as he heard someone screaming his name.
on him.
-What about here? – She pointed at somewhere else, received her moaned response and kissed the area at question – And here? – Another kiss – Here? – Yet another.
‘‘I was rubbish at the last game and now am 45% more inebriated then you’’
, he had said, immobilizing Moriarty with the bomb between them. But he could never be sure, and after his fake suicide he felt like he’d lost his chance forever. But John seemed… he seemed to care for him still, and Sherlock was determined to deserve that affection.
, John thought, idly, and focused more intently on the telly. The feeling of Sherlock’s eyes burning through his skin.
John looked up at him, smiling, and nibbled at his ear ‘‘Sherlock Holmes’’ he whispered, placing both hands on his face to look straight into his eyes ‘‘I have loved you for the past seven years wholeheartedly, irrevocably, selflessly. It’s the most beautiful I’ve ever felt, and for the most beautiful person I’ve ever met. If you’d do me this honor, I would be the happiest man aliv-’’
John groaned, pressing his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders to push him away.
There was a beat, and then Sherlock brushed his lips against John’s forehead before disentangling himself, He helped John up.
John’s heart squeezed tight. He wanted nothing more than to care for and spoil this beautiful man. ‘‘Would you like me to?’’
‘‘There are other ways to asphyxiate people. Especially if you don’t want to leave obvious marks. And especially if you are playing’’
fun’’
’’ he yelled, and John took a step back. Sherlock seemed to realize what he’d done, eyes widening and mouth hanging open as he wrapped his arms around John’s neck ‘‘I’m sorry’’ he whispered ‘‘I didn’t mean to snap like that, it’s just…’’
‘‘But I shouldn’t put my feelings over yours!’’ He untangled himself from John’s embrace to support himself on his elbow ‘‘I scared you so much, and for what? Just because a homophobe said homophobic things’’
‘‘Us’’
‘‘You are very… affectionate this morning’’ John chuckled as Sherlock placed a peck over each of his eyelids.
Harry’s face lit up, ‘‘But then who will be worshiping him?’’
‘‘We need to take him to the hospital, Dr. Watson’’ a young male nurse said, shifting from foot to foot, awkwardly.
‘‘She didn’t do anything. It was fine’’
wanted to have sex with me’’
Sherlock sighed, making a show out of complaining about it even though John knew he secretly enjoyed playing with snow. John brought his hands to Sherlock’s stomach and the last thing he saw were Sherlock’s frightened eyes before he began to tickle him.
nudity in the leaving room.
John turned him around matter-of-factly, putting him in all fours, and Sherlock yelped in surprise. John’s tongue resumed its ministrations.
It’d been quiet – dreadfully so – for over a month.
‘‘One!’’ They yelled at the same time and scrambled to disrobe John. Which proved more difficult than anticipated, with John nearly kicking Sherlock in the chin as he frantically tried to propel a sock off.
‘‘Let me guess, Mycroft somehow convinced you that feelings weren’t good?’’ John said with a harsh tone.
Sherlock looked down, and if John weren’t losing his mind, he would say that the detective looked upset, ‘‘Is that what you prefer, then, in your choice of partners?’’
‘‘I’ve never deliberately done it, but I’m sure I can try’’ Sherlock whispered, and John placed his hands on Sherlock’s waist to turn him around.
‘‘Never better’’ Sherlock said, truthfully.
She stopped her ministrations – to Sherlock’s confusion – to take off her bra, which caused the shutdown of Sherlock’s vascular and cardiac systems.
‘‘You didn’t guess. You knew. She asked me to decode the numbers on her phone, which I did, but before I could say it you took the phone from my hand, insulted her and called Mycroft’’ Sherlock had gotten up from his chair, and was standing right in front of John, looking down at him, which he knew John hated. ‘‘You knew she was in cahoots with Moriarty. You knew she was playing me’’ He bent down a little further, and John felt his exhale on the tip of his nose, ‘‘You. Didn’t. Guess’’
‘‘This is pointless’’ Sherlock almost yelled, startling both John and Lestrade alike. He pulled John by the hand, closer to the photos, ‘‘I need you’’
‘‘Sorry’’ He tried to say. It came out high pitched and breathy. He bent over, his laughter starting to cramp his stomach. ‘‘I’m the most-’’ John breathed, ‘‘Pathetic human being’’
She was soldier with a psychosomatic limp; a doctor with an adrenaline addiction; a small and angry woman who were horrible – if not soft - jumpers.
Sherlock just looked at him in open confusion, eyes sweeping over John’s clothes as if to determine the veracity of his words.
‘‘You can call me John, love’’ he let his tone slip to something gentler, but denied giving Sherlock what he wanted, moving back to rest his back on the chair again. He picked up the book that he kept just within reach, on his coffee table.
‘‘0-4-2-5’’ Sherlock said, and John watched though the corner of his eyes as the detective raised his chin defiantly.
‘‘Shhh, love, shhh’’ John’s mouth was so close now. His nose was touching Sherlock’s knuckles, his lips kissing any part of Sherlock’s face where they could reach. ‘‘Let me see you… please’’
Sherlock moaned, and John was half convinced that it was partially an act just to rile John up.
‘‘Go away, John’
‘‘But Sherlock, who else could get their hands on a drug like this? Who else has the power, the resources
‘‘Who.
‘‘None of it was real’’ John said, casting a glance at Sherlock before turning his eyes towards the road again.
‘‘Where is… John?’’ Sherlock tried to say, slurring through the words.
It was only three minutes after the silent wound cleaning and bandage applying that heard Sherlock crying. ‘‘Does it hurt?’’ John asked, even though he knew that wasn’t the reason behind it.
They walked around aimlessly for a bit, enjoying the comfortable silence between, only stopping to get something to snack as they continued. It had been so long since they’ve had this, the intimacy of each other’s space even if they were not quite touching. Their fingers brushed occasionally, their eyes met and their smiles matched, and Sherlock felt all the words that he wanted to say form a lump in his throat.
took all the courage he could muster. He ran a fingertip on Sherlock’s jaw, making a path from it to his lips and nose, keeping it light to not disturb him. Not that he was very effective.
Harry finally raised her head, a look of surprise and interest on her face, ‘‘Why don’t you want to go home to Mary?’’
’’ Harry’s voice was already distorted by the crappy telephone line that linked Afghanistan and England, but more so because she sounded like she had been crying.  This happened only a couple of months before John was shot, yet he remembered like it was yesterday.
John’s lips came very close to Sherlock’s, ‘‘You though that you could use the case as an excuse to have sex with me, and that I wouldn’t realise that you
Sherlock’s eyes widened before he blinked several times. Then he burst out laughing.
, he thought, as he lowered the phone to wipe his face and his nose.
it, you two had
‘‘Right, yes, of course’’ John laughed.
Jim just looked at him, his face a horrible mixture of anger and disgust. He opened his mouth to say something when some clatter amongst the men behind them interrupted him. ‘‘What is it?’’ he yelled, making Sherlock jump in fear.
‘‘Okay’’ Sherlock smiled, running his nose up and down John’s.
‘‘But,
). Something on the nightstand caught his eye: the white berry that John found in his hair yesterday and beneath it a note:
The last time that Sherlock Holmes had felt the excitement of a case, ‘the thrill and mystery of a chase’, had been over the Irene Adler fiasco. John doesn’t think ‘fiasco’ is strong enough to convey the horrid situation. Or the uncomfortable over-analysing stares that he’d been receiving from Sherlock ever since.
Harry sighed, ‘‘For the millionth time, John. You are not him. Stop saying that. What else about Sherlock?’’
And John was walking towards her. John’s hands were suddenly holding Sherlock’s face as if she were a China Doll. As if she were the most precious thing in the world.
‘‘Doctor, as I have said many times before, I am certain that Moriarty will attack if you and Sherlock are in the same room together. Haven’t I made clear the risks of the contact between you two?’’
John just hummed, giving him time. It took a full minute for Sherlock to speak again ‘‘Looking back, my reaction feels kind of silly-’’
Drunk-Alice, on the other side of the room, was trying to spike the eggnog without anyone noticing so, naturally, everyone noticed. Harry appeared to have been taken over by a laugh fit. There was a group of people singing
‘‘Because...’’ John sighed, ‘‘He’s fucking gorgeous, isn’t he? He should- he should be worshiped’’
Sherlock placed the last book on the shelf with a nervous sigh, turning to look at John, silently asking for his approval. Said army doctor had just returned from the grocery store and stood gaping at the living room from the threshold.
John did, and he quite liked it. ‘‘Okay’’
And Sherlock, who rarely allowed herself to hope, did just that. She raised her eyes to John’s beautiful ones, seeing nothing but affection there. She was trying to communicate something, to show what her words couldn’t, but Sherlock – the brightest person in any room - was slow on the message.
‘‘We shouldn’t have to endure an evening that is doomed to fail. Why can’t we be at home, enjoying ourselves… kissing…’’ John kissed him to illustrate that point, and Sherlock was momentarily sidetracked before he worked up the courage to say what he’d been feeling the entire morning.
call him that to his face. Please’’ Sherlock chuckled, and John laughed with him. The was a beat of silence and uncertainty before Sherlock said ‘‘What about yours?’’
‘‘Yes’’ John laughed, feeling the tension pop like a balloon, ‘‘Show me this thing because I’m getting curious, now’’
John had to move back to see him. ‘‘Jesus Christ’’ he said, and it was actually an invocation, because he didn’t think he would survive this sight. ‘‘Jesus Christ, Sherlock’’
John saw red, his grip tightening ‘‘And you think bullying me into it is the way to do it?’’
‘‘Glad you’re amusing yourself’’ John mumbled, not really upset. The thought of Sherlock wanting to marry her was enough to make John wish to be sent into outer space.
’’ John said as he pushed Sherlock to the side and ran to the bathroom, leaving the detective openly and loudly laughing at his demise.
‘‘Two’’
‘‘That’s not good enough. You haven’t eaten, you’ve barely slept…’’ John said as his head met the pillow, his eyes closed and his hand gripping on Sherlock’s arm.
. Like his existence was defined by it. He mourned his mother, then his childhood, then his sister’s childhood, then his mates at the army, then Sherlock, then baby girl, and now Sherlock again.
‘‘Oh, you
Hands cradled his head and hips, and warm lips brushed against his ear ‘‘I’ve got you, love. I’ll get you out of here’’
’’ repeatedly as they slowly got up and made their way to their bedroom.
‘‘Oh no. Are you not feeling well?’’ He said in mocked concern, and Sherlock thought that he would throw up when he recognized the voice. ‘‘I would try to comfort you, but I suppose that everything that I could say has already crossed your mind’’
Sherlock sighed ‘‘In any case, my problem isn’t memory loss, it’s memory inception. But I don’t see anything here that would make someone so subjective to another person’s control’’
’’ Alice said and Sherlock felt himself blush. John just laughed.
It was only after two years of grieving that John Watson allowed himself to go inside Sherlock’s room. He didn’t have an actual reason to do it. He wasn’t looking for anything or even organizing Sherlock’s things. It was more than time to put everything in boxes, maybe even selling some of all of it, but that wasn’t John’s intent ether. He walked in and was welcomed by a strong smell of dust. He opened the window and its curtains, before sitting down on the bed.
‘‘It’s okay’’ Sherlock smiled too, closing his eyes for a brief second when the room started spinning. Soon his hands were free, and he placed them on the back of John’s neck when the doctor started to carry him out of that warzone.
Given Sherlock’s dazzled expression when he pulled back, he managed just fine. Sherlock gathered his bearings and tried to pull John down again, but John didn’t let him. He kissed Sherlock’s throat just as skilfully.
‘‘Or maybe it’s because your father will be here on Christmas day’’ Sherlock backed away to look at John’s face, his analytical eyes sweeping over his every feature trying to deduce his feelings, but all Sherlock could see was how beautiful John was (
John nodded ‘‘He owns a hospital… but why he would buy this in his name and not the hospital’s is… weird’’
John grinded down, pulling both of Sherlock’s knees up and pushing them on the bed, sucking another mark on that gorgeous neck. ‘‘That’s right, beautiful. Let me hear you’’
Sherlock was already beside him at this point, trying to keep his eyes fixed on John despite the obstacles in the street. ‘‘What did you ask the universe?’’
Sherlock hid his face beneath his hands ‘‘Don’t look at me like that’’. The sound was muffled by John seemed to understand nonetheless. He chuckled a bit before resting his palm on Sherlock’s chest.
‘‘Sherlock, if you think that you have to bring me cases every week to keep me satisfied, you are wrong’’ John murmured. He was so close that Sherlock could feel the warmth of his breath on his back ‘‘and I don’t blame you for me getting fired. God knows I hated that place and wasn’t a very good employer. So stop acting so guilty’’
‘‘The perfect gift? Sherlock-’’ and Sherlock interrupted him with a kiss.
‘‘Hello to you’’ John said, amused, and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s ‘‘Have you been drinking?’’
‘‘Excellent!’’ Sherlock yelled, interrupting Lestrade, and said before hanging up ‘‘I’ll go get John’’
’’ He ignoring the way his stomach turned and his heart squeezed unpleasantly. John sighed, ‘‘Irene is literally you in female form. Why isn’t she enough?’’
Once Harry and John were alone, both occupied with cutting different vegetables, Harry bumped her arm against John’s ‘‘So? What happened?’’ She said.
John laughed, ‘‘I think we both have made deductions, haven’t we?’’
‘‘What? Is there a bug?’’ Not that he minded (
Except he didn’t. Moving out of Baker Street was the last thing that he wanted to do, and knowing that Sherlock had liked him didn’t help. He felt simultaneously better and worst and, being John Watson, he couldn’t and didn’t want to face any of those feelings. He stayed like that, leaning against the door for what felt like a couple of minutes, when a loud knock and a ‘‘Dr. Watson?’’ from the kitchen informed him that it might have been longer. In any case, Mycroft Holmes was now staring down at him.
John pressed against his joints, trying to notice any unusual swelling. ‘‘My money is on poison’’ He murmured, half paying attention to Sherlock, who just nodded.
John hummed, nodding, coming closer.
‘‘I remembered something’’ Sherlock said, his soup nearly finished. John just looked at him, waiting for him to continue ‘‘I don’t really know if it was real or not, but I’m guessing it was. The forged memories seemed to be… thematic, in a way’’ Sherlock casted a quick glance at John before continuing ‘‘There was someone saying a word to me… ‘Redbeard’’’
you and that’s the only thing that I vouched myself to never do and I still did it and-
‘‘What did he say?’’ John said, his voice rough.
Day 1 // Letters to Santa. 12 days of fic mas 2016
‘‘Like I love you?’’
‘‘Baskerville’’ John said, ominously, and as if on cue the Dartmoor Forest appeared outside his window.
And Sherlock giggled, finally looking at John, who looked afraid despite his easy tone. He sighed, wanting nothing more than to kiss him ‘‘I’m alright’’
‘‘You didn’t think I would just forgive her for that, did you?’’ John said, before taking a deep breath and rising from the bed and walking over to the table ‘‘Sherlock, when they bring up our food you are going to eat all of it, understand? Billy the skull looks more alive than you do’’ John laughed, trying to ease the tension, but his smile slipped away when he realized that there was something meaningful in Sherlock’s silence.
‘‘All good’’ he moved to get his coat, ‘‘Case, yeah?’’
‘‘Jesus... fucking God, John. Fuck I- It's so good. It’s so fucking good. Please. Please. Please’’ And once he started, he couldn’t stop. It turned into a prayer, and John was his deity.
John’s mouth closed shut. That answered that question, then.
Harry’s face was overcome with pity, again ‘‘Think about kissing Sherlock’’
‘‘Must have fallen from a mistletoe when we were putting them up’’ John said, mischief all over his face when he looked at Sherlock again ‘‘I wonder if the rule applies to this as well’’
Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat. His eyes glistened, and he shook his head.
He noticed John, back from unloading their food in the kitchen with a cuppa in his hand, siting on his chair to watch him play. Sherlock had been walking on eggs for the past two weeks, doing everything in his power to please John because, from what he had deduced, John was planning on leaving. Such conclusion seemed inescapable upon examining the facts, such as (1) Sherlock had almost set John’s last girlfriend’s hair on fire:
Lestrade stopped writing to look at him with one eyebrow raised (as did Donavan). ‘‘It’s not for you, it’s for a friend?’’
‘‘Sure’’ Sherlock interrupted, a bit nervous ‘‘Let’s do it. I’ve always wanted to meet Harry, anyway’’ To which John smiled. His toe made a path up Sherlock’s ankle which was… incredibly sexual. At least Sherlock’s body responded to it in a sexual way.
‘‘John’’ Sherlock moaned, and the sound made John freeze. He kissed Sherlock’s pulse point one last time before moving backwards, eyes closed and a frown between his eyebrows.
‘‘A…a wife? A sibling?’’ John frowned, looking throw Jonathan’s file until realization lit up his face ‘‘He lived with his brother’’. Sherlock smiled.
John pressed his lips against Sherlock’s neck, jawline and cheekbones, only stopping to nuzzle at his hair. ‘‘We are’’ he agreed.
Sherlock was too afraid to say anything or to remove his hands, so he just nodded. The weight of the bed shifted, and Sherlock thought that John was leaving before a hand came to rest on his hair.
‘‘Yes’’ Sherlock murmured, then ‘‘Yes! Serial killer, yes? Victims all in their mid-twenties, though they look younger. Five, correct?’’ He put on his coat and was already moving down the stairs.
were hosting the Christmas party, and John was foaming at the mouth.
John licked at it broadly, purposefully, mindfully. He pressed Sherlock’s legs to his chest and pushed his tongue inside of him, because the though alone was making him shiver in pleasure.
Sherlock grinned, his smiled taking over his whole face, and he bent down again to lie against John. After a beat, he said "What did you ask the universe, John?"
She had a hand on her belly, bending over, completely in hysterics. ‘‘You... you’’
‘‘The philanthropist?’’ John asked, making Sherlock look at him, confused.
The doctor felt dizzy, ‘‘Christ, I’m dehydrated’’ he laughed, looking at the top button of Sherlock’s shirt.
‘‘John’’ Sherlock moaned, hiding his face in the crook of John’s neck, and his army doctor just caressed his curls while murmuring sweet nonsense.
He looked himself in his room and neither ate or drank and, like a sad slave, stayed and thought of naught. He couldn’t bring himself to utter the words that he had to, that he wanted to, before the fall.
. He?’’ Sherlock growled. He felt John moving his gun to his left hand to hold Sherlock’s, the warmth of him keeping him grounded.
Once there, though, Sherlock deduced in less than 3 minutes that it had been, in fact, the owner who had killed Matthew, and for no apparent reason other than to prove he could. He welcomed Sherlock with a smile, offering to help him in any way he could.
Understanding drew on Sherlock’s face, ‘‘Yes, sir’’, but he didn’t move to get up, turning his face as if expecting a kiss.
, Sherlock thought,
, Sherlock thought, as he splashed water in his face again and again until the door of the bathroom shutting broke him out of it.
This up close, John could see the detective shivering, ‘‘Are you cold?’’ he said, and raised a hand to stroke Sherlock’s arm.
‘‘We were talking about...’’ John inhaled, the held his breath, ‘‘I think I was- I think he is gay’’
‘‘If you are worried about the work that we do hurting him, I-’’
John sat in his chair, too stunned to even breathe for a while. At his first shuddering inhale he got up and made his way towards Sherlock’s door.
A beat of silence and then Robert erupted in laughter ‘‘
The morning sun found the two women tangled in each other’s limbs on the sofa, sleeping peacefully. Mrs. Hudson took a mental note to talk to the girls about what sort of behavior was decent, which didn’t include awakening your landlady in the middle of the night
‘‘Really?’’ he said ‘‘I didn’t even notice’’ which made John smirk, way too proud of himself. Sherlock chuckled at him before picking up his phone and seeing the name of the caller ‘‘Someone better have died in the most interesting way possible, Graham’’
John nodded ‘‘They could make you believe that I have… hurt you, or assaulted you’’
Next thing John knew, there was a Sherlock-shaped blanket on top of him, breathing soundlessly against his neck. He brought his hands up to the beautiful mob of black hair tickling his nose.
‘‘John, dear, what would you like for Christmas? I’m going out today to buy some things and-’’
‘‘I’m fine’’ Sherlock said, placing a hand on her shoulder ‘‘I’m sorry for causing all this trouble’’. Alice and Harry shook their heads, trying to communicate that it was okay, and John just pulled Sherlock to their bedroom.
Sherlock frowned, raising his chin proudly ‘‘I can’t... I’’, his mouth opened and shut, as if it couldn’t comprehend Sherlock saying that he didn’t know something. He finally set on an expression that was nearly cruel, predatory, ‘‘You haven’t denied what you are’’
John snorted and sputtered ‘‘I’m not
‘‘Whatever do you mean?’’
’’ She sobbed, and John waited patiently for her. She cried for a few minutes, and continued ‘‘
‘‘So the real question is: how did I imagine all of that? It felt real, John. Everything that happened. But no mind palace can make all of that up without stimulants, and I only willingly took them a couple of weeks from now’’ Sherlock frowned, listing in his mind a number of drugs that could have been given to him without him knowing.
Mycroft’s men had her for a bit. And then they didn’t. Mycroft came two days later to inform John that her body had been found by the Tames.
He leant down and kissed Sherlock’s open lips, trying to make him believe that he was loved, that he was cherished for who he was, including all of the trades that Sherlock considered to be his flaws.
. Sherlock pressed his hands against his mouth, stifling its sounds as his eyes watered.
The next morning found John Watson sweating under the furnace that was Sherlock Holmes and with a bladder desperately full. There was no way to push his boyfriend away without ether waking him, or offending him, and John pondered over this dilemma for fifteen full minutes before he realized that Sherlock was softly chuckling on top of him.
. John’s jaw clenched and he didn’t drink. ‘‘You want a relationship without sex’’
‘‘Harry? What’s wrong?’’ He said, walking out of the tent to the cold breezy wind.
John smiled and caressed Sherlock’s arm ‘‘Yeah, sure’’
Sherlock looked amazing. Beautiful. Perfect. Lustful. Aroused, In love. Heart-breaking. He nodded, ‘‘More than okay, John’’ and his voice was a whisper, but it was certain. He raised his hips so John could pull his trousers down, and John took the opportunity to remove the detective’s pants, as well.
‘‘Stop’’ Sherlock wheezed, giggling loudly, and John eventually had mercy on him. ‘‘
John moved to take the envelops, but Sherlock took a step back, ‘‘Remember what you promised’’ He looked frightened again.
John’s heart broke and mended back together again, just from remembering Sherlock’s words. He imagined the rest of his life with Sherlock would be just like this: heart-breaking, but only because it’s so beautiful.
Sherlock looked scandalized. ‘‘I respect her as an adversary. Someone who bested me. I certainly don’t trust or like her. Much less feel any sort of attraction towards her. Sexual or otherwise’’
Sherlock raised his eyes, frightened, ‘‘What?’’
‘‘Don’t be scared of Harry’’ He whispered directly into Sherlock’s ear, making him shiver. Then he straightened and said louder ‘‘And don’t believe a thing she says’’
He looked at the tub awkwardly before rubbing at his neck ‘‘Do you want to do this alone or-’’
‘‘Yes, why?’’ Sherlock looked down for a moment ‘‘Why don’t we just run away?’’
‘‘Christ’’ John sighed, frowning, and shook his head.
make him breathless and… smitten, no matter how much Alice teased him for it.
There were things that John needed to say - things that had to be resolved between them before it was too late. What Sherlock suffered in the last months was proof of that. John sat in his bed, elbows on his knees and palms covering his face, and finally gave into the fear and self-hatred – to the absolute desperation of not being around to protect Sherlock from becoming prey of someone’s sick game.
‘‘Whatever you received must have been that times a thousand, but I wouldn’t put it past anyone to enhance the effects of this drug. Who has the power and connections to drug you with this and, at the same time… keep us apart?’’ John clenched his jaw and took a deep breath, slowing the car to take the entrance to the small village where they’d stayed a few years ago.
‘‘Gotta be quick around here, Captain’’ Sherlock flashed him a grin and laughed when John bit his lip to keep from smiling. He showered quickly, focusing on his hair more than usual, breathing in the humidity that eased the pain in his throat. Soon he was done, wrapping a towel around his hips and using the adjoining door with his bedroom. John must have heard Sherlock leaving, because he promptly entered the bathroom without a word.
, John wondered – still hoping, with his mind locked on how well the words ‘Sherlock’ and ‘Watson’ went together - but said ‘‘I’ve never been there’’
John looked down at his watch:
‘‘Any luck?’’
‘‘Are you warm, love?’’
‘‘Ask him if they adopted a murderous dog’’ He grumbled, which made Sherlock giggle.
‘‘It wasn’t’’
‘‘There you go’’ He said, kissing along Sherlock’s jawline and moving his fingers to run though Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock nodded, clasping his hands behind his back and shrugging like it was no big deal, ‘‘Well, I do live here’’ he said, picking up his violin and playing Piazzolla’s Winter, which he knew John liked best. The truth is Sherlock had timed perfectly the moment when he would start cleaning the house so that John would come in, see the end result and, at the same time, know it was him.
‘‘But I do love you’’
‘‘Alright?’’ He asked her.
John raised his eyebrows, mock-surprised. ‘‘Isn’t sentiment a crack in the lens?’’
‘‘I’m going to be forward again’’
‘‘Your wife to be’’
John was grateful that she knew what she was talking about, because John himself had no clue. Sometimes he loved his sister more than life itself, ‘‘I love you’’
John Watson was a dumbass.
He didn’t live there anymore, of course. He lived in the house where he should have raised a little girl. He dusted his little girl’s room twice a week.
Baker Street was just as he remembered. Warm and cosy. His home, which he only realised he missed like a limb when the ache in his chest became unbearable.
He had slept on Sherlock’s chair, or leaning against his gravestone. He remembered being dragged out of a bar by Lestrade a couple of times, and by Harry once. He was fed by Mrs. Hudson and by Sarah. Even Molly had stopped by with some food and tears in her eyes. Eventually people weren’t as uncomfortable with his attitude as they used to be. At first John got better at hiding his pain, and then he just… got better. He was well enough to notice the new nurse at the surgery flirting with him. And then he was well enough to flirt back.
John had stated his claim. The three of them were nothing more than animals at that point. Seeing the fear and respect in Irene's eyes was glorious. Seeing aw in Sherlock’s was the only victory he understood.
Sherlock allowed himself to be in his mind palace for a while, only paying attention to the food he was eating, before Mrs. Hudson said something that made him lose his focus.
John shrugged, ‘‘I think it was sweet’’
‘‘John’’
‘‘We need to talk about it, first’’
Sherlock stared at him incredulously, literally taken aback, ‘‘You are unbelievable’’
‘‘Thank god you’re okay’’ John whispered, only partially aware of what he was saying ‘‘I was so worried, love. So worried’’ He sniffled, bringing Sherlock’s face to his chest in a desperate hug.
Sherlock was lying on the sofa when she heard the front door opening and John Watson’s incidental steps towards the stairs.
The tone around 221 B was eerie, somehow mystical. The kind of atmosphere apt for life-changing choices to be made.
John and Sherlock regarded at the bowl for a couple of seconds in silence, before John cleared his throat.
Sherlock pulled the phone from his ear and covered it with his palm before turning to John ‘‘Do you want take on a case today? I reckon we can solve this in less than 30 minutes’’
‘‘Fuck’’ John moaned, unable to look away, melting through the mattress until Sherlock raised his hips to move further up John’s body. ‘‘Baby, no. I have to-’’
Christmas eve felt surreal in a way that Sherlock couldn’t quite explain. Birds were chipping and the sunlight was too strong for his taste, but Sherlock wasn’t irritated. John was sleeping peacefully by his side, and Sherlock couldn’t help running a finger gently down his nose, his lips and his jawline. He did that for quite a while before John’s lips twitched in a smile, his eyes still closed, and his hand came to rest on Sherlock’s waist.
‘‘You’re staring’’ Sherlock grumbled, cracking open just a slit of one eye to look at John.
‘‘I think we need to divide this in steps’’ John said, his voice muffled by the mask he was wearing, his eyes examining the kitchen. They had both geared up in yellow overalls; the same kind doctors use to treat patients in quarantine. ‘‘Let’s just throw away all of the objects today’’
‘‘We’ve been thinking about moving the headquarters to a new location, you know? Somewhere a bit more reserved, more difficult to find. We’ve also been thinking about doing a harder initiation process because it makes sense that the community has only smart members, you know? And…’’ Anderson said, completely unaware that Sherlock’s attention was not directed at him.
‘‘Alright, alright. That arm is attached to a person, you know’’
John sighed, exasperated, but just looked out his window. Since Sherlock was sitting directly behind him, he touched his shoulder, trying to communicate some sort of support. John pulled Sherlock’s fingers to his lips, kissing the ring finger of his left hand, and successfully shutting down Sherlock’s cardiac system.
‘‘And there will be no spanking of any kind’’ John said, resolutely. ‘‘I’ve had vanilla relationships before, you know. It’s not like I need it. No one needs it. Don’t trust what you ready on the internet’’
John put his lips to better, more productive, use.
‘‘It wasn’t my…my intention to…’’ Sherlock started, but John just shook his head. He took his phone out of his pocket, having received a text, and Sherlock read, over John’s shoulder, Sarah’s name. John’s whole posture changed from tense to resigned, and there was only one conclusion that Sherlock could draw. He was proven right when, the next morning, John didn’t go to the clinic or even change from his pajamas.
Harry snorted, humorless ‘‘
‘‘You are not a monster, John. You never were.’’, Harry Watson said, twirling the wine glass that was filled with apple juice. She looked John dead in the eye, ‘‘You’re a dumbass’’
‘‘No’’ Sherlock yelled, ‘‘I’ll bring it to you’’
. Sh. Sh. Sh. Don’t try to fight it, my dear. We have all the time in the world’’ He got up and sat cross-legged on the floor, right in front of Sherlock. He ran his fingers through the detective’s hair ‘‘This is so fun. Coming back to life, I mean. What’s happening
John smiled, ‘‘Yes’’
man, Jonathan Wilks, was a train worker who was conveniently stationed in every city where a girl went missing, and later was found dead’’
John sat up straighter in his chair, shaking of a tremor in his hand, ‘‘Sherlock, I’m not-’’
With a quarter of his cock up Sherlock’s arse, John followed, grunting and moaning and maybe even crying a little, he wasn’t sure.
’’ John said, jokingly, making Sherlock’s eyes widen.
He didn’t wear a disguise for half the day and then took it off in a dramatic turn of events. John didn’t pass out, yell, hit Sherlock or was made fun of for having grown hair in non-flattering places. He most certainly was not interrupted in the middle of a date – John had been strategically avoiding Mary for the past three months.
we need answers for? Ha Ha’’ John joked, awkwardly ‘‘Isn’t life just a series of puzzling events?’’
to calm down’’ Sherlock said leaning forward to steal a kiss. John indulged him for a few seconds, only stopping when Sherlock let out a quiet moan. Sherlock frowned and whispered ‘‘Sorry, I’ll be quiet’’
‘‘Take off your coat, jacket and shirt. Let’s take a look’’ The Capitan said.
‘‘Blood test was clean’’ Molly said, just as John opened the victim’s mouth and eyes.
‘‘Beautiful flowers for a beautiful man’’ He said, quietly, smiling as Sherlock’s blush only deepened.
that John was his. Undeterred, Sherlock still introduced John to everyone in the premise.
‘‘Is this a reference to some popular culture that I’m not aware of?’’ which just made John laugh.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, ‘‘Obviously’’
John scoffed, running his hands through his hair, ‘‘Alright’’
‘‘Hello, love’’ He said, finally opening his eyes and leaning forward to press his lips against Sherlock’s. He took Sherlock’s left hand, the one that had been caressing his face, and looked at his ring finger quite intently before bringing it to his mouth and kissing it. ‘‘What do you want to do today? Go out for a walk? Stay in bed…’’
‘‘Where’s Sherlock?’’ He asked Harry, who was making dinner with Alice.
And Sherlock knew that too.
‘‘Me?’’ John laughed ‘‘I didn’t do anything’’
Day 8: The perfect gift // 12 days of ficmas 2016
‘‘You mean me’’ Sherlock said, smiling too, and laughed when John didn’t deny it. He pulled John’s face for a kiss that was more tongue than lips, and John indulged him for a moment before he realized that Sherlock was straddling his hips.
Sherlock watched John closely as the detective stood bare in front of him, as John shaved him and washed his hair… as he gently ran his fingers over the marks on Sherlock’s arms. It was only when John brought one of Sherlock’s hands up to his lips that Sherlock finally spoke.
‘‘I always leave some of them in my nightstand-’’ Sherlock started but John interrupted him.
John watched him for a while. Then, ‘‘Sherlock’’
‘‘We are very private’’ he said, looking behind at who had just arrived threw the door ‘‘And there he is right now’’
John answered by caressing Sherlock’s cheek bone.
Eventually, they made their way to the middle of the dance floor, slow dancing to an Elvis Presley song. John smiled up at him and kissed along his jawline while Sherlock closed his eyes, letting John’s affection and the song wash over him. John moved his lips to Sherlock’s ear ‘‘
The Watson siblings didn’t exchange many words, comfortably asking each other yes or no questions to fill the time.
John hummed, suddenly becoming distracted by Sherlock’s hair. There was a single curl on the middle of his forehead, brushing against his eyebrow. It looked soft like silk. John only realized that he’d reached for it when his hand came into view. He cleared his throat, aborting the movement and rubbing his temple, before lacing his fingers together.
‘‘Yes, it is’’ He said, and it felt like something much more meaningful was happening. Sherlock looked at him, his John - the real John - and wondered how he had been fooled for so long by that imposter. The man before him was absolutely perfect. ‘‘Let’s go get some rest’’ John continued, removing his hand to grab their small backpacks and get out of the car, and Sherlock followed right after.
John tugged on his hair a little, ‘‘You are so naughty’’, but his voice didn’t sound reprehensive. It sounded awed.
Soon the afternoon turned into evening, which they filled by playing games and singing Christmas carols. Sherlock discovered that John made a very good impression of Frank Sinatra, which absolutely did
‘‘John?’’ Sherlock sounded scared. John felt sorry for him, but he also couldn’t stop laughing.
Sherlock felt a blush form on his cheeks. He looked away from John and to the road, closing his eyes and trying to focus on something else, like the fact that-
, John though, as his eyes cast over Sherlock’s thin frame. There was a scrub on his cheeks, which were too hollow for John’s liking. He was fidgeting from one foot to the other, a teapot in one hand and the kettle in the opposite. He placed them on the table, running his hands on his hair.
Sherlock scoffed, but his face turned very red, very quickly, ‘‘It
the motive?’’
Sherlock moaned louder, and John abandoned any pretence of surviving this.
?’’ John tried to swallow away his discomfort without much success. Saying the words that needed to be said involved much more bravery than John was expecting.
Sherlock woke up the next morning feeling too well to be hangover. He looked at John – sleeping peacefully on his side, facing Sherlock – with his beautiful eyelashes and laugh lines, and the memories of all that had happened the night before hit him like a truck.
‘‘Too bloody long to want someone and not have them, if you ask me’’ John moved further down, easing his weigh from Sherlocks knees and into the bed. He dipped his tongue inside Sherlock’s belly button.
Sherlock searched his eyes for a little while, then smiled, ‘‘Okay’’
‘‘You are not’’
John frowned, looking at Sherlock for clarification. ‘‘One of the things he told me that day is that you would never find me desirable’’ Sherlock said quietly.
‘‘You make me warm, John’’
Sherlock took a deep breath, and nodded, rising stiffly from his knees, his trousers doing nothing to hide his own erection. Especially when he, bashful, put his hands in front of it and ran to John’s room before either one of them could comment on it.
‘‘Why not?’’
‘‘That’s not fair. I'm not a genius’’
Sherlock thought as his impeding deduction slipped away. ‘‘Can I ask you things? About your childhood, teenage years…’’ John murmured, still holding Sherlock’s hand, whose owner nodded. ‘‘What were your Christmases like, when you still lived with your parents?’’
‘‘No, don’t cry, baby’’ John kissed his tears, laying down and bringing Sherlock on top of him.
Harry’s eyebrows lifted, ‘‘Now this should be interesting. Why do you envy me?’’
‘‘Sherlock. We came here. To do something’’ he was breathing hard and starring at Sherlock’s lips, mirth on his features.
‘‘What did I tell you yesterday?’’ He said, and Sherlock remembered
, he had said, and John was hooked. Life with him was exciting in ways the battlefield hadn’t been, and John discovered he had something meaningful to live for. Consciously or not, he bestowed upon himself the mission of protecting the world’s only consulting detective (in a platonic way, since said detective was married to his work).
John’s lips twitched, ‘‘That can be arranged’’
‘‘Sherlock, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean-’’
John studied his face for a while before nodding and making his way towards Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen. Sherlock took a deep breath when he looked at Robert, who was smirking, and raised his hand, indicating the stairs.
I love you?’’
‘‘I was wondering if it still fit’’ John laughed, pulling down the sleeves of his jacket by its cufflinks then running his fingers through his hair, a smirk on his lips. He focused on Sherlock, who was using the wall of the lab they’d just broke into as support ‘‘You okay?’’
Sherlock laughed again, shaking his head. ‘‘We lived together for years and you didn’t make the most obvious deduction of all. Or you did, but you’ve doubted yourself ever since’’
‘‘They say The Big Ben is beautiful this time at night’’
Sherlock’s eyes widened, like a dear caught in the lights, and he shook his head.
Settling into this role was as easy as being a doctor. As easy as being a soldier. As easy as being in love with Sherlock Holmes. His voice didn’t waiver, ‘‘I’ll have to touch you, is that alright?’’
‘‘No, I was wrong’’ Mycroft said, emphatically, forcing Sherlock to look at him ‘‘In my fear of you feeling grief I closed you of from love’’ Mycroft’s face softened ‘‘And love, dear brother, especially the love you feel for John Watson, is a vicious motivator’’
Sherlock sat down on the sofa when John reached the first of the seventeen steps. She began crying when she reached the fifth.
‘‘We’ll continue this later’’ Captain Watson said before he stood up and angrily changed from his pajamas to a pair of jeans.
‘‘I can’t go home without an actual case’’ he said to himself, his voice small, and it made Lestrade shift his demeanor from an amused to a concerned one. Realizing his mistake, Sherlock quickly said ‘‘I’ll just take one of the interrogation rooms, then, shall I’’ and left rapidly with the files.
Sherlock just nodded, using John’s help to get up. John wrapped a hand around Sherlock’s waist to keep him close, looking at him every few seconds to make sure he was okay, which he didn’t seem to be.
‘‘Woo-hoo’’ Harry sighed ‘‘Alright. Sherlock and Alice are gonna clean up the place while John and I make the food’’
‘‘Oh! Boys, I nearly forgot’’ Mrs. Hudson startled both of them by her screech and by placing a rather large bowl of sweets in front of them. ‘‘Mrs. Turner’s tenants make these every year and they always offer me some. Aren’t they adorable?’’
‘‘Sherlock’’ John whispered, taking an assessing look at the scars which seemed to have heaved and the ones that didn’t. Sherlock was wearing his dog tag. John ran his fingers lightly on Sherlock’s shoulders and his nape, just on the edges of the string, before sitting on the coffee table and getting to work.
‘‘God’’ Sherlock moaned. And the rest of his words were just garbled syllables. He started to rock back against John’s face, fucking himself on John’s tongue. He arched his back, resting his weight on his face so he could bring both hands back to spread his cheeks apart.
‘‘Are you… are you trying to compete against Mrs. Turner’s married ones?’’ Sherlock wheezed out though his laughter.
John was beautiful. There was no other word that Sherlock could use. The hard lines that drew his shoulders and arms were contrasted by the soft ones, as those on his tummy. He was rough edges and soft middles, entirely perfect. John had a smile on his face, like he could read Sherlock’s mind, as he came closer. He placed his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks, running his thumbs over Sherlock’s cheekbones.
‘‘Stay right behind me, okay?’’ John said taking charge, a gun in his hands and a fierce look on his face.
‘‘You’ve lost weight’’ John tried to reprimand, his voice dropping a few notes. He brushed off the little paper from his forehead and rubbed his temple, holding his head on two fingers.
Sherlock was circling around her around her, those vibrant eyes taking everything in, when he suddenly stopped. ‘‘Doctor’’
Sherlock winced, looking away, effectively hiding his face from John. ‘‘Nothing’’ he said, his tone neutral.
But in all of that – including things that he hoped weren’t from the crime scenes that they investigated together and therefore had belonged to a dead person and should be with the family at best or in police custody at worst – John’s heart stopped when he saw the business cards.
‘‘Yeah, you’re right. Do they have a Lady Gaga trivia for you to obliterate everyone at?’’ John said, which made Sherlock laugh and place his head on John’s shoulder. He kissed it once, just because it was right there. Then he kissed it a second time. Then- ‘‘Sherlock, we should have left 30 minutes ago’’
‘‘One day, when you have a child, you will understand what it’s like’’ Robert said with a condescending tone. Sherlock sighed as the microwave pinged, and he placed the plate in front of Robert, silently urging him to eat and stop talking. Robert seemed to notice, because he smiled ‘‘Make no mistake, Mr. Holmes, my son is normal, even if he is pretending not to be for whatever reason. I stand by what I said that night’’
John only grunts in response.
‘‘They arrested her right after the baby was born. I provided the memory stick as evidence. Just a month after the whole ‘Miss me?’ shenanigan’’
‘‘Ocular chrysalis’’ Sherlock murmured.
‘‘You didn’t guess’’
Why was that the most erotic thing that had ever happened to John Watson?
And Sherlock did, a blissful, miraculous expression on his face, the beauty of it alone enough to push John there, as well.
Sherlock woke up in a comfortable king size bed, in a large fancy room that seemed to belong to a mansion. He laid there, and it took him three seconds to remember all that had occurred. The men, the guns, John’s unconscious body on top of him.
‘‘You look like you read about this’’ John looked at his position, ‘‘Any questions for me?’’
As it turned out, the familiar voice that he had heard belonged to no other than Lestrade. John had escaped from his sell to phone for his help, unaware that Mycroft had arranged some backup even before what happened in Baskerville. His men didn’t know where Moriarty’s secret hide out was, though, and if it weren’t for John, the plan would have failed even before it started.
