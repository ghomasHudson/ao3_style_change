“Sometimes, I wonder how you do it,” Steve says to the empty air. His voice sounds like it’s been dragged over coals, like he’s been screaming for hours and hours. There’s no response, and Steve wasn’t expecting one, but the silence still rings loudly against the linoleum tile.
and it’s only then that Tony remembers that Captain America went into the ice at twenty-six and came out the same age.

Tony’s seven when he learns to stop flinching away from people who want to hurt him.
Steve thought he knew the meaning of loss.
“It’s the Milano. Holy shit,” and if Steve could feel anything at all, he'd be surprised that it’s the racoon who's speaking. Instead, he shakes his head and starts jogging, heading towards the ship with single minded determination.
That’s how old Peter was.
He keeps his steps even and measured even as he feels himself falling apart.
and the moment ends.
. You need to run back to base. He’s barely breathing. He needs— he needs a hospital,” and those final words bolt through him, a shock to his system.
He didn’t know he could feel this way.
Steve had known guilt was heavy, but this is suffocating.
sensation ripping through his throat and the world goes dark again.
Gently, oh so gently, Steve takes Tony’s right hand in his, marveling at his warmth, his callouses, his nails, his skin. Tony’s always been bronzed, his natural olive undertone making him look golden in the sunlight. Steve, on the other hand, has always been well aware of his own Irish complexion. Tony had teased him about it when they’d all first moved into the Tower, throwing good natured jibes in Steve’s direction about speedos and sunscreen.
“He must have survived. His tracker is still active.”
He builds a suit.
Every one of Steve’s senses goes silent as he bursts into a run, practically ripping Tony from the woman’s grasp, red immediately staining the palms of his hands. Tony’s skin is practically burning his skin with fever, but it’s him, breathing and beaten and broken but alive alive
The world keeps spinning even as the stars sing.
Then Jarvis is there with tea and milk, a small plate of cookies resting beside the cups, and Tony feels the word home settle in his bones like it's always belonged there.

Yinsen’s voice is soft as down, like he’s trying to take the sting out of the words, out of the revelation.
Steve runs and he runs and he

Darkness creeps up around his vision and Tony lets himself fall.
They’d tried to save Vision, they’d refused to remove the stone by citing contingency, and it had cost them half the universe. One man’s life for billions of others. And Vision died with them, anyway.
He closes his eyes and watches DUM-E puttering around the workshop, hears JARVIS’s smooth timbre over the
Over seventy years ago, he crashed a plane into the ocean to stop a bomb that would’ve killed millions. Only five years ago, he defeated an insane robot that destroyed a country from the bottom up. Two years ago, he nearly traded Tony’s life for Bucky’s.
A cruel mix between disgusted and resigned.
He lets himself think of black ice, whiskey and bourbon— his father’s apathy so thick it’s almost dripping. He sees strawberry hair and a sharp salute followed by a smile warm as candlelight.
In the darkest and deepest recesses of space, there’s the sound of rubble shifting, settling— an audible signal of the end. The sky is red and full of smoke, particles of metal and rock floating aimlessly through the air as if they’re afraid to land.
He feels rather than hears Bruce say his name, the pressure from his grip sinking through the shoulder of his uniform as he finally tears his eyes away from Tony’s face.
He couldn’t stop it. The world turned to ash, and he couldn’t stop it.
In a flash, he’s tearing at his bandages, pulling them away like wet paper. There’s a sound, animalistic and high, and it takes him a second too long to realize that it’s him that’s making it.
He doesn’t reply, can’t, his breath coming in sharp, short bursts and he’s going upup
Tony shakes hands with death again, but this time it’s Obadiah who sets up the meeting.
There’s no way.
Then there’s an explosion and Rogers is wrapping his body around yours, cushioning the blow, and for the first time, you're not the one that’s left tasting ash.
A journalist approaches him and calls him the Merchant of Death, but two hours later he’s between her thighs.
He (Anthony,
They’re twenty years too late, anyways.
, cradled in the safety of his arms.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” and Tony feels like he’s seventeen again, a police officer at the door, waiting for the sky to fall.
The rest of him remains numb. He thinks the last living parts of himself were left on Titan.
He lets the pain flow through him like some kind of penance, but it’s not enough. It will never be enough.
He’s scrambling out of his armored car, ears ringing and vision blurry, his phone fumbling in his hand and he’s calling Obadiah because he’ll send someone, anyone, he’ll know what to do when—
There’s a searing burst of pressure in his side and then it’s only pain and thoughts of Peter before it all fades to black.
That’s Steve, isn't it?
You meets Captain fucking America, and it takes everything you can to not spit in the mans picture perfect face.
He gives Pepper his company, lets Rhodey take one of his suits, and then a spider with eyes like glass and hair like fire shoves a needle into his neck and tells him to get a grip.
It feels like rock bottom, but then Tony digs deeper.
It’s Tony.
Rhodey gently takes both, approaching Tony like he’s a spooked animal, filling the room with hushed words and empty assurances. He’s careful to avoid the broken glass at Tony’s feet— the ripped wood of the now broken mirror.
Just barely.
“And I’m thankful,” Steve croaks, continuing even as he tangles his fingers with Tony’s lax ones.
Chaos they'd inadvertently caused.
Anthony Edward Stark is born as an explosion— destructive and wild eyed, hair soot dark, his round cheeks ruddy with exertion.
Not that there were many.
Afghanistan is stifling— sauna hot without the humidity. The temperature dries his lips but he moistens them with bourbon and two-bit jokes that put the soldiers around him at ease.
Tony will live. He has to. If he hasn’t died yet, that means he’s not meant to, and while Steve has always had a hard time accepting fate as law, he’s praying it’s at work now.
He relaxes, all of the fight gone out of him.
Aunt Peggy is a whirlwind, mouth red as menace and eyes sharp as tacks. Her hair is pristine, but her voice is sickle sweet and tea warm. She teaches Tony how to form a fist, how to throw a punch, how to plant his feet and snarl.
An explosion.
Obadiah burns and it’s Tony’s fault even though Pepper says it isn’t.
He wishes Strange had let him die.
He stares at the broken remains of Obie’s—
Tomorrow, the sun will come up and there will still be bodies laying out in the field. Tomorrow, a new day will start and half the world will still be dust.
In the other, he holds a 9 millimeter Glisenti pistol.
He sits there for an hour, two, the sun slowly setting beyond the glass of the window. His breath shudders and his face is wet, but all the while, he holds Tony’s hand.
She looks vaguely disgusted as she says the word “team” and Steve can’t blame her. He’s barely seen Natasha or Bruce or, hell, even Rhodey since everything ended. He has no idea if Thor is even on Earth anymore.
“Stark…you know that’s a one way trip.” Rogers voice sounds so resigned, so
Tomorrow, Tony will wake up. Maybe he’ll scream, maybe he’ll cry, maybe he’ll tell Steve to get out of his sight. Whatever happens, it won’t matter. As long as he’s alive.
At least then he’d be able to afford it.
“Steve…
They form a plan.
Bloody and with one foot in the grave, but he's here and Steve has never seen anyone so beautiful.
Soon, it’s all you know.
He’d thought that seeing Steve again would be painful. That it’d hurt. They hadn’t said a word to each other after Siberia, not really— only sending the odd text every now and again, usually while drunk or exhausted or lonely beyond measure.
He opens his eyes.
, no please
You meet Captain America.
He’d never known hope could be so painful.
There are women and there are drugs and there are empty bottles that smell like his father’s breath, all wood barreled disappointment.
The Captain told you to, after all.
“Tony,” and
They reach the doors of the ship right as they open with a gust of air and a
Steve can’t say how long he’s been sitting there or how long Bruce has been trying to get his attention, but how could anyone expect anything of him when Tony is
Before anyone can say another word, Steve has Tony clutched to his chest, sprinting at full speed. It takes a moment to recognize the sensation he’s feeling, only to realize it’s the wind on his face, whipping at his cheekbones. All around him is the smell of earth and blood and the scent of ozone. Suddenly, it’s like everything has been thrown back into vivid technicolor, abrupt and jarring in contrast to the constant black and white of the after.
Hands. Chest. Neck.
A camera flashes in his face and it’s gunpowder and sand, the
But he’d wake up and he’d be fine. Bruce said so.
You can’t let a little thing like cardiac arrest stop you now.
“I’m so thankful that you keep coming back. Even if it’s not to me. You could take one look at me when you wake up and tell me to get out, to go to hell, and I’ll leave, I swear. All I need is for you to wake up, to be fine, to— to keep moving. Because we need you.” Steve swallows, his voice growing weaker.
He sleeps.
Or perhaps it’s been hours. Maybe years. It’s all the same to Tony.
Unlike Pepper, he isn’t gentle— he just rips and tears and
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Natasha and Bruce making their way towards him, adjusting their pace to keep up. A beat, and then Thor and the racoon-thing he’d shown up with step into his line of sight, silent and solemn.
so he keeps his gaze focused on where a blue woman is stepping forwards, out of the shadows, mechanical and otherworldly.
He’d wanted a drink.  If he was dying anyway, he could have one drink, right? The burn of the scotch hitting his throat, he could have that, one last time.
“Jesus,” Tony said, clearly confused, “you’re not female. I mean I guess you have the chest for it but you’ve got more manbits than my usual partners.  Less, you know, long hair and well, clitoris.  Did they know about the clitoris before you were frozen?” He groaned, shielding his eyes. “What the hell is going on. Am I in your room? What did I drink last night?” Tony asked, blinking in the sun.
“Uh, maybe you didn’t notice, but I’ve also been in the business of life? Didn’t hear? It’s okay, only been all the headlines for the past eighteen months or so.  Intellicrops? Vaccines? Body armor? Sustainable energy?”
Tony’s fingers fidgeted, the way they did when he was making rapid calculations or creating code.  “He said you’re enamored of me.”
Tony’d written when he got an A on a quiz.  Flying had congratulated him. Like he meant it.  Like he was proud of him.
“And what, you’re the village idiot? I don’t know if you realized this, but Peggy wasn’t really the sort to tolerate idiots.”
Steve couldn’t get his nerves to calm, deciding instead to start again on that email chain.  He continued sifting through different files and attachments, downloading them to his phone so he could move into the kitchen, where Tony was most likely to show up.  He archived one chain, starting on another.  It looked promising, communication between someone named Raza and a seller who called himself Iron Monger  from about a year and a half ago, just before the weapons started disappearing.  He had just downloaded a copy of their video call when Tony came up the stairs.
“Back at you, man! Did you even eat anything today? Besides a smoothie?”
“Any other brilliant ideas, Steve?” Tony asks waspishly.  “Want me to pack him a bag lunch every day? Make sure it’s got potato chips? Put in some post-its saying how much I care?”
“Steve’s cooking.  He’ll owe me breakfast,” Tony said, winking. Rhodey just shook his head.
“Nope, I’m good,” Tony replied, voice terse, keeping his hands in his pockets. “Hey, I’m getting started on those upgrades to your gloves.  Want to head down to the workshop later?”
they were talking about like a lab rat. Erskine’s original document was safe, never digitalized, according to Daddy Dickhead, and housed where Howard could keep an eye on it.  His insurance, Tony guessed, in case Stern ever wanted to renege on his deal. Howard really had been the best at this game.
“Tony?” Steve called, quiet. Tony looked over his shoulder and Steve noticed again how tired he looked.  How worn down. “Am I really the second longest running PA you’ve ever had?”
“What? I’ve been working there for almost a month.  He’s friendly. We got to know each other pretty well. We’re friends. He told me to call him Tony.” It sounded pleading even to himself.
He packed a bag. Just a few clothes, toothbrush, cash. He was just double checking that he had what he needed when Tony showed up in his doorway.
“What do you need this time?” Rhodey asked through the granola bar.
He entered the room and turned on the light.  The one-armed man was lounging on a filing cabinet, but Tony recognized bravado when he saw it.  Years of practice in perfecting just that air of not giving a shit.  Tony scanned him. Missing arm. Remnants of a tattoo on his shoulder.  Loose hair, falling out of the pink hairband. Wouldn’t have really pegged him for a pink hairband kinda guy.  Military, probably.  Ex-military, anyway.  And he owed them, he did.  But he was also in the middle of dealing with a long and involved catastrophe that (Tony was 95% sure) involved corporate espionage, a pissed off military, and his weapons ending up in places they shouldn’t have.  He couldn’t let that happen again. That would not be his legacy. “I wish I could just let you go,” he said. “But I can’t.  You know that.”
Goddammit Steve, he can walk the three feet from his door to theirs.
Steve dipped his head down, resting his forehead gently against Tony’s, saying nothing.
Tony almost laughed.  “You know I’m a mechanic, right? World’s best engineer? Greatest mind in science?”
“Thanks, Rogers,” Tony said, mildly. He wouldn’t drop the question, but he’d just ask Rhodey about it afterward. “This is Jim Rhodes.  Rhodey, this is Steve Rogers.”
“Nice!” Rhodey exclaimed, going for a fist bump.  “Relax, Barnes, I owe you one. Besides, you’re not in uniform.”
“Sometimes you’ve got to move on, right? I’m sure.” He looked out the window again.
She downloaded another chunk of messages. They were largely congratulatory.  Iron Monger was pleased to see that everything had gone as planned. No rescue group left in the area.  They’d all been flown out.  Time for phase two. Raza, according to Natasha, had said he was ready for the next target and the big guns.  A deal was a deal, he insisted.
“And you never made it back?”
Steve just smiled at him. “It’s okay, Tony.  Don’t worry about it. Any of your friends are always welcome here, too.”
They ate sandwiches and played games for hours.  They’d ruled out Pictionary, since Steve could sketch anything incredibly quickly, and charades, since the Maximoffs’ pop culture had some pretty big gaps.  Tony always always won at Jenga, and Pepper could out-scrabble anyone. Natasha couldn’t be stopped at Clue, Steve and Rhodey alternated winning at Risk, and Wanda was so inscrutable that she could be holding a royal flush or a bunch of nonsense face cards and no one would ever know the difference.  Tony’s phone was in his pocket the whole night. A test.  If he got an email when he had an eye on Pieter, it wasn’t him. He wasn’t about to come out with it the way he had when he’d thought it was Steve.  He’d learned. But also, it wasn’t like he could just ask,
“Did we do this before?” Tony asked, hand tight around Steve’s cock, mouthing along his chest. “Did we do this in whatever space happened when I woke up in your bed? It just feels so familiar.”
“He knows you care, Tony.  He’d have to be an idiot not to know how much you care.”
“Please, Jarvis,” Steve entreated.
“Dude, aren’t you practically official with Natasha now? Cut the rest of us a break, man,” Rhodey griped at him.
“Glad you’re still alive,” she said casually.
Eventually, Tony opened his eyes. “Come on, sugar, make me feel it,” he said, voice hoarse.  Steve pulled Tony’s hips up, making him puff out a laugh. Tony urged him on, murmuring breathlessly, praising Steve, telling him how he’d ruined Tony for anyone else, how he loved Steve, how he was going to have to keep him now, forever, and Steve’s orgasm blindsided him, leaving him gasping, panting, the word
Tony flashed him a brilliant smile, brittle at the edges, putting his sunglasses back on. “I hope it was all you imagined it to be, Rogers.”
“Indeed, Captain.  He prefers to stay sober, now.  He has found it intensely helpful, and so has Ms. Potts. He finds that he uses his time more wisely and is less vulnerable to being taken advantage of when he is sober.”
Bucky went still.
Steve was unwilling to leave Tony alone, but he had to get the replacement.  “I’ll be right back,” he said, squeezing Tony’s hand. He raced downstairs, flung the rag off Dum-E, and seized the glowing cylinder, forgetting to hope that it was safe to touch. He sprinted back to the living room, snatching up the pair of pliers that were resting on the table.  Plucking the reactor out of Tony’s chest took all his courage, praying it didn’t hurt, talking to him the whole time. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart, please, just be okay, stay with me, it’ll be okay, you’ll be alright, sweetheart, please stay with me, don’t leave me—“ he detached a connector, holding his breath. God, this had better work.  He clipped in the new device, fitted it neatly into the cavity, and clutched Tony’s hands tightly.
He started working on taking the suit’s filtration and shrinking all the components down so it was portable, lightweight.  He didn’t know why he hadn’t thought of it earlier. He didn’t bother constructing a design yet.  Steve would come and help him with it.  Did he need the help? No, probably not. But Steve had a good eye for design and he liked helping out.  Tony liked having Steve around.  Win-win.  Besides, Tony was, when it came down to the engineering of things, more function than form.
“You should really be talking to Pepper, since she’s CEO now,” Tony was saying, bringing his tumbler to his mouth. He smiled, suddenly, brilliant and real, as Steve saw him realize his glass was now benign.  Steve felt a flash of pride.
“So, um, where’d you get this little guy?” Steve asked, as Tony ate his biryani.  He sort of liked that Tony was eating food he brought.  Sure, he hadn’t made it himself, but the caveman who seemed to lurk in his brain was immensely pleased that he’d in some way helped provide for Tony.
“Anyway, Mr. Stark,” Jemma continued, as if their momentary bickering was commonplace.  From what Tony had seen at the gala, it was. “We haven’t found a suitable replacement.  We tried looking at some other elements and compounds, but we haven’t narrowed it down yet. But it’s
Tony could see the intelligence, the determination, even in the tiny frame.  Like it was fighting to get out, just waiting for a body that could accommodate that much resolve.
Thumbs up emoji
When he thought he had everything complete, he left the soldering gun cooling on a side shelf and grabbed a powerbar.  How had he forgotten just how disgusting they were? Maybe it was his gloves, since they still wore streaks of white lithium.  He stripped them off and tried again. Nope. That was definitely just how powerbars tasted.  He’d been spoiled.
Steve paused when he was right in front of him. “Stop me if I’m wrong,” he said, low. And then he was kissing him—he, Steve Goddamn Rogers was kissing him, kissing Tony, this was amazing.  This was everything.  Tony leaned in to get a better angle, pulling on Steve’s lip with his teeth, hands dragging Steve’s hips toward his. This was better than he’d ever hoped. Tony was flying high on endorphins and the taste of Steve’s tongue in his mouth when suddenly, he realized, oh Jesus, wait, did he mean…?
Steve still doesn’t turn.  “I saw the news, Tony.”
Steve got to work cleaning him up, holding him securely in those broad, gentle hands. Soap and water first, then a soft cloth to dry him off, antiseptic, and two large bandaids.  Tony grinned defensively when Steve opened them and found his shield spangled across them.  “It was in a multi-pack,” he said.  “I’ve already used up all the Mjolnir ones.” It wasn’t, and he didn’t.  But nobody needed to know that.
“What about you?”
From: Brucie 10:43am
“Jesus, what’s that smell?” Sam asked, clearly trying to figure out why Hammer reeked so strongly of sandalwood.  Bruce looked a little green around the edges, but he had what Tony recognized as his blandest smile plastered across his face.
Tony reached up for him, caught his collar, dragged him down, Steve’s mouth soft, tasting vaguely of ash, Steve smelled of sweat and battle but he kissed him back, sweet, the relief of having won, the joy of a free sky, his tongue slipping between Tony’s lips—if this was the other side of dying, Tony would do it over and over again.  It was like he hadn’t truly understood kissing, chained in some Platonic cave, until he'd kissed Steve and stood outside, breathing the clean air, sun warming his face.
“Good point.  Hey, speaking of, how did he metabolize the powder? What was the differential between him, Thor, and Natasha?”
Steve’s pulse took off.  “Shit.”
“You’re all I want, Tony,” Steve said.
Tony’d had a little buzz going, a little liquid courage to get up the nerve to come clean to Steve.  Now it was completely gone.  He’d never felt so sober.  And cold. He walked back into the family room where the karaoke was still going strong, now Natasha belting out Cher’s “Do You Believe” and Sam trying his best to provide some kind of badly misguided back up dancing, Bruce shuffling awkwardly at the corner of the stage.  He ran right into Hammer.
Tony paused.  “That’s a good idea.  He’s already helped out with SI France.”  Rhodey’s eyebrows shot up comically high, making Tony snort.  “I’ll have him start working on it tomorrow.  Can’t hurt, right?”
“That’s no way to talk to your best friend, Tony!” Hammer called after him.  Prick.
Sam rolled his eyes.
“They’re not,” Pepper chimed in. “They’re really not.  The rules are the rules. The rules say the gift has to be handmade. No buying a pair of Jimmy Choos.” She looked hard at Tony.
“Tony?” Steve bit his lip.  “I’m sorry.  I know.” He looked away, over the river. His eyes were brilliant somehow, reflecting the moonlight mirrored in the river. “I know.  I’ll just.  But I didn’t want you to be here, waiting, thinking that I didn’t love you, too.  Because I do. Because you’re amazing--you are, you know? You’re amazing.” He rubbed his hand sheepishly on his thigh, looked down as if the ground had answers.  “And. And when you find someone you really want, he’s going to be so goddamn lucky.” He smiled at Tony, though it looked wrong on him, somehow.  Not a real smile. Not a Steve smile.  He took a step backward.  “Um.  Be careful getting home. Do you want me to call someone for you? Jim, or Pepper?” Steve turned, clearly uncertain if he should leave Tony alone in Central Park at midnight, but not wanting to overstep his bounds.
“Mr. Stark, I…” Steve started.  Then he stopped.  He had no idea how to finish that sentence.
“Hey, leave off him, Longhorn,” Tony said, irritably.  He wasn’t going to let Loki badger Steve. “Shift back, I already know I’m pretty.  Thor, get your brother under control, would you?”
“For being a drama queen? I mean, probably. She’s on her way back and you stink. When you’re showered, I’ve got news.  Good news.”
“Stevie, Stevie I’m a mess, man, I’m nothin, they didn’t want me and she left and I got nothin’ left, Stevie, I’m nothin’ I’m nothin’…”
“Like what you see?” Tony asked, voice low and suggestive.
“What. The hell.  Was that.” Pepper’s tone was ice.
“My best customer,” Mr. Morita smiled at him.  “What would I do without Tony Stark?”
“Why would she want to interview me?” Steve asked, completely serious.
“Steve,” he says, trying to put some of that in his tone, “I’m glad you called. It’s good to hear your voice.”
“Thank you, Jarvis.  I was just wondering, do you, er, did you, have a… background… in London? I don’t mean to assume anything, it’s just.  Your voice reminds me of a friend of mine. It’s probably silly.”
“Rhodey! You are a sight for sore eyes. No really, I mean it.  Actually, you look like shit.”
“So, I know you like numbers.  So I thought you might be interested to know that while the general population is about 10% gay, Shield High apparently only has two.  Gay.  Guys.”
In the other room, there was a thump and then a loud curse.
That wasn’t particularly exact.
(See the end of the chapter for

Ouch.
Sniveling little orange worm.  Tony was certain Stern was sorry.  He should have known better than going up against Howard’s son.  So Barnes was back on the list, just waiting for the VA to start procedures for their enhanced prosthetics. A little help with the funds on that probably wouldn’t hurt, either.  Get the program going, expand its capabilities.  The Maria Stark Foundation could ensure that the wait list wasn’t so exclusive going forward, could help more of the men and women who came back with injuries.
not a continuation of chapter 2. or 3.
Natasha looked up, intrigued, a hint of a smile starting.
Apparently, they
At seven, their phones beeped.  It was Clint.
PFCer: Half my unit is gone. And I watched it all happen.  Right off base, right in front of me.  And I was sick that day, couldn’t go on patrol.  Fucking stomach bug.  One minute I got my head in a fucking bucket, dumping my guts, and there’s an explosion, rocked the whole fucking camp.  I shoulda been on that patrol.
In the second image, Tony sat above Steve, perched on the counter.  It would have been a small matter for Steve to reach over, instead of rummaging around in the cabinet, and know exactly what command voice did to him.  He’d know just what Tony wanted, pushing a thick finger into his open mouth, slicking it up, parting Tony’s thighs with those ridiculous hands.
“Pietro, I’m your twin, and I still don’t have any idea what you’re saying either,” Wanda said.
Tony hit send, locked his phone, and unlocked his door.  Jarvis brought him supper. Tony played around with his microcircuits. What did this guy sound like? Did he have a deep voice? Or maybe a lighter tone? What did he look like? Shield High was pretty racially diverse.  Someone with family drama. Was he from a more conservative culture? Did they have to struggle to make it? An immigrant family? A senior. Maybe he was tall.  Maybe he was gorgeous and built ala Steve Rogers.  On the other hand, maybe he was a little weird, like that exchange student Stephen Strange.  Maybe he wasn’t white.  Maybe he was from a South Asian background. Was he Latino? Bronzed skin and darker hair than Tony’s? Tony tried to picture him, tried out different intonations, reading and re-reading the emails.  His phone stayed silent all night.
Everything Steve said today sounded like innuendo, and unfortunately, Tony couldn’t seem to keep his reactions in check.  He’d wanted Steve for months now, since they’d figured out after the Chitauri that they worked amazingly well together.  He’d realized that Steve wasn’t really a sanctimonious asshole, and Steve saw through his I’m-a-Stark cover. Somehow that stellar teamwork had turned their relationship upside down once he got to know the guy. Instead of Tony disobeying orders because he thought Steve was an idiot, he’d push back snippily because the other option was to come in his pants at Steve’s command voice.  And the suit wasn’t designed to handle that kind of cleanup on the regular. Now Steve was offering to let Tony pet the tiny kitten nestled between the powerful thighs of his very large lap.  As if that wasn’t where Tony himself wanted to be.  When he’d heard Steve picking up the kitten earlier, he’d had a brief moment where he thought Steve was referring to Tony as “baby” and he’d liked it.  Christ, he’d really liked it.  So much so that he’d forgotten that the door to the closet was still closed.  That was probably some sort of giant analogy for his life, but he was going to avoid analyzing that for the moment.
Wow.  I slipped up. I had to go back and re-read and find where I told you what grade I’m in.  I’m an idiot.  Yeah. Senior year.  I don’t know.  Maybe a superhero or something.  Like, Batman. I didn’t want to be him or anything, when I was growing up—actually, I could never be like him—but he was always my favorite. I used to come home and watch the cartoon with my best friend after school, and eat chocolate chip cookies.  My mom taught me how to make the most amazing chocolate chip cookies.  I haven’t made them in ages. But it’s probably too late to get a Batman costume at this point anyway. Besides, if I tell you, then you’ll know who I am.  I’m not sure I’m ready for that.
“Captain Rogers left it for you when you were in the shower, Sir.”
Tony checks the clock.  They’re almost out of time.
Pepper was already there, no surprise, and she’d picked up Bruce on the way.  Natasha was perched in an armchair, flipping index cards in some sort of fancy David Bowie-esque move. She gave Tony a significant look and slipped him a packet of papers to sign inside a slim black notebook.  Steve came out of the kitchen with a beautiful brunette.
I’m sure you can tell, my relationship with my dad isn’t great.  It’s been so long that I’ve basically given up on him.  The days when I don’t see him are good days.  But it’s been so many days, now. I think we talked before school started, but maybe not since then.  I stay out of his way, for the most part. And it’s good.  But sometimes I wish he’d yell at me, just so I’d know he was paying attention.  I know that sounds fucked up.  I know that *is* fucked up.
“I think that is an accurate estimate, sir.”
Tony kissed him, fiercely.  “You’re not dumb.” He kissed him again. “You’re really not even that much of a jock. I mean you run, but I think you just do that to piss off Wilson.” He kissed him again, longer, deeper.  “You’re smart, and kind, and funny, and hell, have you seen you? So don’t talk about my boyfriend that way.” He smiled, but it was tentative, and he knew it.  He couldn’t breathe out.  What if…?

“What are you supposed to be?” he asked Tony, looking over his boxy suit and fake moustache. “And what’s with the metal bagel on a stick?”
“Tony,” Steve says his name like a sigh, like an embrace, “he would be extraordinarily lucky to be like you.” He waits for a beat.  Then, he asks, because he has to, because someone has to, and he hates that it has to be him, Tony can hear the reluctance in his voice, “What about the Accords?”
So two out of five.  That wasn’t great odds.  How could he ask about another best friend or parents without being super awkward? On the other hand, Steve Goddamn Rogers---that was like Tony’s wet dream. Actually, it was one of his literal wet dreams, not that he felt like admitting it.  Do Not Think About That Dream. Tony refused to get a boner while Hammer was in the room.  Besides, he’d be mortified.  What if it wasn’t Steve?
Tony looks down at the bowl.  It’s alphabet, tiny letters of pasta swimming around.  He pokes at them, rearranging them into words, wishes he could unscramble his thoughts as easily. Steve’s watching him still.
“He tried to poison me, twice.  Just this week. Didn’t you? You did. You know you did.  One more time and I’m bringing you down to PS 24.  Those middle schoolers will love you,” Tony threatened, fondly, “and they’re sticky. Your gears won’t last a week.”
“Did I get drunk last night?” Tony asked, blinking in the sun.
He checked his email at 9am. He got to sleep in, his parents were gone, no one cared what he did, and he’d had a late night.
“Ahh, well,” Steve began, “yes, they are classified.” He swallowed.  Hard.
Natasha looked a little troubled. “I mean, we were dating. Before I moved.  We still are.  I just didn’t get to say goodbye, really.  It’s complicated. He’s actually from Brooklyn, originally.”
Tony pulled up the refugee camp blueprints again.  They were just about ready.  Maybe one printed copy, go over it with a fine tooth comb, get it into production immediately.  With Steve’s quick catch on Batroc, they really could start breaking ground on the wells next week.  And that meant construction could start on the refugee camps in Pakistan and Oman within the month.
Stark had been staring at his hand but he looked up at that. His face was still blank, and Steve still couldn’t see his eyes.  “Huh.”
Tony was still looking at him, the same affectionate crinkle around his eyes, sad somehow.
“Pity,” Loki sniffed.  He shimmered again, and suddenly there were two Tony Starks in the room, one lying tangled up and relatively unclothed in Steve’s bed. “I could look like him if that would help, it’s what your heart desires.”
“Very good, Sir.”
After the competition, which they lost by three points when Hammer grabbed the remote control from Bruce and navigated the robot squarely into a wall (Natasha didn't even
“Okay, call me back, I think I’m going to talk to Mr. Coulson tomorrow,” Pepper responded absently, probably already listing the requirements for how to start the charter for a new club.  A gay club.  A gay-straight alliance, knowing Pepper.
Tony had a second to hesitate. Should he be nervous, with a potential giant baddy whom he had basically invited into his house? This Barnes, even with one arm, still looked like he could be pretty brutal in a fight.  Inwardly, he cursed himself briefly for giving Happy the day off.  But the man was driving everyone crazy and he really needed to take a day off.  Still, he had everything on camera. Jarvis watched all and could alert the police at any instant, anyway. He was going to be fine.  Just fine.
Rhodey, Barnes, and Natasha were talking shop, Rhodey clearly impressed by the shot Barnes had made and still curious about what Natasha had used. They parted ways, Natasha winding her arm around Barnes and tucking her small hand into his back pocket.
.  He could feel another finger, stretching him, twisting, working deeper and wider.  And then another, and he couldn’t wait, he couldn’t hold everything he was feeling inside, the sensations bursting out of him, cracking open his chest, surging from his skin, “I love you, Tony,” he managed to say, nearly out of his mind.
“It’s better than not being with you,” Steve says.  He’s quiet. But he’s also pale.  And he’s lost a lot of blood. He leans up against a wall, trying to look casual.
Steve smiled.  No—he smirked! And just as quickly the expression was gone.
When he’d moved in, back after the Chitauri, he’d been amazed.  Tony’d winked, assuring him all the beds were that large.  In case of guests. They’d been in the phase of trying to settle in with each other, and Steve hadn’t been sure how to take that.  It was early enough in their relationship—friendship—that it was like a kick to the gut, thinking Tony was like Howard all over again, trying to needle him, thinking he was something of an idiot.  These days, he knew better.  Of course, now when he thought about that salacious wink it did something else entirely to him.
“Shit,” Tony said.  He’d forgotten about the arc reactor.  It was enough to scare off anyone.
Steve blushed, “It’s no big deal,” he started, but Sam jumped in for him.
He moved to get lube out of a drawer, then considered, looking the beautiful lines of Tony’s body, kneeling on the bed, eyes half mast and dreamy. He bent down, kissing him, then holding two fingers by his mouth. “Get me wet, love,” he said. Tony opened his mouth, suckling Steve’s fingers, running his tongue up and down. Steve watched for a moment, then moved back onto the bed, Tony releasing his fingers with a pop.  Steve looked down at the tiny furl of Tony’s hole, relaxed around the rim, but far too tight to accommodate him now.  He pushed his tongue back in, gentle but as deep as he could, making him wetter and looser.  He licked along the rim, stretching it, adding a finger and twisting, Tony shivering against him, gasping, asking for more.
“I can’t, Tony.  Sam says… Sam says I have to know when you won’t say what you need, when you put your needs aside.  And he’s right.  So I won’t come in there.  Not without some way for you to know you’re safe.”
Bruce quietly groaned, but under his breath.
His email lit up almost immediately.
Ok, I'm an idiot. I went back and found a thing and it interfered with continuity, so I fixed it.
Ugh. Tony was done with that conversation for today.  He narrowed his eyes at Steve as he said, “Yeah, J, go ahead and find Rogers a room. Tell Pep I’m good on PAs for a while. Have her send someone over to get whatever Rogers needs from wherever it is he lives. Give him the tour.”
-Flying”
Breakfast was normal, except that Tony stole Steve’s bacon and rested his hand on Steve’s thigh for the entire meal.  Sam caught a glimpse of that hand, but he just nodded to himself, in seeming approval. The team went their separate ways after helping load the dishwasher.  Steve made another pot of coffee, like he usually did, since Tony drank coffee throughout the day. This time, Tony stayed with him in the kitchen sitting on the counter, sneaking him kisses whenever Steve came close enough to reach. Steve finally gave up.  No one would come to harm.  He had a day. He’d take the kisses while he could.
“So you’re saying you, what, let him get his hands on a stash of iridium?” Tony snapped, clearly irritated.  “Didn’t think he’d be able to break Coulomb, even though he’s already done it once? J, wake up everyone else!”
“I love me a man who can cook,” Sam said, yoking his arm around Steve’s neck.  Then he rapped his knuckles on Steve’s head.  “But we all know it ain’t you—this is all Abe, man.”
Tony shot a knowing look at the kid. Playing on Cap’s guilt at stealing the kid away from his aunt.  Sure enough, Steve’s gaze softened.  “Sure, Pete. Of course you can.” He turned back to the oven to pull out the bacon, missing Peter stick his tongue out at Tony in triumph.
“Tony?”
Tony made a funny choking noise.  Probably laughing at him.  Tony loved teasing Steve about being a prude, which he wasn’t.  Hell, if Tony could only hear the things Steve wished he could do to him.
“Of course, Captain Rogers,” Jarvis replied, completely seriously, for all Steve could tell.
“Nah,” Steve said, scratching the kitten behind his ears.  “You got him all wet is all.” Dear god, would this day never end? “I mean, with the bath.”
He walked back into the bedroom, this time opening the windows to let fresh air in.  He startled a bluejay that was sitting outside the window and it squawked at him, disgruntled, while he shook Bucky’s shoulder.
As they pulled into the driveway, Tony watched Steve closely as Steve seemed to memorize the way their hands looked.  Tentatively, he reached out his hand to Steve’s face, lightly ran the tips of his fingers down his smooth cheek, electricity sparking at his fingertips and warming him entirely. This was what it felt like to be burning alive and want no relief. He dragged his fingers to the corner of Steve’s mouth, gently pulling Steve to him, slowly, softly, aching in every cell for Steve to turn and kiss him, to want him, to choose him.
“Why, Tony, do you not want to stay up with me? I can show you how Asgardians call it a night,” Thor rumbled suggestively.
Barnes grinned, offering a fist in return. “It was only an airsoft, sir, no reason for him t’be bawlin’ like that.”
“Steve,” Tony said, maybe a little gently. He felt for the guy, after all.  “Go get cleaned up.  If you’re awake after that, come down to my office.  If not, there’s no emergency. Get some rest.” Whatever this guy’s deal was, Tony wasn’t going to make it any worse.
I definitely saw that Discovery movie—I don’t think there’s anyone left who hasn’t.  But isn’t that astronaut sort of a jerk? He seemed way too hot-headed. I mean, if you like astronauts, what about that one in the sci fi movie, where they’re going to restart the sun?  He’s fictional, but it fits in with your Wonder Woman thing better, about doing the right thing.  He definitely stands for the greater good, and making sure things are done right, even at his own expense. If you haven’t seen it, you should look it up.
Steve had called him
Steve holds out his wrists, still resting his head on his knees where he’s sitting on the landing platform.  Tony fastens the cuffs around him. He’s gentle.  He can’t help himself. He helps Steve up, hearing the strain it takes him to breathe.  They get to the workshop and Steve slumps back on a bench.  His eyes hold an apology, but he doesn’t have the breath to say it.
“Ok, Jarvis.  Could you send that photo to Mr. Stark? I need to bring him an update.”
At Steve Rogers.
“I didn’t have the right recipe?” Steve asked, guilelessly. “The internet is amazing, but it has so many recipes, it’s hard to figure out which one to use.”
“Valorous conduct.  Weren’t a lot of details, but from what I could put together, he spent a lot of his time in Afghanistan running around and rescuing people.  He led a small joint command—international forces, did a lot of good. Ended up specializing in rescuing hostages.  His whole team got targets basically painted on their backs, they were so good. It all ended when his buddy got hit on a patrol Rogers was leading.  Most of them got out okay, but he lost a few men, and his sniper lost an arm. Rogers ended up doing some field medical on him and carrying him and a local nearly five clicks to safety.” Rhodes paused. “Looked a little like a setup, maybe. Or bad intel.  Not Rogers’s fault.  Not that
Steve looked at her, confused.  Him? If this was going to be another one of those mandatory summons from another planet, he was going to be irritated.  Why couldn’t they just come at a reasonable hour, was all he asked, instead of—he looked at the clock—4:13 in the morning.  Tony looked like he might have been asleep for once, instead of finishing up the ultraglass formula.  Thor—well, he was unpredictable.  Sometimes he liked to hang out on the roof, flipping Mjolnir and singing ballads to the moon.
“And when you’ve settled, you can clean up this mess,” he said, indicating the shards of red and green glass covering the floor.  He turned and went back down to his workshop, flipping on the ACDC as he went.  Even if Steve was pretty, Tony had more important things to deal with. Things that wouldn’t talk back.
Rhodey side-eyed him hard.  “Uh-huh.  Had to make it weird.  Besides, she’s been hanging pretty close to Steve.”
they weren’t talking face to face, where Tony knew he tended to be flippant, and slick, and smart.  Where he never let anyone see how he might be vulnerable.  Sure, yes, his closest friends knew, but it had taken a long time to get to that point.  He’d grown up with Pepper and Rhodey since they were all in matching diapers.
Steve’s lips twisted. That was not a smile.  Hm.  Well, Tony had long practice at being more than what he appeared.  They ate in mostly silence, but it wasn’t awkward. It was actually somewhat comfortable.  Steve wasn’t sure what it said about it him that this was comfortable.  But it was. Even when Tony teased him about the salt and pepper dip he made for his fries.  He thought Mr. Stark might just have been trying to put him at ease, since he had a faint, pleased smile when Steve grudgingly laughed.
Steve smiles faintly. “I’ll try.”
“Weird,” Tony said.  “Do you like your room? You need new sheets, you know that?” He huffed a breath.  “Nice view, though.  Skyline looks great from this side. I gave you the best view, but don’t tell Thor.  It only encourages him.” He stretched. “Well.  I should get back to my own room.  Thanks for the crashpad, Rogers.”
He wandered up to his room, brushed his teeth, took a quick shower—scrubbing Hammer off of him.  He settled into bed, grabbed his laptop, and opened his email.
Steve suppressed the urge to roll his eyes.  Well, score one more for Mr. Stark, then.  But still, he had a job to do.  An $850,000 job.
Tony leaned up to kiss him, swiping his current screen to the side and off the projection table.
really cool,” Jim said. “You must be crazy smart.”
“Goodbye Pepper, Mr. Happy,” Steve called to their rapidly disappearing figures.
Tony groaned.  “It’s so stupid that we have to be on one team. Shield High is big enough for two teams and then I wouldn’t have to—”
.  He picked up the cap from where she’d tossed it, schooling his face into a friendly, flippant demeanor before he turned back to her.  “Going to get me a date with another Mets fan?” he asked, grin clear in his voice.
“Medal of Honor? What for?” Tony conveniently didn’t answer the last question.
But still clothed.
“That was fun, Tony, thanks,” Steve remarked afterward. “It’s like chess, in a way; you can think through the whole board.”
“Flying, I get what you’re saying about not wanting to disappoint, or complicate. I don’t really feel that way about my dad, but my mom is already—” Tony broke off.  How did he say it? It wasn’t that she didn’t care. She did. He was sure of it.  But she wasn’t strong. It’s like she wasn’t strong enough to handle Howard and love Tony, too.  She only had enough for one of them.  And in a way, handling Howard was part of loving Tony, part of being his mother.  She’d talked his way out of several beatings.  After the first grade yearbook photo, she made sure Howard didn’t find the stain on his new shirt.  Sure, she took it to Jarvis, but that was her way.  She loved him.  And he didn’t want to give Flying the impression that she didn’t.  So: “my mom is already taking on a lot.  I don’t want to make her do more, either.  So yeah, I see exactly what you mean.
“No, I just think, it’s been good.  But it’s run its course, right? Let’s just, kit-kat it.  Right? Before one of us gets bored. I mean, trial run, right?” Tony was so glad his voice sounded normal. Bored even.  He snuck a glance at Steve.
Rhodey was still grinning when the waitress came back with the to-go bag.
She shrugged, coyly, sorting her tater tots by what seemed to be size and relative crispiness.  “Not sure.  Big decision, first Halloween in a new place.  Why, what do you want me to be?”
Natasha touched his shoulder lightly. “Don’t do that to yourself, Tony. I know you wouldn’t have.  And besides, I can take care of myself.” He looked up at her.  She looked thoughtful. Calculating. “Okay.  So, we have to make sure I’m flirty, just a little, slow.  Play it like an ice queen opening up, so he’s never frustrated and always thinks he’s making progress.”
Tony breathed a sigh of relief, his whole body relaxing.  He knew he’d been keyed up, but he didn’t realize how much he didn’t want Flying to be Rumlow until he was sure it wasn’t.
“Sorry,” Steve stammered, guiltily.  “I’m sorry, Tony, he was just, and I couldn’t, you looked so… Jarvis, did you, um…”
“Yes, and he’s young, he needs training, he needs protection. But the suit also kept him safe.”
She smiled a little.  “He is sort of the worst. But I’m not looking to start dating someone.  I have a boyfriend.”
A ping went off on Tony’s screen and he looked back at Steve with that warm, quiet smile.  “Nat’s waiting for you in the gym.”
He was, if it was possible, more distant in this session than in the previous ones.  He wondered if she would tell Coulson.  He wondered if he should care.
Tony pulled into the garage.  He turned to look at Steve.  Steve was still looking at his hands, playing with the metal chain on his wrist. He looked defeated.
After that, every night was the same, long after Tony told him to stop asking if he could stay, he’d already got his toothbrush in Tony’s cup and most of his clothes were in the dresser anyway. He wrapped Tony up, kissed him.  Tony slept the night through.
Coulson disappeared after introducing Tony Stark, but whatever he hoped to get out of the meetinng, Steve was pretty sure it wasn’t this.  Stark never even took off his sunglasses, flashy red-lensed things that hid his eyes, masked his gaze.  He turned those lenses on Steve, looking him over, expressionless.
Stane’s jaw dropped.
“Why did you take his side?” Tony demands, finally.
Tony tackled him, pulling his shirt open, kissing those pink lips, trying to say, “Me too” without removing his tongue from Steve’s mouth. Steve staggered backward and Tony just went with it, climbed up so he was clinging to Steve, trying to eliminate any space between them.  Finally Steve just picked him up, one of those giant, glorious hands supporting Tony’s ass.  Tony gave a very dignified squeak and used the opportunity to shimmy a little closer, now that he knew that the gift in Steve’s pants was really for him and not the product of magic, although it sort of felt magical to him at the moment.
“Did you make those changes to my blueprints?”
“I know you always put us first, Tony, but you should relax tonight.  You’ve earned it,” Steve told him earnestly.  “I’ll help you sketch it out tomorrow if you want.  I mean, I know it’s not a lot of help to do it the archaic way, but anything I can do.”
“Not so wise as that.  I still.  If I get only a day.  I would want to be able to show Tony how much I love him.” It tore him apart to say it out loud.  He’d only ever admitted it to Sam, and then obliquely, and he struggled, every day, to keep it hidden.  He was cautious at team meetings.  He purposely spread his attention to the rest of the Avengers so Tony didn’t notice the way Steve’s eyes tracked him, how he glowed when Tony praised him, how he tried so hard to be the person Tony expected him to be. Sometimes, when Tony worked on a piece of his uniform or equipment, he’d let Steve come down with him to the workshop so he could get immediate feedback on the changes.  It didn’t matter what Steve was supposed to have going on that day—he’d blown off a meeting with Fury in favor of talking about parachutes.
“I was wondering when you were going to notice me,” he said, sulkily.  He wasn’t actually upset, though.  Steve hadn’t let go of his hand.  His blue eyes kept drifting toward the reactor, seeming to be comforted by the constancy.
“Steve, please,” Tony said, voice just on the edge of pleading.
“As you wish, Captain.  I will take the liberty of turning on
Steve sent Peggy a look, then said, “Long story. No big deal.”
Tony was lying on his bed, fiddling with a panel of resistors.  Just before Thanksgiving break, Natasha had edited Hammer’s English paper for him.  Of course, she’d also taken a look at Tony’s, adding a number of snarky notes on his analysis of “Daddy Issues in
Bucky raised an eyebrow, catching something in his tone. “Jesus.  You’re in love with the guy.”
Tony thought back.  He did remember seeing a new girl, flipping off a wolf-whistler across the cafeteria.  “Oh, right, totally. She’s super hot,” he tried to gush.  “That, um, that accent, that’s really…” he trailed off.
Oh god.  He knew that smug, oily voice. The voice that told a warlord to kill Tony.  He’d heard it say “m’boy” before, not even a full day ago. That was Obadiah Stane.
Of course, Pepper arrived first, carrying a pumpkin pie.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony continued staring at the little graphic. Yes, he had seen that before.  On a filing cabinet right in that basement where Barnes had been digging around.  Of course. Jesus, how had he been such an idiot?  And what was in those goddamn files?
“I don’t know, Tony.  What kind of experience are you offering?” Natasha asked, her voice sultry.
“Get it!” Sam added again, jostling Peggy with his shoulder.
“It’s just cranberry sauce,” Steve said, blushing a little.  “It’s an old German recipe, so it’s kind of different.  It has dried cherries in it, and it’s basically good on everything.”
“So guys, hypothetical: Luke Skywalker turns evil and a superhero has to take him down.  Who’s it going to be?”
Tony closed his mouth.  Maybe Rogers was putting them all up to this, in return for the other day when Tony had Rickrolled him.
Natasha grinned back, all teeth.  “A lot.”
— their fighting styles fit together like two pieces of a puzzle. Their teamwork is fluid, seamless in a way Tony has never experienced.
It’s a selfish wish, he knows. Strange saved him for a reason, said it was the only way, but Tony has been trying to make his life count since the day Yinsen died for him in that cave, and no matter what he’s done, no matter what he’s accomplished, it’s all been for nothing.
No. Rewind. Reverse.
It would’ve been a mercy.
“Build the Jericho.”
Right now, in his arms, is a chance.
“Captain.” God, and that makes his shoulders tense. He turns his head, meeting eyes with one of the Dora, her gaze unflinching but weighted. Not for the first time, Steve wonders how these people can have so much strength in the aftermath.
He's trying, he really is, to wrap his head around it but there's just no understanding. Half of the universe is gone, over half the team is gone, Bucky's gone and
, only slightly smaller than her in her arms.
It was naive to assume anything had changed.
She’s yelling at him, he can tell. He sees her mouth, blue and so strange moving at a rapid pace, teeth bared and furious. There’s grief plain and simple painted across her features, but he can’t bring himself to care.
That’s how old Peter is. Was.
None of it’s fair.
“Tony,” and it’s a voice that makes him shiver, a timbre that reaches
fuels him to fight faster, harder.
At one point you flatline, but you laugh it off as if it’s nothing.
Right here, in his arms, is Tony.
That’s Steve’s hand in his hair, stroking his greasy curls back with a delicate sort of pressure, a gentle sort of strength, the feeling of fingertips against his hairline soothing the tension that’s crawled into his frame.
None of it makes sense.
His lungs feel like they’re filled with water.
Tony feels himself nod but the motion feels detached, like his head is full of cotton, Nebula’s voice sounding far away and more artificial than usual. With his right hand, he fumbles for his stab wound, squeezing until he feels blood start to coat the pads of his fingers.
In lieu of speaking, Steve just nods, getting to his feet with military precision. He feels like he’s made of glass, like he’s glued together— more fragile than he’s ever been.
Suddenly, the blue lady’s mouth snaps shut with a mechanical click, her features smoothing out. She places a hand on his chest and he can feel it, in the recesses of his mind— can feel the way her fingers probe what’s left of his armor, can feel when she finds the cauterized edge of the stab wound Thanos had placed there only minutes before.
Not for the first time, Tony wishes that he could pay for his sins with money.
. The racoon keeps moving even after Steve draws himself and the others to a halt, holding his ground. The creature scrambles up towards where a drawbridge is lowering towards the clearing, creaking and groaning from the weight, making contact with the earth with a low thud.
He’d thought it’d sting, that it’d burn, that it’d tear him apart from the inside out.
For lying, for Siberia, for abandoning the team. He never got to say sorry.
Your sternum would ache too, but that was removed a few months ago.
The voice is breathless, panting and frantic like whoever’s speaking just ran a mile or five. There are hands on him, then— searching and insistent. They’re on his wrist, pressing against the skin of his side and
But, well.
“I’ve seen the footage,” Steve says, and a smarter man probably would’ve taken a step back, would’ve yielded to the war hero that brought Hydra to its knees.
This was the endgame, and now Bucky was ash at his feet and Wakanda was kingless.
Anthony takes his first breath and the universe
So many mistakes. They’d made so many mistakes, and this was the price.
There’s the barest of shifts, the slightest sound of linen against linen and Steve is holding his breath again, staring at Tony for any signs of him resurfacing once more. A moment, then another, and he lets the tension drain out of his body.
He’s twelve when he learns how to finally fight back.
That is, if he wants to survive.
There’s a buzz, a whistle. A bomb with his name on it.
It'd been so easy, before.
She’s shaking like a leaf, her teeth chattering. It’s probably shock but Tony can’t comfort her, can’t offer her any of his warmth because he hasn’t got any left to give.
Time ticks by and then Yinsen’s voice is in his ear, rasping out his final words and Tony
He’s aware of a presence at his back, the blue woman he saw earlier. She had been looking for someone— Gamora? But she hadn’t been with the others. Tony wonders absently if she’d turned to dust like the rest or if she had met a more gruesome fate. He supposes it doesn't matter now. What's done is done.
When Tony was seventeen, his parents broke like porcelain on a backwoods road, leaving behind broken bones and bloody steering wheels.

Rock bottom indeed.
Distantly, Tony understands that his stab wound is infected. He’ll probably become septic soon, if he hasn’t already. He doesn’t tell Nebula, doubts that she’ll understand anyway with her mechanical parts and lack of an immune system.
The lights are bright even behind his eyelids, sharp and sterile. Tony screws his eyes further shut, scrunching his face and trying to shift in what he assumes is a hospital bed. He braces himself, takes stock of his body.
