Sherlock didn’t look up. He wasn’t surprised that John was the one who came looking for him. He knew his other colleagues wouldn’t dare.
“Oh, thank you,” the man said with brief hesitation and stood up from his desk.
Holly looked at her computer screen. “Appointments until 12, and two house visits after that. Mr. Miller called this morning to ask if you could drop by to retake a look at Stephen. His coughing doesn’t seem to get better. And Mrs. Kennard threw her back out again. Oh, and there’s already someone waiting for you in the waiting room, but he doesn’t have an appointment. I told him you have back to back appointments, but he didn’t mind waiting. There you go,” she handed John his schedule on paper.
“What do you mean?”
He looked down at his feet, wrapping his mind around the words he wanted to say to Sherlock. He wanted to comfort him, to let him know his secret was safe with him. When John looked up again, he saw a defensive look on Sherlock’s face.
“Shut up.”
The truth felt like a punch in the gut, like a hit in his chest. The words didn’t make sense. In the last two years, every scenario had crossed John’s mind. But in the end, he always assumed that Sherlock had killed himself – or faked his death – for selfish purposes, not to save others.
In the mean time, enjoy John’s epiphany! 💕
First of all, thank you for the kudos and the comments! It's my fuel so please keep responding! :)
When Mycroft entered the room, he saw that Sherlock was staring at the ceiling. He was tapping the fingers of his free hand impatiently against the mattress. “Don’t worry; your next dosage will be here soon.”
When John and Maggie entered Sherlock’s room again, they went to their places right away. Sherlock sat cross-legged on the bed and was fidgeting with the corner of the duvet. He felt nervous. He didn’t look at John. He couldn’t. If he wanted to do this, he needed to focus.
Donovan narrowed her eyes. “That must’ve hurt. It looks like someone got in a good punch.”
But Mycroft didn’t move. He was hesitating. John realised this brought back memories for Mycroft, ones he clearly had tried to push away profoundly. And now, he was fighting them. “Do you want me to go in first?” John asked carefully.
John looked up. Mycroft stood before him, handing him a disposable cup of tea. he took the cup and waited for Mycroft to sit next to him.
Sherlock closed his eyes. “Believe me, I know.”
“And you have been looking better yourself, brother mine,” Mycroft commented while he sat down in the chair next Sherlock’s bed.
In the middle, there was a tall man dressed up in a fancy suit. He gave John a crooked smile. “Have a seat, John,” he said as he pointed at the chair.
"I can't help it that you’ve got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning, but some cooperation would be nice!"
“Maybe not, but it is what it is,” Sherlock answered, trying to sound impassive. “Shouldn’t we get going?”
“Why don’t you let me try to talk to him?” he tried.
“That’s because he does. At least, if you want him to be.”
I’ve always been sceptical when it comes to my little brother and relationships. Not because I think he’s doesn’t deserve one, but because I don’t want to see him getting hurt. I’ve been trying to protect him from it - told him he doesn’t need one, that he’s better off alone, that caring is not an advantage… but seeing him like this makes me believe I was wrong.
“Moriarty was going to kill Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, and you. He had a sniper directed on you, and he would pull the trigger If they didn’t see that you were convinced of my death. That’s why I couldn’t tell you. It had to be real for you.”
From the moment Sherlock and John were able to leave the hospital, the tension was palpable. They had stepped into the car in silence; both men didn’t spare a glance towards the other. John took out his phone and Sherlock turned himself towards the window. He was twisting and bending his wrist absent-mindedly, wholly caught in his thoughts.
Oh no. John realised that he hadn’t told Mrs. Hudson about his divorce with Mary. How could he possibly tell her everything that had happened without hurting her? He let out a sigh and braced himself a little, his face serious. “Mrs Hudson, I need to tell you some, but you need to promise me to let me finish, okay?”
He sighed. This meant he had to check most of the previous work from the students to see what they had done on Friday and that he didn’t know if there were any problems or things he was supposed to know about. He looked at the clock, If he wanted to finish preparing everything before the students arrived, he better had to hurry.
“So Rosie isn’t the one who kept me awake the last couple of days,” John continued. “Mycroft came to see me last week. At first, I thought they had found his body, that everything would finally be over. But that was not the case.” John swallowed and looked back at his cup; his hands trembling slightly. He took a breath. “Sherlock is back. He is in a private hospital here in London.”
John pulled back for a moment, taking in the man opposite him. He took a deep breath and continued. “Did I ever tell you that you were the one who saved me? When I met you, I mean. You were the main reason I recovered after Afghanistan. Ella did a great job, but it was you who helped the most. Please, let me do the same for you.”
Sherlock huffed dismissively. “I’m very well capable of taking care of my own mental state. I don’t feel the need to talk to some know-it-all shrink who will just poke around inside my memories let me do all the cleaning up afterwards.”
After another knock on the door, Sherlock got up and opened it with a swing, already opening his mouth to do some yelling. But when he got sight of John actually standing there, his voice was nowhere to be found. All he could do was stare. The view of John Watson standing there, looking incredibly hot with his slightly tousled hair and his stormy blue eyes, was enough to stop his tracks.
If I can find the courage.
“I’m fine dear,” Mrs Hudson replied and gave Sherlock a warm smile. “You are in an incredibly good mood lately.”
Sherlock turned around, opened the door and walked back in the classroom, leaving John standing flabbergasted in the hallway, unable to respond.
“In his mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, he’d probably say his archenemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
He tried to keep his own breathing as secure as possible. After a couple of long minutes, John heard Sherlock’s breathing grew a little more steady. Little by little, he seemed to come back from it, and John was relieved. It looked like the tide finally was turning.
John regretted the words immediately and tried to adopt a more friendly tone. “You know you can tell me anything, right?” He paused a moment to take a breath. “You can trust me,” he added.
Anthea stood there, holding an umbrella above her head. John knew what it meant right away. She came to deliver a message from Mycroft Holmes. His death notice, probably.
John decided he stared down the street long enough. He walked back to his apartment and was unable to hide his smile. He knew Harry would notice it too and he wouldn’t hear the end of it, so he took a minute to compose himself. He briefly thought about asking Sherlock to come over tonight, but that would mean he would have to introduce him to Harry. And he really didn’t want to do that, not yet anyway. He would have to wait until Harry was out of town to see Sherlock again if he wanted to keep him a secret a little while longer.
“Yeah,” John just answered. He walked towards the bed. “How are you feeling?”
“Come on, dear, let me make you some tea,” Mrs Hudson said and gave him a knowing smile. John returned her smile. God, he loved that woman.
“You know your body can’t handle the stress right now. Come on, take a break.”
Sherlock looked up, surprised. “You think so?”
John looked around. “Bit different from my day,” he said, turning on his heels to take in the whole classroom.
“Yeah,” Lestrade sighed.
“No way!” Molly exclaimed and looked at John with big eyes and a smile on her face.
“John?” Harry started, her voice warmer than before.
I immediately realize there has been a shift in their dynamics.
John sighed and decided it wasn’t worth the effort. He had, in fact, counted the class before they had started the P.E. lesson and had noted the absent ones. Besides, it wasn’t his responsibility.
“You are not fine, otherwise you wouldn’t be on a gurney on your way to the hospital!”
After a long afternoon of discussing students and looking through files, John was happy to be home. He had decided not to do anything else tonight but to eat the fish and chips he bought from the local shop on the corner of the street, drink a beer or two and watch a movie.
“Yes, fine,” Sherlock answered dismissively. “I will be there in an hour.”
“I’m not saying you are, but maybe you like both…”
The woman looked down and smiled shyly. “It wasn’t working for me.”
“Are you sure you gave the right address?” I ask, a little frustrated.
John noticed he started to lose his patience. There must be something they could do to convince Sherlock, something they could say.
“Are you coming inside or do you want to stay hovering on my doorstep?” John asked and stepped aside as an invitation.
“Listen,” I start. “I know what’s going on, and I hate to break it to you, but I think you’re jealous. I saw you looking at them; you think he should be with you instead of giving Donovan his attention.”
John turned around to face Alice again and closed his eyes for a second to keep his nerves under control. When he heard the click of the door falling shut, he opened his eyes again. “Okay, Alice, it’s just you and me now. Let’s get you out of this.” And with that, he started to check what he was dealing with.
But he couldn’t say it, not yet. “Because you’re important,” he answered instead.
“Sherlock, did someone say something that caused this?” John tried, but there was no response whatsoever. That was not it, then. He sniffed, maybe it was the smell of something that triggered this. But he couldn’t smell anything. Food then? No, he had his last meal when John was still there. His eyes darted the room, but he couldn’t discover anything new.
Luckily Greg does, nods, and takes over the suspect so I can take off. I run as fast as I can and try to get my phone simultaneously, so I have a bit of light. Within seconds, I swing open the office door and feel my heart sink.
Suddenly, Sherlock was aware of the tears that were burning behind his eyes. It was hard to talk about this, but he had to. He had to give John an explanation.
“And I think It just vaporized,” Sherlock said with a grin on his face. “May I go in now?”
Lestrade sighed. “That’s not the point. You are under my supervision, and I want to see you in those meetings so I can keep an eye on you. You can start to cooperate, and I’ll stand down.”
Sherlock hesitated for a moment. “Almost,” he answered and looked down at his hands, clearly disappointed in himself.
The next couple of days went by in peace. Doctor Wilson had decided that Sherlock no longer needed to stay at the ICU and had ordered to remove the catheter, drains and feeding tube. Sherlock was now back in his old room and feeling better every day. The detox was going fine, and he didn’t have much withdrawal symptoms. He even had talked to his psychiatrist and agreed on a treatment plan to start the EMDR sessions.
When they ended their walk around the building, they stopped a classroom with a closed door. “This,” Mike started with a goofy grin on his face. “Will be your office, your workplace and your playground for the upcoming school year. Welcome.” John chuckled, and Mike opened the door to the classroom.
Her face looked puzzled for a moment. “Will you come back to Baker street when Sherlock’s feeling better?”
“Actually,” John started and reached for Sherlock’s hand. When Sherlock looked up, he gave him a warm smile. “That sounds perfect.”
John sighed. He was grateful that the PE lessons wouldn’t start until next week. That way, he had a week to get to know his class first and still had enough time to prepare his upcoming PE lessons. If he was totally honest with himself, those were the lessons he was most nervous about. He had to teach other classes as well, classes he didn’t know at all. And even though he always had been a sportsman, he wasn’t sure if he was fit enough to provide the lessons he wanted to teach.
Sherlock gave her a look. “Because we ran into each other.”
John finally looked up at Greg. “He refuses treatment.”
Clearly, Sally was enjoying herself. “Why?”
John entered the familiar hallway and gave a sideways glance. Something unsettling grew inside of his stomach. He sighed and lingered behind Mrs Hudson. If he had known then what he knew now, he would not have given up his lease. He wouldn’t have left. He would have stayed, waiting for him. The regret he felt was almost overwhelming.
“Oh nonsense, you just want to go on your date.”
After a moment, the car started driving. John looked out of the window to see where he was going, but it was no use. He briefly wondered who this mysterious person he was about to meet could be, but he couldn’t come up with an answer. Clearly, it was someone who knew Sherlock and who knew John had a connection with him, but he didn’t get any further than that.
"Nothing happened."
Sherlock scoffed. “Even you should be able to figure this out, but I can see the holiday didn’t do anything beneficial for your deductive skills” he snarled. John opened his mouth to argue, but Sherlock spoke before he got the chance. “You should’ve asked me if it was okay to go on a holiday, instead of rushing off with the GP.”
“Dr Watson, Mycroft spoke deliberately. “My brother was held hostage for months. They found significant traces of gamma-hydroxybutyrate in his blood. He was tortured, physically and mentally. It was my idea to send him to Eastern Europe. And you are saying it’s not my fault?”
John shook his head and shifted his attention to his phone, but he couldn’t quite suppress his smile. He took a second to think about the right thing to say. Then, he started texting.
John didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. Sherlock already knew he was. He waited a moment for John to speak up, but when it was clear the doctor wasn’t going to, he started his deduction.
“No problem, dear. I will stay close, just in case. If you need to check what the situation is, I can watch your class. Whatever you need.”
Sherlock shifted under his sheets to face Mycroft, but John still wasn’t able to see his face. “Didn’t you hear me? Get out,” he said again.
John waited for a response but didn't get any. "You heard mister Holmes. If he's stable, continue the surgery as initially planned."
First of all: I'm so sorry for the delay! A lot happened and I didn't have the time to sit down and write a proper chapter for you guys... But don't worry, I'm back! And on the plus side, I started to plan out the rest of the story, so I expect to update more frequently now!
John stared at Mycroft, not able to get a word out of his mouth. Was he Sherlock’s medical proxy? Why? How? He didn’t sign anything, did he?
The silence hung between them, both men unable to find the right words. John had expected himself to panic, but the opposite was true. He almost felt serene,  because he knew all along that his feelings weren’t something he had made up as a way to cope with his loss.
After seconds, I can’t take it anymore. “You don’t have to—”
“No, I took some days off,” John simply answered.  Sorry, I meant to text you.”
I lean back and watch with satisfaction how Sherlock eats the last of his desert. The evening has been incredible; delicious food paired with some excellent wine complementing the courses perfectly, the atmosphere between us relaxed, maybe flirty even.
I’d always known that John would be a fantastic lover, but in reality, it’s so much better. Every touch, every lick, and every kiss he gives me is with so much care that he makes me feel things I’ve never experienced before. On the contrary to what Mycroft believes, I do have some comparable data, so I know that this is something else entirely.
“Yes, John, do keep up.”
"Sir, I don't think you are making the right decision," the resident started impatiently. "Taking out the complete spleen will be quicker, and the patient can live without…"
He didn’t. Instead, Mycroft looked through the pile of files, took one of them opened it. He took a glance at it. John observed him, but he couldn’t read the expression on Mycroft’s face. He knew the file was a medical report, Sherlock’s medical report. That meant that Sherlock was hurt.
“Are you going to?” John dared.
John shook his head. “You really want to bypass his wishes?”
“I believe in co-operative teaching, and I am a perfectionist who makes his lessons as often as possible. Would that bother you? Potential partners should know the worst about each other.” The man gave John a fake smile.
. ” Mrs Hudson repeated.
“Yeah, John, listen,” Lestrade began, and John knew what was coming. “I know it’s none of my business, but you don’t fool me. I know when someone is punched in the face when I see it. What happened? Did Sherlock did this?”
Sherlock shrugged. “What can I say? I’m just happy we have next week off. Love to chat, but I have a class to prepare. Coffee in half an hour, John!” With that, Sherlock dashed through the doors, leaving John standing in the middle of the hallway.
And I?
The head of the figure behind the desk snapped up and eyed him with interest. John walked towards the man and reached him his phone.
Eventually, Sherlock pushed away ever so slightly. “John,” he panted, his voice low and husky. He let his forehead rest against John’s and smiled against John’s lips. “Would you like to get upstairs, so I can kiss you the way I want to kiss you? So I can kiss you where I want to kiss you… Do more than just kiss you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft took hold of his umbrella and stood up straight. “Nothing I can’t handle, but yes.”
“I know.”
“Hold on,” John said before Sherlock could leave the supply closet. “You care about me?”
John wanted to answer, but the boy who sat next to Jenny was ahead of him. “Yes, that would be so cool!”
Sherlock snorted. “Absolutely not.”
I sigh and suddenly feel the urge to tell him. “You’re right, it did.”
When Sherlock finished throwing up, he lay down again, his knees raised to his chest. He clenched his unhurt arm around his stomach. His face showed a pained expression.
“I understand why you don’t tell people. Parents not only prefer someone who isn’t an addict, but they also prefer someone who doesn’t have psychological issues. Believe me, I know.”
“Uh oh, here we go again,” John heard Molly mumble softly.
Merry Christmas everyone!
John just shrugged in answer and took another sip of his coffee. He watched how Mike grabbed his phone out of his pocket and started to text. “You know,” he began, not looking up from his phone. “There is a last-minute opening at our school. Part-time, year 4. You would be perfect. I texted the principal to see If you can come by today.
The class started cheering and clapping, and John couldn’t help but smile at the surprised look on Sherlock’s face. He clearly didn’t anticipate this turn of events, and John couldn’t help but feel a little smug with himself.
Mrs Hudson chuckled a bit. “He sure would be, but I’d hate to see him get overworked. He’s an excellent teacher and such a good man.”
John felt the sudden urge to text Sherlock to see if he was already awake, but when he grabbed his phone, he stopped himself. The last thing he wanted was to come across as a stalker. After all, it was only early in the morning, and he would see Sherlock in an hour anyway.
' John took a couple of deep breaths. He felt his body relax a little. For a couple of seconds, he stood there, his hands resting on his face covering his eyes. He knew he had to get back to Mycroft. He took one last breath and walked back to his office, feeling a little bit more steady.
“We heard the alarm and wanted to go downstairs, but Alice tripped and fell and hit her head against the table,” Kyle said quickly.
All of a sudden, the dance doesn’t seem that bad.
“Why would I get my own coffee if I know you are going to take a refill anyway?”
“You need to see things from a different angle. Donovan isn’t trying to steal him away from you; she’s trying to help. We all are. Go back inside; I’m sure everything will be fine. You just need to be a little braver.”
He looked over at John, who was looking at his phone and was typing. Sherlock wanted to ask who he was texting but hesitated. A year ago he would give John a smart-aleck comment about it, but somehow he didn’t know if it was his place to say something about it. He continued to look out if the window instead.
Mycroft nodded in answer, and John sighed. He saw Sherlock lunging forward, and was just in time to take a spit bucked so he could throw up. John flinched slightly. He knew this was only the beginning. Withdrawal from GHB could take weeks.
I know been keeping the bathroom occupied for nearly two hours, but I can’t seem to make myself move. I just stare at my reflection in the mirror, just like I’ve been doing for the past thirty minutes. By now, I can see every wrinkle, every pore and every blemish in my face. My curls aren’t tamed enough, my lips are patchy, and I can see the fatigue around my eyes.
So now, Sherlock wanted a cigarette. If he was candid with himself, he maybe even wanted something else, but since that wasn’t an option anymore, he wanted a smoke. And he was going to in three minutes because that meant it was a quarter to eight and that the time Sherlock had given John to show up, was up.
Sherlock didn’t reply immediately. “Oh, I… I don’t drink.”
They were close now, very close. John could feel Sherlock’s unsteady breath against his own. He let his gaze linger down for a moment and licked his lips. “You know that you can be rather thick for someone who claims to be a genius, don’t you?” he whispered. And with that, he closed the small gap between them.
“I think we ought to have a say in who’s on our staff and who’s not,” Mary interjected. “If you want us to work together, that is.”
Once inside, John dropped off the stuff and walked to his classroom. To his surprise, the class was working on their new history project. Sherlock was helping a small group at the end of the classroom. John wanted to knock but decided against it. It was also his class, after all.
Doctor Wilson started to write some things down. “Pharmaceutical GHB it is. Now the last thing I wanted to discuss is his mental state. I like to suggest talking to a psychiatrist and to start with EMDR treatment as soon as possible if we want to treat his PTSD.”
“Sherlock, I warn you. I will call Mycroft.”
They were silent during the ride; an occasional glance made them both blush. Their hands were next to each other, nearly touching, but neither one of them dared to reach out to the other.
is what he wanted to say, what laid on the tip of his tongue.
“As far as first gifts go, I know it isn’t much. But I hope you’ll accept it as a token of my feelings for you.” I try to ignore the hammering in my chest and suck in a breath. “I love you, and I’m going to do what I can to make sure you don’t have to question it ever again.”
John’s head snapped up. He tried to make himself as tall as he could. He knew he had to give orders like in the army.
“You think I don’t know that?!” Sherlock suddenly bellowed. "You think I don't know they're tired up; being kicked and punched and God knows what else until there isn't a single spot on their bodies that doesn't hurt? That I don't know what it's like to be screaming in pain, pushing until you've reached your breaking point? Praying you won't wake up after another blow to your head or hoping your body would just give up under the severity of your injuries? How it feels to stop having hope when you don't dare think of ways to escape because you have no clue what you'd do if you actually succeeded?"
“Listen, John,” Mycroft started. “I understand why you think you want to know what happened. I could tell you the things I know if you really want to. But I do think you shouldn’t hear it from me. Sherlock will tell you when he feels he can. In fact, I think he’s already telling you things he wouldn’t tell anyone else.”
“So, tell me about him. What’s he like? Where did you meet? What does he look like? I want to know what type of men my little brother likes!”
John cleared his throat before Sherlock could answer. "That would be me."
Opening the cabinet under the sink, John found an old towel. He folded it and put it loosely around Alice’s mouth and nose. It wasn’t the best solution, but it had to do. He scooped one arm under her shoulders and one arm under her knees and picked her up in one swift move. She was a bit heavier than he anticipated, but nothing he couldn’t carry.
monthly report. They were always the same. No change. No sign of him. No word. Nothing.
He looks absolutely stunning.
“I can’t do this.”
Sherlock gave him a lop-sided smile. “Of sorts.”
“Shut up,” John hissed through clenched teeth. He desperately tried to keep his anger under control. “Do you have any idea why he was gone? What happened?”
And then he saw it too.
I can guess why.
“What was there to misunderstand? I’m pretty sure the schedule I sent you was as clear as it could be otherwise the other two years would’ve made the same mistake. I even reminded you in yesterday’s note.”
The principal grinned. “I’m sure that’s not true. I’m Greg Lestrade. Have a seat, John.”
On the other hand, it was just dinner; not a classical concert or something. Would that have been better? John knew Sherlock liked classical music, so would going to a concert be a better fit? What if dinner was too casual, too ordinary for Sherlock? John wanted this to be the perfect date, not some dime-in-a-dozen date which he could have with anybody. Maybe he should step up his game, think of something more romantic. A gift, perhaps, or flowers. But that would be something he would do when he went out on a date with a woman.
“No. End of discussion. If you put him in a coma, so he doesn’t have to experience the withdrawal symptoms, he will relapse. He needs to feel this, needs to know what it’s like.”
Soon, the whole class started to try to convince John and was yelling arguments on why John had to join them. John tried to get the students quiet again, but it was a lost cause.
John didn’t bother to give her a proper goodbye. He stood up straight in his military posture, turned around and walked towards the door with firm steps.
“When I was in Mitrovica, I had a companion,” Sherlock said softly, not moving from John’s lap. He felt how John’s hand briefly stilled and how his body tensed before he continued stroking through the thick curls. Sherlock took a deep breath and continued. “His name was Visar, or that’s what he told me at least. He was already undercover for two months before I arrived and knew I wasn’t who I claimed to be within a week. We teamed up and decided to exchange information.”
“Sherlock,” John started and tried to get his laughter under control. He took a deep breath. That’s Harry!” he explained, still with a broad smile on his face and waited until the penny dropped. But Sherlock just stood there with big, questioning eyes.
“I’m done giving up,” Sherlock said, sounding determined all of a sudden. ”I want to fight this. I just don’t know how, and it’s driving me insane.”
“Yes, I think so.”
John grabbed Sherlock’s hand to keep him from walking any further. “Please, stop walking. You know I can’t keep up with you right now. Let me explain.”
Every night started the same. They lay down together, a decent amount of distance between them. John read some articles from one of the medical journals he had bought, and Sherlock just lay down on his back, staring at the ceiling. The first time he did that, John had wanted to ask what he was thinking about if everything was alright. But when he cast Sherlock a glance, he saw him drifting off slowly with a small smile on his face, completely relaxed. With Sherlock gone, John turned the lights off and went to sleep as well, only to wake up the next morning with the detective firmly pressed against him.
Way too soon, he breaks off the kiss.
The paramedics wheeled John inside the ambulance, and the doors closed, leaving Sherlock standing there nailed to the ground. Lestrade came to stand next to him and watched how the ambulance drove off.
,” John snapped, strolling towards Mycroft with a threatening look in his eyes.
He watched how John raised an eyebrow. “You want me to ask Lestrade to give you cases? Are you sure?”
It was a cold and rainy day, but Sherlock didn’t care. The moment he was wheeled outside the hospital felt like he was set free. He stood up from the wheelchair Mycroft had insisted on using to get him outside and breathed in deeply. He was finally going home.
Mrs Hudson laughed. “You really have quite an influence on him, John. I’ve never seen him like this.”
“You were fine this morning, so something happened in the hospital, probably during the removal of my cast. Dr. Wilson has scolded you, perhaps because she thinks I’m lying about my progress or because she thinks you are not giving me the proper care. Possibly both.”
After a long moment, Mycroft spoke. “Are you sure you want to know?” he asked John. His voice sounded calm, almost sympathetic.
Once he had accepted there was nothing he could do about the text in the middle of the night, his mind went in overdrive with worrying about Sherlock. John knew he was starting to lose the little control he had. Small cracks were beginning to appear in Sherlock’s façade, and it would be a matter of time before the detective had to give into it. He was fighting a battle with himself, and he would lose either way. And the worst part was that there was nothing John could do to help. The only thing he could do was to be there for him and to support him in any way he needed, which didn’t feel enough at all.
Sherlock was about to walk away when Philip Anderson arrived. His face hardened by the sight of Sherlock and John. Sherlock turned around to face the man, his face completely blank. John stepped a little closer to meet his other colleague as well.
They held their gaze for a long time. But then, John realised who was sitting opposite of him. His colleague, not his date.
With a loud thump, Sherlock let himself fall on the floor. John would come after him like he used to and make a desperate attempt to lighten the situation. But Sherlock didn’t allow himself to listen to him. He shut himself off from everything else around him, took one of the files and started to focus on the case entirely.
And with that, John walked towards his office, ready to start his workday.
a volatile flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture used as a fuel especially for internal combustion engines and usually blended from several products of natural gas and petroleum
Anderson snorted. “Yeah, right,” he muttered.
“Why?”
“You know, Harry?” John continued. “My sister? The one who gave me my phone?”
Sherlock went silent. John wasn’t coming back to work yet, which meant something was wrong. He wouldn’t call in sick if it weren’t absolutely necessary. John loved his job too much for that.
Doctor Wilson let out a frustrated sigh and looked at Mycroft sharply. “I thought I was the one in charge of your brother, Mycroft.”
“Your deodorant told me that,” Sherlock said, matter-of-factly.
“I’ll get the next round,” John said abruptly in the hope that no one would notice the blush on his cheeks. Molly and Mike didn’t even look up when he walked away, but he was sure that he saw a grin on Sherlock’s face.
John let out a small chuckle. “How did you know?”
"Oh Jesus," he exhaled softly. He let go of Sherlock's shoulder and kneeled in front of the man. Sherlock opened his eyes by the touch of John's hand on his knee, but he didn't look up.
Happy (belated) Newyear!
On Wednesday, John had to teach P.E. to the 4th, 5thand 6thyears. He had decided to start this year by introducing some new games and sports to the students and because of the beautiful weather that week he had scheduled an outdoor lesson so they could play softball.
“Right, okay,” John started, trying to sound reassuring, but failing miserably. “You’re unattached, just like me. Fine. Good,” he muttered and looked away.
“How can you tell him to be strong if you can’t do the same thing?”
“John, don’t!” he heard behind him and faintly registered that it was Sherlock who was yelling, but it didn’t stop him.
Oh dear... my first attempt to write a Sherlock Fic (I know, i'm a little late to the party)! Little nervous about it, though...
Mike laughed and clapped John on his shoulder. “Yes, he did. And on top of that, he told McKenzie to mind his own business so John here could finish his damn internship. It was fantastic. I’ve never seen McKenzie acting that polite towards anybody ever again. And mind you, this was only in year two!”
“Take a look at this,” John said after a couple of minutes and held out a piece of paper, which appeared to be a photo. Sherlock took, looked at it… and froze. There was a man in the picture, on his knees, his arms tight behind his back, bruises clearly visible. His back was turned towards the camera, and his head hung low. He was held gunpoint.
It felt like a punch in the gut. Though Sherlock didn’t want to believe he was capable of hitting John, he knew it was true. He could recall the moment he woke up from his nightmare. He didn’t know what had woken him exactly, but he knew there had been a shout that wasn’t his own. It made sense.
Lestrade was the first who dared to speak. He cleared his throat. “Sherlock, I’m glad you decided to join the meeting as well.” He looked from Sherlock to John and back. “John was telling us about the blog project you have running in your class. John?”
When Sherlock and John arrived at the crime scene, Sherlock still hadn’t spoken a word. He walked straight inside and ignored John completely. John walked after him but stayed behind. He was reluctant to go inside, knowing he would only stand in the way when Sherlock was like this. He spotted Lestrade and Donovan and decided it would be best to check what they had found instead of going inside.
But John knew it wasn’t a drill. Otherwise, he would know about it. Suddenly, he started to worry about his own class. What if they got stuck somewhere? What if Sherlock couldn’t get out in time? He took a deep breath and pushed the thoughts out of his head. He had the responsibility to get these kids outside. His own class would come later.
“Dr Watson, you don’t get to…” spoke one of the doctors hesitantly.
That’s when Sherlock swore he would never let go of John Watson ever again.
After being stuck at the Yard to help Lestrade with his newest case, I’m starving, and even Sherlock looks hungry. “Come on; there’s a good Chinese just around the corner,” he proposes. Before I can answer, he’s already walking.
Uh oh, Big Brother is watching you!
Soon after John moved from 221B Bakerstreet to the small coastal village, he found work as a doctor. The local practice offered him enough distraction. There weren't many unusual cases, but he didn't care. He needed rest and being on his own. And that was precisely what Fairlight Cove could offer him.
Principal Lestrade smiled at him. “I think your partner is somewhere around the school. If you want, I can ask Mike to give you a tour and to introduce him to you. I would do it myself, but I have a meeting in 10 minutes. Let’s meet again on Thursday so we can discuss the details and I’ll ask our receptionist Sally to sort out the paperwork so you can read it at home, okay?”
And with that, he closed the door.
Now that they were settled, John got the chance to take a good look at Sherlock. Of course, the man looked incredible in his tailored suit jacket and aubergine-coloured shirt, but that wasn’t what got John’s attention. He noticed the tightness in Sherlock’s posture, the tension in his jaw. Something was off.
The note Mycroft told him about this afternoon laid on the side table next to him, visibly damaged. John wasn’t sure he wanted to read it. He hardly couldn’t bring himself to it. He felt numb; his head was too full. No new information could be added. He was too tired to think. Yet he knew there was no escaping it. His curiosity would eventually beat the resistance.
Before anyone could agree, Sherlock stood up from his chair and stormed out of the staff room. John didn’t think for a second and walked after him, hoping to catch up before he walked out of the school. At the end of the corridor, he succeeded. He took Sherlock by the arm and pulled him inside the nearest room he could find, which was the supply closet full of craft stuff, papers and stationary. John closed the door and pushed Sherlock against the wall with more force than intended, but he didn’t care.
"Good. Now let's get you up and walking, shall we? Swing your legs to one side of the bed and sit up straight. Don't get up on your own; I will help you."
He simply nods, takes a sip from his beer and takes a moment to overlook the crowd. It allows me to take a good look at him before my eyes fall on an old tie pin.
“In a way, he reminded me of you. We protected each other and took care of each other in the best way we could. But of course, they found out he was a spy a month and a half after I met him. That was the first time I saw what they were capable of. They captured him and tortured him. Ultimately, they decided to kill him. They had noticed we started to become close, so they…”
Which in this case, is probably for the best.
He made his decision, turned and started running.
“Harry!”
It felt like the ground was swept away beneath John’s feet. He couldn’t have heard this right, could he?
John looked up from his thoughts and saw Sherlock standing in the door opening. He was dressed in pyjama pants, a navy blue t-shirt and a new dressing gown which looked a lot like the ones he had before. Another thing that almost looked the same as it did before, but wasn’t.
“Who is he?”
John just huffed in response. He could have seen this coming. At least Sherlock had arranged that Molly would accompany him, so he didn’t need to organise any last-minute things, but still.
Sherlock turned his head to look up at John and swallowed. “It was you… Instead of Visar. That’s what I was dreaming last night.”
Sherlock finally looked defeated and gave a small nod. Lestrade started walking out of the classroom. On his way out, he stopped at John’s side, who was looking at the ground and patted him on his shoulder. “Keep an eye on him, will you?” Lestrade said to him softly. John just nodded in answer.
Mycroft ignored his brother and started to explain. "He passed out and got sick afterwards. We had to stop the session."
“I’m sorry,” John spoke eventually and let go of Sherlock’s gaze. “I shouldn’t have gone on holiday, and I shouldn’t have left you on your own to deal with the aftermath.” He cleared his throat and shifted his seat slightly. “For what it’s worth, though, I didn’t particularly enjoy my trip.”
He was exhausted. Discussing students was always a lot of work, especially when you didn’t know them at all. He had a lot of catching up to do. But that wasn’t the thing that had exhausted him the most.
“I know.”
John didn’t speak for a long time. A rush of realisation hit him. He knew the answer. Of course, he knew.
Sherlock nodded. “I’m starting to believe he was wrong, though.” With that, he had decided he told John enough and started to walk away.
"Let him go," John commanded right away.
“Are you alright, Mr John? We thought you were sick!”
The panic took over John's thinking. “I… I know. But… I can’t. You should be the one making the decisions, not me. I don’t know what he wants; I know nothing. I’m just a friend…"
“Okay, Alice,” John said softly. “I think it’s time for us to get out of here.”
“You can’t blame Sherlock for last year. It wasn’t his fault,” Molly said with a slight tremble in her voice. “Not completely,” she added.
“No, I’m not.”
John didn’t listen. He was fighting a battle with his own emotions and was losing it. He couldn’t deal with them; he wanted to run, to escape, to hide. Tearing himself from Sherlock’s grip, John let out a growl and swung his fist.
After a couple of minutes, Mike joined him with two large cups of coffee. John took a large sip. “Are you still teaching, then?”
called after John entered the building to say the situation has changed, so they are prepared.”
“Because you deserve the best date possible.” John paused for a second, deciding if he dared to be a little suggestive. His eyes darkened a little, and he licked his lips. He bent forward a little before he continued in a low voice. “Plus, I’m hoping that, if I do my best, you will invite me back to your place by the end of this evening.”
“Fibers of some kind,” Sherlock said quickly. He eyed John for a moment, hoping John would get the message to not mention the photo. “Probably from an item of clothes the kidnapper wore when he got inside.”
John sat up straight in his chair and took a moment to reflect upon what Dr. Wilson was saying. How dare she suggest that he wasn’t able to see what was going on? That he didn’t act as a doctor when it came to Sherlock? That he was jeopardizing Sherlock’s health?  He tightened his fists to keep his anger under control. “That’s quite an accusation you are making, especially when you don’t know what he’s like and what he needs. Believe me; I’m doing the best I can.”
When I get up, John isn’t there. I try to ignore the unsettling feeling in the pit of my stomach; he’s probably just out for some grocery shopping, but the feeling creeps up on me nonetheless.
“Would you like to try? With me?”
Sherlock didn’t answer. His shoulders were hunched forward, hands in the pockets of his coat and his head hang low. “Hello, John,” he mumbled.
“Sherlock,” John warned, but it was no use. He knew Sherlock was probably right to question the thoroughness of the investigation Lestrade and his team had done, but he also knew it would mean Sherlock wouldn’t stop digging for a connection until he had found it.
“Sorry, not really,” I apologise and can feel myself blush.
He quickly walked over to Mike, who was also complete, before walking back to the other side of the building to find Lestrade and Sarah looking at the burning building.
John just looked at Mrs Hudson in astonishment. What on earth was she talking about? And then, he remembered. The note. Sherlock had put his name on the lease too. A small shiver ran through his spine. The thought of him being back with Sherlock at their beloved apartment was just too much. It was something he could only hope for. And then again, he realised that it would probably be a bad idea. There were just too many memories behind those doors.
There was a tall, slender, dark-haired man sitting behind the desk. When Mike and John entered, the man gave them a sideways glance briefly before returning his attention to the notes in front of him.
John noticed Sherlock was shaking a little and felt a bit guilty. Sherlock had been scared, and this was his way to let it all out. He couldn’t blame him. If the roles were reversed, he would probably have stormed right after the man into the burning building as well.
And suddenly, an idea comes to mind.
“I said, leave!”
“We could go to Angelo’s?” Sherlock tried carefully after a moment of silence.
Second, I'm not entirely happy about this chapter. But I really wanted to write something for you guys. You have been patient and waited long enough.
John was glad Mike was the first to give his reaction. “I think it’s a great idea! I’m sure my students would love it.”
When he arrived at the door that went to the staircase, he kneeled to check if he could open the door safely. He placed the back of his hand against the top and sides of the door to check for heat. Luckily, the door didn’t feel hot. He leaned with his shoulder against the door and opened it slowly. The moment he got through the door, he started running up the stairs to the second floor and checked the next door, he came across just to be save. After that, he rushed to the classroom where he had seen the students.
John smiled back at the woman. “I’m sure he would be capable.”
Once at the hospital, John hurried down the corridors. There was no sign of the hustle and bustle that dominated the hospital during the day. He hardly met anyone, and in the rare case that he did, the person was introverted and quiet.
“There’s nothing to explain, John,” Sherlock replied and jerked his hand free. “You like her, it’s obvious. Now please let me leave before I humiliate myself some more.”
,” he mumbled softly.
John just looked at the detective for a long moment, unable to decide what to do. A part of him knew that he shouldn’t give in to it; that he shouldn’t give Sherlock what he wanted. But then again, John also knew the man was right. The faster they’d solve the case; the faster John could make sure Sherlock would strengthen.
At this, Sherlock looked up. Two stormy blue eyes met him, and his heart skipped a beat. “Yes,” he managed to whisper.
John tried to regain his composure and cleared his throat. “Morning,” he said softly, trying to keep his voice under control.
“Please, look at me,” John urged. After a moment of hesitation, Sherlock looked up into John’s dark blue eyes. His heart skipped a beat. Their eyes locked onto each other, and Sherlock relaxed a bit. He had missed those eyes. He had missed the look John gave him like nothing there was nothing else in the world. Even though everything pretended to be the same but felt completely different, this feeling he got when he looked into those eyes was the one thing that hadn’t changed.
When they arrived at the helicopter, John and Mycroft quickly walked up the metal stairs, put on their seatbelts and put their headset on. Mycroft gave some instructions to the pilot, and in no time, they were on their way to London.
And suddenly, Sherlock realized that that was it. That was what was wrong about the statement John had given him earlier. He hadn’t told Sherlock he wasn’t gay; he had told him they were not a couple, which was odd because John wasn’t the type of man who didn’t consider his words, not when he was making something obvious. And when you’ve eliminated the impossible whatever remained, however improbable, must be the truth, so… Could it be that John had thought what it would be like if he and Sherlock were together, and that it didn’t put him off?
John looked at the man. “You want to declare him medical incompetent? Sherlock?” He laughed hollowly. “I don’t think he will ever be incapable of making his own decisions, even if he is psychotic.”
John stared at his phone. He had four missed calls, two text messages, and one voicemail, all from the same number. When he tried to call back, no one picked up. He quickly sent a text message with an apology and sighed.
Without further ado: here's a new chapter!
John swallowed, a rush of nerves ran through his own body. He suddenly had an idea of what was coming. He knew what Sherlock was going on about. The letter. How was he supposed to react? He couldn’t say he knew because than Sherlock would know he kept it from him. But he also couldn’t act surprised. The only right response was to come clean about his own feelings. “Of course,” he managed to say, his voice a lot more strained than before.
“I do. You are in this position because of me.”
This only got Sherlock angrier. “Don’t tell me to lower my voice! You deserve a lot more yelling! You are a complete and utter idiot, John Watson. You know, when I got out of bed this morning I didn’t plan on almost losing someone I lo-,” Sherlock stopped abruptly, realising what he was about to say. His eyes went wide with shock. “Like. I mean like. As a friend, that is,” he mumbled in a desperate attempt to compose himself, but he knew John had heard him loud and clear by the look on his face.
Sherlock waved it away casually. “Just a small misunderstanding, John.”
So as I’m lying next to you, I make a promise. I’m going to make sure you know that I’m in this for as long as you want me to. I just need to be convincing.
Mycroft saw how his words pierced through the façade Sherlock was trying to hold up. Sherlock's body tensed some more; a slight shiver ran through his spine. He pressed his eyes shut.
John felt his heart ache a little. He knelt on the floor and put his hands on the shoulders of the boy and girl opposite him. “Of course we’re not mad. You did the right thing.” He gave them a small, reassuring smile before he continued. “Where’s Alice now?”
The cab ride to the train station was slightly shorter than anticipated, which meant John had some time to spare before he would pick up Sherlock. He had walked up to the platform together with Harry. She had wanted him to go so he would be in time for his date, but John insisted on a proper goodbye. When they arrived, Harry’s train was already there. After a quick exchange of promises (John said he would visit her around Christmas; Harry promised to call him more often), they did something they rarely did: they hugged each other.
“What hurts?”
“I said no. Goodbye, Anthea.”
John just looked at Mycroft, bewildered. He didn’t know how to reply.
She grins. “Always, boss.”
The woman snorted. “Principal Lestrade is expecting you. His office is at the end of the hallway to your left.”
John glanced sideways at Sherlock. “Something else you deduced?”
Lestrade opened the door of the apartment without knocking. “Here are all the files Austin and Brandon worked on together. There weren’t many cases, but maybe you’ll find something we didn’t.”
“No,” John tried to interrupt.
He looked at his watch and sighed. If the girl behind the bar didn't hurry, he would be late for his application. Not that he was confident about it. He had six applications last summer and got rejected all six times. He could handle a seventh, but at least this time, he had had a decent cup of coffee instead of the dirty coffee they served at most of the schools.
“You want to go to the fundraiser? With me?”
The sound of John’s voice was enough to stop Sherlock’s train of thoughts and get him back to the issue at hand. “That’s not what this is about,” He finally answered, his voice softer and more vulnerable than he liked, and for a moment, he thought he had betrayed himself.
When John arrived back at the table though, Sherlock was nowhere to be found. He immediately knew something was wrong.
"Doctor Wilson started a laparoscopic splenectomy with anterior approach. Everything went as expected, but when we identified the splenic artery, the patient started bleeding profusely. Doctor Wilson is prepping for an open splenectomy as we speak, but requested your approval before proceeding."
“I know you need some time, but I’d like to have dinner together,” he whispers and places a kiss on the top of my head.
“God, yes.”
He did not listen to Mycroft. Instead, John walked to the door, opened it, and gestured him to go. “Leave Mycroft, now before I will throw you out. I know what you are going to tell me. I’ve been around your brother long enough; I am able to
“When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock, one learns to be discreet. Your ankle must be hurting you. Please, sit down.”
John didn’t miss the hesitation in Sherlock’s voice and realised he hadn’t seen Sherlock drink during dinner as well. He couldn’t help himself but wonder if this was just something he didn’t do, or if there was something more behind it.
A few seconds later, Lestrade and Mrs Hudson slowly walked into Sherlock’s room. Sherlock’s eyes grew big. John saw this, placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and gave it a reassuring squeeze. “It’s okay,” he said softly.
“You should,” Sherlock said softly after a long moment. “This is hurting you.”
Sherlock could hear the smile on John’s face, which was enough to let some of the fear fade away. He realised that it was all because of John. This man was the reason he was able to go home again, and for a moment, he hesitated to tell John everything. To tell him how he felt, to tell him about what he wanted to say when he had to leave him, to tell him about the letter. But Sherlock composed himself almost immediately. Now was not the time nor the place. Besides, it was too risky.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, at least, not with words. He shrugs nonchalantly, but the faint blush on his cheeks tells me he’s just trying to act cool.
“Why?”
The knock on the door pulled both men back in reality. Lestrade came in without waiting for an answer. He looked ravished. His hair was a complete mess, and he had dark circles under his eyes, his face severe and tensed. John was alert at once. This couldn’t mean much good.
“I know.”
Halfway up, John felt his phone buzzing in his hand. With a sinking feeling, he opened the text and read it.
John waited a moment before walking to the nurse's station. "Do you want me to leave too?" he asked hesitantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not even Mycroft?”
“Oh,” was all he managed to say.
John came to stand next to him, and Sherlock felt a light hand on his shoulder. “Ready?”
“All right,” Harry said as she propped up on her elbows, “I have one more question for you, the most important one. How good is this new lover between the sheets?”
John sighed and thought for a moment. He would be lying if he told himself he didn’t want Sherlock to be here. It would be nice to get to know him a bit more, see him in a different environment. And perhaps Molly was right; maybe he just needed to unwind a bit.
I sip my coffee and let my eyes take in John’s form left of me. He sits at the kitchen table with the newspaper in one hand and his spoon in the other, eating his cereal and reading at the same time. A smile tugs at the corners of my mouth at the sight of him, so relax, so content.
"Is everything all right?" John asked. He got no response. Sherlock didn't move, and Mycroft just looked at his brother awaiting a reply.
“Until Wednesday, unfortunately.”
They were about to walk out of John’s bedroom when John stopped for a final check in the mirror. His eyes roamed over his face. He still looked a bit tired, and his hair showed a little more grey than he wanted. Maybe it would be better to change his shirt, after all. The greyish-green shirt did bring out his eyes, but it didn’t match as well with his shoes as he had hoped. Or maybe his whole outfit was too casual. He should wear a suit, make this a more formal occasion.
The car that John and Mycroft had picked up from the London Heliport stopped just outside the centre of London in a sophisticated neighbourhood with impressive, chic mansions. There was a long line of trees on both sides of the street, all coloured in beautiful autumn colours. Mycroft climbed the stairs of a white, stately building, and John followed. He looked for the name of the building on the facade, but he couldn’t find it.
“At your new school? That’s going to be a challenge.” Harry couldn’t keep her concern out of her voice.
John was taken aback for a moment. How did Sherlock know that? Had Mycroft told him? But John realised soon enough that this was Sherlock Holmes, the man who could deduce a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb. Of course, he knew. He shrugged. "I can help you settle and help you for a couple of weeks. And Mycroft can help as well, if necessary."
He realised it was the first time he was alone since Mycroft had picked him up, apart from the brief moment in his hotel room yesterday when he had read Sherlock’s note. And all of a sudden, he felt exhausted. It felt like his world was upside down again, and he wasn’t able to control it.
“Dr. Watson, can I give you a piece of advice?” Dr. Wilson asked, her tone deliberate. She put her elbows on her desk and stapled her fingers under her chin. Something in her posture reminded John of Mycroft.  “From one doctor to another?”
“Noted,” Mike answered and tried to put away his grin, but failed miserably.  John rolled his eyes and followed him to the teachers’ room.
John got an answer almost immediately.
John eyed at him for a long moment, failing to answer. Then, he looked at Mike again, but he didn’t seem to want to comment. “Afghanistan,” John responded finally. “Sorry, how did you…”
Sherlock waved it away. “Please, John, I don’t need a babysitter.”
“I’ll ask,” John said while he stood up from his chair and put on his coat. “Sherlock, would you mind if I go back to my hotel afterwards instead of dropping by?”
And then, like a bolt out of the blue, it clicked. They had found him. Not his body,
“What? I know you! You want to know what you’re dealing with. So spill the tea, how’s the sex?”
On Thursday, Sherlock had wanted to visit John. He had walked to his apartment, almost walked up to his door, but hesitated. What had he been thinking? He couldn’t just knock on John’s door now, could he? He owed John an explanation. Maybe he could ignore the whole thing, act as nothing had happened. Or he could pass it on the crisis, could tell him that he hadn’t been thinking straight. Then they could dismiss it as if it hadn’t been a big deal, laugh about it and continued their friendship.
Kyle let out a sigh and made up his mind. “Okay,” he said with a firm nod. “Let’s go Charly.”
“All right then,” he called after he noted the absentees. “Let’s start with a brief warming-up. After that, we are going to divide the class into different teams which will compete in an old-fashioned game of basketball.”
“Okay, and what do we do?” John asked.
And for the first time, John allowed himself to feel the impact. Everything he had heard Sherlock tell the other day fell on him like a heavy weight. He felt the pain; he felt the sorrow. But most of all, he felt injustice.
John gave the man opposite a lop-sided smile. “Can’t you deduce it?”
It was no use. Sherlock stirred and turned, but he couldn’t keep his mind from racing. First, he thought about last night, his nightmare still easy to recall. He had been back in Mitrovica, where he had been standing with a man kneeling before him. The man had his back turned to him. Sherlock had held a gun in his hand and knew he had to shoot the man… It wasn’t as much of a nightmare than a memory, and he knew he had to tell John about it eventually.
“He’s alive,” John started, his eyes on his mug instead of the inspector. “Sherlock. They found him.”
The look on Sherlock’s face almost made John feel a little guilty about his harsh approach, but he did his best not to dwell on it. This wasn’t about being careful with Sherlock’s emotions or making things right between them. This was about confiscating the truth, nothing less, and definitely nothing more.
After finishing his dinner, John sank onto his couch with his second beer of tonight in his hand. He took the remote and started searching for a good movie on his television. Just when he found one, he heard the doorbell rang. Sighing, he stood up. He was not in the mood for company.
But before I got the chance to do something with that information, they decided I had to see what the business was like first-hand.”
He suddenly wondered how Sherlock would prepare the start of the new school year. Surely he wouldn’t be nervous, the man was confident enough to know what he was capable of and had done this before. But then again, maybe the things that had happened last year would be cause for a little nervousness after all.
John snorted in response but took the cup anyway. “You could get your own coffee, you know?” he said while he turned his back to fill the two cups.
“I’d like to walk the last bit.”
John looked around again and smiled a little. He walked towards the middle and sat down between the books and papers. “It’s okay. I just didn’t think you’d like to work like this.”
John sat on his knees and looked more closely at the girl in front of him and tried to recall what he had learned during his first-aid course. He knew he had to check her breathing and pulse regularly, and that he had to check for other injuries.
Sherlock sighed. He knew he had to tell John what was going on in his head eventually, might as well do it while he still felt angry about it to get it off his chest. “You went away.”
Lestrade nodded. “One of the victims was kidnapped. We have reasons to believe he is torturing them.”
At first, Sherlock had the hope John would reach out to him to let him know he was okay. But as the days went by, Sherlock lost his confidence. On Wednesday, he got angry with John. Because what kind of decent human being wouldn’t let his friend know how he was doing after a crisis like that? But Sherlock had reminded himself once again that he probably had scared John off.
“Yes,” John spoke to attract the attention back to himself. “As I was telling, the students are really invested in the project. That’s because I let them decide what they want to do. I didn’t divide the tasks, they did. I don’t come up with the subjects, they do. This way, they really get the feeling it’s their own project instead of something I told them to do.” John heard Sherlock huff. He looked at him briefly and raised his eyebrow, but when Sherlock didn’t speak up, he continued. “Of course, this project takes a lot of time. But I tried to combine other subjects with this project. For instance, I changed the assignment they have to do for their typing course, so they have time to write up some of their articles.  And a big bonus is the fact they have the chance to develop their social-, organisational-, and planning skills with this project.”
You are both the calm before, and the storm itself. You are a perfect balance.
Mrs Hudson didn’t speak. She walked closer to Sherlock and took his hand as if she was checking if he was real. She furrowed her eyebrows and looked at him with a severe expression. “It’s so good to see you, dear,” she finally spoke. Her voice sounded nothing but kind, and John could see Sherlock’s fear melt away.
It had been tough to be back at the Yard. He tried not to get affected by the stares and the whispers, to be the person he was before he went to Eastern Europe. And in Lestrade’s office, he tried to be on top of his game and suck in every bit of information Lestrade had to offer. But in result, his head was spinning from all the things he had heard. He knew it would probably be better to go to the apartment tomorrow, but he needed to push through. He needed to know he could do this, that he still was the same. He couldn’t back out already. All he needed was a moment to recollect himself.
“What?”
“You did great kids, just wait here on further instructions,” John said once the class stood at the right place. Other classes came walking outside the building, and John let out a breath when he saw that his own class, including Sherlock, got out as well.
“Yes?”
A rush of panic went through John's body. It must have shown on his face because the doctor quickly continued. "Don't worry, Mr. Holmes is stable now. He's in the recovery room. It won't be long before we can take him up to the ICU."
“Good morning John, feeling okay?” Greg asked, looking up from his newspaper once he heard John enter.
That was it. It was over. Defeated by his last mission, died of an honourable death—the way he wanted it. Suddenly John no longer felt the panic he had first sensed. He felt a kind of calmness coming up instead. It was what it was. It was the way he wanted to die. It was okay.
“This is a good idea.”
“No.”
“Do you need me to take care of anything?” Mycroft offered.
With a sigh, John decided it was time to get himself out of Sherlock's embrace and get up before the detective would wake up. He shifted a little, turned on his side, facing Sherlock and took the hand of the detective, and tried to put it on the pillow next to his head. This plan had worked quite well the previous mornings, but when John decided to pull his hand away so he could get up, he noticed that Sherlock somehow got a grip of John’s hand. John expected Sherlock to wake up right after, but he didn’t. He tried to free his grasp, but Sherlock wouldn’t let go. The only thing he could do was lay down and wait for Sherlock to wake up.
“Let’s go for method two then, if you think that’s best,” John spoke, looking at Mycroft instead of doctor Wilson. Mycroft nodded in agreement.
I snort. “That’s surely not true.”
“You know what happened to Sherlock.”
“An interested party.”
Sherlock seemed to realise the same thing and looked away first. He cleared his throat. “John, uhm…” he started. “I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work and while I’m flattered by your interest, I’m not sure that…”
John pulled him back in their embrace and didn’t let go. And Sherlock didn’t want him to. The feeling of John pressed against him was the most comforting feeling he could have right now. Knowing that John still was here after everything that had happened and everything he told him was something he couldn’t wrap his mind around. But then again, John always managed to surprise him.
“Hey,” John started carefully. He gently grabbed one of Sherlock’s wrists, not caring if it was the best thing he could do right now or not. Sherlock didn’t flinch. Instead, he let John pull his hand from his ears slightly. “It’s okay. There’s nothing there anymore.”
He hadn’t been here in two years, not since the death of his best friend. The place reminded him too much of the cups of coffee they had drunk, all the meals they had eaten together and of the conversations they had had, Even the smallest memory hurt of the man hurt like hell, and after months of grief, he learned that he couldn’t torture himself like that. Sherlock Holmes was dead, and he had the right to try and continue with his life. At least, that was what John believed for the past two years.
The look of surprise I get when I offer him a cigarette would be laughable if the man wasn’t about to lose it. He quietly takes one out of the package, lights it, and he lets out a sigh. I do the same and take a good look; it’s not often that I see Sherlock like this, so lost, so vulnerable. He’s clearly doesn’t know what to do or how to react, but I’m about to give him some perspective.
John smiled a little. “Hills.”
“You need help,” Sherlock said before John could ask what was wrong.
I'm very reluctant to get up since I want to avoid a conversation about our relationship's nature, but my transport is betraying me once again. The smell of something delicious has filled the apartment, making my stomach growl and my mouth water.
John watched him with concern and knew he had to do something to prevent that Sherlock would blame himself for hitting him. He reached across the table to grab Sherlock’s hand, in hope to get his attention.
John nodded. He wanted to say more but stopped. He didn’t register that little fact properly yesterday. A shiver went through his spine. He knew how susceptible Sherlock was to drugs. He also knew GHB wasn’t his drug. Heroin, cocaine and sometimes painkillers were his drugs of choice, not GHB. That only meant Sherlock hadn’t taken it voluntarily.
“No.”
“I didn’t think it was of any importance, so I deleted it. Won’t happen again.” Sherlock looked passed John through the window. “Was that all? I need to get back to my class.”
That wasn’t the reaction John was hoping to get. “Don’t act so surprised,” he defended. “You know I’m…”
When he got no response, John walked over to the sofa. “Sherlock, wake up,” he tried again.
Sherlock looked up in confusion. “What?”
A feeling of nervousness that you experience before something important happens.
Charly nodded, but Kyle hesitated. “But what about you? Aren’t you coming with us?”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said, finally in a small voice. Before John could attempt in another way to try to comfort him, he stood up from his chair and walked over the living room.
“That’s nice of you.”
Greg shook his head in disbelief. “That can’t possibly be true. I’ve seen Sherlock going through hell and back, but he never stopped fighting.”
With a sigh, I heave myself from the sofa. When I look at John, he grins victoriously. My first instinct is to snap at him, but that would probably be considered as 'a bit not good'. So instead, I just shoot him a glare. I walk towards the kitchen, but halfway I stop in my tracks.
“Then who said anything about partners?”
After a moment, Sherlock decided it wasn’t enough. He deepened the kiss, let his tongue touch John’s bottom lip. John answered with his, and the kiss grew firmer, more determined.
John knew what Sherlock was referring to, but didn’t reply. He knew what Sherlock was trying to do; he was trying to lighten up the situation with humour, just like the night before. But this time, John was prepared and didn’t fall for it. He just looked at Sherlock with his arms folded across his chest and waited for him to realize they were going to have a serious, adult, conversation.
“Why did you two come in together?”
"Now, I do understand your excellent reputation at the 5thNortumberland Fusiliers. Nobody would dare to go against captain John Watson."
“What?” was al John managed to say.
Sherlock huffed. “Fine, I gave one wrong address! But so did you!”
“Yeah well, I hate being late,” John answered and took the offered cup of coffee from Sherlock’s hand.
On the other side of the room was a sideboard with some photos of his family and friends and an old radio on it. A violin hangs above the sideboard. It was one of the few things John had brought from Bakerstreet and one of the few things which reminded him of his former friend.
“Brilliant,” he muttered while following Sherlock towards their classroom.
“Oh, but I think if somebody else asked he would,” Mike chuckled.
“He’s not,” Mike said.
He thanked the driver and followed Sherlock, who had already stepped out of the car and was walking down the street. The familiar image struck John. Although the detective didn’t walk as fast and confident as before, seeing him in his long, Belstaff coat striding towards 221b made that John couldn’t stop smiling the whole time.
So when John arrived at st. Barts Monday morning, he was in a pretty good mood. He greeted Mrs Hudson, grabbed a cup of coffee from the teacher’s lounge and went to his classroom to prepare the upcoming day.
“How long,” John interrupted trough gritted teeth before Sherlock could wave his question away. “beforehand did you know what you were going to do to me?”
“I… I don’t do this. Dating, I mean. I haven’t been on a date since Uni, and I’m not even sure if that counted.” Sherlock hesitated a moment before continuing. “I’ve only had one relationship in my life, and although it was many things, I now realize that it wasn’t a healthy one. I know that I’m not an easy person and that my inexperience in this area isn’t what you are looking for, so I would understand if you would want to reconsider this.”
Suddenly, it clicked. Sherlock didn’t come to him just to check how he was doing. He came to talk. And John thought he had a pretty good idea what Sherlock wanted to tell him, which made his heart jump out of his chest. But then, he realized what Sherlock must’ve been thinking once he noticed Harry was around and John couldn’t help himself. He started to giggle, and before he knew it, he was laughing hard, unable to stop.
Sherlock’s pace was a bit slower and more deliberate, his face tense, and his teeth clenched. He was in pain but didn’t want to show it. He tried to hold up his previous façade of the cold, untouchable detective, while he actually wasn’t ready for this. And maybe that was the thing John worried the most. Sherlock would to everything not to show what he had been through, and it would break him in the end. And John just had to stand there and watch him do it.
"Sir?"
Sherlock is standing near the window overlooking Baker Street when I enter the apartment. I greet him, but he doesn't acknowledge me. I take off my coat, settle in my chair, and take a good look at him. Something's going on, that much I can tell, but he doesn't answer me when I ask what's wrong. I look around, searching for a clue, when my eye catches something on the table - a small box. In it, I find a simple silver ring.
John shrugged in answer. “Not really. Maybe watch the game tonight. Why?”
Sherlock nodded in response, and Patrick bend over the chart again. "And do you have someone to take care of you at home, Mr Holmes?"
John suddenly started to feel nervous. He knew Sherlock didn’t support the project and that he had tolerated it just because John wanted to try it. John had wanted to schedule it on his own days as much as possible so he wouldn’t saddle Sherlock with it during his days. But that also meant Sherlock wasn’t up to date about the project and John knew that he wouldn’t appreciate being kept in the dark.
“Let’s have a look at which subject we teach when, and make an overview and work from there?” John suggested.
"Doctor Wilson Is trying to save the upper lobe of the spleen. At first, it looked promising. She was able to dissect the affected part and just started to suture the parenchymatous vessels."
“I thought that maybe, one day, we would become more than friends,” John answered, and couldn’t withhold a hint of a smile. “But that was all in my head, wasn’t it?”
“How?” asked Sherlock after a long minute of silence.
“Him going home wasn’t suddenly, Sherlock.”
And then, it hit him.
Oh, thank you so much for all the comments! I'm gonna write a reply, but first: a new chapter! 💕
When John came running, there was a lot of commotion around Sherlock’s room. Mycroft was in a fierce discussion with one of the doctors, the other one standing next to Mycroft, both female.
Abruptly, the car stopped, and the door on John’s side swung open. He stepped outside and looked around to see where he was. The whole ride couldn’t have taken more than a few minutes, but he couldn’t recognize where he was. It seemed like some kind of industrial place, some construction site.
To anyone who would hear the question, it would sound like Sherlock just was checking if the situation was under control, but John knew better. Although it was well hidden, he could hear the slight tone of concern in Sherlock’s voice. He was checking up on john, making sure he was okay.
“I’m not; I have a date.”
“Ugh, stop it.”  John groaned and walked past Harry to put on his shirt. Harry followed him and fell on his bed with a loud thump.
Yay! A new chapter! I have to say, I had some issues with this one. But hey, it's finally here!
There, in the window of the far corner of the second floor stood two children, were screaming and banging on the windows, desperately trying to get someone’s attention.
“Normally, I don’t.”
“They’re out!” John heard someone say and before he knew it, Alice was lifted from his arms by someone and he felt another person’s arm against his chest, preventing him from falling.
“I do. If you had run it by me, it would’ve told you it wouldn’t be smart for you to-”
It was a desperate attempt to play is cool but Sherlock knew he was had gone too far. He hadn’t missed the low, threatening tone Lestrade’s voice contained; a tone that was never directed at him, at least.
“Don’t bother. He won’t be here,” she said, her tone light and friendly.
After a long moment, Mycroft looked up from the report. He seemed to hesitate for a moment. Then, he handed the report to John.
“Do people even have arch enemy’s?” John asked curiously when entering the front door of 221 Baker Street. Their date had gone wonderfully well, and Sherlock had invited John in for something to drink afterwards. During the cab ride, John suddenly remembered his strange encounter earlier that evening and had told Sherlock about it.
Mycroft looked up from his computer and furrowed his eyebrows at the sight of John Watson standing in the door opening. A quick glance told him that the doctor was angry, furious even. Normally, Mycroft would make a dismissive comment and send the person opposite him away instantly, but in the last few weeks, he had grown a new kind of respect for the doctor. The man seemed the only one who could help Sherlock get on the right track again, and for that, Mycroft was immensely grateful to him. So the least he could offer in return was him treating the doctor as an equal.
“You’ve met my brother, Mycroft. He probably wanted to check if you would meet his criteria for dating me.”
“To the other side of the world. For two weeks. With your latest fling.” Sherlock hissed through gritted teeth.
Sherlock stopped pacing and gave John a look which John recognized right away. Sherlock thought he was acting like an idiot. “Is officer Brandon the last of those four who joined your team?”
Lestrade shook his head. “No, other departments didn’t get any.” He paused for a moment and sighed. “And we don’t want to check with other police stations, trying to avoid a lot of commotion. But as far as I can tell, there were no other stations who received threats.”
Sherlock glared at him for a long moment but didn’t seem able to find the right answer. Instead, he just let himself fall onto the mattress and continued to stare at the ceiling with an angry frown on his face.
“Hmm,” Molly hummed and frowned. “It sounds a bit like Sherlock from last year.”
Sherlock closed his note with “I’ll see you tomorrow,” and John felt a rush of warmth spreading through his body. He couldn’t help himself. The foresight of seeing Sherlock and fill him in about how he was experiencing his first days made him happy.
“In one of the wards downstairs,” Mycroft replied
“We need to talk.”
But John didn’t respond; he couldn’t. His throat felt dry, and his heart was hammering in his chest. He opened his mouth to give a reply, but nothing came. All he could do was look at Sherlock with panic in his eyes, hoping the detective would notice what was going on.
“I guess I am,” John answered and couldn’t suppress his smile. Harry was right; he was head over heels here.
“John,” Molly started, her tone cautious. “I don’t know if it’s any of my business, but are you two okay?”
After the Autumn break, St. Bartholomew’s state school was ready to open its doors again. The damage of the fire was limited to the old part of the building and the stairwell. With some effort, a bunch of handymen were able to fix the staircase in time, so they didn’t have to keep the school closed. The old part of the building was another thing, but luckily there weren’t any classrooms located there.
The therapist turned around to close the door and held out her hand. “I don’t think I introduced myself properly. My name’s Maggie. It’s so good to meet you finally, Sherlock told me so much about you during his sessions. You really are his rock, you know?”
And... It's a wrap!
Sherlock returned John’s smile. “Yeah, I think I am."
"John Watson?"
John desperately tried again to make Sherlock talk. “Please, tell me what’s wrong, Sherlock. I don’t think I can help you if…” But he suddenly stopped. He heard it—the tap. The tap was dripping.
First, he checked in with Ella, who seemed to have everything under control. She wasn’t missing any kids, which was a relief, because the smallest children were the hardest to manage in a situation like this.
“You need my help,” John stated.
“It’s okay. How many kids do you have?”
“The suspect suddenly went somewhere else!”
“How are you doing today?” Maggie asked politely. It was probably just a question to break the ice. Sherlock took a breath.
“I’m doing fi—"
When the class was filled with students, John looked around for a moment. The kids in front of him were chatting happily about their holidays, and John couldn’t hide his smile. After a couple more minutes, he decided to start the day.
“Like him as a friend, huh?” he asked seconds later, the smirk on his face clearly audible in his voice.
John swore he could kiss her right now. “Thank you so much, Mrs Hudson!” And with that, he turned around, almost feeling as cheerful as Sherlock did.
Patrick did his examination, and John was pleased to see that the strength Sherlock once had wasn't gone completely. The last thing John wanted to be was for Sherlock to be utterly dependable at home. It would drive him crazy.
John didn’t have time to respond. Mycroft stormed into the ward. “What on earth did you do?” he yelled at the nurse. John saw her flinch slightly and felt some pity for her.
Everyone was getting seated and was talking about their holiday. John looked around, but there was no sign of his partner. He looked at his watch. It was almost 10 o'clock. John was sure that Sherlock wouldn’t be late, something that became clear the other day. Just when he took his phone from his pocket to send a text, Molly sat down next to him.
“It’s for men.”
“Sherlock, that’s insane.” John interrupted. “There’s no way we can check all of those files just to see if there’s a small connection.”
John smiled briefly and looked also looked at Mike, who was just staring at the two. “We don’t know a thing about each other; I don’t know your background. I don’t even know your name.”
“Come on, Johnny. Don’t be shy!” Harry encouraged him.
Sherlock looked at John, one eyebrow slightly raised. "But you don't live there anymore," he stated.
“You need to get to the hospital, right now. There’s a car outside. He knows it’s urgent.”
Sherlock didn’t calm down. John moved closer and decided to try something different. He pressed his forehead against Sherlock’s and waited for a moment to feel if there was a reaction. When Sherlock didn’t pull away, John started to speak softly. “Focus on me, follow my breathing. Can you feel it? Try to breathe with me.”
"Ah Dr Watson, that's great," Patrick said with a smile.
Sherlock hesitated. “Piss off.”
“Sherlock,” Lestrade warned.
John looked at Sherlock for a long moment. “Fine,” he managed to say before Sherlock spun into action.
And I can only follow my soldier.
John swallowed. “Not now.”
Sherlock pulled back his hand. "I'm fine." He didn't sound convincing at all. John heard a snort next to him.
John sat down in the chair. “Thank you for having me on short notice, sir,” he started.
John broke the kiss with a final brush of lips and pulled back slightly. “Even better then I imagined,” he whispered against Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock swallowed. “Four days.”
“He can be quite a challenge and a pretentious know-it-all, and he is not afraid to say what he thinks at all. He can be quite harsh and doesn’t always have the best social skills, but once you get to know him, he’s the most caring person you know. He’s incredibly smart and has a very sharp eye for detail. Very resourceful and creative, too.”
“And that’s just the problem. I can’t.”
And on top of that, there will be an epilogue tomorrow! YAY!
A girl named Jenny raised her hand. “Mr. John, will you join us when we have music?”
It took only two seconds before Lestrade turned around as well, and one second to realise what the situation was. “Shit, who’s kids are those?” he hissed. “Who didn’t count correctly?”
And boy, he had plenty to say yesterday.
John turned around and walked back towards the crowd of kids. Suddenly, he felt a little anxious. What if kids were missing? Or if kids were panicking? He shook his head. This wasn’t the moment to let the kids see his own fear. He had to be brave. Otherwise, there would be even more panic. He just hoped that the rest of the staff could act the same way.
But as time passed by, John felt his hope fade away. After an hour, he finally convinced himself that if Sherlock wanted to join them, he would be there by now. He was about to get up from his chair to get the next round when the door of the pub opened again. A tall, dark-haired figure entered the pub and John could feel a rush of excitement running through his body.
Finally, Sherlock decided to pull away. He looked directly in John’s eyes, his own gaze playful. “I do remember something about inviting you in.”
“Oh, God.”
Hi there, and welcome to this new fic! This idea was planted as a seed inside my crazy brain and I couldn't get it out. So enjoy the ride and feel free to comment! I love to hear from you :)
John shared a look with Mycroft. They both knew that a complete splenectomy meant. The risk of getting infections and getting sick was much higher. Sure, you could live without a spleen just fine if you would take your medicines every day and just be careful. But it would mean that Sherlock had to adapt to his current lifestyle. And that was never going to happen.
Anderson turned around quickly and looked at Sally, who gave him a panicky look and shrugged her shoulders. John looked away, awkwardly.
“Okay kids,” John started once the class was filled with students. “I  know we normally start our week by telling how your weekend was, but I need a couple of minutes before we can start our day. Please grab your reading books and start reading in silence.”
“It hurts,” Sherlock groaned and his face twisted in a painful grimace.
John opened his mouth to reply but got interrupted by the buzzing of his phone. There was a text from Mycroft.
He put down his mug. “I know you have questions.”
You wouldn't believe the struggle I had with this chapter... It nearly made me want to give up the fic, but the lovely Ohlooktheresabee helped me through it! And low and behold, after months, it's finally there!
He walked to the door and waited for the class to form a proper line. “Remember, try to keep as calm as possible. Everything will be all right.”
“Don’t worry; I’ll stay.”
John repeated this again and again, like a mantra. It was the only way for him to ensure that thoughts like "what if" and "why" did not get the upper hand.
John wasn’t a drinker. Weeks could pass by without feeling in need of alcohol. Yet this was the second night in a row he was drinking, this time a much too expensive bottle of whiskey from the minibar whose bill would eventually go to Mycroft. When he got back to the hotel room, he had immediately knocked back his first and poured in a second, much too full glass.
All of a sudden, Sherlock sat up straight. “I couldn’t find out why I was having this particular dream, but I think I figured it out.” He reached for his pocket, pulled the two photographs out of it and handed them to John.
John held out the cup in front of Sherlock and couldn’t hide a smile. “Git.”
“What the hell is wrong with you?” John started, no longer able to put his anger aside. “I had put up with a lot of crap from you last week, but now you are questioning my ability to teach? In front of our colleagues? In front of Lestrade?”
When he did let go of Sherlock, it felt like a loss. Both men weren’t able to look at each other and shifted their gaze to the burning fireplace.
“Okay, I will text him. But no guarantees.”
Please leave a comment behind! I love to hear from you guys.
“Then you have to find another way to make him listen to you.” Molly stood up from her chair and walked away. Before she left the classroom, she turned around. “I’m sure it’ll be all right. For what it’s worth, he seemed to enjoy your company last Friday.”
“Manageable.”
“Prostitution. Male prostitution, to be exact.”
“I already started to work on… oh.” Sherlock closed his mouth and looked at John, a little embarrassed. He swiftly turned around and started to order some books and files. He cleared his throat. “Obviously I can, uhm… straighten things up a bit.”
“Oh, please. Stop overreacting. My apologies, it won’t happen again.”
Of course, it has been a long time coming, but hearing John open up about Sherlock that way, allowing his true feelings to show touched me deeply. Once he started talking, he simply couldn’t stop, and the way his mouth kept curling into a smile at the thought of Sherlock was incredibly endearing. If there was only a way to give them a push in the right direction…
And just like that, he's able to brighten my mood and leave me blushing.
“All right, all right,” John called. The class was silent in an instance. “For this once, I will come and listen. But that’s just because I’ve heard great things about you guys.”
Sherlock's eyes fluttered open for a second. He looked at John, and John saw that he was fighting to keep his eyes open. John just gave him a little, reassuring smile. "Go back to sleep. I'll be right here," he whispered. Sherlock closed his eyes again, and within seconds, he was drifting off into the shadowy world of sedatives and painkillers.
This took John completely by surprise. He looked at Sherlock, who was avoiding his gaze and looked at his hands. “You don’t have to apologise for anything?” he asked after a moment.
“Are you complete, Philip?” John tried when he arrived, but he got no response. He tried again. “Anderson! Are you complete?”
Her flirtatious tone doesn’t go unnoticed, and I let my eyes glance over her face. She is pretty, with long dark-blonde hair, clear-blue eyes and a couple of freckles around her nose. She looks like a genuinely sweet girl, and I know that usually, she would definitely be someone who I would fall for.

“Sherlock, please.”
I hope you are all save and that you won't let the lockdown get the better of you. <3
“There’s not much in there—just some basic facts. No names, no patient history. We want to make sure no one is possible to trace him down,” Mycroft spoke deliberately. John started to read.
“Where did you want to go?”
Kyle shook his head in answer. “We didn’t see any fire. There was some smoke at the bottom of the stairs, but we ran very fast.”
“What time is it?”
John still wasn’t finished yet. “You were acting like an arrogant bastard all week. I should report this to Lestrade, see what he thinks about your behaviour last week! Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t do that.”
“I can make them tonight. I have to cancel an appointment, but that’s no pro-”
I sigh, knowing that I can’t hide in here forever. I give a firm nod, straighten my spine and check myself in the mirror one more time. It has to be enough.
"Shit."
“I’m sure they told you how the surgery went. I spoke to doctor Wilson. They’ll start your detox tomorrow and send in a psychiatrist.”
Sherlock turned around and narrowed his eyes. “Really, Lestrade. You are even slower on the uptake than before. Please, don’t bother me with that sluggish brain of yours. Come on, John!”
“Sherlock?” John said after a moment.
John shook his head. “I’ll make sure Alice is okay and carry her downstairs. But you guys are a lot faster without me, so I need you to go ahead of us. Don’t worry. We will be fine.”
“Quite well. It’s nice to be back in the saddle.”
“The fire brigade is on its way; we can’t do anything.” Lestrade ran his hands across his face. “We’re lucky no kids are facing this side of the building. The fire isn’t on the second floor, so they are not in immediate danger. The best thing we can do is wait.”
Lestrade sat up straight and sighed. “We’ve been over this. I’m not going to fire Sherlock.”
Sherlock was about to make an excuse, but the look on John’s face made him change his mind. He followed John to the hallway and closed the door behind him.
“Are you in pain?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock looked up at John. There was something about the way he stood, about the way he looked at him. There was sympathy in John’s eyes, and Sherlock didn’t need more deductions to know why. “They told you.”
“I’ll start with a coffee, please. It’s cold outside,” Sherlock simply replied. John knew Sherlock didn’t drink, but it was clear that Mike didn’t. He wondered if it was supposed to be a secret.
John gaped at him in disbelief, his eyes big. The words didn’t seem to land. His mind was racing, his heart was, again, pounding in his chest. What did he mean? He didn’t understand.
“Sherlock, are you okay?”
One of the things he and Sherlock picked up doing in the last couple of weeks, was meeting up before the day began when they both had to work at Bart’s. They both agreed to come in early so that they had the time to catch up and drink a cup of coffee together. At first, John thought it would be so they could align with each other, but it seemed that Sherlock had other intentions. He just wanted to get to know John, to have a friendly chat with him. And that interest made John's heart leap in his chest, and his cheeks burn.
“Good. Listen,” John continued. “Don’t apologise for what happened. You have absolutely nothing to be sorry for. You didn’t do anything. This wasn’t a choice. This is something that happened to you. Am I making myself clear?”
He was running out of time; he knew that. The fire would spread, and if the staircase filled up with smoke, there would be no way out.
John shrugged. “Haven’t slept much.”
‘John, you look… well. Better,’ Anthea started. John just gave her a small nod. The last time he saw her, she came by to give him his 8
“He needs a moment, Greg.”
John shook his head. “No, I don’t think so. He tried to talk to Sherlock multiple times. But he isn’t talking. He isn’t himself. He’s aggressive, violent even. Attacked his brother twice.”
John responded before Sherlock got the chance to. “Sick? No, I was waiting for you guys!”
This took John completely by surprise. “Oh, uhm… Sherlock has another appointment to get his cast removed. Is it possible to do it over the phone?”
“I know you may believe otherwise, but I don’t want to bury my own brother,” Mycroft spat.
Maggie’s face grew a bit more serious. “John, Sherlock requested you in today’s session. He wants you to know what happened but is afraid to tell you in person. He figured that if you were in this session with him, he could explain some things to you through me.”
Woohoo, three chapters in one day! But then again, I had some catching up to do. Make sure you don't miss out on the previous two chapters (Swimming and Salt). <3
With that, Molly hopped off her barstool and walked towards the bar. John took his phone from his pocket and saw Mike still grinning.
“Of course, dear. Whatever you need.”
“Oh please, stop with the pity party, would you?” Sherlock snapped, but he didn’t sound convincing. Something in his voice cracked, and Mycroft knew he had Sherlock right where he wanted him to be.
The man glared at John, but he ignored it. They looked at each other for a moment before John’s phone buzzed. John briefly hesitated before he reached in his pocket; a wave of guilt ran through him as he realized he had forgotten to text Sherlock he would be late. He eyed at the screen.
“Not good?”
“I don’t,”  Greg said, not looking up from his newspaper. “But if you want to talk about it, you can.”
But when John had come home and finally allowed himself to calm down a bit, he realized that Sherlock once again had managed to infiltrate his life. Of course, he still felt furious, hurt and upset, but another emotion came at the surface as well: curiosity. He wanted an explanation, wanted to know how and why he faked his own death, wanted to know why the detective had been away for two years, and above all, wanted to make sure he was going to stay. John needed him to stay.
When their eyes met, Mycroft snapped back into reality. “He has the final say."
When the weather forecast told bad weather was coming, I knew I wouldn’t allow myself to catch any sleep. Now, I’m sitting at the kitchen table in the middle of the night, watching the lightning illuminate the otherwise pitch-black kitchen. Thunder rolls above London and the sound of rain clattering against the window is soothing.
Again, John went through his list: ‘
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s lips quirk into a smile for a second, clearly remembering as well. I know he likes to deduce in front of me; it gives him a moment to show off a bit.
“Thank you,” John muttered.
But unlike yesterday, Sherlock anticipated the hit. He caught John’s hands in his and took them in his. John tried to fight him, tried to break free out of the detective's firm grip, but the detective just held him. That was when John couldn’t control himself together anymore. He felt every emotion rushing through his body; anger, pain, confusion, betrayal, heartache. They all came to the surface at the same time, and he couldn’t fight it. He couldn’t fight him, not anymore.
Patrick looked up, questioningly and stopped moving. He gave Sherlock a reassuring smile. "I'm sure you will do…"
“Did he offer you money to spy on me?”
This made Sherlock look up from his files. He narrowed his eyes and calculated his options. After a second, he seemed to come to a conclusion there weren’t many. Looking around, he grabbed the nearest takeaway box and shoved a spoon full of noodles into his mouth. “Happy?” he hissed after swallowing his bite.
Dry mouth. Headache. Nauseous. The awful feeling of a hangover engulfed John even before he opened his eyes. He immediately regretted trying. The room was spinning his headache spiked massively. Even the smallest crack of light that came through the curtains was too much. He struggled to get the glass of water and the paracetamol that stood on the bedside table next to the guest bed.
“J… John?” he managed to say between whimpers.
“Sherlock? Everything all right?” John asked when he saw the shift in Sherlock’s face, but Sherlock didn’t respond. He didn’t know what to say. He had hit John. Maybe not on purpose, but his subconscious had seen him as a threat, and his instinct had been to fight him off. He had hurt John while he had tried to help him.
John didn’t know how to answer that and shot Mike a questioning look.
There was a slight quiver in Mycroft’s voice that made John believe him instantly. He clenched his jaw. How was this possible? How could this be happening again? Suddenly, John knew precisely why Mycroft was here. He wasn’t just here to bring the news; he needed something.
“I just want a cup of coffee and a 15-minute break,” he muttered. “Okay, send him in then.”
“Doctor Watson, I don’t think that’s wise.”
Mycroft looked up, straight into John’s eyes. “You can’t say his name, can you?”
John smirked and pulled Sherlock back against his mouth. He wasted no time and opened Sherlock’s mouth with his tongue. The slow, sensual kiss they had shared moments ago had made way for a more heated one.
Nowadays, I'm just happy to get home, knowing that someone's waiting for me.
John didn’t know how to respond to that. He shook her hand in answer. “Please, call me John. Is everything all right? I thought his session was later today.”
“And what’s that?”
“I'm not responsible for a class, is there something I can do to help?” he asked, looking from the principal to Sarah.
“That wasn’t my… I didn’t…” I stammer, but I know he’s right. But when I open my mouth to tell him, the driver stops.
“I will keep that under advisement,” Sherlock answered, his voice suddenly more distant. This clearly wasn’t the thing he wanted to hear, and John noticed it too.
Sherlock didn’t respond right away. He really didn’t want John to go, but he had caused him enough pain already in the past. He couldn’t do that to him anymore.
Now it was Sherlock’s time to look puzzled. He noticed the deliberate tone in John’s voice and the slight shift in his posture, but he couldn’t place it.
When John saw Sherlock’s mouth curl up in a smile, he couldn’t help but smile as well. And before they knew it, they were both laughing together for the first time in over a week, and John was happy to notice that all of the doubts he had and all of the anger he felt the last week was gone entirely. Everything was going to be fine.
Molly interfered. “Oh, John, please try? I think he really would like to come, but he just needs a push in the right direction.”
“So,” John started, not looking up from the cup he held in both hands. He tightened his grip to keep his hands from shaking. “You found him then?”
With his cup of tea in his hand, John sat down in his chair and stared into the fire. For minutes, he just sat there, occasionally sipping his tea. For the first time in what looked like ages, his mind felt pleasantly blank and peaceful.
Mrs Hudson let out a squeal and John looked up in surprise. “Oh, I knew it! I knew it from the moment I saw you standing on my doorstep!”
“No, it fits you perfectly,” I tell him, my voice hoarse. I can see by the smirk on his face that he knows what kind of effect it has on me.
“Well, let’s just say she wasn’t exactly happy with the situation and said some things I wouldn’t want to repeat in public.”
“And you couldn’t be bothered to get up?” John raised his eyebrows. “It’s password protected.”
After a long shower, he shaved with precision, got dressed, went to the kitchen and prepared some lunch to take with him. Since he was already up, John decided he would take a walk before going to Bart’s and grab some breakfast and coffee on the go.
“Sherlock,” John started in his sweetest, most gentle tone that made Sherlock shiver. “As much as that touches me, you know you don’t have to, right? I am competent to protect myself. I am a soldier; protecting civilians is what we do.”
Could it be that John was attracted to him? Liked him?
“So, tell me,” I start, trying to buy some time before he begins about Sherlock. “Who was it this time? Dimmock? Anderson?”
A moment later, John returned to the living room with a beer and a steaming mug of tea. He handed it to Sherlock, who had sat down on the sofa. John sat down on the couch, again, took a sip from his beer. Sherlock mirrored the movement and took a sip from his cup. His eyes flicked up at John briefly, and John gave him a sympathetic look, hoping it would be enough for Sherlock to relax a little. He did.
Sherlock snorted. “And you’re sure you checked everything?”
He narrowed his eyes and looked closely at Mycroft. The man had not changed much. He still wore the same neat suits, the slick hairstyle, and still had the same stiff gaze and his umbrella in his hand. Yet, there seemed to be something different about him. He looked tired, almost exhausted as if he had slept very poorly for a few nights.
“Add a little extra Grana Padano on top of it,” I finish. “A good glass of wine on the side and you’re done.”
Sherlock sighed. He knew he had to explain it to John eventually, and that he couldn’t keep the actual reason behind it from him. “Moriarty is out there, and we both know he’s after us. Not me, us.” Sherlock felt his anger spike again. “Did you really think he wouldn’t follow you in New Zealand if he had known you were there? That he didn’t have people there who could track you down, or who couldn’t kill you on behalf of him?”
“First things first. The surgery went as well as expected. I was able to spear the upper lobe of the spleen. There were some complications, of which you are aware. It wasn’t a large pneumothorax, and the drain should prevent it from happening again. I think we can remove it in a couple of days. The rest will heal in time. We should be able to start with solid food tomorrow so we can remove the feeding tube, and I will order to remove the catheter by the end of the day.”
"Don't. I don't need to know what happened last year. I believe you are a decent human being and a great teacher, and that's all I need to know in order to work with you. We will deal with the rest later." John paused for a moment. Then, he gave Sherlock a small smile. "Now, I was going to watch a movie. do you want to watch it with me?"
. He couldn’t’ think anymore, couldn’t focus. All he could think about was the feeling of John’s lips against his. They felt soft and firm at the same time and feel absolutely fantastic. He had never thought kissing John would feel this exiting, this electrifying.
Whoops, I know I’m a little behind, but I’ll fix it tomorrow with two! :)
Sherlock looked down at John but didn’t move. He couldn’t. The words John just said, ran through his mind like a siren. For the first time, Sherlock noticed what was really going on. He was going through a hard time, but John was blaming himself for it. And he could not let that happen.
Mycroft put his elbows on the desk and entwined his hands. He leaned his face on his index fingers. It seemed that he had to think about John’s request.
Sherlock stood up and put his hands on the kids’ shoulders. When he walked passed Lestrade, they shared a look. Lestrade gave him a small nod in understanding, and that was enough for Sherlock to know he would do everything he could, which was one of the most comforting thoughts Sherlock had since John entered the burning building.
“It’s not random!” Sherlock snapped suddenly. “It’s never random!”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock replied a little too quickly.
“You heard me.”
John didn’t want to lose it in front of Sherlock. He had to stay strong. He pulled back a little so he could take a deep breath and looked up, trying to regain his composure. But Sherlock didn’t let him. He grabbed John’s arm as if he wanted to prevent him from leaving.
John broke the kiss and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s. “All right, all right,” he replied, and Sherlock felt him smile against his lips. “You’re probably right. But God, I would love to take you inside now.”
“Hold on; you are telling me that that was the don’t-hurt-my-brother-or-I’ll-hurt-you speech?”
Sherlock’s whole body started trembling. “But of course, they found out. That’s when it got ugly.” His voice broke. “They tried to torture information out of me. I didn’t give them any. Then, they decided to try different ways to force me to have sex. That’s why they gave me the GHB.” He let out a small huff. “It was the first time that being an addict had his perks. I had a high tolerance, so I didn’t pass out and was still able to stay conscious enough to fight back.”
“What?”
Almost right after the first text, his phone buzzed again.
Then, there was the case. There had been a second kidnapping, much to Sherlock’s frustration. Again, there wasn’t much to find at the apartment of the victim. The only trace Sherlock had noticed besides some fingerprints, was the faint smell of Malboro cigarettes and another photograph of someone who had been tortured. He knew he had to tell John about the photo’s as well, but he wasn’t sure how John would respond.
“I ate two days ago,” Sherlock shrugged.
“Of course he did,” John muttered. It didn’t surprise him that Sherlock already knew he would come by.
Perfect. Not only was he late for his date, now Sherlock had started to worry if he would show up at all. The last thing he wanted was to give Sherlock any doubt about his intentions. He decided this had taken long enough.
“So it’s random?”
“Oh doctor Watson, I’m so sorry,” she started, sounding slightly frightened. “I don’t know what happened. I was getting him ready for the night, and everything was fine. We were even chatting. I left him alone for a minute to grab some things, and when I came back, he was completely zoned out. I don’t know what I did wrong.” The young nurse panicked.
Wait, whut? An update? Yes, indeed!
If someone asked him two weeks ago if he thought he would ever return to Baker Street, he simply would’ve laughed and waved it away. Now, he sat in the middle of the living room of his old apartment with his old flatmate in the bedroom next door. His flatmate, who was supposed to be dead.
“How many threats have there been?” John asked.
Sherlock looked up from his phone. “You texted him two hours ago. Your text wasn’t long, so it was someone you know and knows you’re in London. And got a reply right away, Lestrade always texts back immediately. It was obvious.”
“You don’t,” Molly replied. “That’s why you need to talk to him about this.”
“Of course, I’m on it.”
Sherlock gasped at the feeling of John’s skin against his. He looked down at their joined hands, unable to process what was happening. His mind went in circles. It was apparent John liked someone, but he couldn’t figure out who it was. It couldn’t be Harry, that would be insane. No, there had to be someone else, someone he missed. But he was sure that there was no one at the apartment except John and Harry. And himself, of course.
“I think you need to be more specific Dr Watson, as I have no idea what you are referring to.”
John’s eyes roamed across Sherlock’s face, and Sherlock knew he didn’t have to say anything else. He knew John was able to read him when no one else could; it had been like that from the beginning, and this situation was no exception. He would be able to see the struggle Sherlock had in the last few weeks with finding anything on Moriarty, the worry he had experienced that came with it, and above all, he would see the fear that was there for the first time in God knows how long.
“I know that, John,” Sherlock answered slightly frustrated. “It’s not that I want to protect you; I need to.”
“John, I’m...”
“Quite clear. And is your wife away for long?”
In answer, I roll onto my other side, facing away from John. I clutch my arms between my knees and try to ignore the impulse to scratch, hoping that the pressure will give me some relief.
Mycroft had sat down, his legs crossed, his hands resting on the armrests of the chair. John took back his seat behind the desk.
Sherlock didn’t answer. He didn’t want to admit it, but he liked John’s presence. It was nice to have a normal conversation with someone instead of living a solitary life. The prospect of sitting alone at his apartment for another weekend didn’t sound attractive at all. But what did ordinary people do on a Friday night? And what was a good thing to propose without crossing any boundaries?
John huffed out a laugh. “You can’t be serious, right?” he asked in disbelief, but when he saw Sherlock’s stern look, his grin subsided. “Sherlock, Sarah and I dated for four months; I would hardly call that a… Hold on. Are you jealous? Is that what this is all about?”
Mycroft looked up at John with a serious face. For a moment, he was thinking. Then, he stood up from his chair. "I think we ought to get our own update, then."
I’m starting to crave that balance.
“You have no idea.”
“have you’ve been talking to some of your new colleagues, dear?” Mrs Hudson asked, still smiling at John. “He can be difficult to work with for sure. He can be arrogant and very self-centred. He doesn’t get along with parents, and most of his colleagues find him intimidating. But the children absolutely adore him, and once you get to know him, he’s worth the gold.”
“We need to do something,” Sarah said softly, her effort to not let her emotions get the upper hand clear in her voice.
Before John could ask about it, he felt his gurney move. “We’re ready to go, Mr Watson,” one of the paramedics said and pushed the gurney from the breaks.
They entered the restaurant and were pointed towards a small table by the window. They sat down, John ordered a glass of Merlot, Sherlock just wanted sparkling water, and after a quick look at the menu, they ordered their food. By the time the waiter brought their plates, they were chatting freely about nothing in particular.
“Then I need every case file from all of the victims from the last two years at Baker Street, stat.”
It didn’t surprise John anymore. Of course, Mycroft knew he didn’t go to the hotel last night.
For a long moment, they were silent. Mycroft gave his brother time to pull himself together a bit. When he had, Sherlock turned his head to face Mycroft in search of some reassurance.
“It’s not up for debate, Sherlock. You are going to rest. I don’t care if you’re going to lay down on the sofa or decide to crawl into bed. Hell, for all I care you just lay down on the floor. But you are going to take a break. Doctor’s orders.”
Calling out a name
“John, please,” I gasp when his fingers leave me. He gives me a tentative smile before he reaches for the tube on the bed and lubes himself up. He places himself above me with precision. A moan escapes my lips when I feel him against me.
John didn’t move. He felt foolish. Sherlock had been going through something today, and here he was, yelling at the man for not taking care of himself and threatening him with his big brother if Sherlock didn’t go to sleep. Once again, he was utterly amazed at how much strength Sherlock showed by telling him this. And at the same time, it hurt like hell to hear these things, especially when John couldn’t do anything about it.
John continued after the attention was back on him. “Together, we will make sure you all will have a great year.” He smiled a little. “Now, let’s get started, shall we?”
“Good morning Mrs Hudson, how are you doing today?” Sherlock asked in a perky tone when he and John entered the school on Wednesday morning, and John couldn’t hold his chuckle. It wasn’t every day that he got to see Sherlock this cheerful.
He had said too much and Sherlock knew he couldn’t save himself out of this one. His eyes flickered from Lestrade to the files and back, desperately searching for something he could focus on, but there wasn’t anything around that could comfort him. He was breathing heavily, panting even, as a wave of nausea hit him which he tried to suppress.
“Git,” John answered fondly and opened the menu. He looked at it for a minute. “You sure you don’t want anything?”
“What happened?” John asked.
Sherlock nodded, his eyes avoiding Lestrade’s. He didn’t want the principal to know he was barely holding it together.  He took a deep breath and allowed the mask he so often wore to glide into place again.
“I’m so sorry John,” Molly started, her voice quivering slightly. “I asked how he was doing, and everything was fine, but when I asked how he felt about what happened last year he just… froze. He didn’t say a word, just stood up and walked away. I think I screwed up.”
He stood next to the older Holmes brother. Mycroft kept looking through the window, his attitude professional and distant. It was clear that the emotion John had seen yesterday after the conversation with Sherlock was unintended.
John glanced up at the clock, quickly calculating how long Charly and Kyle were gone. Three minutes, which meant that they should be safely outside and told Lestrade to get an ambulance. The fire brigade should’ve arrived as well to take care of the situation.
At the bottom of the note, there was something written down in a different colour, probably added later:
The examination was quick. Within no time, Dr. Wilson had taken a look at the incisions, had checked Sherlock’s lung capacity and heart rate, and had taken some blood to check the levels. She asked another couple of questions, and soon after that, she seemed satisfied.
John took a sip from his whiskey and looked into the fire, letting the thoughts about the last couple of weeks roam in his mind freely. And suddenly, another feeling struck him. Admiration. Because yet again, Sherlock started to manage to come back from this. John knew it cost him a lot this time, but in the end, Sherlock would win again. And that was just the thing that John frightened the most.
Once he arrived at the door of the principal’s office, John took a brief moment to prepare himself. He checked the collar of his shirt, stood up straight, braced himself and knocked on the door. He heard a “come in” on the other side and entered.
“Yes, Lestrade?”
John stood there, completely grounded for a moment. Then, he grabbed Sherlock’s hand with both of his. He took a deep breath and started to speak, trying to keep his voice as calm and steady as he could. He knew he had to be very clear.
Sherlock didn’t respond right away. His face was still open and relaxed; the corners of his eyes wrinkled step as he gave John a small smile. “Good morning, John.”
John looked at Sherlock. He noticed the desperation in his voice and felt his anger subside a little. Sherlock really had been trying; he could see that. It wouldn’t be fair if John would hold it against him. Also, he really didn’t have the strength anymore to argue with Sherlock again.
“All right,” Lestrade started. “The victim’s name is Tom Brandon, 41 years old. He lives in an apartment in the city centre, no wife, no kids. His family lives in Manchester. He’s a police officer for 17 years, came to our department two years ago when he moved from Manchester to London. We believe he was taken last night since he didn’t show up to work this morning.”
“He’s a colleague of mine.”
John let them have a glance into Sherlock’s room and gave him a moment to accommodate. Lestrade just stood there and said nothing, his face severe and tight. John knew it was hard for him to see one of his friends like this, especially after what they had been through together. Lestrade knew Sherlock long before John did, and although John didn’t know the details, he knew Lestrade had always been there for him.
(the situation of being faced with) something that needs great mental of physical effort in order to be done successfully and therefore tests a person’s ability.
Sherlock shrugged. “In a manner of speaking. It took me less than a minute to guess yours. Not exactly fort Knox.”
“We didn’t know what to do. We know we had to go downstairs, but we couldn’t leave her, so we started yelling and banging on the windows,” Charly added and John saw tears prickle in the corners of her eyes. “Please don’t be mad.”
John’s eyes grew big. “Wow,” he breathed.
John counted, recounted and came to the conclusion that the class was complete. He quickly moved on to the next class, which was his own. Of course, Sherlock had the group perfectly under control. He had asked them to sit down and was chatting with a couple of kids in front of him. When he saw John arrive, he stood up.
“Did it ever occur to you to include me in your plan as well?”
A little late to the party, but come say hi on tumblr if you want!
“Ah.”
Halfway down, John was able to get a better view of the situation. There was no fire yet, which was a relief. But there was a lot of smoke building up at the end of the staircase. He tried to ignore the quick hammering of his heart as he took a deep breath and continued walking down.
Lestrade was the first to speak. “Hey, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s head snapped up, and his eyes met John’s. They held each other’s gaze for a long moment, and John could see and feel Sherlock relax a little. Then, John suddenly remembered last Friday night and let go quickly. He walked back to the table, sat down again and started fidgeting with some papers. Sherlock walked to the desk and sat down behind the laptop.
But John knew that was not the case. If only it were. No, this realisation was much worse. Sherlock didn't want to be helped; he didn't want to be saved. This was Sherlock throwing in the towel.
Sherlock took a deep breath. “If things are getting too difficult, you can go. I can’t ask you to stay. I’ll manage.”
John jumped out of bed right away, turned on the lights, and quickly gathered some clothes. "Have you already called Mycroft Holmes?"
“Don’t finish that bloody sentence!  You are not. Doing. Fine!”
The next day, John had informed Sherlock he thought would be a good idea to deal with the aftermath by going on a holiday. To the other side of the world to visit an old friend, together with Sarah. He had booked two tickets and had packed his bags before Sherlock could convince him not to go. He still tried, though,  which had let to a heated argument where John eventually had forbidden Sherlock to reach out to him for work.
“Well, actually…”
Mycroft saw the hesitation in John’s face and continued. “I could order someone to bring you some clothes. I expect they have a shower somewhere here and there is a cafeteria downstairs.”
“Hello to you too.”
“Well,” John started, suddenly feeling a little unsure about this whole plan. “There are two people who’d like to see you if you are up for it.”
Sherlock didn’t answer and looked down. After a moment, he gave a single nod.
“I’m giving you an out,” Sherlock answered softly, his voice small. He looked down to where he was fumbling with his napkin, unable to look John in the eye. He was sure he had done it. In a moment, John would get up and leave.
John put his contract into his briefcase, said goodbye to Mrs Hudson and walked away from the reception desk. As he walked down the corridors to his new classroom, he couldn’t help but wonder what she had meant.
John snorted in disbelief and threw his hands in the air. “That’s not what I- You know what, never mind. I’m not having this discussion again.”
“You still care about him,” he said after a while.
John walked to the kitchen with the empty cups, placed them in the sink and decided he would clean the rest tomorrow. He put the kettle on, waited for the water to boil and poured himself a cup of chamomile tea hoping to catch his sleep again.
“I don’t… uhm… I think I should go in. ”
“Did you succeed?”
“Doctor Watson, could I have a quick word with you?” the therapist asked and walked to the hallway. John shot a questioning look at Sherlock and followed her.
“The stupid Valentine’s fundraiser at the Met,” I clarify. “Sarah cancelled, and going alone is just pathetic.” I regret my phrasing immediately, knowing Sherlock doesn’t have a date. At least, I suspect he doesn’t. “Sorry.”
“Sherlock relax,” John tried in a calm voice, hoping it would calm Sherlock down a bit. “I’m fine.”
When John entered Sherlock’s room, he became aware of the whole situation. Sherlock wasn’t in his bed but sat in the far corner of the room. How he had managed that, John didn’t know. He sat on the ground with his knees against his chest and with his hands, he gripped his head tightly, covering his ears with the palms. He was muttering something, but John couldn’t understand what he was saying.
Donovan glared at John daringly and narrowed her eyes. “I don’t have to. I know his moves, I know what he’s up to. And I will not fall for that again. Once a freak, always a freak.”
“Yes, I know,” John sighed. “I’m sorry about that. I got held up by someone, and I forgot to text you. I know it’s a lame excuse and not a great start, but-”
“No,” he whispered.
“There’s a woman in your apartment.”
She then squeaked in enthusiasm and pulled him in a tight hug. “Oh, John! It’s so good to see you; it has been ages! What are you doing here? Come in, come in!”
About the time they arrived at the school, it was 7.55, and John was surprised to feel he wasn’t nervous anymore at all. They entered the school together and were greeted by Sally Donovan, who was sitting behind the reception desk and gave the two men a daring look.
The class started to mumble, and John could hear most of the students were disappointed.  He looked at Sherlock questioningly.
“I want to see him.”
Sherlock tried his best to create a reassuring smile. “Yes. Don’t pay for that expensive hotel room of yours if you are not going to use it.”
“Hello, Mrs Hudson,” John said shyly.
“Back already?” Sherlock asked without looking up from his phone.
John stood at the top of the stairs and sighed. He knew this was not a good idea at all. For a moment, he hesitated and tried to think of a last-minute excuse to keep Sherlock from taking this case. But he couldn’t. He didn’t have the heart to do so. Instead, he did the only thing he could do.
“Sounds like a plan.”
John looked over at Sherlock and felt a rush of warmth run through his body. Maybe it was the wine, but he felt something else too, an unfamiliar sensation. He was well aware that there were boundaries between co-workers, ones they could not cross. But the wine made John let his guard down a bit. “So, you don’t have a girlfriend, then?”
Six months. That is how long he would go on a mission in Eastern Europe. John had been waiting, along with Mary. For months he had wondered if he was still alive if he would see him again. But as the months progressed, his hope faded away. Instead, he started to feel empty. It was a downward spiral from there, with the result of him and Mary getting a divorce within the year they got married. Mary took Rosie with her too, but that was a mutual decision. John was okay with it.
“I just don’t know what to think of him,” John sighed.
It would be a matter of seconds before Lestrade and his team would enter the apartment. John knew he couldn’t let the whole team see Sherlock like this. Lestrade was one thing, but the rest of the team wouldn’t understand what was going on and would trigger the wrong things. He made a decision. “I’ll be back in a sec,” he said and walked away from Sherlock to the front door. He stepped outside and closed the door, just in time to keep Lestrade from entering the room.
Sherlock’s head snapped up. “I know,” he immediately responded. Of course, he trusted John. He trusted him implicitly. But he was about to risk everything. “it’s just… hard,” he mumbled.
“Is everything all right?” John asked quietly after a moment. He tried his best to sound friendly.
"I am going to teach you a valuable lesson, one you will remember the rest of your career." John's voice was dangerously calm. He had his hand clenched in fists, the look in his eyes furious. "You don't know a thing about the person lying on the table. You don't know if he's married, if he has children or if he's a criminal. You don't get to decide anything," John told the resident trough clenched teeth.
John let out a surprised chuckle. “Bit not good, yeah.”
When Mycroft didn’t reply, John looked up. He was surprised by the look on Mycroft’s face. His expression was soft, thoughtful. He seemed to look for the right words to say. This was not the cold, distant man John knew. Sure, he tried to be. But there were small things that didn’t seem fitting—using his first name. The tone in his voice. The slightly sad look on his face.
“I deleted it.”
“Yes,” Mycroft answered. He swallowed and tried not to show his emotions. Getting beaten up by his younger brother wasn’t one of his best memories, although he couldn’t blame him for doing so. “That’s why I arranged female assistance instead of male. It was his own choice to take on a male physical therapist, though.”
He took a small sip from his steaming cup of tea and looked through the living room. It was a cosy, small living room with a comfortable couch, an old leather armchair and a large bookcase full of medical books and journals. All the walls were painted off-white, except for the one on the side of the couch. Three large paintings in calm grey tones hung on the forest green wall.
“Really? I thought It was a big improvement. Your mouth’s too small now.” The man waved his hand dismissively and walked back to the desk. The woman just mumbled something and turned around to walk away. John watched her go. He could feel the embarrassment radiating from her and felt a little sorry for her.
Seriously tho... only two more to go and then our journey ends! :(
"Let's start with the questions first, so I have a clear vision of what I'm dealing with here." Patrick didn't look up from the chart. "How accessible is your house? What kind of house is it? Do you have a bath or a shower? How many stairs are there until you reach your bedroom?"
John didn’t need to think twice before agreeing on joining. Grabbing something to drink with his new co-workers was far more exciting than watching sports alone.
And then, there was their new sleeping arrangement. Obviously, Sherlock had noticed their closeness during the night. He didn’t mind in the slightest. In fact, it was the only way Sherlock managed to fall asleep. It felt comforting to have John so near to him, knowing that there was someone who kept an eye on him. He really had tried to keep his distance the first night. But when he woke up the next morning, his body pressed close against Johns; he felt so utterly relaxed that he decided he didn’t care if John knew.
I blink once, twice. “Oh,” is all I manage to say, my throat suddenly dry.
After a long moment, Sherlock spoke. “Because I’m sorry,” he said in a small voice, and John felt his anger ebb away instantly. This wasn’t what he wanted. He didn’t want to get Sherlock into trouble or upset him, on the contrary. He wanted to help him to comfort him. To be his friend.
John looked puzzled. “Why on earth would I do that?”
But Mrs Hudson just reached out to his arm and patted it gently. “I know dear.” Her voice was soft and full of love. “How are you holding up? You look better, a little tired maybe. Is Rosie keeping you up, dear?”
“Goodmorning, Holly. It was fine, thanks,” he replied and tried to suppress a yawn.
Mycroft immediately turned around when he heard John, ignoring the doctor opposite to him. “He was declared legally incapacitated an hour ago. We need a decision on that to do.”
“No,” Sherlock admitted quietly, his gaze now on their joined hands.
“Why?”
“Shit!”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows at that and was about to ask what John meant when something clicked.
It takes him a moment to understand what I’m talking about. He smiles fondly, and I can’t place if it’s directed towards me, or if he smiles at the memory. “No, my uncle’s. He loved to collect old knickknacks on flea markets.” He takes his tie in hand and looks at the pin. “He gave it to me when I graduated. It’s probably worth nothing, but—”
John reached for the door handle before Sherlock could make a move, allowing him to get inside before sliding in on the backseat and closing the door. Sherlock quickly gave the taxi driver the address and the car started to move.
“Do you think he went home?”
“An appointment?”
“Please don’t.”
“He normally doesn’t do that, John,” Mike explained. “He doesn’t give much about his colleagues or his partner. Sure, he’s a great teacher and if you get to know him a nice man as well, but he’s kind of a loner. And a perfectionist, if I might add. The fact that he’s helping you figure things out is saying a lot,” he grinned.
Dr. Wilson walked back to her side of the desk and sat down, but didn’t start right away. She waited and seemed to consider her approach carefully. After a moment, she gave John a small smile before she started speaking. “How’s Sherlock doing? From your perspective, I mean?”
After a long silence, Sherlock spoke. “I thought I wouldn’t be able to see you again.”
Then, John saw it. “Is that my computer?”
Sherlock doesn’t respond. He blinks and attempts to speak, but nothing comes out.
“Okay, stop it right there,” John exclaimed. Sherlock winced at the raise of his voice, but John didn’t seem to notice. “How many times do I have to tell you? I’m not going anywhere unless you tell me you want me to.”
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock smirked a little. “Know what?”
He opened the door to the door to Sherlock’s bedroom without knocking and entered. Sherlock sat on the edge of the bad and was tying his shoelaces. One quick glance was enough for him to know what John was going to say. “Don’t,” he said and stood up to face John.
“Uhm, thanks,” John replied. “What’s on the schedule today?”
"You don't have to, you berk."
Mike gave John nudge in the ribs. “Shall I get the next round then, since you’ve got your mind occupied? Sherlock, what would you like to drink? A beer? Something else?”
Suddenly, noise filled the room. John was startled by the sound. He looked around, but couldn’t quite place it. Then he saw the phone on the desk. Who would call to his room and not to his mobile phone?
“That’s what you’re concerned about? Not about Lestrade?” Mrs Hudson chuckled, and John shot her a look. “Yeah, maybe you do have a point,” she laughed.
“Ah uhm… yes,” John stammered. He was surprised to see that someone was sitting behind the reception desk. “I have an appointment for a job interview?”
Sherlock looked up. “You’ll do just fine,” he said, offering John a reassuring smile. John wanted to reply but was cut off by the loud buzzing of the school bell. He took a deep sigh, walked towards the door, and waited for the first student to arrive.
“Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.”
“Then what was it, Sherlock? Enlighten me.”
“He is, and he gave us a hell of a time last year.” Philip threw his hands up in frustration. “He’s not even supposed to work here anymore!”
John stared out of the small window, his thoughts lingering. Once he had sat down, his mind began racing. He tried to ignore it, but it seemed impossible. To John’s surprise, he didn’t have questions. Those would come later. For now, he was trying to focus on the facts, something he had learned in therapy. In his mind, he went through the list of things he knew: ‘

John hesitated. It didn’t matter how attractive a shower was right now; he didn’t want to leave Sherlock alone. But he also knew he had to take care of himself as well.
Sherlock was getting better and better each day, at least physically. The detox was going well; he would reach zero in three days. He didn't need many medications anymore, and most of the injuries would heal with time. The physical therapist was coming by today to examine Sherlock and give him some exercises and after that Sherlock would be allowed to get out of bed, which was one of the final steps of preparing him to go home. He still had to go to his therapy sessions and checkups, but there would be no medical necessity to keep him at the hospital.

It took John a moment to register the soft gasp. He turned around and looked at Sarah, who was as white as a cloth, her eyes big and full of fear. She looked like she had seen a ghost. “Sarah? What’s wrong?” John tried, but she didn’t reply. He followed her gaze to the burning building and searched for the thing that was upsetting her so much.
The night went on quite uneventful. Once they were home, they started to settle in. John let Sherlock do his own thing, which meant he was cataloguing every corner of every room. John made some tea, and once Sherlock was done roaming around the house, they sat down at the kitchen table together, just enjoying each other’s company.
John shrugged. “Sure.”
Dr. Wilson stood up from her chair, walked to the door and poked her head outside briefly. “Linda, could you bring Mr. Holmes to the plaster room so his cast could be removed? Thank you.” She turned to Sherlock and waited for him to rise from his seat. She held out her hand. “I’ll see you at our next appointment.”
“I would prefer, for various reasons, that my concern went… unmentioned. We have what you might call a ‘difficult relationship’.”
Patrick obliged and backed away a little, a little startled by the sudden turn of events. He stood up and looked at John questioningly.
“We are descending in 10 minutes,” John heard the pilot say through his headset. Mycroft took his phone from his pocket and started texting again. John turned back to the window and continued to enumerate his list of facts once again.
With that, the man just walked away, leaving John and Mike alone in the classroom. John watched the man and only when the door fell into the lock with a click he looked at Mike, who was grinning widely.
Mycroft pointed to the chair opposite the desk. “Please, sit down.”
"There should be an update within minutes, as I requested," Mycroft spoke suddenly. John wasn't surprised that Mycroft had demanded hourly updates, and even though John knew everyone would be incredibly busy, a little part of him was grateful for this request.
For the first time Sherlock had entered the room, he looked up at John. “Yes, please,” he answered.
His phone buzzed with an answer.
John nodded. “Yeah, bit hangover.”
To Sherlock’s surprise, John didn’t say anything. Instead, he fumbled around in his pockets. “Here,” he said and held out a strip of painkillers. “Sorry, I don’t have any water with me.”
But deep down, Sherlock knew that was not what he wanted. He wanted to tell John how he felt, that he liked him, cared for him and wanted to be with him. And not just in a friendly way, but in a more romantic way. If John was amenable, of course. But Sherlock did not have all the facts and to ask John how he felt about him was simply out of the question.
Again, Mycroft nodded, his face still focused on the window with a closed expression. John suddenly realised this was Mycroft trying to keep control of himself and his emotions. It wasn’t he didn’t have any, he just didn’t want to show them.
Mycroft still didn’t move but gave John a piercing look. “Dr Watson, sit,” he ordered again.
“You are a hero; you know that, right?” Lestrade told John and patted him on the shoulder. John lay on a gurney, ready to get to the hospital. He didn’t know what to say, so he just shrugged.
Sherlock desperately thought of something to say. Usually, he was mister punch-line and knew what to say in every possible situation. So how was it that he wasn’t able to form a proper sentence? He kept glancing downward, afraid to look at John directly. If he did, John would certainly know why he was here, and he couldn’t have that. He shifted a little on his feet, unable to shake his nerves. He knew he had to say something. “You weren’t at school today.”
Oof... Poor John, and poor Sherlock...
“Good morning, everybody,” he began in a loud voice. Quickly, it became quiet in the classroom, and all eyes were directed on him.  “My name is Mr. John, and you all know Mr. Sherlock over there.” He pointed in the direction of Sherlock, who sat in the back of the classroom, who gave a small wave.
“I need to know if you want me to let you go because I can’t make that decision for you, I won’t.” John was fighting back his tears now. “But if that’s what you want, I will. I will let you go.”
As John looked closer, he saw that Mycroft was holding his umbrella more firmly than usual. It looked like he needed the umbrella to lean on so he could to keep his balance, which was strange.
“Always. Why?”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows questioningly, but when John walked over to the sofa, he did what he was told. John sat down at the far and gestured Sherlock to lay down again on his lap. Sherlock did, and after a second, he felt one of John’s hands on his shoulder. He finally was able to relax a bit and closed his eyes.
Lestrade was about to say something when Sherlock stormed out of the house. He walked past Lestrade, didn’t wait for John and walked to the street to hail a cab.
“Is that it?” John called after him. The man turned around impatient.
