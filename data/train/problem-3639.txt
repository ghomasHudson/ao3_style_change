allows the doubts he carries round about himself to run the show rule a little more. He gets less confident, more maudlin, with the lowered inhibitions making it more likely for him to indulge in the tactile crap that will actually help.
“Stop being awkward and stand up so I can hug you, asshat,” Dean says. His lungs constrict when Cas does stand up, obviously, and his dumbass pulse picks up when he actually pulls him into a hug, but it’s good, too. Cas clings to him for far too freaking long with his brother stood right there (and probably for the bounds of friendship, but then Cas and those boundaries have always been a little blurred). “You’ll be okay,” Dean says, before he’s properly released him, hands on his arms to keep him looking Dean dead in the eye. “Promise.”

Cas is going to graduate with some kind of fancy ass honours in the summer and is going to do a masters, most likely at Yale, although he's going to be applying at pretty much every college in Sam's list for backup, even though his philosophy professor heavily hinted that he's a shoe in. He was going to live with Meg but he probably won't, now, because six weeks is the longest she's ever pissed off for, and because before she left there was some kind of argument about drugs that Cas refuses to go into. Cas orders a burger with extra bacon at dinner because he's a dude after Dean's heart, and eats it like it's some kind of religious experience. It's the most fun they've actually ever had on a date (a word Dean used once and doesn't regret, that Cas noticeably has not picked up and ran with) because Dean's not actually broke as hell, lying to him or waiting for his life to fall apart. It's good and it's still good when they get back to Cas’ place in the middle of Dean's turn in their unofficial game of twenty questions to find out every single thing about his life. Cas offers him a beer he probably only bought for Dean's benefit, and they're stood in the kitchen smiling at each other as they talk.

That's an unjust assessment of your character -- you do derive joy from the indulgences your life allows you - from good food and good sex - but your real, deep seated joy is routed in the people that you commit yourself too. It's a remarkable thing, Dean, to love your brother like you do. For you to be content to accept your happiness from good pie, good coffee, good water pressure in a shower, as long as your brothers long term goals are assured. You are remarkable, Dean, as you always have been. I am most unwaveringly sucked in. I miss you too.”

It's springy and crappy as hell, but usually he's so dead on his feet that he doesn't care. After ten hours in the kitchen he could sleep on a damn rock. Sleep is a stop gap he engages in inbetween work, so he just never changed it. Cas… Cas complained about it, about most of the crap furniture in the apartment, and he wasn't

“Flustered,” Cas says, tempering the word with a warm smile and a hand to his cheek.
“That's death,” Dean says, “Whatever way you cut it, it still just sucks.”
The only damn reason he’s showing up to his work Christmas drinks - organised and primarily attended by Walt and Roy, and therefore guaranteed to slightly suck - is because Sam’s at Sarah’s (again) and Cas is in California, and it didn’t feel like sitting in his front room and

“Hey,” Dean says, dropping the latest bag of Sam’s belongings that are slowly beginning to take over Dean’s apartment behind the sofa (he’s lugged bag after bag of Sam’s crap up here pretty consistently over the past few weeks, like hell is he unpacking it for the kid too) and pausing to take in the TV show that Cas is currently half-watching as he marks papers. “This has gotta be some Timothy bullcrap, right?”

So we -  it happened.” Dean says, swallowing back that mix of shame and regret that swirls around his head when he thinks about any of this crap. Dean shuts his eyes, and takes another sip of his whiskey. They’re through the worst of the story now, anyway. He might as well goddamn continue, even if it feels like he’s peeling his fucking skin off and… and
“You’re getting married,” Cas continues to John Winchester, like their little deviation didn’t just happen. “Tell us about the lucky woman, presuming of course that it is a woman.”
“You know me, Bobby,” Dean says, “Introspection and the lonely open road? Sign me the hell up.” Bobby snorts. “Seriously, I'm okay,” Dean continues, turning the heat on the frying pan down, “Wish Sam would stop riding my ass so hard, but other than that…”

It’s still warm and comforting, it’s just lacking some of the

“Damnit, Sammy, I — I just hate feeling like I have to be so damn careful, so I, uh, strongly suggested I’d be into something to Cas, and then I lost my head, and I had a panic attack, and he freaked.”
“Still on,” Sam says, “As is Berkeley and Columbia.”
Right now, they don’t even share a bed every night.
Instead, Cas made this wounded noise, broke his space in the line to throw his arms around Dean’s neck and started to fucking cry. He’d been stoic and unreadable when Samandriel read the eulogy, face impassive as they carried in the coffin, and then, seven years after they argued about his damn wedding, Cas was sobbing into his shoulder.

“But…. Your brother was unwell.”

Castiel wakes up alone, which is not unusual. The persistent and apparently ‘unavoidable’ prevalence of early mornings is probably Dean Winchester’s biggest flaw as a boyfriend; or at least, it’s a trait that he’s yet to ever find endearing. Especially given Dean considers a day and a half off in the middle of the week an adequate substitution for a weekend and even on those days still insists on waking up before Castiel would generally wake up on the days that he’s working at the office. He feels, very strongly, that it his mission in life to ensure that Dean actually sleeps (or at the very least, stays in bed)  past nine AM at least once a month and he is prepared to use all moves in his arsenal to that goal, including that thing with his tongue, butchering the concept of breakfast in bed and hiding all the clocks and telling Dean that it’s still three AM.

And then Sam comes barreling into the from room saying “Dean, you —-”
“And you’re adding to the expense via a transatlantic phone call,”
. Dean’s actually pretty sure that he knows what’s going in the guy’s head and his memory foam mattress has never been more comfortable.
When they get back in, he avoids as many Miltons as possible and heads upstairs to take a long shower, mostly to get some distance (finding somewhere to be alone in this place is a damn miracle) and also to centre himself, physically. The key to making sure this shit is in control after talking about it is trying to get himself in his body rather than his head, so turning up the shower till it’s just shy of scolding helps and spending a little too long scrubbing every inch of him clean is a good strategy. He gets fully dressed into pyjamas before he leaves the bathroom (went out and bought them, because no damn way is he walking around with his scars on show with this many of Cas’s brothers around) and tries to prepare himself for the reality of spending the damn night on the shitty bottom bunk, hearing Cas breathe but being too far away to touch him.
“Yeah,” Dean says, “The guys in the restaurant cheered. Charlie tried to make me come out and take a fucking bow, till I reminded her about the whole covid crap.”
to cool down, but now it’s engulfing guilt and this crappy sense of failure. He’s always hated disappointing Cas. It’s always had this ability to feel like a puncture wound and it’s worse now, because Cas has been so deliberately patient lately. He’s been a fucking saint and Dean is a jerk, as well as being a fucking mental patient. Obviously, even just having Cas back in his life is worth all of this crap, without taking into account the fact that Cas kisses him, holds him, lives with him, loves him.

“How was it?”
Charlie calls while he’s waiting for the coffee to brew and trying not to overthink what’s going to happen when average height, dark and handsome comes out of his bedroom and Dean has to think about the fact that, four hours ago, he was lost in the feel of the guy’s stubble against his skin as they kissed, hot and clumsily and desperate to get somewhere. That he drank his way to enough dutch courage for him to voice, out loud, what he wanted and, damn, did nameless guy deliver.

“You will not dissuade me from complimenting you.”
Cas is, and then his name had come up on his phone, so he figures she’ll have worked it out. “Hey. Glad you called.”
Things were so damn hard, he just wanted to make them easier.

And I guess that —- fuck, Cas, I don’t even know how I want him to react. If he kicked off, at least… at least he’d treat me like my own fucking person. Not expecting a gruff Bobby style

In all honesty, he’d rather be literally anywhere else than clogging up the Milton’s just outside of LA  kitchen, feeling a little like he’s on trial while everyone else is having a family moment. They’ve driven down for a couple of weekends before since they started this up again, which were all instruments in making Dean feel awkward and tense and uncomfortable but made Cas happy, and he’d kinda thought that the other, wedding-type focuses would be a helpful distraction, but mostly he just feels like a spare part.

Dean’s on some crazy-ass shift pattern because they’re completed fucked, nurse wise, and Dean’s a sucker who can’t say

“Tease,” Dean drawls, which has Cas narrowing his eyes and slotting their mouths together. He kisses like he’s serious about everything, cradling Dean’s face with one hand with the other tangled up in his hair, which is definitely okay by Dean. He tastes like coffee edged with toothpaste, which means he must have taken a moment in his pit-stop to the bathroom and to get coffee to freshen himself up which is both polite and pretty presumptuous. Dean kind of assumed he’d just leave, but he’s not going to turn down a little extra warmth.

“Yep.”
"You've been persistently telling me we don't," Cas says, the soft heat of this thumb tracing over Dean's jaw, memorising the stubble Dean hasn't dealt with yet. Cas' fascination in it makes him not want to and he hasn't entertained sentiments like that for another person since frigging high school. Right now, looking at him feels like sticking a hand in his own stab wound.

“Very drunk,” Balthazar says, tripping Castiel up with one foot so he stumbles. “Isn’t that right, Cassie?”

It won’t win him any michelin stars, but as a breakfast it should be okay. “You want more coffee?”

“I’m doing it,” Dean shrugs, “Don’t know about great, but it’s happening."
“Benny, come inside,” Cas says, all business and hard angles.
Cas is still on the phone to his mother - in the study, which probably means the conversation’s a total shit show - when their food arrives.

His TV turns on to the cartoon network and the remote is down the side of one of the couch cushions.
