Dean explained why the hospital had called, and Cas flushed a deep crimson when he realized the mix-up with the emergency contact.
“We would hate for our baby girl to grow up without her uncles around,” Eileen said, one hand on her belly.
Cas stared at him with wide, watery blue eyes and Dean’s resolve strengthened. He squared his shoulders and went to the spare room to pack his bag.
“You little shit,” Cas muttered, as he pulled the cat off the bookshelf and set her back on the floor. “Here, I have tuna.”
He would inevitably head to work the next morning feeling a bit sad, and then guilty about the fact that he was feeling sad. He really was happy for them.
“Yes, it’s still frowned upon. Though heaven isn’t exactly operational now. I think it would be difficult to enforce at present…” he trails off, then looks up at Dean. “You should know, it was never about me. They would have killed you too.”
Cas was hard. Thicker than Dean expected, and curved just slightly at the end. He stared, enraptured, stroking him steadily, letting his thumb slide across the head.
Dean freezes, caught off guard. The tone is cloyingly sweet, and he grins a little. They’ve barely exchanged words and now he’s calling him
Cas made a careful nest of some spare blankets in the corner of his room. He fluffed a pillow and put it in the middle, and, with a final stroke of inspiration, turned on a heating pad to put underneath.
The happy couple walked away hand in hand, fingers interlaced. Dean and Cas headed in the opposite direction, back to Cas’s penthouse. Dean chanced a couple of glances down at Cas’s hand swinging between them. His own hand itched to see what it might be like to join hands like Sam and Eileen had. The other hand gripped tightly to the divorce papers Sam had printed off for them before they left.
“It’s a little funny,” he said, still chuckling. “And look, you were just defending yourself anyway.”
And then finally—finally—Cas was nudging at his entrance. Dean squeezed his eyes shut and Cas inched forward, inch by agonizing inch. He had just barely breached him and Dean let out a short gasp at intensity of the stretch. Cas stilled and ran his hands soothingly over Dean’s ass, kneading and stroking.
Dean’s hands flew up to cover his eyes. “I’m sorry, Cas. I need to clear my head.” He turned and stumbled out the door.
Dean was staring back at him, a frown beginning to pull at his features the longer Cas remained silent and ogling him.
The backdrop of his childhood fantasies involved a much nicer place though, Dean muses, as he hacks away at tile grout. Their bargain house is kind of falling apart, and “fixer-upper” is a little too generous.
The pause timed out on the movie then, and the television came on. It was tuned to a documentary channel and the droning voice of a British narrator bellowed through the speakers making them both jump. Cas scrambled to turn the volume down and Dean scrambled to his feet, shuffling to adjust himself so his hard-on wasn’t visible.
“Right, okay.” Dean cleared his throat, and willed himself to concentrate, did his best to steady his shaking hands. The worst of the pain seemed to have eased when the knife was removed, but Cas still flinched a little at the first touch of the needle, the end of his wing thumping once against the floor, but he bit his lip and was silent.
The cabin is remote; there’s nobody but the two of them for miles. Castiel is glad that if he has to spend the summer alone and injured, then at least he’s with Dean. They’ve been best friends since the fourth grade when Dean’s family first moved to town. Dean was instantly popular. The other kids loved the brash, flirty, confident Dean Winchester, who never backed down from a dare. Castiel loved that Dean too, of course. But he especially loved the scared, uncertain boy who was smart and kind and loyal.
"Hey, so I don’t have any of my stuff,” Dean said. He looked down at his apron-clad body and smirked. “Clearly. Uh, can I borrow your phone? I have a bone to pick with my brother."
“Sure I do. I can pick up extra shifts at the garage, and I’m due for a pay raise in February anyway. You can do freelance work when tax season rolls around. And I was thinking maybe we could rent out the spare bedroom.”
A few moments passed, and when Castiel didn’t start the car, the cat turned to return his stare, her tail twitching.
“Who’s making me coffee?” Dean groans, as he rolls over and tucks his gun away. His voice is low and hoarse with sleep, and he buries his face in his pillow in a huff.
The cat sneezed again. “And they’ll be able to check her out. Take care of those sniffles,” Cas added.
They stumbled a few more feet down the hall and Cas managed to pin Dean to the wall on the other side of the hallway. He moved one knee between Dean’s legs and ground himself against Dean’s hip, letting out a low, stuttering moan.
“Right.” Charlie nods her head at Cas. “He won’t shut up about you, you know. All I ever hear is Dean this, Dean that.”
“Right, um. . . close your eyes, I guess,” Dean says. He shimmies back further into the couch and slides his pants midway down his thighs.
In the days and weeks that follow, Castiel grows bolder. He let his mouth roam lower each time, taking Dean’s balls in his mouth and licking his perineum. Even though Dean tenses each time, he allows it. And soon, he encourages it, spreading his legs wider and making full-throated noises of pleasure. When Cas first licks tentatively at his hole, Dean’s entire body spasms and his legs clamp together around Castiel’s head. When he’s able to work his tongue inside, Dean lets out a wail and comes harder than Castiel thought possible.
John cleared his throat from the other side of the table. “Maybe he was bisexual,” he grumbled. Both Bobby and Cas turned to stare at him, mouths agape.
It has always been about protecting Dean. The angels would have come for him and hunted him down. Once he was out of the way they would have gone after Dean and Cas wouldn’t have been able to keep him safe.
Cas supplied Dean with his laptop and some blank CDs, and Dean spent the next hour playing dozens of songs for him and carefully selecting his favourite to burn to a CD.
"Keep an eye out for any suspicious activity," Sam reminded them as they made their way through the throng of party goers.
Cas stared. He lowered the frying pan, but still held it in a death grip in front of him with both hands.
Sam rolled his eyes, but smiled, and held up his camcorder, ready to hit play. Dean let out a sigh of relief and reached out to squeeze Cas’s hand again.
couples things. And when they broke up, Cas would leave, and Dean can’t bear the thought of seeing Cas walk out of his life for good.
the marrying type. Hookups? Casual sex? These were the sort of relationships Dean knew how to do well. But the thought of settling down with one person forever filled him with a icy dread. No, Dean had sworn off love for good, hardened his heart, and knew with certainty that the apple pie life was not for him. He couldn’t be married.
It’s soft, and tentative, and when Dean freezes beneath him, Cas pulls back quickly and rests his forehead against Dean’s. He’s finally done it, he realizes, as he squeezes his eyes shut tight. He’s found the point of no return and crossed it. He’s gone too far, pushed Dean too much, and now Dean’s going to shove him away.
When Mary leaves to help the twins with a hunt she pulls Castiel aside before she goes and thanks him.
Dean sighed. “I really fucked up last night. I’m sorry.” He looked first at Eileen then at Sam imploringly.
Unless Dean was very much mistaken, he was the little spoon in this arrangement. Had he the strength, he might have protested more, but all he could manage was just to lay there, panting, and waiting for the ringing in his ears to fade away.
“And I’ll reiterate: we are. We’re real, Dean. I promise you that. And you are more than the sum of your parts. You’re Dean Winchester. You and your brother? Frankly, God doesn’t stand a chance.”
Her voice dropped low and secretive. “You two are the cutest damn couple I’ve ever seen come through here,” she whispered. “And I see a lot of couples.”
Castiel realized he’d been staring far too long without saying anything when Dean’s face fell and the bright, eager look in his eyes slipped away.
Dean thinks about confessing to Cas. He thinks of all the various grand, elaborate gestures he could make. But what if Cas says no? Cas could reject him outright, and Dean isn’t sure his heart could survive that. And then where would they be? Awkward and uncomfortable, no doubt. Cas would probably distance himself, and Dean would be too embarrassed to protest, until they grew apart so much that they just slipped out of each other’s lives altogether.
“Damn right you do,” said Bobby. “You go. Don’t worry about anything here. Your job is always here if you want to come back to it. And if not, well, that’s okay too,” he said emphatically. “I’ll keep an eye on your daddy. Go on.”
Halloween had always been Castiel’s favourite time of the year. He loved watching the leaves turn colour and crunch underfoot. The crisp air that carried the smell of winter always made him want to curl up with a cup of tea and a good book. And he loved the theatrics of Halloween: the skeletons and ghosts that hung from porches, carved pumpkins alight with candles. It was all so magical.
Back at the motel, Dean ushered Cas into a chair. He’d managed to get out of the lab coat and Dean cut away his clothes, baring him to the waist. His wings looked as though they could stretch the span of the whole room, but Cas pulled them into himself and they hung grazing the floor. Dean pulled another chair around to face him, dropped the first aid kit onto the table next to them, and began setting out the needle and thread.
And, because books didn’t always sell like they should, he also sold various oddities that gave his store the air of an old-time apothecary: amulets, herbal remedies, natural bath products, quills, pretend hex bags. They were all trinkets, but with the atmosphere he created, he had cultivated a small following of admirers, and people often travelled from surrounding areas to visit his store.
Dean heard the click of the lube bottle for the umpteenth time, and then a new sound: the crinkling of a condom wrapper. His heart began to pound faster in anticipation.
“Dean,” Cas murmured, and Dean had never before heard his name uttered with such affection and desire– and Cas was leaning in further still.
Dean has not always been such a deep sleeper. After Castiel pulled him from hell all those years ago, Dean hadn't slept well at all. He almost always slept fully clothed and often left his boots on as well. Castiel hadn't realized straightaway that this had been unusual behaviour. He himself didn't need sleep, and while he understood well enough that it was a human requirement, he hadn't fully appreciated all the rituals of nightfall.
He heard the shower running, and images of Cas started running through his mind on a loop. Cas peeling off sweaty clothes. Water running down his body, over his thighs.
“I like driving alright?” snapped Dean. Cas was looking at him with a soft expression again and Dean rolled his eyes.
This was not good. This was not shaping up to be a quick and easy fuck. Not that they’d even managed to get to the fucking part. Dean sighed.
“I have pictures!” Eileen said excitedly, and shoved her phone at Dean. His eyes bugged out and he scrolled through her photos frantically. It was one thing for Cas to have photographic evidence, but just how many other people had to bear witness to his night of debauchery? He thought of the photos Cas took back at his place where Dean had been naked and eager and he flicked through the photos faster, panic beginning to set in. Many of the pictures were the same as what he’d seen on Cas’s phone that morning, albeit not nearly as blurry. Mercifully, Dean was clothed in all of them and the string of photos ended before they got more x-rated. He let out a sigh of relief and passed the phone back to Eileen who was grinning.
And so it went. In the end, Bobby softened like Dean knew he would. He promised to check in on John and keep an eye on him until Dean got back. Dean, for his part, was careful to only tell Bobby about one Vegas wedding. After all, his was being annulled soon, so it didn’t really count anyway.
“Sure.” Dean shuffled a little to one side and Cas moved in. He passed the spatula over to Cas, then leaned around him from behind, taking his hand in his to guide him.
Dean arrived home in Lawrence in the early hours of the following morning. The house was dark and he let himself in quietly, not wanting to wake his father. John was passed out on the couch, the TV blaring, and empty beer cans decorating the floor around him. Dean sighed, and made to lift the half full can from his father’s outstretched hand before it fell and spilled everywhere.
"Cas?" Dean gave his shoulder a desperate squeeze. Cas winced, and the relief that flooded through Dean was palpable. It was only then that Dean realized that the wings were… wings. Not the etched shadows he had seen on dead angels before, but actual feathered wings. Huge and jet black, with a deep iridescent blue along the tip of each feather. He pulled back, suddenly reticent to touch them, unable to do anything but stare in complete awe.
Dean grinned. "Oh, I don't know, Sam. College girls? Sexy Halloween costumes? You may have to twist my arm on this one."
“Jesus, Cas!” Dean swore and nearly fell out of bed. “Not any less creepy when you’re an amphibian.”
“Oh no. When he gets out, he’ll be in the ICU. Because you’re not family, you won’t be able to see him until we’re certain he’s stable. I suggest you go home, get some sleep, and come back tomorrow rested.”
Dean nearly tripped over himself in his haste to answer. “Cas?!” he shouted into the phone excitedly.
Dean opened the envelope further and a photo fell out. Cas’s chin came to rest on Dean’s shoulder and they both peered at it, then back up at Sam and Eileen.
“Shakespeare was clearly gay,” Cas said. “He writes to a lovely male youth in the sonnets: But thy eternal summer shall not fade,” he recited. “That’s completely gay! You can’t possibly deny that.”
“I’m a freelancer,” he said. “I don’t have an office to go to, and there’s not often a lot of reason to leave the apartment.”
He slid out of bed as quietly as he could muster and snuck to his bedroom door. He opened it just a crack, and placed his ear to the opening, straining to hear. He distinctly heard a cupboard door opening and closing, then a drawer being pulled open and cutlery rattling. Someone was in his house and rifling through his kitchen. Was he being robbed?
He wakes the next morning with no small amount of trepidation, not sure what to expect from Dean. He’ll probably want to avoid talking about it. Maybe he’ll even be angry. Maybe Dean will be so disgusted by what they did that he won’t be able to look at him and Castiel isn’t sure he’d be able to bear that.
“No, it’s fine,” Cas said. “You told me about your family. It’s actually...well, let’s just say we have some things in common.” He cleared his throat. “My family is very religious, so…” he trailed off and looked at Dean expectantly.
Cas moved lower down, nuzzling at Dean’s balls again. One hand moved to wrap around his cock, stroking him up and down, as Cas sunk lower still and licked a wet stripe along his perineum. Dean swore loudly, and his whole body clenched.
At first, John hadn’t taken too kindly to the news that his oldest son was bisexual; but as time passed, he had started to come around. The last time Dean and Cas came to visit in Lawrence, a man in a diner passed their table where they were holding hands and sneered at them in disgust. John punched the guy out cold. It was a considerable setback for John’s anger management therapy, but Dean appreciated the gesture all the same.
Castiel sighs. “Guy who played in On The Road? I made you watch it? Look, I’m fine. So just shut up and drop your pants. Or are you too chicken for your own dare?”
Dean looked down at the table and the meal that Cas had so carefully ordered and arranged for them, then up at Cas himself, and his heart broke. Cas looked nothing like the man that Dean had woken up next to only a few days earlier. He looked like he had had all the life sucked out of him. Dean had done that to him, he realized with a pang. And that’s when he made up his mind.
“I guess I’ll have to call Sam at some point,” Dean said. He looked at his phone, wondering again if he should just man up and call him. But the last text from Sam had contained the sort of language reserved for when he was truly pissed off, so Dean was wary.
Dean bit his lip. “Cas, this is… Jesus, look at you.” He struggled to tear his eyes away from the graceful arc of wings. “You’re an
If you're so inclined, I'd appreciate any feedback of the good or bad variety. Constructive criticism is completely welcome! This is my first time writing anything longer than a coda, so I'd like to be able to take your suggestions and improve for next time.
"The vampire could be any one of these people," Cas said, voice low in Dean's ear. "How are we supposed to know?" He scowled irritably. "And I don't understand why people want to dress up like monsters. There's nothing glamourous or sexy about zombies, Dean."
“Cas, you didn’t… I… nnngh.” With a groan, Dean shoves Cas back a little and blinks away the haze of his arousal.
“Just what?” Cas asked. “Strolled into a wedding chapel as complete strangers and posed for wedding photos?”
for all that long. The enormity of sharing his life like this with Cas still catches him off guard sometimes and leaves him breathless. It’s everything he’s ever wanted, but a part of him never really expected he’d get to have it.
In the end, he decides the not knowing will kill him more than the pain of seeing, and he’s slamming the car door more forcefully than he’d intended and stalking towards the motel entrance, oblivious to the cold December air, past the other parked cars and the storefronts and the—
“Hm, yeah about that,” Dean said, nudging Cas’s shoulder with his own. He took a deep breath and reached down to take Cas’s hand in his, threading their fingers together. Without looking back up, he mumbled, “Maybe you could draw us together next time?”
Dean had been asking himself the same question. “I don’t know. It’s just— after our mom died, it was just me and him. I guess I thought there’d be more time before we were at this point.”
“Cas, please.” Dean forces himself to look at Cas, to let Cas see him. He’s ready to vibrate out of his skin with how badly he needs this—needs Cas—needs something that’s just them right now. “Just… please.”
Sam looked up when he returned, and Dean folded the page he’d torn out carefully, slipping it into the bowl of spell ingredients that Sam had assembled.
Dean ran through all of Cas’s injuries in his head, cataloguing them, feeling the pain of each one as if they had happened to him. Lacerations and fractures could be fixed, he reasoned. A collapsed lung sounded scary, but Dean didn’t really know what that meant. What scared him most was the one thing he recognized: a head injury. A boy he’d played football with in high school had gone down the wrong way during a bad play and suffered a head injury. He was in a wheelchair now.
“Everything we’ve ever done, everything we are, is because Chuck wrote it that way. It’s worse than I thought, Cas. I can’t even pick a damn lock, anymore. I—I’m not even sure I know who I am.”
“I was just talking to my baby here. Ain’t she beautiful? Hey there, sweetheart.” He strokes his hand along the car’s hood again.
He’s distracted — crouched down in the dirt trying to figure out whether a large leafy thing is a viable plant or just a weed — when he hears his neighbour call out to him in a low voice.
There was a shuffling sound, and then Sam's voice was much more awake. "Dean? Why are you calling from Cas's phone?"
“I’m sorry,” he continued. "I should never have left you like that. I was just—scared, I guess. But I can’t stop thinking about you, Cas. You drive me crazy. You’re this weird, dorky, guy, and it doesn’t make any sense. But I—" Dean faltered, as Cas finally looked up at him, his blue eyes piercing and unreadable.
He clicked to the next track, and the next. Bubbly, peppy pop songs filled the room and Dean groaned. This was not at all what he had in mind when he had told Cas to update his playlists. He moved the disc changer to the next CD and Zeppelin came through the speakers. Much better. He flicked ahead to the next track, which Dean recognized, and unless he was very much mistaken, this particular ordering of songs was…
He slid off the couch to kneel on the ground in front of Cas. He dug around in his pocket, swearing a little under his breath when he couldn’t find it, but grinned triumphantly when he finally pulled his hand out, holding up his mother’s ring.
Outside, the sun has come up and the rain has turned into large, wet snowflakes. It’s beautiful, but only Baby sees its splendour. Neither Dean nor Castiel pay the world outside any mind.
Cas watches in unfettered amazement as Dean comes apart and collapses with a loud groan into the stickiness between them. His body shudders violently once and then goes perfectly still. Cas holds him tight, smoothes the hair back from his sweaty forehead, and places a kiss to his hairline.
Cas shrugged. “I’ve always been very fond of languages.” His long fingers moved in intricate motions too fast for Dean to catch. Dean watched in fascination, his heart swelling at the smile that broke out on Sam and Eileen’s faces in response.
While Cas remains rooted to the spot and as monosyllabic as he always is in the mornings before coffee, Dean putters about packing a brown bag with an apple and the leftovers from last night. He shoves it into Cas’s hands and ushers him towards the door.
“Yes!” he nearly shouted, a split second too late and much too loudly. “Yes…” he said, more quietly. He swayed closer into Cas’s warmth and was met with lips against his. Though he couldn’t see him, he could feel Cas smiling.
He was dimly aware of a shout and a bone deep groan from somewhere behind him before he collapsed face-down in a heap, his own stickiness smearing beneath him. Cas landed warm and heavy on top of him, but managed to roll them both to one side slightly so that he was curled tightly around Dean’s back. He could feel Cas’s stubble between his shoulder blades as his face burrowed in and his gasping breath fell hot and heavy on his skin.
A clamor behind them. "Holy shit, dude!" Dean looked up to see that a college kid had appeared in the doorway. Others crowded behind him. "That was some fucking incredible special effects."
Cas shrugs. "I didn't like that I was coming home from work in such a foul mood all the time and dumping that on you. Spending some time here after work helps me to unwind and Meg here doesn't seem to mind my bad moods much."
“I’ve thought about it, and I don’t think I can wait to watch the next one,” Cas announced. “We can do this later, can’t we?”
“Yeah, that’s when I called you. We figured we had Little Red, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty and I thought of that case we worked in Maple Springs. Cas scoured the hospitals like you said, looking for anyone else in a coma, especially kids. And I Iooked into recent deaths in the area for anything that might seem like vengeful spirit material.
Dean comes apart beneath him. His moans fill the room, and his bandaged hands grapple at Castiel’s back. Castiel wishes he could feel Dean’s nails drag down his spine, that their marks might leave him with something — anything — after this is over. While Dean lets loose a stream of colourful expletives, Cas remains stoically quiet but for his laboured breathing, too afraid of what words may escape were he to open his mouth.
“Thanks,” Sam said brightly, and Eileen patted him on the arm in agreement. “I’m not doing family law though, which is why I don’t know this too well. I’m more interested in civil rights or environmental law.”
Dean didn’t say anything. He didn’t cry, and he didn’t collapse into a chair. He just.. stood there, staring at the woman who was shattering his whole life into tiny little pieces. He almost laughed, because yeah, Cas was his whole life. He could see it now. He could see their lives together, could see what might have been if he’d stayed. And now...
Castiel frowns, trying to remember what happened between then and now. The unaccounted time is disturbing. He must have died, but if so, how was he brought back this time?  He huffs and looks around more closely. He is definitely on Earth, judging by the visceral feel of the sun on his face and the grass underfoot.
“It was the only way I could reach you,” Cas frowned. “And these aren’t exactly the real things either,” he said with a sigh. “They’re sort of a… manifestation, and will remain as such until they’re fully healed, I think. The real ones are much larger, but don’t translate to this plane of existence while I’m contained to a vessel. They’re more vulnerable when materialized this way. More… sensitive.”
Castiel looked up and was worried to see Dean’s expression had turned serious as well. This was it. Dean was going to say everything was over. They couldn’t possibly be friends anymore, not after all this.
“Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak?” came a call from the chapel. Dean looked up and turned in his seat, nearly falling out of it in nervous excitement. “We’re ready for you!”
Cas looked up and frowned at Dean’s untouched plate. “What, does it surprise you that I’m gay? We did wake up in bed together.”
He let go, and peered over Cas’s shoulder as he made to flip the first omelette. They were so close that Dean could have rested his chin on Cas’s shoulder, could have wound his arms around his waist. He cleared his throat and carefully angled his hips away.
“Oil gland,” Cas said, breathlessly. He pulled at Dean’s sticky hand, guided it down between them and Dean meant to laugh, meant to make some joke about Cas having the preparedness of a boy scout, but Cas thrust up and the laughter died on his lips, replaced with embarrassingly needy whine.
“Don’t be. We’ve both had worse.” Dean smiles and Cas lifts his head more carefully this time to gently kiss the bump that’s forming on Dean’s forehead.
Dean trips over the chair leg when he stands up and Cas catches his elbow. He ignores the way the wrinkles between Cas’s eyes etch themselves deeper in concern— but he doesn’t fight it when Cas keeps holding on, leaning into Cas’s warmth as they make their way down the hall.
Dean’s dick throbbed, swinging with every insistent thrust from Cas. He made to reach down but Cas swatted his hand away, and Dean whined. Slowly, the arm around Dean’s waist moved lower, trailing through the come and fresh pre-come that had smeared on Dean’s stomach. It inched closer, but just shy of where Dean wanted it, and he let out a loud, desperate moan. Any inhibitions he may have had vanished in a flash and Dean found himself begging.
“He lured me here,” Dean grumbled. “He lured me here for a goddamn wedding. And hell, isn’t he supposed to ask my permission first or something? Shouldn’t he have told me before now? How did he expect I’d react to that?!”
Cas was hurt, and Dean wasn’t there. His mind wandered as terrible scenes flashed before his eyes. Cas lying broken and helpless. He squeezed his eyes shut tight, but it couldn’t block out the paralyzing terror he felt.
Cas frets about Dean's allergies and flinches every time he sneezes, but Dean insists it's not that bad, and asks Cas to tell him about the cats, curious to learn what's captured his attention these past few weeks.
And damn if Dean didn’t miss that voice. He grinned then, like an idiot, his smile stretching so wide it made his face hurt.
Their furnace is turned down to save on the gas bill, but snuggled together they barely notice. The weird noise has stopped, too. Evidently the only thing wrong was that it needed a new filter.
“Oh thank God,” Dean groaned, and slammed his book shut. Cas perked up, and looked curiously at Sam.
“Dean, I’m going to come. I’m coming! I—” His body seizes as Dean pulls back, and Cas lets out a low growl. “Fuck. . . Dean. . .”
Dean’s own voice sounds small and scared when he manages to speak again— manages to isolate the one part in all of this that he’s been able to process. “All this time… why didn’t you say something, Cas?”
Cas pulled Dean’s hand away and pulled his own pants partway down. He lined their hips up again, and their cocks slid together, slippery with pre-come. Dean’s head fell back against the wall with a loud thump and he let out an embarrassingly high pitched keen. He had to squeeze his eyes tightly shut at the overwhelming sensation and panicked slightly at the realization that this could all be over a little too quickly. Desperately, he thought of Sam’s farts and Bobby’s dirty underwear, and he breathed in and out carefully until he had better control of himself.
Normally she’d appreciate the affection, but right now she’s just annoyed. Dean gets out, pulls his jacket tight against him to shield from the wind and sleet, and does a quick check under her hood. He pokes and prods, but finds nothing. A few moments later he slides back inside, shivering, and dripping rain all over her upholstery.
Sam offered to display it in the store for Halloween, and spent the rest of the morning making an elaborate window display, complete with an animated cauldron made to look like the broomstick stirring it was moving on its own.
Today though, Dean didn’t feel free or alive. He felt like shit. The drive seemed to go on forever; certainly much longer going back home than it had been coming. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was headed in the wrong direction.
Dean’s head snaps up, and just like that, he’s lost whatever upper hand he may have had. If, in fact, he ever had one at all.
“Mmm.” Cas has reached one hand down to his pants where he’s tracing a finger along Dean’s growing erection and fumbling with the button.
They texted regularly, and even skyped every week or so. Eileen often joined in and Dean grew to love her more and more each day. Sam seemed truly happy, and more relaxed with her than he had ever seen him before. Eileen would lean into Sam unconsciously, Sam’s arm would wrap around her, and he would get this dopey grin on his face whenever she wasn’t looking. It was cute as hell to watch, but it always left Dean with a peculiar sort of ache in his chest whenever he was faced with their easy intimacy with one another.
“What do you think?” He grinned down at the cat who was staring at the makeshift bed with apprehension. “Go on, try it.” He nudged the cat, but she dug her claws into the carpet and wouldn’t budge. “Oh, for heaven’s sake.” Cas leaned down to pick the cat up, but as he tried to set her down into the blankets, her forepaws clung around his neck and dug into his t-shirt.
Cas still hadn’t said anything, just continued to stare. It was unsettling. But after a few moments, Cas straightened and said, “How about breakfast?”
“Hey, Cas?” Dean said, shutting yet another drawer. “When we get you back to normal, I was thinking maybe we should get you some things you can call your own. Some books, maybe? Would you like that? A fluffy blanket and a—”
Dean shivered at the bold intensity of Cas’s words and the truth he knew they contained. But he quickly suppressed it, snorted instead. “I’m not some delicate flower here, Cas. You’re not going to break me.”
The rest of the afternoon and well into the evening passed in a blur. Dean found the nearest bar and drank. When the bartender cut him off, he moved on to the next. At the third bar he went to, he caught sight of a cute brunette sitting at the other end of the counter. She licked her stir stick enticingly, and Dean was all in.
“Cas, I don’t need you to— shit, your hands are warm! That’s— wow, yeah. That’s nice.” Dean shuffles across the bench seat closer to Castiel, leaning into his warmth.
Cas squints up at him and Dean shrugs. “Come on. Get your rodent and let’s go home. It’ll be just like the sleepovers we had when we were kids.”
Cas nipped the side of his ear and continued to flick his nipple relentlessly. He finally wrapped a firm hand around Dean’s dick and growled into his ear.
A flicker of guilt passes over Cas’s face. "I know. But I like it here. And I like being able to come home to you without the cloud of the office hanging over me all the time. I guess I’ve been keeping it to myself because I didn’t know how to tell you how unhappy I’ve been at work lately."
An hour to Kansas City. Three hours or so by plane to Vegas. Four, maybe five hours before he could be at the hospital later tonight. Five agonizing hours in which Cas might not make it through surgery. If he drove, he wouldn’t be there until nearly lunchtime tomorrow, by which time…
Cas frowned and looked down at himself as if to confirm, then back up at Dean. “An astute observation,” he said, a little warily.
“Shut up,” he said gruffly, but without malice. He wiped his last piece of toast through the ketchup smears on his plate, licked the crumbs from his fingers, and chugged down the last of his coffee. Turns out the strawberries had been fucking delicious.
Dean’s fingernail grazes over his slit and Cas jolts upward. Unfortunately it’s the precise moment that Dean has chosen to lean down and their heads bump together with a dull thump. Cas is mortified, but Dean bursts out laughing and then kisses him hard. He pulls back to examine the spot where they collided.
The momentary confusion cost the monster dearly, and seconds later its head was sliced clean off. Sam stood behind it, chest heaving, blood splattered across his forearms, as the demonic smoke furled upwards and out of the room.
“Sam, I–” he started, but Sam cut him off and Dean figured that was for the best. He ruined everything, always.
Castiel’s jarred out of his thoughts as Dean starts ambling closer to him. He’s so close now that Castiel has to look up from where he’s sitting to meet Dean’s gaze.
Dean gives it a long moment, savouring the look on Castiel’s face, before he finally clears his throat.
“Dean?” His thumbs stroke over Dean’s hands where he holds them and Dean lets his head fall to Cas’s shoulder with a muffled groan.
“Oh, I know!” Dean said, suddenly remembering the spider that had taken up residence on one of the kitchen shelves that Cas has absolutely forbade him to kill. Sometimes, Dean caught him talking to it when he didn’t think Dean could hear him.
“Yeah Cas, we can be done. We’re done. C’mere.” He pats the space next to him on the bed. Cas hesitates in the doorway for a moment, his hands in fists at his side. Dean pats the bed again and Cas seems to jolt out of some kind of stupor, and this time he comes, collapsing in a heap on the other side of the bed.
They’d managed to pull the knife out, but the wound was deep and required stitches. Sam had stayed behind to clean up and burn the body, so the job of suturing had fallen to Dean. The angle meant Cas couldn’t contort his body to do it himself.
He opened his bedroom door and the cat, who had been leaning heavily against it, came tumbling into the room and landed clumsily at his feet. She looked up at him and sneezed.
He’s only just begun to unravel the hose when Castiel notices him. He stops with the rake in his hands and stares at Dean like he’s seeing a ghost. Which, to be fair, Dean has certainly made himself scarce over the past few days. He shoots Castiel a small smile and makes a show of peeling off his shirt. Castiel’s jaw drops and he starts to cross his lawn towards Dean. Dean smirks to himself, and prepares to strike.
Dean cleared his throat but was spared from having to say anything further by the arrival of Sam and Eileen.
Dean snorts. "That’s not exactly breaking news, Cas. God, you really need to leave that place. I hate what it’s doing to you."
Dean set the phone down, and picked up the needle to continue. Cas’s hands remained folded innocuously in his lap but his other wing—his good one—seemed to reach out of its own accord and curled around the back of his chair; Dean could feel the soft brush of feathers against his back. He suppressed the shiver that ran down his spine, and focused all his energy on keeping his hands from shaking. The absurdity of the situation rattled him. His hands—his dirty, human hands, stitching an angel’s wings back together.
This was new, this thing between them. The first time they kissed had been a few months back, and it had been entirely unexpected. Cas had been stupid and reckless—again—and Dean had surprised them both when he’d pinned Cas angrily to a wall when they’d finally made it back to the bunker. In his fury, he’d kissed him. It was harsh, and all teeth, and over before it had really begun, and they didn’t talk about it.
Maybe it’s the beer that’s loosened his tongue and made him bold, but Dean leans in then, and it feels right. This is what he’d imagined their reunion looking like.
Sam rolled his eyes. “But then there was the woman who dropped dead while eating an apple and the model who pricked her finger doing needlepoint and fell into a coma.”
Next to having her boys alive and well, it’s the best Christmas present Baby could have ever hoped to receive.
Castiel extricates himself from his trenchcoat as well, and moves to wrap it around Dean. One palm slides against Dean’s lower back, the other against his bare arm.
Cas surged in to kiss him again, more forcefully than before, and Dean’s lips parted eagerly. He let out a soft moan at the taste of himself on Cas’s lips.
A cute brunette waitress greeted them and showed them to a booth. Out of deference to whatever the hell it was he had with Cas at the moment, Dean did his best not to check her out.
The sun was in fact shining through a large window, glinting off a mirror. Dean blocked out the light with his hand and continued his survey of the room, which was large and swanky, but looked like it had been ransacked. There was a Renaissance style painting that appeared to have fallen off the wall and was resting crooked on the floor. There were clothes strewn everywhere. A tan coloured coat over a chair, black dress pants hanging on the edge of the mirror, a shoe halfway under the painting. Dean recognized his own jeans crumpled in a heap at the end of the bed and looked down startled to discover that he was entirely naked. He grabbed frantically for the sheets and pulled them down over himself, which only succeeded in pulling them off of his bedmate and further exposing the nakedness of the man peering down at him.
And Dean is definitely alive, that much Castiel knows. He can feel him. And yet, it's different. Never before has the thrumming feeling he gets from Dean been this strong, or this desperate. Something must be wrong, and he shifts uncomfortably with the knowledge. Normally the feeling he gets from Dean just simmers, low and quiet. But this is altogether different. There's no ebb, no flow. This is constant and unrelenting and—
He nodded without thinking, and then there was a hand rubbing soothing circles into his upper back. The other hand rested on his shoulder, a firm, warm weight that grounded him.
He doesn’t get long to dwell on any of it, though, because it’s over quickly. Dean is making frantic noises above him and before Castiel has a chance to do much of anything, Dean is shouting hoarsely and coming in hot spurts down his throat.
Pure, unadulterated terror coursed through Dean and he stood, stock still, in the middle of his ex-husband’s living room, hands full of his CDs. He might as well have been rifling through his underwear drawer. Dean considered hiding and looked around frantically.
Cas!” Dean spluttered. “Where did they even come from?! I thought they were just, you know, shadowy things.”
He had been royally pissed last night, he remembered. And who could blame him? What kind of overgrown, floppy haired moose of a brother drops that sort of bomb and expects you to just be okay with it?
After tidying the kitchen and prepping for dinner, Dean surveys the rest of their home. They haven’t got a tree yet, but Dean has the day off work and has been thinking about making Christmas cookies after he rips up the tile in the downstairs washroom. Maybe he’ll put up some decorations, too—he has a box of old stuff from his parents’ house that Sam dropped off the last time he was over: lights, tinsel, and strings of that tacky sparkly garland that was popular when they were kids. He’s certain Cas will really love it though, if his car is anything to go by. The Continental is the epitome of tacky.
Castiel snorted at that, because it was just ridiculous. But Dean smiled, and Castiel felt his heart pound faster as Dean reached toward him and brushed a thumb lightly over his stubble.
Hours later, Castiel finds himself relieved when people begin to disperse and find places in the bunker to get some sleep. Parties, as it turns out, are an exhausting affair.
“You okay?” Dean asks, his back turned as he peels off his flannel shirt. His t-shirt rides up, revealing the soft dimple of his lower back.
Ordinarily, Dean wouldn’t have cared and would have shown up in his jeans, just on principle alone. Cas, however, had convinced him that more formal attire was the better move. Dean was trying to make amends for his behaviour last night after all, and it was a sign of respect to the happy couple, and blah blah blah.
They debated at length about what to do with Cas during the night. Sam suggested they leave him on the table but Dean wasn’t so comfortable with that. What if he hopped off and got lost or crushed somewhere. Amidst their argument, Cas hopped into the glass bowl again, settling the decision for Dean. He scooped up the bowl and detoured through the kitchen first on his way to bed.
Cas grunts and squirms out of Dean’s hold, and Dean’s immediate relief is replaced with fury when the paramedic trying to give Cas oxygen announces with no small amount of irritation that Cas had been one of the last to evacuate, having stayed behind to help trapped animals out of the building.
“You can get a no-fault divorce if you’ve live separately for a year without co-habiting on the grounds of incompatibility.”
“No, no,” Dean insists, tugging at Cas with one arm and his cock with the other. “It’s fine, I just gotta focus.”
He handed over a stack of forms. “I’ve printed these off for you. You’ll need to fill them out, both of you sign, and then submit them to the courts here in Vegas. The courthouse probably won’t be open until Monday now,” Sam mused.
Dean lets out a slow breath. “Only if we can talk about the fact that there's a perfect job for you right under your nose and you're not going for it."
Dean rolls over and pulls the sheets up to his neck. He lets out another yawn, and Castiel can hear his breathing begin to even out. It isn’t until he can hear soft snores from the other side of the bed that Castiel dares to speak the words:
“I uh…” Castiel knew he stared too much. It was hard not to, what with those freckles and that smile. And those bright green eyes that Castiel just wanted to drown in. It would be bad enough if it was just that Dean was good looking. Cas felt certain he would have been able to handle that because he was so rarely affected by attractive people. He could appreciate when someone was aesthetically pleasing by conventional standards, but that was usually where it ended for him. But with Dean it had been different. Dean had gone and been a wonderful, kind, caring person to boot, and Cas was completely screwed. The more he got to know Dean, the more his hopeless little crush had festered.
“Morning, sunshine!” Dean smiles as Cas stumbles groggily into the kitchen and makes a beeline for the coffee pot. The machine splutters at him and Cas scowls before filling his travel mug and sagging against the counter to savour the first sip.
Castiel had watched Dean sleep many times in those early years. Despite Dean's protests that it was creepy, Castiel found it exceedingly difficult at times to stay away. He tried, he really did, but then Dean would call out to him in his dreams. The fear, the agony– it ripped at something inside of Castiel that he hadn't even known existed. And so he went to Dean when he could, and watched him sleep as he infused him with soft tendrils of his grace and soothed the nightmares as best he was able. It was the beginning of a long, complicated tangle in which Dean would say one thing, while his thoughts, his dreams, his soul would scream another.
“You know,” Dean said between mouthfuls of food, “even once you’re back to normal, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to watch over my shoulder while I’m cooking.
Castiel closes the door behind him, not sure what Dean’s saying or what his brother has to do with anything. Dean sounds far away, muffled by the ringing in Castiel’s ears.
Several options later and it had become apparent that Cas was reluctant to lose the trench coat. In a stroke of inspired brilliance, Dean replaced it with a long white lab coat instead and pronounced him Doctor Sexy.
“Night, Cas,” he said, and Cas nuzzled against his hand. He left the bowl on the bedside table, turned off the light, rolled over, and went to sleep.
Dean rolls his eyes and smiles to himself as makes his way up his own front walk. Not even the sagging porch and peeling paint can dampen his spirits. It turns out this is the perfect house after all.
He didn’t realize just how well Ishim had him figured out until later when he’s laying beaten and bleeding on the ground. True, a banishing spell may kill him now, but it will save Dean and that’s what matters. It’s the right thing to do and Cas is ready. He turns to look at Dean’s face one last time.
Cas’s voice was low and husky when he spoke next. “Perhaps we should get going if we don’t want to be late.”
A pained expression passes over Dean's face. His mouth twitches like he wants to say something else, but no words come. Castiel stands, suddenly weary. "Please excuse me."
He couldn’t seem to stop smiling when he returned to work. Bobby’s eyebrow arched so high it threatened to slide right off his forehead and he mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like “love-struck idjit.”
Suddenly desperate, Dean grappled clumsily with Cas’s belt, managed to get it only partway unhooked before Cas ripped it in two and tossed it to the floor like it had personally wronged him.
Dean shuddered at the thought. “What happened with your family?” he asked. “I can’t see how anyone could be disappointed in you.”
His bedroom door was closed, which wasn't in itself odd. Castiel often kept his door closed when he slept. But then, how had the cat got out?
“We haven’t yet determined the severity of his neck and back injuries,” she said. “Paralysis is entirely possible, but frankly, it’s a secondary concern at the moment. First, we need to get him stable and see if he wakes up. If he does…” she trailed off and her gaze narrowed on Dean, sizing him up. “You should prepare yourself for the possibility that he won’t be the same. He’s suffered a major head injury, and the effect that will have on his brain function remains to be seen.”
Castiel often brewed coffee for Dean at the bunker when they were between cases and mornings were a slow, lazy affair. Those were the nights when Dean slept soundest—when there were no cases to worry about, no apocalypse looming, no monster on the horizon. Over the years, Dean had begun to shed his layers when he went to bed, and since Castiel’s time as a human, he had come to understand that clothes were an odd sort of protection. When you went to sleep scared, not knowing when you’d need to wake quickly and defend yourself, it was safest not to get too comfortable.
“What? No!” Cas lurched forward, nearly tripping over the cord of the lamp. He set it down on the table.
Dean is definitely not better in the morning. He shuffles into the kitchen and stops in his tracks at the sight of Cas sipping coffee and reading the paper. It’s all just so goddamn domestic and the irritation from yesterday flickers back to life as he thinks about what sort of cosmic consequences might be in store for the angel in his kitchen who’s drained the coffee pot and not bothered to start another.
Cas passed a pepper grinder and Dean gave it a few twists. “Some other herbs would be good if you had them. Start out with just a little seasoning, and keep tasting. You can always add more.”
No, this time it was soft, slightly parched lips beneath his own. A timid, gentle, ghost of a kiss.  The warmth of Cas’s breath danced against his skin, and Dean melted into it, devouring the hesitation from Cas’s lips and replacing it with his own desperate need.
Castiel scrambled to regain his balance and made his way carefully back down the rungs. He had hired Sam on as an employee at the bookstore nearly six months ago. Sam had been eager about the job, desperate for another source of income to fund his schooling, and had a shared reverence for books that Castiel hadn’t been able to turn down. Over time, Sam had also come to be a cherished friend. Castiel’s once solitary existence was now peppered with weekly evenings spent with Sam and his friends.
No, Cas is too considerate and steadfast for an affair. Dean’s certain of it. He feels bad for even considering the possibility.
Dean turns the key over, but she stands her ground and refuses to start. “What the hell?” He mutters.
Sam tapped Eileen on the shoulder to get her attention and translated for her. She smiled and looked to Cas and Dean. “Let’s go. I’m ready for this.”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas murmured. He brushed his lips softly against Dean’s, then pulled back. Warm blue eyes studied Dean for a long moment, searching his face. Then he kissed him again, squarely on the nose. “Are you ready for this?”
Castiel considers the most terrifying possibility yet: What if he’s been reprogrammed again? What if he’s playing into exactly what they want him to do, drawing the Winchesters to him? What if it’s not safe for them? What if
He’s even begun talking to the ferret when Cas is at work, and that’s where he finds himself one fateful day, peering in the cage at soft brown eyes that gaze back up at him in earnest. She cocks her head to the side in an unmistakably Cas-like gesture that tugs at Dean’s heart.
Cas turned in his resignation to accept the job at the shelter, and Dean has never seen him happier. Their renovations are on hold, their Christmas “tree” is wobbling dangerously to one side, and they’ve agreed not to exchange gifts this year. But seeing Cas like this is the best gift Dean could have ever hoped to receive.
He confesses to the slime stain in his shower every morning. “I love him,” Dean whispers, the words drowned beneath the heavy sound of water.
Once safely inside the washroom, Dean fell to his knees at the toilet and began dry heaving, clinging to the toilet bowl with white knuckles. He stared at his hands and realized that his ring was missing.
Before Dean knew it, his brother and Cas were talking animatedly about the effects of global warming. He sighed, zoning out a little. His attention returned to the table when Cas excused himself to the washroom. Dean watched him walk away and was startled by Sam snapping his fingers in his face.
Cas concedes and walks him back until his knees hit the edge of his bed. He sinks down, and pulls Cas down to meet him. Bared to one another, Cas settles into the space between his legs and presses soft nips to the inside of his knees.
Dean remembered now. Sam had wanted to meet him in Vegas; this much he knew. Dean had driven all the way from Kansas, excited to see his little brother who has been studying pre-law at Stanford. But he had been surprised when he got there to see that Sam had not come alone.
And if he’s going to do this, if he’s going to break this last sacred oath, he’s going to go all in.
“Right. Yeah.” Dean straightened, blinked rapidly, and gave his head a shake. This was going to be a long night.
Castiel laughed, but let out a low whistle when Sam slid the book over to him. It was definitely old, that much was certain. He ran his fingers gingerly over the cover and opened it to reveal delicate, yellowing pages.
He grabs at Dean like he’s drowning, one hand tangling in his hair and the other running across his shoulder and down his back. He gets his hands under Dean’s t-shirt and lifts it up to reveal the warm expanse of skin beneath. He pulls gently and Dean lifts it off over his head.
Sam clears his throat, looks like he’s about to say something, then thinks better of it. The silence continues.
Dean was halfway through on his way to the living room when he stopped in his tracks. There was a new addition in the kitchen: a shiny new spice rack sat on the counter. Dean gave it a gentle spin and watched it whirl around. It was full of things like cumin, and thyme, and cloves. Curious now, Dean had a quick peek in the fridge. No takeout containers or pizza boxes. Dean straightened up and saw the neat stack of books on top of the fridge. He ran a finger over their spines, reading the titles of the various beginner cookbooks.
Backing hastily away from the bird, Dean surveyed the rest of the room. Cas’s apartment was huge; larger than Dean had first realized. It was more of a penthouse, really. One whole wall of the living area was lined with floor to ceiling windows that offered a stunning view of the Vegas skyline. A sliding door on one end led to what looked like a wraparound balcony. The rest of the living room was lined with floor to ceiling bookcases, housing a variety of thick books and expensive looking artifacts. A massive TV hung on one wall, facing a dark couch and matching chairs.
“Okay, okay,” Dean said, raising his hands in surrender. “I guess you didn’t have to eat as an angel. Maybe you don’t have to as a frog either.” Bolstered by this, Dean carried Cas down the hallway with him. He stopped outside the room he had come to think of as belonging to Cas, having intended to put the bowl in there for the night. But the thought of locking Cas in that empty room had him turning instead for the door to his own room.
There are surprisingly few things they can do without the use of their hands. Nearly every board game at the cabin requires the use of fine motor skills; Monopoly is out of the question entirely. Cas gets one of the little green houses wedged in his bandages and spends the rest of the afternoon trying to pull it out with his teeth.
“I wish I remembered,” Dean said. “I don’t… I’ve always… I’m not sure…” Dean cleared his throat, not really sure himself what he was trying to say. He pondered a moment, then tried again. “What’s it like?” he asked.
As he lay in bed staring up at the ceiling, Dean pressed his fingers to his lower lip, feeling the faintly lingering sensation of Cas’s lips on his. It was much later, just before he finally slipped into a fitful sleep, that he remembered they hadn’t finished with the annulment papers.
Dean wanted to say yes but he couldn’t get the word out. He just opened and closed his mouth helplessly, like an idiot. A beat passed and Cas started to withdraw his hands. Dean panicked, suddenly more scared of Cas not kissing him than he was of what would happen if he did. He grabbed Cas’s hands before he could pull them back all the way and held them in place.
Then it hits him. He flinches with the sudden intensity of it that feels like an actual blow to his chest— like there’s some invisible hand squeezing his heart and lungs, compressing his air. This
And it was nice knowing Cas wasn’t going anywhere. No flapping off to important angel business. Dean found he really enjoyed breakfast in the morning with Cas. He set him down on the table alongside his plate of breakfast.
Castiel sighs. “I'm sorry, Charlie, that you had to experience that. The full extent of heaven's torture is nothing any human should be subject to."
Dean fell asleep to the softness of wings all around him and the warmth of Cas's breath on the back of his neck.
“It just seems a shame, is all.” Cas said. “I married a… a Greek God.” He gestured haphazardly at Dean. “I had what was likely the best sex of my life with you, and I don’t even remember it.” He turned to face Dean fully, staring intensely. “I just wish I remembered being with you,” he said very softly, with another sad, slow smile. He dropped his head heavily, and stared at his lap.
Cas was staring at him with a stupidly soft expression on his face, the way Sam went all dewy eyed around small animals.
Castiel lifted her carefully to bring her inside, struggling for only a moment at the door as he tried to balance her weight in one hand while he fumbled with his keys with the other. She didn’t squirm, so that made it easier, but she was certainly not a light cat. He set her down with a thump once they got inside.
“Hello Dean.” The man smiled at him warmly and extended a hand down to him. For a bewildering moment, Dean thought he was offering to shake his hand, but then his hand was gripped tightly and he was pulled to his feet.
An hour later, Cas was loathe to move. The cat had drifted closer and closer to him, and was now sprawled across his lap with her belly in the air. Her head hung upside down off the other side of his lap, eyes half closed, tongue hanging out just a bit, and purring louder than Castiel had realized was possible for a creature of her size.
Cas stared at him, chuckling. His whole face lit up, nose scrunching, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “I guess this makes you the princess.”
That’s why Castiel smiles fondly at Dean as he shuffles into the kitchenette wearing only his t-shirt and boxers. He pours himself a cup of coffee and collapses onto the small sofa that squeaks under his weight. Dean looks rumpled and sleepy, but well. He’s relaxed and whole– he feels safe, Castiel realizes. Comfortable and happy. So happy. It warms Castiel’s heart, even as he feels a small, sharp sting somewhere at the realization that Dean has managed just fine without him in the time since Castiel has been in the Empty.
Balthazar was watching intently, head cocked to one side in such a way that he looked a lot like Cas. Dean wondered if the bird had picked that up from Cas or if it was the other way around.
Inside, their family was waiting. Sam, Eileen, Bobby, and John greeted them warmly. There were hugs and handshakes all around.
“I… uh… that would… yeah, okay. Yeah, that would be… uh… nice, yeah. Thanks.” Dean groans inwardly, but Castiel’s face lights up. The smile from the other day is back— the one that sets butterflies fluttering inside Dean.
Dean scrambled back a little too quickly and tumbled off the edge of the bed in shock. He landed hard on his ass and yelped at the sudden flash of pain that he tried very hard to ignore.
“If we can’t find your family, I might just have to keep you,” he whispered, as the purrs lulled him into a deep sleep.
“No,” Castiel admits. “I’m changed because of the time I’ve spent on earth in this universe. Because of the relationships I’ve formed. Because I had a cause and something to fight for.”
“I prefer CDs,” said Cas, pointing to the long shelf of them behind Dean. Dean took a quick survey and found it filled with an array of medieval music, loads of classical shit, and some of those relaxation CDs that mimicked nature sounds. Notably absent was anything from the 20th century.
They both groaned when Dean got his hand into Cas’s pants, managed to pull Cas’s dick free and stroke it steadily— the ends of his wings thumped rapidly against the floor again in a gesture that reminded Dean vaguely of a dog’s tail.
Castiel started towards his living room but paused when he realized that cat wasn’t budging from the foyer. It stayed sitting there, staring at him with wide eyes.
Cas said he struggled with depression. His family were a bunch of dicks. Hell, Dean was a dick. Maybe if he had been there, Cas wouldn’t have done this. Dean could have made it better, could have talked to Cas, could have made him smile. He could have found the goddamn balls to reciprocate Cas’s heartfelt affections.
“The cat,” Dean said, like this would explain everything. Castiel looked around for her, but Dean continued with a lopsided grin. “It was me!”
“I can’t believe I missed your bachelor party,” Dean groaned. “Please tell me there were strippers.”
Cas’s continues to squint at him in confusion and cocks his head to one side. “Well, yes. I’ve been trying to cover up the smells of the shelter so it didn’t affect you, but I didn’t want to take any chances.”
When he landed in Vegas, Dean hailed a taxi and went straight to the hospital. He made his way through endless off-white walls that smelled of disinfectant and death. A volunteer directed him to central reception, who directed him back to the emergency room. The calm, unhurried demeanor of everyone he talked to made him want to scream.
Dean found himself shivering in the sudden cold, away from the warmth of Cas’s body and his wings. Cas pulled at the leg of Dean's jeans which had pooled around his waist, tugging them the rest of the way off. He placed quick kisses down the length of Dean's legs as he did so The kisses lacked the heated intensity of a few moments earlier, but there was something altogether more intimate about Cas nosing at the inside of his knees.
Dean let out a breathy laugh. “Yeah, well, I meant it when I said I sucked at relationships. I’m a colossal fuckup, Cas. I don’t know how to do this. Any of this.” He shrugged helplessly. “But I know that my life got a little brighter that weekend in Vegas when I woke up next to you. And when I left, it got… darker again. I thought I was doing the right thing, but now I’m not so sure.”
“God, yes,” Dean groaned. He scanned the menu, did a double take of the prices, and resolved to stick with just coffee. His wallet had been empty of any cash when he found it that morning, and he was certain there wasn’t much more than a few dollars in his account at the moment. He would just drink his coffee, sort this marriage shit out, and be on his way.
“Hmmph,” John muttered. But then he met Dean’s eye and straightened up a bit, clearing his throat. “Congratulations, son.”
Dean laughed bitterly, and let out a long sigh. Cas was now stroking his hair, and holding a hand against his forehead to feel his temperature. Dean swatted him aside, grunted, and made to stand up.
“We’ll figure out the furnace,” he says as he turns off the bedside light and nestles himself next to Dean. “Don’t let it worry you like this.”
Dean had a peek in the kitchen before heading upstairs. There was a mountain of dirty bowls in the sink, but not a lot else. Evidently his dad had been subsisting on cereal for the past few days. The homemade frozen meals Dean had prepared for him ahead of time were still in the freezer.
who you are. And it has nothing to do with your lockpicking skills. Or your performance in bed, or the way lube magically appears in your bedside table, or how your ass always tastes like caramel.”
“Wow,” Cas said, and his voice sounded a whole octave lower and more gravelly than normal. “That was…”
Dean’s mouth opens with a quick retort but he swallows it down and licks his lips. His mouth fumbles uselessly for a moment, trying to find the right words. “Well, it wasn’t my
Dean panicked. He had just resolved to check the bedroom and washroom for signs of a second party, when he heard a key turning in the front door.
Everything was achingly familiar. Dean had only spent a weekend here, but it felt an awful lot like coming home to a place he’d known all his life. He wandered in through the kitchen. It was gleaming and spotless as always. Dean’s eyes travelled up to the ceiling where there was still a small greasy spot they hadn’t been able to get clean from the pancake batter.
He stands up and turns to face Castiel, flashing the flirtiest smile he can muster as he saunters over. “Bit forward, don’t you think?” Dean calls back. “Buy a guy a drink first, why don’t you?”
“We gotta get you a hat, Cas,” Dean says to the opposite wall as he returns his mug to the coffee maker.
“I went back for him after the—well, uh. After the Michael thing. I remembered that we’d locked him in the trunk and I let him out once I was sure he’d shifted back to himself. He was so grateful he swore he was naming his next child after me. I assumed it was just a figure of speech.”
Dean woke up the next morning with a jolt and it took him a moment to remember where he was. When it came flooding back, he lay staring at the ceiling for a long time, relaxing into the lusciously soft sheets, more pillows than Dean thought was strictly necessary, and a duvet so big and fluffy it nearly swallowed him up. The room Dean found himself in was dusty in places, like it hadn’t been used in a long time. He snooped around, hoping to learn more about Cas, but all of the drawers were empty and the closet bare.
“I didn’t do anything, she just stopped!” He shoots Castiel an angry look and runs a soothing hand over her dash. “What’s wrong Baby, hmm?”
Castiel sighed. “I’m not interested, Gabriel. Please stop trying to set me up with every single man you find.”
He was saved by an incoming call from the garage where his car was being kept, and Dean excused himself, hoping to hear that his baby was nearly ready to go. It was a quick job, and Dean wanted to do the work himself; the garage was just going to get him the part he needed. Or at least, he thought they were going to.
He smiled when realized that the black markings on Cas looked sort of like wings. He patted Cas awkwardly on the head, and he wasn’t
“I’m telling you, Sam, that’s all I know,” Dean sighed an hour later as they pored over still more books.
"Hello, Dean. Saturday morning cartoons!" Cas motions to the TV with his bowl. "Just like sleepovers when we were kids. I ate the honey nut cheerios, but saved you the rest of the fruit loops. There are rice krispies too."
Dean frowns and shimmies to prop himself up on his elbows. “That can’t be possible. You’re good, Cas, right down to your core no matter what the circumstances.”
Dean couldn’t argue that. The bird ruffled his feathers and gave him an indignant look. Dean frowned. He made a face and stuck his tongue out at the bird when Cas’s back was turned, and was startled when the bird snapped its beak at him and hissed in response.
He felt Cas smile against the back of his shoulder. "Not much, no. Safe to say I've been sufficiently distracted from any pain."
Dean stared incredulous at the crowd of college kids that had gathered to gawk at the bloody smear on the floor. All of them so very young that he was suddenly weary.
Dean worries all the way home, and jumps when Cas puts a tentative hand on his knee. He should really stop worrying, because the evening ends up unfolding like most other evenings with Cas. They find themselves on Dean’s couch watching Doctor Sexy reruns. This time though, when Dean stares at Cas’s hand in the space between them, Cas smiles and turns it palm up to him in invitation. Dean takes it, squeezes, and can’t for the life of him stop smiling.
“Cas.. please. Please, I need… fuck.. Cas… please, please, please.” His vision blurred, and Dean was stunned to realize that he was crying it was so fucking good.
There’s a muttered curse, and Castiel looks up to see Dean struggling to remove his socks, He wobbles on one foot before collapsing onto his bed in a fresh t-shirt and sweatpants. Finally rid of his socks, Dean lets out a loud groan and falls back onto his pillow, stretching his arms above his head and yawning.
Dean frowned. There was no way in hell he was sleeping tonight. But he really should go feed the damn bird. Cas’s apartment wasn’t far. He could get there, feed Balthazar, and be back in under an hour. Then he could stay, and he wouldn’t leave until he got to see Cas, and probably not then either.
If there was one thing Dean was good at, it was sex. He might even be able to show Cas a few things.
They had moved to sit on the couch, albeit rather stiffly, each occupying opposite ends with a long expanse between them. Dean itched to move closer and narrow the gap, but Cas was sitting as far away from him as it was possible to get without sitting on the armrest, so he stayed put.
“Hey! Cas!” Dean let out a nervous laugh and blushed. Beautiful, confident, larger-than-life Dean Winchester was standing naked in his kitchen and
He’s about to hit send on his latest application when there’s a knock at his door. Castiel is surprised to find Dean.
Despite his slight annoyance, Dean can’t help but smile at Cas’s glee as he discovers the garland wrapped around their staircase.
And so, Dean sat. And fidgeted. And got up and paced. And then sat down again and sat there for over half an hour. He wanted to kick and scream and punch something and would have done anything to see the doctor right fucking now, goddamnit.
Cas’s eyes snapped open and locked on him. “Thank you, Dean.” Cas leaned closer, his breath falling ragged between them. Dean’s own breath caught in his throat. “You can keep touching them if you want. I… don’t mind.”
Ignoring the reproachful glare from Cas, Dean made a clean sweep of the spider web and deposited both it and the spider into the bowl.
“Nothing.” Dean clears his throat, stands, and stretches. His t-shirt lifts to show a sliver of his belly. It’s trimmer than Castiel remembers, and he misses the softness of before. He’ll suggest they stop for a proper lunch today and find a burger joint somewhere.
Dean feels reasonably good about the way they left things but then, as he’s climbing into bed, there’s a knock at his door.
Dean groaned. There was no way he had enough cash to stay in even a crappy little motel for much longer. “Maybe the garage will let me stay overnight and I can sleep in the backseat of the car.”
“I really would like to buy you that drink if you’d like. Or you could come over for one at my place?”
It was filled with soft hand-drawn pencil sketches— the level of care and detail in each one breathtakingly beautiful. The first few pages were filled with still life. Flowers, trees, a road that Dean recognized as the one leading to the bunker. In fact, as Dean thumbed through, the scenes became increasingly familiar. There was the bowl of fruit Sam kept in the kitchen, the lamp in the library, the impala, and the parking lot from the motel they stayed at just outside of Portland. Dean swallowed a lump in his throat as he flipped through the last half of the book where Cas had progressed to portraiture. There was Sam, hunched over his laptop, telltale slump to his shoulders. And there was Dean himself, grinning. And Dean driving. And Dean with his feet up on the table, one resting on top of the other. And a whole series of disconnected anatomy— hands wrapped around beer bottles and a long series of eyes that looked suspiciously like his own.
He placed the opened can on the floor in front of her and set about tidying his bookshelves. When all his books were returned to their place he turned back to the cat and frowned.
UPDATE: Please note that this chapter may contain some slightly troubling scenes for anyone who may have recently (or not so recently) gone through what Dean is experiencing with a loved one. I've struggled with finding a way to balance avoiding spoilers with a desire to keep people safe. To that end, I've decided to remove some stuff from the main tags and put it in the chapter notes here instead.
The call is brief. Dean's voice is cracked and broken sounding, and when Castiel speaks, the swirling, longing
Dean returned to work at Bobby’s garage the following morning. Bobby quizzed him about the weekend and Dean told him about Sam and Eileen, and how happy they seemed. And Bobby seemed happy for them. Pissed, of course, that he missed out on the wedding. But he’d never admit to that. Dean even told him briefly about Cas, in a carefully sanitized version of events. In this version of the weekend, Cas was a friend Dean met who let him crash at his place while Dean’s car was being fixed.
He finds Dean blinking up at him in surprise, come splattered across his bewildered face. Castiel would apologize but words — and really all higher brain function — have abandoned him entirely. Dean’s blushing furiously, freckles dancing across his nose, his eyes wide and shining. There’s a streak of white across his cheek, and another clinging to his hairline.
Dean recited it to him. As Cas entered the numbers, he chuckled to himself. “Dean Winchester,” he said slowly, typing the name. “Relationship: Husband. I’m totally putting you down as my emergency contact, hubby.” He winked at Dean who rolled his eyes.
He sighed, and made his way up to bed. After spending the weekend in Cas’s bright, shiny penthouse, everything Dean looked at now seemed like shit in comparison. Their home was small and dirty and dark and dank. But, it was home, Dean thought. This is where he was meant to be.
Dean practically skipped back across the street to work, he was so thrilled that Cas was willing to talk to him. He’d fucked up whatever hope they’d ever had of a relationship-- not that Dean wanted one anyway, he kept reminding himself—but maybe they could remain friends through all this.
The doctor gave him a small nod. “I need to get back to surgery,” she said. “Talk to the nurse. I believe he had some personal effects with him.”
As they eat, Cas tells him about his day. Normal. Boring. Soul-sucking as always, but he’s less disgruntled tonight than usual. Dean nods along and tries to tamp down a gnawing feeling of unease. It’s not like Cas to be this happy and relaxed after such a long day at work.
Cas chuckled, and looked up at Dean. “Relax,” he said, then peppered soft little kisses all along the inside of his thighs. The hand on his dick began to move faster, up and down, the thumb occasionally sliding across the slit and smearing through pre-come.
Dean ground his hips again, and gasped at the feel of Cas growing hard beneath him. Cas let out a low, unrestrained growl, his hands tightening on Dean’s hips.
This was bad. Castiel sighed and slumped into the kitchen chair nearest to him, letting his head fall into his hands. “Of course, Dean. Always. But if you heard me last night, then you already know that.” He rubbed wearily at his temples.
Dean brings the beer in for Cas and pats him on the shoulder as he passes. He sinks into a chair, bracing himself mentally for words and talking and all of this feelings crap that puts his stomach in knots. It’s Cas though, and he can tell he’s hurting not just by the cut on his face that hasn’t fully healed yet, but by the way his shoulders droop and the way the dark circles under his eyes are more pronounced. Dean really is an ass.
There was a pause at the door, as the person realized the door wasn’t locked. Silence. And then the door squeaked slowly open. Slow, soft footsteps made their way carefully down the hall.
“He suffered a head injury, blunt force trauma, massive internal bleeding, severe lacerations, and several compound fractures. We performed surgery this afternoon and thought the worst was behind us. He was stable for a short time, and then his lung collapsed, so now he’s back in the OR.”
“I was just going through my phone trying to figure out what happened last night and there are, um, photos. And videos.” He held his phone up for Dean and hit play. Dean heard the sound of his own low moans coming through the speakers and he froze. Peering closer at the video, he saw himself on his knees. The video was shot from above, looking down on him. The Dean in the video had his mouth firmly wrapped around a sizable cock, head bobbing slowly up and down, eyelids fluttering. He pulled off with a soft pop, a low moan, and started licking around the head.
On the fourth day, as Dean peers out his window to check for the all-clear, he realizes with sudden horror that he has become the the old lady next door: scowling at his neighbour and peeking out at him through his curtains. If Dean is going to spend the next few years here — and he certainly plans to — he needs to make nice with the neighbour. If he could only level the playing field somehow…
That seems to do the trick. Dean sinks onto the couch and Cas drops to his knees on the floor. Part of him expects Dean to burst out laughing and call the whole thing off. But instead, Dean spreads his legs slowly. It’s almost shy, and when Castiel looks up, he’s surprised to see that Dean is blushing.
Dean's fairly certain he's never seen anything so ugly in all his life, but he doesn't tell Cas as much.
“Nah, it’s fine,” Dean says, and slides to the floor. He nudges at Castiel to take his place on the sofa. “Really, man. It’s weird if I don’t. We’re supposed to be helping each other out, right?”
Dean poked Cas in the ribs. He turned from his conversation with Bobby and leaned in close to wrap an arm around Dean’s waist. “Wedding present,” Dean muttered.
“It’s one of the strongest muscles in the human body,” he explains to Dean who stares at him with a strange expression as Cas stretches his tongue out and uses the tip to press down on the buttons.
They makes plans for drinks at Castiel’s house that evening. As Dean walks back to his own place, willing himself not to skip with glee, Castiel calls after him.
Breakfast was a resounding success. Omelettes and toast and hashbrowns, and Dean dutifully tried the pancakes that Cas had come within seconds of burning. They were lumpy in places and a little raw in others, but Dean covered them in syrup and declared them delicious. Cas narrowed his eyes suspiciously, but smiled all the same.
Dean smiled back, but for whatever reason, he hadn’t sat down yet. He just stood there, with a soft look on his face. Then his gaze dropped to the floor and he shuffled a bit on the spot, scuffing his bare foot on the floor.
Dean opened his eyes. The dazed expression on Cas’s face had been replaced with a look of pure affection and fondness, and Dean wilted under the intensity of it.
“It was there, I swear,” Dean says. Had he taken it out? He’d packed some in his bag on the last hunt they were gone for and—“oh shit, I left my bag in the trunk.”
Castiel makes up his mind the following day when their nurse brings a pie for dessert. Half of it remains uneaten after she’s left, and Castiel finds Dean staring longingly at it. Dean always stares longingly at pies, but something in his expression today is different, more lecherous. Castiel can practically see the gears working in his head.
“That’s what I thought. And assuming we can even find one, who’s going to want to kiss a frog? I mean, look at him.” He gestured at Cas and wrinkled his nose in disgust.
“Gosh, you’re cute,” Cas muttered. “Fine, here. You can try some.” He offered the cat a noodle and she sniffed at it. She took a tentative lick, and then wrinkled her nose. But she watched Cas carefully as he ate his dinner, and when he was done, he offered her the bottom of the bowl where a few bits of macaroni remained. She sniffed at it delicately, then with no grace whatsoever, shoved her head completely into the bowl and licked at the sides. She cleaned most of it up, and when she pulled back, her face and whiskers were covered in cheese. She sneezed again, and it flew everywhere.
Cas clams up, muttering under his breath that he’ll consider it, but Dean can tell he’s being evasive. He tries to push for more details, but dissolves into a fit of sneezes and Cas insists it’s time to go.
“I've done this with Sam before for fourth of July,” he says. “I figure we've got about thirty seconds before—”
Dean is babbling and incoherent, his face buried in the crook of Cas's neck. “Fuck.. Cas.. fuck.. oh god fuck.. I missed you… I’m sorry… I… fuck.. fuck.. Cas!”
Cas is sitting cross-legged on the old couch in the AC/DC shirt Dean lent him to sleep in, his hair wildly askew on one side, and munching steadily on a large bowl of cereal. His eyes are glued to the TV. The volume is turned down, but light flickers across Cas’s features, casting his profile into sharp relief. A mug of coffee sits on the table next to him proclaiming,
Another loud slurp pulls his attention back to Dean. He’s staring at him over the rim of his mug with a calculating look.
"Cas, what the hell." He grappled with the lapels of the lab coat, helping Cas to sit upright. Cas grimaced in pain, and it was only then that Dean saw the glint of the knife's hilt buried deep in the sinews of Cas's wing. "Oh god, Cas. Shit, shit…"
“Dean, I’m sorry. I know it didn’t mean anything, what we did at the cabin. We were just making the best of a bad situation. I know you were thinking of the porn star the whole time, I get it, and I swear, I tried to pretend. I really did. I’m sorry if I made things awkward, if I pushed you too far, or made it weird, or crossed a line.”
Sam snorted and Eileen choked a little on her drink. Sam quickly patted her on the back, and then rubbed circles into it once she had cleared her throat. Dean tracked the movement and saw that his hand never moved, sliding down to rest comfortably on the small of her back. She leaned over just slightly into his space so they were closer.
He waits until Castiel is close enough, until he’s within hearing range, before he looks him square in the eye, and smiles wider. He runs his hand over Baby’s hood, and as seductively as he can manage, he purrs, “Hey there, sweetheart.”
Sam cleared his throat and Dean scrambled to lean back, toppling his chair in the process and falling to the ground. Cas peered over the edge of the table and squinted down at him.
Eileen rejoined the table, sidling up to Sam who wrapped an arm around her, pulled her close, and pressed a kiss to the top of her head.
“Well she can’t stay here,” Sam said. “She’ll murder me in my sleep, I’m sure of it. Besides, Dean’s allergic.”
Cas hummed, and kissed the tip of Dean’s cock, which was painfully hard now and leaking. Without warning, Dean felt a finger move low and circle his rim. It was a soft touch, just a gentle brush against his skin, but Dean’s whole body convulsed and before he knew what was happening, he was coming all over his stomach in hot, thick streaks.
Dean turns on his heel then and disappears inside as Cas bristles at the reminder of his broken wings. He won’t be flapping anywhere tonight.
One: more than anything in the world, Dean wants to wake up every morning for the rest of his life and eat cereal on the couch with Cas. This is followed closely by realization number two: Dean is completely, irrevocably, and hopelessly in love with his best friend. And three: he’s utterly fucked beyond belief, because there’s no way in hell he could ever tell Cas any of this.
He knelt next to Dean. “Please, let me,” he mumbled. He scooped as much of the egg goop into his hands as he could manage and stood up. “I’m sorry if the alarm woke you. I… I wanted you to sleep in… I wanted to surprise you…”
Dean stared incredulously and Cas took this as an invitation to explain further. Dean cut him off with a loud snort around the time he started talking about monophonic liturgies and diatonic scales.
“Hurry up and fuck me already, would you?” Dean was immensely grateful for the position he had settled on so he could hide his face in the pillow and Cas wouldn’t see how red he was getting.
“Cas!” With a wince, Castiel turns to see Dean in the bed next to him sporting identical bandages on his hands. Dean’s face is pale and contorted with worry.
“Dean,” Cas whispered, pulling back to look at him solemnly. He brought both hands up to frame Dean’s face, his thumb stroking gently against his jaw. “May I?”
Eileen reached over to give his hand a squeeze. “I know it was a bit of a shock for you,” she said. Her tone was gentle, but her eyes were twinkling and she looked like she was trying to hold in laughter.
They only just bought the house a few months ago, so it will be their first Christmas here. The sellers were leaving in a hurry so they got a great, albeit unexpected deal considering they hadn’t even been looking seriously at the time. It happened so fast that most days, Dean looks around and can’t quite believe that his life is real.
He gets there, briefly. But loses it again before Cas can fully settle in his lap, nowhere near as hard as he needs to be. As he should be. Arousal thrums in him, but abstractly, a dull ache, ghosting around the edges and out of reach.
“Ouch! Alright, alright.” Cas stood back up with a sigh and deposited the cat onto the end of his bed. “I guess you can sleep with me tonight if you want.” The cat sneezed, but looked up at him with a pleased expression, her tail quivering at him. Castiel gave her a gentle pat on the head.
Cas flexed his damaged wing gently towards Dean and gave a small grimace. “Just like any other wound.”
“Stop it, you did nothing wrong. Please don’t ever change.” Dean said firmly. “I’m clearly the idiot here, not you.”
“Well alright then,” Dean said. “I guess Kermit’s coming with me.” He grinned and picked up the bowl. “Let’s hop to it, Cas.”
“It’s Sam!” Dean jolted in surprise and his knee hit the underside of the table, jostling their plates. He looked up at Cas apologetically.
“That was you.” Castiel repeated, and squinted at Dean in disbelief. He tilted his head to one side, considering. The eyes were certainly the same shade of green. He frowned, then gasped as the previous night started coming back to him. “You slept in my bed!”
Dean can’t even find it in himself to smile at the air quotes. He downs the last dregs of his drink.
Dean snorts derisively, but the effect is ruined somewhat by his teeth, which have begun to chatter.
Dean stopped short one day when the coffee shop across the street from the garage had a new item on the menu: honey lattes. Something terrible ached in Dean, and he caved. He ordered one, snapped a picture, and sent it to Cas.
As the fog from his mind began to clear, Dean took stock of his current predicament. First, his impala had broken down just outside of Vegas when he’d hit a pothole and he’d had to take her straight to a garage for a replacement part. Looking back, he probably should have seen it for the bad omen it was. He had come to Vegas to meet his younger brother Sam, who was on break from Stanford. He vaguely remembered a fight of some sort, though he couldn’t recall why he had been angry. And now he’d lost his mother’s ring, one of the few things Dean truly treasured, and had woken up next to a complete stranger.
There was another bang, a flash of lightning, and the outline of something pressed against the door. Sam lurched back, and Cas topped off the edge of his seat with a squeal. He felt somewhat vindicated by the fact that even Meg and Kevin had jumped a little this time. Kevin hit pause on the video as they all turned their attention to the backyard.
Mary seems genuinely thankful and Cas warms a little at her words. But it’s not Mary’s opinion that matters to him just now.
At work the next day, Dean buries himself under the hood of an old Toyota for most of the afternoon. He tries to keep distracted, but his thoughts inevitably stray back to Cas. He doesn’t want to think about it—tries really hard not to—but a niggling feeling in the back of his brain and a sinking feeling in his gut have him examining the the past week in detail.
He keeps his head tucked against Dean’s shoulder and Dean’s grateful for the lack of eye contact, fairly certain Cas has done so deliberately. This is a thing they do now. After years and years of so many things unsaid, they talk to each other now—
They’ve exchanged polite nods in passing each morning, but very few actual words. Hoping to change that, Dean is spending his Sunday afternoon in the front yard, attempting to garden. He’s pulling what looks like weeds and trying his valiant best to encourage the few remaining flowers. And hey, maybe catch another glimpse of his new neighbour.
Somehow the mug had remained in Dean's kitchen cupboards, in its own spot, only used whenever Cas was over.
“So uh..” Dean started, unsure of how exactly how to proceed with this. He decided that quick and direct was the best approach.  “Are you gay?” he whispered.
Dean’s heart skipped a beat. He recognized that voice. Before he could say anything else, Cas stepped into the light, wide eyed, hair askew, and clutching tightly to a frying pan that he held above his head.
Hysterical laughter threatened to bubble up in Dean. “You uh.. you’re not gonna hit me with that, are you?” he asked, hoping to lighten the mood. It failed miserably.
Dean had months to think of all the things he wanted say to Cas when he got out. Now he says nothing either.
The table had been elaborately set for two, with a crisp white tablecloth and fancy napkins. Two full glasses of wine had been poured, and the rest of the bottle was nestled in a wine chiller. A candle flickered in the middle of the table, burned down almost to it’s wick. Both plates were covered with a silver dome and Dean realized with a pang that Cas must have ordered in. Dean lifted one dome carefully to peer underneath, and found a gourmet steak dinner.
“Sam called me a coward,” Dean says, as he steps over the threshold. “Dared me to man up and do something, and honestly Cas, he was right. I’m a goddamn coward.”
Sam wrinkled his nose. "That's disgusting. I—hey there, girl!" A dog had bounded over to Sam's feet and was now staring up at him expectantly, tail wagging. He knelt down to pet her.
Eileen left the table to answer a facetime call from a friend back home. While she was gone, Sam outlined the differences between a divorce and an annulment for them.
The next day at the garage Dean’s despair was apparently evident to everyone around him. Bobby frowned at him and looked like he wanted to say something, but then thought better of it.
Cas had stared at him in rapt attention the entire time as Dean had become increasingly agitated. He continued staring now, blue eyes boring into Dean’s. Dean had to look away.
However, please keep in mind that there is NO major character death, and there is a happy ending on the horizon. After this chapter it's mostly smooth sailing :)
"Sure. Totally fine," Dean grunted as he helped him up to standing and held on tight, not trusting himself to let go. "Just sprouted wings and got stabbed, no big deal." Cas leaned heavily on him and Dean braced against the added weight. "Come on, let's get you out of here and patched up."
Dean was halfway into the living room when he was startled by a loud squawking noise that rose above the sound of his ringtone. He whirled around to see a large, elegant birdcage in one corner of the room and in it, a very proud looking bird that was ruffling its wings ostentatiously, making a sort of clicking noise. It was mostly grey with a tuft of red in it’s tail feathers.
“Well, alright then. I guess you really are coming home with me.” Cas closed the door and walked around to the driver’s side.
“You okay?” Dean had squatted next to him and helped retrieve some of the scattered books. He handed them over with a gentle smile that made Castiel’s insides melt.
“I know, I don’t cook much for myself. I’ve never been very good at it.” He perked up. “Perhaps you could teach me!”
It all came crashing to a halt three days later when his phone rang at work, late one afternoon. The screen lit up with Cas’s name.
Dean sighed, fingering the ring in his pocket. He hated telling this story. Truth be told, he didn’t tell it to many people. But something about the earnest look in Cas’s eyes made Dean relax; and besides, it wasn’t like he was ever going to see Cas again after today. Still, it wasn’t a conversation he was particularly keen to prolong.
Castiel winced and moved the phone back from his ear. His brother Gabriel continued to shout in his ear over loud background music that Castiel could hear thumping.
Cas is the guy who was once so guilt-ridden that he sent his old insurance company an apology gift basket after Dean made him switch to one with cheaper premiums. He’s the guy who keeps tuna cans in his car for stray cats, and is so averse to conflict that he drives three towns over to see the same dentist he’s seen for years because he doesn’t want to switch to one closer. He’s the guy who won’t ever let Dean kill a spider and insists instead on scooping them up, talking softly to them, and setting them carefully outside. There’s a goddamn centipede living in a jar in their kitchen window right now, because Cas said it was too cold to put it outside in the December snowstorm. Dean was ready to stomp on it, but Cas— well, Cas felt
Dean has a soft spattering of freckles all along his inner thighs and Castiel follows their trail to where they converge at Dean’s dick. It’s half-hard against his thigh, and beautiful, and Castiel can’t tear his eyes away. He stares, enraptured, as Dean’s dick swells visibly and twitches under his gaze.
Dean nods to himself and they descend into silence again. It's a softer sort of silence than before though. It's no longer anger that's trying to make itself heard over the stillness between them.
Dean’s first conscious thought was that everything was too bright. He squeezed his eyes shut tight, but a white light persisted on the inside of his eyelids. Although he wasn’t about to open his eyes to confirm, he was certain there was sunlight pouring in from a window somewhere. It was too bright, his head was throbbing, and every muscle in his body ached.
And then the pieces started to fall into place in his head. Cas was mugged, and his phone was stolen. Then the man in the hospital must be…
The bird squawked suddenly, breaking the silence, and Dean started. He made his way hurriedly to the living room where Balthazar was waiting impatiently. His dish was empty, and Dean dug around in the closet for the bag of food pellets he’d seen Cas give him. He opened the cage door just a crack and carefully snaked his hand inside to fill the dish. The bird snapped at him and Dean cursed, dropping pellets all over the bottom of the cage.
“You mean—” Sam peered into the cooler at the frog that stared rather grumpily back up at him. “Shit,
“I love you, Dean. I’ve loved you for a long time. I’m going to continue loving you in whatever way you’ll have me, for as long as you’ll let me. I would be both humbled and honored if you choose to give this thing between us a try. But if you don’t— if you truly want to remain as ‘just friends,’ then that’s fine too. Honestly.”
“He was their torturer, did you know? Their expert, brought in to pull information forcefully from human minds.”
Dean took a deep breath, bracing for what he was about to do next. He had thought about it the whole way here on the plane, the only thing keeping him from losing his mind entirely. It was a little crazy, but everything about his time with Cas had been crazy, he reasoned, and he felt deep in his gut like this was the right thing to do. The only thing to do.
“He’s too kind and soft-hearted for his own good, you know?” The ferret doesn’t answer him, of course, but Dean continues, feeling somewhat ridiculous but also relieved to spill his secrets to another sentient creature. “I can’t stop thinking about him. His stupid messy hair, and his blue eyes that make you just want to drown in them. And his stupid, perfect, kissable lips. God, Pimmy, I love him so much.” He lets out bitter, humorless laugh. “I’m going insane here. It’s unbearable, it’s—”
He thinks of Purgatory and the crypt and all the other times he’s put himself out there and Cas has walked away.
At least he hadn’t missed the wedding. He could still make it tonight. That is, if Sam still wanted him there. Chances were good that Sam wanted nothing to do with him right now. He debated calling Sam right then and there, but decided against it. If Sam really was mad, it was historically better to give Sam some space. In the meantime, Dean would try to figure out what had happened the night before, so he knew exactly what he needed to apologize for.
“Well, I may have fought back a bit. Once he took my things and he was just standing there riffling through my wallet, I… I just lost control and something in me snapped. He managed to run away with my things, but there was… there was a lot of blood.” He looked down at his hands and Dean saw that they too were bruised and bloody.
Castiel flinches as Jack bursts into the bedroom. As expected, Dean does not respond well to being jolted awake. Although he knows Jack can't be hurt by bullets, Castiel still scowls when Dean pulls the gun from under his pillow and aims it at Jack.
Castiel gets home to the bunker late, but Dean’s still up, nursing two fingers of whiskey. Turns out his
“It really is good to have you back, Cas,” he admitted. Then he schooled his features into something more resembling indignation and smacked him—hard—square in the chest. “But don’t
He tries to take matters into his own hands at night. Figuratively speaking of course, since he can’t actually use his hands as nature intended. Instead, he tries balling up his blanket and thrusting into it. But it’s old — probably older than Castiel himself — and painfully scratchy. Castiel flops over onto his back and lets out an exasperated sigh.
Sam and Eileen exchanged rings, a minister said some brief words, and they kissed as husband and wife. Then they all congregated back in the bar for celebratory drinks. Cas eyed his warily and asked the waitress for a glass of water.
“He might’ve if you’d bothered to tell him you were getting married,” Dean pointed out huffily, and Cas jabbed him in the ribs before he could go much further with that thought.
Their bandages come off the next morning and Castiel can’t stop touching things. He scratches the itch on his nose, runs his hands through his hair. Unsure what to do with himself, he sinks heavily to the arm of the couch, and smooths his hands over the coarse fabric. Finally, he can use his hands. Finally, he can feel.
Cas’s hands slid up from Dean’s face to tangle in his hair, and his wings came to circle around him, pulling him closer with surprising strength. Dean tumbled easily the rest of the way into Cas’s lap and straddled his waist, kissing him deeply.
“We’ll talk about it later,” Sam said. “Right now, we want to get married!” He looked over at Eileen and put his arm around her. She was dressed in a white sundress with a teal belt that matched the handkerchief in Sam’s breast pocket. It was a simple dress, but the effect was stunning.
He wonders if he should do something. Set out bowls of chips? Isn't that what you do at parties? He doesn't even know if they have chips in the bunker kitchen though. They did last week, but Dean is likely to have eaten those by now.
“Some,” Cas said a little absently, rummaging through the closet in the hall for a pair of shoes. “Most are inappropriate; I’ve no idea where he gets them from.” He straightened up, passed a pair of dress shoes over to Dean, then walked back down the hall in the direction of his bedroom.
He paused, but neither of them said anything. And so, with every ounce of strength he had, Dean turned and walked out the door.
Dean’s pulling in and parking next to it before he can really register what’s happened. He turns the Impala off, and sits with his hands shaking on the wheel for several minutes, taking stock of the situation. He looks down at his phone and the last message from Cas.
“Fuck off. You need to recharge before you go using your mojo again.” Dean gestures angrily to a bandaged wound on Castiel’s shoulder.
“I don’t know,” Cas scowled. “I can’t say I’ve ever been in the position of having to annul a drunken marriage before.” His tone wasn’t overly harsh, but Dean flinched all the same. Cas took a deep breath and his face relaxed. He gave Dean an apologetic sort of smile that Dean found a bit bewildering. “Your brother. You said he can help us?”
Dean picked up the phone, eyeing it like it was about to explode. He answered, bracing for the worst. “Sam?”
Over the next few weeks, Dean and Cas continued to text back and forth. Dean hadn’t quite worked up the courage to call him yet, but he was working on it.
“But thanks for letting me crash here as long as you did,” he said gruffly. “It was a helluva weekend, man.” He gave a half-hearted wink, hoping to lighten the mood, and turned to leave before he made anything worse.
Cas grappled with the front of Dean’s pants, and Dean let out a hiss when Cas’s long fingers finally wrapped around his length, pulling him free. He rolled his hips, bit his lip at the feel of himself alongside Cas.
His fears are unfounded though, because Dean comes bursting into the kitchen with a huge grin, sliding across the floor in his socks.
They watch a lot of TV and old movies. They’re nearly foiled by the remote control, before Cas has the bright idea to use his tongue to press the buttons.
“It’s faster,” Sam admitted. “If you can get it, that would be ideal, but I’m not sure if it would apply in this case. There would need to have been a lack of consent...or if one of you had already been married that would be an easy out.”
He’s aching by the time Cas’s tongue laps softly at the head of his cock. Soft, teasing licks that seem to go on forever before Cas takes pity on him and draws the head fully into his mouth and sucks. Without meaning to, Dean’s hips jerk up and Cas groans happily around him, taking him deeper. Dean tangles one hand in the sheets and the other in Cas’s hair as Cas finds his rhythm.
By the time Cas emerged for breakfast, Dean had managed to calm himself down. He had just been surprised, that was all. Caught off guard.
He made his way back to Cas’s place late that evening, feeling like absolute scum. What he found when he returned only made it a million times worse.
Dean folds his hands across his stomach and they settle into a comfortable silence as Castiel chews away at the pork rinds and Dean stares up at the ceiling.
As Dean’s vision swam and his knees were just about to give out, he realized he might be in a bit over his head. There was likely nothing at all he could teach the bona fide sex god going to town on his dick.
And to these two idiots, she is witness. She has watched them, felt their longing for years. Even Baby can see that this is something different; something more profound unfolding against her front seat. And so she envelops them in all the love she can offer them in return. She locks her doors, and keeps them tucked safely out of harm's way.
Then Dean is grappling with his zipper, reaching inside, and Cas’s breath catches in his throat at the first feel of Dean’s hand and he shivers. Dean’s own cock is out and he presses them together, his hand encircling them both. He starts to move his hand up and down, squeezing them together, continuing to grind down.
They sit there together by the tree, watching some of the younger kittens jump around excitedly with Charlie as Cas scritches at Meg’s head. The lights twinkle and shine in Cas’s eyes.
Dean leaned into him, confident this time. As their lips met and their arms found their way around one another, Dean relaxed into it, completely unafraid for once in his life.
The cabin walls are thin, and Castiel can hear Dean’s bed creaking in the next room. He lies perfectly still, willing himself not to think about his best friend and resolutely ignoring the twitch of his own cock. But a few minutes later he hears Dean cursing loudly about thread counts and the creaking stops.
“Huh?” Dean looks confused. He shakes his head and has the audacity to laugh. “I never cared about the porn star, Cas. I stopped closing my eyes after the first day. I never wanted to imagine anyone but you.”
The sun is close to setting by the time he finds a payphone and dials the number he knows by heart. He finds himself holding his breath as it rings, letting it out in a rush when Dean picks up.
“It’s fine, really. Pretend I’m your busty brunette. I’m going to pretend you’re. . . I don’t know, Ernest Hemingway.”
Castiel freezes, a cold dread trickling down his spine. He thinks back again to the field he woke up in— his first solid memory after the rift. How
“Don’t.” Cas laughed bitterly, and tucked the papers away. He cleared his throat and spoke again a little softer. “You don’t have to leave on my account. You can stay in the spare room again, and I’ll submit these first thing tomorrow morning.”
It's all too familiar, and Castiel lets out a sigh of relief at the tangible proof that Dean is alive.
Cas continued to stare at him, ignoring the way Dean was trying wiggle his hips. One hand brushed softly against Dean’s face and a thumb traced his freckles. “There are many other ways I can bring you pleasure if you’re worried about it hurting.”
He finds him sitting on the back bumper of an ambulance— slumped, and head down, but Dean would have recognized that mess of dark hair anywhere.
Dean looks down at Cas’s hand on the couch between them, his long tan fingers splayed wide, making each knuckle stand out. Dean knows these hands. They have high-fived him, and wrestled with him, and held him when his mother died. When these hands were smaller, they caught frogs and lizards and ladybugs— held them carefully before releasing them safely back into the world. There’s the faint outline of a scar on the back of this particular hand from when Cas was thirteen and burnt himself trying to bake cookies.
When he expressed his surprise, Cas pointed out that they hadn’t left the penthouse much while Dean was there. In his trademark blunt and matter of fact way, he said that it was Dean who made him feel confident and less afraid.
Dean thought, as the arm fastened itself around Dean’s torso, holding him tight. He struggled in vain to remember the night before and what poor girl he must have wound up with. His trip to Vegas was off to a predictable start.
He’s so lost in thought that he nearly misses seeing the beige Continental out of the corner of his eye. Dean slams on the brakes and stares. There, parked in a tiny strip mall plaza next to the sleazy motel—that’s nowhere near Cas’s office—is Cas’s ugly-ass car.
“It’s on the flight patterns of migratory birds.” Cas gestured at the documentary that was playing and clutched a pillow to his lap. “I thought I’d just… tune in for a bit before I go to bed.” His face was bright red.
Cas was fastening the third button from the bottom when Dean realized his mouth was hanging open; he snapped it shut and turned around quickly. In his haste to leave he walked headfirst into the doorframe and swore loudly.
“I’ll take her,” Cas said, cutting her off before she could continue. Three sets of eyes turned to look at him. Four, if you counted the cat. “What? I think she’s cute. I’ll give her some food and a warm place to stay tonight, and I’ll drop her off at the vet’s first thing tomorrow when they open. They’ll either find who she belongs to, or find her a new home.”
What had Dean been doing when it happened? Changing the oil in that old Toyota? Taking his coffee break? How could Dean’s world have been so normal today when this had been happening to Cas. Surely, he should have sensed that something was wrong; he should have known. He should have been here sooner.
Cas wakes up in a field. He has a brief moment of unthinking calm in which to feel the sun on his skin. He turns his head to the sky, breathes deeply, then spares a confused glance down at his new attire.
Finally, Cas inched forward, slow and careful, until he was fully seated. Then he stilled again, stroking Dean’s hips. The slight burning sensation gave way to a feeling of incredible fullness. Cas leaned to drape himself over Dean’s back and the change in position had Dean seeing stars. He moaned uncontrollably into the pillow and Cas stroked his hair, kissing down the back of his neck.
Cas is jolted out of his stupor and looks up to see Dean, face flushed and eyes frantic. Right, Castiel’s meant to be playing the part of the busty brunette and definitely not supposed to be enjoying this.
As the bacon sizzled, Dean chatted away, heedless of the fact that Cas couldn’t respond. It was kind of nice— the small weight on his shoulder keeping him company, seemingly content to listen to Dean’s dumb jokes and his offkey humming as he cracked eggs.
Dean’s anger flares back up. “You could have died, Cas. Hell, you almost did.” He jabs an accusatory finger at him. “Maybe don’t keep throwing yourself in front of things that can kill you, hmm?”
"Why do the costumes have to be sexy?" Cas asked, as Dean held various clothes and props up to Cas and pursed his lips in consideration of each one.
“Oh yeah,” Dean said, and pulled Cas over. He had been standing a little behind Dean staring awkwardly at the floor and fidgeting. “This is my....Cas,” he finished, a little unsure of how to introduce him.
Dean’s at the Roadhouse when he gets the call, waiting for Cas to join him for their usual burger and beer. Typically Cas beats him here, orders for them, and has stolen the pickles from Dean’s burger by the time Dean arrives. But Dean enters the Roadhouse to find their table empty, which should have been his first sign that something was wrong.
He turned back to the dresser and locked eyes with Cas who had cocked his head to one side and seemed to be considering Dean. A weighty silence passed between them before Dean cleared his throat and forced a shaky laugh. “Well, I guess that answers the question of what you do all night while we’re sleeping, huh?”
It’s budget season, so Cas has been stretched thin at work lately. But Dean doesn’t understand why Cas would bother staying late to put in extra time for a company he loathes and an asshole boss that’s just going to take all the credit.
He singled out a piece of potato on the end of his spatula and turned to hand it to Cas. Cas, however, opened his mouth expectantly, his eyes closed. Momentarily caught off guard, Dean moved to place the hashbrown carefully on Cas’s tongue. He licked his own lips as he watched Cas’s curl around the end of the spatula.
Cas thought he had experienced most of what humanity had to offer, but he was wrong. This is something else entirely, having the taste of Dean in his mouth. He thought he knew what this was after his time with April but this is altogether different. Everything is brighter, every sensation amplified as if he can feel his grace echoing in Dean.
“Then I think you had a small panic attack.” Cas looked down at him, his eyes full of concern. Then his lips suddenly quirked into a small smile. “I’m not that bad, you know.”
Dean frowns and stops mid-stride. If Castiel didn’t see him then who the hell was he talking to? There’s no one else around in— Dean spins around to be sure and sees the stray cat trotting towards them. It hisses at Dean as it passes and makes its way into Castiel’s waiting arms. Not a stray then. Castiel scoops it up and coos at it softly. “Hi sweetheart. What have you been up to, hmm?”
his brain supplied. And yes, Dean would be here tonight. That would make it worth it, right? He smoothed down his shirt and knocked on the door. He heard yelling from within, and heavy footsteps heading to the door.
The longing surges again, and Castiel is spurred into action, his concern for Dean overriding any lingering uncertainty over his current predicament. He flexes his wings and realizes with irritation that he is still without flight despite the restoration of his grace. He begins walking instead in the general direction from which he can sense Dean, not entirely sure where he's headed yet, just that he needs to move. Needs to find Dean.
He fingered the keys to Cas’s apartment, turning them over in his hand. There was a brass keychain in the shape of a bee hanging off them and small photo of his parrot. Oh god, the bird! Cas was so devoted to that bag of feathers, he’d be devastated if anything happened to it. Dean tried to calculate how long Cas had been gone and the bird left alone, but he couldn’t be certain without knowing when the accident happened, and his thoughts kept circling back to Cas lying cold and alone on concrete.
Sam and Jack leave, and then it’s just the two of them. Dean slurps his coffee loudly. A long moment of silence passes, but it’s comfortable and familiar and Castiel sinks happily into it.
Cas’s apartment was dark and empty when Dean let himself in. He reached over instinctively to flick a light on, and heard the bird startling to rustle around in the other room.
Dean frowned. "I told you, the hospital called. They gave me your keys and I let myself in to feed the bird because I thought—" Dean choked, unable to finish his sentence.
“Let’s… can we back up? Why are you...” Cas struggled for words. “Why are you here? In my kitchen? Why are you—?”
Cas tries one of the shortbreads and lets out a long, lewd moan of pleasure that makes Dean glad he decided to bake.
It’s strange. Normally, Cas gets handsy and gravitates straight into Dean’s space the second he gets home. But the nights that Cas has been late, he’s been weirdly fixated on some immediate need for a shower.
- Description (though not in extreme detail) of severe injuries that have the doctors and Dean wondering if Cas will make it
Cas had thought it was hilarious, and when Dean didn’t get it, he’d sent several exceptionally long texts detailing the taxonomies of bees, wasps, and ants.
“Your friend is fine. We’ve just given him a mild sedative for the shock and if you don’t lay still, you’ll be getting one next.”
“I’ll let you two mull that one over then,” Sam said, standing up. He patted Cas on the shoulder. “Good to have you back, Cas,” he said, and sauntered off to the kitchen with the biggest shit-eating grin Dean had ever seen.
“Yeah, seventeen of them. Garth fixed me up. Knocked me right out with some kind of laughing gas and went to town.”
Dean shook his head and continued. “I don’t know what happened. I was in a parking lot, just sitting in my car. I drank this weird, nasty stuff that Sam gave me to help with my allergies, and then the next thing I knew, I was a cat. Luckily my window was open, so I was able to squirm out and get home.”
The waitress returned with their coffees and Cas placed their order. Dean reluctantly agreed to the Sunrise Special as well, and privately looked forward to it as his stomach continued to grumble. He stared as Cas measured a careful spoonful of honey and stirred it gently into his mug. He raised his eyebrows in question.
Any retort Dean had been about to say dies on his lips and he is left staring slack jawed at Cas’s back as he walks away towards the diner, trench coat flapping behind him.
Yes, that sounded good. Anything to get the hell out of there. Dean collected what he could see of his clothing, keeping the sheet wrapped securely around his lower half, and made his way towards the doorway with as much dignity as he could muster, tripping only once over a bottle of lube that he resolutely ignored. Once outside the bedroom, he saw another door to his right and a large open kitchen and living area off the end of the hallway, but he made a beeline for the other door on the left.
“Is this okay?” Dean asks, and Cas has never known how to say no to Dean. He never wants to, and he certainly doesn’t want to now. Dean’s hand is on Cas’s face, stroking his jaw and Cas is helpless to do anything but stare at the human who is truly his greatest weakness.
“Got you on a flight out of Kansas City that leaves in an hour if you want it,” he said. “You better step on it though, if you want to make it in time.”
His panic intensified as he realized that the figure appeared to be brandishing some sort of weapon held in the air.
“Yep. So they’re technically for me,” Dean grins. “I’ve been taking them for the past couple weeks and spending my lunches with Charlie at the shelter to see how I’d react and build up a tolerance. Doc gave me the all-clear and everything ‘cause it turns out my allergies aren’t all that bad.”
Cas blinks slowly as Dean helps him shrug into his jacket and opens the door against a burst of cold winter air. Dean can see the moment Cas finally comes online. His eyes brighten as they lock on Dean’s for the first time that morning and a soft smile forms on his lips. “I— yes, that sounds delicious. Thank you.” He looks down and squeezes his brown bag lunch. “Dean, I—”
Their clothes come off, Dean’s less suavely than he’d have liked. Whiskey and exhaustion have made all his movements a little clumsy and he gets his foot stuck inside his pants leg, then nearly loses his balance trying to pull off a sock.
“Anyway, the Disney movie is based on the story of The Frog Prince. A spoiled princess accidentally drops a
But one look at Sam’s eager expression and he bit his tongue. Even if it wasn’t a grimoire, it was a beautiful find that was undoubtedly worth much more than Sam had paid for it at a yard sale.
“I don’t understand, why isn’t it healing? The rest of you is fine now, why not your wings? And speaking of which… fucking
Cas flushed pink, and gestured in the direction of Dean’s ringtone. “It sounds like it’s coming from over here,” he muttered.
Staggering with the weight of this newfound awareness, Dean remains quiet through breakfast. He eats his fruit loops solemnly, listening to Cas lament the downward trend of quality cartoon programming since the ones that aired when they were kids. They re-fill their bowls a few more times until sunlight pours into the room, spilling together with Cas’s laughter and the sugary sweetness of the milk.
Sam’s wedding was a tasteful affair.  Nothing, apparently, like the debacle Dean had participated in the previous night.
It wasn’t until that night, when the texts had stopped for good, and Dean was lying in bed alone and listening to his father snore loudly down the hall, that he realized with a sharp pang that he was maybe a little in love with the dorky idiot. And that, just maybe, he had made a terrible mistake by leaving. Dean laughed out loud at the impeccable timing of this particular moment of insight that came with all the grace of a swift kick in the nuts.
When morning finally came, Dean woke with a start to the smell of burning and the blare of a smoke alarm.
The rest of the day passed quickly and Castiel soon lost track of time. He was just putting the finishing touches on a display of books that he had stacked in a careful pyramid near the front counter when the bell over the door chimed.
feeling in his chest intensifies so much he fears for a brief moment that it might shatter into pieces. Shakily, he gives his location and Dean's voice breaks again before he hangs up.
there were more martinis after that, and everything starts to get fuzzy from there. All I can really remember with any clarity is your eyes.”
Cas snorted. Unlikely. His stomach was too unsettled to even consider the pizza Kevin offered, and he settled back on the couch. The jokes and banter of his friends soon had him forgetting why he was there, until Sam got up to put in the DVD and get things started.
