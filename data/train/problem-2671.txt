Anyway, even if they’d been communicating pretty often, Sam had still been very surprised when his brother had gone down to California to visit him for the first time, just as it had rendered him completely speechless the first time

He'd been jealous of Sam—of his courage, of how he’d simply walked away without looking back, how he’d actually had the guts to leave everything he’d ever known behind in order to go after what he wanted. Dean wished he could do that too, he really did, but as it turned out, he was just way too much of a coward to do it.
But that hadn’t happened. Dean wasn't just a useless empty vessel now, which was at the same time a blessing and curse. He was fine physically—or at least he seemed to be mostly okay, anyway. He’d puked up blood, true, and that could only mean that there
course, the damn fucking ghost was standing right behind the fucking couch, as if he actually fucking
And now, because Dean had once again failed at the only thing he had ever actually believed himself to be good at, Cas was lying unconscious on his bed back at that motel, pale and sick and dying, and there was nothing Dean could do about it. He had screwed up again, and now both Sam and Cas were the ones to pay for his mistake. He was such a fuck up. He just ruined
John’s eyebrows rose at those words, and he turned his head to give Dean a surprised look. He opened his mouth, but then closed it shut quickly, swallowing whatever words he’d been about to say before they could actually jump from his lips. He cleared his throat, face earning a calmer expression, more controlled, and he commented casually, “That’s, uh… I’m pleasantly surprised. I mean, this is… this is very good.”
No, in fact, the thing was just staring at him—with only one big, glassy white eye, Dean noticed with satisfaction, since the other one had been reduced to nothing but a bloody, useless hole on the front of the wendigo’s head.
But Cas was the only one who knew why Dean needed a bodyguard, the only one even aware that Heaven was coming their way at all, so Dean couldn't help but wonder what the angel had told Sam and Charlie to explain why Crowley and Juliet would be staying with him, and why the demon had taken him all the way to freaking Canada. Dean got that they might be worried about him getting involved in the fight and aggravating the Mark, just as he understood why they would wish to skip town as quickly as possible to make sure any remaining Stynes would not find them again, so of course they would want Dean out of there quickly, but he knew those simple excuses didn't quite add up to the rest, and both Sam and Charlie were smart enough to figure out that one by themselves, Dean knew that for a fact. He hoped they wouldn't get suspicious about this, but then again he would be telling them about the baby pretty soon, so maybe it didn't really matter.
And that was when he heard it—a loud bang, followed by the sound of an engine struggling to work, apparently under a lot of weight. That sounded a lot like…
that Cas wanted this too—the way he was looking at Dean, the way he’d glanced down at Dean’s freaking mouth, the way his eyes had darkened visibly, a silent question in them that to Dean could only mean Cas had been thinking the same thing Dean had been thinking.
“Castiel,” the sharp tone of Gabriel’s voice was a surprise, “You’re not helping Dean. You’re just giving the Mark something to feed on.”
“Oh, you don’t even know half of it,” she chuckled, and then guided them over to the couch, where they both sat down. Dean placed the food onto the coffee table, already feeling lighter somehow, and he wasn’t sure why. Maybe it was because he was finally seeing his friend again, or maybe it was due to finding out that she didn’t outright hate him. Maybe it was just for being in such a familiar room after so long, where he’d spent so many hours of his life. He was pretty sure it might be a combination of everything.
Finally, Cas’ shoulders sagged as the angel let out a breath. He leaned back, looking relieved, and Sam felt his own body relaxing a little at the sight.
I've calmed down enough now, though. Seriously, JIB8 just swooped in and healed most of the wounds, basically, and now I'm finally convinced that everything will be fine and that Cas will be okay. Jared's slip during his panel with Jensen that confirmed Misha will in fact be in season 13 was basically everything I needed to hear right now, honestly, and now I'm just really curious about how we'll get Cas back. I'm just over here hoping to see Dean doing everything he can to get his angel back next season.
Dean chased the feeling of it, leaning forward and pressing his own lips to Cas’ before the angel could retreat back to his seat, moving his lips just slightly against the angel’s and smiling when he felt Cas respond quite eagerly. The angel leaned forward and into Dean, tilting his head as his tongue darted out of his mouth, licking its way into the hunter’s mouth and earning an actual fucking whimper from Dean.
It took a while for Dean to realize that he’d come back to himself, that he was back in his own body, years after the events he’d just watched happen inside his own head had actually taken place. It was remarkably hard to detach himself from the images he’d just witnessed, to actually force his mind to process what was really real and what had been nothing but a shared memory. Even his shoulders felt weird, lighter than they should be, and as the hunter shifted them a little, wincing when his joints cracked because of the movement, he realized that he could actually feel the phantom sentation of the wings he'd been able to feel there as his own while peeking into Cas' mind, but that of course were no longer there—or rather, that had never truly been there in the first place.
Well, frankly, he wasn’t sure what the hell he’d been expecting to see, but that certainly wasn’t it.
The witch’s features darkened at those words, and she didn’t grace him with an answer. No, she just whipped her hand through the air and snapped his other arm right out of its socket.
Sam tilted his head to the side, nodding to their right, but chose to add a low, “To the right,” once he realized that she probably couldn’t see the movement.
which probably meant that she had the same kind of power as God, and, well, they definitely couldn’t go up against her. That had disaster—the end of the freaking
The silence that took over the room after that wasn’t tense anymore, much to Dean’s relief—in fact, the air around them was lighter than it’d been since the moment he and Sam had set foot in that house last night, like the weight Dean had been carrying around since yesterday was suddenly gone, sent away by Jody’s soothing, supporting words. A spark of something warm and gentle came to life inside his chest, and Dean couldn’t help but smile at the feeling.
Cas simply eyed the bottle for a moment, like he wasn’t sure what exactly Dean wanted him to do with it at first, but soon enough he lifted a hand and grabbed it, letting his hand curl around the glass bottleneck, just about an inch above the spot where Dean’s own hand was wrapped around it. Their skin brushed together briefly, just a slight, fleeting touch that last no more than a second.
Liam had died right in front of Dean’s eyes, torn to fucking shreds by a vengeful spirit, because Dean hadn’t been fast enough to save him. And after that hunt was over, after that damn ghost had finally been dealt with, Dean had had to burn Liam’s body all on his own, which had been a particularly awful, scarring experience that Dean really hoped he’d never have to live through again.
“You don’t have to make a decision right now, Dean,” Castiel added, voice gentle and careful, like he was dealing with a spooked wild animal, which was a pretty accurate analogy, really. “I’m just asking you to give me a chance to change your mind.”
inside of him constantly pacing back and forth, walking around in circles like a tiger locked up in a tiny, cramped cage, just waiting for the right moment to escape.
Dean still didn’t trust that, of course, but he chose not to insist on that subject right now. There was just no point in arguing with Rowena about this, anyway. He definitely didn’t need her to agree with him on this, so why try to convince her? Dean would draw his own conclusions about this, and she had nothing to do with it.
“Now, let’s get you ready to travel. My father will be very thrilled to hear that I’m bringing you home with me, and I’m positive the angel should follow close behind, so
There was pause in Alexander's words, and Dean simply nodded, choosing to remain silent, waiting for the man to speak at his own pace. The painter was clearly struggling to talk, as this was clearly a very difficult subject for him, so pushing him in any way might do the very opposite of helping right now.
Dean still couldn’t really feel anything coming from the bond, though, so he had no idea what exactly Cas was thinking in that moment. “What idea?” he asked, failing miserably to stop a small hint of hope from slipping into his voice.
Cas didn’t immediately argue with him about that one, which was to be expected, because Dean knew he really was to blame for that one.
, like a rabid dog fuming at the mouth. Dean shook his head, attempting to clear it as he parked the Impala, got out of it and marched over to the sliding hospital doors.
Dean lifted a hand up to his forehead at those words, touching the spot where he believed that bullet must have pierced his skull, but he found nothing more than soft skin and some dry blood there, not even a single hint of a wound left to the story.
Meg shoved Dean as soon as they walked into the living room, and he fell to the floor with a low grunt, stretching his free arm in front of himself quickly and just in time to break his fall and avoid hitting his face on the wooden floorboards right in front of him. He turned around quickly on his spot on the floor, lifting his head to glare at Meg.
Because Sam was right—of course he was. Regardless of anything that’d happened when Cas died, or even of how much Dean simply
He shook his head quickly, frantically. “No, I’m not doing that,” he hurried to say, words coming out breathy and shaky. “I’m not turning into a… a
weird, because Sam and Eileen hadn’t spent a night in here yet, so Dean didn’t need to be mindful of where he sat on the bed, at least.
Castiel's dislike for her had been steadily growing up until now, and that reaction only sped up the process even more.
For some reason, the fact that he’d never said it to Sammy either also started to bother him, weighing heavily in his mind when he’d never even thought about it before, and honestly, now that he actually thought about it… he couldn’t actually understand why it was just so fucking hard for him to do it; just to freaking say it. It was just like one of those things he knew his brother already knew so he didn’t need to actually say it out loud, and it had always been like that so he didn’t want to be the one to change it. He’d never even tried to.
“You’ll have company tonight, then, I gather?” Those blue eyes were focused on Dean again, that weird, unnerving intensity suddenly back in them, and the man found himself shifting his weight uncomfortably under that eerily blue gaze once more.
The others followed without a word, and once all of them were standing back out in the dirty, darkened hallway, Charlie hurried to close the door behind them, shutting that room off from the rest of the world—at least for now.
Alexander regarded Dean for a long moment, as though trying to decide whether or not he could really trust what he’d just heard. Dean really was expecting the guy to just tell them to go to Hell and slam that door at any second now, so he was honestly surprised when the next thing that came out of the man's mouth was a low, "Do you know what happened to James? What
Cas still looked all tense and bothered, but he seemed to sense the human’s discomfort, so he stepped toward Dean and enveloped him in his arms from behind, pressing a few gentle kisses to the side of Dean’s throat, and while he didn’t say anything, it already made Dean feel better. He let his head fall back, closing his eyes and letting himself get lost in the feeling of Cas’ lips dragging over his skin, at the hold the angel had on his hips, the heat of his body pressed close.
"It doesn't have to," Cas whispered easily, without a beat of hesitation. "Dean, I don't think you understand the sacrifices you make every day. You've devoted pretty much your entire life to saving people, to making this world a better place. You've
Cas’ hand moved to grip at the top of the hunter’s head at those words, and Dean looked up to catch just another glimpse of the angel’s disheveled figure before he dove forward once more, this time actually taking Cas into his mouth.
He parked the Impala as close as he could to the side entrance and shut off the engine. He looked around, taking in the various cars around him before he locked the Impala and crossed the parking lot in quick, paced strides, eager to be done with this and go back to the Bunker. The uneasiness he always felt when he was away from Dean had begun to settle into his bones the moment he’d left the Bunker, and it was already beginning to bother him.
the bodies, and it hadn’t been pretty. Honestly, he would very much rather that they just killed him quickly, right here, right now.
He actually wanted to try something that they hadn’t done before; that he had actually only done once before, and while it had felt pretty good that one time, he knew that it would feel a thousand times better with Cas, as it seemed to have been the case with everything else they’d done so far.
"I'm okay, guys, seriously," Dean insisted, and maybe his words came out a little harsher than he'd meant them to, but at least it got Sam to pause and settle back against his seat a bit. "I'm just... I don't know, anxious, I guess. But I'm fine, really."
Sam's eyebrows rose a bit as he finally seemed to understand why he'd heard so much noise coming from this room earlier, but he just nodded, falling silent. That new pause stretched on for a while, actually, and throughout all of it, Sam kept his gaze focused solely on the floor—or, more specifically, on the shadow of the wing closest to him.
A startled huff jumped from his mouth when it happened, and he froze for a moment, silently hoping that the muscles on his back had received most of the impact. Much to his relief, he didn't feel anything bad or worrying in the seconds that followed—no pain or odd sensation came from his abdomen, so he assumed the baby was fine.
And that, right there, was a punch to the gut, or maybe a stab; the latter seemed a lot more accurate, to be honest. So Cas
The moment the name was out of his lips Charlie tensed up entirely, her shock clear in her features for a beat, but she hid it away pretty quickly. She swallowed, shifting on her chair, clearly uncomfortable as she glanced briefly at her computer screen, almost like she was looking for a response there. It was a very odd sight, such an out of character behavior for Charlie that all Sam could find himself doing was waiting for her to finally say something.
The scream that cut through the air was truly a surprise, making Sam pause his pacing at last as he jumped in surprise. It echoed through the entire barn for only a moment, although it played endlessly inside Sam’s head after it was over. He was frozen for a second before it really sunk in that it had been
"Yeah," Dean nodded as well, albeit a lot more weakly, "You too." All he got in response to that was a slow, tense nod. He swallowed drily, before glancing over at the dog bed by the farthest wall of the room, where Juliet was currently watching them both with curious eyes. "I'm pretty sure it's time to check her bandages, by the way. They might need changing."
“Thanks, Sammy.” The words came out whispery and a little weak, but Sam smiled in response, almost relieved that Dean had actually believed him, like he had believed his brother wouldn’t somehow. Dean looked down again, taking in a deep breath to try and steady himself before any tear managed to break through. And as relieved as he was that Sam had taken this so well, this conversation wasn’t over just yet, so he gathered all the courage that had blossomed in his chest with Sam's acceptance before it faded away and said, “Anyway, there’s kind of a reason why I’m telling you this now.”
Castiel jumped, his eyes wide, head snapping up to take in the room around him once again, because that voice had sounded far too loud and clear to have come from outside, but quickly enough he realized that it must have. The door of that room was still closed, and he was still alone apart from Ava’s unconscious form.
Castiel could only nod in agreement, finding it pointless to even attempt to argue or comment on the matter.
"I did not receive the title of ruler of Heaven, or of the... 'boss' as you so insistently call it, for anything other than trust," Hannah said, shaking her head once more, though the movement looked so much weaker now. Her voice had lost its edge, earning what sounded like a tired tone. It was almost like she'd suddenly lost the strength to keep up that hard, confident front. "The other angels trust me to do the right thing, to ensure that Heaven functions the way our Father intended it to, and that means making sure that all His rules are followed by every single one of us." She let out another breath, before turning her head slightly, just so she could glance over at their small group several feet away, two of which were still kneeling on the ground. Her eyes found Castiel, and for some reason, they looked almost... sad, which was a very odd sight to see, though it was still enough to make her look so much more like the Hannah Castiel had once come to know. He had certainly not expected the sight of it right now, though that did not mean that the change in her demeanor was not welcome in any way. "The angels hate you, Castiel. All of them. So if I even tried to change their minds about this, even if I wished to do that, they would consider it treason. Heaven will see this nephilim dead, no matter who is in charge of making that happen."
He wasn't choking anymore, Dean realized that now. He could breathe again, and while the taste of blood still clung strongly to the inside of his mouth, he knew that the cut on his throat had been healed. With a strong pull, the restraints broke, as if suddenly they had been weakened, shattering as if made of glass. None of it made sense, true, but now that Dean knew this was happening inside his head, he didn’t dwell much on it. He just pounced, feeling a strength he hadn’t quite had before running through his veins as he delivered a punch straight into Alastair’s face, and the demon stumbled to the side.
Dean mentally sighed in relief when he realized that Jo had actually let him get away with his obvious attempt to change the subject.
Charlie and Sam were quite intent on trying, though, struggling for hours to try to understand how to use the codex to read the Book, copying and comparing symbols nonstop, trying to find the patterns, the logic behind what was written in the codex. Charlie even had her laptop running some algorithms to try and find matches, to figure out patterns, with no luck so far. They didn’t seem to be making any progress with it at all, but again, they were insistent.
"But I mean it, Cas," he whispered. His voice sounded far too small and weak, but he didn't let that stop him. "I really need you to do this. Just... just do it, please."
It was all true, and Dean hated it. John had indeed looked at him differently after the night in Georgia when Dean had pretty much come out to his father without meaning to. He hadn’t actually said he wasn’t straight, true, but just enquiring about how to ask out someone from the same gender was bound to be enough to accomplish that on its own.
needed this. He really thought he would die then, and he was more than glad to find out he was still alive.
When Dean went back inside the waiting room, he was very much aware of all the eyes that followed him, watching every move he made with careful attention, but he wasn’t at all bothered by the stares. He felt much better now, knowing that Cas would be here soon to patch up whatever the doctors couldn’t fix. He was still nervous, obviously, because Sam was still struggling and in surgery, but this was a light at the end of the tunnel and Dean would hold on to it for as long as he needed to.
And that was coming from someone who had dealt with the supernatural, with the weird, impossible to explain stuff throughout his entire life, so that was really saying something.
Well, that kind of made sense. Dean’s first instinct was to reprimand Cas for even going after the demons in the first place, but he held any comment back, swallowing the words before they could jump off his tongue without his consent. This was not the time.
Charlie didn’t respond, as if afraid to talk. She shook her head lightly, however, a clear question in her eyes, and that was enough for Sam to continue.
She was also the only one Dean actually talked to at the garage apart from Bobby (and Garth, kind of, but that one was a bit debatable), which was kind of hilarious, and maybe a little ridiculous if you really think about it, considering that she was a good 10 years younger than him, but it was the truth anyway. The two other employees Dean had to share his workspace with at the moment were Cole and Gordon, and those two weren’t exactly friendly toward him; they didn’t even talk to him at all throughout the work days. Or ever.
Dean nodded, thankful for the fact that Bobby had been a paranoid bastard and had had so many safe houses spread all over the country. They really came in handy sometimes, although not so much now that they had the Bunker.
"Mornin', sheriff." Dean gave the man a professional smile and a small nod of his head once they were inside Henriksen's office. He pulled out his badge, letting it flip open as he held it up in a smooth, practiced movement. "I'm special agent Hetfield, and this is my partner, special agent Burton." He gestured at Castiel, silently praying that the guy wouldn't fuck this up, and for a moment, the hunter was
Dean was pretty sure he must have paled a bit at that question, but he did his best to conceal his panic, especially when Jody’s eyes settled on his bottle in particular, a clear frown forming in her brows.
“They still in Des Moines?” he asked as he finally resumed walking, and Cas fell in place by his side quickly as they continued to make their way to the Bunker’s kitchen.
The bartender was quick to wander back over when that happened, probably to get the new customer’s order.
But then again, Dean himself wasn’t exactly a good example when it came to getting over that sort of thing, to dealing with such a huge, overwhelming amount of guilt. He might even be worse than Cas in that regard, which also meant that Dean knew too well that Cas wouldn’t be easily convinced, that whatever the hunter told the angel to try and make him feel better would probably fall on deaf years, and that nothing the human said right now would be enough to send away all that guilt. He knew words wouldn’t be enough to change the seraph’s mind, just like they wouldn’t be enough to change Dean’s own.
a bit scared of Jody Mills, although he knew he had no real reason to worry, that Jody would never need to actually… ‘come after him’, as she’d put it.
"Dean?" the angel asked, worry practically dripping from his words. His eyes were wide and fearful as they searched the hunter's face again, looking for something in the human's features just as they'd done before, though his gaze seemed even more intense now, more urgent. "Am I hurting you? Do you want me to stop?"
He couldn't choose, so he decided to just get a bunch of stuff out and see what he felt like putting into a sandwich as he made it. Yeah, that sounded like a great idea. It had been a while since he’d last made a good, big sandwich for himself, and he already couldn’t stop thinking about it.
Dean frowned in confusion, still panting as he leaned away from Cas so that he could have a proper look at the seraph's face, and his confusion only grew when found the angel staring at him with wide eyes. The seraph actually looked alarmed, worry painting his features, clouding his gaze, though Dean had no freaking idea why.
. He’d been troubled, back then, struggling to resist the Mark, fighting its poisonous influence every single second of every day—which definitely hadn’t been easy, so maybe that explained it.
“Something like our case has never happened before, ever. We bonded and conceived naturally. If it weren’t for the Mark and my Grace, Dean and the nephilim would be completely healthy.”
He didn’t get an answer, of course. His mother’s grave remained exactly the way it’d been throughout that entire conversation—unmoving and completely silent. There was a slight breeze coming in now, and it made the leaves on the trees around him rustle softly, swaying with the wind.
Hannah cleared her throat just a few seconds later, and Castiel finally forced himself to look back up at her at the sound of it. Her eyes were sad, filled with something heavy, something ugly and awful, which let Castiel know just how much of a toll this whole situation was taking on his friend as well. This wasn’t easy for her either, and Castiel almost wanted to hug her, to try and make her feel better—he
“So, Mr. Olsen,” Dean started as he sat down on the chair placed in front of the desk in the guy's office, having already identified himself as a federal agent. He did his best not to make eye contact with a particularly creepy beaver as he talked, “I’m looking for a guy, and I’ve been told he might have rented one of your cabins.”
He nodded toward the others—meaning not just Charlie and Balthazar, but all the other hybrids as well. All the people who’d been kidnapped and turned over the course of the past seven years. “What’s the end goal here?”
Dean paused, swallowing thickly. He’d been kinda hoping that Cas wouldn’t ask about those, but, well, it wasn’t like he could actually try and hide them now.
Morning came too fast and too slowly at the same time, and Dean groaned as he forced himself to get up from the bed, feeling his body complain at the lack of rest he’d gotten throughout the night, but he had no choice but to get up because really needed to pee. He looked over at Cas, where the angel still slept peacefully on the bed, and he made sure to move extra quietly not to wake him up. Cas needed to sleep, and Dean would let him get as much of it as he needed. At least one of them should get some good rest.
nervous about. I've actually talked about this in the comments before, but I've tried to be a bit subtle about it in the story until now. There are actually two, well... risky ideas for this story that I haven't been able to push away and that I really wanted to add, but that I've been worrying about for over a year now, and I've finally decided to add them both. One of them is introduced in this chapter, though not entirely (you'll get what I mean after reading ;) ). So, please keep an open mind.<3 :)
all of a sudden, even if that didn't make any sense. Angels didn't get tired, so Dean really had no idea what to make of that sight.
Those doubts plagued him for a few seconds, but after a brief moment of consideration, Castiel eventually came to the conclusion that maybe that scenario wasn’t as impossible as he would like to think.
“Get away from them,” Dean let out through his gritted teeth, and he was surprised by the strength in his voice as he spoke.
Castiel didn’t immediately look at Dean. No, the blue-eyed hybrid simply looked down at the counter right in front of him as he waited for the bartender to bring him his beer, following the patterns marked in the wood with the tip of his forefinger, and when a nice, cold bottle of beer was placed right in front of him, he simply gave the bartender a quick nod in thanks, then curled a hand around the bottle and brought it up to his lips without a moment of hesitation, taking a couple of big, thirsty gulps from it.
But for that, Cas needed to wake up, and all Dean could do until that happened was wait. So that was what he did, watching over the angel through the night. The thought actually had him smiling a little, even considering the circumstances, because the irony of it was a little amusing. Cas would find it amusing, at least, Dean was pretty sure of that.
The sound made the angel open his eyes, nothing more than two blue slits looking at Dean for a second before there as a mouth against his, pushing and sucking, as well as a tongue licking into his mouth, starving and demanding, and the hunter groaned as he realized that Cas could probably taste himself on his tongue.
Jody nodded again, also getting up from her chair. “Yeah, sure, I get that. I honestly forgot it was so late. Let me show you guys out.”
kind of explanation on the hunt, which meant telling him that Gabriel was alive and kicking, but he’d have to find a way to leave everything out of the story in some way that would be convincing enough for Sam to buy it, because ‘Hey, bro, I’m pregnant with a forbidden half-angel baby, and by the way, it’s Cas’, we’re together now, and it's very,
Juliet seemed to wake up just as Dean finished getting dressed, and she let out a low whine at him, blinking those big red eyes at the human, which of course had the hunter walking over to her little dog bed to pet her a little. He kneeled down beside her and then shushed her softly when she continued to make noise, running his hands through the fur on her head and back. "You gotta be quiet, girl," he whispered, mindful of the volume of his voice, because he definitely did not want to wake Cas. "Don't make noise, okay? Cas needs to rest." Again, he wasn't sure how much exactly Juliet understood—he really should talk to Crowley about that—but he took it as a response from her that she immediately stopped whining as soon as he said it.
“Enough!” Hannah exclaimed sharply, and quickly, before anyone could even process what she was doing, her hand darted forward, aiming to grab Cas’ arm.
universe in there, and that… that might catch the Shadow’s attention. One live human might go unnoticed. Anything more than that would be too risky.”
"Sam, wait!" Charlie called out after him, though she was clearly being very mindful of the volume of her voice. Sam turned back around, frowning confusedly at the girl. "Cas asked me to tell you to wait to go up there. He's afraid to wake up Dean. Apparently Dean's... not taking this well, and he was in a lot of pain when he was awake, so Cas is pretty worried about stress."
“I’m so sorry, Cas.” His voice trembled, words nothing more than a pained, tentative whisper as he let his hand move lower to caress the angel’s cheek, wincing as his skin rubbed against one of the cuts on the seraph’s face. The blood around it was already pretty much dry, rough to the touch, and Dean wondered just how long it had been since Cas had been back on Earth before Gabriel had actually found him. He guessed at least a couple of hours, and his heart clenched at the thought of Cas, wounded and alone somewhere out there, probably in the middle of the fucking woods if his state was anything to go by, worried about what had happened to Dean and the baby after he’d been banished, but too weak to move or call for help, completely helpless if Heaven had somehow found him first.
Cas must have felt something through the bond, because he tore their mouths apart again as soon as that thought crossed the hunter’s mind. He started moving lower, mouthing at the hunter's neck for a moment, licking and biting at the skin there and causing the human's back to arch, a series of pleasured gasps jumping from the hunter's parted lips, his hands tightening, fingernails digging into the angel's skin. Cas didn't linger there for too long, though, and soon enough, the seraph was trailing kisses down Dean’s chest and all over his swollen belly, until his lips were finally,
They didn’t move for a long time—probably close to an hour, but eventually, Jack’s sobs faded into quiet sniffles, and his tears finally dried, leaving glistening trails on cheeks.
”And we’re really not splitting up?” Crowley asked, not for the first time since they’d drawn up their plan.
It was surprisingly easy to fall asleep that night, and soon enough he drifted into a restful, dreamless sleep.
So that’s how Dean found himself here, holed up in his motel room in the outskirts of Austin, Texas, holding a bottle of cheap whiskey in his hand, tipping it onto a cloth so that he could at least try to clean up those gashes. He’d cleaned most of the blood away from the cuts, and he'd already stitched them up—which had been the very
Castiel didn't seem bothered by the overly personal question, though. Instead, he simply shrugged, not sounding uncomfortable at all as he answered, "One of my brothers would call me Cassie just to spite me, and for some reason, because apparently I have
It took a lot of maneuvering from Sam and Charlie (and Dean, even though the other two weren't happy about it), and they had to lift Cas partially here and there so they could remove the dirty sheets and place the clean ones under the angel, but in the end they managed, and soon enough Cas was lying on a clean set of sheets and had been carefully tucked in under a warm blanket, looking just as peaceful as he had before.
Dean shifted his weight on the bed awkwardly at that thought, swallowing drily. His voice came out a bit hoarse when he asked, "Does it really look that bad?"
There was a glass of water being offered to him, held up by Sam in a silent request for him to take it, which Dean had not noticed before, and he could only assume Charlie had been the one to bring it as Sam had all but carried him here and could not have possibly been holding that earlier.
It was only then that Sam realized how weak Cas’ hold on his brother was. The angel was pale, face bruised, his eyes wide and startled as he glanced up to meet Sam’s gaze for just a moment. The look on his face was empty, eyes almost glazed over, as if made of glass, like he wasn't actually there. The angel choked up a little as well, a mouthful of blood appearing between his parted lips as his eyes rolled to the back of his head, and suddenly Cas was dead weight too and the three of them tumbled to the ground, Sam struggling to keep them both up or at least try to soften the fall and not let them fall over each other, but barely managing it.
Cas was still asleep, and Dean moved as silently as he could as he made his way across the room and over to their bags, quickly choosing a plain dark gray shirt and a clean pair of black sweatpants from inside his duffel, deciding to remain barefooted for now.
“Is there…” Sam swallowed, and Dean tore his eyes away from Cas to look back at the pair, finding both his brother and Charlie looking incredibly uncomfortable, like they didn’t quite know what to do with themselves. “Do you need anything else? I mean, we can…” He didn’t seem quite sure how to finish that, so instead Sam just let his voice linger in the air.
Castiel closed his eyes, feeling once more the terrible tendrils of dread crawling their ways into his mind. He couldn’t even imagine what it would be like to lose them; couldn’t even allow the thought of it into his head.
“Well, someone's caught up quickly,” Gabriel finally said, apparently having decided that yes, Sam really was serious—whatever the hell
He was very glad that he’d decided to turn a considerable distance away from the campsite, because that meant he could shift back without worrying about getting caught. Still, he made sure to keep quiet, biting back all the pained screams that climbed up his throat as his bones and joints snapped and rearranged themselves inside of him, allowing nothing more than a few grunts and moans to escape his mouth while the change happened.
Castiel handed both items over without question, one at a time, and Dean put both of them away inside the Impala's trunk right beside his own bag—
The days passed, and eventually Sam realized he wouldn’t manage to talk to Dean about this, didn't even know if he wanted to, mostly because he somehow knew it wouldn't make a difference. So he decided to give it a shot with Cas. He hadn’t talked to the angel alone after Dean and Cas had gotten back to the Bunker, hadn’t had the chance to, honestly, because either Dean or Charlie, usually both, were just always in the same room as them, either doing research or eating a meal or watching something, and Dean and Cas usually went to bed together and before Sam and Charlie.
When he finally came to again, he was panting against Cas, lying on top of the angel because somehow they had collapsed onto the bed. Cas' own breathing was labored, heavy, his chest rising and falling quickly, his heart racing against Dean's own ribcage.
It was in that moment that someone emerged from inside the cabin, and much to Castiel’s panic, the first person to step through the open doorway only about twenty feet away and out into the night, blade gripped tightly in his hand and shining under the moonlight that currently washed over everything around them, was Dean, though he was followed closely by Sam. However, as worried as Castiel felt to see Dean come outside and, in consequence, place himself far too close to the threat posed by Hannah and Afriel, it did make the seraph's chest feel just a tiny bit lighter to notice that Dean truly seemed to have escaped whatever fight he'd participated in inside the cabin completely unscathed. He was apparently simply a bit breathless, unlike Sam, whose forehead was stained with blood from what must have been a fairly strong blow to his head and whose arm was currently held close to his torso, his elbow bent so that the limb was pretty much pressed against his chest, as though the human was overly aware that trying to stretch it or move it in any way might bring him pain. In his other hand resided another blade, and the arm he was using to hold it seemed functional, at least.
Another smile formed on her lips, but this time it was smaller, shier, not a sign of happiness at all. Her gaze still looked heavy, but it shifted again and Dean had no idea how to understand what he was seeing. There was suddenly a hint of something else in her eyes; something so close to sadness that he wasn’t sure how to process the change. “You value your family above anything else, don’t you, Dean?”
But he could not help it. Every single cell of his body, every ounce of energy of his very being was telling him that all that mattered was protecting his mate and child; to make sure they were both safe.
So, yeah, Dean had no idea why the guy was being so friendly right now. Truth be told, he was a bit of a dick to all the people who weren’t part of the football team, or cheerleaders. Or pretty girls who batted their eyes at him whenever he walked by.
. It would have been quick and easy, and then this whole nightmare would have been avoided, and he wouldn't be in this situation right now. He wouldn't be feeling like this.
that currently made up his thoughts, of the unruly storm of emotions that were currently wreaking havoc inside his head.
Instead, he kept talking, and the next words that came out of his mouth were definitely not something Bobby had expected to hear.
Castiel’s reactions were still a bit delayed, of course, as the brief pause in the actual physical fight that this conversation had provided had obviously not given him enough time to recover from all the wounds he'd received so far, but fortunately he was still fast enough to block the first blow Afriel attempted to deliver upon him, jumping backwards to avoid getting a slash right across his chest and wincing at the pain that erupted from his wounded leg when he had to abruptly support his weight on it. He ignored the pain, however, regaining his balance quickly and lifting his own blade so it could clash against Afriel’s in the air when the other angel attempted to hit him again. And after successfully blocking her second blow, Castiel pushed Afriel back, taking advantage of the momentum from the shove to deliver a punch to his opponent's jaw, which sent her reeling back even more and knocked her off balance enough so that Castiel managed to deliver a kick to her front with his bad leg, causing her to finally tumble backwards and down to the ground.
do that to Jess. The last thing he wanted was to hurt her, and that was exactly what would happen if Sam walked out their front door to pick up where he’d left off, to go back to the life he’d walked away from over a decade ago.
Claire’s expression was pretty hard to read right then. It was like a mask, really, her features smooth and not giving away anything about where exactly her mind was at, about what her thoughts on what she’d just heard truly were, though there was a pretty intense look in her eyes, her blue gaze piercing and completely focused on Cas’ face for a long, seemingly endless moment.
Jody snorted. “Well, that’s quite an image. I gotta say.” She turned on the water, soaping up some plates and just focusing on rubbing them clean for a moment. She rinsed them carefully, before shutting off the water again and placing them on top of all the other clean dishes for Dean to dry. “But that’s not really what I meant. I mean, sure, I guess I
Dean turned his head to the side, giving Cas a surprised and confused look, a frown taking over his brows as he waited for an explanation.
Dean could lose the baby because of this, if they made even the tiniest mistake. His brother really needed to rest right now, for both himself and the baby, and they really shouldn't try to move him. They couldn't
And now he was here, standing on the Speights’ front porch, hand poised right above the doorbell as he tried to find the courage to press it.
This time, when a startled silence took place between them, instead of refusing to look at Charlie, Dean raised his head and made himself meet her inquiring gaze, taking in the heavy frown that’d settled in her brows, along with the confusion that was so clearly painted all across her features. Her green eyes kept darting back and forth all over the hunter’s face, like she might be able to figure out the meaning behind his words if she looked hard enough.
Part of him wasn't completely certain of that last part, as sometimes Castiel still caught himself wondering if there was something wrong with him, something broken that had made him so different from the rest of Heaven, but he pushed that part of himself away as hard as he could, hiding it from sight where Hannah would not be able to see it. He couldn't show any hint of doubt now, and he knew that.
Sam's voice was careful, like he was still considering Dean's answer, and while that made Dean a little nervous, he still found himself holding in the sigh of pure relief that threatened to tear out of his lips at those words. He did allow his eyes to fall closed as he relaxed in the car seat, though. For a second, he had been sure Sam
“He knew about it when Dean first got the Mark,” Sam recalled how Cas had instantly sense the Mark on Dean’s arm the first day they’d met after Dean and Crowley went to visit Cain, like he had just
“Don’t,” was all Dean managed to let out, the word coming out choked in his suddenly seemingly clogged throat, and then he was out the door. He heard Cas calling out for behind as he left, but then Dean heard Gabriel’s voice a second later, the words low and muffled because of the distance, the sound for some reason calm and demanding. With one glance back at the house, Dean realized Cas wasn’t following him, so he assumed Gabriel had told Cas not to.
would that have been? After everything he’d been through over the last 15 years—stopping Apocalypse after Apocalypse, getting caught up in more than one war between Heaven and Hell, after spending over a damn year in Purgatory, killing Azazel, Cain, Abaddon, and the original Death
The spell was rather simple, much simpler than many of the others he had cast throughout his existence, and although it had taken him days of incessant research on his own—he could not ask another angel for help, he would not dare, not with this—he should have no problem with it. And even so, he felt nervous. The weight of what might occur if he failed floated over his head like a dark, black cloud. He could not fail.
When he was finally wearing his usual clothes (an old flannel, a pair of worn, faded jeans and heavy boots around his feet), Dean got the cleaning materials out of the shopping bags, deciding it was time to get to work.
And now Dean was frowning. Suddenly the gash on Cas’ arm made sense, but the rest of it didn’t. “How did you have my blood?” Dean didn’t mean for his words to come out as harsh as they did, but he didn’t exactly try to stop it.
Sometimes Sam and Charlie would break out the beers, though, and of course Dean would refuse them every time. Cas would too, maybe for compassion for him, or maybe because of his Grace, Dean didn’t know. What he knew was that he felt uneasy every time Sam pointed out that one beer wouldn’t do any harm and he had to insist that he really shouldn’t have even one without really having a reason to. He would have broken already had this been over a month ago, before Absarokee, and that thought never failed to send a chill down his spine, because he hadn't known before then that he
Cas perked up a bit when that happened, for the first time since his last coughing fit moving from where he’d been leaning against Dean, sitting up a little straighter on the couch to watch as the archangel quickly crossed the room with quick, hurried steps so that he could deposit the last two items he’d brought with him onto the kitchen table with the rest of the ingredients. Dean almost wanted to pull Cas back down and tell him that he shouldn’t be using any of his precious energy right now, but the seraph's eyes did seem a lot more alert all of a sudden, which might mean that maybe all the resting the angel had been doing up until now really had paid off and he was feeling a bit better, so the hunter remained quiet instead.
He didn’t go straight for the bathroom once he was inside the room, though. First he got out of his clothes, grabbing a clear shirt and a pair of unused boxers from his duffel, before finally taking the clothes and the small bag from the drugstore into the bathroom and closing the door behind himself, but not locking it.
So he’d done nothing more than wonder quietly, letting Dean and Cas have the normality they wanted, let them feel comfortable and welcome, accepted, because Sam was convinced that was what they needed, and he was determined to give it to them.
“He went out for a walk,” Charlie provided. “He didn’t say where he was going, though. It just… it sounded like he just wanted to be alone for a while.”
"If he's up for it, yeah, that would make things a lot easier," Charlie nodded at him, smiling a little more surely now, looking more confident than she had before. But then turned her head to the side, her face falling slightly as her eyes found the silent angel sitting next to Dean. “Cas?” Her tone was hopeful, but there was a hint of hesitance in her voice, something suddenly holding her excitement back quite a lot, like someone stomping on a campfire, letting a few coals still shine with heat, but making the bigger, stronger flames die under their heavy steps.
Dean wasn’t sure how exactly he’d managed to get away from that whole situation so easily, but he definitely wasn’t going to question it. He just counted himself lucky that Sam hadn’t stood up from that chair and tried to stop him, that he hadn't started yammering on about all the reasons why Jack’s plan was too risky, or about how Dean shouldn’t just jump into it like this, how they needed to
“There’s really not much,” she insisted. “One moment, I was getting ready for bed, getting a glass of water in the kitchen, and suddenly… someone was just
“What's going on down there?” he asked, eyeing Crowley wearily. It seemed odd that if this was really a rescue plan, that the demon would be here alone, with none of the others, and Dean really didn’t like the feeling that thought brought to him.
Thank you all for being so supportive, guys!<3 Seeing all your comments and kudos are the highlights of my day. :)
Dean nodded, because he had already imagined that would be the case. And not only that, but everything pointed toward that one guy he had met at the bar and they had seen leaving Margaret’s house that same morning. He had to be the one behind all of this, but they weren’t even close to figuring out who and what he was exactly, just as they had no idea how to find him again. The guy just seemed to appear and disappear without a pattern, without leaving any trace for them to follow, which made him all the more unpredictable. And that was extremely inconvenient for them.
The angel didn’t seem startled at all by the sound of his name, as if he had been expecting Sam to talk again anyway, just had been waiting for it patiently, which Sam now realized must have been the case. But then again, Sam had been kind of just awkwardly lingering by the door without saying anything, so of course Cas would be able to understand that on his own.
So he moved his hand straight for Cas’ ass, one finger sliding into the angel’s hole just a beat later, and as he moved his digit in and out once more, he realized that the seraph was already loose enough for him to slip another one in, so that was what he did next. Careful and slow, the hunter added another finger, letting it slide in place alongside the other one, feeling Cas tense around him with a short, low gasp flying from him lips.
This had been a doomed idea from the start. This whole plan had been bound to end terribly, and Sam had known that, but why had he allowed it to happen, then? He should have stopped Dean, he shouldn’t have let him do this. He should—
But thinking about what he should have done differently wouldn’t help him now. No, right now, he had to figure out what he would be doing
The silence around them was heavy, hanging over their heads like a dark, stormy cloud that didn’t seem willing to go away any time soon.
“What killed Peter wasn’t an Angel Blade, Cas, you said it yourself,” Dean explained, his words certain and eager, though he still kept his voice low, nothing more than an urgent whisper. He should probably try to be quiet, he figured, in case the Grigori was anywhere close by. “The point of entrance was way too wide, and the blade must have had a hilt on it to create those marks around the actual stab wound. What killed Ronnie was an Angel
Cas continued to cough and wheeze, his skin growing redder with every second that passed, making the fact that he was having so much trouble breathing—or rather, that he actually seemed to be
Rowena smiled at him, chuckling, “Oh, aren’t you sweet. But it is true, unfortunately. I’m afraid I’m a few centuries older than I look.”
“Yeah,” Sam remembered how Cas had said pretty much the same thing the first time they’d introduced him to all the books the Bunker housed, “Too bad they apparently have nothing on what we really need.” Or at least that was the result he had gotten so far, because he had yet to find one single useful mention of the Mark of Cain in a book in this place. He was already starting to believe maybe he wouldn’t find any, which sent a wave of pure despair through his being every time the single thought of it as much as crossed his mind. He had to find something; there
But that created a problem. If Castiel was truly going to tell them the truth about Dean’s pregnancy, then he wanted to tell them both at the same time. It seemed only logical, as it would buy them time, and it would be easier, anyway. Also, they should have her with them regardless, because they would need as much help as they could get to rescue Dean. But Charlie was back at the cabin with no way to drive to them, as both cars were here with them. To meet up with her, they would have to go back to the cabin, but if they did then the Stynes—
to convince me I wasn’t ready to hunt, but I shut him down pretty quickly,” Eileen pointed out. “And I’m perfectly fine to hunt, thank you. I don’t even need to wear the sling all the time anymore. My shoulder’s mostly healed by now.”
Castiel moved then, claiming the seat at the head of the table, beside Rowena and Balthazar, which left Dean with three options—the chair at the other end of the table, which had two empty chairs on either side of it and would make him look utterly antisocial (and maybe a little rude, too), the seat beside Benny and the one beside Crowley.
The hunter nodded again. “Yeah, maybe. I wasn’t too worried about it. I mean, that thing didn’t really know how to fight—it just flailed around more than anything else.” He rolled his right shoulder, remembering the sharp sting that he’d felt when the wendigo had managed to bury its teeth into his flesh. He flinched at the memory. “Had a hell of a bite, though. I gotta give it that, at least.”
“Cas…” Dean’s voice was just a broken whisper as he gazed into the angel’s azure eyes, and then down at the chapped lips that had touched his own only a couple seconds ago. They had felt so warm and surprisingly soft, even better than Dean had imagined, but the contact had been so brief, so fleeting, that he wanted to do it again, wanted to
while the Shadow was still busy putting all those souls back to sleep. If they missed this window of opportunity, they might never get another chance like this again—of sneaking into the Empty unnoticed and maybe, just
But no matter how many times his mind replayed those words, no matter how a part of him clung to them for dear life, he just couldn’t quite get himself to believe them.
“It took you months to recover from Hell, Dean, and you were not bearing the Mark of Cain back then,” was all Cas said in response.
Before he could change his mind about it—or, well, before his conscience had a chance to catch up to him—Dean yanked the door to his room open and marched out into the hallway, heading off in the direction of the main area of the Men of Letters’ Bunker. He’d cleared his room of any alcohol he’d had stashed away in there, just to try to keep himself under control a little better, but right now, making the trip to the kitchen was definitely worth it, if it meant he wouldn’t need to feel like this for much longer. Apparently, he’d worked himself into a
“Total? 13,467.” Wow, yeah, that was a lot of them, alright. Dean already felt the little hope that had begun to blossom in his chest deflate, shrinking back quite a few sizes. “But only 872 are in the US. The others are in other countries.”
"I mean, if you... if you want to, yeah," Dean somehow managed to croak out. "But only if you... Do you want to?"
All he wanted to do was protect them, keep them safe. And that was the one thing he seemed to be failing at.
“Then maybe I would think of it, yes, but what does admitting that accomplish?” Cas’ voice was sharper than Dean had expected, and the hunter paused, a little surprised, but he quickly told himself that he deserved the harshness right now. The angel seemed to sense the shift in the hunter’s posture, because he let out a breath as he shook his head, and when he spoke again his voice was much calmer, more controlled, and into it slipped a hint of tiredness Dean couldn’t quite ignore, “It does not matter how or when we came across this idea. If this does work, then all we should focus on is that my original Grace will be able to keep the Mark at bay more easily and the nephilim will be safe. That’s all that truly matters.”
The thing is—one of the things I love to do the most when I'm writing canon compliant (and if anyone here reads
Sam gave her an annoyed look. “Jo, I’m serious. I… I want to work this hunt. I’ve already checked—no hunters have stepped up yet, so there’s no one there for me to join. And I know it sounds like just a basic ghost hunt—a bunch of kids go missing in an old, abandoned house that’s supposedly haunted, and according to record, an entire family died in there twenty years ago, so the place probably
The angel reached for it quickly and without a word. He grabbed Dean's hand, squeezing a generous amount of lube onto the hunter's fingers, then led the human's hand back around his body and over to the angel's ass.
Dean had to get back to his feet at that, pacing around the room as he once more ran his hand over the stubble on his chin and cheek, his mind faintly providing the unhelpful thought that he should shave soon. He tried to think of something to say; of something to make this better, but his mind came up blank. He doubted there was
a little counterproductive to all the effort they’d all been putting into keeping him completely hidden, but Dean chose not to point that out right now. This definitely wasn’t the time for it, and, well, the chances of someone actually finding them here were pretty freaking low.
couldn’t breathe, like a hand had suddenly closed around his throat, cutting off his air supply almost completely, but when Dean raised his hands, clawing at his neck as he tried to pull whatever could be causing his sudden difficulty to breathe away from his throat, there was nothing there—absolutely
Was this too high for an angel? Dean hoped not, but it still made him worry. What if the fever didn’t go down? Dean was pretty sure medicine would have no effect on Cas, so what would?
And yet, the chord between Castiel and Dean Winchester, the bridge that connected their souls, still shone brightly, strong in a way that seemed almost impossible in their current situation, energy flowing back and forth between them without pause, essences so familiar with one another that they might as well belong to the same being.
Castiel simply nodded at that, but said nothing, still having a pretty intense stare-off with the small bottle.
Ignoring the twin glares being thrown his way, Crowley stood up from the bed, walking a little around the room until he was standing by the foot of the bed, staring down at the two of them with a calm, yet clearly measuring stare. Dean realized he was being careful then, measuring their reactions, like he wasn’t sure what exactly to expect or what exactly they would do.
Also, now that he knew these guys weren't even fully human, Sam had no guilt about wanting to kill the guy. He had tried to kill Charlie and was probably planning to do something even worse to Dean and the nephilim. He deserved this, and Sam would sleep a lot better once he knew that psycho was gone. And whatever they would be doing to him, it would be to keep Dean, Cas and the baby safe. The Stynes would come after them if they simply rescued Dean and left Jacob alive, both for the Book and for the nephilim, Sam had to assume, and they couldn't have that. They already had Heaven to worry about; they didn't need anything else.
Haley gave him another smile, and this one looked even more forced. She shook her head. “I haven’t had a decent night of sleep since Tommy went missing, so I’m not surprised.”
Also, even if Dean didn’t seem willing, had even snapped at Sam because of it, Sam couldn’t help but unconsciously keep an eye out for anything on breaking a soul bond, just in case it became necessary at some point.
was the only reason why she wanted to find her mother, Dean—and everyone else, really—could see right through it.
The pair exchanged another brief yet meaningful look, before Sam sat up straighter in his chair, pulling in what appeared to be a deep, steadying breath.
amulet, though, which had a face with its eyes closed, its mouth frowned and small, pointy horns on either side of its head, this one had its eyes wide and alert, its mouth partially open, making some of its teeth visible, its lips pursed in what looked like an angry snarl, and it had no horns, but the color and material seemed to be exactly the same—and the craftsmanship, too.
Before Castiel could respond, a fresh new wave of panic flooded the seraph's chest, the feeling so potent it was almost disorienting, though it very clearly did not belong to him. Once again, it was coming from the bond, and the angel froze at that realization, pausing to feel the connection more carefully, with attention, his own panic rising at the thought that something might have happened to Dean this time.
Cas smiled back in response, leaning down to kiss Dean on the lips once more. The kiss wasn’t urgent like it had been before. It was slow, sensual and careful, just a patient slide of mouths together, though its passion was still obvious, latent and potent as it burned beneath their skin with the pleasured thrumming of the bond echoing through their beings in unison.
“I’m gonna tell him when he meet again, anyway. Before I…” He gestured down to his stomach with his hand, where Cas’ hand still resided, “So really, Cas, it doesn’t matter that he knows there’s something we’re keeping from him. It really doesn’t. And even if that wasn’t the case, really, I’m not mad.”
And that wasn’t all. A little more research told them that Cain was literally killing entire families, one after the other—his bloodline, as he’d called them, according to Cas. After learning that, Cas had tried to call Gabriel in hope that maybe the archangel would be able to help stop Cain. Henry had mentioned that the archangels had the power to kill Knights of Hell, and while they had learned later on that Cain had been the one to kill the other Knights, archangels were still really freaking strong, so it was still worth a shot.
“Dean, you need to calm down.” Cas’ hand came up to rest on Dean’s shoulder once again (when had Cas moved it from there, anyway? Dean hadn't even noticed it was gone), and while the angel's touch was still very gentle and careful, it was firmer than it had been earlier, his hand feeling a bit heavier somehow, as though the angel was putting more strength into the effort now, making his grip tighter for some reason. However, it was only when the seraph gave Dean's shoulder a light, weak little push downwards that his intentions finally became clear—he wished to push the hunter back down toward the bed, probably in an effort to try and stop him from sitting up even straighter or move even more, or maybe even to get Dean to lie back down if the hunter actually let himself be moved.
“We can’t all go, though.” All eyes turned to him, waiting for an explanation. “To the house, I mean. She’s clearly not welcoming to visitors at all.”
But he was trying to be strong for Claire. He was also going through a lot, of course—he’d really loved Amelia, and Jimmy was his
“You know, I was really hoping you wouldn’t actually survive,” Tom commented, his words sharp, an angry fire burning in his brown eyes. Castiel had really pissed him off, it seemed. “I don’t know why my sister’s so fixated on you. She’s been rooting for you since the moment she found out that Jimmy guy had a damn identical twin. It’s really annoying, actually.”
Dean let his eyes dart back and forth between the pair, taking in the expectant look in their eyes, which made Dean wonder if he really was missing something here and they were just waiting for him to realize it, because it sure as hell looked like it. Why the hell were they—

“Fine,” Jo said, letting out a big, suffering breath. “I’ll do it. I’ll go with you to work the ghost hunt.”
Dean didn't miss the way Cas halted a little bit before answering this time, a spark of something new making itself known in the bond—uneasiness, it felt like, probably because of the question about the color of the angel's wings. Dean knew that was a pretty sore subject for Cas, and even though there was no way that Alex could have known that, Dean still felt annoyed that she'd asked about it.
her; he had only actually met her twice in his adulthood, in the couple of times he'd been sent back in time (Djinn world and Heaven memories aside), so really, he had no freaking idea how Mary would have possibly reacted to something like this.
“And what the hell do you think she’ll do when she finds out that you lied to her, huh?” Dean questioned. “How do you plan on getting out of
to do this, and that there was nothing that he could do to convince him otherwise, but what if Sam changed his mind about this? What if he started insisting again? What if he started asking too many questions, enough for
Because now that Jack had left, now that they no longer had an absurdly powerful being present to act as a buffer, the air inside that room had suddenly become stifling. In a matter of just a few seconds, the silence that currently ruled over the room had grown so freaking heavy and absolute that Dean felt like he might actually suffocate if he stayed in that room for even a minute longer. He could practically
He just knew he wanted to die, but that was all. And he couldn’t do it himself, or at least not easily, considering pulling his own heart out of his chest or cutting off his own head was probably not something he could actually do, so he had to find someone who wasn’t Castiel to do it.
about this anymore. He just felt far too tired for it, muscles still aching and feeling weirdly heavy, mind growing foggy and lethargic, more so with every minute that passed, so in the end, he decided to just drop the matter for now. They could come back to this later, when Dean didn't feel so utterly exhausted.
And once the two of them were free and able to fight, then maybe they’d stand a chance. Maybe all hope wasn’t lost just yet.
Dean’s eyebrow rose in surprise, although it did make sense. An angel’s Grace would always make sure the body they were possessing was alright, unlike demons, keeping the vessel still good for use until the angel was gone; they had learned that over the years. And if Cas didn’t eat healthy, his Grace would have to fix whatever damage was made to his vessel from greasy, unhealthy bacon cheeseburgers.
. His Dad was an experienced hunter—one of the best ones out there, really—and his brother… well, Dean hadn’t been too far behind, Sam was sure, with how many years of his life his brother had devoted to the life. Granted, the last time Sam had actually worked a hunt with Dean had been about twelve years ago, but he had no doubts that his brother must have become quite the hunter over the years.
With trembling fingers, Castiel did another search, then stared unblinking at the numbers that he’d gotten in his response.
His heart had jumped up to his freaking throat the second he’d laid his eyes on it, but then it'd plummeted down to the fucking ground the moment he read the words scribbled onto it—in a painfully familiar, blocky handwriting undoubtedly worthy of a three-year-old nephilim—or, well, nephilim-turned-God now.
April nodded again. Her grip around her pen tightened, though she didn’t write anything else down. “And now?”
Cas glanced back down at the two papers in his hands, hesitating for another beat. “The ingredients. They’re not…” He didn’t finish that—no, instead, the angel simply let his voice trail off, shaking his head weakly, minutely, like he couldn’t quite find the right words to voice whatever thoughts were currently bouncing around inside his head.
Oh, Cas, do you not know it's impolite to show up at people's house unannounced and just disappear when they try to talk to you? *disapproving shake of head* ;)
Before he could move, though, the sound of an engine in the distance made Dean tense up in his spot. He stared off into the distance in the direction of the sound, realizing that it was coming from the path he had taken to get here, but he couldn't see anything beyond the woods a few yards away in the same direction he had come from earlier. The rumble of the engine was loud, especially in such a quiet, abandoned place as this one, and it didn’t take long for Dean to realize just what car it belonged to. If that wasn’t enough for him to know who exactly was in the car, the way the soul bond began buzzing more strongly with every passing second should definitely be enough.
But there was one thought currently echoing inside his head that Dean couldn’t quite ignore, one worry that he couldn’t simply push away.
entire family was missing, if he had no way to know if the people he cared about the most in the whole freaking world were dead or hybrids at this point, Dean knew he wouldn’t feel up to being friendly in any way, that he’d probably just withdraw into his own head and not be exactly pleasant to be around.
the buckle of Cas’ belt was close to, but Dean had slept with suit pants and belts on before and waking up later hadn’t been pleasant, so he really should do this. He had to remind himself of that fact a few more times until he was finally able to move his hands.
He knew he and Cas were together, or at least something like that, but they hadn’t exactly talked about this, and Dean still had a few doubts. Okay, he had a lot of doubts, so many that he was pretty much going mad because of them. Sure, he and Cas were sharing a bed at the cabin (and even cuddling a bit in their sleep), but that was the only bed there was in that place anyway. What if Cas wanted separate beds? What if Cas wanted separate
So he’d locked it all away inside his own head, doing everything he could not to allow any of his worry to spill into the bond, carefully selecting every single thought and emotion he shared with Dean while doing everything he possibly could as he tried to find a way to track his Grace. It took a lot of self-control from his part to keep so much hidden from Dean, but so far Castiel believed he had been successful in conveying to the hunter an amount of confidence concerning their current situation he did not truly possess.
But, fuck, should he really do it, though? What if this guy figured out who he was? What the hell was he supposed to do? This whole thing could either turn out to be pretty freaking wonderful, or downright
He made another stop at a small convenience store on his way back to the motel, recalling that Dean had mentioned having stopped at it once. He left it carrying an apple pie and a small container of cream cheese in his hands.
“A little past ten,” Dean replied, picking up his clothes from the chair and carefully laying them down at the foot of the bed, “I’m going to go get us both something to eat. You have any requests?”
They were about an hour into the movie when Dean felt a weight on his shoulder. He looked down, seeing nothing more than a mass of dark hair at first, then tilting his head to get a better look at Cas’ face. The angel’s eyes were open, but only barely, his eyelids dropping, the buzzing, dazed numbness that always took over the bond whenever Cas was asleep slowly but surely starting to make itself known.
The cafeteria was still pretty big, though—a lot bigger than Castiel would have expected, with several rows of tables and chairs left to rot in the years that this place had been abandoned. A few of them were overturned, others simply misaligned—probably something that’d happened during the riot, or maybe that was simply yet another example of the several misdoings that this building had been subjected to over the years, courtesy of its countless trespassers.
But clearly, that wasn’t the response Sam had been hoping to get. He shook his head, the look in his eyes growing even sadder, almost begging. “Dean, you’re not thinking clearly,” he insisted, his voice urgent but low, breathy, like he barely had enough energy left in him to let out those words. “I just, I can’t… I can’t let you do this.”
Closing his eyes, he concentrated on the sound of Cas’ breathing, on the way the angel’s heart was beating against his own ribcage in a calm, almost soothing rhythm. He let it all engulf him, let it wash away the anger just for now. Nosing lightly at Cas’ hair, he breathed in the angel’s scent, realizing once more it reminded him of mint and honey for some reason. He liked it, and that was what mattered, because already he could feel some of the tension in his muscles melt away. He needed it.
Dean wouldn’t need to do any of that for a while, if he simply… didn’t go back to the Bunker right now.
Dean nodded numbly at that. That incident had freaked him out greatly, so much that he'd even lost sleep over it, but in that moment, staring up at the person who'd caused all that paranoia and stress, Dean actually felt a bit of gratidute, which was a really weird thing to feel toward the ghost haunting his apartment. But honestly, how could he feel anything else right then? If it hadn't been for this man, Dean wouldn't have even known Ben had been upset and crying in his room, so in a way, Dean actually owed the guy for trying to warn him about it.
old, and incredibly strong. We have a lead on how to remove it, but it’s just not as easy as reading a book and cooking up a spell. And we have someone else who's been helping us, too, someone who… really knows what he’s doing.” He chose not to mention the fact that this someone just happened to be a freaking archangel. “The whole thing is just taking a lot longer than we thought it would. I don’t… I don’t think there’s anything you could do to help, not with this.”
Dean had no idea what he could be thinking about, though, and once again he wondered if he would ever get to hear what the angel was thinking through the bond. He felt nothing coming from Cas right now, only the presence of the bond itself, the constant thrumming that seemed to flow through his entire being during every second of every day because of it.
Yeah, that made sense, Dean supposed. "How different is it, though? To form the nephilim's Grace than just a human soul? I mean, why does it take longer?"
What he assumed to be a pair of hands appeared in his vision, palms visible and turned toward him, as though whoever was there with him had just raised their hands in front of their body, like a silent, wordless peace offering.
Eventually, he managed to roll over onto his stomach and blink his eyes open, trying to get his vision to focus properly while he got both of his arms under himself so that he could raise the upper half of his body off the floor.
“Sam’s fine,” he replied. “Just doing his thing, you know—eating healthy, being annoying, killing some monsters. The usual.”
The drive up the mountain and to the cabin was tense, both of them silent in expectation of what they would be facing soon. They were packed and prepared with everything they would need, their wooden stakes sharpened and in perfect condition, but that wasn’t enough for Dean not to feel nervous about bringing Cas into the line of fire.
And it wasn’t like he could call the police about this. What the hell would he even tell them? That someone had gotten into his apartment last night, but the front door had still been locked when Dean had checked it afterwards and there were no windows broken, just as there were absolutely no signs of a break-in of any sort? That the guy had done nothing but talk to him for two seconds before apparently vanishing in the fucking air, without leaving a single trace behind? That the dude had been gone in the blink of an eye, as if he had never even been there at all? That he’d actually said he believed he was dead?
be right. It just didn’t make sense. He was broken; he was fucking poison, honestly. He was a failure, because he failed every single person he cared about, no exception. His freaking soul was tainted, and he certainly didn’t even deserve Cas’ friendship at this point, let alone anything more than that. And anyway, how could an angel love someone like that, after all the crap he had done?
Dean actually felt bad for completely neglecting her like this, he really did, but Cas needed his attention right now, so she'd have to understand it.
So it really wasn't a surprise that after the few hours Dean spent forcing himself to focus on research again, he'd made absolutely no progress at all. And even later on as he curled up around Cas to try and sleep for the night, his mind was still plagued by those thoughts.
“Huh,” Dean looked down at those words, unsure what to make of that. He wasn’t sure if Cas thought the change was good or bad, but he also couldn’t find it in himself to ask, so instead he decided to just change the subject to something that had been looming inside his head for a few hours now. “How can… I mean, how can the bond work, though? I mean, you don’t have
Maybe he and Castiel weren’t all that different, after all. Maybe Castiel did understand what Dean was feeling—or, well, at least some of it, anyway.
And it had. They’d found Cas' Grace at Dean’s grave site, hidden inside a small warded chest, which had been buried six feet under the surface right where Dean himself had been buried over seven years ago. He remembered unlocking the padlock that had been keeping the chest closed shut with the key they’d found at the library, then tossing both the padlock and the key away as he'd hastily opened the box, only to find both Cas’ Grace and a Tablet inside.
He must really be considered at least part angel, then, huh? Well, either that or the Enochian was working on him because of the nephilim in his womb, but he had a feeling that wasn't actually it. And if it was already like this, if already he couldn't even be considered fully human anymore when Cas' Grace was so weak and not even his own, just how much more would change once Cas had his actual Grace? Dean remembered the comment Cas had made about the wings, which still had him a little freaked out, but he was quick to push those thoughts away for the time being, because this really wasn't the time. Later, he decided.
“No,” Dean replied hoarsely, shaking his head and looking away again, hoping that would help clear his head a little bit, “But I’ll live.” The irony of those words only registered in his mind
He let his head fall to his hands as a shaky breath escaped his mouth, not even caring that he was probably getting blood all over his face.
Dean only realized he was crying against when the image faded and he realized Cas had pulled away from him, but he didn't even bother to try to stop the tears this time. he had no idea what he was feeling then, but this was overwhelming in... a good way. He felt this thrill he couldn't quite understand, this weird sense of pride, because that little, small, beautiful, bright spot of light was
Castiel wasn’t sure where exactly this was going—frankly, he was growing more confused by the second, with every single word that left the sheriff’s mouth—but he kept quiet, waiting for the woman to elaborate, keeping his expression as calm and neutral as he possibly could in that moment.
The hunter took it without much thought, but took a moment to examine the bag once he was holding it in his hand. “What does it do?”
“Mrs. Freeman told us you went to visit your family,” Cas offered, a frown forming on his brow as he considered the woman with even more attention than before, “We saw you return a few minutes ago with your nephew.”
out—John had been long dead when that happened, of course. Dean doubted he would have been able to get through it otherwise—and eventually, after several one night stands spent in bed with a partner who, instead of soft curves and gentle features, had sharp angles and hard, firm muscles, Dean had finally come to accept himself as bisexual. Today, he could think about it, could let his mind wander without shame and guilt. He could be himself, could do what he wanted, without all the internal struggles that had plagued him in the past. Being bi wasn't something he should be ashamed of, and it didn't make him any less of a man; he got that now. He was
He didn’t wait for a response, turning on his heels without a second thought, but before he was out of the library, he decided to throw a low, gruff, “Thanks for the coffee,” over his shoulder, just to try and lessen the tension that had filled the air around them—not that it worked all that well, but anyway. At least he tried.
Yeah, Dean could feel that. The spot right beneath Cas’ hand felt weird, even hotter than the rest of his body. It really felt like… like there was something there, buried in his skin, jammed right into his freaking spine, and even if it didn't actually hurt, he really wanted to just reach back there and pull it out.
everything just had to be a thousand times more complicated than Dean had imagined it would be. They were the Winchesters, after all. Gabriel was right—nothing ever,
Jo had been uncharacteristically quiet during her time in Portland, and Sam knew that wasn’t just because she felt uncomfortable around Jess, because they’d been introduced in such an awkward, tense situation, so technically, they were still virtually strangers. No, she’d looked pretty pensive whenever Sam got a glimpse of her—far too much so, like she was thinking exceptionally hard about something, and taking their argument into account, Sam had a pretty good guess about what that could be.
Okay, so, I know a lot of people have John portrayed as... well, a heartless monster in their stories, basically. And maybe that's what most people were expecting to see here. Now, there really are no excuses for what John put Sam and Dean through, for the way he raised them, but there is one thing I'm absolutely certain of, and that most people seem to forget: above all, John loves his boys, and he'll do anything he can to protect them. That's the John I chose to go with in this story. He's conflicted, of course, and he did try to kill Dean on the first chapter, but it wasn't as easy as it looked.
It was still a slow kiss, just a careful slide of mouths and eventual brush of tongues. Dean did not let it go further than that, still feeling like maybe they had rushed a little bit too much last time and no matter how good this might feel, they should probably slow down for now. Cas apparently agreed with him, because he didn’t try to push to anything, just followed Dean’s lead as they kissed, his hand coming up to cup Dean’s cheek and caress the skin with his thumb in such a tender, gentle way only Cas seemed able to manage, but never deepening the kiss, never allowing it to develop into something more.
He’d probably bring it up again later, though—most likely once the two of them were alone and didn’t have a freaking audience, but they’d cross that bridge when they came to it.
that told him Cas was in there listening. The silence was so intense around him he could hear a few birds chirping in the distance. He even saw a small fox run into the bushes by the side of the house, hurrying to hide from sight as soon as it seemed to realize he spotted it. But he heard absolutely nothing coming from inside the house, not even a single hint of what Cas wanted from him.
"My little brother called me Dee until he was like, seven, I think? I'm not sure if he had a problem with saying Dean, though, or if he just liked Dee. I, on the other hand, still call him Sammy up to this day, just because it annoys the hell outta him."
When Dean didn't respond, Cas seemed to take the hunter's silence as his cue to continue, "You didn't do anything wrong, Dean. I don't blame you for anything Michael did, and I know for a fact that no one else does. Michael is a heartless monster, and he
But he was pretty sure he could reach a few conclusions based on how responsive Cas had been when Dean had kissed him, one of which being that Cas was apparently
