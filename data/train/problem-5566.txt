‘Wanda, darling, I’m a little offended,’ Agatha taunts her with a smile. ‘I give you the nudge you need to discover your full potential and this is how you repay me?’
‘The guy can go toe to toe with every Avenger, save perhaps Vision. You honestly want him to
‘In his own words,’ Pepper responds, voice tired, ‘Tony is “used to the media’s bullshit. Besides they love to tear me apart, I’m just giving them something I can actually control for once.” I didn’t like it either, but he wouldn’t listen.’
‘How the hell did he even get up there?’ he mutters to himself. ‘Hey kid, come on down will ya? I haven’t got my wings with me and I don’t fancy shouting.’
‘Uh, no, not that I can think of,’ Quill says hurriedly, ‘that all sounds good to me.’
‘Yeah no thanks,’ Wade says, scrambling to his feet. He stops a little short of Peter.
It’s only when a pair of men approach the bar and start speaking to Weasel that the normally rowdy group starts quietening and watching the newcomers warily. ‘Give me the cue,’ Buck mumbles in his ear, ‘and head out the back. Go on we’ll make sure they don’t see you.’
Steve is quiet for a couple of moments then, in a quiet voice, he asks, ‘What was your nightmare about? Was it…did you see the shield again?’
‘What’s the point in being a hero if you can’t save people?’ Peter asks, looking down at his hands again. This time Tony lets him.
Bucky sighs. ‘I guess he reminds me too much of what I went through. It’s like looking in a mirror.’
‘Good, the guys a sentimental drunk and I can’t deal with a sentimental Nick Fury,’ the inventor groans.

‘So what’s on the agenda for tomorrow?’ Rhodes asks.
‘That is something we need to work on later,’ Nick interrupts again. ‘For now let’s take a vote on Tony’s role.’ When the vote is unanimous Tony opens his mouth to argue. ‘No one is expecting you to be an expert in everything,’ the one-eyed man tells him, ‘get someone to help you with the magic and dimensional side of things who’ll be sticking around.’
‘He even took away my entry override,’ Rhodes gripes, then he grins. ‘Though you should have seen his reaction when Vision phased through the wall to say good morning. It was priceless.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve looks like he’s going to say something else and then shakes his head, reaching up to turn his comms back on.
‘Why outside?’ he asks.
‘That’s a good idea,’ Pepper nods. ‘I’ll speak to our events staff and get it organised.’
Steve gives him a small smile and pulls him back down onto his chest, laying his head on his shoulder. ‘We do it like this, so you remember I’m not going anywhere and I can make sure you don’t go running scared.’
Thank you so much to everyone who has commented so far on this story. I'm glad you're enjoying it, despite it's slower start, and I hope you continue to.
‘I hadn’t seen her in so long,’ is the hoarse reply, ‘I didn’t think she would have wanted me there. Plus,’ Steve notices the quick glance in his direction, ‘there were other people that had more of a place there than me and I didn’t want to take away from their grief.’
workout?’
Natasha can’t help but marvel at the strength the teenager possesses, and for once she’s not thinking about his physical strength.
Tony can’t hold it back any longer. His hands grip the front of the man’s hoodie and his breath hitches as he tries to keep his emotions back. As Bucky’s arms tighten around him and he presses his lips briefly to the top of his head, Tony feels everything come out.
Valkyrie literally growls at him and he snaps his jaws shut with a click. Tony had bought a piece of land along the coast that he’s signed over to Thor for him and the rest of the Asgardians. They’ve named it New Asgard and his people are already beginning to build homes, Tony had sent a company to help them build a communal hall, where everyone is currently living whilst they work to build the rest of the town. The Asgardians had wanted to build their own homes, but had compromised on getting companies in to help with the electrics and plumbing, seeing as the materials they would have used on Asgard were not found or approved of on Earth.
He’s never been known for his sensible ideas so it’s no surprise they don’t decide to turn up now. Before he can consider any other course of action Tony begins walking forwards and saying a sequence of ten Russian words that he knows are forever etched in his memory.
‘Pepper?’ Tony says, tone still light as he stands up. ‘Would you be a darling and organise for the trash to be taken out please?’
‘Because,’ Peter hiccups, ‘because he’s obviously slept with plenty of other people before, so why won’t he sleep with
‘And mine is Dagr.’
Tony jolts awake, heart beating fast as he takes gasping breaths, hand reaching up to cradle the reactor in his chest.
‘What would have happened if you didn’t have the gene?’ May asks.
‘Oh my god both of you shut up and get a room!’ Wanda interrupts.
‘I’m hoping there will be many more,’ he reassures him. Then, throwing caution to the wind he reaches up to cup Tony’s cheek with one hand and presses a soft kiss to the inventor’s lips.
‘Yeah well the public are stupid,’ Tony grumbles.
‘Only because you’re an idiot!’ Peter huffs, then leans back and pulls Wade down for a kiss. ‘Trust me, Wade,’ he asks when they break apart, ‘please?’
‘Well, well, well,’ the familiar voice says, ‘I would say I’m surprised, but considering what I’ve been hearing I’m not really. What can I do for you, Stark?’
to be in the rafters,’ Clint teases, ‘but apparently that’s frowned upon so Sam, Scott and I will be standing at the back.’
He looks after me without making me feel like I’m useless- he’s got my back. And he’s one of the few people I don’t have to worry about getting wrapped up in something from Spider-Man’s life and being in danger. Like I said: he’s got my back and I’ve got his. He can be there for me as Spider-Man
‘We met when we were in play school,’ Harry explains, ‘Pete was always too nice to everyone and some of the kids tried to take advantage of that, so I tried to step in when they got too bad. At first just throwing my father’s name around would work, then when we got older I could start throwing fists as well as the name.’
‘Only one way to find out,’ he grins. Then, before he can register what he’s doing he’s pressed his lips against Wade’s again in a quick kiss. He turns and runs before Wade can say anything. ‘Come on, we’ve got some spies to beat!’
‘So I chose to do my presentation on a person who was, and still is, a huge influence on Captain America, and the rest of the Avengers. The person that Captain Rogers went behind enemy lines on a solo mission to find and rescue-’
‘Err… ok?’ Peter can’t escape because Tony has hold of his sleeve.
‘What about what I want?’
‘Nah, if it was Uncle Rhodey the Honeybear just had to glare at the monsters to make them run away. Just like he does with Dad,’ Peter counters.
‘Fair point. Ok we’ll organise for me to come visit one day at the weekend and you can take me then. No arguments.’
of the suit? Not to mention when you’re pissed off.
‘Sorry Baby Boy but this is a grown ups drink.’
seen or heard of their whereabouts is Spider-Man,’ he ticks off another. ‘The clues all point to Wade actually being Deadpool, who we’ve been introduced to as Peter’s boyfriend and there’s all the rumours that Spider-Man and Deadpool are dating which,’ he turns to Peter, ‘by the way there are so many questions I have about that.’ He turns back to Betty. ‘Not to mention that would explain why he spends so much time with the Avengers, and why they’ve been finding ways so far today to keep him away from the school where he can’t accidentally reveal who he is. And most importantly,’ he points to Ned and MJ, ‘neither of them are surprised.’
‘I’ll be happier once I know Stephen and the Time Stone are safe,’ the monk responds.
‘Thanks,’ he says, turning back to his list of homework. He’s done most of it during a free period, just like he always does before coming to the facility, but he’d been avoiding his algebra homework.
Thank you again for sticking with this.
‘Relax, Peter, I think it’s about time don’t you?’ Matt smiles at him.
wrong? We let everyone know and we get out.’
‘Peter language!’ May and Steve shout in unison.
‘Hey, what’s happening do you think?’ Steve gestures in front of them where there seems to be a few people having a bit of a heated disagreement. ‘Isn’t that where the carollers are supposed to be?’
He doesn’t give anyone hints this time, letting them see how much they remember; though if he were being honest he’s not sure he would be paying enough attention to keep up anyway. Loki’s heard the team joking about the time before Steve and Bucky went to war when the Winter Soldier was an infamous charmer and, caught in his dark blue gaze now Loki can believe it. Bucky doesn’t look away from him the whole time they perform the steps, eyes glittering with a smile and a myriad of things that Loki can’t focus on long enough to place. As they reach the end of the section, Bucky winks at him and then moves down the line; Tony takes his place and Loki scowls as he notices the inventor trying not to laugh.
Tony shakes his head. ‘You assured me during our last meeting that Captain Rogers had been cleared of all his crimes, along with the others on the team. There was nothing yesterday to suggest anything other than Ross acting alone. I assume I can continue to trust you to keep your word?’
He’s not sure who looks more surprised: Harry that Wade is his boyfriend, or Wade that Peter introduced him straight away as his boyfriend.
‘Well…each of those futures could end up being real, just in another part of the multi-verse.’ Peter shrugs. ‘Like I said we’d need to ask Doctor Strange.’
‘Don’t worry Bucky I’ll be glad to give you some tips,’ Rhodes laughs, catching the cushion Bucky throws at him and launching it back at the dark haired man.
know that of course. Well Ned does, obviously, but-’
I've not really got much to say this week, so I'll just finish by reminding you that we're only down to one chapter a week from now on. Sorry!
‘Oh come on you were worse than him,’ Tony defends him.
‘I’m sor-’
‘Emphasis on the finally,’ Natasha adds. ‘But you were saying about the attack?’
‘Stark, move out of the way,’ the Secretary orders. ‘We are here to arrest Steven Rogers on charges of treason. The rest of your little team is free to go.’
He groans. ‘I swear you get me to do this just because you know I hate it.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Instead of answering, Steve poses a question of his own. ‘Did he tell you about the nightmares? With the- with my shield?’
‘I have no quarrel with you, Man of Iron,’ his half-brother says as he steps into view, ‘but I will not hesitate to kill you to get what I want.’
‘It’s the one place I knew you wouldn’t look,’ Steve laughs, watching as Tony rips off the bright red wrapping paper and opening the long thin box inside.
‘Woah! Hey kid no worries it’s all in a day’s-’
The merc looks down at his feet, raising his hands in a placating gesture. ‘I didn’t know that. I panicked alright, and I did what I thought was best. I did what I had to save you.’
‘Pete you know you’ve got nothing to apologise for in that situation right?’ Bucky asks him.
‘I suggest we all get some rest,’ T’Challa says, ‘where would be the best place for the General and I to stay?’
‘And make fun when they fall over?’
For the first fifteen minutes or so everyone does really well at sticking to the ‘no powers’ rule. And then Steve kicks the ball to Peter with a little more force than he maybe should have done and the kid may have got a bit carried away and danced a little more intricately around Sam than was strictly necessary which resulted in a goal; Bucky may have been a little enthusiastic in his celebrations with the kid, and Wanda decided to take matters into her own hands. Or powers.
Loki gives him a grateful smile and nods. ‘I will, thank you Tony. What is it you are currently working on?’
‘Yeah. Those guys don’t have knitted sweaters.’
‘The one you pinned to the wall?’
Rhodes laughs. ‘They love you just as much as I do, Mama. You know you’ll have no choice but to come back next year.’
Valkyrie laughs, grabbing hold of the youngster’s shoulder and dragging him up to his feet. ‘Oh stop whining. You guys are just handling him the wrong way.’
Bucky struggles to recover in their captivity, and Wanda discovers more on HYDRA's magic user
‘You were right, Steve,’ Tony says quietly, looking at his partner and seeing the blue eyes cloud in confusion. ‘We never should have signed the Accords, we never should have let ourselves be controlled by the government. I should have seen this coming. I mean, damn it, I had the foresight to keep the Iron Man suit out of their hands-’
‘Maybe they are,’ Morgan says, voice quiet, ‘because you know evil monsters are real, Pete, so maybe fairytales are too.’
‘We’re soldiers, Tony,’ Bucky answers for them both, ‘we’re used to following orders and keeping our mouths shut.’
‘Can I see it again?’
‘We’re on our way back from the UN,’ he explains, ‘thought we’d all check in together.’
‘Will do,’ the AI replies.
‘Home now,’ Tony sighs, weariness evident in every line of his body. ‘Although I can’t imagine they’ve finished repairs yet so it might be a bit drafty for a while.’
‘Why do I feel like you’re helping him in this mission?’ Steve rolls his eyes and knocks on the office door.
She bites her lip before speaking again. ‘It just…it felt more like a home than the facility has and…well it’ll be a new start for all of us.’
‘And you’re sure there’s no lingering effects from drinking last night?’
‘Is that because you never let it end any other way?’ Vision suggests. When Loki doesn’t respond he doesn’t press for an answer. ‘I admit to enjoying our time today, Loki, I would be happy to do this again. It is a long time since I have been able to put my full abilities into play and I should like to do so again.’
young, Pool.’
‘Wait, seriously?’ he looks at her wide-eyed. ‘On second thoughts, yeah no let’s not try that.’
‘No thanks, kid, just come grab your plate and take a seat.’
‘Can I fly in it?’
‘Pete. Hey, Pete look at me,’ he runs shaky fingers of his left hand through the boy’s soft hair. ‘Peter,
‘Fine,’ she groans, but does as she’s told, remembering all the tips and instructions Natasha has given her all the months they’ve been doing this. ‘Hey!’ her eyes fly open and she smiles, ‘I’m doing it!’
Bucky gives his friend a grateful smile. ‘Still that kid from Brooklyn that won’t back down, eh?’
Please do let me know what you think, I want to know if I’m on the right track, or if there’s anything you’d particularly like to see over the course of the story. Thank you so much to everyone who has left kudos and favourited this story so far, I'm so grateful!
‘Alright everyone find your seats,’ Steve says, and Peter can see he’s trying to hold back his laughter as he surreptitiously looks between Clint and Natasha. Wanda looks over at him with a questioning eyebrow so he replays some of the conversation in his head for her; she bursts out laughing and then tries to cover it with a cough.
‘Kid you may not have realised it yet, but we
‘It felt like Stane all over again,’ Sam nods in understanding. ‘Tony, how did you even manage to contemplate bringing him back? And helping Bucky?’
Nakia nods, then darts back towards where they had last seen the others.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Yeah, yeah, uh,’ he pauses, then looks back at him, ‘hey Baby Boy? Can I ask you a question?’
‘It is not something you can just toss idly aside like an unwanted toy,’ Lautenus snaps. ‘You, who are Jotun and yet are unaware of any of our customs, cannot
‘Only if you’re happy to revel everything, Pete,’ Tony murmurs into his ear. ‘There’s no pressure.’
‘Make a move, dude!’ Sam says coming over to him again with Clint. ‘Or me and Clint are going to tell him.’
‘Noted,’ she responds with one eyebrow raised.
Rhodes laughs. ‘I can imagine trying to do that with a younger Tony, as entertaining as it would be it’d also be one hell of a headache.’
Unfortunately he doesn’t notice the person sneaking up behind him. ‘Work can wait, Tony’ Sam says from just behind him.
‘Quite a few, Peter, shall I bring them up for you?’
‘Drastic, but sort of puts my mind at ease,’ Tony admits, ‘I’m not sure if I should be worried about that or not. Sure it says something about my mental state.’
‘What the hell is going on?’ MJ shouts as they run through the corridors.
‘I’m not going to,’ he pacifies the man. ‘I swear I won’t. But if I don’t know

‘Aright, Pete you take your group up to their rooms, we’ll get everyone else settled in. Meet in Briefing Room Five in thirty minutes. Don’t be late!’
Tony presses a soft kiss to his lips to shut him up. ‘I know, Steve.’
Wanda considers this, Tony waiting patiently beside her. Eventually she nods. ‘I think I should be able to. Considering what we’ve been doing with the other aspects of my powers, I
Steve shakes his head then turns back to the gathered students. ‘This is just to give you a taster of the kind of physical training that the soldiers and agents we work with go through, and the kind of teamwork we expect from them and from anyone on the Avengers.’
As they turn to follow the vigilante Peter has the chance to look over his partner. ‘Wade-’
‘Shit did I do that?’ Peter’s eyes go wide. ‘Maybe I was more pissed off that I realised.’
Earth.’
Steve just snorts out a laugh then jumps to grab hold of the bars, swinging along below Peter until they reach the first platform. ‘You going first or shall I?’
‘Boss we need to go,’ the man holding his hair says, giving him another shake.
‘We were discussing plans for Christmas,’ Bucky explains, ‘I’m guessing you and Steve’ll be running off to some remote cabin you’ve got somewhere?’ he says with a shit eating grin.
Peter’s face lights up and he throws his arms around him. ‘Thank you!’ he says, then runs off, pulling out his phone.
‘How are you feeling?’
‘Oh wow you’re hooked,’ his friend laughs, closing his locker. ‘Are you going to introduce me at some point?’
‘Buckaroo I’ve never known Rhodey lose a shooting competition. There was even this one time he was so drunk he could barely stand up straight, yet he still managed to beat two stone-cold sober rookies.’
‘I might be more shocked if it actually did what you’re boasting it can.’
‘Oh no you don’t,’ he lands the suit in front of his friend, sending three of them flying out of the window that are bearing down on the king.
‘You fucking bastard,’ Steve growls, leaping to his feet and slamming his hands on the table. ‘I knew you were rotten, Rumlow, but this is beyond what even I thought you’d be capable of.’
to train Pete?’ he asks, mug forgotten halfway to his mouth. ‘Shouldn’t Stevie be doing that?’
‘But…but I nearly destroyed London, and gave a maniac control of your tech, and nearly killed a classmate!’
‘These new Accords,’ Wong starts, ‘would you want a sorcerer from Kamar-Taj to sign?’
‘No, Tony, I just want you to talk to me,’ the red head sighs, closing his office door and taking a seat on his desk, right next to his chair.
‘Yeah until we change partners and you come along,’ Steve grouches, but follows him to the lines with no other protests.
‘We need to work on your charming personality, Spidey.’
‘Well, at least I now know I have to make sure the trousers on both of their suits can withstand being tackled by the other so we don’t have any splits on the battlefield,’ Tony muses. ‘Oh and Sam you owe Nat twenty bucks.’
Peter can’t help the small smile at his friend’s awe. ‘Yeah course we do, now come on. Bucky stop looking like you want to kill someone and grab Peter’s bag before I tie you to the back of the car and drag you home.’
He picks up the recipe and looks down it, frowning as he realised there was something missing.
‘This,’ Peter pulls away and takes the power source out of his suit, ‘it’s got the same energy signatures as an-’
‘SHIELD air support, focus on those machines!’ Steve roars through the comms. ‘Tony and Rhodey think you can take them out?’
‘I am Laufey’s second son,’ the Jotun explains, ‘I am Lautenus and I rule Jotunheim after my father’s demise. However it has come to my attention that you, my older brother, did not die as we had been led to believe after your confrontation with Malekith. There have been some grumblings in my council that the older brother lives and I sit on the throne, therefore I am here to challenge you for our father’s throne.’
is saying he aches.’
Peter chuckles and pulls away. ‘No promises. Mr Stark will probably want to talk to him.’
‘Well this could have gone better,’ Peter mumbles to himself as he follows Tony to the elevator, his last sight of the common area is of Wade hurrying to hide behind Wanda, and the girl threatening Bucky with her glowing fingers as he starts stalking towards them. At least he knows Wanda will keep Wade safe, and Vision will side with her.
Tony does his best to grin at the last sentence. ‘Thank you for confirming my suspicions, Justin. As always, it’s a pleasure doing business with you.’
‘No, I just didn’t realise that everyone has a special coffee that FRIDAY prepares for us automatically. I just assumed it was all the same.’
be making sure you know how proud I am of you. But for now,’ he manages to finish getting Steve’s clothes off and gets him under the covers, thankful they had to stop off at the bathroom on the way to the bedroom or he wasn’t sure how he was going to manage, ‘I’m just going to make sure you’re as comfortable as you can be.’
Peter frowns. ‘No I didn’t. I didn’t even realise myself until recently!’
‘And how about we start the game?’ Tony cuts him off, sending him a glare.
‘Over my dead body,’ Steve responds, taking the safety off his gun. ‘Put the gun down, Rumlow.’
‘Not for much longer, Wade,’ Francis smirks.
Not able to bring himself to meet those blue eyes Tony turns to look out of the window. ‘Not much of any of that anymore.’
‘And whilst the Hong Kong Sanctum may not be as secure as Kamar-Taj,’ Strange adds, ‘at least it’s precise location is not known to anyone on the team.’
‘We don’t
‘Yeah well if you need anything else checking out then give me a call, now you’ve got my number. I’ll let you know if I pick anything else up; if HYDRA start taking up residence in New York it’s only a matter of time before they try taking over the city and that means Hell’s Kitchen is on that list too. Let me know if you need help.’
‘You know so many people are saying that recently I’m going to get a complex. If I start stressing over my good looks disappearing I’m sending you the shrink bill.’
‘Pete?’ he wakes up to Natasha’s worried face.
‘Yes FRIDAY?’ Bruce looks up from his experiment.
A snarl crosses Wanda’s face, and she raises her hands, scarlet light dancing across her fingers.
‘Yes, they really are.’
‘No, no I want to go in with everyone,’ he tells her.
‘I’ll be there in a few minutes, Baby Boy,’ he says, voice serious. ‘Just hang on and don’t do anything stupid.’
is free to go.’
Tony laughs. ‘Now I see why those two get on so well. Come on, Cap, let’s not leave the others at the mercy of an excitable Wade, Peter and Wanda combined.’
Loki looks away from where he’s sat at the window and looks out over the city. ‘Are you here to chastise me like I’m a child?’
Secondly, I hope you all enjoy this chapter. Please do let me know what you think I promise to respond to reviews much quicker this week.
‘Everyone else calls it the Civil War, why do you refer to it as Germany?’
‘Right sorry getting side tracked. I actually called to ask what you and Peter were doing for Christmas?’
on Peter’s conscience.’
‘We just want to help,’ Steve says, moving to stand next to him and putting a hand on his shoulder. It’s only when he turns to face him that he realises Steve has placed himself between him and the rest of the team to try and block out some of the intensity of the situation.
‘Please,’ he cuts Steve off. ‘Please don’t tell Mr Stark. It’s fine, honestly. I have May, I have Ned and MJ, and I have you guys. I don’t need anything else. I’m happy, and I’m happy at school despite a little bit of teasing from some of my classmates. Please promise me you won’t tell him. He’ll make a big thing of it and then it’ll just get worse.’
‘Not as much as I love that cute little butt of yours,’ Wade laughs and runs off before Peter can respond. He does send a set of tweezers flying after the cackling mercenary though.
‘Just tell me something only you would know,’ he repeats, keeping his eyes on Tony. He sees Tony glance over his shoulder at Wade. He doesn’t know what his boyfriend does, but when Tony looks back at him, he nods.
He’ll be the first to admit he almost enjoys training more now than he did before, mainly because there’s so many different things he’s doing now whereas he always had a fixed routine before. He still has a routine he does each morning and evening, but that’s more about keeping up his strength and stamina, rather than building on it too much.
Natasha’s eyes go wide. ‘Peter’s not in shot. Not fully.’ Tony presses play again, only pausing again once Bucky has gone to block Peter from view.
Loki turns to look at him, surprise in his face.
‘See here’s the thing that’s been bugging me,’ Tony says, taking a seat opposite his old rival as Natasha crosses her arms and leans against the wall. ‘You were always notoriously shit at anything, even when you tried to copy my stuff you still screwed up; you even managed to screw up teaming up with a villain. The
‘Thank you, brother,’ Thor smiles at him and gently unwraps the box. When he opens it, Loki sees his eyes fill with tears. ‘Loki, is this...?’
, where did you hide the champagne for drinking at midnight where you don’t think Clint is able to find?’
‘Nothing, I just thought you’d be more of a sun and beaches type holiday than a go trekking through a load of caves holiday.’
without this opponent knowing about it and checking to make sure it was nothing serious.’
‘Peter, no,’ Wanda speaks up. ‘You can’t.’
‘Are you trying to threaten me Stark? You’d have to have recorded it from the beginning to do any damage.’
‘Peter may I have a word?’
‘Well in his defence he didn’t know it was me.’
‘What’s with that look?’ he asks his boyfriend.
Wanda sighs and uses her powers to bring Mantis’ cookies over to join hers and puts them safely out of harms way in a cupboard. ‘Now that we know the cookies are safe? There’s a saying on Earth: if you can’t beat them, join them.’
‘I thought you liked having the opportunity to watch me use my muscles,’ he points out, grinning at the small blush that creeps up Tony’s neck.
‘Stun dart some of them, FRI.’
‘We promised Cap we’d stay at the facility and help with the repairs,’ she replies, ‘we’ll be waiting to throw you a party when you get back.’
He opens his mouth to shout, and inhales warm water. Closing his eyes, he thrashes around, trying to throw off the ghostly hands that are pushing him down. Phantom sparks of electricity dart across his chest, reminding him to protect the battery. If the battery stops he’s dead from shrapnel. His hands reaches to his chest, but the reactor’s gone.
‘No,’ Peter shakes his head. ‘No. I’m not letting you out. Never again.’
‘No thank you, I shall do some research and see if I can book a table somewhere,’ Vision smiles at his gratefully. ‘You’re right it is time we spent some together on our own. Especially now we have time to relax with Thanos gone.’
‘She’s one special lady,’ Steve comments as he joins Tony at the kitchenette.
Steve’s about to say something else when Bucky’s voice drifts over from the group. ‘What do you mean you don’t play football? Surely you’d leave them all in the dust?’
‘Well it’s certainly been an eventful Christmas so far,’ he laughs, one arm going around Tony’s waist.
‘Don’t say stuff like that,’ Tony groans.
‘You ready, Cap?’ Bucky’s voice shatters the picture in front of him.
‘And then,’ Tony says, ‘then there was the warrior known as the Honeybear, a brave and noble warrior who stood in the middle of the walkway and wouldn’t let anyone past. It is said that he once fought off an entire army of monsters, and didn’t even break a sweat.’
Peter looks at her nervously for a moment, then nods. ‘There’s a screen along the back, if we can get through the door it’ll provide cover before we hit the aisle. At least two of the terrorists will be guarding it as it’s the main way in and out of the auditorium apart from the stage doors.’
‘Hill is finishing clean up on the last of Beck’s hideouts. For now, that threat is largely contained.’
far,’ he can feel himself turning red under Harry’s praise. ‘I don’t think many people believe how close I am to the team yet.’
‘Is everything alright, Vis?’ she asks, looking at him in concern.
They remain silent as Thor lists names, including those of his parents and his friends the Warriors Three and Sif, then Fury steps up to name SHIELD personnel, T’Challa steps up for Wakanda, and Strange for Kamar-Taj. Throughout it all Clint and Bucky stand silently side by side. By the time its all finished and they’re raising a toast to those named he’s getting fidgety.
‘Wade’s not because it’ll be cheating: his healing ability processes the alcohol too quickly,’ Peter says before his boyfriend can get a word in. ‘I’ll-’
, no need for the death stare. Well then where is he FRIDAY?’
Tony smiles and nods. ‘Yeah, well. He’s not. But he’s as close as you’ll get to being good enough. And more importantly, honey: he’s the one
‘Pete!’ Harry comes up to him and takes him by the shoulders. ‘Pete calm down. If my dad
‘The Avengers,’ she replies, and Peter feels the room ripple with tension. He doesn’t dare look over at Ned.
For once he’s not looking forwards to going to the facility this weekend. He briefly wonders if he can get away with saying he’s sick, but then that would just make Mr Stark send for him to go to medical and then his life would be even worse.
‘Well yeah, but you weren’t wrong,’ Wade wraps another arm around him and pulls him closer, reaching up with a finger to tilt his chin up. ‘You see someone like me and your first reaction is to see if you can help them, Pete, if that doesn’t make you someone special I don’t know what does.’ He leans down and captures Peter’s lips with him own. This kiss is far less unsure than any of the others they’ve shared, and Peter feels his body melt against the mercenary’s. He’s pretty sure if Wade wasn’t holding onto him, he would have fallen in a puddle at the man’s feet. And that is definitely something he didn’t need Bucky to see.
He smiles sadly at him. ‘You look tired, Tony.’
‘You’ll never know.’
‘Thank you,’ she can’t stop the relief from coming through in her voice. ‘Thank you, I feel…I feel like I’ll go mad if this carries on.’
Rumlow gives him the self-satisfied smirk that always makes Steve want to punch something. Preferably Rumlow’s face. ‘You aren’t going, Rogers.’
‘Thor sit down,’ Steve sighs, ‘and Buck, back off.’ Then the soldier turns to look at his brother. ‘What do you mean, Thor?’
‘We had little choice,’ Thor says, crossing his arms, ‘Asgard was destroyed and as we were making our way here to seek sanctuary we were attacked by Thanos. He is now on his way here.’
‘Tony, what-’
recover.’
‘Fine,’ Valkyrie huffs, ‘anyone who wants to take part in the drinking contest has to be sitting around that table,’ she points to one in the corner, ‘ten minutes after midnight or you don’t get counted.’
‘Bucky where are you?’ he shouts into the comms. ‘You alright?’
‘Really?’ he’s pretty sure his eyeballs nearly fall out of his head. Happy
she snarls, ripping her hand from my grasp. Then she smiles at me and I start to think maybe I should have let her down gently. ‘You say you’d rather have one lifetime with him? Then that is what you shall get.
He takes in a deep breath and nods. ‘Yeah, let’s do this.’
‘Absolutely deny any and all accusations of that nature,’ Wade says.
‘Peter-’
‘It hurt you just as much,’ it wasn’t a question, she’d guessed the scientist’s disappearance had hurt the inventor just as much as it had hurt her. Tony Stark didn’t let many people in and Bruce was one of the few people he’d let get really close.
‘Yes.’
‘Well the one you sent to Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes wasn’t fully functional.’
‘The Jotuns are the sworn enemies of our people,’ another of the crowd responds. ‘No wonder he betrayed you, my king. We should not allow the traitor to live! A Frost Giant at the heart of Odin’s household? It’s an abomination! They must have switched him with your brother when he was a baby.’
‘Are you trying to get him to rely on the suit as much as you rely on yours?’ Steve demands.
‘It is under control,’ Tony turns to make himself a cup of coffee, trying desperately not to look at anyone and resisting the urge to run out of the room and into a suit. ‘Well mostly under control. I can go for a swim as long as I have time to psych myself up for it. I only freaked out yesterday because I wasn’t ready. Besides it’s only gotten worse again recently because I’ve been getting slightly less sleep than before.’ He manages to catch himself before saying ‘because the nightmares have come back’. Nightmares that now feature a phantom shield in his chest as the arc reactor flickers out.
‘I can never make it right, Tony,’ Steve takes a few steps towards him, ‘I know I can’t. I’m not asking to. I’m not asking for you to take me back, not when you’re building a new life with Pepper, not when you’ve got everything you deserve within your grasp. I just…when you came off that ship and I saw you alive I just wanted to hold you again, and…’
It took far too long for the bell to ring in Peter’s opinion, but finally it was the end of the day. He shoves all of his books into his bag, for once not actually being careful, and rushes to the door, Ned hot on his heels.
‘So, kid, how’s the crazy fan been?’ Bucky asks, voice innocent but the grin on his face is anything but.
Barnes, I was simply checking my belongings.-
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Now these are some of the main labs,’ Sam explains, placing his hand on the scanner and stepping through once the doors slide open, ‘mostly these are kept for the team’s use and for a few select others. I’ll be honest: mainly because Tony and Bruce make things explode more than is safe for other people to be around.’
‘A sensible suggestion,’ he nods with a smile. ‘They told me the menu would be here in the room with some other documents.’
He wonders as he packs up his bag, ignoring the triumphant smirk on Flash’s face, and the worried frown on Ned’s, and walks towards the classroom door.
Sam snorts. ‘Yeah like that’s ever going to happen.’
‘I feel like I should have some comment ready about your new hammer, but I’m a little busy right now.’
‘No, they’ll break me first,’ he squeezes her hand in reassurance, ‘because by breaking me they’ll be part of the way to breaking you.’ He gives her a grim smile. ‘I’ve seen them do it too many times not to know, Wanda.’
‘Does it count if she brought me back?’ Peter says, walking out towards the group. ‘Or am I not as important as the others? Because if so, I’ve got to say that kinda hurts, guys.’
‘I got your back, Reindeer Games,’ he reassures him as Loki hears the face plate lock into place.
I hope you're all staying safe during these crazy times.
‘Bucky…’
‘No, kid. Trust me that is one fight you do not want to get in the middle of,’ Sam answers.
‘Well that just ruined my mood. You make it sound like you’re a zombie or something, and I’m into a lot of things but necrophilia is not one of them I’m afraid.’
‘If you can tolerate Wade I don’t see how I can be worse,’ Peter frowns.
Steve does his best to look interested in what the girl is saying, but his eyes keep being drawn to Peter and Tony, and Bucky’s fidgeting at his side; Tony, he notices, is listening with rapt interest and applauds enthusiastically when the girl is finished. There’s some opportunity for questions at the end, and Steve has to bite back the smile at his partner obviously trying to hold back the urge to either ask a question or make a comment. There’s a boy that gives a presentation afterwards, and Steve has no idea what it was about if he’s honest.
‘You. Well finding you,’ he replies. ‘I think Monty gave up before Dad did. Or else he gave up actively looking anyway.’
‘Who wants to do the honours?’ Tony growls as the rest of the team joins them.
‘Are you sure that’s a good idea?’
‘Oh,’ and Peter doesn’t need to add any more. Doesn’t need to ask any more. Deadpool’s got a contract, which means he’s going to kill someone.
‘Locked in the workshop where everyone had temporarily lost access to,’ Tony laughs, ‘FRIDAY’ll let you in.’
Wade’s head goes into his hands. ‘It’s Francis,’ he says quietly.
thinking.’
‘You’re not getting me in the mud, Rogers,’ he crosses his arms over his chest and grins, doing his best Tony impression, ‘
‘Because no one else is going to have the same pull as Captain America,’ he replies. ‘Now come on over here. FRIDAY’s going to make sure the blackout is on the windows and no one can come in without us knowing first so your little dancing secret is safe.’ Tony walks over to an area he’s cleared earlier and Steve follows a little hesitantly. ‘So you’ve never done any dancing before at all?’
‘Nah I reckon it’s Rocket with his traps, Clint with his arrows and Tony with his tech,’ Quill replies.
‘Righto, doc, one Hawkeye bet coming right up.’
‘What’s going on- oh that explains it,’ Peter and Wade come up from behind to find out why they stopped. ‘Did Bucky wind up Sam again?’
‘Err…Dr Banner can you help get me out?’ a small voice says from the middle of the room. Scratch that, hanging dead centre in the middle of the room nearly five feet above the ground.
Bucky tries to stagger to his feet, and as he sucks in a pained gasp he breathes in some of the mist. Immediately he feels his senses clouding, his body becomes heavy and Wanda’s body is almost impossible to hold onto.
‘I’ve done a drinking contest with Thor before, I’m going to help carry your bodies to your beds,’ he retorts.
‘Pete,’ Wade quietens his latest protest with a kiss, ‘everything else in my life I have screwed up in the extreme. I want you to be the only thing I haven’t.’
He decides a punching bag will help get all these thoughts in order as he steps into the elevator.
‘Apologies,’ the humanoid says. ‘I thought it safer seeing as last time I was in here there were objects being thrown. Wanda and Peter now apparently have a sibling rivalry in games to go with their sibling-like relationship.’
‘Not sure. Don’t think she’s found I’m missing yet though.’
‘You’re a good kid, Peter,’ is all the reply he gets as Matt opens the door to his office. ‘I’ll let you know when I’ve got some information for you.’
‘Very funny, Tony,’ he can hear the eye roll in Bucky’s voice. ‘We’re not
‘No kidding.’
‘You don’t let Sergeant Barnes near my school for a month or so, I think he was going to kill high schoolers.’
‘Yes, Captain,’ he says a little louder, then he turns to Natasha. ‘Just make sure he remembers to put the safety back on his guns, he’s always forgetting and accidentally shooting something. Normally his own foot.’
‘Easy for…you to say…kid,’ Bruce growls, voice changing between Hulk and his own.
‘Yeah but it doesn’t count since we were fighting bad guys,’ the teenager protests.
‘But instead he has sent you to retrieve me.’
‘Hey,’ Sam puts his hand on Quill’s shoulder, ‘you can’t control whether the others in your team enjoy it or not. The thing you should focus on is enjoying it yourself and creating some new memories, alright? We’ve all had a really difficult year, take some time to think about
‘I just saved our asses and all I get is grief,’ Tony throws his hands into the air.
‘Oh god Mama, really?’ Rhodes groans.
think I’m not proud of you,’ then Tony does something he’ll deny to anyone who asks. He pulls Peter into a hug, only relaxing when he feels the kid’s arms wrap around his back.
He asks his brain.
‘Half seven?!? I don’t see this time in the morning unless I’m still awake from the night before.’
‘Umm…’ Peter squirms under her gaze, ‘yes?’
‘That would be a matter for the local police force surely?’ Vision asks as he appears through the wall.
‘I can’t remember ever having been ice skating before,’ Quill confesses to Sam and Steve, where the three of them are lacing their own boots. ‘I’m hoping its not too different to my rocket boots.’
‘We are not having you
‘Ah Miss Romanov I was hoping to speak to you,’ Justin Hammer’s smirking face has Natasha’s blood boiling, then she notices the other people on the video call and it runs cold.
‘He is right though, Nat,’ Bucky says, turning serious again. ‘You look done in. Get some sleep, you’ve done everything you can now.’
‘You think Weapon X is still going?’ Steve asks. ‘You think HYDRA was behind it all in the first place?’
‘We haven’t lost yet, Rocket,’ Quill growls at him. ‘Now let me down before I find a way to turn you into a cushion!’
There’s a chorus of angry shouts aimed at her, as she turns to look at Steve. ‘You sure you want to hang around and wait for the next big blow up?’ she asks him. The room goes silent and everyone is looking between him, Sharon and Tony. Steve is completely thrown by the question, by the challenge in her eyes.
‘He’s not showing up on any scanners in the facility or grounds.’
‘Trust me, Tony,’ he faces his friend.
‘I just… I can’t… I’m supposed to be a hero and save people, that’s what everyone expects of Spiderman. But I didn’t do
Fury smiles. ‘Only testing you, Romanov, no need to get defensive. I’m glad to see that’s your default when it comes to the team now though.’
‘You know you could have left it on auto-pilot right?’
Love to you all!
‘Try closing your eyes,’ Bucky suggests. ‘If you aren’t already.’
Wanda shakes her head. ‘I won’t. I’m just as worried as you are but…’
‘Do I have to get FRIDAY to initiate the self-care sequence?’ Sam raises an eyebrow. ‘Will it explode if its left?’
‘I’ll go grab the others and get them to come up,’ Peter offers.
‘Got fire ants incoming, Cap,’ Scott tells him, ‘but we’re going to need a few minutes.’
Peter resists the urge to groan, shaking his head. ‘Ned shut up and listen.’
‘Let’s move before anyone comes round,’ Sam nods.
‘Sounds like Steve might actually be losing his temper,’ Bucky chuckles, bringing in another box filled with fruit to be prepared.
‘Tony,’ Rhodes’ warning voice comes over the link.
Steve gate-crashes the SI party, but before he can get inside he meets a dark-haired man who says he can help Bucky.
‘The hell I am,’ he snaps. ‘And you don’t outrank me, so I’ll call you whatever the hell I like right now.’
‘Really? Because you really don’t look like you are. You haven’t been over-working yourself have you? Because the doctors said you haven’t recovered enough yet and you don’t want to-’
the way it came and into Steve’s outstretched hand.
‘What hasn’t been easy?’ the man is much more focused now, looking at him with intense dark eyes. ‘What happened with the prosthesis?’
‘Hey punk,’ he says with a smile, ‘so you finally found me.’
‘Who was
‘They won’t be close to the flag,’ Steve muses, ‘or else his own team would risk getting caught in them. I bet he’s just done it within the trees.’
‘Tony?’ he can’t help but close his eyes and breathe a small sigh of relief when he hears that voice. He hasn’t heard it in a year.
‘Alright everyone,’ Steve says again, ‘Wanda’s team will have the flag inside the facility; Strange’s team has the flag at the obstacle course. The first team to collect their opponent’s flag and return it to their base is the winner. If you are pinned for five seconds you have to return to the common area, where Laura and the kids are watching, and stay there for two minutes until you can rejoin your team by heading back to your base. FRIDAY will keep track and will notify everyone if you are cheating. The game begins five minutes after everyone arrives at their base. Any questions?’
‘Oh my dear, Widow, if you think Cap was innocent before he met me-’
‘Stop it,’ Sam adds, standing up with his own at Paul.
‘Whatever,’ he turns away from Deadpool again.
‘Then I suggest,’ Fury’s voice comes over the comms, ‘that you tell us what the hell we have to do to make sure that one comes true.’
‘They would probably have grounded me if they even knew I’d
‘She’s cruel,’ Rhodes laughs.
fucking morals. I mean usually they’re shit ones I’ll give you that, but I’m not moving on this. Peter you asked me if this was a date and I would absolutely
‘So he’s not a psycho killer?’
Loki nods and smiles. ‘One moment first?’
They all spend the rest of the night laughing and talking. Gradually people start to filter out as they become tired, and a couple get caught under the mistletoe on their way out. Tony managing to catch Steve by pulling the super soldier back on their way out and laughing at the blond’s surprised expression. Soon it’s just Peter, Wade and Natasha left.
‘I must admit I am pleased you decided to do this, Tony,’ T’Challa says as they watch Thor place it at the base of the bonfire they’d built and raise Mjolnir to the sky, calling on his lightning to light the Yule log, ‘it is good to celebrate new traditions and festivals with friends.’
Tony feels like he went to sleep on Boxing Day and woke up on New Year’s Eve. That’s the only explanation he can find as to how the time has gone by so quickly.
‘What do you want, Wade?’ Steve sighs, closing the book he’d been reading to look up at the mercenary.
‘Yeah ha ha, very funny,’ Bucky rolls his eyes. ‘So you guys ready to come home? Complete the team?’
about what my creations were actually doing to other people. And if I did I justified it to myself by saying I was doing it to keep the people of America safe.
‘We’re just leaving,’ Rumlow says, as if he’d never spoken. ‘So sorry you won’t be joining us at the ball, Cinderella.’
‘You’re looking pretty spry for a dead guy, Hammer,’ his voice is even, but his heart is racing. ‘To what do I owe this unfortunate turn of events? I don’t owe you any money do I? Please don’t tell me you want a job. I’m afraid there’s no vacancies at Stark Industries right now.’
‘Not enough, honey bun,’ Tony laughs, ‘now I’m pretty sure we need to stop fraternising and focus on the game.’ Sam laughs and runs off and he realises this is the first time Sam’s had his wings back since coming home. And really, Tony muses, there probably wasn’t a better way for him to have returned them to him.
what he was expecting. Whatever it was, it certainly wasn’t the pure happiness that is currently taking residence there. Before he can open his mouth and ruin the moment, Steve darts forwards and kisses him hard; when the soldier pulls away they’re both breathing heavily.
‘I am right here and can hear everything you know,’ Steve says, raising an eyebrow.
‘Spoilsport,’ he teases as they get the last bag and follow the others through the park again.
‘He’s all but made you untouchable,’ Natasha says quietly as they watch Tony walk off the stage, the hundreds of reporters in the press conference still shouting questions after him. ‘Secretary Ross can’t touch you without getting some form of backlash from the public.’
‘As soon as you’re ready,’ is the answer. ‘Is there anything you’d like to discuss about today Mr Stark?’
‘We’re sorry, sir,’ Peter manages to mumble before Ned can say anything.
‘I think I might.’
Dinner ends up being a very lively affair. For one thing Rhodes won’t believe Tony made dinner without needing at least five fire trucks turning up and makes a point of going to check the kitchen to make sure it’s not a blackened ruin.
to follow clear instructions, I’m sure it will come back soon.’ He gives his brother a shove down to the other end of the line and tries to ignore the satisfied smirk on Thor’s face. ‘And if I find out you’ve been purposefully pathetic at teaching this I’ll turn you into a toad.’
‘Did a lot to help with the equality movements apparently. They went to Martin Luther King’s march at the Lincoln Memorial and were high profile guests there.’
Francis’ laughter rings out as Bucky finishes preparing the rifle and peeks over the top of the crates. ‘Just like you did with Vanessa, Wade? Or you doing better this time?’
‘So they should be back by the end of the week,’ Peter nods, then he sighs. ‘I don’t like everyone being in different places when we’re waiting for an enemy to turn up at our door. Seems like every episode of Scooby Doo where the gang splits up.’
‘You not got a curfew?’
Natasha just rolls her eyes and throws the remote to Wanda who decides to put on some comedy show to drown out the two super soldiers. Sam comes and joins them on the sofa, apparently not wanting to try and break the two friends up. Not that Tony can blame him. Unconsciously he rubs at his chest where the arc reactor used to be, the shadow of a shield sitting heavy.
?!?’ Peter’s eyes are the widest Loki has ever seen them. He’ll admit to being just as surprised as the teenager, though more at the fact that Tony has told him now as opposed to the actual revelation.
‘Brother,’ he pauses, then continues, expression unsure, ‘you have not returned to this form because you think that is what I want have you?’
They sit down on some of the chairs to make it easier for Tony to unwrap his gift, and he pulls out a small box; when he finally reaches the contents he laughs and looks over at Natasha. ‘This can only be from her.’
he thinks to himself.
‘Of course,’ Loki rolls his eyes, ‘remind me when my powers return to turn you into a frog again.’
‘Oh come on! High school homework is not going to tax Tony’s brain; it barely taxes

I don’t think we’re in Wakanda anymore Toto.
‘You haven’t asked me about when we fought the other day,’ the trickster interrupts. ‘And you have been shutting me out ever since.’
‘Who you calling ugly?’ Bucky demands as he and Rhodes’ face fill the screen separating them from Happy.
how Steve wants to spend it. He looks up at the three soldiers with a smile. ‘Rhodey you invite Mama Rhodes up here and tell her no arguments because we’re going to need someone to supervise the kitchen.’
‘What did the information say?’ Steve asks him.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Try it again and I’ll put you through the window,’ Peter’s arm are crossed over his chest. ‘Now is anyone else going to try and kill someone or can we get back to working out how to save the universe?’
Now that they are face to face, he thinks he may be able to break through. If he can, he’ll be able to return Bucky’s mind to him.
He can’t deny the warmth that blooms in his chest at those words. If he’s honest he’d been looking forward to this challenge for a number of reasons, this being one of them. Despite what many would have said about him before, he would never have tried to undermine any of the team’s romantic relationships once he arrived on Earth with the other Asgardians. Despite having found Tony attractive when they first faced each other in New York. And he’ll admit to having felt a twinge of disappointment to discover the dark haired inventor and blond haired Captain had finally acted on what he’d noticed back then.
‘Not when you feel you have a duty to perform you aren’t,’ Wong argues, ‘you put your duty before your health. So we are stepping in.’
‘Ah, daughter,’ Thanos says wearily, ‘I wondered how long it would take you to find me.’
‘Necessary? No. Normal? Absolutely,’ he answers. ‘Oh hey this is the stuff for the inside tree! I think the rooms and hallways are basically done. Want to get started? I think we need to set some of it aside for the dining room tree, though we normally have too many decorations for the tree anyway so there should be plenty.’
‘Well I made it out to be an accident, which it kind of was, cause see it was Flash knocked the other chemical over and it spilt into the drawer I was using and then everything went boom. So I said I’d been keeping it down there so I didn’t accidentally combine the two things we weren’t supposed to mix.’
‘I did, but you ignored me.’
Peter does as the man says. ‘Peter shall I activate the stun ability of the drone?’ Karen asks. There’s no way for him to say yes without alerting the man, so he tries an affirmative noise.
‘Make it quick kid we’re taking quite a bit of fire,’ Tony says.
‘Wanda that’s not fair!’ Steve says from behind him, but his complaints are lost to the shouts of celebration and congratulations from Sam and the two women as he crosses the finish line.
‘So basically you were Peter’s knight in shining armour and he was an ungrateful little toe rag?’ MJ asks, grinning at Peter.
‘Sorry for fucking up and nearly killing me you mean?’ Bucky demands, narrowing his eyes at the man.
One question from a reporter catches his attention again. ‘What of Wanda Maximoff? Her powers have caused deaths, are you positive we won’t have a repeat of Lagos?’
‘No problem, Reindeer Games,’ Tony sends him a wink and then leaves the room. For once Loki doesn’t feel quite so lonely.
looking at a shell with my name on it, waiting for me to kill them. Honestly? Don’t know how she can stand to be in the same building as me, let alone look at me. I think, I hope, she decided that, although I am to blame for making and selling the weapons, I’m not to blame for the people firing them.’
‘Weasel I don’t give a fuck what’s happening at the pool table, all I want is to get enough charge to make a call and then go home and collapse until next year.’
‘Oh right we didn’t tell you did we? So when Wanda came back we decided every Friday night is team dinner and film night. We take it in turns to cook something and everyone sits and eats together. Plus if the kid’s visiting it forces him to spend time with everyone rather than trying to convince me to let him tinker with one of my old suits. I think I’m just going to do spaghetti. That alright with you?’
‘Why don’t we take a break?’ Steve suggests. ‘We’ve been walking for a couple of hours, it might be a good idea to check in with the other two.’
Tony’s not a huge fan of the training room. Oh sure he understands the importance of keeping up with training, he
‘Think we should check?’
‘It’s not the same with him, he’s my boyfriend,’ she answers, pulling herself from her thoughts. ‘This… it feels like I’ve got a brother again.’
could have told them myself,’ the mystic user grumbles.
‘Steve don’t leave me! Your boyfriend is evil!’ Bucky shouts after his retreating friend.
‘Mind if I take a seat?’ a voice says from behind Peter. The teenager turns around to see a familiar face.
‘Yeah think I will,’ Tony can picture the teenager nodding. ‘Cause they really do. I don’t think I like vodka. They didn’t have any whiskey though I can’t tell if the stuff you drink is just as bad. But it probably wouldn’t have been as expensive as your stuff anyway.’
‘Well I’ve managed to avoid Sergeant Barnes so it’s been pretty good. You look really nice by the way.’
‘But there’s more that you suspect at least,’ Natasha cuts in, shooting Bucky a warning look as he feels frustration building in his chest. Yeah it’s probably better she has this conversation, he’s going to get way too tempted to punch Wade in the face.
‘Like Daredevil for example,’ Peter nods, slowing in his chewing now that his stomach isn’t protesting quite so much. ‘Or even the rest of the Defenders.’
‘Sam beat them in a race today,’ Natasha explains, ‘with some help from the two best female Avengers of course.’
‘But you got through?’ Steve asks, coming over.
Wade breathes and then, before Peter can properly register what is happening the man kisses him. Strong arms tighten and would have crushed him against the hard chest if not for his powers, and honestly he’s glad the man is holding him up because he’s not entirely sure his knees would be able to support him. One of Wade’s hands travel up his side to his face, cupping the back of his head and deepening the kiss, making Peter gasp, and the mercenary takes the opportunity to tentatively explore with his tongue.
‘I did?’
‘Yeah well I didn’t,’ he huffs, ‘and in our defence you did come in at the end of the conversation and the start of the more fun things.’
‘Oh hey, Karen. Yep which is exactly why everything is done. You ready for patrol?’
‘Wait you’d had sex with someone before?’ Tony leans up on one elbow. ‘I mean I did wonder considering how good you were last night, no virgin is
‘Technically it’s only a day,’ Tony laughs, ‘but everyone usually celebrates for the whole month.’
‘Huh, neat trick,’ Peter says, then they all go quiet as Strange comes back to solid ground.
‘Yes, I wanted to say thank you,’ the little girl says, ‘you saved me and my Mommy.’
Tony sighs and turns to face her. ‘Because it wouldn’t have been fair on Bucky. Steve would always have come first, even if I tried not to, and I know Bucky would have accepted that and he shouldn’t
‘Killed everyone to do with the programme? Come on Spider-Man you know what I am, why can’t you say it?’
‘No more questions!’ Tony interrupts before anyone else can say anything. ‘We’ve got other things that we need to talk about.’
‘Of Captain Rogers?’
Steve looks between Rumlow and Tony, watching both of their reactions carefully.
Oh hang on, I think I lost a foot at one point and it’s growing back.
Peter starts shaking his head and then pauses, and the look he gives Wade has him slightly concerned. ‘How about a deal?’
‘It helps my friend MJ feel better,’ he replies with a one shoulder shrug. ‘Do you want it?’ He offers the plate and spoon.
The team sits in stunned silence as they watch the TV screen, Pepper still hovering near the door her expression telling them all she very clearly is not happy with what’s just taken place. Steve isn’t entirely sure he is either.
‘Home I assume?’
‘I already checked, Tony. The stone is safe,’ Natasha reassures him. ‘And I passed the information on to Wade so he’s better prepared.’
‘You laying low at your place until then?’
‘This is Wanda, she’s like my big sister, so she’s your Aunty Wanda and she has magic powers like Doctor Strange does, but she didn’t have to do lots of studying to get hers. She can be really annoying though, and she likes to hold my upside down if I’m getting the better of her in training; but she’s one of the most amazing people I know and the best thing, which we’ll do with you when you’re older and you come to visit, is when we have a duvet day and we curl up and watch films with tubs of ice cream. Sometimes we watch rom-coms, and other times we watch horror, which isn’t so much fun, and then other times she’ll let me put Star Wars on and we’ll have a Star Wars marathon.’
‘Just waiting for you old man,’ Natasha replies.
Valkyrie salutes her then starts jogging over towards the commotion. ‘Hey Big Guy!’ she calls out, taking a running leap up and off one of the broken logs and onto Hulk’s back, hugging him round the neck, letting herself hang limply down his back.
Steve turns Tony’s face to him again. ‘This is one that I am not going to break, not while there’s still breath in my body.’
Together he and Natasha push against the shield, freeing themselves from their shelter and scramble out. Natasha definitely more graceful than him.
‘Shit who turned on the fucking lights?’ I groan as someone moves something above me, letting light hit me straight in the eyes.
‘Tony the age gap is too big, sure you’re not going to just let them carry on?’
‘What the hell?’ MJ demands. ‘You’re not seriously telling me you’re a superhero are you?’
‘Trust me, Wade, you’ll want to have a look at this one.
‘Oh thank the Norns you are back!’ Loki says as he walks into the room. ‘If that boyfriend of yours doesn’t stop moping around the place I’m going to freeze him into a solid block of ice that won’t melt for a year!’
to be food on the ceiling,’ Sam counters.
‘I asked if you were free tomorrow,’ MJ repeats, ignoring Flash’s comment. ‘For the team building we’ve just been talking about.’
about the Weapon-X programme,’ Peter assures him, deciding it’d be better for him not to get in the man’s space, ‘except its name and that they think that’s where you got your regenerative powers.’
‘What is it you had planned, Mr Stark?’ the UK representative asks.
‘Way more fun to find out at the end,’ she winks. ‘Ready? Fire!’
Peter looks at him with wide eyes. ‘How did you-’
manage to corrupt Captain America.’
Tony’s eyes narrow. ‘I didn’t tell him. How did
He rolls his eyes beneath his mask. ‘I’m sure it’s not that bad. Why don’t you try for parts in horror films?’ He laughs and drops down to hang on the wall just out of Deadpool’s reach.
‘There’s only one memory left to see before we’ve seen all my kills,’ Bucky mutters as he takes his seat in the chair. ‘Do you think it’s going to be enough to get rid of the mind control?’ he asks Vision as the humanoid comes to stand on his left.
, Wade. There’d be less of us sat here if it wasn’t for you. Do you accept the position on the team?’
‘What about Morita?’ Bucky hastily interrupts before Steve can start on another rant.
‘Peter!’ Sam shouts after him but he’s already running, chasing after Wanda before he loses sight of her.
‘Yes it does. What you really wanted to ask me is why I trust him enough to agree to the mission going ahead when he’s obviously hiding something.’
‘Missed you too, Steve,’ he mutters as he pulls the phone from his ear. Looking over at the bar as he flips the phone closed and puts it back in his pocket, deciding he’s earned a whiskey. A large one.
More of the team arrive at the facility, and the teams are picked for Capture the Flag
‘Same reasons, Pete. You understand the scientific jargon and can double check anything Pep isn’t sure about. Besides this way no one outside of the team needs to know we’re gone anywhere for anything other than a brief break. It can look like I’m still able to sign off for things even if we have to go off grid for a day or two.’
‘Peter don’t!’ Steve calls, trying to climb to his feet.
‘Gabe married her didn’t he?’ Steve asks, as they continue with their hand.
A/N: Hey everyone, here's your promised second update of the week. I've now seen End Game...and I'm still emotional. To everyone who has yet to see it: it is incredible and well worth the wait and I hope you enjoy it. To everyone who has seen it: my heart goes out to you.
‘Oh come on! He’s taken out supervillains I’m sure he can handle
‘Hey! Cut it out Bucky! And how come Wanda got off the cleaning duties?’
He enters a room filled with glass cabinets and lots more shelves, most of which are filled with different weapons and artefacts.
‘Appreciate that,’ she laughs.
‘What if we can’t stop him?’ Wanda’s voice is quiet, but his hearing can still pick it up. ‘He’ll come for your stone, Vis; can you even survive without it?’
and only him, not playing second fiddle to someone else. I guess, looking back, Steve’s
‘He should be where you left Thanos,’ Strange says, ‘we shall join the others, you and the Captain should go and find him.’
‘Fuck you,’ Peter growls, more angry than he’s been in a long time.
‘Avengers? Thank god you’re here. We’ve got most of the other cell blocks shut down and contained except for cell block 8 where the explosion happened. They managed to get into the dining area and the kitchens but no further,’ the Warden’s voice comes through the comms link.
Sighing Wanda nods and climbs to her feet, knowing Natasha isn’t going to take no for an answer, and lets the older woman talk her through a fairly basic routine.
By the time they all settle down for a late lunch the main entrance, most used hallways, common area and dining room are all decorated; Vision had interceded when decorations started making their way to the kitchen and pointed out the fire hazard, and then Steve had put his foot down Captain-style and Wanda has begrudgingly agreed.
Around them the building thunders and cracks. It feels like it lasts for eternity and for a split second all at once, and Steve has a horrible flash back to being in the bunker with what was left of Zola.
‘What like putting Nat and Clint against each other? I’m not sure anyone would survive that!’
The king rolls his eyes at the title. ‘I have asked Nakia to be my Queen.’
‘Strangely enough turning half of the last team into war criminals doesn’t really help with a recruitment drive.’ Tony presses on before anyone can interrupt him again. ‘The fact is the majority of people with enhanced abilities on this planet who are willing to do something to help others are either already at our base, or they’ve been sent into exile. If we’re lucky things will continue as they have for the past six months where none of us bothers the others. If we’re not someone finds some leverage on one or more of them and I don’t particularly fancy going toe-to-toe with any of them again. If we bring them back we’re all in the same place, and the likelihood of someone finding a way to pit us against each other is smaller.’
‘Spidey-’ whatever he was going to say is cut off as Peter manages to get his mask over his mouth before throwing up further down the corridor, gripping a doorframe to keep his balance. He hears the merc curse behind him.
bad, Mama,’ Rhodes protests.
‘Trust me Clint,’ Natasha laughs from the floor where she’s playing with Nathaniel and Lila, ‘he’d wipe the floor with you.’
‘Oh, thank God,’ Bruce sags back into the seat.
‘I’ll get everyone together,’ Sam says.
‘What for?’ Tony asks, slightly embarrassed at how breathless that kiss made him.
‘Hey, do you want to hear this story or not?’ Tony raises an eyebrow, the children quickly apologise and quieten again. ‘Now, as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted,’ more giggling from the two children, ‘if the monsters somehow managed to get past the Honeybear they were then faced with the biggest challenge yet: the White Wolf and his fearsome partner Lady Spider. These two fighters were the fiercest yet, and nothing could compare to the love they had for the prince and the princess, the White Wolf alone would tear apart any monster that even
‘What the fuck are you doing kid?’ the one with glasses asks when he catches sight of him. ‘Are you even old enough to be in here?’
‘Just seeing if I could keep you on your toes,’ Steve shrugs. ‘It definitely had the effect of making me enjoy this more.’
‘Pool! I need your help,’ he says.
‘-hey don’t go all doubting on me now, Steve,’ he cuts him off. ‘Like you just said: we’re going to beat this son-of-a-bitch.’
He’s pretty sure that’s a hopeful expression seeping through the mask. ‘You forgive me?’
‘How did she-’ Rocket is cut off by Sam swooping back behind him and knocking the contraption out of his hands.
A/N: Hi everyone. As I said before I'm doing double updates each week; this is instead of posting the other story mid-week as I originally intended. Basically work hours are going up and down all the time and I'm not sure when I'm going to be writing, so although I want to give you guys more story each week I want to be careful I don't lose all my backlog too quickly.
‘My, my, miracles do happen,’ Tony smirks. ‘Come on kids, let’s get moving.’ He moves towards the wooden hut where someone is already coming out and walking towards them.
‘Sure go ahead,’ he says from underneath the car he’s working on. He rolls out as the door opens and he hears Steve enter. ‘What can I do for you, Cap?’
there’s the smell of stale booze, body odour and what Peter suspects might be urine. And that’s only the scents he can work out. Despite that none of the surfaces
‘Too good,’ he hears Peter grumble, but the teenager still makes his way to sit next to Wade on one of the sofas.
‘How am I going to get this up to you?’ Bruce muses, realising the kid is out of arm’s reach. Then he spots a chair and goes to grab it. ‘If I get one of your arms free think that’ll be enough?’
‘Bullshit.’
‘Yes boss?’
‘Tony,’ and boy did it still feel strange hearing his old AI’s voice call him that, ‘you did not ask me to take those papers to Wanda to just stare at the phone Captain Rogers gave you. You’ve never stopped during a plan before, even when it’s been an extremely ill-advised one; why are you starting now?’
Nebula nods, looking down at the ground. ‘We were both adopted by Thanos, raised together to be his warriors. We…did not have an…easy relationship, but by the end we were sisters.’
‘Well, Captain,’ T’Challa responds. ‘You will leave for America in two days; Tony will be waiting at the airport to greet you and take you back to the facility.’
‘It’s the only place I could think of that no one knows about, Rhodey,’ he sighs.
‘I think we should give Fury a call and see what the plan is for tomorrow,’ Rhodes suggests. ‘If you guys are heading off we need to know when.’
Steve’s expression is not what he was expecting. Not that he really
quickly when you turn away for two seconds. Even
‘Boss?’
Pepper laughs as the puppy yaps and licks his face again. ‘I think he likes his name. I wonder who got him for you?’
It takes longer than it should for them to get everything under control, and at one point Tony had even considered calling in Sam and Wanda, but eventually, at around three in the morning, the situation is back under control and Steve, Bucky and Natasha are helping get the last of the inmates into the spare cells while he, Rhodes and Vision look over the site of the bomb and help clear away some of the larger pieces of debris.
‘Err, no thanks FRIDAY, I think I get the picture.’
Morgan had come from a home filled with domestic violence, thankfully never fully aimed at her, but she’d been caught in the crossfire too many times and when her mother and father had been arrested for a variety of offenses, she’d been placed in care. Peter had already known more than his fair share of pain and loss in his young life, barely seven he’d already lost both of his parents and had been taken in by his aunt and uncle; unfortunately his uncle was raging alcoholic who got violent when he drank. The result: Peter’s aunt had been killed after years of abuse and Peter himself had been regularly beaten, with most of the family’s money going on booze for his uncle there hadn’t been much for food or medicine and Peter’s lungs had always been bad. His asthma was now very severe and, despite now living with them for almost a year, he was still skinny and underweight. Stephen Strange had decided to do some studying into paediatric medicine and development (something he’d mastered before they even had the children once they said they were thinking of adopting) and was now the children’s personal doctor. He argued he was pre-empting them turning into mini-Tony’s, but Tony knew better: Stephen wouldn’t have trusted any other doctor to take proper care of them.
‘And you don’t fancy going and resolving some domestic dispute? It’s better than watching daytime TV!’
Peter looks up and raises an eyebrow. ‘Why?’
‘We can always go tomorrow morning,’ he smiles at her, ‘I think we are both a little too tired to be walking around a gallery.’ He offers her his hand and pulls her to her feet. ‘You did well, Wanda.’
‘Call us if you need anything. And don’t lose hope,’ he replies, returning the salute and standing back as Tony boards the jet.
‘Hey! Who you calling old?’
‘It’s not about EDITH, Pete.’
‘Dude,
‘You know what? I don’t want to know. We’re leaving.’
‘We are rapidly running out of choices,’ Vision points out.
‘Mr Stark-’ The gun being pushed harder into the side of his head stops whatever he’s going to say.
‘Pool? You let anyone hurt Ned I’m stringing you up on the Empire State Building.’
They finally manage to retrieve all of the boxes, and Natasha and Sam manage to coax an embarrassed Peter out of the attic, and sort through the decorations, Wanda and Natasha making a list of things they’ll need for Peter and Loki to go and buy.
It had reached the news yesterday that Tony had been taken by person or persons unknown and the Avengers were searching for him. Natasha had sent him a message last night to say there were going after him; from what he’d heard from Matt and Wade, both of whom had gotten home with minimal injuries, the team had managed to get Tony out. The problem is he hasn’t heard anything about how the man is doing. It’s now mid-afternoon and he honestly didn’t give a damn about Spanish. He just wants to know how Tony is.
, T’Challa,’ she says, taking his hands in her strong grip. ‘Stark gave me an upgrade to my cell before he left,’ she says with a mischievous smile, ‘I’m sure the elders would not approve, but you must take the number for it so you can call on us if you ever need our aid again.’
Yo peeps! You’re friendly neighbourhood Deadpool here just, yet again, doing a job for the author because that’s just the lovely kind of merc that I am.
The two of them stay like that for a while, dozing in the warmth of the morning. Steve has found the ice invading his dreams less and less since he’s started sharing Tony’s bed. Eventually Tony sighs. ‘We should probably get up and face the day. What time is it?’
Peter notices Wanda setting aside the angel for the top of the tree. ‘Why are you putting that to one side?’
‘Aww, don’t be like that Sam, I’ll let you have some of my scotch later that I only save for special occasions.’
times. Trust me when you’ve seen the Winter Soldier before coffee in the morning nothing scares you anymore.’
‘Yeah well like I said I’d have to be blind or an idiot to not want to take you on a date. Especially since I’ve seen that ass in spandex.’
. I managed to make it out of the car and one of the shells landed right in front of me. Want to take a guess at what it said on the side?’
A/N: Hey everyone! So the whole team is back now and is going to be introduced to Peter in the next chapter. Hope you're enjoying the story; we're now moving properly into the second stage of the story. I've planned about three stages, and just under 40 chapters for this fic. I've already written 20 chapters, so in case I have a busy week there'll always be an update ready.
‘I don’t know if I should be offended or not,’ Thor admits to Natasha as they bid Valkyrie farewell and head back to the Quinjet.
you knew, did it?’
‘Shame Captain Marvel isn’t here,’ Quill laughs.
‘It already did,’ Tony replies. ‘How else do you think we’re in this mess?’
‘Mr Stark how would you describe your relationship with Captain Rogers?’
‘No, it doesn’t.’
‘FRIDAY says there were a number of people,’ Natasha appears from behind him and Tony tries not to jump, ‘what do you think that means?’
‘If we get a few of them down I’ll be able to borrow some of their guns and be a little more useful,’ Clint tells him, before ducking down between the tables and making his way around.
‘Just go!’ the archer yells and heads back towards the café.
‘I’m not entirely sure he’s
Natasha laughs and pulls him into a hug. ‘Will do, Baby Spider, I promise.’
Just then there’s what sounds suspiciously like an explosion and the sound of lots of people shouting and hurrying past his cell.
‘Well then track his phone. Maybe he went for a walk,’ Sam can hear a note of worry creeping into Tony’s voice.
‘I just didn’t want to hear something on a patrol and phone Tony and not know I had to let you know first,’ he mumbles into the material. ‘If something had happened to you because I hadn’t warned you-’
‘I’m so installing the Macarena into your armour,’ he grumbles as he stands up. ‘Sorry kids, Daddy’s sending me to bed.’
‘Yeah,’ Steve nods and swallows. ‘Yeah let’s…let’s go in.’
‘Who watches the twenty four hour news channel out of choice?’ he asks, flopping onto the sofa next to Natasha.
‘Tony?’ Steve offers.
‘Show me the video call from Hammer the day after Scott arrived. I want to see what both sides were able to see.’
Tony stops fiddling as he ponders the question. It’s something Pepper had asked him before. Well screamed at him during their last big fight before they agreed to stop trying to make something work that was obviously never going to happen. He puts the pieces down and subconsciously rubs at his chest where the reactor once sat.
‘Here,’ she says, putting the stone to his gauntlet and Tony tries not to cry out at the pain. ‘Tony…please don’t-’
As always here’s a sneak peak at the next chapter:
Loki squeezes his hand. ‘I know, I just felt like one of us should say it so we didn’t have any maybes hanging over us.’ Bucky squeezes his hand in thanks. ‘You were the one who taught me how to let people in again you know. Even though it was all accidental with creating our mental link.’
Peter tells stories that he and Bucky have told the team from Steve’s pre-serum days when they were growing up together; stories about shared Christmases between the two families, Bucky pushing Steve to try new things and not become a recluse despite his health issues, and of course of having to rescue Steve from getting beaten up because he couldn’t keep his mouth shut.
‘I suppose Tony has you believing that Ultron is all his fault right?’ he asks once he returns with the chair.
Natasha pulls the flash drive out and slides it into her suit. ‘Clint? What’s happening?’
Natasha gives a small laugh. ‘Somehow I’m not even surprised.’ She turns to Strange. ‘How did it all go?’
‘In what world do you think you can start lecturing me on keeping things from you considering the discussion we’ve just been having?’ he snarls.
‘And you’d be happy not knowing everything?’ Clint’s voice betrays his doubt.
‘Right, no problem,’ he takes the star from her and powers up his boots, heading for the top of the tree where he carefully places the star at the top. She sees him and Tony exchange a few words and Quill laughs before heading down to take some of the icicles from the inventor.
The Spider-Man mask is on again and he leaps towards me.
talk to me about not working as a team.’
‘Guys!’ Rhodes protests.
‘He told me he’d ask me to marry him if he needed a queen, but he’d prefer to marry someone he loves. Charming right?’
Fifteen minutes later Peter is knocking on Wanda’s door, his carefully crafted masterpiece on a plate he is holding with one hand.
algebra. It’s one of the few science and maths things he struggles with.
Steve sighs, but his smile gives away his actual lack of suffering. ‘Never mind, I’ll take that as a yes.’ He comes over and pulls him into a loose hold, letting their foreheads rest together.
Okoye shouts a warning as a black van arrives on the scene, and it’s only Bucky’s reactions that save Steve and Wanda from being flattened.
‘And how long will that take?’ he asks, Tony can tell Bucky is getting more worried as the days go by. It’s been two days since his meeting with Natasha and they’ve all been working non-stop; Bucky and Tony have only had about five hours sleep each as they’ve stayed up talking while Wanda and Vision slept, going over the words one by one and trying to work out the reasons Hydra had chosen them. Vision had commented that his tired brain was easier to manipulate so they’d tried to keep on the edge of being productive. It was a good thing Tony had plenty of practise with little sleep, he didn’t want the soldier to be left awake by himself.
‘You guys alright?’ Sam asks them.
In the end, despite some interesting moments, like when Rocket tried to ‘dance’ from the lights and Wade insisted Peter had to do his dance to ‘Umbrella’ despite the teenager’s absolute confusion to why, the winner of the contest was Wanda. Everyone was surprised, except for Peter, who just shrugged when questioned and responded with ‘well she always beats me in our lessons’.
T’Challa laughs again. ‘She has not yet responded. It is traditional that she wait a week before giving her response; I will be able to tell you the answer when we come to visit at New Year.’
I’m coming, so it’s not like I’m breaking and entering, right? Oh god I’ve been spending too much time around Wade, I’m talking to myself.’
‘What are you playing at Hammer?’ she demands. ‘And what the hell have you done to Tony?’ Her friend is kneeling between two guards, each of whom have a gun aiming at his head, and he’s holding his chest, his face twisted in a grimace of pain.
Tony can see the moment Loki catches sight of the alien they’d just defeated, because he desperately tries to keep any emotion from showing on his face. Then the trickster turns, snarling, to the barely breathing alien at their feet. ‘Where is the fourth?’
‘I used to love Christmas,’ Bruce admits, ‘but the Other Guy used to get a bit jumpy around the holidays so I started avoiding it.’
you are talking about, Cap.’
‘Natasha!’ Nakia appears next to her. ‘Are you hurt?’
‘Alright,’ he grits out, and Bucky wishes he could give him a hug.
‘Alright I won’t push,’ Sam assures him, ‘but what is it you want me to say?’
‘Strange? Strange!’
‘If I was mortal that is certainly a possibility. As I am not, I believe I shall be safe. Now,’ Loki replaces the spoon in the bowl and takes out the menu, ‘does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should try next?’
‘Will you at least listen to my proposition?’ she asks.
‘Ned if you’d been in one of her training sessions so would you. Have you met everyone?’
‘Plus we’ll still be eating all the Yule food for a month!’ Thor adds.
‘Why not?’ Rhodes asks.
‘Me?’ Peter all but screams. ‘You-but you’ve just been taken by HYDRA! Why are you – what are you – why are worried about me? You could have died!’ And before either of them can stop him Peter has thrown the top half of his body across the hospital bed and buried his face in Tony’s stomach, hands gently, but firmly, gripping onto the hospital gown and bed sheets as he sobs. ‘I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean any of what I said, I don’t know why I was so angry and upset. And then you went and gave yourself up for me and- and I- I’m so sorry.’
‘Steve?!?’
‘Flattery won’t work on me son,’ she says, ‘now come here where I can see you properly.’ She puts a hand either side of his face and pulls him down to her eye level. ‘Hmm,’ she says, taking in every aspect of his face.
‘Absolutely not, I don’t have a death wish,’ the other boy laughs, ‘stop being so dramatic.’
have any of you do it because you’re all needed for the Accords, and I want this taken care of before it gets out to the media,’ Fury cuts off Natasha. ‘Now I decide to try out your newest team member and see if he can help me.’
man,’ Rhodes laughs. ‘British, all prim and proper, and then I see him once put a guy through the pavement for insulting Tony when we were like, ten.’
‘Alright! Race time!’ Sam calls out eventually.
So that’s why Captain America is currently standing next to wall, holding a glass of champagne and really wishing he could get drunk whilst trying desperately to hold off a panic attack. Because in about ten minutes he was going to have to dance. In front of people.
‘Alright! Nat and I are wiping the floor with you all!’ the archer crows, flashing him a smile.
Tony’s best man. You be Steve’s,’ Rhodes’ voice joins in. They’d left the two of them back at the facility, partly to appease Ross and partly so they can keep an eye on the hacked security cameras from the airport. Something for which he is extremely grateful for right now.
‘I’ll show you to your rooms,’ Natasha says. ‘Pete you alright to show Wade to his?’
‘-he’s incredibly arrogant-‘
needed help from you?’ Strange asks, an eyebrow raised in challenge. ‘As unlikely as that would be, at the moment everything seems very much geared towards the Avengers.’
‘Not really.’
Finding a spot to change, he does so in record time before he’s more flying than swinging through the air to the place Tony had texted.
‘London?’ Tony frowns, then feels the breath catch in his chest when FRIDAY brings up the footage. ‘You all seeing this?’
‘Yeah but you don’t have a sniper scope to do the work for you this time,’ Natasha teases, going to stand in front of her target. ‘Now are you two ready or am I going to have done all five of my rounds before you even find your way to the target?’
Peter takes it hesitantly. ‘Yeah you too, Captain, Sir.’ He still looks like he wants to high tail it out of this situation.
‘Takes more than a couple of HYDRA idiots to take us out,’ she says into his hair and he chuckles.
May smiles at her nephew. ‘Yeah, they said either today or after the holiday. Looks like it’s going to be a few more days of waiting.’
‘Whatever you say, Pete. Whatever you say.’
‘But the most important person was Bucky,’ Steve continues. ‘Without him I’d have been beaten to a pulp long before I even met Erskine. Plus if he hadn’t of been taken by Hydra I’m not sure I would have gone to save all of those soldiers.’
‘Hey,’ Steve gathers their adopted daughter into his arms, pulling her onto his lap, ‘those monsters are never going to come and get you again, you hear me? You don’t have to worry about them.’
‘Only at Christmas,’ Sam laughs, slinging an arm around her shoulders and pulling her into a one armed hug. ‘It’s the only time of the year she and Pete are in charge. The rest of the time they…
‘You don’t want to go web them up?’ Deadpool asks, sounding disappointed.
‘I remember the month yours is in,’ he tries again. ‘And Pepper’s.’
that’s
The human sighs and throws his hands up in the air. ‘Fine. Let’s get to the ship and you can fill us in on the way.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Hope you enjoy the start of this Christmas special. Each year I do a special I want to gift it to two readers who are some of the most loyal commenters an author could ask for, but this year I had to do three. Thank you so much for always giving me a smile each week with your wonderful comments, you have no idea how much I appreciate them!
Tony laughs. ‘That is most definitely a conversation for another time, babe, right now we’re getting side tracked. I don’t think Peter’s in any danger from the relationship side of things with Wade,’ he cocks his head as he thinks, ‘I mean Peter was telling us, well more like moaning, about the rules Wade had put in when they agreed to date. He even went so far as to say they weren’t allowed to kiss before Peter was eighteen.’
Love always,
‘Oh wow,’ Sam laughs, ‘someone call the three Christmas ghosts we have a resident Scrooge!’
‘It was brought up when Natasha found out you were in New York, not everyone was familiar with you so she gave them a brief run down: career in the military, then working as a mercenary up to the Weapon-X programme, and back to being a merc after you… well after you…’
‘Your arms,’ Loki pulls away from the man as soon as he is standing.
‘You know,’ he says as they take the box over to where the tree has been set up, ‘I don’t really know where that tradition came from. We can look it up later though if you like? For now why don’t you help me put these lights around the tree? We need to start at the bottom, where we’ll plug them into the socket, and then make our way up the tree, going round,’ he explains as he plugs them in. ‘Then we put all the other decorations on and then one person gets nominated to put the topper on, then we sit down with hot cocoa and have dinner and start on the Christmas movies.’
Natasha looks up as Sam huffs his way back into the common area, a large box in his arms.
‘Just pull,’ Rhodes grits out from between clenched teeth, as Clint hauls him towards him. It’s not easy, being stuck in a confined space and Rhodes isn’t the lightest of men with the amount of muscle he’s built up over the years, but they manage to get him nearly face to face with Clint.
‘Go on, Stevie, I’ll help her,’ Bucky’s metal fist makes short work of her door, ripping it off the hinges to help her get to Sam. ‘What about the driver? I’ll get Sam.’
‘Why me?’ Bucky asks him.
‘You mean that you want to see what upgrades would be useful for our gear?’ Steve asks.
‘Wanda, get Vision out,’ he tells her, gesturing to where the humanoid is laying on the floor, clutching his side.
‘Well its working isn’t it?’
‘I’ll come give you a hand.’ As his friend disappears through the door, doing a quick sweep behind them, Steve follows on behind, constantly checking over his shoulder for any sign of pursuit.
He can’t help it. The memory that comes to mind first is one of the many times he was recalibrated. His present screams mix in with his past self, echoing around the workshop.
‘Yibambe!’
‘Betty you’ll be next to MJ,’ Peter points to her door, ‘and Harry you’ll be opposite her next to my room, here.’
He’s cut off by the tall Jotun’s bark of laughter. ‘I do not mean that pathetic excuse for a king that you have adopted as a brother,’ Steve notices Loki bristle at the insult to Thor, ‘I am talking about you and me, Laufeyson-’
‘Fine,’ the merc growls, ‘but you’re going to learn to fucking listen to me in future.’
‘Butler,’ Tony lets a smile creep onto his face, ‘yeah right, just a butler who could kill you quicker than Nat on a good day.’
‘That is my plan, Spidey. Me, a couple of bottles of whiskey, and as many crappy movies as I can fit into the time I’m awake. Weasel may turn up at some point if he gets bored, or if I get bored I may head to Al’s. But other than that, it’s just some quality me time.’
‘Right,’ he takes another deep breath and tries to do as the man suggests. ‘Alright let’s give it a go.’
Bucky had been wary of the training room when he first got persuaded to do a ‘proper’ training session, he couldn’t help the memories of his time as HYDRA’s fist pushing to the forefront and, despite his clean bill of mental health (well as far as brain washing was concerned), he was still worried he was going to lose control and hurt someone.
‘Alright, alright I get the idea,’ Bruce rubs his temples. ‘How can we speed up the process?’
Tony knows it’s that time of year again when he walks into the common area to hear overly cheerful music being played at breakfast.
‘Sure thing, Weasel. Come on, kid, let’s get you on your way home,’ the man reaches out and takes hold of Peter’s arm.
‘Only if you get pinned,’ Rocket laughs, ‘which you ain’t yet. And you won’t be if you just stay in the trap. So you’re just going to hang there until this is all over.’
got some hidden somewhere.’
we can decide if we still want to do the whole explore the dating scene.’
‘I shall have to speak to my people before I leave,’ Thor says, then turns to his brother. ‘Loki, if you are willing, I will tell the people that you are to lead them in my absence.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Thor,’ Loki knows that, not all too long ago, he would have hated himself for the next words that would come out of his mouth, ‘I will not be able to change my nature overnight, I will always be one for mischief and there may be times you doubt my intentions, but I swear to you that from now on, we will be the brothers we were before.’
‘He’s right,’ Wanda says from his other side. ‘It’s really not. I mean after the initial surprise of course.’
Steve tries desperately not to cry. In Tony’s palm sits the ring that the inventor had given him not long before everything had happened with the Accords. It’s a plain, dark blue band with a silver stripe running through it. Tony had given it to him when he first told Steve he loved him. Steve had dropped it with the shield in Siberia, knowing he deserved the ring even less than the shield after what he’d done.
‘I’m on my way,’ Natasha says at the same time he does.
‘Peter,’ he clarifies. ‘He means a lot to you doesn’t he Tony?’
‘How did the call go?’ Steve asks the Wakandan king as he joins them.
Strange sighs and holds up his hands which, Tony notices now that his attention has been drawn to them, are trembling. ‘I can’t do activities like this with these hands.’
‘-forgive me,’ Tony cuts him off, ‘but it is really only three members I need.’
‘The only place you aren’t allowed without permission is my workshop,’ Tony says, standing up and stretching. ‘But then no one is.’
‘Sorry,’ Peter grins sheepishly at his other friends. ‘Guys this is Harry, we were friends when we were growing up. We kind of lost touch when his family moved away. Harry this is Ned, MJ and Betty.’
‘We shall have to agree each set of terms as the individuals are discussed for return,’ Cardy says, turning to Tony once again and he can’t help but let out the slight breath he’d been holding. ‘Who did you intend to return first, Mr Stark? I sincerely hope not Captain Rogers.’
‘They seemed to go through what most people agreed were the classics though.’
Love always,
Tony arrives just as Ross finishes the sequence and gets to see Bucky turn round and knock out a prisoner that had tried to take advantage of his distracted state. He sends another one flying with a repulsor and lifts his faceplate, hurrying towards the dark haired man. ‘You alright?’
‘The thing is, Peter is the closest thing I’m ever going to get to a son. I love that kid. So the fact that someone looks at him the way you do? It both scares me and makes me happy in equal measure. You can look after him both as Peter and as Spider-Man, and you’re now a part of both parts of his life. That was his choice and I have to accept that. I do accept that.’ He pauses and turns to look at the mercenary again. The scarred man looks equal parts shocked and terrified and Tony wonders if he’s perhaps been a bit mean springing this on him. ‘But I will say this only once, Wade Wilson,’ he lets his voice turn hard, ‘if you hurt him in any way I swear to any and every god listening that I
‘Mr Stark?’ Peter’s voice is still muffled where Bucky hasn’t let go of him yet.
‘Oh come on you’re dying to introduce your secret boyfriend to someone,’ Wanda teases. ‘You seriously came here by yourself?’
Natasha notices a range of emotions crossing Wanda’s face from the corner of her eye as she looks at Quill. First comes surprise, then something like sadness, then understanding, before she turns a brilliant smile on the group and strides forwards, taking Quill by the arm and dragging him down the walkway and towards the facility.
‘I’m taking you up to the facility. May’s agreed you can stay as long as you like, and the Headmaster has said he’ll get work sent over for you,’ she says, pulling away just enough so only one arm is around his shoulders as she leads him out of the school and down the steps towards the waiting car. ‘We all agree he’ll feel much better if you’re around when he wakes up.’
‘I’m sorry, my king, did you say lower the shield?’ a voice responds.
‘Why are you doing this?’ he mumbles at the end into the dark haired man’s chest.
The red suited man holds his hands up, eyes of his mask wide. ‘I just wanted to see my favourite superhero. Can I have a picture? You let those tourists have a picture. Bet they’ll be going home and showing all their friends the proof they met the amazing Spiderman. And here’s little ole me with nothing to show for having met New York’s most selfless superhero.’ His tone is light and joking, but Peter can’t stop the guilt welling up.
‘They all tried, but none of them could get past the guardians that had been put in place to guard the prince and princess,’ Tony continues. ‘The first two were known as the Hawk and the Falcon, brave warriors who could see even the sneakiest monster as they tried to get past the gate, and they were so fast that no monster could escape once they decided to attack.’
‘Yes, Colonel Killjoy,’ Bucky rolls his eyes. ‘We promise not to misbehave, now put the kiddie reins away.’
Tony laughs. ‘Flattery will get you everywhere, Rogers. Now where do you want to go?’
‘He did found the Avengers,’ Vision points out, ‘and experience in things going wrong is often the best experience to have.’
Steve can’t help it. At those words he leans forwards and kisses the man in front of him, wrapping his arms around him and bringing him close. He knows it’s messy. They’re both crying and desperate, but it’s the first time he’s kissed Tony in years and it feels perfect.
‘Just get in there, kid,’ Tony laughs, pushing him forwards. Rhodey, Bucky, Pepper and Peter all walk in, leaving Steve and Tony in the hallway.
‘So what I really want to know,’ Loki hears Bucky say as he enters the common area, ‘is since when are you gay? I thought you took some girl to Homecoming?’
‘Shuri how are you getting on with Vision?’ T’Challa asks.
‘You only think?’ Bruce asks. ‘Why can you not tell for certain?’
Wanda leans against the exit to the school grounds, scanning the crowd of students leaving the halls for the youngest Avenger; she’s already messaged him to say she’d be meeting him, but knowing the trouble he’s run into on previous occasions with classmates, she’d rather be in plain sight to the rest of the student body. Just so she can get a little glowing red light on her fingers if anyone tries to pick on him on her watch.
He pulls the pillow away and frowns at Wade. ‘I thought we agreed no more weapons in bed?’
‘And it can tell you if your brain can be healed from trauma?’ he asks, looking between the three occupants and actually feeling something like hope in his chest for the first time in years.
‘Peter!’ the relief is obvious in May’s voice as she appears and draws the boy into a tight hug. ‘Oh my god I saw on the news that there was a hostage situation and I couldn’t remember if it was the speaker you’d been to see, and then I was calling the helpline trying to find out if you were there. And why didn’t you pick up your phone young man?’ She pushes him back to say the last bit firmly into his face, then her face falls as she takes in his expression. She finally notices Tony standing behind him, and he closes the door softly. ‘Don’t you dare tell me you pulled him into that situation, Mr Stark.’ Her voice is deadly.
threatened you. In the meantime I’m running around like a fucking moron trying to work out where they’re holding Tin Can, all the while wondering, if I do stumble across him, are you going to be there with him? I guess… I was just so fucking
‘Always,’ he grins. ‘Now go before someone comes after us.’
Where before she’d always been nervous at the thought of testing the limits of her powers, now she felt anticipation. Excitement. She smiles at Vision and creates a small sphere in front of them; when she’s comfortable with it she then starts increasing the amount of power contained in it until she’s at the limit she’s always set herself. ‘This is it,’ she tells Vision, eyes not leaving the sphere in front of her, ‘this is the most I’ve ever controlled before.’
‘Stark,’ Thanos greets them, with a nod of the head.
Once they have another round of drinks Valkyrie sits back, tankard in hand. ‘Now. How about we tell you what we know and then you take your turn? I get the feeling you are against Thanos as we are.’
‘I am sorry it came to this, brother,’ Loki sighs, kneeling down next to the Jotun’s body. ‘I wish you had listened to me.’
‘But Spider-Man has become like a son to me, and I want him to have the best Christmas possible. Honestly? I don’t think that’s going to happen unless you’re there as well.’
‘Deadpool’s here?’ Bucky asks as he walks in, his whole body going rigid. ‘Where?’
‘Rude,’ Tony mutters.
he muses as he sets about tying the leader up securely. He’s got a score to settle with this guy once he’s back at the facility.
‘Well,’ he sighs as she carries some of the boxes down to the common room and leaves their sight, ‘at least you tried, kid.’
‘You really are a sap aren’t you?’ he whisper-chuckles as he brushes a strand of blond hair back from his face; Steve’s been letting it grow a little longer than normal recently and Tony decides he likes it.
‘You’re crying,’ Steve answers in a soft voice.
Love always,
you want to find him and how you know him. I’m also not comfortable with having a kid in here, so I’d rather you leave.’
‘But you said pineapple on pizza is a travesty so I’m not sharing it with
‘You left me Steve!’ he shouts, rounding on the soldier. ‘You left me with no power source to my suit, courtesy of the shield you’d left in my chest. Did you even think for one second about how the
is sitting in his hospital room.
‘We ask that on a daily basis,’ Wanda laughs as she joins them.
‘Neither of them did,’ Bucky takes a long drink, nearly finishing it in one.
‘Hey Lokes, you alright?’ the inventor greets him; and Loki can’t believe his luck that Tony is leaning against the wall right under the mistletoe. Though, really, it was probably an intended move from Steve; he’d be willing to bet this is where Tony often leans when he comes out of the workshop, hence the soldier’s decision to hang it there.
‘Tell me,’ the Jotun says, and the two go to stand some distance away where they won’t be overheard. When they’re finished Lorena uses the Tesseract and disappears from sight.
Tony barely has time to return the hug before Peter’s running back to the car to open the trunk and collect the bags. ‘Merry Christmas, Pete,’ he replies, a little dazed. He looks at May’s harried expression and raises an eyebrow. ‘I’m guessing he’s been this excitable for a while?’
‘You called Peter?’ Tony tries to keep his voice calm. He is
‘She says you are forgiven,’ FRIDAY reassures him, ‘she also says she would suggest getting some ‘exercise’ with your boyfriend in bed to help with the stress but that the boss and the Captain would likely murder her, and your boyfriend is being far too sensible to be useful.’
‘You got it!’ she shouts back, a smirk on her face, confident in her team’s victory. Probably because Sam had taken that moment to swoop down and pick the ball up in his hands and fly towards their goal.
Steve laughs. ‘Alright I won’t say anything then.’
Bucky’s grin blazing into his back as he goes.
‘She knows, you know,’ Tony says as they lay together on the bed, legs tangled together and Tony half laying on Steve tracing intricate patterns on his chest that only Tony could understand the meaning of.
‘I wouldn’t bother,’ Flash interrupts before Peter can open his mouth. ‘He’s too busy being best buds with Spider-Man, and doing stuff for Iron Man. Next thing you know we’ll be hearing he’s dating the Scarlet Witch or something.’
‘Well, I mean if you’re too chicken and don’t think you can take me then I’ll let you bow out quietly,’ Wade shrugs.
‘Thanks, MJ, love you too,’ he rolls his eyes. Betty comes over to join them.
Peter laughs and lets go before heading round to the passenger door. ‘How’s things with Pepper?’ he asks as they close the car doors on the noise outside. ‘You popped the question yet?’
Well ain’t that the truth? Just not in the way Peter was insinuating; because after play passes to the teenager and Wade is having to watch him bend over to take the shot he was
‘Oh the lady he helps with shopping as Spider-Man?’
‘Thanks, Dad.’
‘Who should we aim for next?’ Wade asks as they crouch out of sight.
Merry Christmas!
‘Merry Christmas, Tony,’ Steve says in reply, pressing a kiss to his forehead.
Natasha shakes her head. ‘He’s reporting straight to Nick so I wouldn’t have heard anything anyway, but there’s been no news.’
‘You aren’t seriously expecting me to vote? Besides the majority has it,’ Loki raises an eyebrow at him. ‘And my objection comes more from the fact the man put me in a cell.’
‘Last question,’ the Headmaster says.
‘Well…yeah?’
‘If I say I don’t think you could breathe underwater you going to try and prove me wrong?’ Tony counters.
Peter frowns at the question.
He tightens his hold on her before pulling back. ‘Yeah he did. I’m glad you’re happy.’
Wait…that’s the sound of someone moving above me. Fuck it better not be Francis. I do not want to listen to that fucker droning on right now. Not when I can’t shoot him in the face.
Tony shakes his head. ‘For some things we’ll visit there. But no…I’ve got an idea of where I can take them where we’re off the grid and can be as safe as possible. Here,’ he hands each of them a slip of paper with a location on it. ‘Burn these so no one can find it. This is where we’ll be.’
‘And what kind of deal would that be?’ the man asks, crossing his arms over his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I’ll go,’ Steve says, standing up. ‘It might give us chance to…’ He doesn’t finish, he doesn’t need to. Everyone in the room knows that he and Tony need to talk. No one knows the true extent of why.
Peter turns bright red and tries to bury his face his book again.
‘I find people talk better without weapons involved,’ he shrugs, walking past the adults to the fridge. ‘Anyone want a Coke?’
‘Never,’ Steve reassures him with a smile. ‘You tell me when you’re ready.’
‘What do you want now?’ Loki snaps at the knock at the door. ‘You cannot possible have anything more to say to me.’
‘I think he’s right,’ Wanda’s voice is quiet, her eyes a little glazed. ‘Sometimes, when I’ve been at the edge of what I can control with my powers, like that day when Vis…when I caused the explosion in the training room.’ She takes a breath to get her emotions under control enough to continue speaking. ‘Sometimes it’s felt like there’s a curtain in front of me, and if I can find a way to push it back I can see another reality. Sometimes I think I’ve heard voices from there. I thought maybe it was just my powers going a bit haywire, but…maybe it’s not.’
he muses to himself.
‘Loki? Loki!’
‘Right…’ Bucky’s still trying to process everything, including the fact that
‘You’re suggesting we break with the Accords?’ Wanda’s voice sounds a little scared.
‘I’m going to make it right,’ the man answers, with such sincerity that Steve can’t help but believe it. ‘I’m one of the leads on the project.’
The rest of the team turn up in pairs or threes. Steve and Scott have made sure Hammer is secured and are doing their best to patch up Tony. Rhodes is the first to arrive, bringing an injured Clint who is clutching an arm with a grimace of pain; the military man replaces Scott at the inventor’s side and, with their basic military training, he and Steve do what they can to get Tony stable. Scott sees to Clint in the meantime and by the time Natasha arrives, supporting an exhausted Wanda, Clint is heading to the controls at the front of the ship ready to take off when everyone is back.
‘How often?’
New Year arrives, complete with 'Dance Off' and a drinking contest. And there's a surprising winner of both
The man pushes Ned into the floor, and Peter winces in sympathy at his friend’s grunt of pain, then comes over to him. Grabbing a handful of his hair and pulling his head back to make him look in the man’s face, Peter does his best to hold back a pained cry as the man shakes him.
He’s telling them about finding out at the function that Obi had been dealing under the table, sending Pepper to get the information for him, and waiting for her to get back.
‘Why not all of us?’ Steve frowns.
Loki beats the doctor to replying. ‘If he is sensible and rests enough between large amounts of use he shouldn’t suffer any lingering effects. Though something tells me our doctor friend here is not one to do as he is advised.’
‘Are the other Guardians not your friends?’
‘Oh don’t worry,’ he laughs, ‘they were always full of praise for the amazing Captain America and Sergeant Barnes the best sniper the US army ever saw.’
‘Yeah,’ Steve admits, ‘but Tony would always change it anyway.’ His voice catches a little on the inventor’s name.
‘Hush,’ Loki puts his mug down and places his hands on Bucky’s shoulders, letting waves of calm roll through the link. ‘I think, my Winter Warrior,’ he says after a few moments, ‘that they will appreciate the truth much more than offers of service for forgiveness. Besides,’ he smiles, ‘don’t you think they have
‘Just once more, Doc,’ he pleads, ‘then I promise I’ll answer all your questions on Beck.’
‘Agreed,’ Sam says. ‘Hey no powers remember?’ he points out as Strange prepares to use his magic.
he shouts through the link. Bucky’s punch goes wide and he blinks in surprise.
is not one of them. I mean you
‘Wow thank you so much!’ Ned’s still excitable tone pierces Peter’s thoughts as the boy opens the door and waves to the two Avengers. ‘Thank you, really. And Pete?’ Peter looks round at the sound of his name. ‘Thanks for pushing me out the way. You didn’t have to you know?’
He nods in response. ‘This is the one we have for the teams of soldiers and agents we work with,’ he whispers back, ‘our one is slightly…uh, well built around us needing to use our abilities to get everyone through.’
‘Ask us anything, Thor,’ Steve assures him.
A/N: Hi everyone! I am so sorry again for the delay in posting this week. I hope the end of the story has made up for it though, and it's been worth the journey getting here.
‘Sure thing Wade, hand it over and I’ll put it behind the bar.’ Weasel then hands him the money for the job, which he pockets without checking. He’s too tired to check anything right now.
‘Unfortunately it is. And he’s not doing well.’
Late on day three Wade had sat bolt upright in bed, and Peter hadn’t thought before launching himself into his boyfriend’s arms. What made him even happier was the way the team were just as relieved at Wade’s recovery as he was.
Thor, in his usual dramatic fashion, lands in front of Tony, the Space Stone is glowing on his armour, and he reaches up and takes hold of it, ripping it from his chest and handing it out. ‘Take it, and I shall return to the battle,’ he says.
‘You know for a big bad assassin you are such a baby.’
‘Get out, Sharon,’ he says, face and voice hard. ‘Before I get Wanda to escort you out.’
It’s now four days before the Yule feast. Some of the team are in the city getting last minute presents, while the rest of them are decorating the outside and focussing on getting the tree carved into a table. Currently it’s Sam and Bucky on carving duty, which surprisingly the team were a little anxious about. They weren’t
‘Yes sir,’ the worker nods and leaves him alone with his guest.
‘Yeah I know,’ he huffs, responding to Wade’s message. ‘You want me to see if we can give you a lift home?’
‘Shit you scared me, Pete,’ the dark haired man says. ‘What happened?’
he takes a deep breath,
‘Hmm,’ Sam doesn’t look overly convinced, then turns to Ned. ‘You alright kid?’
‘Steve! Bucky! Tony!’

My advice? Go with the first.
‘Yeah, he was
I wasn't originally going to... but I feel bad not doing a sneak peek:
‘Just how are you managing to fit in designing stuff for SI when you’re working on all our stuff, as well as all these meetings?’ Sam demands.
‘I need you to take Ned up onto the roof,’ he says, slipping the rest of the suit over his arms and letting it lock into place. He reaches up to his ear and takes out the comms link, throwing it to the merc. ‘Put this on and link up to the rest of the team, tell them to come pick Ned up then come back and give me a hand. Karen can patch me into the comms once I got my mask on.’
‘How do you mean?’
‘But they don’t know how often you see him do they?’ Matt counters.
Bucky laughs. ‘Come on you dork, let’s get moving. If I have to spend too much time alone with you I may go crazy.’
‘Oh yeah great idea! Definitely put those up around the windows. You sure you don’t mind?’
‘Of course,’ Peter puts on his best smile. ‘I’ll speak to you later,
‘First choice of partner in the snowball fight,’ Steve responds.
‘Aww, Widow, it’s almost like you care,’ Wade grins, she just rolls her eyes in response and goes to get ready, leaving the two of them to continue their conversation on suit colours.
Rhodes laughs. ‘Come on, Tones, time to break it up. Unless you want me to run off with another suit of course?’
a reason to panic? Surely that’s a good thing.’
Steve breathes a sigh of relief as Peter launches himself back through the portal and kneels down next to Tony, taking the ruined reactor from his chest and replacing it with the new one.
‘Did you see Flash’s face?’ Betty giggles.
‘I see,’ Tony leans back in his chair, and casts a quick look to Miss Potts. ‘It is really only three people I need, Captain Rumlow, and I was hoping Sergeant Barnes could be one of them.’
The smile Tony gives is much easier than before. ‘I’m glad. Have you tried using it as you would in a combat situation?’
'Pete!' Ned says, trying to reach his friend to help him up.
Peter looks down and his shoes, unable to meet the eyes of his mentor.
‘- and then when I was trying to jump back to the present after considering whether or not to kill baby Hitler-’
‘You make me sound like a helpless babe,’ Loki rolls his eyes.
‘Uh, yeah sure,’ he responds, still trying to get his head around the fact that Tony would be cooking. ‘You need any help?’
The next morning Steve enters the common area, slightly out of breath from his morning run; the room is empty, and for once he’s glad of that, having gone by himself to try and clear his head after last night’s talk with Rhodes.
‘Foggy? Karen said there was someone here who wanted to see me?’ Matt Murdock steps through the door, stick in hand looking every inch the blind man and not the vigilante Peter knew he was.
‘Yeah, that’s all. Just me to come now and then Hulk doesn’t have to worry about us,’ Rhodes calls back, then curses. ‘Shit! Clint the hole isn’t big enough for my braces to fit through.’
‘How does he remember all that?’ Clint shakes his head. ‘I still get turned around when I go to a floor I’m not used to.’
Loki seems to consider. ‘Perhaps three bowls with two flavours and then I shall finish with a single helping of my favourite so far.’
‘Why the hell would Peter give someone like Beck access to EDITH?’ Bucky demands.
‘Alright, I’ll be nice,’ she reassures them both.
-You don’t have to shout- Loki snaps. –I’m on my way.-
‘If Bruce has done a one eighty on him,’ he cuts across Natasha, ‘then there must be a damn good reason behind it. But we can wait to hear it until he’s stable-’
‘Just keep Tony safe,’ he replies, ‘and try not to do anything stupid.’
‘Agreed,’ Valkyrie says with a smile, ‘and thank you, Stark, it shall be good to celebrate Yule again.’
‘What is it?’ he snaps, gesturing towards his guest seated on the other side of the desk to make it clear he’s busy.
Bucky nods, looks around again, then hurries over to where Steve is pulling an unconscious Wanda out of the car, Thor already out and on his feet next to him.
‘Why do you say that?’
‘Pete, you don’t have to introduce Captain America and Hawkeye,’ Harry laughs.
‘No, but he’s alive.’
After a lecture from May when he got home, and still no word from Mr Stark, which is honestly more terrifying than if the man had picked him up from detention, Peter sits in his suit on top of a building, swinging his legs back and forth. It’s been fairly quiet this evening, which for once he wishes wasn’t the case. He’d had to physically prove to May that he’d done all of his homework before she’d let him go out on patrol. And Ned’s parting words of ‘nice knowing you’ earlier when he’d told him about Mr Stark getting notifications if he got detention hadn’t helped matters.
‘Done,’ both of them shake hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘No but you still enjoy drinking it,’ Tony replies with a smirk. He pours them a glass each and then takes a seat the other side. ‘Listen I’m not going to lie and say that wasn’t fucking hard to watch, nor am I going to say I can ever forget that,’ he sees Bucky wince and sighs, ‘but I’d already forgiven you before you even got on that plane to come back, Bucky.’
‘You mean with Daredevil?’
bad,’ Rhodes defends his friend. ‘Well alright in the run up to Christmas he is, he’s the worst Scrooge imaginable. But when you hit Christmas Eve he’s worse than a child.’
‘Aww but Widow it’s not Christmas until you’ve threatened me at least five times.’
When they pull apart Bucky looks thoughtful. ‘Yeah,’ he nods slowly, ‘maybe I’ll try. Anyway,’ he gives himself a visible shake, ‘I better see what those two drama queens are up to.’
‘The Winter Warrior is asking if we know how far we are from our designated meeting point.’
‘Well I’m sorry your jokes are so crap they have to be explained,’ Peter laughs as he drops down to avoid the merc’s swipe at his head, two feet and one hand keeping him stuck to the building, and the other still munching on the taco.
‘Uh, always, why?’
Loki nods and places one hand back on Thor’s shoulder, and one on Valkyrie’s. ‘Good luck,’ he says, and they disappear. No sooner have they gone than Loki collapses, his legs unable to bear his weight.
‘Alright, alright, don’t get your panties in a twist,’ he slings the bag over his shoulder and follows Peter up the stairs. ‘Anyway, I’m starting to think that Baby Boy nickname is more fitting than I realised. Just how old
‘Get lost, Deadpool,’ he says, turning and heading for the opposite side of the building.
‘Nah, Drax’d give us away. Or Mantis.’
‘Steve-’
‘Because you’re being overly nice. And yes everyone else is still asleep.’
‘How is he?’ Wanda asks, sounding terrified and so very different from the determined fighter she’d been not fifteen minutes ago.
‘Isn’t that what I’m supposed to pay a therapist for?’
A shout goes up from the direction of the pool table and Wade looks over with a frown; sounds like the newcomer was making a name for themselves. He's certainly surprised to see one of the more lecherous members of Sister Margaret's pinned up against the wall, but can't see the person pinning them because of the crowd of chanting mercs.
‘Tony,’ Rhodes’ gentle voice pierces the quiet, ‘there’s some other things in the box.’
‘First,’ Wanda says, with a slight smile, ‘we wait for Peter to get here and then we send him up to the storage to find all the decorations.’
‘What is it Pepper? Is there something else that I need to sign? Another pain in my ass trying to call me?’
‘Did you know about the family calendar protocol?’ he asks her.
‘It appears you have,’ Vision responds, eyeing the god’s dark blue skin tone and gleaming red eyes. ‘Are you prepared to experiment with your powers?’
‘Where
‘Look these guys have the experience working together right? We’re just going to get in their way until Tin Can is out of the picture. Once that happens we can then go in and have some fun.’
‘Spidey? What’s going on?’
‘Karen can you send that to Mr Stark please?’ Peter asks the AI, he gets an affirmative in response.
‘Pete we’re just worried,’ Steve cuts off whatever Bucky was going to say. ‘We had no idea this was going on. Tony never mentioned it, so it’s a bit of a surprise.’
‘Don’t mention it, Scott. I owe you big time.’ Once they’d gone into the elevator, Steve puts a hand on his shoulder. ‘We need to get the team together and let them know what’s happened. No one leaves the facility alone, not until we’ve got Hammer in a jail cell
Loki’s smile at his brother increases. ‘I doubt that shall be needed, but thank you brother.’
Peter frowns and turns on the stairs. ‘Why would how you look stop you from being my friend, Wade? And for the last time, it’s
‘How’s Bucky? You saw him earlier right?’
‘Not to mention there’s an indestructible merc hanging around somewhere,’ Wanda mutters, thankfully it doesn’t seem that any of the lawyers hear her.
‘You have a visitor who is insisting you leave for the day,’ he says, gesturing down the corridor.
‘We’re still trying to work out the full extent of the cave system,’ August replies as they approach the opening in the cliff, ‘but so far we have only found markings in the outer chambers.’

and not on Peter Parker and he can keep the two lives separate as long as possible. If we take away Spiderman then the kid has these powers and nothing to do with them and he’ll go mad. He’ll constantly be holding back his strength and his speed and he won’t have any outlets.’
‘Does getting absolutely hammered count?’ Tony asks.
‘Both of you,’ he amends with a grin at Steve. ‘Couldn’t have done it without you.’
‘We can’t have all the stones in one place,’ Quill argues again. ‘Otherwise it’s just lighting Earth up like a beacon to say: “hey assholes we’ve got all the power come get us”.’
He stays silent and opens the door, not even attempting to catch her as she falls to her knees in front of him. Reaching down with his vibranium arm he takes hold of her wrist and pulls her to her feet.
