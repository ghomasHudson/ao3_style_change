Dean stirs awake, taking in his surroundings; the lights are too bright, the smells are too clinical, and Cas — Cas is standing over him, eyebrows drawn together in worry. Dean groans and sits up. He’s on the floor in the bunker’s library. He carefully eyes the empty whiskey glass next to him. He’s been meaning to stop, and he’s
Dean exchanges a look with Sam. Lines of stress form across Sam’s forehead. “How long?”
They all pile into the infirmary. Rowena and Billie stand in the doorway looking into the room while Sam sits in his chair, with Eileen leaning on the desk. Cas sits by Jack’s bedside; Dean watches Cas as he gently brushes the hair out of Jack’s face. The lines of worry are etched all over Cas’s face, the corners of his eyes crinkling. Dean paces around until he eventually sits on the other side of Jack’s bed.
Cas wanders into the room, drops a jar of paint in the corner, and leans against the island, his shoulders brushing against Dean's. Despite trying to ignore the warmth radiating off Cas, Dean feels a jolt of electricity, and he wants to touch him; he wants to take Cas’s hand, touch the pulse point behind his wrist. Instead, Dean stuffs his hands into the pockets of his jacket, curling his fingers together, and focusing on the screen where Sam is asking another question.
“Hey,” Dean says, walking towards the couch. He leans down to place a gentle hand on Cas’s shoulder. Immediately, Cas jerks awake, panic palpable on his face, and his eyes flicker between Dean and Jack before his breathing calms down and something like recognition settles on his face. Dean squeezes Cas’s shoulder’s gently. “You okay?”
Right then, Jack runs past them and Dean instinctively reaches out to grab the back of Jack’s shirt to stop him. “Where do you think you’re going?”
Cas shakes his head but doesn’t stop smiling. “He’s very fond of you, you know. I’m grateful that he has you.”
“Cas,” Dean says, again. He knows nobody can hear him, but he tries concentrating in the way he would if he was praying. “I know you’re in here somewhere. I’m here to get you out. Jack and Sam are on Earth waiting for you to come home. I’m sorry that I didn’t come sooner. I should’ve, I know, and I hope you can forgive me for that.”
“That’s right,” Cas tells him gently. “Whatever it is, we won’t get mad. We’re here for you.”
“The couch doesn’t seem very comfortable,” Cas says as he sits up in his bed, his voice hoarse from just waking up. He mumbles, “We can share.”
When the car is loaded up, Eileen gets into the driver’s side, swapping out Sam’s auxiliary cord for an old cassette tape and Dean laughs. He pulls Sam back by the shoulder and says, “Marry her, or I will.”
Dean does feel guilty about that. He wants to call Claire, and he knows he’ll get around to it, but it doesn’t feel like the right time for that. Dean turns around to face Sam, crossing his arms across his chest. “I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
Dean looks up from where he’s pulling the cookie tray from the oven. “Hey.”
“A house,” Cas says, calmly, but Dean can tell the nerves right underneath the calmness. He scratches the back of his neck and says, “It might be best if we moved out of the bunker, and allow Sam and Eileen to use it for whatever they’re trying to do.”
“Dean —” Billie starts.
Dean checks his phone, hoping that Sam has something for them, but it’s radio silence. He eyes Jack as he toddles around the main room. At some point, he pulls a spellbook off the bottom bookshelf, opening it to a page. Dean feels a twist of anxiety coil inside him, and he exchanges a look with Cas. Realization dawns on both of them when they see Jack lifting one of his hands.
“So, you’re an aquarius,” Jack muses. Dean has no idea what that means. Jack eyes him considerately. “Does Cas have a birthday?”
“Oh come on, not in public spaces.”
Cas studies him carefully and Dean suddenly worries that he made things weird again. Cas looks away from him and hunches towards the desk. Weakly, he says, “Dean, I’m afraid that I haven’t been honest with you.”
This gets Cas to look up at him. His voice is quiet when he says, “Is he okay?”
“Me too,” Dean says, blinking away the tears threatening to form again. He turns back to the stove to check on the potatoes.
“And what about you?” Sam asks as he zips up one of his duffle bags. He hooks it over the handle of Eileen’s suitcase.
Dean blinks. Right, okay. Dean turns to Sam and says, “Yeah, we just bought a house.”
"Sam, I'm serious," Dean warns, low and dangerous. "I don't want to talk about Cas. He's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. So, just drop it."
Dean doesn’t know how true that is. This whole situation is insane, but that's about on course for their lives. At this point, Dean isn’t sure that anything would set them free except dying, and even that doesn’t seem to be a sure thing. He says, "One thing at a time, okay? We don't even know what the plan is."
“Hello.”
“It has to be perfect,” Dean exasperates. Sam lets out a very undignified snort. Dean glares. “I mean, it’s what he deserves, right? I’ve been a pretty big disappointment for years.”
“When it came down to it, you couldn’t do it,” Jack says, smiling faintly. He runs a hand through his hair and looks up at Dean when he says, “Dean, when I think about you, I don’t think about all that. I think about all the time that we spent together, and how you’ve taught me valuable lessons. No matter how you see yourself, all I see when I look at you is my father.”
“I think I’m getting somewhere,” Dean lies and he knows that Cas knows that it’s a lie, but Cas doesn’t call him out on it. Dean clears his throat and asks, “How’d Jack do?”
“Hey guys, what are you planning on doing with all the baby stuff?”
Dean stares after him, his stomach twisting miserably. He hopes against hope that Billie can find something — if anyone can, it’s probably her, but he knows that they’re not anywhere closer to solving this than they were before. There’s still a chance that Jack could die and there’s next to no hope that they can get Cas out of his deal. Dean grabs the whiskey bottle on the table and drinks.
She’s dressed in a smart, white suit and she bristles past him, towards the restaurant. Blindly, Dean follows her. It’s not until they’re seated and the food comes out that Amara looks at him. When she does, it’s with a curious expression. Dean clears his throat and says, “You really shouldn’t make yourself this easy to find. Your brother is back and dangerous.”
This gets a low chuckle out of Cas. He doesn’t say anything though; instead, he stares out ahead at the dark night, the clouds obscuring the stars above them. Cas’s voice is quiet, barely above the noise of the rain, when he says, “When the solar system was first formed, we used to watch the rainfalls of diamonds on Jupiter and the sulfuric acid on Venus, but it was the life sustaining water on Earth that really amazed me. The first rainfall on Earth was one of my most treasured memories.”
It’s unbelievable, really, how there’s always a new obstacle. Every time that they take two steps forward, there’s a cosmic force pulling them apart. Dean feels the bitterness creep through him; they never had a chance. Through purgatory and death, through heaven and hell, through every goddamn apocalypse thrown their way, they tried and tried and tried. Now, there’s
“You’re
Dean sees Cas tighten his grip on Jack’s hand. Chuck makes a wordless noise of fury, and more lights shatter around them. Rowena and Billie use everything they have to help Amara hold Chuck up. Eileen drops the ingredients in the cauldron as she recites the words given to her by Rowena. The fire from the cauldron erupts and the heat from the flames burns hotter, faster; they reach up to the person they’re trying to bind and Chuck lets out another strangled sound. The heat in the bunker grows to an unbearable level, and all Dean can do is tighten his grip on Jack.
“She said she’ll help,” Dean tells her. He lightly touches the vial with Cas’s grace. “Jack and Cas aren’t back yet?”
“Who was locked up in the cage for a decade,” Dean spits out. “Trust me, there’s no going back from that.”
“However will I survive?” David mutters, moving to ring them up.
“Now, Sam,” Rowena hisses. “Start the spell.”
“How could you say all that and just
Dean pouts. “Oh, come on.”
“Relax,” Billie tells him. “They’re fine.”
“Amara,” Jack explains, reaching a finger down to heal Dean’s wounds. “The energy it took to break you out of The Empty, close the rift, and put The Shadow back to sleep was too much for us to stay together.”
“Hey, Sam,” Dean says as he watches Cas run after a shirtless Jack. “Tell me you have something.”
Somehow the universe doesn’t stop just because Dean wants to drown an entire bottle of vodka, watch
Cas pushes the cart through the clothing aisle, and Dean immediately picks up a pair of pull on joggers and throws them in the cart. There’s a sweatshirt that says
Dean thinks Claire’s eyes are going to fall out of her head with the force of her eye roll. She says, “As I was saying — cute, but please don’t let me walk in on anything.”
There’s a heavy silence between them as Sam goes back to typing something on his tablet and Dean tries cooking. Sam is the one to break it when he says, “We could try Jack.”
Five minutes pass.
Sam fixes him a look and Dean knows Sam is right. Dean sighs. “Yeah, okay. I’ll talk to him.”
“You’re thinking about something,” Cas tells him casually, stepping in front of him.
, for canned stuff, and it just needs some salt and black pepper. Dean sprinkles it in, stirring it lightly. He mixes some rice into the tomato soup so that Jack can get some carbs in. It’s infinitely better than the things he fed Sam when Sam was Jack’s age; hell, it’s probably healthier than the things he eats these days.
“Dean, what the hell?”
“Scout’s honor,” Dean says, raising two fingers in salute.
Dean instinctively touches his left shoulder, even though the hand print is long gone. He exhales sharply. “Okay, yeah. So, I just gotta — you know, do it.”
Cas drops down on the chair next to Dean and pulls one of the forms, wordlessly filling it out. He hums. “I went down to the farmers’ market to sell some of the produce, especially since we’re moving into the house. Maria asked if I would like an opportunity to earn more money, so I said yes. I’m Spinelli Farm’s new farm hand.”
, Eileen signs, amusement all over her face.
Cas seems to follow his train of thought because he nods, a knowing expression flickers over his face. "Yes, I figure that she needs closure as well, and I want to be there for her.” He pauses, smiling slightly, in the sad way that he does sometimes. “She doesn't reach out to me that often, so I don't want to disappoint her."
Amara, think about it. He locked you up because you stood in the way of his perfect world. He throws away people and things at a whim just because he’s bored. He doesn’t care about anything or anyone — and, that includes you.”
Sam frowns again. “I thought things would be easier once Chuck was out of the picture.”
“You okay?”
“We’re not — no, we didn’t,” Dean manages to choke out through the whirlwind of emotions racing through him at light speed. Jack squints at him in confusion and Dean feels his entire face warm. “He probably thought it was an easier way to explain our family than to get into it.”
They go grocery shopping once a week together. It originally started because the one time he sent Cas to do it on his own, he came back with too much of everything, mostly because he didn’t know how to choose between all the options available. When Dean decided to go instead, Cas wanted to accompany him. It was under the guise of learning about the basics, but Dean knows that Cas enjoys it. He enjoys it too, if he’s being honest, even when they’re doing it at the ass crack of dawn, or whatever.
He tells Jack about how he’s the angel that saved Daniel, but it wasn’t at Chuck’s orders. Cas tells stories about creation and destruction; he talks about the first mountains forming and the first bacteria coming to life. Dean doesn’t know if Jack is registering anything, or if it’s all going over his head, but Dean can’t look away. Cas isn’t a man of many words, and Dean always wants to ask him about his life before he raised Dean from Hell, but it never felt appropriate. He knows he’s staring at Cas, but he can’t draw his aways away from how the corners of Cas’s eyes turn downwards wistfully.
Dean cracks his eyes open. “Yeah. Done.”
“Wake up,” Jack whines.
His face feels warm. It’s entirely too early in the morning for this. Dean opens his mouth, closes it again. He repeats, “We’re not — it’s not like that.”
He doesn’t know who moves first, or whether his brain is even processing anything when he moves, but the next thing he knows, he feels Cas’s body against his. Dean pulls Cas as close as he can, and buries his face in the hollow of Cas's shoulder. He registers the tears that are running down his face, but he doesn’t care. He takes in everything he can; the way Cas still smells like he did on Earth, the way the warmth radiates off his body, the way Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s hair.
He narrows his eyes and says, “Pneumonia is a thing that humans need to worry about.”
Dean looks up at where Sam is watching him. “Oh, hey, Sam.”
That’s the other thing — Jack takes to school like a fish to water. When he came home after his first day, he told them that he’s joining the school choir, which naturally means that Dean and Cas have to go to every one of his rehearsals. The other parents give Cas funny looks because he insists on recording everything that Jack does, and Dean knows how it looks. Jack, for all intents and purposes, is a teenager, but he’s also a toddler and sue them for wanting to do the normal thing and experience everything and record everything. When Dean brought up sports, Jack couldn’t have looked more disinterested, and Dean drops it. He’s never been one for sports, either.
Dean tilts his head. “Hey.”
“Stop.”
“Look, I’m sure the two of you have a lot of catching up to do, and I’d just ruin the mood,” Dean explains, raising a hand to silence Sam’s protests. “Miracle and I can just hang out here while the two of you make out like teenagers. It’s fine.”
Jack lets out a loud whine when he wakes up. Dean watches as he swivels his little head around, adjusting to the kitchen lights. He grumbles for a moment before he pokes at Cas’s face. When Cas looks down at him, Jack points at the freezer and says, “Ice cream!”
Dean falls asleep in the chair next to Cas, and he finds that he sleeps through the whole night for once.
“Yeah, well, it might have something to do with you sending Jack to his death,” Cas bites out.
“Yeah, I would be too,” Claire says, wrinkling her nose. “You should get an actual house. Cas would like that.”
“Was an accident,” Dean finishes. There was a time he wouldn’t have believed that, but he’s mostly past it now. He’s not sure if Cas is right and he’s not the person driven by anger, but at the very least, he can make a conscious decision not to let it rule him. Not around Jack, at least.
It’s nice, Dean thinks, that Sam can have this. It’s not like they’re poster children for normalcy, but as far as potential Sam Winchester cursed girlfriends go, Eileen is faring better than most. At least she’s a hunter and a legacy, so it’s not like Sam needs to keep secrets from her. They cook together; they clean together; hell, they watch boring documentaries on Netflix together. It’s the kind of domesticity that normal — well, maybe, not
Irritation pricks at Dean. He glares at Rowena. “What do you mean this won’t work?”
“That sounds horrible,” Jack says.
Dean does sit down on the bed then. “Have you decided?”
Dean places him down on the bed, making sure the pillows keep him secure. When he looks up, he sees Cas staring at him from the door frame; his eyes soften and his mouth curves up into a ghost of a smile. Dean feels himself flush immediately under the weight of Cas’s gaze.
Dean looks at Cas, who nods. They move so that they’re standing on either side of Jack. Cas reaches out to take Jack’s hand while Dean places a hand on Jack’s shoulder.
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that, so he leans over to take Cas’s face in his hands, and kisses him softly. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
Every face in the room stares at Rowena and she just tilts her head to the side and Billie walks out, holding a book. She has half a smile on her face, or as much of a smile as Billie could ever have, as she drops the book onto the table. Dean exchanges a look with Cas as they all crowd around.
hat on his head is navy blue with white writing, and it looks ridiculous, but Dean knows that Cas is too polite to ever tell him that. “I feel like congratulations are in order and I should say that I’m very proud of you, but I suspect you know that.”
“Where the hell have you been?” Dean asks, trying hard to keep the bitterness and desperation at bay. He keeps looking at Jack, like he would disappear if he looks away.
He doesn’t even know if Jack could hear him anymore. Mila is still looking at him curiously. Dean clears his throat. “His name is Jack.”
“Spit it out,” Dean tells him when he eventually can’t take it anymore.
, he thinks. Sam is still staring at him so Dean chokes out, “I’m fine.”
He pulls Cas towards him by the tie with one hand and tilts his chin up with the other before kissing him. It’s not a proper kiss, just a brush of the lips, because Jack is still settled in Cas’s arms, but Cas lets out a happy sigh against Dean’s mouth, and Dean knows that they’ll have another chance to do this right later.
Dean stands up, and Cas kisses him immediately, reaching up to cradle both cheeks. Dean makes a weak sound in the back of his throat and kisses back, eyes fluttering shut as he curls closer. When they break apart, Dean leans forward to press his forehead against Cas’s. He murmurs, “I love you.” The words still feel new, like no matter how many times he says it, it still feels like the first time.
Jack doesn’t say anything for a long time. It’s not until they pass the sign welcoming them into Lebanon that Jack speaks up. “What if I don’t like it?”
has middle of the night plans now that he and Eileen have the bunker to themselves, and he’s pretty sure talking to Dean is dead last on the list of things Cas actually wants to do.
“How do you deal with that?”
“That’s bullshit and you know it,” Dean shouts, throwing his arms up in exasperation. “You told me that locking myself up in a Ma’lak Box was the only way to stop Michael, but turns out, that wasn’t true. There has to be another way.”
Cas’s voice is quiet but clear. Dean sticks his head out of the blankets. “Cas?”
“Okay.”
“Thank you,” Dean says quietly. He reaches a hand out to run his fingers over the lapel of Cas’s trench coat because he can and because Cas lets him.
“I do,” Cas says immediately, the tips of his ears turning pink.
Dean focuses on his drink, glancing away from Sam.
“I bet it hasn’t been easy for her to come back and not have you around either,” Dean points out, making sure to keep his voice level. Sam’s eyes shoot up to meet his, and Dean can see the guilt flood behind them. Gently, he says, “Listen, man, I’m not blaming you. It’s been hard for all of us, but take it from me, you can’t wait forever.”
. Dean groans, “Of course, the kid would want something that you need to take a mortgage out for.”
Sam laughs. “Of course.”
Dean shrugs. “Probably not because he was born before Earth was even an idea.”
Dean blinks up from where he’s lying down on the bed. Miracle lets out a whine from where she’s perched near his feet. He looks towards the door where Sam is leaning against the door frame with his arms crossed across his chest. Dean tries sitting up, and winces when he accidentally knocks over one of the empty beer bottles on the side table. He looks down at his hands when Sam shoots him the same concerned look that’s permanently glued to his face these days.
realization would hit him in the middle of the kitchen while Cas is rambling on about bees to their son. But then again, this is the dream, isn’t it? Every time he pictures himself happy, this is where he always ends up. Sure, Jack isn’t actually two in those dreams, but this is the general idea, and it’s almost his.
Cas shrugs. "The doctor was a Grigori. It seems like Jack is going after them almost systematically. He killed two in Mississippi, one in Missouri, one in Nebraska, and one in Montana. Every time I get to a town that he's supposedly in, I lose track of him. Luckily, he's in the area I'm staying at now," Cas says, frowning again as he looks at his hands. "I was hoping Sam would lend a hand. My powers aren't exactly what they were."
“And you’re staying out of our lives?” Sam asks.
Dean feels like his head is going to explode. It’s like he’s explaining a divorce situation to Jack right now and that he should tell the boy that mommy and daddy are fighting right now, but they still love him very much. But, he pushes
Dean watches Cas walk down the hallway to his room, shutting the door behind him. He turns around and sets out to find Jack, and manages to locate him in the kitchen. He’s eating cereal straight from the box, and when he spots Dean, he tilts his chin up and smiles.
“No, I don’t,” Cas says immediately. He reaches down into his side table drawer to pull out a thin leather strip. Dean watches as Cas loops the strip through the vial, turning it into a necklace. He blinks up at Dean again. “I was just thinking about what I should do with it.”
“Deal,” Dean says automatically. He doesn’t know why he believes her, but he does.
Dean can see Cas shooting him considerate looks from the corner of his eyes as they walk into the market. He doesn’t say anything though; instead, he drops his box at the cashier’s table and slips Dean a list of vegetables for him to pick out. Dean walks through the aisles of the market, picking out the squash and eggplant, and things that they can grow, but never seem to get just right. There’s a small free serve coffee machine in the corner, and Dean fills up two cups.
While all the other forms it takes had something wrong with them, the version of Chuck staring back at them is actually eerily uncanny. Dean recoils at the way it’s face twists into a mocking smile. Cas shifts next to him, resting his hand on Dean’s forearm. Any words that Dean wants to say get lost in his throat.
Dean blinks. This is the part that he never thought he could get to. “Now, what?”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says finally.
Jack snaps his finger, and the light explodes around them all.
“Yeah, I’ll call her,” Sam says with a nod. He’s quiet for a moment, and Dean thinks that’s that; he’s made it through another half assed conversation,  and he could dissociate from the world again, but of course, Sam never lets anything go. He says, “What about you?”
Dean flushes and ducks his head. Yeah, he’ll probably never be used to how utterly earnest Cas is about, well, everything, but especially about him. He eyes Cas considerately. “You are okay, right?”
“Amara,” he says, feeling the same mix of fear and confusion that he always has in her presence. Except now, it’s a lot weaker than it was.
Dean feels his face warm, and wonders if he should argue it, but he finds that he really can’t. He’s gone soft, it’s almost a fact of his life. So, he doesn’t argue it; instead, he shrugs, smiling. “There are worse things to be than soft.” He tilts his head towards Sam. “Dad would probably be rolling in his grave right now, if he had one.”
Sam. We never fucking do! Every time we think we solve one problem Chuck and the universe throw at us, we open ourselves up to another problem and — and, it’s never us who suffers because Chuck wants us to kill each other.” Dean feels a tremble rising through him again. “It’s the people who we love and who love us that always die.” He hesitates before he chokes, “It’s always Cas who dies and no matter how hard I try, I just can’t save him.”
Claire doesn’t say anything else, though. He follows her into the cabin where Eileen, Cas, and Jack are sprawled on the area rug playing Clue and Sam is lying down on Donna's couch, book in hand. It’s Jack who notices her first, rising immediately to hug her.  Claire shuffles around the cabin, settling her bag down in a corner, and digging through her belongings for her pajamas.. By the time she finishes changing into them and gets back down, the pizza arrives. Once dinner is over, they all sprawl across the living room. Cas settles on the two seater, throwing an arm casually over Dean’s shoulder. Sam commandeers the other sofa for himself, saving a space for Eileen, while Claire and Jack sit at the foot of it.
“Donna did offer her cabin to us,” Cas suggests.
It’s a distraction tactic, but Dean doesn’t complain. Sam probably sent Eileen to comfort him because Sam’s go-to comfort tactic is to
“Well,” Rowena says slowly from the doorframe. “I can tell you that the gates of Hell will be closed from here on out.” She smiles at them warmly. “Of course, with the exception of yours truly. I still want to be invited to the annual Winchester holiday dinner.”
Dean looks between Billie and Jack, not quite knowing what is going on. Jack doesn’t speak for a moment, still waving his hands in front of him. When he looks at the room again, his eyes are wide and innocent in the way that only Jack can manage. He says, “I don’t know if I can handle all this power, but I think someone else might be able to.”
Dean swallows, but doesn’t say anything. Cas gets up from the chair to sit down next to him on the bed, close enough that their shoulders touch. Cas blinks at him, not even trying to keep his tears at bay. Dean thinks, suddenly, that this is the first time he’s seen Cas cry. Really, truly cry.
“There’s something else you should know. The Empty has no shape; if it shows itself to you, it can take on any shape,” Jack tells him. His voice is quiet and so utterly young when he says, “Be careful. I — I can’t lose you too.”
“They’re good,” Jack confirms and takes another bite, sitting down on one of the bar stools. He stretches his arms above his head, yawning loudly. There are dark circles under his eyes.
The thing laughs mirthlessly as it slides up to them. Dean forgets to breathe as he looks into Chuck’s face. It snarls, “Always buzzing around. It’s a wonder why I haven’t killed you yet.”
Dean sighs. “So, we’re screwed.”
“Jack, we can find another way,” Sam says when Cas’s emotions get the better of him.
Dean stirs awake when he hears the quiet whimper from next to him, and instinctively tightens his arm around Cas. The first few weeks after Cas gave up his grace, they plagued him constantly. The nightmares aren’t as common anymore, but they still flicker in and out. Dean runs an arm down Cas’s side and waits till his breath steadies, and whatever it is tonight disappears into the recesses of his mind.
with a monster truck on it, and Dean tosses that into the cart as well.
“I don’t know, Dean,” Sam says, rubbing the back of his neck before turning back to his laptop. He shifts in his seat and starts clicking around on his computer. “I think Cas is right; this might be out of our hands.”
Dean swallows hard. “Right, yeah. I can do that.”
Dean spots a cowboy hat, and not just any cowboy hat. It’s a
“You sure you don’t want to come along?”
Rowena raises a brow at him. “Forgive me for having responsibilities, Dean. You don’t want Hell to fall into chaos, do you?” Without waiting for a response, she walks over to the sigil on the ground. She eyes them for a moment before smiling brightly. “Oh, my dearest Samuel, we’ll make a witch out of you, yet.”
“No, we can’t,” Dean says immediately, his voice a lot stronger than he expected it to be. “The deal he had with The Empty was final.” He inhales sharply, counting to ten, before letting out a drawn out breath. “It’s
"Dean?" Sam asks again.
on Ramble On; there’s the classics in Stairway to Heaven and Kashmir; there’s Good Times Bad Times which Dean insists is the best song to drive down an empty road to.
“This was what I was expecting when I was preparing for Jack’s birth,” Cas muses. “Though I was still in the infant portion of my online classes. None of them prepared me for what I actually came back to.”
Dean flushes, ignoring the flutter in his chest. He clears his throat. “Yeah, well, I had to raise Sammy.”
Cas hums. “I think I vastly prefer it to being an angel.”
Dean pulls away and shrugs. “We were getting restless in the bunker.”
Jack frowns. “He might not make it back. He knows about it.”
Sam and Eileen dive into the logistics of this new network of hunters, and Dean finds himself drifting in and out of the conversation. It’s nice, he thinks, that their hunting world is so well connected now that they can do something like this. They have friends in every state — hell, they have friends in Heaven and Hell, too.
Dean tries and fails to stifle a yawn. He says, “That’s fine. We’ll figure it out in the morning.”
“Yes,” Jack says, without missing a beat. Dean looks at Cas and sees Cas struggling to keep a straight face as Patricia considers Jack. Without waiting for an answer, Jack continues, “You said that the last owners left because of the ghost, and before that, there was a string of strange deaths?” Patricia opens her mouth to say something, but closes it because Jack keeps going. “Now, I know there’s no sulfur smell, but are there cold spots in the house?”
It takes a minute for Dean’s eyes to adjust to the haze of the church, but he spots a figure illuminated by the dim light shining through one of the stained windows. Jack stands tall next to the altar, next to a discarded body on the ground. Dean glances sideways at Cas, who freezes as he stares ahead. Dean feels like he’s in a trance, like he’s not actually here, and Jack isn’t actually alive. It’s Cas who breaks the energy first, taking a step forward.
“You were hurting, Dean,” Jack says finally, meeting Dean’s eyes, and forcing a smile.
Praying to Cas was second nature, almost like talking to him. Dean still remembers the way he felt the first time he did it. Even now, Dean would sometimes throw up a prayer. It’s about nothing in particular, except, well, asking Cas to come back from wherever the hell he is. He knows that there’s nobody on the other side hearing him. While praying to Cas was second nature, praying to Chuck was an useless endeavor. Dean remembers the two times he did it, and both of them were to bring Cas back.
, he thinks because he will. He’ll be fine because Cas is here and Cas doesn’t think he’s broken. “Thank you, Cas.”
"Can we talk about this?" Dean finally asks. Cas drags his eyes away from the blade just to give him a blank look, his lips pressed together in a thin line. Dean slumps his shoulders and looks down and away from Cas. "Look, I'm really sorry for what I said, and you know I didn't mean it."
When Cas meets his eyes, he tilts his head to the side. He says, “Are you okay?”
“Why?”
"So, when are we heading back to the bunker?" Dean asks Cas when Jack hangs up the call. Cas doesn't look at Dean and instead exchanges looks at Jack, a wordless conversation passing between the two. Dean frowns. "What?"
“Your turn,” Cas tells him immediately.
“Nah, that’s all they do at that age,” Dean says with a wave. “He’ll wake up soon enough. Then he’ll probably eat, play, and then probably fall back asleep again.”
That’s all Dean really needs to hear.
“Don’t say it,” Dean grits out. He doesn’t care that he’s being an asshole making Cas an unspoken term between the two of them. He closes his eyes again. “I’m fine.”
Cas’s face softens and he looks between Dean and Jack. “I know.”
Rowena opens her mouth to reply, but Billie cuts in. “Everything we do is theoretical, Dean. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we’re trying to bind God, not some second tier demon.”
He stands up and says, “Goodbye, Chuck. Have fun living your life as a pathetic, lonely human.”
“Your announcement —”Sam starts, eyebrows drawing together in confusion. He looks between Dean and Cas before something dawns on him. Before Dean can stop him, Sam gushes, “Shit, wait — are you two engaged? I didn’t mean — oh my god, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to step on your toes.”
Cas frowns. “Michael is a very loyal son.”
“It’s okay,” Jack says quietly. His face is set into a purposeful determination. He looks over at Dean, and Dean shoots a small, hopefully encouraging, smile in Jack’s direction, ignoring the sinking feeling in his stomach. Jack turns back to Rowena. “What do I need to do?”
“It suits you,” Cas tells him when he catches Dean checking himself out in the bathroom mirror. The
Later, they drive to the house together and Dean gives Sam the grand tour. As expected, Sam criticizes all their design choices, but particularly Dean’s, which is totally unfair. When he notices the pointed lack of alcohol in the kitchen, he flashes a proud smile in Dean’s direction and Dean has to duck his head in embarrassment, but Sam keeps giving him knowing looks.
Rowena just nods and turns back to the book. She traces a finger over a diagram, flips to another page where she has scratched notes written down before turning back to the diagram. She exhales sharply. “The second ingredient is a bone from the first man.”
“Magic this complicated always has a catch,” Dean explains. It’s too easy. They all know it.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean yelps, as soon as Billie teleports into the war room. “We really need to fix the warding in this place.”
“Cas, what are we doing here?” Dean asks, his voice cracking slightly. “I’m not the only one that’s thinking —” Dean hesitates, feels his face warm. “I’m not the only one that’s feeling this, right?”
Jack also, apparently, has friends. Dean looks at Cas who shrugs. Dean sighs. “Be back before ten.”
Amara makes a sympathetic noise as she gets up from the table. “I’m sorry, Dean. I know how much he means to you.”
“I’m sure he’s feeling the devastation from all the things that happened,” Cas says sadly.
“I don’t think it can be fixed, Dean,” Cas says quietly. He picks himself off the chair, stretching an arm over his head, and drapes his trench coat over his shoulders. Cas yawns and walks towards the door, dropping a gentle hand to Dean’s shoulder. Dean eyes Cas’s hand before Cas pulls it away. The corners of his mouth quirk up into a small smile as he says, “I’ll be fine, Besides, we have bigger concerns at hand.”
Cas wrinkles his nose. “No, that would be difficult.”
“What else am I supposed to do?” Jack asks, more than a little desperation lacing his voice. “After Chuck, I don’t know what my purpose is.”
It takes two more weeks until Sam finally loses patience and starts taking cases again out of a desperate need for a distraction; this time with Eileen by his side. It’s been thirty one days since Cas walked out of the bunker — not that Dean is keeping count. With Sam and Eileen gone most days, Dean finds himself roaming the quiet expanse of the bunker. It’s disconcerting how hollow the empty, echoing rooms are now that it’s just him.
"Well, we're always here if you need any help," Sam says, smiling gently at Jack, but Dean can tell that Sam doesn’t like it. None of them do.
Billie’s voice cuts Cas off and instantly, Cas is on his feet drawing his angel blade, wincing at the sudden movement. Dean shoots up to his feet, offering support to Cas, before turning to Billie, drawing his gun.
, of all people. When Cas raises an eyebrow at him, Dean shakes his head. Whatever, it’s fine; he’s fine. "He's sorting out a vampire nest about three hours north with Eileen."
“Sorry,” Dean apologizes, but he’s not actually sorry and Cas knows it. Cas rolls his eyes, picks the discs up, and puts them into a neat little pile. Dean drops down next to Cas at the table. “How’s it going?”
, but,” He pauses, looking down at his hands. “I am open to fixing it now.”
Collapsing onto his bed, Dean tries to sleep.
Billie nods. “I’m a librarian, not a writer. Whatever you do with your life is your choice. Naturally, you will reap the consequences of your choices one day, but for now — well, enjoy what you have.”
“Still, this is kind of nice,” Dean says, reaching around Jack to push the talking button on the teddy bear’s stomach, but he quickly moves his hand away when Jack fixes him a look that can only be described as territorial. Dean smiles. “It looks like he’s calmed down, finally.”
Jack gets fussy as soon as they set foot in the store. He doesn’t struggle or anything in Cas’s arms, but he pouts and frowns and kicks his feet so that they’re lightly hitting Cas’s stomach. Cas gets restless quickly too; it doesn’t help that every employee they pass by coos at Jack. Cas awkwardly makes pleasantries while Jack keeps sulking, his tiny fists squeezing together into Cas’s trench coat.
Cas makes a sympathetic noise. Dean shrugs. “You could try school.”
"He's in Montana," Cas says, finally breaking the silence. He frowns slightly. "He — Dean, he killed a doctor and ate his heart."
“Can you hear me?”
Jack eyes him with the same innocent curiosity that he views most of the world. Despite Jack not being Cas’s actual kid, there are moments when the resemblance is uncanny.
Dean blinks and looks between Jack and Cas. "What the fuck do you mean that you're not coming back to the bunker?" He tries really hard to keep his voice level, but Cas's face immediately closes off, and he clenches his jaw in a way that tells Dean that Cas doesn’t want to have this conversation, but Dean doesn’t care. Dean glares. "We drove all this way to get Jack and
“I already downloaded the app,” Claire tells them, looking up from her phone. “It’s like uber for hunters.”
“We need to talk about it, you know,” Dean says patiently.
“You know what I mean,” Sam says, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Besides, it’s been a while since I’ve gone on a solo hunt.”
“No, I want to,” Dean says. Cas takes several steps forward so that he’s looking down at Dean. When Dean meets Cas’s eyes, he feels like the dam is opening inside him and all his emotions are ready to burst out. He exhales sharply. “Look, I know I haven’t always been the best to you —”
Dean blinks, trying to grasp what’s going on.
The first thing Dean notices is
There’s badly made pancakes that are totally Jack’s doing. He pulls a cup off the shelf and pours himself coffee. He eyes the papers in front of Cas carefully. “What do you have there?”
Dean feels his stomach twist and something ugly coil in his core. He doesn’t know why he expects anything else. He’s lost Cas enough times to know that. He watches the little boy with the kite run around with Miracle. Dean tilts his head towards them. “Your son?”
When he opens his eyes again, Cas is staring at him with such gentle fondness that Dean feels a rush of warmth surge through him. Cas smiles. “Dean Winchester, I have no doubt that you can do anything you want to.”
"Me too," Dean admits.
The search for Michael is a dead end. The search for Lilith is somehow even harder. They might as well forget about Chuck considering he’s in any one of the thousands of worlds he’s created, and now, destroying. The hunts dry up as well; it’s almost as if the monsters realized that something big is about to go down, and have decided to make themselves scarce. Sam tries to find them cases every few days; there’s a cursed television, a random wood nymph in the bunker that they somehow missed, a couple of vengeful spirits, but mostly it’s quiet. Dean finds that he doesn’t really mind that much. He likes doing regular housework around the bunker, and he likes sleeping in. Everything is such a shit show outside that it kind of feels nice when he can stay at home and relax. So, naturally, just when he’s feeling some level of normalcy, Billie makes her presence known.
Billie turns to Jack, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Are you ready, Jack?”
“We — we should — you know, figure out where McAllister is buried,” Dean stammers; his body feels uncharacteristically hot and bothered. Jack seems to take the distraction at face value though because he pulls the EMF meter out again. Dean lets out a sigh of relief.
“Christ,” Dean snorts. Cas instinctively shoots him a reproachful look, and Dean raises a hand in apology. He shakes his head and makes his way around the passenger side. “You and Sam should have just staged an intervention.”
Eileen looks at him for a long time before she smiles. She signs along as she says, “Well, there’s always Daphne — or Fred, if you’d rather.”
“I’m sure it’s the same with Eileen, but you’re still trying to impress her,” Dean shoots back.
“Hello, Dean.”
Jack is easily the smallest toddler that Dean has ever seen, which isn’t a heavily researched opinion, but he’s smaller than Sam, which is the metric that Dean uses to measure. He falls asleep quickly on the ride back to the bunker, and when Dean lifts him from the car seat, he nods his head against Dean’s shoulder. Dean feels a rush of affection when Jack rubs his eyes with tiny fists before he drops his head back to Dean’s shoulder. Dean leans down and places a light kiss to the top of Jack’s head.
Before he can say anything else though, Eileen strolls in with two guns in hand. She smirks at Dean and says, “I’m stealing these.”
“Being human, you’ll have a slightly longer time before The Empty detects your presence. It doesn’t react well to a human soul, but you’ll need to find Castiel,” Jack explains, giving Dean a pointed look. “The reason I suggested that you do this instead of me or Sam is that you and Cas already have an unbreakable bond, and if anyone could find him, it might be you.”
“I’m not good at this,” Dean admits, waving between them. “You know, my old man got on my case whenever I brought up how I felt, so for a long time, I didn’t know how to talk about things, and I still don’t. When I put you in that box —” Dean freezes, and Jack’s face falls. It takes everything in Dean not to hurl from the way his gut turns at the fear that crosses over Jack’s face. Dean says, “When I put you in that box, I did it because I was scared, but — but, I should have been there, and I should have tried harder to understand, and for that, I’m sorry.”
Dean knows Jack isn’t sleeping well; hell, he’s not sleeping well, and he’s had way less to deal with than Jack has recently. The second night after Cas left, Dean finds himself up late, not quite knowing what to do. He debates calling Sam or Cas, but Sam
He opens the door to Sam’s room first which is undecorated except for a small photograph of him and Eileen on the side table. Dean walks down the corridor until he’s standing in front of another room. He hesitates for a brief moment before opening the door to Jack’s room, which has been left completely untouched. There’s the empty snake tank in the corner, a stuffed bear on a bookshelf, and sheets that look freshly slept in despite nobody living in the room for exactly forty two days. Dean takes a careful step inside, bare feet pattering on the tiled floor until he makes it to the bed. He lifts the sheets gently before pulling them off the bed. He turns the corner away from Jack’s room towards yet another one.
“I don’t need it,” Cas confirms, although with the way he’s hogging the sheets, that seems a bit dubious. He grumbles, “But I do enjoy it and I would ideally like to get more of it right now, if you don’t mind.”
Jack pouts, but he pulls out his pencil and starts working on it immediately. Dean is about to turn back to the parent or guardian forms when he hears the bunker door open and close. Cas strolls into the room, dressed in  a pair of jeans and one of Dean’s old band t-shirts, and grins at them.
He looks away from where Jack is scrolling through local cases to nudge Claire. When she looks at him, Dean says, “So, that’s school officially benched?”
Jack looks up and Dean smiles encouragingly. Jack bites his bottom lip, a flicker of nerves crossing over his face before he sighs. “I don’t feel anything, and that scares me. Logically, I know things that are true, like —” Jack hesitates, a hint of something Dean can’t read passes over his face. He slowly presses on, “Like I know that I feel bad about killing your mother.”
Sam pinches the bridge of his nose and lets out an exhausted sigh. "Dean, whatever you said to him, I'm sure you guys can fix it. You always do."
Dean steps back from Cas to eye David Jenkins, who crosses his arms in front of him, and eyes them warily. Dean points a finger at him. “Just for that, Dave, you’re not getting an invitation.”
“You’ve been watching us,” Dean asks, but it comes out more as a statement. Jack just shrugs in response. “And, clearly that didn’t work because Cas is still stuck there.”
Dean turns to Cas. He looks tired, with dark circles under his eyes and a slight line of tension in his jaw. Dean asks, “Are you okay?”
“Just ask me,” Dean tells her, just itching to get it over with.
Dean looks over Cas’s shoulder at where Jack’s sleeping form lay. Dean shakes his head. “You already apologized, Cas.”
"Fuck you, you son of a bitch," Dean says quietly into the emptiness of his room.
"And I know you care about him," Sam says with careful, practiced patience that only Sam can really manage. There's another lengthy pause. Sam clears his throat. "Dean, I didn't want to bring this up because it's none of my business, but I remember how you were when Cas died, and I know whatever you have with him, it's a hell of a lot more than you have with anyone else in this world."
Cas pulls away, tilts his head to the side, and raises a brow. “For what?”
Dean jolts awake and feels his pulse racing wildly in his veins, a hand pushing him back down on his bed. He looks up to see Cas standing over his bed, his brows pinching together in worry. Dean feels his breath become ragged in his throat, and he just stares at Cas.
Something flickers across Sam’s face and he gives Dean a knowing look and an even more knowing, shit eating grin. His eyes dance with amusement when he says, “Oh, trust me, I absolutely do not mind.” He looks between Cas, Dean, and Jack and grins again. “Let me know if you guys need any help.”
Dean thinks that Cas doesn’t get nearly enough credit for being the best fucking father in the universe because the level of concentration that spreads across his face should be criminal. He can literally see Cas considering every single day. Patiently, Cas says, “My birthday should be June 18th.”
Dean feels twitchy and restless. He hates not knowing what the plan is. Sure, Jack can probably kill Chuck if Billie is to be believed, but there are obviously cosmic consequences to taking out God. There’s Amara, which is it’s own can of cosmic worms; there’s Hell, there’s Heaven losing all sense of being, there’s an infinite number of things that could go wrong. There’s also the fact that because Billie hasn’t been clear on the plan, there’s every chance that they’re leading Jack into undue danger with this mission. Dean knows that they’re all thinking it, but nobody wants to say it.
Dean's eyes flutter shut and he sighs against Cas's mouth. It’s not gentle, but nothing about them has ever been gentle. It’s filled with the desperation born out of years spent yearning for something more, but never being brave enough to take that chance.
Eileen shrugs. “I said nothing.”
“Wake up!” Jack says again, and this time it’s a demand, or as demanding as a two year old can manage.
“A boy,” Dean says, shutting down the strange mixture of guilt, pride, and sadness that rises through him. “Jack, he’s...” Dean frowns, looking up at the sky again.
Dean doesn’t know what possesses him to take a step closer to Cas, dropping his coffee mug on the counter. He feels time still around him as he moves towards Cas, who blinks up at him, his eyes wide and startled. He moves a hand around Cas’s neck, and he can see Cas’s eyes flicker between his eyes and his lips.
going to propose.
Cas lowers his voice just a fraction. “Dean, we’re not paying for any of this with our own money.”
Dean doesn’t know when he falls asleep, but when he wakes up the next morning, he realizes that he managed to go through a night without nightmares. When Dean looks down, Cas has an arm sprawled across his chest and their legs are tangled together; Cas is snoring lightly, and Dean has half a mind to just lay there until he no longer can, but he doesn’t. He pulls himself out of bed and grabs an old book detailing everything the Men of Letters knew about cosmic entities off his desk.
Dean looks over at Cas who shrugs. Dean frowns, eyeing Jack carefully. “Are you alright?”
, will you marry me?”
, he thinks. The worst part is that he doesn’t want to; he never wants to, but his fingers twitch around it. The hunt isn’t that far out of routine, but it still took enough out of him that he takes a swig without thinking. Then he takes another, and another.
“I do, but you should say it anyways,” Dean says, preening. He likes validation, sue him. “Or, you could show me how proud you are.”
Dean laughs at that, a wave of relief washes over him.
"Hey," Sam says when he finally breaks the silence; he drops his tablet down onto the table and furrows his brows. Dean traces the rim of his glass and turns away from his brother. Calmly, Sam says, "Have you talked to Cas recently?"
“Dean?”
“Please, Dean, I’m so bored at home,” Jack says, with only a hint of begging, but it’s enough for Dean to soften.
When Dean kisses Cas, he's dizzy from the gratitude and the world ahead of them and the way Cas laughs into his mouth.
Jack blinks back into consciousness an hour later. When his eyes open, he scans the room and smiles when recognition hits him. He looks down at his hands before waving one in the direction of a light. It flickers on and off for a minute before shattering.
Eileen shakes her head. Dean eyes his watch and mentally tries calculating how long it would take to drive back from Santa Fe, but feels the worry curl in his stomach anyways. They have Billie with them, which is always an insurance policy, but that should mean they would be back quicker, right? He doesn’t get to spiral because right at that moment, Billie transports back to the bunker; Jack immediately drops to the ground while Cas hobbles to a chair.
Dean can see Jack attempting to download the app on his phone, and exchanges a quiet look with Cas. They haven’t talked about a full retirement yet, but it’s in the cards. Dean knows that he probably has some civic duty to hunt, but all he wants to do is stay home, curled up with Cas and argue about what show they’re watching on any particular night. They know that they can’t stop Jack, if that’s what he’s interested in, but Dean still worries about it.
Dean flushes and ducks his head, but Jack just eyes him curiously. If he senses everything Dean is feeling, he doesn’t say anything. Instead, Jack takes the jacket from him. Within a few seconds, he waves the blood off the jacket into a vial he produced. He smiles slightly. “This might actually work.”
When Dean nods, Cas puts his cup down and leans in front of Dean, stretching up to grab a coffee mug from the cabinet above Dean’s shoulder, his face mere inches from Dean’s own. Without thinking, Dean reaches out and grasps Cas’s hip, fingers draping over the thin cotton of his shirt, tracing his thumb along the band of Cas’s track bottoms, touching the skin right above. Cas’s breath hitches above him for just a fraction before he grabs the coffee mug.
Cas clears his throat and Dean can feel his own close up. Cas says, “You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know, Dean. Ever since we met and ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has been the best part of my life. You changed me, Dean. You’re the love of my very long life, and I cannot wait to spend eternity with you.”
— of all things — to talk to Cas about their kid walking into a suicide mission.
“I thought that if I could come back here with a win for you, you would welcome me back. I’m really sorry that I couldn’t do that,” Jack says, quietly.
“That’ll do it,” Dean says, nodding somberly. Patricia just looks confused. “So, Patricia, do you know where Clive’s buried?”
would do it.”
Dean sits up and lets out an exasperated sigh. Jack, satisfied at getting one of them up at least, rolls over. He lays on his back and blinks his saucer like, too big for his tiny face, eyes and smiles. Whatever sleepiness Dean was feeling instantly dissipates, and he grabs Jack around the waist to pull him up so that he’s sitting on Dean’s lap. He looks down to see Cas curling up against him, under the covers, his dark hair falling into his face and pillow creases decorating his face. It’s the cutest fucking thing Dean has ever seen.
Cas tucks his face back into Dean’s chest, closes his eyes, and mumbles, “Very much so.”
"I can help," Dean offers quickly, and hopes that his silent plea translates over. Dean regrets many things in his life, but the way things ended with Jack is right at the top of the list, so if there's even the slightest hope that he can make amends, he needs to try. Jack is his kid; he's
To be fair, Jack is very clever, but Dean lets him win the first game, but then he wins the second one to keep it interesting but loses the third, allowing Jack to win the best of three. He makes a show of being a sore loser, which gets a laugh out of Jack. Dean loves this; he loves the way Jack’s eyes light up whenever he wins random board games and the way Cas laughs at Dean’s terrible shit talking. Something tugs in Dean when he looks between Cas and Jack. They’re his family, in every way. They’re the people he gets to cook dinners for and have game nights with. It’s so painfully normal that Dean just lets himself
, he thinks, but he doesn’t have to worry because he lands in the bunker, hitting the floor hard. Next to him, Cas is lying on the ground. Above him, a puff of black smoke rises up through the roof of the bunker.
“I mean, why is it complicated?” Jack asks slowly. “I mean, you and Castiel love each other, so whatever you’re fighting about isn’t a big deal, right?”
“You bought a
“Did you really?” Dean asks, raising a brow at Cas. He laughs. “Man, you’re terrible at this.”
With a wave of her fingers, Billie teleports Chuck out of the bunker. Dean feels a rush of relief through him. He looks over at Cas who smiles at him, the corners of his eyes drooping down in relief and something akin to happiness. It doesn’t last long though because Jack whimpers on the ground below them.
Cas’s small, shy smile is the last thing Dean sees before he pulls Cas close to him to kiss him; he feels like the axis of his world is finally angling itself correctly. He can hear the cheers around the hall, but all he notices in that moment is Cas.
The next time Dean wakes up, it’s in a bed in one of the bedrooms. He could hear the wind blowing outside, rattling the window panes. Next to him, he can feel the coldness emanating from the empty spot where Cas should be, but currently isn’t. Dean slips out of bed, throwing his robe on, and walking out into the quiet house. The rain drumming on the roofing, slowly escalating from quiet pings to something more drastic, is the only sound to spread through the cabin. He tip toes into the living room where Jack and Claire took a couch each. From the drawn curtains, he can see the porch light on.
When Cas looks at him, Dean can see the fear flash behind his eyes. Dean swallows hard. Everything he could say is so incredibly inadequate in the moment; losing a part of yourself is the most terrifying thing a person can experience, and Dean can’t imagine the profound unfairness at Cas losing his oldest memories.
“Uh, so, you remember uh, Matt?”
“Perhaps you just loved them.”
“She’s got nothing,” Sam said.
“He makes a valid point,” Sam said. “With the exception that I don’t believe she’s a witch.”
“I,” she swallowed. “Dear God. I have no idea what to say.”
“Cas,” Dean cleared his throat.
Perhaps he did feel something for the Winchester. Love, or maybe the start of love, affection, admiration. Whatever he felt for him, it hardly mattered. Uriel was bluffing. And Dean was supposed to be dead.
Sam struggled to hold back his laughter. “Yeah, you can find faith at
“Okay, why’s that?”
He turned to Cas, who was watching him with a thoughtful gaze.
Sam sighed, “no man. We were lying.”
Either Dean was hallucinating, or the angel’s cheeks had turned red.
Despite telling himself not to, Castiel found himself looking at Dean’s table, observing how he was with Sam and Jo. So at ease. So comfortable.
“Okay.” Sam stopped him there. “Maybe she is a witch. But we have to be careful, if she goes missing, then people will probably remember the two strange men in the bar asking where she was.”
“How much did you drink last night?” Sam asked.
The door swung open at that very moment. There stood Bec looking happy to see them. “Hello! Please come in! I apologize for the mess; I didn’t have much time to clean.”
The two were now marching towards him. Perhaps they meant to be intimidating, but Castiel did not feel threatened and felt no need to flee.
“Great. So, about that credit card theft. I won’t go to hell, right?”
“Oh, hey,” she halted. “Did you enjoy the service?”
“I remember,” Sam said. “You were gone a lot longer than I expected. Dad came home pissed.”
Uriel was lying.
“Castiel-”
Castiel got better at hunting, cleaning, cooking, and according to Dean, he got better at kissing, too.
Sam said that was gross.
Dean scoffed. “Tell me about it.”
“It works for me,” Dean said with a shrug.
“There has to be something we’re missing,” Dean said.
Sam called Rowena the next day, but she still had nothing.
“Who doesn’t do magic?”
“I do not wish for conflict,” Castiel said. Then he flew away.
“Look Ellen, I’m sorry that I-”
As the two got into the car, Sam was smugly grinning at Dean, and Dean fought the temptation to hit him in the back of the head.
Dean flipped him off. “Get in the car.”
“A human being.”
What was there to be scared of? He had just been simply standing there. No matter. If humans prefer he’d sit somewhere, he could go sit with Dean.
Damn. Maybe he’d try again later when he wasn’t so out of it.
“I heard that!” Bobby yelled from across the house. “Don’t think I’ve lost my ears, boy. I’m not letting you get all lazy and dependent on that angel.”
No point in hiding it now. “Nope.”
His hands slipped up his shirt, and Castiel groaned before he could stop himself.
Dean bit his lip. Then looked back at Castiel, a question in his eyes.
“No,” Castiel assured him.
“Okay,” Cas said softly. “If there’s anything I can do to help, all you have to do is ask.”
“I’ll see you again, Dean,” Castiel said.
Castiel did not let his wings stay in physical form for long. Dean looked no less surprised, even after his wings were out of view.
“O-okay, yeah,” Dean’s voice definitely did
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Sam said regretfully.
“Wow.”
“I don’t understand. Why would you pay to see such a thing?” Castiel asked.
“It looks like someone tried to get in, but I hope we scared them off,” Sam said as he and Dean returned to Bec, who was still standing in the living room, terrified.
“Bitch.”
“Right, so you
Dean was the one acting childish. He refuses to understand. Castiel would have to make him understand.
“Gee uh,” Dean’s face became much more flushed. It relieved him that Cas was sitting in the back and couldn’t see him. “Thanks.”
“Well, maybe there aren’t many cures for this curse, Dean,” Sam said. “We already know one. You’re just too much of a coward to go through with it.”
Castiel finally found them outside, heading towards Dean’s car.
Of course, it wasn’t long before Sam barged into his room shouting, “dude, you need to wake up, it's almost four.”
“Castiel?”
Dean and Sam got back to the bunker. This time Dean was properly drunk. He had figured might as well. He already felt like shit.
Jo whistled, “yeah, gotta go check those
After the dishes were done, Sam went out to get food, and Bobby and Dean sat down on the old couch together, getting drunk.
Castiel searched for Dean’s gaze.
Sam groaned. “God. My brother is a dumbass.”
“It really does,” Dean said.
Cas gave a hesitant nod.
"Cas, what makes you question faith?” Bec asked.
Dean and Cas were pressed close together, and Sam knew.
“Of course,” Sam said. “Whatever it is, you can talk about anything.”
Dean groaned, “good point. we’ll just ask nicely for her to remove the curse?”
“Ow!”
Dean slammed his coffee mug down on that table. “THAT SON OF A BITCH.”
“I sense you are uncomfortable,” Castiel noted.
“I’m calling the cops-”
“All right,” Cas responded.
Dean Winchester was unlike anyone, human or angel, he has ever met. Yet, that didn’t mean he loved him. He hardly knew him.
Dean’s ears were burning. This was a mistake. He should have found another cure. He never should have told him. “Yeah.”
a tad. Mind repeating that?”
“Shh,” she whispered. “I am sensing energy.”
“Okay, I get it, his fashion sense is shit,” Dean said.
(The answer was porn. And Dean never let Sam hear the end of it.)
Dean grinned, “was I too cute?”
“Matt was gay.”
“Uh.” The amusement in Sam’s tone died, replaced with concern. “Wow, you really don’t look good. Are you sick?”
"Is it me you’re trying to convince, or you?" he asked, looking straight into his brother’s eyes. Dean swallowed and without a word stood up and started to leave, bringing his half-empty whiskey bottle along.
“You have this tendency to-”
“No, coriander. I hate it.” he explains and finds that there is no coriander threat in the dressing. Dean just laughs with his mouth full and by all means, it should be rude and disgusting. But as Cas watches him, disgust isn't the thing tugging at his heart. He doesn't bother asking himself what it is. He's still looking at Dean definitely not pondering about how he feels when he notices the other has a piece of meat stuck on his chin.
"I was thinking we could hit the books and try to find a way to bring Cas back…" he said, maybe too softly. Dean just stared at him.
"That’s right. I know. And either you tell me what the hell happened back then or I swear I’ll drag Cas out myself to tell me." he stated, his eyes piercing Dean’s. He felt victorious.
"We have to go." Cas wasn’t smiling.
Dean lets the young couple fill in the registration forms and grins at Cas. His shirt is a bit crumpled and his hair a little more tousled than usually, but he does look rested.
“Nice to meet you.” he answers and take his place next to Dean, logging into the system and going through the checklist that Jo gave him. Between few check-ins, Dean quickly briefs him on the numer of arrivals and afternoon procedures, tells him how to handle corporate customers, and offers him a coffee.
Cas just nodds. He has heard about the compulsory trainings provided for all employees, even part time, and he actually looks forward to finally visiting the campus. And it's not like he has ever been to Munich, either. He doesn't dwell too much on the thought of going with Dean. After all, he gets along with all of his colleagues.
“I don't understand why they couldn't leave from Munich as scheduled...” he allows himself to complain and licks his lips, he's parched.
. Like Cas expected something.
“But don't force it, okay? Just let things happen for once.”
It was then when Cas joined them, his mood not unsimilar to Dean's. Eileen signed to him whether they enjoyed the trip and Cas nodded, smiling.
Cas looked up and his eyes landed on Dean, who was sweaty from his morning run, and on top of all that, wearing shorts.
“It wasn't particularly busy.”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
, and indeed, soon enough the trees on the sides cleared up and a nice looking lake came into the view, its waters sparkling in the sun. As soon as Cas parked Dean practically jumped out of the car. Cas ignored him and went to fetch their stuff from the trunk while Dean looked around.
“I'm not sure what I'd like.” he confessed, looking around as if overwhelmed by choices. Maybe his deer in the headlights look was about more than just clothes. Sam suddenly wished his brother would pull the stick out of his ass and address whatever it was that was going on and actually helped Cas with being human. But that wasn't his fight. He sighed and looked around and something caught his eye.
“Dean...” he said, and when Dean turned to him, he noticed Sam was pointing at the wall behind the counter. He froze when he recognized the unfinished sigil drawn in blood.
“I'm starving.” Dean announces as soon as they meet up for breakfast. Cas doesn't listen as he is evaluating that Dean looks way better in a dark blue shirt than the horrendous beige of their uniforms. He also doesn't fail to notice that he is wearing shirt in a very similar shade.
"Dean, I can’t leave." Dean bit his lip and placed his hand on Cas‘ shoulder.
“I'll say it for the last time — let him go.” repeated Dean, his voiced laced with anger. Asbeel chuckled. Cas notice that glint in Dean's eyes as both he and Sam attacked the angels, the years of fighting by each other's side paying off. Cas wiggled his wrists more, the rope cutting into his skin with sharp sting, but he took it no heed. He could do it. He shot a quick glance to the fight.
"Wouldn’t Cas want you to use this chance? To have a life?" he asked again, his gaze unwavering. Dean frowned.
“I hoped it would be, yes.”
That was about two weeks ago. He took a sip of his beer as he searched for local job openings. He did have the fake identity Charlie created for him, and with his GED and other skills, he could apply for a normal job. But before he could contemplate over an open position displayed on his screen and whether “normal” was what he was looking for, he heard the bunker door open and two sets of steps He slammed the laptop shut and stood up, heading in that direction. He couldn't avoid them forever.
"Dean…?" Cas asked incredulously, his blue eyes piercing Dean’s very bare soul. He wanted to say something, he wanted to say so much. He made a step forward, Cas still watching him as if to determine whether this Dean was real or not.
“Hello, Dean.”
, he thinks,
“Dean!” he heard Sam shout, or maybe he shouted it himself. He couldn't tell.
"He said he loved me and I… I couldn’t… I didn’t say it back. I didn’t say it back Sammy…" he muttered, his voice so filled with despair and pain and regret it brought tears to Sam’s eyes too. He wanted to reach out and comfort him, but Dean felt too far. Too distant. Too lost.
"Not without this." he said and showed the Empty the vial filled with his grace. The Empty froze in its tracks.
Dean joined him and sat down on the bed. Cas couldn't miss how his shoulders slumped, and he sat up.
Dean looked at him and bit his lip, before sighing again.
“I think you should talk to him. Like, really talk.” his brother continued. “He's new to this whole human thing. He's a bit lost.” he admitted, running his hand through his ridiculous hair and sitting down with his Caesar.
“Bring him back...” he whispered to the silence. Sam saw his hand, which had an awful looking wound, clutch Dean's body stronger.
"Cas, I…" Dean’s words were said in shaky voice, almost whispered. Sam felt a pang of guilt in his stomach. He shouldn’t be listening.
“We want nothing to do with him. Other than kill him to pay for what he's caused, of course. But we do want something from you...” Tamiel said, pointing his blade towards the Winchesters. If Dean or Sam were confused by the revelation, Castiel couldn't tell.
And Dean was standing in a barn. It was just him, his memory self, and Bobby. The barn’s walls were painted with every sigil imaginable, yet he felt calm. He felt anticipation. He could almost feel his breath getting stuck in his lungs in the waiting for it to happen.
This time, he was in a old crypt. He saw himself again, face all cut up and bloody, kneeling in front of Cas. He knew, he could tell he was saying something, but he couldn’t hear properly. His ears were ringing and he felt numb. And Cas kept hiting him and Dean still couldn’t make up a word of what he was saying.
Sam and Cas turned their heads to the voice. Jack gave them a gentle, sad smile. He walked over to them and crouched next to Dean, slowly looking him over. Sam felt immense relief.
"I have no idea."
“You see, we were actually going to pay visit to you, Sam Winchester. You're easy to find. But then you lead us straight to your brother, and we figured out...why not pay Castiel over here a visit as well? Two birds with one stone.” Asbeel spoke up. Dean shot a quick glance at Sam, and then turned back to the angels.
“Jack is good. He restored your wings, he...”
"I’ve come to grip you tight and raise you from perdition." he said, feeling his heart beating so fast it felt like it could jump out of his chest. It was now or never. And then Cas was crushing him in an unexpected hug. Dean would have loved to savor that moment a bit, but they still had work to do. He pulled away and looked at Cas.
“Did you mean that?” he asked carefully, as if he was afraid of the answer. It was then when Dean realized what Sam was trying to tell him. He took a deep breath.
“It's Sam.” he called out.
“So..” he started, but Cas stopped him by placing his hand on his shoulder.
"You’re mine. I can do whatever I want here. Let you relive your worst memories, destroy and corrupt your best…" it said, waving hand around as to demonstrate just in what kind of memory they were standing. Dean would have felt relieved, had the situation been different. Cas, however, smirked.
"I have no idea. We'll figure it out as we go." he said finally, looking over at Cas, who nodded and added "We're leaving."
“No, Dean. You quit. I've never started.” he corrected, and he immediately felt a bit like an ass, because it didn't really matter. Dean didn't want him to hunt. So he wouldn't.
He slowly opened his eyes, his vision adjusting to the alabaster colored walls of the bedroom. He looked over at the alarm clock on his bedside table. 7:26 a.m.
“My apologies. I won't overstep again.” he said and
“Otherwise, one of us would have to change and I don't have a spare and you look good in this color.” he continues and Cas freezes, even if for a tiny moment.
“Train ends here.” says the guy, his English ladden with thick German accent. Cas studies the ticket and then shoves it into the poor guy's face.
Cas still looked utterly confused.
“What do you mean we have to get off??” Dean questions the guard, frowning, as Cas gathers their stuff.
"I love you too."
Dean went to the kitchen area for his usual after-work beer. “Joe's sister has a small grocery store a bit out of town. Next to the gas station. She's looking for some help.” he explained. Cas considered it.
“Morning, Cas.”
"He said he loved me."
Over the course of morning, Dean was happily teaching Cas how to fish. And if his hand lingered on Cas's a little too long, or if he stood a little too close,
Eileen smiled at him while wiping the table. "They'll be okay."
Cas managed to lock his eyes with Dean, internally praying that they don't tell them anything that could in any way endanger Jack. Or Dean, or Sam.
“I'll talk to the coach. I'm sure he'll understand” he sugests and does exactly that.
“Shopping. If you want something extra, text him.”
He couldn’t sleep that night, Dean’s sobs still echoing in his mind.
thought Sam. He wanted Dean to get angry, to break and spill. He wanted to help him. So he continued, determined.
"Did Dean mention to you how Castiel summoned the Empty back then?" asked Eileen, half signing her question. Sam sighed. That was a qood question, too.
He could feel it. The blood seeping into his shirt, warm and lot of it. Dean didn't say anything. Cas pulled him closer.
. He was holding some sort of book which he quickly placed somewhere on his dresser. Because Cas had a dresser now apparently.
“Dean, are you okay?”
Without giving himself time to freak out, he grabbed Cas's hand and gave the waitress a small smile.
“Uh, sure, why not. Baby needs to stretch her legs.” he found himself agreeing just as Sam retuned.
“No. But am I ever sure about something?”
Cas develops a routine during following months. He find himself balancing his shifts and school schedule just fine, and he genuinely likes his job. Well, most of it. Becky can get a little annoying, as she is, nicely put, an ass licker, but she's also capable and nice to chat with. He's also often paired with a girl named Bela, who somehow manages to trick customers into thinking that she's genuinely interested in their London experiences, while turning to Cas badmouth them as soon the lift door closes. And then there's Dean.
"Cas would have to become human…" he finished, finally realizing that this, this might actually be their chance. To get Cas back. But it sounded too good to be true.
“Oh, don't you worry Dean. Castiel is fine. For now.” said the stranger and Dean felt shivers crawling up the back side of his neck.
"So, Eileen and I have been thinking about going to visit Charlie and Stevie, you coming with us?" said Sam, attempting to have a decent conversation with Dean, which seemed harder than impossible lately. It seemed like perfect time, too, being it just two of them with Eileen out shopping. Dean looked like he considered it for less than a second.
"It's different now. We can actually make a big difference for all the hunters out there." he said, Eileen nodding and grabbing his hand. "It's our job." she added. Dean nodded approvingly and Sam looked at him a bit confused as he realized something.
They walk mostly in silence, and Cas feels like he has to reconsider Dean being drunk. He seems pretty fine. When they reach the tube station, Cas turns to him.
“I apologize, I...”
It was when he was trying to pull the rogue piece of shell from the eggs when Dean's voice accompanied the sound of the shower coming from the bathroom. Cas smiled to himself.
“Maybe if I could find a job I wouldn't have the time to look for other outlets.” he snapped. He didn't care how careful Dean wanted him to be, he didn't care that the monsters were still out there, and that he was powerless. He couldn't just be sitting on his ass all day waiting for Dean to come to him. Dean noticed his change of mood. Months of adjusting to their new normal, which included the two of them together, did have results.
“The guy in 401 complained that the elevator is too loud. I told him to come before the check-ins start and we'll give him a different room.” he says and Cas nodds and writes it down on a yellow post-it note. He looks at Dean.
“I checked our train departure time, but...it's not there.” Cas frowns. Their train back to Prague vanishing is the last thing they need. They can't afford to miss the flight back to London either.
“These little flags aren't just for a show.” he says, pointing at his nametag, which proudly displays American and Spanish flags behind his name. “How's your Italian?” he asks then, green eyes fixed on Castiel's chest.
“Jack, please...” he asked quietly, “please...”
“Uh, hey. Can I come in?”
It takes him a just a few minutes into the train ride to pull out his phone and send a message to his best friend, Balthazar.
“Where is he?” he asked, trying to sound calm and menacing, and he sincerely hoped the tremble in his voice is just his imagination. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed Sam watching him like a hawk. The voice in the phone chuckled.
It felt right.
, he thought bitterly, unable to even say it out loud.
He would have completely forgotten about the weird comments Joanna had made when she first mentioned his American colleague, but soon he finds himself strangely drawn to him. Dean is a pleasure to work with, in all honesty. He is charming, very professional, and to Castiel's big surprise, he speaks fluent Spanish.
"Have you told Dean yet?" she asked, probably way too aware of just how much of Dean’s willpower might be needed to pull this off. Sam shook his head.
he scoffed at himself.
Before Sam could process the implications and the weight of what Dean has just shared with him, his brother turned to him, tears streaming down his face. Yet he looked more alive than he had in past weeks.
„Let’s go over this again. I’ll cast the spell, opening the portal. Then I‘ll go through, using whatever holds Cas‘ connection as a guide to find him. Once I do, all he has to do is give up his grace, and then we can summon the portal to get back.“ Sam summarized the plan to Eileen, who nodded nervously. She had voiced her concerns to him the night before, saying that they needed Dean’s help. Sam knew that, too. But he owed it to Cas to try, with or without his brother. He walked over to the table to check all the ingredients, almost a mechanical motion.
“Cas, are you okay? Where are you?” he blurted as he picked up. However, it wasn't Cas's voice that answered.
“Goodnight.” he replies and slowly pulls away, looking straight into Dean's eyes. He's smiling and Cas returns the smile before breaking the eye contact and walking away.
"Dean, we have to know. Cas was my friend too. Please."
Sam sighed. There was no reasoning with worried Dean. And to be honest, he was starting to get worried too. Castiel was supposed to be home twenty minutes ago.
He was taking the trash out when he noticed a dirty van standing in front of the store, with a surprisingly well-dressed man lurking in front of it. That certainly didn't look like their usual trucker customer. It was weird, if not suspicious. He was suddenly interrupted from his thoughts by a soft chime of his phone. He shot one last look in the stranger's direction and headed inside, checking the message from Dean.
They don't drink much. Or rather, Cas doesn't, but then again, he never does. The drink he keep s ordering is mostly coke and just a tiny drop of rum.
“You need to change in Regensburg.” she says and leaves. Cas turns to Dean, who's looking definitely more than pissed.
“German trains, man, German trains...” Dean complains dejectedly and sits on the bench. Cas glances at the departure table and locates their train.
Cas was there, leaning against the driver's door and staring in the distance. Dean approached him and hoped, he prayed that Cas wasn't crying because he wouldn't know at all how to deal with that. But when he came close , he had to remind himself that not only he, but also Cas was grown...angel-turned man. He didn't cry. He just looked...saddly resigned. And that was maybe even worse. Dean felt his throat tightening.
“Yeah. Our hotel campus is there and you're due for Sales and Rep training.” she says, handing him a brochure. Cas quickly glances at it.
Turns out, Becky, the front office supervisor, is all for customer service. She happily chats with guests during check-ins or as she works the bar until the bartendeer arrives, and in the meantime teaches Castiel all about the duties of a front office agent. Greet, check-in, take payment,
The train that arrives to take them to Munich is a definite downgrade from the one they were forced to abbandon. It's old, the air conditioning is substituted by open windows, and it's packed. When they finally manage to squeeze themselves into one of the compartments, they are both drenched in sweat. Cas tries to force his damp hair away from his face as he sinks into the old, cracked faux leather seat with a disgusting, wet sound. Dean does the same and grimaces at him.
"I know."
“You think Sam will like it?”
Dean tore his eyes away from the weird arrangement of cacti on the shelf above Cas's bed, complete with colorful pots, and turned around, looking directly into Cas's blue eyes. He quickly lowered his gaze, only to end up staring at his lips.
“Hello Dean. Did you sleep well?”
“I've never...never asked for anything. But I'm asking now. Bring him back.” continued Cas, but no matter how much he obviously tried, his voice was shaking. Sam wanted to join him. To say something, to do something. But somehow, deep down, he knew he couldn't.
“Of course. Thank you, Dean.”
“What?” Cas looks quizically at the phone screen, but it's all in German. Dean sighs.
“He's not picking up.” Dean said, nervously pacing in the smal area his living room offered. He had been trying to reach Castiel for the past twenty minutes, but without success. Sam was started to look worried, too.
“Do you know the way?” he asked. Cas nodded.
“Good point.” agreed Sam, stuffing his hands in his jacket's pockets.
“Dean, I don't expect anything from you.”
“Thank you.”
“I'm fine..” he rasped, obviously not completely fine, the bloody nose and difficulty keeping head up being a testament to that. And Dean knew that, he tensed and the only reason why he didn't immediately head over to him was Tamiel and his angel blade. Dean pulled out his own.
“Sammy...” he heard Dean rasp suddenly, his hand weakly grabbing pushing down the phone Sam was holding.
It had been a month. A month since they won. A month since Cas died. A month since Dean lost.
“Do you think we'll make it back for the party tomorrow?” he asks, half joking. It works and Dean chuckles.
Sam grinned over his salad.
Dean immediately dived into the food while Cas finished his now cold cup of coffee and read the news.
“I ain't telling you jack shit until he's free to go.”
“Hello Dean. You seem to get up earlier and earlier too.”
“Do you like it?” asked Cas, handing him the cooler with beer. Dean nodded. He did like it.
Was this one of Cas‘ bad memories? Meeting Dean? Did he actually regret meeting him? Dean felt sick, he felt every inch of his body fighting nausea.
Cas took a deep breath. “I've been in this world for a long time, longer than I remember. And yet, I only started living when I pulled you out of Hell...” he said fondly, still looking at Dean like he was the centre of his universe. “And now, human, I don't have much time left. Death will come to reap me, sooner or later, as it does all living things...” he continued, as if he was narrating a story. Dean watched him intently.
The funny thing is that their similar shirts do not go unnoticed by their training mates from other hotels. It's only in the very evening of the first day, when they go for drinks wih the group, that a delicate girl from France broughts it up.
“He went to change, I guess. We got him some new stuff.”
He was crying. He was hurting.
“Alright. Yell if you need me.” he says before retreating to the small kitchen to get his lunch and hears Dean's joking “I will.”
"Yes, Charlie, I know it’s all too soon, but-" Sam stopped short of finishing the sentence as he registered Dean walking into the bunker kitchen. Or rather, stumbling.
“I'm not. I'm just a man, old, broken, bitter. You are...were an angel. You gave up so much for me, and for Sam, and I...I can't ask you to give up what little you have left for me. I don't know what you're expecting but I can't give it to you...” he admitted, still not willing to look him in the eyes. Cas stayed quiet for a long time before speaking up.
“Hey, no worries, it's still quiet.”
He eats his salad untinterrupted, chatting with Charlie, and when he returns to the front, Dean is filling in the registration forms into the system.
“So we're flying to Prague, and then to Munich?” Dean rolls his eyes. Cas recalls that he hates flying and does feel sorry for him for having to endure not one, but two flights in a single day. Jo shakes her head.
"You mentioned a thread…to find him." He said, running his hand along the bloody marks. The last of Cas he had. It was kind of poetic, really, seeing as their first meeting left Dean with a handprint-shaped scar on his shoulder. He looked at Sam and Eileen. Everyone must have shared the thought.
“Uh...” he heard Cas say and tried to remember what was the question.
Sarah calls the
“Don't forget the bacon.” he said and sat down at their table. Cas shot him a look.
The second morning shift goes great and Cas even gets a tip from a nice elderly couple for recommending a good pub nearby. As he listens to his security studies lecture in the afternoon, he finds himself almost dozing off and even though he's nervous about having his first afternoon shift the next day, he's also looking forward to not having to get up at five in the morning.
But Cas didn't seem to mind. He looked content, happy even.
“But Dean, we might be the closest...”
"Wherever the road takes us."
Cas shrugged, his eyes squinting against the sparkly surface of the lake. And just like that, the tension melted in the warm morning sun.
“Sam?” he called.
“I'm with Dean on this one. It was terrible.” Cas agrees and swirls the ice in his empty glass. The laser game was a lot of fun, and Cas managed to be among the top hitters, and now they are all at the bar and Dean and Cas are briefing the rest of the team on their Purgatory journey.
“Do you think something happened today? Between them?"
“You've planned this for me. This trip, this lake, the fishing...” he said quietly, heat rising to his cheeks.
“Right, so..I'll go get my four hours and I'll see you at noon.” he says, grabbing a key card next to the center panel. Cas raises his eyebrow.
. He saw something as a disappointment flicker in Cas's eyes.
"Cas, I gotta tell you something…" he started. How many times had he imagined this conversation? How many times had he wished for it to happen back then in Purgatory or in the room 7B? Damn too many, too many tears and too many sleepless nights drowned in booze. But that had been in the past.
“That's the thing.  This is what happens when you deal with monsters. Now matter how good you are, no matter how careful, you will make that one mistake someday and it's gonna cost you. That's how it is.” he said, finally opening up. Cas looked him in the eyes.
Cas can't sleep, for some reason. He keep rolling and turning, from back to side and back, and just after an unspecified amount of time, as he finally feels himself falling asleep, he allows his mind to drift to the one topic he has been avoiding.
It was quiet.
“Yeah, well, happy to help.” he says and then leaves to get his rest. Cas watches the lift door close, He makes a few cappuccinos and a decent looking latte for a chatty Italian lady and by the time the reception gets busy with selling breakfast and guests checking out, Charlie comes to help. The time flies by and he's in the luggage room hauling a heavy black suitcase up to the shelf when he hears Dean's voice.
And Dean listened, offering him a content smile.
Dean blinked, surprised.
“Relax. It barely walked by anything resembling rum. Just as you like it..” Dean winks at him and Cas certainly does not feel his heart flutter. He does
Castiel’s old trench coat. Sam thought Cas had gotten rid of it when he got the new one, but that obviously wasn’t the case. It had been there the whole time.
Dean frowned at him, annoyed, and yet worry was etched deep into the stare.
He looks at him, brows furrowed in confusion. Dean breaks the eye contact.
He remembered how Dean demanded that Chuck would bring all the people back, that he would bring Cas back, bargaining their own lives. He remembered the way he looked when he saw Cas‘ name on his phone, and the disappointment, the resignation when it turned out to be Lucifer.
“Dinner?” he asked and Sam nodded, setting the bag on the table and pulling out burgers and fries from Dean's favourite diner. Dean looked around, noting the absence of one of the sources of his recent unrest.
“Can I drive?”
“I..uh..what lake? I mean, what lake you wanna visit?” he managed to ask. Cas looked at him a bit nervously.
“It suits you. The colour, I mean.” added Dean, not really knowing where he was heading.
"I’m leaving and you can’t hold me here." he repeated. The Empty furrowed its eyebrows, scowling at them.
"There isn’t! Cas is gone! He’s dead and he’s not coming back!" Dean snapped. But Sam wasn’t having it.
“Right, but still, we quit.”
“How long?” asks Cas, trying to recall the map of central Europe.
“I am older than you, you do realize that?” he asks, but it's not accusing, rather amused. And that's what Cas feels, definitely.
“Yeah, I thought so too. So tomorrow, you'll come with me, and she'll stop by and you can ...you know, discuss it.” Dean continued and looked at him.“So? You're in?”
But there was a river, and a forest, and it felt sinister. Dean felt all his senses heighten, he felt alarmed. He felt pure.
"And I’ll do it, with or without you." he added and left the garage, leaving Dean to face his own decision.
“I'm not your personal cook, Dean.” he said, although he didn't mind taking care of Dean. He placed the scrambled eggs in front of Dean and sat down with his own plate.
"Wouldn’t that be what Cas wanted for you?" he asked. This time Dean truly glared at him, his mouth twitching slightly. It was working.
"Yeah Dean, just go away. Hide in your room and cry, if that’s all you can give Cas in return!" he said firmly and saw Dean freeze in his tracks.
So they stopped at a small family-owned breakfast joint. Dean ordered eggs and Cas opted for pancakes. He did have quite the sweet tooth since he became wingless, Dean noted.The food was delicious and both men ended up contenly smiling at each other and mindlessly chatting about weather, about Sam and Eileen, about the food. It felt nice. It felt like something Dean could've gotten used to, he realized as he watched Cas chatting with the waitress, not really listening to what they were talking about. Until they suddenly weren't talking.
He sighed and started to put away the groceries. With Eileen away to pack up her stuff to move out from her appartment, and Sam and Cas gone, the bunker was way too quiet. Quiet meant Dean was alone with his thoughts and he usually did not like that. His inner voice was sometimes worse than Sam's constatnt nabbing about whatever it was that was going on between him and Cas.
. And he couldn’t do anything but relive it again and again.
and he felt it.
Dean, on the other hand, keeps up with their rather rowdy colleagues, but he can certainly hold his liquor. And eye contact. Some other people join them and Cas and Dean end up pressed side by side on one of the couches. And despite their closeness, he actually finds Dean looking at him very often.
“Dean, listen...” he said when an article caught his attention. “Three dead in Hellen's bridge. Hearts missing.”
“Not exactly. With the situation in Munich, you'll be flying to Prague and then you'll take the train to Munich.”
Cas looked up from the crossword he was battling for the last half an hour.
Then he heard a knock. He sighed, slowly got up, feeling the stiffness of his entire being make itself known in his joints, and he slowly opened the door.
"Jack is basically a God now. I’m sure he can help. There has to be something we can-"
Tamiel grinned.
“Dean?”
. Castiel feels better with every check-in he makes, he can do this. He might sometimes feel as if on a different wave than other people, a bit awkward, but if he can do this, then he can do anything.
Arrival time: –
“I swear I hate German trains.” Dean grunts when they find empty seats and Cas ungracefully sinks into it, nodding. “Agreed.”
“Dean! What happened?” he asked, his eyes looming over the terrifying amount of blood staining Cas's chest and Dean's back. Cas opened his mouth, words stuck in his throat. He pulled Dean closer.
“I mean that this won’t work,” Rowena says, eyeing him sharply. Dean’s face falls.
Oh. This was a different question. More so closer to the truth. Castiel wasn’t here
Sam raised an eyebrow. “You two gonna sit in the back?”
“Don’t care,” Dean mumbled against his neck. He kissed up to Castiel’s jaw, then trailed downwards.
Witch hunting. Dean’s favorite. The three made their way out the door.
lot more,” Dean said.
Dean’s face flushed. “Okay. So surely there’s another cure than that, right?”
"Come on, man, you gotta get out of here. Do something. Live a little." Dean shot him a look bordering on a glare.
“Why don't you take Cas with you? He could finally get some decent clothes for himself...” suggested Sam, hoping that his brother would finally do something about all of this ridiculous avoidance.
“Cas, do you have a minute?” Jo asks. It's middle of May and Cas is grateful that the cardigan hides the sweat circles accentuated by the terrible beige shirt he has grown to hate with passion. The air conditioning couldn't compensate for the unusually hot London spring of that year. He looks at his manager and nodds, signaling to Ash to watch over the reception as he goes to the back office. Jo turns in her chair to face him.
Sam felt his own throat clench as he watched that sad pietà, his own immense sadness washing over him, stones settling in his stomach. He looked up. It couldn't end like that.
“Relationship advice, obviously.” he said and the other angel laughed. Cas wasn't well versed in sarcasm, but he was sure that was one. He could hear his phone ringing in the back office.
Cas watched him, aching inside for seeing how much uncertainty Dean was facing After all that they'd been through, after everything they'd sacrificed, he still wasn't at peace. He squeezed his hand.
“So, this will be your locker. Make sure to not lose the key, only manager has spares.“
Dean nodded, a tiniest movement of his head, and turned his eyes to Tamiel and Asbeel.
He felt the pain shoot through his jaw and cheek and took a step back to steady himself, looking over to Dean. His brother was shaking slightly, his breathing seemed to be a little too quick and shallow, his eyes red and glassy.
Dean had beautiful singing voice, even if his repertoire wasn't exactly up to Cas's taste. He would always enjoy listening to him.
“Cas?” he called out, stepping inside, Sam right behind him. No answer. He walked towards the back office, carefully looking around. It looked deserted.
“Did we? Last time I checked, they got me earlier. If it weren't for Jack-”
Suddenly, rumbling noises echoed through the barn’s walls and roof. And while Dean remembered being on edge back then, this time, he could hear it.
It wasn't until later that he realized he never actually saw the stranger come in to the store. He tried to ignore the cold feeling seeping in his gut, arguing that he was unreasonably suspicious of a complete stranger who had happened to pass by. No reason to panic, he repeated to himself and glanced at the clock. Only fifteen minutes left to closing time. Then he could go home, where Dean was. And Sam and Eileen too, it was the first day of their visit. Only thirteen minutes.
“Kansas. Sweet.”
“You do? Or Dean does?”
“Sure.” he said and handed Cas the keys, their hands touching maybe for a milisecond longer than needed. Cas grinned and got behind the wheel and Dean briefly wondered what he had gotten himself into.
"Yes, you can. We have a portal that humans can pass through. It won’t last long, so we have to move." he explained, looking straight into his eyes as he handed him a small glass bottle. Cas blinked.
Dean placed his beer down on the table and licked his lips, his eyes darting over to Cas for a fraction of a moment. "I'm tired, Sam. And like you said, it's different now. You, other hunters, you guys don't need me anymore."
Sam nodded.
“You think I don't know that?” Cas suddenly snapped and Dean looked at him, surprised. Cas seemed angry. “You think it's not confusing for me?! I was an angel, Dean. I wasn't made to feel things! But I'm human now and I feel so much and I have to deal with that, and on top of that I have to deal with you being scared of the whatever the relationship between us is!” he errupted. Dean was stunned and Cas was frowning, staring right into him.
The angel shrugged while Asbeel kept an eye on Sam.
“That's not true.” he said, looking him in the eyes. But Dean looked down on his hands and sighed.
“I'm sure he will.”
The train is not bad, it has wifi and air conditioning and they comfortably settle in their seats. That lasts about two hours as the train stops just after passing the Czech-German border. The town is called Schwandorf and Cas will never forget the name.
Cas nodds and quickly goes to the locker room to change. When he returns to the lobby again, Dean is leaning against the wall, the glass one that they need to constatnly polish, and plays with his phone, amused.
Dean sighed and joined him, leaning against the car.
“One Cuba Libre...” Dean says and sits next to him.
"Nobody dies happy, Sam." He muttered and when he raised his eyes, Sam noticed the distinct glassy look. He wanted to press more. He had to. Dean had to talk about it.
Cas nodded and stepped towards the barn door, but then another voice ripped through the static in the air.
“Maybe. What are you doing in London, anyway? I mean, you're...”
“I might've found you a job.”
The night they’ve met.
“How can I help you?”
“Yes.” said Cas quickly and stepped to the side. Dean walked in and realized he hadn't been in Cas's room since...since he came back, actually. He looked around and didn't even notice Cas shutting the door behind him and looking at him expectantly.
“Just joking. He has a boyfriend anyway. Benny is a nice guy, but honestly Dean could do better. You two would be great together.”she shruggs and goes to steam the milk for her cappuccino and Cas returns to counting the money.
“I know.” Dean rumagged through the duffel, checking that all the important stuff was there.
“I thought that if I told you directly that I wanted to take you fishing like this, you'd feel...cornered. Pushed.” he admitted carefully. Dean took a moment to process what exactly Castiel meant.
"So you were serious about that, huh?" Sam turned to Dean, who just walked through the door. At least he seemed steady on his feet. Sam was glad to see him, because it could only mean one thing.
“Jack, please...” begged Cas,” he... I can't..”
“Cas..!”
"I know. And there is a price to pay." he said. "Since humans can’t pass through and the Empty can't hold human souls.. " he started explaining, but Dean already knew where he was heading.
Sam swallowed and let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He dared to look through the tiny door opening. The room was a mess, full of empty bottles, dark, suffocating, the only source of light being a single lamp on the nightstand. Dean was sitting on the floor, propped against his bed, head dropped in his hands, shoulders shaking. A cracked whiskey bottle laid next to him, its contents spilled. Sam was torn. Part of him wanted to go in, to comfort his brother, to hold him and make him feel better. But he knew Dean would hate that. He hated showing his feelings, he hated being seen vulnerable. With a heavy heart, Sam turned his gaze away and silently went to bed.
Cas wonders what the problem is, but he's certainly not going to ask, so even when Dean hangs up, he just quietly munches on his Snickers. Dean stays quiet for a moment, and then sighs.
"Good morning.. " came a grumpy greeting from behind them. Sam turned to see Dean coming in, wearing the same shirt he had been for past three days, his unshaven face making him look older than he was. Sam waited for Dean to sit with them and take another sip from his beer before clearing his throat. Beer was better than whiskey, at least.
Cas solemnly nods. It was. Except for the last train ride to Prague. He fondly remembers the quiet conversation on the dark train, the gossip about colleagues, about their families, about Benny...
“Munich?”
Dean patted his shoulder and went to change from his work clothes. Cas was about to go and ask him if he wanted to order pizza for dinner when he heard Dean's phone ringing. It was on the kitchen counter and Cas looked at it.
“Like a baby.”
“What do you mean?”
“He said he was gonna leave as soon as possible.”
“I'll ask around if there are any openings...” he promised and Cas gave him a small smile. Steps like these were all it took to reach destination, after all.
They talked about it with Sam one evening, watching Indiana Jones with Cas passed out and snoring quietly on the couch, his features soft and peaceful in the dim light of the televison.
“Was it really that bad?”
The thought that Dean thinks he looks good, however, doesn't leave his head for the entire morning session of the training. He doesn't get complimented often. And he doesn't tell Dean that the colour suits him, too.
“Why didn't you just tell me from the start?” he asked, even if deep down, he knew the answer. Because he knew himself.
“Right...” he said, still staring into Cas's eyes. He felt like he should
“It's awesome. Burgers are always awesome.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
Dean took a yet another swig out of his beer as if he could drown himself in it to escape the awkward conversation. Then he noticed the ketchup in the corner of Cas' lips.
“And you're telling me this now?” he asks and looks around to see if he can take it off without any guests spotting him. Dean chuckles.
"Cas said…" he started with trembling voice and took a sip of beer, although Sam could have sworn the bottle must have been empty by now. He didn’t push. He knew the barrier had been broken.
