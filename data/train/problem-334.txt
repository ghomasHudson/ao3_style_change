Rosethorne – he’d raised an eyebrow at the name when he’d first read his orders. It wasn’t exactly a welcoming name in an area that boasted the kind of raw, natural beauty that made a person believe in a nameless, faceless God.
The smile, however, as much as it seemed to reassure Mrs. Hudson, did not seem to work on Mycroft Holmes.
“Sherlock,” whispered Mrs. Hudson, with obvious fondness. “He’s looking better, Dr. Watson. His colour is coming back. It won’t be too much longer, now, will it?”
“Mute? Lestrade?”
“No! The name!”
“You thought I would help ground you? After you read my files?” John leaned against the wall beside the door, curious, feigning indignance. He really needn’t bother. He knew Sherlock wasn’t likely to be fooled.
“I never had one as a boy,” John countered with an exaggerated sigh. “And ‘sides, we can be whoever we want to be in that garden.”
John swiveled his head around. Lestrade
Mrs. Hudson smiled indulgently. “You’ve missed us,” she said. “Haven’t you, Sherlock?”
“Why make it look like a kidnapping?”
Slowly, the music he makes turns from melancholic to joyful, exultant. The chaos, the discord inside, is swallowed by the voice of the violin and emancipated by the look on John’s face.
Mycroft wasn’t missed at Rosethorne, but Sherlock’s absence was an emptiness John could never fill, no matter that his patient load suddenly doubled, with three more convalescents arriving just hours after Sherlock left. The level of care each needed was slightly higher than the existing and previous patients. There was an aging colonel with painful diabetic nerve damage and the threat of gangrene, and two young soldiers, burned and broken, so depressed they were considered suicide risks and sent to Rosethorne, they were told, to take the country air and take their time healing under John and Molly’s practical care.
The door was closed when he reached it, and he rapped lightly, pushing it open even as he did so.
Before his first week was done, he’d taken to spending his afternoons out-of-doors, walking the paths in the gardens closest to the house. They’d been stately once, and evidence of a former grandeur could be found at nearly every turn. Marble benches and statuary grown over with vines, grass creeping over the edges of the stone paths and growing up in the crevices, fountains and pools filled with leaves and debris. Not willful neglect, John thought, but evidence of attention focused elsewhere. Of gardeners and groundskeepers gone off to war, of resources redirected.
“Several. Approximately three inches long. Bottom of the cage. The cage, might I add, that is at least five times the size of a budgie cage. Really, John, your observation skills….”
“And this - this consideration. Of my character.” John stressed the last work, surveying the board, affecting an air of casual observation that he certainly didn’t feel. “You think I wouldn’t sleep while my wife played near the water.”
“They’ve put him in Al’s old room. I’m so very glad he’s back – he’s had a long journey, hasn’t he?”
“What? Don’t surprise you when you’re obviously trying to escape down the tunnel without me?” Sherlock accused with a gleam in his eye.
“He can be difficult,” Mrs. Hudson said. She bit her bottom lip and let her gaze move over to Sherlock again. “He doesn’t like – well, he
John smiled as he maneuvered the wheelchair out the door, correcting its direction with his hip as it veered toward the wall with Sherlock's weight and his weak left side. He had a good feeling about the outing.
“Musicians are artists as well,” Sherlock insisted. “As are writers. Perhaps you have a story to tell.”
“You said you were making progress – you mentioned – restructuring?” Major Sholto had shuffled the papers before him, clearly checking notes he had made over the course of the meeting.
of you?”
“Sentimentality is part of what makes us human. And if we lose our humanity in trying to
“Go on,” he urged. “Tell me about your injury.”
him – to discuss the next steps.
John didn’t comment on the implied pun, eating crow indeed. But Sherlock grinned nonetheless at his own cleverness. The bird in question seemed to have tired of watching them, or perhaps was frightened off by all the talk of stones and pies. It flew off with a loud squawk, and John watched as another bird fluttered in to take its place on the branch. It was a robin, however, and could not be mistaken for the crow that had just departed.
Sherlock considered, apparently running several scenarios through his head. “Right. The boyfriend. Did he mention he has one?”
It occurred to him a second that
The woman’s eyes widened. “Oh, my apologies, Mr. Potter. I’d forgotten.”
” Sherlock sighed and blew out a frustrated breath. “It’s distracting me from my goal – yes. But at the same time, it’s giving me ideas. A mystery to solve that seems even more pressing, John. I know you can’t see it. You have no idea what I’m on about. But each and every one of these transmissions has clues – insights into the enemy’s mind. Taken singularly, they offer nothing but snippets, like random lines pulled from a Shakespearean tragedy. No context, save a character name or familiar place. But then imagine you’re given a dozen lines pulled from Shakespeare’s entire works, then a dozen more, then a dozen again and again. Even if you’re not familiar with his opus, you’ll start to see patterns, clues both obvious and hidden. And you’d be caught up in it, wouldn’t you? Sorting out Romeo and Juliet from Hamlet from Richard III. You’d want to know what comes next, even though you might not have all the pieces of what actually came before. And there are clues – so many clues. That’s how great tragedies work out, you see. The end is always the same – but the path to that end can have a million different variables. And every choice – every one, deliberate and accidental – affects that path. It’s course, it’s length, the number of forks and turns and dead ends.” He swept his hand out to indicate the old hedge maze that Lestrade had begun to transform into a thing of wonder. “Like a maze, John. Do you see?”
“It’s Al,” Rose assured him. “He was feinting – look – Harry’s after the Snitch now.”
“Oh?” John pressed a kiss onto Sherlock’s lips, dropping Sherlock’s hand and grazing his over Sherlock’s thigh and up across his groin. He rested it there. “I finally found the perfect way to exercise it,” he said, squeezing lightly.
John smiled. “Yeah. It is.”
schedule and whether Hamish is a wizard or not is one of them. Give it a few more years and just enjoy him as he is – right?”
“Lestrade – breathe.”
“It’s whatever we want it to be,” John insisted.
“It’s Sherlock’s skull and we have it because he talks to it when no one else will because some of us actually like to sleep. Yes, it is rather macabre. And as for the wall - that would be Sherlock too,” John answered, whipping his head around to stare at their bedroom door a second later when he heard the unmistakable sound of Apparition.
He could have stayed like that forever, world and war be damned, but Sherlock pressed a kiss onto his neck, brushed off his trousers, a futile but automatic gesture, then walked carefully to the window, hand trailing the wall and leaving a dusty cloud in its wake. He stood there, fragile curtain pushed to the side, supporting himself with both hands on the windowsill, studying the wall beyond, and John stayed where he was, watching Sherlock.
going. Rosie is going.” He rested a hand on the arm of the sofa for support and dug beside the cushion until he located Sherlock’s mobile. He unlocked it without explaining how he knew the pin and rang up Mycroft, turning on the device’s speaker as he settled back into his chair with a groan.
It might be your front door, or the door to the loo, or to your bedroom. It doesn’t seem to matter where in the flat you are – they always find the closest door to intrude on your privacy. And even though the intrusions last only a matter of seconds most times, they’re disruptive, and inconvenient, but most of all they make you question your own sanity.
“And it was she who first said you should be a surgeon. She’d watch your fingers on the keys, perhaps she even held your hands in her own, and said that you had such fine, strong, steady hands. The hands of a surgeon.”
“You’re not at all what I would have expected,” John chanced. “And since you’re obviously not inclined to do what your body is demanding, and I’m awake anyway, why don’t you tell me about your….”
“Irene?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes, then shook his head slowly. “Not my type, John. Nor am I hers. But she had the most marvelous toys – a gorgeous combination of hard and soft – leather and fur, polished wood and feathers. The most intricate leather and whalebone corset. A brassiere made of nothing but metal rings and velvet straps….”
Mycroft’s hands were flat on the polished wood before him. He raised one, and made as if to pound it on the table, but stopped himself with great effort, and slowly lowered it again.
“It’s locked,” he said as he caught up with her.
He’d only taken a few steps toward the tent when James appeared.
“But you meant to go.” He glanced at John’s khaki’s – he only ever wore that pair to work. “You would have said something last night.”
“Well done, Dr. Watson. You’ll be performing brain surgery in no time.”
Let it go.
“Impossible.” Mycroft folded his hands on the desk and looked thoughtfully at his brother. “Curious that you don’t want to leave here. You’ve always hated the country. You seemed to thrive in London. Yet – here you stand. Blackmailing me out of my ancestral home.”
Sherlock frowned. “Well yes – that. But Bogsworth, John! He’s going to Bogsworth! And do you know what that means?”
Swim shorts – three sets.
“Pleasantries?” John was clearly amused. “What sort of pleasantries?”
“I’d take you on a walk-about and send you over the white cliffs of Dover.” Sherlock pressed his toes into John’s thigh. “You’d land on a sunbathing mermaid and ride with her to the bottom of the sea.”
“You’re quite big,” Mycroft said, glancing back at Sherlock, who glowered at him. “Bigger than him by far.”
He's stuck in a holding pattern – charting everything but unable to make any reasonable conclusions, when one day, it happens to him.
Sherlock puts his hand on the doorknob, pauses to look at John, then pulls open the door to be greeted with exactly what one might expect – a rather posh loo.
“Something like that,” John said, not acknowledging how close Sherlock’s guess was. “And something about needing some emergency medical supplies down here, and better chairs, and a bed or at least a sofa so you can rest if you do have one. And something to eat - snacks or fruit or even those shortbread biscuits you….”
“They need something more to do,” she said, referring to two of the new patients. “They’re withering up like this. They need to believe they’re useful still– that their lives have a purpose."
“Hamstead,” Sherlock supplied.
“I saw him up at the cottage when I got cleaned up,” Sherlock volunteered. He elbowed John when John began to protest that he hadn’t in fact managed to clean himself up.
And despite the fact that he’d lived a number of years now out in the open, as a soldier, an army doctor, a widower, the secrets from the past still influenced his everyday behavior.
Mrs. Hudson had seemed ready, at last, to leave. But now she turned to him and half-whispered. “The staff assumes he’s old Mr. Holmes – still hanging on,” she said, hesitating.
John rolled out of bed and stumbled over to the dressing chair, where he picked up his own dressing gown and shrugged into it.
“His powers to break eardrums while he charms old ladies?” John smiled and held out his arms. Hamish obligingly leaned forward and held his own arms out to John.
They’re not ghosts from the past, though. Their dress is quite modern, and definitely western, and if they utter a word, it’s usually in a language he understands. He’s learned to be a very quick study – rapid observation, immediate deductions.  Cab driver, delivery man, cellist, serial murderer – that one was quite a surprise. But all of them – one and all – surprised to find themselves in his flat. They always close the door and disappear, and when he opens the door himself, the expected room or corridor is always just outside it.
, that John immediately looked up, suspicious.
He let out a huff of air, deflecting a moment for time. “That came out of the blue. I was expecting you to ask my favourite colour, or whether I prefer a soft or a firm mattress.”
The cook had Thursdays off, which meant crusty bread and simple stews she’d concocted with the week’s leftover meats and vegetables. They were good, and wholesome, but not the sort of foof that drew everyone to the dining room by their noses. While John seldom missed a meal, he had taken off a time or two on Thursday, so targeted that day for the launch of his great campaign.
And it obviously wasn’t all coming from Mycroft.
Severus raised an eyebrow. “Your husband’s mind intrigues me. When this excitement is over, perhaps I could work with him with his magical dyslexia – to explore some…possibilities.”
“Oh.” Sherlock’s eyes drifted up to the treehouse, then back to John. “Is that what I did, then?”
In John’s months here at Rosethorne, he’d come to regard Lestrade as something of a social recluse, going about his business as quietly as possible, blending into the background with hunched shoulders and downcast eyes. John had thought him a broken man, a man with a traumatic story of his own, perhaps sent here to Rosethorne because he couldn’t be helped in London.  It was all too easy, given the fact that he didn’t speak and avoided social interactions, to regard him as a simpleton, a simple man given simple tasks and existing only in one’s peripheral vision.
ooOOOOoo
It’s Friday, he’s had a taxing week at the A&E, and Rosie has already gone to Molly’s to mind the boys for the evening.
At that exact moment, footsteps on the stairs announced the arrival of Rosie and Al, who’d gone out to do some Christmas shopping in London.
John and Harry had quickly tumbled out of the plane behind their respective mates, Harry with his wand in his hand.
“Sadly, no,” Sherlock said with an easy shrug. He made his way over to stand beside John. He was not standing too close, no closer than their previous familiarity allowed, but his presence seemed to have a magnetic pull that hadn’t been there before, and John found himself leaning closer and rubbing shoulders as Sherlock bent forward and examined the exposed nails, the nearly-consumed ladder rungs. “Go on, then. What else do you see?”
“She’s – well, I think she’s lonely.” The words fell between them, a bit awkward. “She’s looking for something – for someone. I should tell you that now, in case – well, in case you’re interested. I’m not, and I think she knows that now. I was rather hoping you’d be…interested.”
“Al shouldn’t…” he began, something inside him immediately balking at the idea of bringing anyone else – strangers, outsiders - to their garden.
“Alright – um – that’s a hard no to the Amazon and Madagascar. And won’t you have to childproof the flat no matter?” asked Al. He glanced over at Rosie with alarm, as if suddenly realising that 221B was not child friendly.
He doesn’t hesitate and is at Sherlock’s side in seconds, not caring that the door swings shut behind him. He practically carries him back to the door, praying the prayer of the unbeliever as he reaches for the handle and inches it open.
“I’m ready to go.”
Sherlock gave the child in question a little jiggle as the dummy in his mouth stopped moving and his face began to crinkle up.
“Common wizarding name,” John said, trying to cover for whatever they’d just inadvertently uncovered.
in….”
Clean and bright yet full of the kind of clutter that made a place look lived in. A navy blue cardigan draped on the back of a chair. Stethoscope and blood pressure cuff hung on a wall hook beside the door. An array of papers and files and pamphlets and books. A few well-tended house plants. There was nothing feminine at all about the room yet John knew immediately that this was a woman’s office. Perhaps the tea service – floral with gold edging – gave it away, but he thought not. It was more a feeling, something to do with the order of things.
Sherlock’s face took on an intensity John found uncomfortable. It was almost the look of a cat who’d cornered the mouse. When he spoke, his voice was low, and calm, almost matter of fact.
But as he hurried back to the manor house, his thoughts were only on Sherlock.
“Number six,” he said as he made himself comfortable. “Stuffing your ashes in the pockets of my coat and wading into the Themes.”
“Speaking of Mycroft, he said Sherlock was being difficult. He doesn’t look difficult to me. He looks practically drugged.”
They stare at each other in the corridor while the door snicks shut behind them.
“But we’re doing the locked room scenario today,” Sherlock protested. “The students have been looking forward to it for weeks now, and I need you to be one of the bodies. It isn’t much fun for them if I make them lie on the floor for the entire class period.”
“I’ve already mapped out an escape route. Shall I post it on the wall by the door?” He sounded just condescending enough to raise John’s hackles.
“There you are at last.” The woman who opened the door looked past John and addressed the chauffeur. “Simon – Mr. Holmes would like you to take Dr. Watson’s bags to the Westminster Suite in the west wing.” She stepped back as Simon dutifully headed off with the suitcases, then her gaze rested at last on John.
John imagined Sherlock wouldn’t react very well at all to Irene Adler being removed from Rosethorne.
“Nothing. I never encourage sleep and I don’t sleep on schedule. I sleep when I’m too tired to stay awake any longer.”
John laughed. “I know that list already – every single piece of beekeeping gear. Do Rosie.”
But Mycroft’s unexpected arrival, with three uniformed officers soon following, put a quick end to any plans to enjoy the out-of-doors.
“Boring,” responded Sherlock, almost before John had the words out. “Number one is decidedly The Tower Terror.”
“Mycroft is insisting I attend the annual Met soiree.”
“I wasn’t….”
a mother - and I must say she is less maternal than you are acting now. I don’t need another mother - I need - ”
The door to Mycroft’s room was open, and someone was standing there watching him.
She is right, but oh so very wrong.
He didn’t take the bait.
“What happened to your pajamas?” he asked, voice high-pitched and prim, as he marched by Sherlock and stood at the foot of their bed, looking back toward the door. “It’s unsanitary to sleep au naturel. Mummy insists I wear pants under my pajamas, and a dressing gown on top.”
that young couple going at it there.”
He dropped his fist onto the keyboard, tired and frustrated, and winced at the unpleasant, dissonant sound.
“My brother,” Sherlock answered. “When I was six years old. “Until you came around, I’d only ever played with him. He’s highly competitive and I adore beating him. I don’t really like the game, otherwise.”
And while John would recall the odd discussion of his own romantic attachments in this first meeting with Molly, he’d also remember this day for what followed soon after.
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
“A bit – I’ve dissected a few.”
The wind had picked up a bit. He was still over land but was close to the shoreline. What had that friendly but very annoying jump instructor told them about the wind?
John sucked in a breath and let it out slowly. Then another – a breath of courage – and stared at the music before him. His left hand remained in his lap, still warm from Sherlock’s touch.
“Whose idea was it – no. I already know.
He hadn’t shared the secret with anyone, and while he felt an odd reluctance to share it now with Sherlock, he needed a way to lure him outside, to get him away from the dark paneled walls and stacks of tomes and journals.  Doctor’s orders wouldn’t go far at all with Sherlock Holmes.
“He’s a wiz-fit too. They’ve spilled the chutes to open after ten seconds of free-fall. And Al’s uncle is down there – the red-headed one. He’s going to guide us in if we drift out over the channel.”
He’d scanned it quickly then had pushed the phone back toward Mycroft.
“Yes, and afterwards,
John shook his head. “Sorry. I need to do some research. I wouldn’t want to start down the wrong path and have to pull you off of it midway.”
Lestrade shifted uncomfortably and John looked quickly down at what he’d written. One sentence, brief and brutal.
She watched him for a few minutes as he played the simple, familiar melody of
“For Sherlock?” John’s eyebrows shot up into his hairline.
Selfishly, perhaps, he wanted magic for himself as well. He wanted two hands that could coax music from the ivory keys below his leaden fingers. A steady, strong hand to wield a scalpel. Dexterity to pick up small stones from the shore. Strength to toss them far out into the water.
He’d been admitted to Mycroft Holmes’ bedroom suite with Simon’s perfunctory nod as he passed. The master of the house was propped up against a stack of pillows on a high four poster bed. He was wearing a dark green dressing gown, and as he turned his attention to John, he closed a file he’d been reading and placed it on the bed beside him.
“Yes.”
Sherlock was shaking his head. He looked more amused than exasperated.
“Molly – I need you at once!”
would be useless in the operating theater.  He was a doctor for Christ’s sake – he understood what physical therapy could and couldn’t do.
. Knew the thing John could not forget, even though it had died there - the lust, the want, the
Sherlock had stopped pretending to look out the window. John watched, as one might look on helplessly as two trains head for an inevitable collision, as Sherlock turned his head and met Molly’s eyes.
The stack of books at the end of Sherlock’s bed had grown and had spilled over, spawning a second messy stack beside the first. Sheets of paper filled with small, precise writing covered the dresser. But Sherlock left the bedroom behind when Mrs. Hudson arrived with John, leading him into the room behind Wiggins’ and sweeping a stack of newspapers off of the upholstered red chair.
And John kissed him.
Sherlock let several seconds drag by before he turned. He met his brother’s eye coldly. “Go on.”
“Except for me, of course,” John added quickly and as sincerely as he could muster, giving Sherlock’s hand a reassuring squeeze.
“Does it really matter?” Sherlock sounded completely bored at the prospect of the very prestigious award. “I’m not going to the gala and – what?”
“Something of Sherlock’s then,” he murmured.
“One hundred and seventeen,” Sherlock said as Severus adjusted the buttons on his cuff.
“I don’t understand,” he said, not quite achieving the deadly calm in his voice he’d hoped for. “Where’s your righteous indignation? The fire and brimstones for – for – sleeping with another man?” He jerked his head toward the closed door behind him, and the last words came out in a harsh whisper. “Do we get a pass because Sherlock is
“Don’t need to be – needed
“Are you volunteering to be my first patient?”
He had seen his share of addicts and had no reason to doubt Sherlock’s claims. And he had firsthand experience of what an addict might be willing to do to procure another hit.
“It won’t be pretty,” Severus responded. “Ginny Weasley has a reputation for some very … effective … hexes. Her Bat Bogey Hex is world-reknown.”
“Right.” Sherlock agreed. “But….”
“The problem is that he’s a prick.” Sherlock scowled and pulled his knees up against his chest. John was forever incredulous that Sherlock, now almost 68, was still able to get into that position. And that he referred to his 75-year old brother as a prick.
It was utterly ridiculous to waltz in tiny box steps in the earthy stillness of a secret tunnel, counting in his head as the Blue Danube played through his mind. He’d always been no more than an adequate dancer, mind so acutely attuned to the music and his feet and the position of his arms that he was dancing only in the most clinical definition of the term. The woman in his arms was more prop than partner, the entire experience more task than pleasure.
“For you, perhaps. You know about the garden – you remember it from your childhood. But the only reason I know is that I slipped in one day when he’d not closed the gate, and spied on him while he worked. I could have announced myself, but I didn’t. It’s rather – well, awkward – to admit that now.”
“Exactly.” Sherlock looked at him expectantly. “Tell me about the piano.”
He thought he heard something – the tread of a foot, the squeak of the old floors beneath the carpet – but when he turned his head there was nothing, no one, there. Colours danced on the carpet where the sun shone through the streets of London scene, and he followed them to the door.
“This garden - ” Lestrade fought for the words. “This garden is different.” He picked up his hedge clippers then stared at the keys in his hand, seeming to come to a decision. “All right.”
Charlie laughed again, and gave John a friendly grin. “Me? Kids? No – not exactly my area.” He winked, and John smiled.
hand, and I’ll trade information on your new commanding officer for a few well-played notes.”
But this one puzzled him. It was a barred gate set in a long brick wall, too high to climb. He could see through the bars to a crumbling bricked sitting area, and to a child’s swing hanging from the bough of an oak tree just beyond that. The ropes that held the swing to the branch were old and frayed, and the grass beneath the wooden seat was tall and wild. It was a tableau of disuse, of a childhood long forgotten, yet oddly, the padlock on the gate was not rusty, and in the overgrown grass that carpeted the garden, a faint path wove its way into the trees below.
“Am I clear?” asked Mycroft.
He was certainly not in an invalid’s room. The room was both bed chamber and living quarters, and there wasn’t a single item present that would support a case that an actual medical invalid inhabited the quarters – no wheelchair, no appliances to help lift a nonresponsive body, no bed pan, no stacks of diapers. No tell-tale smells of urine and bleach. And there were shoes, of obvious quality and scuffed enough to indicate frequent wear, dropped near the end of the bed.
him. He’d rearranged his entire life here at Rosethorne around the man. He put Sherlock Holmes’ needs before his own, frequently missing dinner to take him outside to the gardens, putting off his own therapy to find ways to force the man to stress his brain less and his body more so that he could figure out how to rebuild the venerated Mind Palace and go back to his job of winning the war for England.
“No,” John said, when Sherlock tried to duck into a ready-to-wear men’s robe shop. “You don’t have the right money.”
John, lips pursed, mind racing, considering a dozen different possibilities, looked up sharply at Lestrade. Of all the startling information in the letter, he couldn’t get past the piece he felt Sherlock had glazed over – his rescue by Lestrade. He carefully folded the letter and ran his fingers over the crease, quietly considering his words before he spoke.
“We’ll wrap his elbow very well, John. I’ll have Mrs. Hudson find one of Sherlock’s long-sleeved shirts. Al’s more or less his size, and we can knot the sleeve past his stump. You know as well or better than anyone that treating these boys like they’re fragile china dolls won’t speed along their recoveries.”
He was annoyed. Irritated. Unreasonably angry that the war and all its attendant demands - its tragedies, its atrocities - was about to intrude on the tiny piece of - of
“Ah – now you’re being romantic,” John said, running a wrinkled finger over the sensitive arch of the same foot.
It started with John asking about the ill-fated tree house, the pirate ship in the sky.
It is.
“Sherlock Holmes has a serious - and possibly permanent - condition. It affects his brain, as all of you already know very well. The brain can’t heal if the body is over-worked, or sleep-deprived, or too stimulated. Working him too hard would be counter-productive.” He couldn’t risk an actual glare in Anderson’s direction, but he looked him in the eye, his face set.
“I’m not uncomfortable,” snapped Molly. “And no – he can’t know those things. But he does. Somehow, /he does.” She gave John her attention now, looking a bit hurt. “Do you really not want children, John?”
Good. Your Mind Palace is gone – blown to shreds. You can’t do The Work anymore.
It's convenient that Sherlock will see Rosie the very next day.  She’s midway through her first year at Cambridge, and if Sherlock hadn’t been presented with the heart-wrenching image the day before of John lifting himself up backward, stair by stair, to 221B, he might not have mentioned John’s injury at all.  But now it’s the only thing on his mind, having supplanted both the case and Rosie.
Scorpius must have nodded.
“Owl pellets?”
“He gave them to me.” Lestrade’s voice was faint, yet defensive. “He told me….” He coughed, cleared his throat. “He told me to work on whatever I could find - anywhere - on the manor grounds.”
John closed his mouth, with great difficulty, mentally removing the kid gloves. If Sherlock wanted to play hard ball, he could give as good as he got.
Sherlock’s story is less true to form.
They were quiet for a long while then, though John reached for Sherlock’s hand and laced their fingers together. He dropped his head back against the wall and waited, gazing at the dusty chandelier above them.
“It was a knock-off,” Sherlock admitted with a matching chuckle.
But John reads it wrong. He
Sometimes, they’d make love in the tunnel, covered by darkness - rough, primal, silent - apart from the world. Sometimes, they’d stretch out together on a blanket in the garden when the moon was new and stars pushed through the canopy of night and flooded their faces with innocence.
“An old gate key,” he said at last. He continued, sounding a bit forced. “When I was a boy, grandfather had an old gardener named Ben. He had an entire ring of keys like this. We could always hear him coming – no matter what mischief we were up to.” He smiled fondly at the memory. “It gave us ample time to escape trouble.”
“I’m trying,” he snapped, regretting it almost immediately as Molly recoiled. But she turned her hand over under his, and interlaced their fingers.
John rolled his eyes but did as Sherlock requested, then slipped the garment on as Sherlock had and did up the buttons.
be designed to work into the tree, and the ones around it. John imagined an organic structure, one that wrapped around the base of the tree and spiraled upward. The tree as the mast of the ship, perhaps, a wide deck built below where they could lie with arms folded behind their heads, listening to the birds, the chatter of the squirrels, or Lestrade working with his clippers.
“No,” John said to himself, remembering Mycroft’s words that day in the garden. He looked up at the raven, still standing guard nearby. “The keeper of the keys? You?”
Sherlock had asked that same question, but John had stepped forward and interrupted before he’d voiced all of his thoughts.
“James – ”
His eyes were closed. His face was pale. He looked utterly exhausted. He was speaking with a cadence which was surely slower than was normal, though still clipped and precise. He’d just suffered through a series of seizures and was alone in his room with a man he’d never before met.
What he knows – what he’s absolutely certain of when he scours his memory banks as he sits on the floor surrounded by baubles and tangled lights and the foul-smelling shrimp they somehow missed the year before – is that time started again on Rosie’s first Christmas, and that her first Christmas was his first Christmas too.
“If you insist on playing that infernal song, do us both a favor and use your other hand.”
Sherlock hesitated, as if considering whether he was, his brain taking a bit of time to process the question. He nodded. “Please.”
“There isn’t enough – hey! – enough alc’ol in the world to make this alright,” John said in a too-loud whisper as he fell back onto Mycroft’s bed. His trousers were undone, his shirt untucked and his shoes were somewhere between the bed and the door.
“John – of course. I was expecting you. Oh – wonderful – you’ve brought play clothes for me. A disguise? Yes – of course.” Sherlock had relieved John of the suit and laid it out on the bed, running his hands over the fabric to smooth it out. As John watched him, surprised yet again, Sherlock studied the clothing, exploring the pockets, the seams, the hem in the trousers.
“He’s had these often enough,” Mrs. Hudson supplied from behind him. She still sounded distraught and John wondered what, exactly, her relationship to this man was. “But the second one – it wouldn’t stop. Went on and on jerking him around like he was a helpless puppet. And Mr. Holmes said….”
It would not be an easy week for John.
And Sherlock was right, of course. Bastard. John crossed his own legs, hoping he exuded the relaxation he didn’t feel. At the very least, he was happy to be dressed in trousers instead of pajamas and dressing gown. His summons had come unexpectedly early this time around and he’d been at his desk completing a report for his superior officer when Mrs. Hudson sought him out.
What use was living?
Well, falling, but he could pretend.
Sherlock removes the mobile, glances at it before thumbing it off again.
“Come on - let’s go.”
to return to his post. The major who’d lost his left eye and his right leg below the knee. The last patient – a woman, much to John’s surprise – whose position with the British government was classified.
“Just get on with it,” John interrupted.
He’d even been in this exact position with Sherlock - rolling him away from the wall, from the bedroom furniture, then backing off, staying close enough to offer help if needed, but keeping out of the way of flailing arms and legs.
He grabbed his mobile and wandered off into the bedroom and John was left thinking that this couldn’t possibly turn out well.
Sherlock is still sleeping at nine o’clock, when Mrs. Hudson comes up with a Christmas morning tea tray, complete with plain biscuits for Rosie and Christmas crackers for all. They eat and drink their fill, but save the crackers for when Sherlock can play along.
John reached out to stop him, but Harry Potter wasn’t the Head of the MLE for no reason at all. He was gone with hardly a whisper of a crack, and John’s finger tips brushed empty air where Harry had stood seconds before.
He closed his eyes, but even with his eyes closed, all he could see was Sherlock Holmes.
This was a Sherlock John didn’t know. A Sherlock who seemed to understand his fellow human being at an emotional level. Who showed compassion. Who was moved by what he saw before him - a work of art in an untried, unusual medium. A shout-out from a voice muted. Lestrade had found a forgotten garden, had claimed it, had found his voice here. And now, now that he’d also found a friend he’d thought forever lost, he was sharing his recovery, taking another solid step out of those tumultuous, voiceless shadows he’d been inhabiting.
“Us? You and your brother, then?” He forced out a chuckle. “I can’t imagine Mycroft breaking rules.”
“When Rosie was born,” said Sherlock at last. “When I dislocated both shoulders trying to get out of the strait jacket. When you needed stitches on your head and they shaved off all the hair on one side of your skull.”
“Stop playing games,” John said angrily. With all the Holmes brothers knew about him, could they possibly
“You’re clever,” she said. “You read between the lines. You - .” She paused, frowning. “What are you doing here, anyway? Why aren’t you in Africa?” She fumbled, realising her slip. “Oh, I may as well tell you. Mrs. Hudson told me Mr. Holmes was bringing in a military doctor. But I expected a fumbling old codger, too old to be of much use in a field hospital. But there you were this morning – all polite and lovely and certainly capable - and it just made me angry. We don’t really need a doctor here – do we? These patients are convalescing. They don’t need complicated medical treatments, much less surgery! I’ve spent hours and hours devising their treatments – their therapy. And suddenly I had a nice young doctor who could actually think for himself here, ready to dig in and change things up.”
He scoffed. What the garden needed, he thought, was a bunker. He glanced at the leather case Molly held, the case that was full of secret documents that shouldn’t be in the garden at all.
“No - of course not. You can enlighten me later - after the game.” John really didn’t want to think about this right now - or ever. The seconds ticked by. He cleared his throat.
“He had a fire going in the grate,” Sherlock commented as he dropped onto the sofa, removed his shoes, then stretched out, giving the ceiling a puzzled look.
“What?” John stood with arms folded and stared at Sherlock. “Sherlock, you are not twelve years old. You don’t get to do this.”
“A little early for Father Christmas,” John mused.
Interesting that he was using Captain and not Doctor, thought John. Mycroft was reminding him, perhaps, that despite his lack of uniform, he hadn’t been discharged, and had to both answer to and obey his superiors.
It was dangerous, but there were those that had once claimed that danger was John’s middle name. He had an idea that
“I don’t understand,” Harry said, as John and Sherlock joined them in the sitting room. “I simply reversed the shrinking spell on the clothes. They were his clothes – the more casual ones he leaves in his office. I’ve seen him wearing them several times. There’s no reason they wouldn’t fit him.”
“That’s quite enough of that one,” Sherlock interrupted. “My turn – top ten wonderful things about bees.”
He looked up to find Sherlock Holmes’ strangely-coloured eyes staring at him. His mouth twitched  into what might have been an amused smile.
“Your exposure to a patient with brain trauma-induced epilepsy was not the first thing I noticed when I reviewed your profile. I was much more interested – as I know you’ve now determined – in your injury, and its consequences on your life and career. When I discovered that you had played the piano, I was even more interested.”
“I need to use the toilet, Dr. Watson.”  Mycroft sounded both tired and extremely serious. “Then I would like a word with you.”
“Mother of Merlin?” repeated John. Sherlock was beginning to sound like a legitimate wizard.
“Thinking.”
“And no, there really isn’t anything we aren’t telling you,” Al reassured him. “Most children with at least one magical parent are magical themselves, but not always. Severus’ father was a Mug – I mean a Muppet.”
you,” he said. slipping into full lecture mode, “we don’t use magic
He said the last with a bit of desperation. He’d lost enough already. He didn’t fancy losing even more.
The prospect of having Rosie home for the summer distracted Sherlock for the rest of the cab ride, the wait at the airport and the trip back to 221B. It wasn’t until Rosie and Sherlock were struggling inside while John paid the cabbie and Sherlock accidentally on purpose fell heavily against the door of 221A that the problem of the technology-averse, front-door avoiding new neighbor plopped itself back down front and center in Sherlock’s focus.
Molly’s head swiveled quickly toward him, and John, realising what he’s said, worked to keep his expression neutral.
“How did your wife die, John?”
Sherlock assumed a haughty attitude. “I’ll remind you that I’m a grown man. I may not be a whole man, anymore, but I can take care of myself.”
“The seizures are severe,” he stated at last. “Though he comes out of them more lucid than I’d have expected.”
“Unfortunately, there’s no cure for epilepsy,” John stated bluntly. “Sherlock continues to have seizures, though the frequency and intensity vary greatly. I’ve been working with his aide, Billy Wiggins, to track potential triggers.” He glanced at Sherlock to find the man’s sharp eyes on him – he hadn’t divulged this bit of information before. Sherlock continued to scrutinize him as John continued. “His overall health, outside of the epilepsy, is good, though he remained underweight. He seems to have recovered from his injuries otherwise.”
Sherlock was injured. Sherlock was being settled in the infirmary.
“Get acquainted.” John was developing a habit of repeating Sherlock’s out-of-nowhere statements. “What would you call our last time together? When you accosted me in bed? Dressed as a woman?”
It was Molly’s voice, soft, gently chiding. He looked up to find her standing in the doorway. She smiled, and he smiled back wanly.
The ground was getting close – he was only a hundred feet up or so.
No matter that it takes him hours to notice John is missing, and another frantic hour after that to find him, Sherlock is at his side when he opens his eyes.
They watched the child together for a long moment as he pounded his small fists into the grass.
need it.”
Sherlock noticed John’s new resolve within minutes, and shattered it into pieces within an hour.
He cut himself off abruptly.
But no seizures – at least temporarily – was good news for a man recovering from another head injury and a compound fracture.
John backed away. “I’m not even going to ask why that’s in your wardrobe, and have no intention of putting it on, so put it back where you found it.” He looked up as Billy Higgins opened the connecting door and stuck his head inside Sherlock’s room, watching John with apparent interest and ignoring the green dress as if it weren’t actually the elephant in the room. “I’m taking you outside for some air and exercise, under the pretense of taking your grandfather out into the gardens that he misses so much.”
John slowly turned his gaze away from Sherlock and fixed his eyes on Mycroft Holmes.
“Sherlock.”
“No idea,” answered Al, sitting on the other side of Rosie’s bed. “The vestigial tail won’t show up for a few more days.”
No one spoke for several moments. Sholto shuffled through more papers, the colonel stared at Anderson and Mycroft stared at Sherlock, who had gone back to staring at John.
Sherlock was quiet for some time, but when he spoke, he surprised John with the direction of his thoughts, and the intensity of emotion behind his words.
What the hell had the woman meant by that?
Sherlock watched John as he spoke, and John shifted uncomfortably under the scrutiny. He knew that Sherlock, with his sharp mind and uncanny ability to see right through him, was very likely piecing together an explanation for John’s mood, and his reluctance to show Sherlock the key and to admit that the crow’s behavior seemed unusual.
tree was positioned such that if we climbed high enough, we could see over the garden walls.”
Now it was time for more instruction for the second jump of the day.
“Molly, then.” He leaned forward. “Molly, I think we understand each other. I’ll stay out of your way, but I’ll be available for anything you need. So long as we’re both forced to be here, let’s make the best of it.”
John still did not ask what, exactly, had happened, though he itched to know. He wanted to hear it only once, and only from Sherlock.
He hurried on alone to the infirmary while Mrs. Hudson continued to the breakfast room, mentally preparing himself for the chaos to come.
He sighs and gives it up. “Of course. Enough for a lifetime.”
He opened his eyes, blinking back sleep. He focused on the figure before him, mouth dropping open in surprise when he saw who it was.
John Watson did not like being used. He had sins of his own to atone for, but the decision to change the course of his life had been his and his alone. Driven, perhaps, by guilt – most assuredly by guilt – but not imposed upon him by anyone or anything other than his own misguided morality.
John, still feeling a bit off after a long day of uncomfortable thoughts and feelings he couldn’t yet reconcile, was quite aware of the key in his pocket as he glanced warily at the crow. It was an ordinary looking bird, one of dozens or more than hung about the manor. It was impossible to know if it was the same bird that had scolded him earlier from the tree with the old treehouse platform, but the possibility seemed remote.
“You’ll survive,” John said, wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s waist and pulling him in closer. The story, the reporters, the memories of a day he’d tried to forget faded against the solid weight of Sherlock beside him. He slowly released a breath then rested his head on the familiar shoulder. “You always do.”
John sat on the bed and nodded at the chair beside the small desk. Lestrade sat down, glancing around the room with guarded interest.
“Well, that would depend on your definition of emergency, I suppose,” Mrs. Hudson snipped. She was clearly frustrated, but John understood that she depended on her position at Rosethorne, and that position depended entirely on Mycroft Holmes.
“But I am,” John responded. “I
“Because he’s shagging her too.”
“I did. We’re not exactly hiding it. It’s surprising it took this long for a slow news day to pop up.”
“I don’t understand why they live with Muppets,” Sherlock complained some time later. “They should live in a proper castle like the other unusual misfits.”
Christ - it wasn’t fair. He’d put it all behind him years ago, with his father. Determined then and there to lead what would seem a normal life to anyone looking in, atone for his sins, the sins that had put his father behind bars, that had taken his life prematurely. He’d been there for his mother, through every day of her illness and decline. He’d become a doctor, taken a wife, joined the army, gone off to war. He’d followed orders - had had a model career. If he’s slipped once, if he’s snapped, he’d been paying for it, making up for it, every minute, every second, sick with the worry, the
When he answered in the affirmative, thinking they might handle the situation with more delicacy, the woman called out to her team. “Hey, it’s Sherlock Holmes – that detective from London!”
Sherlock smiled. “You have a curious habit of repeating what I say. I’m assuming it’s your manner of dealing with the abruptness of my statements. I don’t like to waste words, but if a preface statement is required to introduce my thought, please say so.”
John very deliberately kept his mouth firmly shut, defying its natural instinct to drop open as he digested the content of Sherlock’s lengthy spiel.
John shook his head. “Nope. Didn’t mention that.”  He didn’t ask how Sherlock knew. “Does he have a partner?”
“Read it on the Met’s website more like,” John responded. “Congratulations, then. How long have you known?”
John sat up, sitting cross-legged in much the same position in which he’d found Irene Adler earlier that day.
It needed to be cleaned thoroughly, possibly drained, and certainly redressed. He imagined he was up to the task - the piano therapy had done as much to improve the dexterity of his right hand as it had strengthened his left. Marginal improvements, to be sure, but improvements nonetheless. Surely he could manage as simple procedure as this.
And another.
Chapter 21
? So physically close to the rooms where Sherlock was hidden? Where there was always a chance he’d be discovered?
The aerial wedding of Rosamund Mary Watson and Albus Severus Potter began exactly as planned, with a bit of help from magic, of course, but veered out of course dramatically before everyone was safely on the ground.
“Where are you?” the man asks. His voice is rough with disuse and tinged with disbelief. “No – strike that. What did you think you’d find behind this door?”
“No! No thank you, I mean,” Mycroft exclaimed, backing away with his hands raised. He touched his eye gingerly and smiled. John saw then that his lip was swollen as well. “I like it – I want to keep it. George says it looks
He continued playing with his right hand as he worked the thumb and middle finger of his left down so that his index finger was extended.
- can he not resurrect what he once had?”
It was almost like dancing - anticipating the next move, the spin, the turn, the dip. Every sound - cloth on cloth, creak of bone, catch of breath, scrape of teeth on skin stretched tightly over collarbone - every sound was magnified, over-loud in the stillness. Heart hammering in chest too small to contain it, he pressed his mouth again to Sherlock’s, searching for sustenance. This kiss -
“John’s a doctor.” It was Mycroft who spoke now. He’d had at least two glasses of champagne and was working through a third. “He’ll get him sorted and back here in a trice. Battlefield triage, John.”
He found he quite liked spending time out-of-doors, and his afternoon meanderings about the gardens grew in length, and he began to venture further away from the Manor, trying out crumbling walks that led to long-neglected terraces and gardens. He encountered his first locked door one misty Monday afternoon, and remembered what Mycroft Holmes had told him about locked doors – that they were locked for a reason.
“Just stop it, you two,” Rosie said with a laugh.  She looked around and gave a happy sight, then executed a perfect spin with her arms spread out. “Home!” she exclaimed. “It’s so good to be back.”
And finally, in the waning light before sunset, a visit to the garden.
He could almost hear Sherlock’s voice of dismissal.
“She lived nearby – across the street, perhaps? You went there after school to practice. You never complained.”
he thought as he closed his eyes and let his mind drift into the unexpected pleasures of this summer’s day. It occurred to him, as the sound of the men’s voices and the clacking of their tools passed by him on the wind, that, given his initial reaction to Lestrade and Sherlock’s relationship, he was oddly calm about the obvious closeness between them today.
Chapter 2
Sherlock huffed in a breath but said nothing.
John’s story from this point forward is by-the-book predictable. Extraction from the vehicle. Transport in an ambulance to hospital. The first of three surgeries to put repair his shattered leg. Blood loss. Trauma. A morphine-induced haze that lasted longer than it took Sherlock to find him.
John grinned. “You’re going to stop wondering if Ham’s a wiz-fit or not. We finally get to put that to bed so you can start obsessing about Sophie.”
Sherlock, however, who had remained silent during the frantic discussion, observing as he always did, waited until everyone else had run out of ideas before speaking.
“You know what I mean,” she said, looking much more mirthful than the situation warranted. “Killed him in some way
John is distracted. There is work, and there is Rosie. He mourns, perhaps not for Mary, but for a mother for his child, for the life he thought he wanted. He is comfortable here in 221B, his home, Rosie’s home, but he’s not comfortable with the idea of it, with what others see, with what they surmise. He is torn.
John shook his head in resignation and dropped all pretense of pretending he didn’t want to explore the tunnel with Sherlock.
“And where does this family live?” prompted Sherlock, pretending to swipe at the table again. Rose had disappeared into the kitchen to help John, leaving Sherlock with relative freedom to grill Al until he broke down and admitted the entire family was from another planet – one that traveled by fireplace floo.
“You’re right, of course. It’s irrelevant. It just irks me, is all.”
“You might have years.” Sherlock’s voice was obstinate.
The corners of Holmes’ mouth twitched as if he wanted to give John a congratulatory smile but could not quite force his face to comply. “Touche, Dr. Watson.” He had picked up the remains of his shortbread and frowned as it crumbled in his fingers. “The letter, of course, is a formality. Let me assure you it will ultimately make things easier for Miss Adler as she moves on to her next … assignment.” Here he caught and held John’s eyes. “It will lend credence to her resume – explain her absence these last months.”
There was a kiss, a quiet morning, a peaceful day. An evening together, a bottle of wine, a door left open, sheets turned down in invitation. There was a breeze through the window, a rustling of fabric, a feather-soft pillow, and sleep as restful as he’d ever had, Sherlock’s steady breathing a metronome of tranquility, a bellwether of change.
“You can’t wear that,” he said, hardly glancing up.
John stared at the paper, then raised his eyes and met Lestrade’s gaze.
“In bed,” John said, standing and offering a hand to Sherlock. “I’ll answer a question or two once you’re settled.”
John wanted to ask - and after the war? After Rosethorne? Are we going to share a bachelor’s flat in London? Have friends in common? Go to the theater? The symphony? Will my entire life be spent following you about London keeping you out of trouble and patching up your wounds?
“Sherlock – you know he could just reach in through the crib and take it out of her mouth. He’s been obsessed with that thing since she came home from hospital.”
“Um – more or less,” Al answered, already accustomed to Sherlock’s odd magical vocabulary. “Gran likes to do snitches and dragons and brooms and things though.”
Dates. Diagnoses. Procedures. Medications. Prognosis.
“I take it we’re not celebrating my uncanny ability to survive in the face of certain death.” He sipped the scotch and studied John. He didn’t appear inebriated, but he definitely was not on his first glass.
Sherlock nods. “Still here,” he confirms.
,” Sherlock replied. “And it’s awfully rude to stare at another person’s genitals. And even more rude to comment on them.”
Sherlock moved his white bishop, keeping his finger atop it while he studied the board, then finally, appearing satisfied with the move, removing his hand and looking across at John.
“Yes, there’s a problem!” Sherlock dropped heavily into his chair and stared at John as if John were solely responsible for whatever it was that had caused him to hurl his mobile at the sofa.
“John – your family is all here. On this plane. With you.”
Mycroft Holmes tapped his index finger on the table, regarding John for a long, uncomfortable moment.
knew came from John’s private military records. Records, he noted, that apparently weren’t very private at all. No one seeing him going about with limp and cane would assume he was simply imagining an injury.
“Nightmares with thrashing,” she said sagely. “You broke a nurse’s nose.”
“Well, your turn, then,” John says at last with a breath of courage, pressing the green box into Sherlock’s hands and smiling awkwardly. He doesn’t know if Sherlock will understand, or realise without him explaining it all, and he waits while Sherlock opens the box and extracts an off-white scarf with blue and green trim– oatmeal coloured, really – loosely knit in a pattern Molly said was “Flight of the Bumblebees.” He didn’t spend a shilling on it – just lots of thought, and second thoughts, and thirds.
He pays no mind as the door swings shut behind him.
“She killed him?” John raised an eyebrow. He knew she was dangerous, and frankly, didn’t have to stretch his mind much to find her capable of murder.
A garden that missed Sherlock. Missed his motion, his music. Missed him conducting the impossible flight of bees with raised bow, or taking up the clippers to sculpt the mane of a lion or the arced spine of a sea monster. The low work table sat neglected, and the pile of lumber from the dismantled garden shed was slowly disappearing under a blanket of leaves.
“The Burrow?” Sherlock pulled out a chair and motioned Al into it. He leaned in closer. “Do elaborate.”
“Yet you expect me to help you – somehow.”
“I’m not?”
“So it’s perfectly ordinary that he has an owl?” asked Sherlock.
“No. Plain is fine.”
“I’ll do what I can for your brother,” he acquiesced. “But I’m quite sure I won’t suggest anything his doctors haven’t already….”
The rest of the day passed pleasantly enough, with the exception of the dreaded meeting where Al and Rosie sat down parents and grandparents and introduced their unconventional wedding plans.
,” he said, his voice a soft whisper in the darkness. “It’s that it no longer interests me as it once did. I don’t
He pressed again on the wound and frowned as it wept a yellowish fluid.
THANK YOU to the commentor who pointed out that the chapter ended in mid-stream. An italics tag left open somehow prevented the rest of the story from pasting in. How anti-climatic. It made absolutely no sense and my apologies go out to the 100 or so of you who must have been left puzzled (and mostly likely won't even know I screwed up and the chapter didn't end at a ridiculous place.
From all appearances, this second room was study, parlour, laboratory and smoking lounge. It held a mishmash of objects and furnishings, and the scent of pipe smoke clung to the carpet and curtains. Sherlock went directly to an upholstered red chair that faced the fireplace, then moved a stack of books from it onto the floor and patted the seat.
“Loo?” he asked.
This one is too fun not to continue!
And he had help – help from a most unexpected source.
“It’s a lovely dress, Mrs. Potter. Perfect for sky diving – it certainly won’t billow up around your face when we’re coming down.”
“I see.” He stared at John a long, uncomfortable moment then, in a most unexpected move, clapped his hands together and jumped out of his chair.
He shouldn’t be playing odd games of chess, drinking too much scotch, drawing a cartoon of Mycroft Holmes standing on a plank with crocodiles circling below. He shouldn’t be letting Sherlock Holmes see through him. He shouldn’t be answering questions about his father, his mother, Mary.
“Until your brother officially raises you from the dead, I suppose,” answered John.
Sherlock used that opportunity to take another selfie of them, this one with John in reactionary lecture mode.
John shook his head and opened his laptop again.
With the Weasleys.
“Surprised?” John asked as he unpacked bread and eggs and apples and potatoes. “Didn’t realise that when Mrs. Hudson told us she’d be leasing the flat out for a year that we’d actually have new neighbors?”
John imagined Sherlock as a child, and had no trouble at all seeing him sitting on a garden bench, petulantly pulling at this cuffs and kicking stones out of the way with well-shined shoes, or running along the paths ahead of his brother, brandishing a stick like an army rifle.
Though, as with anything in life, there was the occasional surprise. A quick visit from Mycroft Holmes, sometimes come and gone before John knew he was in residence. A very early morning wake-up call when Sherlock had a particularly bad seizure. Surprising bits of information gleaned from Sherlock as he strolled around and around the wild garden on the cobblestone path, talking – always talking – and intrinsically trusting that John was beside him, listening.
“Precisely. But what you may not know is that the transmissions have already been decoded. The intent is that I study the code itself – dissect it, take it down to its core – and compile a mental encyclopaedia of sorts. One that ultimately enables me to design the perfect, unbreakable code.”
She shook her head. “His grandfather – Malcolm. He passed away only a few days before we brought Sherlock here to Rosethorne,” she said.
“Surgery,” answered Holmes in a clipped, disinterested voice. “Numbed it and cut it out. I should have insisted that you do it – you’d have done a better job right-handed.” He grimaced as John pulled off the gauze covering a row of uneven sutures. “How
“It has snaps,” John informed everyone.
“I’m not - that isn’t true. It isn’t quite true, I mean,” John fumbled. “I’m - well, we’re all rather isolated here, aren’t we? And I know it doesn’t make sense, but since my injury, I’ve been even more so. Getting to know you has been unexpected - unexpectedly enjoyable.” He felt like he was babbling, like he was a ridiculous teenager trying to back himself out of a corner. “And Lestrade - he’s part of your past, isn’t he? An important part. In the back of my mind, I suppose, I thought you might not need my friendship anymore.”
ooOOOoo
Sherlock knew.
was he going to engineer this thing? A dead man couldn’t just turn up outside, getting exercise and breathing the fresh air.
“Famously,” Sherlock agreed. “Her credentials looked good on paper, and she didn’t disappoint.”
“Because you didn’t notice. And don’t even suggest that the floors have dried already.  If they had, there’s have been traces of mud – at least one partial footprint but more likely dozens. And what do you do with your brolly before going inside? You shake it off. Yet not a single drop of water or splatter mark anywhere.”
He sat on the floor beside Sherlock, bad leg stretched out awkwardly before him, and continued to rub his back, a gesture he wouldn’t have dared before today. The rhythmic motion calmed him as much as it soothed Sherlock. As Sherlock’s breathing became more regular, John took the time to study his surroundings. They were in the middle of what must be, from its size and layout, a dressing room, with a large window to the side and mirrors on every wall. The room suggested a faded sort of elegance, with gold-flecked wallpaper peeling away behind the beveled mirrors and cobwebs glazing the crystal chandelier overhead. The gauzy curtains at the window were nearly transparent, and beyond them, through the dusty glass, he could see the line of the ivy-covered garden wall.
John turned. Lestrade pointed at the wheelchair, then back at Sherlock.
brother, and you’re supposed to be the QUIET one.” Sherlock’s voice rose, magically amplified, from somewhere behind John before he was able to process the entire chaotic scene. “And I very much doubt your pompous grown-up self shed a SINGLE tear when Dumbledore
“Captain Watson, your report is being changed, effective immediately, to Major James Sholto.” Sherlock looked up as the colonel spoke, suddenly more interested in the proceedings. “Unfortunately, you will still some responsibility for your other patients. It is critical that life at Rosethorne continue to appear exactly as it does now to anyone on the outside.”
“Lost it - no. I’m convinced the information is intact. I’ve lost the structure around it. The filing system. The card catalogue, if you will. I’ve lost the artificial organisational construct around the data – it’s as if someone removed the cards from the drawers and tossed them all into the middle of the room.”
Sherlock blinks, counts to four, blinks again.
“Sherlock!”
, not
“Alright,” Sherlock said lightly, obviously unconvinced. He nodded at the board. “Your move.”
Sherlock lifted the piano cover and slid it back silently, then rifled through the sheet music, finally settling on a piece and propping it up above the keys.
“Sherlock – you’ve got to stop calling witches and wizards unusual misfits,” John insisted under his breath.
“Why are you here? What’s going on?” he asked as he tied the sash, feeling somehow inadequate in his serviceable but rather plain gown.
John was absolutely missing something – something important.
Rosie reached over and squeezed John’s hand. “Dad, you’re going to love this. Stop thinking about it. We were sure Sherlock would be the problem up here – we didn’t do any contingency planning for you.”
Molly had acted like she expected him, and as she hurried out, Sherlock, who was sitting at a table sorting through the contents of a folio, lifted his head and looked up at John.
“While I admit that the sight of an entire hive creating a new queen then leaving the first hive en masse to seek new quarters is impressive, it does leave me with nothing for all the hard work I’ve put in.”
He must have looked less in control than he thought because she brought her hand to her face and muttered “Oh dear.”
He trailed off, and Molly shifted uncomfortably beside him.
“All this time I’ve been trying to recapture what I’d lost – to find a way to piece back together all the ridiculous bits of information I’d archived before the accident. But while I failed miserably at that, I somehow succeeded in building something entirely new.”
“Mr. Holmes is – well, he’s rather abrupt. He doesn’t waste words, and he has certain expectations of all of the staff. He doesn’t spend much time here, so we’re left alone to go about our business most of the time.” She lowered her voice and glanced down the passageway. “We need a doctor here, Dr. Watson. Don’t let Mr. Holmes scare you away.”
“But we’re the fathers,” John pointed out.
“That wouldn’t have surprised me at all. The Hamster is really quite remarkable – I….”
“Wand pocket? I need one of those,” Sherlock said. “And extra buttons – everywhere.”
“About that - yes.” John gestured at the room in general, trying to convey his displeasure. “But not about the rest of it, Sherlock. We’re in a manor house – not a church meeting room.”
Sherlock, looking more amused than annoyed, dropped onto the bed and reached down for his slippers.
There had to be a loo, he thought.
“She’s finished with Teddy, Scorpius and Freddie and they went back to the Leaky.” Harry stood up from the ancient needle-point chair where he’d been waiting. “She’s working on Arthur and James now. Then she’d like Sherlock and John as she doesn’t have their measurements on file.”
“Sherlock? Are you alright?”
The corridor, as he had expected, was silent and empty.
“Have you actually seen an owl in the flat, Sherlock?” John challenged.
Nevertheless, he’d left the room and gone directly to Molly, who’d chastised him for waiting so long, but had dutifully removed the stingers, treated the wounds and bandaged his hand, then sent him to his room with an ice pack. He’d tried sleeping, but his mind was restless and he couldn’t settle down.
Now John’s eyes widened, then he looked down at his own set of files, cheeks beginning to redden.
It was a question out of the blue, and John found his focus once more jerked from one line of thought to quite another.
“Ah. Right.” John looks down to hide a smile, then back at the door that’s closed behind them. “And you never did use the loo.”
“Sherlock – I promise you we’ll alert you at the first sign of wizfit activity,” Rosie said. “Now bring him to me – as much as I love you, I don’t quite yet trust you to not to do experiments on him.”
Molly’s attention was, for the first time, directed to his hand.  She looked at him quizzically, and he lifted his hand off of his leg and attempted to make a fist.
John had stood to fetch the baby for Rosie and carefully lifted him from Sherlock’s lap. “Granddad John is not stealing anything from the surgery, young man,” he said. He carefully passed the child to his daughter. “What do you think, Rosie? Does he have Sherlock’s nose or what?”
“Of course.” Mycroft cut him off at the quick. “He has access to the entire British library system, every critical record of note held by the British government, academic journals and processes, theoretical studies. He’s read case study after case study of similar situations – brilliant minds cut down in their prime by traumatic head injuries. It isn’t overwhelmingly encouraging, is it, Dr. Watson?”
Mycroft’s expression, illuminated only by the dim light from the bedside lamp, did not change. He stared at John, his eyes sharp behind the pain that should have had him begging for relief.
He’d been whistling.
“Does anything hurt besides your foot?” asked an unfamiliar voice. Low and a bit gravelly, rich in a way John couldn’t explain. It was almost as if the person speaking was there but
Major Sholto waited for John to finish. He looked at Mycroft, received a nod in response, then directed his attention to John. He had a handsome face, though weathered and tired, and he ran his hand through thinning hair and scratched the base of his neck.
“But I do know you well,” Sherlock countered, a smile of satisfaction flitting slowly across his face and disappearing into a sigh. “But I can’t connect the pieces. My mind palace is in shambles. I
The statement hung in the air between them. Mycroft refused Sherlock’s request? Sherlock could be so persistent he’d have strangers revealing their NI numbers on a crowded tube carriage.
They don’t speak of her often, though there is no conscious decision not to. Once the dust has finally settled and the cobwebs and skeletons have been cleared from the closets and some even from Sherlock’s mind, they unconsciously adopt a go-forward attitude and rebuild their lives around the rebuilt 221B.
John noted the use of the work escape. A slip of the tongue, but a telling one. “Then he did it while I was asleep – before they brought me to him. Or after I fell asleep in his room.”
“I’ve got a niece and a nephew on the team this year. I’m up from the reserve for a couple weeks on holiday and thought I’d come out and watch them play since I’ll have to go back to Romania before their first game.”
“That’s not the therapy I prescribed, John.”
!” insisted Mycroft, tugging on their hands to remind them that Honeydukes was not getting any closer at this rate.
A moment later Rosie was pulling him by the elbow as they hurried down a quaint little street right out of Victorian London, minus the unpleasant smells. There was quite a bit he wanted to stop and study, but John took hold of his other elbow and he hardly had time to turn his head to look into an intriguing antiquities store before they were stepping up into a shop – he didn’t catch the name but thought “Madam” was in there somewhere.
The children knew, though they didn’t know what they knew. Sherlock and John were family, like Mrs. Hudson, and mummy and dad. Sherlock brought them frogs eggs and caterpillars, balanced with them on railings, fixed their bicycles to reach maximum speed. John patched up their skinned knees, kept a supply of chocolate biscuits and read
“Giants eat children!”
“No thank you. No need for that.”
“Every single person in this room has a vested interest in my brother’s ability to finish the project he had undertaken before he was injured. He’d made significant progress, and a breakthrough was imminent.”
friends.
“And you chose me.” John had a hundred questions, a dozen statements of incredulity, but he cut through it all to the heart of the matter. England, counting on the assistance of this apparently brilliant code breaker to help win the war, was putting its hope in an injured field surgeon who was barely able to pick up marbles with his dominant hand. And taking its time about it. He’d been here weeks and had only just met the very person he was – somehow – supposed to help.
A young man, a younger version of Harry, threw open the door in apparent alarm.
Lestrade, whose eyes were locked on Sherlock’s face. Whose own face was white with shock. Whose chest was heaving.
He lifted John’s closed hand to his lips, and pressed them against it, and the brand burned into his skin, and settled around his heart.
“Slowly. Molly has me counting pills – picking them up and dropping them into a bowl. It takes me an hour to do what I should be able to do in five minutes. I’m not going to be working on that toe anytime soon, Mr. Holmes. You should see a doctor in London.”
Sherlock shook his head. His look was – well,
Gateman was another generous statement. The man was dressed like a gardener, far too old to serve, and had a weathered look about him, as if he’d spent more time in the sun than indoors. John had the feeling that he watched the car until it was out of sight down the drive, and the feeling of being watched did little to calm his increasingly jumpy nerves.
“My dad was shot – in Afghanistan,” Rosie supplied casually. “He’s got a fabulous scar – not quite as fabulous as your dad’s though. And Da too – but he was shot by my mother – in the heart. He almost died.” She grinned.
“I’m well aware of that,” John answered. “It wasn’t important until I began looking for a place to bring you to exercise outside. And – well, I don’t really know.” He sighed, and looked at Sherlock, chagrinned. “I know it sounds silly – but I think I wanted to spring it on you. A surprise – the big reveal. But I wanted to solve it for myself – figure out how to get in again, without you puzzling it out for me. It really does seem ridiculous now, looking at it from this angle with you sitting here telling me you used to look over the walls, afraid of ghosts.”
Molly looked much more energised than he felt. She would, of course. She had an intriguing new task and an interesting new partner.
“Meds schmeds,” Sherlock protested lightly. “Go on – another set.”
“Look – I’m sorry. I had no idea. Most children….”
“Humiliating,” Sherlock responded. “But it was a valiant search. I didn’t trust anything at face value then, and don’t to this day." He huffed out a sigh. "It's served me well through the years.”
Al and Harry came around with them, taking seats on straight-back chairs against the wall while the woman tapped a wooden box with her wand. “Shoes off,” she instructed. “Then climb up and be still.”
your therapy moving along, Dr. Watson? You seem to have more strength in that hand.”
“And staying off the front lines kept me safe and sound.”
thoughts away. He’d met Mary a year after she’d been assaulted by her then-husband, pushed over a stair railing while heavily pregnant.
“Good. Now, please tell me why you are so adamant that your father not know about your sordid little love triangle. He’s no angel himself, Scorpius. It might be a father-son binding moment.”
“Adieu, mon ami,” she said. She tucked an errant curl behind his hear, stretched her legs out gracefully, then stood, bending down for a final kiss, this time a lingering one to his mouth, before turning back toward John, addressing him as she smoothed out her skirt and slipped into her shoes.
“He thinks I tried to kill him.” John sighed. “Apparently, he’s never Apparated before.”
There came a day, some time after Sherlock and John found the tunnel and ventured through it to the cottage, when Sherlock, more melancholy than usual as they walked through Greg’s garden, said, “I need to do something.”
He blinks his eyes. Counts slowly to four. Blinks them again as John’s face swims into focus.
The weight of the key in his pocket was comforting as John made his way back to the manor. Far above, the crow watched him. He should have remembered that crows were intelligent birds, and problem solvers, with long memories and a fondness for shiny trinkets.
“Take him a moment,” he murmurs. He presses a kiss to his grandson’s head and passes the baby to Sherlock. He carefully gets to his feet and sorts out his leg, then thumbs through his mobile and places it on the table. He’s still fiddling with the volume when the music begins, and he smiles at the tune, still familiar after all these years.
“Does a bit of both.”
“I’ve not told you about my wife, either.”
“Good – good.” She smiled at him conspiratorially, and wiggled on her bench. “And while you’re at it, you might do something about this one too.”
“That’s because I’ve given him a nice dose of morphine so you and I can have a little talk, Dr. Watson.”
“It’s depressing.”
John pressed his eyes shut. He knew that wasn’t in the official report. That Sherlock had put the pieces together, though, no longer surprised him. He could even see, in a way, what Sherlock was trying to do. It might feel cruel, but there was a larger purpose here. He’d spent years layering reality over fabrication, creating a twisted version of events that fit the mould he needed to go on.
“Back – sorry it took so long. I couldn’t find the rhubarb biscuits,” Sherlock called out as he carried the shopping bags into the kitchen.
Sherlock caught his eye. “Only that you loved her. You were devoted to her. I guessed a bit more. Would you rather tell me about her than about your father?”
“Locked to the impossible, and suspicious of even the improbable,” Rosie finished.
“I’ve noticed a bit of improvement, thank you.” John was using his left hand to steady the toe as he examined it. The offending toenail had been cut out, as Holmes had indicated, but the toe was red and clearly infected. He pressed against a worrisome spot and Holmes winced then blew out a slow breath, but did not jerk away.
“I can’t imagine what that might be,” John said. “You’re – inventive….”
“Three
John hummed. He dropped back down beside Sherlock, on his side, cradling the pillow under his head. “You haven’t told me how it happened,” he said. “How did Mycroft get abducted, anyway? I wouldn’t think he’d be the target they were looking for. I can’t think of a more difficult prisoner.”
Sherlock frowned. “I already have a husband, John. Why would I want to complicate things and start dating again?”
Mycroft had returned to London to convalesce. John didn’t expect to see him for several weeks. He didn’t seem the type who’d put up with a skeleton crew of caregivers – the man probably needed help to tie his shoes even when he didn’t have a broken arm.
“So…..” he began, unsure of just exactly how he would make this very obvious argument. “All those clothes in the wardrobe in our bedroom – you’ve outgrown them?”
And thus ends the tale of The Case of the (very) Small Mycroft, with Mycroft restored to better than original condition, Sherlock proven surprisingly susceptible to the allure of the Veela, and no one really caring that John was more endowed than Sherlock.
John didn’t miss it for quite some time.
The Flat that Smells of Curry
A noise above him in the trees caught John’s attention, and he looked up to watch a squirrel on a low branch. It paused to chatter at a robin, and the chattering caught Lestrade’s attention. He snapped his fingers and held out his arm and the squirrel, obviously not a random wild thing as John had thought, ran across the branch, down the trunk and over the ground toward him. Lestrade stooped to lower his arm, and the creature jumped up and scurried up to sit at the juncture of neck and shoulder, accepting a treat from Lestrade’s pocket, then holding it in both small hands, nibbling on it and turning it as if it were an ear of corn.
He heard the door as it opened again behind him, and gathered himself, putting on as pleasant a face as he could muster before turning to face Molly again.
But perhaps he’d have to rethink the entire idea anyway. For today he’d discovered that Sherlock’s post-seizure mind wasn’t a confusing maze of dead-end corridors and mist-filled cellars. It was sharp and clear and capable of examining an old tree and solving a puzzle inside a mystery they hadn’t even known existed.
“You’re not going to die before me,” Sherlock said, his voice barely audible.
He rolled his head against the wall and closed his eyes, giving in, allowing his body to go where it would, right here in the corridor where they could practically hear Mycroft breathing. He felt Sherlock fumbling with his shirt buttons, pushing his vest up. The air in the corridor was cool and still, and he felt momentarily exposed until warm, moist lips moved over his chest and closed on his nipple. Tongue and teeth then suction so deep that he shuddered. The fingers of his right hand dug into the back of Sherlock’s shoulders, and he hardly had breath for the
Or, better said, his daughter, his barely-controlled anger, the waning presence of the woman he had loved. Metaphors from therapy, from life, with only Sherlock missing, but he’s not settled on one for Sherlock, and isn't sure he’ll share it with him if he ever does.
So when Severus jumped, Sherlock went too.
Harry laughed but John was absolutely sure the other man muttered “something like that” loud enough for John to hear and Harry elbowed him and smiled.
Your health, your recovery, your productivity. And ultimately, apparently, the future of England.”
Sherlock shifted in his seat, looking at John oddly. “Well, first of all, she is as she always was. Indescribably intelligent, very hard-working and terribly distracted.” He paused a moment, studying him, then added. “She’s not dead, John. What gave you the idea that she was?”
She became suddenly, uncharacteristically, quiet at that point, and John had the idea that she knew quite a bit more about Dr. Chandler’s departure than she was letting on.
“Can’t one of your….?”
Sholto chuckled. “Captain, just keep doing what you’re already doing. You know now what Sherlock is working on. If you can help get him to the goal a bit quicker, all the better. You know what we’re up against.“ His hand, on the table before him, closed into a fist. “You know how important this is.”
They stared at each other, neither speaking or acknowledging  the other’s presence, until John stepped back into his room and motioned with his bandaged hand.
“Good. You hit your head when you fell. You’ve got a nice bump. Does anything else hurt – and yes – I know – everything hurts.” He smiled, trying on his understanding doctor persona. “I mean – does anything hurt more than it usually does after an attack.”
It was a statement, not a question, and Sherlock, eyes still closed, acknowledged it with a quiet hum.
from there, or retrieve patterns from previous successes. It’s new effort each time around, which makes me essentially useless. And worse yet, I’ve discovered large caches of random data – the planets, for example, and their attendant moons – clearly misfiled, shoved back in a dusty corner like unwanted rubbish.”
The woman curled up her tape measure then tossed it into the air. It unfurled itself like some sort of aerial snake then began curling itself around various body parts of Sherlock, giving off a loud ding every time it locked in and magically recorded a measurement.
“Well, you heard him Mycroft. Three of us, then – if you have room on your guest list.”
“In London,” Sherlock added quietly.
Sherlock’s eyes were closed and he appeared to be sleeping.
When they stood around Rosie and Al, hands outstretched and joined with the person on either side, John swallowed a lump in his throat.
“Turn him on his side,” John ordered, pushing quickly into the room then dropping to his knees beside the convulsing man and his attendant.
He’d managed to move the conversation to the sitting area in the music room, and had then gone to find Mrs. Hudson to request tea and sandwiches. He’d found Sherlock and Molly conversing together when he returned, but they’d stopped talking abruptly, and Molly had looked quickly down at her lap while Sherlock cleared a space on the table for the tray. He was certain that neither dared to meet his eyes.
Sherlock sees this. He is accomplished at seeing what others do not. But he can’t see what isn’t there. He can’t see that John wants him.
John must have shouted as he hurried over to him, though he didn’t remember having done so. Sherlock was clearly convulsing, and John struggled to roll him onto his side, his hands painful, weak and useless. He ended up hefting him over with his shoulder leveraged against his side, panting as he struggled to make sure Sherlock was in a proper position to keep his airways open.
“It’s too late for a formal tour so we’ll save that for tomorrow. I’ll have Annie fetch you for breakfast at seven thirty. You will be awake by then, won’t you? I wouldn’t want the girls to be frightened if they have to wake you and find you in one of your fits.”
Oddly, impossibly, John
“You’re not making much sense,” John said, but he smiled, the alcohol making him more indulgent than normal, as he spoke. “And I don’t think there’s much to me beyond what you see on paper.”
ooOOOoo
“John, I’ve changed my mind. I’d rather have them come here.”
The argument leading up to their eventual departure together to the crime scene earlier that evening explains the oversight – he’d been distracted when they left and had failed to pocket his keys. But as the flat now appears dark from the street, and Sherlock deduces that John has gone to bed to cement his snit, he phones Mrs. Hudson.  It’s far better to wake her than John, considering.
He remembered the music he’d heard when he’d stopped before this door. Not piano. Definitely not piano. He glanced around the room. In the corner near a window, one that depicted a busy Victorian-era London street, stood a music stand with sheet music still on it. It was set up for someone quite tall, someone who played standing up, but there was no instrument to be seen.
And apparently, even the prospect of lording it over older children armed with toothbrushes hadn’t been enough to completely take the sting off.
“It’s time,” he tells Rosie, and she nods stoically, but there’s a tear in her eye when they hug goodbye at the train station.
All heads pivoted toward the door as John pushed it open it, but the tired smile that lit Sherlock’s face was all that John saw.
He likes most of the houses they see, but nothing speaks to him in quite the way he’d anticipated. He stands back while Sherlock explores – opening cabinets, peaking under beds, tapping on walls, asking inappropriate questions and deducing the history of the homes and their current owners.
John worried too much.
He would never look at Greg Lestrade the same way again.
Holmes cleared his throat. He put the remainder of his shortbread on his saucer then folded his hands across his stomach. “Miss Adler’s health is much improved. I see no reason for her to continue her stay here. I agreed to take her on here only as a favour. As her attending physician here, you’ll simply need to write a letter of release and she can return to – well, to wherever it is she was before coming here.”
And he’s there through the interminable days that follow, the additional surgeries, the consultations with specialists, the discharge to rehab, the temporary move to Mrs. Hudson’s flat. He’s there, months after the accident, right behind John as he carefully – and stubbornly – makes his way up the stairs.
“You didn’t need to. It was written on your face, plain as your nose.” Sherlock looked up from the schematic he was studying. “Not that your nose is entirely plain - it fits your face well and certainly isn’t the feature one focuses on first.”
“Long enough,” he answered. “Long enough to appreciate your offer to force him into a schedule.”
“At least I still can,” Sherlock huffed back, very put out.
He could practically see the wheels turning as Sherlock tore through whatever room in his Mind palace held such information. Sherlock narrowed his eyes, waiting for the next piece of the puzzle.
John scolded himself for his selfish attitude, and determined to reexamine his priorities. Men were dying out there - hundreds of them, thousands. Men he’d worked with, who’d had his back. Men who didn’t sit at a chessboard in the evening, playing silly games, spending time thinking about themselves,
And, as he’d already learned that the best way to keep up with Sherlock was to suspend disbelief, push aside unanswered questions, clarifications and factual challenges, he allowed himself to get sucked into the Sherlockian vortex.
“Will he be flying a broom out-of-doors then?” asked Sherlock shrewdly.
“She told him I was his uncle,” Sherlock said, stepping forward. “He had a fit – he assumed I am his caretaker now because his parents are
John dropped the tools on Sherlock’s stomach.
. Thinking about Sherlock and Lestrade.
She didn’t bother telling him that Irene Adler was missing.
“Jumpers?” Sherlock glanced at John. He looked worried. “Are those the same for Misfits as for Muppets?”
“Gone – along with her,” he answered, brusquely. He cleared his throat. He wasn’t going to allow Sherlock Holmes to back him into a corner and force him to discuss what had happened. He’d be surprised if the man didn’t already know – he and his brother seemed to have access to every detail about his past. But he’d been gone – already deployed – when the Blitz began. He’d received the news in a letter from his sister and had locked the anger and pain down tight, resolving to stay in the fight until it was won.
John bristled. What the hell was wrong with Sherlock today? “How do you know that? That – that’s not in my file. It’s not even right – not exactly. And it doesn’t matter – I loved her.”
Sherlock had been staring at his own steepled fingers, and he looked abruptly up at John.
Sherlock, apparently, had registered the other man’s presence.
“Macabre,” John noted. He considered a moment. “Which jumper, then?”
He wondered if she knew -
John, who’d spent far more time fumbling through the retelling of his mistakes and tragedies than Sherlock had, was in the mood to listen.
And as he walked back to his room, he wondered if he really had the upper hand here, if Sherlock Holmes could be surprised – or tricked – at all.
“Would you stop taking photos and get me down please?” he managed, trying to keep his voice pleasant and unconcerned.
“Oh come on, John! Owl pellets! Really? You’ve no idea. Google it, for God’s sake!”
John had been in the service far too long to feel betrayed by what most would consider a breach of confidence. Holmes was a civilian, after all, high-placed or not, and obviously knew even more about John’s injuries – physical and traumatic – than he’d so far revealed to John. He wondered who else besides Mrs. Hudson knew.
This one isn’t on the original list. It’s just come on the market, and their estate agent thinks they might like to have a look. They’ve not seen photographs or layouts or square footage or even price, but they’ve decided to give it a go on her recommendation.
“Merlin didn’t have a mother, actually,” said the child, rather primly. “Don’t you have his Chocolate Frog card?” He gave an exaggerated sigh and picked a spot of lint off of his tidy little blue jumper, then took a moment to study the sitting room. “Why do you have a skull on the mantel? That’s rather macabre, isn’t it? And who’s been cursing the wall?”
“My brother wants me to be well so I can return to my position and continue my efforts to help make England victorious. He wanted to find a medical professional to help me, but after the disaster with his last find, I insisted on participating in the selection this time. His belief continues to be that a medical solution exists, and that wealth and influence can procure that solution.”
He didn’t know what woke him in the waning hours of early morning, but when he shifted he found Sherlock on the couch as well, spooned in behind him, one arm draped over John’s belly. The warmth felt wonderful, the casual embrace the culmination of his dreams of normalcy, but when he gathered his wits about him, he untangled himself, then stood, stooping to press a kiss to Sherlock’s temple before going in to check on Mycroft.
ooOOOOoo
But the story stayed in the background for quite some time that evening. Sherlock slept while John sat at his bedside, reading his chart from beginning to end. A compound fracture of tibia and fibula was the most serious injury, though he’d taken a second blow to the head which had resulted in a mild concussion. A dislocated shoulder had been readily righted. He’d been conscious but mildly confused when he’d reached hospital, and had requested no morphine, though it had been administered to him anyway at the surgeon’s insistence. Sutures had been removed with no sign of infection, and he’d been generally alert and disagreeable.
he was feeling, but he had no idea
“She’s being ridiculous. I certainly don’t need baby….”
“And the Scorpion boy?”
“Yes, and no. No one can magic you down. There are Muppets here, Sherlock. You’re just going to have to let the big strong fire fighters save you.”
, standing beside John, serious and tense, following John’s lead and even completing a row of neat sutures with John’s guidance.
“It is
“Severus!?” Lee’s voice pleaded.
to be. He was dangerous, John. The most dangerous man I’ve ever known. More so even than my brother.”
woman, for that matter, except in how they can help him reach his ends. And speaking of romantic interests, Miss Adler was in
And since he was asking for the impossible, he’d take back his old life in London. His fledgling practice. His tiny flat. His clever, beautiful wife.
“Ah – hmm.  Well, it seemed like a good idea,” John said. “Never to late to learn, I suppose, is it?”
If Lestrade thought Sherlock dead, and if Mycroft wanted everyone to continue in this mistaken belief, why was Lestrade
John pondered that sentence. Things that seemed too good to be true generally were. Second blows to the head seldom did anything more than exacerbate an existing problem. He didn’t believe the problem was gone, however. He couldn’t allow himself a hope based on wishes and prayers.
“Observing. Learning. Cataloguing,” replies Sherlock. “He has your upper lip, John. If we’re gone by the time he sprouts facial hair, someone will have to be sure he doesn’t grow a mustache. It will look just as atrocious as yours did.”
The voice was Mycroft’s, and he was alone.
“You don’t even have a boyfriend,” Sherlock said dismissively.
“Such things? You mean women?” John’s closed his laptop and focused on Sherlock with a vague smile.
“Charlie and Al especially, but Henry too – they could all use a distraction. They need something to do, John. Don’t you agree? They can help Greg with the tulip beds – get their hands in the earth for an hour or two a day. They’re not really that sick, are they? They’re just scarred – inside and out.”
He hurried out of the cottage before the other two men appeared, and made his way back to the venue where the extended Weasley/Potter families were finishing up their photos.
Clearly, there was a party, or a celebration of some sort, going on inside. Voices rose – male and female – and laughter, and an occasional chorus of “Hear hear!” accompanied by clicking glasses. After a long minute or two, John took Sherlock’s hand and urged him outside. John paused to open his umbrella – it had been raining for two days straight – but Sherlock forged ahead to the street, a cab materialized out of the mist and pulled over, and they settled themselves for the drive to Heathrow.
What did he think John, of all people in the world, of all the medical professionals available to someone of the Holmes brothers’ means, could do for him?
Brilliant, perhaps. Logical, from a certain perspective.
But this gate was low, more ornamental than functional. He could easily see over the top of it. Eyes wide with surprise, he leaned against the gate and stared.
John glared at Sherlock, mouthing
“He did.” Sherlock pocketed the key again. “He would prefer that the gate remain locked, though I think we happened upon this at the right time. He’s been working on that maze for some time, working out his demons. He was ready to share it - and he feels, I think, that you and I might understand.” He lifted his eyes and there was a fleeting sadness there that John hadn’t seen before. “He knows full well that I have my own demons, John, and he suspects, I’m sure, that you do as well.”
“Sure,” answered Lily. The younger generation had an uncanny knack for deciphering Sherlock’s magical work-around vocabulary. “A really strong Bubble-head charm will do it.”
“Well?” asked Sherlock smugly. “What did it say?”
“It isn’t very sanitary either,” Mycroft complained, kicking aside one of Sherlock’s dirty socks that had somehow ended up balled up in the sitting room. “You’d think a doctor’s flat would be tidier.”
And while more people came to Rosethorne than ever before, the walled garden was private. The guests could wander where they would, but the original garden gate was removed and the open space built up to close it in, and the manor guests were none the wiser. Greg planted a new maze closer to the main house, and as the shrubs grew tall enough, shaped ravens and falcons, owls and kestrels, atop each bush to serve as sentinels.
business. But it seems our Sherlock has got himself tangled up in it – again – and by extension now, his brother as well. Mycroft Holmes might think he’s the one calling the shots, but he’s wrong. Dead wrong. And now he owes his life to me, and to his brother. I intend to take advantage of that debt.”
“Miss Adler,” John repeated, looking up at Holmes with what he hoped was a neutral look. He waited, and Holmes looked at him disapprovingly, as if he expected John to better uphold his end of the conversation.
John squared his shoulders. But this -
Mum?” laughed Charlie. “Of course it’s all right – it’s my party, isn’t it, and she told me to invite my friends. Two o’clock, then?”
Hats to match each suit and two more, less formal, for every day outdoor use.
“I think I do,” John said. His gaze drifted skyward. On beautiful summer days like this one, it was unforgivably easy to forget that the world was at war. He frowned as the clouds above gave way to scorching, glaring sun and the grass beneath the bench burned away to blowing sand.
John gave Mycroft what he hoped was an understanding smile. Keeping one’s rooms and one’s person tidy was not exactly typical accidental magic, but John wisely didn’t point that out.
“It’s a Camelot theme,” Sherlock heard John explain. “He’s Merlin.”
But John narrowed his eyes at Sherlock and opened his laptop.
Sherlock brightened. “They made you promise too?” he asked.
He didn’t want to think of life without Sherlock.
As much as it stung to hear those words from Mycroft Holmes, especially in front of his commanding officer and Anderson, John couldn’t help but recognise the truth in them. Sherlock said that he, not Mycroft, had chosen John for his position at Rosethorne, but Mycroft had obviously presented Sherlock a list of candidates. Someone had created that list. Someone had culled through the possibilities.
“What is he
“Fresh out of dissidents here,” Minerva said. She shook her head as Mycroft began pulling up fistfuls of grass, but she was clearly more amused than upset. “But I do have an idea – meet me in my office as soon as you get him sorted – I have a detention to run and he’ll be a great asset. I’ll keep him busy while you mind your partner – I do hate leaving Professor Holmes unsupervised. The last time you stayed home on a Saturday morning, he dug up a crup Hagrid buried weeks before and the children dissected it on the faculty table in the Great Hall.”
He isn’t an overly sentimental man, more prone to lose his temper than to shed a tear, but 221B seems less like home now without Rosie, without Mrs. Hudson.
The sun had set and twilight lingered, the first stars just beginning to poke through in a sky wide and clear, when the car finally pulled off the main road and stopped before a pair of tall wrought iron gates. The driver beeped his horn twice and they waited – the driver not too patiently – until someone appeared to open the gates. The driver drove on without a thank you or a wave, and John glanced over to see the gateman staring at him with unabashed curiosity.
He’d never been just one before.
John holds a finger out and works it gently against his grandson’s clenched fingers. They open and promptly close around the finger and John smiles as if the child has expressed a preference for him above all others.
Sherlock will treasure the scarf always, and give it to John to wear from time to time until his scent once again permeates the woolen strands. With time, and with Sherlock at his side, the angry red sun will diffuse into softer hues of orange and gold, and the light of the crescent moon will fade away into the dawning day.
Sherlock threw in a one-shouldered shrug but didn’t say a word.
world of the tunnel was a cold-hearted reminder, John thought, a glass of ice water thrown in his face. The world above wasn’t going to stop spinning because of stolen moments in the dark. And those moments, he realised, no matter how frequently stolen, would continue to be like sandbars in a swollen river, safe shores that were there one moment and gone the next.
“Sholto. What do you know of him, Sherlock?”
“I was shot in the left shoulder three months ago,” he explained. “I  injured my hand when I fell, but they missed the hand injury and didn’t catch it for several days. I have limited mobility and very little strength in it.”
“Real then.”
“Dr. Watson. Though what good it will do to bring me back when I’ve only just begun to restructure my Mind Palace I don’t know. And the new system I have in place is rudimentary at best.”
Yet – it was clear that Sherlock had been in over his head. Far over his head.
Listening, on one particular occasion, to the tragic story of how Sherlock’s grandmother had died here at Rosethorne from something as ridiculous as a bee sting, while walking among the roses in one of the gardens.
Holmes’ face remained impassive and disinterested, and if he betrayed himself at all, it was with the time he took to answer.
“Master Holmes says to come at once, and to bring your bag,” Annie instructed, looking flustered. She stood at John’s door, nervously waiting, while he shrugged into his jacket and grabbed his bag. “He’s sent away both Simon and Greg,” she whispered as he followed her into the corridor. She took an unexpected turn, and he realized they weren’t headed to the usual parlour. “It’s odd, it is. All this secrecy every time he turns up with that tall major.”
And here he is, going on sixty years old, examining foundations, admiring crown moulding, opening dampers and measuring closet space. He finds himself enjoying the process immensely as the idea of actually living in a real house, with the sea so close you could nearly taste it in the air, takes root in his soul.
“I say that because I am frustrated,” Holmes said. “When he finally began to make progress, he made it quickly. Mobility. Speech. Reading. His violin. He plays better now than he ever did, and he was more than gifted before. So why -
“Stay with you, of course,” Sherlock said.
John would have felt utterly ridiculous had everyone else not looked so utterly silly as well.
ooOOOoo
“I don’t know your schedules – I’m not your secretary,” she said briskly, and not very truthfully. She may not be their secretary but she absolutely knew their schedules. “But go on now – he’s in a mood.”
“I have no idea how this happened but please take him back to the Ministry, reverse it and … no. Better yet, take him back to the Ministry and find him a new family.”
Sherlock dropped back into the wheelchair, looking oddly deflated. “Old friend,” he muttered. “Well, better to say I worked with him. He’s – he’s helped me in the past. And I him. I knew he was here, of course. But gardening? Are you quite certain?”
Sherlock extended a hand, but Mycroft pulled his own away a few inches. “You’ll go alone, Sherlock. The doctor is needed here.”
She was comfortably warm beside him, their shoulders and hips touching.
He shouldn’t have left the room without trying to sort out the problem of Lestrade
Billy was rough around the edges. Very rough, even in the tailored but serviceable clothing. John couldn’t begin to imagine him caring for an elderly man – or woman. He seemed more the type to run errands, or tiptoe about the house listening in doorways. John could see him
- died there with his father off in prison and his mother sick and dying and David dead and buried. There’d been no more room after that for what he wanted. What
“My mum likes that one too.”
.” He gazed at John with unabashed interest. “And quite astute about my brother, though that certainly not something he advertises publicly. Odd that you picked it up.”
“Tell me what you know about him,” demanded John. “It’s not as if I have any secrets - not after your brother’s exhaustive background check.”
“I’ve already told you – he wasn’t there, and then he was. It surprised me. I lost my footing. Accidents happen, Sherlock. Maybe the carpet is coming loose.”
Mycroft’s mouth twitched as he attempted to hold his expression.
“What?” He was having great difficulty thinking clearly – he’d been sleeping deeply when he’d been so rudely interrupted.
Sherlock laughed. The sound, like the chuckle before, echoed oddly in the gloomy stillness of this forgotten space. “Or better yet - a bottle of wine shared in the garden under the stars?”
John’s idea, when it came, didn’t come all at once. It took its time to worm its way around his brain as the pieces all began to fall together.
“Then what’s the problem? You have a wardrobe full of bespoke suits and form-fitting shirts in nearly every colour of the rainbow. So what if you don’t have what amounts to a cassock with a thousand buttons on it? Wear something that screams Sherlock Holmes and stop trying to be Severus Snape.”
“Elmo,” suggested John, half-hoping that that moniker might replace what he considered his grandson’s most unfortunate name. It wasn’t a common wizarding name, it turned out, and the entire Potter-Weasley family had quickly latched onto it when it was first suggested.
at all for more than a month.”
Sherlock slowly opened his eyes and regarded John with unveiled interest and approval.
“Yes I like to walk – when I have someplace to go!”
John glanced at her, grinning. “Oh, I seriously doubt that.”
Too long since he’d kissed a man, since he’d felt the scrape of beard on his cheek and long fingers on his jaw. Too long since he’d had to battle for control, since the body grinding against his own had been hard and angular, all hips and thigh and lean muscles and strong arms.
Arthur appeared to be swimming in a field, and Molly collided with Janes and Scorpio Malfoy while practicing the pencil move. The Potter family – Harry and his children and his ex-wife Ginny - were naturals and managed to look graceful and polished even while doing gravity-restricted somersaults.
He pulled his hand away, as gently as he could, and positioned it over the keyboard
John doesn’t admit to Sherlock that even he finds little William to be the eighth wonder of the world. He’s in a better place now, and the memory of his wife’s past and Sherlock’s near death at her hands has faded with time, glazed over with the life they began together on the day they waltzed across the floor with Rosie between them.
“Thank you.” John was careful to look Holmes in the eye as he spoke. He was all-too-familiar with power plays.
Rosie’s head swiveled to the door expectantly, but no Sherlock appeared. John soon turned up a toy Sherlock had brought home for Rosie – a stuffed bee with burlap wings and a felt body. The fact that it was a cat toy – complete with catnip stuffing and a bell on the exaggerated stinger the perfect size for jamming up a nostril  – hadn’t rattled Sherlock an iota.
“Actually, I think I’ll stay home today,” John said as Sherlock reminded him of their scheduled departure time for Hogwarts. “This place is a shambles. We’re not only out of milk – we’re out of everything, and Mrs. Hudson’s birthday is tomorrow and someone’s got to get her a gift and make that shortbread she likes so much.”
fur!“ He grabbed at one of Sherlock’s wrists but Sherlock evaded him. “And good job planting ‘em– but where did you get ‘em?”
“I don’t intend to explain myself, Dr. Watson. My business is strictly that -
He frowned, tucking the thought away for further study at a later time.
? Because you need him? Anything to keep him from becoming too bored with the project? Enough distraction to take away the edge but not enough to put him off the project altogether?”
to me,” he hissed. Moonlight from the window illuminated his face, and John’s foggy brain tried to reconcile the attacker’s masculine voice and feminine attire. He blinked – he’d have sworn Molly Hooper had ambushed him, except for what was clearly a very masculine torso pressing down against his own.
“I’ll list them all then, since you’re such a spoil sport. The smell of the hive, their intricate society, that they never sleep, that they’re the only animal that produces something consumed by humans, that they are responsible for 80% of all pollination, they’re super navigators, they can recognize human faces, they …”
“You’ve known him long, then? Did you work for him in London?”
“Everyone join hands again,” Lee instructed. “Let’s finish this so we can get up in the air.”
This was not news to Minerva.
Emilio chooses an apple, polishes it on his shirt, and bites into its golden flesh. It tastes like sunshine, and life, and bright stars in dark skies. It tastes like gentle rain, and warm hugs, and the glorious discovery of a new and wonderful friend.
“You can have as much of me as you want,” John said. “Feel free to overdose.”
When Sherlock and Lestrade had shaken themselves out of their moment, John had stepped forward.
“Completely out of the question,” said Sherlock, speaking as if the matter were settled.
He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
Chapter 23 is a lot of John introspection - but it sets the tone for the second and final part of this story, which I allude to at the end of the chapter.
“You did. You were devoted to her.“
“Classsified,” Sherlock said, tight-lipped, through his steepled hands.
It happens sometimes – you can’t prevent it, no matter how inconvenienced you may feel. Minding your own business in your own flat, perhaps watching television, or reading a book, or cooking your dinner, or soaking in the bath. The door opens, no matter that you locked it – you’re quite sure you locked it – and the person on the other side blinks in confusion, glances round the room trying to sort things out, or stares at you as if you’re a great ogre or a six-legged alien. They always back right out again, sometimes without uttering a word, and sometimes with a fumbled apology, or a stifled scream and usually with a look of utter confusion, as if they expected to walk into a clinic’s examining room and got you instead.
And that thing – that protective beast, roared again, and he disguised his concern for irritation. “Are you feeling alright? Did you eat?”
He supposes he loved John before he had a word for the feeling, before he understood this sentiment that had crept its way into his heart. He couldn’t name this mysterious force that made him both light on his feet and stone cold terrified.
Sherlock was lying in bed, left leg encased in a plaster cast that nearly reached his hip. His face and hands were swollen and coloured with healing bruises and contusions. He looked, John thought, like he’d been on the losing side of a pub brawl.
, John. I have eyes and ears everywhere.”
As weddings go, at least in his experience of weddings, this one wasn’t bad at all.
“Bee in the tree,” John said with a smile.
Sherlock smiled down at the baby who was still on his lap and not returned to his mother. “Did you hear that, Hamish? Pond water. And perhaps Grandpa John can bring other bodily fluids and tissue samples home from the surgery for our investigation.”
Mycroft expected he’d be needed again.
The scent of Clair de la Lune will never completely leave him.
He tried not to let his mind wander too far as he sat in this garden with Sherlock. He insisted they both walk several circuits around it when they arrived before setting Sherlock loose with the bees. John had found a piece of crumbled walkway where the paving stones had shifted up, compressed and crumbled, and he sat there on the ground, piecing the puzzle back together with his left hand. It was tedious and painful, making his fingers close around bits of stone, wedging them back in place awkwardly after clearing the rubble and smoothing the surface. He used the trowel, the same one that had seemed to evoke a forgotten memory in Sherlock, but when he asked Sherlock about it, Sherlock just shook his head and looked away.
The first was a personal letter, addressed to Dr. John Watson. He glanced at the signature. Mycroft Holmes. He quickly tucked it behind the other papers, noticing how closely Billy and Mrs. Hudson were watching him.
“I’m rather good at that, actually,” he said, his chest expanding proudly. “We should give them toothbrushes, and have them start with the smelly old loo nearest the castle doors…”
“Hello John.”
He didn’t make his way back to the other wing, despite his stated intention. Instead, he slipped outside, breathing deep gulps of fresh air and walking quickly and deliberately down the bricked garden path that led along the drive. After a time, he veered off along the ivy-covered garden wall that led to the locked gate.
Mycroft returns to Rosethorne, and John gets a new commanding officer.
The tunnel, too, remained their secret. The guests talked of a manor ghost, a benevolent spirit who crept along the corridors at night, creaking floorboards, opening locked doors and magically reviving wilted flowers in the vases on the breakfast tables. No one suspected that it was Sherlock who sometimes haunted the halls after dark, or John who followed behind him with an armload of fresh flowers which grew in such abundance now in their garden. Sherlock’s bees, now housed in a row of hives against the wall beyond the maze, helped the flowers along, buzzing heavily  from bloom to bloom in speckled garden sunlight.
“Very well. I’ll let Mr. Holmes know that Dr. Watson has other commitments.”
“Magic!” said Lee with a broad smile. “We can gain an extra minute – maybe more – by slowing the velocity of the group once you’ve all joined hands.” Enough time for the traditional wizarding bonds to be completed before we land and move on to the modified Muggle ceremony.”
“We are interested, Captain Watson, in your prognosis regarding Sherlock’s health.”
In the last chapter, Sherlock and John found a tunnel connecting the "war room" where Sherlock was now working with Molly to Hawthorne, the guest cottage at Rosethorne, where Sherlock's great-grandfather had once kept his mistress. During the walk through the tunnel, they'd finally rid themselves of all the UST accumulated during the first 21 chapters of Rosethorne. However, when they emerged through another wardrobe into the dressing room in the cottage, Sherlock had suffered an epileptic attack.
“At first, I thought we’d get out of there without incident. He cooperated – he was dazed, but he came with me quietly enough, and climbed through the window. But something happened once we were on the roof in the open air - Mycroft wouldn’t go down the ladder. He’d been doped up to make him dependent and he was in need of a fix. He insisted we go back inside and find Moriarty. He became violent and attacked me. I lost my balance and slid toward the edge. He launched himself at me and we both went over.”
He didn’t pay much attention to the path she took through the corridors, only noting that they passed through an open atrium of sorts, full of plants and sparkling clean windows through which the morning sun poured, and ended in a small sitting room-turned-office which felt, for lack of a better word, homey.
“They’d give you an office job, brother dear. You’d like it even less.”
He pocketed it nonetheless, and continued walking. The key might be useless, but it was an interesting story, one that perhaps Sherlock could suss out later tonight in the garden.
“Boring?” John frowned. “That’s hardly an answer to – ”
But he thought she didn’t look convinced, and he saw her looking at him speculatively more than once that morning as she made the rounds, introducing him to each patient, and watching them interact with unveiled interest.
John glanced around the room. Simon had closed the door behind him, leaving them alone in the room. The silence was awkward, so he held up his medical bag.
“B’hind you,” Sherlock muttered.
are to do everything possible to enable Sherlock to do
helping. For not hovering. It’s – refreshing.”
Sherlock rattled the gate despite having judged the lock secure, then stood there, studying it carefully as if determining whether scaling it would be possible. The gate was quite sturdy, eight feet tall and topped with pointed iron bars set mere inches apart. Scaling it would have certainly been possible were either of them in the physical condition they’d been in before the war, but with John’s injury and Sherlock’s present condition, they’d need a very tall ladder on one side only to face a significant drop on the other.
He cut himself off with a huff. He didn’t need to clutter his mind with the type of biscuits Sherlock Holmes favoured.
John quickly stepped over and studied the lock.
“I thought that being outside would distract you from the project,” John said at last. “I hoped that your mind would have a better chance to heal if you could just get away from the notes and locked doors and the stale air of the manor.” It sounded like he was admitting defeat, confessing to a plan doomed to failure, and Sherlock squeezed his hand again.
“Something’s happened – John is needed, correct?”
William will learn the melody looping from John’s mobile, though he’ll love it most on the violin. He’ll know it means to go fetch a book and snuggle on the sofa with one grandfather or the other and often with both. And sometimes he’ll fall asleep on his granddad’s shoulder as they sway lazily around the sitting room. His world is very small now, but theirs has expanded tenfold.
“Are you thirsty?”
He wanted to be able to play the note consistently. He wanted the same timbre each time he pressed the key, wanted it to resonate clearly, sink into his skin, into the expensive carpet beneath his feet. He wanted it to sound true.
“I’m not sure why you want to know what it’s like practicing medicine in wartime, much less in the desert. I don’t think you need a mind palace to understand that it’s hot, and quick, and dirty, and just enough – sometimes. Sometimes you can’t do a damn thing to save them – they were doomed before they arrived. You have to be fast – nimble-handed and nimble-minded. You’ve got to make quick decisions – right or wrong – and stick with them. And more often than not, you’re cutting off a boy’s leg, or his arm, and I used to do it without even thinking. About what kind of life he’d have when he got home – if he got home. Keep them alive – that’s what we do. That’s what we did, or tried to do, anyway. And sometimes you don’t get any sleep at all. And you hear the guns all the time, even when they’re not firing. They’re in your ears, like a permanent echo, just like the wind, and the sand against your skin. And I wasn’t even right there – we stayed well behind the lines, advancing or retreating as they did. Sometimes a few miles back, sometimes closer if we were losing ground quickly.”
He had his bag with him – he’d finished his rounds today with the general’s check-up and had stayed after for their usual game of chess.
He pressed his lips to John’s hand, and John sighed, even as the feeling of Sherlock’s lips branding his skin imprinted itself on his heart.
“Sherlock – are you alright?”
Sherlock gave a dissatisfied hmph, but began to unbutton his shirt, pealing it off and dropping it atop his trousers while he quickly put on the shirt John had brought. He buttoned it, then stretched out his arms to show John several inches of exposed wrist.
Ten seconds of utter terror with an adrenaline high to match anything he’d ever done with Sherlock on the streets of London. He was catching up with Al and Rosie, whose chutes had deployed, when his own chute opened and jerked him upward.
On Tuesday they end the day with a rambling cottage with ill-placed rooms but situated on the perfect piece of land. They discuss it over dinner – can the cottage be remodeled? Expanded? Sherlock is worried that the level changes inside – a step or two or three here and there – are exactly what they don’t need but he can’t deny that the hives would flourish on that beautiful piece of heaven.
“My body double,” Sherlock whispered, dropping the wig onto the dresser top and shrugging out of the frilly dressing gown. He draped it over the back of a chair and reached for his own gown, tying the sash and bidding John to follow him as he moved to the door leading to Wiggins’ room. John could see now that it was Wiggins himself sleeping in Sherlock’s bed. He’d not noticed before that the two men were of similar height, weight and complexion and one could pass for the other in near darkness.
“Where are we in here, then?” John asked, studying the manor’s building footprint on the schematic.
“You saw the loophole, though, right?” asked John. He glanced at the sky – they’d have an early moon tonight, but dusk was rapidly settling and they should be getting inside soon. But conversation was so easy now, with Sherlock transported to childhood and talking about the very garden that had been on his mind so much of late, that he pushed aside the urgency and let Sherlock go on.
“Yes, mind palace.” Sherlock hummed out a sigh. “A mental construct.
John didn’t reply immediately. Sherlock was obviously exhausted by the effort to rebuild what he’d lost, but, as far as John could tell, this had been his exact situation for months, even before he formally began to work again for British military intelligence. What was different now? What exactly did Sherlock have to
“What about Harry?” John asked, wondering if Sherlock had had a blow to the head.
“Boss – you can’t….” He struggled with the words. He was clearly not accustomed to having anyone rattle the rules that had been laid down regarding Sherlock.
“I’m not making progress,” Sherlock said as he dropped onto the bench beside John. He frowned as he tested the bench’s strength, but settled in with a sigh.
“Five,” corrected Sherlock.
“Good - very good.” Sherlock glanced at him, and John thought he looked pleased, if a bit surprised. But Sherlock soon went back to studying the tree. He seemed particularly interested in the tree growth around the boards, but he stepped away and gazed up, perhaps estimating its height.
The door to the loo pushes open and Sherlock emerges. He hardly pauses as he slips by John and heads down the corridor, but John hesitates. He watches Sherlock for a moment, then pulls open the door just enough to look inside.
“What?
“I miss London,” Sherlock admitted. “Life is altogether too slow here, and before you appeared, utterly boring as well. I appreciate you humoring me.”
Sherlock took another sip of the very delicious lemonade and felt curls of fire buzz pleasantly through his extremities. “Am I going to remember any of this tomorrow?” he asked her as the figures on brooms raced and dove and performed moves that defied both gravity and science.
The crow in question had flown off the fountain to find a perch in a tree whose branches hung over the wall. They both watched it hop down to a lower branch then spread its wings and caw, once again, in John’s direction.
“Go – please. Sherlock has likely offended the entire staff by now, and will be insisting he doesn’t need the care he requires and should be returned to his own quarters. The staff will be as happy to see you as Sherlock will be.”
He was interrupted mid-sentence by heavy footsteps on the stairs followed by a firm rap on the door and a loud high-pitched shriek.
John opened his laptop, mostly ignoring Sherlock.
“Three days, Sherlock.”
“She had an attack while playing in the water near the shore. You were sleeping on the sand.”
“Your – what did you call it – mind palace?” John watched Sherlock curiously. Mary had never wanted to talk like this after a seizure, not to John, and certainly not to herself. She wanted to rest – to sleep – curled up beside John on the sofa, or wrapped in his arms in bed. She’d wanted the contact, the comfort, but not the mental task of sorting out words and ideas. She was always better the next day, after a night in his arms.
“Oh, Doctor. Surely you’ve been in the army long enough to know that men have needs, and they find ways to satisfy those needs in times of war as well as in times of peace. And certain men have
Sherlock actually paused to consider. “No,” he said. “Which makes sleep difficult. So humour me – one more reason.”
“So, did you deduce Severus too while you were attached to him?”
with him?
John reddened. “I’m sorry - I... I just assumed. You don’t - didn’t ever - speak about her. She’s not come to visit, has she?” He realised the question was more of an accusation, and looked away with a shrug.
“I developed blisters.”
John is shaking his head with one of those fond smiles, the sort he reserves only for Sherlock. Sherlock raises an eyebrow at his muttered “idiot” and shrugs.
“Nor am I your commanding officer. Left hand, please.”
He thought his resolve would last, but as it turned out, he didn’t know Sherlock Holmes very well at all.
“Do you think I have time to grow a beard? Wizards look distinguished with beards.”
They’d sat there long after the game was over, sipping scotch they’d pilfered from Mycroft’s office, breaking in like two school boys, muffled whispers as Sherlock picked the lock, giggling like school boys as they secured their booty. They talked freely - no need for games at this point, when lips were loose and guts were warm with the drink, brains just beginning to blur at the edges.
Severus closed his journal and sighed. Somehow, he looked perfectly at home in an aeroplane with a parachute strapped to his back. “I could modify his memories to make him believe he’s an experienced skydiver,” he suggested.
The door closed softly, and as he watched, Sherlock Holmes calmly walked over and slid onto the piano bench beside him.
“You weren’t just sleeping, John. You wouldn’t have been. It’s not in your make-up.”
“He won’t give it to you or he won’t give it to anyone?” John asked. He couldn’t count the times Sherlock had pored over footage he had no business having.
“Sherlock, I can’t take you anywhere,” Rosie said with an exaggerated sigh.
“Queerpitch” he repeated slowly. “Sherlock – it’s a sport. With balls? Teams of seven?”
Molly and John exchanged a glance, but returned their focus to Sherlock as he spun on the spot.
Sherlock pounced on the information like a cat on a mouse who’d just been dipped into a can of tuna.
Sherlock plays until he’s banished every fear and misgiving into the far corners of his mind. He’s not wrong – everything will be different from now on. John’s leg will grow stronger, but never quite strong enough. In time, John’s struggles with the stairs will do Sherlock in far before John is ready to give up. They’ll leave 221B and move to a cottage in Sussex. John, not ready for retirement, will take on work at a local clinic. Sherlock will putter in the garden and take up beekeeping.  They’ll grow old together there, and Sherlock will play for John on sleepless, melancholic nights when they’re both restless for something more. It will become their new normal, and the weight Sherlock carries with him will feel lighter with time, ballast to stabilize the load he carries instead of anchor to drown him in guilt and might-have-beens.
He’d turned his mobile off until noontime, and when he turned it on he looked at John’s blog on a whim.
“Rosie and Al will be in different planes this time. They’ll jump at the same time and meet in the middle. The rest of you follow very quickly in order and head toward the happy couple. We’ll be monitoring with our wands from the planes while – ”
Understandably, it took some time to get things sorted with Molly.
John crossed his feet on the ottoman and fiddled with the TV remote with one hand.
He’d been hurrying down the stairs on his way to the shops, hoping to get there and back before Sherlock got home, when the sudden and unexpected appearance of a man dressed in black at the bottom of the stairs, seemingly out of nowhere, startled him so much that he’d lost his footing and tumbled down the stairs.
With an unnecessary flare, he extracted an envelope from his inside breast pocket and held it out to John. Despite his initial flinch, John managed to keep the stoic look on his face as he accepted the envelope, extracted a single sheet of paper and scanned it.
Molly moved past him then, until she was close enough to Sherlock to reach out and touch him. He shifted uncomfortably as she took the conversation in an unexpected direction.
it. You were injured in the attack, and you weren’t able to speak immediately after –you choked on the dust and debris. It damaged your throat. But you
He stared back.
“His co-workers gave him the name Magpie,” Sholto continued. “Did you know the magpie is afraid of shiny objects?”
“John?” asked Sherlock. A long moment had passed and John had done nothing save blink several times.
“She’s shagging Scorpius’ father too,” John murmured very quietly so that only Sherlock could hear him.
“I already told you I never learned to play,” she said, dusting over the keys with her free right hand. “My mum wanted me to, but I wanted to dance so I took ballet.”
“I could. I just did.” Sherlock took one last curious look at the treehouse above then settled stiffly to the ground, leaning against the tree as he drew his knees up and wrapped his arms around them. “My mind is all I have as I recover physically from an attack. I learned techniques to clear it - to keep it sharp - many years ago. It might be fuzzy after a seizure, but it doesn’t
