John rushed to the kitchen to put away the groceries, hoping that Sherlock would not notice him until he was well away and under control.
"This tea is awful. It's too sweet. You didn't level the sugar off when you added the two teaspoons, so I have about eleven grams of sugar in my tea instead of the regular eight. That's almost a forty percent increase in sugar." He slammed the offending cup onto the coffee table, stacked high with papers, slopping a bit down the side of the porcelain.
Sherlock Holmes: BECAUSE I'M THINKING, JOHN.
"You walked in on me masturbating in the shower. I heard the door open, I heard you urinate, and then you left rather quickly. Did I make you uncomfortable?"
Sherlock stood on the coffee table, the papers all thrown aside hastily. He had moved the table so that it was against the wall, like a small stage.
The Woman: Yep. Want some?
Sherlock turned off the nozzle and crouched down next to John. “Shh. Shhh… it’s alright. You’re doing fantastic. You’re over halfway there, John! You’re doing so good. It’s almost over, I promise.”
"If you think you can just sneak out, you're wrong."
Sherlock shut his mouth. That wasn't quite the response he was expecting. Maybe he had underestimated the amount of irritation he had caused John throughout the past week. He quickly stood and shuffled through the kitchen and hallway, opening the door to his bedroom and ducking in.
Sherlock cried out, knees buckling under him. He fell to the hardwood floor, hands gripping the duvet in the valiant attempt not to touch his twitching prick.
He sauntered back over to John, calm and confident. John wished he could siphon some of his aura and use it as his own.
"No, that's... good," Sherlock mumbled. "Faster."
It was Sherlock's turn to blush. "Ah. So quite enjoyable then."
“Your wristwatch says otherwise,” Holmes mumbled, eyes flickering down to John’s Rolex.
John Watson: Fine. I'll be right there
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply but before he could get anything out, John wrapped his hand around Sherlock's cock and squeezed up. The detective groaned, head falling back.
"Don't pretend you haven't thought about this," Sherlock smirked, reaching out and unzipping my trousers. I let out another gasp as my cock stirred.
Sherlock's jaw clenched. "Ever a soldier, John," he smirked, bending down to pick up and fold his clothes and giving John quite a pretty view indeed.
Lestrade cocked an eyebrow. "Right. You okay?"
Sherlock nodded, eyes closed. "It just feels... Give me just a moment." They laid in silence for a few seconds before Sherlock finally muttered, "Okay. Faster."
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Oh, well actually your deduction is a bit off Mr Holmes...I happen to be an INFJ personality.
Sherlock took a shuddering breath as John rotated his hips, his thumb rubbing over his sensitive head. "I'm your slut, your dirty little slut, and I want your cock up my ass and down my throat and- oh FUCK, right there." His knees nearly gave out as John brushed his prostate. "Oh my God, oh fucking hell, yessss..."
A particularly interesting conversation... dedicated to St. Spike, King Artoria Pendragon on ShamChat.
After about five minutes of his gentle, thorough kneading, his hands went to his navel and rested. "No signs of cancer," Sherlock reported, slightly breathless. His impossibly grey eyes met mine; his pupils were dilated. Not that I needed any more proof that he was aroused; his cock was half-hard and he hadn't even touched it.
John sniffed and, bouncing on the balls of his feet, looked away. Yes, Sherlock was acting, but it was a rather good act, and John was notoriously jealous. He would have no qualms about dragging Sherlock into the nearest bathroom and fucking him senseless, but he thought it would be best to avoid that.
John unzipped his trousers and pulled out his half-erect cock, spitting into his hand and stroking it slowly. Just as he was getting to his full length, Sherlock walked in.
Holmes’ smile widened. “Yes, a medical doctor. I think it would suit you better. You seemed to excel in the blood typing and autopsy parts of my class.” He stepped closer and closer to John, seemingly unaware of how uncomfortable he was.
"No you don't," Sherlock replied, looking up at me. His eyes were dark, the pupils nearly eclipsing the light blue irises. "You want to fuck my mouth."
He hailed a cab and yanked the door open. "Take me to the bar down the block. Quickly." John grated out to the cabbie.
This is a conversation between John Watson and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock glanced down at his still prominent (and bare) arousal. "I'm up for anything at the moment. I think rational conversation is off the table at the moment."
John Watson: SHERLOCK
Sherlock Holmes: ;)
Sherlock grinned gleefully. "Mycroft's."
"Who do you belong to?" John whispered, eyes closing and face screwing up as he pushed further and further into Sherlock.
King Artoria Pendragon: Greetings.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: You've got it all wrong sir, I don't just like criminals...It's only him that I like. It doesn't mean I have a type.
"I've told you already that you are not cumming. Do not ask again," John said sharply. The hand that had just hit Sherlock now gripped the detective's cock again, squeezing gently upwards.
Sherlock was squirming beneath John, panting. "Touch... me," he groaned. "John, please... Make me feel... aah..."
John Watson: What? I don't even turn it on! How can you hear the from my room if I haven't turned it on for months?
Sherlock's smirk widened as he dramatically stepped off the table, leaning over John uncomfortably close as the brief music break concluded.
He took him deeper, relaxing his throat as he remembered. Slowly he took in his entire cock, breathing heavily through his nose so he wouldn't need to get a breath.
Sherlock Holmes: My mind is too busy to be bothered with rubbish like physical movement.
John's hand flew up and away from Sherlock's body, his cock left bobbing and twitching and dribbling onto his abdomen.
"Does this have to be now?" I asked, shifting uncomfortably.
I wasn't sure if I was more upset that he knew or relieved that he seemed to have been thinking about it. "I said no more deductions," I snarked half-heartedly, grinning like a loon. Finally: "I thought I'd let you choose. Seeing as it is your ring."
King Artoria Pendragon: Well I used to rule over England.
John smiled, his cock twitching at Sherlock's arousal. Jesus, he needed to built up stamina if this was to be a thing. "I would. I'd pull down your trousers, lick that pretty bum of yours until you screamed, and then fuck you until you couldn't cum any more."
John slowly pulled out, pressing his mouth to Sherlock's only once his tip was the only part remaining inside him. Sherlock kissed him back with equal fervor, tongue trailing his lips.
"Well, I'm thick and you're not good at subtlety. Too... subtle."
Herpes, AIDS, and STDs he quickly pushed away. John wouldn't... Of course not. He wouldn't be that careless.
"Fucking- John!" Sherlock cried. "Unless you want me to- shit! John!"
“What- now?” John asked, irritated by his hammering heart and growing arousal. HE LIKED BOOBS, DAMN IT.
Sherlock chuckled. “Yes, it will be. I can teach you things you never dreamed about, John. But that’s for another time.”
Sherlock Holmes: Alright then. Will you come down and fetch my scarf? I'm about ready to head out but it's in my room.
"When was this?"
But then, Sherlock held the microphone up to his mouth and began to sing. "You let me violate you, you let me desecrate you, you let me penetrate you, you let me complicate you-"
Sherlock laughed, and the next thing he remembered was curling up next to John.
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human has left the conversation.
Sherlock Holmes: Long time, no see.
John smiled and stood slowly, sauntering over to Sherlock. "Look at you. I say the word and you take off all your clothes like a slut. Are you a slut, Sherlock?" He said the offending word slowly, pronouncing every letter individually.
"Yes. God... yes."
Hiro Hamada: I can identify every single type of metal, and lab made metal in existence, and what they are used for.
He was surprisingly rough with himself, the small part of John's brain that wasn't in total shutdown mode observed. One long fingered hand was wrapped around his cock, seemingly intent to rip it off himself, and his other hand was occupied with one of his dusky nipples, twisting and pulling harder than John would've ever dared.
John Watson: I didn't know you came on these things...
Amazingly quickly, Sherlock was pressing his lips to John’s. They stumbled backward into an open door which Sherlock closed by kicking. The feeling of Sherlock’s trousers against his bare cock was making him remember his former arousal, and John deepened the kiss. His tongue traced Sherlock’s lower lip, who opened his mouth eagerly to receive him.
"Was that really your first kiss?"
Sherlock's eyes were intense and he leaned forward. "I was in the privacy of our bathroom, taking a shower. I shouldn't need to keep myself in check when social rules dictate I be left alone anyway. But regardless, that's not what I meant."
Sherlock Holmes: Just relaying information.
"Love, would you like to ride my cock?" John asked, breathing uneven.
Jim Moriarty: No, I think it is the point exactly. Have you told John yet?
This is a conversation between The Woman and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
The sound John's tongue made as it fucked Sherlock was obscene. His balls ached, so he reached down and rubbed at his poor cock, unable to wait any longer.
Sherlock Holmes: Good.
Sherlock looked up again, slightly impatient. "Yes, I'm aware, John. Certain words stir memories for me, some stronger than others. Unless you want me to rip off my clothes and jack off in the living room, I'm going to refrain from saying it."
wolowitz: it is an honor Mr. holmes
I sniffed, willing my cock to behave. I had to keep in mind the reason that I was in this situation at all. "I'm not leaving," I said again. The corner of Sherlock's mouth twitched.
Sherlock blushed, blinking innocently at John. "Yes. It was well worth the wait."
Sherlock Holmes: Hello.
"Stop thinking," John mumbled, smirking up at the detective. His eyes were dark and bottomless and he could see why all the women fell for him, with his 'come fuck me' gaze and-
Sherlock paused again. “Probably The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He was a brilliant writer. You should read his novels. And your favourite?”
Sherlock Holmes: Stubborn as a proverbial mule.
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: I'm a high school student
Then both hands were fumbling with the lube again, and he was pumping the dildo with his hand, getting it nice and wet so it could make an easier entrance. Without hesitation he plunged it into himself and his cock twitched, a small sigh escaping his lips as he pressed the button to turn on the vibrator.
Sam and Dean: Dean pulls the gun out and Sam stops him.
"John," Sherlock sighed, thrashing his head and pulling against his restraints. "Please, let me-"
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): Will do.
Sherlock snorted. "Of course not."
John released him just in time, and Sherlock let out a cry of frustration, hips thrusting uselessly in the air. John sat back, panting a little bit, rubbing his palm against his own achingly hard, clothed erection.
Sherlock nodded, curls bouncing, as he continuing his bobbing on John's dick.
John stood suddenly, abandoning his untouched coffee and bending over Sherlock. Sherlock looked up from his chair, uneasy and aroused and unsure of what came next. John grabbed the front of Sherlock's white shirt and yanked up so Sherlock was standing, then pulled his face down. He roughly pressed his lips to Sherlock's, grinding his stiff crotch against the other man's. The detective gasped, giving John a chance to slip his tongue in and claim Sherlock's mouth.
And then his mouth was gone, and he was pressing light kisses to my tip and my knees were weak. Jesus.
Sherlock reached in his pocket, fished out a twenty pound note, and nearly slammed it into the counter.
"I understand," Sherlock cried impatiently. "Just hurry."
Sherlock Holmes: What's that in your pocket? A *hic* gun, or are you just *hic* happy to see me?
A shaky "okay?" had barely fallen out of my mouth before his lips were sliding down my shaft and I was completely in his mouth again and his tongue swirled, swirled, and he sucked, and Jesus Christ he knew how to give head.
Sherlock opened the door and walked to the sink, washing his hands. "Did I hurt you? Are you angry?" Sherlock asked quietly.
Sherlock Holmes: I expected you to say *hic* both.
He grabbed Sherlock's cock and began stroking it with quick, concise strokes. Every time he reached his head, he ran his thumb over the leaking slit. Sherlock whimpered, swiveling his hips.
This all took place in John's head over the course of about 1.38 seconds. There was no other option, unless relieving yourself in the sink was considered decent. John didn't consider it decent.
Sherlock whimpered again (God, he was starting to sound like a sad puppy) but remained quiet. John quickly added a third finger, pumping hard and fast.
John climbed on top of Sherlock, gently biting his earlobe.
Hiro Hamada: *rolls eyes* I don't need a mind palace. I just learn the stuff I need. Keep it practical. You ever built a microbot? *has the small thing that hit you earlier flying around* doesn't look like much, does it? Oh trust me. This thing can crush a car. Two can topple a building. Now imagine it in the swarm. I have an army of /millions/ of those things. And yes, I made them, not stole them. And yes, I am fourteen.
"It is a strange feeling, isn't it. Don't worry, it'll feel better in a few minutes."
Sherlock Holmes: I was... extremely confused. That doesn't happen often. But I was mainly pleased.
"Sherlock," John began very carefully, keeping his voice low, but before he could continue, the detective interjected.
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: That bitch better stay away from him *I mumble to myself*
"Okay. I'm okay."
John smiled. He'd never, in all his years with Sherlock, seen the detective so at a loss for words. It was rather endearing.
a troll: And for what evidence do you have to prove that I am nothing but a stubborn troll?
"Are you telling me there's absolutely nothing dangerous in your entire bedroom?" I asked skeptically, already knowing the answer.
And then John had his fist wrapped around Sherlock's cock and he was pumping him, wrist twisting and tugging, and John's hand was dry but it felt so good, Sherlock didn't care, as long as John kept doing exactly what he was doing.
Sherlock Holmes: You know Miss George?
Sherlock's entire body twitched. "Yes," he finally sighed.
“Yes,” John replied hesitantly.
He cleared his throat, casting a discreet look at John before continuing. "Except Paracetamol."
“Enema,” Sherlock mumbled, clenching his fists. “You need- fuck. Do you know where I live?”
Sherlock Holmes: Well, you went into your bedroom about an hour ago and I think I heard some very unbecoming videos playing. I think we need to have a chat about your addiction to porn.
Sherlock Holmes: So you find psychotic serial killers attractive? Interesting...
Nonetheless, he paused the season finale of Dr. Who and grabbed his mobile from the coffee table.
"Why do you ask?" John finally sighed, realizing Sherlock would not elaborate on his own.
"I don't-
Sherlock nodded, wriggling his bum to emphasize the point. "Come on, it's uncomfortable like this," he whined.
John leaned forward, mouth twisted into a smirk. "You're not the only kinky one in the room, Mr. Holmes."
"Say it."
"Like my big cock up your tight arse?"
John chuckled nervously, turning quickly to the bathroom door. He situated his hands, trying to cover his half-tented crotch. Sherlock had one towel secured firmly around his waist and another he was running over his black curls. "What do you mean?"
John fought the urge to deny it, but he knew better. Of course it was a bloody big deal, they'd had a bit of a snog and admitted feelings for each other.
Once he made it to the second digit, John scissored his fingers slightly, twisting them slowly. "God," Sherlock moaned, a long, drawn out sound that went straight to John's throbbing cock.
As John tilted his head back in silent relief, he heard a small noise from behind the shower door. It sounded like a whimper- was Sherlock hurt? Had he somehow fallen without John hearing?
Far past the clarity of mind to argue, Sherlock did just as he was told, lifting his hips rapidly and reaching one hand down to hold John's head in place. Fuck, this felt good... Why hadn't he ever let anyone do this to him before?
The cashier walked up to them. "Hi! What can I get you?"
Sherlock had stepped in on John naked. He had become aroused, maybe even hard. Maybe he was out in the hallway, just outside the bathroom door, face red as he fucked his own cock, biting his lip to keep quiet.
Sherlock Holmes: Or that you even truly existed!
Jim Moriarty: Well, I do.
Sherlock's eyes flew open and his hips jerked back. "Oh," he gasped. "John-"
"Do what?" Sherlock asked, eyes wide and pupils blown.
Sherlock opened his mouth, thought for a moment, then closed it. Another nod.
"Oh, an adrenaline junkie?" she asked, leaning forward. Even I could see the signs of her sudden interest in Sherlock.
"Could I hab sub soub?"
'Confirmed. Walked in on them just now in the bathroom at the cafe. Poor sods won't know what hit them.
Sherlock Holmes: Ah, it's a political affair. I see. I guess medieval England wasn't very female-friendly.
He sounded it. Not the type of angry that led to screaming and violence, but the dark, seething type of anger that built up overtime. His voice was quiet.
"Do you want... soup? Or tea?" I suggested, taking a few steps forward to straighten the blanket twisted around his ankles.
The blood was rushing to John’s head and cock painfully. His brain was clouded. “Y-Yes, sir,” he replied after a moment.
Sherlock Holmes: I knew the I and the F. I had to make an educated guess about the others.
a troll: SHERLOCK
Sherlock Holmes: One of? In Britain? I'm the best mind the world has ever seen.
Dedicated to stardustiseloquent... she was 'teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty' on ShamChat.com.
Hiro Hamada: Yeah, chip. *holds a hand into the air and the small bot flies up and into it* I was just resetting the magnetic compensate for the extra epidermal level, but carbon relay snapped due to the increase in input from the heightened sensors, to the quantum s- and you have no idea what I'm saying, do you?
Sherlock began riding John more vigorously, his head thrown back in silent ecstasy. John's hand was beginning to slow as his orgasm flew at him, and at the last second, he bucked his hips and hit Sherlock in a spot he couldn't quite reach on his own.
“How old are you?” John asked suddenly.
"Do you like being Dominant? Or did you just tolerate it?" Sherlock asked, slightly nervously. John smiled internally at his hesitance. Not often was Sherlock caught in such a position.
Sherlock Holmes: Did what?
"How'd I do? I felt as though I was a little sloppy, I'll need to practice relaxing my gag reflex, and I think my teeth got in the way a few times. Also, I didn't know what to do with my tongue-"
"Fuck, Sherlock, where did you learn that?" I finally panted after the stars had disappeared from my vision.
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Hi?
Both men burst into giggles, completely childish and ridiculous as it seemed. Once they had regained their composure, John got to the real question: "Why the hell were you singing that?"
Barista: Well, still that's pretty amazing
"But you just said you've never touched yourself," John said hesitantly.
Under his hands John felt his cock stir hopefully. He cleared his throat as well. "Um. Well, I'm going to take a shower."
And I was laughing, and he was laughing; we laughed for a few minutes, both covered in our own sex, until I finally broke the amicable silence: "You know, next time you want to wank in front of me, you don't need to go through the trouble of an overdose."
"Yes," Sherlock snapped. "Obviously you're too dim to have seen the face someone makes when they have a breakthrough."
John scooted over and patted the bed. "Make yourself comfortable. Pretend I'm not here. What do you think about when you're...?"
John whimpered, already so close. His cock was twitching in his rapidly moving fist. Fuck, he was like a horny teenager all over again.
“Twenty-six. And you?”
John groaned as Sherlock's tongue traced his lower lip, his hips grinding up to Sherlock's. He had only been gone a night, away at a conference in Brighton. What had happened between then and now?
"Yanking my hair and... smacking my... arse... before you- aagh- fuck me!"
Sam and Dean: Dean: Uh huh. Good for you. You okay buddy.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Oh, but Mr. Magnussen is dead now, so...I suppose that's one less enemy for you to have to deal with.
“I’m sorry, I know I di- what, what?” John stopped mid-sentence, realizing what his professor had just said. “Like, a DOCTOR doctor?”
Sherlock's eyes flickered to mine, slightly glossy and impossibly blue and brilliant. "Perhaps. She's at her sister's house for the weekend, left this morning."
Sherlock's mouth slowly rolled into a sensuous smile. His eyes were still intense and boring into John's. "Enjoy." He snapped the door shut and John sighed, idly pumping his now half-hard cock.
a troll: I DO GOOD.
It was nearly midnight before we got home from the party that Greg Lestrade had thrown (he had just moved into a new flat after filing for divorce with his wife. She'd been cheating on him with her personal trainer... again.)
Just as he had taken off his t-shirt and pants, the door banged open.
The detective woke up with a start, curly hair looking more like a sloppy nest or a small, dead mammal. "Sorry," he mumbled, rubbing his eyes with a sniffle. "Back so soon?"
Jim Moriarty: See, you're doing it again... told him YOU HAVE FEELINGS for him.
“Eh!”
By the time John had caught up to Sherlock, Lestrade was hanging up his phone and walking toward the two. John sniffed to hide a smile, fingering the small, fob-like remote in his coat pocket.
"Yes, pet. I need to prepare," John groaned. He squirted a generous amount of the lube into his hand and slowly stroked himself, making sure his entire shaft was coated with the clear jam-like stuff.
“Yes,” his professor replied. “An old friend.”
Sherlock Holmes: It was great talking you, honestly, but I must be off. I have to save London, possibly the world. You know, ordinary prople things.
Holmes jumped off his desk, dark brown curls bouncing slightly. He took a few steps toward John. “I wanted to talk to you about your future.”
As if to prove his point, Sherlock clenched his arse, and John's hips bucked. A string of swear words poured out of his mouth and he grabbed Sherlock's bony hips. Sherlock slowly stood until he was almost empty, and he sat down again, faster this time.
Sherlock didn't trust himself to speak, didn't trust himself to move, afraid even a slight draft of air would send him reeling through an orgasm.
John, still idly stroking his cock, slowly made his way to the stall. He found Sherlock exactly as he'd ordered, his perfect, round arse sticking out and his head bowed as he tried to even his breathing. John could see his very hard cock twitching against his stomach.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: He's clever, interesting, unique, of course very handsome...
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): Not exactly..
Sherlock Holmes: Your short little arms limit you, just as the rolls of fat limit my brother.
Sherlock Holmes: May I ask who you are? I'm not familiar with the name.
Sherlock's eyes flashed. "I am plenty reasonable, John. Reasonable enough for both of us, luckily for you."
"I want you to fuck me," Sherlock nearly whimpered, suddenly feeling very small and unprepared.
His legs stiffened as his hips jerked off the leather chair, cum spurting over his fingers onto his abdomen. John leaned back, wiping his mouth with the back of one hand as he tossed off with the other. He was getting dangerously close already, and Sherlock staring at him like a debauched sex god was not helping.
John smiled, kissing the top of Sherlock's head. "Of course, love. Put your clothes on and we'll leave right now."
Sherlock blushed, his alabaster skin tinged pink. "I want to... can you...?"
This is a conversation between Sam and Dean and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
He heard Sherlock leave the room, but John didn’t dare move. Instead he stared at the wallpaper directly in front of him, trying to pull himself together. He had always been a bit… curious… but never in a million years did he think he’d actually do anything sexual with another man. Much less his professor, for God’s sake!
Sherlock nodded mutely, cheeks flushed and mouth open. John tossed the lubricant back into the nightstand and took the sound out with him, putting it in a pot of water and setting it on the stove to boil.
He closed his eyes, mentally steeling himself, before swallowing around Sherlock. Sherlock's hips snapped up as he cried out around a mouthful of John's cock, his hot semen pulsing deep into John's throat. John gagged and pulled back, coughing, as Sherlock continued to spurt. Jesus, you'd have thought he hadn't cum in years.
John swallowed. Shit, he could see through this act. Sherlock knew that John had gotten off on it, going up to his room as soon as decently possible and having a good, guilt-ridden wank himself. "I don't... what?"
“I’m sorry?”
Once Sherlock had relaxed a bit, John's hand began to move, slowly at first, and then quickly. The noise Sherlock made when John accidentally brushed his prostate made the hairs on the back of John's neck stand up.
John was pretty sure his stomach had just hit the floor and bounced back up to his throat. He could feel his face redden. “Ahaha, erm- I-”
"And who does this-" John roughly grabbed Sherlock's arse cheeks. "belong to?"
"Then why were you so keen to lie about it?"
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Why?
Sherlock Holmes: Because I'm bored, and you're a potential client.
Jim Moriarty: Sorry about that. You know how faking your own death is.
"But I do," John finally replied, resituating himself in his chair.
Sherlock Holmes: And you're a psycho-killer.
John cried out, hands flying to Sherlock's hair as he came. He could feel it oozing through the fabric of his pants and trousers, forming a small wet spot near the zipper.
Jim Moriarty: Hi.
He slowly reached his hand out and just as his fingers brushed against the cool doorknob, another sound came from the shower-
John bent forward and bit Sherlock's earlobe as his hips slammed into Sherlock's over and over again, an erotic skin-on-skin slapping reverberating around the room. "Going to make you cum so fucking hard. Shit, you're so tight."
"Maybe this is why all your girlfriends leave you," Sherlock chuckled, moving his attention to my scrotum.
John smiled victoriously, sweat beading on his forehead as he increased his tempo and, Sherlock meeting him thrust for thrust and making unintelligible sounds.
John tugged gently at the handle poking out of Sherlock's arse, surprised by how easily it slid out. He was very lubricated and ready. How easy it would be to just bend him over and-
Without another word, he opened the door and walked into the kitchen, and after several moments of standing frozen like an idiot, I started up the stairs to my bedroom.
John Watson: But give me one moment...I have to go...do something....stay right where you are
John frowned. So his Forensics professor kept skulls of old friends… maybe he was a bit more loopy than he had originally thought. Holmes entered the room and turned on the light, bidding John to come in. He found himself in a rather large, modern bathroom furnished with a large shower and a bathtub. John nervously appraised the bag, hook, and tube which he could only assume would be used for the enema, but perhaps they weren’t going to do that after all. At least, he could hope.
Sherlock smiled. All was well at 221B Baker Street.
When Sherlock had finally settled again, small whimpering moans subsiding, John slowly removed the sound and stood.
“Hold it all in,” Sherlock whispered as he inserted the small tube into John’s arsehole. It probably went in two or three inches. “This might feel a bit… odd. But please try to keep it all in.”
"What?" asked Sherlock frantically, stomach flipping. He didn't dare open his eyes lest he see John holding back laughter at some secret joke at his expense.
He nodded, sniffling, as I left his bedroom. I opened the cupboard and reached for a glass, choosing the tallest one we had. It was chipped at the rim from a minor explosion in the kitchen last year that rattled the cupboards and the glasses within. I couldn't help but smile as I filled it at the tap, making sure the water was cool but not cold.
"Ohhh," they both moaned at the same time. Sherlock rose a few centimetres and sat back down, squarely hitting his prostate.
Sherlock Holmes: Do you have a panties fetish?
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: She wrote 'Castiel Novak is too gay to function' and I don't mind Dean saying that, but only him though
My jaw worked as slowly, the rapid fire words sunk into my brain. "It was half a bottle of paracetamol, Sherlock, what are we supposed to think?"
Sherlock Holmes: I think he's an ISTJ.
John Watson: This isn't the time for that conversation...
Two...
Sherlock's eyes followed him all the way to the floor, and then his entire body twitched with a groaned, "oh fuck."
He glanced at his alarm clock. 9:49. His lips twitched when he spotted a large glass of water and a tablet sitting next to his lamp. Thoughtful, Sherlock.
John slammed his hips forward and Sherlock cried out into his mouth, eyes snapping open. John trailed his lips down the detective's neck, leaving hot, open-mouthed kisses there.
“This is mine,” Sherlock hissed, stepping forward even further and pushing his arousal into John’s thigh. “And mine alone. Do you understand?”
John’s eyes snapped open immediately. His professor was staring intently at him, drinking in every detail like it was water to a dying man. John felt his face heat up, but he stared back at his professor.
John Watson: Are you even listening, Sherlock?
Sherlock Holmes: Thank you. I have another "soda" here, if you're thirsty.
John stood just outside the bathroom, arguing with himself. Yes, he did have to piss very badly, any yes, Sherlock had walked in on John in the shower before for more trivial things than bathroom emergencies. Plus, to be fair, Sherlock had been in there for nearly half an hour.
John frowned slightly. Sherlock's voice was unsure and tinged with sadness. He'd have to ask later, because obviously Sherlock was unwilling to talk about it now.
"-my whole existence is flawed. You get me closer to God," Sherlock finished, tossing the microphone onto the cushion beside John and leaning in, pressing a not-so-chaste kiss to the doctor's mouth.
John chuckled. "If that's what you want..." Again he tugged in Sherlock's cock, this time a bit faster. "Again? Or do you want me to suck you off again? I'm more prepared this time, I'll let you fuck my throat."
Slowly, he pulled his fist back up, thumb sweeping over the tip of his cock, causing a quiet hiss to escape his lips. Sherlock's eyes snapped open suddenly and he leaned forward, maintaining eye contact with me as he pursed his lips and let a glob of spit fall out of his mouth and directly onto the head of his cock. It began to run down the side of his shaft until his first caught it, sweeping it up and over his tip with another brush of his long, slender thumb.
John did so, blushing. His arse was high in the air and completely exposed. He heard Sherlock take a step forward and he spread his long, expert fingers across John’s arse cheeks.
His heart pounded in his chest. From embarrassment, of course, because becoming aroused at seeing his flatmate having a wank in his chair was completely inappropriate.
John Watson: My history was from before you and me, Sherlock
Two more strikes, just below the others. "I want you to list every offense this week, and the number of occurrences. Each occurrence gets one blow." John's voice was louder now that he was in control; more commanding. Sherlock shuddered, wracking his suddenly surprisingly blank brain.
Sherlock Holmes: Was it something I said?
"Why would I have condoms?" Sherlock replied, panting. He'd have to see how long he could go without breathing while kissing sometime. Without John knowing, of course.
"Stall," John commanded, reaching into his pocket. "Trousers down, coat off, bent over the toilet with your forearms on the tank." He clicked the vibrator off and Sherlock gasped, stumbling to the closest stall. He heard the zipper go down and Sherlock's trousers hit the floor.
After staring at me for several seconds, Sherlock smirked, slow and sexy and promising. His tongue dipped out and moistened his Cupid's bow lips, gracefully sinking to his knees.
Nearly an hour later, John made his way back to the bedroom. He had hardly been able to concentrate while he worked, kept busy by his half-hard cock and the image of Sherlock tied to the bed, helpless.
Sherlock was sitting on the couch, looking intensely at John. "So, I know you walked in on me this morning."
The refrigerator opened, and John was only partly disgusted to find a pickled organ (spleen, maybe?) on the shelf next to the carton of milk. He would need to have another chat with Sherlock to remind him that now that there was a baby in the house, he had to clean up after himself and put his experiments far out of reach.
Through her shirt, John could see the woman's nipples hardening. Her pupils were dilated slightly, and she pressed her legs together discreetly. "You'll do almost anything just for shits and giggles?" She asked, voice slightly husky. John could almost feel the hormones floating through the air.
"And what kind of bloke gets off on smacking bums?" John continued, pressing the front of his straining trousers against the back of Sherlock's thigh.
"You're so fucking tight, Christ." Already his thrusts were getting erratic, rough enough to bruise Sherlock but he didn't seem to mind. "Say it."
“This might feel uncomfortable,” Sherlock mumbled, tracing the puckering hole. The chill of the gel made John shiver. Without another word, one finger was thrust into him.
John closed his eyes, barely suppressing a moan. Jesus Christ, his baritone voice could call him to the depths of hell and he'd come marching. "I could handle that. However rough you get, I've had rougher. A bisexual man of my size in the military... you get the idea."
Sherlock Holmes: My only enemy is your love interest... and sometimes my brother.
wolowitz: greetings
Not being able to see Sherlock would be a disadvantage in this conversation, but he leaped at the chance to learn more about him and to give himself a distraction from the pain. “Alright. How many times have you done this?”
"Yes-?" I gasped, tugging lightly on his hair to make him do whatever he had just done again.
Sherlock Holmes: Because he's my nemesis, and many people work for him. Or rather he works for them...
Sherlock Holmes: You're... a woman? Apologizes, madam. Why is your title 'king' if you're a female, if I may ask?
John laughed. "You cock, I was out of town yesterday."
John cocked an eyebrow, clearing his throat. He hoped his face wasn't as pink as it felt. "You mean, like, a prostate orgasm? Yeah. Two or three times. I prefer to top."
"Have you ever came untouched?"
"Come on, 'Three Continents Watson.' You didn't get that title by playing coy."
Sherlock Holmes: No, because that would be a LIE and I don't tell those.
John Watson: I had to wash my hands...I spilled some soda earlier...
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: No, a device on my throat translates my roars
Sherlock Holmes: As I thought. All bark but no bite... or rather roar...
"Are you sure you don't want to leave?" Sherlock finally asked once he had sprawled himself across his bed, legs obscenely spread. I swallowed. I was getting a feeling that Sherlock was not, in fact, going to hurt himself; rather, quite the opposite. Just the same- it would be best that I ensured- wasn't it?
So after less than two seconds of thought John silently opened the bathroom door. He didn't need Sherlock to know he was in there, even though the git would probably figure it out just by looking at the creases in his jeans or something improbable (John  had learned that with Sherlock Holmes nothing was impossible.)
Holmes’ eyes widened in surprise. “Really? That’s not what people usually say.”
Sherlock was panting now, squirming against the bed as he sought friction for his shamefully, achingly hard cock. Each hit got harder, the jolt of painpleasure increasing with each blow.
"Quickly. Like a bandage," Sherlock grit out. John nodded, steeling himself before thrusting his fingers in. Sherlock cried out, hips arching as he squirmed away only slightly. "Shit, are you trying to kill me?"
Sherlock Holmes: OI! That bloody hurt! *starts laughing hysterically, holding his bleeding and broken nose*
“You’re not my student anymore, legally,” Holmes breathed, entirely too close to John. His cool breath washed over John, who shivered.
Sherlock Holmes: Well, hello.
Sherlock Holmes: Hurry up and come downstairs. I need my scarf and now I'm a bit indisposed for work.
John blushed as he stood. Yes, he was very familiar with the position… usually he wasn’t on the receiving end, though. John stepped into the bathtub and got on his hands and knees, face burning with humiliation. Even so, his cock was already half-hard.
Sherlock turned suddenly and grabbed the medical bag (it looked like an IV bag) and filled it nearly full with tap water, adding what looked like table salt in and shaking it. He hooked the sack up on the hook and connected the tube, allowing a bit of the solution to squirt out before closing the tap.
John groaned, hands snaking around Sherlock's hips to his arse and squeezing as Sherlock panted. Fuck, this was the hottest thing that had ever happened to him, he was getting so close, the muscles in his legs twitching-
“Turn over,” Sherlock ordered. John did so, feeling his fingers trail down his lower back and stop right…  there.
Sherlock Holmes: Good. You're not as idiotic as most people on this website.
"Fucking- right there, oh... yes!"
John’s mind froze when his phone buzzed. Oh shit. Oh shit. He was sure it was Professor Holmes, and oh God he wanted to shove a tube up his arse to clean out his colon and oh God he couldn’t do it. He’d have to move to a new university and probably a new city and get a new name and oh SHIT.
Sherlock Holmes: Hello...
Once again, Sherlock straddled John. He nodded, closing his heavy-lidded eyes. Sherlock reached behind him and grasped John's cock, stroking it a few times reverently before slowly sitting, impaling himself with John's cock.
And his index finger was dipping back in, this time to the second digit; I could see him tense slightly around the intrusion but then he was relaxed again as he slowly pumped his finger in and out of himself, resuming his steady stroking of his cock.
For Kate.
Sherlock nearly fell off the bed in his eagerness to obey. In record time he had unbuttoned his shirt, yanked off his trousers and then his black pants.
swishthwack.
"Faster?"
Sherlock Holmes: I need to keep my eyes out, stop heresies about me from spreading. I don't want another Reichenbach Fall.
Sherlock Holmes: I'm an ISTP. Quiet and reserved, interested in how and why things work. Excellent skills with mechanical things. Risk-takers who they live for the moment. Usually interested in and talented at extreme sports. Uncomplicated in their desires. Loyal to their peers and to their internal value systems, but not overly concerned with respecting laws and rules if they get in the way of getting something done. Detached and analytical, they excel at finding solutions to practical problems.
Sherlock smirked, eyes alight. "I'm going to reach into my nightstand. Just getting... things."
"Yes!" Sherlock hissed, hips bucking, as John rubbed his frenulum. "John, please-"
"That was your first time cumming?" John asked incredulously.
"Oh? Then you've solved it?"
Jim Moriarty: Well... yes. I defeated Sherlock Holmes, 'one of the best minds in Britain'.
After several minutes of John just standing there, catching his breath, he finally came to his senses. He actually needed a wash and Sherlock was waiting for him with a cup of coffee.
"Can I move my finger?" John asked after several minutes of adjustment.
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow. "I believe you agreed to making pancakes for us."
Jim Moriarty: High functioning sociopath. With your number.
Holmes smirked as John snatched his phone back, checking to make sure his professor hadn’t done anything to it. “Text me between 5:00 and 6:00. I’ll send you the address. Bring nothing other than your mobile.”
"You. Have. Me. So. Fucking. Hard. I. Want. To. Fuck. You. So. Fucking. Bad," John breathed into his ear, thrusting his cock against Sherlock's with every word.
John next flicked his tongue over Sherlock's arsehole, lips around the pink hole as he sucked.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock Holmes: It's because of his Irish accent, isn't it? Are you that one reporter? The one who cornered me in that bathroom before his trial?
Hiro Hamada: *Bursts out laughing* /please/, sure you do. No one does. People working in the profession for years don't understand me. I mean, hello, I'm a fourteen year old super genius robotics prodigy. Well, that's what the tabloids call me. I just happen to agree.
This continued on for five or so minutes, until Sherlock started using his hips to get John deeper. John rested his other hand in the detective's thigh.
John Watson: Why can't you get it???
John stood, tucking his limp dick in his trousers and zipped them. He straightened his jumper and felt the wet patch on his shoulder where Sherlock had bitten him.
John was just behind him, back ramrod straight. Once in his bedroom Sherlock hesitated, turning toward John, but the doctor simply swept past him and went straight to Sherlock's wardrobe.
Sherlock hissed but held stock still, entire body stiffening.
Sherlock pulled out and removed his shirt. “Missionary position, Mr. Watson. You are now ready to be fucked.”
John lifted his bum off the bed and pulled off his red pants. "Come on," he smirked. "I believe I said I wouldn't touch you until you touched yourself."
Sherlock Holmes: I need to get the public's opinion on me. Keep an ear out, as they say. We don't want another Reichenbach, do we?
"And what kind of blokes want other blokes to smack their bums?" John pressed, squeezing his arse cheek painfully hard.
"Sure?"
“Shit, I think I’ve lost-”
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: No.
"I used the card you took from Mycroft, you mean," I corrected, leading the way to the kitchen and walking to the stovetop. "He told me I was allowed to use it if I needed."
Sherlock Holmes: No! God, no. I hate Twinings. Earl Grey, if you have it.
"Take off your clothes," John growled, rolling off the detective.
The doctor's eyes widened and he leaned down, biting Sherlock's neck almost hard enough to draw blood as he grunted and with two final, rough thrusts, came deep inside Sherlock.
John stood awkwardly, his abdomen feeling slooshy and full. He stumbled to the toilet and sat down. Not a second was wasted, and with a sigh of relief, the liquid was expelled from his body.
Sherlock stood and turned the nozzle again. The liquid continued to flow into him, although now each drop added to the pain until John was sure he couldn’t possibly hurt more, and was proven wrong the following instant.
The detective cried out, head falling further down. John pulled out quickly and thrust back in, gyrating his hips again.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Yeah, I suppose not...Although he isn't anything like Magnussen. That's something.
"Such a greedy little slut. Letting his Master fuck him in the loo while he wanks," John growled, suddenly snapping his hips and filling Sherlock.
Sherlock Holmes: I didn't expect to find you here.
Jim Moriarty: Not only is he arrogant, he's also a liar...
I knocked lightly on his door and pushed it open. "Sherlock?"
"Do you have condoms?" John finally asked as he came up from air.
Sherlock Holmes: Hello.
Sherlock Holmes: What about him appeals to you?
John was sitting back on his heels, breathing heavily. He had saliva trailing down the corner of his mouth to his chin. Just the sight of him so... used, for lack of a better word, was nearly enough to have Sherlock ready for round two.
“Call me John,” he amended, blushing furiously. Damn it. He wasn’t going to have time for Dr. Who… “Or not. Whatever.”
Sherlock Holmes: Yes. Fine. A bit bored, but... that's always the case.
Sherlock Holmes: Democracy?
"Shut up," John mumbled sleepily before going under completely.
Sherlock Holmes: Ah, yes. Sorry. It's John... Dr. Watson. We're having a bit of a row.
Sherlock Holmes: Good. What kingdom do you rule over?
Sherlock Holmes: What kind of alcohol is most effective at getting a man with my metabolism drunk?
“What do people usually say?”
"You," Sherlock gasped.
John gets an enema.
"Oh," I said, feigning surprise. "Mrs. Hudson must've put that up earlier?"
"Fu- uh. More," he keened, lifting his hips eagerly.
"I- it's not- no," John stammered, face going red again. Jesus, could he be more obvious? "That wasn't- um. That was unrelated."
Sherlock Holmes: Oh.
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Yup, wanna know what she wrote about me in there?
Sherlock smirked. "I gave myself an enema yesterday, so there's nothing to worry about there. I'm ready."
"I'm using the loo," John said loudly, knowing that Sherlock would follow after a minute as to not cause any suspicion.
He was just teasing me now, mouth moving against me, but not enough. Not nearly enough.
John sat up suddenly, not feeling quite so drunk anymore. "You... what?"
John gaped at the man, unable to form words. Finally, he managed to splutter, “Brilliant!”
Hiro Hamada: *Talking into the phone, and pinching a small object in my hand* I told you, Wasabi, it'll be fine. Stop worrying. All I need to do is place the le- *the small rice shaped object flies out of my hand and hits you in the head* Uh....I'll call you back. *Hangs up and laughs nervously at you* Yeah, sorry about that. Maybe this wasn't the best place to test out the new chip...
Sherlock's mouth fell open into an 'O' and his eyes squeezed shut as he came suddenly and violently, great spurts splattering his stomach and chest. He clenched around John's cock, his insides spasming from the pleasure.
Sherlock Holmes: Same to you. Where are you from?
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: None taken, sir. Well, I must move on, more people to meet and greet. Goodbye.
I had a conversation with Dean and Sam (no alias was given, alas.)
It was the only bathroom in the flat, damn it, and he paid just as much rent as Sherlock did. It was both of their bathrooms.
"I know, love." John grit his teeth and closed his eyes. If he kept looking into Sherlock's flushed face and dark, bottomless eyes, he knew he would slip and hurt Sherlock.
Sherlock Holmes: Fine. Hurry up.
John stepped forward without looking, trying to think of something snarky to text. Maybe something like ‘Some professor, hitting on his student.’… but that seemed like a low blow (maybe literally, he thought with a shudder. Damn it. He had to be gay.)
"Not your fingers," Sherlock finally managed, sweat beading on his forehead. He uselessly thrust his hips into the air, looking for friction for his straining cock.
Maddeningly slowly, John pressed the tip of his cock into Sherlock, stilling when he had gone in a few centimetres.
Sherlock smiled sadly, running his slender fingers through the doctor's short blonde hair. "You should get some sleep. We can talk in the morning. Maybe have a proper snog."
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?) has left the conversation.
"Tell me when you're close. If you cum, we start all over."
Yes. Sherlock had definitely, definitely made a miscalculation. Without another word, Sherlock shrugged off his blue silk dressing gown, folding it carefully and setting it on the chair in the corner. Next came his pyjama bottoms and t-shirt, folding them just as meticulously and precisely as the robe.
Sherlock Holmes: I apologize for being so casual in my speech earlier.
"Y-yes," Sherlock whispered, legs shaking. It seems he was close to cumming as well.
“I figured you would agree, so I filled out all the necessary papers to switch classes,” Professor Holmes explained, mouth twitching. “All you need to do is sign down here.” He indicated to a short line at the very bottom of the last page.
"Aah," Sherlock gasped as John sucked gently on his exposed collarbone.
Sherlock Holmes: Why are you even on here?
Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel: Good?
Sherlock Holmes: Told John what?
Sherlock nodded and shook his head at the same time, more flustered than he could recall ever being. What on earth was getting into him? Where was the cool, calm detective that solved murders without even a flinch?
Sherlock shifted his feet, chest heaving and eyes wide. He looked like a deer caught in headlights; an uncommon expression on the detective. "I shouldn't have said that. Never mind. I'm off to bed."
He nuzzled against my stiff cock with his nose, smiling. "What do you want?" he asked, mouthing gently at my shaft through my pants.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Don't play dumb, it doesn't suit you. You're already unintelligent enough as it is. I could see your erection from a mile away when I walked in the kitchen."
Again, a sharp nod. Very, very slowly, John withdrew his finger until it was to the first digit and then slowly moved it back in. John could feel his cock straining angrily against his pants and desperately wanted to replace his finger with his cock but for Sherlock's sake he was taking it slow. Probably slower than necessary, but better safe than sorry.
"Yes," Sherlock replied, surprised by how steady his voice was, considering the hand on his (extremely erect) cock.
Quite a bit faster than before, John removed his finger to the very tip this time and quickly (relatively) thrust it back in.
"I... um... I... woke you up with my violin at 3:00AM. Once." thwack. "And I- I- fuck, I complained about your tea once." THWACK.
This is a conversation between Jim Moriarty and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
"I want to fuck you like an animal-"
For nearly a month I had been working up the nerve to do it. Already I had set up a tree in our living room and hung stockings on the fireplace, and I had been afraid that if I made a move too soon, Sherlock would get tired of it too quickly.
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): *shakes head* No, why?
Another small stream dribbled out of John's leaking slit. "Are you ready?" John breathed, wiping his hands on the towel he had thankfully thought to grab.
Sherlock exhaled loudly through his nose. "Minute."
John tentatively lay his head down, surprised by how much more comfortable he was.
Their tongues brushed briefly before John pulled back, panting slightly. "I have to run this formula to Molly's. Continue when I get back?"
Sherlock Holmes: I'm quite surprised that no one in modern times knows this!
Chat with Howard Wolowitz.
“Fuck!” he cried, feeling tears form in his eyes. “Stop, please. Please. Please stop.”
My mouth opened and closed several times as question after question rolled through my head. Finally, I decided to go with the safest one: "What?"
Sorry about that cliff hanger :) (NOT REALLY)
John sagged. So he knew what he was doing, at least. Not that he thought Sherlock would do this without any expertise. “All men?”
"Like I'm shitting the wrong way," Sherlock replied through gritted teeth. John chuckled.
Then he yanked the door open, closed it as quickly and silently as possible, and ran to the kitchen. John turned on the sink, head bowed in case Sherlock came. Came out. Of the shower, that is. His face was searing and red as he rinsed his soapy hands off, wiping them hastily on the green towel to his right and turning to go up to his room before-
"Okay, you've got what you wanted. Let's get a bite to eat," John interrupted, turning and seeing the two just as he'd pictured them.
His pink bud stood out from his ivory skin, and John looked at his arse for several seconds before finally leaning forward, spreading his cheeks further apart, and licking around Sherlock's arsehole.
King Artoria Pendragon: Well my actual name is King Artoria Pendragon.
"Yes!" he cried out, pushing his bum back so John's fingers were in him to the third knuckle.
After standing there for a moment, John started, remembering the running shower, and stepping in. He let out an indecent moan as the almost unbearably hot water streamed down his chest.
Sherlock Holmes: Thanks. That's not what most people say.
John sighed, scowling at his laptop screen. His blog had been getting more hate recently, and one particular comment was bothering him.
"I'm going to finish the blog post. I know you are able to cum without being touched. Do this and you'll be wearing a chastity cage for a month. Do you understand?"
Sherlock's lips were so close to John's ear that he could feel them brush his lobe, his voice barely above a purr. "I want to fuck you like an animal."
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): Hi..
"Alright then," John announced as if he had just made a business deal. "But there is some preparation involved. I'm not skipping any of that."
John eyes him hungrily. "Beautiful," he breathed.
When it finally came out, Sherlock's arse gaped for a moment in the cool air, but immediately the pink bud closed.
"Yes. Every other Wednesday, I retreat to my room exactly nineteen minutes earlier than usual to do this. I'm not going to skip this one just because you find it inconvenient. Now leave."
S. Holmes… he’d seen it on the plaque on his professor’s desk, but had never wondered what it had stood for. Scott? Stephen? Samuel? Seth? He had no idea. He pulled up MapQuest and typed in the address… it was nearly 30 minutes from London Metropolitan (his university.) If Holmes wanted him there by eight, he had to leave quickly. He jumped up and grabbed his jacket, turning off the telly and grabbing his keys.
"You used by carb," Sherlock noted as he stood, shoving his feet into his worn blue slippers.
Sherlock Holmes: Ah. One of THOSE trolls.
Sherlock's back went ram-rod straight, his mouth popping open slightly and a flush rising to his cheeks. Just as soon as he'd gasped the vibrations against his prostate ceased.
Sherlock Holmes: After all, he is me.
Sherlock groaned, eyes squeezing shut and a look of pure ecstasy flashing across his features. "Yes, John. Right now."
Sherlock Holmes: What do you want to talk about, then?
Just when he thought he couldn't take any more his nose bumped Sherlock's scrotum. Thank God, he thought, eyes streaming as he fought his gag reflex.
John Watson: You know I'm too busy for that nowadays
Sherlock Holmes: Of all the people to love, you choose Jim Moriarty?
My knees went weak and my breath hitched in my throat. Sherlock smirked at me, a slow, sexy smirk that was dark and promising. His pupils were nearly eclipsing the irises now; his eyes flickered down to my rather obvious bulge and back up. Without thought, I reached down and unzipped my trousers, pulling my pants out and over my cock and letting my erection spring free. Sherlock's smile widened.
a teen girl in love with Jim Moriarty: Surely you have a guess.
Sherlock Holmes: He's my distraction.
Sherlock flushed, eyes cracking open. "You're just saying that."
Sherlock Holmes: Well, I have news: The Lestrange killings- it was their butler after all. So cliché- I regret taking that case.
“Was that a skull?” John asked curiously as Holmes opened a door in the hallway.
Sherlock nodded, neck and face a brilliant pink. Seeing Sherlock like this, vulnerable and needy and at John's mercy, was making him achingly hard. He hadn't even touched himself but he could feel the dampness of his precum on the sheets beneath him.
"You do what?"
John looked up, cheeks heating up, as he snapped the bathroom door closed behind him. He gripped his towel closer to his waist and stared at Sherlock, who was smirking at him from the kitchen sink.
Sherlock Holmes: Yes, I do.
"Turn it off," Sherlock gasped as the door closed. His legs were shaking and his face was pink. "John, please."
I pinched the bridge of my nose. "You downed a dozen tablets then drank an entire pot of coffee. Why would you do that if it wasn't a suicide attempt?"
Even as he climbed the stairs to 221B, John could hear the music. Well, it would have been more surprising if he hadn't heard it, actually, considering the volume of the music. The bass rumbled deep in his chest, like it had so often at concerts when he was in Uni.
"I used up all the hot water in the shower twice." thwackthwack. "I left the toothpaste lid off four times." thwackthwackthwackthwack. "I- ah- left a mess in the kitchen two- no, three times." thwackthwackthwack.
“Nothing.” John looked quickly down at the drain of the tub, afraid he would somehow read his mind like he seemed so able to do. He always knew who had and hadn’t studied, who copied whose notes, et cetera. No, his mind was perfectly fine unmolested by Sherlock’s prying gaze.
Sherlock looked at me, a boyish smile spreading across his lips. "Well, me and my mate snuck under the yellow tape to see the body. John's really into medical shit, but I'm just in it for the adrenaline."
A T-Rex Who Speaks Human: Hi
"I suppose bondage has always intrigued me... sensory deprivation... punishment, edging, orgasm delay and denial, roleplay, domination..."
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): A long time ago.
teen!nerd!wearing lingerie underneath clothing!Castiel (Destiel, jock!Dean?): Uh..
Sherlock had been wanking yesterday, most likely thinking of John. Did he imagine John taking that perfect ass of his? Or perhaps shoving his cock down his throat, his Cupid's bow lips forming a perfect circle as he swallowed around John?
When John walked out, Sherlock's head fell back, pulling up all the information about sex he knew.
Sherlock Holmes: Neither do I, but it helps get a basic idea.
Sherlock Holmes: Thank you.
Sherlock Holmes: And I bet all the ladies love you. But you're not into ladies, are you?
King Artoria Pendragon: I believe so.
Sherlock Holmes: Then that's what I'll have. Before I get too drunk, I'll introduce myself: Sherlock Holmes, world famous consulting detective.
Another thrust, this time harder. "Do you like this?" John hissed into Sherlock's ear.
Medical shit. John nearly snorted.
Sam and Dean: Dean: *checks you out* honestly I’ve seen better/ Sam: *cough* Cas * cough* *gets punched by Dean*
Sherlock slowly stood, moaning at the sudden emptiness his body felt. He quickly  put on his trousers, shoved his pants in his coat pocket, and shrugged that on.
John Watson: SHERLOCK!
But no. That's not what Sherlock wanted. John set the toy on the floor and leaned in toward the detective, licking a stripe up his perineum. Sherlock shuddered. Encouraged, John ran his tongue directly over the detective's puckered hole.
"Like a finger up my arse is going to kill me," Sherlock snarked (poorly.) His voice sounded strained but not pained, so John took it as a good sign.
Sherlock Holmes: How are you?
Sherlock Holmes: Hmm...
"It was for an experiment," Sherlock huffed, unzipping his trousers. My eyes darted down for a split second before I caught myself.
John was breathing heavily, tears running down the tip of his nose and onto the pillow. “Only half?”
Sherlock whimpered, tossing his head back and forth at the stimulus. "You. I want... your cock... please, no, too much," he gasped as John took him into his mouth.
"-my whole existence is flawed. You get me closer to God."
Sherlock Holmes: No offense, your T-Rexiness.
“I’m very glad you came, John, but what’s the matter?”
John whimpered. “Go on. Turn the bloody thing on.”
Sherlock Holmes: Oh, FLOWERS? Is that truly necessary? Can't I just take out my cock and ram it up his-*hiccups violently*- and call it good?
Sherlock Holmes: I'm listening to the sounds of male fornication still emanating from your room, I think what you mean is am I reading. And yes. I just don't find it important.
Jim Moriarty has left the conversation.
They sat in silence for several minutes as the stranger did his business, washed his hands, and finally left.
John bracketed Sherlock's torso with his forearms as he thrust into Sherlock again and again, quick, ragged little thrusts that made Sherlock's cock dribble but not enough to push him over the edge. The doctor's mouth opened with a gasp.
He reached for the glass and took a large swig before taking the tablet, hoping it was strong and would kick in quickly.
John looked up in amazement at his professor. “That’s… wow. That’s extremely kind of you, sir.” He took the pen from Holmes and scribbled a few lines for his signature, holding out the pen for him to take back.
King Artoria Pendragon: It's quite alright
Sherlock Holmes: Quiet, kind, and conscientious. Can be depended on to follow through. Usually puts the needs of others above their own needs. Stable and practical, they value security and traditions. Well-developed sense of space and function. Rich inner world of observations about people. Extremely perceptive of other's feelings. Interested in serving others.
Sherlock Holmes: Thank you. What is your name, by the way?
Sherlock Holmes: I remember lots of stuff by memory. Mind palace. *taps forehead knowingly*
Sherlock Holmes: Chip?
Sherlock broke away from John, panting. “I want to fuck you right this second and make you scream so loud you wake up the entire fucking block,” he breathed, eyes impossibly dark. John lay, panting and needing more. “But I don’t want to hurt you, so I have to go slow,” Sherlock finished, releasing John’s wrists. Sherlock’s long, slender fingers trailed down John’s chest and abdomen, stopping just above his cock.
"Well, you came without being touched after all. You can thank me now or later."
"I assumed."
Sherlock stepped up to her, suddenly bubbling with nervous excitement. "So you saw what happened then?" he asked quietly, as if trying not to attract attention.
"Oh, I know you will," John smiled before heading back to the kitchen, grabbing the bottle, and leaving 221B Baker Street.
Holmes looked over his shoulder with a satisfied smirk. “Well, enemas aren’t as easy to execute as sitting down and watching crap telly.”
His hand paused around his cock, letting his finger rub his slit for a moment. I could see precum beginning to seep down the side of his shaft and I had the sudden, intense urge to lean forward and lap it up.
Sam and Dean: Dean: That's it *launches forward punching you in the nose, Sam tries to stop him*
This is a conversation between Teen!Artist!Punk!Castiel and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
John stared for a moment before moving both hands to Sherlock's face, bending down, and crashing his mouth to Sherlock's.
"Do you understand why I am punishing you?" Just as quiet. Just as hypnotic. Just as angry. "You may respond."
He pressed the button again and Sherlock actually let out a growl, thumb pausing against the girl's lip.
Sherlock whines. John snaps.
Slowly, as if unwrapping a particularly exciting Christmas present, John peeled off Sherlock's pants. Sherlock shut his eyes just before John let out a small chuckle.
Sherlock Holmes: Do you not have a nemesis?
"Sherlock. Glad you could make it. That was-"
The Woman: *smiles back at you* Emma... Are you ok?
Sherlock Holmes: I know 240 different types of ash and can distinguish them. *crosses arms proudly*
King Artoria Pendragon: Well I'm kind of alive. The story is a little different though. And by that I mean that King Arthur was actually a woman.
Luckily for the two, the cafe was completely empty and so they had the bathroom to themselves. Still, the prospect of having someone walk in was possible.
He froze, listening. Yes, Sherlock was breathing heavily, John could hear that now. Sherlock sucked in a deep breath and then groaned and that's when John knew.
"There. That's all of it," John stated. "Okay?"
Barista: Why do you want to get drunk now? You never directly answered my question
John chuckled, kissing his cock gently. "Shut up, it's what you asked for."
“What?” John felt like whining for some unknown reason. “Like you said, I’m not your student. I just signed the papers-”
"That's right... feel my cock... you're so tight, love... fuck, so good..."
"That was. Um." Sherlock cleared his throat, quite embarrassed. "Sorry if I was a bit rough, I got carried away."
Jim Moriarty: You're very welcome!
John pulled out of Sherlock, eliciting a moan from him, and scooted around Sherlock. He set the lid down to the toilet and sat down (for he hadn't taken off his trousers, only unzipped them.) Sherlock immediately straddled John, waiting for John's signal.
I chat with Hiro Hamada (Didn't get a different name from them...)
I felt my face heat up as Sherlock pulled a vibrator out of his drawer. Jesus Christ, this wasn't part of the agreement.
Sherlock paused and John nodded slightly, so Sherlock took a step forward.
I hardly had enough time to register that before his lips were around me and in, in, in, Jesus he was taking me deep, tight and hot and wet and tongue swirling-
"Back," John announced, slightly out of breath. Sherlock's eyes snapped open just as John pulled off his trousers eagerly (leaving on his pants.) Next came his jumper and the his t-shirt.
Sherlock Holmes: Trust me, he feels it for more than a few hours.
John stumbled and fell onto a bed, and Sherlock bent over him, taking both his hands and pinning them with one of his high above his head. Sherlock smiled as he ground his pelvis against John’s, inciting a moan from the latter.
John shifted the paper sack in his arms, about to shout for Sherlock to turn it down, when he finally looked up.
Sherlock nodded, closing his eyes as John situated himself over the detective. "I'll go slowly. I know it hurts, I know."
John quickened his strokes, biceps rippling as he jerked Sherlock off. "Love, I won't make it much longer. I want you to cum with me," he breathed.
"Fuck..." Sherlock breathed, head tilting back and face going hot red. "Fuck, John. There."
The Woman: *leans against a counter in the kitchen, waiting for water to boil* Who?
John cursed himself, cursed the London traffic, and cursed his daughter (but that one he felt immediately bad about and shoved to the back of his mind) as he took the steps up to the flat two at a time. Bloody formula, he couldn't wait until Rosie was a bit older and wouldn't need to eat enriched, expensive foods.
Sherlock was in this very spot yesterday, crying out with pleasure. And- shit- maybe he came so hard he saw stars. That would be nothing- right there, yes- compared to how John would make him feel, cock buried in his arse, pounding him relentlessly-
Sherlock whimpered, hips thrusting several times in desperate search for friction. "I need to," Sherlock panted, tossing his head. "John, please, just... Let me..."
Again, John squirted lube onto his hands, this time more than before. He rubbed his palms together, warming it, until he was pleased.
Sherlock Holmes: Hello.
“May I have you?” Holmes breathed, eyes dipping down to John’s trousers and back up again.
This is a conversation between King Artoria Pendragon and yourself, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock didn't respond, instead mussing up his hair and flipping up his collar. Sitting in an ambulance with a blanket around her shoulders was a young woman, maybe 30. She seemed calm enough, considering.
"Y-es!" Sherlock hissed, face contorting as the vibrations suddenly shook through him. "Danger's my middle name," he finished, voice husky.
John stood suddenly and grabbed Sherlock by the upper arm. "No, wait. You knew I would walk in on you?"
John broke away from the kiss, mouth moving to Sherlock's exposed (and rather bent) neck. He kissed and sucked and bit very gently, and then not-so-gently when Sherlock groaned like John had his cock in his mouth or something spectacular.
John let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding. “Oh. Erm… no, I guess not. I always wanted to be a detective,”  John admitted with a slight blush.
Sherlock Holmes: True. That was extremely enlightening, my experience with him. I'm exceedingly glad he's dead.
Sherlock Holmes: I'm going to my mind palace to think for a moment.
"Feel okay?" he asked, twisting it a bit.
Jim Moriarty: Don't play stupid; it doesn't work on me.
A low, guttural moan, several octaves lower than Sherlock's regular speaking voice. It was the single most erotic thing John had ever heard, and that was saying quite a bit. Almost without thinking, John placed the bottle haphazardly on the kitchen table, walking hesitantly into the living room.
