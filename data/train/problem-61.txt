Miraculously, Thursday arrived without any cases or, in Mycroft’s case, international crises, to prevent the double dinner date. Jo, more nervous than she’d expected to be, had spent the early evening preparing an absurd amount of food and attempting to tidy the flat – a waste of time, in Sherlock’s opinion, since both Lestrade and her brother had seen the flat in worse shape than it was currently.
“I… god, this is harder than I thought it would be.” Jo took a deep, shaky breath before continuing. “I had an abortion in uni, Sherlock. I was drunk and slept with some guy, and I got pregnant, and I just… I couldn’t have a baby then, I just couldn’t. So I got an abortion. It was… I thought I’d have another chance, you know? I didn’t think that would be my only chance to have a baby. I thought I had time. And now -- after losing our baby, our baby that you wanted so badly -- I can’t help thinking that that’s
Look and she relented. “Okay, I was a bit. What else gave me away, then? I know you’re dying to tell me,” she teased.
Which was why, shortly after noon on the third day, Sherlock found herself standing in front of Mrs Hudson’s door. She had already raised her hand to knock three times, but hadn’t yet managed to make herself do it. She wasn’t sure if Jo would appreciate Sherlock asking Mrs Hudson to check on her, if she was doing the right thing, but she was out of ideas. Taking a deep breath, Sherlock knocked.
The drive was a blur again, though the journey back to Baker Street was fueled by anxiety and worry, versus being merely contemplative on the trip away. His foot was practically glued to the floor, screeching through yellow lights seconds before they turned red and cutting off cars left and right. He undoubtedly broke his personal record for fastest trip home while driving an unmarked car.
But when the sun had begun to set and his cell phone rang, he knew what it meant. And he was sorely tempted not to even answer it. He stood over the desk where it sat, vibrating and trilling insistently with the name “Sally Donovan” and a photo of her drunk at last year’s Christmas party displayed on the screen, and stared down at it in contemplation.
“If he managed to run off without me noticing while I was cowering under the table like a bloody coward, I swear to God…” John said desolately, running his hands through his hair and pulling at it slightly in an effort to ground himself with the pain.
What they had managed to find out hadn’t exactly sounded like an extended vacation, one spent going insane under Mycroft’s thumb while being babysat in his safehouses like they might have suspected. Sleeping rough on the streets of Shanghai, being stabbed in Rio, catching rotavirus in New Delhi, getting thrown off a third story balcony in Barcelona… None of it had sounded particularly pleasant.
Well, aside from the rare instances that Sherlock got a bee in his bonnet about them having sex in front of the fireplace; they wanted to spare Mrs. Hudson from any wayward noises or glimpses in case she came upstairs unannounced.
The next several minutes were tense as Mycroft began conversing with Sherlock in rapidfire Serbian, his responses calm and measured while his younger brother slowly became increasingly agitated. His hands visibly trembled around the guns and his arms seemed to want to drop of their own accord. He kept rolling his shoulders and forcing them to stay raised, wincing and fighting against his own body as he appeared to argue with his older brother.
“...Where’s Sherlock?” John asked, looking around the room anxiously with a furrowed brow. “Is he okay?”
“None of that now, love.” Greg said as he gently pried his hands away from his poor hair follicles. “If anyone is responsible here, it’s me. I knew that tonight would be rough but I still went in anyway when they called.”
John set about fussing over Sherlock, placing the duvet back around his shoulders despite the man’s protestations that he didn’t know why it was even there in the first place. John bit his lip and didn’t bother remarking on the slight tremors he could see coursing through Sherlock’s body, as he knew that they were mentally induced and not because the consulting detective was physically cold.
Expecting one or both of them to immediately jump out at him, he was more thrown by the lack of confrontation than he would have been if one had actually happened.
“No, I want to help.” John sniffed, scrubbing at his face with both hands for a moment before giving the other man a decisive nod. “He needs us.”
When it dawned on Greg that John and Sherlock’s tones of voice were exactly the same, just expressed in different languages, it felt like the ground had dropped out from beneath his feet as he realized his mistake. He had been so focused on trying to be there for John that he had completely failed Sherlock in the process.
“Oh my god, Sherlock’s hurting and here I am making everything all about me again.” John choked out, his left hand beginning to visibly tremble as stress began to get the better of him again.
“You know I hate to disturb you boss, but we need you down at Battersea Park. It looks like a massacre happened here, it’s a bloody mess.” Donovan apologized again before continuing, rattling off more details as Greg locked eyes with John.
And there, sitting right on top of the small writing desk, was the small gun safe Greg had bought for locking up the firearms he didn’t officially acknowledge that John and Sherlock owned while they were at home.
Finally he managed to reach 221B, slamming the car into park without a second thought and dashing up the short staircase. But once he had the front door unlocked and he first stepped into the house, his entire demeanor changed.
He didn’t realize that he had spoken out loud, rather than just thinking it in his head, until Greg finally said, “I’m calling the bastard back.”
Sherlock’s verdigris eyes darted back and forth between the two of them, the whirring of his mind practically visible as he analyzed and deduced the situation at staggering speeds. When his grip on the handles of the pistols seemed to relax and his arms slightly dropped, blinking rapidly as his brow began to furrow in confusion, Greg chanced taking a step forward.
Greg happily obliged, John’s sweet sipping kiss making the pang in his chest dissolve and Sherlock’s unexpected flash of tongue sending heat coursing through his body.
Ordinarily, Greg never had any particular issues with holidays as a whole. If anything, he enjoyed the excuse to kick his feet up and have a pint or two. In his opinion, there was way too much dark shit out there in the world and people should embrace every possible opportunity they’re given to enjoy life, Bonfire Night being no exception.
Greg winced. He'd thought that John’s guilt over physically going after Sherlock in the restaurant during his botched homecoming and holding a grudge against him for several months following it had eased, but apparently not. It didn’t matter to John that he hadn’t known the reasons behind Sherlock’s actions and that Mary had been strategically placed in his life to manipulate him against the consulting detective; he still blamed himself for reacting the way that he did.
“No, no,” John immediately insisted, raising his head again and straightening his spine, pushing his shoulders back and lifting his chin with a proud sniff. “I can’t leave him while he’s like this. I won’t.”
Without wasting another moment, he drew John even further into his arms and pressed his lips against the smaller man’s mouth.
“It’s okay.” John said, taking the phone out of his hand and slipping it into Greg’s pocket for him. He framed Greg’s grey stubble covered face between his hands and angled it down towards him. “We knew this was a possibility. I’ll still have Sherlock here to keep me company. I’ll force feed him some of the takeout and he’ll probably spoil the movie for me, just another night in with the loveable prat.”
The dark haired man’s voice grew even louder, his shouted warnings starting up again with renewed fervor. Then to John and Greg’s horror, his right hand moved to point John’s service pistol at his own temple.
The flat was full of items that could serve as makeshift weapons. Not to mention the fact that their fists could be weapons enough, seeing as Sherlock was formally trained in judo and had moonlit as MI6 for his brother, and John was a former Army soldier well versed in all the vulnerable points on the human body.
“Fuck.” He cursed, mentally kicking himself for allowing the case to absorb his attention so entirely that he'd temporarily forgotten about his concern for the man he’d left at home.
Another string of Pashto, John’s voice rising both in volume and pitch as he began to border on hysteria. Greg could hear the tears caught in his throat and he automatically took three steps down the alley and towards his car before forcing himself to stop. He turned and leaned his back against the wall, allowing his head to drop back to rest against the brick building as he rubbed at his eyes with his thumb and forefingers.
“Seeing as I would be required to reciprocate based on all your efforts over the years, particularly these last several months following his return and the beginning of your…” Here Mycroft paused for a moment, before continuing with a sniff, “romantic entanglements, I’d much prefer that you didn’t.”
They instantly put their hands in the air, standing side by side near the doorway but making no motion to retreat. John and Greg just stood there calmly, regarding their lover with only concern and love for him in their eyes.
“That’s right.” Greg soothed, breathing a small sigh of relief that he’d switched back to English. He didn’t know what he would do if John ever got stuck speaking Pashto.
All went according to plan during the day. Sherlock was entirely preoccupied with some experiment involving earthworms and their digestion of decomposing tissue, John puttered around the flat making tea and writing up their latest case for his blog, and Greg caught up on the paperwork he’d been forced to bring home with him in order to beg the day off.
Greg hesitated for another moment, grimacing and rubbing at his face, before finally giving in with an audible groan. He snatched the phone up and accepted the call before he could change his mind again.
Sherlock was loath to speak about his experiences during those two years that he had spent away. Greg and John had managed to pry bits and pieces out of him in moments of unsuspecting vulnerability, while soothing John after his shouting from a nightmare had woken them all up or when a stray thought crossed his mind while he was distracted enough to speak entirely unfiltered.
They’d tried to broach his feelings on the subject once and had been shut down so firmly that they’d backed off and never tried again. They were just happy to have him back, overjoyed to the point of being willing to believe that he’d let them know if there was anything worth worrying about.
While he didn’t mind the threat he himself faced by entering into the situation, he would still proceed under the assumption that they were armed and more dangerous than usual.
“Yeah, alright…” Greg interrupted gruffly. “Just give me a few to get everything sorted and then I’ll be on my way.”
“We think the fireworks triggered something that happened to him during his time away, though we’re not certain what.” Greg answered, hoping Sherlock wouldn’t be too cross with him for sharing that information with his overbearing elder brother. “Any insights you’d like to provide us with?”
“Sounds boring.” He rumbled in that dulcet baritone of his, sprawling gracefully onto his leather chair with a disdainful wave of his hand. “Sooner you leave, the sooner you’ll be back to us.”
“When it became clear that he would not be able to escape imprisonment on his own, I was forced to intervene on his behalf and extracted him myself, with the help of some of MI6’s finest of course.”
Only the sight of Donovan watching him from where she stood conferring with Anderson and his team over some of the forensic evidence kept Greg from immediately bolting for his car, case and career be damned.
“Of course we’ve bloody seen them! He told us that he was dragged behind a car aways during a street race in Seoul!” Greg spat, his tone murderous.
But knowing that the pops and bursts of the fireworks could easily be mistaken for the sound of artillery and gunfire, and listening as one of the greatest men he'd ever known suffered as a direct result of that?
He felt his coat pocket suddenly begin to vibrate and his heart jumped, hope filling him at the idea that Sherlock could be calling him for help. He quickly pulled his phone out of his pocket, only to frown down at the number being displayed. He’d pointedly never saved it in his contacts out of principle, but he’d been called from that number enough times in the past that he’d still inadvertently memorized it by heart.
He seemed to be losing energy quickly, the stress of the flashback likely taking its toll on him as he fought to remain vigilant.
Mrs. Hudson’s place was out, seeing as she would have let the two of them know if Sherlock had gone scurrying into 221A. 221C came to mind, as well as several of his usual haunts and all of his known boltholes, but Greg wouldn’t worry about those until he knew for certain that 221B was empty of the dark-haired man.
Both men held their breath, slightly anxious to see how the man would react to being discovered while stuck in place beneath a massive piece of furniture, but they found the space devoid of anything but dust balls.
He wasted precious time leaning over and scrambling his hand around in a blind attempt to locate it, cursing out loud when he heard that John's shouting had resumed as he tucked the phone back into place.
“Sounds Slavic, like Russian or something.” John whispered. Greg nodded in thanks and relayed the additional explanation.
He had never minded being responsible for others, in fact it was usually a point of pride and identity for him. But in that moment, he cursed himself for having an obligation to anyone other than the two amazing men that shared his heart and made him feel alive.
Instead, he spared them both the lecture and just nodded in return. He began to slowly back out from beneath the kitchen table, John following closely behind him. He had already risen to his feet and was helping John rise to his own when a particularly loud firework went off, making them both flinch and almost sending John back beneath the table entirely.
After hesitating for a moment, John reluctantly nodded that he understood, though the other man got the feeling that he didn’t quite believe what he had just agreed with. Greg added that to his mental note to be addressed later on as well.
He immediately knew it was the wrong decision when Sherlock tensed again, snarling out what sounded like a warning before tightening his grip on the guns and cocking them.
“You have a duty to the public Greg, and neither of us realized how poorly Sherlock would react.” John said. “Don’t blame yourself.”
“You’re safe Sunshine. All that noise is just a bunch of drunk tossers celebrating Bonfire Night with lots of fireworks.” Greg added.
Be it an anchor or a life raft or a lighthouse, he’d be whatever they needed to weather the storm. And when the rain finally stopped and the sun broke through the clouds, bringing new light and the promise of a better day to come, he’d be by their sides to help greet the dawn.
Greg shifted down into a kneeling position to mirror him, grimacing slightly as his knees protested with little pops and crackles of their own. He hesitated briefly, not wanting to frighten John, but he knew that touching him would be the only way that he would be able to get his attention.
“It’s alright Greg.” John said from his armchair, giving the older man a small reassuring smile. “Answer it.”
With that he left without another word, the three of them expressing everything they could possibly want to say through their actions, rendering those three little words unnecessary except for the rarest of circumstances. It made them more powerful that way.
“John, are you alright?” Greg forced himself to take a deep breath, his body instinctively wanting to panic as well. He had never been good at seeing his loved ones suffering and in pain, but he knew that he had to be the calm voice of reason the former Army soldier needed him to be in that moment.
“I’m sorry, I got scared and stepped closer to Greg without thinking.” John explained, his voice trembling. “Now Sherlock is… holding one of the guns against his head.” He had a hard time even getting the words out.
He knocked lightly on the doorframe before slowly and smoothly turning the knob, cracking the door open a couple inches.
“I know, love.” He said, stroking his cheek soothingly with his thumb. “I’ve got you though. You’re safe with me.”
“...No.” He breathed out shakily, before repeating the word again with growing certainty. “No, I didn’t.”
Greg stood in place, barely five steps into the room as he swept it with his gaze, examining each of the shadows for any sign of the two men. The small part of him that was afraid that they’d become distraught enough to take off blindly into the night was quickly growing, and he briefly began to consider placing a call and requesting that his fellow officers be on the lookout for them.
The whole time he kept his phone pinched between the side of his head and his shoulder, determinedly ignoring the cramp forming in his neck. The call was still active, the noises coming from the other end of the line registering in an absent-minded way as he focused on the road.
Sherlock began yelling again in the background, drowning everything out before Greg could ask another question. His voice was flooded with emotion in a way that Greg had never quite heard from him before, agitated and distraught and almost out of control. Soon John began calling back to him, his voice commanding and sharp over the sound of movement, random rustling as if he were scrambling about.
John let out a sob, his tear-filled murmuring drowned out by the sound of a man’s deep voice yelling in the background, also in a foreign language but one that wasn’t Pashto. It sounded Russian almost, all harsh consonants and guttural tones.
He reached out slowly and gently brushed his fingertips against the back of one of John’s hands. He quickly drew back when John immediately recoiled away from him, his eyes flying open and his hands coming up to protect his face as he started trying to crawl further beneath the table and away from Greg.
“Prisoner?” Greg asked, entirely unnerved and barely able to blink, let alone take his eyes off the devastating scene in front of him. He had the irrational fear that if he looked away for even just a second, the other man would end up lost to them forever.
While they’d been getting the backstory from Mycroft, Sherlock’s legs had seemingly given out on him. He’d slid slowly down the wall, eventually coming to rest on the floor with his torso leaning off to one side. He bore the brunt of his weight on his right upper arm and elbow with the gun still placed against his temple, his left arm extended halfheartedly up to aim at the two men with the other pistol.
“I know, I just… I still don’t like it.” Greg sighed, greedily accepting a kiss from John and leaning in for more when he started to pull back. “I’ll be back as quick as I can, I promise.” He whispered against his lips.
“You better.” John grinned, biting his lip as he stared at Greg’s mouth with heat in his eyes. “We’ll be waiting.”
John reached out, pulling Greg beneath the table with him before practically collapsing into the policeman’s arms. Greg held him as close as humanly possible, tucking the blond head beneath his chin as the smaller man trembled against his chest. He rubbed his back as he slowly rocked them from side to side, the feeling reminiscent of a parent soothing a child after they woke from a nightmare.
“I got called in. Someone apparently murdered a whole slew of homeless men and dressed them up like Guy Fawkes, propped them on top of the pyres for tonight in Battersea. Sounds like a fucking mess.” Greg said.
“No, don’t you dare feel guilty for needing to be comforted John. You’re hurting too and you deserve to be cared for just as much as anybody else, you hear me?” Greg said seriously, forcing him to meet his eyes.
“Sure, love. Take care of each other, alright? Johanna’s one of our best doctors, and a good friend.”
Dr Singh cleared her throat awkwardly, interrupting. “As soon as I examine Jo and do an ultrasound, you’re both free to go home. It’s already late, I won’t keep you any longer than necessary.”
“A contract?” Jo asked, surprised out of her nervousness. “I think you’re getting a bit ahead of yourself, there, bee. He hasn’t even said yes yet.”
“What, love?” Jo stopped pacing and went to stand behind her, looking over her shoulder at the tests. As soon as she did, it occurred to her how inane her question had been. It was obvious.
“Yeah, bee, I really think so. I think you’ll be incredible.” Jo laid one hand on her cheek and kissed her gently, then pulled back and smiled at her.
Still uncertain, Sherlock rolled over and pulled her close, curling up with her head under Jo’s chin. “Are you sure you’re alright with this?”
Sherlock Holmes was without question the smartest (and fittest, but that was beside the point) student in their year – she had no business being in anything as basic as an introductory course, but prerequisites were prerequisites even for a genius – and spent more time correcting professors than taking notes. She was in three of Jo’s other classes and although she’d never worked up the nerve to so much as introduce herself, Jo found herself nursing something of a crush on her.
“You don’t have to apologise, sweetheart. Of course I’ll take care of you.” Jo laced their fingers together, lifted them to her mouth and kissed the wedding ring on Sherlock’s slim finger. “I promised when I gave you this ring that I’d always take care of you. I intend to keep that promise.”
Sherlock looked thoughtful, if a bit confused. “If it’s forgiveness you need, you have it. There’s nothing to forgive, but I forgive you.”
“It might be,” Sherlock nodded, “but you're sick, which is more important than any murder.” She stood and offered her hand to Jo. “Come on, let’s go home.”
Sherlock shook her head without looking up and tried to shrink away from Jo’s touch, but said nothing.
Jo was sitting half-upright on the bed, wearing a hospital gown and wrapped in a heavy blanket. She looked pale and tired, the faint lines around her eyes and mouth pinched deeper with stress and pain. She had obviously been crying, but she wiped her eyes and smiled bravely when she saw Sherlock.
“You are due, it's been - Oh.” Sherlock suddenly looked disappointed again. “It’s been more than two weeks since…”
Two cups of tea and a stack of buttered toast later, Jo headed upstairs to a suspiciously quiet flat. Poking her head cautiously around the door, she was met with a sight even more unsettling than the silence: Sherlock was curled up on the couch in her pyjamas and dressing gown, shoulders shaking with quiet sobs.
Jo groaned and rolled onto her back, blinking sleepily up at her lovely, concerned wife. “Why’d you let me sleep so long?” she asked groggily.
“Of course, sister dear,” Mycroft answered smoothly. “That is the point of a donor contract, is it not?”
“I know what you mean, love.” Jo, more awake now, stifled a laugh. “How did you know I wanted to suggest Lestrade, though? I haven’t said anything.”
“Oh, Frank and I tried for years,” Mrs Hudson replied lightly. “I suppose it’s for the best, what with all that happened.”
The doctor sighed. “You’re a couple of centimetres dilated - no more than two or three. But at this point, you’re almost certainly going to lose the pregnancy,” she said quietly. “I’m so, so sorry.” When no answer came from either of the women in the hospital bed, she moved towards the door, looking uncertain. “I’ll leave you two alone for a few minutes, shall I? Excuse me…”
“I do hate Tchaikovsky, though,” Sherlock said, apropos of nothing, as they got out of the cab in front of 221 Baker Street. The cold air outside seemed to have woken her up a bit, which was good -- it meant that Jo would be more likely to be able to get her to eat a bit more.
Sherlock blushed at the praise and buried her face in Jo’s shoulder, sighing sleepily. Jo smiled and ran gentle fingers through her messy curls.
By the time Jo had finished tidying the kitchen, Sherlock had curled up into a little ball on the couch and seemed to have nodded off again. It had been far too long since Jo had seen her look as calm as she did then. Between rehearsals, technique classes, and studying chemistry part-time so she could continue her ridiculous kitchen experiments, Sherlock was overworking herself and the longer Jo looked at her, the more obvious it was. She'd noticed that Sherlock was unusually thin and tired looking that morning, but she also had more bruises than usual, her hair was frizzy and unkempt, and her fingernails were bitten almost down to the quick.
“It does? It’s kind of a big decision to make at one in the morning.” Sherlock suddenly looked a bit uncertain.
“Jo! Come look at this!” Sherlock called from where she was poking at the first victim’s slit throat.
"Yes," he replied, shifting Hamish so he could get up without disturbing him too much. "Goodnight, love."
Mrs Hudson cut her off and rose to her feet. Taking Sherlock by the shoulders, she stopped her frantic pacing and set her back in a chair. “Hush now. Take a deep breath. Start at the beginning.”
your fault. Sherlock knows that. She adores you.” A pause. “In fact, she asked me come check on you, she’s terribly worried about you. You’re not eating enough, she said.”
“Jo. Of course I knew who you were considering,” Sherlock replied in her best ‘aloof-consulting-detective’ voice, which had long since stopped being effective on Jo.
“Oh, you suppose, do you?” Jo's smile turned predatory, her hands sliding from where they had been resting on Sherlock’s hips to the curve of her arse.
“Hmm?” Jo looked up from the toast she was buttering and smiled at her, but Sherlock wouldn’t meet her eyes.
Jo inhaled sharply and choked on her wine; Sherlock leaned over and thumped her on the back until her coughing subsided. “That doesn’t actually work, you know,” Jo informed her once she’d caught her breath.
“Nonsense, dear, I don’t mind. I enjoy the company. Sherlock may be a bit jealous, though,” Mrs Hudson teased.
“Come here, bee.” Jo turned, shifting them both until she was holding Sherlock against her chest. She pressed a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head before speaking again. “Listen to me, hm? I know you weren’t carrying our baby, sweetheart, but you lost her just as much as I did. And you’re allowed to grieve, and to be angry, and to be hurt. But we’re in this together, yeah? Both of us.”
"You're alright now." He pressed a kiss to the top of the boy's head. "Try and go back to sleep. You're safe now, it's alright."
“Of course I would help you, sweetheart. I’ll always take care of you, yeah?” she picked up Sherlock’s hand and pressed a kiss to her palm, smiling at her. “I’ll take care of both of you.”
“I don’t know. Mycroft got an email and tried to leave, but Greg stopped him. I think they’re arguing now.”
Sherlock nodded. She slid the completed paperwork across the counter to the nurse, then gulped the last of her tea. “Thank you for the tea and advice, but I really should get back to my wife now.”
, was… good. There was no harm in it, Sherlock decided, if a bit hesitantly. “I… yes, alright. Yes.”
“I'm alright,” Jo assured her. “I got up too fast, is all. It's already mostly passed.” And it had. Her vision had cleared and her head had more or less stopped spinning.  She did still feel a bit weak and shaky, though, so she decided that it was probably best to stay where Sherlock had put her.
“Could you two give it a rest for just a few minutes?” Jo demanded eventually, frustrated by the tense silence that neither she nor Greg had dared break. “I’d really just like for us to have a nice dinner.”
Jo sighed, resigned to losing the argument. “I'd tell them to take a pregnancy test. You're right, of course. But sweetheart, I'm almost forty. And it took my mum ages to get pregnant, I remember her telling my aunt about it.”
"I suppose I could eat a little bit," Sherlock conceded, sitting down at the table and watching as Jo filled two bowls.
Jo thought. “It’s up to you of course,” she backtracked, “it’s your body after all, so ultimately you get to decide.”
"We will, sweetheart. You definitely need a long sleep in a real bed. But, frankly, you stink. You need a shower."
Sherlock’s crashing and yelling must have woken Mrs Hudson as well. She appeared in her bedroom doorway wrapped in a dressing gown. “That had better be her chemistry equipment she’s smashing and not my china!” she said by way of greeting.
“Oh, I don’t mind,” the nurse - Sherlock really should have asked her name - said warmly. “It’s understandable for you to be concerned. Her poor body’s going through quite the upheaval, at the moment.”
Sherlock crossed her arms petulantly but didn’t answer. “You got lucky the first time,” she pouted, “but how did you
Sherlock woke with a start, sitting upright even before he was fully awake. For a moment he wasn't sure what had woken him, until he heard a small, distressed cry from the upstairs bedroom.
“So, if you’ve already tried once, what was it you wanted to ask us? Surely all this isn’t necessary just to request a repeat donation?” Greg looked more than a little confused, glancing between them and Mycroft.
“We were actually planning on using a sperm donor,” Jo replied, putting on her Doctor Watson voice to mess with Greg, who promptly choked on his beer. Jo caught Sherlock’s eye and winked. “It’s more reliable, and so much more affordable – especially with Mycroft to help smooth over any legal issues.”
Sherlock blinked herself awake and smiled sleepily at Jo. “Oh. Yes. I think it should be you who carries, at least the first one.”
She felt a little as if she was still on the stage performing: confident, untouchable, and a tiny bit light-headed. Part of her wanted to scoff at the ridiculous sentimentality of it -- she had placed well in competitions before, obviously, but this felt different, somehow. After the crisis of confidence she had had a few weeks before Sherlock had been pushing herself, re-choreographing her solo and striving to perfect it in such a short time, and the plaque in her hands proved that she had succeeded, and that it was worth it.
“Mmn, fine,” Jo grumbled, “I'm up.” She pushed herself to her feet, feeling more than a little weak and off-balance but not wanting Sherlock to see. She made it most of the way to the bathroom door before she had to stop, clinging to the door frame, black spots clouding her vision.
Sherlock was at Jo's side in an instant, one arm tight around her waist to support her weight, her face pinched with worry. “I've got you, come on,” she murmured, half carrying Jo over to sit on the closed lid of the toilet. She sat down on the edge of the tub, keeping one hand on Jo's back, warm and comforting.
and still occasionally forgot to speak English (which was technically her second language) when she was drunk or very tired. It would be endearing, Jo thought, if it didn't make it difficult to understand her at times. Johanna Watson was good at many things, but languages were not one of them.
, to watch such a tiny creature develop into a person with opinions and ideas. A brand new mind, a new
Jo didn’t answer. She was curled away from the room, earbuds in her ears, phone clutched in her hands. Whatever was playing was
of the pregnancy tests she’d bought, Jo was about to vibrate out of her skin with nervous anticipation. “How long did you say it would take for them to process?” she asked for what was possibly the millionth time.
“Yes, he was.” They stand there for a moment, awkwardly silent, until Jo breaks it again: “ThismightbetotallyinappropriateandIhardlyknowyoubutI’velikedyouallsemesterexceptIsortofassumedyouwerestraightandnowthatIknowyou’renotwillyougooutwithme?” The words came out all in a rush, and she clapped a hand over her mouth.
“We tried it that way first, actually. I. Um. I had a miscarriage a few months ago, and we haven’t really been trying since then.”
Sherlock startled and whirled around, collapsing out of the arabesque she'd been holding -- well, wobbling in, really -- and landing on her bum with an annoyed huff. "Well, it wouldn't have been if you hadn't been distracting me. What are you doing here?"
"Of course not." Jo kissed her cheek again and shifted to sit at the opposite end of the sofa, pulling Sherlock's feet into her lap.
Sherlock didn’t answer, but her breathing had evened out slightly, only occasional hitching sobs shaking her shoulders.
“Of course, love. Come on, let’s go lay down for a while.” Jo cupped Sherlock’s face in both hands, kissing her cheeks, nose, forehead, and finally her lips before taking her hand and leading her into their bedroom.
“If you’re carrying, we can’t ask your brother to be our donor again. I mean, unless we used my egg and your brother’s –”
Jo sniffled and frowned, slightly taken aback by Sherlock’s quiet confession. “You seemed so unaffected by it, after the first few days... “ she trailed off, a guilty expression crossing her face, then shook her head. “I’m so sorry, love. I should know better than that by now. I know you’re not the unfeeling arse you like to pretend to be.” The joke fell slightly flat. “Are you alright, sweetheart? I feel like we’ve hardly spoken lately.”
“I said, the entire concept of sexual selection and parental investment theory is heteronormative, outdated, and vaguely sexist. It doesn’t take into account the existence of gay or bisexual people.”
Sherlock scrambled awkwardly to her feet, her heart pounding in her chest, and picked her way across the crowded stage to  where the announcer was waiting with a medal and a small plaque. She hadn't even heard the announcer say her name, let alone the specific award she was being given -- what was the plaque for? -- but curtsied gracefully to the audience and the adjudicators anyway, searching the crowd for Jo. Perhaps it was the lights, but she couldn't see her, and her smile faltered a bit as she turned to go back to where Molly was still sitting, beaming at her.
Jo pulled her back in and tucked a loose curl behind Sherlock's ear, laying her hand gently on her cheek. “No! No, sweetheart, no. That's not it. I must be due for my period, my boobs are killing me. I'm sorry, it's nothing you've done.”
Jo woke up sobbing and drenched with sweat. The cramps low in her belly sharpened, and she curled in on herself. Her breathing was harsh and ragged.
, with no makeup or fancy costumes or pretense, and Jo wished not for the first time for a proper camera to capture the moment.
"Yes, all right, Miss Thing." Jo dragged her thumbnail up the arch of Sherlock's foot, tickling, making her squirm and giggle. "You need a shower, love."
Jo kissed her cheek, fond and mock-exasperated. “Oh shut up, you git. You love having your hair washed for you.”
By the time Jo had changed and gathered her things, both women were nearly asleep on their feet. Sherlock had composed herself enough to lead Jo out of the hospital and into a waiting taxi, then tucked her under her arm. Jo was asleep as soon as the taxi pulled away from the curb; Sherlock watched the city flash by the window, silent tears coursing down her cheeks.
She still wasn’t looking at Sherlock, having buried her face in Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock kissed her head  again, not entirely sure what to say to comfort her. “You’re going to be an amazing mother some day. Any little girl would be lucky to have you.”
a student sitting behind Jo shouted out. Jo turned to glare at him, not at all surprised to see that it was a stereotypical white-frat-boy who’d made the comment.
“Of course.” Another kiss, this time to Jo’s cheek. “It wasn’t your fault, Jo. Miscarriage is no one’s fault, I know you know that. You’re an excellent doctor, after all. It just happens sometimes.”
Eventually, Sherlock sat back and looked intently at Jo. “I was meant to be comforting you,” she frowned, “not the other way around.”
Sherlock seemed to consider it for a moment before she answered. “I can’t see why not. Lestrade likes children as a rule and I don’t think he’ll have more, so I think he’d enjoy being the doting uncle if we were to have a baby. He’s demonstrably the type of person who wants to help his friends in any way he can, and he happens to be sleeping with my brother which – while
“Sherlock…” Jo rubbed at her forehead, where the start of a headache was threatening. Sulky Sherlock was much more difficult to get into proper clothing than flirty Sherlock, which was what Jo had been hoping for. “Come on, you agreed that we should ask Greg sooner rather than later. Let’s just get it over with, hmm?”
“Alright, genius, of course you did,” Jo said, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. “Tell me how you knew, then, go on.”
, and most dancers who go pro are already with a company by the time they're twenty, and I'm still with a local school -- I've been with the same studio since I was four, and Mummy and Mycroft and even Dad say that I should focus on school and choose a career and think about my future -- but I
When the taxi pulled on to Baker Street, Sherlock wiped her cheeks and nudged Jo awake. She paid the fare, then jumped out to open Jo’s door for her. She wrapped an arm around her waist, helping her out of the taxi and up to their flat. “Do you want anything? I can make tea, if you want?”
Jo sort of shrugged. “Well, we’re not sure there’s anything wrong, yet, bee. It’s just a precaution for now, okay?”
“I mean, I definitely think we should talk about it again when you’re more awake,” Jo agreed, “but to tell you the truth, I was sort of hoping that I’d be the one carrying the baby.”
“Well, I mean, I think most little girls dream of growing up, getting married, and having a baby,” Jo answered, a bit awkwardly.
Jo sighed, rubbing at the spot on her forehead where a headache threatened.“I know you do, sweetheart. And I appreciate it, I do. Just… I’m fine, okay? I don’t need to be coddled constantly.”
“Don’t fret, lovey,” the nurse said soothingly, having noticed Sherlock’s distraction. “I’ll let you go back to your sweetheart soon. I just wanted to check in with you. Are you alright?”
“Nightmare,” Jo said shortly. As much as she appreciated Sherlock being there, she didn’t much feel like talking. “I’m fine.”
Jo hummed sleepily and snuggled closer to Sherlock. She was asleep almost instantly, and didn’t wake up until the cab pulled up in front of 221.
"Roll over and I'll work your calves for you. You’ve been working yourself to death the last few weeks, and I can see how tense your legs are from here. You're going to injure yourself, love.”
“Did you end up getting your period? You’ve been crampy and grouchy the past few days, since I got mine.”
“Hmm. I love you too.” Relaxing back against Jo, Sherlock buried her face in the crook of her neck. Within moments she was a warm, sleepy weight in Jo’s arms.
After a few minutes, Hamish's cries slowed and he looked up at Sherlock. "Daddy? Wh - where's Papa?"
"Of course I do, sweetheart. Especially when you blush. You turn the prettiest shade of pink." Jo went over to the bed and cupped Sherlock's face gently in both of her hands, then pressed quick, soft kisses to her forehead, her cheeks, her nose, and finally her mouth.
Sherlock rolled her eyes, one arm wrapping protectively around Jo’s shoulders. “Of course you had no idea, Lestrade, don’t be an idiot. How would you have known? It’s not like we told anyone.”
“This isn’t. Um.” Jo paused and looked down at her lap. “This isn’t the first time I’ve been pregnant.”
Greg looked briefly, horribly uncomfortable, which made both Holmes siblings snicker childishly. “And the other shoe drops,” Sherlock said, her smile turning slightly evil. Mycroft quirked an eyebrow at her.
Slightly surprised at the question, Sherlock didn’t answer right away. She read through the discharge papers quickly before signing them, then looked up. “I… I’m about as well as can be expected,” she answered finally, pleased that she sounded marginally more composed than she felt. “I’m mostly worried about Jo. She was raised in a very sexist, traditional household. As well as the physical discomfort of miscarrying, she is likely to see this as a personal failure.” It was more than Sherlock had intended to say, and she flushed slightly. “Sorry, you probably aren’t interested in the details.”
“I’ve tried, I really have. It’s difficult, though. I -- I had a nightmare, that first night, do you remember?”
Sherlock blinked again, then seemed to come back to herself. “It’s not your fault.” She crossed back over to Jo’s bedside and took her hands, nearly frantic with worry all over again. “That’s why they admitted you, isn’t it? The bleeding? Are you in a lot of pain? Is there anything I can do?”
turned out to be blue surgical booties, which Donovan pulled out of her bag and Sherlock immediately turned up her nose at. She looked absolutely appalled, but Jo knew that concern over her expensive Oxford heels would win out over her vanity.
[14:25] Apparently you were wearing Mycroft’s tie at a crime scene. Not exactly subtle enough to keep Herself from noticing. -JWH
Jo nodded and delivered the requested beer, the disappeared back into the kitchen. This left Greg alone with the Holmeses again; they seemed to be having some sort of silent argument solely using facial expressions. Greg sighed and cracked open the can of lager Jo had handed him – he had a feeling it was going to be a very long evening at this rate.
Sherlock hummed but didn’t answer. She snuggled even closer, pulling the duvet up to her chin. “I still think using a sperm bank is a good option,” she said after a few moments. “Just to keep in mind. I mean, people adopt all the time – you don’t need a biological link to be a ‘real’ family.”
"He had to go in to work, he'll be home soon," Sherlock promised softly, stroking the boy's sweaty curls back from his forehead.
“Wake up, Jo.” Sherlock fiddled with a tangle in her hair, tugging gently, her voice slightly more insistent now.
“It’s long in the past now, dear, I don’t think much about it. But I thought it might do you some good to know that you’re not alone in this - plenty of women have trouble having a baby.”
"Probably... can't it wait? I thought we were going to bed..." Sherlock asked, quietly. She almost sounded disappointed.
The taxi ride to the hospital passed in a blur of anxiety. The cabbie must have spoken to her, but she didn’t respond, wasn’t paying any attention. It wasn’t until she was handed a tissue with her change that she realised that she was crying. She touched one hand to her cheek, and it came away wet.
“I’m sorry, love. That’s almost as difficult as losing a wanted pregnancy, isn’t it?” Mrs Hudson squeezed her shoulders comfortingly. Without having been told, she seemed to know why Jo had brought it up. “Having to terminate a pregnancy doesn’t mean you don’t get a second chance. It was the right decision for you at the time, and it doesn’t make losing this baby your fault.”
grief and pain, and on everything she had stored in her Mind Palace about comforting a loved one, on being supportive and caring and as helpful as possible. Sherlock was so absorbed in figuring out how best to take care of Jo, she barely noticed when her thoughts turned into uncomfortable dreams as she fell into a restless, shallow sleep.
I'm marking this work complete for now, but I may end up writing a little bit more for it. For now, though, it's complete because I want to continue on to other drafts I have going for this series :)
Wrinkling her nose, Jo nodded. “Yeah, let’s get it over with.” She had worked with Dr Singh before, and knew that while she tended to be rather brisk and efficient, she was also gentle and a skilled doctor. That didn’t mean she was looking forward to it, though.
Sherlock broke the kiss -- a terrible habit of hers, in Jo's opinion -- resting their foreheads together and skimming her hands down Jo's waist to rest on her bare hips. "Go put pyjama's on, and then come to bed, please?"
And deciding to have an abortion… it’s not easy. You did what was best for yourself, and for your future. A bundle of unplanned cells is not the same as a wanted baby. Losing our baby is not punishment for not having that one, so please put that out of your mind.”
Jo dried out the shower with her own towel and hung it over the rack with Sherlock's, then brushed her teeth and headed through to the bedroom.
There was a small, scattered round of applause when some of the less-stressed dancers caught sight of Sherlock. She blushed and sketched an awkward little half-curtsy in acknowledgment, embarrassed and pleased and unable to wipe the grin off her face. She was more than a little bit shocked at the other dancer’s reactions -- she wasn’t especially well-loved at the studio, workaholic introvert that she was -- but it was nice to be recognized.
a lesbian!” Sherlock’s eyes were bright with furious tears by the time she finished shouting and sat back down.
It was Sherlock’s turn to shiver, then. “That’s appalling. Your subconscious is ridiculous. Of course you loved our baby. How could you not? But all the love in the world can’t save a non-viable pregnancy. I’m sorry I didn’t wake you up.”
Sherlock’s nose crinkled as she thought. “None at all,” she admitted after a moment, sounding put out.
At this Mrs Hudson gasped and covered her mouth, but didn’t interrupt, even though for a long moment Sherlock said nothing else.
“Yes. The risk of miscarriage decreases around seven weeks, when the heartbeat becomes audible, and then again at twelve weeks, at the end of the first trimester. I
Sherlock kissed her back, but didn’t answer verbally. They sat there in the quiet for long minutes, wrapped up in each other. Healing. Together, finally.
The day of the competition, Sherlock had commanded attention onstage in a sequined black leotard, black platter tutu, and a tight, black mesh veil over her face. Her pointe shoes had been dyed black for the occasion, and she wore long, elegant black gloves with sharp feathers along the outside edge. The new choreography was as harsh as it was beautiful, all dramatic leaps, sharp, precise movements, and graceful, sensual transitions. She was hauntingly beautiful, ethereal under the harsh stage lights. The audience adored her.
They listened to the recording all the way through four times. It was just under a minute long, so before five minutes passed Sherlock had taken the earbud away from Jo and wrapped her even tighter in her arms. “Please don’t shut me out again,” she said quietly. “I’ve tried giving you space, but I can’t stand seeing you hurting like this anymore. What can I do to help?”
"You're both sweet," John replied, half-smiling. He leaned down to kiss Sherlock softly. "Are you coming to bed?"
“Sherlock…” Jo started, hesitantly, “a baby isn’t a science experiment, love. It’s a permanent decision. It’s not something we can change our minds about, when they’re two months old and screaming and you haven’t slept properly in over a week. A baby isn’t something you can get bored of and abandon.”
Jo turned in the circle of Sherlock's arms. “Yes, ouch. Bloody strong violinist’s hands,” she grumbled.
After the incident with the broken dishes, and the comfort and conversations that had followed, Sherlock felt… better. Sort of. She was no longer furiously angry, no longer felt quite so battered and bruised and broken by grief. It still hurt, of course. Far worse than Sherlock had expected. Worse, she noticed families everywhere she went. All of London seemed to have a newborn baby in their arms. But she tried not to be obvious about the fact that she was still hurting. She had Jo to take care of, after all.
“Trying…? Oh, sweetheart.” Jo paused, chewing her lip as she thought. “Sweetheart, I don’t think – I told you, I don’t think I can do that again. I just – no, I can’t – I don’t want to risk miscarrying again. It would just be too hard on me. I’m sorry.”
“Yes, because I’m ridiculously in love with you. But your brother is even more ridiculous and difficult than you are, not to mention a pompous git.”
“But shouldn’t modern social science and psychology be trying to include lesbian and gay perspectives?” another student piped up, cutting the professor off again. “It’s important, after all, and since none of us like to think of ourselves as homophobic, shouldn’t we be the ones making that effort?”
Jo just nodded, tears washing down her cheeks. Sherlock squeezed her hand tightly, then let go to bury her head in both hands. Her shoulders shook with silent sobs.
“You must,” Jo assured her. “Everything’s almost ready, I’m just doing the salad and garlic bread. Greg, you want a beer?”
Jo wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist, pulling her closer. “Are you alright, sweetheart? You’re shaking a bit.”
Sherlock pushed past her without waiting for Jo to respond, frantic all over again despite the nurse’s steadying presence.
“You could barely stay awake through dinner, and didn't so much as stir when I got up this morning. Clearly you needed the sleep.”
"Thank you." Jo kissed her cheek as she set a bowl of soup in front of her, then sat down and tucked into her own portion.
Sherlock turned and stood up, her hands going automatically to Jo’s waist. She was beaming, her eyes shining and her cheeks wet. “You’re pregnant,” she confirmed.
you were in the army. But a slit throat was too much for you?” She was teasing, but still looked worried.
“I… don’t understand it, really. I’m not religious, I’ve never dealt with so-called ‘Catholic guilt’. But I can understand wanting someone you love to tell you that everything will be okay. That I can do.”
“If Doctor Singh isn't with her, and if she has it on her, then yes. She's going to be fine, but she wants you here. Oh, and if you could bring her a change of clothes, I'm sure she would appreciate it. Something comfortable.”
Jo blinked herself awake what could have been either minutes or hours later. “Wake up, love,” she said, nudging Sherlock.
Jo didn’t answer right away, looking far away and thoughtful. “I think it would have been a little girl,” she murmured eventually, seemingly apropos of nothing. “I’ve always wanted a daughter.”
“It was never really for me. Frank insisted that we ought to have children, and since I’d never thought much about it either way, I went along with it. It took ages for me to get pregnant the first time, but I wasn’t overly bothered.” She paused, looking suddenly sad and thoughtful. “I suppose it’s a bit sadder, isn’t it, when you really want it?”
“M’fine,” Jo insisted, panting slightly as she tried to get her breathing under control. “Go back to sleep.”
“Thank you, Mycroft, I like it too,” Jo said, taking a sip from her own wineglass. “So. How did this happen, then?” She gestured between Greg and Mycroft with her fork.
Sherlock woke on the couch with a start, sitting upright before he was fully awake. For a moment, he wasn't sure what had woken him, until he heard a small, distressed cry from the upstairs bedroom.
The question of donors didn’t come up again for nearly two weeks, thanks to the gruesome triple murder Lestrade needed their help with. The night after they closed the case, Jo reopened the conversation as they were getting ready for bed. “Have you thought at all about who we could ask to be the donor?”
Sherlock blushed, trying to subdue her smile enough to kiss Jo. It didn’t quite work; the kiss was messy and uncoordinated, their teeth knocking together a bit, and Jo laughed into Sherlock’s mouth. “I’m so proud of you,” she said, sobering slightly, “I know how much this competition meant to you.” She stretched up on her toes to kiss Sherlock’s forehead, then stepped back and held out the forgotten bouquet of flowers. “Oh! Here, I got you these. It’s not much, but I wanted to get you something.
The first two times Sherlock came home to find Jo curled up on the sofa, crying and listening to something through her earbuds, she wasn’t sure what to do. Would Jo want Sherlock there with her? Or were the earbuds meant to signal a desire for privacy? She’d been so closed off about the rest of her grief that Sherlock was uncertain of her welcome in this. Instead of saying anything, she made Jo a cup of tea, left it within arm’s reach, and made herself scarce.
“Well, whatever it was will have to wait. The British government can run itself for just one night. This is more important.” Jo insisted teasingly, giving Sherlock a kiss on the cheek.  “Are you lot ready to eat?” she called over to where Mycroft and Greg were standing. Mycroft looked mutinous, and Greg was grinning smugly at him.
“And I am certain that you already are. Grace is incredibly lucky to have you.” Mycroft paused, leaned up to kiss Greg’s jaw. “As am I.”
Sherlock closed her eyes and held Jo closer, but said nothing. After a few moments she felt gentle fingers wiping tears she hadn’t even noticed were falling from her cheeks. Without opening her eyes, Sherlock pressed her lips to the top of Jo’s head in silent thanks.
“Apologies,” Mycroft said primly. “This wine is excellent, by the way, Johanna,” he added, lifting his glass to her.
“Mrs Hudson, you are a saint.” Jo said, leaving the bedroom wrapped up in one of Sherlock's many dressing gowns. “Let me help you with that.”
There was a long silence while Jo played with Sherlock’s fingers, frowning thoughtfully. “I… yes, I think so. I know I said I didn’t want to – the guilt and grief and shame would kill me, I can’t do that a second time – but. I know how badly you wanted the baby, and god, I do want to start a family with you. I do. So – yes, I’m saying yes. There’s no harm in trying, right?”
“Of course not. Everyone grieves in their own way. You just worry about yourself for now, dear. I’m sure she’ll understand. I made sure she had a good meal today, and I can look in on you both tomorrow as well. She’ll be alright until you get your feet back under you.”
. It was the polar opposite of her original choreography, which had left Mme Deschamps scrambling to help her put together a new routine in just over four weeks.
“I think I know better by now, Holmes,” Donovan said, briskly professional but not unfriendly. She lead them through the house, which was crawling with police officers and CSIs, to a small bathroom. “But I think you’ll want these.”
“Humor me, please?” Sherlock slid her hand down to rest on Jo’s stomach. “Try to breathe into my hand.”
When Sherlock got back to Jo’s room, she hadn’t moved at all. She was still curled up on her side, facing away from where Sherlock had been sitting. In fact, the only change to the scene was Jo’s bag and coat, which one of her colleagues must have brought from the staff room.
days was if she came downstairs to use the loo or make herself a cup of tea - which wasn’t often. She had tried knocking on Jo’s bedroom door each day at breakfast time to offer tea and toast, and again before she went to bed, but after two days of stoney silence Sherlock gave up. She had been giving Jo space, mostly because she had no idea what else to do, but now she was worried. Jo wasn’t eating enough, was isolating herself, clearly wasn’t doing well, and Sherlock
Jo laughed, stunned, and her hands moved almost unconsciously to her stomach. “I can’t believe it. It worked! We’re going to have a baby!”
“I just feel so guilty,” Jo said, her voice breaking. Her face was wet with tears when she looked up at Mrs Hudson. “I had the most awful nightmare the other night, and I just can’t shake it...”
“I can do that. I would have done it anyway, when you –” Sherlock cut herself off and chewed at her thumbnail. She looked embarrassed, like she felt guilty just for having brought it up. “Sorry, I – sorry.”
Sherlock looked down at the table, fiddling with her wedding ring. When she didn't answer or look up, Jo reached out and stilled her hands, holding them gently between her own. “You can tell me,” she said, “I won't laugh at you.”
“Why don’t you come downstairs for a cup of tea, dear?” Mrs Hudson said during a break in their conversation. “It would do you good to get out of this dusty old room for a while.”
Sherlock made a disgruntled sound, but seemed to wake up enough to stuff her feet unceremoniously into her shoes. "You're a terrible bully, did you know?"
“Yeah?” Sherlock didn’t sound entirely convinced. In fact she looked about ready to drop the idea entirely.
but there's so much to learn and so many different styles and techniques that I have to know, and the competition scene is changing so that you have to have more and more difficult tricks to have any chance at placing..." Sherlock broke off, gasping a little and pretending that the moisture on her cheeks was entirely from the shower.
Jo rolled her eyes, but smiled slightly despite the situation. “Yes, thank you Professor Google.” She sighed and took Sherlock’s hand. “Sherlock, I… it’s possible that I’m going to miscarry, love. I’ve been bleeding a lot for the last few hours.”
“Good morning, your foul eggs are burning.” Jo giggled at the mildly outraged look on Sherlock’s face. She brushed past her and flicked off the hob, where the eggs Sherlock had been frying were indeed in danger of burning.
Jo had to swallow hard against the sudden lump in her throat before she could answer, and shook her head. “He’s your
“No buts. What would you tell a patient who was trying to get pregnant, if they came in with those symptoms?”
“Yes, sweetheart.” Jo kissed her cheek and pushed her gently away, toward their bedroom. “Go on, go to bed.”
“There’s nothing else I can do? How - I don’t know what to do, or what to say - what am -” Sherlock took a shaky breath. “I just… I can’t stand to see her hurting.”
Donovan was waiting for them outside when they arrived at the address she’d given them. “Holmes, Watson,” she greeted them. “Thanks for coming out, I know it’s late. Didn’t interrupt date night again, did I?”
“Mm?” Jo shook herself awake and shifted to sit up straighter. She and Sherlock had been curled up on the couch together after supper, and she must have dozed off at some point. “What am I right about?”
Jo must have fumbled something in the shower. There was a sudden loud clatter, and Sherlock jumped, the noise interrupting her tears. She smiled weakly and wiped at her eyes, listening to Jo curse out the dropped bottle. The interruption was a welcome one, reminding Sherlock that she was not alone in the flat with her grief. There was a heavy, dull ache in her chest that she suspected would lessen if she let herself continue to cry, if she let Jo comfort her, but she refused to allow herself the leeway. The nurse had been right: she needed to be strong for Jo. Her own grief could wait.
Mrs Hudson looked concerned. She laid a gentle hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Are you alright, dear? You’re very pale.”
“I’m not sure,” Jo replied, her voice quiet and sad again. “I hadn’t really thought about it. I always sort of liked Grace, though. Or Katherine, maybe.”
“I - of course. Do you want me to wash your hair for you? Or - I don’t know, I can just keep you company, if you want?” Sherlock offered. She felt like she was supposed to be doing something, anything, for Jo, to make this easier for her, but she had no idea
Jo smiled and kissed her gently. “I’m sure, love.” She sounded confident for the first time since Sherlock had approached her with the suggestion. “I think it’s a great idea.”
Jo looked up at Sherlock, who’d hesitated in the doorway with her scarf halfway off, and sort of grinned. She looked excited and terrified at the same time, which should have made Sherlock nervous but instead sent a little thrill through her stomach.
Eventually the medals, scholarships, and other awards were announced, but by then Sherlock had tuned them out, searching the crowed for Jo and trying to deduce the other spectators through the stage lights.
It was Sherlock’s turn to frown, then. She hadn’t realised that it was still affecting Jo so much, that Jo – the strongest person she knew – didn’t think herself strong enough to handle that possibility. It surprised her, but perhaps it shouldn’t have, and Sherlock suddenly felt a lot less confident in her decision to try again. “Are you sure? If you don’t want to take the risk of losing another pregnancy… I don’t want to hurt you. That’s the last thing on Earth I want.”
Mycroft laughed. Greg thought it sounded more bitter than he’d probably meant it to and snuggled closer, pulling Mycroft securely into his chest. “Honestly, Gregory, can you imagine me with children?”
Sherlock knew that Jo was still grieving -- of course she was, she blamed herself, felt like she’d failed Sherlock -- but didn’t know what to do about it. She scoured the internet -- blogs, parenting websites, anything she could find -- for advice on what to do to help, how to make it easier for Jo. Eventually she ended up with a list of advice that seemed reasonable, without forcing Jo to talk about it. Jo had closed herself off slightly, after the night she’d spent with Mrs Hudson and the day after spent comforting Sherlock, so Sherlock looked for suggestions that were more to do with practical support than emotional support
"G'night, little man. I love you." John bent down to kiss Hamish's cheek, then offered his hand to Sherlock, who allowed himself to be lead out onto the landing and downstairs to their bedroom.
Sherlock hummed what sounded like an agreement and tucked herself impossibly closer to Jo. The last little bit of tension drained out of her and her breathing softened into a slow, even rhythm. She was sound asleep within minutes.
“No, nothing like that. It’s just… personal. It wasn’t a conversation we wanted to have in a busy restaurant.”
“I love you,” Sherlock repeated, her voice breaking. “I love you, and I’m sorry I -- sorry I asked you --” she broke down, sobbing into Jo’s shoulder.
“Yes…” Jo answered. She had an idea of where Sherlock was going with this, and she didn't like it. She knew that at her age, even with how much planning they'd done, it was unlikely that she was pregnant on the first try, and she didn't want Sherlock to be devastated when the test came back negative.
“Oh! Johanna, dear, I wasn’t expecting you home. I made a pot of soup, I thought you and Sherlock might like it.”
The next few minutes were quiet as Jo gently stretched and manipulated Sherlock's feet, the only sound the little noises of pain and pleasure Sherlock made as Jo massaged overworked muscles.
“Okay,” Jo agreed breathlessly. She cupped Sherlock’s face in her hands and kissed her soundly, brushing a stray tear off her cheek. “Okay. Let’s. Heh. Let’s do it, bee.”
Jo stared at Sherlock, too. She was hunched low in her seat with her arms crossed defensively over her chest, looking painfully embarrassed. She realised with a little jolt that there were tears on Sherlock’s face and that her shoulders were shaking. She looked like she wanted to disappear.
Greg and Mycroft didn’t linger long at Baker Street after the wine and pudding were gone. It was obvious that Sherlock and Jo were getting more and more wrapped up in one another as the evening dragged on, and eventually they left them to it.
Jo smiled and leaned down to press a kiss to the back of Sherlock's knee. "Of course, love. I'll sort out your legs for now, and take care of your poor feet when we get home."
Sherlock settled into bed to wait for Jo to finish her shower. In the quiet darkness of their bedroom, she allowed herself a moment to cry. She buried her face in her hands and her shoulders shook, but she didn’t allow herself to make any noise.
Jo squeezed her closer. “Thank you, love.” She sounded much more relieved than Sherlock had been expecting. “Any suggestions?”
A few days later, Jo took advantage of a break between patients to catch up on some charting – and to text Greg. She and Sherlock had decided to invite both Greg and Mycroft over for dinner, partially because Jo thought it would be better
"O - o - okay..." His voice caught on a sob and he buried his face in Sherlock's chest, sniffling and fighting to calm himself down.
