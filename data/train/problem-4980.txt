Dean laughed and even Cas let off a tiny smile.
Thank you again for the comments and for keeping up with this fic. I love to know what you guys think.
“Have you met us?” Dean scoffed. “We do that”.
“I know that he would never abandon you” Benny went on, as calmly as he could, keeping his hands to himself.
When he opened his eyes again, Cas was back to normal. He was even closer than before and now held Dean with both hands, keeping him steady in his place. Benny was behind the angel, looking anxiously at the hunter.
Ben was sitting at the table across from the girls with his mouth wide open. Whatever Claire had just told him (and yeah, of course, it had been Claire), the kid seemed scarred for life. Dean felt a sudden shiver at seeing him like that, hair still messy after sleep and dressed in Sam’s extra-large blue flannel. It was like being transported seven years into the past, to Lisa’s kitchen, making breakfast to a very sleepy Ben who wasn’t ready for school yet. Déjà vu really was a bitch.
He felt the angel’s fingers touch the skin of his forehead, and the same warmth that had taken over him at the garage returned. In a second, his mind was filled by white light and a high-pitched sound, the one that always accompanied his headaches. Suddenly, Ben remembered exactly where he knew that sound from. Suddenly, he remembered everything.
“Can we put it on?” The Nephilim asked, much to Dean’s misery. He took a deep breath. There was already too much suffering in his day to add my heart will go on to the list.
“Why don’t you come too, Ben?” She suggested. He froze on the spot. Yeah. Something was
The fire turned blue and then green. Castiel let it burned for a few seconds before muttering a few unintelligible words and extinguished it with a wave of his hand. So, he couldn’t light a fire, but he could extinguish it. That was interesting. Dean wrapped his fingers on a piece of cloth he took from one of his pockets and retrieved the lighter from the bow, cleaning the ashes from it before placing it on the table. Claire picked it up again.
you’re hiding something Dean”, she told him, the same defiant, fearless Claire he had grown so used to. “Maybe I can’t force you to tell me anything, but Ben is my friend”. She paused. “If you’re not going to tell me how you know each other, at least tell me he’s not in any danger. I
He looked down at Ben, who was now smiling sympathetically at him, and thought about how life seemed to repeat itself sometimes. His dad was the one who taught him to drive, but he was the one who taught Sam, just like he had done with Jack an hour ago, then Claire and now Ben. Sam had spent countless hours behind the wheel of the Impala with Dean sitting shotgun. He felt the warmth of those memories wash over him. Dean had been really small the first time his dad had sat him on his lap behind Baby's wheel. His feet didn’t even reach the pedals. But even back then, he could see John beaming with pride when he saw that Dean had a natural talent for driving. And
“Benny’s right, Cas. We’ve earned a little rest.” Cas couldn’t argue with that.
"Oh, I have plenty to be sorry for" Dean's eyes were locked on Castiel's again, and they were so intense Cass felt as if he was going to melt. "But we'll have time for that".
“Dean!” He thought he heard the angel calling him again, but it was too far away. He was being swallowed by the portal, drowning in the blue light and the loud row. He wasn’t even sure if he was breathing or not until… until he was. Just like that, the light was gone, the sound was gone and there was grass beneath his fingers. Not purgatory grass, but green, moisty grass. And it was dark. Darkness like he hadn’t seen in almost a year.
“Well, we can erase the past three days from his memory entirely”, Cas begun, very slowly, so that Dean would have time to process everything he was saying. “I can’t erase the past two years, so he would still be a hunter. I would have to do the same to Claire and Kaia”. He made a long pause. “The safest thing would be to erase Ben from Claire’s memory entirely and vice versa. Otherwise, this whole problem might just repeat itself in a couple of years, when she decides to introduce you two again”.
Eventually, Benny rose from where he was sitting and said he would go for a walk, scout the area. He wouldn’t draw much attention to himself, so it was safer for him to go alone. If anything happened, he would pray for Castiel.
“We live in a house with other men”.
“Yeah, right”, he said. “Lisa wouldn’t allow that kid near a gun in a million years. She almost kicked me out when he accidentally found one of mine.”
“Hi”, he raised his hand in an uncertain greeting. “It’s an honor to meet you, mister Winchester. I’m B…”
seemed fishy for some reason. Sam looked as surprised as Ben and threw Dean a concerned glance, to which his brother simply shrugged.
“You better go to bed now. You’re going to feel
___________________________________________________________
“You have experience with kids then?”, Ben asked. Dean froze for a second, wondering if he had underestimated Ben, if he knew something. But one look at the kid was enough to tell him that Ben was just making conversation. It wasn’t about him. Dean forced himself to relax a little.
He looked suddenly very sad, and the room fell into an uncomfortable silence. Castiel raised a hand and placed it on Dean’s shoulder in a small gesture of comfort, but Claire and Jack just exchanged an awkward look, like accomplice children who just said something wrong to their parents. He felt left out of the conversation once again.
“He’s going to get himself into trouble with or without our presence”. Castiel sighed, tired as if this was a movie he had seen countless times before. “Let’s go. I’ll fly us to him”. Without any sort of warning, he put a hand on Benny’s shoulder and they disappeared into thin air.
needed to talk to you, so she gave us a moment”
“Yeah, I bet you will…” Dean said as they marched forward. Truth is, they weren’t going to celebrate anything. He had talked about that with Benny on day one: once they were out, they would go their separate ways. He would go back to Sam and Benny would go back to God knows what. That was the deal. Besides, Purgatory was letting them go unchanged. He could sense it. You don’t go through what they were going through and emerge on the other side the same person you were before. In a dark corner of his mind, Dean knew there wasn’t going to be any kind of celebration. But he buried that thought deep and out of sight. Things were bad enough as they were without him worrying about the future.
“Some things are easier here”, the hunter finally answered, giving up and laying on his back again, eyes turned to the treetops above them. “I know that sounds nuts because nothing is easier here but…”
prevented Dean from executing said bad idea (even though sometimes Benny almost wished he would). It was the same with finding their way out of Purgatory: Cas would constantly remind Dean that it was pointless to take him with them, but he wouldn’t actually leave, because that would do more than simply annoy or upset Dean. It would
“You idiot!” Claire punched him on the shoulder. “Why wouldn’t you?”
No Answer.
"Do you wanna talk about it?" it was not the most brilliant question he could think of, but he meant it. Dean's eyes locked on his for a second, then he got back to slicing tomatos.
They didn’t talk about it.
Dean froze in his spot. Cas saw the color draining from his face. He turned his attention to Claire, but she avoided his eyes.
“Rugaru”, the kid told him, flat. Ben rolled up one of his sleeves until the elbow and Dean had to fight the urge to look away. It was not the same arm Sam had patched up the day before, so neither of them had seen the damage. Ben had about eight inches of scar tissue where his skin appeared to have been ripped off. The scar extended from the lower part of his biceps to the beginning of his forearm. There were places where the skin sunk as if there was muscle tissue missing underneath. And knowing the violence with which rugarus chopped of their meals before consuming them, Dean knew it was a miracle Ben still had a functioning arm at all.
“He forgave you”, Benny said. Cas raised his eyes again, and it was his turn to look struck by something the vampire had said. “I have no idea what happened, but I know he forgave you”.
“We’ll figure it out”, Cas stated. He spoke in a low voice, directed only at Dean. The hunter’s shoulders trembled in a bitter laugh.
But he didn’t. Partially because that would mean bringing up the subject – something Dean had made pretty clear he did not want to do – but also because he needed some time to wrap his own head around it. Once the effect of the venom wore off completely, Dean returned to his usual self. Cas was afraid he would act uncomfortable or distant towards him, or that their interactions would be awkward in some way. And that happened for a short while, but it didn’t last. Just like Julietta had predicted, the monsters were not interested in leaving them alone.
“I’m referring to
The hunter paused for a second, to make sure his criticism had been given the proper attention, then cooped Cas’s face on his hands and kissed the side of his mouth.
“We gotta move!” He screamed, trying to make himself heard over the loud row that was coming from the top of the hill. He pulled Cas from the ground and held his shoulders until he was sure the angel could stand on his own. “The portal’s closing!”
"You mean we can't bring him back?" Dean finally said, without raising his eyes to any of them and keeping a low, deep voice. "We can talk to him, but that's it? We say goodbye and then let him rot in the Empty for the rest of eternity?" He faced Jack and Sam was surprised to notice the blink of a tear on his face. Dean's eyes were wet and red, but only a single tear rolled down his face. "How can you be ok with that, Jack?"
“You tell us!”, Dean growled from the front seat. His voice was deeper and rougher than it had been all morning.
had been the one who taught him to make scrambled eggs like that. When they first started living together, he had been put in charge of breakfast, since she had work and Ben had school and he was still just a traumatized mess with no job. But she
Before he could hear anything else, Ben’s vision got cloudy again. He blinked, trying to bring the world back to focus, but when he opened his eyes, Dean was older, it was daytime, and Lisa had been replaced by Jack. He felt like throwing up.
“I miss Baby”, he finally said. And there was nothing sarcastic or defensive about that. Benny lifted an eyebrow as if that had picked his interest.
The first thing he thought about when he entered the Empty was that there was no air. He could feel his chest moving as if he was breathing normally, but no air was coming in or out. The second thing he noticed was the silence. And the darkness. It was so, so terribly dark. He rephrased that on his mind. It was not dark. He could see himself just fine. It was just that there was nothing around him to see. Nothing but the rift he had just crossed.
Cas regarded Dean mindfully for a moment. “I am sorry”, he said, finally, in a resigned tone. “I know seeing him now brings you pain”.
Second, I know I'm not the most organized person in the world when it comes to updates, but I just wanted to let you know that I'll try to stick to a posting schedule as best as I can. Unfortunately, with work + university I sometimes take longer than planned to write and edit a chapter. With tess1978 helping me, the writing quality improves a lot but having a second reader also slows the editing process a little bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
But when Castiel spoke, he didn’t sound preoccupied. He sounded grounded, realistic: “Well,” he began, “even if it does exist…”
He repeated that mantra over and over in his head until he could almost believe it. Almost.
Dean smiled against himself. “And it’s not even ten in the morning”, he took a long sip of his coffee. “You guys are gonna traumatize him.”
“I think so too”, she muttered. “I have no idea what it could be, but he and Cas have been acting weird since they saw you yesterday.”
about it. Instead, he got Baby’s keys and marched to the garage. Jack, Claire, and Ben were all there already, standing by the car. Whatever Claire had told Ben after she dragged him away from the breakfast table, it seemed to have worked. He looked a lot less sad and a lot more decided. Good. Determination fit him well.
“Lunch first!”, Dean told him, shutting the one he was reading with a loud sound. He grinned softly at the angel and yes. It was
“And I told him that now he knew one and a half”, Jack added, proudly.
He was
“You said you were having headaches again”, she told him, sounding a little calmer now that he was awake.
Dean took a deep breath before finally facing Ben. He looked even more tired than before, but also more composed, harder to read.
“I’m texting Claire”, he answered, matter-of-factly. “She and Kaia made a few detours”.
“I’m fast. I can
he realized.
“How could he?” Dean’s voice was hurt. Benny sighed. Cas knew it because it was obvious. Because even a blind man could see the affection Dean directed at him. And Cas was no blind man.
“Can I ask you something?”, Sam inquired, lowering his voice. He was inexplicably tired. “Why the half-truths?”
“I can’t hold them by myself” Benny called, trying to sound as calm as he possibly could.
Still, it was too much, and Purgatory wasn’t the place to work through all that. Dean wasn’t even sure if he
“Pretty”, she said, turning the small object in her hand with a smile. She looked up at Dean: “Do I get one?”
“When I wasn't carrying two monster magnets with me, I would catch a few peaceful days now and then.”, Benny grumbled. "Simpler times..."
“You know what? No”, Dean cut Ben abruptly, without even realizing he had done it until the words were already halfway out of his mouth. He took a long, deep breath and squinted his eyes so hard he was seeing color dots when he opened them again. “I can’t do this right now”.
Cass widened his eyes. He understood what Dean had just done, and it would come at a price. He held Dean's jacket and pulled him closer.
“Hey, when you’ve stopped three different apocalypses you can talk to me about dropping weapons, ok?” He shook the frying pan at her. It was still dropping egg white, but he didn’t really care. The lower part of his jeans was already covered in it anyway. Dean was making his way to the sink when Cas’s firm hand on his arm held him in place.
“Like Déjà vu?” Cas nodded.
“Claire is extremely perceptive, yes”, Cas agreed, flat. “But it was more than that. When I wiped Dean from Ben’s memory, I rewrote it so that their interactions would be replaced by a different memory. But it is only believable because I don’t rewrite the memory entirely, just suggest a different version and let the person’s brain fill in the gaps. So basically, Ben’s brain reconstructed the memories by itself. I just decided what was the information available for it to do so.”
Kaia blinked at him as if waiting for him to elaborate on that.
“Yeah, no, I get it”, Dean waved one hand defensively, to prove that he was not judging. “We make do with what we have.” He glanced at the silver car from the corner of his eye. The poor thing seemed terribly out of place in the bunker’s garage. “Still, graduation gift? That’s fancy. Not many hunters can say something like that. Hell, most are lucky if they get to graduate at all”.
They stayed like that, with Claire buried deep in his arms, trembling and crying, for quite a while. Eventually, Jody said they were living and asked if she wanted to come or if she wanted to stay a little longer, but Claire said she wanted to go home. Dean watched her enter the car with the other girls and hoped Castiel could hear her prayers, wherever he was because she would pray for him. And she would eventually resolve her feelings, just as he had eventually resolved the feelings he had towards his father when he passed. Just as he would eventually figure out what to do with his feelings towards Cass, he hoped.
“Do I know him?” Jack inquired. He had finally managed to open the lucky charms box and fish the toy from the bottom. He was currently dumping an insane amount of cereal into a bowl (thank God Sam wasn’t there to witness the amount of sugar Jack was about to consume).
If looks could kill, Castiel’s death glare would have incinerated Dean on the spot. The hunter simply raised his hands defensively and made an innocent face, as if telling him ‘
“Did you know I practically rebuilt her from scratch?” He asked. Cas did not know that. Dean’s smile faded from his face, replaced by a much darker expression as he began to speak “About three years before we met, I guess. My father, Sam, and I… we were hit by a truck. The car was absolutely recked. Almost nothing left.”
This is it, guys. Your comments were what motivate me to keep writing and I want to thank you all so much for the support and for sticking around with me to see where this story was going.
“You can do this while sitting down, Cas”. Without thinking too much about it, Dean grabbed Cas by the sleeve and pulled him down. He was obviously not strong enough to
Besides family time, which got in the way of the two of them trying to work things out privately, there was the fact that Cass was now human again, and he took a few days to fully adapt. He had been human only a few years back, and still remember most of it. But some things, such as brushing his teeth, somehow eluded him. Dean thought it was quite adorable. What was a bit less adorable and a lot more annoying was the fact that Cass needed a lot of sleep. It was almost as if he was making up for the past five years he hadn't slept at all. He was absolutely exhausted for the first couple of days. He would go to bed early and wake up late. And when he awoke he had Sam and Eileen all over him making sure he was feeling ok. Dean couldn't count how many times he had the urge of throwing Cass on the impala and driving away so that they could have some freaking time alone.
“Cas has his hands full right now”, Sam retorted, making the final cap, and cutting the thread with a pair of scissors.
“Dean”, he told her, after a long yawn. His eyes couldn’t stay open anymore. Ben let himself drift away into the darkness (why was that bed so comfortable?!?) The last thing he told Claire before shutting off completely was: “I took it from his bag because I knew he was going to leave. I didn’t want him to leave”.
Ben swallowed hard, looking anxiously from the empty road ahead of him back to Dean.
“You say that, but…”
Jack and Dean disappeared down the hallways and returned ten minutes later with their hands full of flasks, bottles, and boxes that looked weird and smelled weirder. Castiel had asked Claire to retrieve a wooden bowl from the kitchen, and as soon as he had the ingredients, he started chopping and pouring everything with extreme care. His movements were meticulous and very well calculated, like a doctor performing delicate brain surgery. Ben watched the whole thing in awe. This was a new side of hunting, one he had never been exposed to before. He wanted to learn as much as possible.
Jack was clearly doing everything he could. He had probably tried to bring Castiel back in every single way he could think of. And he had been trying to do so alone for the past few months. He had all this power and yet he couldn't save the one person he cared about. Sam could not imagine how hard that was for him. Dean did not seem able to realize that. He looked enraged and destroyed at the same time. Now Sam was actually afraid he would punch Jack in the face.
“This is me trying,” Dean whispered pleadingly, maintaining direct eye contact, not letting go of his hand. He tugged gently to silently urge Cas back onto the bed. When Cas was finally seated again Dean launched himself at Cas, wrapping his arms around him, hugging him close and burying his face into Cas’ neck.
“You sound, I dunno, like, shocked or something.”
“I will stay out of your way as much as possible,” Cas said and was deeply grateful the words came out normally and not watery. He grabbed his bag and dragged it behind him to the open bedroom door. Tears were spilling before he even closed it behind him.
“We want to get Cas out of the Empty,” Dean said plainly, downing the coffee and immediately refilling his cup.
Castiel leaned forward to gently kiss Dean. It wasn’t anything more than a momentary press of lips on lips. But it was intimate, a connection, a promise to stay and a promise to be there for him to hold onto.
“Cas, Cas I hope you can hear me.” Dean’s voice quivered, he checked behind him quickly to make sure Sam hadn’t silently slipped into his room. He wiped the tears trailing down his cheeks with the back of his hand and cleared his throat.
“Dean asked me to be here,” Cas replied; it was clear he was trying to sound neutral. The thing is, however, ever since Cas had welcomed feelings, emotions, and plain
“Yes, Jack! You absolutely did the right thing,” Sam smiled at him. Jacks returning smile was so big that it lit up his entire face.
And when he went, Dean was left with nothing. And Cas had been the one to make that decision.
“I cannot promise that I will stay awake the whole time, but I would love to,” Castiel said, getting up. “Just give me thirty minutes to make my bed and shower and everything.”
“Yeah,” Dean swallowed heavily. “I found it one day when I got lost fetching Sam from a friend’s house. I really liked the tranquility. I’d come here when things got difficult. It felt a little like an oasis, something untouched by my real life, you know?”
“And, we can only come once a week?” Gabriel asked and Meg nodded.
Castiel nodded into Dean’s shoulder, and then, somehow, they were both lying down. Dean moved and manipulated them a bit so that they were laying the right way on the bed, both of their heads resting on the pillow, without once letting go of Castiel. Dean moved his arm so that he was fully cradling Castiel against him.
“Dean, you were not in the right mind to look after Sam because you have not looked after yourself for fifteen years. And on top of that your mind and psyche was riddled with misplaced guilt. Dean, you are both important. You both deserve help. You were looking out for Sam, and I was looking out for you. And everyone else in your life who looks out for you agreed with me and my decisions, including Ms. Harvelle and Mr. Singer, as was mentioned to you before.”
But if this, a superficial conversation and a table-length distance between them, was all he could get, Cas would take it, take it happily, take it gratefully.
“Clarence,” she greeted, jumping up from her seat and throwing her arms around him in one fluid and familiar motion. Despite the heaviness that generally attached itself to Castiel like a twisted shadow, he found himself smiling.
“So, Jack would be left solely with the Nephilim powers but none of the God juice,” Sam concluded, eyes wide.
Dean’s arm snaked up his back until his hand rested at the base of his skull. Dean started massaging gently.
And that was very unusual. Dean never skipped a meal, was always eating or snacking. At least he used to. Maybe he’d changed.
“So, in your story on Monday, you said that as a kid you always wanted to learn how to cook or whatever. With honey, in particular. And yeah, so I learned to cook and bake quite young and pie is, like, my favorite dessert ever, so I thought, like, we could combine the two? I know a recipe for a honey, ginger pie type thing. I thought we could make it.” Dean felt like he was swallowing sandpaper, “But like, if you aren’t interested or whatever then really, I can do it on my own, and you can still have some, obviously, and…”
“I am aware of the tradition,” Cas said softly.
“About us.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Holy fuck,” Dean breathed.
Cas whirled on Dean; eyes huge. He grabbed Dean’s face between his hands, “last night was unbelievable. It was everything I have ever wanted, more than I ever believed I had the right to experience.”
She had nodded, “I will ensure they get delivered to him directly.”
“So, they took the demon spirit or life force with them in ghost mode?” Dean asked.
“It’s okay,” Dean tried to say, but the words sounded strange coming from his sandpaper covered tongue.
“She’s not here, Dean,” Castiel tried soothingly, slowly moving his hands up and down Dean’s shoulders.
“Did you have fun there?” Dean questioned. Cas noted a strained tone to his voice but couldn’t guess at the reason.
Cas nodded, “Yes. For so long, I thought there was this malevolent God watching over us, wearing the mask of benevolence as he planned each of our stories, tested our faith, set us on what was supposed to be a virtuous journey, although fraught with unpassable tests… And I just don’t anymore. The longer I’m away, the more I learn… It’s like now I realize that there is no righteous path; it’s just people trying to do their best in a world where it is far too easy to do your worst.”
Because it was that, too.
“He’s staying with you?” Castiel gaped. Meg did not like strangers in her space.
But still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester.
“The Empty is still in his head,” came Eileen’s soft response. Three heads turned to look at her and Eileen exhaled audibly.
The name burned his brain, brought a pain so sharp and sudden that Dean jerked the car. Sam’s head twisted sharply, and he stared at Dean, eyes flooding with concern. But Sam didn’t say anything, just watched his older brother closely and Dean kept his eyes trained on the road. The part of him that always wanted Sam to think that things were okay, that he was fine, itched to put his brother at ease. But he could not do it. Not this time. He would not be able to say the words:
Dean flicked a glance to Cas. The blue eyes were boring into his, a glacier of undivided attention. Dean felt itchy all over. His tongue felt swollen, cutting off the words that were hesitantly trying to leave his mouth. Dean closed his eyes and counted to five then opened his mouth again, trying to hold on to the resolve that he had felt entering this room.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And lastly, I didn’t give you the easy way out. Because this next part, Dean, this next part is
He was a
Cas was at both of those visits, and although he didn’t get to say much, he sat next to Dean and held his hands or drew nonsensical patterns on the skin of Dean’s forearms.
He stayed like that for a while, in the strange limbo space where he was half asleep and half fighting his own mind.
Dean was definitely blushing now. “Well as long as I’m playing the role of a kid.”
“What?” Cas asked, clearly perplexed.
Which, admittedly, is a very strong reaction to a dude he hasn’t even seen, let alone met. But Dean was not about to analyze that because the heartbeat in his ears was deafening and his fingers were curling into fists.
“Hello,” he said n greeting, right hand lifted in that familiar way of his.
Dean was trying to hold back.
Castiel just kept staring at Dean’s bed, not even bothering with his book anymore, which lay forgotten on his pillow. As the clock trudged closer to three, Castiel couldn’t take it anymore. He jumped from where he was seated and started making Dean’s bed. As he straightened out the sheets and fluffed the pillows, he realized that it was very likely that Dean would come back to the room during the visitation hours. Amara didn’t usually stay for the full hour and a half, and Dean knew Castiel would be out of the room. Following this thought, he walked over to where his notebook lay and tore out a piece of paper on which he wrote:
“Cas, baby, please don’t be gone. Wherever you are, please be okay. Please don’t … Please don’t leave me. I’m coming to get you okay? Cas, I’m coming please just… I’m coming, wait for me.”
“When Amara comes,” Dean whispered unevenly, “will you be there with me? No pressure of course, I just, there’s no one else, and I don’t really want to deal with this alone.”
He was busy trying to make sense of the mess in his mind when he spotted Dean Winchester looking around quite frantically while running a hand over the bottom half of his face. Castiel felt that twinge of curiosity that took root in him earlier bloom a little brighter as he watched Dean. He really was beautiful. Castiel blushed at the thought, and as luck would have it, that was the moment Dean noticed him. Dean looked at him quizzically, smiled and then jogged over to where Castiel was standing, who was seemingly unable to make himself move.
Dean felt like he was trying to navigate through an earthquake. The floor seemed to vibrate and twist below him as he walked beside Castiel to their room. Castiel had not said anything, and Dean did not want to be the first one to break the silence, did not think it was his place to do so. Castiel looked exhausted and he seemed quite dazed. His eyes were distant and he was clearly stuck somewhere between reality and wherever his thoughts were drifting off to.
But here he was, frozen.
“Castiel, look at me.”
“Then I will come home,” Jack agreed.
Thirdly, I joined tumblr! I have absolutely no idea how to use it, but if anyone wants to come say hi that would be great! I don't have a lot of Heller friends in real life, so it would be great to chat to you! You can find me as AngelWithoutAShotgun there as well.
Who was going to pay the rent? What was going to happen to his apartment? What about his monthly deposits into Sam’s college account? How far behind schedule would this put him in terms of savings? Pressure was building in his head, and his chest felt tight. This past week had felt like a fever dream, but something about the idea of Amara sending him somewhere to do fucking
“When you said that you are the only member of this wildly popular club,” Dean pressed a gentle kiss to Cas’ temple.
“It makes perfect sense to me. You were forced to grow up when you were very young, so you liked the story of a boy who never had to,” he said as he slipped into bed. Dean immediately clung onto him, resting his head in the juncture of his neck.
. But no pressure, obviously :)!
“Dean, you don’t - ”
“I can’t. I literally do not have anywhere else to go, Dean.”
And it was great to be outside again, great to have more freedom and choices again, great to be around Meg and Gabriel again.
He collapsed onto his bed and dug his fists into his eyes trying to scrape the look on Dean’s face from his retinas, scrub it from his memory.
“You look uncertain,” Cas stated, eyes never leaving Dean’s.
“Thirdly, you need to stop thinking things like that, saying things like you don’t care what happens to you, and making decisions that put you in harm's way. Because you may not care what happens to you, but I do. Sam does.”
Cas smiled and moved completely out of the car, shutting the door gently.
Dean would have, of course, paid for it if he had to because, come hell or high water, there was just no fucking way he was missing Sam’s wedding. He just wanted to make sure there weren’t options that weren’t going to leave him bankrupt upon returning to American soil.
“But Jack, you’re God can’t you just remove the Empty’s influence,” Dean pleaded, hating how vulnerable he sounded.
Hannah perked up at Castiel actually initiating conversation, “Yeah, that looks like her.”
Yes, he did go to grad school. He was, in fact, currently working towards his PhD.
Castiel placed the note on Dean’s pillow as he grabbed his hoodie and headed out the door.
Have a great week everybody, and stay safe!
in the bed. His heart started thumping wildly in his chest as he scrambled to his feet,
He was on fire.
. I submitted the first chapter to my beta yesterday and I am likely to start posting that in about two to three weeks! It will still be angsty but will be dealing with less heavy subject content.
“I swear, Cowboys have the same effect on you as drugs,” Castiel laughed as Dean pushed the door open so hard, the bang of it hitting the wall echoed down the deserted hall. The excess energy seemed to be in control of his limbs and actions.
Dean huffed out a laugh, squeezing Castiel’s hand gently before he pulled away and started pulling at the hair at the nape of his neck.
“I was not your responsibility, yet you took care of me more than our parents ever did. Gabriel, you have nothing to be sorry about.”
“A lie of omission is still a lie,” Castiel was very bothered by this information about Amara.
But there was no way Dean could have said that. That level of vulnerability was not something his mutilated soul could survive. So, he kept quiet. Rather a lie of omission than an outright corruption of the truth.
“He’s our kid man,” Sam said, his lips twitching, “and he really is just a kid.”
Dean fought the urge to ask him if he was okay. Fought the urge to hug him. He fought them hard.
Castiel sat upright. “No, I want to talk about it. But I am very tired, so can we do it over coffee?”
Dean got up from the bed and went to open the door. Jody was standing there with a coffee in hand.
“Yes, you did,” Castiel smiled.
“You may have noticed that anger is Dean’s default response to traumatic events. It’s a coping mechanism. It’s not how he really feels,” Sam said not making eye contact with Cas.
But it was. So, he did.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
He checked his phone and saw he had two
Dean’s voice was hard and cruel, so different from anything Castiel had experienced from him before.
After a while, Meg pulled away, laughing slightly as she dabbed at her eyes, “I’m fine. Sorry.”
He gripped Dean’s shoulder tightly, as he lowered his mouth, leaving a trail of slow, open mouthed kisses down his chest and his stomach. Dean made that breathy sound again when Castiel’s fingers dipped just below the waistband of his jeans. That was Castiel’s sound, the one he had made Dean make. The rush from hearing it was enchanting, and feeling Dean writhe below him was euphoric.
Now, without further ado, lets see how Dean deals with the memory recall!
What neither of them realized, as they both dipped into unconsciousness wrapped up in each other, was that their lives, in fact, would actually become increasingly complicated in a couple of hours, when Dean would wake sweating and gasping for air.
“But, the sentiment is still true. Even if I have the worst case of foot-in-mouth on this side of the equator. If I didn’t have you Castiel… My life would completely suck without you. Okay?”
“Like there are needles poking at my skin, but from the inside. But it doesn’t really hurt either? I don’t know, it just feels like there is something moving under my skin but with, like, a scaly back?” Dean’s brows furrowed further, and he started pinching at the soft, pale skin on the inside of his wrist. Castiel gently tugged the offending fingers away and laced his own with Dean’s.
Dean eventually calmed down and gathered Cas close to his chest, buried his head in the angel’s shoulder and held on. He held on as if Cas were the last life preserver on a sinking ship, because if Dean was honest, that was exactly what the seraph was. And Cas was reciprocating, in both action and emotion. The arms around Dean’s shoulder and neck digging into his skin with the same desperate energy Dean felt leaking out of his very pores. Dean wanted to melt into Cas, wanted to feel him on every surface of his skin. A single tear slipped down his cheek as he moved one of his arms to touch the back of Cas' head. Dean didn’t move his hand, resisted the urge to run his fingers through his hair and memorize the texture, but he held on.
Dean let out a frustrated sigh as he placed the empty plate on his side table. He ate all three of his meals on the bed today like he often did back in college as his dorm obviously didn’t have a dining area.
“I always get here at this time,” she said cheerily.
“I am so much better than okay, Dean,” Castiel murmured into his skin. He punctuated this by placing a kiss right in the center of his sternum, “It’s just all so new and the way I feel is quite overwhelming.”
relief from the agonizing guilt that had continuously dug a hole in his gut since the day he had kicked Castiel out of the bunker. One night would not suddenly make things right after the weeks of solitude Castiel had been forced to endure. This was, however, the best he could do for now, and god-fucking-dammit, he was going to do it.
he added in his head.
Dean gripped Castiel’s hips firmly, his finger’s splaying over his lower back, “Someone’s confident tonight.”
Well, he wanted to do more than that. A whole lot more than that if he was being honest. But not right now. Not tonight. He hadn’t slept though the night for weeks, his evenings had been fraught and alive with both anxiety and pain, and he somehow knew that if Cas were next to him, the angel’s light would chase away the dark demons crawling in his mind. He, however, would not go to sleep without having this conversation. Dean knew that it had been a long time coming. It was time to end what Sam had called “the dance” the two had been doing. Dean was tired of circling; he was ready to dive in.
“I’m fine,”
Dean flicked his eyes over to Cas, “So, is there, then?”
Although Dean had a wonderful start to the day, he definitely was not having a wonderful time right now. He stared at the clock next to Missouri’s door as he fidgeted on the yellow couch. He has had three individual sessions with her, and, so, today marked his fourth. They had already discussed far more than Dean ever thought he would ever be forced to confront, let alone analyze. He left her office, on Mondays and Fridays, feeling like his skin was flambéed. They had talked about his savior complex (which he didn’t have), his self-esteem issues (which he definitely didn’t fucking have), and Missouri had, in their last session, warned him that they would be discussing his relationship with John today.
“Bite me,” Dean grumbled as he mussed his own hair. Dean eyed his jeans that lay on a lump at the foot of his bed before shrugging and heading straight for the door still in his sweatpants. Castiel raised an eyebrow at him.
Cas moved his mouth back slightly, so that he could take in a few quick breaths. Dean whined at the loss and that
“So, you would call it fine?”
The water kept spitting onto the mattress so Cas tried to move the bed out of the firing range as best as he could. He watched the small torrents of water for a few more minutes, but shortly after Dean hung up with Billie, he switched the water off. The water didn’t stop but decreased in velocity significantly.
“Dean, you always do what you think is best, even if that means lying to me, to Cas, to anyone you care about. As long as you think it’s the right thing, you’ll do it.”
“Cas,” he stares out at the road rather than turn to glance into Cas’s eyes. That’s been harder to do lately, look him in the eyes. Even sitting in the car like this, close to him like this, Dean feels magnetized. Feels himself simultaneously pulled into and repelled from Cas’s orbit.
“I could remove your grace, Cas, but it would likely be painful and uncomfortable.” Jack spared another glance a Dean, looking almost regretful as he said, “What do you want me to do, Cas?”
“Steve,” the man says, holding his shot towards Dean.
“So.”
Sam’s jaw tenses, “What’s the supposed to mean?”
He thinks of the apocalypse, of the seals and demons and Ruby. He thinks of killing Ruby. He thinks of sex with Ruby. He thinks of demon blood and addiction. He thinks of Sam, the child he was, the creature he became, the brother he is and always will be. He thinks of his dad. He thinks of hell. He thinks.
They never talked about it, but John never forgot about it either. When he went to bars with Dean, John watched him like a hawk. But he didn’t need to. Dean learned his lesson. Or rather, he repressed it. He repressed the memory of that kiss. He repressed any feelings he may have had.
“I don’t know. I’m not sure you can understand it, but – “
At some point he stopped. At some point, he made his way back to Baby, turned her off, and sat in the silence. At some point, he held his bloody hands limply in his lap, and felt the tears come, too.
The girls are fighting.
He wants to get out of here.
“Cas, what? Just- just hang on, man. I’ll be there in a minute and we can talk –“
Ruby rises, snatching her top from Dean’s hands and passing him his flannel. She dresses as she says, “Well, it’s pretty obvious you came here to kill me. At least at first,” she winks at him, there her expression turns somber as she says, “I don’t
But he’d let her talk. He’d listened to her as she begged for her life, as tried to push his buttons, as she abruptly came to the realization that Sam and Cas are together. She’d used it to rattle him, and it worked.
It didn’t taste like molecules anymore, it tasted like wheat and sugar.
“Dean? You alright?” Sam asks.
But after everything he’d done to Cas, saying those words, would just be asking for even more. It would be asking for something he didn’t deserve, not anymore.
“Why is this angel so important to you, Dean? You know what you’re risking here, right? For a guy who up and vanished. Why is he so important?”
Dean’s quiet again so Sam said, “Man, nothing’s going to be different between us. I’m barely twenty minutes from the bunker, and Cas’ll only be fifteen away. We’re still going to hunt together and we can-“
“We weren’t in
Sam tried again, “Cas. I don’t know what happened. But I know Dean missed-“
Dean shoots her a dangerous look that doesn’t faze Ruby in the slightest.
Dean sat up slowly, “Jack. Everything ok? You got another apocalypse brewing?”
Cas says, “I can feel you sometimes, more so recently, reaching for me. I wasn’t entirely sure what it meant. As an angel I’ve never encountered something like that before.”
“Dean?” Sam’s voice was low, “You realize it’s 2 A.M. right?”
“He did.” Sam said hurriedly, “He did. But Cas he- “
“I know something happened,” Sam said slowly as he passed Cas a plate to dry, “And if you tell me what, maybe I could talk to Dean, get him to stop acting like an ass.”
They both fell silent. Sam glanced out the window, watching the world soar past.
Dean found herself stepping closer, nearing the threshold of Cas’s room. Her hand gripped the doorframe, fingertips digging into the wood. She turned around and went to find her whiskey.
the demons win.
“I know I’m not fair,” Dean said. She was surprised to hear how solid her voice sounded, “I know it doesn’t… I am trying, Cas. I’m trying.”
“Right,” Dean nods, sipping more of his beer, “How old is he?”
Jack had vanished before he could answer.
And so what if somewhere inside he feels heartbroken that he was right, that Sam was lying, that Sam was so far gone he couldn’t see anything wrong with his addiction. So what if Dean feels like something between them is broken and can’t ever be repaired. So what if leaving Cas to watch over Sam, knowing that they’re together, makes him feel like something vile is curling through his lungs.
Emotion twisting again, Dean’s blood started to boil as he recognized Sam’s tone of voice. Though Sam had only just started speaking, Dean could tell Sam was ready to deliver some emotional speech he’d probably been practicing all morning.
“She can’t be trusted,” Cas’s growls.
Dean didn’t have an answer for that and settled for a scowl though that quickly faded leaving Dean feeling blank.
“What?” Dean snaps.
Instead, he forced himself to stand. He watched as Dean took a second uneasy step backwards and followed Dean’s gaze to the place on the wall where the Empty had been just a moment ago. When Dean looked back at Cas, his eyes looked dulled.
Steve laughs, deeper than the situation calls for. But it’s a warm laugh, and Dean finds himself smiling faintly.
“You got a lead… while in the shower?”
It’s never been that easy before, but maybe getting laid did help remove that stick from his ass, at least a little bit. Cas vanishes with a faint
And even if he stays, would he want to? Could he forgive Dean for everything he’d done and said? Could he forgive Dean for being the thing that finally broken him? Could he forgive Dean for being the reason he fell so far, so completely?
“That’s not- “
Jack was watching him again. Hands clenching tighter around the wheel, Dean refused to meet his gaze. Though he didn’t have to, cause Jack’s in everything now. So, Dean wasn’t all that surprised when Jack said, “You don’t think you both deserve to be happy?”
Dean nodded once, then pushed his plate away and continued, “Thing is, Jack, I’ve been praying to you nonstop.”
“Sam. And Ruby. He probably asked her here to fuck her.”
“Like what, Sam?”
Dean rises with a groan and grabs the phone just as the call goes to voicemail. Thinking it may be about the case, Dean opens the phone. Only to freeze.
Jack smiled gently, “Hello.”
Dean sat with her back against the headboard, arms crossed against her chest and a half-empty beer clutched tightly in one first. Her short hair was pulled back in a loose bun, strands of hair fell along her neck where they were too short to reach the bun. Her flannel lay somewhere near her feet leaving in her just a black t-shirt, jeans, and boots.
Giving up all pretenses, Jack said, “You should be there, whatever he decides.”
“He might have,” Cas says thoughtfully, “though it’s just as likely that he planned to get more of her blood. And are you sure he
Dean thinks he can hear Sam’s bitchface and accompanying shoulder roll, the one that means he’s truly annoyed but attempting to be the bigger person.
“Yeah, yeah. Come here,” Dean pulled his brother into a quick hug, and let his smile fall for just a moment.
Rolling over, Dean finds the bed empty. But the sounds from outside the bedroom door leads him to a kitchen.
“I can’t stay here, Sam,” Cas said again, “Not as a human. And I don’t believe Dean would want me to.”
And then everything that followed.
Ruby.
“You – Sorry it’s just, you seem…”
She steps toward him, “You let me live,” another step and she’s dragging him in again, lips and breath and teeth against his neck. She pulls her mouth away but stays in his space. Right in his face, words and warmth ghosting across his face she whispers, “And we can do that again.”
When Cas saw Jack sitting at the kitchen table, it almost felt like nothing had changed. Like no time had pasted between now and the last time he saw Jack sitting there.
“This is your home Cas,” Sam said softly.
“Dean…” Sam started.
Dean abruptly turns of the water. He steps out, towels off, and pulls his old clothes back on.
“Ok, well you’re wrong about that one, Sam.”
Until they peel themselves apart, skin tacky with blood and sweat and cum. Ruby talks, and Dean tries to clean himself off. Though lately, there’s been something vile inside him, something that no amount of scrubbing, fucking, or fighting has been able to wash away.
Steven orders them another round of beers, and Dean knows he should leave. But why bother, right? Where would he even go? To Ruby’s for a drunken fuck? Back to the motel where he’ll likely walk in on his brother and –
“Thank you, Sam.”
Dean said, “Well, I’ll throw on some bacon.”
Dean sighed, and noticed the slight tremble working its way through his arms. He could see the way his hands shook around Cas’s, but he wouldn’t let go.
“There’s nothing, Sam. I’ve faced this issue before. My grace has been… it’s been through a lot. I knew it likely wouldn’t last me forever, not after everything,” He looked at Sam, “I’ll be ok. I just wanted you to know.”
“Hi, Dean.”
Sam allowed herself one moment. She tucked her hair behind her ears, took a deep breath, and knocked on Dean’s door. The loud music – Pink Floyd, Dean’s mopping music – didn’t pause and Sam heard no sound of Dean getting up.
He knew why. It was Cas. It was always Cas. And more than anything, it was finally knowing that it was possible. Cas felt the same way. Cas loved him. Cas was happy with him.
With no reply, Dean took off again, running toward the room Cas had been sleeping in. Upon taking in the empty room, he took off again. Scouring the library, the shooting range, the kitchen, even his and Sam’s rooms. He even let himself glance inside the archives, fending of the memories lingering in shadows as he did so.
Dean grabs Ruby by the waist, he feels her long nails dig into his shoulder again mercilessly. He reaches beneath her shirt, feels her warm skin, and helps her take the top off completely. Her hands go to his zipper as her lips find his again.
Dean wondered dully if her eyes were red. Instead of answering Cas, she leaned back, snatched the other glass off their mini bar and fill it with whiskey.
“Like a child.”
“I know, Sam. I just wanted to make sure you’re where you’re needed first.”
“That’s. I- “ Sam stumbled over his words. Yeah, he had definitely prepared a speech.
Stepped out is maybe too kind a word. Stormed out is more like it. Dean could be like a storm when she was angry or upset. Her hands trembling like they’re caught in a gust of wind, her voice cracking like thunder, her hands lashing out like lightening.
Cas shifts, he fingers flexing around Dean’s wrists. He’s hunched awkwardly over Dean, which can’t possibly be comfortable. But there’s something strange in his eyes that Dean can’t identify.
“Dean?” Cas asks.
“Whatever. Point is, Sam, I’m good. Cas is good. Miracle’s good. We’re all good and we’ll be good when you’re off living the dream with Eileen.”
He should have just left. He leaves now.
“Your grace,” he said, looking at Cas for the first time in what felt like ages. Cas thought he saw something burning in Dean’s eyes, though before he could identify, catalogue this new look, Dean directed his attention back to Jack. Dean said, “His grace. Could you remove it?”
Cas took a long look at Sam before saying, “I need to do more research into ways to defeat Chuck. I can do that here.”
“What did you do?” Dean’s voice came out harsher than he’d meant.
Neither seems to know what to say at this point. Dean turns Baby on and eases her back onto the road.
Dean eased Baby onto the shoulder of the road again. Aiming for levity, he said, “You’re not half bad at being god, kid.”
Cas was quiet as she asked a simple question, “Why?”
Thank you for reading and commenting! I really hope you enjoyed :)
“What? No. I mean, nothing happened. Jack appeared and then he sent me here. Dean, what’s going on?”
“I don’t know what to do, Sam. It’s… I never thought I could have… I can’t.”
“Dean,” Cas’s hand comes to rest on Dean’s upper arm, and he takes and immense amount of concentration to not veer them off the road.
Sam doesn’t know how to answer. Cas doesn’t seem to expect one anyway.
“Ok, then you and I will just catch up and get lunch, I think I’ve got a case we could –“
He tells Steve to keep the lights off, which doesn’t seem to be a problem. There’s a lot of stumbling, falling over, light swearing. Dean’s had more to drink than he realized, but he’s able to undo his pants with little issue.
“So, he’s safe?”
“I don’t pretend to know your mind, Dean. In fact, I’ve always found you to be mostly inscrutable. I suppose I have to believe you didn’t mean everything you said.”
– and he felt something reminiscent of the Empty seeping into his bones. Something heavy and dark.
“Maybe?”
Even now, as he finds himself glancing around for the demon blade, he feels off kilter.  He can’t even remember that last place he had it. Did he lose it in the fight or drop it when they’d started kissing?
Dean walked back to the bar. He found Baby, safe and sound right where he left her, and sat behind the wheel for some time. Extracting himself from Steve’s hadn’t been particularly difficult, but the parting kiss in the doorway of his apartment has left Dean’s head spinning slightly.
“You won’t have to. I’ll talk Dean down and it’ll be alright. She’ll see she’s being crazy and…” Sam trailed off as Cas slowly sat back down.
Cas carefully put the plate and towel down, “There is something you could help me with, actually.”
“Well, you know all about that, right Cas.”
Dean pulls away first. He opens his eyes to see Cas staring right back at him. His eyebrows are pulled together, and his head is still tilled to the left. Despite the confusion etched into his face, Cas’s eyes look bright.
“I can’t keep doing this with her, Sam. She’s… she’s my best friend, but when she hates me…” Cas didn’t finish. But she didn’t have to. Sam knew.
He tips his head back, relishing the burning warmth spreading from his stomach to the tips of his fingers and toes. His body is buzzing when he looks up at the sky. There aren’t as many stars here as he’d like. Most of the sky is obscured by the treetops, but he can catch a few small glimpses of the moon, a handful of stars, and the endlessly black night sky.
going to kill me, you could at least put some pants on,” Ruby says.
“I don’t expect you to forgive me. And I won’t beg you to. I have done – I have always done what I think is right. If I could go back, I know I’d do it all the same,” Cas finished the whiskey in one gulp, then rose. She paused for a moment, like she had something else to say. Instead, she tapped a hand against the table and turned away.
Dean had only ever kissed a boy once. He was sixteen, new to school and prepared to leave it within the next few months. Which simply meant that Dean spent the majority of his class schedule loitering behind the school building bumming hits off the pot heads.
There were only a few days between the day Sam moved and the day Cas planned to. Apparently, Eileen’s landlord had been struggling to find someone else to rent the place and was thrilled to have a new tenant ready to move in so soon.
Dean flops onto his back, staring up at the motel room’s ceiling as his says, “Burger.”
“Right, and what exactly am I jealous of?”
“What’re you doing here?” Dean asked after a moment too long.
However, this meant that he wasn’t surprised when a few days later Sam sat him down in the kitchen.
He flung the door open with a “’Morning, Sammy,” already dying on his lips as he took in their flushed faces. Dean’s eyes caught for a moment too long on Cas’s mused hair and bare chest.
“So, what’s new Jack?” Dean asked, carefully. Cas recognized that forced causal tone of voice better than Jack possibly could.
“Hey. I, uh, I heard what happened. Or what’s happening, I guess. Are you… Are you ok, man?”
“Oh what?” Dean asks.
“Dude, you’re crazy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sorry it's been a little while, but I hope you're enjoy this so far! Next chapter will be the end and will be up eventually :)
On the first day they lived alone together, they didn’t see each other at all. Dean was in a bad mood, Cas knew, and decided it was best to continue avoiding him. He probably should have been the one to tell Dean he planned to move too, but it had seemed easiest to let Sam break the news.
Jack nodded hesitantly and said, “There’s no reason the Empty should take him, but…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas nodded lightly.
Instead, he found himself locked into Cas’s blue eyes.
Steve’s face looks slightly flushed, though it could easily be the alcohol, “Got an apartment, just up the road. Do you… are you? I don’t want to assume but…”
TW for this chapter: mention of an anxiety attack
“Dean,”
When Dean wakes up in Steve’s bed, he’s thinking of that first kiss.
Sam waited for Dean to continue. Heard him swallow another drink of whatever liquor he got his hands on and had the urge to tell him to slow down.
“Anyway. Then, I started fixing heaven. I made enough angels that everything is running smoothly up there again. Oh! And I remade the humans’ heaven, too. But I won’t spoil that for you,” Jack said with a nod, “Otherwise, I’ve been learning and exploring. I’ve seen so many remarkable things. And you won’t believe what I’ve learn about aliens- “
He made his way to Baby without remembering his walk through the bunker. For one moment, he realized it was likely a terrible idea to leave Cas alone right now. Though, he reminded himself he can’t do anything to make things better.
Feeling that this is building somewhere important, Sam gave Dean time.
, he signed to her. Still half asleep, she simply waved at him and rolled over, unconscious again before her head met the pillow.
he should stop there but – “Months? Are you serious, man? You think I’m that stupid.”
At first, Dean didn’t react, and Cas felt the wind starting to change.
Cas. He needs
She tipped her head back, shut her eyes, and let the oaky flavor settle across her tongue. Felt the warmth starting in her stomach and spreading outward in a soft buzz, down to her fingertips.
Dean feels every muscle urging him to leave. He steps towards Sam, “What’s up?”
Dean almost felt like it was the old days, at least, until a few days ago, when he came back from a coffee run to find his brother and his angel in a state of half undress in their shared motel room.
Dean jerked the wheel when he noticed Sam in the passenger seat, though he didn’t slow from the breakneck speed at which they were travelling.
“Heya, Sammy.” Dean answers, holding up the two coffees.
Sliding his untouched beer towards the man, Dean mumbles, “Chase it with that. I’ll get another.”
“I felt it. You needed me. Now, is this about the seals or have you finally come to your senses about Ruby?”
angel. Dean feels something bubbling in his chest again, something that is both a laugh and a sob.
Dean holds back an ugly reply. In fact, he holds back several. After a moment of white knuckling his steering wheel, he forces a breath out and simply says, “Just go, Cas.”
Jack smiled, “I do.”
And that was it. Dean grabbed Cas by the hips, anchored herself to them, pressed her against the pillar, and kissed her.
Sam offered a short smile and a nod. Cas gave her another long look before returning to staring at a page in her book.
“Are you alright?” Steve asks.
“You live around here?” Dean asks quickly.
“Drop it, Sam.”
He watches her closely, waiting for the twist.
Sam freezes, which is answer enough for Cas.
He took another drink and called Sam.
She rolls her eyes as he glances down, then looks around in search of his jeans.
“I’m not cool with you screwing around in my bed.”
“No, I,” Dean clears his throat, “I get it, Sammy. I do.”
Sam asked
“Neither, it’s nothing,” Dean looks back down to his hands on the sink. His knuckles are white.
“Firstly, Cas’s an angel and-“
Despite the win, despite everything, he felt heavy. Like his bones were made of lead, like each step took all of his strength. He made it down the stairs and simply stopped, unable to stop thinking about the last time he was here. He sat heavily on the bottom step. Somewhere in the back of his head he felt like he might be waiting. He didn’t know for what.
And then everything that followed. Emotions changed like a sudden cold snap or the fickle shift of the breeze.
“Ever since you banged some dude in my bed?”
She catches his eye, and seeming to read his mind, smiles, “It’s cute how often you plan to kill me, Dean.”
Sam’s eyebrows pull together, and Dean can practically see the next lie forming on his tongue.
“Well, I’ll check on Dean then.”
“That’s different.”
“But?” Dean prompted.
He could feel the calluses on Cas’s fingertips brushing against his knuckles. With one thumb, Dean found himself gently brushing against the side of Cas’s hand. He didn’t want to look at Cas’s face. Seeing the peace there, the ease that smoothed Cas’s sleeping features, made him look close happy.
and instead asks, “What seal’s next?”
TW for this chapter: mention of alcoholism and relapse
The problem of it is simple, either Dean meant what he said, or he didn’t. Either Dean’s initial non-reaction to Cas’s
Without fully realizing he’d done it, Cas found himself opening his bedroom door and wandering the labyrinthine hallways of the bunker.
His eyes at last make it to the stoic and disapproving face of Cas. Castiel. His angel. His
“What?” Castiel asked, shaking his head. His thoughts had led him far from this conversation.
“Jesus, what?” Dean half-yelled as he ripped the door open.
“That’s like ten years,” Dean eventually huffed, rubbing his forehead as if it could sort out the chaos in his brain.
Dean’s eyes shot open, his heart beating wildly in his chest. He was up and back on his knees at the side of the bed before he had fully regained consciousness.
“Thank you,” Dean said and he meant it with every fiber of his being. Cas placed a soft, quick kiss to his lips before drawing back, but he settled one of Dean’s hands between both of his own.
Every day they had a non-therapy activity. Mondays was pottery, which Dean was exceedingly bad at; Tuesdays was music or poetry, which Dean was okay at (he had learned to play the guitar a little in high school, although admittedly, he hadn’t really had the time to give the hobby the attention he had wanted to); Wednesdays was yoga, which Dean could barely participate in as he was about as flexible as a telephone pole (but he did get to watch Cas bend into strange and exciting positions, so he wasn’t complaining), and Thursdays was an open day. Which meant in the allotted hour and a half slot, they were allowed to do what they wanted given that it was an actual activity or skill.
“She told me you had the right to know, that you were stronger now, and that you had the support system to deal with them, if that’s what you chose to do.”
Just the
The door opened and revealed Cas, but he was no longer donning the confused expression. Instead, he looked resolved if a little weary. “Dean, Balthazar explained what that – “
He hadn’t really known what to do, but he patted Dean on the back until the tears stopped. He kept mumbling reassurances, that he was happy to have done it, that he was happy that Dean was okay, that they were like his kids, that he would do anything for them.
Gabriel’s fingers twitched but remained stuck in their death grip. “That is not true, Cassie. And you know that.”
He had expected to feel the loss of their presence severely today. Being with both of them, then watching both of them leave was something he had vehemently feared facing, the anxiety almost crippling in its ferocity. He recalled the bone-crushing fear he had felt when Meg had left after those first few visits, at the start of his program. How the loneliness had walked in and sat down next to him on his bed, all empty spaces and corrupted words. How it had whispered in his ear that this time, Meg would see him for who he truly was: a broken, disgusting shell of a person. How it had persuaded Castiel to believe that the weighted feeling of loneliness would intensify, would drag him down deeper into himself. How the chasm between him and the outside world would only ever continue to grow.
“And it better be good,” Gabriel called from the backseat, linking his hands behind his head as he leaned back.
in the same apartment - for another nine days.
Castiel had no recollection of giving his brain the instruction, but one second, he was sitting with his forehead leaning against Dean’s, and the next, he all but hauled Dean into his lap, and wound his hands through his hair.
“Yeah kid, let’s do this.”
“Cas?”
Dean’s first couple of days went down a lot better than he had originally anticipated.
“And then dad showed up…”
And these didn’t relent; Dean was treated to a torturous stream of memories, but as the late hours of the night bled into morning, these images became interspersed with things he really couldn’t afford to think about: the taste of Cas’ lips, the perfect scratch of Cas’ stubble against the sensitive skin of his inner thigh, the feel of Cas’ teeth digging into his shoulder while Cas moved inside him, the breathy desperate sound Cas made when he came.
And that was the crux of the issue: Dean was a heart-shattered sap while Cas was just so
Everyone was quiet for a while. Dean no longer felt angry, but he definitely needed more time to process what was happening. Cas dropped his arm again and just rested his hand on the small of Dean’s back.

Dean’s chest constricts.
Castiel waited with bated breath as Dean squirmed against him.
“Oh, Dean, I’m so sorry,” Castiel took Dean’s hand on his own. Dean reveled in the touch.
Hi All!
The thing is, Castiel had a rough couple of days.
felt. Castiel’s mouth crept into a slow smile, and he started lazily running his hands up and down Dean’s back.
Dean nodded as he bit the inside of his cheek. “I took Sam there.”
He enjoyed spending time with Dean. He felt alive when he was near him; wanted to know more about him, hear his stories, and discuss his beliefs. He enjoyed learning about him, unravelling the layers slowly, and gently wiping away at the perfectly cultivated façade. Castiel liked this man. This kind, strong, life-hardened and skeptical hurricane of a human being.
Hasn’t even come out to eat.
“Are you okay?” Stevie asked.
“Well, wonderful. So, no awkward introductions then,” she tugged at the sleeve of her
“Sleep,” Castiel whispered, “We can talk more later.”
“So, before you head to breakfast, I thought I would just let you know that our latest addition over there,” she said gesturing to the door, “will be your roommate for the remainder of your stay.”
Amara leaned back again, dropping her arms into her lap. “Have you ever been in an airplane Dean?”
“Yeah, I mean, he couldn’t hold down a job, you know? So, I stole, hustled pool, and worked side gigs. Uh, Bobby helped a lot as well; often leaving money or giving us somewhere to stay. But if we were there for too long, John would pitch a fit about how Bobby was trying to steal his kids or some shit. Bobby didn’t realize how bad it was, I didn’t tell him, and I had gotten good at hiding it. If he had known, I know he would have stepped in more. I know he still feels guilty about it. But he had just lost his wife and…” Dean broke off, unsure what to say next.
“What?” Dean barked. He could
Cas let out a startled yelp as the book disappeared from his elegant fingers.
When he walked out of the bathroom, Charlie was seated at the desk he had spent the whole weekend behind.
But, that didn’t make this easier. Not at all.
He remembered Cas always slipping his inhaler into his trench coat pocket before they went out. He remembered him taking it out of that pocket when they got home, either to his place or Dean’s. It was a routine.
Dean watched the interested eyes and was a little touched to see that all those eyes also held genuine concern, but he couldn’t talk to them. Not right now. He could barely force himself to eat right now, to think or breathe regularly.
“I’m going to… we’re going to get him back?”
“I’ll run around forever if I have to,” Dean shrugged.
Dean, whose eyes had been staring at a spot on the wall behind Castiel, dropped his eyes to look at him.
There was a very short silence, but Cas could feel Dean’s heartbeat speeding up.
“Right, let’s get you settled in then,” Charlie said, as she filed the papers away that Amara had given her.
“Dean, I really think, for your sake…” Castiel tried again.
“She is very nosy and exceptionally competent at finding ways to satiate that curiosity.”
The drive itself had been relatively uneventful, Dean had spent most of the time hovering in the semi-conscious state that existed in between sleep and awake. He had grumbled half-heartedly that he thought it a cruel and unusual punishment to be forced to be awake before the sun had even risen, as they left. Amara had steadfastly ignored him. The driver, however, had huffed a sound that had seemed a lot like agreement. No one had said another word the whole way there.
The hard cover was a deep emerald green with the words
Jody looked at the room, “Thank you, for listening.”
And Dean stared at them, smiling sometimes and crying at others. But one photo never left his hand. A photo of Cas in a cowboy hat, staring at the camera with a slight flush of embarrassment. It had been the first case they worked since Cas got out of the Empty the last time. Dean had been so unbelievably happy at having Cas back, he insisted on taking photos of the angel. He joked it off at the time, telling Cas that they needed more photos of him for fake IDs. But it hadn’t been that. It had been the fact that they had sat together in
“How did that even happen?”
“What did you mean earlier when you questioned whether Jack would want this? You looked pained when you said it,” Cas asked, sitting next to Dean.
Yeah, Dean
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice pierced through the haze, “Dean, are you alright?”
Bobby climbed into the driver’s seat and Cas slid into the backseat. Dean hesitated for a second and then followed Cas.
experiencing that. And don’t try to tell me that it was a one off thing. I saw in your eyes, the resignation, the way you steeled yourself… But not once had I experienced what, to you, was second nature to survive. My entire life, you protected me. You saved my life over and over. Man, you sacrifice everything for me. Don't you think I'd do the same for you? You're my big brother; there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.”
“I don’t understand,” Dean’s eyebrows drew together in clear confusion.
Castiel gently brushed his hand through Dean’s hair, “I do. I know that. We’ve got each other.”
Dean backed up into the room, as if Cas were stalking towards him with his fists raised and murder in his eyes. In actuality, Cas was frozen solid behind the threshold. Dean kept backing up until the back of his knees hit the couch in the living area. Cas heard a whispered, “fuck” as Dean slowly lowered himself onto the cushions. Dean palmed the lower half of his face, his eyes never leaving Cas’. Cas felt his heart crack.
But Cas wanted to say thank you, wanted to mend this rift between them, or at the very least, diffuse the unbelievable tense and awkward energy that seemed to filter into every single interaction.
“Yeah, couldn’t Amara be the new God?” Dean asked, “If she absorbs Chuck’s light that is in Jack right now, she wouldn’t be this destructive force, wouldn’t she? She’d be a balanced force.”
Knowing that didn’t mean it didn’t hurt when the person you loved tensed at the mere thought of your presence. As Cas moved carefully closer, he saw Dean was washing a pan he must have used to make himself breakfast. The sink was right next to the stove, so Cas internally settled on just grabbing cereal instead of trying to make anything.
“I got here first,” Dean countered.
There was a beat of silence before Cas heard Meg take in a startled breath. “Your Dean?” She hissed

by Taylor Swift.
There was a beat of silence, before a burst of fluttering wings echoed throughout the room.
“Anytime,” Dean responded, tightening his hold on Cas. They stood like that for a little while before Cas pulled away.
“I couldn’t make sense of it, Dean. I had died and come back. I had nowhere to sleep, to eat, and you told me to leave. You said…”
“Shut up, it’s the weekend,” he stalked out the door.
Eileen nodded. Cas guessed that Sam had voiced his concerns to Eileen before.
As far as awakenings go, this was one he could definitely get behind. He cracked open an eye, the lid still heavy with sleep and heard a very loud rumble emanating from his stomach. Dean was torn between warring instincts: to either stay right where he was, splayed out on his memory foam or to follow the heavenly scent of cooking bacon. The second rumble in his stomach was accompanied by a painful pang of hunger which seemed to be making up his mind for him. Dean closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, but this time there was another smell invading his senses. A smell that he knew belonged specifically to Cas. Dean bolted upright as the memories from the previous night flooded through him and a smile crawled slowly across his face. The smile froze halfway when he realized that he was
This has been a recurring thing over the past couple of days. He seemed to be subconsciously cataloging every detail about Dean whenever he found himself looking at him, which admittedly, was often. He tried to memorize arbitrary details, like the exact shade of green of his eyes, the color of the constellation of freckles that fanned across his face, the feel of his jaw in his palm when he cupped his cheek. Dean started calling him out on it, and this interaction was happening more and more frequently as the days dissolved into hours.
him had created a deep and raw desire within himself to connect to others, but with no knowledge of how to do so. He had no idea how to get from point A to point B. Sometimes, however, with Jody or Claire, he thought he might be able to reach out across that divide, and find a
Which, of course, he has.
He climbed into bed and switched off the lamp.
As if on cue, Dean walked through the front doors, and, as they usually did, Castiel’s eyes jumped to him, following his movement through the throng of people. He was obviously looking for Amara. When he glanced over to Castiel, he flashed him a shit-eating-grin and a wink before disappearing behind a set of doors.
Castiel chuckled, “Unfortunately, we don’t have time. After breakfast, it’s time for Jody’s life story, and I promised I would check on her before she had to speak.”
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean sighed. “I don’t care about the math. I care about the fact that I now have to share a tiny ass apartment with the guy.”
“Dean,” Castiel could hear the relief in his own voice. Dean looked up sharply, swallowed once and then a small half-smile that didn’t reach his eyes ghosted over his mouth.
“I don’t– Something in me just snapped that night. Seeing you like this, and then John and I– I’m sorry that I didn’t get rid of John when you asked. I’m just– Jesus, Sam, I’m so fucking sorry.” Dean planted his free elbow onto Sam’s bed and dropped his forehead into his palm.
“There is just one thing I need to finish before we do this,” Jack said softly.
“Yeah, but then Sam got hurt and Dean’s been at
Yup, Dean was absolutely going to die.
invaded all conscious thought.
If it hadn’t been for his weekly visits and occasional phone calls with Bobby and Cas, he was sure he would have just stormed out the front doors days ago. Making a decision and sticking to it when his old anxieties came knocking was far more difficult than Dean had anticipated.
“Fuck,” Dean jerked and dropped his forehead into the crevice where Cas’ neck met his shoulder before biting down on the juncture. Cas stopped breathing, his vision almost blacking out as another dribble of precome was pulled out of him. He was so hard it
Cas moved on top of Dean again, pinning him in place with his hips. He ghosted his lips over Dean’s chest and neck before breathily whispering in the hunter’s ear,
They had a couple of round table meetings and discussions, but everyone seemed pretty on board with the idea. Dean had a couple of one-on-one discussions with Meg too. The animosity of their youth was not something either of them had forgotten, but it was something they both wanted to move past. At first, it was only because they both knew how important the other was to Cas, but eventually, they realized they actually had a lot in common, and slowly, they started developing a hard-won but deeply valued friendship.
Castiel seemed to sense this, so he hung his arm around Dean’s shoulder and pulled him tight against his side.
Jody let out an explosive breath.
Meg was avoiding looking at him, and Castiel felt his throat tighten. Meg had been doing this often, saying things like that every time she had seen him since she found him on the bathroom floor.
when he joined his first game night
Dean flinched, despite himself and then quickly schooled his features into what he hoped resembled nonchalance, “That was in the past. I’m all good now, really. I mean, look at me, I’m the picture of health.”
Dean cracked up laughing again, “Just our luck though, right? History repeating itself and all that.” There was something expectant in the way Dean was looking at him.
“And earlier this evening? Before you ran out of here like I had suddenly sprouted black eyes.”
Dean closed the distance between them again, kissing Castiel gently, cradling his face. Castiel was the one to deepen it, to open his mouth, to lick at Dean’s lower lip. He relished the way Dean shuddered as his tongue slipped into his mouth. The hand that had been holding Castiel’s back, slipped down until it reached the hem of his shirt. Dean tugged it lightly, a question. Castiel nodded, and Dean pulled it up and over. The second his t-shirt hit the ground; Dean’s hands were on him. His hands dragged across his chest, stomach, back. Dean’s hands were calloused, and where the rough skin moved against him, Castiel erupted in goosebumps. It was so addictive, and it made him feel so alive. He was aware of every point of contact between them. He was
Dean exhaled explosively, “Cas, that’s quite a big deal. You haven’t seen them since, uhm, before, right?”
His only reprieve was mealtimes, he somehow always ended up next to Dean. And, although they hadn’t had much more time alone, he found his presence grounding. He enjoyed hearing his laugh. He enjoyed watching him interact with everyone else there, so comfortable in the presence of others, it seemed like he had been part of this group for months, not hours. Castiel found Dean Winchester to be endlessly fascinating.
“Something I didn’t like?” Dean barked out an angry laugh. “Fuck you, Cas. You knew exactly what you were saying.”
Next week, we will returning to a little more angst from Cas' POV. And, don't worry, Dean's time to deal with his shit is coming very soon.
To stay away from the non-existent future his sleep deprived, and very masochistic, brain kept conjuring.
Dean sighed as he read that message. He didn’t want Sam worrying about him. Not ever, really, but especially not now. The gesture, however,  was appreciated.
“So, if I were to, say, buy a cowboy hat and wear it at night…” Castiel purposefully let the sentence trail into the otherwise silent room. The atmosphere was tightening, the tension growing as he climbed on top of Dean, his knees bracketing Dean’s hips. Dean’s eyes widened as he drew in a sharp breath. Castiel watched his Adam’s apple with fascination as he swallowed heavily. Dean let out a shaky breath, “I can totally get behind you in a cowboy hat.”
“Uh, what? I still have no idea what you’re saying?” Dean said, eyes darting towards Sam who looked just as confused as he was.
As they progressed, as clothes were shed, and limbs were tangled, the feeling kept growing. Castiel was alive and he was burning with want. The flames fanned higher the more of Dean he was exposed to. He felt like he would vibrate out of his skin when he felt Dean hard against his thigh. He shuddered out a moan as he pressed his forehead into Dean’s chest, breathing deeply.
“Welcome home Castiel,” she said.
Dean was nodding before he even fully registered what Cas was saying. Cas trailed the hand that was already on Dean down over his shoulder, down his forearm and grabbed his hand gently. Dean took a tentative step towards the bed. And then another small step.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean whispered, “don’t say it like that.”
“Come,” she said, looping her arm through Castiel’s as she pulled them away from the lounge.
“As an aspiring writer, I will take the note,” Cas deadpanned.
“Well, they don’t know I’m back. But they did ask Meg to tell you that they wanted to see you.”
Meg Masters. Fuck.
Thank you so much to all of you who have read, left kudos and particularly commented on this fic. It's so encouraging and means the world to me.
Cas’ mouth dropped open, and Dean grimaced slightly. “You don’t have to look at me like that,” Dean grumbled.
“I’m here Dean. And I won’t leave you again. I’ll never leave you.  I swear it.” Cas’ voice filled the room, the sentiment making Dean feel as if his cobblestone heart was being cracked open.
As always, a great big thank you to Hellbreaker42 for the wonderful beta work and to aubrielle for advanced reading this.
Dean laughed as he grabbed a shirt, “Nah.”
“Not really,” he said with a sad, humorless chuckle. He looked back to Castiel who nodded with an encouraging smile, “but I will be.”
“I’m glad you’re here,” Castiel said gingerly. Dean scoffed.
“I guess you deserve to know,” Dean started.
Pompous ass.
I finished this a little earlier than I thought. Hence, the early update. But to stick to the schedule, I will post the next chapter on Sunday.
“And the second thing?” Dean asked as he pulled away.
Dean posted on social media frequently, and if he didn't, his friends would. Cas has been watching his life in pictures for the past five years. Has watched Dean grow into himself, watched the milestones and partners through the secondary lens of an outsider.
Dean tried to remember to take it slow, that Castiel was still relatively inexperienced, and had only one person on his list. Something white hot and electric pulsed down his arms at the thought of the other person, April, the reaper touching Castiel in this way, getting to taste the purity of his kiss.
They sat in deafening silence for a while, still too far away from each other in Dean’s opinion, both digging into the array of very unhealthy snack options that acted as a barrier between the two. Dean noticed that Castiel was avoiding touching him, even flinching away from the slightest of brushes of hands when they reached for the food. This sobered him even more. It never used to be like this (don’t think about it).
“Jack!” Sam called so enthusiastically that he started choking on the turkey bacon. He was out of his chair and wrapping the kid – or god now – in a bear hug, still slightly coughing. Sam clapped him on the back affectionately, and Jack looked up at him, an innocent sort of affection radiating from him.
Dean had to admit that this latest development between him and Cas definitely helped with his adjustment to
He started a pot of coffee and opened the fridge to check if all the groceries he had pre-ordered were there. Dean saw that their items were placed on separate shelves in the fridge, their names written on the unpacked paper bags.
Dean pulled Cas towards him. As he hugged him close, he realized he hadn’t intended to say those words for the first time now, not in the backseat of Bobby’s old beat up car. But the words were true and the certainty with which he felt them propelled the syllables forward and out of his mouth before he even had time to think about it.
Dean took a long, exaggerated breath while maintaining eye contact with Cas. Cas nodded weakly, coughed again but then mimicked Dean.
Dean said nothing. He couldn’t find words. His stomach recoiled violently. He started shaking.
As always, please check end notes for content and trigger warnings.
“About eleven weeks.”
A bell tolled in the visitors’ lounge, and Castiel sighed.
“Well, what do you have so far?” Dean asked, inelegantly popping two pieces of bacon into his mouth simultaneously.
Have a great week everyone! Stay safe :)
Thirdly, the next three chapters are going to be quite heavy, and some things may seem confusing, but, if I did my job right, it will all come together (aggressively hopes I did my job right.) This is the climax of the story and it will take three chapters for it all to be worked out. Please check trigger warnings in the end notes. And please remember that this story does have a happy ending :)
a very annoying British accent clad voice reached Dean’s ears.
“Well Dean insisted. The second he found out Jack had your body. And he never really left you alone once you were there,” Sam shrugged and headed for the kitchen door.
He schooled his features into what he hoped was a neutral expression as he lifted the bag and walked into the small living room. His heartbeat was far too fast and far too loud. The furiously pumping blood caused a high ringing sound to echo in his ears, caused a flash of vertigo that would no doubt leave an ache in the back of his skull.
“What was that?” Dean asked while lathering up shaving cream in his hands. Cas said nothing, just glared at Dean’s reflection in the mirror.
“Fuck, of course. I can start right now,” Dean eyed the recorder, trying to figure out how to get it to start working.
“Now I have to as well. Can’t be the only fucker sitting in a bed with morning breath.”
“I got John to drive, and I took Sam to the hospital. But it was a head wound, and he closed his eyes and I kept asking him to look at me. I kept asking, but he just didn’t open his eyes.”
Cas’ eyes prickled and burned. “It hurts seeing him. More than I anticipated it would.”
But before Cas could finish, Dean bolted out the door, sprinting down the halls -- no destination in mind.
He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do next.
That’s all that mattered.
But the idea of hearing that it was all a mistake, a result of crossed wires and shit – Dean just didn’t want to hear it. Last night was a kaleidoscope of confusing emotions, but there was no denying that it had felt
urges.
The adrenaline rush of the conversation and the kiss was slowly starting to recede, and exhaustion seeped into Dean’s consciousness. He yawned as he climbed off Cas and immediately missed the reassuring feeling of physically touching the angel. He pulled Cas up after him and threw his arms around him again and for a while the two stood still, just holding each other.
Meg dropped onto the seat of the couch Castiel had just vacated, lying down with her legs in Gabriel’s lap.
Thank you all so much for reading :) xx
“No Dean I am being dead serious, you’re scaring me, whenever you lose Cas you become reckless… suicidally reckless… and I can’t just sit…” Sam inhaled sharply. The sound caught Dean’s attention, and he focused his gaze on his brother’s face, which was pulling tight.
The way he’d just upped and left like they meant nothing, while Dean had been carrying a ring in his pocket for months. The way Dean had been so
“Dean, that sounds very hard,” Missouri said gently.
. I'd love to hear from you there or in the comments!
Dean’s memory gap was not a secret, but it was one of those topics that no one ever mentioned. At her words, all the quiet early morning conversation fell into silence and four pairs of rounded eyes stared back at him. Dean’s mouth dried out and swallowing suddenly became very difficult.
“Not hungry,” Dean shrugged.
Castiel wrapped his arms around her as she clung to him, her arms tight around his neck. Castiel pressed a kiss to the side of her head as the two broke apart.
“Shit, babe, are you okay?”
He tried and failed to not think about the ring box still shoved in the back of his underwear drawer back home. It was the most painful reminder of what could have been; the most excruciating symbol of how wrong Dean had been about them, and what they were to each other. But, in the end, it was still a reminder of Cas, of their relationship, how Dean felt, and so, he was never able to get rid of it.
Castiel looked at him, holding a very steady gaze before nodding once. Dean reluctantly dropped Castiel’s wrist.
“Your brother? You haven’t mentioned him before.”
it, but he didn’t feel like leaving Cas’ side even for the few minutes that it would take to gather the ingredients. He had hated leaving his side when Cas had been nothing but an empty vessel, but now that he was actually physically here, although admittedly unconscious, it seemed almost impossible to be separated from him. Like, if Dean walked outside, he would come back and see Cas dead again, his skin-tinged blue. Or worse, Cas would not be there at all. Dean knew Sam would would have a lot to say if he voiced the thoughts out loud so instead, he opted for a cheap cop out.
Their lunch had extended late into the afternoon. They only called for the check when dusk had started filtering its dusty orange hues through the window at The Roadhouse. Sam and Eileen were going to a graduation party at a friend’s house, and Bobby had offered to drop them off on his way home. Meg and Gabe were headed home. Cas thought they were headed there too, but Dean had a different plan. He tried to hide the tremor in his hand as he stuck the keys in the ignition.
Dean flicked his eyes towards Castiel who was obviously trying and failing not to look proud. They had made two pies in their session, enough for them, the other patients and the nurses. They had served it after dinner at the start of the movie night, and, so far, the response was overwhelmingly positive. Even Dean had to admit, after gobbling down two slices, that it tasted better than when he normally made it alone.
Gabriel let out a low whistle, and Castiel’s face burned as he guiltily looked away from where Dean had just been.
Sam has not woken up and was nowhere near consciousness yet, but he started showing some signs of early responsiveness. Only motor responses to physical sensations, like turning toward a sound, pulling away from something uncomfortable, or following movements with his eyes, but there were no responses to verbal commands as of yet. But it was real progress.
“No,” Cas shook his head, “Just twice. The rest of the time we slept in lodges. The accommodation was great actually.”
Dean continued to study him.
Thank you so much to all of you who read, left kudos and commented on my last chapter! You have no idea how much it means to me :)!
“Dean,” Cas said. And Dean looked up from his hands and watched Cas intently.
Dean smiled sheepishly as he slid under his blankets. Castiel tucked him in.
He had no idea what they would even say. What was there to talk about? They got caught up in a moment. It didn’t change anything.
“What?” Eileen asked,
saw very few new patients (in fact, no new patient has been admitted since Castiel arrived here six weeks ago), Castiel did not find it exciting in the slightest. He found it terrifying. He struggled with change and struggled even more with new people. The fact that this place focused on long-term inpatient care with no more than eight patients at a time, had been one of the main reasons he agreed to come when Meg shoved the pamphlets in his hands that night seven weeks ago: limited people and limited changes.
“Dean?” Sam asked,
“Dean,” he started, cupping Dean’s cheek gently, “you can talk to me. I’m here for you.”
“Dean, what happened?” Castiel asked softly, stroking Dean’s cheeks lightly with his thumbs.
“Open it,” Cas whispered.
morning club. He did not have to look long, however, before Dean caught sight of him sitting on a bench in the garden. His eyes were closed, and the just-barely-there morning light clung to his silhouette in a way that left him glowing, leaving him looking ethereal. Dean’s chest ached as he watched him. Cas had a rare, peaceful expression that Dean absolutely adored on his exquisite features.
Cas lowered his bag and turned around so that he could lock the door. While his back was turned, he closed his eyes and tried to inhale deeply. He tried, and failed, to ignore the eyes he knew were trained on his back.
“And?” Dean asked.
“So, that means we talk about it. And then we discuss it and work through it. There are various therapeutic methods we could try: trauma debriefing or CBT. But before we can do any of that, we need to talk about it. You need to talk about it.”
Dean could picture Sam’s imploring face perfectly.
“I’m not anxious,”
“So, kid, how was that?” Bobby asked.
room, with an
Cas was the one trying. He reached out. He kept trying to talk. Dean didn’t get to pretend he didn’t exist. He just didn’t. Dean could scream. He could yell. He could tell Cas to
“What did Claire say his name was, again?” Hannah asked, turning her eyes away from the van and on to Castiel.
“I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t stop him. I didn’t even know to look for him. I didn’t know he would... I didn’t know.”
Dean licked his lips, and Castiel’s eyes darted to follow the movement before they jumped guiltily back to Dean’s eyes.
“What’s that?”
Dean looked at Eileen’s grinning face and then looked his brother in the eye.
Yeah, no. These thoughts would not be conducive to a level-headed conversation. Cad did not think Dean would appreciate Cas confronting him while an erection was tenting his sweatpants.
After, when his vision broke into a constellation of colors, they lay next to each other, Dean’s head resting on his chest, and his arms holding Dean close. Castiel’s own heartbeat was still loud in his ears and he suddenly realised how undeniably that heartbeat now belonged to Dean. And, so, he thought, in tandem with the hammering of his pulse: yours, yours, yours.
“I think there is more to the story. His story. That’s all,” Sam concluded.
“Jesus, Dean! Fuck,” he heard Sam from somewhere behind him. But his vision was so dark now he could barely see his hand in front him.
“Sammy’s hurt,” the words scratched out of his throat. Dean clutched his chest which felt like it was splintering, cutting open everything inside him so that he was just bleeding, bleeding, bleeding.
“Yeah of course, man,” Dean said as he sat on the edge of the bed.
He walked past the cafeteria, not even bothering to look in. He wasn’t hungry. He just wanted to sleep. He wanted to forget the memories that he had scraped at today. The dark recollections he had buried and forgotten about were now flowing freely through his mind, a horror movie stuck on repeat that he couldn’t figure out how to switch off.
“It is obvious you care about Dean” Charlie started, and Cas tensed, but he heard no judgement, “and, although you're doing great, it is still upsetting to see someone we care about struggling. It is just to make sure you can share your concerns with her. If you would like to, of course.”
“Okay, I’m not fine,” Dean said, his tone seemed to be laced with confusion.
Cas couldn’t help the groan that tumbled from somewhere deep inside him.
Gabriel shrugged. “It makes sense to me.”
There were a multitude of conversations they have had more than once.
Castiel stood there, a little awkwardly, not sure if he was supposed to follow them. His eyes darted around the room, watching as Charlie greeted Gabriel animatedly.
The lady exhaled quickly, “Okay.”
Progress.
“No,” he spat out and stormed away, slamming the door to his room closed. The sound rang in Cas’ ears as he placed the creamer and the milk on the countertop. He rummaged in the drawers until he found a cloth. He dropped to his knees and started drying the floor.
And although Sam sometimes showed moments that seemed to glow lucidity, Dean was pretty sure that Sam had no idea what was going on around him, that he was completely incapable of sifting through the murky blend of reality and delusion that he had awoken to.
“I don’t understand,”
“For a long time, I was told it was the only conversation worth having,” Cas explained.
Castiel, however, interrupted him, “I don’t want you to tell me out of a sense of obligation. It is yours to talk about, whenever you are ready.”
Everyone chuckled at that.
But luckily, Dean did not have to wait that long.
Luckily (unluckily?) for him, Becky did not pick up on his disinterest and was content to continue talking as long as Castiel grunted,
“… this. I will agree to the shortest program we have. Eight weeks. And, if your memory is back to normal, if it comes back naturally and you’ve had a professional help you through this process, I will sign all the papers to discharge you, and I won’t bother you again.”
“I thought you would want to see him alone first, but perhaps … would you want me to come with you?” Cas asked as his thumb stroked across Dean’s skin.
“How long?” Cas asked.
“Dean’s favorite,” Cas smiled.
“Naturally, the kid’s not certain about metaphors but understands the psychological effects of cosmic entity torture techniques,” Dean muttered as he pulled his hand down his face.
Meg looked relieved, “I haven’t spoken to the guy in years. You can tell me all about who he is now.”
“Dean,” Cas said, blue eyes boring into green ones, “we need to talk.”
As he waited for visiting hours to start, he stared despondently at Dean’s bed, which remained completely untouched since yesterday. The sheets and comforter still twisted where they had kissed on them, Dean desperate and far away from Castiel’s reach. Dean hadn’t come back to the room - not to shower, not to get a fresh set of clothes. He hadn’t been in the cafeteria for breakfast or lunch, either. Cas noticed his absence acutely, the vacant seat next to his was almost loud in its emptiness.
“Dean, stop it,” Castiel demanded.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But Alex was a runaway for a reason. Her biological  family weren’t good people, and they didn’t like that they had lost her. Alex had been one of the main breadwinners in a family of eight. They didn’t care about her. They didn’t love her. They just wanted to use her,” Jody’s voice caught, “So one night, long after all the court dates and papers and all of that, someone broke into the house. I’m a Sheriff, so I grabbed my gun the second I heard the glass shattering. It was them, her family, and they had come to either get her back or get revenge. I called for backup, and when I went to leave my room, Alex was already standing outside my door. I yanked her in, told her to wait there. I found them destroying the lounge.” Jody’s face paled and she closed her eyes.
“Dean, firstly, I know from Missouri’s reports that you are doing well in therapy, particularly as it pertains to your father. So, I know you know that what happened to Sam wasn’t your fault. Your instinct is to take blame, and I understand that, but deep down, you know that it is not yours to take. So, don’t take it. Because that shifts the accountability away from the guilty party. Okay?”
“You saw that, huh?” Dean asked, flopping onto his back on the mattress.
He had not, in fact, been handling this entire trip very well. He hadn’t been prepared for how seeing Castiel, angel of the lord, as vulnerable, human Cas, would affect him.  Dean had long since given up trying to understand why this man seemed to get under his skin and seemed able to draw reactions that even Dean, himself, did not expect.
uncomfortable.
As always thank you so much to my wonderful beta Hellbreaker42 who always makes sure to check my work, no matter how busy he is. I appreciate you very much.
Sam made a sound that Dean knew meant he didn’t believe a word Dean was saying.
“It has nothing to do with you,” Dean hastily added, “I just really don’t remember, and when I think about it, I get this pit in my stomach, it's terrifying and cold. And yeah, so I don’t like thinking about it let alone talking about it.”
Dean almost swallowed his tongue when Cas was suddenly in front of him. His entire head started buzzing when he saw nothing but soft, tanned skin stretching over toned muscles.
for six weeks, it was rather unusual that he did not know his way to the nurse’s station. In his defense, he hasn’t been there in six weeks. Not since he was placed in the observation room, the rectangular room with glass walls, right next to the nurse’s station, at the start of his stay. All new patients were required to stay there, it was casually referred to as “the fish bowl” by all the patients, for their first forty eight hours here – under constant supervision by whichever nurses were on duty during that time.
“I liked Eileen,” Cas said as he slid into the passenger seat.
She told a story of a young girl in a small town who lived what she called “quite an average life”. She spoke about how she now knows that she has struggled with depression her whole life, but when she was younger, she didn’t understand what was happening to her. Did not have a name for what she was going through.
Hopefully, I did not screw it up too badly.
“Dean, I did…” Cas started, and Dean repressed the urge to close his eyes and drink in the sound of his gravelly voice. Dean interrupted him,
Dean jumped up from the bed and ran to the bathroom. He turned the cold water tap on and started splashing his face and neck, trying to calm his erratic breathing. He ignored the ache between his legs as he continually scrubbed over his face with the cold water.
Dean was exceptionally proud of Sam, deeply and truly excited for him, but every time he thought of his little brother leaving for Paolo Alto, his heart clenched painfully. It was taking all of his willpower to not pack up all his shit and follow Sam to California. With Cas in tow, obviously.
“Yeah, look, the man was flawed, obviously. And damaged. But I knew how to manage him, deal with him.”
” went on for a while. For far too long for the short message that followed:
He pulled Castiel into a quick hug and patted him twice on the back before pulling away and grabbing another Oreo.
“Don’t sound so surprised,” Eileen teased, walking up to Sam. Dean watched as his brother pulled her close to him, wrapping her in his arms.
Dean was still hugging Cas, had been hugging him for longer than was technically justifiable, but he seemed unable to pull his arms back. Moreover, Cas was not complaining. Cas, in fact, was holding him, his face pressed into Dean’s shoulder. And Dean wanted to melt into the moment, to tumble the two of them back onto the bed, draw Cas in and
“I need a shower,” Dean said, “Hey Cas, want to join?”
Dean pulled away immediately, as if he had been electrocuted, he tumbled off of Cas’ lap and fell onto the hard floor. He scrambled up looking wildly around.
Cas was surprised by every word leaving his mouth. He was even more surprised at how clear and calm he sounded. He was acting on auto-pilot, completely unable to think about his retorts before they were already spoken.
“Yes,” he grumbled in reply, his eyes furtively jumping to the translucent walls.
“We’ll meet you guys there,” Meg said. She pointed behind her, “My car’s that way.”
Dean took the phone from her, and with his hand still in Cas’, he started typing the familiar numbers. And when Bobby answered the phone, Dean felt like, had he not been sitting down, he would have collapsed.
“Stay here, Castiel. We will look after him.”
“Awesome, we have some here in the bunker…” Dean trailed off, eyes flitting back to Cas’ face. He knew he was being pathetic, he
He just wanted to make sure he was alright.
Cas was white as a sheet, all the blood seemingly gone from his cheeks and lips. There were droplets of sweat clinging to his hairline, trickling slowly down his face and he was dragging in deep, wheezing breaths.
“You can really do what you want. I don’t care. I would have liked some warning, maybe, before we did…” Dean couldn’t get himself to say the words. He abruptly stopped walking and dug the heels of his hands into his eyes.
“I did find Cas’ empty vessel in the outskirts."
“I really want to take you trick or treating,” Eileen called from across the table, winking at Jack. “Dress you up as an angel. Halo, harp, plastic wings the whole nine yards.”
Stevie had offered him a mild sedative, prescribed by Missouri, but he refused it. He didn’t want to be groggy when he spoke to Amara, and given that it was already light out, he was scared that it wouldn’t fully be out of his system by eleven.
“Yeah, man. Whatever you said to him never left him. Not for a minute.”
“Okay,” Dean said, “I washed my face with cold water; I’m more present now. How are you feeling?”
“We have quite a bit of free time here. We usually spend it in the day room. They don’t like us spending too much time in our bedrooms, but there are certain activities that happen daily,” Castiel explained. “So, for example, every day we have group sessions, but the times are different. And your schedule will tell you when you have individual therapy, which is either with Pamela or Missouri. And we have at least one group non-therapy activity a day. Like Wednesday is Yoga and Friday is art.”
Cas’ just stood there, looking at Dean intently and slightly cocking his head to the side.
“What?”
“Come Jack,” Eileen said, “Let me show you all the movies we bought for you. They’re in
“I know it may seem silly,” Cas interrupted.
Today was a good day. It was a great day, in fact. Meg, as promised, had taken him shopping and Gabriel tagged along, although he complained most of the time. They had tacos for lunch and had bought frozen yogurt right before they left; Gabriel’s piled high with candy, Meg’s plain and Castiel’s covered in honey. The sticky sweetness of it was still lingering in his mouth.
“I’m… apprehensive,” Castiel admitted, standing up.
“You’re the love of my life, man,” Dean said, handing it to him.
Castiel did not remember his dreams on that Saturday night. He just remembered
“I know I need to get better at using words, Cas, particularly now. And, particularly when everything is so new to you. And, me pouring my heart out to a stranger won’t clear anything up with us.”
which no one was good at, except Hannah, and luckily, she was on Dean and Cas’ team. When they won, Dean stuck his tongue out at Claire who rolled her eyes and then continued to sulk for the remainder of the evening.
“No, Jesus, Cas, it’s not that I don’t… I..I trust you okay? It has nothing…” Dean scrambled for words. Castiel turned his face away and seemed to be making himself as small as possible in the corner of the bed, bringing his legs to his chest and wrapping his arms around them as he glued his back tight against the headboard. Dean swallowed as bile rose in the back of his throat when he realized he had been the one to make him feel like this, his confidence shattered and questioning his role in Dean’s life. He had been the one to leave him vulnerable (don’t think about it).
Dean felt significantly better once he left Missouri’s office, which he admittedly did after hours instead of his allotted fifty minutes. She had calmed him, reassured him that his life outside these walls would not crumble in his absence. They went through his schedule, each activity explained and the benefits outlined, and although he would vehemently deny this out loud, he was grateful. He wasn’t sure what had happened in that missing week; that black shutter was firmly stuck in place--but he hadn’t been lying to Castiel when he spoke to him earlier. Every time he tries to think about that absence in his memory, whenever he looks too closely at that nothingness, a dread so overwhelming it blocks out everything else, fills all of his senses. Blinds him. Deafens him. Cuts off his oxygen. He didn’t want to think about it. He
“What?”
Dean had never felt this completely drained, not once in his entire fucking life. He felt hollow – completely scraped empty. He was exhausted, and the longer he walked, the heavier he felt, the louder the buzzing in his head became. Missouri had told him tonight was likely to be difficult, that she would be available if he needed her, he just had to tell Stevie to contact her.
“I am busy rebuilding heaven at the moment, restructuring it so that it’s no longer separate but interlinked,”
“And yeah, that’s when you woke up,” Sam concluded. Cas heard a catch in his voice, likely due to strain. Sam had been talking for a very long time. And although Cas had been paying very close attention to the story his eyes had, furtively but consistently, been jumping to the door leading into the kitchen. Dean had still not returned, and Cas did not like the idea of him being alone while being in the frenzied state he had left in.
The first thing Dean noticed when he opened his eyes again was that it was very bright. He blinked twice as the world came into view. He could barely remember the trip here, but he knew where he was:
“Yes but we don’t need a way to get in?” Dean asked, confused.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean leaned forward.
The news seemed to bleach a lot of the distress and unease out of Dean. When Charlie had shared the news, Dean instantly burst into tears, and Castiel held him while he cried. That night, he fell asleep, curled tightly into Castiel’s side. He seemed to be a lot better since then. He was sleeping and eating more regularly. He was able to be drawn back into conversations that weren’t hospital-centric. He even came back after his session with Missouri looking calmer than Castiel has seen him since before the night he remembered.
“Do you have Moana?” Jack asked, his eyes lighting up, “I really like Hay-Hay the chicken. He makes me laugh,”. Eileen smiled as she nodded. Jack jumped up, hugged his two dads, and then followed Eileen out.
agreeing to this? Dean’s vision darkened. He was vaguely aware that both Jody and Castiel were now staring at him, and he thought he heard someone's voice, but it was too muffled to decipher who it was or what they said because all he could hear was the pounding in his head.
. He would not be able to stumble his way through the phrase that usually fell so easily from his lips. The words that would never be true again unless there was an angel in a trench coat in his eyesight. So, he didn’t say anything. He just drove.
Dean reached up and softly ran the pad of his thumb just above Castiel’s left eyebrow. Dean’s finger left a warm trail in its wake, small flames licking at his skin. Castiel forgot how to breathe.
The first couple of days after Amara’s visit, Dean had been like a barely contained tornado; constantly in motion, constantly talking, either to Castiel, Bobby, Charlie or Amara. Oftentimes, Castiel would even find him talking to Jody at length about Alex’s recovery, the types of therapies she had done, exercises, and what the doctors recommended. Given that Sam and Alex’s injuries were vastly different, Castiel doubted that there would be much overlap in their recovery processes, but Dean always seemed calmer when he felt like he had something to do. So Castiel said nothing while Dean nodded along to whatever physical therapy method Jody explained, even taking notes and asking questions. Jody didn’t say anything either, just indulged all of his inquiries.
“Hey Cas, buddy, you gotta know… It’s nothing like that, okay?” Dean whispered, edging cautiously closer to Castiel. He tensed when Dean entered into his space, but he didn’t move. Dean took it as a win and didn’t stop until he was sitting cross legged right in front of Castiel. Dean reached out and circled the other man’s wrist with his own hand, running a thumb over his pulse point very slowly. Dean did not know where the instinct to soothe Castiel in this way came from. The sudden, urgent need to make him feel valued and important by physically touching him was as foreign as it was enticing.
“He’s asleep Dean, he probably won’t hear you,” Sam half shouted.
. Based on the notes and lore in the files, the Men of Letters had actually gotten information on the Empty but had just called it something else. Apparently back when the bunker was fully operational, when a certain wood nymph had been around, the Men of Letters multidimensional telescope had been able to see into the Empty. In fact, quite a few of the members back in the day had spent a lot of time studying
“You should talk to him,” Castiel said after the silence in the room stretched on.
Dean shot up in his bed, his face and chest drenched in sweat. His breathing was labored as the dream and his memories slid into place.
“Cas, you’re my best friend,” Sam said, smiling softly, “but you can’t leave him like that again. And I do appreciate that your sacrifice made it possible for us to win. I do, believe me. But Dean needs you in a fundamental way. More than he needs me, I think. And although that’s probably not healthy, after all the trauma he’s been through, I think it’s understandable.”
And then, suddenly, and very briefly, Dean’ eyes dropped from where they were boring into Cas’ eyes, down to his lips. His eyes were back on Cas’ so quickly that if Cas had blinked, he would have missed the abrupt flicker.
“He was in a very bad place. Amara, apparently, heard of him from an ex-colleague working in a hospital in Colorado. She went to see him.”
. I'd love to hear from you there or in the comments!
“Cas, buddy, you really got a talent in the kitchen, man,” Dean grinned as he opened the door. Cas was smiling shyly as he entered after Dean. And Dean meant it. Sure, Cas was completely useless with the spatula at the start, but that was because he had never learned and his fervor and desire to do things right made him a quick study.
“There is, actually,” Amara said. This fact eased the guilt that was curling around his lungs. She reached into her bag and pulled out a long silver rectangular box.
you. We came so close to losing each other and I just… I need you. I need you to stay with me and if you go off into the Empty without giving a fuck about getting back…” Sam exhaled and ran a hand over his face before pinching the bridge of his nose, “I can’t do this without my brother”.
“What, did you forget something?” Castiel asked quickly, taking stock of Dean’s appearance, noting that he seemed to have everything.
“I was concerned about Dean,” he admitted, pulling his arms tight around himself.
“Dean, that is a lot of pressure and pain for anyone to experience, let alone a child,” Missouri said.
“… but?” she had prompted softly.
Dean spent the entire day in his room, only leaving to get food, and when Cas, who was either sprawled out on the couch with his laptop perched on his lap or fumbling around in the kitchenette, tried to talk to Dean, Dean steadfastly ignored him. He just pretended Cas did not exist. He made sure to grab the easiest possible food options so that he wouldn’t be stuck in the kitchenette for longer than he absolutely had to be.
Shortly after their conversation earlier,  Stevie had come in to fetch Dean, to insist that he sleep in the
“I just uh… I did something while you were away. Two things. And one I hope wasn’t overstepping, and the second one I hope you don’t find cringey.”
It has never been like this with anyone else. With Benny, with Lisa… It just wasn’t the same. He cared about both, had even loved them in a way, but he was not
Sam nodded slowly.
“I mean it, Dean. You don’t have to carry things alone anymore. You don’t have to pretend you are okay when you aren’t. You can hurt without it making you weak. I can’t carry your burdens, nor can I take the wounds that you’ve had inflicted on you, but I can stand next to you. I’ve got you, Dean.”
“What about it?” Dean asked, his heart hammering in his throat.
But Cas was just so aloof, had stared at him indifferently, and had called seeing Dean '
“I hate that I kicked you out. I hate that this is the way it has to be right now,” Dean whispered.
“It’s not either. I mean, obviously they would have liked to have seen some kind of improvement in the past six weeks, but there has been none. But he hasn’t gotten worse yet, and that is a good sign. I’ll be honest with you, in most cases, coma patients wake up after two to three weeks, but there have been cases where people wake up years later.”
In the past three weeks, both Adam and Hannah were discharged. Both instances had been very emotional.
“I’ll go to the vending machine,” Castiel said, standing up and reaching for his wallet.
Dean was planning on staying in Sam’s room with him for the foreseeable future.
“Gabriel…” Castiel tried but his brother held out a hand.
“Fuck!” he swore aloud and banged the hand that he'd been holding himself with, heavily against the tiles. He opened his eyes and ignored the thin trickles of water that dripped from his eyelashes. He was so pent up, so on
type of distraction. He reached for his phone. He had barely unlocked it before he heard
“No... I,” Dean cleared his throat, “No, I never let him near Sammy. Not when he was like that.”
He needed to calm down.
“This is an actual plan, this is something that could work,” Sam said, eyes glowing. Cas darted his eyes to Dean who seemed to be thinking something over.
Thank you all so very much for reading! Please let me know what you thought in the comments.
Dean was pretty sure he would have collapsed onto the floor if Cas wasn’t grounding him. He still did end up swaying unsteadily. Cas reached behind himself and pulled the visitors chair closer, right next to Sam’s unresponsive face. Cas gently pushed Dean’s shoulder down, and Dean followed the movement, dropping heavily onto the uncomfortable seat. His eyes never left Sam, but he squeezed Cas’ hand in thanks. Cas placed his other hand at the nape of Dean’s neck, gently carding through his hair.
He heard Castiel let out a frustrated sigh, and suddenly, he felt the pressure of a warm arm snaking around his waist, pulling him even closer to the tower of body heat that stood next to him and guided him with only a slightly rough insistence into the room. Dean resisted the urge to inhale deeply.
By the time Cas finished showering, Dean was gone. Well, not
He felt excited. He felt joy.
“Uhm, I –“ Cas swallowed, “I made dinner. For both of us. You haven’t eaten today, and I wanted to say thank you for helping me earlier, and uhm – it’s not gourmet or anything, and I’m sure the pasta is undercooked or overcooked.”
Anyway, have an awesome week! And, as always, thank you for reading.
– Dean’s hand tightened around the plastic. He moved back to Cas, sat down next to him and held out both hands: one with a cup of coffee, one with his inhaler.
“I’m ready now,” Dean told him softly, Castiel nodded.
He led Dean to the  food station line as he replied, “I’m Castiel Novak. I’m a Gemini. I like reading and watching bees. And…”
“Nothing bad, don’t look so spooked.”
Dean looked over at Cas, whose gaze had returned to his sleeve.
“What’s with the wheelchair?” he looked at the name sewn into the other man’s uniform, “Marve?”
“Are you telling me that none of those were inflicted by John Winchester?”
He thought of the way his eyes lit up when he laughed, his hesitant and curious touches. He thought of his strength, his kindness. He thought of the the way he had read to Dean, the timbre of his voice as the syllables cascaded from those perfect, pale lips.
Castiel knew Dean did not believe he was good with words. Castiel also knew, however, that there was nothing he could have said in that moment that would have made him happier than those
“Thank you, Stevie.”
If you want to come say hi or share your thoughts about the story, you can find me on tumblr
“Jack?” Sam asked quietly from across the room, as his arm visibly tightened around Eileen.
“Has that changed?”
Cas hurried to his own room, not wanting Dean to come out and chastise him for only being in a towel again. But there was a reason he’d risked the nudity instead of just walking to the shower in his sleep clothes.
Stretched out. Open. Splayed out.
“Dean?” She asked, black nails tapping out a steady rhythm on the reception desk of the nurse’s station.
He jumped off the bed, silently walked to his door and placed his ear against it. He listened as Cas made coffee and poured cereal. He stood with his ear pressed to a fucking wall like he was in some Disney Channel Original sitcom. He waited until he heard nothing coming from the common area before gingerly opening his own door.
Dean’s expression turned unreadable, but he studied Cas and didn’t break eye-contact. “No, but we can call Billie.”
“Dean you need to slow your breathing, you’re hyperventilating. I know it feels like you can’t breathe, but you can. You’re getting too much oxygen in.” Sam’s voice finally pierced through the fog in his brain. He held on to the familiar sound and followed his brother’s instructions. Slowly his breathing returned to normal as the panicked feeling bled out, leaving Dean feeling weak and shaky.
“You do?” Dean asked as he walked over to the Nephilim boy, “with all of us?”
fucking liked it. All of it.
The thoughts tried to infiltrate the burning river currently encompassing Dean’s mind. But Dean didn’t care. He just didn’t.
“No. I didn’t. I did not do this on purpose. I did not try to upset you. I was trying to be civil and discuss your brother,” Cas tried to even out his breathing, tried to sound calm and neutral even though it felt like every muscle in his body was vibrating.
“Yes,” Eileen nodded, “Jack would siphon Cas’ grace from your soul. And then we can put it into an amulet or something that would then lead us to him”.
Because that was not the way he felt about him. He hadn’t said it because saying he loved Cas the same way he loved Sam would have been a lie, a blasphemous twist on the feelings Dean kept tucked away into the most scarred and sacred corner of his heart. He loved him deeply, truly. He loved him like…
“You need food,” Cas said, a little out of breath.
what happened.”
Castiel, hand halfway extended to Meg’s, froze. The mention of his parents made his blood run cold and his skin feel like it was being electrocuted.
“I may not be a cowboy,” Castiel said as he traced patterns on Dean’s clothed chest with his fingers, “but I’m your
life.
Dean cracked his door open. Cas was on his knees, with his back to Dean, in front of the couch which had been shoved so that it was angled in a different direction than it was before. He was digging in between the couch cushions. The apartment was a mess-- throw pillows on the floor, carpet rucked up, some of the kitchen drawers standing open.
Dean, for a while there, was pretty prone to panic attacks.
Castiel ran his hand through Dean’s hair for a few seconds before replying, “That is the end goal, of course, but until you get there, it’s okay if the only reason you’re alive and safe is for someone else.”
“Castiel Novak, will you marry me?” Dean repeated the words that Cas had just read. He held the silver band in his palm, which was outstretched towards Cas. “Please say we can do this, you and me, for the rest of our lives. Please marry me.”
Just too much.
“Cas how could you do that to me? How dare you do that? How did you think… how could you think...? You were gone…” Dean’s voice was increasing in volume as his speech started decreasing in coherence.
Dean was distractible and very anxious those first couple of days. Castiel tried to be there for him as much as possible. Letting Dean talk, letting him be quiet, just being around so that he knew he wasn’t alone. He even read to Dean for three consecutive nights, but, although Dean would slip under the comfortable blanket of unconsciousness easily enough, Castiel often awoke in the middle of the night to find Dean pacing the room or scratching away on blank pages at the little desk.
“Cas?” Dean dropped to his knees at the side of the bed, placing his hand on Cas’ forehead, reveling in the warm, very much alive, feel of the skin under his palm and counting each of the angel’s breaths.
Dean watched him curiously at first but eventually joined in the cleaning. Cas tried not to think too much about the fact that they were actually doing something together without arguing. Cas really tried not to think about how happy this made him.
Castiel tried not to let anything show on his face. He knew it had something to do with Sam. Dean had said this.
The brothers were in Dean’s room. Dean on his couch, staring at Cas’ lifeless body and Sam standing in the doorway.
“But, I want you to know that I also meant that my happiness wasn’t in the having. I am very happy Dean, elated, overjoyed to just be in your life. To be a friend to you. To get to learn from you. I do not want you to think that this has to change us. I don’t need…” Cas continued.
“You don’t get to ignore me. I’m sorry I said something you didn’t like, but – “
“Yes, Dean,” Cas said so softly, Dean thought he was imagining it.
“That’s how I feel every day I’m with you,” Dean said smiling. Castiel’s heart clenched at the earnestness in his tone. “But this is not about me. What you’re feeling is valid. Of course, it makes sense that right now would be confusing and scary. Fuck, if I were you, I’d be terrified. But Cas, buddy, you have to know that you are strong enough to do this. You are the strongest person I know. You have survived more than you should have had to, but you came out on the other side. You are loved and have people that will always look out for you. You won’t have to do it alone this time. This is going to be so good for you. Life is going to be so good to you. Because you deserve it and because I will physically fight anyone or anything that tries to take it away from you.”
“No Dean!’” Cas almost growled and this time he leaned forward and kissed him gently. A brush of lips, a moment of shared air. When Cas drew away, Dean almost whined. Although he would never say that out loud.
“Yeah, alright. Perhaps, with some sleep, this might not be so overwhelming,” Cas conceded.
And then after that, it just seemed like his brain got a kick out of keeping him awake at night, replaying all of his failures, his mistakes. On days when his mind was being particularly cruel, it would create intricate storylines of the lives they would have had.
He knew Dean was angry. He knew he had a right to be. His opinion on Cas was a direct result of a decision Cas had made.
He opened the first image. And then the next. And the next.
“I know, Cas. I know what he meant - means - to you,” Meg said gently.
She just shrugged and leaned back into the chair. “Okay. So, I am here to answer questions, any and all questions you have, now that we are all on the same page,” she gestured to Dean. “So, ask away.”
He remained staring at the floor.
Very few people outside of Bobby and Sam knew how badly the breakup had fucked Dean up. The only other person was Charlie. Of course, Sam would be worried, Dean would be too if the situation was reversed.
Was his voice always that high?
He wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do. Something was definitely
Dean was suddenly concerned about his thermoregulation. It was getting really fucking warm in here.
Sam sighed. “Later, jerk.”
Dean thought as white hot frustration simmered within him. Dean lowered his hand again, closed his eyes and thought of the picture Lisa had sent him yesterday. He pictured her long, smooth legs, the curves of her calves, her thighs, how the lacy panties had clung to her form.
“A friend of mine, Benny. Just after high school, we had a bit of a friends with benefits thing going on for a while. But he grew up in a very, uh, traditional home. He sometimes struggled with it, so we never progressed further than that, but I realized that it worked better when he initiated the contact.”
Dean dipped his hands under the hem of Castiel’s shirt, his palms resting on his lower back. He looked at Castiel, eyes wide and swallowed once before he nodded. Castiel slid his hand away, running his index finger along Dean’s top lip before he moved his hand to the back of his neck.
“Don’t look at me like that, Cas. I promise it’s way worse than it looks.” Dean was itching to change the direction of the conversation.
“I’m tired,” he admitted, and Dean noticed that he definitely
Cas had moved his arms and were trailing them down Dean’s chest, agonizingly slowly.
“ I just don’t know how you would feel about this,” Dean offered.
Dean got the impression that the other man was exceptionally uncomfortable.
with it. Dean was spiraling, falling apart, literally ripping his own sanity to shreds while Cas was just standing there, all impassive and detached. Dean didn’t affect him in the same way.
“Well, just saying, you could work on them a little.” Eileen smiled into Sam’s arm for some reason Dean could not explain.
