The paper was a denunciation: I had been correct in surmising that. My certainty had been growing from the moment he took us aside: indeed, I had expected something of the sort after our gaffe at the opera. I would have taken the sheet, but Watson placed a hand over it, and looked the Inspector full in the face.
‘You say your son plays cards with Colonel Sebastian Moran? Can you tell me, Sir, how long he has known the Colonel, and whether his requests for money date from their acquaintance? I knew him in India you see: he was a gambler then, and many an unwary subaltern have I rescued from his clutches. He does not – play fair,’ Watson added, quietly. ‘I am not surprised your son has been in difficulties and asking you for money.’
Watson was successfully inveigled away from his work – and from the Criminal Law Amendment Bill. Parliament was to be prorogued on the tenth of August, and the discussions and changes, not just to that Bill, but to the other business of the house were furiously debated and as furiously reported on. Watson had already lost the tranquillity he had found during our weeks in Sussex, and I was not sorry for an excuse to take him away. He was unwilling to let me go to Vienna alone, so it did not take very much persuasion. There was nothing he could do in any case, for he had no parliamentary influence, and all his work – in writing letters, observing and documenting cases and providing information for people such as Stead and Mrs Butler had been done. It was the wait for his poor children that was wearing him out, and the uncertainty over what might become of them.

‘Cartwright!’
‘J – Watson! He is the world’s darling, and ever has been. You must not despise him: rumour has it that he is to be ennobled quite soon. A favourite of the Queen! Well then, Waterhouse’s Saint Eulalia. The composition is striking, you must agree.’
The colour had gone from her cheek, poor woman: a mother's heart taught her that here was danger for her nurseling, but she curtsied to me, straight-backed - she, who never curtsied -  and turned to go. 'Certainly, Mr Holmes, Sir. May I just mention, Sir, that as you bade me, I sent a boy round to Inspector Lestrade not five minutes ago - I was about to inform you of that fact when these gentlemen' - oh the scorn in that word - 'arrived. He will be here directly upon the summons, Sir, I am sure.'
Despite the precaution of remaining wrapped in blankets on deck, I was in sorry case by the time dawn came and my ponderous transport sidled up to Parkeston Quay to disgorge her weight of humanity. It was all I could do to hobble off the gangplank and retrieve my valise, for my head felt disagreeably heavy and my ankle was throbbing. I stood on the Quay in the windy morning, cold and in pain, and gathering my strength for the next step.
'Could you sleep here in my arms? Or will it be - too difficult? I - I can lie with you chastely still, Holmes. I want you, but I can and will subdue it.’
His eyes met mine. I cursed my stupidity for not looking where I had flung the device. It must have rolled out of my door, to some shadowed corner where he had found it.
‘I think he hates me, and would willingly bring me to destruction. If he offers anything he will poison it - I am under no illusions about that. And Professor Moriarty hates you, Holmes. To imply that you – that you were less than I! My God, I could have murdered him for his insults! The Uranian muse! Fingering! Heavenly bodies! Ganymede! I would have stuffed his words back down his filthy throat, had you not recalled me to myself. Damn him! Damn him!’ He looked at me. ‘Those words, those insults to you! And you do not in the least realise what he blackguarded you with, do you, Holmes?’
'Dr Watson, you know I cannot tell you that. I am just . . .'
‘And if we replace religion with the Darwinian model, it seems to lead to a grim end,’ he observed. ‘All nature striving for survival, at the expense of others. Red in tooth and claw. What of goodness then, Holmes? What reason can there be for selflessness, if it brings no advantage to the individual who practises it?’ What moral code can a man follow without a deity?’
‘It’s a strange thing, Mr Holmes,’ he began, ‘that whereas I would normally come to you off my own bat, so to speak, in this instance, I have been directed to involve you in an investigation. And I cannot for the life of me tell exactly whence that direction arises, and why. Or rather, I know why – it is the prettiest little problem in some ways, and just the sort of thing for you – but I do not like to be a mere messenger, see and not to know who is properly in the driving seat. It does not suit me at all, to tell you the truth.’
‘Now you are laughing at me!’
'Holmes, without work, you will be insane within months. You are not cut out for idleness. Or luxury such as this,' he added, returning box and ring. 'Your ways, other than your fondness for concerts, can best be described as homely, and you dress quite plainly: these items are too much of a contrast to your usual simplicity. I cannot imagine you wearing them, certainly, so you might as well realise their value. But retirement! I am too poor yet to retire. And what would you do with yourself, alone in some bucolic idyll?'
'As you know, for some years, now, I have been working with Mrs Josephine Butler, first of all to see the Criminal Law Amendment bill through - with what result you know: we obtained relief and recourse to law for those children dragged early into prostitution, but - ' he swallowed hard, ' - well, you know, Holmes.'
He raised as woebegone a pair of blue eyes as ever I saw to Holmes. ‘Sir, can you help me? Please help me. I cannot let this go. I cannot lose him: he is the very dearest thing on earth to me, the friend of my soul - never were two men closer than we are. I cannot bear to be parted from him an instant longer. And the thought that one so beloved might be in distress- in want, in pain, in fear, under duress or incarceration? I cannot bear it! Help me, Mr Holmes, I beg of you! Tell me what I must do to be reunited with him!’
If I had known little of Cornwall before, I was soon to know much more than I wanted. The man was a bugger: that much was soon clear. Which is to say that he had regularly engaged in in the past, and habitually did engage in
I knew what he meant. I had seen how all the time he was in our rooms his eye had roved, seeking for evidence - as if there was evidence to be had from the mute curtains, the blind carpets - of the crime of which, since Wisteria Lodge, he had suspected us. I had seen how his gaze lingered on the  small incense burner, the vase of flowers - Watson loved flowers in our room - the blue afghan folded over the arm of the wide, comfortable sofa, the stack of books by it - we had been reading the ghazals of Hafiz together - and there was other poetry there besides, including my copy of the Symposium, which Watson had asked me to read to him, for, he said, the pleasure of hearing me speak Greek. All the evidence, in short, of domesticity, and all, from the slight sneer with which Gregson regarded it, repellent to him.
'It took you more than two hours to walk from Barts to Baker Street?' The Inspector's gaze had sharpened.

‘Well I would not like it. I am not interested in diplomacy. Nor am I interested in the periodicals – you may use them to light the fire if you do not wish to read them – and I am sick of being stuffed with beef tea and fowl. But music – if he has sent concert tickets, I would like to see what they are. I have not heard good music for two months, and I miss it sorely.’
‘Come, friend Watson, the curtain rings up for the last act. You will be relieved to hear that there will be no war, that the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope will suffer no setback in his brilliant career, that the indiscreet Sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion, that the Prime Minister will have no European complication to deal with, and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident.’
‘Oh, I took a little cocaine as usual this morning, to inspire my mind and clarify the thought processes, and then immediately began my work. I became engrossed in it, I suppose. It is of no matter: I had not to go out today, and there is no case to occupy my mind. Mrs Hudson has not been up here, or if she has I have not given it any mind. I am quite decent enough, Watson, for a man at his work in his own home.’
‘And you believe him?’ Lestrade turned to Watson as if he were the beacon of sanity in a storm.
‘But abroad?’
She looked at me, and again I was forcibly reminded of my first nanny.
‘The poor man is short-sighted in the extreme, and so must squint, even with glasses; I am sure it is myopia you observe, not malice. And I made it clear to him at the outset that Moran and I have nothing to say to one another, since which time  - for I have met him at Thompson’s several times: they are by way of being friends - he has not mentioned the Colonel again. Come, Holmes, own that your prejudice is unreasonable, my dear, good fellow. I only attend a lecture at the lecturer’s invitation: what harm can there be?’
*****
‘I have in my gift – I am able to obtain for you, brother, if you so desire it, a chair at one of the Universities: the choice would be yours, either Cambridge, or Oxford. A chair of Science, newly endowed by a – generous benefactor. You would thus be away from London, and the scrutiny of the censorious. In one of the university towns, particularly in Oxford, you might be as bohemian as you please, and occasion less remark. I – I could even arrange, if you so desired it, for Dr Watson to be offered a position – a well paid position – at one of the hospitals there. You might – if he is, as I suspect him to be – beloved by you, you might still be together. Still share rooms, and be more secure in them than you can be here.’
*****
‘I will. I do.’ I breathed out, thinking. If this was the end of all my hopes. He had said it: he was no Moran who took both men and women. But perhaps I could dare – ‘I trust you in all things, John. You are, as you have said, no Moran.’
We walked on for a while in silence, until we came to Johnson’s door.
A brief examination with my microscope – Watson and Mrs Hudson looking on the while – proved to me what I had suspected. ‘These are not paste. See, Watson, observe the clarity of this stone. These are diamond chips in here, and there is a remarkably fine sapphire in that ring. The gold of this locket is pure: these must have been stolen, and I believe I know whence they came. You remember, I am sure, the affair of the beryl coronet, when we were apprised of Worth’s involvement in this consortium of crime, and of Milverton’s? When first we knew of their collaboration?  And do you recall the young man Lestrade told us about afterwards, who blew his brains out, who was in debt to Moran, and blackmailed by Milverton? He had been a guest at a house – his aunt’s house, I believe it was, where there was a burglary after, and some jewels taken? I am much mistaken if these are not some of the very same jewels – which means they have certainly been through Worth’s hands, and the affair arranged by Moran. And the Professor, as always, remains in the background.’
‘The judge in Durham’s case has delivered his verdict,’ Watson remarked to me a fortnight later. ‘And has dealt sternly with both Mrs Gerard as instigator of the ill-fated marriage, and with Durham himself, I see. And the husband does not get his annulment.’
*****
‘If I was, I did not know it,’ I told him. ‘I was always a solitary child.’ I did not tell him of Mycroft, or of my parents. ‘Perhaps I did not wish to know it. I used to look at the other fellows from afar, wondering what lack it was in me that made me so apart, but I could never bring myself to join them, and they appeared to accept my isolation. A self-imposed isolation, I see that now. Perhaps they would have been friendly enough, had I been more forthcoming.’
‘But did you never see your family? You break my heart.’ His arms tightened about me, and his cheek pressed my hair. ‘Oh my dear, my dear. At least my mother loved me. But you never knew yours.’
‘I am sorry,’ he halted under a lamp, and examined my face, took my pulse. ‘Yes, I should not have bustled you along like that and you barely out of your bedchamber. Forgive me my dear – it is only – I wanted to say to you – oh Holmes, Holmes -  the aria - those words!’
‘I own your impeachment,’ he replied, smiling at me. His eyes were very blue this morning. He had slathered – there was no other word for it – honey on his breakfast toast, and a golden drop still kissed the left-hand corner of his lip. ‘I have learned my lesson, Holmes, I assure you, and am duly penitent. Hand over your page then, and I will let you have mine. Do you choose to go out this evening, my dear chap? There is Iolanthe, at the Savoy, which we have been too busy to see. I know it is not entirely to your taste, but Sullivan’s music is very fine. I confess I am in the mood for some light entertainment. Here, take your sheet. And tell me how your bee studies go on: I have not heard you mention them for a few days now.'
‘I will return to you unharmed, I promise. Embrace me, my dear Watson, and wish me well. I may have need of all the world’s luck to retrieve those three gems and the banker’s honour with them. Oh – and before we go our separate ways?’
‘It is wrong, and you know it is wrong.’
Watson had obtained introductions to several of the doctors there, to von Brucke, Breuer and Meynert: he came home on the evening of our arrival in a state of some stupefaction that he had been introduced to Freud, whose ‘Uber Coca’ had just been re-issued. He had, he said, discussed his own cocaine idiosyncrasy with the doctor, whom he found an agreeable man, if a little stiff in his manner, and been assured that such reactions as his were uncommon, and that the drug was safe for general use. I was glad to hear it for it proved to me that there was no risk in the five per-cent dose I now took regularly.

‘Watson, you go from strength to strength. You translate perfectly. But why do you find it distressing? Dumas is a great writer: see how he builds and builds the tension to the denouement. It is exquisite, beautiful, as when one hears the violin soar and soar until the climax. Do not be distressed: it is only a book, my dear fellow!’
My eyes filled. I set my violin aside, and went to kneel by the sofa. ‘If I have anything to say to it, we will not keep bachelor’s hall alone but be together as long as you wish it,’ I told him softly, taking his hand. ‘I have no friend as good and true as you, and I want no other – John.’
Holmes went under the alias of Sigerson during his time in Tibet. He was also believed to have been in India, where he took part in 'The Great Game', the intricate, dangerous duel of spying that took place along the Afghan border, where Russia was testing the borders of British India. Mycroft, of course, was deeply involved in this.
Scientific discoveries or publications of books reported by Holmes in this work are placeholders for the dates of events.
‘He cannot be more singular than you, my dear. In my eyes, there is no-one with whom you compare.’
‘Well, my Damon,’ he returned, and I thrilled that he recognised the quotation from the play we had recently read, ‘you are my
'You should be grateful to your fiancée also,' I told him, partly to deflect his too effusive praise of me. 'She grasped her rôle in the performance immediately, understood the importance of my instructions and obeyed them to the letter. Had she been a different sort of woman, all might have miscarried, but she is a strong, resolute and faithful character, and will be a wife to be proud of. Had it not been her brother who was the villain, I might have taken her even further into my confidence, but although I had no doubts as to her entire integrity, it would have been too much to ask her actively to participate in the apprehension of her brother: I would not so wound her feelings for the world - although I am afraid when all this does come out they will be sadly wrung. Will you go to her and enlighten her now, Mr Phelps? She will not even be aware, poor girl, that her brother has left the house for good, let alone under what painful circumstances. Watson might go with you, I think, if you would be so good, my dear fellow? And would you entrust me once more with the treaty? I will ask no fee from you for my services, but I confess, I should like to restore it to your uncle myself.'
I sat down opposite to him. It was not a man’s part to ask him where he had been, but it was all I could compass not to do it. And he offered no explanation for his day, but simply sat in sad reverie, until we parted. He did not even ask me to play for him.
‘Monte Cristo has seen the increasing despair of Maximilian after Valentine’s death. Maximilian avoids the Count, because he promised to save Valentine, but did not. Failing to make the lad listen to him, the Count follows him home and breaks into his room, arriving just in time to stop him blowing his brains out.’
‘I do not like him: I do not know why.’
‘Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this letter?’
‘No? The passage I quoted goes on a little further, you know.’ He raised his voice a little, declaiming. ‘ “
He let out a crack of laughter. ‘I can keep nothing from you, Holmes. Yes, of course it is in German: now tell me by what deductive process you have concluded that. Is it that you are ahead of me in my search and have found an alternative source of information, or that you are employing some mysterious process of divination? I hoped to surprise you, but I see I cannot.’
‘They are very different. Brahms – there is something, perhaps a new type of music, new ideas, new ways of tonality and structure. I do not find it as congenial as Wagner: it does not sweep me away or thrill me to the core with emotion. But it is not therefore without value, nor does it always follow that to be a lover of one is to be a hater of the other. Watson, may I ask – are you – are you well, my dear fellow?’
He beamed at me, bright and warm. ‘It is a singular honour to be your friend, Holmes, and even more so to be your only friend. I could ask for nothing more, you know, than to be your companion and associate. And our friendship is on quite a different footing, of course, from my acquaintance with these men. With them, it is that I believe we share a common cause, so I will associate myself with them in a friendly way, as is right, and as I do with my colleagues at work.’
‘I have already asked Mrs Hudson to send some up. I cannot sit down unless you cover the chair: blood and velvet do not go together.’
‘It is indeed well-named with the word dynamite,’ said my companion, clutching my sleeve in excitement. ‘Holmes, its power is very great: is it not a pity that we cannot experiment again with a larger amount of the stuff? I should so much like to do so, should not you?’
Melas, I found pleasant enough, a gentleman, it was clear, and a gentle man, although neither as young nor as wholly Adonis-like – he had a regrettable tendency to embonpoint, and would, I thought, have to take care in middle life lest he grow positively stout – as I had expected. He was a Greek of the Greeks, with an admirably straight profile, a fine head of crisp-curling black hair and eyes large, dark and languorous. He stood somewhat in awe of my brother, which was not surprising, given their respective characters.
‘It was,’ he agreed, possessing himself of my hand, and holding it in a comforting clasp, ‘but I do not think it was only a ballad about a forlorn hope and a fruitless love that has you looking so sad. Well, if you will not tell me, you will not.’ He paused. ‘Was it - I was only being courteous, you know, and indeed, indeed I could not avoid the conversation with those females without being churlish: it was in a degree forced on me. It is only you I love, Sherlock. Do not be afraid: you alone hold my heart.’
‘This is very kind of you, Mr Holmes, very kind indeed.’ Professor Moriarty came forward, holding out a hand which when I shook it, reminded me disagreeably of a day-old corpse’s. Watson, I am convinced, also shuddered at his salutation, although he passed it off with a stifled sneeze, his cold increasing sadly upon him. ‘And Dr Watson: how delightful to see you again. Are you enjoying the concert? The young composer is a very dear protégé of mine: I am intrigued to know what you think of his work. The violinist also is quite a favourite. His fingering – ah, it is masterful - quite masterful, and I assure you his  - vibrato -  is exquisite. He is a singer, too: I have found none with greater oral expertise. I would be interested to know your opinion, Mr Holmes, as an – expert - in  - fingering - yourself.’ He turned, and poured wine into two glasses.
‘I – I cannot say it as you do, John. The words do not come easily to me, as they do to you. But – but – you are everything to me. Everything. I do – oh, I do love you. To be with you, to know our dear, familiar intercourse every day, to have your arms around me, to recline upon your breast, to have your hand caress my hair – I have never known such happiness. I wish . . .’
'Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it.' I smiled at him. 'Or should I say it would prevent you, my dear fellow, from so doing - did you but possess either cunning or shrewdness. Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is more probable, the very volume to which these figures refer.'
I sat silent, snared in my own lie, and for once unable to think of a rejoinder that could loose me. I had no option but to go to Lestrade at St Mary’s: he had been pressing me for the last four and twenty hours, and I had been putting him off, moreover this murder case he wanted me to see about was one following what we were beginning to see as a pattern, and a worrying pattern at that.
I know they are not usual.’
‘My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment.’
‘Jack can take you up. He will not be fit to be moved for a day yet, I think. I will not turn out a sick man but the sooner I am rid of you the better. Well, go along then.’
‘It happened that I attended Lady Londesborough’s ball in the April of that year, and I was with her there again upon her return from Cannes. I have never been more shocked in my life to see the change in her. It was as if I met a completely different person to the girl I had known.’
‘Mr Holmes!’ Mrs Hudson stood in the doorway, one hand pressed to her heart, ‘Come quickly, quickly! There’s a boy  - a young man downstairs – he says Dr Watson – he’s hurt - ’
I nodded, devouring the bread in great bites as my stomach pleaded to be filled.
‘No, not wrong. It pleased me and touched my heart more than I can say, to have Minnie’s name remembered like that. I shall try to put money aside for it every year now, to remember her always. Thank you for putting the thought into my head.’
It was the prettiest thing, he’d told Jack, for this doctor, a kindly, respectable man well known to the street lads, had been beguiled by one he did not know to go and render urgent assistance to a poor woman in the throes of childbirth, and had fallen into the trap like a lamb. It had only gone wrong for Grant when the doctor, after being taken to some wretched kennel, and suspicious of arriving at a house where there were no signs of woman present, no signs of family living, nor any midwife in attendance, had declined to go into the room where his supposed patient lay -  and had turned to go, at which point Coulton had simply swung at his head from behind with a billet of wood, and laid him out cold.
I could bear it no longer. ‘Watson,’ I pleaded. ‘Speak to me.’
‘Do not be.’ He stroked my cheek. ‘Do not be. I am with you, and we shall prevail.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Alfred Douglas was offered the post at Constantinople as assistant to Philip Currie, the ambassador just at this point going out, but refused to go. Had he gone, he would have met Holmes when he passed through that city.
From where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room and of every one of his movements. He lit the two candles which stood upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door. Presently he stopped and picked out a square piece of board, such as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas-pipes. This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T joint which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath. Out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper, pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the candles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood waiting for him outside the window.
‘I will not leave London.’ I stood, looking down at him. ‘I cannot leave London: it is here that my – my life and my practice lies. And Watson will not leave Barts: he is deeply – it is so close to his heart. He frets over his patients there like a – like a hen brooding her chicks or a cat her kittens. You will neither send away nor separate us  - oh, ‘
I gave Watson his water, and settled a blanket over his legs, enquiring whether he wanted the fire building up, for although it was summer a slow, weeping rain had been falling all day, and I thought the house struck chill. He thanked me with a smile and a shake of the head before recounting young Holder’s – he of the Beryl Coronet affair – blackmailing letter, and how he had owned to an indiscretion that he had been lured into by a plausible young man . . . and of Colonel Moran’s part in the affair.’
A week later a new, and larger afghan, knitted in thick wool of a deep, lapis blue appeared on the sofa, and under its kindly warmth through the last days of a bitter cold February and the first week of March, we progressed with poor Dantès to his examination before de Villefort, the villainous Procureur du Roi. We were, in fact, sitting together reading one evening when Mrs Hudson tapped on the door and announced Lestrade, and it was with some reluctance that Watson returned to his own chair, sighing, and casting an annoyed glance at the door.
*****
‘Mrs Hudson has a man’s coat,’ he replied. His mouth was wry. ‘Some relic of son or husband. I never thought that I should come to such a pass that I should be indebted to my own landlady for the loan of a coat. But I must take it, be it never so old, for I certainly cannot wear this nor afford another. It is an unlucky chance, old fellow, and I fear that we will not be walking together soon. I do not know what she will bring me, but whatever it is, I must wear it, or go without. Dear God, let it not be too bad.’
. Near midnight, with nearly all having left the Chamber, Labouchère rose to suggest this amendment. It was barely debated; passed on a nod. I cannot even now determine whether Labouchère has a genuine hatred for inverts, or whether this is part of his customary love for obstruction, but in truth it matters little. Any man who harbours tender feelings for another – and displays those feelings for him in public or in private – is guilty of a misdemeanour.’
I retrieved the volume from his desk. 'Why is it my almanacs are always on your desk, and not on mine? No, do not answer that: I know it is because it is always you who looks up the trains. I am a sore trial to you, I  am afraid, my dear fellow. Here it is! Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is 'Mahratta.' Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'Government'; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is 'pig's-bristles.' We are undone, my good Watson! It is finished!'
‘Then what should be done? What is the best way of dealing with this?’
‘Well, I trust you will have another good day tomorrow,’ I said. ‘I am to visit Billroth. He is a great friend of Brahms, you know, and although he is not here, I am eager to discuss his work with one who knows it well, and has always supported it.’
‘Sleep,’ I told him, ‘If you wish to. There is nothing we must do, and you need the rest, for you have slept ill these past few nights.’
When Trevelyan came out to meet us, his face a mask of horror, his long white hands twisting themselves ineffectually about each other, Watson gave an exclamation of dismay and hastened to support him, placing an arm round his shoulders and urging him into his consulting room to be seated. Trevelyan was, in truth, so pallid that syncope appeared a likely possibility, but I still did not think my friend had need to be so very solicitous. He continued to hover at Trevelyan’s shoulder throughout the remainder of the investigation until we left, and was unwontedly silent on our way home. He paid me no mind, but sat, looking into the distance. Finally, I could bear it no longer.
‘You have reversed the couplet, my friend: and no, it is not that. Have you known me so long, and not understood that it is not the physical form that charms me, but the mind, the soul, the spirit? The shape it wears is immaterial. I know nothing of the lady’s mind or soul or spirit, therefore although I say objectively that she is beautiful her beauty could mean nothing to me other than that it is beauty as we count it. I should see a rose with as much delight, nay with more, for the rose cares not if I admire it, nor can it be harmed by my admiration. I may gaze my fill upon it, inhale its scent, caress the crisped edges of its bud, and wonder at the dewed and silky fineness of the petal, its blushing colour, the gentle swell of the bloom as it unfurls. I may experience the rose sensually: I would not do so with a woman. Indeed, I like not to discuss her: it seems – discourteous. ’
The October 30th Clan Na Gael bombings were part of the wider Fenian campaign for Irish home rule.
‘Dumas,’ I had no spirit for the reading, but when we read Dumas we sat close together and I needed him near me that night, a shield against what the morning might bring. ‘Please, Watson. If you would be so kind as to fetch the book, I shall rearrange myself here and make room for you. You will sit with me, will you not?’
'Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am told which page and which book I am powerless.'
Watson cleared his throat. ‘The words terrified me, too, I confess, Inspector. It is surprising what does terrify children. I am sure that my mother thought only to give me pleasure by her reading, and like your father, she too was fond of the work, but it was ill chosen, ill chosen. The scene haunted my dreams also: I cannot deny it. But this is all by the by. What is it you wish to say to me – to us?’
‘I will come with you to Limehouse then,’ he declared, to my no small consternation. ‘I must see young Billy in any case: the fracture in his leg healed well, but there was muscle wastage, and I would like to see how he goes on. We might take some pies, or a few cakes for the children, what do you think, Holmes?’
Death cometh soon or late.
‘If you do not wish to hurt me, do not wish me away.’ He kissed my cheek, and returned once more to the window, standing there, staring out into the street. ‘I can feel you leaving me in spirit, Holmes. I do not wish to be an encumbrance, therefore you must tell me if you want me to go.’
‘Watson, Watson,’ I cried, patting him about the shoulders, ‘Watson, I am so sorry: pray tell me where you are injured. If I had thought it would go off like – Watson, are you – why are you – out of breath, are you hurt?’

' - what Dr Watson is not telling you, Gregson, is that he has allowed the junior doctors at Barts to trespass on his good nature to the extent that whenever there is a case they feel they cannot manage, they call for help, and he goes running - '
I was sure I could have corrected Billy’s world view, but the effort was too great. And being hauled into the cab was doing vile things to my queasy stomach.
It was all he could do to walk, with my arm around his waist, and his around mine. We made but slow progress, and more than once had to sit and rest. Eventually we came into lighted streets, each glass globe wearing a quivering halo of mist. The night had turned, and the city was quiet in that dead hour before dawn.
‘I do not think the treadmill would suit me, nor I long survive it,’ he said, quietly. ‘And I am, brother, most certainly guilty. It is Section Eleven of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, to which Royal Assent was given only recently. I am a criminal now: and so is my – my friend. He is such a gentle young man – affectionate, loving. I confess to being quite – quite hopelessly devoted. And I cannot now think what to do.’
‘Yes: he seems to be a man of large sympathies, a stalwart man, good-humoured.’
‘Do you promise me that you will not – not suspect me of - ’
‘Yet there is much good in the world,’ I reproved him. ‘For example, here before me is an honourable doctor, once sorely wounded himself, and still in need of care, who has been kindness’ self to a chance-met stranger, succouring him to the best of his ability, unfailingly thoughtful and generous. And here is a man of, let us face it, doubtful morals and dubious reputation who is very grateful and proud to be companioned by that same good doctor. Pray let me attend with you, Watson. You developed a friendly feeling for young Trevelyan, I am sure. It is grievous to lose a friend, and so you regarded him, did you not?’
‘Good,’ he said, briskly, setting sentiment aside, and went to wash, and then to speak to Mrs Hudson. I tidied, meticulously for once, poked up the sluggish fire, cleaned and filled his pipe and my own, and set his slippers to warm. When he returned, he was bearing a tray of fine roast beef sandwiches, prepared as only our Mrs Hudson could, and a plate of her Dundee cake and Wensleydale cheese, so I hastened to pour us two glasses of my most expensive burgundy. He took in my preparations with an appreciative glance, and bade me put on my dressing gown before going upstairs to achieve his own dishabille. Thus comfortable, we drew our chairs to the fire, and sat over our simple meal, sipping our wine and then smoking a pipe together while I told him the story of my investigation.
I had offered the olive branch: pray God, Gregson would accept it. Watson too had cooled, and a look from him assured me that he would play the game.
‘I cannot lay belief as comfort to my soul, Holmes. I believe I have a soul – a part of me that thinks, and feels, that hopes and fears and – and loves. But an afterlife? No.’
‘As if I would ever think less of you.’ His smile was fond. ‘There is no man I revere more than you, nor ever is like to be. As for heredity, in your own case, from all that you have told me, it seems obvious that your faculty of observation and your peculiar facility for deduction are due to your own systematic training.’ He handed me a scarf. ‘Come then, let us go, you are right; I cannot stay in here. I feel trapped. I must have air. But the conversation is not ended, Holmes.’
William Stead had, it transpired over the next few days, lost patience with the moderate methods of the reformers, and with some more active colleagues, half persuaded, and half persuading, had embarked upon a course of muck-raking to make his point. He began his campaign with a warning to his readers in the Pall Mall Gazette about the heinous consequences of not passing the damn bill, going on to promise a detailed exposé of the ramifications of prostitution in London.
‘Holmes, my dear fellow, put this on the fire, would you? I really do not have the time to attend ladies’ New Year tea parties.’
John Osborn’s trial and subsequent sentence to penal servitude for life was much cried out upon, and attempts were made to have it commuted, given his youth. Toussaint and Coombs’ crimes were also from the time.
‘Well, if I do not like it, I shall have my revenge later this month.’ I smiled at him, ‘when you will be compelled to listen to an entire new symphony by M. Dvorak.’
The storm broke that night with an unparalleled fury, a tempest of wind and rain. The streets were rivers; the continual boom amd growl of the thunder and the lurid flashes of lightning rendered sleep impossible. I crept from my room, coaxed the fire into life, and stood by the window, watching. After a little, I heard Watson’s step on the stair, and he entered the room and crossed it to join me. He, like me, wore his dressing gown, but he had pulled on trousers under his nightshirt, and thrust his feet into slippers. He raised his eyebrows when he saw my bare toes.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘It had better not be your life.’ Lestrade said. His face was grim. ‘For God’s sake pour me another glass, Doctor; never does my head so spin as when I am with the pair of you. Tell me, then, what you saw. For the world knows Professor Moriarty as a respectable man, an influential member of society, and an eminent astronomer and mathematician. If you have evidence that he is a criminal, then tell me what it is.’
‘Why should you not smile? Why should not I? I have a case, John, a case, and one that is worthwhile. I will solve it: I love my country too much not to help her, but oh, I love the hunt for the hunt’s sake also.’ I pulled him from his seat. ‘John, John, you are the best of fellows. I do so lo – I am so grateful to you for putting up with my moods and my crossness, and my over-all impossible behaviour when I am in the dumps. What would I do without you, to be by my side and do everything that you do for me? And yes, you are right. When I am like this I am transported by the hunt, by the joy of my chase, that keenest and sweetest of pleasures. My mind soars: I touch the heavens. My spirit enlarges itself: I can do, can dare, can command anything. This, this is happiness, pure and unalloyed.’
‘If you warrant him safe, I have no concerns,’ he said. ‘I am better situated now, of course, thanks to you, and in any case, I live very much retired.’
‘I cannot.’ He dragged his eyes open. ‘Not in a public place.’
“If it were possible to oppose a membrane between the two wires” what Holmes, in alas, a cocaine-induced frenzy, is prefiguring is the 1892 invention of the chloralkali process, the industrial method used to produce chlorine and sodium hydroxide. It now uses an ion-selective membrane to prevent the unwanted compound hypochlorite occurring. Watson is fortunate Holmes did not use either mercury in the Castner–Kellner process to avoid producing hypochlorite, or try to use an asbestos membrane. It’s a shame about Watson’s pen, though. It was used for the cathode.
By the December meeting, as I had predicted, all unanimity of spirit was gone, for nothing, as a chronicler of the group commented, more promotes discord than close association between persons with the strong and independent opinions of the average socialist. It might be expected that high ideals would be a protection against such discord, but, as I remarked to Watson, it appeared to be a common experience of groups such as these that the higher the ideals, the fiercer the hostilities of the idealists. ‘Or in other words,’ as Watson replied, ‘they are inhabiting cloud-cuckoo-land: the whole damned, contentious, quarrelsome set of them.’ For my worldly doctor, with more age and experience, had both more tolerance of dissent than the younger idealists, and less patience with their insistence on idealistic purity.
“Have you lost any documents before?’
‘You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter.’
‘Shall I attempt . . .’ I began, exactly as he said, his tone roughened by emotion, ‘Holmes, do you think you could . . .?’

Watson marvelled with me at the silvery black stain on the porcelain before reminding me gently that Mrs Hudson would not thank us for abusing her coffee saucer with arsenic, and, upon my nod, taking it away to clean. ‘For it is still arsenic, Holmes, even if in an oxidative state, and we must not poison our good housekeeper, or ourselves. Nor must we damage her property, for indulgent as she is, I do not think she will thank you for spoiling the set.’ He stood by the fire, into which he had thrown the arsenic-tainted rag, looking at the saucer as he turned it to and fro in his hands. He had small hands for a man, blunt-fingered, dexterous doctor’s hands that would be strong to heal, and kind to soothe. His smile was wry. ‘I do believe my nanny whipped me for breaking just such a saucer as this. It’s strange, the things one remembers about childhood. But Mrs Hudson is far kinder to us waifs and strays than we deserve.’
For a long moment we stayed thus hand-clasped. It was I who recovered first, my physical discomfort dragging me down from the emotional height, my more sober head reminding my unruly heart that our exchange, brief as it had been, was all too telling, was unmistakeable. And John – with what sharp agony did I see the love-light fade from his eyes, watch as he understood what we had said to each other, wince as he glanced around, hasty, almost furtive, to see if we had been observed or overheard. With what agony, alas, did I feel the cold absence of his hands as they reluctantly slipped from mine.
‘Any thought of romanticism is anathema to me.’ I said, coldly, though an unstoppable tide of red had burned from my throat to my brow. ‘Love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all other things.’
‘You were cold to the lady at first,’ Watson commented. I had spent a day or two, running in and out of our rooms, using all the channels of information I had at my command to tease out the threads of Lucas’s murder, and the Lady Hilda’s involvement, and after being baffled on every front, as well as getting thoroughly wet and cold, I sat, on this particular evening, bathed, warmed, fed, although by no means content, across from Watson. ‘She cannot have thought you friendly.’
He was rolling my vest above my waist as he spoke, and I braced myself as he gently pulled down my drawers. ‘I slipped.’
He paused, and I held the water to his lips, bidding him drink. ‘No,’ he went on, after thanking me with a look. ‘Moran does not love you, Holmes, as I said when we discussed it after the event. He does not love me either, Lestrade, for I crossed him in India, and we were, if not sworn enemies then, at least not friends, and are something more than not friends now. It may well be that he is involved in this – attempt on me: it is similar to what was done to young Holder.’ He smiled. ‘It is almost a pity, Holmes, that we did not allow the affair to ripen: had we done so, and had my blackmailing letter come from Mr Milverton, we could have had another, and very powerful link in our chain of evidence.’
'Can you tell me the route by which you returned home?'
*****
‘There is nothing you cannot speak of to me,’ I returned. My hands shook with my need to touch him, to reach out to assure him of understanding, for I too pitied the children. Had I not seen them sold into work little better than slavery, bought body and soul? Those sold for their bodies, both those of my own persuasion, and those not, I pitied above all, for they were often roughly used, and I grieved for their cruel handling as if my own flesh felt it.  Had I not my little group of Irregulars, after all, to whom I passed many a shilling for light tasks, my small attempt to offer solace and security? I laid my fork on my plate. ‘There is nothing you cannot speak of to me. You call me innocent, Watson, but I have seen the vilest crimes, as you have seen the direst cruelty. It is a shame, and yes, a sin, that in these times such things are so. But you wished to set up your plate?’ I prompted, for he had fallen into a brown study, and shadows moved behind his eyes.
Watson and I discussed the contentious section of his Act several times, over the following week. I did not have to tell him the news: after he had seen Mrs Lestrade safely into her convalescence, he had visited Burns-Gibson and Moore Agar to discuss the medical aspects of our Vienna visit, and had heard it there. He, like Mycroft, was inclined to take a grim view of it, but I was more sanguine. It appeared to me – from sundry bitter animadversions he made to the matter - that his sense of betrayal was deep, as if his colleagues in campaigning for the act had dealt him a personal slight by allowing this addition. Labouchère, he could not condemn enough for his hypocrisy and malice.  He was still spending a part of each day at the Lestrades, and of course he had his patients at the hospital to attend. But when he was home, I would catch him at odd intervals, his pen arrested above his paper, brow knit, and mouth tight with distress. I observed him closely at such times, but could not divine the tenor of his thought, for it seemed he guarded his eyes assiduously from meeting mine.
‘There are such in the world, though not many.’
'But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?'
‘Yes,’ I admitted. ‘It is – I was taking it regularly during most of last year, and the beginning of this: A nightly dose. Earlier last year, perhaps more than a nightly dose. Perhaps twice a day.’
However, looking round at the paper-strewn surfaces, and the sickly fire dying of inanition in the grate, I could also see that at least some of his temper might be justified, for today, Baker Street was not a welcoming place for a man to come home to. There was a sharp, unpleasant stench in the room as well – the results of my chemical analysis of the paper fibres. Without answering him, I hastened to open a window to clear the mephitic air, and a gust of rain blew in, scattering papers damply all about, and sending a billow of smoke around the room. I wrestled the window closed again, and turned to apologise, but he had stamped up to his room, growling under his breath about ‘damned inconsiderate friends’, his footstep on the stair growing more and more irregular as he went.
‘I did not say so, my Lord. But it was also of some importance to you that Mr Phelps was not publicly implicated,' I suggested, as delicately as possible. 'His illness must have been distressing for you.'
‘You imply that he is a devotee of the English vice? It is strange how many are: it has never held any charm for me, however. I hope Stark is careful, although observing them, I suspect he is.’ Watson placed my glass on the end table, then sank down onto the sofa next to me with a sigh part amusement, part exasperation. ‘Oh Holmes, do not, I pray you, look so shocked: you might be a maiden aunt with that prim expression. I went to an English public school, a surgeon’s training college, and was in the army: I have been reminding you of this now for three years and also that there is nothing new to me under the sun.’ He leaned into me, the lightest press of his side against mine and angled the book so it rested across our knees. ‘There, I will see the words clear now. Shall we begin, my dear fellow? The translation I read was badly enough worded to make me certain that the French itself could not be so, given the reputation of the author. I am eager to be proven correct.’ He laid his hand over mine, and turned the page. ‘Will you read for me, Holmes?’
‘Two days? What have you done? Have you slept, or changed your clothes? Eaten? Have you been with me all this time?’
‘Jack will protect us. He already has. I hear steps: Holmes, lay me down, you cannot hold me so here. As it is we will have to pay - ’
He had taken up his hat, but put it down again and approached me. ‘That is true,’ he said, slowly. ‘Very well, Holmes, in deference to your acuity, I shall be wary of Professor Moriarty. But I do not think he is any other than an academic.’
‘No’ I admitted, the words thick and heavy on my tongue. ‘It was not for the case. I went with Dupré. To an opium den, yes. In Limehouse, somewhere. He became intoxicated: I, as you see, did not. I took him to his house in a cab,’ Watson growled, low under his breath, ‘and then I walked home. I am as you see me, Doctor. Elevated, perhaps, but not intoxicated.’
'How came Professor Moriarty to have anything to do with it? Porlock's note telling us that he felt the Professor suspected him, of warning you, the cipher, with its identifying names, yes, that points the finger. You have said Porlock was one of his lieutenants, and known as such to you, if only at a distance. But why was Moriarty involved in the first place? Douglas can have had nothing to do with him in America.'
'As I was leaving, was, in fact, just outside the door, I was approached by a lad wearing the uniform of a telegraph messenger, a boy of about fourteen or fifteen, asking for my assistance in a stabbing case. A woman had been stabbed in Whitechapel: life was not yet extinct: he had been sent by the doctor attending to ask my aid: would I come to her? The doctor who sent him, he told me, was one who knew me well, and knew that I would never refuse my help to a poor woman in need.'
‘You must look into Winwood Reade with me.’ I retrieved my copy from under my chair (how did things always find themselves there?) and showed it to him. ‘Perhaps we could take a healthy course of philosophy together, Reade and Feuerbach, not to mention Kant, as an antidote to this intolerable deal of seasonal sentiment and sugar.’ And then, seeing the hurt in his face that he could not conceal, I thought myself a brute. ‘No, no, I did not mean that, Watson, truly I did not mean it like that. I am a cross-grained creature enough, but not such a brute as not to feel. I am most terribly afraid of sentiment, you see. It – I feel things – I find myself moved – perhaps more than I would wish to be moved – and, and, well,  I would not wish you to think me unmanly. Please, my dear fellow, don’t let my careless words hurt you. I – I am –dash it, it is difficult to say this, but, but, well, I have not had such a happy Christmas for many years. I am really very –‘ I looked around at our home, ‘I am quite con – so content here in, in our home.’
‘I would forgive you more than a flight of fancy.’ My mouth was dry, my heart pounding – almost I could believe that he – that he, perhaps did not care for me in so very different a fashion as I cared for him. Perhaps after all there was some hope, but I could not risk it yet. Perhaps if – if – he – perhaps he could be persuaded to care. ‘I could forgive you anything.’

The homophobic Labouchère (a political outsider) and the homophobic but possibly conflicted Queensberry (a social outsider because of his brutality to his wife, from whom he was divorced) hated the group that they described as ‘snob queers like Rosebery.’ All of this is behind the Labouchere Amendment, the Cleveland Street Scandal in 1889, the increasing homophobia of the 1890s, the suicide of Drumlanrig in 1894, and the Oscar Wilde trials in 1895.
Good heavens, what need to tell me that? How could it possibly be important?
‘It is “true maid,” not “honest maid”: if you are quoting, for all love, at least quote accurately. Well then, you are right. Piers Gaveston, and George Villiers. The favourites of those two ill-reputed kings.’
What else could I have said? I had not thought I would miss Watson so much. I had only been away from him a few hours, as I had been many times before during the day, but in this instance, since I knew that our parting would extend for a week or more with the sea between us, I felt peculiarly bereft. There was an aching vacancy at my side: I realised that since we took rooms together three years ago, we had scarcely been apart. We had slept under the same roof since January 1881.
Watson was curious about my dealings, that much was plain, but too well-bred to inquire of me what I did. Though the questions plainly hovered on the tip of his tongue, he refrained from asking them, contenting himself with the occasional quizzical look as he limped up the stairs to his own room. The variety of my acquaintance puzzled him, and well it might, for my clients were drawn from every stratum of society, and might equally grace a princely palace or wash its marble floors. I would, in my turn, have vacated the drawing room for his visitors, had he had any, but not a soul did he see. He was so alone, more friendless even than I. I did once suggest we might invite Stamford to dine, not for any particular liking I had for the man, but to offer Watson some companionship other than mine. He repelled my suggestion with a decided shake of his head, and a frown.
‘Not all the perfumes of Arabia could sweeten that mutton chop,’ agreed Watson, strolling in and lifting his hat courteously to our landlady. ‘I could, as Hamlet said of Polonius, “nose him as I went up the stairs.” I am entirely of Mrs Hudson’s mind, Holmes. I have a few days leave from the hospital - where I have a surfeit of flesh, decomposing or otherwise every day – over Christmas, and I want no reminders here. If you like, Mrs Hudson, I will myself take the apparatus down and outside, and ensure that it remains covered and seemly. Here is your tobacco, Holmes. I was out for my own, and thought to purchase some for you as well. The weather is less dreary today: will you walk with me later, or do you have news from the Yard?’
I urged Watson forward again. ‘The combination of French’s position and his errors have made him an ideal stalking horse for O’Brien’s purpose, which is to blacken English authority in Ireland so deeply that the Phoenix Park murders pale into insignificance beside England’s infamy. But he chose the wrong man when he attempted to persuade French into a libel action – for it is a libel action that he wants, to bring these matters into the public eye, and then he will plead justification, of course, saying that he has acted in the public interest by exposing the detestable sin.’
'Why not? Our love makes me a criminal already: I work with police who would clap me in irons if they knew how passionately I long for your touch, desire your embrace, yearn to lose myself in a sensual delirium with you, with you whom I love more than life. I am already outside the law.'
‘Never,’ he told me, his tone suddenly fierce. ‘Never. It is not that. I respect you no less; you are no less a friend.’
‘We do very well here, don’t you find, Holmes?’ he asked me one afternoon. We sat engaged in our separate activities, I in performing Marsh’s test for arsenic on a specimen of stomach tissue from a domestic murder victim, and he in conning over his account book. ‘I cannot think how Mrs Hudson manages to feed us as she does for the amount we pay her. Why, we had fowl last week, and again this. And a surprising quantity of fruit.’
‘You – you do not speak as most men, Watson. They would rather plunder the rose; pluck the bud and despoil it.’
‘You are too good for false pride, Watson,’ I told him. ‘And I also have been too poor for pride. It is only now that I have proved myself to Lestrade and Gregson that the sovereigns come in a little more easily. I have been poorer than you.’ I shivered, inadvertently, thinking of some of the places I had inhabited, the dirt, the noise, the impossibility of keeping clean, and he looked at me in concern.
‘He is one Sebastian Moran,’ said Watson quietly, and as he did so, the tall colonel (for such I deduced him to be) looked up as if he had heard. He could not have done so of course: Watson’s words reached only my ear, and, moreover, he was turned away from the gentleman. ‘A colonel in the Indian army, a villain of an ugly cut, a Pandarus and an whore-monger, a practised shikari, a tenacious hunter – and a man who has made India too hot to hold him at last. And that, my dear Holmes, takes some doing: they are a lax lot out there when it comes to morals.’
‘You are in a contemplative mood tonight,’ he observed, before I had had time to formulate my enquiry. ‘Or is it just the headache? Try to eat at least two of those little fillets, my dear fellow. You are not on a case, and so need not deprive yourself. I do not wish to press you to converse, Holmes, but I am interested in your opinion of the men we met tonight. What did you think of them?’
‘She was – I thought you rather admired Miss Holder: you did not seem to object when I left you. You spoke to her with enjoyment: I know your smiles, Watson.’
‘Not at all, I merely wished for a demonstration, if you would be so kind.’
‘Watson!’ exclaimed that worthy. ‘And Holmes! What a pleasant surprise! I had no idea you were attending tonight. My dear sir, I wonder if you would be kind enough to allow me to introduce my friends to you . . .’
'Yes, because where could I run to? There is nowhere. There is nothing that can be done. Had we the money, we might plan to escape to the continent. Many of our persuasion do, I suppose, make their homes there, but you could not, Sherlock. Your work, your livelihood - and mine also, is here, here in London. Without it we would be reduced to destitution. We have nowhere to run to.'
For the next few days, save for our morning bathe, I barely left the cottage, so engrossed was I in our researches. Watson supplied me with a couple of wasps, and two dead bumble bees which he found upon his solitary promenade one afternoon, and I performed delicate dissections to establish their comparative anatomy. I was, in fact, quite fascinated to discover that the thoracic cavity contained no lungs, but a network of branching tracheae. I told Watson this and he laughed, and said ‘No, do they in truth? Here have I been imagining tiny little pulmonary sacs, just like ours.’
‘You believe it to be so serious? Truly, brother?’
‘Well you are my Pythias, are you not?’ I could not think of anything else to say. No one had ever defended me as he did, and I did not entirely know how to feel about it other than that it made my heart flutter, and desire spark along my every nerve.
and April 18
The wine – six bottles of it, half the case - had duly arrived, along with a pair of ducks, (much to Mrs Hudson’s chagrin, for like all good housekeepers she prided herself on her ability to choose her meat herself), a bottle of an exceptionally fine Napoleon cognac, half a barrel of oysters and a dozen of Chablis. My brother was a generous man when he chose, and I was, reluctantly, forced to own myself touched.
‘You were not aware I was a lover of comic operetta, Mr Holmes?’ Moriarty tapped me familiarly on the shoulder, and I was at pains to repress a shudder: sooner I would have touched some loathsome slimy thing from the Earth’s bowels. ‘Sullivan is a musician to whom I can always listen with pleasure: it is a pity that his collaboration with that mountebank, Gilbert, debases his oeuvre to the level of patter songs and fantastic plots. This play is a - departure from the norm, however, and one to which I am not averse, since the ending is tragic - and an object lesson in fruitless love.’
‘There is circumstantial evidence.’ I accepted the glass Watson handed me. ‘Thanks, my dear fellow. Attend to me, I beg you, Lestrade, and allow me to explain myself. Firstly, the salary of a professor at the University is seven hundred pounds a year. Now the house Moriarty lives in is freehold, and he owns it outright, so other than the common necessities of life, he has very little expense. He is a single man, he has no family to support, and since his daily round is quite confined and unvarying, he keeps no carriage. His household is small. He has a valet, a pretty young man of German, or Swiss extraction, who speaks little English, a cook-housekeeper and a scullery-maid, a housemaid, and a manservant. Those are all Irish. His servants are very well paid: his valet receives eighty pounds a year, his cook seventy, and the other servants are paid commensurately above the usual rate for such work. Let us say that after his household is provided for, his modest entertaining, and his
‘You are the d - the nearest creature on God’s green earth to me,’ he said, his voice low. ‘Never was a man so fortunate as I am, to be your friend. There. I have said it, and now you will think me sentimental.’
‘That is to say ‘if you love me like your father, I love you like my child,’ is it not? Shall I go on now?’
‘You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.’
‘It may have paid dividends for you on this occasion: do not reprove me, therefore. I am more relieved than I can tell you, Mr Holmes, for the reason I have brought Inspector Abberline with me this morning is because we have a man at the Yard who is prepared to say that he saw the doctor in Whitechapel at the time of the crime. But I think we can acquit the doctor on the evidence that he was in Devon, do not you, Abberline?’
On our last evening in Vienna, indeed, I fell deep asleep, waking an hour later to find myself still cradled in his arms, his cheek resting on my head as he too dozed. I woke him then and apologised very much, drawing myself away and attempting to flatten my unruly hair, but he laughed, eyes soft and sleep-muddled, teasing me and saying that he had had no dagger to cut off the sleeve of his robe and release himself, like the Chinese Emperor of old who had not time to await the awakening of his beloved companion, and that he had therefore fallen asleep himself in simple self-defence. I did not know the story he mentioned, and when he told it to me I was surprised to find that the Emperor’s beloved companion, was not, as I had thought, a female courtesan.
but it is not in common usage here. Carpenter, I believe, prefers ‘Uranians’.’
Johnstone blustered and wriggled, but did not leave, and before the meeting was out had given me more names: Juan Albert de Fernandez, who was an army surgeon holding the rank of major in the grenadier guards and known slightly to Watson; Johnston Lyttle, Malcolm’s own cousin; Farquharson and Boyle, bankers; James Pillar, a Quaker wine merchant now in his seventieth year: Charles Fitzgerald, another aristocrat like Kirwan; a Captain George Joy, a man now in his forties, who had known Cornwall since he was fifteen; two keepers of disorderly houses, Considine and Fowler; innumerable captains and majors in the army; two priests, the Right Reverend Thomas Dancer Hutchinson and Father Paul Keogh, who according to Johnston had danced together (in a rare show of ecumenical unity to which I doubted their respective Protestant and Catholic churches would ever attain) at a ball at Johnston’s father’s house where half the men dressed as women; and an elderly Tory member of parliament: Sir James Tynte Agg-Gardner, who had introduced Johnston himself to Kirwan. He sang, in fact, as the thieves’ parlance had it, not small, but like a bird, and with each and every name my heart sank, for if Meiklejohn was uncovering this network, and it was all to come to court then the ramifications of the exposure would be grave indeed.
‘I fear Mrs Gerard was much to blame for that. I know that she told Durham her sister was silent and reserved, and sometimes shunned his company because of the strength of her love for him, which she could not express, and this perhaps strengthened his attraction to her. She was much sought after for her beauty: he thought himself fortunate to have won her hand.’
Our tender moment passed, as I had meant it to: I could not afford his tenderness. He had no shame in showing it, but it was dangerous for me. He laughed, and passed the violin over, and I played to him. When we parted for the night, his goodnight was fervent, his eyes warm with affection, and he wrung my hand with such hearty goodwill that it was quite bruised.
Watson was ill for some days after his return home, indeed the journey home nearly did for him, for we conveyed him secretly in a dilapidated closed carriage that jolted and banged over the cobbles and wrung suppressed moans from him at every turn of the wheel. Jack and I had to support him upstairs past a shocked Mrs Hudson, and put him to bed in my bedroom, as being more convenient. The wound on his head bled again when I eased the bandage off and I had to bathe it loose, with his head on a towel on my pillow. I called Moore Agar in to see him, and told him the facts of the case: Agar could be trusted, for he was an invert as was I. He suspected me. I knew he suspected me for I found myself incapable of concealing either my concern or my affection for Watson when he was there, but he would say nothing.
‘Would you like to know not the least amusing thing of all that is amusing in this merry little jig we dance with our client, and our client’s unfortunate, and, I fear, too noble-minded, son and his pretty, but suspect, niece?’
'Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question.'
‘I do, Sir.’ She drew from her apron pocket the items she had mentioned. ‘I have already sent to enquire of Mrs Lestrade when the Inspector will be returned. Here you are. I daresay they are nothing but paste, and are in reality trumpery little things, but they are made pretty and delicate enough to tempt a girl who has had nothing like them before.’
‘Why did Baynes warn you, not me? And what did he warn you of, Watson?’
The concert was divine: the heights of emotion were reached. I was quickly lost to all save the thrill and swell of the music; I floated on a celestial sea of sound, experiencing the interwoven harmonies of strings and brass and woodwind both in their separate voices and joined in one great swell of light and colour, a breaking wave, and I riding it, a god, exulting. I only came to myself a little when Mr Lloyd sang the Preislied from Wagner’s Meistersingers. The sweet, mellow, tenor solo brought me back from my ecstasy, and becoming aware of my surrounding once more, I became aware also that Watson’s cheeks were wet, and his hand clenched where it lay on his knee. I extended my own hand, covered his, and softly, naturally, his turned to mine and held, and confided. It rested within my grasp as if it had always belonged there, and always would. My heart turned over, and I moved my thigh enough to drop our linked hands between us. It would not do to be observed, thus joined like lovers.
made it clear to her that she could not any longer. And as for women doctors, I have no doubt for many women it must be a relief to be able to confide in a medical member of their own sex. I am sure that I, for example, could never confide the ills of the body to a woman – not because I would not think her capable, but for very shame: it would seem to me indelicate of me to face her with my, my grossness – so I am quite capable of reversing my supposition and entering into the thoughts of a modest and gentle woman obliged to confide personal matters to a man. He may not, after all, understand her feelings, or indeed her pains - as, perhaps, one of her own sex might.’
‘I do. Although I also thought it was rather you did not wish to be away from me. You remarked as much in your preamble.’
It seemed to me, as I roused, that I had been asleep for some time, for my eyes were sticky and the lids unwilling to open. I knew from the scent of the linen that I lay in my own bed at Baker Street, but had no recollection of how I had arrived there. I put out a questing hand which was immediately taken, and grasped in two warm ones that I knew at once for my Watson’s.
‘Get along with you, then,’ she said, sweeping her hand along the mantelpiece, and tutting at the layer of ash, ‘Really, the pair of you are worse than my own two boys that were, and my husband into the bargain.’

‘Although it was written a decade ago, it was not printed until this year, and there are but ten copies in existence. Its subject matter is perhaps contentious, but to a medical man and a student of nature, it will be intelligible and germane. I disagree with him in some respects – I believe a more pragmatic view can, and should be taken of the physical expression of affection – but it is a noble, a brave piece of work. I would only beg that you return it to me once read. Symonds distributed most of his copies, and since, because of his health, he is now a resident of a Davos sanatorium, I should not be able to obtain another.’
‘The poor young doctor,’ she said to me compassionately, as I arrived home one brisk morning after an early walk. ‘He’s not eaten enough to keep a bird alive, not yesterday nor today, and there he is asleep in his chair again, for all the world like a tired child. Should he not see a physician, Mr Holmes, even though he is one himself? And should he not sleep on the sofa, instead of that hard armchair?’
Holmes’ journeys in Persia are taken from the writings of George Nathaniel Curzon, diplomat and later Viceroy of India, and are completely accurate as descriptions.
‘Of course.’ I opened the flask, and withdrew a drop of the oily fluid with a pipette. ‘It is not so dangerous in small quantities, and I am not intending to blow up a lot of it. I merely wish to ascertain the strength of this particular mixture of the solution for myself, since it was not made by an expert, and has not been tested. But for now, I shall just make do with testing the liquid’s power. Observe, Watson.’
We met Housman earlier in the tale, via a flashback of Holmes remembering his talking to Watson. The events around his disappearance are as stated: Holmes finding him is not, although he might well have been asked. Housman went on to become one of the most famous classical scholars of all time, and a renowned poet, but he never stopped loving Moses Jackson.
‘In the course of my rat-catching, the dog led me into the Professor’s study, much to the chagrin of his valet and the manservant, who were unwilling about equally either to allow me into that sanctum, or to live with the rats any longer. In his study – an elegantly appointed study, wherein were two Louis XV bookcases in, I believe, tulipwood; a writing desk in kingswood – possibly veneered over oak -  in the manner of Charles Cressent;  a mahogany cheval glass dating from the reign of the late King William – a little display of vanity upon the Professor’s part there, perhaps - and a pair of K’ang Hsi plates which I do not think he bought for a song – in that study there hangs over the fireplace a painting by Greuze, who, Lestrade, was a French artist flourishing between the years 1750 and 1800. That painting, of an insipid maiden cradling a hydropsical young ovine, and entitled Jeune Fille a l’Agneau, sold for the not inconsiderable sum of one million, two hundred thousand francs – more than forty thousand pounds – at the Portalis sale in the year 1865. It now hangs in Moriarty’s study. This is not merely to speak of living in comfort, my dear Inspector, but of living in princely luxury. Tell me how a professor on seven hundred a year can afford such luxury, if not from the proceeds of crime?’
'Well,' he said, you will, I am sure, agree with me that if the page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable. It is therefore perhaps not a page, but a column to which he refers.'
Ah, that had stung him, and yet he had urged me himself not to dismiss the lad out of hand. ‘Watson, he was a pair of feet and hands, that is all. I made no confidante of him: how could I with one such? It is only you who - ’ And there I stopped, for I had not, this time, taken him into my confidence.
The concert was all it had been promised to be, a banquet for the senses. It opened to the stirring strains of Wagner’s Kaisermarsch, with its beautiful Lutheran hymn of ‘Ein Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott’ woven in and around the instrumentation in intricate counterpoint. Richter, the celebrated Wagnerian conductor was in most excellent form: with masterly touch he drew out every nuance, down to the most delicate gradations of light and shade of every piece.  Beethoven’s Egmont overture – as I explained to Watson in the interval, for he did not know its story, the tribute of the composer to Lamoral, Count Egmont who had valiantly taken a stand against political oppression – was a feast for the intellect, although it did not move my senses as did the Wagner. Watson thought highly of it, however. We sat pressed close together on one of the dear old, uncomfortable, long, narrow, green-upholstered benches (with the numbers of the seats tied over the straight backs with bright pink tape, like office files) and he smiled at me as I sighed over the cor anglais in Berlioz’ Carnaval Romain, its delicately-stepping entry ushering in the lively tambourines of the saltarello in a well-painted depiction of carnival high spirits. Schumann’s Symphony in D minor proved a sombre counterbalance until its sonorous brasses blazoned the final: a meeting of Apollonian rigour and Dionysian ecstasy.
‘John,’ I eased the sheet back over him for his privacy, turning the grubby blanket atop it back to the foot of the bed, ‘John, wake up.’
‘More dangerous,’ I asked. ‘How so? It had discharged its venom: therefore it had none to expend on me.’
‘No, it is the expression of it. And that prohibition sticks in my craw. For most people – I say most, not all, for as I have said to you before, I accept there are people for whom the physical expression of love is unimportant, the sentiment only being of value to them – most people when they feel a deep and true love, an intense and spiritual communion, find it natural to give it vent in caresses, in touch, even to the ultimate touch which men and women are to share in marriage. It is the natural end of love; we are embodied, physical creatures; it is proper for us to live in the body. Tell me why then, when love can be felt as deeply between man and woman, or woman and woman, and man and man is it only acceptable that man and woman should reach a physical culmination, the expression of supreme love, together? Why is it forbidden to woman and woman, or to man and man?  I do not know. Yet it is so forbidden and so I say to you it is true; Lestrade would think us unmanly, or worse if he saw us even kiss. But I say also it is wrong that he, and society, would think so.’
‘He is himself, as he always is, and my friend.’
He always deserved better at my hands. I had done ill to entangle him so into my work, and my life: looking now at the sorrow in his face, how it sharpened the lines about his mouth, and brought a shadow to his brow, I felt that yes, he had deserved better. He had always deserved better than to be at the beck and call of a wastrel, an addict, an invert.
‘It was only that I had had such a black day. And it does sadden me. Man’s inhumanity to man: will it ever cease?’
For a moment his gaiety bubbled over in a hearty laugh, but he sobered quickly. ‘I am a soldier who will soldier no more,’ he told me. ‘I will defend myself where I must, and fight for those I love to my last breath, but I will act the aggressor no more. I am done with war, Holmes. War is vile, an insanity, an obscenity. I am a healer: I ask nothing else but to be allowed to heal.’
‘So do I sometimes.’ I gathered my commonplace book and a pen, and followed him. ‘But this is also your fatigue speaking, John. Allow me to care for you now, my dear fellow, to help you to rest, and you will see things differently in the morning and be ready to take up the task again.’
‘Myself, I do not know that he has sinned sufficiently to be blackmailed.’ I told him. ‘Shinwell Johnson says that the girls call him ‘Mr Glad-eyes’ and ‘Daddy Do-Nothing.’ But he may have been tempted enough to have a very guilty conscience for all of that.’
He had not specified ‘us’ and I was glad. I had no wish to have the thing out in the open between us: better a gentlemanly reticence on the fact that neither of us, confirmed bachelors as we were, had ever been likely to provide an heir for our parents. (Mycroft ran the estate, but I knew he had had it placed in trust for a cousin, who would inherit in due course.)

‘You know, Holmes, I would not have thought he would have focused on the action of Mr Eccles before the case, nor that he would have investigated Mr Eccles further, once it became clear he could not have murdered Garcia. I would not have imagined he would have taken it upon himself to station constables outside the house of Mr Melville, retired brewer, of Albemarle Mansions, Kensington, where Eccles met Garcia, nor, even in my most unpleasant dreams, that he would have introduced a young constable posing as a rent boy into the house, there to trap those unwary wretches who were simply trying to live, Holmes, to live their lives with some  - some affection to have, in a world that condemns their seeking it. And to enter the house with warrants, no, I would not have thought he would do that. So, alas, I cannot be sure of what he would have thought had he come to the Bull  - ’
‘How touching.’ The Professor poured the glass Watson had rejected into a slop-bowl. ‘You disappoint me, Doctor. I thought you were of – commoner clay, shall we say – given your friend there. He does so enjoy grovelling in the mud.’
‘ . . . “
He brought a bowl of hot water from the table, placed it on the floor in front of me and knelt. With gentle hands, he removed my shoe, sock, and bandage, and set about feeling the ankle all over. It did hurt. It was most exquisitely painful, and looked as bad as it felt, for it was all colours, red and blue and purple and grossly swollen. He was tender with me, each touch almost a caress, but he was most damnably thorough, and when eventually he pronounced that he did not think there was anything broken, I was sweating in my chair, and biting my hand to keep from crying out as I rode the crashing waves of pain. After he had washed, dried and bound the injured foot, he eased it down onto a cushion, and turned almost absent-mindedly to cleansing and drying my other foot onto which he drew a clean woollen sock before he stood up, wincing and stretching, his hands in the small of his back.
He came to me, knelt beside me, and bared his left arm to the elbow. ‘It looks strong enough, does it not? But if you were to examine the bone, you would soon feel a bump in it. He broke my arm, and it set just a little crooked. There were other incidents: I have the scars. He was violent when he was in his fits: we tried, all of us, to get away, but he would hunt us down. I was twelve when that happened – my arm. My brother struck him for it, and received the beating of his life: I thought my father would never stop, with my mother sobbing pitifully, and imploring him to be kind, that we loved him, he was not to hurt us. It was soon after that that Harry left us, swearing he would never see our father again.’
The Pearl Fishers, then known as 'Leila' was then one of Bizet's less popular operas. Its English premiere in late April, 1887, happens just after Watson made his dash to France to rescue an exhausted Holmes after the Maupertuis case, and just before the Adventure of the Reigate Squires. The duet in the final scene between Nadir and Zurga, although ostensibly about rivalry between the two of them about Leila, the priestess, has always been considered to have strong homoerotic overtones. At the end of the opera, Nadir and Leila escape together, while Zurga dies to save his friend. There are therefore many resonances for Watson when, in 1893, he applies this to his own situation.
‘He is with Sir Henry Baskerville, of Baskerville Hall on Dartmoor,’ I replied. ‘He took the train from Paddington yesterday morning – the ten-thirty Cornish train, as I said, and since he is, in effect, Baskerville’s bodyguard, he has been told not to let the man out of his sight. He would not have arrived at their station until mid-afternoon – I believe Sir Henry has a private halt, near – let me see, Cornwood, I think it is, and from there it is full twelve miles to Baskerville Hall, through farmland and fair roads to begin with, and latterly over the moor itself. The train was not due at Exeter until near half after three. It must have been after five - for it is a further two hours to Plymouth, and the halt is not far short of that - by the time he took the coach, and he cannot have arrived at the Hall but with the light drawing in. There is a waning moon, certainly not sufficient for anyone to drive over the moor after dark, and even if he were able to miraculously and secretly transport himself back to a train, abandoning his charge in order to commit murder, he could not reach Paddington before the following dawn. It is impossible that he should have returned before – when did these further atrocities take place?’
'I should have called you in at the outset,' he observed, after I had laid the documents, and the information in the case before him. 'Trelawney recommended you highly, and the Prime Minister spoke in your favour, but I was unwilling to put a full investigation in place. And while there were already rumours of this secret treaty between England and Italy in the public press, and its disappearance was a concern, as long as there were no rumours of its actual contents, I knew we were safe. It was, of course, of enormous importance that nothing of its terms should leak out to the French or the Russian embassy, which would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of the papers, but it seemed to me that, after we searched and searched, after nothing came to light, and there was no rumour of the treaty being sold, no rumour of its terms, nothing was more likely than that the papers had been stolen by some uneducated person. Stolen by someone perhaps, who, thinking them of value, picked them up at an opportunity, and who had then destroyed them out of hand when he could make neither head nor tail of the contents of the roll.'
'Yes, you may help me to both: I know I must hand over the greater part of this fowl to you. What are you going to take, Mr. Phelps—curried fowl or eggs, or will you help yourself to the savoury before you?'
‘I did but – Holmes – what of the fifty thousand – what of the -  the real stones?’
‘I do not trust myself to help you now. Freud does not trust himself to help Fleischl: he has admitted it. The matter is out of his hands, he says. And I – I must see you suffer and know that I have caused it, this bitter sadness in the aftermath.’
'That is not my doing: "but oh, alas, so long, so far our bodies why do we forbear?" as Dr Donne asks? Why, John?'
Queensberry: John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry, the ‘mad Marquess’  and father of Francis, Lord Drumlanrig (his first son) and ‘Bosie’, the Honourable Alfred Douglas (his third son and Wilde’s lover).
‘Have you ever been in love,’ I asked, filling him a glass, which he immediately drained. ‘Pardon me, I should not ask you. But I will match you truth for truth, if you choose. And do not underestimate yourself: this is –not – ah, not at all inedible.’
. Will you, Sherlock? Will you let me, let us, share the same fate, united until death?’
‘I do not have a personal interest, I - ’
‘A little. It is no matter. I am hungry, I daresay, and will be better when we have eaten. I had no luncheon, now I recall.’
To make assurance doubly sure, I showed the constable her picture as I left. Lestrade had remained in the other room, so I could safely do so, and the little cabinet portrait had been trimmed to show nothing but the face, so I thought it safe enough. I could not help laughing at the constable’s amazement over that face, as Watson and I turned down the street, and I tucked my hand into his arm.
By the end of August, Cornwall had been acquitted of the abominable crime: just as Watson had predicted, no medical man would pronounce there to be physical evidence of intercourse
‘After six, my dear chap: have you been sitting there musing all afternoon? I thought you were going to visit Lestrade at the Yard, or did you forget?’
‘The wind moaned so,’ he said. His tone was tight, and his gaze averted now. ‘I did not wish to wake you: it was as bad as I have ever known – or worse, perhaps. And you were deeply asleep, so I would not disturb that small miracle.’
‘You have the strangest way of taking a dislike to someone, my dear man: it is unaccountable. What harm has he done to you?’
And it was joy to be with him at the museums and exhibitions we frequented. If I won a smile from him at my woeful ignorance, if he clapped me on the shoulder with a laughing, “Really, old fellow, did you not know that?’, if I could walk close to his side, our steps matching, my hand always within his arm, I was happy. Coffee was cheap enough, and a saveloy or a penny bun for a frugal luncheon, and a concert, maybe, before we returned home to Mrs Hudson’s good dinners. Then there were quiet evenings in our sanctum, when he read to me, and I played for him. Although I maintained my regimen of morphia, to quell the beast within, I was scrupulous in my dosages, taking only so much as would quieten my flesh. I would not sully our friendship with my shameful desires.
(you see I am versed in the idiom now) before our serious Frenchman. You need not deduce my steps, by the by; I had something to collect from Harris’s in St James’ Street, and so went by the Strand. Did you think I had forgotten your birthday? I am sorry this is a few days late.’
There had to be a first time for Sussex, and also for bees.
‘Of course it is not a thrall.’ I shook my head, as he offered me a sandwich. ‘That is not what I meant at all: it is not slavery, but a willing partnership. I am not hungry, Watson, pray do not press me to eat. Indeed, my stomach is somewhat disordered; I have not had any appetite at all today, and feel quite unaccountably nauseous.’
Watson entered the room at that point - he had been in my bedroom, searching for a nightshirt of his which he swore I had borrowed - and having apprised him of our visitors' imminent arrival, I motioned to the looking glass.
‘When do you go?’ His tone was light, but his brow was still creased. ‘Must it be soon? Imminently?’
It was to me Gregson spoke then, and I saw it with pain: how could he not feel for Watson in his distress?
‘Meynert sent me this.’ he said, proffering the article. ‘Read, Holmes.’
‘I cannot force him to marry.’
But the damage had been done. Not to my friendship with Watson – we went on very kindly together, in the gentlest of domesticities – but to the English government, and to the public perception of men whose primary affiliations were with other men. Society had become aware of a culture that lay beneath the world it knew and respected.
But she was laughing as she spoke, and I did not feel very much scolded.
The difference in the detail was that his accuser claimed that he had walked eastwards to Whitechapel after leaving Barts, not that he had turned westwards to our home. Whether, as we had surmised before, these murders were the work of a deranged man, and our enemy was using them only to smear Watson’s good name, or whether they were cold-blooded murders, with a sinister purpose behind them - and that was to hang Watson - we could not yet be totally certain. We only suspected. But at that time we suspected everything, and so did Lestrade.
‘He is a kind man,’ I said, feeling that the conversation had gone as far as it could. ‘Whatever you think of his – ah – affectional nature.’
‘Has he indeed?’ Musgrave turned to me. ‘Then let us show him the lie of the land. It is a curious old history, that of the Ritual, and I am proud of it, and of the family’s connection to the late lamented royal martyr: I should not object to see it in story form. Suitably amended, of course.’
He tucked the flowers away, and we walked on. ‘But what of Norbury?’ I asked him again. ‘You say you are applying it to yourself? You are the very prince of diligence, Watson, and I have never known you overreach in confidence. Explain your meaning: I am at a loss to account for your attribution of blame to yourself.’
Well, cried Morrel, passing without  - hesitation – no, without, ah, delay, change – from the, the appearance of calm to an expression of violence, when that will be, when I have decided to turn upon myself the pistol or the cannon – no, Holmes, I cannot be right there, wait: the barrel of this pistol – who will prevent me.’
‘The Colonel seems fortunate at cards,’ Lestrade observed wryly.
‘Not surprised?’ I could barely get the words out.
‘This is Mr Benjamin Scott of the Gospel Purity Association? He that was involved in the prosecution of Mary Jeffries for keeping a disorderly house in Chelsea? She pleaded guilty and was fined only last week, was she not?’
He was halfway to the door before I found my voice – it was little more than a whisper.
‘Yes, sir.’
We returned, both glad and reluctant to London– it was home after all, although now a threatened, chancy home – to be hailed with gratitude by a harried Lestrade, and pitched immediately into the case of the Camberwell poisoner, a slip of a girl with flaxen curls, wide, china-blue eyes, a rosebud of a mouth and a handy way with arsenic. (Of course Lestrade had suspected her, of course chivalry had warred with black suspicion within his honest breast, and of course, chivalry had won. He would as soon have suspected Mrs Hudson, I told him, or his own wife, whereat he shuddered, and opined that while there was no chance of his Annie doctoring his food with the liquid from soaked flypapers, he was sure that Mrs Hudson had been tempted to put an end to our existence more frequently than we might like to contemplate.) Lestrade at least, I reflected, watching him as he sipped his wine in our Baker Street rooms, snug, well-fed, and complacently pleased with himself at having scored a verbal hit against us, our friend Lestrade had not changed to us.
‘Thank God for that,’ said Watson, when he returned from the station. ‘I thought we would never get them away: such cries and lamentations from the children you never did hear in your life. I am glad you were not there: you would have been out of all patience. Still they are gone for a fortnight, and I trust they will have an enjoyable sojourn, The weather is kind now in Cornwall, I hear: it is strange how it has reached spring’s temperature so quickly.’ He rubbed his hands together briskly, and came to stand at the fire, which I had made up myself for his return. ‘It is still too chilly here in gloomy London, however. How are you, my dear fellow? We barely had time to speak this morning, before I had to conduct Mrs Hudson to the Lestrades.’
‘For the next twenty minutes there is none to see but the occasional cow in the fields. If I can spend nought but fifteen of those minutes holding you, at least let us be close. I cannot live like this, so near and yet so far. I cannot live without you, do you not know that?’ He kissed my brow, then my cheek. ‘My Sherlock . . . my dear . . .’
‘Nothing then? Eternal darkness? Watson – I sometimes think so too. But then if that be so, why do we strive? Why do any good, if it is all to no avail, if it neither redeems nor condemns? Is it not only the bright hope of heaven, the dark fear of hell that conduce to right action? Why should I not turn my undoubted powers – oh, do not laugh’ for he had chuckled quietly, and given me a little, reproachful pat on the arm, ‘my, I say again, considerable powers of mind to evil and to gain, if there is not judgement in hell to deter me?’
I poured Watson’s sherry, and went slowly up the stairs, unsure of my welcome, so that my tap on his door was a feeble, tentative thing.
He sighed. ‘He once worked under me, and paid for the privilege. How far have I fallen now, that I must go cap in hand to my old dresser? Yet it is a capital thought, Holmes, and to say truth, I am too poor for pride.’
‘Go then, prepare for the night,’ he said, and his lips brushed my cheek this time. ‘I shall come to you when I have seen all tidied away here, and the fire made safe, and I will hold your hand, Sherlock. I will hold it all night if it will comfort you, my dear.’
‘Dr Watson has a good eye for politics. I fear you are right, Watson. This aims at more than French. Do you have any names for me, Johnson? If they are after Charlie Hammond’s boys, then they will be looking at sodomy charges. Who is likely to be aimed at? Come now,’ as he hesitated, ‘I know you have names.’
‘ – indeed: I can always rely on you to know of what I speak, Holmes. It is marvellous to me what you can retrieve from that brain of yours if it relates to the odd, the singular or the illegal. In any event, we were discussing the case and how the patient’s personality changed, and I was able to offer some experiences of my own when dealing with soldiers in India who had received head wounds – instances of recovery where none appeared possible, and subsequent changes in temperament.’ He bent his head, smiling. ‘May I confess to you that – that it, it pleased me greatly to have something of value to contribute? Is that so very conceited of me, Holmes?’
‘What of the rest?’ I asked him. ‘What of the other accusations?’
*****
‘I hate hock,’ I commented, as I made my way behind him to the doors, and without seeing his face, I could imagine the fond, but exasperated expression with which he replied ‘Chablis then, if it suits you better.'
