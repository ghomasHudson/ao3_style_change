Thank you so much for taking the time to read and comment! I love responding to you an seeing what you think. If you are so inclined, you can find me
Dean felt a wave of nausea. Clenching his fists, he went back to carefully running fresh water over the scratches and dings in the beautiful tail, at a loss as to what else would help them heal.
Feeling smug, Dean nodded firmly. “Yes, you should’ve.”
as valuable as a real aerospace engineer. Kind of.
“Well,” Castiel fingerspelled slowly, stepping up into Dean’s space, “a name sign should really only be assigned by a Deaf person. I wouldn’t even give you one, normally. But...I do have a sign that I use when talking about you with my brothers.”
“You should take those back to the bunker,” he’d said immediately, with a shrugging nonchalance that had settled many of Dean’s worries. “I shed plenty, and I have no purpose for them. I’m sure you and Sam can find magical uses, so you may as well build up a stash.”
Castiel’s fingers curled under the edge of Dean’s jaw, possessive, and Dean’s heart rattled in his chest as he looked up at him, waiting for permission.
“Hey, cher,” Benny rumbled warmly as Dean stepped up to the door with his duffle over his shoulder. His strong Louisiana accent brought to mind delicious Cajun food, hot sticky nights, and impressive biceps. Yeah, Dean had been there. They were great friends now and rarely played together, but they’d been a good fit for a while.
And that was it, the sight of Castiel’s come marking Dean’s cock sent Dean over the edge, his own release covering Castiel’s on his stomach.
Fingers grasp his, and he pulls.
“Depends what people want to hear.” Castiel pressed the tip of his tongue to his top lip, allowing fragrant smoke to trickle out from his mouth around the edges as he held the joint out to Dean.
“Ready to get on with failing to save the lives of three million people?” Dean asked solemnly.
Dean went to work whipping up Charlie’s grotesque shake, presenting it with a flourish and a slight slosh of peanut-buttery milk as he slid it toward her. “Voila, madame.”
Dean’s brain began.
Hannah looked a little more uncertain then, offering him a small smile as she signed, “Castiel will no longer be working with you. He requested that another interpreter be assigned, and Ms. Moseley agreed that was best.”
Left to wait by his lonesome, Dean studied the room a little more and went over to peer out of the small window. It looked like he was in some kind of spiritual place, which maybe made sense. They were, after all, looking for the sister of G-O-D himself. Some kind of temple, maybe? Or monastery? It was
Castiel set about filling it out, stopping to ask details that he didn’t know about Dean or couldn’t remember.
“Dean, I told you my family shunned me. Where exactly do you think I’m going? Why would I do anything other than stay here, in the cove, where you can visit me anytime that you want? And I still need to speak to Dr. Vallens, remember—she’s helping me a lot. I’m not leaving you, Dean. I’m not leaving at all.”
“Cas!” Dean affected a small whine, well past the point of enjoying being teased.
I hope you all have a great week, and once again...thank you, thank you for your kindness and empathy. That "SPN Family" vibe is still alive and well in 2021 <3
—were not getting any larger, and he was quickly adding claustrophobia to his list of problems. He wasn’t actually claustrophobic, but it was amazing what new fears bred after waking up in what felt like a gel-filled coffin.
getting his hopes up. He had his guilt removed about taking the scales, and if Cas didn’t care what he used them for...then so be it. Dean could tell him later, if it all worked out.
Castiel blinked slowly. “You took the assignment test in a language you don’t speak?”
Think you can stand to read more from me? I'll be taking a mini-break just to get life in order, but coming up very soon we have a Hold On, Holy Ghost update and some short and medium-sized fics that include kinky Dean and yarn store owner Cas, a story where Dean
It was making Dean itch to burn it down, still.
“Another beer?” Dean asked, pushing up off the seat.
On Dean’s phone screen, held up before his face, Sam glared defiantly. His bitch faces were impressive but after over two decades of them, Dean was mostly immune. “I was thinking about asking her to come back with me for Christmas, but she has a family thing,” Sam admitted. “And anyway, I remembered that time I invited Ruby to Bobby’s work party, and she ended up drunkenly cornering
Dean couldn’t help a little huffing laugh. “Yeah. It’s very far from the most important thing, but as I can’t see what you look like without it…it helps.”
Hunting, as a profession—though it was more of a calling, really, Dean thought—certainly helped to promote a strong stomach and a very dulled sense of smell. There was nothing wrong with Dean’s nose, he’d just learned to breathe through scents much worse than most folk could probably imagine, from blood to bile to bodies.
Sam grimaced. “It does help, but really, it just leaves us with an even bigger pile of research to do.”
“Do I wanna know?”
“Come here,” he said, more suggestion than command.
He’d gotten to know Castiel’s little routines, his likes and dislikes. But more than that, he’d gotten to know him emotionally. He’d seen every stage of fin-quivering and pissy glaring during that time, including that irritated bristling he imagined Castiel doing when he was griping about the traffic. But he’d also seen small smiles, warm looks, even occasional laughter.
Luckily, he had Meg. They’d met in college, even dated…for exactly a week, before they’d each come to certain realizations about themselves. Castiel just preferred men most of the time, and Meg just preferred sex. The “feelings” part was baffling to her. Which Castiel respected, but was often amused by, because as a friend she was fierce and loyal and loving. She just didn’t have the drive within her to turn those emotions towards romance. Luckily, she’d had the drive to stick by him all through college, though, and it was her getting a job out here in San Francisco that had brought Castiel this far from his family, who were all still in Illinois.
Dean grabbed an orange band—he was a submissive, looking to play, and a pink band—he was certainly looking for a guy tonight, after his encounter with Castiel at Harrington’s.
“Go sit down,” Claire said, jabbing her thumb across at an empty table not far from the register. “I’ve got you, old man.”
They hadn’t fought about it, not really; fighting about it would indicate that Dean had something to say, some point to make. No, he agreed that Castiel had a reason to be upset, so he just took it. Castiel was angry, but he
“Coming!” Dean yelled. Then he sighed, pushing the flaps of the box shut once more. It was labeled “Bedding,” but so far he’d found old DVDs, a dead potted plant, and a ladle.
,” Dean whispered, his own breath held. “And I’ll stay, here with you, safe…if you want me. For as long as you want me. It will be your choice, always. Just say the word.”
Dean raised a questioning eyebrow over the half-drunk water bottle.
“Castiel,” Dean corrected, rolling his eyes before turning his attention very firmly down to his sweet and sour chicken.
He was licking the inside of the shot glass. Dean didn’t even try not to stare.
“Are those your car washing shorts?!” Sam shrieked at his rear.
No warnings for this one, I know you're all eager to see Dean clean up his mess! So...enjoy.
“No one else I’d ever want to be bound to. As long as you’re sure, too. I mean, your magic is always gonna have a bit of me in it, now.”
As Castiel trailed off, Dean merely shook his head, clueless. He gave Castiel a little push, directing him on through to the rest of the chamber, the second circular area of the vaguely eight-shaped room, furthest from the door.
but Dean fully expected for Castiel to laugh or roll his eyes—he certainly didn’t anticipate a coy grin, dark pupils, and a pillowy lip tugged by one sharp canine, rolling slowly out from between Castiel’s teeth as he deliberately lifted his hand. He hooked one finger through the neck of his tie and steadily pulled. The blue silk loosened smoothly, inch by inch, and Dean’s mouth fell open in sync with it.
“Not you, Gabriel. ‘You have it in you,’ seriously, what a cryptic—”
With an expression that Dean thought was uncomfortably close to relief, Castiel dug into his coat and grabbed at it. “It’s Sam,” he said, rather too quickly, already slipping out of the booth. “It’s loud in here, I’ll go outside.”
A hand appeared, stretched out, waiting for his paper.
“You look like shit,” Castiel signed, deadpan.
Not that Dean would ever be worthy of a freakin’ angel, even if Castiel somehow made the mistake of loving him back.
“Nearby,” Sam answered, flexing his wrist quickly as Dean broke through the first restraint.
“If you’re going to take a break for lunch,” Dean said, nudging at his baggie, “I have extra pie.”
“I’m really don’t always have a stick up my butt,” Castiel said quietly, holding his glass up but not drinking it. “I’m not usually a slime covered asshole, either,” he added with a tiny smile, raising his eyes back to Dean with a little twinkle in them before turning solemn once more. “I was just scared, okay. Still am, so I guess that means I’ll still be all those things.”
“Glad one of us does,” Dean answered. “I really do need to cram, but this afternoon I’ll go grab your phone and drop it off at your office, so you have it for the weekend.”
They made their way across to the other side of the bridge, beginning to loop their walk around the large park so that they could head back in the direction of the small graveled lot where they’d left Baby.
He hit the floor with a sodden, sticky smack, tumbling into the gross puddle he’d created.
But the minutes passed, and Dean grew more antsy.
“Excellent,” Castiel praised him. “I’m so proud of you, of how well you’ve been learning...go ahead. Whatever you’d like.”
Castiel bit his lip, and his expression did something strange—a little flutter, something like nerves or fear, that raced across his eyes before it was gone, buried under a tiny smile.
“And I suppose her plumbing isn’t quite up to scratch,” Bobby mused, reaching down to pick up the tap Castiel had chosen and turning it over in his hands before reaching for the broken one, comparing them.
Dean explained, watching Castiel’s expression grow darker.
“Mission accomplished,” Castiel signed, before leaning in to press their lips together.
“Cas?” Dean asked again, quieter. He didn’t repeat the rest of the question, but the implication was there.
didn’t need to.
He had a lot to thank Purgatory for.
Coming up next in Chapter 7: Battle Symphony, Dean and Cas try to retrace their steps to find another Leviathan Blossom, and Dean makes an impulsive choice in the heat of the moment.
To Dean’s surprise, Castiel blushed deeply, crimson red in his cheeks and neck.
Scowling through the windshield into the ridiculously perfect morning—seriously, birds were fucking singing—Dean coaxed Baby into another throaty rumble, just for the hell of it. As a barista, he’d be smiling at customers all day, so his drive to work was the only time he could be a dickhead without jeopardizing his tips.
’” Castiel began, his voice lifted just enough that Dean could tell he was quoting something,
Well, some words. There are definitely *more* words that they need to use...and a few other things they need to do, too. But they are so, so close.
By the time Castiel reached the car—a Chevrolet Impala, on closer inspection—the driver had burst out from behind the wheel, leaving the door wide and creaking.
he was—that wasn’t why Dean had brought him here, nothing like that, but still…
“Dean—” he began as Dean unlocked her doors.
“It’s okay, Cas. Nearly done,” Dean whispered.
at his job. He just wasn’t feeling it. His proposition was flawless, he’d worked on it for years, but this meeting, or this client, or…something was off lately. He had that itch, the one beneath his skin that his mee-maw had always told him would lead to nothin’ but trouble.
“If you’re staying more than a day or two, might want to get yourself some more comfortable clothes,” he pointed out.
They parted, and Castiel pushed his way on through the crowd, dazed. He managed to elbow his way up to the door, his knuckles white around his half-empty mug of coffee. Next to the heavy glass entrance stood a stocky man in a black, knee-length coat over a dark suit and shirt, who was thumping his fist furiously against the door.
“Cool. Dunno why I didn’t think of that.”
Castiel’s head tilted comically to the left, but he nodded slowly.
“Right,” Castiel said. His face seemed to have taken it upon itself to heat Castiel’s entire body. “I—I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—”
Dean to ask what he meant.
“Wow, Cas,” Dean replied, laughing and shaking his head. “Tell me how you really feel.”
On Dean’s other side, Sam and Michael exchanged a worried look in his periphery, not pleased with how this was going so far.
the whole experience.
All settled for Saturday then. I’ll see you in class tomorrow afternoon 😊
, or check out my
Castiel squinted at Dean, his head tilting just enough to be annoying. “You think he’s sexy?”
“Yeah.” Dean let out a puff of air, shrugging. “Wasn’t even sure you were real, so…don’t really know what to offer you in return, or anything.”
Castiel’s eyes were wide, sparkling and bright as he leaned over, grasping at Dean’s shoulder like he’d just had a revelation. “Dean! Dean—I understood that reference!”
Sam was quiet.
“Dean,” he manages after a minute, blinking harder again, and Dean sees a shimmer around the reddening rims of his eyes. “I—”
“Indeed. So, in that case, tell me what you like about it.”
Their waiter just gave them a warm grin and went to fetch their refills.
With one bloodied hand, Castiel reached up to push the sweaty curls of dark hair back from his forehead.
Next week: Communication, coffee, and Dean's own words come back to haunt him. Oh dear.
“If you don’t mind the walk, I figured we could go to Vista Diner, on the other side of the golf course? I know it’s not fancy or anything, but Ed and Harry are always talking about how great their corn dogs are,” Dean said, before second-guessing himself, squinting across at Castiel in the light of a large streetlamp. “It’ll probably be a twenty-minute walk, though, we could always—”
“He’s only six years old. He’s innocent. My brother and me, we killed the shaman that was holding him captive and we just want to help him.”
The projection of the ship just hung there, mocking them. Occasionally Castiel would wave a hand at it, or more often through it, and point out that this was supposed to be “Dean’s kind of thing”.
Relaxing, Dean closed his eyes for a moment and rolled his head back against the speaker, stretching out his neck, focusing on the buzz of it and letting it dictate his movements. When he looked again, Castiel was gazing back at him, his mouth slightly open, his feet shuffling and his hips rotating closer to Dean than they’d been seconds before.
The bead curtain at the end of the pink corridor was blackening from heat alone, a wall of choking warmth greeting Dean as he burst back out into the front of the building. Through the soupy air, Dean could make out Earl’s feet behind the desk, his dingy black sneakers parted and pointing away from each other.
“Not true,” Dean said. “Come on, it’ll be fun.” Dean turned to Cas with his biggest smile and found something like fear in the dude’s eyes.
Cas died not knowing how loved he was.
Stevie cut her attention to the door that Dean had just left through and back again. “I mean, I was
And then he died. He died for Dean. Because of him.
“Of course.”
Chewing on the end of the pen, he read through all his shit twice over. Every time one of those thoughts crept back into his head, he read the counter argument. He broke it down. He added to the chaos occasionally, but finally, he was thinking straight.
Dean’s pupils flared. His blood pressure kicked off. Did Cas tell them?
He didn’t finish the sentence. Dean stomped on the stake protruding from Ruby’s chest, impaling the screaming witch to the floor.
, close. He kissed him softly, tongue trailing lightly along Cas’ bottom lip and retreating when he felt Cas smile.
He fought against the rising panic. Tried to clear his head. But all that he could hear was the whisper of his name from Cas’ lips. That soft plea.
The thing that was the Empty scattered like pollen among the flowers. Before him now, stood
Cas grinned, pushing Dean over and laying his full weight on top of him. Cas looked down on him, speaking directly to Dean's parted lips, his voice gravelly and unwavering. "I want to fuck you, Dean. Now."
Dean’s chest rose and fell hard as Cas pulled away, sitting up on his knees, Dean’s legs between them. He stared down at Dean with a question in his eyes and Dean nodded, wetting his lips. He propped himself up on his elbows, reaching for Cas’ blazer. With Cas’ help, they removed it, hurriedly tossing it to the floor.
With one clean swing of his blade, Ruby’s head fell from her body.
But John’s voice never came.
The words caught in Dean’s throat. The truth of them forcing him to his knees. Panic crept along his skin, constricting his throat, clenching his belly. He breathed. Breathed. Breathed.
There were ladies on stage, lip-syncing to some Madonna song. Dean didn’t realise he was staring until Charlie waved a hand in front of his face and gestured toward their booth.
Right. In his defence, Rowena had appointed herself the job. After her help getting Cas back, Dean couldn’t exactly say no. Didn’t particularly care who did the job so long as he had his husband by the end of it.
Cas had spent countless quiet nights learning how to act on his feelings for Dean but had never truly considered the possibility of reciprocation. Not in any long-term sense, at least. Carefully, he rolled Dean off his chest, pausing to be certain the sleeping man didn’t stir. He pressed a sweet kiss to Dean’s forehead and got out of bed with much regret.
She and Stevie met Eileen in the foyer and were immediately ushered to gather around Sam’s laptop.
And then – what? Talk about his feelings?
Dean rolled his eyes. “I get that a lot,” he shrugged.
“It’s for Charlie,” Eileen said at the same time Sam answered, “For Stevie.”
Dean manages to get an impromptu date with the scantily clad angel. Despite his better judgement, Castiel agrees to go to the old Sanderson house. Nothing good can come from messing with ancient spell books and candles under a full moon.
“Maybe, maybe not,” Sam said. “According to the lore, and pretty much any modern history book, there were a lot of innocent people accused of witchcraft.”
It was a short walk through over-grown grass and a small, wooded area made up of gnarled trees and nettles. Many of the largest briars and thorns were hidden beneath windblown piles of auburn leaves. There was a silence in these parts that didn’t quite match the heavy footsteps of booted feet; as though the only sound came from the slightly ragged breathing of the two brothers, and the soft shushing of the leaves. Overhead, the moon in her fullest form lit their path through the branches of the trees.
He made a fresh cup of coffee and without overthinking it, he found Cas sitting alone at the world map table watching one of his Netflix shows on his laptop. Dean sucked in a breath, pausing at the doorway for half a second, and ploughed ahead.
Cas’ smile lingered. He’d missed Charlie. Stevie didn’t come around very often because of her new job, and she and Charlie had been spending every spare moment they could together since… since they’d been lost to one another.
“Dean…” Cas started.
Dean braced himself against the wall. He attempted to make it look casual – as though he had the upper hand and wasn’t worried. But it was obvious he was weakened.
The angel’s eyes met Dean’s and Dean felt like a friggin’ guilty teenager or some shit. Hands restless, shifting on his feet. His palms were not sweating. Hell no.
to point him in a direction. Without
“Put away the gun,” Cas said, voice serious.
Sitting on a crumbling old wall outside the park, Dean pulled a rumpled piece of paper from his jacket pocket, double checking Bobby’s temporary new address. The man had worked a couple cases here in Salem earlier this summer and decided to rent a place out for a year. Bobby swore it was because the rent was dirt cheap (the house had been seriously haunted at first, to be fair) but Dean suspected the guy just needed to run away for a while
Dean reached out without thinking, wiping away the blood on Cas' face with the pad of his thumb. Not noting the softness of the angel’s skin. The heat of it. Nor did he think about how
He dropped his trench coat to the floor and pulled off his tie without undoing the knot. He’d never fully learned to tie a tie. He’d done it before, of course. Muscle memory of his vessel working automatically. But if he thought about it, even for a moment, it always led to fumbling fingers and anxious minutes wasted while he considered asking for help. Cas donned the new shirt, eyes locked on the tie Dean had picked out, cheeks heating.
Sam rolled his eyes. “You want candy so bad, go by yourself. I’ve got plans.” He stood, grabbing a jacket from his closet for emphasis.
Cas snatched the stalker by the elbow, his hands like vice as he swung him into the alley. In a second, he had the man pinned to the wall, forearm crushing against his bearded throat.
The older man rolled his eyes and offered a bottle of beer as a truce.
“You have nothing to apologise for, Dean.”
The smoke hurled first for Dean, but when it couldn’t possess him, it poured itself into the soulless woman instead. Her screams echoed through the entire floor, singing off the glass windows. Below, the music and voices were too loud for the sound to reach them.
Crowley glared. “I confronted her you see. Rowena. The bitch didn’t take too kindly at that, so here I am. Doomed to live out the rest of my days, until the last trace of her unholy existence is gone from this world.”
“I won’t,” Cas promised.
“It’s not too late to call it off, right?” Stevie said softly, her hand settling on Charlie’s knee.
“You were gone for like fifteen minutes, tops,” Dean argued, but the softness of his eyes didn’t match the seriousness of his tone. “The hell happened?”
with some guy? Getting shot. Failing Karla.
“This ain’t over,” Dean’s voice was quiet, deadly. He looked each of them in the eye before turning his back on them, gently steering Sam back in the direction they’d came from.
Cas stared at him in that quiet way he did sometimes; confused, dazed. Like he could see something in Dean that Dean never found when he looked in the mirror. Dean swallowed. Cas’ hand still resting on his cheek. His eyes still burning the whole way to his soul. A soft breeze ruffled Cas’ hair, his tanned skin entirely unaffected by the fights. Not a drop of sweat. The dried blood below his eye and splattered on his trench coat the only things out of place.
Castiel had met a lot of humans on his time on Earth. Some kind, some prone to selfishness, and some admittedly rather pleasant to look at. Humanity wasn’t all that his Father had appraised it to be. Try as he might, Castiel could not seem to warm to these hairless apes. In the quietest hours of the night, he found himself wondering if his Father’s silence was a punishment of sorts. Castiel had tried to love humanity; to understand why the host of Heaven were expected to be so enamoured by it all. He prayed alone in those late hours; for forgiveness, for guidance, for something other than this nagging feeling of failure and abandonment.
They raced to the front door and found a huge, expensive, glass cauldron filled with big packs of Hersheys and Skittles, and some kind of expensive looking chocolate, too. Dean wasted no time stuffing as much as he could fit into his pockets.
Only three houses down and they had enough candy to last for a month.
Charlie gently nipped at her thigh in retaliation. “Shut up.”
The demon lunged.
Castiel felt that hollow nagging in his chest at the thought. It wouldn’t be fair to Dean, he knew. Though Dean was certainly no master of the art of truth, Castiel couldn’t lie to him. Not about this.
“You know you’ve gotta tell him, right?” Charlie continued, and Dean rolled his eyes.
Charlie snapped her head around, facing Stevie with a look of panic washing over her face. “This was your idea!”
The witch had long, curly auburn hair that glowed like fire even in the darkness. The long, skin-tight velvet dress she wore was corseted at the waist; the green complimenting her hair and the ribbon matching it exactly. With one hand on her hip, the witch pursed her lips and snapped her fingers, setting every candle in the house aglow.
Bullshit.
It wasn’t like he wanted his brother to be miserable. Sometimes Dean just couldn’t see past his own dark cloud to see the light at the end of anyone else’s tunnel. It’d been so damn long since he’d felt something. Drinking, hooking up with hot guys and girls in bars he wasn’t even old enough to patron just wasn’t doing it for him anymore.
Dean was in a suit. A black jacket with a matching tie. He ran a hand through his hair and yelped as he caught sight of Cas in the mirror.
God, those dudes just needed to talk already. She and Sam had joked for years about locking them in a room together, just to see what would happen. Maybe all they need is a little push.
The angel smiled softly, his attention never leaving Dean's face.
It was seconds or hours later when his eyes flew open, and Dean sat upright in his bed. His heart pounding and a breathless laugh already shaking out of him before his mind could form the words.
Sam took a seat next to Eileen, pressing a kiss to the side of her head and pulling her laptop between them. “Missed my girl,” he said, smiling as Eileen ripped her mug of tea out of his grasp. Sam returned his attention to Dean and said, “Where’s Cas?”
Dean felt a little guilty for taking the sandwich. Almost.
New chapters on Mondays & Thursdays. We're half way there!
Cas nodded, a small smile playing at his lips.
, but…”
Dean inclined his head toward Cas, eyes widening to convey the message that they’d talk later. There’d be no discussion later, Dean knew. Because it wasn’t happening.
Cas rolled his eyes. He snatched his hand back, pressing it over Dean's mouth to silence the string of self-deprecations Dean realised Cas could hear. Dean shot him an apologetic look and Cas raised a single brow, removing his hand to stroke a finger along Dean's lips. His eyes glazed over a little, as if he was mesmerised by the action. Dean closed his eyes for a moment, relishing the contact before sucking Cas' finger into his mouth, just to see how the angel would react. Cas' breath hitched, and Dean took that as a welcome sign to keep going.
“Who is in my house?” said another, her tone sharper.
But he knew. He’d known for a long ass time. But he couldn’t say anything. Couldn’t do anything. Well, maybe he could. But how could he risk it all like that? How could he look his best friend, a living, breathing angel, in the eye and tell him-
Dean stood with his hands in his pockets, but Cas felt Dean’s gaze on the back of his neck. The fallen angel looked up to the faithless man and saw him not as a god of creation or destruction. Dean did not demand blind faith. Did not expect unwavering love. Did not even think himself worthy of such a thing.
Through whatever terror Dean’s mind rent upon him, that small brush of permission was returned almost instantly. So, Castiel walked into the dream.
Dean sighed, shifting to lay on his back. “I just… I can’t,” he paused, trying to put it into words. Shit. “You deserve better than me, man.”
Stevie pointed to the door on the screen. The handle was turned down, as if it had been pulled loose and left dangling. To the left, a thin slit of light was visible, breaking up the shadow of the door.
“Oh, please,” Dean scoffed. That was exactly what he was doing, but Sam didn’t need to call him out on it. He hadn’t come all this way just to sit in Bobby’s empty house with not even the smallest chance of a blue-eyed hottie in a trench coat giving him a call. “It’s called turning a profit, bitch. Ten dollars to you is worth like fifty bucks of candy to both of us. It’s a win-win.”
The Bunker was quiet this late at night. Judging by the discarded dinner jacket in the kitchen and leftover desserts in plastic containers on the counter, Sam and Eileen had long since returned from their date and had gone to bed.
Humans, Cas had grown to learn, lived in fear of failure and success in almost equal measure. Once an agent of fate, Cas had broken free of god’s plan. Had disobeyed and rebelled against his own father so thoroughly that Chuck could no longer write his story. Cas’ failures were his own to bear. He was not bound by the sins of his father despite being his creation, just as he was not bound by those of Jimmy Novak, despite finding a home in his former body.
A sharp jab from Sam’s bony elbow had Dean reluctantly looking up.
They carried the pizza boxes to the kitchen. Dean opened several cupboards before finding the right one. He pulled out a plate, gathering the pizza leftovers to store in the fridge.
Despite it all, Dean seemed… happy. Which meant one of two things. Either Dean was faking it and really needed a win or… he truly was enjoying himself on this Take-Your-Human-Charge-To-Work day. Even if Cas’ plans had long been altered since this morning. This was becoming as close to a regular hunt as any other, but Dean seemed content with Cas taking the lead. Telling him what to do.
Dean felt Cas' grin against his throat. "I told you, I did my research."
He watched as Sam slid another beer toward Dean; how Dean’s soul flared bright each time Sam made him laugh. It was easy to lose himself to time in Dean’s light.
escaped the giant plastic headphones that covered almost all of his brother’s hair. Sam was whispering to himself, fidgeting with a pen over a pile of balled up pieces of paper.
“Dude, come on,” Dean was on the verge of begging. There wasn’t much he’d beg for, but god damn it he needed a win. A nagging feeling told him that there was still a chance Cas wasn’t into him – wasn’t into guys at all. And there was the distinct possibility that maybe he was into Dean but wouldn’t want to act on it. It was always a roll of the dice. Dean had the gut feeling Castiel was worth it either way. “You wanted to go to the museum, I wanna – “
He leaned against the door, listening to Dean and the lady speak. She wore a cross around her neck, though Cas was certain it was not the jewellery Dean ogled when she wasn’t paying attention. Cas narrowed his eyes at the woman when she tucked a lock of brown hair behind her ear, looking up at Dean between long lashes.
Dean winked, but the kiss he stole was softer than before. He reached for Cas’ hand, fingers locking together. “I love you too, Cas.”
idea,” he amended.
“Hello, Dean.”
Cas’ hand cradled Dean’s cheek and he leaned into the touch, pulling his angel, his
when it came to witches; those who killed innocent people for a startlingly ludicrous list of reasons, none of which actually proved the use of any dark powers, and hunters of the supernatural. Castiel frowned at the notion, feeling an uncomfortable urge to change the subject.
“Bitch!” Dean yelled after him. He stood there for a moment watching Sam go. Damn teenagers.
Dean needed a shower.
He glared right back at her.
It was so damn hard to remind himself sometimes that Jack wasn’t his father. The last person Dean ever wanted to be was his own dad, and yet he’d been so ignorant in the moment with every harsh and cruel bullshit move he’d pulled with his own kid. There was nothing of Lucifer in Jack – the kid was all Cas. He was good.
, but always followed his orders anyway. He was a loyal soldier to the last.
A shot rang out but went wide.
“I’m Castiel,” the guy explained to Sam, like it should have been obvious. His attention immediately returned to Dean. His words were a mixture of accusatory and amusement as he said, “I thought you didn’t like Halloween.”
Sam and Eileen talked about getting a place together. Charlie and Stevie mentioned they were thinking about getting a cat. Almost half an hour had passed before Eileen pointed at the screen, a frown knitting between her brows.
Thank you for all the lovely comments! I know this is a super niche crossover, but its Halloween so why not?
Cas’ eyes were on him again. The colour popping with his new clothes. The shade Dean had quietly referred to in his head as “angel blue” over the years. Stupid. Cas looked damn good, though. Better than Dean had pictured. Not that he'd strained himself thinking about it.
Dean groaned with exhaustion as he got to his feet. Something didn’t feel right about this. Sure, the witches looked like regular people, and that was always the worst kind of hunt. The kind that would haunt him each time he closed his eyes in a dark room for months to come. This felt bigger, somehow. The quiet relief that usually followed a hunt was missing.
It was probably the longest sentence he'd strung together since before that night in the dungeon. Dean’s heart beat a wild rhythm against his ribs, but his mind was clear as a bell.
Cas smiled at Sam.
Dean pulled back this time, his vision cloudy. He blinked away the daze to see Cas' cheeks flushed. Dean's lips fell open.
For the first time in so long, Cas prayed to his father. To the angels – to anyone who would listen and save Dean Winchester in his stead.
Cas blinked, guilt settling in when he realised he was staring. “Are you going out?”
She turned.
One thing Cas knew for certain – he and Dean had to stop almost losing each other before they could communicate.
Cas frowned. “As opposed to a baby named Michael, or John, or Jack?” He caught the visible flinch from both boys at the second name and frowned.
It was Dean’s turn to stamp on his brother’s foot. Cas watched the scuffle, vaguely bewildered.
“What the hell’s going on?” Sam yelled, looking around the room.
“The cat?” Dean repeated, grinning like Cas had just said something highly amusing.
“Hey, buddy.”
The Empty changed its face, tearing the angel away from his happiness for a second time. The flowers wilted around Castiel; the wisteria dripping like darkest ink upon his shoulders. Tiger flowers appeared in the space between the angel and the entity that had trapped him.
So, Dean did the one thing he swore he’d never do. The one thing he knew he’d never deserve. He placed a hand on Cas’ cheek, the other resting on his neck.
The demon stood there stone-faced, black umbrella in hand, glaring at his mother. “You forgot to bloody mention
“But, Dean-“
“You still got that cowboy hat, right?”
Dean took a step closer, barely inches between them. His thumb ran along Cas’ jaw, stopping at his chin. He cleaned away some of the foam with a slow brush of his thumb, skimming the bottom of Cas’ lip. Lingering.
He wanted to tell Dean that the gesture was unnecessary. That he was grateful. That Dean looked better – that there was finally some colour to his cheeks and light behind his beautiful eyes. But then Dean had spoken, and the relief at hearing those words felt as though the weight of the universe had been lifted from Cas’ wings.
“We should… we should probably burn this thing before...” Dean cut himself off, eyes cloudy. The involuntary prayers Cas heard now – they were no longer filtered through layers of shame. Cas knew exactly what Dean wanted.
“Always wanted to do that,” Dean mumbled.
That was something else he had to live with. That he’d stooped to Chuck’s level. That he’d chosen Cas, but only when it was too late. That he’d chosen Cas’ life over Sam’s. It didn’t matter that Dean would die for either of them in a heartbeat. Dean didn’t matter. God himself knew that.
The demon advanced, landing a punch directly on Dean’s mouth. Blood sprayed. She grabbed again for Dean’s wrist, but Dean held fast to her upper arm. He bent forward, and rolled, the momentum sending the demon flying over his shoulder.
Another slow, contemplative nod. Dean realised with a sinking feeling that he still hadn't got a name. “Yes. Probably. This town is small so…”
“Spare me the monologue. What do you need with a thing like that anyway?” Dean gestured toward the pendant with the gun. “Not enough demon deals these days? Got nobody willing to pucker up for you? I gotta say, I’ve had a bit of a dry spell myself lately but-“
Dean only hoped the truth would change his mind.
“I mean it, Dean. I’m happy for you. Both of you.”
Dean muttered a string of expletives. Sam grabbed for the spell book and –
“Do it again!” the redhead said to him.
Dean ran his tongue along the bottom of Cas' fingers, eliciting a sigh that interrupted Cas' speech. Cas seemed to realise the mistake he'd made and pulled his fingers free. Fuck, he was gorgeous. Cas was-
Cas silently begging him to kill that demon. Cas falling to the floor.
“C’mon, man, we’ll make a day out of it,” Dean grinned.
Cas had waited until Dean padded to the bathroom, muttering and swearing about electrical cars and some kind of “uber” driver, before he flew.
Right?
Castiel was helpless. Useless.
Dean put his phone on speaker, ignoring Sam’s questions about what the fuck all that noise was about. Told him to shut up and keep his nose in the lore. Really, Dean needed the company. If this went wrong and that pendant zapped his soul – Dean and Cas would both be gone. There was no chance Sam would get here in time to burn the thing.
Screw it. He had no idea where he stood but what the hell. Not like he had anything to lose. “Well, in case Jimmy Hendrix shows up tonight, here’s my number,” he grinned.
“No.”
He pictured his hand fisting in her hair. Dark hair; cropped short and feather soft. Brown eyes turning sky blue. Slim shoulders turning broad and tanned, running down to a lean muscled chest marked with enochian sigils.
The stubble above Cas’ lips brushed the top of Dean’s. The small scratching was surprisingly pleasant, and it was all Dean could do to keep from shoving his tongue down Cas’ throat.
“I love you, too, Cas.”
She was human.
Cas smiled shyly but his eyes gave him away. Like he knew exactly what he'd been doing. “Are you uncomfortable?”
“Bitch?” Rowena repeated slowly, as if tasting the word on her tongue and finding it a bitter thing indeed. “Sister, do you hear what he called you?”
the angel told himself.
Young Sam showed Dean a rock in his yellow plastic bucket. His little hand curled around Dean’s fingers, tugging at him with all his strength. Dean played along, pretending the child Sam was strong enough to bring him to his feet. “Alright, alright, let’s go. Only ten more minutes, though, or mom will kick my ass.” He picked up a squealing Sam and threw him over his shoulder, running toward the water.
He froze on the stairwell, sternly reminding himself that the clock was ticking. That there were souls at stake.
Dean had been trying harder; treating Jack the way Bobby had always treated him and Sam. Honestly, it was one of the best moves he’d ever made. He loved the kid. Loved seeing him experience the world, teaching him to fix things. Just hanging out with him.
Cas rolled his eyes.
Dean told him, smirking as Cas put Dean’s ring on the wrong finger, cheeks flushed as he corrected himself.
Castiel returned his attention to the cat. “You’re three hundred years old?”
Cas chewed on his lip, sad eyes drifting once again to the crack in the doorway.
Dean told himself.
So frail, these beings. Watching as Dean heaved, Cas felt the unwelcome reminder of how false his friend’s bravado truly was. Dean Winchester may once have been fated to be Michael’s Sword, but he was only human. More human than either of their fathers had expected of him. Not the blunt instrument he once confided in Cas that he believed himself to be. Dean was-
Perhaps it should have been concerning, the ease in which Dean carried the horrors he’d seen and done only hours ago. Castiel wondered if that, too, was a human trait: to endure something so difficult, and then continue to do just that.
Castiel frowned, certain he was missing something. “That can’t be true.”
Dean was tired and hungry and he was all out of fucks to give. He knocked the dude to the ground with one swift kick in the ass with a steel toe boot and snatched up his bag.
Outside the dream in a world where faint moonlight crept through hotel curtains, Dean’s hand relaxed against Castiel’s.
But when sleep finally came for Dean, his hand had drifted from Cas’ hair and rested next to the angel’s open palm. Nothing but quiet
was officiating.”
“God, no,” Sam grinned in the affirmative.
Charlie gave him a quick squeeze, and Dean planted a kiss on the top of her head before she released him. “I’ll bring you a couple of slices, okay?”
“How are you, Dean?” Cas broke the silence, turning to face Dean fully.
He blinked. Felt strangely light for a moment, sort of happy for them, he guessed. It was always little things like that, that gave him some kind of... hope? Peace of mind? He wasn't sure exactly. But whatever it was, it felt like the world wasn't such a cramped space for a moment. Like he had choices - like he could finally stop holding his breath and guarding every part of himself in case that one secret, shameful thing slipped out.
Cas looked at Dean with the usual undivided intensity, and nodded.
Cas smiled. There was something pure, untouchable about human nostalgia.
Rowena lifted the fallen candle pillar, tracing a long-nailed finger along the black flame candle. A smile twisted the corner of her mouth as a drop of wax ran along her finger.
“What?” Castiel tilted his head, openly studying Dean’s profile as though for the last time. Because it would be, the angel decided. After he left this house, he wouldn’t see Dean again. He’d leave Salem – leave this world – until it was safe to go back to his life.
And he
? Dean leaned over the sink, twisting his head to get a better look.
Blue eyes nodded slowly. “I’m sure that would be pleasant. This town is very beautiful this time of year.”
Cas quickly thought it through. Of course, it was possible. It would explain so much more than just the effects of the pendant. Cas hadn't returned to his true form since entering Jimmy's vessel. But the angels - they, of course could see him as he truly is. Cas' mind retracted back to all the snide comments over the years; those claiming Dean was a
“You not hungry?” Dean murmured to Cas, eyeing the single slice of pizza he’d been picking at.
With a thud, the blade struck true in the abandoned vessel’s heart. Black eyes turned to brown, glassy and unseeing. Surprise knitting her brows before her mouth slackened. The body fell, mere inches from the trap, empty eyes staring up at Castiel.
, Dean thought.
Minutes passed before he cleared his throat. He spoke to an audience of none with a voice little more than a croak.
“Wow, slow down man.” Dean sat up, elbows resting on the table. The dark wood was cool against his skin and he felt the weight of Cas’ gaze as Dean rolled down the sleeves of his flannel.
“Let’s get out of here, buddy,” he murmured.
“Check this out,” Dean said, reading the candle’s description aloud in a mocking tone. “Made from the fat of a hang man. Legend says that on a full moon it’ll raise the spirits of the dead when lit by a virgin on Halloween night.”
In a weak attempt to settle himself, Cas tried to call Jack. Jody had warned them there’d be little service in the mountains. Still, when there was nothing but dial-tone on the other end, Cas tried not to worry. Loneliness was settling on his bones, weighing on his wings.
Breathless and completely losing track of time, Dean broke the kiss. His eyes hazy and lips slightly swollen. He grinned. “You miss me or something, sweetheart?”
“Some would say that’s a compliment, Dean,” Cas deadpanned. His eyes softened, that celestial brightness flaring just a little.
The demon was fast. All it took was one split second of distraction and Cas was knocked across the room, back slamming against the wall. Brick cracked and crumbled at the impact. He shifted up to his knees, scrambling to get his bearings.
He’d known the guy for less than a day, and yet he’d never been so curious to know someone in every way he could. Dean looked at Cas and wanted to know what he feared so he could protect him, what he loved so he could bring him joy. He looked at those strong hands and wanted to know how they’d feel in his own, how his fingers would feel on his skin or taste in his mouth. He wanted to know how it felt to be crushed beneath Cas’ weight on this sofa. How his hair would feel if it were tangled in Dean’s fingers. He wanted to press his lips to the hollow point of Cas’ cheeks and feel the warmth of his breath against his lips. He wanted to know the taste of him, the sounds he’d make.
Rowena turned slowly to face the blonde witch with eyes vast and cold as the darkness between the stars. Raising a single auburn brow, she primly replied. “We’ll see.”
This was Dean’s handwriting.
“Are you planning a party?” Cas signed as he spoke.
“So, what, you were just gonna take off? Come on, man.” Dean stood, feet trailing him toward Cas before he thought better of it. “You can’t just keep disappearing like that.”
Dean kissed each bloody knuckle on Cas’ hand, his eyes shut. He trailed his fingertips over the back of Cas’ hand, reverently marking every groove, every vein. Finally, he pressed a kiss to Cas’ wrist, leaning his cheek into Cas’ open palm.
Cas loved him.
It wasn’t just the hunting, the bisexuality, the dead mom or the deadbeat dad. He'd always felt like there was something wrong in the core of him. He’d learned how to deflect or joke or fight or fuck his way out of any situation. He had a damn band aid for every emotional scar waiting to happen. But somehow, all the lies just didn’t fit right with Castiel. Dean looked into his eyes and felt quietly seen. He had this feeling, deep in his heart or his gut or whatever the hell was causing this tornado inside him, that Cas could be trusted. That he wasn’t interested in what Dean had to give, what kind of show he could put on.
Inside the house, Dean clicked on his lighter. The tiny flame illuminated his face, shadows of the flickering flame dancing around his features. The floorboards creaked beneath the weight of the brothers’ footsteps and soon, both had gone beyond the angel’s line of sight.
” the angel repeated, his voice low and dangerous.
Behind him, the beat-up old double-decker marked “Salem Bus Line” screeched as it pulled back onto the road. Dean was glad to see it go. To stretch his legs and be back on his own two feet. The six-hour commute had been hell between stopovers and screaming babies. When his Walkman had died only two hours in, it had taken all his efforts not to jump off first chance he got and say screw it to his lonely little adventure.
Well. Shit. That was new.
more.
you to know that I was never ashamed of… of loving you. I was ashamed because… ‘cause I didn’t know that this was something I could have. If it was something you’d even – something you
There was that cruel tone. The voice of the hunter.
Sam took a seat, smiling to himself as he rummaged through a paper grocery bag. “I said your name like three times, dude.”
Dean riffled through drawers, coughing at the dust that plumed in the air at the disturbance. Sam traced a finger along a collection of books that Castiel suspected were not bound by the leather of cows. Featherlight footprints scurried somewhere in the rafters overhead, and the angel hoped for all their sakes that rats did not haunt these rooms.
himself to want this. Cas brought his other hand to Dean’s cheek, fully cupping his face, and granted himself the sin of looking his love in the eye. Studying every shade of green, every passing feeling, every flare of Dean’s soul.
Dean leaned back against the sticky leather of his seat. “I wrote it down, alright? I don’t –“ he swallowed, eyes focused real hard on one speck of glitter on the table. “I dunno if he’s read it or not.”

Dean wore an old pair of jeans, torn at the knees, and brown boots he had once proudly told Cas he’d owned since his sixteenth birthday. The band t-shirt was the same he’d worn that morning, though decidedly less stained with perspiration. Cas studied the extra rings on Dean’s fingers, the samulet around his neck. In the shift from nightmare to dream, only the location had been altered by Cas. The clothes, the slightly longer haircut – the earring Cas frowned at – those were conjurings of Dean’s imagination. A study of Dean his early adulthood. He looked perhaps ten years younger; some of the laugh lines Cas adored so much had not yet deepened at the corner of his eyes.
As if on cue, footsteps thundered on the metal staircase beyond.
Dean couldn’t accept that. Not six months ago, when the whole world and everyone in it had almost died because of him. Because he hadn’t pulled a gun on himself. Hadn’t given up enough before he’d caved, offering himself and his brother in exchange for Cas’ life.
Oh man, this wasn’t gonna be easy.
Damn it. Dean slid a mask on, fake and easy. “Where to now, man?”
But Castiel did not care for this forest. He did not weep for his loss, for the burden was too heavy for his heart to bear. Asphodels snaked through the forest floor. Their petals blooming at the height of their stalks; the colours dull and lifeless as the angel’s spirit. Castiel got to his feet and stepped on the flowers. Every destructive step he took, more asphodels grew in their place.
Cas was gone.
It was only when the music from Dean's playlist stopped on its second run through, when Cas lay with his head on Dean’s chest, a hand in his hair, that their comfortable silence was disturbed by a knock on the door.
Dean kissed down Cas stomach, his hips. One hand working on the button of Cas’ pants, the other dipping below the waistband. Fuck, he was nervous now. Dean swallowed hard, pushing himself to take that next step, terrified that Cas wouldn’t want this. That it was all too good to be true. That, as always, when things seem good, the rug gets pulled out from under him. And maybe it didn't help that Cas wasn't that far off the holy virgin he'd been when they met.
Cas hadn’t noticed the demon blade laying by Dean’s feet. Using his own near-death as a distraction, Dean picked up the knife with his good arm and threw it.
Dean knocked the candle to the ground, stomping it under foot. But it would not break. Would not burn out. “Sammy, get outta here!” Dean roared, pushing his brother toward the open doorway. Castiel stood with a hand outstretched before him as far as the invisible barrier would allow.
“Fuck you, man,” Dean huffed. “Thirty, and you gotta dress up. That’s my final offer.”
“I’m taking that as a ‘yes’,” Dean smirked, wrapping an arm around the angel’s shoulder to steer him across the street. He regretted it immediately. Too aware of the shifting muscles beneath his arm. The broad back and shoulders. The smell of his own sweat.
It sucked. It sucked just as bad as the first time ‘round.
“Dean,” he said breathlessly, are you seei-“
Charlie shook her head in mock disappointment. “I thought we were past this, man? Besties, remember?” she teased, tugging Cas into a bear hug. “Still not talking, huh?” she mumbled to his back. Cas stiffened in her arms and Charlie released him.
Dean pulled Cas’ arm around himself and settled himself in the crook of Cas’ shoulder. “This okay?” His voice was delicate. Hopeful.
Meg was sniffing around the back door now and Ruby inspected the broken chair, tutting to herself as she repaired it with a lazy wave of her hand. The chair leg Dean had snatched from Sam tugged against Dean’s grip, summoned by the spell the witch had silently cast. Dean held fast, gritting his teeth and fighting a losing battle.
His little brother had turned fifteen just two days after their dad dropped him off at Bobby’s temporary digs. He supposed his dad hoped Bobby would talk some sense into the kid. Rookie mistake.
Charlie furrowed her brow, thinking. “The one with the fruity cocktails and sexy dancers?”
Cas closed the distance between them, his mouth so soft against Dean's. And he kissed him and kissed him and kissed him. If Dean hadn’t believed the angel before, he would have been hard pressed to deny it when Cas pinned him to the wall.
For a few long minutes, neither Charlie nor Dean moved a muscle. It wasn’t until the Dean on screen was sat with his back against the wall, tears streaming down his face and the bloody handprint of Castiel's stark on his shoulder, that Dean shut the laptop again.
His attention strayed unbidden to the door, lingering on the tiny crack he’d insisted they leave open on the small chance Dean felt like joining them.
“You still there?”
Both hands resting on either side of the sink, Dean looked himself over once more. Didn’t find anything immediately amiss. Nothing had changed. Nothing at all. It didn’t mean shit.
It was like this most mornings. He’d waken with the worst moments of the past few weeks blended together, no idea where they’d ended and when today had begun. The night before coming back to him slowly. After he’d kicked the drinking thing, for the most part, it was less like wading knee-deep through mud, having to pry out the details with more effort than he had to spare, and more like the memories coming back to him in steady, rolling waves.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
The hallowed ground lay just beyond the reach of the old Sanderson land and seemed to stretch all the way to the centre of the town. It was a strange location, Castiel thought, for witches to settle. The site posed a danger to those who practised dark magic, and despite Sam’s optimism, the Sanderson sisters were every bit as guilty as they were accused. More so, Castiel suspected. Most of the missing children in these parts during the late 1700’s were never found.
Dean switched off the shower and glanced down at the bruises on his thighs, running his thumb over them until the shade of violet faded to a paler blue for just a moment. He took his time drying his skin. Knew he was stalling.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sometimes Cas wished he could turn it off. Right now, this was exactly where he wanted to be. And the last place should be.
Sam cleared his throat. “I think we should hand the spell book over to the cops.”
Crowley, though largely unhelpful, had at least been useful in some small part. He’d spoken to the angel while Dean showered and the younger boy busied himself in the kitchen. The witches were likely returned by now, but without the book, they had no way to create a potion of sorts to steal the life force from children, rendering them truly immortal once more. The black flame candle that bound them to life would only burn for this one Halloween night. When the sun rose in just a few short hours, the threat of the witches would be gone forever.
His plans were almost immediately foiled by Eileen.
Dean felt the beginnings of a headache press above his eye.
“Cas… I have a theory and I’m not sure you’re gonna like it, man.”
Castiel’s fall was gradual. It took acceptance. Self-hatred, self-righteousness. He’d been lost and broken, but always,
He tried again; kicking his foot out and meeting a hard wall of resistance.
So, maybe Dean put a little aftershave on – the good kind. The shit he saved for special occasions that were so few and far between. Maybe he even dressed in a tighter t-shirt than before. Couldn’t hurt, right?
Sam ran for him. “DEAN! Screw you, give that back.”
Dean was… beautiful. Not only in the cosmetic sense he’d learned humans fret over. There was a gentleness to Dean that Castiel couldn’t quite comprehend. There were layers to how the young, freckled man presented himself. He spoke in half-truths and incomprehensible riddles and appeared to shy away each time he appeared too vulnerable or earnest. Dean was a puzzle, and Castiel was impatient to see the finished piece.
Sam flipped Dean off in response, slamming the bunker door behind him. Bitch.
Dean’s hand closed around her wrist and Charlie turned quickly to face him. Dean didn’t look at her as he leaned over to pull out a chair and gestured for Charlie to sit next to him.
on Castiel. The angels that had feared for him. And Anna, who must have recognised it. Who'd warned Cas long before he could have possibly understood the implications.
Castiel took it as a bad omen. Cats rarely spoke, and its accent…
And sometimes – maybe more often than that – Dean wished he were more like Cas. There was something rotten about Dean. He knew that. He’d seen too much. Too much blood on his hands, too many people he’d failed. Cas included.
The heat of his fingers shot through Cas, but he stood still. Patient. Watching Dean, unashamed, slightly awed. Dean’s tongue peeked through his lips as he worked, his hands swift and disciplined as always. He met Cas’ eyes only once while he reopened the top button of his shirt.
Dean stood, holding Cas’ gaze while he unbuttoned Dean’s pants. Dean realised Cas was waiting for his permission to go further. He swallowed hard, looking the angel in the eye as he guided Cas’ hand exactly where they both wanted it to be. Dean's mouth fell open at the first touch. He pulled Cas closer, shutting his eyes as the angel kissed his neck, his collarbone. Dean groaned Cas’ name before he could help it.
It’s a small town, he reminded himself for the hundredth time. Those douchebags were pretty damn distinct looking. He’d get the jacket back.
The young man stared at Dean, frozen like a deer caught in the headlights.
angel, he was all about control. Dean could see it in the restless way Cas shifted beneath him, hands fisted by his sides in restraint.
Dean wasn’t hearing right. There was no fucking way Cas had just said any of that. It felt like Dean’s brain was running low on charge; each word from the angel’s mouth had to battle past every wall Dean had built in his mind. When they finally hit…
Dean’s door was still ajar. He never slept with his door open.
“So, he just… he can… he still…” What the hell was he trying to say, anyway? He knew "bisexual" was a thing. Some of the best rockers of all time swung all kinds of ways. Dean had been with Benny, but they were friends. It was Purgatory. It didn’t count. And whatever shit went down with Crowley, that was
Sam grabbed Cas by the wrist, tugging him away from Dean and the Sanderson house with insistent whispers. Dean winked at Cas, ignoring the bewilderment on the guy’s face as he shut the broken front door behind him.
“Hell no, I’m not,” Sam chimed in, indignant.
Dean swore.
Well, this was an interesting development. “Go on,” Charlie urged.
Did he love Cas?
Dean braced his hands on the floor in a puddle of Ruby’s blood. His limbs shook uncontrollably; Rowena’s spell setting every atom in his body on fire. Meg smiled down at him, watching him squirm. Relishing his pain.
Cas’ mouth opened. Closed. “There is nothing going on with me.”
"I love you."
He and Sam talked it through. Spoke about the pendant, how Dean had gotten it off him. Cas didn’t tell Sam that Dean had been shot – how close he’d come to sacrificing himself once again. He assured Sam they’d be home soon. That Cas had taken a stash of holy oil when he’d last returned to the bunker to retrieve Dean’s weapons, and would call him when the pendant was destroyed.
Alone, he opened his mouth. Tried to force even a couple of damn words out.
Fuck. Fuck. Not this again. Not now.
She glanced again at the text on her phone.
“It’s okay,” Cas insisted. “It’ll be like it never happened.”
“You love him, don’t you?”
Cas slowly reached for the coat, the knuckles of Dean’s fist grazing his fingers. He glanced up to find Dean staring.
Dean spared a glance toward Stevie, who shrugged. He had no idea how much Charlie had told her but, somehow, he trusted her to have spared the details.
“Sam, no, you have to –“ the angel began, but it was too late.
Castiel’s eyes widened slightly. In the small time he’d spent living with Gabriel and the humans he kept in his company, he’d learned
, I’m so
Cas raised a brow, stripping him ass naked with that look. The angel considered him for a moment; the decision not to push it growing clear on his face.
Cas looked between the two of them; feeling but not quite comprehending the easy unspoken language of the siblings. He bade goodnight to Sam regardless, and was surprised when the man wrapped him in a hug. Dean stood, clapping his brother on the back and pulling him in for a brief embrace.
Was he really about to take a fucking uber? God, he missed Baby.
He hated himself. So much he couldn’t bear it. He hated who he was; he hated every thought and every fucked up thing he’d ever done. He hated that he couldn’t save everyone. That he’d let so many people down. That he always would.
Cas looked to Dean and dramatically threw out a hand in a gesture for Dean to do the talking.
“I’m sorry, Dean.”
Dean raised his brows, waiting for Charlie to continue. He leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms protectively over his chest. There was a phantom of a smile on his lips – like he wanted to smile, or was trying to, but couldn’t quite get there.
“HEY! YOU GOD DAMN SON OF A BITCH, GET BACK HERE!”
Sam huffed a laugh. “Yeah. Unless you’re strictly into-“
Dean shifted forward slightly, meeting the eldest witch’s stare. “Yup, that’s me.”
Castiel was an angel of the lord. He had his orders – had sworn his silence. His alliance fell with Heaven. To
“Tell me again,” he said, pressing soft kisses to the angel’s cheeks, moving across his nose, all the way to Cas’ temple.
She wasn’t fazed.
“Oh crap.”
Dean's stomach grumbled in protest and he reluctantly gave up on the pizza crust, discreetly checking that Cas didn't notice. He didn't need any I-Told-You-So's, damn it. He ignored the fancy bottled waters on the cart completely, instead reaching for another beer. It was good shit, he thought. Dean picked absently at the damp label, hesitating for a bashful moment, before clinking his bottle against Cas' beer.
, passed through the door. He looked... Dean couldn't fight the stupid smile that plastered on his face.
“I did this to you," Dean breathed. "I did this. I - I'm so fucking sorry. Cas I'm so-"
He tried hard not to think of that night. Cas and Jack falling through the tear in the universe – Cas collapsing into Dean’s waiting arms. Cas’ name the first and only word that had left Dean’s mouth in days.
But Cas… Dean had tested him before, in stupid, childish ways. Jokes that went over the guy’s head. Honestly, he didn’t have a clue what the dude was into. Sure, Cas had once said he was
good.
Shame chilled the hopeful buzzing in Castiel’s chest. He wrapped his wings tightly around himself. His wings had been the only form of comfort, hidden as they were to human eyes. The weight of them was something of a companion. Now, they only served as a reminder of the lie between them.
Sam rolled his eyes, hoisting his bag of candy under his arm. “So? Take him to the movies like a normal person. Let’s go.”
“And he loves you, too. Cas is back, Dean.
Cas smiled at the concern. “I’m okay.”
Cas tore the door from its hinges, letting it fall to the floor with a resounding boom. The stained-glass windows at the side of the building shuddered, but no sound of hurried footsteps followed from the floors below.
He scrambled up, tearing back the sheets as though he’d find Cas lost inside them. His heart hammered. Fuck. Where was the angel?
Dean faces off against the Sanderson Sisters, and they are not what he expected. A new member joins their group and Castiel could not be less thrilled.
“He walked into a huge spider web,” Sam said.
” or “
Dean turned fully to face his brother. “Damn, Sammy, you’ve been holding out on me,” he swatted Sam’s shoulder like this was a brand new, ingenious idea he hadn’t heard of until now. “You didn’t tell me it was a witch museum.”
Freedom was in the kisses; first exploring and reverent, then desperate, indulgent. Greedy to take back all they could have had in the years they’d wanted this. Freedom were the hands that gripped Cas’ shoulders in a moment of ecstasy, as surely as Cas had gripped Dean’s years ago in Hell. Freedom was laying themselves bare; exploring the other’s body in soft kisses even after they were spent. Freedom was the time they had ahead, their futures, their choices. Together.
Cas frowned. “Who is it for?”
the guy someone gave their jacket to; he was the one that usually pulled out all the stops and made an effort for his dates.
The angel smiled slightly. He held Dean’s gaze as strongly as the first day they’d met in that barn. When Dean had stabbed him in the heart. Now, Dean stood before Cas with his own heart on the line. But before Dean could speak, Cas was on him.
It was not fucking cool. Nothing about this was cool.
was an understatement. At least that beard was shaved. Dean was a good-looking guy, but that season 5 Rick Grimes look wasn’t his best. She’d teased him about it – resorting to any measures she could to get a reaction out of him in those early days after Chuck. He’d gotten better since, obviously. Small improvements here and there. It was the talking and the isolating that was the worst of it now.
Dean studied his reflection with wide eyes and a thumping heart. His freckled skin was flushed, still dripping with a little water. He ran the taps just to fill the silence.
It somehow ends in a hotel lobby, their arms linked and matching gold rings on their fingers, he really should learn to say no to at least
Once he’s equipped with basic riding skills, Dean and a few other guests are taught how to throw a lariat. It’s not as horrible as the first few times on horseback had been, but his arm and shoulders are still sore when he gets back that evening, and once again Cas gives him a thorough massage though this time Dean doesn’t fall asleep and they spend the rest of the evening cuddled close while watching a horror movie Dean’s been wanting to see since it came in theaters a while back. Cas, who doesn’t care much for those, is hugging his pillow tightly and when the things happening on screen gets too much he hides behind it while Dean turn off the sound and relies on the subtitles until he peeks out from the pillow once more.
To his right, past the open double doors he can see a large banner with the words
“I knew it,” she repeats, reverently this time rather than smug, her hands blindly searching the table in front of her while she keeps staring at them, her mouth opening and closing around soundless words.
. Todd and Janice said there was no way, but I knew the second I saw you’d crossed off ‘two’ on the form.” Somehow it’s her excitement Dean recognizes, mind flashing with the image of a younger version of her along with the name Becky. Doesn’t prevent his current ‘dead fish’ imitation seeing as he has no idea what she’s talking about, considering he hadn’t returned the form that had been enclosed with the invitation.
Not a very good one mind you, hardly more than one of those quickly forgotten comedies that in hindsight (if you even remember anything) aren’t all that funny, but a movie nonetheless.
, except that’s not Charlie’s red hair he can see out of the corner of his eye just like Charlie’s voice has never been that deep or rumbly (he definitely doesn’t remember anybody who had a voice like that, hasn’t spent the last ten years dreaming of its owner and what life would’ve been like if he’d been braver).
The instant his backside connected with the seat of the chair he shot up with a yelp of pain, glowering out the window as if he could see all the way to the enclosure.
He takes 3rd place on the goat tying and bows out of bronc riding – he’s definitely too old to risk a broken bone just to try and stay on a horse that’s actively tries to get rid of him. There are other competitions Dean has no interest in participating in so he joins Cas in the stands where they cheer the participants on along with the rest of the audience.
He tunes back into the tail-end of Becky’s monologue “… as prom kings, but ms Blake said we needed a prom queen, too, and three would be too many on the stage.” Dean still has no idea what she’s on about, he didn’t even attend prom and definitely wasn’t in the running for that particular title. And it would be awesome if Charlie would get here right about now to stop whatever tirade Becky was undoubtedly just a deep breath away from.
No, what he
“Hello Dean.”
“Yeah. Harder than I thought it’d be though.” He looks up. “Thanks by the way, I feel better.” Cas nods his acceptance of Dean’s gratitude and returns to his book. Dean stays cuddled up for a few minutes more before slipping out from under the covers, getting dressed and goes to make dinner.
He wakes up in the early evening feeling much better than he had earlier. Next to him Cas is sitting against the headboard, book in hand and glasses sliding down his nose. Dean smiles at the sight and shuffles closer, getting under Cas’ arm where he can read a few sentences that feel vaguely familiar though he can’t quite place them.
Left foot forward
In hindsight this probably wasn’t one of my better ideas, Dean thought to himself as he slowly, gingerly made his way back towards the cabin and a change of clothes and a cup of coffee. In all honesty right now Dean just wanted to lie down and pass out, not wake up again before his everything stopped hurting.
was believable to those who’d known them in high school to which Charlie had laughed and insisted that was the fun of it) and so he’d left putting their names down to her as well as anything else related to the planning of this weekend. Whatever Becky thought she knew was definitely thanks to whatever Charlie had written on those forms and he should’ve known better than to let her handle things when she’d already let slip there’d be shenanigans afoot.
He sat in the silence for a couple minutes, almost hoping to somehow, some way, get a response.
"Dean," he said softly, shaking his head, as if addressing a child. "What have you done?"
Suddenly, his eyes were closed, and he leaned in. Castiel was kissing him. And he was kissing the Angel back.
Oh fucking God, no. Where was Cas?
So he had to leave.
To protect you.
"Wasn't he with you, dude?"
Sure enough, after roughly a 17 hour drive (Cas wouldn't admit it, but he drove quite a bit above the speed limit), he made it. There was an abandoned cabin- much like the one where Jack was born- just by a cliff. Parked in front of the cabin was a 1978 Chevy Malibu. Cas didn't notice this much at all, though, because he was a bit preoccupied.
Cas realized he couldn't tell Dean about the deal if he was walking away, though. He got up, and started to go for Dean's wrist.
It laughed.
Cas' resolve began to crumble.
He ignored the unintended double meaning.
Dean looked up from his work, obviously thrown by the Angel's sudden appearance.
Dean was looking at him gently, like Cas was the fragile one right now.
"It would wait? For what?"
"Goodbye, Dean." He whispered imperceptibly, almost not at all. And he left.
Michael was screaming in Dean's head, and had been for every second since they had locked him away.
with me.
?" He knew how wrong this was, how deep it would cut, as soon as it left his mouth. But he couldn't take it back, now. Dean Winchester was too stubborn, too proud for that.
Castiel met Dean's gaze.
Dean shook his head as he replayed the scene in his head for the umpteenth time.
"I promise I won't."
It smiled wider.
The last lines read,
"You're the Winchesters' boy toy Angel. So, we're not gonna kill you. I mean, why kill you when we can get at least one of them, right? They'll walk right into it, if we have you."
"Dean Winchester will die after locking himself in a box, and having it be thrown into the Pacific Ocean. He will be three weeks from his 40th birthday."
For a second, it was 2008, and they were in a barn. Castiel's eyes hadn't looked human- instead like they were full of electricity.
The hunter stared, wide-eyed, not quite knowing what Cas was getting at.
Once he let the sun shine on his face…
Or, well. You and me. Sitting on the porch, rocking chairs, the works.
Castiel was glad that they'd averted his plan, of course. Thousands of people were saved, and a potential apocalypse was stopped. As always.
Dean went pale. "You read it."
Cas, do you remember after we put Lucifer in the Cage? After Sam jumped in the Pit, you popped into my car. You remember what you said?
Dean's face twisted in confusion, and then realization.
Cas sighed. "All this time… Dean, you could've just told me. I thought I was going to lose you."
He thought they finally made it. He thought they could finally be together. He thought they could finally be happy.
"FBI? Um, why did they send two of you?"
Mom'll be heartbroken, too. You gotta hold em together, though.
I said yes to him. So I gotta deal with the consequences, and stop him the only way I can.
Dean immediately went back to the motel to ask who else was staying in the building. It was the only motel in town, Cas had to have stayed there.
But he didn't finish; the creature knocked him unconscious.
Dean barked out a laugh at that, lightly slapping Cas' shoulder. His eyes glinted warmly, now, and Cas let his lips part slightly as he appreciated how lovely Dean truly was. "You got that right. Dude turns into a fuckin' baby every time. Did I tell you about the one time-"
"Cas, I dunno if you got your ears on, but I guess it's worth a shot, huh? I really don't know where you're at, man, or if you're safe, or… And it's killin' me. I need to know that you're okay, and that no monster has ya or something. If you get your dumb ass killed, I-"
I guess pushing 40 is pretty old, for a hunter. I don't really know what I expected. Retire, maybe do what Bobby did.
Dean made it into Bushnell after what seemed like way-too-fucking-long of a drive, if he did say so himself. All along the way he asked about Cas, but he received rather vague and unhelpful answers. Of course, he couldn't believe his luck that he was even on the trail. About halfway through Missouri, he realized that it was possible that Cas could have been headed for the exact same case, but that was probably just wishful thinking.
"Oh," Dean croaked. "No, there's gotta be some way, Cas..."
For ten years, the Angel had done everything he could possibly do, had given everything he could possibly give- including his life- to protect Dean Winchester. And now?
But Cas just gasped out a half-laugh, shaking his head disbelievingly, blue eyes watering.
"What do you mean? Where is Dean?" His voice grew more urgent.
"This one gives you the state, and this one looks like the entire country."
"Dean, I…"
It had only been a matter of time until it got to this point.
Cas drove over to the Hallward residence. Of course, he couldn't just tell Mrs. Hallward that her husband was a werewolf and was going to kill her. Instead, he sat in his car, and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.
"Cas, spare me the "it's not you, it's me" thing, please. I get it. It was my fault for putting myself out there, right?" He started to head for his room, planning on drinking himself comatose for about 5 years. Or maybe forever.
Dean prepared himself for the yelling, the "What the Hell, Dean?", and just maybe, for Sam to want to leave, too.
"Yeah, Cas?"
"For me to be happy."
I love you. Cas, I love you.
He was broken out of his thoughts when Dean moved again, now facing him, arm stretched out. His eyebrows moved in a twinge of concern, and the corners of his mouth went down. Still, he slept. Castiel felt a pang of guilt rush through him. It's not that he wanted to leave Dean like this. He never wanted to leave Dean's side. He loved Dean, more than he's ever loved anything in all of Creation. And that was the reason he was leaving.
Cas almost started to say something, Dean's name, but stopped.
It had been a few hours.
"Dean," Cas started.
Eventually, it got to be 3 AM. Absolutely nothing was happening. Cas sighed, and started to turn his car on to leave. Just at that moment was when a movement caught his eye. He whipped his head to the side, just barely able to make out the figure using his heightened, angelic senses.
It has always, as of yet, been unspoken between them.
It was a harsh, passionate kiss. Like in those movies, where the girl is about to get on the train, and never come back, and the sad music plays.
was the reason Castiel had walked away-
There was one missing victim hadn't gone after a family member yet. And, the other two could strike again.
"Cas left."
"Well, then, we'll have to find him so you can tell him yourself."
Castiel woke up, dazily. It was daytime, and
Now with the edge taken off, he took a shower, and brushed his teeth.
The monster turned to stare at Cas.
"We always do. It'll work out. I promise."
Cas kept going. "I figured that wouldn't happen any time soon. But, now, I have to say no to… exactly what would make me happy," Cas shifted closer to Dean, and grabbed his limp hand. He intertwined their fingers.
He then opened and read the letter Dean wrote him.
Oh, Cas would not forgive Dean for going on a suicide mission without properly saying goodbye.
Dean already looked like he had lost Cas.
Dean.
Dean looked up at him.
Dean just barely prevented himself from rolling his eyes at Cas' alias. He had said before that he quite respected Kelly Clarkson and her strength as an independent woman.
Cas took another small, analytical sip as Dean passed him the nearly-empty bottle.
You said that I "got what I asked for. No paradise, no Hell. Just more of the same."
It was cut off by a penny being shoved into it's mouth, and it's head being, well, cut off.
"Cas!"
Sam proceeded to bitch face him. "You really think I don't know that? It wasn't my choice, it was his. We both know that there's no other way."
Cas turned it over, and saw that it already went back to it's human state. That was rather quick. No matter. He had to find the other ones, still.
After they had sex.
Dean actually came for him.
"C'mon," Dean said, an almost juvenile grin on his lips, "I don't exactly feel like drinking alone tonight."
Cas looked up, being faced with three people.
"That's what you all really are," Cas continued.
Perhaps, Castiel realized, those pockets of clarity weren't the worst thing that could happen.
"Cas, please, don't do this to me, please. I need you, I-" Dean choked up, and let out a sob.
"I love you too."
Of course, this is when Sam walked in, rubbing his neck.
When the pulled away, Dean whispered against his lips "Finally."
Sam popped his head into the war room.
But right then, Dean's eyes looked old. Not like an elderly human's eyes, no- he had the eyes of a being who had went through centuries of torment.
"I couldn't live with myself, Cas."
"Not used to talking about it. But I guess you could say that sometimes, it was nice to see myself in men besides my dad. I had this- fantasy, where I was in the Old West, right? And I'd come into town on my horse with a gun, give them a name and no one would say anything. I'd just be me, y'know? Never really got that, not 'til I…" He trailed off, his throat bobbing. "I'm glad you're around, Cas."
Cas cut Dean off, as he pressed their lips together, trying to communicate every feeling he had at the same time. Dean reciprocated each feeling just as much as he kissed back. Cas' hands went to Dean's hips, as Dean's hands went to Cas' arms.
He expected the hearts to be gone, but he didn't expect the rest of each body to be so…mangled. The coroner wasn't much help, concurring that bear attacks were the only plausible explanation, as the injuries seemed animalistic. He told her that he'd return the next morning to check up.
"Ghoul-pire."
"Yeah. Wow, you're good."
Dean jumped into the Impala and drove over to the Hallward family's house. Looking at the house, there seemed to be no signs of struggle at all in the front. He went around to the back, however, and saw the blood stained ground. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.
Castiel briskly exited the Bunker, got in Baby, and headed west. He ignored the tears that prickled his eyes as he thought of Dean's words in the letter. They could figure that out after Cas finished saving Dean. Right now, he just needed to get there in time.
"Well, his phone is off, so his GPS is, too. He doesn't want to be found, but still needs to navigate, right?"
All in all, Dean was the reason he left.
Sam glared at him. "What the hell did you do?"
"No, it's not that, I just…" Again, Dean looked up, but tried to nonchalantly maintain eye contact.
"Well, I wonder what's on the other side of the finish line,' Cas murmured, bemused.
Not sure if you remember it, but I definitely ain't gonna forget that time after I took you to the brothel. I was terrified, honestly. I know we didn't go all the way, but that was the most I'd ever done with a dude.
Sam appeared, confusion and concern clouding his face.
Now, they were alone.
"I'm sorry, if you haven't noticed, that's kind of my job. If you think I'd be so inclined as to sit here and watch you silently waste away, you are mistaken, Dean. For eons, I thought I understood humanity so well. Why you do what you do, what's important to you. I thought I'd understood everything. And then I met you."
It was almost a 9 hour drive. He passed through Missouri with no problems, only stopping for gas. When he did, he used the money that was in his pocket instead of the credit card that Dean gave him.
The figurative light bulb went off in his head.
They weren't out of the woods yet.
"Cas? Wh-"
"They have to. At the very least, Dean ought to show up, considering you two are joined at the… y'know. Everything." The monster gestured at Cas' body.
Cas considered this, and supposed it made sense, even if he wasn't sure exactly what Dean was talking about.
Dean's eyes then panickedly searched for some way to escape this situation. His razor sharp fight or flight instinct was kicking in.
The only pattern was that those who were still missing went missing before their dead relatives were murdered. Were these werewolves that were killing their own families? That made no sense to Cas. He stopped by his motel room, it then being about 6 PM.
"Oregon. I'll text you the details."
It was a goodbye kiss.
"It's not like he's gonna walk across the country, like Forrest Gump."
But, Dean…
The younger man reluctantly pulled the keys to the Impala out of his pocket, and threw them into Cas' hand.
Well, Dean wasn't okay. Not in the slightest. And there was nothing Cas could do but watch.
He got in the Impala and headed east, for Illinois.
he thought, as he took another shot.
Dean realized.
He gave her his number.
Because that
The other two jumped off of him, so Cas stood up and started to grab his angel blade.
"Cas? Where y'at, man?"
"Cas," Dean gasped, fear building in his stomach. This was exactly what he was afraid of after Jack came back. This could not be happening.
So, Dean then called them 'ghoul-pires'. Cas never cared for that name.
They stayed like this for a bit, catching their breathes.
He knew he had to be strong, for Sam, for Jack- for Dean.
"Just off brand vampires who don't even realize they're dead, so they need a copper coin in their mouth and their head cut off. It's quite sad, really," Cas smirked as Dean dug his hand into his pocket and pulled out a few pennies.
Somehow, they'd done it.
He turned around, yanking his arm away, afraid of salt being thrown into the wound.
The alcohol-spurned flush of Dean's face dampened somewhat, enough for Cas to notice that he had clearly said something that struck a chord. A splash of concern and regret ran through him, but he would not worsen it by forcing Dean to explain anything.
"Nachzehrer."
"I love you, so fucking much," Dean panted, breathlessly.
God, I am awful at this.
Dean looked at Cas with more hope in his eyes than Cas had seen in a long time.
Cas figured that Dean's father must've taken the photo. He wondered about the man who raised the Winchester boys often. He imagined he'd be angry with John Winchester for abandoning them as he did, if they met. Still, he smiled at the memory captured in the picture.
I just hope you can forgive me for this.
he was being held down.
Castiel walked almost 15 miles west from the bunker to civilization, having arrived a bit after the sun came up. Sam would probably be getting up for his morning run, but he wouldn't notice Cas' absence yet. He asked the tired high school student working at the gas station for their exact location. Apparently this was the exact center of the county. Cas knew he'd have to get farther than this, of course. That is, if the Winchesters were going to search for him. He turned his phone off, so he couldn't be tracked. Better safe than sorry. He asked the boy for a map, and received a perplexed look.
"Jack's dead, Chuck's gone. You and Sam have each other. I think it's time for me to move on."
"Definitely the strong, silent type. Agent Clarkson."
"Cas?"
"I promise," He repeated.
Dean put his drink down, and sighed. His hands were trembling, Cas noticed. Even in the silence, Dean was wincing continuously.
"I guess that means we're good, Cas?" Dean grinned.
Of course, he knew it was their type of thing once he saw that the two dead people had their hearts ripped out. Awesome. Probably just werewolves, but he still guessed he should handle it.
Cas tried to pay the kid, but he wouldn't take any money for the maps. He had no idea how much they would cost anyway.
Cas didn't know what to say. After all the two of them had been through, and here Dean was telling him to not worry about him.
"Yeah, we will," Dean murmured.
Before he got there, he got a call back from the hospital.
That wasn't what I wanted at all.
I can't really explain it, but...
I don't just… do it, though. I'm… I'm in it.
Dean closed his eyes and sighed. That could mean he's anywhere.
This was perfectly fine by Castiel. He never even considered it as something that set Dean apart from his brother, or anyone, for that matter.
Once they broke apart, they pressed their foreheads together.
"You know I'm more of an actions kind of guy, Cas. I'm just glad I was able to even write the damn thing. I couldn't imagine dying without you knowing. I honestly don't know how we're gonna get out of this, man."
Dean knew he didn't deserve Cas. He never did. Not now, not when he pulled him out of Hell. And it took Cas more than a decade to realize it.
And Dean kept drinking. Cas really didn't drink, because it took quite a lot to have any effect on him. But, the last thing he wanted to do was make Dean drink alone right now.
They migrated into the Impala, and just held each other for a while.
Dean's voice cracked as he held back tears.
"I don't know what to do, Cas. He won't stop, and I can't even think-" Dean's voice cracked on the last few syllables. Cas' heart broke.
"Us," Dean stuttered.
"How-?"
"Dean, you mean..."
Cas grabbed Dean by his flannel shirt, and kissed him.
"2 dead, 3 missing in series of bizarre serial killings in Bushnell" it was titled. Hmm, definitely sounded interesting.
"It's just kinda funny now, to try and explain to an Angel, I guess."
He grabbed his coat, and keys.
"No, no. It's fine. Thank you." He hung up.
Well, this is it. Here I am. Writing this, after… well, it's been a long time coming. A very long time. At least, it feels like that to me, but probably doesn't to you.
Dean's mind went blank. Was that…
"Um, yeah, I can look, I guess."
"I wouldn't blame you if it was true," Cas stated.
So, this was their ending. It wasn't how Dean expected it would go.
Dean wanted him too.
Dean pulled Cas in closer by his hair, unrelenting.
Cas felt hot tears on his face, and it took him a minute to realize they were not his.
Dean raised his right hand, and gingerly stuck out his pinky.
He left, awkwardly.
You know me as being all sarcastic and macho, I guess. I mean, you see how I am. Women, alcohol, it's just my thing. You know that.
Apparently, that was the wrong thing to say.
"We'll fix it, Dean. I promise you. And when we do, Michael will pay." Cas shifted to fully face Dean now.
His pained groan rang loud in the quiet of the cabin as he tried to stretch his hunched back and right his poor legs, his butt protesting every move as if it was doing the work. Dean scowled at his reflection in the mirror that inexplicably hung in the short hall way showing him his ‘little old lady’-walk in all its glory as he shuffled into the kitchen to get a cup of coffee and nurse his wounded pride.
contest.
“Had fun?” Cas asks, his voice rumbling in his chest.
(then cursed)
right foot
Getting Cas to come along had been as simple as asking, even if he’d looked a little skeptical when Dean had listed all the things they were offering, like roping and bronco riding and the thing Dean looked forward to the most: herding.
Dean’s ready to breathe his own sigh of relief and greet his friend with an
The people in front of him steps to the side and at long last he’s made it to the woman with a pen hovering above said tags and he’s about to open his mouth and give her their names when she squeals like an excited toddler;
And now here he was, sore beyond description from doing little else than
At home he changes into more comfortable clothes, prepares the ingredients and then takes half an hour with a book to relax before he hears the front door opening. He’s on his feet and in the kitchen when Charlie pokes her head through the door to say hello, the pan heating on the stove before she’s out of sight once more.
written in blue letters lined with grey. Dean doesn’t have to see the rest of the words to know what’s hidden due to either the angle he’s looking at the banner from or the fact that the rooms are separated by walls but he still can’t believe it’s been ten years since they graduated high school even if, objectively, he’s aware his thirties are lurking right around the corner.
Closing his eyes to gather his thoughts, Dean takes a deep breath, another, another, until his heart slows down and he doesn’t feel like he’s about to pass out. Then he look up into a pair of happy-bright blue eyes.
The couple are finally leaving their spot and the woman cheerily greets the next in line, Dean watching them make their way through the doors trying to put a name to either of them, but they both look so
As if he can read Dean’s mind, knows Dean needs the confirmation, Cas moves a fraction of a step closer, takes Dean’s hand and lifts it to trap their entwined hands between their chests, letting him feel the steady beat of Cas’ heart, of his own heart; in sync, together. He smiles, brighter and brighter still at Cas’ answering one, until it feels like they smiling bright enough they could compete with the sun.
Becky lets out yet another squeal, her eyes darting from Dean’s hand to, presumably, the man’s next to him, an even brighter grin on her face than when she’d first seen Dean.
When the music stops Cas and the woman lets go of each other, Cas bowing and the woman looking over at Dean, laughing at whatever Cas said before curtseying and going back to the people she’d been talking with before asking for a dance, Cas making his way across the floor to once more stand next to Dean.
until he finally made it to the door, his bow leggedness more pronounced with the pain he was in than usual.
The first notes are barely heard before the first couple steps forward and begins dancing, soon followed by others. Cas’ hand is warm in Dean’s, his skin soft but calloused where he gently squeezes Dean’s fingers. A woman comes to stand in front of them, her eyes shining and a blush in her cheeks when she asks Cas to dance. Dean lets go of his hand and waves him forward, his eyes following them as they move around the space, carefully avoiding the other dancers.
“Oh shut up,” Dean finally says, playfully elbowing Cas who carefully sat his mug on the table, innocently raising his eyes. “You’re thinking it. Loudly.” Cas grins and leans in for a hug.
Once they’ve had enough of people Dean drags Cas with him to the training barn to introduce him to the horse that taught Dean to ride. He’s a little surprised to realize his eyes are a bit moist at the thought of leaving the horse, Cas wrapping his arm around him and hugging him tightly until the sadness dissipates and Dean can focus on saying a proper goodbye, knowing Cas isn’t going to laugh at him for his sentimentality.
The closer it had gotten to their vacation the longer the days had seemingly gotten and Dean had felt like a kid on Christmas eve with how excited he was.
When he’d been a kid Dean had dreamt of growing up to be a cowboy. Romanticized as it no doubt was the idea of traveling vast distances on horseback with no other company than thousands of cattle and a few other men had been appealing. Sharing meals made over open flame beneath the starry sky and sleep on the ground with a saddle for pillow and wrapped in a woolen blanket had seemed like a dream come true. Life had led him in a different direction and Dean had never even learnt to ride a horse, but the dream was still there somewhere deep inside.
done was letting Charlie convince him they should attend their high school reunion as a married couple (because, and he’d said so repeatedly,
The woman greeting and handing them their nametags is having yet another lengthy conversation with the couple currently in front of the line. It hasn’t gotten any more interesting than the five other times it’s happened so far, so Dean’s looking around for some kind of distraction.
“Hungry?” he asks, already turned to the small fridge pulling a few things out to prepare for lunch. Dean grabs cutlery, glasses and something to drink, smiles a little when he sees the pillow on the chair he’d declared his own. This time sitting down isn’t as bad and his stomach reminds him he’d skipped breakfast just as Cas sets a filled plate in front of him.
Distantly he could hear someone shout and the thought of someone seeing him like this and make fun of him was enough to get him to keep moving.
With a quiet sigh Dean finally lets go of the vague sense of regret that’s been with him ever since he ordered the tickets for this trip. Maybe there’ll be other days where he’ll wonder what life could’ve been had he followed his childhood dream and tried to become a cowboy, but here and now looking up into the starry sky Dean knows he made the right choice, knows that if he could do it all over again he’d still end up here, dancing with Cas, because this is where he belongs, where he’s happy.
It begins like this: It’s a perfectly ordinary Monday where he gets up, showers, dresses, eats breakfast and goes to work. He has lunch with a co-worker where they talk about work and then he goes back to his office until five. On his way home he makes a stop at the grocery store buying a few essentials and whatever he thinks he needs for dinner, he pays and walks the rest of the way home humming a song he’s heard somewhere but can’t remember neither title nor words.
The first one’s a cream pie; it’s well made and looks like a picture from a magazine. It’s tastes good, too, but isn’t Dean’s kind pie. The next in the line is a meringue pie, far too sweet for either of their tastes and they quickly move on to the third. This one is perfectly golden on top, the crust buttery and flakey and the whole thing filled with perfectly cut apples dusted with cinnamon and sugar. Dean eats Cas’ piece, too, not because Cas didn’t like it, but because apple pie’s Dean’s favorite and Cas can’t vote for it anyway considering he made it. Something he’s not going to tell Dean until they get back home and he hopefully manages to make another one that’s just as good.
For a few minutes neither of them say anything, Dean taking the last swig of coffee, a hand relieving him of the now empty mug, his side feeling a little colder as they move away to refill it only to warm when the filled mug’s placed in front of him. Out of the corner of his eye he can see Cas looking out the window, hands folded around his own mug of coffee; his face carefully blank though Dean can see the amusement deep in his blue eyes.
They steer away from the various potatoes and barbequed meant when Dean catches the first whiff of pie filling, grabs Cas’ hand and rushes in that direction.
The teenager had smiled at him and recommended stretching and a hot shower to prevent any stiffness in the morning. Dean had thanked them with a terse smile and politely refused their offer for help, watched them lead the horse back outside to begin the intricate process of removing tack and cleaning it off before letting it relax in the pasture with the other horses. Which he only knows because he’d paid attention when they’d been shown around the ranch shortly after arriving and not because he can see it from where he’s experimentally trying to move his feet.
The mug’s nearly empty when he hears the door opening, the rustle of clothes and the soft bump of shoes being toed of and neatly placed along the wall, then footsteps and the heat of another body next to his.
When they’ve eaten and cleaned they watch a movie before going to bed, getting ready for yet another long day.
They watch for a while, the music ending and beginning a new until finally familiar notes float through the air and Dean bows, Cas taking his hand and leading him out on the floor. Dean’s not a good dancer, has no sense of rhythm, but for this particular song they don’t have to do anything than hold each other and gently sway in place.
(he winced)
They eat in silence and once they’re done Cas puts their plates in the sink, puts away the food before making Dean get up. He instantly regrets not doing as the teenager had suggested and stretched while he’d still been warm as now his muscles feel stiff and even more sore than they had when he’d walked back from the pen. Cas takes a look at him then herds him into the tiny bedroom, gets Dean out of his jeans and shirt and leaves him to lie down. He’s drifting somewhere on the edge of sleep when Cas comes back, the faint smell of lemon scented oil hitting his nose a second before Cas begins massaging him. Dean’s fast asleep long before he’s even moved past his shoulders.
He handed Cas the coat, tapping on the breast pocket before letting it go. “I, uh,” Dean cleared his throat, his voice still barely there, but he fought through it. “Thanks, Cas.”
Cas’ voice was quiet in his confession to the man he considered worthy of reverence. Shame did not lace his words as he spoke of how John Winchester had fallen to his knees at Cas’ wrath. He felt no guilt in describing how he’d broken the bones in John’s hand, using gentle finger tips on Dean’s own hand to map out the damage. He didn’t share the words he’d told John that night; the words the man had forgotten in a haze of pain and alcohol. He and Dean both knew the warning to keep his fists far from his sons was pointless - one selfish act free of subservience couldn't change John Winchester, and most definitely couldn't alter the path of the Michael Sword. But that didn't mean Cas was content. Didn't mean he'd ever view Dean as some kind of weapon.
Dean had glared into that mirror and seen his father glaring back at him. That reflection was all John Winchester in those early days after their mom died and the only home they’d ever known had burned to the ground, taking every chance at a normal life with it. Dean had been no better when he’d lost Cas. Chasing ghosts and hunting answers. The difference was, he’d already burned his bridges with his family. He’d let Sammy down. Let his kid down. Let Charlie down.
Dean sighed and mumbled, “Look, just don’t be a dick about this, okay?”
Cas froze. He debated flying to the bunker to speak face-to-face. But leaving Dean, even with the warding…
Stevie sure had no complaints.
Castiel’s heart said,
, the entity said, with doubt growing in its voice like weeds.
When he’d finished with Cas’ neck, Dean held up a finger and padded to the towel rack. He pulled a folded towel, gripping it harder than necessary. His mouth opened as though he were about to speak but thought better of it. Instead, he pressed the towel to Cas’ skin.
“I don’t understand.”
For the first time, Cas had kissed Dean and not the other way around. He'd finally shared with Dean his most precious truth, and Dean’s soul had lit up like a firework. Cas had never seen a soul that bright and brilliant; not on any human in all the years he’d paid attention.
Dean was so loud. Too loud. Images passed unbidden through Cas’ mind – non-verbal thoughts that reached him as surely as the thousands of other prayers. His breath hitched.
“My pleasure,” Meg replied, her voice low and hushed. It was a devil’s smile that played at her scarlet lips. One blink and the whites of her eyes flooded black as ink.
altered how you feel. Please, trust me on that.” He paused, looking away again. “If we're... I have no idea how you really feel, Dean. But whatever it is, I don't think you want to feel this way."
Another text came through that had Charlie rage punch the back of the sofa.
“It doesn’t matter,” she said, and Dean hated the strain in her smile.
Cas had sensed him several times throughout the day, lingering in doorways and staring at Cas as though he was expecting something. But every time Cas tried to converse with him, Dean would mumble under his breath and hurry off to some secluded corner of the Bunker.
“Do you really expect him to find it? Dean, the guy’s been wearing one outfit for a decade.”
Dean shrugged Sam off, but the kid grabbed for him again.
She sat up for a moment, wrapping her arms around her girlfriend’s shoulders, before pulling Stevie down beside her. It was easy to get tangled together like this; even easier to lose track of time when they got carried away. But they had nowhere else to be today and, god, Stevie was so warm.
“Why?” Cas’ voice was low enough to rattle along Dean’s bones; gentle enough that Dean felt the weirdest urge to pull the dude into a hug.
“Dude,” Charlie said with the biggest smile, “this place is crawling with babes and you haven’t looked at a single woman – or dude – once. What are you still doing here?”
Hours had passed. Dean hadn’t moved.
Cas squeezed him tighter at the words. “Does that mean you want me to stay?” He sounded so scared, so hopeful.
Dean looked sheepishly at Stevie, hoping for some kind of moral support and finding none of it. Stevie shrugged, her eyes darting between Dean and Charlie as she sipped through her straw, her head leaning on the palm of her hand. Son of a bitch, she was enjoying this.
And noticed that his dad’s jacket was gone.
It was like stepping into another life.
Cas had watched Dean fall to his knees. Dean, who was so caught up in his own mind, he didn’t notice the lack of rustling of Cas’ wings. So, Cas had stayed. Unseen. An invisible and burning presence.
“Thanks for that, by the way. What you did back there. You didn’t have to do that.”
Cas explained. Told Dean exactly what they should be prepared for tonight. This was big. Whatever the demons had planned –
weird,” Dean replied, indignant.
“I thought you were gone. I didn’t…” Dean’s words failed him.
Blue eyes blinked at Dean, slowly. Squinting slightly, like he was staring at the sun.
The man winked at the girls, who stepped aside automatically as he lifted his hands in front of his chest. With a snap of his fingers, tiny fireworks burst into life, whizzing between his outstretched palms and sparkling between his fingertips. When he clapped his hands together, the fireworks disappeared.
Maybe Dean didn’t have the words. But he’d show Cas exactly how he felt. If there was one thing Dean was confident of, it was that.
Bobby rolled his eyes. “
of freedom.
, the entity said, wearing the face of an old friend.
He should really get a haircut.
Cas smiled, his hand running up Dean’s arm and coming to rest on his shoulder. Dean’s heart kicked up a storm. For one crazy moment, Dean thought Cas was gonna kiss him. He mentally ran through how bad he must smell after the fight. How badly he wanted to brush his teeth after all that candy. Mostly, he wondered how Cas’ bottom lip would feel between his teeth.
The dude frowned at him, his head tilting to the side.
Cas rolled his eyes at what had clearly been a distraction. But he couldn't help the wide smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes. He’d seen Dean do terrible things; witnessed him act out the false legacy of a blunt blade again and again. Dean could be sharp, and cruel, and cunning. But Cas could not imagine a touch so tender by anyone else.
In truth, Castiel had never given much thought to joining in on the revelry and sin.
That Dean could do. He had a sneaking suspicion Bobby was trying to distract him with busy work. Heavy as they were, there were only three bags in the back seat, but Dean didn’t complain as he carried them up the steps and into the house.
When Stevie asked about her night, Charlie was venting before she knew it. She hadn’t meant to. Her girlfriend smelled good and she was warm, and she’d missed Stevie so bad she’d slept with her phone on the highest volume with the most obnoxious text tone on the slight chance she’d land home early. Worth it.
Dean pulled Cas along down the hall, stealing glances and feeling his ears burn. Even after months of being together, making up for all that lost time, Dean knew he’d never get tired of the small victory of being able to look Cas in the eye and not feel that old shame for it. He was still no good with his words, but that was fine. He knew better ways to make Cas feel seen and known and loved.
Dean struggled, hands desperately trying to push the demon away as she grappled with the pendant. To wrap it around Dean’s neck.
complaining.
Cas felt the edges of the dream darken as Dean’s mind drifted to the past. There was little he could do without interrupting Dean, besides quietly edging that darkness away with his grace.
Cas."
Cas pushed the memory from his mind. Pushed it all away.
Dean’s heart was a wild thing in his chest. His anger drowned out by - was it fear that had his pulse racing? His gaze dropped to Cas’ lips, the stubble above them left unshaven.
He glanced down at Dean to see him look off at something along the water’s edge. A young boy with floppy chestnut hair and a bucket came running toward them.
The place looked good. It was a far cry from the mountains of books and weapons and odd car parts in Bobby’s own house, but the dude had really made a home of the place in the last couple of months. The ex-haunted house was warm and smelled vaguely like cinnamon. Dean smiled wistfully at the mess of homework littered on the kitchen table.
Sam cracked open a beer, smirking like the little bitch he was. “Isn’t that a little homophobic?”
He knew the talk was coming, but damn it. Maybe he’d given up drinking too soon.
So far, he'd kicked almost every guest out of the Roadhouse, sheepishly requested their return, only to boot them back out again. He wanted every last person he gave a damn about here, but once they were in front of him… it was too much.
Dean awoke to the sound of his belly growling and the smell of meat feast pizza in his nose.
The blade flew toward the demon’s chest.
Dean knocked Sam’s baseball cap down over his face. “How ‘bout you save your voice for ordering takeout? Jerk.”
Dean didn’t flinch when the gun clicked and pointed at him.
Cas frowned, eyes dropping again to the dead woman before him. Her slackened fingers still curled around the handgun Dean had taken from the stalker that morning. The gun Dean had now, his own gun - Cas had been sure to fully load it with devil’s trap bullets when he’d retrieved it from the bunker.
“I was wondering when you’d be along, Castiel,” the demon crooned. “One never strays too far without the other,” she said, turning her attention again to Dean. Her mouth so close to his ear. Too close. “If only guardian angel boyfriends were so easily come by.”
Love letters and mixtapes.
The final sister looked up, smirking at Rowena. Which meant the witch in red, Dean realised, had been Ruby. Meg’s blonde hair fell just below her shoulders in a loose curl. Unlike the others, Meg wore fitted black pants and boots that laced all the way to her knees. A midnight cloak fell over her loose white shirt, the velvet ties almost concealing the obsidian crystals she wore about her neck.
The glass steamed over again, and Dean stared absently at the water pooling down the drain. Counted down from ten so he wouldn’t punch something. Again. Again.
“Oh, come on. Let’s grab a burger or somethin’. Haven’t seen you in months,” Dean said, trying real hard to ignore the cold feeling threatening to settle in the pit of his stomach. So much for their big reunion.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Say it again."
He thought of calling Charlie. She always got him. He had a feeling she’d known about this even before he’d really known, himself. She hadn’t even met the guy yet, but the way she looked at Dean when he talked about Cas…
They quickly scooted away, scowling at each other for all of two seconds before bursting into a fit of laughter. Sam scrambled to his feet first and offered Dean a hand up. Dean pulled too hard and knocked Sam on his ass again, resulting in a litany of swearing and name-calling. Ruffling Sammy’s hair before kicking the little jerk out of the way, Dean climbed to his feet. He backed up, caught his breath, and took a seat by one of the windows.
Cas raised a brow. “Are you done?”
Dean looked behind him, following Cas’ line of sight.
Dean operated his entire life believing he had to justify the love people felt for him. That he had to perform and put on a front and give his whole life for those he cared for. Perhaps the latter was hypocritical thinking, Cas had to admit, but it was true.
The demon’s true eyes showed then, narrowing in disgust and a healthy dose of fear. When he didn’t answer, Cas bashed his head against the wall. Fisted the collar of the demon’s shirt with his other hand. It revolted him to stand so close the creature, but Cas leaned close, nose to nose with the demon and repeated the question.
It was Cas’ heart that was beating now at dangerous painful speeds. “That’s not true,” he murmured. “You may not remember, Dean, but you have me. You always do.”
The heat of the fabric on his neck was unexpected, but nothing compared the scorching touch of the callused fingers that met his skin with care. Devotion.
Dean shook his head. He wasn’t ready to talk about the nightmares. Not yet.
The museum was busy. A red carpet lined on either side with matching coloured ropes tied to golden stands, leading the way to the tall stone building. Cas found no sign of any demons, no hint of the supernatural in the faces outside.
The man swore, fingers fumbling in his pockets.
Dean dropped his head further, giving up altogether.
Once more, the most delicate shade of pink flushed along Dean’s cheeks. He swallowed hard. “Tell me I didn’t say that out loud.”
He knew Sam wanted out of the family business. Knew he and their father would never see eye to eye. Hell, deep down he knew the kid had every right to go to school and live some normal apple-pie life. Deep, deep down maybe.
“I don’t have it,” the demon rasped, black blood trickling down the back of his neck. “We were supposed to steal it tonight.”
The history, as it turned out, was not so ancient as Cas imagined. Dean told him stories of his childhood; stories he’d never shared with Cas before. Or anyone else, the angel suspected. From beginning to end, Dean’s knees bounced anxiously under the table; one hand holding his beer like a lifeline, the other held safely between Cas’ own hands. Cas stroked the back of Dean’s palm in a soothing repetitive motion, listening intently and marvelling all the while that Dean allowed him to touch him like this.
Dean dropped his fork, crossing his arms. “Alright, let me have it.”
Castiel paced in the graveyard.
Dean was gone before Cas could comprehend the interaction, but that was okay.
"No, I didn't," Cas agreed.
It didn’t matter that he wouldn’t speak. The pendant hadn’t been taken. There was still a chance he and Dean would get to it.
he need?
Caught out, he made his way to the table on hesitant feet. He didn’t understand why he was feeling so nervous. This was his family. His home.
His duffle bag was already strewn over the twin bed. Dean eyed the bottle that peeked out from inside. It was tempting to break it out. Have a couple of drinks with their pizza. Get a little cozy with Cas. But something stayed his hand. He wasn’t quite sure what.
It sucked the next time and the time after that. After the fifth, Cas wasn’t quick enough. Dean hurled his guts up in the gutter outside some poor old lady’s house. His stomach felt hollow. Painfully empty. But that didn’t stop it rumbling when the old grandma offered him up a slice of cheese-steak sandwich after Cas was done healing her.
to hang out with you? Dude, that’s low.”
Crowley’s voice was quiet as he said, “three hundred years.”
method before he could think better of it. “Is this one of those ‘gay pride’ things?” he threw up some air quotes as he spoke. “‘Cause that’s not me.”
“Am I hurting you?” Cas’ words were so gentle it was almost startling.
He drew in a breath and words that tasted like lies crept along his tongue. But he swallowed them. He wanted to shake his head, roll his eyes and laugh off how stupid that sounded, but he didn’t have the energy. It was like he’d thrown the last of his effort of the day in just getting out of bed and showering that morning.
The angel looked at him like he was the most obnoxious petulant child. But Dean knew how to turn on the charm. “How about this? I buy the beers and you drop me back here before Sammy gets back? Cool?”
When he’d walked Charlie to her car hours earlier, she’d embraced him in a hug. Promising to return later that week and leaving Cas with a message he’d found both comforting and cryptic.
Maybe he felt the drive to hurt this guy right now – knew it in his blood that he
“What’re you doin’ here?” It was no co-incidence that Sam tore away at the sound of giggling girls behind them.
Dean didn’t pause to question it. The moment Meg turned her attention to a shrieking Rowena, he threw his blade with every bit of strength he could gather. It stuck true, right in the centre of the blonde witch’s throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
that Dean saw when he looked into the vessel’s eyes.
Cas felt the missing beat of Dean’s heart and sat up. Dean was pale.
“Why have they locked the door?” he heard himself say.
Dean brought the whiskey to his lips, feeling the burn of the alcohol on the sensitive skin. Something stopped him taking a sip. It wasn’t working. It hadn’t
Dean kicked in the rotted half door of the entrance. The latch of the bronze doorknob slid right through the sodden wood, and inside there was only darkness, heavy with the weight of a fell promise.
Seeing Castiel’s eyes roam over his body from head to toe, Dean felt a little smug. He slunk off up the stairs for his second shower of the evening. There was a spare bedroom down the hall not quite the same size as Sam’s, but still larger than any room Dean had stayed in before. It was mostly empty; the closet filled with hunting gear and a selection of Bobby’s suits.
The skinny blonde dude stood on a low wall, and Dean knocked him off with a swift kick to the back of his knees. The guy yelped. Dropped to his hands and knees. But Dean was already gunning for his pal.
“Cas?” Dean stepped forward, eyes searching the angel’s own; wide and blue, slightly alarmed. But Cas was fine.
Cas nipped along Dean's jaw, working him slowly, firmly.
Rowena hissed as Ruby slumped to the ground.
Charlie was quiet for a moment. Then – “Aw, screw it.”
“Aw, come on, Sammy, that was nothing.”
Damn it. “Why not? Come on, man, I’m sure you could use an extra pair of hands.” He winked and by some miracle, he didn’t crack under his own innuendo. It was a good one, he thought. Shame they were always lost on the angel.
Dean pulled free from their embrace to look Cas in the eye. Vulnerability did not come easily to Dean Winchester, but it was clear to Cas that he fought through it now with the same tenacity as he’d fought every vicious and vengeful creature all his life. And when he spoke, Cas could not contain the surge of his power that caused every lightbulb for miles around to flicker.
This day had a purpose. A few extra steps along the way, or no – Dean was not supposed to be here. Cas was supposed to – to clear his head. To purge his thoughts of the hunter who took another swing at the stalker for luck, that left him unconscious and slumped against the wall.
They were interrupted by the sight of their waiter and this hot chick who’d been sat at the bar openly making out in front of everyone.
Cas nodded, his eyes so wide and so utterly, beautifully
It was so jarring, the image, that it pulled him out of the fantasy for a moment. Desperate to switch back, he thought of another day, another girl. But again, the image changed.
He wasn’t the type for hot showers, but Dean stood under the scalding spray. Letting it burn away the cold shame that crept on him. The horror that he knew,
Dean looked down at his feet as he pushed the door fully open.
Sam shot him a dry look, signing back, “I swear you guys do that on purpose.”
Dean’s back hit the bedroom wall, the force of the impact sending a lamp shattering to the floor. His belly lurched like he was going to be sick.
, the Empty whispered.
It was a small surprise to feel the shift in priorities, the depth of anguish, that varied from location to location. He’d been human himself once, yet even now the vastness of their vulnerability struck him with such force. His father had truly abandoned them all. These faithless children he’d made in his own image.
Dean dropped his gaze, staring daggers at his own hands.
Dean flinched as the drunk dude by the trashcan groaned in his sleep.
But it wasn’t. They were gonna have fun at this heist thing, damn it. And then he’d get to the bottom of whatever the hell was up with Cas. He’d never seen the guy so amped up. Dean had no idea what Cas did when he wasn’t around – had given it more thought than he could afford, if he was honest with himself – but he had a feeling it wasn’t beating up bad guys and saving stray cats from trees. Angels might be these unknowable beings or whatever, but Dean knew his best friend well enough to know when shit was up.
“Pretty one, isn’t he?” the cat said. There was a mocking tone to its voice that instantly chilled any warmth Castiel might have felt for the creature. He only glared in response.
And when not to push it. If Cas could do that for Dean, Dean sure as hell could do the same for him.
explain the strange new development in Dean's behavior all day.
want Dean? He was a fucking angel. He’d been with one or two women in all the years Dean had known him. Not that Dean’s game had been much better – another thing he refused to give much thought to.
Cas opened the curtain to find Dean leaning casually against the wall. Dressed again in his dirty clothes, flannel flung over one shoulder. Cas watched greedily as Dean wet his lips, beginning his inspection.
Charlie had bidden Cas goodbye early that morning. He’d been almost disappointed to see her awake at sunrise, having gotten word of her girlfriend’s return.
Castiel hated the cat.
Cas looked pissed now.
Dean slid into the front seat of the Impala, Cas only moments behind him in the passenger seat. Dean tugged the angel by the sleeve, hurrying him inside. He had no doubt those assholes were watching them on camera. If he and Cas had any luck on their side, they’ll have made it to the one blind spot in the Bunker they wouldn’t reach on foot without giving themselves away.
Cas nodded. “You don’t often make a habit of making your feelings known, Dean. But, yes, I stayed. Of course, I stayed.”
“They won’t,” Cas said, his voice firm. If it weren’t for Dean’s unexpected presence, he’d have succeeded by now. He told him as much. About the pendant, where they’d find it, and who he suspected had brought it into existence.
,” Sam drawled sarcastically.
Dean moved without thinking, fixing the tie that he most definitely did not choose to compliment Cas’ eyes. He had to hand it to himself, though. It was a perfect match. He fixed his friend’s blazer, smoothing down the collar. Like it was his job or some shit.
Charlie bit her nails, sharing a private look with Stevie. “It’s a long story.”
“You wann-“ Dean started before Sam cut him right off.
you to know I’m fighting this shit. That you’re worth the fight. You’ve always been worth the damn fight. And I know it’s stupid-“
If he could just accept it was his fault, he could move on.
you are that I - that I'm in love with. Cas, I’d love you in whether you were an angel, a human, hell, even a damn demon,” Dean ignored the pointed cough that sounded from Crowley’s direction. “I’m sorry it took me so long to say it. But I swear, I’ll tell you every day if that’s what makes you happy." He paused, savouring the look on Cas' face. Shit, Dean had never felt so weightless in years. So
The guys jeered and egged them on, but Sam walked away with his back straight and his head held high.
she’d touched him.
He could do it, Dean realised. Cas could kiss him right now and there was nothing getting in the way this time. There was no way in hell Dean could tell Cas what was going on in his head, but-
Pinning Dean to the wall – that, he did not regret. Dean was a brat. Lost in his delusions, drowning in his own anger. Cas knew Dean was not entirely at fault - had felt Dean’s remorse battling through the rage. But though Cas knew better than to give in, Dean’s words cut just as sharply. Especially those he left unsaid.
He reached for Cas’ phone, but… he should wait, right? This thing was too new. Shouldn’t he tell Sam first? He felt like shit for even thinking it, but Charlie would be easier. She’d done the whole coming out thing.
This is a long one, but a fun one, I hope! :)
“Look, you wouldn’t get it, alright? It’s not that simple,” Dean argued, trying real damn hard to keep his voice from cracking. Sammy had no damn idea what he was talking about.
“Don’t finish that sentence,” Sam curled his lip in disgust.
Over his shoulder, Sam flipped Dean off. “Don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, slamming the drawer shut and sitting on top of the desk to block it.
I love hearing what you guys think. :) See you on thursday for the next chapter.
Standing in front of the old brown brick building of the high school, Dean leaned against a pickup truck and checked his watch. Only another half hour until school was out for Halloween break. He took in the carved pumpkins that lined the front door of the school, the orange and black bunting that read “Happy Halloween 1993” above the door. Painted Styrofoam gravestones were scattered around the grass out front, and a large sign that read “Beware the Sanderson Sisters!” hung from a noose on a nearby tree. Dean blinked in surprise. This town really had a thing for Halloween, huh?
Cas cocked his head. "I believe you need lubrication if we were to-"
The small frown between Castiel’s brows smoothed out as he caught Dean’s eye. He blinked a little, like he just remembered who he was with. “Cats are fine,” he said, gruffly. “Fergus –
Cas felt his grace fade to cinders in his veins, his wings going limp at his sides. He struggled against the warding, but the angel trap was too strong.
He closed his eyes and at the feeling of Cas’ fingers running through his hair, Dean drifted.
As he spoke, Dean’s attention wandered over the guy’s form. He was tall - just about an inch shy of Dean. A little nerdy looking, but in the cute way; not the annoying know it all kind, like Sam. His hair was almost jet black; the soft strands swaying in the October breeze. He couldn’t be more than a year or two older than Dean. Definitely no older than twenty-two, Dean figured. He was all sharp cheek bones and innocent smiles, and these amazing lips that Dean could easily stare at all day long if it weren’t for those eyes. He’d never seen any that blue before.
, he thought, staring at the guy in the mirror who glared at him the same way his dad used to. He flipped himself off and forced himself out of the bathroom.
“I love you,” Cas whispered against his lips. “I love you,” he repeated, kissing Dean hard on the mouth.
God, if he'd put the moves on the guy even half the amount of times he'd thought of doing it..
Over half of them, Dean was amused to see, were in costume. Dedicated sons of bitches, he thought. One kid wearing a black garbage bag complete with green and black striped tights and a pointed hat was being chased by a huge guy dressed as Frankenstein’s monster.
“Lookin’ good,” Charlie finished, with more confidence than she felt. God, she was worried about the guy. She missed him. Dean was her best friend, and standing in front of him right now, she missed him more than ever. She swallowed that thought down. She could do this.
Cas watched in horror as Dean slipped on a pool of his own blood. The fall had cost him – Cas heard the hiss of pain as Dean's shoulder hit the ground. But Dean corrected his stance, just in time for the demon to get back on her feet.
Without so much as touching Dean, Rowena threw him across the room, his back hitting the glass cabinet in the corner. The sound of shattering glass was distant to him as Dean charged forward again. He vaulted over the side of the table, snatching the iron pillar that held the black flame candle. He swung it around, using the four-prong base to pin the witch to the table.
Before Cas could help it, he pressed two fingers to Dean’s forehead, deepening his sleep, curing the stiffness of his spine, and checking his temperature all at once. He was cold. Dean had been paler recently, too; now that he spent all his time indoors. Refusing even the shortest of drives in the Impala.
Dean was ready to tear that damn suit off with his teeth. But not here… He wanted Cas in his own room. In his own bed. Where he had all the supplies he needed to-
talk to someone?” Stevie deadpanned.
When he’d changed back into his old clothing, sans the bloody trench coat, he handed the new clothes back to Dean exactly how he’d found them. Dean nodded. A silent smile ghosted his lips as he noticed the still-made tie. Kept smiling while he moved through the shop to pay.
Dean nodded, smiling faintly through the nerves at the seriousness in Cas’ tone. He couldn't help but doubt sometimes, even now. He'd never been this happy, couldn't believe that it was real. “Cas, I… you have me. You’ve always had me. Sometimes it… it scares me, man, that I love you this much. You lost everything for me, rebelled and fell…”
