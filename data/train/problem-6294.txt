“Oh, come on! I’m not getting any younger over here! I want my turn,” Clint cried from down the line, behind Bruce and Thor, shaking the piggy bank in his arms vigorously.
“Well, kid’s a cutie and I thought it was about time for him to earn his keep,” Tony explained easily, shrugging his shoulders.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered once more as the car began to move.
Peter smiled, nodding his head before asking, “Can I have extra marshmallows in mine, Papa?”
Steve shook his head with a sigh, settling Peter on his hip, pressing a kiss to the tiny baby curls. “One day we’ll escape from this crazy bunch, bubba,” He murmured, pressing a kiss to one of  Peter’s rosy cheeks.
“What?!” Tony screeched, pulling away before pointing an accusing finger at his husband. “That’s tomorrow! You were supposed to pick him up today because I knew my board meeting was going to run late.”
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed and his grip tightened. “What do you mean, Tony? You were supposed to pick him up from school today!”
“Peter!” Steve shouted, easily outrunning his husband as he raced over to the bench.
“Ready to go back inside or does Charlie need a little more sun tanning?” Steve asks, tweaking his son’s nose gently.
“Charlie and I are doing great out, here. Right, Charlie?” Peter ruffles the dog’s fur with a wet hand, earning a whimper followed by a tongue lick on his cheek.
“Ba!” Peter exclaimed loudly, stuffing a fistful of Pepper’s hair into his mouth.
Steve smiled a little before lying down on the couch to sleep until his alarm would go off.
Tony hung it up on the wall opposite to the wall, where he already hung pictures of Rhodey and Pepper,  and a picture of Spiderman and Ironman that Peter drew as a joke after Tony said that he was like his son. Tony thought that that picture fit in just perfectly.
Steve lifted his shoulders of the mattress and put his weight on his elbows to support himself.
I was a little unsure about the end, because while I thought about how I wanted the two of them to get together the morning of the last chapter, I forgot to think how they would get to that point, so it seems a little sudden, but nonetheless I'm happy with how it turned out.
They had a date planned for that evening.
When they left it again they entered a room that was barely lit. In the middle was a tiny table with flowers in the middle and on smaller tables around that one were what looked like millions of candles.
But today they separated their ways after having breakfast together.
At least Bucky had already made coffee, so he just took his up out of the drying rack next to the sink, Steve must have cleaned it after they just let it stand in the kitchen that night, and filled the cup.
In the box was a simple, black picture frame with a photo in it. It showed Tony hanging over Steves shoulders, and Steve smiling a little at him. The two of them were in the hall in front of Steves room. Tonys face wasn’t visible, but he was sure that if it were, his eyes would be closed. After all, he was really tired when Steve carried him to his room.
Tony nodded sleepily. Steve got up and walked towards the kitchen. Tony closed his eyes, intending to rest a little bit more before starting the day. The room smelt nice, like the washing powder that was used to clean the sheets, a little bit like the coffee that was made in the kitchen and most of all like Steve. The scent made Tony feel like he was still asleep, almost like he could feel the sun even though the rays coming in hit the floor nowhere close to where he was laying.
The soldier was amazed. He let the small dog walk onto his hand, and moved his hand closer to his face to inspect the robot closer. The little guy wagged his tail and rolled over a few times. Steve laughed at that, before putting him down again.
giving Tony the picture -> giving gifts
A few words from me about this fanfiction:
The fog set on inspecting the table he was on, he ran around can in which Tony stored some screws a few times before rubbing his back against a hammer and sitting down. He looked between Tony and Steve, but doing nothing further. Steve laughed at him, while Tony looked at Steve proudly, not able to contain the proud grin that was plastered across his face.
That was why Steve just put Tony down in his own bed, putting a blanket over him and tucking him in.
Steve didn’t need much time, so luckily Tony didn’t fall asleep while he was gone. They had the same thing as yesterday, but Tony didn’t mind. It meant that Steve came back to the room quicker. He had a Tablet in his hands, held it out to Tony to let the other man take his coffee before putting it carefully down on the bed and getting his own cup. He sat down on the side that Tony slept on and put down his cup on the Nightstand, watching Tony inhaling the good smelling coffee. He smiled a bit.
Just when he was about to straighten the cushions on the couch he heard a pair of feet shuffling towards the kitchen, and shortly after the coffeemaker started. He heard plates and some packages being moved around and then someone sitting down.
“This is really nice”, he thought to himself.
He looked at Bucky, who just smirked at him, and decided that he didn’t want to stay in the same room has the other man.
Steve pulled back one of the chairs and helped Tony to sit down before sitting down in the other. Still smiling.
Like that, time went past quickly. Before he knew, it was evening again. He only noticed how late it already was when Steve knocked on glass door to the lab. Tony let him in and the two men smiled at each other for a few seconds.
Steve tried the same, and he was a little bit more lucky. Tony was easy to read. He always had bags under his eyes. Sometimes there where stains from all the time he spends in his workshop on his cheeks and his hair somehow looked wild and elegant at the same time. At that moment Steve could see how Tony was thinking, the skin between his eyebrows was wrinkled and sometimes his fingers twitched a bit.
Tony seemed to think about it for a while.
Tony tried to find out what Steve was thinking, what this whole situation meant, what Steve wanted to do next, but nothing. He looked like he always looked. His eyes where kind, unafraid and always a little bit like someone just challenged him.
Even later in the evening they moved to Steves room. The latter offered to carry Tony again, but he refused, he had to be more tired to let himself be carried.
“Tony, I like you and I would like to be with you if that’s something you want. Is that short enough for you mister unable-to-talk-about-feelings-unless-so-tired-that-every-second-word-is-a-yawn?”
Steve laughed at that. He moved even closer to Tony, their knees touching know, and leaned a little closer to his face. “If you want to, you can kiss me.”, he whispered.
Tony had no idea what could be in there, he never got anything from Steve except from normal Birthday or Christmas gifts, that never where anything special or personal.
The late hour was probably the reason he didn’t hear Steve come in. The Soldier usually went to bed at a reasonable hour, he had just woken up after a bad dream and wanted to get himself some water. He thought about going for a short run, but that seemed stupid in the middle of the night.
“You don’t have to keep me company.”, Tony said between two spoons.
(See the end of the chapter for
He made his way to the kitchen to say hello to Tony, but when he entered the engineer had his had on his arms on the table and didn’t seem very awake. He didn’t even get up when the coffeemaker finished.
Slowly he peeled the blankets of himself, blushing a little when he remembered how Steve had tucked him in.
Tony didn’t move for a few minutes, he just looked at Steve, enjoying how peaceful the moment was.
Then Tony, started to twirl an end of the blanket next to him between his fingers, the ruffling o fabric against fabric was louder than it should have been, almost filling the whole room. Tonys took his eyes of Steve and fixated his gaze on his hands.
They would have kept going, but at one point Steves stomach growled. Tony was a little disappointed when they went to the elevator, he would have loved to show Steve even more of the stuff he build, but he couldn’t deny that he was hungry too.
Once again, Tony woke up in Steves bed. The evening before had been nice. After dinner they watched a movie together, and Steve fell asleep before the action even started.
All Tony could get out was a quiet “uuugh”, before leaning back until he could feel the counter behind him and burying his face in his hands.
“We could spend the day together. Go to the gym or watch movies or something like that.”, Steve tried.
Steve had to do some paperwork and Tony went to spent time in the workshop.
It said.
It had been years since this happened. He was a genius, he thought to himself, he could write a little bit of code without major mistakes. Especially when it came to stuff like this. He had done it time and time again, he really shouldn’t have such problems.
Tony was in a good mood that day. He finished his present for Peter, the fault in the code turned out to be a well hidden typo, not a major mistake in the Algorithm like it seemed a few days earlier, so Tony got the dog to work quickly. He then moved on to some SI stuff, nothing major, just a few bits here and there that he wanted to work on. His next deadlines were far away, so he allowed himself to work on the things he enjoyed most.
“But what about our children, what am I going to tell them?”
Nobody knew about their relationship, and he wanted it to stay that way.
Tony swayed a little back and forth, still not processing that he wasn’t in the kitchen alone anymore. He narrowed his eyes while looking at Steve, trying to figure out what to say, and how to gain control over his mouth back.
He didn’t think it would take much time, he spend a lot of time coding and would consider himself an expert on that topic, but in this case he just couldn’t find his mistake.
Steve shifted his weight a little, sitting a little closer to the middle of the bed, facing Tony and crossing his legs in front of him. Tony copied him, apart from the creaking of the bed it was silent.
Most of the time they slept in Steves room.
Tony snorted at that, but didn’t say anything.
They ate in silence, Tony still to tired and Steve enjoying his food to much to say anything.
After they finished eating, Steve got up to put their plates away and to sore the food back in the fridge. Tony made himself a new cup of coffee, earning a playful glance from Steve.
When they moved to the couch after dinner, Tony had nothing more to say, but he was happy. It had been a long time till someone listened to him talk about his projects with such an excitement as Steve had shown that evening. It made Tony incredibly proud, and he caught himself grinning at Steve the whole time.
At first they sat down on the bed and continued to watch their movies, but it wasn’t long until Tony fell asleep again. His body curled around a pillow he was holding and he already had a small blanket draped over himself.
Steve didn’t open his eyes immediately. First he rolled from his side to his back, them he stretched his arms. Tony could hear his shoulders crack and the bed made a distressed noise. He looked towards the window and blinked a few times, then began to smile. Tony smiled too. Steve was a beautiful sight.
After the kitchen he moved on to the dining area. It was rarely used. Most of them just ate at the small table in the kitchen. Only on Saturday evenings, when Peter was there, they all got together at the big table. He straightened the decoration on the side table and he pushed all the chairs under the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
The longer Steve waited, the bigger Tonys doubts grew. And Steve could tell. He saw how Tonys hopeful smile fell a bit and he frowned a little, only noticeable because Steve was watching him so closely.
Steve wanted to make it romantic.
Steve didn’t allow himself to be discouraged by Tonys reaction.
He wanted to order food and made the room look pretty, like a real candlelight dinner.
The two of stood up from the bed and made their way towards the kitchen next to each other. They didn’t talk.
He excused himself and made his way to his workshop.
Steve turned to Tony and smiled back, before asking what else Tony was up to all day. Tony beamed at him before walking further into the lab. Steve put one hand on Tonys back and followed him.
FRIDAY must have taken it, and Steve must have liked that picture enough to want Tony to have it too.
“To: Tony
Also the original plan was that the timesoan of this story is longer than it is, but it just fit together like this, so that's what I did.
That morning Tony woke up early. He was in Steves room again, but this time he wasn’t alone. Steve was sitting on the bed next to him, his legs crossed and a book in his lap.
I just noticed that no one ever brushes their teeths in fanfictoin like this, I'm not sure what to do with this information.
They didn’t want to go out.
“Will you eat breakfast before you leave? If we team up we can make something relatively quick, who knows when you’re going to have the opportunity to eat after you leave. And you already went on the mission and everyone came back in one piece, so it can’t be that urgent.”
The movement seemed to make Steve nervous. His eyes flickered between Tonys face and his hands a few times before taking them in his own.
He really could get used to this.
After the movie finished, Tony stayed sitting on the couch, watching Steve for a while. But he didn’t want to sleep on the couch, and he didn’t want to let Steve asleep there, and he definitely couldn’t carry Steve himself. So he had no choice but to wake Steve up.
There’s no robberies, no muggings on the street. The most Peter could do was pulling a puppy from the streets right when it was about to be run over by a truck. After handing the puppy back to the woman it belongs to, he once again gets a few dollar bills pushed into his hands.
In between the blows, Yaël managed to open the door.
So, Yaël told him what she had seen at night. She didn’t know how much she told him afterwards, because somewhere during her own words, she fell asleep and that’s when Steve finally started driving. Sometime later, when Steve carried her off the motorcycle, she woke up and started rattling again.
“Mr. Lyman! Is there anything you want to share, young man?” the teacher suddenly asks. Harry stops, pulling the comic away and sitting up straight at his seat.
By the time the bosses are out of the large room, the people, too, start standing up to get out. An evening in Switzerland sounds about good, especially during dinner time. Peter wonders if he can convince Tony to take him to a chocolate bar, but knowing all the others they’ll just get a frown in return.
“Oh, you want to have a honeymoon without the wedding?” Tony jokes. “Sure, we can arrange that. I’m sure Pepper wouldn’t mind me leaving the company for a few days.”
She laid down on the fluffy rug with her cello and started tuning on the strings. After she fiddled with the instrument for a while, she got up and got a book and a blanket and installed herself in her sofa.
“Mary knew about Peter being bitten by the spider? But how?” the woman asks in confusion. Before Tony can speak up, there’s a knock on the door, followed by Bruce entering the room with someone behind him.
“Stay calm! It’s only a spike, it’ll soon stabilize!” Otto shouts, holding up a hand to stop everybody. People start muttering in fear, clearly unsettled about it. The crowd takes their steps back, distancing themselves from the source of the panic. An alarm starts ringing right when metal plates are being pulled from the wall.
Peter rolls his eyes. “If we have to wait for Steve, you better start calling him up right away.”
“Barnes is… out of commission for now,” Sam admits. “His choice was to be put back under cryo until there’s a way to fix his brain.”
“Anybody needs help?” she asks with gritted teeth. It’s obvious to Peter that she’s still hurt from her fall off the tower.
There’s a fist in his face. Tony accidentally bites his tongue in the progress, tasting blood in his mouth. With a grunt, he falls down on his knees. There are spots dancing in front of his eyes, so he waits until they disappear before he gets back on his feet.
“Steve…” Tony can’t continue, feeling his throat suddenly hurting before he can say anything more.
Peter isn’t exactly sure how the process went from designing these things they’ve made for him to the point where they actually performed surgery to implant them inside his head, but he’s not about to complain too much about it.
“Eh, are you speaking of Death as a person now?”
Natasha then lets out a soft laugh, and she gently puts a hand on his shoulder in comfort. She squeezes him with all the tenderness he never really saw in her, and suddenly understands why Cap calls her a good friend.
“It’s alright, I can handle it Bruciebear,” Tony says, gently slapping him on the shoulder. “Let’s go!”
When Peter takes another blow Natasha stops for a moment, giving him a frown.
There doesn’t seem to be an answer. Tony tries again, knocking a bit louder this time. His heart jumps when lights suddenly turn on from the inside. There’s the sound of a key turning in a lock before the door opens slightly.
“Hmmm, you have no idea how much I love that,” Tony whispers against his mouth. Steve grins through the kiss.
And Steve had sputtered and had felt his cheeks redden instantly.
“Can’t you just get it tomorrow, babe? I thought we were going to see a movie?”
Johnny greets awkwardly. Unimpressed, Tony gives him a silent look while he waits for him to continue. “
Merry Christmas to you all, I'll be spending it chowing down my antibiotics and painkillers, seeing as I went to the doctor's today :')
Yaël saw how abruptly his movements stopped again.
“CAAAAAAP!” Wade calls out, throwing his arms around Steve’s waist, with that slightly pushing Tony aside. As Deadpool starts hanging on Steve almost literally, Tony notices the amused look on Steve’s face.
And that just does it now, doesn’t it? Because Peter can get detention, and he can walk away from it. But right now, Tony realizes that his son has been
“I suggest you bring in some more interns, for starters. A couple of young, innovative minds, a few extra hands along with it. See what they can figure out.”
“You need to identify yourself, genius,” Gwen jokes, walking forward and pressing her wrist against some sort of screen. Then there’s a beeping sound, and the door finally open.
“Thanks,” Peter says, grateful that she corrected that part. Then after another nod, Peter runs away through the crowd, making his way to the entrance of Stark tower. He’s probably the only one getting inside, while everybody’s running out to check and see what’s going on in the streets. Slightly out of breath and feeling like he’s about ready to just fall down, Peter runs towards the reception, where he’s not surprised to see this
A Christmas Meeting: On the Christmas Party, May Parker meets a certain Colonel.
After that, the guy leaves again, suddenly noticing somebody else behind Peter. After a snort and an eye-roll, Peter heads out with his bag over his shoulder. He steps a bit further away until he gets to a little alleyway. There, he quickly grabs his red-and-blue suit and changes clothes. Stuffing his normal wardrobe back into the bag, he hides the thing away
“MJ, get out of here!” Peter shouts.
“You don’t get it, Tony,” Wanda then says. “He was like a cat, and that man was the mouse. He wasn’t just going to kill him. He wanted to make him suffer some more before doing it. Make him pay for all the agony he’s brought to him and his Aunt.”
“It was your stupid idea to pretend we’re happy, Tony! You didn’t want to smudge your name with a divorce!”
“He’s hit a rough spot,” Tony explains. “Learned the hard way that alcohol and antidepressants don’t go together. Before that, he was doing good.”
“Since yesterday. It’s a long story I’ll eventually tell,” he returns. Steve nods before turning back to Tony.
They try conversation. It only ends up with Mr. Toomes realizing who he is, and him getting a speech about staying out of his way. What the man doesn’t realize is Peter dropping his personal cellphone on the floor right before leaving the car.
It’s Peter and Gwen. It must have been winter, since they’re both wearing bonnets. Peter is smiling at the camera, without the ghosts in his eyes. Without the trouble Tony keeps on seeing in him when he looks at him. Peter is happy, with Gwen’s hand on his one cheek and her lips against his other.
“Have fun,” Tony mutters, eyes stuck on his tablet. How does he even have internet connection right here?
“You know what?” Harry starts. “You got some kick-ass weapons. How about you head towards MJ and make sure she doesn’t get herself killed?”
Before the next blow comes, a high-pitched sound fills the room. Eddie starts shouting, pressing his hands against his ears while taking a few steps back in his struggle to fight against the sound. Peter can see the suit jumping up, fighting to stay attached to Eddie despite the loud noises.
Steve. But he has trouble accepting the fact that he now has a part of Steve’s
Typical Rhodey, no greeting, just getting into business immediately.
“I’m here to see the king,” Steve explains when he gets a pair of raised eyebrows from the women. Their eyes are hypnotizing in a way. It’s wonderful that T’Challa has such faithful and skilled people behind him.
“I don’t think it’s that easy, Johnny,” Reed starts, but Johnny shakes his head before standing up as well.
? What is she on about? Steve, too, looks surprised, though clearly not for the same reason Peter is. “Oh yeah, apparently I’m an alien from outer space. Who knew, right?”
“So, what are you proposing?” Steve asks, and Tony clears his throat before grabbing Steve’s hands.
“Perhaps, yeah. We could take Peter along? Make it a little holiday?” Tony suggests. Steve shrugs.
“It looks like we had quite the battle just now! Let’s just see who, in fact, was the best here according to you guys.”
“Steve, I don’t even know
“Tony?” the man asks. And shit, that voice sounds familiar. Too familiar. Tony’s breath shakes, and his first instinct is to put his hand on his scar, which he keeps himself from doing. Even before Steve can turn around to face him, Tony takes a few steps backwards. He can’t do this, he’s not ready to see him. Not yet.
“How much did you drink?”
Sharon reaches up her hand until it’s covering Tony’s. Her friendly, brown eyes give him a sympathetic look.
As it turns out, even Mr. Stark has gotten curious as to what the ruckus has been outside of his tower. Still neatly in the suit (not the Iron Man suit, though), the billionaire starts walking towards the exits until he sees Peter standing there, looking the way he does with cuts and bruises all over his face.
He recognizes the name, too. Once, when they were very small, Harry used to tell him the stories about his mother. They were nothing extraordinary, really, but he can remember her being mentioned a lot. Emily Lyman. Once, before he started idolizing his father and
“I know, but we have a deal, remember? We talk to each other, because we love each other.”
, she thought while helped her right before pulling her out of bed, hoping X would catch her mind.
Peter thinks back on Yaël, the day that Wade brought her to the compound, appearing broken and lost. As he explained it, Wade accidentally blew her place up, throwing the girl out of the building due to the explosion. She hadn’t been found until late in the evening the day afterwards, and she’s been living at the compound ever since.
“… you don’t
“Rhodey’s out for the time being. Vision looked it over but didn’t add anything.”
“Will do, see you soon.”
They play games, watch some awful movies for children, and even go and take a walk in the park when FRIDAY suggests it might be good for Peter to get some fresh air. Today, Peter is wearing his newest Spider-Man onesie.
He doesn’t know how late it is in Wakanda. There’s a few hours difference between them, but Peter has no idea how much. He’s never looked it up, mostly he just calls and Steve just answers.
“Spare me. I hate saying this, but I think you might have been the only one to agree with me about it all,” Tony admits. He pulls off his sunglasses and crosses his arms together to look at Fury, finding one serious, dark eye looking back at him. “Why
Peter feels sick once Sunday arrives. It’s almost like he’s ready to just throw up on the spot, and nothing really gets done. Aunt May even comes up to his room to take his temperature, but finds that nothing’s really wrong with him. It’s all just in his head because today is
“What do you mean?”
“FRI, I know you might have missed me, but I need you to try and rebuild your connection with the nanites,” Tony says the moment he gets into the penthouse. There’s no answer, though. Instantly, Tony fears somebody might have hacked her.
It’s a small relief when the gun suddenly flies past him. It means he won’t be shot at anymore. But, distracted as he is, he lands against a stone mailbox. With it breaking from the impact, Peter can’t help but let go of his webs. He sees the car drive away, and an attempt to stick himself to the other door fails when it breaks.
Right now, though… this is the exact opposite of smart.
“Before he starts to think he’s in this alone,” Steve corrects him. “Take these books, get to his room. Read them next to him, maybe he can explain some things as well.”
“Is this Asgardian?” Yaël whispered to Brunnhilde, who already started eating.
“And what do you think about Steve?” Peter already knew those two were kind of together, right? He looked at her doubtfully, probably asking himself the same question about her.
There was a bottle of vodka in her closet and some beer in her fridge and they were luring her. Yaël was very sure that it was the fault of the booze, they were calling her somehow. But she knew it was unhealthy to drink when she wasn’t feeling well, she wasn’t supposed to drink just to make herself feel better. Trying to distract herself, she focused on the people who were walking past the building.
“No way,” he mutters, too shocked by the revelation. He doesn’t let go of his painful grip, instead staring unbelievingly at the man in front of him. Seeing the guy’s eyes, he remembers the guy had been wearing sunglasses that evening. Peter never got to see the green color in them.
He isn’t lying when he says that he’s on his way to the tower to hang out with Tony for a bit. He’s saying the truth, but he’s just not mentioning that he’s doing a few more stops on the way. So he gets off the train a few stops too soon, goes to buy his stuff at Delmar’s Deli-Grocery, hurries himself into a small alley, and gets out of his clothes.
“Indeed, it does,” she confirms.
Tony found out about this place mostly by surprise. When he looked up stuff that had to do with the forties, he stumbled across a website of a small organization that hosts small dance parties dedicated to certain era’s. Every Monday it’s the forties, which is why Tony has dragged Steve all the way here.
Steve gave no answer, and there was a short silence, which Tony filled with a soft cough. “
Once inside, he finds a lot of other people, as well. The teachers, to be exact. While Storm greets him with a smile, and Jean shakes his hand shortly, there’s also Scott who just nods stiffly, followed by Logan who just plainly ignores him.
“Yeah, sure, take a seat,” Yaël invited the teen as she gestured to her almost empty classroom. Dust, who apparently still, or again had a misunderstanding with her roommate Surge, sat down on a chair out of Surge’s reach and started reading.
“You’re lucky, Stark, that I pledged to
"Yes, I'm sorry you had to hear that. Even good friends fight sometimes."
As Mr. Stark gives him instructions on where to go, Peter finds himself recognizing the place already. Getting himself Upstate, Peter drives up onto a road surrounded by trees. After what must be about twenty minutes of careful driving, Peter parks the car in front of the familiar Facility he’s come to know as the Avenger’s headquarters.
“Eh, sorry, no. I knew it was a long-shot, but I figured I could at least try,” Peter says then. He puts his hands in his pockets and then looks down to the ground where he can see himself twitching on his feet.
Fury just stares at him, and so does Steve.
small, he thinks Natasha might have loved him, too.
Happy takes a step aside when the nurse finally comes inside to check on his vitals. A quick control on the bag that collects his gastric fluids, she notes on a piece of paper how much has been taken in. Then she checks his temperature, heartrate and blood pressure. Satisfied with the results, she asks if he needs anything more (he shakes his head) and then wishes him good night.
“Hmm, doesn’t sound too bad,” Johnny breathes out, resting his head back and smiling. Meanwhile, Tony marches up to them, putting his hands on his hips while he looks at the teenagers (most of them, at least) around him.
Clint sleeps. There’s nothing much to add about that. He gets into the workshop, suggests that, if Tony wants to get drunk he’ll join him, and then lies down on the couch and takes a nap, telling Tony to wake him up if he needs him.
“I agree,” Johnny says. “They just want to put us on a leash.”
“Yes, the lawyers finished up the paperwork only yesterday. I’m now officially Tony Stark’s son,” he answers.
“So, I kind of learned that my father is not my father, and I have a suspicion that I might know who
“You know, before I met Tony-“ he starts. Then somebody flushes the toilet, and Happy’s smile falls away from his face, shoulders suddenly tense. To make it even worse, the kid starts slowly washing his hands, not bothering to hurry despite Happy staring at him. When he finally leaves, Peter lets out a breath.
Eddie is still talking to Flash, probably painfully sober in comparison to the others. Peter takes a short step forward to get in between them, but almost falls over the moment he stands still.
Peter almost chokes on his soup.
Ah, well, as normal as it could be in this crazy family.
“No, I didn’t. Look, Tony, it was an emergency. Her apartment exploded, she could’ve been dead! It took Wade hours to find her and if he didn’t she-”
Peter turns around until his back is facing her. On the corner of his visor he sees that it’s almost two in the afternoon. He should head home to get ready for the demonstration of Dr. Octavius’ project.
big a deal?” Clint gets up from his seat, his hands balled into fists. “You talked about your sex-life
Michelle’s face then falls, but only lightly. Then she takes a step back, and holds her hands up.
Steve never manages. The guards are around him almost 24/7, keeping an eye on him. T’Challa admits that he doesn’t like having Steve watched like that, but that he feels it’s necessary. Clint and Scott agree. Sam argues with him, but it leads to nothing. Bucky tries to stay out of it to let Wanda help him during their sessions.
Beyond happy, Aunt May gives Peter her ‘
“Let’s just agree to be better friends to each other, huh?” she said to him. Peter nodded, and they even shook hands to that.
“Sure, yes, thank you Katie,” Tony says, and only then does he move away from the window, pointing towards the chair in front of his desk right before sitting down himself. “Please sit, Mr. …” Tony can almost curse. He doesn’t even know the kid’s name yet.
“Hey Goblin!” Peter calls out, feeling a tug in his chest when he remembers once again that it’s Harry hovering there on that glider. When Harry turns his face around, Peter shoots a few webs into his eyes. It’s a simple distraction, but it’s a welcome one apparently. Harry immediately reaches for his eyes and never sees War Machine coming when the soldier slams against him – throwing him off the glider. Rhodey holds him up by his arm and throws him back on the roof, his rockets hitting the glider hard just for good measure.
job, or an
“You come out of that accident too?!” The lobbyist noticed her as soon as she walked into the modern-looking building.
By the second of July, the Avengers head out again. This time, it’s to Lagos. Once again, Rhodey and Vision stay at home, though this time it’s mostly because Rhodey is joining Tony to the presentation, and Vision stays at the compound to guard the place (and keep an eye on Yaël, since everybody seems to be intent on making sure she doesn’t blow anything up). There’s radio silence from them, though neither Tony nor Peter can really think about it. The seventh is the day of the presentation. With Aunt May, Peter, Tony
What he sees in front of him is a representation of himself crying as a robot that doesn’t even remotely look like Dum-E works around him. There’s some stupid jokes written around them, but Peter doesn’t bother to read them, instead folding it up into a little ball and throwing it into the trash can with perfect precision.
“Tony, you’re up?” Steve asks when he sees Tony standing there, wearing his dark tee and grey sweatpants, bare feet on the cold floor. Cap, in turn, is still in his uniform. There’s no obvious blood on him, just dirt and a few scrapes. Tony walks towards him without saying anything, but after two steps he stops himself.
This is an opportunity to do things right, this time.
- Peter being stupid
“Excuse me, miss, do you have an appointment?” the lobbyist asked as she walked passed him.
“I knew where I was needed,” Tony says. It’s all a part of the accords, after all. He did kind of break the rules by showing up as Iron Man, but he only had about five minutes before things would have gotten horribly wrong. “So what’s the status?”
“Crap!” Peter shouts. Quickly he scrambles towards to front seat, leaning to the left to grab the steering wheel in an attempt to avoid driving people over.
Just as she said, after twenty minutes Steve was finding himself giving introductions to a girl probably one or two years younger than him – biologically, that is, since Steve’s in fact in his nineties to be exact… The girl had been pretty, kind, giving him kind of a Latina vibe with her dark eyes and dark, straight hair. She told him to call her Steph, and they hit it off well enough.
“And I wanted you to be better,” Tony responds. Then he shakes his head; better to break the bad news. “The big people aren’t happy. There are consequences, both for you and me.”
When it’s clear that there’s no way for them to get through, neither of them need to speak for Peter to know what he needs to do. Peter puts a few webs on his legs against the cycle to make sure he stays on it, and then he shoots up on a few buildings, pulling themselves upwards with the vehicle included. His muscles burn from the heaviness, but it works when they practically fly above all the people without slowing down.
He’s happy. What more can he even dare ask for?
FRIDAY then says. Peter shakes his head.
“But Steve, Strange told me he needs Wanda to defeat the guy, and- wait, do you have an extra comm link? Maybe it’s better for him if he can join in on the conversation and-“
A small ‘oof’ escapes his mouth when he’s thrown on the couch. Steve then leans over him, lips only millimeters apart from each other. The two men are smirking, only vaguely aware that Peter is sleeping in the room a bit further away. They can’t make too much noise.
And this is it, isn’t it? Mary, who finally seems to believe him, studies him really hard. There’s this unreadable expression on her face that he can’t quite place. It’s weird how fifteen years apart can put them so out of sync.
There’s no answer in his mind now. All he can do is imagine Gwen standing there, looking at him with sadness and pity. It’s not a look he wants to receive, but in the end it’s his
“I never lied, Tony. Never to you, I promise,” Steve says. He takes Tony’s hand and pulls it away from the scar. Tony blinks a few times, staring at the place where Steve is touching him. He should pull back. He needs to step back.
“Dinner break is already over. You lost your chance for a break,” Michelle returns. Peter sighs and rolls his eyes up to the ceiling.
“Oh, that’s awkward,” she states, ducking once and grabbing Peter by the arms to turn him around. With a trained movement he escapes out of that struggle, bringing some space between the two of them. “And now what?”
“So many things have happened today!” she calls out in excitement. “First Steve came to visit, and now my dear Anthony has a son? I couldn’t be happier.”
“On lockdown, which
?” Bruce asks. Peter and Tony turn to look at him and Bruce leans back in his seat. “Wow, that’s just, two pairs of the exact same eyes looking at me right now. This is so weird. Are you sure you didn’t just clone yourself? Is this what you used to look like?”
“So this is the thing we were looking for?” Harry asks. Peter nods.
He could really use a talk with Steve now, a way to pull him back into reality. Somebody to tell him that it’s going to be alright. But Steve isn’t here, he’s in prison. Locked up because he wanted to help Tony, to save his life.
“It will, eventually,” Steve returns, pressing his lips once more on Tony’s skin. Tony throws his head back, realizing fully that Steve is all too aware of Tony’s sensitive chest. “Is it getting too hard for you?”
By the time class is finished, Peter lets out a sigh and picks up his detention slip he got from Mrs. Cooper earlier. He says goodbye to Ned after they exchange numbers, and then he starts making his way to the detention hall, where he suddenly hears some commotion happening.
sorry.”
“Is there a problem with your throat, sir? Do you need anything?”
“What?” Tony asks.
“Yes, well, a water would be great, thank you.” Steve must be thirsty after that fight in the park, so Yaël searched for the biggest glass she had, opened the tap and let the water flow into the glass. “Yaël, do you even know how long you were gone?”
“Right, sorry,” Johnny admits. When his eyes meet Peter’s for a while, he wiggles his eyebrows while nodding towards MJ.
Without thinking much more about it, he starts to make his way back to that alley. Seeing as he’s done quite a distance with Cap’s bicycle, it’s a bit further away than he would have liked. That means that he’s going to have to walk all the way back.
“You know,” the professor pulled her from her thoughts, “You can still become a teacher and become a part of our team.” It wasn’t the first time he proposed this to her, but something held her back.
Peter was very persuasive. He won; he had brought her outside. And even though it was a warm day, as warm as January could get, and Yaël could feel the rays of the sun touching her through her thick sweater, she needed some time to warm back up. It felt like the cold got stuck in her bones. Peter noticed, so he grabbed his sweater out of his backpack and handed it to Yaël. She replied with another sneeze and a muffled “Thank you…” as she cleaned her nose. When she was done, she threw him a wide smile.
There are some more tests over the next few days. The doctors are quick in realizing his new liver is fast in stabilizing itself again. As a regenerating organ, one would expect it to take a while for it to get to a good size that would be considered normal. As it is, it’s only after three days that they come up with the CT that shows him a picture of a seemingly three-month-old transplanted liver.
- mentions of the latest Goblin-fight
“I’m Anthony McGee from the Daily Bugle, is it possible for me to ask you some questions, sir?”
“Oh, I don’t know his names. I only got to meet his contacts. He’s much about keeping a low profile and all,” she explains. “But he’s Russian, that I can tell you.”
“There’s something on your mind,” Yaël noticed. Oh, did she just say that out loud? Maybe she shouldn’t have said that, she didn’t want to break into the guy’s privacy. She saw Peter turn a bit in his seat, he looked so extremely uncomfortable that Yaël wanted to tell him he could ignore her statement, but he answered instead.
“Steve Rogers, I know It’s been so long. I know you probably thought it wouldn’t happen anymore. But I love you. And you love me. We’re two old people who love each other, grey and wrinkled and-“
Gaze still lowered, Tony chuckles out dryly.
“Welcome back, Spider-Man,” Wanda greets him with a small kiss on his cheek. He notices how Vision stares at the act in confusion.
young – girl sitting there with her bright blue hair stuffed into a messy bun. Her skin is a bit darkened and there seem to be dark shadows under her hollow eyes. Her stare seems to travel from Peter to the guy, and her mouth is moving. Peter tries not to listen to it, instead turning around again to escape their gaze.
Tony’s not going to fool himself, he can’t be sure this is the girl Peter will one day decide to marry. He’s not exactly the luckiest with the ladies. At first, when the relationship with MJ had broken up, Tony had been waiting for the two to figure their shit out and get back together. When it later then turned out MJ moved on with a certain
“Heck no, I’m not a goddess!” Yaël mumbled while trying to give the cloak back, but the woman put her hands against her back and shook her head with a sweet smile.
“Don’t you dare to cry, Charles!” Yaël’s voice skipped as she fought to hold her tears back. Once more the professor took her hands to stop her from scratching herself.
Steve sighs again. Tony cups Steve’s cheek and makes him look up.
They stay in silence for a while, just enjoying their closeness, the touch. The feeling of each other. But after a while, Tony takes a deep breath, lifting up his head and opening his mouth.
“Come on, guys, stop being gross!” Peter complains. “Dad, just start the damn machine!” The suit throws a punch Hope’s way, but she avoids it easily enough. Turning herself small again, she rushes towards him and forces him on his feet as well. That smallest of punch hurts the hardest, Peter realizes as he smashes back against a couple of computers.
“Yeah, yeah, stop whining. I’m just free from training Peter, so I already had to listen to him for a whole session.” This time it was Yaël who cocked her eyebrow.
“No, no, you go do your thing. I’ll be here, or maybe we’ll go back to the compound? It’s about time we finish that suit, isn’t it?”
“What? No way, how?” Peter almost jumps up from his seat as she speaks. “Rhodey, do you know anything about this?”
“What, did somebody step on your toes, Wolfie?” Tony asks jokingly. Logan turns around, throwing him a wicked grin that makes Tony realize he should probably have kept his mouth shut. But, ah, he’s always known for running his mouth. It’s a talent, he supposes.
He can do this. His dad needs him. And even, just shortly, he’ll get to see Steve again.
“Can I finally go to the toilet?”
Dr. Thatch nods before dropping her pencil down. She takes her glasses off, and leans forward a bit.
“You can always try and take that tablet from Tony if you want to read up on it,” Steve offers. Peter ponders about that for a moment before shaking his head.
Yet, it’s still a thing Steve thinks about. Especially now, looking down at Tony, both of them breathless. Tony’s hands are digging into his sides, brown eyes glued into his. Steve knows the man’s heart is racing, just like his own is as well.
A knock on the door makes him look up. He rubs his eyes dry, sniffs his nose and jumps up from the bed.
The next morning, Yaël got a call from Diego with the message that if she didn't show up today, she'd be fired. In compensation, she worked a lot of extra hours in the following few days. On Friday, when she finally got home, she took a shower and put her pajamas on along with her fluffy socks. Once seated on the couch she received a text from Wade. A bit ashamed for not texting him earlier, due to her long working days, she opened it.
Yaël heard the automatic door behind her open. In a reflex, she stopped aiming one of her two hands from aiming at the scenery in front of her. Instead, she aimed one at whoever was walking in while the other one kept steering fire to the arena. Her heart was beating fast. If someone caught her right now, she’d be in deep trouble. Yet, she wasn’t going to stop with what she was doing; she wasn’t going to leave this hellhole of a planet before she was done.
It takes a while before Peter remembers he shouldn’t be doing this. He pulls away so quickly that it startles Johnny, who looks confused all of a sudden. The two of them stare at each other for a few seconds. Peter shakes his head.
“Mom changed the DNA,” he slurs out, barely understandable. “She- she changed the- the…”
“Good,” she could hear the man yawn through the phone.
And back in that universe, he hadn’t been Iron Man. There hadn’t been any word of him, just his weapons. That version of him hadn’t seen what Tony has seen.
Charles voice sounded way too loud, like it was the last drip that didn’t fit in her head anymore.
“Oh, no,” he hears Steve breathe out behind him. Then the shield falls down on the ground, and footsteps are nearing Tony. But Tony’s tears don’t stop even as Steve wraps his arms around both of them, too.
“Look, it’s not like I’m part of the team anyway. I don’t have to sign
“I mean, you looked like a drunk man, calling out for your hammer.” Jane points at Mjölnir, hanging on Thor’s belt. “But you took the time to teach me things that people thought me crazy for. You opened up my world, gave me explanations for things I couldn’t explain. And with each word that you used to feed my brain, my heart slowly fell harder and harder.
That’s his plan; after finding out that there’s a certain pizza-place that has been there even before the second world war, he immediately read up an article about it where the owner from back then proudly said that the one and only Captain America used to be a regular customer before being called to war. Tony put two and two together, and decided they don’t
Steve puts his finger on Tony’s lips to shut him up.
“So,” Tony one day started while sipping on a glass of water Steve had brought him. “You think we should be making some ground rules about ‘no relationships’ between the members of the team? Or you think those two can keep it professional?”
“I can ask if she wants to come, but it would be hard since she’s currently out of the country. Something about a dude called ‘Crossbones’?” Peter explains.
It’s not bad at all; it’s larger than his room at home, which is one thing. There seems to be a door leading to a private bathroom, a television screen hanging up on the wall, and lights that can be dimmed to whichever intensity he wants. Tony really didn’t spare any expense on this!
Tony wants to nod, to say yes. But he doesn’t know if he can do that.
Tony returns on the other side. Peter stiffens a bit.
Happy Easter!
Peter starts running towards a street light. He needs to be on higher ground.
“Demi, I think,” Peter mutters. Petra smiles and reaches out her hand to put on his, giving him a reassuring squeeze in the fingers.
“You’re sending mixed signals here.” Wade smirked.
He’s even less inclined to speak up on the days Mr. Stark isn’t feeling too well. Today is one of those days.
“Oh I’m not?” Tony asks, lifting an eyebrow. “Well, then I suppose that’s it. The end of the company. Let’s all go home, it’s over.” Tony starts getting up, noticing the even stronger glare Pepper’s throwing at him.
But it feels too good. Because Steve is here, and he should just forget about everything and just take him into his arms, because who cares? Who cares if they’ve been fighting? They’ve fought before, and they’ve gotten over it.
Having left his old suit in his locker the other day, Peter hurries to it, quickly changes in the bathroom. He leaves the tux there.
He’s the reminder that he needs to go to sleep. The reminder that he should take his pills at regular hours. His reminder that he’s not a machine and still needs to eat. In a way, he takes care of Tony in a manner that Tony’s not really used to. Sure, his mother took care of him, and Jarvis did, too, back when he was still alive. Even Aunt Peggy took care of him for a while after his parent’s deaths.
His hands go up to cover his eyes. He ignores the fingers gently going over his skin. They feel good, sure. But right now, Tony just feels nauseated.
“I don’t want you to leave the team,” Tony admits. “I was just trying to make you feel guilty for bailing on me. I don’t hold the fact that you were on a mission against you.”
“Tony,” he says, walking up to him and holding out his hand for him to shake. Tony accepts it, but lets go of Steve’s in the process. “It’s been a while, how are you doing?”
“It’s
It was quiet inside her head for a few seconds, but Yaël could already tell what was coming.
“Yeah, he’ll like to do that!” Yaël threw a forced smile back.
“Move over, I’m going to sit there,” he says, pointing at the spot between Peter and Steve. None of them complains, knowing that Tony like to be in the center. Once he’s seated, Peter leans to the side of the couch, throwing his legs over Tony’s. Steve puts his arm over Tony’s shoulder.
Coming to read up about a certain Helmut Zemo – another link to Sokovia, of course – Tony is already on the chopper that leads him to the Raft. He knows the Avengers are stuck in there – not his idea, more Ross’ – and he just needs a moment alone with one of them. He knows Clint is not going to talk – he’s too much of a child for that. Wanda… doubtful. Despite the fact that they manage to work together just fine, Wanda never really seemed to be trusting Tony at all. The shrinking dude, Tony simply doesn’t know. They’ve never introduced themselves to each other – more pressing matters at the time.
“I just, I found blood on the floor, and I followed it to the bathroom but the door was locked and Tony changed my overrides so I couldn’t get in. I had to break the door and Tony is on the floor and he’s unconscious and I can’t wake him up but he’s breathing and-“
“This is the little sucker, in case you want to know more,” Peter says, handing the tube with the dead spider still inside. Dr. Cho’s mouth falls open in surprise, but then she takes it from him. With a smile on her lips, she nods towards Peter in thanks. After that, Peter hurries out of the room, running to the workshop as fast as he can. There, he can see Tony already in an argument with Dum-E while Wanda is seated further away, reading a magazine.
His arrival at school has been met with some looks from his fellow students. He’s sure that the video Flash shared online has something to do with that. So far, though, nobody has pointed it out to him, mostly because he’s been hiding away behind his hood.
“I didn’t mean it that way, Peter… I just don’t want people to look differently at me.”
Tony gestures to everywhere around them. Pepper and Sharon try to shy away by hiding behind their glass without drinking from it. Happy quickly shakes his head.
“I love you as well,” he says. They kiss shortly before pulling back again. Tony is then quickly ushered away by the wardrobe-team who seem intent on getting him into some decent-looking clothes. Peter, too, is dragged along. And as the two are put together, getting clothes thrown into their arms, Tony decides to ask at last.
Like he suspected, it’s all about the Goblin’s attack. There’s some footage of him fighting with the other Avengers, and somebody even managed to get a good shot at Iron Man flying by. Out of all the Avengers, Tony Stark has always been the one that gave him the most chills whenever he talked to him. It’s probably out of a scientist-perspective, but the idea that somebody as smart as Mr. Stark would even strike a conversation with him… No, he still can’t quite fathom it.
Next to him, there’s more shifting. That’s when Tony opens his eyes. Because the shifting comes from behind him.
Tony groans and lifts up his hand to rub his brow, shaking his head a little bit. Taking a step back into the hallway, he points a finger towards Peter, and then Ned.
Steve doesn’t leave his side until Bruce arrives with the quinjet that will bring him back to the Tower. After that, he returns towards the fight, probably ready to give Peter a stern warning about his reckless behavior. Tony hopes it at least; he doesn’t feel like he’s ready to do it himself.
Peter nods. “I’m fine, Dad. Just gonna clean up my mess in the workshop for a bit.” He points towards the elevator that leads to the workshop. Tony nods with a smile.
“Show me that thing,” Mr. Stark says, pointing towards the gauntlet and the arc reactor. Peter obeys and hands it to him, dropping it back down on the desk and fidgeting his fingers together the moment they were freed from the mechanical glove.
“Oh Tony,” Steve says with a pained sound. Tony suddenly feels a hand resting onto his shoulder, and he looks up, only to find Steve staring at him with a worried look. “I’m so sorry.”
Tony turns around in surprise, not having heard Peter enter the room. He’s already in his sleeping wear, his hair messy and dark circles under his eyes. He looks tired, like he’s about ready for sleep.
“I kinda forgot you guys can take this elevator?” he tries awkwardly, keeping his hands behind his back. The two men blink one more time before shrugging and at last entering. When the door of the elevator closes behind them, it’s none too soon.
“Because…” Peter mutters, sniffing his nose once. “Because I felt so much stronger, invincible. I was fast, agile, flexible. Even more than before so…”
“Sure, I’ll leave you alone,” Tony mutters. He leans forward to kiss Peter on the forehead. They still have many things to talk about, but the truth is: now they at least have the time for it.
Tony finally gets up, walking up to Steve, who takes a step to the side the closer Tony gets.
“Thank you, for apologizing,” Natasha says. “Now can you take off the suit so I can give you a proper hug?”
Yaël shrugs. “Nothing much. I’m mostly here because Raido’s currently the only heir to the throne. But even when Jane’s kid is born, the Asgardians will pretty much expect this little prince to be here often enough.”
But he’s not; he’s not a Stark, he only shares the same blood with one. Had he been born in normal circumstances, sure, he’d be Peter Stark instead of Peter Parker. But it is what it is now; Peter can call himself Mr. Stark’s son all he wants, he’ll always stay a Parker.
Enjoy! If there's any obvious mistakes, please don't be afraid to point them out.
“Have you brought up the marriage thing yet?” she asks. Peter’s mouth falls open behind his mask. A ball smashes against his head. When he turns around, he finds Clint sticking out his tongue towards him. Peter flips him off, glad Steve didn’t see it.
“I… have no warm water, which I can fix, of course, with my powers, you know… but I was a bit, eh, annoyed.”
he thinks. He should know it’s useless.
“Peter,” Tony suddenly mutters. Because it can’t be true at all, can it? There’s no way that Peter can be dead, right? He’s just a kid, after all. About to turn eighteen in just a month. He should be going to the Empire State University. Should be graduating this year, take a lovely girl as his date for homecoming.
“Uh,” Peter starts, but then he closes his mouth. What’s he supposed to say here? That he ended up panicking because his mentor decided to install a clock? Stark’s just going to laugh in his face, that’s what’s going to happen! “I’ll just get back inside.”
“Yeah, that guy. Still haven’t managed to talk to him,” Steve mutters bitterly. Mr. Stark just laughs as he shakes his head.
“How’s it going?” Steve asks. Tony just shrugs.
Steve starts laughing, leaning forward to steal a kiss from Tony, who returns the gesture and puts a hand behind Steve’s head to keep the kiss longer. Eventually they pull back, turning towards their sleeping ten-year-old granddaughter.
“Peter?” May asks worriedly.
“What’s that?” MJ asks all of the sudden. Peter looks to where she’s pointing, finding something… black? In the crater, it’s lying there. Looking like some sort of black goo perhaps? Peter’s about to get down and check it out.
Everybody groans and rolls their eyes. Who ever thought it would be a good idea to have the teams chosen by name-pulling?
“Karen, uh, can you call Dad?” he suddenly asks.
(So far, the series is going to contain 3 stories; Peter's story, Yaël & Loki's story, and Natasha's story, though the last one will be a short one)
“That’s dark, Eddie,” Peter mutters out. Eddie shakes his head.
,” FRIDAY’s familiar voice says. Peter reaches out for her before she can fly off.
So Tony leaves the room. In his mind, he calls Steve up again, not expecting an answer at all. When he gets to voicemail, Tony takes another deep breath and brings him up to date about everything that just happened today.
with that?!” Steve almost shouts. Tony, too, sits up before pulling the blanket back up to cover the two of them again.
“Nah,” he mutters. “I don’t think the world needs more near-death experiences if any of those drawings would end up in the wrong hands.” Miles shudders at the reminder of the world-wide disasters that have happened already in his life. The attack on New York, Sokovia, that time a giant space-ship appeared above the city and took away a weird wizard… Heck, he even learned from Peter and MJ that that one huge storm cloud that hung over the city was actually a huge being called Galactus that was intending on eating the planet. They should thank the Fantastic Four for that one…
Peter looked at her like he was trying to figure out what she just had said. Yaël sneezed and cleaned her nose with a tissue. “You and Wade were the ones who started stalking me in the first place!” was Peter’s reply. He didn’t seem annoyed, he just wanted to clear the stalking-issue out.
“Peter, I know you’re only doing what you think is right, but we just want you to pick your battles wisely,” Steve tries to bring down the situation.
What was he thinking, even? Saying Dum-E’s name has probably been the dumbest thing in the world; who would believe Mr. Stark would actually call his very first robot like that? Who even in this class has had the chance of meeting Mr. Stark in person?
Steve still has his arms crossed. “Well, I can’t let you into SHIELD just like that. Everybody pretty much hates you in there.”
“At least he tells me what’s wrong with you. You never talk about yourself!” Peter drops the pen and grabs both his Dad’s hands into his own, making him look up. “You were there when I was down. Now let me do the same, please?”
“When, uh, when Peter came with you, and we talked things out.”
Harry chuckles, picking Peter back up and getting the two of them back into the air.
Another dozen of prisoners joined them with loud cheering, some of them even had tears in their eyes. What a life had they been through, locked up, forced to kill others just for the pleasure of the Grandmaster and his audience. Yaël only had to do it once, but some of these people had been here for years.
Peter sighs before clearing his throat and shrugging. He wipes off a few drops of sweat while regaining his breath.
“Don’t worry, Yaël, I stopped time for a minute for this is only a dream of a memory, you know?” The man behind her got up and walked towards her.
- Time jump of a few weeks
Natasha had held her hands up as the car was stuck behind a red light.
“Maybe you have the flue or maybe you feel that I need to take a shower.” Yaël said as she looked at herself in the mirror and curled her nose, trying to ignore her sight that was shaking once more.
“Now, maybe we can get to business, now?”
“Pssh, is that Yaël?” someone whispered behind her.
“You smell like your workshop,” he imitates Pepper. “It’s nothing I haven’t seen before – sure fine but imagine me walking in on her getting dressed then I’m really gonna get it, stupid shit rules I don’t understand…”
?” she suddenly asks, having picked up anyway. Tony turns his head, seeing her face on the holo next to his desk. “
Charles had noticed as soon as she came in, that Yaël wasn’t good at doing nothing. So he made sure she had something to do. Like cleaning or washing, which was kind of funny, because whenever she was stressing out she used to do those things too in her apartment. Charles had asked her if she didn’t feel like he was denigrating her with those tasks, but she felt comfortable doing it, it made her relax.
Well, Peter never said the guy was sane, right?
Tony can tell that her mind is already made up pretty much. She nods at him and gets onto her feet. He watches her grab her shoes off the ground, which is indication enough for him to get up as well. Once she’s wearing her coat she nods towards the door for him to follow.
After that, he gestures for everybody to come closer. After that, he starts talking.
“Okay what does this serum give us,” Tony mutters, pointing his finger to the holographic notebook on the screen. “First there’s the superhuman strength.”
- Peter has trouble dealing with his problems
“It’s one hundred percent me,” Tony assures her. “And I need you to listen.”
“No, you don’t need to do that. I can earn my own phone,” Peter assures him, causing for Steve to smile.
Peter looks surprised. His eyes are open wide, and a fly could just fly into his mouth if he doesn’t close it soon.
“No, we’re still figuring this out, Yaël. We’re taking it slow.”
May hesitates for a little moment before nodding. She kisses Peter on the forehead once more before turning around and exiting the room. After that, Tony locks everything, making sure that nobody – or nothing – gets out. That includes ventilation shafts, sinks and pretty much everything that could be used as a gate from one place to another.
“Tony?” she asks. Tony finally clears his throat and lowers his head. Then he nods with his eyes squeezed shut.
Oh, no. It’s just Clint and Sam, both of them looking even ten times more horrible than Steve does. Clint is scratching his hair in confusion while Sam plants his shoulder against the wall and drags it from there.
“Alright, we’ll get you to New York,” he sighs, clearly not completely behind the idea, but willing to risk it for his best friend. Steve manages a small smile after that.
Then Aunt May turns her head and lowers the hand to her shoulder, her wrist resting above her heart.
“Miss, may I bring my own guitar next lesson? Not to be rude or anything, but-“
“If you don’t want to go that’s okay, Tony. I can understand it’s not easy for you,” Bruce reminds him. Tony shakes his head.
“Let me guess,” Tony starts. “I’m grounded from any field work?”
Wades eyes shone like the eyes of a little girl when she stepped out of the bathroom. He was almost back at his normal length, Yaël noticed as he stood up.
So he might be kicking down some trashcans in his enthusiasm to put it on… that doesn’t mean that he’s being irresponsible, right?
“Oh,” Korg pointed at his friend. “Miek’s dead.”
“It was some free sample on the street. I already had Bruce look it over so it’s no big deal,” Peter assures her. Then he puts his hands in his hoodie and offers them a smile. “So what are the plans?”
His voice is hoarse. He blinks a few times but it feels like his eyelids are not moving at all.
“This is, uh, him?” Tony tries, making a grimace as the lie rolls out with trouble. He never liked Richard out of principle, and he feels even worse pretending to be him in the dead guy’s mobile lab.
“Careful, or the next thing you’ll say is that Clint could, too.”
"FRI? Is Bruce busy at the moment?" Peter asks while heading to the kitchenette and get himself a hot cup of coco.
Yaël sighed as she put her phone away and jumped on her bed which bounced back a little. Maybe Wade was a few hundred years old?Did being immortal count as a superpower? Wait a minute, was she mutated too?
Peter knows that they’re taking things slow again; he’s aware of the dates they’ve been going on, almost going three times in a single week. Peter’s been counting them, knowing that their next date tonight will be their seventh. What they do all the time, though, he has no idea about.
Steve smiles at him and then nods before hooking his arm with Tony’s. “Of course, Tony.”
Ah, crap, Tony picked up. Peter makes more noise, but while he sees Tony’s face in front of him, all Tony can see is what Peter can see. So Peter makes sure that Tony can get a full view of everything.
She doesn’t answer to that, which Tony is grateful for. He doesn’t want to talk about himself, especially about a time when Mary was the most important person in his life, and she was spending hers pretending their son wasn’t his.
Peter would never have thought to get the chance to see a hungover Steve Rogers.
With a grunt, Peter pulls himself up again. It’s time to get changed and get ready for work. While he’s been deep into his thoughts, the time has flown by. It won’t do him good to be late
Taking a crouched position, the girl goes towards a roof-window and gives it a light tug. It doesn’t budge,  but that doesn’t seem to throw her off. Instead, she takes something out of her utility belt and places it on the window. Much to his surprise, he recognizes the technology the moment she activates it.
“Doing great,” the guy says as Peter drives away from the parking lot, leaving the school behind them and entering the usual busy roads of New York. “Guess I can finally take this off, then. Should thank Widow for it.”
He notes quickly that there are things in the fridge. Things that were supposed to stay cool, but now surely aren’t useable anymore for whatever they needed it for. Tony just walks it by; he knows quite some things about biology, but it’s not his field. Nor his interest. That’s more Banner’s thing.
“Alright, now we’ll rip it,” Tony mutters. He puts down the scissors and looks back up at his son. When his eyes widen, Peter feels a bit of worry.
Tony rubs his brow before shaking his head. His goatee has now turned into an almost full beard. His hair is longer, too. Peter wonders when was the last time Tony took a good, long shower. Not just a quick one to avoid looking at himself for too long.
It was a long search. Tony and Natasha going through the files with Bruce. They infiltrated one base after the other, always coming home empty-handed.
Sometimes Mr. Stark asks him tricky questions, but so far Peter doesn’t seem to fall for them. When Peter is asked if he has a portfolio, the boy swallows before shrugging.
“F- Felicia?” Peter mutters out, recognizing her instantly without the mask. He’s not sure it’s her; Felicia has dark hair and blue eyes, no? But, then again, didn’t he notice her wearing contacts a while back? Is Felicia even real?
The next day, Reed and Ben give the news that they’re willing to sign. Johnny and Sue aren’t there, which should be indication enough. The Fantastic Four are out of duty as from that day.
“Goodnight, honey,” Tony jokes. But even as the words come out, he knows it’s not really a joke.
“You came to the funeral, didn’t you?” Tony asks. “I saw you, despite the fact that you wanted to make us think you weren’t there.”
Anyway, chapter warnings:
“Aside from Wade we all are,” Johnny says. “It was crazy! It really came out of nowhere!”
He feels a hand on his shoulder all of the sudden, startling him to a point where he jumps off the ground. Turning towards Felicia, he finds her blue eyes looking up at him, giving him an expression he recognizes from somewhere. It’s not pity, luckily. It’s understanding.
“A bar; he needed distraction, I needed distraction. It was a win-win, I suppose.” Then, after that, it’s quiet. Peter listens to their breathing, trying to figure out if they’re in sync, but realizing that her breathing is faster than his own. Then he focuses upon his heartbeat. If it’s really quiet, he can try and listen to hers, as well.
He’s a genius in biology and chemistry, and the combination of it is even better and sounds almost heavenly. It feels like the perfect choice for him, really. He loves the molecular structure of the human body, and he feels like he could actually create the ultimate cure like his parents had intended to do if he would end up on that field.
“Dude, is it always like this?” Harry asks while laughing, nibbling on his bread. Peter rolls his eyes.
“When I was about your age, I could still walk, Yaël. Now tell me how you are?” he always sounded so kindly even when he had to ask her the same question twice.
“So, uhm, that man in the picture with you and Peter… He a family friend?” she tries. Tony could almost laugh at the question.
“Don’t cut me off when I’m complimenting you,” Tony says.
“I’m afraid I don’t completely understand. We’re not really related, are we?”
Steve loves him. Unconditionally.
“A bit,” Yaël admitted, “but I really needed a friend and he simply walked into my apartment.”
“Huh, weird?” Peter mutters to his own. He walks inside the room, taking a quick look. It’s a lot cleaner than he remembers. The clothes that had been lying around are suddenly no longer on the floor. His desk, which had been covered with books and DVD’s is now almost empty. The laptop on it is also gone.
“Alright, you can come,” Tony finally says. Peter jumps up into the air, running towards Tony and wrapping his arms around him. As he hugs him tightly, Tony lets out a small chuckle. “Just promise me you’ll stay away from Johnny Storm, alright? I don’t need his bad influence to get on you!”
For a moment, Peter looks at his hands. Did he seriously destroy his phone like that? And his goddamn controller? That shit ain’t cheap! With a grunt, Peter jumps up from the couch, putting the last controller safely on the table right after saving his game. Without turning off the device, he heads to the remains of his cellphone and takes out his memory card and SIM.
“Hey, Dad, welcome back,” Peter says, managing a smile despite the awful way the two parted.
“I don’t think I would really remember anything other than ‘yes, he’s your father’, or ‘No, he’s not your father’,” Peter tries to joke. Dr. Cho does offer him a smile after that, and she sits down, motioning for Peter to do the same.
“Aw, don’t be angry, Petah!” Shuri tells him. She puts her arm on his shoulder and leans against him before pointing towards MJ. “I mean, look at her! She’s a queen on her own!  The queen of America!”
“Uh, yeah,” he mutters out, then. “Back when the Black Cat and I almost- you know?”
“Grays,” another guy says, holding his hand up. “On rare occasions do we feel attraction, but even if we do we don’t always act on them. It’s more at random rather than having to form a sexual bond.”
“Then how is it that even the best scientists that have been working for Stark Industries can’t recreate this device even
“But… why?”
Heck, it’s getting complicated here.
What, why? No you know what, don't tell me. Can you now stop breaking the fourth wall, please?
Though Peter saw his face. At least, Tony thinks he did. But he can’t reach him. Tony sighs and puts the phone away.
Well, maybe it was time for her to join his ‘zone’.
“Don’t worry, dear. There are enough cups in this place!” Yaël made a new coffee and some tea for X too. After she brought Scott the coffee, she sat down in front of Charles and cracked her fingers. Well, she had never played chess before. She was used to playing checkers, which she did with Wanda sometimes.
Once again, no chapter warnings! :-)
“I suggest you talk a little louder, Peter, I’m sure the kids outside haven’t heard that,” he mutters towards him a bit jokingly. Despite that, Peter can still feel the tension.
A gasp escapes from his throat. Hurriedly, he wets his lips and passes the sleeve of his shirt over it, willing for everything to be gone. His face hurts from all the rubbing, even coloring red itself because of it. But he’s clean now, so that’s good at least.
Oh, yeah, he can joke now. Because his parents are human, still – Peter is, too; he’s just a bit different from them.
“Heya sports, did you all sleep well?” Tony asks once he notices the two boys arriving. He’s got an amused smile on his face while he closes the refrigerator, holding a milk carton in his hands.
Harry asks, jokingly. Peter laughs.
Oh, boy. Yaël needed to find something to distract these two before they’d kill each other. Not that Deadpool was able to move, nor did Peter look like someone who easily killed people.
The men blink in surprise, before giving each other a quick look. Scott is the first one to throw his hands in the air.
“Alright, alright,” he mutters. “I’m sorry, Peter. I just- I wouldn’t know what to do if anything would ever happen to you.”
“It- it looks good,” Peter admits. Harry smiles again before turning towards Venom, who is digging himself out of the hole he’s been pushed in. “So, what, you’re the Blue Goblin now?”
Steve frowns upon seeing it.
Of course, the principal will know there’s no father to speak of. He’ll figure out that, whoever will appear in Mr. Stark’s stead will not be in any relation to him. Who would it even be? Peter can almost imagine Mr. Stark sending Steve here – or Steve offering to come instead.
