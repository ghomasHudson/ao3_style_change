He kept breathing, then a sudden noise caught his attention. He turns his head in the direction of the reception to see a tall, blonde woman, with clicking high heels walking down the hallway.
"Up for a morning sex, honey?" Tony says smirking, taking the sunglasses off, and putting it on the collar of his shirt, revealing the bruise still red next to his eye.
“You’re good?” Steve mumbled, looking up to those brown eyes that he loved so much. Tony nods frenetically.
"No, don't apologize." For a tiny moment, Tony seems like he's going to rest his hand on Steve's left knee before he retracts the move and grips the wheel again. "I'm just surprised, I think. I grew up hearing stories about the greatest Captain America and all of this." Tony hesitates. "I kinda have a crush on you too."
Steve didn’t let him complete the sentence. Instead, he leaned in and captured the lips of the short man. It doesn’t matter if people around them were looking at them. Oh my God. He was dating Tony Stark. Tony Stark of all people in this department.
"You're new here?" She asks. Steve raises his head attempting to seem a bit confident.
"No one. I just linked the dots." She says shrugging. "You, here, at your workshop. And Steve is blowing up every sandbag available with his punches. You are really predictable, guys." Tony rolls his eyes, sometimes he just forgets that Natasha is a spy and she sees further than any of them.
He pushed the door and dodged from the people talking cheerfully, miserably he headed to the counter sitting and pulling a banknote to the bartender.
"I guess I was wrong about, uh, you know, you being bad at keeping secrets." Tony shrugged, and thank God he didn't mention Siberia, and the secret Steve kept about his parents' murder.
After the battle, he was taken to a hospital. He doesn’t remember much of it, he has no idea how he got there, he just remembers being taken on a stretcher through the halls of the hospital, everything passing so fast around him, everything was a blur. He doesn’t remember when he fainted. Or better said, when he fell in a comatose state.
Steve frowned. Of course, she would see him around, he worked there and so did she. Oh, wait… Steve thought when the words finally sink in. A voice came over to get Steve out of that situation.
"Are we ordering takeout?" Tony said while took a sip of his coffee. That was probably the seventh mug he had had only in a day.
Steve wants to fill Tony up.
For minutes, there are only Tony and him in that empty corridor where the open window and the strong, cold wind outside could give them both a severe case of pneumonia. Steve already had pneumonia when he was younger. God, he hated the winter season. He remembers that when he was younger, his mother used to keep him locked at home, all the windows shut and Steve could not even get closer to the front door. His only distraction was his sketches and Bucky that would come over and play with Steve, drinking hot chocolate and watching cartoons together.
Bucky agreed. They certainly could do this all day because of the high stamina levels proportionated by the serum. They could fuck all day without having to worry about a refractory period. Fuck all-day long. They certainly should try it anytime. Bucky chuckled with the thought of Steve fucking him all day long, keeping him full all the time. It sounds like a dream. A dream that he wanted to make come true anyday.
He shouldn't have run away, he should've stayed and listened to whatever Steve had to say. He opens his eyes facing the glass, a weakness. He knew he shouldn't but it was so hard to hear those words coming from Steve's mouth. But an action shouldn't justify another, he keeps repeating inside his head. He raises the glass. He wasn't so much strong as everyone else thought.
"Fuck," Tony mumbles, twisting an agent's arm and pushing him against another one, both stumbling on one's another and falling through the glass door.
Tony observed Steve and the way his eyes moved to the document. He is a strategist, Tony could even see the supersoldier's neurons working at lightning speed to get them in.
"Where have you been?"
"I can't turn off my mind from everything that happened these past two weeks."
Bucky wonders if Tony is willing to be his Alpha.
Tony can hear his irregular breath. Steve leans to kiss him, Tony puts a cautious hand on his chest. "We're gonna run out of hot water if we don't stop playing, soldier." Steve snorts, but he robs a kiss from Tony anyway.
"Doctors. They took blood samples like that that you're holding, a lot of those, actually." Steve frowns like he was remembering something unpleasant. "Pain. I remember someone mentioned the bone marrow." Steve gets up, exasperate, passing his fingers through his hair. "Shit, I don't remember much."
He opens the front door feeling the warm air inside of the house wraps around him like a safety blanket. He puts the grocery on the kitchen’s counter and makes his way to the living room, the fireplace was still emanating a soft heat and the lonely flames were almost over. Steve sighs and he leans over the fireplace stirring the flames making them emit a more intense glow and light crackles. He stands up and his eyes fall over a picture above the fireplace, he takes the portrait cleaning the slight dust with his sleeve, that pic, ops, he should say that selfie was taken during his and Tony wedding, he had taken the picture himself because he was taller than Tony, so the brunette was right behind him making a funny grimace. That was definitely one of the happiest days of his life.
"Sure. I did. I-I enjoyed it... very much." Tony is looking at him, Steve is sure of that, he can feel those brown eyes observing him, maybe waiting for a reaction. The blond opens his eyes just to have his hypotheses confirmed. "Don't worry, Cap, the boy who you chose to spend your life with is a lucky one."
"I'm going to get a washcloth to clean us up." Tony lets go of his arm with a sigh before crashing onto the bed one more time.
"We're gonna need pasta for lunch," Steve says, taking a sip of his coffee. "And some sauce, too." He adds.
"M' fine."
"Well, it seems like we're borrowing some clothes," says Tony sarcastic.
"Thank you, Steve," Tony blinks timidly and takes the soldier's hand gripping it reassuringly. He could feel the tremble, once consuming his bones, going away and his breathing reaching regular levels, syncing with Steve's.
Steve looks up, a smiling appearing on his face at the sight of Tony.
Tony pays the driver and steps out of the car, he is an easy target in the middle of the road, so he walks to the next warehouse before pulling his phone out of his pocket and asks FRIDAY for the directions where the signal was emitted. When it's done, he starts to follow it. Walking bent down and in the shadows and hidden spots he can find in the middle of the afternoon.
Steve loved it. Tony leaned so comfortably against his chest while they talked about daily subjects, or their jobs, or their families. It felt right. It felt great. Steve thought he had never felt so warm, and cozy with someone before. He felt it with Tony, and he could never get enough of it every time Tony was around. Having Tony around made Steve felt wanted, loved.
, he thought.
"You know if you tell me what we're looking for, we can find it faster," Steve says sitting on a rock while Tony was looking to the ground with the briefcase in his hand.
"He's not here." Steve started putting one his hand on his hips and looking to the brunet. Tony understood right away.
Steve bounces his leg impatiently while he waits for the elevator to come up.
Beside Morgan’s bed was Tony Stark sat on the floor while cuddling the little girl’s hair, he turned and smiled at the sight of Steve in the doorframe. Steve entered the room and sat on the edge of the bed.
Apparently, the congress that Hank Pym was invited was a global one, according to the invitation, scientists from all over the world were invited to present their projects and ideas in a one-month event, which means that was a huge event, and they would take, at least, two more weeks to going back, since Hank left two weeks ago, and they were almost half one week. Tony sighed heavily.
He shook those thoughts away. Remembering his time in the Army was a hard thing. Steve thought that he could not be able to forgive the mistakes he had made in missions, the men he wasn’t able to save. Bucky would say that Steve always took too much on him, and maybe he did because he was the kind of man who took all the responsibility on him. Steve sighed, that’s exactly what he has been working with his therapist.
“We should have finished it two weeks ago, but,” Natasha sighed. “we had the harassment problem, and a sexual assault episode, so we’re restarting it today.” Steve nodded and followed Natasha when she stopped next to a desk where all types of equipment Steve might need, and some he has never ever dreamt to use were available. “I have to make a few calls, so I won’t be here, but Wanda,” Natasha pointed to the redhead on the other side of the room. “She’s my internship. She knows how I like it, and she has everything prepared. Ask her for suggestions. She loves it, by the way, and she’s really good.” Natasha’s phone chimed in her hands, but she ignored it until finish all instructions she had for Steve. “You can leave for lunch with Wanda, I’m sure she can show you around.” The phone chimed again, and Steve may have seen a flash of the name ‘Tony’. “I have to take this one. See you.”
It was Steve who knew Peggy at first. He met her when Bucky went on a mission in Iraq, and Steve wasn’t sure if he would be accepted in the Army, given to his medical history that was terrible back then. However, Peggy worked in the Army office for a while until she decided to leave and open her own restaurant in Brooklyn. Peggy fully supported Steve in his decision of giving it a try. Fortunately, he was accepted. He trained for months over his limits, listening to the jokes of other fellas. Steve trained day and night, his muscles grow, he became stronger, and following an adequate diet plus daily work out, Steve was able to get rid of most of his diseases and show a high improvement of his health.
Steve can’t resist that sassy smile on Tony’s face. Tony leans up, catching Steve’s lips kindly, experimenting with each other’s lips before their tongues met in a quick, lovely kiss. They are smiling like two in-love teenage boys when they pull apart.
A door opens in the corridor, and Howard Stark appears, he looks to both sides of the place. Quickly Steve turns his back to him, but it doesn't seem work, well apparently the odds were not in his favor today.
“Is Happy in Malibu?” Steve breaks the silence, trying to start a conversation.
Now, it's official. This fic will have between 10-11 chapters for sure. I'm going to start writing chapter 7 this week.
"Do you see that pickup at the end of the street?" Tony says but he didn't turn around, Steve glances upon Tony's shoulder. "Tank if full. The owner just got in the restaurant with a bouquet in one of the hands, probably a date, so he's not gonna notice that the pickup is gone till the end of the date. It gives us, at least, one hour ahead on the road." Tony speaks sure of himself. Steve nods in agreement.
"What, Cap? I thought you trust me." The genius says. Steve sighed and let go of Tony. He approaches a nanotech device to the card reader beside the door and it opens. They got in the elevator.
She unfolds the letter and reads it while holding the Pym particles on her left hand. She feels her eyes watery reading it again, but she keeps reading, swallowing the lump in her throat.
Behind him, Tony feels something move, he turns around quickly blocking a punch directed to his jaw. Another guy came in his direction, and Tony pulled the guy he was holding his fist in the second, they stumbled. Steve had just knocked out one of his opponents when another goi in a fight with him.
“W-what happ-happened?” Tony asked, his voice was so hoarse because of the lack of use.
The next chapter is already written and it is the biggest chapter I've ever written!
He knew they needed to talk about what happened early in the alley, plus, Steve needed to know if Tony was really jealous of Peggy, or if it was only an imagination, his mind playing tricks with him. The blond had dozen of questions but he didn't know how to begin this conversation, after all, he didn't know if Tony really feels something from him beyond the teammate's affection. Steve was a mess when it comes to talking about his feeling, and maybe, right now he was overthinking.
"Yeah, we should." Steve holds his hand pulling them back to the street light, they walk fast, their body is on fire and the urgent feeling of touching each other is too high to be ignored. Finally, the ugly building appears at their sight for Steve and Tony's relief. Tony pulls the keys out of his pocket and he barely could open the door because Steve was kissing him, on his neck, shoulders. Steve pushes him in, slamming his back against the door.
They stop, and Steve don't hesitate to wrap his arms around the short man, Steve couldn't deny that he loved this slight height difference between them. Tony rests his head on the other man shoulder.
"Yeah, I-I did. Guess I have bad news."
“I know, it’s gonna be a long day. That’s why you need to sleep.” Steve emphasizes, his eyes going down to the brunette’s lips as well. He is unable to resist the smile on his husband’s face, so he attacks his lips and pushes him against the table, making Tony sit on it. The brunette spread his legs so Steve can get even between them and closer to him, Tony hand slid on Steve’s side, his fingers touching every muscle of his husband, he rests his hands on the blond’s ass, he squeezes his cheeks and Steve moans under his touch.
This morning, he decided to hang out for jogging, it's been a long time since he did it, more precisely since Scott showed up in their front door. He ran around, not too far from the apartment where they were settled, then he found this box academy. The girl in the entry, a boxer fighter, said he was welcomed to join them, it was still early so the place was empty, except for him, the girl and a guy organizing the boxer gloves, probably the owner of the place.
“Okay, okay,” Tony shakes his head, the phantom of a smile tugging in the corner of his lips. “I’m okay with all of this. Pepper and I are friends. We’ve been friends for… what? 10 years, I guess,” Tony taps on his chin. “I guess so. Anyway, we’ve had a relationship in the past, two years ago, I think, I’m not sure. God, I’m terrible at dates. We are fine. We broke up for the best. We’re only friends. I trust Pepper, she trusts me,” Steve raised an amused brow. “Okay. She trusts me a little bit. She’ll handle the board meeting better than me, so it’s an obvious choice. She loves what she does. We’re all good,” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand on the blond’s knee. “She’s just a friend, Steve.”
They stop at Hank's office.
"I'm worried because when... We can't go back and I have no idea how we're gonna do it. Th-That's all my fault. If I-I hadn't lost that fucking and stupid cube we would already be back, and everyone living their lives as they want to. It was a fucking ordinary mission and I fucked it up." Steve stops him putting a finger on Tony's lips, making him shut up. Tony was overthinking, and also in the middle of an anxiety attack, he was just worsening things to himself.
"Admiring the view?" Steve teases.
"Love you, too, Cap," Tony says back dropping a genuine kiss on the supersoldier's lips.
Natasha woke up two hours later. No nightmares, no calls from Bruce. No Clint. No Steve and Tony. She can't lose her hopes, that what she keeps telling herself since yesterday.
"Good morning, Tony."
“Do you have plans for Thanksgiving?” Steve asked, caressing Tony’s black hair.
"If anything changes, call me," Natasha says standing up and ready to go for her room.
“Okay.”
Steve wasn’t happy.
Steve sats beside him, his hand moving up and down on Tony's back offering comfort.
“Good night, Buck.”
The first rays of the sun hits them, warming their skin, wiping the cold away. Steve also hates the cold, it's a reminder of the time he lost in the ice, not that he could say that he lost, otherwise, he would never know Tony.
"Okay, deal. What movie are we going to watch?"
"You know, I said this to Peter." Steve frowns. "Spiderman, Peter Parker, the kid from Queens," Steve remembers the sixteen-year-old clumsy boy fighting in the airport, he didn't know how Tony knew the boy, but he didn't ask, it should be a story for another time. "And, then, he died when that fucking purple guy snapped, and I have to watch him turning in dust helpless on my arms. Far from home." Tony looks down to his hands and Steve squeezes his shoulder reassuringly. "Then, that day you came to my house and mentioned this crazy idea, and I only could think in Peter and how he deserves to have a future. A bright future." His voice failed and Tony's eyes watered.
"Pym Technologies." The brows only got more intense. "I woke up with this idea. If we're gonna steal the particles we have to know where they're hidden, right?" The blond apparently was not following his train of thought. "I got the floor plan of the building, so we can study a way into these secrets labs," Tony said taking the floor plan out of his lab coat and handing it to Steve who just smiles.
"You could've said that we're friends, teammates, more like partners, actually," Steve says approaching Tony slowly.
I’m thankful for this beautiful woman I’m going to marry in less than two months,” he finally said. Steve observes Peggy blushes when Bucky leans in to kiss her cheek.
“I hope she’s not giving you a hard time on your first day of work,” Carol said, smiling. “Do you want a drink?” The blonde woman pushed a menu filled with all sorts of drinking. Steve waved his hands, grimacing at the options.
Tony can't think a moment where he took better care of himself than this one. He is eating at least two meals and a few snacks, breakfast is something holy for Steve since he does not leave Tony skips it, he is sleeping seven hours per night, which is a record for Tony Stark who never stops working and tinkering. And he is happy, like he never has been before. He is proud of himself.
Many people had told him that Stark Industries would bankrupt, they've been designing weapons for such a long time and they would break a huge contract with the military, but Tony needs to do it. He was right, after all, his projects, beyond weapons, have been a success and restore the glory and dignity that his own enterprise had lost while killing innocent people. That was one of the few decisions in life that Tony didn't regret at all.
I hope you like this chapter.
“Are you ready?”
Steve turns to face her, he didn't know how to react. Peggy thought he was dead, what could he explain to her but the truth? They were messing with that timeline so bad, none of this was supposed to happen. Then Steve turns back to Tony who was standing in the same place, his face now showing that he was a little upset.
“I’m sorry to interrupt, can I take a few photos, please?” Steve asked when he approached the group. Grateful when all of them nodded.
“My father wasn’t the best either,” Steve made a pause. “He used to drink. A lot. That’s why I hate drinking so much,” he stretched his legs. “He was an abusive son of a bitch. He beat my mother and me. Then, he’d say he would be better, he would not do it again, and everything was fine for a while until the next one.” Tony squeezed his knee slightly, a comforting touch.
." Tony jokes. Steve stares at Tony with an amused smile, it's not like he would let it happens.
"Oh, C'mon, pal. This watch is worth more than that you're offering. It's a Louis Moinet!" Tony says cocky.
Then, Steve pulls his pants down. Tony's incapable of taking his eyes off of the beauty Steve's body is. The bulge inside of the blond's underwear is huge and so fucking awesome. Tony feels like he can't wait any more minute to have the blond. Steve crawls on top of him again, pinning him down on the bed and holding the philanthropist's arms above his head. He rubs his nose on the curve of Tony's neck, he's wheezed and he's in control.
“Hey, Morguna, what are you running from?” says Tony while tickling her belly which makes her giggles.
"I'm gonna get a first aid kit on the next drugstore." Tony grasps the wheel.
Steve is rubbing his pulses. Tony notices the red skin from where his arms were tied, he knows that Steve heals fast so the marks will be already gone when they reach the apartment, nothing to worry about. His eyes sweep the room, He gets a blood sample with Steve's name on it, discreetly he sneaks the sample inside of his pocket. He notices how many chemicals are in there. Tony's hands start to work fast, catching the products while he also reads some labels.
"You're so tight and warm, Tony." Steve grunts thrusting harder.
Steve keeps aiming the gun to the man who just laughs, a loud and manic laughter. Then, his eye switches from Tony to Steve.
"Wait, where are you going?" Scott asks like he hadn't pay attention to what everyone was discussing.
"Don't move this arm."
His mind travels back to a few days ago. After the game, Steve and him were leaving the pub, the guy, this same guy almost stumbled onto him, but Steve had put an arm on his lower back, preventing it.
However, Tony already had a few clothes with him, all in the same colors that Steve mentioned, on his left he spots a dark blue shirt, that one would suit Tony's so well, Steve thought before took it and handed it to the brunet, Steve wasn't expecting that Tony would take it since he doesn't like being handed thing, but he does accept it with a smile on his face. It looks like the piece that was missing.
“I’m coming up in five minutes,” replied Tony, but honestly he wanted to stay there with Steve, frozen in that moment, because it was so comfy.
Tony drives them as far away as he can from the apartment they rented, they stay in silence all the way. He'll go there tomorrow morning to get their things and give the keys back to the owner, he promises himself, even though he does not like the idea to let Steve injured and alone in a hotel room.
Tony gets up, takes the syringe with him, and runs toward Steve who is still fighting the agent. The man didn't expect Tony to attack him from behind with a syringe on his neck. The man stumbles and falls beside the other agent, both unconscious.
His life wasn’t the same, and it would never be again. He knew it before he enlisted, but he insisted. He had seen what the military made to Bucky, and he insisted because he wanted to serve his country more than anything, he wanted to do it as his father once did. Perhaps, all of it happened because Steve always had had this faith in people. In individuals. He didn’t regret it, though, but he wished it was easier to cope with.
Steve felt like he could breathe again. Tony accelerates the car above the limit, typical, and Steve put the seatbelt on, remembering the brunet of doing the same. They didn't say a word until they finally reach the road outside of New Jersey.
Tony frowns, seeming a little disappointed with Steve's sudden distance. It wasn’t that he did not want to kiss Tony. God knows how much he wanted it. It was just not the right place for it. The blond surely didn’t want to be the gossip of the week, although he was sure that people would not forget about the photographer and the model so soon, at least, not until a new, more interesting gossip appears.
Steve had spent his afternoon updating his portfolio, editing photos, and posting them on Instagram. He wasn’t popular on social media, but sometimes he got frustrated for having just a small number of followers. Some days he has the impression that he was talking with no one, besides Peggy who always liked all his pictures, and she even shouts out his account on her stories.
Steve puts Tony gently on the bed, crawling over him, taking the brunet's shirt off revealing his chest and the scars where the arc reactor used to be, he didn't care about it, instead he kisses Tony's chest, dropping kisses on the scars until his tongue found a nipple licking it. Tony arches his back in pleasure.
"I was, but I woke up and you weren't there." Tony bites his bottom lip nervously. Steve knows what it means, he probably had a nightmare and Steve wasn't there to comfort him, just like last night. "I remembered seeing this place another day. I thought you'd be here, wasn't wrong, was I?"
Tony reaches the knob, keeping the door open to Steve pass. They head together back to the apartment.
Tony doesn't say anything. He had a solitary childhood too. He used to seek parts of machines that he could use to build something all over the house, when he found enough, he locked himself in his room and thought what he could do with those parts. The difference between him and Steve was that Tony choose to stay in his room. He was a hyperactive child always running around looking for something to create or fix.
Steve was there in twenty minutes just like he had told Sam he would be. Thankfully, it wasn’t a fancy party nor people were dressed in formal clothes. He dodged from a few men in the entry holding their glasses filled with champagne. Steve always felt like he didn’t belong to parties. He wasn’t very good at socializing or talking, he was more the kind of listener. However, his job today was to take pictures of everything happening here. He would pass unnoticed, or so he thought when a hand grabbed onto his shoulder.
“It sounds like a good plan,” Tony grinned
"It is not."
"I guess Thor would probably kill us in a
"Hydra. Hydra wants the tesseract. They have people infiltrated in the Army. Some of them must've seen us."
Steve took a sip, he had to admit that it wasn't so bad, perhaps not a beverage for every day like Tony always take it, though he would never say that he enjoyed coffee to the genius, he knew that the brunet would never take it away if he did.
Thanks for reading.
"Oh my God. You blushed again. I surely deserve a prize for making you blush." Steve says filling his mouth with some scrambled eggs. Tony sticks out his tongue, which just makes Steve laugh.
He leans towards the nightstand opening the drawer and taking off a little bottle of lube. He kneels between Tony's legs spreading them, wrapping them around his waist. Steve pours lube on his fingers, then gently, he inserts one finger in Tony's entrance pushing it slowly and carefully. Tony feels the burning in the beginning, then it slowly fades away, and Steve adds another finger, thrusting his fingers merciless inside of him, scissoring him, preparing Tony to take him all. It feels good, Tony thinks, Steve's fingers inside of him feel really good. He pants when Steve pushes in a third finger, his hard cock pulses with the lack of attention but he doesn't want to touch himself, so he pushes back the feeling, focusing on Steve, on Steve's hard cock with a drop of pre-cum.
A guy wearing a red tank top took Tony by the collar held him up and punch his jaw, Tony's teeth bit his bottom lip making it bleeds. Another punch hit his eyebrow and the corner of his eye. The first guy that attacked him raises his knee hitting Tony's stomach which makes him fold himself with a hand on his stomach. Tony spits blood. There's no point in fighting back. Perhaps he deserves it, it was his punishment for all harm that he caused to innocent people.
Tony looks around, looking for something that he could use against them. This is a chemical lab with high and dangerous chemics on the shelves and desks.
Natasha looks at Rhodey determined. Nothing can stop them. They are going to save the universe. It's time to the Avengers assemble once more.
Steve hands a helmet to Tony.
"What took you so long?" Steve asks a bit impatient when Tony hands him the clothes he had stolen just a few minutes ago.
"What I promised I'd never do again fifteen years ago. A weapon."
Peggy got excited when asked if he could bring someone along for dinner. Of course, she knew who the person was. On the other hand, Bucky was curious. Steve hasn’t been at home often lately, so his best friend knew little about Tony, but that wasn’t a problem, they would have the time to get to know each other during dinner. Peggy loves to talk, so Steve was sure that she would be the one who speaks more at the table.
Steve smiles, then nods. They have the entire day off, maybe they could just watch Netflix and chill. Whatever. Steve still had to invite Tony for Thanksgiving dinner. He hasn’t commented anything since he wasn’t sure if they were together or just enjoying each other's company, but now that he knew for sure that what’s happening between them were more, he could bring Tony home. Well, he still had to tell Bucky and Peggy about Tony, even though he knew that Peggy wouldn’t mind Tony’s presence, actually, she would be delighted to receive him.
Tony's eyes snap back to the TV. Images of the burnt warehouse were showing, in the corner of it, there was a photo of the supposed director of the company. Tony rolls his eyes. Then the journalist appears back on the screen. Tony looks down, stirring his hands nervously.
Natasha decides to cheer up their night together. Clint absolutely loves her.
Then, Steve and Bucky put the plates and cutlery on the well-organized table. It wasn’t a big table, but they could fit in it. Peggy stood up, giving orders to the boy to well place the table while Tony observed it.
“‘Morning, I made coffee,” Bucky pointed to the coffee machine whirring softly behind him. Bucky takes his bag, throwing it on his shoulder. “I’m gonna miss the bus.” Then, Bucky hurries to take his phone on the phone. “See ya.” The door slammed on Bucky’s back.
"Is everything okay?" The brunet asks with a brow lifted. Steve simply nods and turns around to take the driver's seat, Tony opens the door and accommodate himself in the passenger's side, Steve throws the plastic bag to him, Tony caught it and opened a bag of chips and starts to eat offering it to Steve who takes some.
“Ma’am,” Steve said, holding the camera in his hands.
So, they talked about their lives, their childhood, the Avengers Initiative, but most of all, they cuddled. They still had a mission, take the Tesseract to 2023, but this break was precious and unique. That's something they have been needing for so long and they haven't realized. That was the universe's push to make Steve and Tony finally being together, all that they have been living since Steve kissed Tony was exquisite and breathtaking, they deserve that, they deserve to be happy. Even though Tony knew that happened these past five years was a big mess, and a lot of people were mourning for their loved ones, Tony forgets all the guilty and he was just being happy. Because for the first time since Afghanistan Steve made Tony realizes that he was worthy of happiness.
Steve didn’t like drinking. The effect alcohol had on people, Steve didn’t like the results. Nothing good could come from drinking. Of course, he had experienced it when he was a teenager and just wanted to have fun. But after seeing his mother’s look when he got drunk at home one day, Steve just stopped it. He couldn’t do it to her, not again. Since then, he only drank champagne on some occasions, which was rare.
Steve goes ahead in the aisle, and Tony sticks his tongue out to the blond. Yeah, very mature, Tony Stark, he thought. Steve always makes healthy food at the Avengers' compound, he also used to cook along with Sam to feed everyone, and Tony still haven't gotten used to it. Perhaps, because he locked himself in the lab, and it takes Natasha or Steve to drag him out of there to make him eat or get some sleep. Those two dumbass always taking care of him.
Another agent ran over Tony, making him falls on the cold ground with pieces glass, which Tony feels those pieces dig into his arm through the lab coat. He mumbles all the swearing words he ever knows.
He never felt so free like right now. Steve pulled him closer, and suddenly he was sat on the blond's lap while they kissed. Steve hands sliding on his side, his big hands were capable of breaking plenty of things, punching and kills enemies, but against Tony's skin, they were smooth, loving, and warm while the blond worships his body.
He remembers walking close to the mountains, taking the cave for shelter for their long walk under the cruel, burning sun. Drink some water. Listen to Falsworth and Jones joking as usual as Dugan checked his rifle. Bucky came to his side, punching him lightly on the arm.
He left Tony sleeping, after everything the brunet went through these past days, he really deserved to get some rest, and now that the Tesseract was safe Steve felt more relaxed, Pym would be back in four days and then they would finally get home. Only a week had passed and a lot of things had changed, but Steve felt like Tony and him were together for longer, Steve still hasn't thought how he would tell the team about their relationship, though he still had a couple of days to think about it and talk with Tony.
Though, no one in that enterprise knew that they'd been hanging out. Okay, maybe Natasha knew about it since she was Tony’s friend, one of the few friends he had, at least, that Steve knew. Tony talked about his best friend from MIT, Colonel James Rhodes, he remembers Tony telling him that they would get along very well. There was also Happy Hogan, his bodyguard and sometimes driver, and Pepper Potts, Tony’s assistant. James Rhodes, or as Tony liked to call him, Rhodey, was on a classified mission abroad, Tony expected him to be back by Christmas time.
“Don’t be. My mother was such a lady, she was kind and I remember she worked as a volunteer sometimes. My old man hated it, too. He only wanted things in his way. Anyway, he was a jerk.”
"Yeah," Steve replies sounding carefree while he pours coffee and milk to himself. "Ready?"
After all of these years, he finally was able to get his dance.
Steve thought with a silly and in love smile on his face. Tony's eyes found his and the brunet leans to kiss him.
"I'll pay for the meal, you pay for the hotel room, alright?" Tony doesn't even have the time to contest before Steve pays for it.
"Calm down there, big guy." Tony puts a hand on Steve's shoulder, squeezing it in a sign of comfort. "That's not a problem, since I'm good at memorizing this kind of stuff. The big question here is, why the hell they would take the floor plan and leave that behind?"
Well, Miss Potts stopped in front of the director’s door and knocked twice before opening it and step in.
A year ago, Tony have asked him to marry him again. Now, they were doing a small celebration to renewed their vows, that they had made in 2015 after all the Ultron thing. Well, that small celebration wasn’t exactly small since they knew a lot of people these past years and everyone was there, except for Natasha.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated.
Tony doesn't answer. He hears footsteps outside and he imagines that those agents are not going to give up, they are willing to look in each lab and room if that means to find them.
He looks to the bloody cloth Steve threw on the floor, his bowels turn to the sight and he pushes Steve aside before he leans his head deep and throws up. He doesn't have any problem or phobia with blood, but the events of the night are too much for him. God, he doesn't want Steve to see it.
Then, Steve located him. Tony was engaged in a conversation with Clint and Wanda, he holds a glass in of his hands, Steve sighed worried, he hated when Tony drank. Mainly, after everything they’ve been through the past year. Steve approaches, his face turns into unsatisfied, he really didn’t want to have an argument with Tony right now. He was happy they were together again. Tony watches Steve approaching and smiles.
. I'm not sure if Thor's hug is capable of killing
"May I help you?" Then, he looks at Tony's badge. "Professor Potts?"
"Of course, that would be great," Tony replies, perhaps too quickly.
Tony should've known, or at least, guessed. Peggy Carter, the same woman he grew up with was the woman that Steve always loved, that he still loves, actually, and Steve, ironically, is the man he loves. Tony narrows his eyes. That's confused.
"Those punks are in the neighborhood again" a man yells to his wife from the window above their head before shouting "I'm going to call the police." One of the young guys just showed the middle finger to the old man, an act of full disrespect. "Are you okay, sir?" The man shouts.
“So full, Alpha,” Tony exhales, his arms wrapped around Steve, breathing heavily against the Alpha’s shoulder.
Steve clenches his hands into fists, and he feels the empty glass of champagne break, pieces of glasses sticking on his palm before he puts the rest of it on the table next to him.
Steve intertwined their hands as they came up upstairs. They stopped at the front door as Steve looked for his keys. He was never able to find his keys inside the pockets with the amount of trash Steve keeps in there when the door opened suddenly.
“I guess we are going to see each other a lot since we work in the same department. It’s nice to meet you, Rogers,” Wanda smiled fondly. “Everyone is like a big family around here, so don’t worry. You’re gonna be okay,” Wanda patted him on the back.
"So, how do we know that they know we have the tesseract?" Tony asks and a sudden glimpse comes to his mind.
"It's..."
A flash of sunlight pours between the black curtains, the only source of light in the room right now dancing onto her messy desk. Steve would definitely scold her if he saw those pencils and papers spread all over the desk carelessly, she doesn't care, though, she finds herself into her own mess.
"Not an option," The blond mumbles. "Go ahead."
"I heal fast." Both smiles widened.
"So, will anyone explain to me?" She asks with a remarkable British accent. Steve lets out a sigh, he has no idea from where he should begin. Peggy rests her stare over the blond. "You're not dead." She constates. "What the bloody hell is happened in that plane crash? I thought you were dead all of these years." She is pissed, oh, she is really pissed. She could even punch Steve on his perfects white teeth, but she wants an explanation first."
He watches as Alpha puts a hand on Tony’s knee, squeezing it slightly, and a guttural growl comes from the bottom of his throat.
“See you later,” Pietro said when the doors opened on the 4th floor, indicating that was the finances department.
“You know you just have to ask, right?” Bucky finally turned to look into those blue eyes, only to be welcomed with a smirk.
Peter follows her and they hear Pepper saying to the boy fix his hair while she took care of Morgan. They gave each other an accomplice smile, then Tony reaches his hand out to Steve.
Steve enters his not so neat, tidy room. He didn’t have much stuff, though. There was only a small closet, a nightstand where he keeps a lamp, a book, and a glass of water. He also has a shelf with books, Steve loves to read, but the most important thing to him was close to his small window with a fire escape where a glass filled with cheap brushes is along with the still closed inks spread all over the floor, and a blank canvas looking back at him every day. Steve painted since he was a child, he loved it, but a poor kid from Brooklyn couldn’t hold all his future in being an artist, instead, Steve got a student loan and coursed Photography at the Pratt Institute. He must have been a photographer for two years after his undergraduate before he decided to join the military at the age of 24.
“Stop,” Steve turns his head harshly, his amplified senses getting the word that wasn’t exactly shouted, but the reason why he understood the word so clear is that it came out from Tony’s mouth. “Stop! I told you to stop!”
Tony follows Steve, only stopping to get a candy bar in the middle of the aisle without the blond seeing it.
Steve grimaces unhappily,
"One seven and we don't talk about it anymore."
“Move,” Bucky indicated.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said, parking his bike in another space. “Rumlow, right?” The man nodded. “I believe it was you who called me the other day. I’m Steve Rogers.” Steve extended his hand to a handshake, but the man ignored the gesture. Instead, he turned around.
"Who is this?" Steve mumbles, looking confused at Tony.
“There’s this party happening tonight, in a club in Queens. Some people from work will be there. You should come, I could introduce you to them,” Wanda commented, giving a bite on her sandwich right after.
Tony feels useless, he doesn't even know where Steve is taking him. Steve is coughing because of the smoke he inhaled, Tony listens to it. The whirr seems to be fading while they walked through the hallways. They turn a corner, there is a door at the end of it, and also a sign above it, red sign which Tony narrows his eyes in an attempt to read it. Exit, it says.
“I know. But I…,” Steve sighed. Bucky was right, he’s been unemployed for far too long now, and he was really desperate for a job. After all, this was his home too, and he could not let Bucky pay for everything alone, so whatever comes up from this, it might be a good thing. “Fine. You’re right.”
“Go take a rest, punk,” the dark-haired said as he took Steve’s position.
Happy is not here today, according to Tony, he’s driving Pepper around for some SI’s business, which means it’s only him and Tony in the car. Thankfully, traffic is not so bad, and the Stark Tower is in the middle of town, easy access, plus, the silence in the car is not awkward like it was in the first times Tony picked him up in Brooklyn. In one of Tony’s songs, Steve wasn’t good at memorizing their names, and he also prefers classic older songs, filled with silence.
"It's part of the job, Steve." Tony is studying him with his brown eyes.
They trusted the shadows to hide their hands intertwined while they walk on the sand barefoot. The salty smell of the sea filling their nostrils, the soft wind hitting their face and messing their hair, it was a little cold, but the wine they had, helped to keep them warm for now.
“I know.”
"Yes, it is," Steve sighed "SHIELD found me in the ice, then I-I joined The Avengers Initiative, a project designed to reunite the most remarkable people on Earth. Well, that what Fury used to say," The last sentence Steve mumbled to himself. "So we could fight what they can't."
As I've said before, I'm working in a new fic pairing Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch, in case you're interested I'll post it soon.
They left the car in an empty street, next to downtown, like Tony had said it was a loan, they never intended to keep the vehicle, and they hoped the police would track it and the owner would have it back soon. Tony bought a newspaper in a kiosk in the corner of the street and started to look for apartments for renting in the want-ads They only have a week left before coming back to their original timeline, but if Hydra wants the Tesseract they would be pretty determined to find it, which means that Tony and Steve needed to be really discreet in order to keep the cube safe and sound for their own's sake.
"Better put it in a bank. It's not a good idea to do a road trip with this amount of money." Tony says lifting the package. Steve agreed. "I see a bank down the street, I'm going there." Steve follows a few steps behind the brunet, then Tony turns around to face him making him stops. "You can stay here, see around the town, maybe. I won't take long." He assured. Steve hesitates at first, he didn't think it a good idea left Tony's alone, but maybe he was being too protective, so he just nods and Tony goes ahead without him.
"You're sure you don't wanna go to the hospital?" Tony asks.
"Everything is under control!" He hears Tony shouts from the kitchen.
Steve took Wanda’s phone and saved his number. He looked down at his phone chiming in his jeans pocket when Wanda sent him the address. He really needed to get a new phone, maybe in a few weeks since now he had a job and he could possibly afford it.
Tony opens a door and finds himself in the same place from where he come inside earlier. Tony looks reassuringly to Steve, and they sneak out from the back door.
Steve sats on the bed panting and putting his head on his own hands, covering his face, he breathes fast and short, clearly too overwhelmed by the bad dream. Tony's sat by the soldier's side, he rests his hand on Steve's shoulder again squeezing it, attempting to reassure the blond that he was okay, he was safe. It seems to work, because Steve passes his hand through his wet hair and turns to look at Tony, he looks thankfully.
Steve acquiesced gratefully. Then, he started to organize the equipment on the desk again. Taking the memory card out of the camera and keeping it safe to hand it over to Natasha before he got to lunch. Wanda had mentioned something about a Winter’s Collection that has been suspended too, and they had to get it half-done after lunch. She also said that Natasha would be there to assist them.
"You're gonna love it, otherwise you don't have a heart!" Tony exclaims indignantly "No, better, I don't think we can keep a relationship if you don't like jellies gums." Steve laughs at the serious face Tony made, but he can see the brunet's lips curled up while he bumps onto Steve's shoulder purposely.
After a few minutes walking around the shop and some clothes hanging on his arm, Steve glances at Tony who seems to have difficulting find clothes to himself, the blond understand the feeling, the stamps in the 70s were too flamboyant, and the colors too bright. Kind of unusual to someone like Tony who is the most part of time wearing expensive suits, generally, in the same colors, dark blue, black, white, and grey, those colors composed Tony Stark's wardrobe.
When he sits, Steve pulls him closer to his chest right away. Tony snuggles against him. Steve's body is warm and comfortable, the physical contact makes him feel real. Touch. Touch something, an object hot or cold could be capable to bring the sense of reality when he felt these anxiety attacks. He just needs to hold this object in his hands tight, feels its form and flaws under his fingers, its heat, to make sure that it is real, to bring him back to think straight. Right now, Steve's warm skin was the thing bringing him back slowly to reality.
"Good morning, sweetheart," Steve says, catching Tony's full attention, he leans to drop a kiss on top of his head. "They just brought breakfast."
It is a quick going to the grocery store that surprisingly is empty this morning, Tony thanks God for it, the last he went there he waited fifteen minutes in the queue, and Tony really hates to wait, although he does not care to let his place waiting for him. Tony gets what they need, checking his mental list to make sure he got everything, he pays for the products and heads back to the apartment.
"Sure," Steve replies doing the same.
This man had Steve, he knew where Steve was and that was how he knew about the time heist, he also, probably, knows about the bracelets and the Pym particles. Shit, what had they done to make Steve talk? Tony didn't want to know, not for now, at least. He needs to make sure that Steve is fine.
I had a busy day and I ended up forgetting what day of the week we were. Here it is.
Outside, the salty breeze of the sea welcomed them. It was fresh for a summer evening. The sunset was a mix of rose, orange, and blue. Indeed, a breathtaking sky. The weather brings up memories from when Tony lived in Malibu, he used to love evenings like that, the only ones capable of taking his ass out of the workshop just to appreciate the landscape with an expensive glass of white wine in his hands.
"It's not so easy finding clothes for your size," Tony complains, pushing the clothes against Steve's chest.
, Steve grits his teeth. Truth is when it comes to Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, Omega, and philanthropist, Steve is always overprotective, and perhaps, too possessive. Steve used to tell himself that that was alright, that it's only his Alpha instincts wanting to prevent his Omega from any harm that anyone could inflict him.
Then Steve drops a kiss on his shoulder before trailed kisses down his back. Tony feels Steve thrust uncertain and he knows that he's close. Steve thrust two more times before comes inside Tony. The brunet feels the hot seed fills him for a while, that's Steve way of marking him as his and Tony just loves it. He feels Steve pulling out and the seed sliding out of his hole making a trail to his thighs.
Steve doesn’t care about the scars, or even the slight shake on his right hand, that got a lot better since he’s been doing kinesiotherapy. In a matter-of-fact, Steve was just happy that he was still alive after everything that they went through the past year.
The sun is setting on the horizon. The pink, orange, dark blue colors are starting to fill in the sky spreading its glorious rest of light on the ground and creating mysterious shadows on the corners of the city. That’s probably Steve’s favorite part of the day. Those melancholic sparks of light fading to give space to the stars were something that amazed Steve. He used to watch the stars when he was in the Army. He used to look up at the sky and admire them while he tried to clean his head from all the concerns that he might have had. He needed a clean head because the lives of other men were depending on his attitudes and decisions. So, that passage from the afternoon to the evening has always been a moment of reflection to Steve, a moment where he could let his thoughts flowing freely in his mind before all the discipline he had learned to have in the field took over him again.
"What about Clint?" Steve asks.
"Tony?" The genius runs closer to the stretcher that Steve was tied. He looked fine, he did not have the IV tube in his veins anymore, he was just left here tied. Steve looked tired, like Tony has never seen before, not even in the battle in New York or Sokovia.
"He didn't come over today." She shrugs in clear disappointment, taking the cigarette to her mouth once more. Tony furrowed.
"I thought you were sleeping, it's still early." The blond mutters.
“Hey,” Bucky said, putting the bags on the table where Steve was, and coming around to stay behind where Steve was sat. “What are you doing?” Bucky leaned closer to the screen. “Wow, this pic is amazing.”
The sun was setting in the horizon when Tony opened the cupboard and realized that they really needed to go to a grocery store if they were planning to have homemade dinner tonight.
Pietro seemed quieter than Wanda, he hasn’t talked much since they met in the elevator, but Steve could tell that the twin boy was, perhaps, a little bit protective over his sister. Pietro offered Wanda a cigarette that she managed very well between her fingers. Steve didn’t like smoking. The smell was just awful, and it never brings out good memories. Steve hated that smell along with the smell of alcohol. But Steve didn’t want to walk away and end up upsetting Wanda and Pietro on his first day, plus Wanda has been being nice all day, so Steve just muttered an excuse to get mint gum chicle in a magazine kiosk on the other side of the street.
The place was empty, of course, it was still 5 a.m, Natasha knew that the other avengers wake up around 6 and 8 a.m, but she kind of expected to see Steve up, ready to go for a morning run, he wasn't there, he didn't have come back from yesterday time heist, neither him or Tony and no one knew why, not even Bruce had answers.
"You could've asked." He says.
“What? Why?” Steve asks, surprised.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry, Miss Romanoff,” the receptionist started to say, but Natasha waved her hand at her.
“You can ask, you know that,” Tony states.
That seemed like a good occasion. The thing was just falling on the soldier’s lap. Maybe the odds are in his favor this week. First, a new job, then an amazing first day, and now a party. He couldn’t ask for more; he just expected the odds to stay in his favor during the entire week. Steve sighed assuring himself that he could make it. He could give it a try. It would be good.
So, Steve leads him to the exit, both of them anxious to be alone again, five drunks guys stumbling in each other get in the pub bumping in everyone around, included Tony. Steve puts his hand protectively on Tony's lower back and once they are out, Steve holds Tony's hand firmly, Tony smiles. They could only be themselves when they're away from people gaze.
He puts the portrait back to its place and makes his way upstairs. In the hallway, he hears giggles coming from the only door opened, he walks silently and slowly and stops in the doorframe leaning against it and putting one of his hands on his own hips, a genuine smile playing on his lips.
Steve grins while he drops one more kiss on Tony's forehead when the philanthropist closes his eyes to relax. Then, he turns to the bathroom, getting a washcloth to clean the cum and the rest of lube out of him, then gets another wet washcloth and walks towards the bed, where Tony is laying, tired of their recent activity.
“How did you know it was me?” Steve furrowed.
Steve stood up, and collected his and Bucky’s plate, walking to the kitchen.
weird, Tony thought. He fell in love with Captain America! And Steve has just said that he had a crush on Tony, that was unbelievable. Perhaps, if they knew about each other's feelings sooner, they could've been together a long time now, perhaps the Civil War wouldn't have happened, a lot of things could've been different if they only knew. But the past can't be changed, they could only move on now, a fresh start. Perhaps, when they fix what Thanos did, when they bring everyone backs, they can give themselves a chance.
Tony looks at Steve, he opens his mouth to say something, anything, but nothing comes out, he just ignores the questions Steve had asked.
"Our first night here you said we'd do this together right?" Steve nods. "So we'll do this together too."
"Hey!" He waves, the girl smiles to him, right before spreads an amount of smoke in his direction. "Have you seen Steve today?"
It tastes really sweet, but he can't deny that Tony was right, the sugar melting inside his mouth, those jellies gums tasted amazing. He reaches the package to get more and Tony smiles widely.
Bucky was already up and dressed for work when Steve came through the door. The dark-haired looked surprised to see Steve in sweaty clothes at this hour of the morning, but he didn’t say anything. though.
They came trading Tony's expensive watch, even though Steve had said to the brunet do not do that, they'll find a solution for the money problem. But Tony rolled his eyes saying that he is not the kind attached to things, they needed the money and with that watch, they could survive for months. So, Steve agreed. Now, that Pym would be back in one week and a half, they would really need money, they needed to get to San Francisco and settle in as soon as possible.
Tony had mentioned that the head office was in Malibu since Tony is from there. In fact, he lived in California, although he was spending some time in New York to accomplish the photoshoots and the end of his contract with SHIELD Clothing, much to Steve’s dislike. He didn’t want Tony to go away, but he also could not ask him to stay.
"Half brother?"
"Okay, then. Let's do it." Tony says getting on his feet. Steve attempts to hug him, but Tony steps back swiftly. "Ah-ah, you're all sweaty, and I just took a shower." He complains, even though his hand is on the blond's chest.
"What? That's..." Steve starts to say, but then he looks back to the papers on his hands, flipping through the pages.
As soon as Maria pointed at all people and places, Steve didn’t waste his time, he had work to do. He greeted Fury and took a few pictures. He walked around the place, taking pictures of the decoration, always looking for the perfect angle of lights that could favor the picture. He would edit them later and fix any mistakes. Steve was a good photographer, he could live photographing all his life, even though what he really wanted to do was painting. Being an artist was something far far away from his reality.
I really loved to write about Clintasha <3 I should probably write more.
“Thanks,” Steve muttered after Sam spotted someone and went talk to the person.
"You two finish the gauntlet as fast as possible. We'll find a way to bring everyone back by tomorrow."
Thor turns to her, taking out his sunglasses.
She jumps on her unmade bed, laying on her back, her eyes fixed on the white ceiling. Home and family, she thinks before she drifts.
Steve had met Peggy yesterday, just because of it the soldier had been scattered the rest of the day.
"You okay?" Steve asks.
"You're so beautiful, Tony."
“I’m sure she will,” Bucky always tries to cheer Steve up. Sometimes, it worked, others didn't. Today was not one of them.
“Peggy is always right,” Bucky replied with a chuckle. Steve smiled, that was true, Peggy was good at reading people. “Did Natasha call you?” Steve frowned, putting two cartons of milk in the basket.
She didn't take it seriously when she moved in, keeping only the necessary, some clothes, a few souvenirs from her sister, and hygiene materials. That's all. Then, after the snap, she stood in the compound more often and now she felt she was in home, matter-of-factly. The five years she spent here gave her enough time to redecorate it the way she wanted
“I’m sorry, Peps, we are coming down in a few minutes.” Pepper nods and rolls her eyes, but she doesn’t say anything else before leaves the room.
When they finish it's Steve's turn to wash the dishes while Tony dries them and put it back in the cupboard. They always work in partners, always helping each other.
Peggy stands there switching her gaze between Tony and Steve, a frown between her brows, then she narrows her eyes.
I believe some people might be disappoint by this end. I wasn't certain about it, as I wrote this fic I was always wondering if I should change the end, because that was what I was planning since the beggining. I decided that I'd stick at this end. After all, death is something that we are all affected, and no matter how painful it is to live without our loved one, it's still worth. It's hard, but life keeps going and we have to move on with this pain inside our chest.
Steve's hands rest on his waist and their lips met again in an urgent and needy kiss. Tony wraps his legs around the blond's waist, and Steve holds him tight walking to the double bed in the center of the room, their lips never lose each other, except when Tony peppers kisses and sucks smoothly Steve's neck.
“Tony!” Steve yelled. Tony leaned against the counter, putting down the red cup carefully. Steve rested a hand on Tony’s hip to assure his balance.
"Are you sure you've never seen either of these men before?" asks one of the guards. The agents nods negatively and emphatically.
He turns left, hoping that he was following the right direction, since when he came in he was unconscious, he was not sure about any direction he was taking.
"Okay. It's just the threat is imminent..." Tony sighs. "and I feel I have to protect the one thing I can't live without, not anymore, and that's you."
in love with Steve.
So, Steve puts a hand on the genius' shoulder and squeeze it softly. Tony had his back to Steve, so the blond doesn't see when the philanthropist closes his eyes with his touch. It is warm. Tony sighed in relief. The gesture shouldn't be that comfortable.
"You already told me that, Mr. Stark." His arms fell loose on his sides. "Besides, that is not an option. As I was saying, we need someone with your expertise. Have you imagined what you can offer to the world?"
"I--huh, yeah,"
"We will still have hours on the road tomorrow. Better try to get some sleep," Steve says breaking the kiss and push back to look at Tony. The brunet grunts in refuse but he stands up wandering to make his way to his own bed before Steve pulls him back to the bed.
“Is everything okay?” Steve nodded, realizing that even though the woman scares him, he should be able to answer her with his own words.
"I am. I forgive you, Capsicle." Tony's voice sounds fragile, he holds his tears and opens his eyes to find blue eyes looking softly at him. Tony doesn't remember anyone looking at him the way Steve was doing, he never felt so loved and wanted like he did now. His chest was warm with the sensation of being loved.
"We're here, sir." The taxi driver says.
He blinks till his eyes adjust from the lights. Steve comes out of the bathroom buttoning his blue shirt, the same that Tony was folding non-stop last night. The blond's blue eyes met his when Tony is rubbing his eyes, he's still sleepy, he should've slept five hours this night or least.
The soldier sighed a bit frustrated. Then, he smelled the air, his nose twisted with the smell of something burning--
"The idea of me was." Tony is looking around, he seems clumsy, Steve never thought that one day he would think in Tony Stark as clumsy, in fact, he just seems out of his time.
“I believe you have some documents for me,” Natasha said, organizing the paper on her desk and clipping them together. Steve handed her the folder in his hands, which Natasha flipped through. “I’ll give it to Maria after I finish showing you the studio.”
Tony looks at Steve who keeps his blue eyes shut, grimacing because of the car balance. He does not ask if Steve is okay, he is clearly not okay. He got shot, for God's sake!
The doors opened in front of them, three floors later, and Wanda walked out first. Steve followed right after her. He looked around the place with big windows that allowed the magnificent light of the day to peek in. There was a long hallway with doors on the right side. He approached the place where a receptionist was.
The man puts his finger on the trigger again, prepare to pull it again when Tony runs in his direction, hit him and bring him to the ground. The guy struggles while Tony holds him arm aiming the gun to the empty aisle, except for the almost dead-guy shot in the stomach bleeding next to them. Another gunshot is heard and that's the moment where Steve takes the gun out of the bad guy hand pulling Tony next to him and aiming to the man laid on his back on the floor.
"Wait, are you fumbling on my things?" Tony raises a brow incredulously.
Steve waits for Tony in the apartment doorway, while the brunet goes signs whatever paper he needs to and pay the rent in advance to get the keys. He gets back soon with the keys rolling in his fingers, they got in the apartment and Steve closes the door behind him before turns to the billionaire with a grimace.
But now, here they are, cuddling in the couch like happier than ever, and all Steve only could wish that it longs, that they were happy till death do them apart.
Not only Tony and Steve were missing. Clint also hasn't come back, he's gone for forever, sacrificed himself for that damn soul stone in Vormir, there is no going back for him, at least for Steve and Tony she could still have hope, she believes that they can find a way back somehow, after all, she couldn't lose them, too. She is already mourning Clint, she could not handle losing her two other friends. Right?
“Shit,” Tony mumbled. “I’m okay,” he said, seeing Steve’s worried face. “It was just a long day, you know.” Steve nodded, still frightened by Tony’s almost fall. “I should leave the coffee for another time.” Steve couldn’t agree more.“Let’s watch this show,” Tony took a step forward, but his balance still seemed quite uncertain, so Steve just kept his hand next to Tony’s waist and walked closer to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, he didn't." She shrugs nonchalantly, accepting the beer and the sandwich that a guy, a boxer, offers to her.
Steve had commented about this show Bucky could not shut up in the morning with Wanda and Tony. The coffee machine sounded, and Tony reached for two cups, a red one, and another blue one.
Tony stopped suddenly, stumbling and hitting one of the cups against the kitchen counter. Pieces of the blue cup fell all over the place.
They were two hours away from entering San Francisco when Tony suggested grabbing something to eat, after all, they still had to look for someplace to settle in. Steve sighed in frustration after affirm that they could eat as soon as they reach downtown, but Tony denied, insisting him to go. Steve ends up agreeing because he really hasn't seen Tony eating since they left the cafeteria in New Jersey, also because Tony's stomach rumbled.
Tony bits Steve’s bottom lip lightly, which makes Steve grins in return. His thrusts become erratic as Steve approaches the orgasm. Tony gasps, feeling the coil inside him, then Tony’s walls clenched around him when the Omega comes, white, hot seed spilling on their stomachs. Steve licks the cum on Tony’s belly, tasting the bitter flavor of his Omega.
"What happened?" Steve asks, though the situation doesn't need exactly an explanation, but Tony tells him about the five men in the street, not so far from the building, the guy who recognized him from the other night in the pub and assumed, correctly, that he's queer. Steve listens to everything silently, his hands clenched in fists so hard that his knuckles turn white.
It was the first thing that he heard when he got into the apartment. Steve was standing next to the kitchen floor holding a coffee mug. The eyebrows concern told Tony he was in trouble for not prevent the soldier from his little and harmless adventure.
"You're such a spoiler," Tony complains, finally accepting his fate and laying down by the empty and narrow space that Steve makes to him in his bed.
"I need to go," He mutters. "You should get some rest."
"So, what are we gonna do?"
"So, you're planning our date yet?" Steve says stroking Tony's hair.
"Mr. Stark." The man said, immediately Tony recognizes his voice, it was the same who spoke with him on the phone just this morning. "You should've warned us that you'd pay us a visit."
“Good morning, sir. What’s your name?” The woman suddenly asked, making Steve turn around clumsily.
“Hold on, doll,” Steve adds a third finger knowing that that would be enough to not hurt Tony, he thrusts the three fingers getting Tony open to take him. The Omega whimpered when Steve pulled out his fingers, leaving him hollow for a moment before the Alpha lined his cock up to the Omega’s entrance, pushing the head of his cock through Tony’s muscles easily. Steve closes his eyes as Tony takes him all, the wetness and warmness from Tony’s hole too good for Steve, so fucking good. “I’ve got you, doll,” Steve whispered delightedly in Tony’s ear, enjoying the sensation and biting the Omega’s earlobe in tease, giving time for Tony to adjust to his length.
“Don’t tease me,” Steve retorted.
Day 20: Language Kink
“Nops,” Steve snapped.
He missed Clint always complaining about something or someone, and Bruce pacing back and forth in the middle of no matter room, until Steve asks him 'what the hell he was doing in the kitchen or in the gym room', while he mumbles something to himself. And Natasha eating a peanut sandwich while sat on the kitchen counter after a hard afternoon of training or shot practice.
Steve raises his hand to apply pressure on his shoulder where the bullet went through. Tony takes a step forward toward the supersoldier to check his injury, concerned. He feels his chest clenches with the sight and his breath becomes short and fast.
"I give you one and a half," Says the owner.
"I said I had everything under control!" Tony looks up at him, throwing his hand up.
Tony ordered a hot black coffee in the middle of the afternoon, in the summer season, the weather was so fucking hot that it seems insane, Steve don't say anything about it, though he's amused. On the other hand, Steve preferred an iced coffee, he wasn't a huge fan of the beverage, but seen that the only empty shop was the cafeteria, he guessed he didn't have another option. Also, because Tony literally dragged him in the place.
“Have you been in Brooklyn before?” Steve mounts on the bike.
"Fuck," Steve curses when Tony finishes it. Sweat rolling down his temples.
Bruce was waiting on their getaway Quinjet, in case they requested the Hulk or needed to get the hell out of that stupid event as fast as possible if things get too complicated. There’s still Thor, dressed as a waiter, smiling widely as locating possible threats and their targets in the hall. However, the main target is also Steve’s target due to the fact that the leader of this traffic stuff is talking cheerily with Tony.
Bucky placed the fork carefully back on the plate, and leaned closer, almost as if to make sure he had heard correctly.
Steve's eyes wide in shock and horror at the view of Tony covered in blood. He must have fallen, because Steve's arms are wrapped around him, sustaining the weight of his body. Steve lead him to the room sitting him on the bed, taking off his sweatshirt, in the next moment Tony feels his back against the headboard. Every feels blur, he want to succumb to the urgent need to sleep. Steve gets out of his camp of sight and then suddenly he appears again holding a first aid kit.
Steve tries to pull his thoughts together again. None of this was making sense, they already messed this timeline. Tony was right, why Hydra expected that someone would try to steal the Tesseract? Was anyone else behind the cube? Steve knew that Hydra always wanted that stupid cube to make advanced weapons, did they want to start a war again? He would be surprised if it was it. But SHIELD also had the tesseract, he remembers well enough that Nick Fury also wanted to create weapons using the power of the cube. Oh God, that was such a mess, he is not able to think straight right now, so he shuts his eyes tight.
Steve pushes the door and they are welcomed with the sunlight, Steve raises his arm to block his eyes from the sudden light and Tony closes his own. Fresh air invades his lungs, it is almost sweet. They hear sirens still far from here. Steve takes his arm from Tony's waist, taking his hand to his mouth while he coughs. Tony stays still, he opens his eyes to see smoke coming out of the building, a part of it on fire. Damn, they caused a big damage. They always cause a big damage, Tony corrects himself.
Getting back home wasn’t easy for Steve, let alone Bucky who just had lost a limb. His friend was depressed, Steve was suffering from PTSD, they both have constant nightmares, all those aftermaths of their time in Afghanistan or Iraq. Steve dragged Bucky out to the opening of Peggy’s restaurant. That’s where Bucky knew Peggy and she has changed his life since then. Steve was happy for them, and Bucky was about to buy his own house along with Peggy, so Steve obviously was wondering when Bucky would propose to her.
“Hello, punk. You forgot your keys?” Bucky asks, holding up the keychain.
This is enough for Tony. He feels the adrenaline flowing through his veins, in the next moment, he is holding Thomas Pierce by his collar against the wall, a switchblade dangerously close to his carotid.
"Two," Tony smirks. The owner rolls his eyes finally giving in.
"Fuck you." Tony touches his glasses. "You'll only have this over my dead body."
He smiles at this thought while, at the same time, he punched the sandbag in front of him, the chain hanging it from the roof squeaks, protesting against the move.
"Not exactly. It can be easily reduced to one person."
Tony was just tapping on the hologram that his phone projected when Steve traces slowly and carefully the hickey on the crock of his neck, the touch gave Tony goosebumps, and for a second he closed his eyes appreciating the touch.
"You didn't have the briefcase yet, when we were in the elevator."
Despite of it, that wasn’t the biggest problem, now Tony was more susceptible to develop cancer or any others complications in reason of the high level of radiation his body has been exposed, one of them was his right arms nerves being seriously damaged, what took him long sessions of kinesiotherapy. It was exhausting, however, every time he wanted to give up, Steve was by his side. Steve reminded him why he was doing it and that he was still worth it. It took, at least, two months to Tony feels confident to make things by himself using his hand. He needed some daily medications too, which Steve religiously gives to him every morning. Steve was, still is, his strength. He never left him. Then, Morgan came up in their lives, and Tony couldn’t be happier. He has a family now, he has everything.
"Please, tell me we're not discussing this. We've been sharing the same bed in the last days. What difference will make you sleep on the couch?" Tony says pointing to the bed behind him. Steve shrugged, his face turning red. "Also, are you calling me old for not volunteer to sleep on the couch? Because, in case you didn't realize yet, the grandpa here is you." Tony says, an amused smile playing on his lips. Steve smiles too pulling Tony closer to one more kiss.
"I found something, and I'd like to share it with you." She replies, by the confused looks she received, she added. "It's about Steve and Tony."
"Don't look at me like that!" Tony exclaimed. "Didn't your previous experiences as a criminal prepare you for that?" Tony provokes reminding what happened in Germany, the Civil War.
He had been looking for the empty wall in front of him for almost one hour, he glances at Tony who sleeps peacefully by his side, and Steve lets out a sigh before stepping out of the bed searching for his sketchbook that laid on the kitchen counter where Tony had left when he saw the sketch that Steve made of him another day. He catches it and sits on the couch opening in a blank page.
. A genuine smile on her lips. Tony shrugged. "I guess the only two people that don't know you're falling with each other, it's you and Steve," She said, curling her hair.
, Steve thinks. "It's a long story." He finally says sounding uncertain, which makes Peggy lifts a brow questioning.
“I guess I like to stay behind the cameras, ma’am,” Steve replied with a grin.
Tony takes a deep breath, recovering from his outburst. He stares at Steve, getting serious.
“When they know what?” Steve asked, still confused with the course of the conversation. A surprised look appeared on Wanda’s face.
Steve follows Tony to the middle of nowhere, they rented a car and made a 6 hours trip to Malibu carrying the briefcase containing the Tesseract with them, Tony just dragged him there without explaining much.
Inside of the lab, Tony stirs in documents on the table, most of them filled with chemicals instructions and equations, none of them were really finished, so far as Tony read them. The deposit of the Pym particles should be was empty, of course, the alchemist wouldn't let something so powerful, and dangerous if it falls on the wrong hands, exposed, he probably took it with him. Tony opens another drawer, he moves the paper inside carefree, then a light green envelope caught his attention, it was already opened, so Tony read it.
Steve turns his body to face Tony's back and realizes that Tony's sleep seems a little tormented, he was shaking a bit and mumbling something incomprehensible. Steve didn't know if he should wake him up, he probably should, because he doesn't like seeing Tony suffering this way and not doing anything.
Therefore, he snuggles himself against Steve comfortably feeling the supersoldier wraps an arm around him protectively. Steve drops sweet kisses on Tony's back neck and shoulders, cuddling him. The sensation of his lips is marvelous, breathtaking, and Tony just wishes that it never ends.
“Out,” he just needed to say it once before Thor and Bruce rush out and Bruce closes the door as best as he could with the broken knob. Steve turns his attention back to Tony, his eyes checking Tony’s body once again looking for any injuries, but the Omega seems fine. “You’re hot,” Steve says, frowning and noticing for the first time that Tony’s skin is warm under his hands, the strong, accentuated mint scent filling Steve’s nostrils, and making his body react immediately if the bulge in his pants is any indication. “Heat. You’re in heat, Tony.”
Natasha chuckles. Of course, Tony would replace them, he always did, he knew it and so did Natasha. He wasn't so obvious, was he? What if... she knows about it? A shiver passes through Tony's spine.
Tony distracts himself from watching the movie over the kitchen counter, he lost complete track of time. Food is ready. He glances at the clock on the counter, an hour had passed, his eyes focus back on the TV to see the final credits.
They take a shortcut back. Well, guess they are ordering takeout after all. Steve doesn't let go of Tony's hand all the way back, they shouldn't be holding hands in public, the tight grip on his hand showed that Steve was still mad, even though Tony didn't understand why or who. The blond keeps looking behind and Tony followed his gaze, no one was following them, at the corner of the street they heard the sirens when two police car passed through them going straight to the grocery store.
"I love you, Tony." He whispers facing Tony passionately. There's lust and love deep inside of those blue eyes. Tony strokes Steve's cheek affectionately with a smile on his face.
"Who told you that?" Tony asked glancing back to his work. He can feel the widow's gaze heavy observing him.
The blond watches him, his blue eyes taking a good look from Tony's behind, a provoking smirk on his face, the brunet was teasing and leading the soldier to the edge. Steve follows the brunet, locking the door. Tony was playing dirty with him, but thankfully in this game, two can play.
Yet, Steve wasn’t sure where knowing all these things about Tony put him to. They've spent an amount of time together, but were they dating? Steve had absolutely no idea how to put it. He knows he should probably ask Tony, there was nothing wrong in asking, right?
Hey, everyone! I forgot to update last week and I didn't want to mess the schedule, so I decided I'd only update this Thursday. Turns out, I'm reading a really good book and I totally forgot again. Anyway, it's Friday, so here it is.
Steve follows his way, he needed to find out where Hank Pym's laboratory was, so he could get the particles they needed to go back to 2023. He walks reading the names on the door, Armin Zola, Howard Stark, names he already knew, and a few others that he had never listened to, then he found it.
"Did you drink?"
Breakfast is eerily quiet. Sometimes, Steve asks him if he knows what to do if the situation got complicated, he answers calmly each question. Tony knows that Steve is doing it to keep him away from his own toxic, self-loathing and destructive thoughts. He can't blame the blond for an attempt, also it's a good way to repass the steps on his mind.
“Huh. Steve Rogers,” he replied. He observed as she tapped and searched for something on the computer in front of her. Then, she opened a smile.
“Sparkle water is fine,” Tony interrupted.
Thank you for all of you who read this story, it was nice to write this during the last three months, I hope y'all enjoyed it. Thanks for all the kudos and comments!
Tony crawls until he reaches the wall next to him, leaning on it for some support to get on his feet. He grunts with every move, holding his stomach and spitting an amount of blood. He stares to the corner in front of his, it's just a few steps he says to himself trying to gather his forces to makes his way back home, each step sending a painful wave on his body, he feels like he's going to faint every second, but he convinces himself that he can make it. He's an Avenger, after all, he fought Thanos, a bunch of robots, a Chitaury army, he certainly can make a few steps forward.
Pym Technologies seems unusually crowded today, and Tony notices it from the hall, some workers were decorating the place, which makes Tony thinks that maybe they would be celebrating soon, or it also could be an event to inform and update their interns about the newest techs that were presented in the congress Hank Pym attended.
As soon as Steve stopped his bike in front of the nightclub, he felt anxious. All he wanted to do was to turn around and go home. The façade glowed with neon lights, too painful for the eyes if you looked at them for too long. The song vibrated inside, and in his ears, shaking the sidewalk where he was still holding the helmet, thinking, and rethinking if he really wanted to go inside.
“You’re okay?” Tony asks, then Steve glances upwards to find his eyes.
There's an urge in their kiss, but it's needy at the same time. Steve holds Tony's head with his big hands, deepening the kiss, while Tony's hands are holding his hips with a firm grasp. Tony bits Steve's bottom lip, which makes the supersoldier smiles before they tear apart to catch their breath. Although, Steve keeps dropping down kisses on Tony's neck and shoulder.
“I-I’m so sorry.” He apologizes for having doubts about Tony’s change of behavior.
"You're right, we can't carry it everywhere with Hydra behind us."
As soon as Natasha walked away, Wanda popped up on his side, a huge grin on her face.
Tony rubs his hard cock over the pants on Steve's, the friction makes the supersoldier moans loud. He lets go of the brunet's hands, moving his own hands to unbuckle Tony's belt and getting him rid of the pants that Tony was still wearing.
"Just a... bad feeling," Tony answers shrugging.
Basically, they have spent the day over the building floor plan, distracted, and making a plan to get the Pym particles as soon as Hank will be back and leave the building without being noticed. They would need to be discreet and get a disguise to get in, after that, they would have to find a way to reach the labs. It'll work. It has to. Steve assured him.
"Because..." Steve begins, then he sighs painfully. "Because you were in a relationship with Pepper. Then, when you broke up, Sokovia happened." It was curious how destiny was always fooling them, it seems like the whole universe was conspiring against them and any chance of them getting happy. "Also, you were a playboy, Tony, how was I supposed to know that you are bisexual?" Steve adds and Tony blushes, that's the second time Steve makes him blush in less than 24 hours, it should be some kind of record.
“You can have fun without drinking,” Steve retorted.
Tony sighs, completely overwhelmed by the view of it. Okay, that's far from unexpected. It definitely wasn't supposed to happen, none of this was supposed to happen, actually, Tony had put them through this, but right now he has no time to regret it. They both know there is no solution to find here, with the technology available in the seventies Tony is not able to make another one, or even test the safety of it if he succeed to recreate it one day.
"Okay, then what? Who's going to snap it?" Scott asks. "That thing is powerful." He throws his hands on the air looking exasperate.
Since he came back from war, Steve carried that feeling of being lost. His therapist used to call it ‘survivor guilt’ for those who died in the field whilst he got to go back to his small family. He was allowed to be someone again. Though, the sensation of inadequacy kept hovering on him. Would he be able to have an ordinary conversation with someone again? Would he even be able to feel comfortable around someone again? Steve hoped so because he didn’t know what he would do if he didn’t.
Steve held the portfolio against his chest and fixed the bag he was carrying to a nice posture. He went straight to a counter where an attendant was on the phone. He waited patiently looking around the place. The lobby was large, it looked comfortable and modern at the same time. There weren’t many people there at this hour of the day. Steve supposed that everyone was in their offices, preparing and doing the models’ makeup for a day of photoshoots, getting clothes done, drawing new designs, ruling the new collection, or calculating the profit,  this kind of thing.
