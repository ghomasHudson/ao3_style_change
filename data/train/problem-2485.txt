Sherlock stared at her. “I think… I believe he was just lonely. Grief. He just lost his wife, and was looking for some comfort, and I was there…” he shrugged. “It wasn’t a big deal.”
John stopped for a moment and thought about that. Sherlock had trekked ten miles to John’s isolated cabin in the snow and hadn’t brought anything with him except what might have been in his pockets. It was very odd.
But Molly couldn’t tell him. She just couldn’t. Because if there was a chance that Anna could do what she said she could, to finish Moriarty once-and-for-all, then Molly had to help her. “Oh, nothing. It’s just that things are so different among young people these days...  seems like none of them are normal teenagers anymore.”
That’s what he wanted me to say. But my chest was shaking so badly that I couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t even breathe. It was suddenly too warm in the flat, too fucking
“After Sherlock figured out what happened, he insisted on having a stake-out to confirm his theory that McMurdo was selling the drugs. He didn’t tell me until several days later, but apparently the ex-fighter caught him and nearly choked the life out of him. Luckily Scotland Yard got there just in time, but Sherlock seemed… I suppose the word is ‘traumatized.’ He came home that morning, burst into the flat with this frantic look on his face, I remember because I was feeding Anna at the table and we both froze right in our seats. He took one look at Annalise and she immediately put her arms in the air for him to pick her up—like she knew, you know? He held her tight for quite some time, and she let him, the lovely girl. Didn’t fuss, just rested there while he held her.” Mrs. Hudson’s eyes were shining, and she smiled through her tears.
Sherlock stood up angrily, the stool scraping the floor and teetering as he left its seat. He whirled on John. “What did you find out about the boat?”
Sherlock stood up again and put both cuppas on the small folding table next to the window. He got down two bowls and two plates from the shelf and asked if the soup was done. John glanced back at it and saw it was steaming through the lid he’d placed on the top at an angle and said it was. Sherlock went and took it from the stove with a towel wrapped around the handles and set it on the counter. He divided the soup evenly into the bowls and set these on the table as well with a spoon in each. The eggs were done now too so John plated them and brought them over and the two of them sat down to eat.
Especially with David.
Anna closed her eyes and cried, feeling as if the world had broken open and swallowed her whole.
John just looked at him. “What do you want me to say?”
“Precisely.”
Molly looked at him softly. “Your grave, John.”
Anna took a deep breath and let it out slowly.
“Okay.” John let out a breath of relief. At least they were getting somewhere. “Can you stand up, for me?” He stood himself, and reached out with his open palms to help Sherlock along.
Mrs. Hudson had rolled her eyes. “Oh that doesn’t matter. You’ve got a fascinating job—you work with dead bodies! The children will be hanging onto your every word, and they won’t care if you’re her parent or not.”
“Holmes,” said Sherlock. He stuck out his hand. “Sherlock Holmes.”
“If you
“Sherlock! There’s a storm!” John shouted louder this time, thinking he might not have heard him at first. But Sherlock kept walking and John’s heart hammered in his chest. John dropped the wheelbarrow and started after him. “Stop! What the hell are you doing?”
Emotions were so messy, so debilitating, and he knew that, had known it ever since he was a child. He supposed his resolve started to break down the moment he met John Watson.
John gave her a small smile, then turned and walked toward the window. It had started to rain outside, and it was just light enough to see the trees swaying and bending with the quickening wind. Their images blurred as raindrops coated the glass.
“That was it then,” he said, his voice oddly strained. “She must have decided to give it all up for a life with you.”
, John thought.
Sherlock sat up. His neck felt stiff, his head heavier than normal, eyes puffy and crusted-over from crying.
“So, let me get this straight,” said Molly. “You are training to be a spy for the British government, through the instigation of Mycroft Holmes.”
Just then, the door opened and Carruthers stepped through, followed by a short, slight man with a thick, black beard.
. “Here,” said John’s voice. “Sit up.” He set a glass of apple juice into my hands. (Since when did I have apple juice? Must have been Mrs. Hudson, I certainly hadn’t bought it. I hated apple juice.) I took a sip. “We’ll have to get you some orange,” John said.
“Would you mind releasing my shirt?”
“I didn’t do anything!” Mycroft retorted. “I didn’t brainwash her, I didn’t teach her to kill. We only ever did self defense and basic weapons training. I’ll admit, she had no qualms about harming other people…”
“Alright,” Mary nodded in response.
His eyes grew icy. “No, I don’t
“What’s the matter?” Sherlock asked, suspiciously.
“Monday,” he said instead, clenching his hands into fists at his sides. “I’ll be there.”
Mrs. Hudson finally came back up the stairs, brandishing a plastic bottle. “Here you are! I knew I had it somewhere.” She handed him a bottle of sunscreen that looked as if it had survived the Cold War.
John paid special attention to both of his balls, continuously working his hand on Sherlock’s shaft, slowly, sensually. Controlled. The way Sherlock liked it.
John shifted his gaze to Sherlock’s face. The man had most certainly grown older, his forehead a mess of wrinkles under his curls, the skin on his cheekbones not quite as creamy or smooth as it once was. His dark hair was flecked with gray. John found himself wondering how much of Sherlock’s aging had been brought about by raising a child; he could imagine that that sort of thing might age one rapidly. In the six months he’d spent with Anna after she was born, he could most definitely see how that might happen.
John watched him as they walked. “You know, you can always give me a ring, if you need my help on a case. You know, my expertise.”
, he thought to himself.
colored her hair. It was very dark, almost black, but she kept it bleach-blond and cropped short.
“Two weeks is too long,” Sherlock murmured, undoing his own belt as John slid his hands under his shirt and over his bare chest.
was all she said.
It became a sort of game I played with him, after. I’d test him to see just how far he would go for me. He’d done all sorts of ridiculous things, but I hadn’t known it was because he loved me. Admiration, hero worship, even friendship. But not love. Love had never crossed my mind.
“I’ll take that as a ‘yes,’ then,” John said, opening the door wider and climbing into the seat. He shut the door and turned to face him. “So,” he started, then stopped. “Hi.” He made what Sherlock assumed was an attempt at a smile.
“A total wanker?” John supplied, with a smile.
“You wish I was actually dead, then?” John accused, raising his voice.
I watched her carefully. I was a little shocked. My mother had always maintained, throughout my entire life, that the choice she made to be with my father and to have children was one that was deliberate.
His breath, hot, on my ear. “Tell you what?”
he thought to himself.
John’s hand slammed down on the lid of the computer, and I pulled my fingers back just in time. “You’re not seriously talking about a case right now.”
, Ella.”
. He wouldn’t allow himself to hope. Anna was
Something about his voice, the softness and concern there, made Anna feel like a child again, and her bottom lip began to tremble. No, she wasn’t alright. She’d been lied to, manipulated, made to kill people, people she
“When you said I ‘didn’t have to do that.’” He passed round the edge of the table and stood in front of the next body. “I thought you meant, kiss him. I thought you were upset that I kissed him in front of you, as if you thought I was trying to show you that I was clearly over you.”
“No.” The detective faced him completely now. “
Soon after, Anna collapsed, exhausted, in a comfy chair, and watched through dreamy vision (some of the brandy
One of the guards knelt down. “What the hell? How in the—how did you get in there?”
The second time John tried to break up with him, he’d chosen a public place. Sherlock realized (with a brief feeling of self-satisfaction) that John had been worried about being physically distracted again. Unfortunately, Sherlock hadn’t deduced that—nor the fact that John had brought him there to end things—until it was already happening.
Slowly, Sherlock spidered his fingers up the front of her and hooked them in the delicate elastic of her knickers. He heard a whimper from above his head and looked up to see Molly staring down at him, her chest heaving with her rapid breath, her expression caught between a smile and a sob. “Do you want this, Molly?” he asked, his voice rumbling deep and sultry in his chest. “Do you want me to taste you?”
“What hit? What are you talking about?”
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this was what had become of me. I’d been reduced to a sodding pile of caring and insecurity and abject
For some reason, John sniggered. “And that’s the first thing that comes to mind? How short are we talking?”
They stared at each other. “I don’t know what would become of me if something happened to her,” confessed Sherlock. “Truly, I don’t.” He looked out the window again, concern written in every wrinkle on his face. “We’re running out of time. We have to figure out what Mary wants.” Suddenly, he banged a fist on the windowsill, making John jump back.
a spy, after all.”
. That’s what you must see, must see always—that no matter what you do, or what you become, it is for one purpose: to rid the world of a terrible enemy.” His eyes had a faraway look for a moment, but then he blinked and looked back at her.
Sherlock looked at him, bewildered that anyone could be concerned with anything other than the fact that John had just been blown to bits. “I…” he began, his voice thick with crying. He whispered, as if not quite believing his own answer, “I gave it to John.”
Sherlock sighed and nodded reluctantly at the countertop.
I looked down into the dregs of my juice. “Not exactly.”
Sherlock clearly expected that revelation to elicit a profound reaction on John’s part, but, of course, John had nothing to show. “What?”
“God I missed you,” Sherlock breathed, sticking a hand down John’s trousers.
lucky,” as in, John was lucky, too, to have Sherlock living with him again. There was an awkward pause, and John glanced from face to face trying to decide if—
If John only
Sherlock searched Major Sholto’s face, his eyebrows drawn over his eyes in puzzlement. “Tell him… what?”
“I know you’ve been sleeping with Mary again,” Sherlock told him, as a matter of fact (not technically intercourse, but blow jobs—still sex), “and it hasn’t destroyed
John looked up. It was one thing to chop wood and to build a fire in a stove but it was quite another to milk an animal. Milking was a delicate skill, John had learned it from the man that had sold him the cow. The man had taken one look at him and knew that he did not know how to.
comment began to ring about in his head. “No! No, nothing like that. We’re fine. Great. I mean, we’re great. Very much in love. Couldn’t be happier.”
The next morning, John dragged himself into the living room, terribly hung over and on edge. He made it over to his chair by the fireplace and sat down, heavily, his hands massaging his pounding head. Sherlock came over from the kitchen and set a cuppa next to him, then went back to the table and opened his laptop. “Interesting case came through this morning,” he said. “Two men dead, in completely different parts of the city, but both—“
Sherlock smiled again and John waited for him to get on his trousers and boots and coat and hat and gloves so that they could go out to the barn. John was still very skeptical about the whole thing and thought Sherlock was bluffing this time. He was prepared to be amused by his failure. When they got to the barn he stood at the door to her stall with his arms folded and watched.
He saw John’s eyes blink back tears. “I won’t, Sherlock. Of course I won’t.”
“Yes, honestly,” Anna echoed, setting the tea down on the coffee table. “You’d make a terrible spy, Molly.”
I shook my head. “I don’t know.”
“Borderline disastrous” would have probably been a more accurate description.
And I
The teacher tutted. “Jeremy, that would not be appropriate! Of course Mr. Holmes doesn’t have pictures.”
“Hmmm,” John hummed. “Do you want to know what I was thinking about?” He reached up to stroke my thigh.
“Well,” I began. “I suppose I didn’t know any different.”
“Please give my love to John and Mary, and the baby, of course,” said the Major, putting his hat back on his head. “I’ll come visit another time.”
But in the real world, there are strings. There are loads of them. In the real world there are uncomfortable backseats to cars, or hard shelving of broom cupboards digging into your spine; there is cold air, sweaty skin that sticks to itself and to others’ and makes the most unappealing noises; there is bad breath, there are teeth, there are… distractions. Too many distractions. It’s not a controlled environment, it’s not predictable, it’s not,
“So,” said Anna, her smile returning to its previous warmth. “Are you coming to the cemetery?”
your father. It’s nothing but a… an exercise in imagination, for you. But…” Sherlock took a deep breath, steeling himself for the truly uncomfortable part, “it would mean a lot to me if you went. Because if you are there with me, Anna, I’m… I’ll be…
John wondered, watching them.
“No, Mary,” he said. “I won’t lie.”
But the snows had only started and the electricity was working so John could shower every night still. Although his water heater was small and it heated slowly, so Sherlock would not get to bathe until the morning if John showered tonight. He felt a little badly about it because Sherlock had done most of the wood chopping, and that was harder work than John had done wrapping the pipes and caring for the animals. “Would you like to shower?” John asked, making a decision.
Carruthers nodded. “Yes, well… she was nervous, of course, it
Molly Hooper was standing directly in front of him, wearing one of his shirts—and nothing else—holding a tray of fresh-baked biscuits. “Mycroft told me you’d be back tonight,” she said, her cheeks growing slightly pink.
John had always been so keen on following ridiculous social customs like that.
John was so upset that he didn’t speak for a full five seconds. “That’s what you think? That I’m—I’m—Christ, Sherlock. This isn’t fair. You’re punishing me, and it’s not fair. I didn’t
“Yes?” He looked up at me, through his long eyelashes. The image of his face there, right next to my penis, finished the job of hardening it up.
Mycroft’s foot pressed all the way to the floor. The engine roared and the boat sliced through the water like a torpedo, catching huge amounts of air as it was launched over the waves.
Snowflakes were falling softly outside the windows of 221B, collecting on the outer sills in miniature drifts. “Look, Anna,” said Sherlock, bouncing a nine-month-old baby in his arms. He turned his back toward the window so she could stare at the snow over his shoulder. He watched as her eyes looked out at the flakes, studying them, and he reduced his bounce to a slight sway.
Sherlock looked at him, no trace of humor in his expression. “She’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”
The water rose and became warmer, not quite reaching hot. There wasn’t enough hot water in the tank to fill an entire tub so some cold water was mixed in. But that was good. Too hot too quickly would be dangerous. Once the tub was full John sat up stiffly and managed to reach far enough to switch the taps off. He leaned back again as gently as he could and tightened his arms around Sherlock as he felt him begin to shiver again. That was also good. “That’s it,” John said into the warming flesh of Sherlock’s back. “You’re doing so good.” He felt Sherlock’s hand slide up to grasp his arm.
“Of course I would, you daft git,” Sherlock scolded him, annoyed. “You’re the love of my life.”
“This is right, you and me,” he continued. He pushed himself off the counter and came toward me. “I know you don’t see it now, but you will. So I’ll wait. I’ll wait as long as it takes.”
It was good, old-fashioned revenge.
John’s face was sad again. “I thought I’d go to Molly’s, see if she’ll put me up until I can find a place.” He glared sideways at Sherlock.
.” He scratched his head again. I feared he was going to give himself a bald spot. “You were talking about me, weren’t you?”
John stared at him intently, still smiling a little, still looking a little too pleased with himself. “Say ‘please,’ Sherlock. That’s all you have to do.” He studied the tip of Sherlock’s erection, where a bit of precum had surfaced. He used the pad of his thumb to smear it around. Sherlock writhed and moaned again, marveling at how John could turn him into putty beneath his hands—it was wonderful and annoying and frightening, all at the same time.
Mycroft sighed. “Sherlock, I’m sorry you’ve lost faith in her, but I have not. I still believe she will help us destroy Moriarty.”
“Sherlock,” was his only reply.
“You’re bisexual, not gay,” Sherlock began, cross with himself for missing it before. He always missed the bisexual ones. “You’re an exhibitionist, and your wife is a voyeur… Nothing
“Go anyway.”
John raised his eyebrows.
. And pretend that John hadn’t pulled away so soon, that he’d kissed back again. Pretend they’d gotten hungrier for it, John threading his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock sliding his arms around John’s waist, their lips parting to touch tongues, just a bit—
cases, how many
“Apology accepted,” Molly said, begrudgingly.
We fell asleep together after that. For a few hours anyway, until John shifted and it woke me, and I looked at the time on the clock. “John.” I shook him, and he grunted. “John, it’s twelve-thirty.” I sat up and switched on the lamp.
In the midst of John’s retreating footsteps, Lestrade looked both ways before stepping back inside the door. He stood in the center of the hall, the gun and knife in his hands, calming his breathing.
“Precisely.” He held out his hand for change.
Sherlock’s parents, Molly Hooper, and Greg Lestrade were already sitting down to eat. It was a bit cramped in the flat, but Sherlock had insisted they have Christmas dinner there—it would be better for Anna to be somewhere familiar so that she wouldn’t be overwhelmed with all those people around. Really, Anna loved the attention; the more people, the better. Sherlock just didn’t want to pack up and haul all of the gear that babies needed whenever they left their homes.
If I was obsessive about things before, it was nothing compared to now. By the time he arrived I would be in complete agony, so keyed up that all I needed was for him to brush up against me, for one or two quick strokes of his hand down my pants. I couldn’t sleep (and believe me, I wanted to, after all the physical activity). I wasn’t hungry (John had already had to use sex as a bargaining chip for me to eat a proper meal). Nothing else in the world mattered, nothing at all. It was terrible and wonderful all at once.
He reached down and pulled the blanket over Sherlock’s toes.
“It’s simple, really,” said Sherlock, un-narrowing his eyes and smiling subtly.
He looked at John’s hands, stuck in the pockets of his bomber jacket. That’s what he should have done,
“Yes, Anna. Your mother lied.” Mycroft’s expression was stony. “No surprise there.”
“Sacrifice?” Mycroft echoed. “Does that involve asphyxiating one with one’s own genitals?”
Sherlock turned to whine at John.
. “Stop!” he moaned, his eyes spilling tears down the side of his face, over the bridge of his nose, lubricating the surface of the table against his cheek.
“Romantic,” Sherlock drawled. Then he suddenly looked uncomfortable. “What, now?”
“Don’t,” interrupted John, not looking up. He shook his head a little. “Just… don’t say anything. Please. For a moment.”
John huffed a laugh. “Well, you decided that, I just went along for the ride. But yeah. I remember.”
When the ice broke and the dog fell through, it was so quick that John thought he’d imagined it. He’d imagined it and the dog would come running out of the forest with its tongue lapping happily at the air on the side of its mouth. But he heard the splashing and saw the dog’s head bob above the hole in the ice and he knew it was true. The dog had fallen through the ice and it was going to die. The water was cold and deep and the dog would not be able to get its footing to climb out. The ice was not yet thick and would keep breaking off until the dog tired and drowned.
“Yeah,” said John in reply. “Hi. Uh… hi. Apparently Mycroft forgot to mention I’d be with him…” he trailed off.
“Oh, he only does that to keep himself occupied, darling,” said Sherlock’s mother dismissively. “He’s got such an intelligent, busy mind. But this thing, with you… well...”
“So it must be someone who works here,” said John. He stood up and grinned at me. “That makes things a bit easier, eh?” He was teasing me, the arsehole. His smile was gorgeous. I was going to have to punish him, later. I thought about the ways in which I could do that. I pulled my coat tighter around my waist.
John saw the giant move in his direction, getting ready for the next blow. “Look away, Sherlock,” he managed to say, his voice hoarse. “Don’t watch. Close your eyes, don’t—“

call!”
“John!” Lestrade yelped, running to try the handle—which was indeed stuck. Lestrade grabbed it and threw the side of his body into the door, trying to force it open. It didn’t budge.
Suddenly, a spotlight hit the little boat and there came a roar of an engine. Anna put up a hand to shield her eyes. “
“She’s tall enough,” interrupted John. “And she’s going to drive us safely to the top.”
that was what she was doing. As it turned out, she was really working for the most intelligent and sinister criminal this country has ever had the misfortune of knowing.”
John was silent for a moment, his brain tingling with curiosity. “I wonder what it is?”
Sherlock pulled out his mobile and dialed Mycroft. “We have a situation,” he said into the phone, his eyes never leaving John. “I’m going to need an extraction. Yes, for two. No. No, someone… else. Just bloody get here!” He hung up the phone. “Mycroft is coming.”
“That I won’t... be any good at it.” I looked down, as if I were ashamed.
John swung his legs round the side of the bed and stood up slowly. He was wearing flannel pajama bottoms and a Hard-Rock Café (New York) t-shirt (gift from his sister, years ago). Both garments would have been in the bottom dresser drawer, the one that he never used… John blinked. Did Sherlock…
, he thought.
, Lestrade thought.
“I want to,” said John. He reached for me. “You don’t know how much I want to.”
“Since when?”
John’s body immediately surrendered to his touch. “Oh, Jesus, Sherlock. You can’t fucking
Lestrade, meanwhile, had continued to fail at opening the door. “John, what the hell are you doing?” he yelled into the microphone. “Just kill the bastard and let’s go!”
“That’s preposterous,” said Sherlock evenly. But his eyes were smiling.
“Tell me you want it again.”
“Sherlock,” said Mrs. Hudson, her worried eyes shining. The baby gummed her own fist and stared curiously at him, in the chair. “What are we going to do?”
. And Sherlock shifted his face up towards John’s, and John kissed his forehead, his temple, his tear-soaked cheek, his lips.
Sherlock hadn’t kissed him or said I love you in the night. He was back in London, or somewhere else for all that John knew. He had not searched for John’s daughter and he had not found her playing in a park. He had not come to the cabin with proof to ask John to come home. John’s daughter was dead. She had been shot by his wife, four years ago.
“Let him do what, Mrs. Hudson?” Sherlock’s voice asked in a monotone, bored sort of way.
I spat again, wetting my cock, and gripped his hips, and pushed in.
look. He knew that one, too. “Let’s not get too carried away,” Sherlock told her, awkwardly giving her a pat on the back. “I haven’t found her, yet.”
The little girl nodded, then looked back up at him. “Will you buy me a chocolate bar?”
But I didn’t. John clearly had no inhibitions when it came to having sex with me, even though I was a man. I’d have to ask him about it sometime. Sometime, when we actually had a civilized conversation about this whole thing. Which was not going to be right now.
Mycroft cleared his throat and uncrossed his legs, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees.
“Yeah, but not until ages later.”
cry. That was an unknown. Perhaps.
tension, anyway. But instead, the words caught on Sherlock’s tongue and somehow got twisted around, morphed into a combination of words he couldn’t remember ever saying to another person:
to hurt Sherlock.” Moriarty sighed fondly at the memories. “It didn’t matter that it wasn’t true. We were gone before anyone found out that I was lying. But Anna,” he said with an amused chuckle, “I am most certainly not your father.”
“But—“
I chose the latter. It was easier to give him what he wanted than to explain why I didn’t want it too.
, etcetera, etcetera.
“Ok,” John murmured, softly. “Ok.”
“You’re welcome. Good luck!” She walked off, her friend hanging onto her arm and whispering in her ear.
“John—“
you Plan B should have been Plan A from the beginning.”
There’d better not be all those horrid pictures this time—“
will be going free.”
“Know what?”
John took a deep breath, deciding something. “They could never find out,” he said, on exhale.
And then Molly remembered something Sherlock had said on the roof of St. Bart’s a few days earlier. That if Mycroft was apprised of the hit on Anna, he would probably use Anna as bait.
Sherlock adjusted the volume and then turned back to John and Anna. He took off his coat and scarf with flourish as the music started, tossing them delicately onto the couch. “I’ve been waiting for a case like this,” he said, to no one in particular. Then he held out his hands with a sharp, “Give her to me,” and John, completely out of his element, handed over the poor wailing child. Without a moment’s hesitation, Sherlock settled her in his arms and began to dance around the living room
He tried to speak, but no sound would come out of him.
A half laugh, half sob escaped John’s lips. He shook his head. “And here I thought you were the most selfish human being on the planet. But really, you were just the opposite.” He smeared all the tears back to his hairline with his open palms. “My God. The
I’d had just enough social etiquette to ask her to ice cream before propositioning her. I’d read that chocolate was an aphrodisiac so I’d ordered it for her and watched her eat it, every last bit. And as soon as she was done, I’d asked her whether she cared to become intimate in the backseat of my mother’s car.
“Only once, so far, but I’m sure if given the chance he would love to put those long fingers around my neck…” Moriarty trailed off, then licked his lips and continued. “So, Mycroft told you I was your real father, and you came running to Papa. Upset you’ve been lied to your entire life? Looking for the family that you never had? Or wanting the freedom to… kill?” He stepped closer to her, staring into her eyes. “You
Mrs. Smith blinked at him, surprised, and then hopped up to pull him into a hug. “Oh, thank you, thank you, bless you!”
Sherlock found his voice. “You may stay in my room.”
“Oh, well, of course!” John exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, his voice suddenly dripping with sarcasm. “Glad you cleared that up for me.” He dropped the act, then, and shook his head in disbelief. “What the hell, Sherlock? What the
Sherlock didn’t say anything.
The teacher looked a little taken aback. “Oh, alright. Everyone, this is Mr. Holmes—say ‘Hello, Mr. Holmes.’”
“Harry,” she corrected, still fixated on the little girl. She didn’t even bother asking who Sherlock was, clearly she already knew. “Is that the kid?”
“Don’t say ‘normal,’” Sherlock warned, surprised at how cold his voice sounded. “Don’t. I may not be an expert when it comes to things of this nature, but whatever is going on here… it’s not normal. Not for me.”
There was a screech of door hinges, and Molly appeared, juggling three cups of coffee. “Ah, I see you two are looking better,” she said, brightly. “Any new developments?”
Sherlock said nothing in reply.
“It’s a serious ailment.” He began to smile, and I was getting more and more skeptical by the second.
. Sherlock had tripped over himself, heading toward the figure, they’d headed toward each other, they’d met, they’d—
Sherlock’s open mouth curves into a smile.
John’s blood boiled.
“Mycroft,” John spoke, looking up from his knees.
Molly woke with a start as Sherlock banged the front door open in frustration. He hadn’t been able to track down Anna or Mycroft in the last twenty-four hours, hadn’t even had a lead. He stomped over to his chair by the fireplace and collapsed in it.
clean…. “Quite different in here from how it was before,” he remarked. “No experiments, no body parts… Sherlock must be very busing solving crimes.”
“Ugh, I dunno.” John was losing patience… and wondering how Sherlock was keeping his.
, Sherlock reasoned.
They sat in silence then, for a moment. Of all the times Sherlock had dreamed of seeing John again, of all the things he thought he’d say, the pleas, the threats, the tears—this scenario had not crossed his mind. None of those things he’d said in his head seemed appropriate, anymore. He wasn’t sure how to feel about this… wasn’t sure if he
Sherlock nodded. Anna had said the same thing.
“They nearly always do,” Sherlock concurred, disdainfully.
Sherlock knew enough to know he shouldn’t contact them. He shouldn’t call, or text, or go to their house, shouldn’t try to explain. He’d just make the whole thing worse if he did; that much he knew. But his imagination had gone berserk in the last twenty hours, imagining how
He asked John to turn on the radio during the ride back to Baker Street. John had hesitated, but complied without question—
“Want to try again?”
still going with the plan. “And put your hands behind your heads, all three of you.”
“The fishing boat. The one that sunk with the teenage girl.”
The other man shook his head. “Sherlock, do not pretend you are above what they did. Do not pretend that there is some ‘sacrifice for the greater good’ that drives you to do
He sighed, now, and lifted his finger to ring the doorbell.
I threaded my fingers through the hair on the crown of his head. “I want you to suck me.”
“Believe me,” growled John, “I’m not, but not because I don’t want to.”
But Mrs. Hudson was right—despite all of his efforts, Anna didn’t care about John Watson.
Sherlock thought about Major Sholto, living away in isolation, lonely, regretting his life, regretting not knowing. That’s why he told Sherlock to say something, because the not knowing… that was the worst part.
“Sherlock, hurry up!” It was Lestrade, he’d flipped up his face shield and was running toward them.
Against every single one of his rules regarding male fashion, Sherlock put on jeans. He’d purchased them online (wouldn’t dare risk getting caught buying them in a shop), and when Mrs. Hudson signed for the package, she’d tottered up the stairs in bewilderment and held it out for Sherlock to see. “Did you buy something from…
“No, it’s not—“ Sherlock sighed and let his head thump against the door in defeat. “I have an erection.”
Mycroft’s eyes bulged in fear, and he was unable to speak. He dropped his umbrella on the ground and moved his arms up to try to push Sherlock off of him, but Sherlock avoided his feeble attempts.
Come on. Think fast.
Sherlock let out a large sigh and glanced again around Anna’s room, the sight of it threatening to give him more unwelcome feelings. He quickly closed the door and went back downstairs.
“Sounds like them,” Sherlock grumbled.
“Look, Annalise.” They heard Sherlock’s voice boom from the sitting room. “This one’s a
“And, she’s beautiful,” Sherlock added.
“What are you doing in there?”
“No,” said Sherlock, bluntly. “You hate babies.”
Perhaps that was his mistake. He should have deleted it, or at least tried to, because the dreams it prompted that night had left him in turmoil.
“He challenged me,” I began. “Not because he was smarter than me—please—but because he never let me get away with anything.”
“For punching you in the face.”
John turned his confused gaze back toward the criminal.
And that’s when he saw John’s shirt.
Sherlock smiled a little, remembering the afternoons of his endless chatter all those years ago, John sitting there, listening to it, enthralled by his brilliance. He turned back to John’s grave, staring at it some more. He stepped up to the stone and put his gloved fingers on it, tracing the word “Friend.”
how many times Sherlock had got hard at the thought of this happening. How many times he’d brought himself to climax thinking about it, just the kissing. Oh, he’d thought about other things too, of course he had, but the kissing alone could do it for him. And even simpler things could do it for him, on his really horny days—for instance, John being in the shower. Sherlock couldn’t count the number of times he’d been in his bedroom and heard John get into the shower and had masturbated, quietly as he could, laying back on his bed, thinking about John’s body under the hot running water.
tell him to stop. Now that they’d started this “thing,” whatever it was, Sherlock couldn’t imagine it ending. It had only been two weeks, but he didn’t think they could go back to whatever they’d been before. Their relationship had been suffering, anyway, ever since Sherlock returned from his two years away, so to end this thing—it would end
John glanced over from the driver’s seat. “What about?”
“Okay, okay. Hey. Sherlock.”
In my dreams, I am burning.
?” he’d asked, and then immediately realized that was not even on the top
“You’d think that, but you wouldn’t have recognized him. That child could do no wrong. Honestly, if she’d kept up that ‘Polly’ business, I’ll wager Sherlock would have ordered me to legally change my name.”
“It was a fake,” she said. She’d realized it later, after she’d been captured, after learning what Mycroft had done to get to it. There was absolutely no way that Sherlock would let him win, after that; the treasure they pulled out of the sea
“Oh God,” Molly moaned, this time more than audibly, and Sherlock heard a
Together they made several trips and brought the wood to the woodshed along the side of the house and stacked it tall until it reached the ceiling. Then John shut the door and wheeled the remaining half-barrow full up to the house. He opened the front door and stepped inside, taking off his shoes in the entryway. “Come on,” he said to Sherlock, who was still standing outside and watching him. “Before we let too much heat out.” The house was only heated by the stove, and while wood was not scarce it was time consuming and exhausting to prepare and John was not keen to waste any of it.
If she truly thought about it, Moriarty wasn’t really going to let two of them go “scot-free.” He was a liar, toying with his food before he swallowed it. He just wanted see what he could make them do. “Because I
“Your fingers,” he breathed. “You can use your fingers, now.”
Sherlock scowled at him as he eased himself onto the couch and lifted his leg up on the coffee table. He arranged a bag of frozen broccoli over his knee and sat back with a sigh. “Maybe you’re right,” he muttered. “Maybe I should just retire. Then we can

“What?”
“I... I only want to do it with someone who loves me,” she’d said finally.

taxing.”
.” Suddenly, Sherlock knew that it wasn’t luck that had kept him safe in his recklessness all those years, as Lestrade had postulated; no, it was John Watson who had done that. Sherlock didn’t need to choose safer crimes to solve, he didn’t need to be more careful—what he needed was to make sure that John went with him on every case, was by his side, to protect him in case things went awry. Like he’d always done. If Sherlock had that, he would have nothing at all to fear.
“No?”
“So… so she must be ready to take over the network,” John interrupted, uneasily. “But she didn’t know where Moriarty was hiding me, if I was even still alive, or she would have gone with her original plan. So she used you instead... the only other person she could be certain wasn’t one of Moriarty’s spies.” He stared at the man in front of him. “Are you going to do it, then? Take down Moriarty?”
. “Erm,” he started, “it’s where you pretend the spoon is an… an airplane…” John suddenly realized how ridiculous it sounded. “And you buzz your lips together, a bit, and say something like, ‘Open up, here it comes!’”
. He focused on the door, instead, traced the outline of it with his eyes, wishing he could just get up, open it,
Sherlock furrowed his brow. “Good point. But the project you did was far below your intelligence level.”
John was still in shock from the revelation that Sherlock was actually gay. He’d always suspected it, but Sherlock just seemed so uninterested in anything that had to do with sex that he’d sort of forgotten about it. He wanted to ask Sherlock’s parents more questions, but he didn’t think it appropriate. Though if Sherlock
,” he swore. “God, how the hell did you learn to—oh,
A tear from each eye rolled down John’s cheeks. Sherlock had an urge to kiss them away, but John wiped them off with the back of his hand. “I didn’t know all that, Sherlock,” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me? Why did you let me think—“
Molly looked at him. She knew she was about to betray a special part of their friendship, and she hated every second of it. “I’m sorry, Sherlock, I’m not going to say what she told me. I’m not your spy.” She felt terrible.
“You don’t have to look so disgusted,” John muttered, grabbing the edge of the shower curtain to cover his privates. “The bastard got what he deserved.”
I couldn’t tell if he didn’t believe me or if he was trying to prove a point by hearing my description. I didn’t like not being able to tell. Especially because either way, it wasn’t good for me.
But emotions were illogical, and so Sherlock still held a grudge against the man. They’d seen each other a few times, in group settings, and Lestrade had called to consult with him on a few really head-spinning cases… but they hadn’t spoken in over two years, and that had been just fine with Sherlock.
, and
was a fabrication, as well.
Ella cocked her head. “Are you always so sensitive to John’s feelings?”
“But…” John sputtered. “We didn’t look at it. We don’t know what was on it!”
“Oh, love,” John cooed. He reached back around with one arm to grasp my hip as I thrust into him.
John had caught Sherlock smirking at that, and had growled low. “See how you like it!” he’d barked, and practically threw his blubbering child into Sherlock’s lap. But to John’s surprise, Sherlock made a silly face and lifted her up above his head, and she stopped crying. “Well, bloody hell,” John had said, in awe. “We should have you around more often.”
It drove John up the wall.
“Where are we?” whispered Anna, looking around them. There was no land in sight.
area… but I’m not a madman.”
“So, how was baby’s first Christmas morning?” asked Sherlock’s father, as they began to eat.
“It doesn’t matter.” John waved it away. “Where is he now?”
“Carruthers didn’t just ruin Sherlock’s life, which is bloody bad enough, or the life of Violet Smith. He insured that thousands of crimes would be committed in this city, thousands of lives would be lost, because he
A terrible, awful horror had chilled the blood in Sherlock’s veins. “That’s not a ‘clever’ crime, Mycroft,” he said, still staring at the telly, still clutching his brother's shirt. “That’s a
He swayed in place after it was over, panting, his eyes screwed tightly shut. I watched him, unsure of what to do. Suddenly they flew open, and there we were, just me, and him, staring at each other, splattered with come, my hand still holding his now-shrinking cock. It was almost comical.
“Because,” said John, swallowing. “I thought maybe he’d… he’d had a thing for me, for a long while. That I’d been a selfish, unfeeling git. I mean, I asked him to be best man at my wedding. My

sounded into the woods. Though today John noticed it was faintly muted, for some of the noise had been absorbed by the blanket of snow on the ground and the fog that rested just below the treetops. He sized up the two pieces of wood that had fallen on either side of the stump and decided the one on the left would do but the one on the right could use another split. This particular tree had been larger than the others so he’d had to hack at the pieces two or three times to get them down to the appropriate size for his stove. He was reaching the end of the stack however, and the few remaining pieces would each only need one swing more.
Arousal began to pool in my abdomen. It built and built, until my entire body was trembling with want. It just felt so bloody
“What else?” he asked.
“I won’t let you fall apart. I won’t. I promise, you can feel good right now, and I won’t let it hurt you.” John raised his other hand and slid it back to cup Sherlock’s jaw. Sherlock turned and pressed his panting mouth into the palm. His face began to relax. The tension in his shoulders eased. “That’s it. Yes, that’s it. Just relax. You don’t have to do anything.” His head thumped on the wall, and he mouthed John’s name against his skin. “That’s right. It’s me. It’s just me, no one else. Just me and you.” Suddenly Sherlock’s hips twitched, and he let out a cry. The sound was desperate and broken. John felt him come, hot and wet in his fist, and he made quick firm strokes to ease him through it.
The guard on his knees tried his radio to call for help, but of course it wasn’t working. He turned to the other guard. “Call maintenance, tell them we need a… screwdriver. Or something.”
By the time he awoke, I had already left, for good.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Well, that’s because I am not Anna’s father.”
Sherlock reached out and grabbed John’s arm at the elbow, and started toward the loo. “What—“ John began, as the detective pushed him inside and locked the door behind them. His eyes grew very wide as Sherlock stepped over and turned on the shower. “Sherlock—“
Sherlock nodded in agreement, and John tilted his head up to resume kissing him.
, Sherlock thought, stretched out on his bed, a spent John catching his breath next to him. It was the sixth time in two weeks that they’d been together (
“It is, Sherlock.” John closed his notebook and uncrossed his legs. “Last week we didn’t have a case, and you were running five different experiments
. And he was… he liked it. He wanted
It was because he’d been thinking about it for so long that he felt like it had really, already happened. The way John’s lips felt on his now wasn’t a new feeling at all, even though he’d never actually felt them before. It was an old feeling, ages old, but maybe a little sharper this time. And maybe John’s breath smelled a bit differently than in his imagination, maybe a little like stale coffee and whatever leftover curry he’d eaten for lunch. But it was still the same, the same motion of lips, the same hand on his cheek and in his hair, the same height difference, the same hot exhale of breath on his face, the same smoothness of their noses sliding over one another’s as they turn their heads in opposite directions. Same body heat. Same erection.
“Oh, you are going to talk,” answered Sherlock, curtly.
John’s throat tightened. “Yeah, I think I know what you mean,” he said, remembering how strange it had been when he’d realized Sherlock wasn’t the same person that he’d imagined for the last thirteen years. “I suppose I have to earn it, the title of ‘Dad.’”
Band practice was another thing entirely. Anna had, at first, found it ridiculous that they had to practice at all. “All part of the lie, Annalise,” Mycroft had told her. “The more truth we put into it, the less we have to fake.” Anna was able to talk him down to one practice a week, however—at least, for her. The other members still had to be there on the other days, to answer the phone if Sherlock called. And to write songs, of course.
“This is an old photograph, taken many years before John died. Moriarty managed to escape going to prison, that time.” Mycroft’s face soured at the memory. “After the fiasco with John, we hadn’t seen any trace of him… but I suppose it was too much to hope he’d blown himself up, too. Unfortunately, he’s been spotted back in London, and he’s amassing resources. We’re not sure why he’s here or what he’s planning, but whatever it is, it is not going to be to the benefit of the English population.”
“Does it matter?” I didn’t like the way he was looking at me. It seemed that I had fallen into some trap he had laid and I was not pleased about it. At all.
. As they got closer, he could see that they were moving slowly, but he could hear them talking to each other, their tones cheerful and energetic. He wondered how far they’d walked, if they’d been able to take a cab part of the way. The tube didn’t exactly run between Sherlock’s and Molly’s buildings, and though they weren’t that far from each other, it was still several miles…
John’s hands knew what to do, though. His touch was firm, but smooth, sliding over Sherlock’s shoulders, down his sides, underneath his t-shirt to the skin on his waist.
” Donovan gasped.
Sherlock gave John’s hair another pull for good measure and then let go, repositioning himself with his knees on the ground and his mouth less than an inch away from John’s erection. “Now,” he breathed, and his lips brushed the head of John’s prick as he spoke, making John shiver underneath him. “What were you saying before? Something about this ‘thing’we’re doing?” Sherlock dipped his head and licked John all the way from base to tip.
Anna nodded. “Yeah.” She reached around in the backseat for her cardigan and put her hand on the door handle. Then she paused and turned back. “Will you wait here?” she asked. “I still have so many more questions…”
Sherlock walked down the stairs to the kitchen, trying to ignore the uncomfortable bulge in his pants. He filled the kettle and set it on the counter, turned it on, and looked around for some other way to distract himself. But all he could think about was John’s room, the dream-like lighting, the heat, the would-be softness of the sheets, the hardness of John’s cock as Sherlock slid his hand—
Sherlock woke up, his heart pounding. Just a dream, just a dream…
“Why?” I asked.
, from years of previous conversations, that John was not gay.
Sherlock sighed and touched his fingers together in his lap. The retelling had exhausted him—he hadn’t spoken about it, not really, since it happened all those years ago.
Sherlock was unpleasantly surprised at this little speech, and John apparently wasn’t too daft to tell that something was wrong. “Out with it,” he said, hands on his hips. “Come on, you’ve been acting strange ever since you woke up in the hospital. What’s the problem?”
John could barely see them, poking out above his trousers, but there were two distinct thumb-shaped contusions on his hips. He absentmindedly reached out and let a gloved finger graze the one on the right—and then felt his jaw go slack as all the pieces came rushing together.
. He finished with the other arm and then wrapped her in a tight embrace, and Anna hadn’t realized just how scared she’d been, and how lost, until he was there, holding her. She couldn’t remember the last time he’d held her like this.
He said he’d loved me for years. Almost since the beginning.
on the board. She’d told Mycroft that once, and he’d smiled wryly. “Oh no,” he’d said, “but don’t forget, a pawn can become whatever you want it to be—if it can make it to the other side, of course.”
“Not really,” I countered, feebly. This was going horribly wrong.
“Was that not sufficient?”
Mary and John turned to each other, sharing a private smile. “Happy New Year, darling,” Mary said to him.
“I’m so sorry,” she said again, and Sherlock sighed, pulling her to him. She sobbed and clung to his shirt.
. For John to suddenly be attracted to men?
John awoke on Molly’s couch to a winter wonderland; there were inches and inches of snow already on the ground, on the window sills, on the rooftops of the buildings across the street. The cat, Polly, was sleeping soundly, curled up in a ball on top of John’s feet. He gently nudged it awake, and it turned to give him a little
“John.” My mouth was thick and hot.
“You can’t promise that.”
She looked at him, fiercely. “As long as the government never sees that treasure, that’s enough for me.”
Carruthers ignored him and kept pleading.
John took a couple of deep breaths to steady himself. The room had begun to spin, a bit.
“I haven’t the faintest,” Sherlock said, swiping the photo out of John’s hands and holding it up for a better look. “But it’s important enough that Mycroft only trusts
“We have to end this, Sherlock.”
, and start looking at it as
He watched as Sherlock swallowed, looking very stricken, even through the heavy mist that now filled the bathroom.
At least, he aimed for the face. Aimed for the nose, Lestrade’s wretched little nose, right in the center of his stupid head. But Sherlock’s motor skills weren’t all back to normal, and he ended up clipping Lestrade’s chin, sending him spinning clockwise to the ground.
“I’m sorry,” said John, catching his breath. “Sherlock, it’s just so—“ he laughed again. “Inappropriate. Or,
Sherlock was gripping both arms of his chair, staring Ella down with such force that John was surprised she could hold his gaze. John, for his part, was holding his breath, hoping to God that Sherlock wouldn’t blow up on her. It had taken much coaxing and threatening on John’s part to get him to come here, but somehow, here they were. And Ella clearly thought she was going to have a field day with the deductive genius and self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath that was Sherlock Holmes.
It didn’t take long after that, only a few quick strokes and Sherlock was coming, with wordless groans. John was not far behind, swearing “
Sherlock tried to blink himself back to reality, ignoring the slight stiffness in his groin. If he woke up enough, he could shift gears and dream of something else when he fell back asleep…
There
“What key?” Anna asked, confused.
“Good,” she said, studying him.
“I don’t want to distract you from what’s important.”
Mary snorted. “Well,
“I’m going after her,” he murmured, when they broke apart.
Sherlock slipped on his dressing gown and tiptoed out into the kitchen. He took a deep breath and looked around, imagining how John would wake up and come out here later, make some tea, maybe open up the newspaper. That was going to happen today, and every other day for the rest of their lives, if Sherlock could help it.
Sherlock started to become annoyed. This wasn’t at all like what had happened in his head last night. “I’m in love with you,” he said, slowly, “but I don’t want to have sex with you.”
“Then call Lestrade,” Mary told him. “Let the police handle it.”
, there was no reciprocation?”
He would do that personally.
I looked up at his irate expression. No, I hadn’t (purposely) acquired a life-threatening vitamin deficiency to see him again—although it did sound like something I would do. Really, it was the other way round; I’d forgotten to eat most of my meals in the last several months and used the resulting illness to my advantage.
John felt the room spin for a moment. His face grew cold, and then blisteringly hot. Violet was raped. Of course she was.
Sherlock sighed, exasperated. “Your house, of course! Really, John, we just
John laughed, a ridiculous laugh, just one chuckle. “Sorry,” he said. “It’s not funny. I’ve just never heard it said aloud before.”
love, Sherlock. That’s loving someone as a friend. Which we already do… so I don’t even know why you felt the need to…” his train of thought dissolved into more head shaking. The rain was coming down harder, now.
And then, through the door, the prisoner heard Moriarty’s voice. His whole body stiffened at the sound of it—he hadn’t been brought to Moriarty in years.
John clenched his jaw and ground it back and forth as he worked out what Sherlock meant. “Play along?” he repeated, finally. “
, he’d toss off quickly in the shower, not really thinking about anything, just trying to get some relief and move on to more important things.
John’s eyes swam. “
John had made his decision and he started toward him.
Sherlock looked at him and swallowed, his face growing uncomfortable. “John, I do want to…” he shook his head. “I’m sorry. For what I said. I was just
, thought Sherlock.
Gotta get through some feels before getting to... other things. But I promise, smut is on the way!
“Ohhhh…” He nodded in comprehension. “A tea party. Well, then you’d better bring the lot of them. Wouldn’t want any of them to feel left out.” He chuckled to himself as he watched her scamper off to grab the others.
“Get up,” said a gruff voice.
Mycroft turned and started down the pavement. “Walk with me,” he called out behind him. Sherlock stared after him for a second, his tall, awkwardly-shaped silhouette bobbing down the path, frivolously swinging its umbrella. He shook his head and sighed, following him with a little jump to catch up.
,” under his breath.
But they wouldn’t, the stubborn, thickheaded idiots. So Mycroft did it instead. Couldn’t really call it breaking-in or stealing, he simply used his clearance to get to the key and borrowed it without permission, then sent it out to his contacts on the black market and waited for Mary to bite. However, he had made a serious error. He hadn’t discovered at the time that Mary and Moriarty were working together; so, when the key ended up in
“There’s nothing I can do.”
Anna had immediately thought of the crown jewels when Mycroft suggested committing a crime to get Moriarty’s attention. She would steal them, the same artifacts that he’d stolen all those years ago, except she would escape with them and bring them to him. She’d make an offering of them; it would be symbolic and irresistible.
“I don’t trust Moriarty to react predictably to anything, even the best liar in the world,” Sherlock retorted. “Now, for the last time,
Heidi cried harder, and Anna drove the knife into her heart—but she pulled it out too quickly this time, and blood shot out of the wound as the heart beat its last, squirting Anna in the face. She wiped it off slowly and looked with disgust at the dead girl. “Bitch,” she spat.
dead… but it didn’t feel like he was alive, either. It didn’t feel like anything.
Sherlock stared at her. “Show me how.”
, thought Anna. But they were so perfect together, and so obviously made for each other, that Anna couldn’t fathom how they’d each survived on their own for thirteen years.
The snow compacted under his feet as he made his way through the trees. The path was invisible in the snow but John knew where it was because he recognized the landmarks. He eventually came to a clearing in the wood where the pond was in front of him. He couldn’t see it because it was frozen over top and the snow had fallen on it, so it looked just like a pristine, blanketed meadow. It was very beautiful and John looked at it through the fog of his breath and felt again the calm that nature had brought him over time.
“Sherlock, look at me.” John squatted in front of him, and Sherlock reluctantly met his gaze. “You’re
He backed up toward the bed, sat and lay down. “There’s some lube,” he said, “in the drawer.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “Alright…”
“Don’t touch me!” he shouted, and Molly recoiled. He continued pacing, his hands on his head, gripping his hair. John had never seen him this distressed.
she wondered.
He thought, suddenly.
Carruthers cocked his head as the man with the beard fidget behind him. “Oh?”
“Yes, yes, do as I
John felt his own eyes begin to sting with tears. He knew what it was, to have a nightmare like that. He knew what it meant. It meant subconscious pain, fear, a haunting of traumatic events—it meant PTSD, sleep-aids, therapy. It had been nearly a month, with no worrisome signs, and John had marveled that they’d managed to avoid any of it.
Lucy looked at her and said nothing.
“I’m here,” John answered. “I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.”
I wanted to help him but I couldn’t bloody move. All I could do was breathe and shift to the side, so that he had more space to move his hand. My eyes were shut but I could feel him jerking himself, his hand milking his cock under my stomach. He shivered and shook beneath me, soft moans over my head, and then he finally groaned and spilled between us. “I love you,” he whispered into my hair. “I love you.”
The woman grasped the bottom of her suit jacket and tugged expertly. “I’m aiding the police with Mr. Holmes’ statement,” she told him. “Who are
“Please,” Sherlock pleads. “Do it like you did my thumb. Please.”
“Yes.” She attempted to make herself look innocent.
“I’m trying to
Greg Lestrade hiked up his trousers as he stepped out of the car and onto the quiet, suburban street. The lights that towered over the pavement glowed eerily in the early-morning fog, sending a chill down his back. Lestrade cursed every horror movie he’d ever seen where they’d made fog into such an ominous… erm…
“Well, it was quite the traumatic experience,” said Sherlock’s father, his friendly eyes showing a bit of sadness behind them.
“She’s over there every night! And there are… boys,” he muttered. He must have looked ridiculously infuriated, because he observed Molly using all of her bodily control to restrain herself from giggling.
Anna sighed. “You can meet them, but you’re not allowed to
“I know.” John spoke suddenly. “I went there, too.”
the doctor who told her that Sherlock had pulled through.
Molly walked to the chair opposite the sofa and sat down, still watching him. “John…” she began, unable to wait any longer.
“What’s ‘sook-ee-son’?”
John stood up suddenly. The world seemed to narrow and darken in his periphery until it was only the phone in his sight, held in Sherlock’s outstretched hand and John took it and tapped the arrow in the middle of the screen to play the video. He knew what he would see even before it played and he had known since Sherlock had told him “She’s alive.” He would see his daughter in the video and what’s more, he would believe it was her, despite what he had just said.
John slid down into the nearest chair. “How do you think Mary got involved in all this?”
Sherlock was silent for a long while, staring at John’s face. “Alright,” he said finally. “I need to go out for a bit.”
I bent over the body and started to examine it. The cuts were indeed meticulous. And the bruises were on both sides of the body, larger ones up by the sternum, and—
John knew Sherlock was trying to be a good friend, but he was sick of attempting to explain human nature to him, of teaching him to have normal human responses—especially in situations where John was the one who needed him to have a normal human response. “Well, you can start by not telling me when to go to bed, or when to get up, or to stop drinking, or to
“I couldn’t give you a word,” said Sherlock, upset that this thing had come back to haunt him again.
Sherlock stared blearily into the space in front of him… John’s old chair. “I couldn’t find them,” he said.
“When he first decided to raise Annalise, there was a lot for him to learn. He went out and bought all kinds of books, so when I wasn’t teaching him practical things like how to change a nappy,” she laughed a little to herself at the memory, “or mash up Anna’s carrots just right, he was reading. Trust Sherlock to think he could learn everything about being a parent from a book. I mean, books are ever so helpful, of course, but Sherlock treated them as his own personal canon law. He’d quote from them incessantly, it was incredibly annoying.”
Turned out it was mother. She was making breakfast, I’d completely forgot it was Sunday morning and she always made a big breakfast on Sundays. The front door was unlocked (always was) so I tiptoed in and sauntered up to the doorframe to the kitchen and watched her bustle about for a bit. After several seconds I suspected she didn’t know I was there, but as I opened my mouth to announce my presence she cut me off instead.
“Think!”
This wasn’t the sort of advice I had been looking for. “You do realize you’re telling me to just give up.”
of something for me, it’s
He tried again, but it was no use. His voice wasn’t working anymore. He couldn’t even whisper.
His gaze softened and he continued. “I was selfish, for a long time. I forced his memory on you all those years, but it was never for your benefit, it was for mine... I see that now.” He paused. “And I sincerely apologize, for that.”
Sherlock pressed his fingers over his closed eyes, then rubbed his temples. His head was hurting. “No, that was never the plan. Not the original one. I’d have much rather hunted them ‘alive,’ with you by my side.” Sherlock opened his eyes, and saw John’s were positively swimming. He continued. “But Moriarty gave me an ultimatum, on that roof: kill myself, or he’d kill the people I loved. So I chose the former. Moriarty told me the hit men had instructions to follow through with the plan even if he was dead, which is why he shot himself,” Sherlock explained, “so that I could never figure out how to make him call them off.”
A hint of fear crossed Carruthers’ expression. “Look, mate,” he started, lifting his hands up palms-first in a gesture of supplication. “You’ve got the wrong idea. Whatever you think I did, I—“
“You mean you
, and it’s not fair to Mary, you know, and I can’t keep coming here, especially when I have a brand-new baby at home…”
Mrs. Holmes sat thoughtfully for a moment. “I don’t remember Sherlock ever getting attached to something like that again, after what happened. I think that’s when he developed that ridiculous idea about sentiment. ‘The singular defect of the human race’ or something along those lines.”
We pulled up to 221B, paid the cabby and went up the stairs. John hung up his coat and immediately went to the kitchen to put the kettle on. Tea was his way of setting us up for a “civilized” conversation. (I suppose he figured that we were British, after all, we wouldn’t have a screaming match over

Sherlock kept staring at her. “Tell me,” he said.
Sherlock stared at her for a long time, and she held his grey-eyed gaze. “I thought you were going to say the kiss.”
Sherlock’s sobs doubled.
Molly massaged her hands together, wondering if she should continue. “You know, he never let Anna call him ‘Dad,’” she said, deciding. “She wanted to, of course, when she was a little girl. Tried to, several times. But he’d get so angry with her when she did, he’d scold her... he’d point to one of the thousand pictures of you that he had in the flat and say something like, ‘I’m not your father.
Mary. The baby.
“Violet,” Sherlock whispered. He couldn’t tell if she was awake or asleep, her long hair was covering her face and her body was hunched over. But, at her name, she sat up and turned one fearful, tear-stained face to him.
Lestrade shuffled out to the waiting room, his gaunt face brightening a bit as he saw Sherlock on the other side of the plexiglas. He lowered himself into the chair opposite and picked up the phone. Sherlock did likewise.
John’s eyes popped open. “You don’t know what’s bloody good for me.”
Sherlock resisted the urge to reach out and grab him. “John,” he said, instead, and stopped walking. John turned around and stopped, too. Waited for him to go on.
“You can. Sherlock. Look at me.” Sherlock did, his pale eyes nearly overcome by his pupils. “It’s just me, okay. It’s just you and me, and I want this, God, I want you to feel this. I want you to feel so good. It’ll be so good. I promise.”
John swallowed. He hadn’t expected to have to deal with this, yet. Of course John thought it was perfectly fine for boys to kiss… perfectly fine for
John scowled.
“I…” he started. John figured he was probably trying to decide right there, on the spot, how he should feel about it. John felt bad for him.
Sherlock swallowed. “Because of what happened after.”
familiar); he reluctantly snapped his lips shut.
“All right, calm down! Yeah… yeah, I did tell her. What does that have to do with—“
...to be continued...
John backed away. Only a few inches, but I nearly fell forward as my body followed his. I pulled him to me again with the grip I still held on his sleeves, and he made a soft sound in his throat, almost a whine. “Sherlock,” he choked. “Are—are you—oh—“
Sherlock looked up, sharply.
his plan. Not to get away with it… but to take the blame.”
“Well, just look at all this!” He gestured to the multitude of unidentified rotting materials and piles of microscope slides and boxes of chemicals. “We’re not going to fit all this in the cab with us.”
He finally had his trousers up, and his shirt was mostly buttoned. I grabbed his shoes for him and shoved them into his hands, then steered him out of the bedroom.
“John will be a good father,” said Major Sholto, breaking the silence.
When I knew he was done, I turned him over, gently, so that he was lying on his side. He was still shivering, and he reached out to grab onto my shirt. “Kiss me,” he said, and I did, messily. I used my tongue, nuzzled his nose. His breathing was still uneven, as if he was crying, but his eyes stayed dry.
“There’s nothing left for me, Sherlock. My wife doesn’t want me. You go out, alone, don’t need my help like you used to.” John drew in a deep breath. “I can’t live with myself, knowing that Greg is being punished for something that

Sherlock felt his own cock begin to ache with desire, but felt something else, too—that same tingling heat that had started in his chest and spread throughout his whole body on the night he realized he loved John Watson. He felt the urge to coerce John into making ridiculous promises: “Promise we’ll never stop doing this,” “Promise you won’t leave me,” “Promise you’ll love me forever.” John was pumped full of enough endorphins right now that he just might actually make them, which would prove even more devastating later on when he’d break them.
Sherlock stayed silent, but his eyes shifted over to John’s medical bag.
“Ah,” Ella nodded, as if this made perfect sense. “And then what happened?”
, one of them ought to have a damn theory.
“And not just by choice.”
!” Sherlock growled, wrenching his arm out of Mycroft’s grasp. “What the hell are you playing at?” Mycroft never debased himself to physical violence. That was Sherlock’s thing.
of it!
John’s heart thumped wildly as Sherlock undid button after button, as shrugged the garment off his shoulders with a wince of pain—
“It’s okay,” he said to me, even though I should have probably been the one reassuring
“Oh, so you
We went over to the bed and sat down on the edge. Both our trousers were still undone, and John, at least, was still breathing a little roughly. I heard his breath hitch more than once as he tried to start speaking but then stopped himself.
I didn’t even know there was a lady living next door. I don’t want to admit it, though. Mrs. Hudson has probably mentioned it at some point, or perhaps even John, and I don’t want him to know I haven’t been listening. I’m supposed to listen to people. Shows I care, or something.
In a flash, Sherlock reached forward and pushed the entire plate off the table. It shattered and sent the biscuits flying across the floor. “It seems as though they’ve all been ruined,” Sherlock went on, settling back into his chair. Mrs. Hudson didn’t move, and he glanced up. “Well? Don’t just stand there gaping about!”
“Mary…” Sherlock gave her a warning look. She gazed up at him, then back at John.
Sherlock looked over from his chair at the wall of ovens in their kitchen, blazing hot, John leaning easily back against the countertop and staring at him. “Can you check?” John asked again, a slyness in his voice. “These damned things are so
Anna tried to control her breathing as she felt a stab of uncertainty. She thought carefully back to when she was in training, back to what it was like. These people could have hated her the whole time, could have ignored her, could have just given her music to play and never said a kind word, but they didn’t. They liked her. Mycroft had paid them to be in the band, yes, but he hadn’t paid them to be her friends. He hadn’t.
thing about what I’m going through. Fuck you, Sherlock.”
him? He shook his head, bewildered, and made his way to the bathroom. He stood over the toilet and emptied his bladder, sighing with relief. He closed his eyes, the light overhead too harsh for his hangover.
A strange expression came over Sherlock’s face—he almost looked… helpless. She knew he was grasping at straws trying to deal with raising a teenager. She couldn’t imagine how abnormal his teen years had been and how hard it had to be for him to relate to Anna.
“Violet,” he said again, his voice gentler. Violet began to cry. “It’s going to be alright,” he told her, not sure why; he certainly didn’t have control over the situation, and could do nothing at the moment to help her.
“How long for what?”
Mrs. Hudson gave a little sigh and swayed in place.
A rather tall, rather handsome man opened the door. Sherlock was a little shocked at how good-looking he was, and how well-dressed, and how he smiled at Sherlock shyly through his thick-rimmed glasses. And gay—how
“Keep going,” he said, sounding strangled.
“Actually,” Sherlock interjected, his voice seeming to boom over the crowd. “My name is Holmes. Sherlock… Holmes.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “Annalise, you can’t
“Indeed, yet I seem to remember that
Anna’s eyes widened. “Oh, did he know, then?”
John gave her a puzzled look and turned back to Sherlock to see if he was getting this. John couldn’t read his expression.
“Wait, hold up.” John cut him off. “Are you saying Violet didn’t give a statement?”
Sherlock’s face exploded in heated excitement. “The flash drive… why didn’t I… yes, of course, yes, yes, yes!” He clapped with joy. “John! You’re
“I—ugh,” John gurgled. His chest had broken out in a blotchy flush.
made it down her throat) as Sherlock and John stumbled to clear plates and glasses from the long-forgotten supper. Her eyes began to close against her will. She kept nodding off and snapping them open again.
“’Course I do,” said Anna, suddenly fierce.
John and Sherlock strolled leisurely along the path, the gravel crunching under their shoes. They’d gone for a walk to take a break from the hospital (at Mary’s suggestion—well, more like “demand,” as John was getting a little too over-protective of the baby. “She
“Of course you…” John trailed off, and leaned back against the wall, awestruck. “I don’t know what I thought, Sherlock. I don’t know what I thought would happen… certainly not that
“Why would you think that?”
Mary narrowed her eyes. “So you don’t have it with you?”
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock said finally.
Anna stepped back to have a better look at the door, and as she did so, she stumbled over the dead guard’s foot.
With one last look, John nodded and fled the scene.
, you idiot. You rushed off this morning, and you didn’t call me… I had no bloody clue what was going on!” She’d started to tremble.
John looked down at our hands, and I caught a new expression on his face that I’d never seen before. When he looked back up at me, his eyes were glistening. “Then take all the time you need.”
Sherlock was not one to waste time thinking about sex. Sex always led to emotions, and emotions were debilitating to the analytical mind. His methods of deduction only worked because he had trained himself to remain perfectly objective in situations where most other people could not. Becoming friends with John, and caring about him, that had been misstep enough. He’d put himself in mortal danger more than once for John Watson—not exactly the mark of logical, calculated decisions.
John vomited from the pain and tried to catch his breath, while Moriarty’s gargantuan minion paced back and forth in front of him, waiting for him to recover so that he could inflict further pain without John passing out (at Moriarty’s instruction, probably—John doubted that the brute had enough sense to be so smart, or enough malice to be so cruel). He looked up from the ground and the pool of sick that was soaking through his shirtsleeves to see Sherlock on his knees, his face contorted in fear and anguish. “John,” he said weakly, and, clearly not knowing what else to say, said it again: “John.”
. They’d noticed.
So he became quite experienced in the art of breaking and entering, though lucky for him he’d never actually been
“Then you’re even more obtuse than I thought!”
Sherlock’s eyes became wide.
“You’ll have to clear out the lot of them! You have
John clenched the chair arms. “Well, I came home last night after work, didn’t go to the pub—you know, you told me not to drink anymore—and I went to my room, and Sherlock was…” John steeled his nerves, avoiding looking at Sherlock “…masturbating. To a picture of me.”
Carruthers suddenly vice-gripped Sherlock’s bollocks.
“What? What are you talking about?” John interrupted. “You’re going to have to spell it out for me, Sherlock.”
Anna couldn’t remember ever winning against Mycroft. He’d always beaten her, no matter how hard she tried or by how much she thought she was winning. Ultimately, she would become too worried about protecting her queen, or her knight, or her castle, and she would lose her focus. Anna thought it must be impossible to completely ignore the importance of the more powerful pieces; you couldn’t win the game with only
The golden light still shone through the window, and it was very warm. “I heard you,” John replied.
something,” he snapped.
Lestrade’s voice was small when he finally spoke. “What are you going to do?”
Mary turned back to Sherlock. “Speaking of, how is this case going? You two have been spending so much time on it, and John won’t tell me a thing.”
“John,” Sherlock choked out, weakly, between sobs. “John…”
Molly started to unzip the bag while Sherlock got a clean set of tools. Suddenly, she gasped and hopped backwards. “Sherlock!”
Mary gazed at him. “No, it’s not.”
Sherlock’s anger flared. “What is the point of you, exactly?” he spat, getting out of his chair.
death,” he said. “Anyway, the service is on Saturday. I’m told they are expecting quite a few people to attend.”
“Mrs. Hudson’s fumigating the flat,” John explained. “Apparently, ‘someone’ brought an entire colony of ants into the building.”
John and Mary.
, thought Sherlock,
There was a knock at the door, and I jumped two feet in the air. I turned and opened it wide, and there was John, still holding his shoes, looking so obviously like he’d just woken up from having been shagged senseless.
Anna began to mirror his head movements, attempting to keep a straight face. “And
Sherlock tried
“I hate this, Sherlock,” he’d sobbed, his head in his hands. “I hate not being able to do anything. I hate that I just assumed that he would take care of things... how I just left him… I hate that he covered this up for me, and didn’t tell me he was going to do it. I hate it. I should have some of the blame. I should be in jail, with him.” And so on and so forth. And Sherlock had run out of sympathetic responses to give him.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, for Sherlock Holmes’ best kept secret:
John looked up again, his eyes disbelieving. “Of

And Anna felt the effects.
“Stop, Mom,” Anna said.
was tired, certainly—I’d spent the majority of the night awake and waiting for a phone call that he’d been eviscerated by his jealous ex-assassin wife. Or a knock on the door that would be her coming for me. She’d already tried to kill me once, and that was
“You’re not, Sherlock,” he said, pointedly. “That’s just the excuse you use when you want to be an arsehole.”
“I…” Sherlock trailed off, and a crease formed between his eyebrows.
“This is all very touching,” interrupted Moriarty, “and if it were any other day I’d say keep going; it’ll make for a far more entertaining end. But unfortunately I have other appointments on my schedule, so we’re going to have to get this party started.”
“John,” I said, sounding more like a frog being strangled, now.
John almost blew up, then. He almost yelled that he’d heard what Sherlock said to Mrs. Hudson, and that Sherlock was utterly stupid if he’d fallen in love with John, if he was waiting for John’s marriage was to fall apart so that he could have a go, because John would never, ever, in a million years, love him back. Ever.
The door parted from its center and retracted into the sides of the wall, revealing a clean, brightly-lit room that had rows and rows of lock boxes around the walls. There was also a table in the center of the room, and a few displays on either side. Anna smiled as she realized she’d hit another stroke of luck: what she wanted was sitting on a display stand right in front of her.
John stared at her. “You want me to murder Moriarty? And what if I refuse?”
Sherlock took a breath to say something, but John continued on. “Is where you tell me you have proof? That you ran a paternity test and it came back positive? It wasn’t faked and you know because you ran the test yourself?”
A fresh wave of tears cascaded down John’s cheeks.
Sherlock stared at John for a long while. “Sleep on it,” he finally suggested. “Sleep on it, before you make a decision.”
in to get it?
“Anna, you should know how surprised I am. I don’t often become surprised, you see, because I’m usually smarter than everyone, and I know what they’re going to do even before they think of doing it. But now, I am surprised.”
“Ah, there it is,” Carruthers breathed, his voice like silk.
“I know. I know. Just relax. Just let me, please.” Sherlock’s head was tilted back, against the wall. His neck stretched long and white in the darkness. “God, you’re gorgeous. Jesus God. Sherlock.”
, the split lip and bloody cheek were clearly the least of it.
“Yes.”
They heard the excited shout from down the beach and both turned their faces toward the sound—and saw Detective Inspector Lestrade, waving emphatically at them and jogging over, leaving his three girls playing in the sand behind him.
And without further ado, she ran out of the vault and down the hall.
“Well…” Mary gave him a sardonic smile. “You’re not really in a position to choose, are you?”
Sherlock stepped carefully over the rubble from the building, through the entrance they’d escaped from a few hours earlier—or, where he thought the entrance had been. The building was so unrecognizable, he had to navigate back to the observation room based on his memory of the distance and direction it had been from the front of the building. He did it with ease, of course.
house?” John grumbled.
John looked at him, the memories of the night before coming back again. He shook his head. “It’s not fine. What happened last night… that was not okay. I was out of control. And I’m sorry.”
to him. He tried to stifle John’s feeble apologies, cutting him off.
“John!” she exclaimed.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Are you Mr. Carruthers?”
We slid to the floor, tangled up together, sweating and sticky and half conscious with the waves of our pleasure subsiding into a calming bliss. John looked into my eyes, his half lidded, and he brushed the hair off my forehead, smiling softly. And I knew that if I could give this to him, this moment, over and over again, he would never want to leave.
Sherlock studied her carefully, silently, as she smacked her toys together and babbled away. And then his face broke into a genuine, eye-crinkling grin.
“Anna. What’s
? What was that supposed to illustrate?”
overly excessive and yes, he should stop. He didn’t need a therapist to tell him that. “So, you think the drinking turned me gay.”
“Stockholm Syndrome,” Sherlock supplemented, his eyes lit up with the memory.
John nearly started crying. It hit him so suddenly, a delayed reaction, he supposed, realizing that this was actually happening, a thing which he thought may never happen. All those years of not being together, all that time of wishing and wanting, it was culminating in this very moment. As Sherlock continued to stare into John’s eyes and slid his hands up to grasp his hips, John reached out and entwined his fingers in Sherlock’s curls again. “I love you,” he whispered, his voice breaking.
She reluctantly moved to the chair and sat down.
Ella made another note.
Slowly, Sherlock lifted his arm and put it round John’s back, patting him gently. “There, there,” he soothed, surprised at the pleasant feeling it gave him to comfort someone.
John had tried, had tried really, very hard not to scream. In the military he was taught not to show pain or weakness. Or told, more like.
John whirled around, suspiciously. “You never drink.”
“I’m guessing the files on the flash drive would have told us about her past and her exact lineage,” Sherlock mused aloud, trying to fill in the rest of the gaps. “But all that didn’t matter, because you burned it without ever looking at it. And Mary… something you said must have made her change her mind about wanting us to help her find the key.” He looked at John, expectantly.
“I like it!”
“I,” I began, shakily.
The table grew quiet. Molly looked at him, in astonishment. “You took her to the
“Not the Sherlock Holmes

“Oh,” said John. “Oh, yeah.” I pressed harder. “Do it. God.”
Sherlock sat in the café across the street, just next to the window, peering out into the bright, sunny day. It was late spring, that time of year when there were a wide range of outfits being worn by weather-confused Londoners. Some still had on long overcoats and hats, some wore light windbreakers. And then there was the occasional woman who was

actually her friends.
John gaped; this was not a turn he’d expected this conversation to take. “Sherlock, this has nothing to do with the fact that I… I mean, I’m not trying to say that there’s something wrong with… with kissing you… I mean, it’s just I’m not… not…” John trailed off, suddenly feeling angry. “Bloody hell, Sherlock, it’s not always about you!”
“Alright,” he conceded. “But you have to promise not to tell your father that you saw me.”
It took her twenty minutes to get there, and when she opened the door to the flat, she found Sherlock pacing around the room. “Whoa, Sherlock, sit down. I’m sure she’s fine! Tell me what happened,” she said, putting her hand out to stop his movement.
Anna banged on the grate. “Help!” she cried, using her little-girl voice again.
Sherlock did not want to speak to anyone. He’d continued to sit on the bumper with his head in his hands for some time, as the fire crew put out the blazing building. As soon as they gave the all-clear, he was going back in there to find John’s body. No one could stop him.
