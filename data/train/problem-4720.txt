Steve sits next to Tony "We're like a family here" Steve admits and then twists his lips "We used too, at least"
"Oh my God!" A voice echoes loud in the room, interrupting everyone and almost making Steve jump "Traffic! This city and its shitty roads, what is Howard even doing in that chair? Anyway, good morning guys, sorry I'm late" Tony says giving a tired sigh and walking to Steve, a smile on his lips.
Steve looks at the man who's supporting his arm around his shoulders "Oh, yeah. We trained together"
Next time Steve sees Tony is during an emergency, Tony just stays in his corner in the truck and follows all Steve's order when they evacuate a factory and stop a mild fire.
your orders, he put both of us in danger, and he shouted back at me. I won't admit that kind of lack of respect"
"It's the opposite actually" He says lowly and Steve only hears because he just now notices how close they are, with Steve's hand still in the door and Tony between him.
"Morning Steve" Bruce says. While Tony touches his arm and smiles at him, saying almost shyly "Good morning Steve"
Steve felt something in his eyes, he put his hand against the door and in a broken voice sobs "Captain..."
"Sorry teacher!" Bucky Barnes said to Professor Coulson from the other side of the room. Coulson was frowning at him, but accepted. And Tony didn't need to be a genius - which he actually was - to know Bucky had his best friend phone with him!
"But... but he's still inside, I didn't save him" Steve says gripping the iron in his hand, but in front of him everything is different. It's not an iron door, it’s a wooden one, now burning. There's debris and there's no innocent civilians moaning next to him. Coulson... he's not inside, he's already dead.
The job is done routinely quickly and all Steve orders are safely followed by every member of his team. They get everyone outside safely, if anyone was somehow left behind it was too late. The building would collapse anytime now so they had to turn the water on.
"It didn't open. I was so close and I couldn't save him" He cries letting his tears go as Tony hugs him more tightly "I was the only one there, I swear I did everything I could, but... I just... couldn't save him"
Well, that was bullying. Steve would know. No matter how rude a person is, is not your right to act like an asshole back at him.
"Hey, don't judge yet" Tony says with his mouth half full, turning around "I get worse" He shallows and smirks.
"You did good Rogers" But this time, Steve heard the little undertone of his voice, the final breakdown.
"You're torturing yourself" He feels Natasha hand on his arm and looks back to see her small smile "Common, let's go inside. Start the day with a little less melancholy"
Then Sharon comes to talk to him and even Steve is too clumsily distracted to think about him anymore.
There's a beat where everyone in the room seems to fall into silence, and then what is probably Darcy starting, everyone erupts in a big 'OoOoOh' that ends up in laughs. Clint throws his head back in a big groan and Steve laughs as happy as he hadn’t feel in weeks, watching as Pietro puts his arms over Clint teasing him "So feely dude!"
Then Steve feels an arm over him and looks up to see Sharon smiling at him while the rest of the team keeps teasing a pissed off Clint. She taps his helmet and says "It suits you, you know?"
He can't see anything because it's blurry and of course, he's crying. He tries to clean the tears with his hand but there’s just more drops and he ends up just sitting in a lonely alley, falling on the floor and covering his face with his hands.
"Apparently" Steve says wincing "You just look so cocky all the time that we just take you too seriously when in fact" Steve says pointedly for everyone, but his eyes are on those curious brown ones and Steve shamelessly pocks his forehead "You're just silly"
If it were Tony, he would either call other military powers to help, or he’d consider it a lost cause.
When they make it to the ledge, Pepper drops away from his arms and shoves at the suit, at him. He steps back, the suit’s mechanised sounds a swish that sounds far away to his ears.
It’s like a bucket of cold water has been dumped over Steve, trails of cold gliding down his torso and reverberating back up again. He backs up, immediately prying himself off of Tony, and finds himself creating space between them.
“Assuming you can get past the thousands of soldiers and ships.” With the sceptre clutched in his left hand, Loki looks feral as Tony meanders towards him. There’s nervousness inside the Asgardian, and Tony doesn’t think everything is as copacetic about this situation as Loki is playing it off to be. There’s something underneath all of this that Tony hasn’t yet pinpointed, but now that he’s looking for it, he’s starting to see the cracks.
“Oh my god I can’t take this anymore. I can’t take this. My body literally cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna, kill yourself—” Tony’s heart sinks to the bottom of his stomach and stays there, a leaden thing. She’s going to leave him, and he springs to his own defense in reflex.
“You know I’d suck you when your breasts are full and sore from too much milk. You’ll need me. And you’ll want me. Can you imagine that? Me licking these beautiful tits? Perhaps I’ll fuck them when they’re full.” Tony groans. That thought, the very idea of Bucky milking him, massaging his tender breasts, is sordid, but Tony wants it. He’s panting now, somewhere in between Bucky’s dirty talk his breath turned to little huffs.
“Making sure they stick,” Clint says as he gets up, stalking over to the door. Natasha follows him and Steve also gets up to leave.
“Your alpha allows you to do this?” That’s the only explanation he can think of, because he can’t imagine an unbonded omega allowed in the field.
“Ok.” He escorts Tony off the gala floor back to the front entrance. Or it’s more like Tony takes his arm and leads him instead. Steve finds he doesn’t much mind it.
Heat is rolling up his spine, and it’s like a fist in his gut how badly he wants Tony. But patience is something he’s had to live with, to turn into a virtue.
“Understood, Director. I’ll do my best to take care of him.” Steve is dismissed then, and he heads home, thinking of what he’s going to say to Tony. He has so much to apologize for. As he descends the stairs he prepares what he’s going to say. He knows that perhaps it has no bearing on the outcome of their relationship. Perhaps he should let Tony go. It kills him, but he’s considering it.
The call to assemble is a relief to him. It’s the only thing that means anything at all anymore. Until he remembers that his team hates him. Except maybe Iron Man.
“Captain—” Steve pulls out and settles behind Tony, lean legs smearing into the slick that covers Tony’s thighs. He lines up his cock, meticulous. Presses the head in to dip at Tony’s lush entrance.
When he arrives, for the first time he doesn’t go looking for Tony. He realizes he can’t bear the rejection he’ll receive from his husband. Somewhere along the way, he’s thought that maybe they could have an actual marriage. That maybe it was a mistake to promise himself and Tony that he’d stay away. Now he’s locked into his own words, and he won’t renege on them, but he can’t help but feel hope. Without it, there’s nothing good left.
“Oh, it must have been when you were both young. It’s illegal now, but for those contracts that have been grandfathered in. Well, that’s good of you to not force him. Though you, the alpha, can just plead infidelity? That’s how people usually get out.”
him. For all he knows, Tony could be, because the sweet, slow drag of it, the way every inch of him is sensitized, attuned to Tony, overwhelms him even more. He’s raw, alive, as Tony pulls up and slides back down. Up again, and an excruciating glide down to his base. He can’t last like this. He’s not sure he needs to.
Now he just feels dirty, like he’s an intruder in his own body. It’s insistent, this little niggling thought in his brain, that all his orgasms belong to Tony, but it won’t go away. Instinct tells him he should have been inside Tony last night.
“Over there? Closer to you? But—” His wings puff up at the thought that they’re wanted, that Steve wants Tony over there. By Steve. In Steve’s arms. Like Tony has always dreamed about.
“Fine, fine. Let’s do this.” Tony drops into his fighting stance, lamenting that he wore jeans meant to make his ass look good rather than maneuverability. It shouldn’t matter, though—Steve gets an unholy amount of glee in drilling the Avengers to fight in all sorts of clothing just to prove that they’re all able to defend themselves in any situation. Tony most of all, Steve had whispered in his ear one night, because Steve needs to be sure that Tony can hold his own with or without the Iron Man suit.
“Shut the fuck up. Just shut the fuck up. He’s out there and you’re abandoning him. You aren’t even holding out any hope for him at all.”
Tony gasps as Steve moves, back arching like a bow, body trembling. Steve feels like a child’s balloon, let go to drift through the air and reach ever-higher for the sky. He can already feel his rut coming on, as that’s what it must be. His body forces him to accommodate his omega in all ways, to be everything Tony will require.
“Language is the first thing. You are done with swear words in front of me. Every time you do so, I will take you over my knee and spank you for each one, daily. Act like a child, get treated like one.”
Footsteps echo down the hall and Tony gulps his beverage before hiding it beside the couch. Which is a good idea, because it’s Steve.
“So how’ve you been?” Iron Man turns to him, and asks so nonchalantly, that Steve warms instinctively. They were friends, weren’t they?
“What do you want Tony? I’ll give you anything.” Tony cracks a smile, oozing confidence and charm. His legs are knee to knee, but he spreads them now, revealing his cock laying gently on his belly and his balls resting pert underneath. Steve can see the shadow of Tony’s crack, but nothing more.
“We need you to look this over. As soon as possible.” The binder in Coulson’s hands looks important, but the man is seriously ruining the moment he’s having with Pepper. He hasn’t given up on the possibility of them, even if Pepper hasn’t reciprocated his feelings entirely. She’s still upset about the lying, which she has every right to be. Tony wonders if she’ll forgive him, or if it will stand between them forever.
They don’t have time to knock boots before Bruce is having Tony ramp up the aerosolization of the cure. The plan is that Tony takes the stairs and sprays the spare people that have been wandering there as though they’re pernicious weeds. Clint will take to the vents, leaving nebulizers to rain mist down onto the groups on the floor itself, but not before making an unholy racket in order to drive the masses towards the cure.
The battle means nothing when it comes to Pepper. Nothing. As the drones count down, Tony pushes the limits of the suit to reach the woman he’s come to think of as a partner, more than a friend.
When he thinks about his explanations for why he’s in this situation, they start to feel like excuses. He should have done something different, gotten help. There were ways to get Tony to comply without doing this. He should have pursued those options. That’s what the internet is for, right? He’s let his fear of new technology and the sensation of being out of time to prevent him from getting help. He could have asked his team. Their secondary genders aren’t known to him, but they would have been able to at least point him in the right direction.
The soft click of the automatic lights when he moved had him closing his eyes to press back the burning sensation of only having shut them not that long ago. Even blinking hurt.
“I haven’t–I’m–it’s something he’s agreed he’s ok with happening.” Which is a non-answer. Nat is adept at puzzling out what’s not said.
There’s an uncomfortable silence, no one willing to confront the reality that Tony did give it up to Steve, like he was supposed to.
“Thank us by changing your behavior.” Yes. He’s going to make sure that he does this right. He wants to do the right thing. It’s so important for him as well as for Tony, so that this doesn’t happen again.
“JARVIS, I said no visitors!” Tony’s robot, Dum-E swings over bearing a fire extinguisher in its grip. It waves it at Steve threateningly before Tony barks at it to stop, and that everything is fine.
Steve turns his hand, his index finger slipping down Tony’s crack. It’s not the right angle, and Steve wrenches Tony’s pants down in response. The cold air on his ass is harsh, but Steve starts to rub his warm hands over the globes of Tony’s ass, and it feels immediately better.
“So no more accosting me in the halls or trying to kill each other with eye contact?” Tony says lightly.
“Is this about the Avengers? Which I know nothing about.” Half of his brain is Pepper. Coulson couldn’t reasonably expect he wouldn’t share the knowledge with her.
Tony groans around Steve’s cock, and he focuses on the sensation of Tony suckling at him with loud lip smacks and the occasional pop as he pulls off and resituates.
They’re both watching each other, tense, but Tony, ever the brave one, strips down first. His cock is half hard and it bobs as the waistband catches it, revealing a neatly trimmed mound of flesh where his pretty pink cock rests over his balls. Steve’s mouth waters and he licks his lips, thinking about getting his mouth around Tony.
Every time Steve went to the workshop, which was often, Tony welcomed him with a singular glee and burst of arousal. Those initial moments were hard; Tony’s body wasn’t ready to be taken. His slick hadn’t settled in and Steve wanted his first time with Tony to be when he was fully Omega. He knew with singular purpose that there would be nothing else in this world like sinking into Tony’s wet heat, and if it meant waiting a week, and ensuring that no one interfered, he would do anything to ensure that.
"Of course. There's Rhodey, and Pepper..." He counts with his fingers "And Happy? And hum..." Tony pinches his lips "I don't think that's the point" He says turning to Steve.
"Yes, he is! I don't know how you put worms on the teachers coffee pot, but leaving a note wasn't clever!"
Steve has to admit he's a little surprised. Tony brown eyes stare honestly at him and all the uneasy Steve was feeling just melts. He smiles a little at the guy and says "Well, this is a great attitude Tony. Welcome to the team"
"Just like that?" Steve says not minding sounding defensive "I don't have any decision regarding having him on the team, know who he is, where he comes from and his experience before including him in?"
Tony opens his mouth to say something but Steve steals the half eaten muffin of his hand and puts it in his own mouth, glaring at the man. Tony just gasps at him with disbelief, yeah Steve was acting like a child but no one plays with his food. Food is war. "That's the only ability I didn't develop as a child, sorry" Tony says turning back to the table.
It was hot. Steve could feel his hands sweating under the gloves where he squeezed an iron too hard, too painfully hard. He could see his desperate breathing covering his face protection, not that he would see anything outside of it with all the smoke around. He could hear the fire in the background, the furniture burning, the ceiling falling, a man by his feet moaning. He knew it was way too hot, under all that fireman protection he could feel it starting to burn his skin.
"Good morning Steve" Bruce says and Steve smiles at him "I was trying to do some Nutella toasts, trying being the keyword"
As the group laughed and played, Tony walked slowly backwards. When he seemed free of the others, he turned to make his way only to go against no one but Steve himself.
He feels a hand on his arm and when he looks forward his heart stumbles. With a beautiful smile on her small lips, under blue eyes "Hi Steve, how are you?" Sharon says stopping in front of him.
"Something that I'm clearly not listening to and it's interrupting my reading" Loki says, coldly as per usual.
"Hey Steve-o" Pietro greets with a smirk "That was a weak one" He teases, pointing at where Sharon went.
"Take a bite" Clint says pointing at the plate. And makes a pause before looking into Steve's eyes and making a much more honest smile, before adding "Captain Steve"
"I'll ask Fury about it" Steve warns, because he'll want to know if Tony is lying. Tony doesn't seem to react much at that soooo "But the rest of the team will not hear it from me. It's something personal about you, I'll respect it"
"Thanks" Steve just says, and looks up at where Clint is opening his mouth for Bruce to feed him. Bruce just rolls his eyes but goes for it "What are you doing there? I'm starving"
"Nat come help him out. Darcy help Jane bring the civilians out" Steve let's go of the robe as Natasha picks it and walks to the point of the bridge, lifting his hand, ready to give Loki the warning to push "Jane, I'm waiting for your signal" He says to the woman now opening the car door.
"... And after my mom died of cancer," He cleaned his fake tears, "Instead of my father I never met come take me, it was my uncle! Who lives working for the mob! My girlfriend has a weird skin problem that turns her green as a frog and my best friends are a raccoon, a tree and that crazy guy from class B that probably murdered someone already! And all you give me is an F, just ‘cuz I don't have any brain capacities and spend my time trying to call attention so that I don't feel as miserable as I am!"
Steve shakes his head pushing those thoughts aside and decides to go see what everyone else is doing.
Fury car stops just behind the trucks and he comes out already barking orders "Rogers, take your team to the second floor, start the evacuation there. Tenant I want you clearing the rest of the floors, now"
They get in the warehouse in three minutes but the place is already on an advanced fire. Steve is jumping out of the truck and Fury is already giving orders "Rogers I want your team inside, Wilson head for the other side, and I want someone preparing the hose!"
But Clint doesn't comment. He doesn't greet Steve like he'd usually do, he doesn't joke over what happened with Sharon or makes a quip about ‘the boss’ being late, he doesn't even look up at Steve.
He then turned the phone on and... It had a code of four characters. "Fuuuuck!!!!" Tony growled hitting his foot on the ground.
Suddenly the car makes a scratching sound and they see the car rolling forward into the fall to the driveway bellow. Steve eyes widen but Thor, Nat, Jane and Darcy quickly push the car down to stabilize it.
"I'll do my best sir" Steve says surprised at how honest he's being. Even though his relationship with Fury has been uncomfortable in the last months, Steve still wants to please him.
"I wish" Clint says and throws a paper at Tony's forehead. Tony picks the paper back with a smirk and throws it back but Clint moves away and yells "Faaaaail"
HORRIBLE RUDE PEOPLE?! Okay, Tony didn't deserve that! It was a long day of humble actions for no selfish purpose, were he treated his friend very well not too hide something he should have revealed a long time ago!
They both run outside to get in the truck with the others, and drive out the house with the sirens on, blaring in the streets to let them pass. They're in the fire location in less than three minutes, it's a five story building, smoke is coming out of every window but the fire only started on the second floor and several civilians are coming out of the front door running and coughing.
"Sort of" Sam explains and pushes Steve to some seats near the entry "Tony angrily told us how you felt guilty about what happened to Coulson, how you always stopped by his photo" Sam points "And how we all treated you like garbage because we blamed you too. Well, not in these kind words, maybe"
His lips taste so good against Steve's. Steve hands touch Tony's waist and pulls him closer while Tony's arm goes over his shoulder, his other hand guides Steve head throughout the kiss.
Yeah, Tony just walked away from him to go talk with Bruce, but they're obviously closest friends since Tony arrived. Bruce always treated Tony well since that first day while Steve was an asshole, so yeah he kinda deserves the exchange.
No. No, no, no, no, professionalism. He can't date a colleague. Tony is out of his reach right now, no way.
"Oh my God" Sam groans throwing his head back and Steve smiles a little "Do we have to go through all the ‘is not your fault’ situation again?"
Steve chuckles letting himself be pushed inside by her "Melancholy is my life Nat, don't take it away from me"
It takes them twenty seconds but they do bring someone, alive, outside. The water’s turned on and the paramedics immediately get the man, the relieved smiles of their team is evident, and somewhere between the fury in his eyes, Fury's also seems relieved "You two are in trouble" Fury warns.
"Aw, don't thank me..." Tony said looking at the phone. His misery was right there. If he gave the phone to Steve, game over!
Bruce had taken the blame for him without thinking twice, and although Tony knew what was going to happen, he let his friend get hurt for him. Bruce. The most innocent and nice person he knows...
They all get up at the same time and run to the trucks, Steve sits next to Natasha as always but Tony sits in front of him and for several seconds he stares at him unsure if he should say something, do anything.
Steve covers his mouth. He can't believe what Fury is saying, it can't be true. All this time… Fury didn't hate him?
"Just try not to have another" Steve answers taking the sugar pot away from Tony and the man chuckles. Steve smiles, he looks around where everyone is eyeing them with weird looks, and shrugs.
Steve can't even admire the fanciness of the house as his attention falls on an adorable and quite sexy Tony in pajamas, squeezing his eyes and with his hair sticking every way possible "Tony" Steve breaths out. Oh embarrassment.
Maybe Tony should be worried if Scott has just fallen of the stairs and is now being smashed by foots of oblivious kids, but he's looking at Bucky, who slightly turned to look behind (probably after hearing Scott's yelp) and was now excusing himself from Natasha to climb the rest of the stairs where... "Fuck! It's where Steve has classes!"
So okay, thanks to Bruce's so strangely specific and useful information, Steve has something to work from when he didn't really think he would have.
"Hey Captain!" A chorus sounds in the table where Sam, Natasha, Thor, Jane, Betty and Wanda are eating breakfast.
Fury gets up "Rogers" He points to one of the chairs in front of him and then looks up at Tony and narrows his eyes, saying slowly "Leave the plate outside"
It was public knowledge there was still a very thin line of tension on the 199 firehouse that put Steve in the middle of its breaking point. All coming from the two month ago accident were the blame, the consequences, and the new responsibilities all fallen on him. And he had too much to prove to the people whom he still needs forgiveness from.
Steve bites his lip to not just kiss that damn idiot and instead picks his hand. Tony seems surprised by the act but doesn't push away, simply looking up at Steve "Think about it. Think about this and come back tomorrow. I believe in you, and we want you there. So I'll be waiting for you tomorrow, show me that stubbornness of you again"
"Well" Clint echoes "All we needed. Another jerk" And even though everyone would say the first one is Loki, Steve sees Clint eyes turning to him.
Steve picks the crow bar trying to push aside the burning debris, anything to get them out the front of that stupid door "Tony, I'm going to get you out" Steve says ignoring the way his voice sounds desperated.
Steve looks back at Bruce confused and the man pushes him back some steps again "When I asked Tony why he acted so rudely when he arrived here he told me he didn't meant it. He was just trying to be funny and friendly but everyone seemed angry at receiving him"
Steve just smirks at him and Tony sends him a kiss "Miscalculated sorry, but you know it's not today you're getting rid of me"
Steve follows Bruce inside to a still going war "Bruce, for fucks sake, tell them that the couch is horrible" And yeah, Steve could see it in the way Tony was seated at the table, with his legs crossed and his face a frown that could be seen as anger when in fact it’s confusion, the why maybe they all didn't like Tony.
Steve ignores them, heading to his locker but then Natasha is saying "That seems like a bunch of made up gossip, but knowing Stark it may be true"
"It's not going to work Rogers. We know that" Steve ignored that in order to apply even more force at the iron, yelling as he gives all he has, throwing away the guilt of the pain moans and coughs coming from somewhere around him. He was not leaving his Captain inside that door "Steve. You have to stop"
"Tony went back Chief" Steve says walking to where Tony is yelling for no one to call out "I'm going to get him. We're heading back immediately"
After every one goes slowly back to normal, Maria appears in the room calling for him "Rogers, Fury wants you in his office"
"Maybe... oh yeah, Rhodey always says something about me putting on a show. Which I don’t" Tony says and then mutters to himself "I think…"
"Secondary. We got a new one" Clint keeps saying "And then, to get worse, we get the Mayor's son. Hurray. Happy life, let's just deal with it shall we?"
Steve is only momentary taken aback by confusion and then he's getting serious, because he is the responsible one "Last time I checked this wasn't a hotel" He says.
Steve looks at the group photo, taken during his training and winces. He hates that photo, he looks like a stick draw. "Yeah... that was during my training, let's just say I've worked out since then"
Next day Steve is able to keep himself calm until Tony appears in the doorway, then his heart literally skips and oh how better it is when you’re not aware of it. Now he has no freaking idea how he should act near Tony! Internal groan.
Even if the man acted wrongly, after everything they went through the night before, Tony didn't deserve to deal with all of Steve's accumulated anger and frustration.
"What?" But before Steve can react,- Tony shakes himself out of his grip and runs inside the room "Fuck"
Steve just sighs "I know. I am, it's just..." Steve looks back at the photo "I feel like I have to remember it"
"Hey!" He said too loud and immediately shifted as Professor Coulson turned. When the threatening look was over, Bucky turned to Clint again, whispering something Tony couldn't understand, but seemed deadly threatening. Clint looked at Tony, fear clear in his eyes.
Scott's smile dropped, "Oooh not Barnes man! I robbed a police station once and still wouldnt try it with Barnes!"
"Before I regret it, yes." Tony answered. Steve looked at his phone and Tony shouted "Not in front of me silly! I didn't pursue that phone through the entire school to see your reaction to it!"
"Yeah, I guess so..." Tony whispers and it's like the best melody on the world. His eyes close a little and he seems to be getting so close until-
"Holy. Fuck" Steve says and if Bucky's worried expression was any signal he probably looked panicked.
"There's sugar in the kitchen" Steve points. The room falls unusually silent, even Tony lifts an eyebrow.
Taking the money, Loki walked to his brother telling him to calm down, being so subtle while picking Steve's phone from the table that Tony almost missed it. As Loki steered a puffing Thor out of the circle of people disappointed by the end of the almost-fight, Director Fury came from nowhere and grabed Loki by the wrist.
Fury sighs and sits straighter "That's why I put him with you" Steve frowns confused "I knew you would be the only person understanding enough. Have patience with him, it's a personal request"
"Rogers can you hear me? Stark is alright, he's out. He escaped from the back" Fury says calmly "Get out of there"
Steve sighs and gives another step back. Wow, the Mayor is always such a great guy, it's hard to believe what Tony is saying, but people are not always are what they appear to be, especially politicians. Tony could also be lying to him, wouldn't be a surprise, but Steve still feels like believing him. And anyway, with this kind of pleading Steve is just naturally weak.
Steve sighs and turns to them "Look guys, I think we judged Tony too quick. He's actually not as bad as he looks like"
Steve frown deepens, what are they doing? But before he can say anything about his team behavior, Tony says answering with bitter cheer "Aw the reception in this house, always so lovely" He steals one of the muffins in Steve's plate and bites it. Steve grits his teeth "But are you all so jealous my father is the Mayor? You can take him if you want" He says with his mouth half full.
Then Odinson stormed out. Suddenly Tony felt a clench in his stomach, did he just send someone to fight with Steve?!
But of course, the plan is ruined as the ring bell shouts and a bunch of punks go out of the classrooms running like loose chickens. Scott is almost making his
Steve groans again loudly, and of course Bucky just laughs even more "Oh my God! Let me call Sam. This is hilarious"
"There was no way to avoid that explosion Tony" Steve says between gritted teeth "That's why I gave that order"
He sees Tony shrug from the corner of his eye "A little, yeah. Meet him sometimes. He was a nice man"
"Hey Stevie, what's up with the new guy?" Darcy asks from where she's dangling in a chair, a lollipop on her mouth.
Loki narrows his eyes at him and says "I don't need any unasked opinion from a Captain selected by lack of options"
"Coulson got me jackass! I'm grounded for a week, you stupid shithead. All because of a stupid text!"
Bruce looks up at him and smiles. It can't be honest, it can't "Give him time Steve, it's all going to take a while. For all of us. But it will pass"
She giggles shaking her head "All backwards Steve" And she keeps walking away into the hall saying "I'm fine, thanks"
Steve lowers his finger and Loki starts the truck, the equilibrium is not right with the loss of the human weight and the anchor gets out of place. Steve only needs to hear Tony's "Oh-uh" to know the car will fall on top of him, he jumps.
It's surprising to get in Tony's neighborhood. Yeah Steve already knew he was the son of the Mayor, and yeah it was public knowledge the Mayor was also a famous enterpriser, there is Stark tech everywhere in the city. But for some reason, Steve never connected that fact to the probability of Tony being rich!
He saw Bucky look at the phone under the table - Shit! -and then he immediately looked at Tony. Tony made several brusque movements for Bucky not to read it, but the guy smirked! The guy totally and deliberately smirked! Fuck, he was going to read it.
Great. Another one "Yes Chief" He says as Fury passes him a folder, probably with all the information about Tony he needs but the papers aren't even in his hands when the emergency signal rings.
It hits Steve, hard. It's not the first time and it's not like Loki is known for his sensibilities, he just likes to be rude. And it still hurts Steve like a bullet through the chest. Because it's true "Loki" Thor says suddenly serious.
She smiles back and nods pointing for him to go to the counter probably to get his breakfast. He goes and crosses his arms over it saying "So what's today?"
He goes outside two times with people in his arms and returns, and the lookout is done when Fury orders in everyone’s radio “Evacuate, now.”
"Yeah right, you're just not getting caught!" Scott made a slight proud smile."Look, if you steal a phone from a guy's pocked I'll invite you to my next party."
Fury caresses the helmet with his thump and Steve shuts his eyes. Fuck, Fury lost one of his closest friends and it was all Steve's fault! Steve looks at the floor and murmurs "I'm sorry..."
"What?" Tony looks at him with honest disbelief "No way, you look like a five year old baby who hasn't been eating because he gives his food to abandoned cats"
As he takes a curve, Bucky is in the middle of the stairs clearly trying to flirt with Romanoff, phone in the back pocked of his pants. Hopefully he still hasnt read it or he would have other priorities.
It's like being back to it again, on that day, hearing that yell. Steve sucks in a breath still staring at the photo and remembers again that it was real and that it has passed. He has to move on now.
"You're new in our unit?" Steve says crossing his arms skeptically "The Battalion Chief didn't tell me you were coming"
"The trust has to work both ways, hasn't it?" Steve says, his hand instinctively touching Tony's arm.
And Thor beams at him "My brother decided to pretend to read a book when he noticed my argument was the right one and he was losing the fight"
Tony just chuckles a little and says "Okay" Which Steve is grateful for, he hates people making fun of his nonexistent romantic abilities "So about what you said yesterday, about me and the team that is" Tony says putting the picture in Steve's bed "I've been thinking about it"
Steve would take a big breath before entering Fury’s office if it wasn't so ridiculous. It used to be so easy, like going to a friend's house, no need for invitation at all. But now it it’s like stepping into the purgatory, so hard to knock and wait for the 'come in' to step inside.
Tony steps back with a big grin in his face, and goddammit it's so beautiful, Steve has to smile too "Will do!" Then his smile falls "But hum, seriously can we just keep this..." He waves between them.
Steve thinks, watching Jane uncertain on opening the door, her eyes saying ‘find a fast way to hold it or we won’t save them’.
He wastes some more time to text all his resolve to Bucky and then gets up of his bed with more strength to face his team. He wants to be their Captain, and if they let him, he will be the best Captain this unit ever had after Coulson!
Steve’s team immediately follows him to the car, “Steve, we have two people inside. Both bleeding out” Jane yells already at the passenger seat, at the same time Darcy is looking through the window saying “We’ll get you out of here”
"Why don't we go home?" Tony said very slowly. Steve just nodded, and they got up quite fast in a silent agreement not to talk about this and went their separate ways.
good speech about what being a Captain meant and I think he kinda inspired all of us" Sam points a thump inside "It wasn't long, but I guess it was the push most of us needed. I guess it is time for all of us to let go" Sam eyes him pointedly.
Tony looked at the guy beside him. Peter Quill, the guy that always leaves a million prejudice in his parties.
Suddenly everything makes sense and Steve gives a humorless laugh "So that's why he's here" He says to Fury "That's why he's staying"
"Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Stark!" Professor Coulson said looking at them angrily. They immediately shifted themselves up right, and closed their mouths. "Keep quiet. As I was saying..." and he continued his boring class.
Fury pinches his lips and looks up at Steve and Steve doesn't know what to say "Chief I-" He starts but Fury just holds his hand up.
The word makes shivers go through Steve's body "That's what you do when you have a firefighter that needs guidance, you don't give up on him"
He closes the door and sits next to Steve with a huff, putting himself comfortable. Steve had to be amazed by his shamelessness in front of his probably new Battalion Chief, there's no way Fury would tolerate the rudeness.
The rest of the day goes just alike. Tony is mostly ignored, beside Bruce who he finds talking to him in the sofa once, someone even whispers loud enough for everyone to hear "Thank God Bruce is good enough to have pity on him" It makes even Steve feel bad about it, but Tony seems to ignore, Bruce is visibly uncomfortable and Natasha scowls at the person.
Steve walks in the firehouse, looks at Coulson's picture for a whole ten seconds before he’s getting inside and greeting everyone, "Morning guys"
"Blah blah blah, you're completely irresponsible and incapable of doing anything right, same story since I was born" Tony waves his hands around "He said to come to you, so basically it’s your choice if I stay or not"
Everything was like it was supposed to be. And yet it was not. Because Steve can feel the tension the moment everyone feels him take a step into the room. He can tell everyone is faking all that happiness, that no one forgot what happened two months before, that all that familiarity is fake. It's really painful, and yet, it's all he has.
"This guy is suicidal..." Steve hears Wanda whisper as he crosses his arms and turns his body to Tony.
Steve chuckles and then, to his surprise, is Clint who comes around with a sandwich on a plate and puts it front of Steve. Steve looks surprised at him but Clint just smiles "Bruce doesn't know what he's talking about. This are the best sandwiches that you‘ll ever taste in your life, made by the real chief here, Clint Barton, me" Clint grins ridiculously.
"Yes Steve" Tony eyes shine honestly at him "How many times have I failed you? You gave me one change, two! And I fail you a third. Worse, I just downright hurt you with this one" Tony throws his hands in the air letting them fall again. "I'm not a good fireman. I will never be!"
"I guess, yeah" Steve nods. Then he looks around and turns to him again "I guess I wasn't the only one who needed a push, right?"
"Hi Tony..." He says too, too late! And then blushes because when he looks forward Bruce is still there, looking at him with a raised eyebrow and an amused smile.
The man then tries to hold his arm up for Steve to shake and Steve notices he has an incredible amount of alcoholic drinks in his arms. He shakes it anyway, kinda awkwardly "James Rhodes"
"Not mine to say. And a recruit’s life shouldn't determine how you perceive their work" Steve nods and gets up to excuse himself to leave, but Fury interrupts "Steve"
The heat is intense and there’s smoke everywhere blocking the path, but Steve is trained to guide his team to the stairwell and head for where the fire started. He doesn’t have to say it for the group to spread out and start calling “Fire department, call out!”
"Son of a-" Bucky yelled angry and Tony saw him pass running fast after Bruce. Poor kid. Tony will have to pay him big.
Steve looked at it in the middle of the smoke and his body acts irrationally for him, making him pick the iron and hit it several times on the metal door screaming in anger. Open. The. Fuck. Up.
"I'm not going to leave you!" Steve yelled, pushing once more time the damn crowbar against the stupid metal door, a fort like door that wouldn't give away.
Steve is suddenly hugged and jumps a little surprised "You idiot" Sharon says in his shoulder. "That was stupidly dangerous"
"I just thought that maybe the girls wouldn’t be able to take the civilians in time, and if we anchored the car at least it would give us enough time"
Tony nods and Steve awkwardly turns to walk away "Has anyone ever tell you you’re stubborn too Cap?"
"Yeah just forget who died, because a man cried and someone decided to give us a sermon. That's how problems are solved these days" Loki mutters sarcastically but of course, everyone ignores him and Steve does just the same.
Steve groans "Oh, fuck the rules" And kisses him again. Tony giggles but pulls Steve’s face to his with the same desire, humming in agreement.
"Tony, I’ll give you one more opportunity to stay here. It's my obligation as a Captain to at least try give recruits a chance to get better" Tony eyes widen surprise "But I´m going to ask you to try and get along with the rest of the team"
"And you cannot not sound like a factual hermit scientist" Steve says and Bruce groans throwing his head back. Steve laughs and fondly shakes Bruce's curls "I'm kidding, you're lovely Bruce"
"I was. I failed to deal with my problems, I kept everything inside and avoided confronting my whole unit" Tony eyes him not convinced at all "I failed by wanting to throw you out on the first day you were there" Tony rolls his eyes "I failed by yelling at you yesterday-"
Sam eyes him when they´re getting in the trucks but there's no time to talk. Four minutes they’re at the car accident, three cars went against each other in the bridge and one of them was hanging at the broken barrier, almost falling and with civilians still inside.
The new man though just smiles widely "I'm Tony and I'm the new recruit of your truck, I loved the dumbstruck reception but I have to admit I expected a party"
"He is a jerk. Everyone from every unit I know has been with him at least a week and they all spit his name like their saying 'dog shit on my shoes'"
"Okay" Fury nods, a hand in the man's shoulder in a silent comfort "Sam get your squad to start fighting the fire, Steve-"
The day is a torture without Tony there. Steve keeps nervously wondering if Tony will come the next day or even right then but Steve hopes the same way he doubts. And the team constantly asking him about Tony doesn't help, he just keeps answering them 'tomorrow' and wishes he's telling the truth.
"Bucky, c'mon..." Steve tried shouting unsuccessfully but his friend was already gone. Still he murmured "Just don't hurt Banner."
"But Steve's number's here!" Rhodey said holding the phone out of Tony's reach, as they fought for it.
When the end of the shift arrived Steve finally had his time alone with Tony - he dressed purposely slow to be the last one leaving the locker room, ignoring Sam's suggestive eyebrow dance when he dismissed him, and maybe luck was on his side because Tony was also the last one staying.
, no Anthony likes to be called Anthony" He says while taking the plate with him and following Steve.
Steve stays silent. Okay. Point. Right, it's true. Steve shouldn't even be so angry about it, yeah Tony was infuriating but he deled with the twins, Clint, Darcy and Loki. He was being personal about Tony with all that happened to Coulson. He shouldn't be.
"You have a minute" It's Fury's only response. Really? Not even why the hell the new fire idiot went back or what is actually happening, just a yeah bring him back from whatever the fuck is happening?!
And after some agreement grunts and comments the team is back to itself and Steve eats in peace with Betty's company.
"I like all colors" Bruce says in a voice that leaves no argument as he walks to the coffee machine.
Steve frowns and tries to remember what happened that first time but can’t "We misinterpreted him?" Steve asks, he was already suspicious of this.
Steve is laying in his bed when suddenly Tony jumps on top of him, Steve eyes wide at the man currently locking his thighs and oh my God! He can feel his own cheeks burn and tries to immediately sit up. Tony just grins at him seeming completely oblivious of how that kind of intimacy can affect Steve "To-Tony!"
"Is that what people say of me?" Tony says and looks up with a tired expression "That I'm here because of my father?"
When he gets outside coughing, everyone is there looking worried at him and he's so angry! There's so many emotions rushing through him, why? Why did Coulson die?!
Bruce sighs "Tony. He looks confident, therefore smug and full of himself" Bruce explains "It's what he looks like naturally even when it's not what he's trying to transmit" Steve eyes wide as he starts to understand "When we're hearing him from here, we automatically know he's just trying to make a friendly joke, but for those who look at his face and see his usual smirk, just assume he's making fun of something or someone"
"Just give it back Rhodes..." Tony pleaded. But looking at Rhodey facing his phone he knew it! He just knew it! Even before the-
"Maybe not. But you helped a lot afterwards, so let’s deal with what's in front of us" Steve smiles.
"How would I know?! Not his mother" Sam says taking his phone out. Steve laughs "So movie night, huh?"
"It's not that" He says amused, shaking his head "I just... I think I'm not ready to lead this team. I feel like I keep failing"
"Steve..." Tony stares at him "I don't care what happens to me I won't let anyone else die on my watch because I didn't check"
Tony lets the things in his arms go and turns all of his body towards him "I never asked but I was curious about that kiss" Steve eyes widen and he's pretty sure he's blushing. Tony smirk just widens "I thought you liked Sharon"
"Yes, Chief" Steve nods "As the Captain is my job to guide him, and for that I should at least give him another opportunity" He can't help but smirk a little at that.
"Really? How much for the phone?" Tony said pointing at the confused Steve who was now being screamed at and threatened by a outrageous Thor, calling everyone's attention, and gathering people that wanted to see a fight.
Steve only flinched a little at the mention of passing time with Bruce and oh, oh no jealousy. He's the worse! And then he throws that thought to the back of his mind because he has to smile proudly at Tony.
"You know, I meet Phillip in my first years as a candid" Fury says pointing at the photo Steve was holding, and Steve now notices Fury has his helmet in his hands "We weren't the best friends at first but we warmed up" Fury shrugs "He saved my life, I saved his, and we became partners, friends for long years" Fury explains and then looks at the helmet in his hands "And when I became Chief? He was as happy about it as I was..."
The duo turns to him "What? Really?" Clint says with disbelief "If they can do it, why didn’t Fury?"
"Is this unit 199?" A strange voice makes itself loud in the main area and everyone falls silent. Steve turns along with everybody to the door and it's almost unbelievable. The man there is in full firefighter suit, holding his body in a fluid motion, a mischievous smirk surrounded by a perfect beard, beautiful chocolate eyes showing true confidence and a styled haircut, it was like the man was on a magazine trying to prove how sexy a man in uniform is. Then his voice sounds confidently in the whole room "I'm kidding. You have a very obnoxious plaque on your entry with your unit number. I just thought I'd made a cliché entrance"
"And now the fireman is a furniture stylist" Pietro sarcastic voice is heard. Steve frowns, why did the team act so bad at a joke?
"Ah" Tony says keeping his eyes on the picture. "So hum, I see you and Sharon talking sometimes" The topic throws Steve out of guard "You seem very..." Tony coughs in his hand "With each other" God! Even Tony noticed?!
"Barton! Barton!" He whispered to the other, who was sleeping with the head on his palm while drooling.
And Coulson was walking away again. Fuck! Tony immediately took out a hand full of money from his pocked, and Clint's eyes got bright.
Sam smile drops a little and worry crashes in Steve's chest. Sam makes a signal for him to follow him so Steve excuses himself and walks to the corridor with Sam.
The guy forced himself to sallow, cleaned the ketchup around his mouth with his sleeve and smiled "Wow, Tony Stark knows my name! I can't believe he's talking to me."
"That's probably the only thing to admire in the guy and even that brings us problems" Steve nods at that because, well, it's true. "Anything else you wanna talk about?"
"I can't tell you what to think of him, but I'm asking for the sake of this unit unification that you try to get along with Tony instead of immediately attacking him. Maybe you'll be surprised that he's not has intended on offending you as he seems to be"
He finally just gets closer to a random doorman and asks "Could you tell where Tony Stark lives?" And yeah, why wouldn't he know?! He just pointed to a building and Steve thanked him heading to it.
"Alright hum, Steve" With a sly motion Tony leans himself against the doorway and once again Steve has to admire the confident and fluid way that Tony moves his body, like he's always ready for everything "I wanted to apologize to you. You were right, it's my first day and the first thing I do is being an asshole to you and distrust your order, it was just a jerk move, I never think before I act, it's stupid, that's not an excuse, I'm sorry" He babbles, waving his hands around "It's just some tough shit, Fury already threatened me so don't be mad with the poor guy. I promise I'll try to do better from now on so yeah... give me just one more chance"
"We got the man outside" Steve sobs, gripping Tony's shirt and he passes his hand on Steve's back "And he told me to take him out but it just closed, it just locked! It all happened so fast" Steve breaks down in crying.
Oh. That's right. Rhodey faked dying to get everybody sooner out of the class, just so Tony could catch Steve's phone. Now he'll have a week doing boring work afterschool just for helping his friend on a stupid mission...
"Steve-o, what's with the happiness? Got laid?" Darcy says from where she’s playing video games with Pietro, and Steve laughs uneasy, looking around, looking for a face.
Fury jumps surprised, looking wide eyed at him just for a second before falling back to normal "Yeah. I'll give you his address, bring him back Captain. This is an order"
"Well" Sam says, passing a hand on the back of his neck "After you ran away yesterday, it wasn't the only emotional breakdown we had"
Apparently in the end all he wanted was to make Coulson proud, and just Fury’s approval means more than Steve could ever have expected. Was this really all it was needed for him to have his confidence back?
"Oh, he got suspended but it's routine now." Thor sighed. "I got a opportunity to ask how Miss Jane was, and look," Thor showed a piece of paper, "She gave me her number!"
"Oh no. No, no, no" Steve shakes his head. He hasn't even been thinking about Sharon for weeks "It's Tony" He rasps.
"Look" Tony says his hands calmly touching Steve's chest and pushing him away, Steve gives a little step back "I'm not saying this for you to go all pity on me. I would truly appreciate it if you didn't comment on this around, it's just..." Tony lets a puff of air leave his mouth and looks away "This is probably my last change, God you have no idea how lucky I was Fury actually let me stay here, what he's risking, and I'm already blowing it up by being, well, me" Tony swallows and looks back at Steve "You seem like a very cool righteous guy, and I should have trusted you, so I just want to honestly ask you to just give me one more chance" Tony shows him a finger "And I'll try my whole best to always follow your orders and do things right. Please. Just one opportunity"
"I'm not leaving without you! I am not leaving you here!" Steve said with way much more conviction that he was actually feeling. There was someone yelling in the radio, calling for him, calling for the Captain, giving orders, asking questions, all of it at the same time. But there was no time, it was all happening so fast, and any second could be the last...
Then, after some seconds, the door opens up to a man glaring at him. Steve steps back on reflex, a shiver passing by him at the sudden scrutiny.
"Yeah, look, you see that blond guy over there? He's holding a phone he stole from...hum..." Tony looked around the place until he pointed at a girl, "Foster! He stole it from Foster!"
"It was kind of a mistake... I actually wanted to delete it myself but you have a code. Yeah, it would have been an invasion of privacy but-"
As Bruce got closer to him, it was unmistakable the bruise he had on his jaw. Tony automatically jumped to touch his face.
Steve wants to be offended but he actually laughs at that, shaking his head. "Exactly. And I was nineteen trying to be a tough fireman"
Yet he always listened to that voice, the command he has been following for years, his job, his life "Phil..."
"What am I? A waitress?!" Pietro complains but does as he's told, saying "Clint bring the juice. We have to teach those assholes how to play"
, I won't accept another answer. That's what Coulson would want anyway, don't be so hard on yourself" And just like that Fury pats his shoulder and walks away "That was the first and last pep talk I will give you Captain Rogers, now man up!"
Steve spend the rest of the night in Bucky's bed complaining about how much of an idiot he was, it must have been a really pity act since Bucky only pushed him off the bed twice.
Sam grunts dropping his console on the couch "You girls are terrible" Then he looks at Steve and smiles "What's up man?"
"Well, first of all" Clint says and suddenly closes his locker with too much force, making it bang horribly loud "We lost our Captain"
"Since the first time I saw you" Steve says maybe a little too angry "I've been inspired by you!" Tony eyes widen at that "The thing about you is that you don't give up! You're an annoying, stupid, stubborn idiot! But a good one at that, because you will do anything to do your job right. You will stay in a building about to collapse, you will throw yourself of a bridge, go back to save a shadow you're only 60% sure you saw and run into a room on fire! That's you" Steve points at him "It's stupid, but it's beautiful. You’re brave and you care and that's all it takes to be a fireman. Fight your father's opinion, stay where everyone hates you, break a rule just to save someone - don't get me wrong, that's so stupid of you - but I still admire you so fucking much! You're a fireman at heart and there is nothing or anyone that will convince me otherwise"
"What, Rhodes?" Tony says distracted "He's my shoulder to cry on, but between you and me he just went there to steal my booze. Jerk"
Steve clears his throat feeling altogether awkward, and Bruce thank God just says "Let's go inside" Steve sighs and is about to walk with Bruce when he remembers something, and stops the man by his arm "Huh?" Bruce looks at him confused.
Clint groans and Pietro tsks. He hears Darcy whispering something probably offensive and the group near the television chuckling. Tony seems to pretend not to hear just to turn to Bruce and say "Hum, this is really good"
"I can do this Cap!" Tony says climbing down the wall. Steve immediately grabs the robe and so does Thor cursing under his breath.
"Not everyone is good expressing themselves. The same way you can't flirt with Sharon, Tony can't appear nice"
Steve walks up the firehouse entry, the large letters saying 199 visible on the top of the garage. He passes by the fire trucks and goes directly inside. From there he can already hear the cheerful voices on the living room, it has always made him smile but his feet automatically stop at the hallway, an habit he still hasn’t lost, and his smile fades. He has to turn, look at the wall next to him, look at that photo again and remember all of it once more.
And it's like a dejávu, like it's all happening again. Steve carrying a man when the fort door falls shut and locks behind him.
And Steve let it all go, because Tony is here, and his arms feel warm and safe, and Steve just wants all that damn pain away!
"Nice day. I guess I have to thank you again, because hum" Tony waves his hand around "The team. Yeah, they're apparently very cool" Tony says with narrowed eyes, then beams "Oh and I tried to work out what I said and how I said it. Bruce helped me out and I think it worked!"
"Thor got the girl!" Rhodey said. And Peter climbed to the man making an exaggerated party and already teaching dick moves Tony hoped Thor never followed.
Before Thor can go apologetic, Steve swallows the lump on his throat and changes subject engaging Thor in a new conversation, with a brand new smile.
But all Steve can think about it's a smile. It's a laugh. It's a face, brown eyes, perfect beard. Something shy, something sensual, something leaning into him after a dangerous call. It's a courage, a sensibility, an happiness, a conviction and a honesty. All so perfectly fit in one man.
"Fuck" Tony breaths out. Then suddenly he jumps and hugs him, and Steve shamefully squeals "Thank you Steve, Captain my Captain"
After the shower the evening is quite calm, if a wrestling war in the living room could be somehow described as calm.
Tony stops what he's doing to raise an eyebrow in his direction, a smile playing in his lips "What Captain? That seems a lot like you’re looking for an opening spot"
Tony nods and Steve pushes him for Tony to go in front, just to make sure he doesn't lose him again. They get out in time, coughing and his team turns on the water.
“Hey Steve” Clint mutters, almost a whisper as the team makes noise in the background. Steve looks at him and Clint winces guilty, hesitating before saying “I’m honestly sorry”
Loki laughed and the one to worry now was Thor "What happened, Director Fury? Is my brother in trouble?"
It's only after a while that he hears a light knock on his door and is surprised to see Tony walk in "Hey Captain" Tony says almost shyly, if that's even possible.
"You can't stay! This is your job, you have to save the man next to you and leave, now. Or the three of us will die in here"
Tony stays frozen in the middle of the room eyeing everyone for some seconds and then finally says. "Okay. This was creepy" But before everyone can take it back he just smiles and says "Hey guys, everything okay. Thor how are you? Fancy to see you all being nice, it's almost like- oh shit, am I going to die?!"
"Aww but Steve you were really cute. Not that you aren't anymore Captain" Tony eyes him mischievously and okay, Steve is not blushing, he's not! And he will forever deny he hoped Tony was actually flirting with him.
"Tony, I trust my team. I trusted that the girls would do it fast enough. And that's what's lacking you! You don't trust me, your Captain, and you don't trust your team. And it won't work until you do"
Steve has no idea for how long he cried, or for how long they stayed hugging, but he knows he was just too exhausted and emotionally tired to think when he whispered "Thank you Tony" leaning away, and right in the middle of his "No problem Cap" He focused on those beautiful lips and simply kissed them.
Steve looks confused at where Pietro is under his shower, midway to putting soap around himself "Which fuck?" Steve asks bluntly.
Steve looks at Tony's desperate look, then back at the house, then Tony and then Fury about to mouth 'no' but Steve already made his decision "Chief, fifteen seconds" And faster than he could he runs inside pushing Tony with him, however yelled behind them was too late.
Steve laughs shaking his head "Hey! I exercise" But then Clint and Tony are already fighting each other over the space in the counter, Bruce sighing exasperated at the mess they're doing, the people on the table laughing too loud at whatever they’re talking about, Darcy is pushing Pietro out of the couch screaming about winning, Loki is being sarcastic about something...
"Meh" Steve shrugs exaggeratedly "There's is nothing. Never have. Just... this hum, awkward pinning? Let's change subject"
"And ruin the surprise?" Tony says grinning. It's not funny "Okay, in his defense I just warned him like" He looks at the watch on his wrist "Half an hour ago, so let's give him a break" Then Tony's eyes go wide "Oh are those Nutella toasts?" And shamelessly walks to the counter where Bruce is shrugging and handing him a plate.
It's probably the only honest smile Steve will see all day directed to him, Sam holds his hand up and Steve bumps his palm with Sam's in a simple greeting.
Sam sighs and his smile falls again "That's the shit. Last time I saw him, last evening, he was leaving the place without his suit"
He gives the man a half wave saying "Hey guys" Though Loki expectedly only rolls his eyes and turns to the book he was reading again.
Steve doesn't look at them when he turns to run outside again. Forget about it, forget about it, forget about it is the mantra in his head. He can't let this affect him, he has to remember what his therapist said: If he lets the guilt consume him, it will only affect his job, no matter how much Clint is right the best he can do is do his best.
Steve spends the drive back thinking about what happened. A shiver passes by him when he remembers Tony taking off his belt, was he just plain suicidal? Then again he threw himself under the car to save it, and that first day he wanted to stay inside the building just to make sure he saved everyone. Was it… to not take Thor and Nat with him?
"Yeah, okay. And then more calmly he said what a good Captain you were, the fact you were the only one to ever believe in him and give him a change and how that proved you were a worthy Captain - Jesus man, that was romantic! I can't believe you lost it" Sam interrupts and Steve all but blushes "Anyway, he went in a
Steve looks one last time at that door, making himself mentally sure there's no one to save there and let's his crowbar fall on the ground before running out.
"On it Chief" Steve interrupts already making a signal for his team to follow him to Block B, while Sam answers their usual "Yes Chief"
Steve smiles at him, Tony looks wide eyed and his cheeks are in an adorable red color that makes Steve want to kiss it desperately.
Next morning Steve is looking at Coulson's picture when someone arrives. He's surprised Tony just stops next to him looking at the same picture, but says nothing.
"Has hum" Tony says and waves at the whole wall, at the other pictures too "Any of the others also gone in your shift?"
That’s a really idiotic thing to do when someone is just trying to comfort you. Not to mention it's the most unromantic thing to do when you just spilled your guts and tears in another men’s shoulder.
Tony eyes widen and he looks back at the building like he's considering running back again, before he looks back at Steve. "If he's there we’ll cook him alive, we can't do that"
"Tony!!!" Suddenly came Peter Quill, "I got a D!" He showed him the paper "Ehehe, It worked! It actually worked!"
Pietro shouted from the other side of the class "He's on his period" making everyone laugh, and Mr. Coulson frown.
"Rogers!" His radio buzzes and Steve freezes "Rogers, get out of there! The building will collapse on you"
Steve head shots up to Sam's face but the man is just smirking "Where is he now?" I gotta make sure of that, is left unsaid between them.
"We're charging. Five bucks per gram" Pietro says and Bruce comes scowling at him and takes the Nutella out of his hands, Clint just stays seated on the other side eating his breakfast.
Tony looks at the hand and twists his lips "That's beautiful Cap, but I'm just not..." Tony shakes his head "I'm not a fireman. I tried times enough"
Steve just watches mildly surprised, a little concern and the rest confused. But the elevator doors shut with the man inside and Steve is left in front of an open door, so he just shakes his head and enters the house "Tony? Are you there?"
Steve grits his teeth and hisses "These rooms, Tony, aren't even used" He sees Tony's eyes widening "We checked it. And now we have less than a minute to get out of here before this thing all collapses, you heard me?"
Steve has no idea if he smiles or just makes a weird face because he loses track of his senses when Tony slides his hand on his chest, and Steve dumbly watches him walk inside. What was that?
For a job that involved so many accidents and difficult decisions, Steve never thought that he would feel, ever, this impotent.
Tony sighs and looks away "Look, I'm not made for this okay? I thought I could be a fireman, prove my father wrong but in the end he's probably the right one"
"Yeah, that must be a good sign" Steve says sarcastically opening his office door and letting Sam in.
Tony ran, made a cool pause to compliment Romanoff "Hi bubblegum." He wicked at her only to receive a middle finger in return and then ran up again, until stopping abruptly at the end of the stairs where Bucky had already met with the beautiful, perfect, magnificent Steve Fucking Rogers.
"What. The fuck. Is happening here?" Clint says and Steve is stopped from answering what's probably everyone's thought by a call.
"You don't need any more sugar" Bruce looks at the kid’s dripping chocolate toast "Take this to your sister" He says handing him a plate.
"The only one? How about being respectful, nice and humble?" Betty voice sounds next to them and even Steve was surprised to see Betty angry.
"Why the fuck are you the boss and can get late whenever the hell you want?" Clint says turning to him with a grin.
And for the first time Steve doesn't feel like flushing and falling on his knees for being hugged by her, maybe it's the adrenaline but he just hugs her back and says. "Worth it"
Tony eyes widened and he looked at the phone, then to the blushing Steve, then to the phone again. Then he actually tipped the word Tony and the phone unlocked. He looked surprised and confused at Steve.
"Jesus, you're so funny I forgot to laugh" Pietro says and there's a group of snorts around. Steve frowns and Wanda says in a warning tone "Piet"
"Because she was three times heavier than we both together!" Steve says defensively, breaking in laughs "Not even you would have done it alone"
"Oh, no. I ran into the lobby Mr. Stan was cleaning and didn't see the sign saying to be careful with the wet floor. I fell with my face right on the ground. Bucky even helped me getting up. He isn't as bad as he looks, you know? He was actually nice and worried about me. Then he asked quietly why I thew him a book and - you know Im not a good liar Tony - I told him it was actually you who did it and had hidden behind the stair rail. But look, he laughed at that, he actually laughed a lot. And called you an idiot, but I think you’re safe. Anyway, what was that all about?"
"No" Steve says in a rasped voice and Tony stops, everyone seems surprised and worried but Steve says more sternly "No" He takes his helmet and throws it on the floor, and for some reason his whole unit shrieks or gasps "I fucking told you" Steve yells slowly, and points at a wide eyed Tony "To not go the fuck back inside! What's your problem to just fucking ignore everything I fucking say?!"
Somehow they’re faster than usual. The fire is burning everywhere, they have to constantly change routes, yell warnings at each other, and save people through the fire escape. The fire was spreading quickly and if they wanted to get everyone out they had to work really fast.
"Traffic excuse, classic" Pietro snorts. And Loki mutters "Well at least you don't have to worry about being late with your father it that chair" Which makes most of the group laugh.
Steve frowns a little, watching Tony's face as the man rolls his eyes and tells they bicker like kindergartens. It's like Tony says something completely rude and offensive but he doesn't even meant it to sound like that even though it completely does.
Steve chuckles and shakes his head giving a step closer "No, let's just say I grew another crush. Kinda strong one if you want to know. And maybe, just
And Steve can hear the ceiling falling into pieces right from where they came. No matter where Tony is getting himself into now, they just don’t have the time "Don't go there Tony!" Steve says coming to the man.
"Ah, well, about that..." Tony said taking Steve's phone out of his pocked. "Loki had it." He technically didn't lie.
"Oh yeah, you're so confident now. I wanna see you play with these cheaters. If you win I'll pay you a dinner"
Tony frowns a little "I lost but I was never really close to anyone I guess. I'm not very good at making friends" He smirks at Steve, though that is really just uncomfortable "But I can tell at least two people who still make me cry"
Pietro slapped Clint on the head and he woke up looking for the end of the world. Pietro just pointed his thumb to Tony.
"Oh, well, it's easy! You just have to worry about Professor Strange, he sees everything. But the rest is blind or doesn't give a shit."
"Hey Bruce" Steve smiles. His team is really prompt to make him feel good about being the Captain apparently, and that just makes him even happier!
"Yeah, oh look Tony, sorry I couldn't help you but you ain't gonna believe it! I was pushed down the stairs and guest who caught me?! Sam. Fucking. Wilson! Ahaha, I couldn't believe it, one minute I was seeing death in my face, the other I'm on the arms of the basketball captain, asking me if I'm alright! Awesome!!!"
They both break in laughs, a long ago memory in his minds. When they calm down Sam is shaking his head "I told you one day we would laugh about it"
"No! Don't talk ‘cuz you have no notion of the sweat I've spend to make a good test, and you just gave me an F ‘cuz you don't like me! NONE OF YOU DOES!" He shouted, pointing at all the teachers.
"God can you just shut up and kiss me already?" Tony rolls his eyes but before Steve can laugh Tony hand touches the back of his head and he pulls Steve into a kiss.
Steve looks at Tony's face and that's probably the most honest expression he saw on the man. So Tony is human huh.
"I say we make Fury a complain about it" The voice almost throws Steve to the ground, and he looks up to the person closing the fridge door, balancing an exaggerated amount of ingredients in his arms "Can't have a boss teaching us wrong habits like this" Tony winks at him.
"Sam, losing to girls! Get out of here!" Clint yells like he's actually offended and Sam grunts getting up.
Steve ran his hand on his hair in a frustrated gesture that made Tony act by instinct and pass the phone to Steve, saying "Read it."
Tony sighs frustrated, letting his arms fall on his sides "And how am I supposed to trust you?! You're all a bunch of jerks!"
"Ah, the day is being weird. I was almost beated down by Thor and I think someone stole my phone..."
And when Tony reaches him all of Steve worries are left behind. He's not actually as nervous as he thought he would be, and suddenly talking with Tony just seems so easy "Mission accomplished" He says just between them as the rest of the team keeps bickering around.
Tony shrugs "I want to be a fireman. My father doesn't. Whenever we have a fight and decide we hate each other again he just needs to make a call, ask a favor, make a threat and I lose my dream job" Tony rolls his eyes but Steve can hear it in his voice how important and personal it is "I always try again. Then I'm kicked out. Until people just stop accepting me in any cartel, unless they're crazy courageous rebellious motherfuckers like Nicholas Fury" Tony snorts.
The scene in front of him is one he isn’t sure he could live without seeing again some time, in better circumstances.
to me. Yes, I’m yours! Let me come, Captain Asshole!” Hearing Tony beg is doing it for Steve, and he pushes himself harder, pistoning in and out of Tony.
When Steve pulls out and moves, little arcs of sensation travel up his entire body and he gasps, enraptured. Tentative, but then more sure, Steve shifts and thrusts again. Tony cries and wails, his eyes scrunching closed as tears leak out the sides. It’s so very good. It’s the best thing Tony has ever been, has ever done. He doesn’t know why he ever avoided this.
Tony. He liked fucking Tony, and long ago that would have been enough. He wants and loathes what he wants until it’s a tangled web of self-hatred that makes him want to snap, to come apart at the seams and not be put back together.
His hand comes down and thwacks loudly onto Tony’s bottom. Tony flinches and whines once, saying nothing.
“I think—I think I wanted to hurt you.” Steve clamps down over Tony’s hips and reaches up to cup Tony’s face in a mockery of intimacy.
“I see that.” Bruce kindly picked up the pieces of the broken mug, placing them on the counter while Tony huffed, slack-jawed and eyes closed in a mockery of patience.
“Ok, looks like we have something. Married 1935. Deceased 1945. Oh. She died of asphyxiation in her home.”
Things drag on like this for the week that they have off of their respective jobs, though Tony is working through it. Despite Steve’s best efforts, Tony destroys breakfast and dinner with what would be impunity, but for the fact that they don’t get to eat in the end. Steve ends up making meals for himself and stops helping Tony. He realizes that the omega needs to fail first to understand why it’s important to succeed.
Tony is more cognizant than he’s been in days, but he’s still underneath Steve as Steve undulates and presses deep into him.
His knot loosens just that little bit, and Tony lurches back to pull off of it, sliding up the bedding and out from under him, pushing further away from Steve. It hurts to be pushed away from Tony, but he lets it happen, because he knows Tony needs the space from what’s just been said. He watches as the omega curls up in the corner of the bedding, nesting as he holds his stomach and tucks his legs up.
Now comes the tricky part, which is getting the pill into the food without anyone noticing. He can’t do it in the tower, so he’s decided to eat at the restaurant. The waiter brings his dish and a bag with his and Tony’s food. He plops it in the booth next to him and proceeds to crack open the capsule and use his fork to stir it into the carbonara.
“Who had the issue with ruts?” They all think about what Steve has just said, how it’s been quiet and peaceful in the tower. No aggravated Tony going around and snapping at people for no reason.
Pepper sashayed over, if nigh running in heels could be called that. A little late, but better than never.
He had. He was that man. He was Rory, Sean, Connall, Angela’s husband. He was all those men and when he saw himself reflected back, he shinks back from it.
“I understand Tony.” But inside, he feels close to disintegrating. He can feel pieces of himself splinter and crack at the thought that Tony will
when it comes to non-humanoids—and makes for the door, tentacles looping around the handle and pulling it open.
“No, no, it’s nothing like that! I didn’t do anything besides what’s already happened, I promise. I just—I shared his heat with him. I think it went well.” Steve waves his hands at Fury’s inquiry, trying to promise with his body that he’s not a threat to Tony anymore.
“Thor’s taking out a squadron down on 6th.” Tony is starting to slip from Iron Man into Tony Stark. At this point, he’s too jazzed up to be careful. The sweat is drying as fast as it’s pouring off him, but it doesn’t change that it’s hot in the suit, and tiring having his arms thrust forward in front of him. His biology is doing him no favors right now, as his whole body aches from the activity. Technically, he shouldn’t be doing this. With his heat so close, it’s straight up hell.
“Yeah, right. Well, dinner is done. So you can go now, thanks, and goodbye.” Tony gets up and goes directly back to what he was working on. It’s cold of Tony, but it’s nothing less than he expects. It will not get him down though. He’s riding a high, a victory.
“Yeah, I could. But there’s a lot to this. I know beta or Alpha to Omega is the easiest change, but the change is still not easy.” These are just details to Steve. If it’s doable, then it’s almost certainly the right choice. Now to get Tony to accept that himself. Steve hasn’t even gotten to that part yet, so overwhelmed with having the potential to solve this problem between them, between Tony and the world.
“You paying attention to me now, doll? That’s right. Good little omega. My fucking good boy. I loved watching you take him. Maybe I’ll let him use you again, as a public service, but you’ll always be mine—”
When he wakes up, the lights are stunning in their brightness. The floor and the ceiling are lit with a crisp white that defies any type of lighting he’s ever seen. The bed is more comfortable, with its pristine sheets and not a single spring digging into his back. He gets up and takes a look around.
As for the text, distance makes the heart grow fonder, and if Steve wants to lay hands on Tony, he’s going to have to come to him. It’s a good day to be Tony Stark.
Tony struggles to push his hips up and against Steve’s clothed erection, and Steve regrets that he has clothes at all. He attempts to shrug them off, but instead rips the zipper of his pants and puts finger sized holes through his boxers. He’s no better with Tony, forgoing taking his Omega’s shirt off in lieu of tearing it. His Omega isn’t helping with his constant movement, but Steve gets it. Tony needs it so bad, he can’t not move.
“God, Tony–” Steve approaches and kneels down on the hard floor next to Tony, grabbing his shaking hands off the table and clutching the nearest close to his chest.
“Bless me father for I have sinned. It’s been—” Oh, he shouldn’t lie. He can’t lie. “It’s been about eighty years since I’ve last been in confession. I’m—I’m Steve Rogers.”
He’s done with Nat’s new toys within a day before moving onto providing Clint with endless practice arrows. Then he spends time working on making a decent pair of pants for Bruce when he hulks out. He does not think about how the same fabric could have good implications for the Captain’s uniform. No, he saves that for last, like the procrastinator perfectionist he is. His identity has always been wrapped up in the things he creates for others. He’s not sure he could stand the rejection, so he’s got to make anything for the Captain look impeccable.
“And what if he is?” Half-hard in his pants now, their faces are leaning closer over the bed, breath warm on each other.
In the makeshift cafeteria, he sees the haggard faces of a few hundred people. It’s hard to look at it all in the face. The worn clothes, dead-eyed stares follow him even after he finishes his food. The guilt weighs on him; he doesn’t want to spend time with these people, even as they’re the ones he’s supposed to be saving. He doesn’t want their misery to rub off on him, and how selfish of him, he thinks.
Steve knows he’s obsessed. That he’s gone beyond simple desire and is hurtling headlong into the territory of infatuation.
“I don’t doubt it. It takes premeditation to do what you did.” Because Tony can never shut up, he pokes the sleeping bear.
“Caught you, babe,” Bucky purrs into his neck. Tony blinks up at Steve, who leans down and whispers, “sweetheart,” before lining kisses all along his jaw and down his neck.
“I don’t disagree Steve. I’d send him to bed leaking; ridden hard, and put away wet.” Bucky has moved to stand behind Steve, and Tony watches as the alpha casually works his cock over with a hand. Waiting.
Tony thinks he’s going to like whatever new game the boys come up with. He might not even mind if he ends up being pursued all throughout the tower. Either way, he’s gotten what he wanted, and he thinks that his alphas did too.
As he heads home, he lays his head against the window of the train, letting the hardness of the pane become punishing on his scalp. He’s exhausted. Everything in his body feels like it wants to slither out of his uniform and into the drains that dot the side of the road. He belongs in the sewers, like so much trash. What he’s done to Tony is cruel and unthinkable now. Steve still believes that Tony shouldn’t be so promiscuous, or shouldn’t have been, but everything else? Omegas are not like he thought. He’d never realized that he’d been so sheltered before.
Tony doesn’t hesitate, stripping off his secondhand shirt, tossing a bottle of lubricant on the mattress before shucking the rest of his clothing off. The Andorian unzips his pants, revealing an underwhelming icy-blue penis that’s partially erect, double ridged, and weeping blue-tinted precum. Not the least interesting genitalia he’s encountered.
“And you’re all about style, aren’t you?” Well yeah, I mean he’d never be caught dead in the getup they’ve thrown Rogers in. His Iron Man suit is unparalleled fashion.
Tony complies beautifully, licking up Steve’s cum like he’s born to do it. As far as Steve is concerned, he is.
“I don’t think you will. But remember what I said. Okay?” Iron Man’s thrusters turn on and he starts to hover off the ground.
Tony doesn’t lick at all before he bites down, hard. Steve is used to pain, however, and doesn’t let himself mind it, since small acts of rebellion are all Tony will get at this point.
This is their first kiss. Even at the marriage ceremony, they’d only bitten each other. Now, as Steve strokes at the gland where he made Tony his, he feels for the first time that they’re one. There’s hope here. Small and tentative, but blossoming nonetheless.
“Steve, please, Steve—” It’s lost in whimpers and softer pleas. Steve doesn’t stop otherwise. He works Tony over like a recalcitrant animal that needs training. Each suck is like a lash, and every motion of Steve’s mouth has Tony heeling to Steve’s desires. It’s brutal in its pleasure, how
“I’ll bench you Tony. I’ll sit you down on the sidelines—” Cap was in his face now, skin red and brows furrowed.
The weight of Steve’s gaze now is like touch, rolling over the planes of his body with sweet pressure. Slowly, Steve lowers himself, cock already in hand. Tony doesn’t know when he pulled it out, but he doesn’t care. It’s
“That’s all I need then.” And Bucky is on him, lips and teeth clacking against Tony’s, his hands roving around Tony’s frame, pressing into his skin. Tony groans, his nails biting into his palms as he clenches his fists, trying to resist. These alphas, they take what they want, and they don’t care about the consequences for any omega. Tony is so tired. He’s barely even relieved that it’s not a game, but the thought crosses his mind that it’s more frightening now that he knows this isn’t for fun.
He’s lazing on an inflatable that holds about four people, if you’re ambitious, when rat snitch Pepper, the good time ruiner, shows up. Of course, she wants to talk, and Tony who doesn’t do that four-letter word, doesn’t want to.
That leaves Nat and Steve, and it goes without saying that he’s very much not interested in her company. In fact, he would love to take their debate to the gym where he can get rid of this feral, cold energy that tells him he should have had his hands around her neck the minute she walked into the room.
“So yeah, what are they doing in the clean energy business without Tony?” Banner, who is a true broseph, backs him up.
“Listen, I know this is hard for you, but we do have to work together on this. Don’t make this more difficult for yourself. I will enforce strict discipline.”
It’s just the way in which he gets to have him has completed something unfinished inside of him. The thing is, Tony doesn’t doubt that Steve will be accommodating to his other identity. He can feel it through the bond, how much Steve would love to have Tony every way he can. There isn't a way to lie through the bond. Tony had always known that, but the experience was a separate thing entirely. He didn't know what was going to happen at this point, but he was, for once, able to lay his paranoia at the feet of their relationship and hope that Steve didn't break him.
After the ridiculous gala, Tony is exhausted. Frustrated, too. Fury reached out the very next day with cryptic instructions letting him know that they’d tell him where to go the day of. It was a lot of protection for one measly heat. Tony would have been suspicious if he didn’t think that some of that protection was for his sake.
He thinks he might have liked to meet Edgar, to see a man who treated his omega with care and love. If he could just have one example, one person where he could anchor himself to their actions and know that it was right and good, he wouldn’t feel so confused. It would be nice to see Edith more often, but he didn’t know if that was possible, or if he ought to.
Steve looks at the card in his wallet that Tony gave him, but realizes he wants to get this for Tony on his own dime. The government had given him back pay, and SHIELD did pay him for his services. When the total comes up to over two thousand dollars, Steve grimaces, but pays it without comment using his card.
“Mr. Stark, there’s protocol—” The Omega woman did a quick pump of calming pheromones that were noticeably potent, but wouldn’t work on Tony that easily. He’d known she wasn’t just a pretty face, but it took special talent to issue soothing scents on command when a situation had gotten stressful. He wouldn’t be surprised if she was also the Alpha recruiter.
“How? These processors aren’t going to light themselves on fire. And I’ve got some upgrades to do for the suit. Did you know that JARVIS gets bigger as he ages? I’d say he’s getting chonky, but my baby boy is growing up and out of the harddrives in my suit. Gotta upgrade!”
Tony’s sweet little whine pouring from his scrunched up mouth, tears streaming down the cracks in his face as he takes all Steve has to give, Steve’s cock rippling through the already cum-stuffed passage.
“He hasn’t won anything. I can take care of myself.” The announcement sends a cold shot down Steve’s spine. What is his pretty little mate up to?
He never suspected that they would go to such lengths to humiliate him, so here Tony is, doing his level best to conceal where he is at all times.
“I’m not going to rat you out, since I don’t know exactly what you’re doing yet. Not today anyway. It would destroy Tony to find out one of the people he most admires has manipulated him this way. All for his own selfish purposes.”
But he realizes she hasn’t when she presses the binder into his hands with an insistent look. And in her own clever, devious way, she’s letting the risk of a heat coming early push Tony into making a decision. If he didn’t admire her diabolical play, he’d be more angry. As it stands, he’s running out of time anyway, so he doesn’t comment on it.
“Well, in this case, I’d say love isn’t blind because I’m gorgeous.” Tony tries to be nonchalant, but Steve can hear him swallowing saliva back. He can feel the heat rising off Tony like steam off bathwater as the man steps forward once more.
Finally he plants the device, and strolls around to the other side of the table while explaining that the other materials are… immaterial. As Barton can get them pretty easily. They just need a power source to kick start the cube.
“Make me.” Which, after he says it, Tony is sure that this man could, given the first class glare he’s receiving. In a robotically voiced huff, Tony dismounts the doughnut and goes to meet what is surely another attempt by Stern to commander the armor.
Tony gulps. They’ve done this before, somewhat, Steve asking Tony to pleasure himself while Steve is deep inside Tony—but this is beyond what he’s used to. Even so, Steve has asked him to do it, and Tony doesn’t want to say no.
“Hydra. You’re effing joking, yes? Captain America. Is Hydra.” He sees the light of realization that comes into Tony’s eyes. “I could tell them all.” It looks like Tony is glitching out, his eyes rapidly blinking, and the movement of his lips a staccato rhythm.
“Add fat to the pan, turn it to medium.” Tony does as Steve says, before stopping and waiting for further instruction.
“I can give you more, after. Come bathe with me.” Steve tries cajoling his omega. Tony peers out from beneath his lashes, brown eyes flashing with some unknown emotion.
“Tony?” And ok, he’d drifted for a second there. He’d rather be in a board meeting getting the side eye from accounting for wearing sweat pants again. Pepper knew he did everything he could to avoid mornings, but it was also the best time to get him to agree to things.
Steve wants to bite Tony again as Tony nuzzles at his neck. But he remembers what Tony said and instead just runs his tongue over his teeth, reliving the first time he bit into Tony at their wedding. Tony had tasted so good, he remembers, but at the time he hadn’t wanted to think of that at all. Now it’s all he wants to remember, to cherish that singular moment that bound Tony to him. He wants to rewind—no, he wants to unmake—everything he’s done to Tony to keep himself from this moment.
The wolf bites down, not as hard as he knows that it can, but hard enough to pierce his shirt and sink into his shoulder. Tony cries out. It’s ungodly painful, and he’s been bitten by a dog before. This is nothing like that. The teeth are razor sharp and of all the stupid things he thinks of as it happens, are that he could get an infection. He should be so much more worried about the fact that he’s being bitten, which is a precursor to being eaten.
They walk down the halls together silently, and Natasha leads him to an unmarked closed door and gestures at it before walking away. Steve opens it and walks into the office, which is unassuming and filled with paperwork. Behind the desk stands Fury, wearing the same thing that Steve has always seen him in.
Nat is wrong. Steve doesn’t do regrets anymore. Not since Peggy and Bucky taught him to go after what he wants before it’s gone. He’s getting it right this time, with Tony.
Steve whispers, almost to himself. Tony feels the warm churn of the reactor tech, revving up its power to deliver a single, focused blast to the enemy. The structural integrity of the suit is holding;
“Of course. I’ll be in the nest.” He gets out of the tub and grabs a towel, wiping his body down with it. He’s not clean, exactly, but he did get most of his groin washed off.
“So you decided for him. I’ve always known you had a selfish streak, but this is beyond the pale.” Steve can’t believe his friend is so completely against this. They agreed that this was best for Tony, and yes, maybe Steve didn’t ask Tony, but he doesn’t see Tony complaining at all about not being an Alpha. Of all the things he expected, the first was that Tony would put up some kind of fight, and yet, there’s been radio silence on that front. If Tony didn’t want this, he would have taken stabilizers a long time ago.
“And I know just where to put it.” He thinks maybe he can lead it up to where the Chitauri are still streaming out, but the tug of the autopilot tells him otherwise. The Mark VI is beaten and battered, his power reserves so very low, but he should be able to maintain air in space long enough to ensure the bomb hits an enemy target. Any enemy target. Since Obie, he’d fixed the icing issue, but there’s only so much air. He tells JARVIS to switch to recycled air the second he breaches the portal.
“Ride me, sweet thing?” It’s all Tony can do to comply, and he braces his hands back on Steve’s powerful thighs, pushing his body up and down on Steve, his much smaller cock bouncing in front of them as Steve looks down to watch.
“No, Tony. I know you can handle yourself. I just thought—well I thought maybe I was supposed to help you. But I realize now that it doesn’t help. Though I honestly hope you don’t have to see him that often, or ever, alone. And that I can be by your side.”
“Rules are made to be broken, by me, not you. Not Beth in operations who has a little crush and a hankering for HIPAA violations.”
He plates the meatloaf and steams some broccoli to go with it. He eats his portion first, needing the fortitude that comes from having a full belly to face this.
After he’s done flying through the streets of the Bay Area, he heads home for some much-deserved relaxation. In the meantime, he’s humiliating a C-Grade villain while lounging on the water surrounded by his... product. These are his worshippers, his humble acolytes of Extremis.
It’s not technically a tranquilizer. SHIELD had developed it for use in interrogation. It hinders higher brain function faculties, leaving a subject able to walk and talk, but not much else. In that, it was deemed not as effective, because no one on the substance could access any of their most precious secrets. But it is perfect for Steve’s purposes. He doesn’t need Tony to make sense of anything for the first hour.
“Yeah, yeah. Ok, open the containment unit. But I swear to god if you start getting mouthy or handsy and do that groaning thing, your ass is grass.” Tony is the one with the mouth. It’s a constantly moving thing, whether he’s speaking, biting the inside of his cheek or curving his lips into a smile, it’s distracting with its restlessness.
He wants to laugh at the almost purposeful misuse of his last name by the delivery driver, but his mind is distantly stuck on cavernous, frigid Siberia and the cauterizing heat of Steve sliding in and out of him. Even in these moments of domesticity.
It’s been another week since his conversation with Nat. Tony successfully downs his fifth pill, and being in the home stretch is grating on Steve something fierce. He’s going to take good care of Tony. Better than the kind of care Tony has heaped upon himself. He just has to make sure that Nat doesn’t interfere.
“It’s Captain if I’m riding this ship.” Steve tries to suppress a laugh, and be stern, but he can’t.
“You know what? Fuck you.” Tony starts tearing off his shirt, leaving his undershirt on. He yanks his pants off, standing there in tight boxer briefs that leave nothing to the imagination.
“Now fuck off back to SHIELD like a good boy. Don’t tell them all the obscene things I did to you, unless you want to come to me indefinitely. I don’t think you’re ready for that though. So keep lying, my honey buns. You do so well at duplicity these days.”
“Sorry about the hair thing, I know you hate it and I shouldn’t do that. How about I get started on the pasta when we get back, and that should be perfect timing for you to have the wine ready to go in.”
“Yeah? Well get in line.” Hawkeye is rightfully furious. Poor dude got whammied hard. Tony shudders to think if he had been working with SHIELD from the get-go on the Tesseract, what would have happened. Loki probably would have won by now, and that’s not even arrogance. Iron Man is formidable, and the only person with codes to stop it is Rhodey or Pepper. Even then, the first thing he’d do is create a suit without any checks or balances, if he were under mind control.
It takes Tony less time to wake up than Clint, and within 72 hours, Tony’s beautiful brown eyes open, and meet Steve’s, who hasn’t left his side for more time than it’s taken to grab a shower and food before returning.
“Steve, mmph!” Tony is crying out Steve’s name when he descends on Tony’s lips, locking them in a sweet, soft, and sucking kiss. Steve laps at the entrance of Tony’s mouth, nibbles on his lower lip and tugs it down. Tony lets him, opening his mouth and letting his tongue graze Steve’s. Steve kisses him like he’s drowning and needs the air from Tony’s lungs to breathe. He swallows every tiny cry that’s jerked from Tony by the thrust of Steve’s hard length and leaves kind and doting kisses all over Tony’s face, dipping into Tony’s mouth as if to remind Tony that he’s not forgotten about its existence.
When Steve looks, his heart skips a beat, Tony is crouching near the fall of the bridge, with only a loose robe around his waist "Tony, what are you doing?!"
"Aaaaand he's here" Darcy says loudly at the same time Clint comments "I was having a good day until I saw you"
"I can't do this" Steve says distressed and looks directly at Fury "I can't- I'm not a Captain! I'm not Coulson!" Steve points at the helmet "I'm sorry I couldn't save him, I tried everything I could" Steve eyes go to Clint and then to the ground "I really, really tried and I couldn't. I'm not a Captain, I'm sorry. I give up"
"Something must be very wrong" Sam nods, walking while reading the file. "Damn. He's been in more firehouses than any firefighter in history"
"Phil wouldn't want everyone mopping at his photo every time they pass by it" She says pointing her hand at the picture.
Steve sees Tony clench his fists and give a frustration growl "Ah fuck you, Steve!" Tony shouts and suddenly... suddenly it looks like his eyes are watering and Steve feels guilty even though he has no reason to be "You have no fucking idea what you’re talking about!" Tony passes a hand on his hair taking a breath and nods "I'm going to pick my things and go, tell your friends congratulations for getting rid of me"
"No! I won't leave you, I will open this door" Steve says frustratingly hitting those debris aside. He won't let anyone else die again!
"You can't act like that. I don't care if you don't like Tony, but he's part of our team now. And we're all adults, so let's just deal with it"
Peter cleaned his throat dramatically and walked to the middle of the room, close to Professor Strange.
"Nah, he was probably faking. Oh, by the way, Stark send you something." Bucky said taking the phone from his pocked.
It's a last second instinct to jump out of the building through a window, with the body on his shoulders falling with him, and then it's all collapsing on their shadow like a last farewell. All the voices in his radio now scream of that name. Of that man.
It was a brief touch of lips. Steve pushed forward and their lips touched and it just looked like they were made for each other. But it lasts one, two, three seconds and the fact that Tony completely froze was enough to wake Steve up.
“Can you do it?” Steve asks and the woman nods while Darcy receives the machine to open the door. Steve turns to the rest “Okay, we need to find a way to push the car-“
"We'll solve it then" Sam says and as always his optimism gets Steve "Meanwhile how about I call Barnes for a movie night? He'll be thrilled to hear you complain about the new guy"
There's a burst of laughs around, and Tony rolls his eyes, but with a smile on his lips "Jerk, I'll catch you, you'll see"
Steve nods and looks away too "It was also my fault Coulson died" Steve admits and he can feels Tony tensing next to him "That's what you’re missing"
Steve chuckles and receives the plate Bruce gives him and the cup of orange juice "You should fight Nat on that theory then"
"I think so yeah? He didn't speak with anyone- Hey Steve!" Sam yells when Steve runs back inside, spooks the hell out of his team but he doesn’t care, he goes directly to Fury’s office and bursts in.
“Couldn’t agree more” Tony mutters, letting out three more special words that are almost lost between they're lips, but Steve hears them anyway:
As Peter was almost crying, telling his sad life story for the teachers to feel bad about him and his grades, Tony was already sneaking to discreetly steal Steve's phone from Loki's jacket.
And thank God for Fury, because Steve really didn't felt like going through the whole conversation Fury solved in three sentences.
"Oh shut it! Just deal with it Steve, it's not the first time you have a crush on an idiot. Remember when you meet Sam-OUCH!" Bucky yelps when Steve throws him a couch pillow, already sat up.
Steve walks to sit in front of Tony and doesn't miss the man's smile "So how are you?" He asks, forcefully ignoring the fact everyone was looking at them like aliens.
"-Rogers!" It cut through him, the voice, so calm and firm even between everything that was happening. Steve couldn't, he just couldn't...
"We had time to evacuate the whole building" The man says, interrupting to couch some more "But block B" The man points to a corner "They got stuck, too many debris. The fire started on top but I don't know if they can be alive"
"Being yourself" Steve pats his shoulder. And the way Tony stares at him intensively makes Steve want to kiss him! Damn, could he have a chance?
Anyway, Tony winked at him and got out of the room as he was hugged by sentimental teachers really falling for his shit.
"There's nothing between us" Steve says too fast and Tony looks at him with acceptable disbelief. "I mean. It can’t, obviously, when we're in the same truck and I'm her superior. It would be unacceptable, unprofessional"
"Loki connect the anchor to the truck, push it at my signal" Steve orders "Thor can you handle Tony?"
"It was on that wall" Tony waves his hand to nowhere in specific, and then points again at the picture "But is it? Is it you?"
"Breakfast?" Bruce interrupts them and yeah, that's how Steve ends up in a conversation with Thor while Tony goes lose some battles on Mario Cart with the rest of the fanatics, being a quite calm loser after having bragged so much and Steve just sees himself more and more screwed up knowing he's totally falling in love.
"Morning Cap. Tell me those are not cornflakes, why do people even eat that?!" He says walking to him and shaking the card box "Tastes like the damn card"
The smiles he receives and the good mornings back to him are enough to relax him a little. Maybe he didn't have to face this so directly. After all, this team is the best!
But like he's reading his mind, Tony says "Don't worry about it Cap. It's all alright" And he smiles.
"Damn straight!" Clint answers "And an intervention for his food obsession, how can a guy this buff eat more than all of us together?!"
He feels something wet on his cheeks and Sam is stepping forward saying "Steve-" but Steve makes a signal for him not to get closer and looks at the rest of the team.
Breakfast is interrupted by a call, a gas leak in a building but the evacuation went fine and the building was safe without accidents. And during the rest of the day everything was calm until almost the end of the shift...
Steve turned, he lets go off what is in his hands and he sees the figure sprawled on the floor, already unconscious, and runs to pick him and put him over his shoulder. He heard concrete falling on one side of the room and a surprisingly advanced fire took most of the place.
Clint and Natasha go together, Thor goes with Jane, and Sharon with Darcy. Steve goes alone but today he signals Tony to follow him and they choose a corridor to call out for victims.
Tony hand falls on his shoulder and it's like a slap on his face, all the pain he keeps bottled inside wanting to brush out. Steve bites his lip "Hey..." It’s Tony's voice. So comforting.
Bruce twists his lips, seeming to be thinking, and then says "Come with me" He softly picks Steve's hand and guides him to the entry, but they stop behind the doorway where no one inside sees them and Bruce finger touches his lips in a signal to be quiet and listen in secrecy, so Steve concentrates on what is happening inside.
"What a shame" Tony rolls his head to the side, a mocking amusement making him look cocky. The rest of the team stared at him with the same unamused twist of lips, so Steve wasn't the only one thinking the same.
When they get to the factory the chemical fire is visible from almost every window and the smoke is covering the whole block. Steve starts immediately making strategies to stop the fire while Fury some feet away from him asks one of the civilians already outside, coughing and covered in dust. "How many people are still inside?"
"... No really, it looks like a snake swallowed this couch. Green and brown, who the hell choose this colors?!"
And well, seeing Tony walk away with his hands on his pockets, Steve could think that maybe, even with him here, it wouldn't be so bad.
Bucky made sure Coulson was far enough, but as he was taking the phone from his pocked, Clint stole it.
Fortunately, Professor Coulson was passing next to Bucky and he had to hide the phone, so Tony took the opportunity to call Clint desperately. Meanwhile the son of a bitch Rhodes was only making fun of him!
But then "I don't need you to defend me, Mr. Captain" Tony says offended and Steve is so confused to why "Thank you very much"
She snorts and they walk up into the main room. It's still painful, but never stops feeling like home. At least now it all came back to the same, Wanda was pushing Sam out of the couch with one hand as they played video games, Sam calling on her cheating while Darcy laughed on the single couch, singing about victory as she twisted her body to the right along with the console.
Steve heads home feeling a renewed sense of purpose. Tony is still where he left him, in the workshop. Dinner that night is a sordid affair, with boiled down broccoli that is tasteless to the driest, most inedible chicken that Steve has ever encountered. It’s bland at worst, beyond consumption at best. Tony picks at it and Steve is certain he doesn’t eat more than one or two bites.
It starts with SHIELD’s training regarding Tony’s security systems. The hardest part is already taken care of: access. Steve lives in the Tower, sees Tony every day, and he’d say that Tony trusts Steve to do what is in his nature to do.
to learn how to cook. I don’t know how, and I know I’m not good at it. I burn water. That’s how bad I am.”
“Hurts.” Tony turns his head to look at Steve, his eyes pleading Steve to do something about the pain. Steve thinks about it for a moment, before knowing exactly what he’s going to do.
Steve is tired. So tired. Mostly of Tony’s mouth and his sharp Alpha scent that permeates the room any time he’s near Steve. No one else notices it like he does: the musky smell of cardamom, black pepper and cedar, leathery and too-hot. No one else is affected by it like Steve is.
It’s embarrassing how slick Tony is down there, his ass probably flowering open as it waits for penetration.
Of all the things that he expected, that was not it. Clint? An omega? How on earth did SHIELD give him this job? How did he even get so skilled? Clint had the moves of a beta, and as far as Steve knew, the man presented as one. He couldn’t smell a thing on Clint. Widening his nostrils, he tries to do so now instinctively.
“It’s time for you to go, Killian. Now.” The door opens and Steve steps through, giving a little ‘oh’ as he sees that Tony still has company.
No. The very idea of being with an omega roiled his stomach. They were needy and wanton, spreading their legs for whomever if allowed. Anthony looked to be no exception. He’d live with the man, he’d help manage the chaos that is his life, but he won’t be lured in by the siren call of an omega’s scent and body.
“Yes, it would be awkward, but I’d rather this than let the alternative happen.” Steve’s lips hover over his glands. Neither of them has moved from their position since Steve had pressed him to the bed. Steve’s hands, capable of such brutality that he’s never committed, linger on Tony’s flesh. Maybe he wants to do such wonderfully violent things upon Tony. Maybe he’ll clutch at Tony’s throat, pull his hair until Tony’s head rests on his shoulder, and tell him all the things he’s going to do to Tony.
“Fine. That’s just fine.” The muscles of Tony’s face are tight, his jaw set, and he looks alert, more so than he’s been the past week. The meal must have done him some good, and Steve feels the sting of guilt that Tony might have genuinely been suffering without food. But he reasons that there’s always the sandwiches he’s been eating for lunch. So he’s not starving.
He knows now that the metal man is Iron Man, Tony’s superhero costume and all-around containment unit that has kept him from getting bitten when he goes out. Steve doesn’t know about the others, who he’s only seen briefly, besides Bruce.
The problem starts with Tony. Fiercely independent, he’s done everything possible to keep himself unattached. And it’s been successful.
The buildings stream by now, the nuke wiggling uncomfortably in his grip. As he reaches several football fields away from the Tower, he turns on the repulsors on his torso, tipping up the nuke to glance the side of Stark Tower, up and into the portal.
At least Tony isn’t outright ignoring him. They eat lunch the very next day after their intimate talk that ended with Tony squeaking that he had to work on something very important. Steve let it slide, endeared by the fact that Tony felt so overwhelmed he had to distract himself.
Tony had woken Bruce up early. The files he had found had kept Tony up most of the night, but he figured Bruce deserved some sleep before he wreaked havoc on everyone with what was on SHIELD’s servers. Tony can’t sleep well anyway; the inflammation is getting worse, and his body is starting to feel overheated, his skin tight. They’re muttering over a file when Fury walks in, surprised they’re not working on the Tesseract.
“Hi, we’ve met,” he ignored Natalie in favor of going for Fury’s jugular. “So, what Fury, are you going to come Mike Wazowski me in my own home from under my bed if I don’t go public with Iron Man and join your little team? Or maybe you’re more of a closet monster.” It almost didn’t hurt seeing his assistant betray Pepper and him like that. He should have known that any woman who could knock another person flat on their back in a second was never going to be defined as normal. He would have to take a look at how they were able to compile her identity in such an organic fashion. But mostly, he was reminded of Stane. Which was something he kept buried with lack of sleep, copious amounts of alcohol, work, sex, and now, dying. Stane had company in this little mental dungeon; Howard and Afghanistan were not, and maybe not ever, ready for any kind of emotional processing. Natalie he had already processed into category “Alpha dickhead.”
“Steve. Steve. Steve!” It’s like his mouth won’t work around his tongue, and everything that comes out is slurred.
“Uh, his first name is ‘Agent.’” Tony strides over, following Pepper. His party of two is not becoming a party of three. No matter Coulson’s claims. Unless Coulson has a new toy, in which case, maybe he’ll get to hang out with the cool kids.
“If you would, please.” It’s weird talking to a disembodied voice in the ceiling, but his week has been weirder still. He’s gone from thinking the things he was doing were ok to do to Tony to realizing they weren’t ok to do to anyone. Even if omegas needed minding in a hands-off way. Steve still thinks that Tony shouldn’t have been so promiscuous or free with his body, but there’s nothing he can do about that now.
“Shh, baby. We’re going to help you choose. Just lay back, and let me have you. I’ll be so good to you.” Steve caresses Tony’s face, his hands rough from use, before he pushes Tony’s shoulders back down. Steve then reaches for Tony’s pants, and Tony slaps his hands away.
“I guess I’m almost done. Stick around?” Steve doesn’t answer, but he takes a perched seat on the couch, leg bouncing with agitation. Tony watches out of the corner of his eye as Steve tries desperately to distract himself by pulling fuzzies off the fabric and flicking them from his fingers to the floor.
The scotch is good, and Steve licks his lips of the few spilled drops left there before releasing the glass to Tony. They’re almost chest to chest now, toes pressed to one another’s.
“Of course I am! Do none of you not see how he’s running himself ragged?” Bluster has always been a good choice for Steve. It’s a response he’s used to having when it comes to Tony, since its roots are in his exasperation for Tony’s poor decision making. Tony is just so reckless, so uncontrollable. The things he does on the field and in the workshop can sporadically, without warning, endanger his life. Then there’s his lack of sleep and eating, which adds layers to the problem that Steve thinks someone should do something about. But there isn’t anyone to look out for him; Steve knows, because he’s been observing. The very idea of Tony off, all alone, taking on dangerous projects without his full faculties makes his chest tighten.
“Will you listen to me as an equal, Steve? Will you agree to be my partner in all things?” Tony’s chin is tucked up by his shoulder as he turns his head to look at Steve, who’s chest to back with Tony, Tony’s eyes dark with promise and so close to Steve’s that he can’t look away.
“I never thought it would be like this. I’m glad it was you.” And, he is. The alpha feeling is still there inside him, but it’s less upset than he would have guessed. He’s always liked Steve, always wanted the other man.
Tony’s inner walls tremble and clench around him as Steve expands. The sensation is unreal and he can feel himself slowly locking inside of Tony as his balls tighten and his groin tenses. Tony is still scrunching his eyes closed, taking every little bit that Steve has to offer, until Steve feels as fierce as hunger, as a fever.
“Last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye.” Fury let that one have its own space for a while, while Tony contemplated how to give a thank you card or a glitter bomb to someone he’d never met for making Fury a paranoid nanny-agent. “Now, unfortunately for you, we need Iron Man, and for that we need Tony Stark to get his head out of his ass and manage his health. There’s no negotiation here, you want to stay on the Avengers, you’ll take care of this. As we agreed.”
“Tony.” He’s almost bare under the armor, his thin tank top leaving him to shiver in the chill air. “That’s not what this is about,” Steve continues.
That’s why he needs to put a stop to this. For Bucky’s sake, at least. Tony isn’t what Bucky thinks; he’s not a good partner. Further, Bucky is going to be disappointed in him inevitably. Bucky deserves someone who can make him laugh, who can support him as he reintegrates into society. That’s not Tony. What Tony does is wear a mask, and Bucky deserves better than what’s behind the veil.
He loves Tony. His vitality, his indomitable will, the way he always has a comeback, and never backs down. Tony is strong and brave.
“I don’t regret the things I do. I mostly regret the things you do, like come here and give me disapproving looks. Do you have anything better for me?”
“Natalie mentioned that there’s another service she uses for heats. It’s more government officials than anything else. Very private, and they would accommodate hiding your identity as Iron Man.” There was something about Natalie, like how eerily good at her job she was. It had taken forever for Tony to find Pepper, and then a second, preternaturally good Omega assistant crops up? Tony didn’t really believe in coincidences like that anymore. But so far, topically, her identity had been clean. He’d been meaning to do more than a facebook stalk for some time now, but you know,
Cock already straining to orgasm, Steve sees a spark of awareness on Tony’s face. He needs to get on with it before Tony gets the idea to bite. He shoves back in, setting a sharp pace as he thrusts his cock halfway between Tony’s lips and out again. Steve thinks he’s got it measured now; only about three inches before Tony starts to choke, but it’s more than sufficient.
Choosing to ignore the unintended insult, he snatches Banner’s arm and begins to drag him towards the lab, escaping tall, blond, and loathsome taste in friends.
Which is how he found himself sitting in a giant fiberglass doughnut, scheming how to eat doughnuts in public as Iron Man.
“Will do, sir.” And it feels acidic in his mouth, down his throat, like he has heartburn just agreeing with the Director. Has he done something to shackle Tony? He thinks that maybe he should approach Tony and confront him about this, but then he remembers the tear-filled eyes that all but demanded he take indulgent care of the half-Omega. Tony couldn’t stand the idea that he was wanted only for his heats, and now that Steve had confessed he wanted Tony, it was like Tony would do anything to make sure it stayed that way.
“Hey, poking Banner is what Jesus would have done.” Steve does not like his tone, he knows this, but Tony’s not stopping now. “You’re tiptoeing big man. You need to strut.” He tells Banner.
At this point, he doesn’t care where any of them end up, so long as he gets a shower and some coffee. They can deal with the Tesseract and Loki tomorrow.
He latches onto Tony’s neck like a man starved, teeth sinking into the swollen gland on Tony’s neck. Tony moans, throwing his head back. Steve can feel the tightening in his groin from how his body is trying to push everything possible into Tony, even though he’s already pumped as much as he can inside of Tony’s tight ass. With a violent shiver, his body spends its last, Steve’s cock swimming in warmth.
When the screen comes up, he sees chaos. Videos of a giant green man laying waste to the area around him. A piece of technology that should rightfully be in SI’s hands if he’s correct, but has somehow been jacked by a Norse-freaking-god.
“Alright. I agree to the terms. I won’t try to escape the containment. But last thing, where the heck am I anyway? And why is everything so… different?”
Instead it was being sucked back into a childhood that had never existed, where he felt the simplicity of being safe and loved. Something that he’d never experienced himself, but somehow his body knew that this was the physical manifestation of. It was that first cup of coffee in the morning. The way it felt to put on the suit and dive off the tower, knowing he would be caught by the thrusters before ever falling.
“Funny things are.” Tony feels as though he’s on uncertain ground. He doesn’t know if Steve means what he says or if he’s privy to the game that they’re playing.
“It doesn’t. Just– don’t touch. Please.” What was with this sudden honesty? Fuck, he was obeying Cap. Just like that, all the walls and self-control he had built up were crumbling. Fear gripped him.
Steve reaches down in front of Tony, catching some of the hot streams of cum that jerk from Tony’s cock before raising his hand up to his mouth. It’s delicious, and fuck if he doesn’t just want to lick Tony clean. Tony is contracting around him, milking Steve’s orgasm into heights that Steve has never reached on his own or with anyone else. It’s hot, liquid inside of Tony, and it feels so good he can’t begin to imagine where his pleasure begins in Tony and ends.
“That’s not a life. I could see taking care of Tony, feeding him, loving him, being whatever it is he needs me to be, for the rest of my life. I can let go of these antiquated roles I thought I was supposed to take and just let myself feel, for once. Do you know how much I like taking care of him? It’s become the highlight of my day to be able to bring him something to eat. It’d be pathetic, maybe, but for the fact that I love it so much I don’t care. I don’t know when caring shifted from telling him what to do to enabling him to live the life he wants, but it’s happened, and it’s not going away. You can’t tell me anything in this world will be able to replace it, either.”
Surveying the place, he gets some more sun as he outwaits Pepper’s patience. It’s hot and perfect today, in the way San Fran weather usually isn’t.
“You have been. Such a good boy. Good omega. You want me to mount you, don’t you. Take my cock like a good little omega?”
“Inside me, please. Now, now, now.” Tony is a broken record, and the omega tilts back to try and catch Steve’s cockhead on his rim, succeeding just a little before Steve reaches down and helps him the rest of the way.
They discuss Tony’s events, and squabble over how many Tony will attend (half as many as he does), and whether he gets to drink (he doesn’t). Tony barely picks at his food and generally doesn’t eat much of what terrible things he cooks. Steve lets this go on; there’s no other choice besides giving into Tony completely.
“Tony. You’ve done so well. You’re perfect and mine, and I’m so pleased with you.” He praises Tony instinctively as he pets Tony’s shuddering sides and flanks.
“If I’m a hero, I’m a hero. Not— not an Omega hero. And that’s a big ‘if’ on the hero part.” Howard rises up in the ghost of a memory of how disappointed he was in Tony’s being an Omega. And Tony doesn’t hate his designation because of his father, but because of what the designation is. Natasha doesn’t know, or understand.
Minutes tick by as Steve locks into the machine, his mind seeking out Tony’s in order to sync with it, to take on some of the burden that the machine places on drifters and balance it between them.
“This is my job, Steve! It’s what I do. I invent and I bring new products to the market. You’re interfering with the cash cow. You know who fucking hates that? The board of SI. You’re going to get me ousted. I can fucking see it now. Captain America manages to take down an American icon by being an absolute dickwad.”
“I wanted to say I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Clint, I never should have implied you were less than at your job because you are an omega. You’re a great operative, and I’m glad to have you at my back. I had prejudices against omegas, and I realize that now. Is there anything I can do to make it right?”
“Where is he? I want to see him now.” Steve acquiesces and turns to take Rhodes to their room. Showing his back to the other man is a calculated risk, but Steve thinks that Tony’s friend knows the stakes. He wouldn’t dare attempt to kill Steve if it could kill Tony.
Maybe he’d just tell Pepper that all his chickens were coming home to roost and he was ready for death. After which, she would murder him, and then murder him again, before marching him straight back here.
Before he was a pilot for the jaeger program, he was an engineer. This is laughably easy to break into and break down.
If anything, Tony’s open affection, the fact that he believes in Steve, is proof positive that Tony loves him. And Steve knows he loves Tony. There’s no falsehood here.
He doesn’t self-castigate for not being able to focus; afterall, he’s got less than ten minutes probably before one or both of them show up. Tony tells himself that he’s got it under control, but if that were true, he wouldn’t be sitting here now. At this point though, he can’t extricate himself from events. From them.
“Pep, stop, please.” Her eyes widened and narrowed, and she heaved out a breath before stalking over to Tony. Tentatively she reaches out, her hand open and waiting for Tony to grab a hold. His Omega does, and Steve feels something sharp twist in his chest. There’s something here he wants, but he has everything he needs, doesn’t he?
“Fuck you.” Tony says as he tries to push back up against Steve again, only managing to wedge his hips into the curve of Steve’s sharply defined groin. The burgeoning hardness that rests between his ass cheeks makes his efforts feel futile, and if that didn’t make him slick up even more.
“Whatever you want, dearest.” Steve turns towards Tony and runs a hand through the other man’s soft black hair. Tony eyes him with a secretive grin, like he knows something Steve doesn’t. Which, Tony probably thinks that no one else knows how filthy Captain America can be, how depraved, and he would be right.
He’s not going to stand for this though. Which is why he takes a cocky stand, tilts his chin up, hips uneven with as much smarm as he can muster while he feels like absolute garbage.
“But JARVIS can release the aerosol through the vents and contain it to one floor, right?” Bruce asks, gentle.
They swarm as one, their limbs moving irrespective of the others around them. It helps, as some of them trip, fall, and are trampled underneath the oncoming horde.
When the pizzas come, Steve makes a plate and heads down to the workshop. The doors open for him automatically and once again he is lost in the beauty of Tony’s workshop. This time Tony is hammering away at something, his lean arms beaded with sweat. Steve never realized how strong Tony was before.
It dissipates as if it were never there. As if it was always there and Tony grasping it is like falling, sliding down, down into a vat of
“I was awake. I heard you shouting.” Tony doesn’t make eye contact as he confesses, and Steve feels a smidgen of something warm in his gut that Tony came to check on him. Even after all the problems they’d been going through, problems caused by Tony, Tony still a good omega underneath all of the problems.
“Finally! We have twenty to get you presentable.” Pepper bounces off the bed, carrying a suit. Tony shrugs out of the robe and opens his arms wide as if to hug Pepper.
“How do I make this easy for you?” He pulls Tony’s arms off his shoulders and wraps their hands together, offering Tony a point of balance to rise up on his knees. The tip of Steve’s cock brushes against Tony’s sack, soft and pliant, before Tony settles over Steve’s cock like he’s on a saddle. Steve lets his cock bend, nestling between the crevice of Tony’s legs, slick and the promise of heat teasing at his cockhead. Tony rubs experimentally a few times, before reaching his hand back and gripping Steve, making Steve gasp. The contact is like a small explosion going off in his body, and he drinks in the experience like wine, a starving man at a banquet of sensation.
He was methodically pursuing an Alpha for heat. Not dating, or asking around, or even soliciting a friend. And if that wasn’t the bee in his iron bonnet, because after this heat, there’d be another heat. The type of inflammation Tony had due to avoiding his heats wouldn’t be cured with a single heat. He needed some therapeutic fucking. Presumably his next heat would be with this same Alpha if he couldn’t find a second one to avoid the first Alpha thinking he had a claim to anything.
“Yeah, yeah, make sure the haul gets distributed.” Nat nods and strides out with purpose now, packing up all the emotion she had just let out when Tony’s fate was uncertain.
“I need decaf.” Tony’s composure breaks at this, and he looks apoplectic for a second before it smooths over into his usual smug expression.
Tony kneels on the bed, nude and impatient, snicking the bottle of lube open and quickly jabbing two fingers into the tight noose of his hole. He scissors himself roughly, not bothering to take any extra time as the Andorian doesn’t seem to want to either. The man walks over with his dick in hand and puts a knee on the bed behind Tony before clambering up the rest of the way.
“But what if I hurt him?” Steve is no longer sure anymore what would make Tony feel pain. Tony is like spun glass, rigid but breakable. Fragile but strong. A contradiction.
“I think—I was an omega. I was so broken, physically. I needed medical treatments all the time. Treatments my mother could barely afford. And I was a burden on everyone. My mom, Bucky. I couldn’t even have proper heats, I was so useless. No one would ever want me. I didn’t want myself. If you’re asking who the weakest omega I knew was, it was me.” He looks at Iron Man desperately. Needing some kind of confirmation that the man inside the suit understands him. Knows exactly what Steve is talking about.
“In every respect but one, yes.” Steve almost reconsiders his strict limit. Tony’s heat will be bad without an alpha, but omegas can go through heats alone. He knows that for a fact.
Also, he really did love an Omega in power, including himself. She was the someone he could see being with, weathering this crazy world together. Pride was a funny thing, however, and he wasn’t about to burden her with his awkward feelies. Not while she had a company to help run.
“Pep, please—” That— that was not what he expected at all from her, and it seizes his body in paralytic fear and self-loathing.
“You will listen. You will not interrupt. This is already a waste of time. You’re a lost cause, Rogers. Fury seems to think there’s something redeemable here. I disagree, but he wants me to try.” That seems… harsh. He’s made some mistakes, it's true, but he only had the best intentions for Tony. He only wants the omega to be a little less flippant and irresponsible and just conform to what omegas
“I’m sorry, but Nat, that book sounds like it knew what it was talking about. Tony is–” Nat slams her hands on the desk, her eyes flashing with fire for the briefest of moments before the cold settles in once more.
Heat covers him like a veil now, making him languid and easy. Slick leaks out, and Steve’s breath stutters as he scents it before the Alpha goes back to mouthing Tony’s neck like he can’t get enough contact. Tony is filthy wet there with Steve’s saliva, and it feels so right, he begins to cant his hips up, trying to push Steve’s hard cock into the crevice where the warmth from his hole radiates against Steve.
“I know, I know he’s more than deserving of a better husband. I know I’ve been cruel, wretched to him. And I regret it, every day. But I just don’t know why I feel the way I do. Please, if you have any insight at all, I need him—I don’t think I can do this, live in this world, without being able to be by his side. When I woke up, the only thing I had was this contract, and I didn’t even want it. I thought he was vain, flighty, insipid. But he’s none of those things. He’s strong, clever, indomitable of spirit. He’s fought against everything I’ve tried to do to him and never given in. Not really.” Iron Man pulls his hands up to his face, a very human gesture. He hears the metal click as his fingers slide down the sides.
“I’ve had my fair share of good luck in this life. Maybe I’ve run out. I don’t know. I deserve to have it run out. I don’t
As they walk towards the building, Steve wonders what he’s going to see today. He doesn’t know if he can bear the scrutiny of the omegas. It’s like they’ll be able to see that he’s hit Tony. They’ll somehow know.
Tony hates him, and yet here is Steve thinking about what it would be like if Tony were shivering next to him, needing him. He is exceptionally beautiful, if Steve is cataloging that sort of thing. Nothing Tony has worn has diminished his lean lines, trim muscle, and a narrow waist with a pert bottom. He could encompass Tony’s hips with his large hands, meet his thumbs in the center of Tony’s back even as his fingers dig into the sides of Tony’s waist.
“I’m really not sure you want to do that, Steve.” Tony knew he must have a twisted up expression on his face because Steve’s eyebrows furrow in just that way and his jaw gets a little more rigid. Determined, stalwart. All indelible qualities of Captain America.
Forever. That’s how long he’s going to remember this. His eidetic memory is a cinema in which he can replay this indefinitely. And he will.
“Good.” Steve kneads at Tony’s ass, gripping the pliant flesh in his palms, wondering what Tony might need next that he can provide.
Captain America’s face is tight with disdain. He’s taken his cowl off, the heat from their respective bodies clogging the air. Tony has set his suit to recycle what air he has, but it’s not working any better to keep him cool. The exhaust from the suit isn’t helping matters either.
A neck grip is an intimate and instant relaxer for Omegas, and Tony briefly remembers that it used to be socially acceptable to ‘take down’ an angsty Omega for their own good. But it’s very much not ok in these times.
If he had regrets, they were unspoken rants at treacherous mother nature for having designed the plumbing in the first place.
“I’m going to the gym. I need you to know I’m not staying here full time. I have an apartment in Brooklyn. We’ll talk later.” Tony sees Steve deflate, all of the anger subsiding into something sadder and frustrated. It makes him want to soothe Steve, but then he remembers he doesn’t care at all. Steve is bringing all this upon himself. They’re fine. Both of them are fine just being teammates and not needing to get along outside the battlefield. This is as good as it gets and as good as it ever has to be. Steve doesn’t have to live here either. Not if he doesn’t want to. Yeah, it’s good.
It’s better to say that he’s Steve’s. His only, his one person. His sense of belonging in a life that has never worn right on him until Steve tailored it. Steve trimmed his bad sleep schedule, took shears to his ugly drinking habits, darned every difficult task until Tony either found them easy to do or they went fully to Steve.
“You can go back to your room now. Sleep in the blankets and pillows you have so I have something for my nest tomorrow.” Tony isn’t looking at him, his eyes unfocused, pointed at the direction of some pillows.
Tony is agreeable, his teasing a choreographed dance meant to entice Steve into the chase. It doesn’t grate, or make him feel inadequate. The sly smile that lives perpetually in the corner of Tony’s dusky pink mouth is an invitation, not a challenge.
As he does so, a few of the creatures get a good bite in, piercing his bicep and the back of his neck. It stings, and he thinks about how filthy the wound would be with their mouths being full of other people’s blood. In any case, he’s not going to get the chance to die of infection.
Steve hasn’t even so much as glimpsed Tony in a couple of days. The attempts at bringing lunch to the workshop are rebuffed by JARVIS.
“Clint accidentally drank the expired kreyla juice the other day. He didn’t quite make it to the toilet before vomiting up the purplest upchuck I’ve ever seen. Kreyla juice is blue, so it was unexpected.”
It’s at this point he realizes he doesn’t have a rosary. But from his memories, he can still pray it. He starts with the Apostles’ Creed and works his way down from the cross.
Steve doesn’t, can’t want Tony. He’s never wanted Tony. Even if the burn inside his body says otherwise.
Instead, Tony gasps brokenly, heat rolling up his cock, into his body and down his spine where it explodes in his head. His back bows, bearing down on Steve’s fingers that he’s shoved in, which are squelching into Tony at a rapid clip.
Now is the time. He’s taut as a bow-string, incapable of thinking of anything else other than Tony, Tony, Tony.
The nest is warm, and while it’s not very clean, the fabric is still soft and pliable. He lays there for a while, thinking about Tony and how an omega’s heat is not the terrible thing he thought it was. He’d been under the impression that it was a burden for an alpha and an omega to endure. But this has been anything but. It’s the most intimate thing he’s ever experienced in his life, something he feels like he was born to do.
Avengers movie time! This is about half of the movie's worth of stuff. I wrote this stuff when I didn't know much about narrative arcs and things, so forgive me. Lol.
“Ok, buddy. Um, I’m very sorry I’m in your space, but you are standing between me and the other people. I’m not tasty. I assure you. I’m the stringiest of meats and I subsist on a diet of alcohol and cheap pizza.”
“Fine. But don’t expect me to remain silent when the council asks for weapons, assuming you have him on a leash.”
“I don’t know, it just seemed like the right thing to do. Come with me?” Steve held out a hand and Tony took it, dizzy with the possible consequences.
Down it is, and he jumps several stairs and even full staircases as he leaps. As he goes along, he feels a hum inside his body, the thrill of excitement and the chase emanating like wildfire from his pores.
When he gets down, he sits at one of the tables there and watches the ebb and flow of traffic. He pulls out his phone to fiddle with, as he has nothing else. He’s nervous, uncertain what Natasha will say or do. Really, this is the first time they’ll be able to have a conversation about everything that’s happened thus far.
“The normal way. Next time, wait.” The Captain eyes him up, his lips curled into a slight frown that makes Tony want to
“Come to tell me to stop projecting my wild beliefs on everyone?” Tony turns around and looks at his best friend. Really looks at him.
He despises this place, he thinks, smacking his arm to stop an errant mosquito. There are bugs out here, and everything smells like pine and loam.
Tony is whining now, head thrown back on his pillows, his hips doing little circles while Steve holds him steady, his fingers sliding, hooking Tony open. Steve moves his other hand and traces his fingers over the flushed pink skin of Tony’s cock, and smiles to himself. He reaches up, makes his grip firm, encircles Tony’s cock, and strokes him, up and down, twisting his palm firmly over the head. Tony’s cock is slick with Steve’s spit. He wants to make it slicker, and then he’s sliding it straight into his mouth, tasting salty precum at the tip.
Inside looks like the plushest place that Steve has ever seen. There are example nests built everywhere, on top of platforms, and on the ground. There’s nest ‘bundles’ where you can buy everything at one price. Some of the nests are ostentatious, while others look homey. Steve is overwhelmed with choices, and he stands there, slack-jawed.
“What’s the issue with him ordering in if it’s hurting no one? He has the money, he doesn’t have the time to cook, and he’s not good at it.”
“Worth it? I barely have it at all when it comes to you.” With that, he decides to go all in on displaying his interest. Tony isn’t ready yet, and Steve will hold him off from trying to make good on any promises until the transition is over, but this is good groundwork. He won’t waste his opportunity. It’s only three more weeks. This is like throwing himself over a cliff. He’s done it so many times, but each time he feels the rush of the ground coming towards him. Sometimes Iron Man catches him. He hopes it’s true this time.
“Yeah, yeah it is.” Bucky finally admits after a long silence. Hope blossoms inside, and the elation that fills his being brings along images of Tony. Tony swaddled warm in Steve’s bed, Tony’s fingers tracing Steve’s abs, Tony’s hot little mouth yielding under Steve’s. Yes, Tony was meant to be an Omega, with his doe-brown eyes and Ganymede hips.
Keeping track of other battles is also part of what he considers his job. He’s there for aerial support. For rescue. He watches Thor take out whale after whale. The Hulk crushes through buildings, launching himself at every target he sees. Loki gets blown out of the sky, and Tony is not sure where he lands until he sees Bruce jump in after him.
“I—I can’t do this!” Tony tears off, scrambling down the hallway to the stairwell. There’s a snarl from Bucky before he hears a body hit the wall, and he knows they’re fighting.
“Yeah? You need this?” Steve is pawing at his burgeoning erection. Tony can see it outlined in shadow, the heavy weight of his balls, the burgeoning knot at the base attached to the longest and thickest cock he’s ever seen. Of course his alpha should be well equipped. Steve was the best alpha, and he was picking Tony. Undeserving, lonely Tony who had always wanted Steve to notice, to
“I got this,” the one beta says, standing up and holding out their hand. Steve takes it. “Hi, I’m Aisling, and I work with the Omega Support Network here at the New York branch. We’ve been scanning the old records in and using technology to make them searchable. I assume you have someone you know that you’d like to look up?” He shuffles from foot to foot, eyeing the omegas back, unsure.
“Why was Tony out of the suit?” He was trying not to be angry, but he couldn’t think of a single reason that Tony should have been unprotected.
“Heats cloud my better judgment. Things I might say would be asking you to breed me. I don’t actually want your babies, just so we’re clear. But in my heat, I might ask for it.”
Tony takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, the lashes on his face a smudge of brown that looks good on his olive skin. While Tony is not the model omega in behavior, he has the feline grace of an omega, unmistakable for anything else.
“I do. I don’t know where my thoughts are lately. All I want is for Tony to be… a good omega. To be happy being that. But I don’t even know what a good omega
Steve keeps coming inside Tony for what must be minutes. It goes on and on, scooping his insides out and pouring them into Tony. It’s a sensation he knew could happen, was possible, but the experience is heart-stopping, mind-altering. His body feels like it’s expanding to fit the whole universe and his world is exploding outward and inward at the same time. If there are seams to his person, they’re coming undone and Steve is falling to pieces inside Tony.
“Do I? Spontaneous designation changes are rare, but they do happen. I looked it up.” He turns back to Bucky who is idly picking at his burger bun, tossing little bread pieces onto the plate.
Cleaning the kitchen should be a good distraction from his thoughts, but instead he’s hyper fixated on everything that led up to the heat and what happened after. Not to mention what went on during. He’s been inside Tony. In a way no other alpha had been. Tony was his, for all of a couple days. Tony’s body belonged underneath him, around him. He remembers every whimper, every scream. He remembers holding Tony while he trembled and squeezed tight and broke while Steve was inside him. He remembers gathering the pieces in his arms, Tony’s long, sweat-slick limbs akimbo and lean torso slippery with fluids. He doesn’t know how Tony managed to keep his shirt on, but he did, only managing to have it ride up to his chest before Tony would instinctively pull it down.
Steve doesn’t need any more than that. He comes once again, knot swelling up. It pumps out cum like it’s been promised that it’ll surely impregnate Tony. Again and again, he spurts, and when Steve thinks it might be over, another stream oozes its way out of his fattened cock.
Tony’s jaw works frantically, his shoulders hunched around his head and pressed into the blankets. His eyes start to glaze with tears, and Steve sighs, resigned.
“Come on, punk, let’s talk over it in my room.” Bucky adjusts his hand so it lays on Steve’s shoulder, pulling him closer. Tilting his head as Steve pauses, Bucky squeezes just the barest amount, reminding Steve to speak up.
It’s not even a question in Tony’s mind as to whether Rogers will show up or not. He will. There’s something tense and unspoken between them now that a man like Rogers won’t let alone. No. He’ll be back.
Tony pulls off first, groaning, and kisses Steve’s palm that was holding his cheek. He lets go, dropping Steve’s hand, and in a movement that’s almost shy, turns around, revealing his perky ass for Steve’s purview as he struts over to the nest.
Tony is left alone in the room. There’s trash everywhere, sheets and pillows ripped and empty water bottles loitering by the bedside on the table and floor.
Tony. He’s certain of it now. There isn’t a way back for him anymore to be as alone as he was. There is only forward, and Tony being that future. He’s so selfish, he knows. But life isn’t as meaningful without someone to share it with. And it’s become Tony for him. He was so wrong about omegas, about Tony.
Steve kisses his Omega now, leaning over Tony’s body with his long torso and turning his head to snatch up Tony’s lips into his own, and the sheer jubilation he experiences can’t be quantified. Tony whines into it, bucking up against Steve more, and his mouth opens in invitation.
“It’s powered by arc reactors.” Bruce pipes up from behind the terminal while Tony crosses his arms and stares down the Captain, daring him to comment.
The time he had spent with Tony in the nest had driven him desperately to his room, and once the door slammed he had torn off his pants and fisted himself to completion within seconds.
“Whatever you say Tones.” Bruce finished filling up his mug, taking a long sip while eyeing up the feathery goods on Tony’s back as if they’re entertainment, and at any moment they might break out into song and dance. Which was not far from the truth, when it came to certain people.
His pistoning hips then begin to stutter, the first sign of his impending knot. Steve keeps his pace punishing, plunging into Tony’s needy ass in an attempt to drive anything and everything from Tony’s mind but
“Well?” Tony is standing there, armor bent and scraped, almost apart at the seams, Friday warning him that his systems are going to go offline, that he won’t be able to make it out of Siberia on his own. He could die here. Would die here, with Barnes and Steve all wrapped up in a frozen tomb where he never has to confront the fact that the best man he knew justifies his decisions on selfish aims.
“You know, I had this thing put into my head. This dream. And it seems normal at the time, it seems right. I was an Avenger. That I was more than what they made me. That—” she pauses, “I want you to understand, the red room only takes Omegas as trainees. It’s their long held secret.”
Tony and Steve have fucked on most of the available surfaces. Steve doesn’t know if anyone else knows about them besides Natasha, but no one has said a word. Tony has told him that being homosexual is safer now, if not completely safe. Besides, there’s not really anyone to judge anymore. It’s one of the things Steve likes in 2011, though his favorite is undoubtedly Tony.
There’s silence from the ceiling, and it’s such a human thing that Steve wonders if JARVIS learned it or Tony programmed it. A computer doesn’t need any time at all to think, he’s learned.
But like a magnet, he can’t stay away from the Cap as he sees the man single handedly taking on an entire squadron of Chitauri on his own. He blasts through several of the screeching humanoids before lining up his repulsors to Cap’s shield. Automatically bracing himself, Cap takes Tony’s bursts of energy like a champ, using them to eradicate the next wave of combatants.
“That’s how it’s going to be then?” Steve smiles, and it’s like the sun rising, his blond lashes catching the light as his eyes crinkle in amusement. Now, Tony knows for certain that the Captain had never found him that funny before. No, Tony was totally annoying. That was the way the world worked.
Tony hadn’t known. Hadn’t realized. There was a level of knowledge, of the universe itself, that he’d been running from. Tony Stark was a coward; Captain America was right. Because this was bliss—completion. He knew now, and he could never unknow. No matter that serum that would make him forget, his sinew would twist and turn with this truth forever.
“The standard issue guns don’t make a dent. They’re getting thicker rounds, but they figured we would be better for containment.” Widow sounds strained as she replies.
“Ask nicely or I’ll do this my way,” Steve says. Tony laughs throatily, his shoulders trembling with even more suppressed giggles. He stops and levels Steve a lascivious smile.
The air tenses between them, stretching out between them as they both wait for the other to attack first—and then Bucky does, coming in hot with a human fist toward Tony’s side. Tony dodges, slinking around with feline grace as he shoots forward, aiming to intrude upon Bucky’s personal space, past his impenetrable defenses. But Bucky, much like Steve, is so much faster than Tony ever will be; he whips back, out of reach, and reveals the letter from Steve tucked into the back of his belt. Tony tries to drag his eyes away from it, tries to employ the training Natasha has given him, because the last thing he wants Bucky to know is that Tony has seen it.
, his hindbrain operating on instinct alone even as his conscious self reminds him that running is the worst idea. Bucky will catch him and he knows what happens after that. There’s not a single alpha who wouldn’t claim what’s theirs after a chase.
Unlike the first gender, which was coded in the individual’s body, the changes for being omega or alpha were circumstantial based on the parent’s contribution; scientists didn’t always understand what made for the change, but that it had something to do with stress. Every alpha contained the equipment to be an omega and vice versa, but it acted recessively based on whatever hormones were in the parent’s body at the time. Thus, Steve knew for certain that he’d just been placed in a stressful environment and that his temperament was more suited to being alpha.
“Mine?” The choked out word is disbelieving, and Steve sees all of the tension and anxiety stifled in Tony’s body manifest itself into unshed tears.
? To make them change me back to my old self?” The accusatory tone is a balm to Steve. He loves Tony off-balanced, unsure. Entirely his to push around.
Loki couldn’t possibly have gotten this army on his own. There are greater powers behind it. Something the earth has never seen. What is the Tesseract that it generates such power to break the fabric of space? For once, Tony kind of doesn’t want to know.
“I don’t like what you’re insinuating. There are some things you can’t manufacture, Mr. Stark. You’ve got to earn them. If you want to change anything about the world, save the Coulsons in it yourself, you’ve got to try a lot harder than that. At least I was there during the fight.”
I’ve got you, baby.” Tony chokes on his words as Steve uses his alpha voice and starts to rub him. It’s so similar to what he experienced with Bucky that his mind feels like it’s being turned inside out, and he’s living in a mirror world. At least, it’s like that until Steve drops to his knees.
“I agree, but I’m not going to fight Fury over it. We need to focus on the task at hand. Where’s Iron Man?” Tony blows air out of his nose, frustrated that Cap is correct on all counts. The man who came out of the ice is different from the man who lived in the world’s history, than Howard’s Captain America.
She takes him to the cafeteria, which isn’t serving food, or shouldn’t be, but seems to have a small buffet laid out on the table that’s surrounded by their friends. Jennifer and Bruce, Thor and Loki, Wade and Peter, Clint and Natasha, Rhodey and Carol. They all look at him without pity, or remorse. It was the Spiderpool suit that rescued them the other night, finally tearing
“Hi there! Welcome to Nest! Can I get some sample swatches started for you today?” Steve looks agog at the woman who stops in front of them. She’s omega, and she smells bonded.
Gently, Steve presses at his entrance before breaching the tense muscle there, his head popping into the slick-soaked channel. Tony can feel his body rearranging itself inside as Steve presses in. Before he knows it, his alpha has his balls rested on Tony’s crack, the rough hair on his mons rubbing Tony’s still-hard cock.
“I called him around the same time as you. He should be—” Widow’s pig goes down in a blaze of white light, and Steve hears the hum of the thrusters above his head. Really, they should have just sent Iron Man to take care of this, rather than have the whole team here.
“They’re so—they’re so beautiful Tony. I know you can’t keep them, but you look—you look good with them.” If Steve only knew what selfish little miscreants his wings have been, he wouldn’t be saying that.
He wants to be so good for Steve, and he wishes that he was enough. But this is a game that Steve and Bucky seem to be playing with him. They accost him, get him to orgasm, and then they leave.
Steve’s hands wander, keeping a firm grip on the upper bones of his wings as he slid them down to the humorous and back up to his ulna and radius. When Steve got the grip he wanted, he starts relentlessly pounding in and out of Tony.
“I’ll sit down and wait.” Cap says. Tony walks over to his bar and snatches a bottle, which is sadly empty, before finding another and pouring himself a glass of… well, he thinks it’s whiskey.
Steve is already arranging a routine for Tony in his head, examining where he’s going to have to interfere with Tony’s life to get the omega man on track. Lifestyle is a special problem. Steve needs to see that Tony is behaving himself in a professional manner by being the best example of an omega example that he can be. He’ll have to cut down on Tony’s spending and maybe even cull clothing that’s not appropriate. Alphas did this all the time for their omegas in his time. Surely it’s not fallen too out of style.
“No, please.” Spittle slides over Tony’s lips, like he can barely control them. It reminds Steve of his promise.
The suit flies lazily through the air, destination already in mind it seems, as Tony lets it pilot where they’re going. Up ahead, familiar buildings pass by as Tony remembers the damage they sustained from Loki and the Chitauri. It’s all erased now, made new, just like the insults that Tony and Steve had lobbed at each other initially are now paved over with kindness and true compassion for one another. The suit floats down then, amongst all the new development, where the most damage had been, and Tony sees in the distance the Avengers assembled on the ground, waiting.
It’s over before Steve can blink, Tony pushing the last of the french fries in his mouth, takeout box empty.
“No time for Tonys in this world, Steve,” he chokes out a laugh. Because there really isn’t room for Tony in Tony’s life. He doesn’t have Pepper anymore, and that’s for the best because she couldn’t stand his other job, Iron Man. And the world needs Iron Man, just as SI needs Tony Stark, the mask in front of the man.
Tony tosses his head back and whips his head to the side. It’s so much sensation. His body is fire, melting into the mattress and being turned inside out. Steve is remaking him, molding every crevice of his body into something that’s solely for him. When Tony opens his eyes, his cheek pressed firm to the bed, he sees Bucky there, watching with a hunger that should frighten him. He sucks in a breath, thrilled and terrified all at once, watching on a cliff’s edge for Steve and his orgasm.
“I’m ready for this Bucky. We’re doing the right thing.” Bucky stills for a moment before reaching into his pocket and pulling out an orange bottle with a white cap, label dirty from being rubbed, and tossed around in pockets.
There’s a bit of hope inside him, that Tony will see him as a viable mate after all is said and done. He doesn’t know what his life will look like after, otherwise. Can he spend every day looking at Tony and not being able to have him? He would have to.
“Are you, Stark?” Well, shit. It’s possible that Barton knew he was Iron Man, and told Loki. Or there’s some other manner that the god is able to tell what is under the armor. He’s going to have to deal, however. And if he’s going to suffer through this, he’ll do it with some libations.
“So it’s like that?” Steve’s face was opaque and doesn’t that just make Tony’s raging paranoia go haywire. He’s done it now, ruined everything.
“Say yes first. Obey me just this once Tony. Just this time.” Tony swallowed: his pride, his rising desire for this. For Steve.
“Um, you’re fired.” He mumbled. She stunk of alpha, which was unfathomably rude. Scent blockers existed, he wore them all the time, but the market only provided beta scents. Initially Alpha and Omega scents had been on the market, but a few instances where a beta had posed as an omega and somehow, someway, likely through religious means, managed to hoodwink Alphas into a legally binding contract, aka marriage, had changed that. The collective consensus of Alphas had been to do everything possible to ban Alpha and Omega scents from staying on the market. Not when Alpha autonomy and superiority would be at risk. Imagine a beta climbing the ranks that wore an Alpha scent. The horror.
“Hey, if I do anything, it’s so we can have a better world the second time ‘round.” And Steve understands the look in Tony’s eyes. Aspirations for a remade world. There’ll always be corruption, but there’s something illuminating in helping save so many people, that they think future governments will be built on top of the selflessness of humanity instead of its blind ambition.
“Belay that, you may deliver the bedding personally.” Steve perks up despite himself. Tony changed his mind.
“Let’s go somewhere private,” Natasha says. He follows them to an empty conference room and settles into a chair. Both of them are wearing SHIELD issued relaxing clothes, though Hawkeye clearly has something against sleeves, and has ripped his off the t-shirt.
“That massage you gave was grade A, Captain.” He still feels Steve’s phantom fingers, but in his mind they go lower, spreading him open, gently tapping his hole for entrance, roughly tugging at the head of his cock. It’s a fantasy borne of his desperate, pathetic need for Steve, one that he’s nursed for so long.
But now that his Alpha and the rest of Steve were in agreement about the mouthy Omega, there was no reason to delay any plans to make his desires a reality.
“No. Not at all. I’m here to see what mistakes we’re going to make when we’re working together. I’ve missed you all wrong Tony.” Steve grabs an empty glass on the table and pours himself some of what Tony’s been having. Tony is sputtering, his hand clenching and unclenching his glass.
“There isn’t. Ok? I have to live this way. This is my life and if it’s going to be like this, I get the choice to not let it hang over my head.” Tony’s brow furrows, and he’s willing his words at Rhodes with a desperation that Steve doesn’t understand. He knows that even though Tony will come to accept and like his new circumstances, today it seems impossible. Yet here Tony is, asking Rhodes to accept that Tony is resigned to this. Steve doesn’t believe Tony, doesn’t think the other man has given up so easily. It’s another facet of this game he’s embarking on with his mate.
