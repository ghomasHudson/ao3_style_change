"Yes." Lilith said and activated some of her powers against Sam. A bright light appeared and Bucky had to close his eyes. Then suddenly it stopped and Lilith looked shocked at Sam.
"Oh yeah? Because of all that demon blood you drank? It is Lucifer! We don't know how strong he is!"
"You don't know that." Dean said in a bitter tone and just sat down at the table. Sam sighed and made himself comfortable on the bed, trying to sleep while Dean stared out the window. They never really were in the city with their father. Always on the road, in old hotel rooms in the middle of nowhere. Now he could see almost all of New York and he realized how many people there lived and how almost no one had an idea of what's out there. All the monsters and creatures. Dean thought about his mother and the yellow eyed demon that killed her. He thought about his father and how he always saw him as a hero. Not the Avengers. They had no idea what John had done to keep his sons safe, what he had done to keep his brother safe.
"You are staying at a hotel? Why? And please tell me you two have a decent hotel room." Tony said to Dean, but he shook his head.
Turned out that truly half of all living beings were missing. The Avengers that were still there tried to help as many people as they could. Natasha and Steve did most of it, working together with the last people of the government and the police to keep some kind of order around.
"Oh, I knew you'd show up... Because I knew Sam wouldn't listen." Dean said and looked at his brother. "But you are not gonna teach him anything. You understand me? Over my dead body."
"Charles was a good worker, but I always said that we should just turn everyone from the company. That way we don't have to do it in secrecy. It would be much easier if everyone here was involved." Another man said.
Suddenly they heard a knock on the door and everyone looked confused at it. Sam who was the closest to the door walked over and opened it.
"I am sorry to hear that." Steve said and all the Avengers looked sad and Dean hated that they pitied them.
They realized that John was as far as them on the case and they wanted to go and see if the husband was still alive to question him.
"What the hell's taking Bobby?" Dean asked and right then the sprinkler system with holy water went on and the demons screamed. Sam managed to open the door and Sam, Dean, Bucky and Ruby went inside.
"We are at Bobby's place. Family friend. He takes care of us, so it's alright. Sorry for this, I just had to tell someone and you guys deserve to know."
"It's alright, Dean. Please, wake up." Mary soothed him, as she knelt down next to John in front of the bed.
Dean slowly calmed down and suddenly he opened his eyes. He was covered in sweat and panted slightly he looked at John and Mary and tried to get away, before realising where he was and who they were.
But after walking around a bit more, he suddenly saw a very old book. It was dusted and the pages almost fell out of it. The cover said 'Men of letters: The Supernatural'. Dean opened it and was amazed by what he saw. There were information about all the monsters that they hunt… even more. There were old drawings of demons and angels, of gods and fairy tales. He saw weapons and weird sigils that he had never seen before.
"He wanted us to do a job. He is a step ahead of us and we are not sure what exactly he wants... but we'll get there."
"Wow... Someone lived under a rock. Thanos, some pruple, evil alien dusted away half of all living beings. That happened five years ago." Dean quickly explained.
Dean nodded. "Like we said, heaven and hell existed in my universe. At some point in our lives, you- Sammy... he died."
Sam explained everything that had happened and after that the Avengers told them more about their recent adventures. Then everyone went to bed, Sam to his old room and Dean to a guest room.
"I told you to wait.... Oh fuck..." In the room were tons of dead people. They were attached to different machines and laid on lab tables. The bodies were cut open and sometimes limbs were missing.
Castiel couldn't say anything. He, John and Sam all just looked at the figures in front of them, not sure if all this was actually happening right now.
"Sir, a black 67 Chevrolet Impala is currently trying to get into the garage. Should I let them in?"
The girl hesitated. "It's kind of this local legend. This one girl, she got murdered out on Centennial, like, decades ago.Well supposedly she's still out there. She hitchhikes. And whoever picks her up...well, they disappear forever."
"Oh Tony would only spend his money on something stupid and or useless things, so this actually helps." Pepper said and handed Bucky the third shopping bag.
"Dean, this is earth. There is no heaven or hell. No God." Sam said and looked at his brother confused.
Dean then looked at Sam and gestured him to follow him. They walked into their room, while Bucky grabbed some guns with silver bullets, as well as some knives made out of silver. Upstairs, Dean took out his bag from under the bed and took out a small handgun and a knife and held them out for Sam to take.
"Same." Benny said and then he looked at Dean. "If you ever need help or something, just call me. Dean was like a brother and a hero to me, so... it would be my honor to help you out."
"You cannot buy weapons when you are under 18. His dad probably gave it to him. Now back to what you said before…vampires?"
"Well Lucifer is back in his cage, so everything should be back to normal right?" Sam asked Castiel.
"Uhm, demon? Manipulative's kind of in the job description." Ruby said. "Fact is, is that you never would have considered it. Not until you were-"
"It was that damn demon who attacked Sammy, killed mom and set the house on fire. I only blame him."
Dean saw that there were a lot more people in the room and he realized that it truly were the Avengers. He saw them more than once on the news. Dean glanced over to his brother and Sam had sparkles in his eyes. He looked super excited and Dean guessed that this was like a dream come true to him.
"They- they sliced and... carved and tored me in ways that you-. Until there was nothing left. And then suddenly I would be whole again... like magic. Just so they could start it all over. And a demon, Alastair at the end of every day... everyone, he would come over and he would make me an offer to take me off the rack if I put souls on. If I started the torture. And everyday I told him to stick it where the sun shines. For 30 years I told... But then I couldn't do it anymore Bucky." Deans voice cracked and tears started to form in his eyes. "I couldn't... And I got off that wreck. God help me I got right off it and I started ripping them appart... I lost count of how many souls." Dean held back his tears, but Bucky saw how hard that was for him. "The th-... things I did to them...-"
"My eh- brother is a medic. He'll take care of him. Don't worry. Focus on the kids." Castiel told them. The medics still looked sceptical, but then left.
That was when Dean decided to interrupt. "You fellas had another one like this just last month, didn't you?"
Bucky, Sam and Dean sneaked around and killed all the demons, while Bobby prepared a trap for the rest, in case more came to try and stop them.
Dean looked around. There was no sign of John.Travis came out of his house and nodded at the Impala. "A beauty isn't she?"
"You mentioned that you stayed at a lot of old hotels and that you didn't really have a job, because of the hunting... How was that? It couldn't have been easy." Sam asked curiously.
"Sam, don't" Dean interrupted Sam. "Come on man, what are you, blind? Can't you see this is a trick?"
And suddenly Lucifer stood in front of them, on the painted sigil that weakened him. Sam and Dean quickly set the holy oil on fire and Lucifer was trapped.
Bucky looked at him and then suddenly the wall behind them moved and a secret staircase was revealed.
Now they all sat on a bench near a park in the town. Castiel told Dean about his day, while Jack played with Miracle.
"The general public did not know about the supernatural. It's more of a small family business. If the parents knew, then often their children would become hunters as well. The life of a hunter was never easy. No payment, no recognition. We did it to save others and so that they didn't have to fight. Our mother's family were hunters and our father only found out when mom was killed by the demon and became a hunter after that. The Bobby and Ellen from my world were also hunters."
"Just shut up." Crowley said. "You are just like our Dean was. Always having self worth issues." Crowley rolled his eyes and Dean looked confused.
"Sam is a decent young man. Don't ruin him," Natasha said from the other side of the room and Clint nodded.
"Don't worry bro. Once we reach the tower, we'll keep Tony away from you and you two can have the top floor of the tower all for yourselves." Dean grinned and they followed Tony and Jessica into the Quinjet that was currently parked half on the street. Jessica turned around to Sam confused and Sam could only smile at her, trying to reassure her that everything is alright.
"Good morning." Sam smiled, as he saw John and Dean. "I thought you guys were still sleeping, but I guess we all are a bit restless now."
Dean stopped in front of it and Jack got out of the car and went up to the front door. Dean got out as well and followed Jack into the house.
They said their goodbyes and after that Dean, Sam and Buck went to the Impala and Sam took out one of Tony's phones and looked online. They found information about a suicide on Centennial over 20 years ago. Apparently she had two kids who died right before she committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
"Yes?" Bucky asked as he picked up Tony's phone. Tony was currently working on a new metal arm for Bucky and Bucky tried to help wherever he could.
At this point Wanda, Bruce, Bucky and Thor had all ordered something to drink, while Tony was still intensively paying attention to the date.
"Dean, we still have that guest room down the hallway, where you woke up. If it's alright with you, then you can stay there for now." John said.
Dean always told Sam to go upstairs and close the door, when they were both drunk, but Sam heard that they hit Dean every time he said something he shouldn't have. He even saw bruises on his face and one time Dean was bleeding on his forehead because the woman had thrown a bottle at him. Sam had enough and walked up the woman and tried to talk to her, but she was angry again and slapped him in the face. Dean saw red and Sam had to use all his strength to prevent him from jumping at her. Dean grabbed everything he could, took Sam's hand and left in the middle of the night.
"Yeah... But the important thing is, do you think that with whatever you used to be in the quantum thing can be turned into a time machine?"
"You have watched this movie at least 8 times since we all moved in here. Surely you don't need it to be quiet to understand the movie."
By the end of the day, everyone was tired. Most have left to go to their families and loved ones. Castiel came back and Dean asked him to help Wanda with Vision. He and Wanda together managed to revive him. The only thing missing know, was the mind stone. But thanks to Castiel, he got his memories back and therefore the mind stone wasn‘t needed anymore.
Dean nodded. "Well, Cas and I have to check out these vampires and we still have to get the car, so we should go. Cas! Get your feathery ass over here. Time to hunt some blood suckers."
"Why this world?" Mary asked. "If there were millions of universes out there, why did you save this one?"
"Well, this is not how I expected to see you again, Dean, but we are all happy that you are alright." Tony said.
God only laughed. "Oh Dean, oh Dean. Still not giving up." He snapped his fingers and multiple cuts appeared on Deans body. Dean screamed out, as blood ran down his face, arms and torso.
"Oh he is still in the game... Just not in control of the ball." Tony said and Bucky rolled his eyes... again. "You two are the worst."
"Hunters don't care about fame, or money. We just want to help. Sometimes though you have to do something illegal, or get on the bad side of someone in order to get information. We aren't heroes, but we still try to help others."
"Because God commanded it. We have work for him.“ Castiel said and they Avengers all stared at Dean.
"Thanks guys. I- I gotta go. Bobby found something. I'll call you later." Sam ended the call leaving complete silence in the tower, until Tony spoke up.
"Rob mentioned that you and the Sam from your world had rough lives and that you went literally through hell... what did he mean by that?"
"Okay, before we all scatter into random rooms, Dean, if you give me everything you know about your father, then I should be able to find him… or rather JARVIS will find him."
"I have to thank you, kiddo. You all helped me a lot, saved me... Just keep an eye on your papa alright. If he is like me, then he can be a bit... self-sacrificing." Dean winked at Jack and he laughed.
"I know that Dean would have wanted Jack to have her one day, so..." John shrugged. "Though I did not think that you would be this bad..:"
"Nonsense! This way my lady." Tony led her out of the restaurant and told FRIDAY to bring over the quinjet. Sam followed and then glared at his brother.
"-to bring Dean back. Really?" Tony said, as he looked back at Sam. "Sam... We all miss him. Hell he was like a son to Bucky and me. But as much as it hurts to admit it, he is dead."
"No, this is different. Weird wounds, like they were attacked by animals. It couldn't have been one killer, because it happened like everywhere."
"What about that movie with the wizard and the little people with hairy feet. I enjoyed that one." Thor said and this time Tony rolled his eyes. "We have seen lord of the rings for at least 13 times already. And how can you still not know the name?"
"You hear that Dean?! We can go to school again!" Sam said happily and Dean just rolled his eyes. "Great."
"Of course. Ever since we met you and learned about the monsters, I make sure that we have loooots of it." Tony answered and opened a cupboard to reveal multiple packages of salt and a few silver knives.
"Perfect! This way, young gentlemen." Tony walked ahead and the brothers followed. They reached a big room and their eyes went wide. It had a huge king sized bed in the middle if the room. A big tv on the wall, a large table with two chairs and two laptops, a walk-in wardrobe and a door that led to a private bathroom. Everything looked brand new and clean.
"We will handle this Cap." Tony said and he and Bucky went down to the cars. They got into Tony's Audi and drove off.
"Yes. The last thing I remember is being there with Dean and- and then... I don't know what Dean did, but all I know is that I am alive and he is not here." Castiel sounded panicked.
"Garth and his family are currently on vacation and the next neighbors are further away. If we work in the backyard, then no one will see us."
The next morning was a saturday and Dean and Sam came down to an almost empty kitchen. Only Tony, Bucky, Bruce and a red haired woman were there.
Sam just laughed and Bucky too smiled, but shook his head. These boys were too much for him. They drove back and Sam read through John's journal. He figured out that he went to Black Water Ridge, Colorado.
Dean shook his head. "No, they have other things to worry about. Though if you want to tell Tony then go ahead."
Sunday was a relaxed day. Sam spend a lot of time in the library and even though Dean barely left him out of his sight, he was still a lot more relaxed now when Sam was spending time with Bruce or Steve. His brother clearly liked the Avengers and Dean didn't want to ruin their friendship just because he was paranoid. He himself got closer to Bucky as they spend some time in the gym and Dean realized, that he could learn a lot from him. The Avengers on the other hand wanted to learn more about the supernatural, so they all sat down in the evening and Dean and Sam explained the basics of hunting, like what to do against a ghost or werewolves. Bruce wrote down some stuff and Tony made some online notes.
"You died, saving others from a burning house. A girl was trapped upstairs. You sent her out the window and saved her, but then the floor gave in and half the house fell on top of you... There was nothing anyone could do." Bobby explained, knowing that the others still had problems to talk about it.
It was quiet again, until John grabbed a few beers. He gave one to Bobby, one to Ellen, one to Dean and kept one to himself. The others didn't want one.
"Then who are we going to tell? I am not sure if the kids would understand..." Castiel asked and thought about it.
"That reminds me, we could use some more salt for the road. Do you still have some?" Sam asked Tony.
"Great. Now how about you two sit down and watch some tv, while we clean everything up." Steve suggested, but Dean shook his head.
"I already told you, I can just leave. I'll just need a bit of cash and I'll be out of your hair. I will go to a different state and get a fake ID."
Steve laid a hand on Sam's shoulder. "Come on. We should eat and then we can go through this again and prepare in case a battle is unavoidable."
"Heaven. A different kind, but you have nothing to fear." Jack said. "Still, try not to die anytime soon."
They finished eating and then they went to their separate rooms. Tony still had a spare room for Dean next to Sam‘s.
Dean tried to open his eyes again, but he was too tired. He lost consciousness and everything was finally quiet....
"To dad? And his crusade? If it weren't for pictures, I wouldn't even know what mom looks like. And what difference would it make? Even if we find that thing that killed her... mom's gone. And she isn't coming back."
"We should bring the kids to bed." Bucky got up and went over to the sleeping boys, when suddenly Dean shot up and almost hit Bucky, but thankfully Bucky had good reflexes.
He heard another scream and he reached the door at the far end. He kicked it open and saw Dean, tied to a chair. Two normal looking guys stood around him and were cutting him with knives. Dean was bleeding from his mouth, his head and his arms and legs. He panted heavily.
"No, not yet. I think it would be better if we tell them all at the same time. We have to think of a way to explain it to them." Sam said  and Castiel nodded.
"Not really, no. I still have some of my grace left and therefore can use my powers to some extend.“
Dean told them that he and John were hunting together for the last 8 years and that they killed a lot of monsters. He told them that he did his own thing in New Orleans, while John was checking out a case in Jericho, California. Dean told the others about a guy that had vanished and 9 others as well in the last 20 years. John went to dig around, but Dean hadn't heard from him in the past three weeks. Then Dean showed them a voicemail that he got.
"...By the way, I'm sorry about John. I- You know we never were fans of him, because of the way he treated you both, but he was your father, so...yeah. We're all sorry."
"It's really late, or eh early... We should all try and get some rest." Mary suddenly said and everyone looked tired and agreed with her.
"Nat and Clint are on a small mission and Steve and Thor take care of some bank robbers in Washington."
"Why?" Chuck laughed slightly. "You disappoint me. That's why. I tried to find happiness in you and the rest of my creations, but after time I lost all hope and expectations."
"Well, let‘s get this damn stone.“ Tony said and they made their way to a huge mountain in front of them.
"I feared that their father would drag them down a dark road. Should have arrested him." Tony said angrily but Natasha shook her head.
"Well- maybe he was there when we were at one of those stupid foster homes. He is still dad Sam. He cares."
Dean cursed himself for breaking his phone, but there was nothing he could do. The phone had all the numbers of the Avengers and Sammy saved and he didn't bother to learn and remember them. There was nothing he could do... only hope that Sammy was safe.
"All right, come on boy. Let's have a look at her." John said and grabbed his jacket and keys. Dean grabbed a cap and a jacket from the bag and followed John outside.
Outside, Dean had shot two werewolves. They had killed five people by eating their hearts in the middle of the street. In the distance, he saw a Djinn and a Golem chasing other people. This was just wrong. It wasn't like in his world, where people could slowly turn into a creature. It was like these monsters just suddenly appeared randomly. Like someone was putting them there.
"You don't tell me what to do." God lifted his arm and suddenly Dean was pushed back and hit the ground.
He kept walking for half an hour and then he stepped out of the forest and saw the bright neon light from the sign of the gas station and made his way towards it.
"I earned it for you, so you could go to college." Dean mumbled. "And I won't really need it anyway. You know how it is on the road."
"I was on the phone with Troy. He was driving home. He said he would call me right back. And... he never did."
Dean didn't listen anymore. He looked outside and thought about Sammy. Was he alright? Did the Avengers treat him right?
He heard Cas sighing. "It's Jack. Someone has to pick him up from school because I have to help out a colleague."
Suddenly Castiel appeared next to him and Tony quickly gave him the glove, as Thanos punched Tony in the face, making him stumble back.
He turned to Jack and looked him in the eyes. "I am sorry about your father and I am not trying to replace him. I- I just hope that we get along well."
"So... What's with him?" Dean asked as he nodded at Tony who looked really concentrated at something.
"No-" Bucky hit him over the head and the guy went unconscious." Dean picked him up and brought him to the basement.
"No paparazzi, no cameras, no civilians who want your autograph. I always stay in the back and let the others handle that, especially Tony." Bucky chuckled at the memory of Tony grinning at the cameras and posing like he would be on the next vogue cover. "This is much... calmer."
Castiel looked at him. "There is a problem in Tenessee. According to a dog, there is a man who eats other animals to absorb their powers."
They sat down at one end of the table and when the others started to eat, they both instantly started to dig in as well. Both Sam and Dean never had a meal like this and after eating they were both so full, that they thought they never had to eat anything in their life ever again.
Dean just shrugged. "Sam and Cas always tend to mention all the problems we have. One of us had to be the optimistic one."
Lucifers eyes went wide, when he saw that the suit was covered in angel trap sigils and angel depowering sigils. The suit was also covered in holy oil.
John looked over to his son and sighed. "I know you miss your brother, but he made his choice and I don't want some superheroes to get involved in this. They'll only cause trouble."
"No Sam. He needs to hear this. You left, Dean. You chose this life. He did not and it is time for you to accept it."
"Tony always hums the music theme for like days after we watched the movie." Bucky answered annoyed.
"GOD! Come out you asshole! Don't be a fucking coward! I know it's you!" Dean yelled, while Sam, John and Castiel looked around, scared of more monsters attacking.
Jody looked lost and sat down again. Kevin went a hand through his hair and the others looked lost as well.
A few weeks later and almost everything was back to normal. The government changed a bit and SHIELD took care of the major problems in the country. The Avengers build a new compound with a huge training area. Sam met with Jess and when he told her of what happened, he also told her about the supernatural and that he was a hunter. To his surprise, Jess didn't leave and wanted to stay with Sam and build a future with him.
Dean sighed and sat down on a chair next to Steve, keeping an eye on his brother, as he and Bruce discussed some books.
"Go! Go!" The three men ran away from the car and when the Impala got closer, they jumped over the railing of the bridge.
"Dean!" He ran out into the corridor again and looked around. He kicked open another door, but it was empty.
Bucky slowly got up, but then the guy stood suddenly next to him, grabbed Bucky's head and slammed it against the wall and Bucky lost consciousness.
"That and we finally changed the Mustangs tires. Wanted to do that for a while." John said. "Has everyone been informed about tomorrow?"
"He- We had to get the stones in order to bring everyone back... Dean sacrificed himself.“ Tony looked at them. "I am so sorry.“ He whispered.
"Are you sure this is the right place, Tony?" Bucky asked, as they both walked through a dark forest in the middle of nowhere.
"NOOO!!" He slowly walked towards the entrance of the cage and they could see that Lucifer was fighting against it.
"Don't tell me you didn't mention it. Oh Sammy, always trying to be humble." Tony said and Sam rolled his eyes he looked over and saw the other Avengers as well as Dean and Cas sitting there. He groaned.
After eating Tony suggested that they go shopping for some clothes. Dean didn't want Tony to spend any money for them, but Tony insisted.
"What could be so important that dad would skip out in the middle of a job? Dean, what the hell is going on?" Sam looked ahead and saw the woman standing on the street. He stopped the car and Dean instantly worried.
Dean stopped breathing for a second. There was a boy standing beside a crib and he looked up. A woman was burning on the ceiling.
"Had some trouble with the government, you know about them controlling us and keeping us in check. The old thing." Tony explained.
Bucky looked at Sam and Sam walked away. He looked tired and lost. Bucky too was scared. This were Dean's last hours and they still had no idea how to save him.
Dean sighed. Better talk now, than getting into trouble later. "Our father is a hunter. Always took care of us, but three years ago he vanished. Been looking for him everywhere, but so far nothing. The police realized that we were homeless and put us into an orphanage. After our last foster home we ran away and hid in the cabin where you found us. We have been there before with our father and he had canned food and a lot of weapons hidden in there."
They hung up and Bucky went to Tony, to see if he already found something. Tony tried everything, but it was like Sam had completely vanished. He barely slept because of it and Bucky became more and more worried.
"Look! There!" He pointed towards some light, coming from a cabin and they slowly made their way towards it.
"Just promise me that you will look out for Sammy. He will try to bring me back, but it’s too dangerous."
"Yeah, all the trees around me were destroyed, like the place was nuked... I found the street and was actually not that far from Bobby's."
"Sammy got psychic powers and he got stabbed after fighting in a battle royal with other special kids." Dean explained.
It was a calm Sunday evening, when FRIDAY informed the Avengers that Sam was calling them again. All of the Avengers were there this time, as they had just fought against Hydra soldiers and took down one of their main bases.
Chuck raised his hand again and looked Dean deep in the eyes. "You have courage. You are probably my greatest creation ever, but now it's time to move on."
"Just for a few minutes. God had erased every living thing and it was just Sam and me, but I found him at an old gas station. I wanted to bring him home. It was a miracle that he was still alive, even though everyone else was gone, but... God saw and dissolved him as well..."
"Come here." Dean walked over and the guy pointed at the car. "This old beauty rattles a bit. Any idea?"
"Our rooms are not far, so again just tell JARVIS when something is wrong and one of us will be here in a second."
Dean nodded and leaned his head against the window of the Impala, as John drove them further and further away from New York.
"Anyway, I got in there a few days ago. My eh... friends were outside the machine and were supposed to get me out of there again, but they didn't. Now I came out of it by accident and learn that it's 2022!"
Then suddenly the light in the room became brighter and the shadow behind Castiel got bigger. Then suddenly the shadow formed wings behind his back and they spread across the whole wall in the back.
"What is it, Dean? I mean beside the obvious." John asked him. They all sat down on the chairs on the front porch and Dean sighed.
Dean didn't say anything and took a gun and a knife for himself, as well as a jacket. "I try to be home tonight, maybe it really was just a dog attack."
"First of all, we are not 'little kids'. And second, our mother is dead and our father- well… he will be home soon."
"You should look after your children. They'll need you now more than ever." Dean said in a raspy voice and the man nodded and mouthed a 'thank you' to Dean and helped the medics to check his kids for any injuries.
"Those creatures... they were horrible." Dean said. "I was fucking scared when I was a kid, but I had to be strong to protect my little brother... I learned to shoot a gun while other kids played catch on the playground. If everyone knew, then so would the children and they could never get a restful sleep, because they would be too scared that a ghost or a demon would walk in and try to kill them. Believe me when I tell you that no one wants that life. Everyone would panic and stupid people would try to get powers out of it or kill innocent people just because they think they are monsters but actually aren't. So, it was better if only a few knew."
"Dean always tried to make things better for everyone. Helping his parents, helping his brohter, helping me. He took everything on his shoulders and never accepted help or compliments. It took a while for him to open up to everything and accept who he is."
"Will you tell the kids?" Castiel asked Sam. He himself wasn't sure if he should talk to Jack about this or not.
Tony drove into the garage, which was on the lowest floor of the tower and they all got out. Dean and Sam grabbed their bags and even though Bucky offered to carry them, Dean insisted that he carried his own, even with his arm still bleeding a little bit.
Dean sighed, placed the peanut butter and sandwiches on the table and sat down on the couch, slumping into the seat. "Ran into some werewolves."
"It was memory." Dean clarified and looked down. Then he realized that it must still be the middle of the night. "Oh god, I'm so sorry! I woke you up and-"
"Fine. How was the mission?" Sam smiled and they walked up to Sam and each of them sat down on one side of him.
Castiel groaned, but then turned back to Jack. "Uncle Dee is a strong man and the monsters can not hurt him. He has his family and his friends and I am sure they will be alright."
"See, wasn't so bad." The guy said. "Now you just-" He was cut off, as he heard a crash next to him and he turned around in shock. He saw the ghost woman and stared at her in shock. She looked at him and it was enough of a distraction for Sam to shoot him in the shoulder without him hurting Dean.
"No Tony. I know you are tired. Hell I have been tired for almost all my life now. But this could work. And even if it doesn't, we have to at least try."
Steve was on a phone, talking to SHIELD and he joined the others when he finished. "SHIELD will send a team over to go through the files and destroy everything else. Hopefully we can get some information about other bases."
They reached the room where the body of the ghost laid and Sam and Dean stopped for a second. Dean took out his lighter and looked at the ghost, who stood next to her corpse. "Thank you." He said and dropped the lighter onto the body. The ghost started to catch on fire and vanished with a small smile on her face.
"Dean?! Bucky?!" He screamed and then thankfully he saw the two men crawling out of the dirty river to the shore.
They talked for hours and hours, until they got nothing to talk about anymore and went to bed, to rest up for the next day.
"Dean." Both said and got up immediately. They ran over to the guest room and when they opened the door, they saw Dean squirming and shaking on the bed. Miracle stood helplessly next to the bed and whimpered.
The next three months they all spend time to do some research about saving Dean’s life, but... so far no luck. Dean on the other hand went hunting. Sometimes with Sam and sometimes with Bucky. They realized that he got more and more restless, but he would not talk to anybody about it.
"I will check the web... See if I can find similar cases where people have claimed to have come back from the dead. Maybe there is a way." Sam said and grabbed his computer from the coffee table.
"Them and People. They… they hurt us. I tried to protect him, but I couldn’t. He got hurt and- and-"
"Welcome to the greatest place on earth. The Avengers tower!" Tony announced happily and he gestured for the boys to come in.
"Y-You are back. Back and alive." Castiel sobbed and Dean hugged him tight. "I don't know what's going on, but you know that I dont like it when you two cry." Dean told them and Castiel laughed slightly. Sam, Mary and John walked up to them.
FRIDAY informed the Avengers that the Winchester brothers arrived and they immediately got up to greet them.
"Couldn't sleep much, huh?" Dean turned around and saw John. The old man looked tired, just like he himself felt.
Jack smiled and nodded. "I just restored it. It is a time before God got rid of everyone. Before everything went downhill."
"We are telling the truth." Castiel said and everyone looked more shocked. Castiel is known to be a horrible liar and he is even worse with pranks. Also, he would never joke about Dean.
Dean shrugged. "No one knows. Probably a lot. We will never find all of them, but at least we prevented them from turning everyone who workes at the factory into skinwalkers. Most of the time they have packs, like wolves. So if they were the main ones, then this area should be alright."
"In most universes that God created, there were angels, demons and mosters. Only a few worlds are like this, were there are no supernatural beings. For example, there was one where the whole world was taken over by zombies. Another one only has vampires and werewolves and some of them have angels and demons. Heaven and Hell. In Dean's world, there were all these creatures and more. The world was full of them and Dean was a hunter, just like the rest of his family."
"You know that I tend to overthink things. Believe me, I looked at hundrets of rings and even thought about making two on my own, but then there was always this voice in my head saying he deserves someone better."
"Tomorrow is Sunday, so everyone should have time. That way we can tell everyone at once." John said.
"You know, I am so sick of you, proving myself to you. You wanna save yourself? This is how, you dumb, spineless dick."
"He is the one who 'raised me from perdition' and tried to contact me after I came back. You know, the whole noise thing that was going on... it was him trying to say 'hello'." Dean explained.
The next morning Dean was in a good mood. He smiled, ate a lot and made stupid jokes. Sam tried to smile as well, but he knew that his brother was hiding something. He chose to ignore it for now because Dean probably needed some time.
The all turned around to see John and the others running towards them. John raised his gun and pointed it at Jack.
After they ran away from their last foster home, they managed to find an old cabin where they once stayed with their father, before he vanished. They found some weapons and canned food, but Dean had to fight more and more monsters recently, so their silver, salt and holy water slowly ran out.
"I’m tired Tony. Sam and I had a lot of close calls and I don’t want this anymore. Sammy deserves a better life and I’m just dragging him with me. There are more and more demons out there and I don’t know if I can and want to fight them alone... I wish I never left with dad."
"You can not just leave! We still don't know what's going on." Sam said, got up and walked in front of Dean, blocking the door.
Sam smiled at them. "I mean it. Just because Jack is up there, doesn't mean you two get a free pass for everything."
"Don't apologize Sam. We‘re sorry for what happened, but we are also glad you boys are both alright." Steve said.
"This is the great living room and right behind it is one of the many kitchens. We have three fridges in here, because you know, Hulk and Thor... and Sam's brother Dean. They all eat a lot..." Tony wanted to continue, but Bucky and Dean stepped in to help Sam.
"Grab all the salt, silver knifes and guns that you have." Dean said, as already scanned the area around the house. It felt like there was trouble in the air.
"Ah good morning boys. Come on, eat. Before Thor eats everything." Tony said with a smile. He and the other Avengers were already there and it looked like they had waited for them.
"Sir, I have tried to analyse it as soon as it started, but I have not yet been able to identify where it came from or what it was."
"Alright boys. Try to stick to the topic." John grumbled. "The only one I can still think of would be Crowley."
"Well... My father has a fake FBI ID, so he talks to the police and witnesses and tries to get as much information as he can. Since I am way too young to be FBI, I always sneak around and try to figure other stuff out that helps. In this case..." He nodded towards where a woman stood crying next to some police officers. He walked over and Bucky followed him.
"Oh. Oh, so you're just too stupid to live, is that it?" She said angrily. "Then fine. You deserve hell. And I wish I could be there, Dean. I wish I could smell the flesh sizzle off your bones. I wish I could be there to hear you scream!"
"Alright you two. Knock it off." Bucky interrupted. "We will see what we can do. Maybe we can come up with something…?" Bucky looked at Tony and Bruce, who were already thinking about possible ideas.
"He is their father. If he calls the police then there will be only more trouble for the kids." Steve agreed.
Dean turned to leave, but then stopped and walked over to Sam again. He reached into his pocket and took out some money. "Here."
"Everything alright?" Tony and Bucky turned around and saw another boy, who was even younger, holding a gun.
Sam didn't know what to say. Dean seemed like a sane person, but after everything he just heard, how could he still pretend to be alright? He should be visibly broken, but instead, he looked like a strong man who just didn't get enough sleep. Could someone really get used to that kind of life...?
Sam did not realize that the Avengers had returned, until he heard Tony clearing his throat. He turned around and Tony and Bucky stood at the entrance of the room.
"Not really, but knowing Dean he would feel bad for dragging you with us. He already feels bad about me and Bobby coming along. But don't worry. We will be fine."
Bucky knelt down on one knee so he was at Sam's eye level. "Hey,  it's okay. I am sure your brother just needs some time and being out here in public was probably just too much for him."
Tony got up and put a hand on Buckys shoulder. "He didn't mean it. He just needs time." Bucky nodded and slowly everyone got up and went to bed.
He looked behind Castiel and saw his little brother. He stood there, holding Mjölnir and looking tired, but he was here, alive.
"Well, enough about the Avengers. How about we sit down and talk more about... us." Jessica smiled and Sam smiled back. "Yeah. I would like that."
"No, I am not. My family is dead. You guys are just other versions of them... I don't belong here..." Dean whispered and Miracle started to whimper and laid his head on Dean's leg. Dean gently stroked his head and sighed. "Sorry guys, it's just... You all have normal lives here. Don't let me ruin it for you."
Dean came across an old car garage. He often helped his father with the Impala, so maybe he could help out here and earn some money.
"We should let them in and see who he is and what they want." Steve suggested and Tony told FRIDAY to let them in.
"Dean! Are you alright? Cas told us what happened." Sam asked him, as he, John, Marry, Eileen, the twins and Bobby visited the next morning. Dean, Castiel and Jack just finished breakfast and currently sat outside on the front porch.
"To you, Dean Winchester. The man I fell in love with.“ Cas said and drank his beer. Dean only stood there, looking at Cas.
"Like I said, I will leave. I am sorry, that you guys got dragged into this, but this has nothing to do with you." Dean said and got up.
"Bobby and Ellen found him unconscious on the side of the road. They were close by and so they brought him here." Mary said.
"By the way, I made a new program and I just installed it in JARVIS. Maybe... maybe it'll help with the search."
FRIDAY told the other Avengers, including Sam that they should come to the main floor and assist if necessary.
"We just have to make them realize that it is a family secret. I'm sure they will understand." Sam said.
Castiel walked over to him. "I have to go to heaven. See what is going on there.“ He took off the glove and his wings disappeared. Dean looked disappointed.
Dean smiled and walked towards the door. "Just call if you need something." He walked out and closed the door.
"You boys could be perfect for out little experiments." The guy said and slightly cut at Dean's throat, that a little bit of blood was drawn.
"And tell them that we found our dead son on the side of the road, months after he died?" John asked and Mary sighed.
"Your father didn't say anything, but I won't leave an eight year old boy alone in a big house." Dean explained and to his surprise, he saw a small smile on Jack's lips.
They made their way to Jericho and when they reached the area, they found a bunch of police officers on a bridge. Dean stopped the car and they got out.
Bobby nodded. "They- We were all... not coping well. It will be hard to convince them it's really you."
"We should call Jody, Charlie and the others as well. Tell them to stay inside, until we figured everything out." Mary said and grabbed her phone to make some calls.
"I saw your reaction at dinner. Maybe you can fool the others, but not me. And neither Sam. He just wants to give you more space."
Dean looked at Tony, Bucky and the rest of the team. "Keep him safe. Come on Cas." Dean left and Cas followed him.
"Really, again? Come on Sam. We all know how fucked up this is. You should just stay out of this. Try to live a normal life-"
"Well you guys don’t want to go and live with other people, but we also can not let you guys live on your own in the woods. We have enough space,  you can go to school and you can tell us more about these monsters. The more we know about them, the better we can protect others." Tony explained and Dean thought about it for a moment.
"Ah! You damn-" Right then Natasha, Tony and Wanda came into the room, followed by Steve, who was supporting Bucky.
The elevator opened and Sam and Dean were overwhelmed by the luxurious room. There was a huge living room, with a gigantic tv screen, multiple couches and a large coffee table. Behind that was a big dining table and a kitchen with fruits and snacks lying around.
"No! I can not go over there. She would instantly loose interest in Sam and would want to hang out with me." Tony shouted/whispered.
Dean looked at Sam curious. "How? I only remind him of the man who was like a father to him, who he lost."
Chuck cleared his throat and started to explain. "God exists. In the past, he created the universe, but not just one. He created many. Too many to count. He created different characters, different worlds and realities. Some are similar and some are completely different."
Right then Tony came around the corner with around 30 people following him and more and more joined the mop of paparazzi.
Castiel, Sam and Mary went back inside the house and  explained everything to Eileen, while John and Dean drove to John's place to grab some guns and salt.
Dean looked at Castiel, not sure what to say. He remembered what his Cas said to him, right before the Empty took him. He remembered the way Cas looked at him, tears in his eyes, but still happy. Of all humans out there, it was him he fell in love with and even now Dean couldn't understand why. All the things he had done, all the flaws he has and Cas fell in love with him. And now he is... The Castiel from this world loved his other version. Even being married and being fathers....
Castiel nodded and looked straight ahead at the Avengers. They looked at him and waited for something to happen.
"We, John and I, well... this is our house. By the way, we are in Lawrence, Kansas. John was a marine. He fixes cars now and I work at the town's hospital." Mary explained and Dean nodded. It was weird for him to see all these faces, knowing who they are and still feeling completely disconnected with them.
Suddenly he appeared in the old bunker. He was in his room and grabbed a cassette tape from the table. It was the one he had made for Cas, his top 13 Zepp Traxx. He then heard voices. Sam and Cas.
"I hope so. Jack is a sweet and smart boy, but he is also really shy and it takes some time for him to get used to other people."
The girls asked one question after another and Dean just stared at them. How did Sammy manage to get such hyperactiv little devils?
They said at the same time and Happy chuckled. He brought them back to the tower, where the Avengers had already prepared dinner.
It was a picture of Dean, Castiel and a young Jack. The boy was not older than six and grinned, while his eyes were closed. He was on top of Dean's shoulders and Dean was looking lovingly at Castiel, who stood next to him. Castiel smiled up at Dean and Jack and Dean could see the happiness in his eyes... He wished he could have made his Cas just as happy...
"I will go back to Ellen and Jo. We have enough salt there, even some knives I think." Bobby said and Dean explained to him everything about salt-circles.
"Well you are both alive and Dean seemed fine to me. But if anything would happen to you or Dean, we would take care of you both."
"Please, Sam. Come home. We will hunt monsters and demons and make those fuckers pay, but... don't sacrifice your own life for someone who has been dead for months." Bucky said. Sam looked at them with teary eyes.
"Maybe a great warrior?" Thor was also interested and Sam slammed his head on the table. Bucky decided to help him out.
"You live in a mansion full of superheroes Sammy, but even they did not know about the things out there. You have a responsibility."
"Hello Castiel. I am not the Jack from your world, but it's still good to see you." Jack smiled at him.
"I created you. All of you. You can not do anything against me." God pushed them all back and to them it felt like their bones were being crushed..
After walking for around a few minutes, they stumbled into a restaurant. It was further away from where the fight happened and so most people were relaxed and only looked confused and/or exited when they saw the Avengers walking in.
"We heard the screaming too. Apparently some people went missing in this area, so we thought we should have a look." Dean said.
"Oh, look who is talking. The last two hunts before this one, you were the one who needed saving." Dean said to his little brother.
"Well, I want to be honest, it was difficult. Jack and I... We were both down after your death. I- I tried to be a good father, but it wasn't easy. Thankfully Sam, John and Mary helped, but-"
"I don't know... what if they talk about this in school?" Eileen said. "I don't want them to get into trouble with other kids." She said and gestured worriedly.
"So... Let me repeat it. I died four months ago in the fire, then another 'me' appeared from another universe because a part of God, called Rob, brought him here, because God, who was called Chuck was evil and tried to kill the other 'me' and all the other worlds and this was the only universe that Rob could safe.
"I will go with them, I have to get the impala." Sam said. Now that he knew his brother was save, he should get car out of there, but Steve guided him onto the couch.
"That's great. We are glad you are happy." Steve said and then turned to Dean. "How was it for you?"
The others more or less ignored the news, as people died by accidents every day, but Dean leaned forward and looked closer at the pictures that they showed on the news.
They mourned his death, thought of way to bring him back, but they knew it was not possible. Dean was gone.
"Then we should have a good fight and see who is the better warrior!" Thor yelled and Steve looked a bit nervous.
"Not really. I swear he loved that car more than me. After he died, I asked John if he wanted the car back, but he insisted that I keep her. Even though I know nothing about cars..." Castiel muttered the last part and Dean smiled.
"If it's too painful for you to see us, because we remind you of your family, then we will leave you alone. But if you need us, if you don't want to be alone... then please stay." Castiel said and looked Dean in the eyes.
Now it was late at night and Dean and Bucky stopped at a gas station. They were on a hunt and fought against some ghouls. Dean was really impressed by how fast Bucky had learned to hunt. He even got better at lying to the civilians. As Bucky went inside to pay, Dean waited at the car and looked around. Then suddenly in the distance he saw a certain car driving towards the city. It looked just like his dad's Impala.
"Well, the view here is certainly incredible." Jessica said and turned to the large window from where you could see most of New York.
"That poor thing! Tell Dean if he ever needs my help with the car, then I will fly over and be there in a few minutes!"
Dean nodded. "Well I'm just glad that you are all fine." Dean smiled and then leaned over and kissed Castiel on the cheek.
"He wouldn't want you to get yourself into trouble to bring him back." Bucky explained, but Sam shook his head.
Castiel sighed and walked over to him. He gently placed a hand on Dean's shoulder. "The couch  is more comfortable."
"...right. Look, I just wanted to check in. Felt bad for not calling. How are things with you? We couldn't really watch the news recently."
"Here.“ Cas said and handed Dean the glove with the infinity stones. "I will be back soon.“ And then he was gone. Dean stood there and looked at the glove. Just six little stones, but so powerful.
"Especially because of that. Don't get me wrong, we didn't like the fact that a 15 year old went out to hunt monsters, but you did it to help your dad, to protect Sam and others... Most kid's would hide, but you always fight. Yes, you are reckless and can be an idiot sometimes, but you have your heart in the right place." Bucky said.
"Go. Run, run." Sam said and all of them ran over to the house as fast as they could. The demons ran after them and Bucky and Dean prepared to fight, as Sam tried to unlock the door.
"I am still a better guardian to Sam than most adults. And when you send us to the orphanage or the police, then we will just run away again."
"Tony is right. It is almost midnight. We have enough rooms. You can stay here and tomorrow we will bring you home. As long as it's alright with your parents?" Steve said and Dean just glared at him.
"I-... I know that I look like the 'Dean' that you knew, but I am not him. I'm... I'm from another world, where everything is different. Like your parents told you, I will stay here for a while, if it's alright with you."
Chuck sighed. "Alright. You are all confused as to what's going on and I guarantee you that it won't be easy to understand. And before you all try to throw in yous comments, let me finish and tell you what happened."
Now Dean had only hours left and Bucky observed as Sam talked to Dean. He told his brother that‘s it‘s going to be fine, that he would do anything to prevent Dean from getting dragged to hell. Bucky looked at Dean, as he looked at Sam and for a split second he saw that Dean‘s eyes looked confused and scared. But then Dean nodded and pretended to be alright again.
He took a deep breath and looked around. The house stood in front of a forest with a lot of space around it. In the distance he heard cars driving, so the road to the town was probably not far. They had no direct neighbors, so it would be alright for him to be outside, though he still put on a cap, just in case.
"Bruce, buddy? You alright?" Tony asked him and Bruce pointed ahead. The other Avengers looked in the same direction and their eyes widened. There, in the corner of the restaurant was non other than Sam fucking Winchester... with a girl!
"Not yet. Most people around here knew you. Like we said, our Dean saved a lot of people and even got some medals from the major for it."  John said with pride.
Sam scratched the back of his neck. "Yeah... sorry I didn't mention it. I just- it's true what I said, that my brother and are on a road trip currently. And we do stay at a hotel, though this is basically our second home... After my brothers car."
"Shit! FRIDAY?!" Tony asked and he activated his suit. The other Avengers too prepared to fight, though they didn't know what to fight.
Bucky sighed and then he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked up and saw Tony standing behind his seat.
"I am the 'Part of God' that Dean mentioned. You can call me Rob. I saved this universe, right before it would have been destroyed. And I saved Dean and put him here, because this is the only place available now."
"It was three days before Thanos' men first came to look for the stones. It was just him and me in the woods, by the lake where I now have the house. We talked about setteling down there. And then he just... God I was so happy."
"Yes." Sam nodded with confidence and Bucky smiled. Then he turned to Dean and grinned. "And you, idiot, take care of your brother and don't cause too much trouble."
John lowered his gun and the kids ran past him. Eva and Zoe ran up to Sam and hugged him and little Jack ran into Castiel's arms and cried with relief. Eileen ran up to her husband as well and John, Mary and Dean smiled at them.
"Have you found your father yet?" Bruce asked, though he had a feeling that he already knew the answer.
"It could be some experiement by the government... Though I don't know, why they would bring Dean back to life..." John said.
"You know some people often walk around in these woods." She turned to Dean. "So, please put on a hat."
God chuckled. "Haha yeah... not happening." He snapped his finger, but nothing happened. He snapped again, still nothing. God started to panic. He snapped multiple times and looked around. He glared at his shaking hands. "...no... no no no no NO! What did you do?!"
"Eh thanks." Dean said and looked up at the ceiling. Then he put on a fresh shirt, but didn't bother to change the rest.
"Come on Sam." Dean whispered and grabbed Sam's hand. They got out of there before they were swarmed and watched from afar how annoyed Bucky, Bruce and Pepper looked. Tony on the other hand did not seem to mind, though maybe he was just more used to it and hid the annoyance better.
"Dean, I can take hi-" "No!" Dean snapped at Bucky. "No one will touch him." He whispered and carried Sam out of the livingroom and into their bedroom.
The Dean that just returned from the dead turned around and saw an older Jack and... another 'him' standing there. "What the-?! I-Is that... me?!" Dean just grinned at him.
Bucky pointed to the table in the back and Deans eyes widened. "... Nooooo waaayyy." He sat down next to Tony.  "I bet he is ruining it."
He saw a colorful tunnel and thanks to his suit, that Tony had programmed, he was able to navigate through it.
"It wasn't that bad. Sammy and I... We had each other. The Impala was our home, though we stayed at Bobby's from time to time as well."
"No, though they did have some history... and then there was that one time, where Balthazar saved the Titanic and everything was different because of it and Bobby and Ellen were together..."
"We are just glad that you are fine. When we couldn't reach you and even JARVIS couldn't locate you, we all kind of panicked." Bucky said and remembered the time when Sam was in his room crying and he or Tony went in there to comfort the young boy.
"Your father was possessed?" Bruce asked. He wondered if it was similar to when the Hulk took over for him.
"We told them we have to sort out some things and that they should stay at uncle Bobby's and aunt Ellen's house for now." Sam explained.
They reached the neighberhood and found the house where a little girl, possessed by Lilith was. She kept the parents hostage. They looked around and saw the other neighbors, but Dean told them that he could see their true form, thanks to being to close to death now.
"We should think about who we tell about Dean anyway. He can not stay inside for the rest of his life." John commented and the others nodded.
"Exactly. That's what I'm worried about. If it's Azazel... I don't even know, he- he should be dead. How did he get here?" Dean was just tired and confused.
Dean leaned against the wall in the far back, while John and Mary got something to drink for everyone.
After another 10 minutes of driving, the tower finally came into view and the brothers looked impressed by the size of it.
"Eh… what was that?" Tony asked and activated his suit. It came out of his car and flew directly to him and covered Tony's body. Bucky too got into fighting position.
"DEAN!!" Castiel yelled, as he saw him vanishing in the smoke. Miracle barked, but then hid behind Castiel, just like Jack.
"Thanks Bucky." Dean said and then cleared his throat. "I'll keep looking for him. Let me know if Tony finds something."
"Yeah... anyway, Sam was supposed to be Lucifer's vessel and I Michael's. Michael could then lock Lucifer back again and the angels would win. But a fight between the two of them would destroy half the earth, or something like that." Dean explained. "Cas warned us, but sadly after Sam killed Lilith. Now we are running from demons AND angels."
He looked around and realized that he was in a small room, on a bed. There was a window and he saw that it was dark outside, which explained why he could barely see anything.
"Nonsense. Of course I have to. I don't know why Dean is not answering his phone, but I am sure he has a reason. Probably a stupid one..." Tony muttered with a small smile.
Steve and the others were tired and they feared that they would loose the fight, when Thanos stood there with his army behind him. But then Steve heard Falcon over his com link and magic circles appeared around them. Black Panther, Wanda, Bucky and every other fighter came to help. Steve stood proud in front of them.
"... Not much. I remeber the hellhounds and then... darkness. Then I woke up underground, trying to dig myself out. The place where I was buried, looked weird."
Sam, Dean and Castiel drew a sigil on the ground in an old building. They chose one that was further away from civilization, in case that something goes wrong. Cas brought holy oil and they prepared the trap for Lucifer, as well as the summoning ritual.
Dean rolled his eyes. "I must be doing something wrong, if my 11 year old brother tries to tell me what to do."
"Yeah, you only mentioned you had some family issues and that you wanted some friends to know. Who else will be here?" Charlie asked.
Dean's head shot up. He knew that sound. The three men walked outside and saw Castiel parking the Impala in front of the house.
"... How are you? I didn't have the chance to ask you last time... about John." Bucky asked, trying to change the subject. Dean was freaking out over Sam and he had to calm down, if he wanted to find him.
"Ha! We did it." Tony said happily and removed the helmet. He grinned at Bucky, but his partner looked worriedly at the two kids. Tony turned around and saw why…
It was Thursday afternoon, when Sam had visited and he and Dean took out Miracle and Sam's dogs for a walk.
"All of them saved many lives and killed hundrets of them. But it got... more difficult for Sam and Dean." Rob explained, as he looked over to Dean, who was still looking deep in thought. "They got involved with angels and demons. They even died multiple times and went literally through hell."
"We don't know... He just... He looks and acts like him, but we don't know if it's truly him" Bobby explained.
Jack still didn't want to look at Dean and Castiel had knelt down, to rub small circles on Jack's back.
Dean knelt down and patted the dog. "Miracle?" As if the dog understood him, Miracle barked happily and started to lick Dean's face.
"...Dean... you are the most honorable man that I have ever known.“ Tony whispered and hugged Dean tightly.
"Well, you know the basics, but if you really want to fight, then you should learn a few more moves."
"I had a job in the city. Some killings happened. I thought it was the yellow eyed demon but it was a false lead."
They fought and fought and suddenly Steve flew past Sam. Thanos had punched him and send him flying half a mile until he landed next to Sam
"... I'll build a better hospital in here. You gave me the feeling that they will show up here quite often, probably close to dying." Tony muttered. "Oh! And better weapons. Maybe I should build them suits. Yes! That will help them!" Tony was in overprotective-mode and instantly wanted to help the boys, even though they just left. Bucky only laughed and looked outside the window. They would be fine. They had to be. Otherwise he would loose two boys who were like sons to him and he wasn't sure if he or Tony, or any of the Avengers could deal with that.
"Oh Dean... Don't look at me like that. You should be angry with the other part of me. He dragged you here. I just wanted to kill you. I would have killed everyone here in an instant and they wouldn't even have realized. But he... he had to try and play hero. I mean, he is a part of me, so I guess it's also my fault, but-"
Dean nodded and then turned to Sam, who was still looking around. He could see that Sam was nervous, but also exited. Sam was always amazed by the Avengers and wanted to be a hero because of them. When they had watched the news when the aliens attacked, they were both impressed when they saw the Avengers fighting. But Dean already guessed back then that they had no idea about the supernatural.
"Oh come on! You are Tony fucking Stark. I told him and I will tell you as well. You two are perfect for each other. Weather you like it or not."
"Dean?" Bobby asked. Suddenly everyone heard a loud, high pitched noise. Dean started to scream and got to his knees, trying to cover his ears with his hands.
"Yes, we just had some trouble earlier and now there is some blood on the Impala and Dean is trying to make her look good again." They could basically hear Sam rolling his eyes, but Tony nodded.
He took the lighter from his pocket and looked around. He was in a coffin... He was buried underground.
"Dean... he... he is so strong. For 30 years he didn't do it. But then he couldn't... not- not any longer."
"And here I thought my father was father of the year." Tony said sarcastically and Dean was about to snap at him, but Bucky stepped between them.
"Yes, you are! I'm sorry. I mean, this was all my fault. I know that... But what you're doing is not gonna save me. It's only gonna kill you."
His plan worked and the man turned around to see, whatever Dean saw. Dean took the chance and grabbed the sandwiches and ran out of the store.
Dean waited and waited and waited. He looked at his stark phone and he had 10 new messages and 4 missed calls. He sighed and wrote Sam a quick message, telling him that he works a bit longer. He didn't want to explain it over the phone, but if he said nothing, then Tony would probably start a search party for him.
Castiel grabbed the salt and they scattered it around the doors and windows, while Mary distracted the children.
Dean nodded. He really was surprised, that just after a few days, he would already feel save and more at home.
"I would appreciate it, if you would not compare me to that... to that horrible being." Chuck said, as he suddenly stood inside the house, in the living room.
"Where are you two going?" Natasha asked. She, Steve and Bruce were in the kitchen, cleaning up dinner, while Clint and Thor played some video games.
"I feared that Cas would have no idea about cars in this world as well..." He muttered, as he petted Miracle, who followed them outside.
Bucky sat in the corner, next to Natasha and felt the drugs slowly wearing off, while the others took care of Dean. At this point he was almost passed because of all the blood loss, but they had bandaged most of his injuries.
"We should go... I have to work tomorrow and the girls will have to go to school, but if you need anything, ju-"
"Come on, sit down and tell uncle Tony what's going on." Tony tried to lighten the mood, but Bucky looked lost and almost scared.
"Ooohhh this will be great." Clint said and he, Natasha, Steve, Bruce and Sam all stood at the side to watch.
It was quiet, until Mary came back with some water. Dean thanked her and told them that he is fine now. John had to convince Mary to leave, but in the end, they left Dean alone and went back to bed.
"Ruby went into one room and Sam and Bucky into another. They saw the bed and the mother and Lilith in it. Sam raised the knife and slowly walked up to the bed. The mother was awake and looked terrified. "Do it." She said.
Then Ellen spoke up. "Well, I am Ellen Singer. I have a daughter named Jo and after a... not so good working relationship, she and I moved here, where I met Bobby. We married a few years ago. We own the roadhouse, which is not far from here and Bobby owns a junkyard, where he and John fix the cars."
Dean sighed and stopped looking Bucky in the eyes. "It wasn't four month you know." He finally said.
"Lilith. She broke them and she was also the last seal. With her death, Lucifer's cage broke down." Dean said.
"You know us as superheroes. But not as normal people. So, I am Tony Stark,… here we have Captain Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes, Natasha Romanoff, Clint Barton, Bruce Banner and Thor. You already know JARVIS and depending how long you are going to stay here, you could also meet Pepper Potts, Happy and probably Agent. Who I am sure already knows that you guys are here."
"Really? If you wanted to die, then why did you get up again? He pushed you down, he hurt you. But you got up again. Because you owe your family, that you at least try. That you try to live a happy life, even though everything was lost. You never gave up."
"Well, you killed these eh- things with it and my buddy here couldn’t. So we just wanted to know, how you did it…"
"Of course. If something goes wrong, then Cas can zap us out of there.“ Dean said and smiled at his, now officially, boyfriend.
"There was a wendigo and we ran out of ammo, but dad and I still had some explosives. I lost my phone and it was too close to the wendigo. The explosion went off and booom."
"Yeah, wish I could say the same for you. What were you thinking, shooting Casper in the face, you freak?"
When Dean reached the living area, he saw everyone there. It seemed that they were just discussing something.
"Dude I think it's not even a two star hotel. And we came into town at like four in the morning. We were tired and didn't want to wake you, so we just crashed at the first hotel we passed."
Now, two months after Dean's death, all the Avengers came back from a mission. When they entered the Avengers tower, FRIDAY had told them that Sam had left.
Cas‘ eyes widened, as all the energy went through him. Thanos wanted to grab him, but then a strong force left Castiel‘s body and Thanos and everyone around him was pushed away.
"Hey guys, I-" He stopped when he saw Dean. His eyes widened and he forgot to breath for a moment. "D-Dean...?"
"Well, I got a message from Charlie and missed calls from Bobby, so something is-" Sam stopped when he saw someone out of the corner of his eyes.
Castiel looked up at him. "You are not someone who can decide about the fate of the universe.“ Castiel said put the glove on.
Dean sighed. "Time doesn't heal all scars. It won't get better, just because it happened some time ago."
"Papa!" Jack ran to him as well and cried into his arms, as Dean hugged his husband and his son with confusion.
Dean just grinned and pulled his arm away. "Alright, sorry. You are right." He tried to look like he was really sorry. He took out the peanut butter and pretended to put it back in the shelf. He looked past the man, tilted his head and looked confused, as if he saw something weird.
"We should focus on the rings. Cas and I will handle it. You guys keep an eye on Sammy and try to help in case demons, angels or horsemen strike somewhere where we aren't to help." Dean said.
"Yeah and uh... who is that?" Tony asked and pointed at the third guy who just stood there, staring at the others.
T‘challa nodded and gave Tony the glove. Tony took off again and then flew as fast as he could over to Castiel.
After several minutes, John's phone started to ring. At first Dean ignored it, but then it rang again and Dean took a look. On the screen it said "Castiel" and he picked it up, in case it was an emergency.
"Finished a job a few blocks away from here. Then heard something about a villain attacking, but when we checked it out, you guys already took care of it. Then I got hungry." Dean explained.
"SHIELD get's more and more curious when it comes to the supernatural and recently Clint and I were on a mission where we met someone." Natasha explained.
"Yes. He... is a dick to be honest. He destroyed all the other worlds. There were millions of others and- and all were simliar and yet different. All of you existed in my world as well, but your lives there were different. A part of God didn't agree and saved me, before God could kill me... damn this sounds stupid... Anyway, he send me here and- yeah." Dean explained quickly, without looking at any of them.
"Just leave it to us for know. If we need your hunter-advice, then we will come back at you." Tony said. He, Steve, Bruce, Thor, Clint and Natasha walked in and joined the others.
"For always being there for me, for taking care of me. I know you tried to hide a lot of things, like the stealing and that you got hit by our foster parents but, I am not stupid. I keep an eye on you like you on me and I am sorry that-"
"I wonder how much Hydra knows about the supernatural. If they work with demons or something, then that will cause a lot of trouble."Sam said.
"Stop!" Bucky pleaded, but Lilith only laughed as Dean screamed, as the hellhound scratched him open and blood pured out of his body.
"Sir, Sam Winchester is calling." FRIDAY said and Tony immediately put down his laptop. He, Bruce, Natasha and Pepper were currently in the living room, while the others were on a mission.
"Some sort of afterlife. Not heaven or hell, but Chuck killed me with his weird light-thingie. And you are all here, so I'm definitly dead."
"You don't have to decide now. We will tell a few others, because sooner or later one of us won't be able to hold that secret any longer." John said, glaring at Sam.
"Well, whoever you will save next time, they will be grateful." Bucky said and sat down next to them.
"The life of a hunter is not easy, but I won't hit the bucket that early." Dean grinned. Then he turned back to Sam. "By the way, Bobby says 'hi'."
"Thank you. For everything. I hope you find your happiness." Castiel smiled at Dean and then little Jack and the twins ran towards him and hugged him.
"Sorry, but it's been a while since I was in a burning building, so you must confuse me with someone else."
"Of course not. Dean is the last person to deserve that, but if you make a deal with a demon, then it'll just be an endless cycle of you two idiots sacrificing yourselves for each other." Tony said.
"Don't apolagize. Let's just enjoy life as long as we can." They kissed again and smiled at each other.
"We are not scared just... careful." Sam tried to explain. Eileen looked at him with worry and Sam just told them that people should stay inside for now, because of a coming storm.
"Doesn't matter." Bucky said. And punched her. She stumbled back, but then she hits Bucky over and over and he too couldn't overpower her.
The next few days were pretty similar. Dean helped John and Bobby out with the cars and spend some time with Sam and sometimes even Castiel and Jack.
Dean nodded and they went downstairs. Bucky stood ready at the elevator and Steve walked up to them.
Dean blinked and realized he was back. He gave Tony the cassette tape. "It worked. It fucking worked Tony.“ Everyone smiled.
Paramedics immediately swarmed him and the kids and he realized that they took the kids and brought them to an ambulance. Someone put a blanket over Dean's shoulders and guided him to another one, as he coughed because of the smoke he inhaled.
"Can someone please just tell me what is going on?" The resurrected Dean asked once more and the others laughed slightly.
Dean sat on the bed in the otherwise empty room. Only a small table stood next to the bed and on top of it was a dusted old picture and his necklace. He put the necklace on and then looked at the picture. It was John with a young Sam and Dean. Dean had it in his pocket when he died and Sam probably wanted to keep it somewhere safe.
Rob continued. "I grabbed that version of Jack, that God had created in his mind and gave him my powers as well. I am just an empty shell and I will soon vanish completely and become one with Jack. He immediatly knew what was going on and so we got here to bring an end to this."
"Yes. We have to find dad. And the Avengers will never let us stay here for longer. They have more important things to do then looking after two troublesome kids."
They heard John saying: "Dean. Something is starting to happen. I think it's serious. I need to try to find out what's going on... Be very careful, Dean. We're all in danger."
Castiel hesitated, but then cleared his throat. "Well... I am Castiel. I have a twin brother, Jimmy, or James Novak. He lives in Illinois with his family. I am a history teacher at a high school in the next town and... and... I- I was married to our Dean from this world." Castiel looked at him and Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise.
"I would prefere alcohol." Bobby muttured as he and John sat back down on the couch. Sam went over to them as well. Castiel still stood there and looked over to Dean who was still standing in the corner, his body shaking.
"You have no one left, Dean. All your friends, Castiel, Jack and now your dear brother Sam. This is how it is. No humans, no angels, no demons. No heaven and no hell. Just an empty planet and you and me."
"You aren't, but I grew up with them. Iron Man and Bucky basically raised me and my brother for a while."
"Then why not get out. You said you and Sam hunted for years. Couldn't you have just... stopped?" Castiel asked.
John showed him the backyard, where an old GMC truck was parked, as well as an 67' Ford Mustang. Dean remembered him from when they where in the alternate universe where Balthazar had saved the Titanic.
"And go." Natasha said and Thor instantly brought down his fist. Dean was thankfully fast enough and managed to dodge it. He moved behind Thor and kicked him in the legs.
"We found information about some experimentation with Hydra and came to investigate. Then we heard a woman screaming and found this house." Tony explained.
It was Friday and Dean had picked Jack up from school again. Castiel had to work a bit longer and Dean had nothing to do. He was happy to spend some time with the kid. Jack was a smart boy and Dean felt strangely overprotective of him. Maybe because he wasn't able to help the Jack from his world. Jack also warmed up to Dean. He saw Dean like an uncle who just happened to look and sound like his dead father.
"What about my wife?!" Suddenly a man screamed at the medics as he held his baby daughter and hugged his son.
"A week after you left?! Stark phones are nearly indestructible. What did you do?!" Tony was shocked.
„Well first of all, we don‘t even know if Lilith actually holds my deal. Second, even if we get to her, we have no way to gank her. And third, isn‘t this the same Lilith that wants your head? Should I continue?“
"I want to do this and you know it. You know my life, the things I‘ve done... It- It has to be like this. I said we will do it, no matter the cost. You and Bucky will spend time in that damn house that you build. It would be too big for Bucky alone.“
Sam nodded. "Yeah, you are right. My brother may be a jerk, but he is too cool to die. Thanks guys." Sam immediately felt better.
"I'll let FRIDAY look right now." Tony said and went to his laptop to hack some surveillance cameras.
Dean opened his eyes. He stood outside, in front of the bunker. He looked to his side and saw Jack, or God standing there.
"Shit, what are those?!" Iron Man asked, as some angry, hungry and crazy looking people came running towards them.
They heard screams from outside and Dean tighened his grip on the gun. "Nobody leaves the house and stay inside the salt." He said and went outside.
"We would like it if you and Sam stayed here for a while... At least for now, until we figured everything out. It's not good to jump right back into action."
"So, you got homework?" Dean asked, as he looked around the house. It was really open, with a lot of light. There were huge windows in the back and mostly everything was made out of wood or metal. On the walls were several pictures. Mostly of Jack, but also a few of Cas, Dean and the rest of the family. Further in the back, was a fireplace and Dean saw a picture of himself... the Dean from this universe. He was smiling in the picture and there was a necklace lying next to the frame. The same necklace that he wore for years.
The Avengers started to clean everything and the boys sat down on the couch, not knowing what to do.
"I don‘t have that much grace left, so try to keep yoru injuries to a minimum.“ Cas said and Dean rolled his eyes.
Dean nodded and turned to Castiel again. "Do you know people by the names of Lucifer, Michael, Raphael or Gabriel?"
Castiel sighed. "They wanted Lucifer to get free so that a war brakes out. The humans on this earth would have died, but the angels would win the war and then a new paradise would arise."
"Well, thanks for everything. Come on Sammy." Dean grabbed his brother and walked towards the elevator.
"No, you all died. I was the last one standing. It was only Chuck and me. He said there would be no heaven and no hell, so where the fuck am I?!" Dean grew more and more impatient.
Multiple heroes and soldiers from Wakanda came over and looked at him and his wings like he was some kind of god. Of course, most did not know about angels and demons.
"I did, but please don't do that again." Jack looked disgusted, as if he was forced to eat vegetables.
"Alright, let's go. Tony is about to convince them to leave us alone, so let's go to the car and get the hell out of here."
"I get it, alright. Just... Just take care of yourself." Dean packed all his things and grabbed the bag.
Now they were both in Castiel's home again and played a board game in the kitchen. Miracle laid next to the table and after an hour, they heard a key in the front door.
"No... no no no. He is not- he can not be-“ Sam started to shake and Bucky, who also looked shocked and close to tears took Sam into his arms.
"Azazel was his name. Ugly asshole... Anyway, he wanted to feed Sam demon blood. It's a bit much to explain, but-... he wanted to release Lucifer and needed a strong child with demon blood in him. Mary came into Sam's room and Azazel attacked her. He pinned her to the ceiling and set her on fire."
Soon Dean laid on the bed in the small guest room and stared at the ceiling. He knew that he wouldn't be able to get much sleep, but he tried to get at least some rest. His body still hurt from Chuck's attacks and his heart was still broken because he lost his best friend and his little brother recently. He thought about how he failed them and how he should have done things different. Maybe if he never showed up at Sam's apartment, then God wouldn't have gotten involved. Maybe Lucifer and Michael wouldn't have been present in their story and then maybe his world and countless other universes would still exist...
"Before I got to Bobby's. I found an old gas station. I drank some water and then suddenly I heard the sound and the glass in the windows shattered." Dean had stopped eating and just glared at his food.
"You never had it easy Dean. It is impressive what you do for him and I understand that you don’t trust us, but… try to live here with us for a few days and maybe it works out just fine for you. Tony wasn’t lying. We have enough space, you could go to school and you would never be hungry again."
Bucky was about to walk over to them, when suddenly he felt a hand on his soulder. He looked over and Dean was there.
"We fought against Chuck. Sam and I... And then Sammy..." Dean looked down, trying to hold back his tears. Sam's next question made him look up at them again.
When they all were inside, the girls jumped onto the couch, while Jack continued to stay close to Castiel.
"It's alright Tony. We will figure this out... I don't know how, but I will make every damn demon deal if I have to. We will find a way and-"
"Well, I should see if Cas found something..." Dean said and then Eileen walked in from the kitchen. She smiled at him and the girls ran outside, to play in the garden, while the adults walked towards the driveway.
They looked confused, but he looked friendly and there were no more monsters around, so maybe it was truly over.
"Yeah, most of the time we drove from one town to another. Sam and I had fake credit cards, fake IDs and fake FBI badges. We mainly ate fast food, though after some years of hunting, we found an old bunker. It was demon proof and became our home. Cas, Jack, Kevin, Charlie, Eileen and a few others stayed there with us for some time. There we managed to eat a bit more... healthy... I guess." Dean said and put some pancakes onto his plate.
"No sign of struggle. No footprints. No fingerprints. It's spotless. It's almost too clean." A police officer said.
"This isn't just about saving you, Dean." Bucky said and looked at him sadly. "This is about saving everybody."
"We can drive you boys home." Bobby said to Sam and Castiel who both nodded. They were both too tired to drive anyway.
"Thor, is there anything you know that could have done it?" Steve asked him, but Thor shook his head.
"I'm sorry, Dean. I wouldn't whish this upon my worst enemy." Ruby said and then they heard hellhound howling and growling. Dean looked to his right and Sam and Bucky looked at him confused.
"Okay, so god, angels, this and that. But again, why did you bring Dean back? What does 'God' want? I mean don't get me wrong, we're all happy about it, but...?" Tony asked.
Then the other 'me' lived here with you guys, but then God realized that this world still existed, brought monsters and demons here and wanted everyone to die and create a new world, but Rob traveled through time and space to bring back Jack from the other 'me's' universe, where he was really powerful and became a God himself. He took God's powers, brought me and the other 'me's' universe back, turned back the time in this world to the time before I died, so everyone thinks that nothing happened and became the new God but he leaves us all alone in order to not get involved with our lives."
"I'll heat it up." Dean walked into the kitchen and prepared the food. He and Jack ate something, and then sat down on the couch and watched TV.
"Ha, good. But not enough to defeat me." Thor turned around, grabbed him by the shoulder and held him up. He was confused though when Dean just grinned at him.
"You just want to watch it now, because you want to be prepared to fight against the ghosts." Natasha stated.
"Yes, of course you are. Mom, dad, Bobby, Ellen. All of them died some time ago. Then you were taken by the Empty and only Sam and I were left. But Chuck- that son of a bitch was too strong. We tried Cas... we tried, but he was too powerful. Sammy died and then he killed me." Dean said and he sounded so extremely tired.
"Oh come on. I‘ve been through worse. Just tell Sam and Cas that I love them when you guys bring them back. Sam deserves a normal life. Jess as his wife, kids, a house... I always dragged him down with me. I ruined his future... But not anymore. And Cas... tell Cas I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him, would you? He- he has to let me go after all this is over...“ Dean said. "And tell Bucky to cut his hair from time to time, otherwise he would look like Sammy. And please, PLEASE don‘t feel bad about this. You and Bucky... I owe you everything and I am honored to die for all of you guys.“ He laid his arm on Tony‘s shoulder and squeezed it slightly. Tony looked up at him. He was crying and trying to say something.
"Sammy.“ Dean and Sam went to each other and hugged as well. "Don‘t ever do that again, you hear me.“ Dean said and Sam chuckled.
Dean hugged him back and let one single tear roll down his cheek. He then turned away, went to the edge of the cliff and leaned forward. He closed his eyes as he felt gravity pulling on him. There was pain for a second, but then nothing...
"Yeah... His true voice can easily deafen someone and his true appearance can blind you... or something." Dean explained.
Then the man started to shoot them, but Dean knew that that wouldn’t do anything. Only his bullets, made out of silver could kill them and so he sprang into action and killed one werewolf after another. He saw that the other man was confused, as to why his bullets weren’t working, but he stepped close to Dean, ready to punch any werewolf that came from behind and could attack Dean.
"Yep. They ran into us and wanted to bring us to the police again, but we convinced them not to. Tony Stark has an AI. He tried to look for you for us, but it's like you don't exist. I was scared that you actually died."
"Sorry, buddy. I can't go out with you." Miracle laid back down again next to Dean and he sighed. It would be good if they told all the others, because then he could go out again, though what would he do...? There are no monsters to hunt. Dean thought back at his relationship with Lisa. After Sam's 'death' he tried to live a normal life, but he jumped at every sound he heard and instinctively tried to grab a knife or a gun. It would take some time to get used to the peace and quiet again.
"Wait, wait wait. If angels exist, shouldn't they... protect people...?" Clint asked and everyone looked at Castiel.
"Thanks man. Just try not to hit my arm and I'm good" Dean muttered, feeling extremely small now that he stood directly in front of the north god. But if he could fight with this guy, then that would mean that he could protect Sammy even when he was hurt, so Dean saw this as a chance to see if he was strong enough. Most of the time he fought bigger opponents, but then he had knives, salt, guns and holy water to defend himself. Now he only had his fists, but that was kind of what he wanted. He got hurt so many times by other people just because he wasn’t strong enough when it came to hand-to-hand combat. He had to become better.
"No no no. Monsters? Yes. Hell? Yeah, okay. But there is no way that angels exist... right?" Tony became frustrated and Dean turned to Cas.
"Well if he finds out by accident, then the whole world will know about it within seconds. Though he is still on vacation. He will return in two weeks and we will tell him then." Mary said.
Sam sighed. "Three days ago, Bobby and Ellen found someone on the side of a road not far from here and brought him over. That someone looks exactly like Dean WInchester."
"Hello Dean, hello Sam. I am JARVIS an AI created by Tony Stark. I run this tower and inform the avengers about everything that is going on in here or in the world."
"By Monday. Right. The interview. Yeah. I forgot." Dean said. "You're really serious about this, aren't you? You think you're just gonna become some lawyer? Marry a girl?"
Dean just shrugged. "Fine. Just not sure what to do now... What if the psychic has no answer? Going back to hunting? Staying here?... I just don't know" Dean sighed.
"You don't have to be a hunter for the rest of your life Dean. There are hundreds of other ways for you to choose."
"Yeah, becaus he has soooo much experience when it comes to women. He was about to drag her to a one star hotel, with two single beds! That's not how it works."
"Yes, and that's right. We had a case like this about a mile up the road. There have been others before that."
"We will get through this." Sam said and everyone smiled at Dean. Even Miracle seemed to be happier now again.
"Dean, you were a firefighter. You were in burning buildings all the time." Sam said and Dean looked at him as if he grew a second head.
"Any connection between the victims, besides that they're all men?" Dean asked, as he looked around.
Dean's instinct took over and he ran as fast as he could towards the screams. Castiel grabbed Jack's hand and ran after him, as fast as Jack could and Miracle followed them.
"She is the best." Dean agreed and looked proud. He opened the trunk and the others were shocked by what they found.
Bobby shrugged. "We went through everything. Silver, salt, holy water... If this is not Dean, then this is some kind of magic."
Tony nodded. "Thanos, the big bad purple guy took the infinity stones and snapped half of the universe away. You two vanished right in front of...“ Tony stopped talking.
"There! There is the Hulk and the Winter Soldier!" Someone yelled and many people came running towards them.
"Steve. We may have found something. Come to our location." Tony said and after that they separated.
"I asked JARVIS, but a female JARVIS answered. I told her who I was and asked to not tell you guys. She did a scan and let me in." Dean shrugged.
'What is this...?' he thought and kept walking. He heard some voices, but his head hurt too much to focus on them. He slowly opened the door and his eyes widened at what he saw...
"That you are." Sam smiled. "Dad said that you were a great help... Even though he doesn't want to admit it, he is getting older."
"The worst part was that I spend so much time in hell and I still remember everything. All the blood, all the pain, all the screams..." Dean was shaking now and without realizing, they had stopped walking and just stood in the forest with the dogs running around them.
"It's complicated, but it was because those stupid demons and- well... anyway, there was a way to bring him back." Dean struggled with the words. It was clearly uncomfortable for him to talk about it. "There was a way to sell your own soul to save someone else."
"But the general public doesn’t know about this. If these monsters exist, then how come that no one knows about them?" Bruce asked.
Then he slowed the message down and ran it through a Goldwave and he played it again. A female voice said: "I can never go home." After that everyone looked at Dean.
As Castiel was about to scatter some on the kitchen window, he suddenly stopped. From there he had a clear view of the street and he saw a car ramming into a tree. The driver stumbled out and then he suddenly... changed. Castiel couldn't hear him, but he was sure that the man was screaming in agony, as he bend over. Another guy walked up to him, probably trying to make sure that he was alright, when suddenly the driver attacked the man and... bit him.
"Yeah, I'm just glad that I was barely conscious during the flight. I thankfully don't remember being on that death trap." Dean mumbled and looked sick just by thinking about it.
"It's alright Dean. Don't worry about it. I should have known that you would be jumpy and it's good that your first instinct was to protect Sam. Just know that we would never harm you and that we only want what's best for the both of you."
Lucifer laughed. "You know Sam, I wanted to meet you. You should just say yes and all of this will be over. You will have a great life, believe me. We just have to work together and we can make this world a better place."
"When you found this place, I knew that I could not defeat you in a fight. But I also knew that you would focus on this world and totally ignore me... again. Because of that, I was able to travel through time and space. I looked for a scenario, where Jack was powerful enough to take away your power."
"Yeah. We could use this. There seem to be information in it about the supernatural that even dad didn’t know about."
Dean nodded. "Alright. I will stay, for now. Just until everything makes more sense." Dean sat down again and rubbed his temple.
"Nothing we can do now. Let's just hope that the next time we see or hear from them that it'll be happier." Bruce said and all of them hoped so.
"Federal marschals." Dean said and quickly showed his fake ID. "This is Bucky Barnes, also known as the Winter Solder. An Avenger."
"You look like you are still injured and after everything that he said, you should really sit down."
"He saved him and after that Dean fixed the Impala like a mad man and later picked Castiel up with the car to grab a coffee. After that they continued to get closer." John finished and picked up some tools.
"... okay, maybe I was a little bit annoyed that they spend so much time together. Doesn't mean I was jealous."
"Yes, Sam. You know that I'm not happy with this fancy life. I'm not smart, I‘m not a hero. I just want to help dad."
Bucky sighed in relief and helped him up, when suddenly Dean pushed him to the side. "Look out!" He raised his still slightly injured arm and was scratched by the skinwalker. Bucky pulled Dean's knife out of his pocket and stabbed the dog in the heart.
Dean saw sadness in Cas' deep blue ones and got lost for a moment. He remembered when the empty took him and he could only watch. He couldn't even process what Cas had said to him. Dean never wanted to admit it to himself, maybe it was because he thought that Cas would never love him that way, but Dean knew that there was something more. If only he had said something... Maybe things would have been different...
"Later, he woke up and we talked. Turns out, there were multiple universes out there, with parallel worlds. That Dean Winchester came from another one, one that is more dangerous than ours. He was brought here by some kind of God, because his own world had been destroyed."
The brothers talked to Bobby. According to someone called Bella, someone named Lilith could be the one who holds the contact. Bobby laid out a map on a large table in the Avengers tower and put a device on it. He spoke the Latin words and  they figured out that Lilith was in New Harmony, Indiana.
"They would have been proud of you as well, Dean. What you did... It's just- I couldn't ask for a better older brother." Sam smiled at Dean and Dean rolled his eyes.
Dean heard about some weird killings in a small town and went to investigate. Turned out it was just some shapeshifters and he quickly took care of them. As he walked through town, he saw huge monuments in a park. He walked over and saw that they had all the names of the dusted one on it.
"She wants you to give in to this whole demonic, psychic whatever okay? She wants you to become  her little Antichrist superstar."
The whole drive to the tower was in complete silence and Dean became more and more nervous. They were literally in the car of a stranger. Exactly doing, what no one should do. But he was tired. Tired of running away, tired of fighting against monsters, tired of looking after Sammy… He was only 15 for fucks sake. He was allowed to make mistakes. If this turns out to be one, he has his gun ready to defend himself and save Sam.
"Dean, even if you are not... not my son, at least not really, you are still a part of this family. No matter in what universe we are." Mary said and smiled slightly at him.
"I can not believe you got it." Sam said, as he looked at the forth ring. Dean put all four rings on the table.
"Tonight. He said I should just check her for oil and bulge out a bump. He also said to leave the trunk closed, so don't mess with it. Now come on. You got work to do."
They got into the elevator and Dean got more nervous by the second. Bucky realized that, but decided to keep it to himself. Of course these kids would be scared. They were in the home of a complete stranger and Bucky could only guess what Dean had meant, when he said that they ran away from the foster home because it wasn’t good.
"They also live around here. They were good friends of our Dean, so they deserve to know." John explained.
He dreamed of how he himself killed Sam, Cas and Jack over and over again, until he was covered in their blood. He felt sick just by thinking about it and so he got up, walked into the bathroom and took a long hot shower, until he felt better.
"Don’t worry. Some of them are really old anyway and Tony can buy all books again if he wanted to." Steve said and Sam smiled again and continued reading.
"Just call me Pepper. I hope you two have a great time here." The boys nodded and Dean turned back to Tony.
"Still, if I- if my other version wouldn't have started to hunt, then you and Sam could have had a normal life." John said and glanced over, but Dean shook his head.
Dean's mind went wild over all the possibilities and he wondered, if he could really trust this other version of God who called himself Rob. After lying there for hours, he finally became more and more tired and soon drifted off into sleep...
"Well, he was pretending to play god or something. I believe that alone leads to a dark path.“ Steve said.
"Take it Sam. You still have the phone from Stark, so call me if something is wrong. Use these if you have to."
"Exactly. You were a kid. WE should have tried to help you more. We should have convinced you to stay."
"You should have gotten rid of the body. Now the police could come and ask questions." One of the men said.
Tony nodded, but Bucky stepped up. "But if we find out that he is not able to take proper care of you, then we can not let you stay with him."
"Yes. And tell the others to get down there." Tony said. He dropped everything he was currently working on in his lab. On his way down he bumped into Bucky, Steve amd Natasha. When they reached the garage, the others were already waiting there and the Impala just came to a stop.
"Well, you all disappointed me. There is no hope for you, so I thought of a new... structure." God started to explain. "You see, I will create a new universe. Only one. Last time, I made too many. Like I said a new start. The people in that universe will have a similar community, but there will be no monsters. No. When they do something that I don't like, they will be send here. As punishment."
The father of the little girl came from behind, but Bucky quickly covered his mouth. "Shhh. We're here to help, okay?" The guy nodded and Bucky let go of him.
"That was just the old window, Dean. Calm down. Since when are you so scared in old hunted houses?" Bucky asked annoyed.
Tony and Bucky turned around and saw that the door to the cabin was open. Dean stood there with his gun in his hand and shot one werewolf after another.
"And stressful. I mean you guys basically lived on the streets for some time." Sam said but Dean just shrugged.
The girl woke and screamed as she saw Sam with the knife. Sam was about to stab her, but Dean stopped him.
"No... We should hide and wait for someone to come." Dean looked around and upstairs was a great hiding spot.
"Guys, hey." Bucky said and gestured over to the houses, where more demons stood and looked at them.
Dean shrugged. "Well I was electrocuted and only had a few days left because of the heart attack..."
There was nothing Sam or Bucky could do. Only watch as Dean screamed in agony, as the hellhound kept tearing his body apart.
"What if everything works, huh? We have a chance, Tony. A good chance. You did an amazing job in building the time machine and it fucking works."
"Good. Also, we are so close to getting to those damn vampires. Their leader often deals with demons, so maybe we have a chance to get a lead on the yellow eyed..."
"I can not bring everyone back. Otherwise too much would be different, but those who died for you and Sam, those who fought for the world, I saved them."
They walked over to the garage to get to the Impala. Bucky had informed FRIDAY about Ruby and to let the Avengers know she is there, in case that they returned earlier.
"You are no fun." Lucifer groaned and then looked over to Castiel. "Really, Castiel? I never thought that you, the perfect little soldier, would help these weaklings. What will dad think of you, mhm?"
"Alrighto. Your choice. Make yourself at home. If something is wrong, just tell JARVIS and he will get us."
"This, this will change everything." Jody said. "God, Multiple Universes...  That's incredible... and scary."
Dean nodded and they went back to the car. After Bucky had called SHIELD, he turned his attention back to Dean.
The next week Dean worked as much as he could at the garage, helping Travis, as he learned the man's name was. Dean and Bucky told the other Avengers that he didn't want to go to school. At first they were disappointed in Dean, but they also understood why. They agreed that he could still go to work and would get some homeschooling. So everytime Sam did his homework, Dean would read about some basic knowledge. Sam on the other hand loved going to school. The teachers were really impressed with him and already motivated him to keep it up in order to go to college one day. The Avengers also learned more from Sam and Dean about the supernatural.
"Nah, don't mention it. Just don't get into trouble. If ya need help with yer old man, just tell me. He ain't looking all that nice." Travis said and left.
Dean took several steps foreward, but knew that he would never be able to catch up. Was he hallucinating? There is no way that their dad was here. Probably just another guy with a great taste in cars.
„Come on, man, she is the Miss Universe of lying skanks, okay? She told you that she could save me, huh? Lie. She seems to know everything about Lilith but forgot to mention, oh right! Lilith owns my soul!“ Dean was pissed, but Sam didn‘t give up.
"It's a long story..." Castiel muttered. Jack, the new God, turned to Dean again. "We should go. Your world is waiting." Dean nodded and looked back at the others. "Thank you guys. Thanks for everything."
"Ugh not again..." Bucky was annoyed while Dean and Sam were just confused, so Pepper explained it to them.
"I am not letting you two leave until you had a decent meal." Tony said and Dean and Sam turned around to see him and Bucky standing in the entrance.
"...Thanks..." Sam went to the table and grabbed the book about the supernatural that they had found in Tony's library. He handed it to Dean. "You might need this I made some notes. Maybe it'll help you on some hunts."
"Tony!" Sam said and took out his gun. He aimed it at the other man and shot. There was a huge hole in the guys chest, but the rotten skin just reformed itself and closed the hole.
"... I tried to bring you back for months! I read every book there is, I tried every god damn ritual and I prayed every day that you will come back. Now you are here and I will not just let you leave again."
"We should go, young warrior! See how strong you are!" Thor said excitedly, but Dean shook his head.
"In my world only a few monsters started to appear from time to time. Sometimes there were only two killings in one months in a state. It sometimes takes a while before someone fully turns into a monster. Now... the monsters are popping up everywhere randomly, with no explanation."
"What is happening?" Kevin asked. "People attacked other people suddenly and some didn't... they looked like monsters!"
"Who is that?" Asked Wanda, as she, Vision and Falcon came into the room and stood next to the other Avengers.
Jack smiled again and then looked at all of them, even the kids. "I have to thank you as well. All of you took care of Dean. All of you are peaceful people and the reason why I see something good here and want to protect this world."
Now only Tony, Bucky, Natasha, Bruce, Thor, Clint, Steve, Sam and Dean were left. They currently sat outside on some debris. They all had a beer and Dean and Tony were currently trying to repair the Impala, because some rubble had fallen onto Dean‘s baby when Thanos had attacked.
"Great! Since it’s Friday, I can call a school close by and ask if guys could come next week for a few hours and see how it goes." Tony said.
"Sorry, this must be a lot for you. From what the other guy said, your world must have been completely different." Castiel said.
After a few minutes, Tony's car arrived and Dean and Sam put their bags into the trunk. Afterwards they sat down in the backseats, while Bucky sat shotgun and Tony drove them towards the city.
"AAAAAHHH!!" Dean screamed and Sam took out his gun and shot the guy who stabbed his brother. Sadly the other guy reacted quickly and held a knife against Dean's throat while looking at Sam.
"I know you like them. I like them too, but it's too early to say if we can truly trust them. I don't think that they are bad people, but we should still be careful." Sam nodded and Dean continued. "Ask me again when the week is over. After you have been to school. Also it's not just our, but also their decision to make. If they don't want us anymore, then we have to leave."
"...Dean..." Bucky wasn't sure what to say, as he tried to hold his own tears back. "Dean, look, you held out for 30 years, that's longer then anyone would have." Dean cried slightly and tried to take deep breaths.
"We should worry about the future, not the past. We can not change it." Steve said and Dean began thinking.
"Great, that‘s what we are looking for. Where is it?“ Dean beamed. This was way easier then he thought.
Meanwhile Dean sang along to Kansas and Cas smiled at the man next to him. Finally everything was perfect.
Then the ghost suddenly appeared in front of them. She stared at them and then looked down at her own body.
"Stay safe. And if you ever need anything, just call me. I will be there in a heartbeat." Dean told him and hugged his little brother. Sam hugged him back and then they walked back downstairs.
John smiled slightly. "Both of them just being together, I guess. Dean was more happy and Castiel is a smart and reasonable man. Sometimes a bit old-fashioned and uptight, but overall a great guy. Also the fact that he saved my son's life had a plus point."
Castiel called Sam last night and told him what happened. He also mentioned that Dean looked worried and probably wanted to talk about something. So they wanted Eileen to keep the kids busy, so that the others could talk.
Steve threw his Captain America shield at the suit and Lucifer stopped and before he could continue, Wanda started to push him towards the hole with her magic. Vision helped her and used the mind stone to push him back with a beam of yellow light. Tony quickly activated his suit and also shot his lasers at him. Lucifer stumbled back and stood now right at the corner where the hole would suck him in. Thor and Hulk looked at each other and nodded. Hulk punched and Thor hit Lucifer with his hammer at the same time and Lucifer fell backwards into the darkness.
"Bitch!" Dean said, as he killed the last werewolf. He was tired, hungry and just wanted to go home. But because his little brother had to eat something, Dean went out to get (steal) some food from the gas station nearby. But of course he was oh so lucky that he ran into a bunch of werewolves on his way there.
"There are only a few hunters out there, but they are enough to kill them. A lot of people have already come in contact with ghosts and other creatures, but they know that no one would believe them and the FBI and police would have no idea what to do and would make a hunt just more complicated. It is not easy to live like this, because there is no payment. But it’s the right thing to do."
After a minute Bucky came out of the station and saw Dean standing further away from their car, staring straight ahead.
"He wouldn't wake up... B-But then he did and- and dad suddenly died... We think he made a deal with the demon. His life for Dean's. " Sam said.
"Yeah, whatever she did to her, it seems all right now. That Constance chick, what a bitch!"  Dean yelled.
"Exactly. He never really accepted the fact that Dean died. Now, he has the chance to realize, that his father is gone, but that there are still others who can be like family. He will see you and know that you lost your family as well. He will look at you and see that you continue to live, that you can still enjoy life."
Clint looked at them and wondered. "Do you know other hunters? You could have lived with them, instead on the streets."
"Remember, they have to be exactly where they were. You can not just drop them of in New York and then leave again.“
They left and looked for a hotel to stay in. Dean used one of his credit cards and the guy at the hotel mentioned a man that sounded a lot like John. They asked in what room the man stayed in and got inside. There were pictured on the walls and a salt circle around the door.
Tony, Bucky, Steve, Wanda, Vision and Thor repaired some of the damage in the tower, while Natasha, Clint and Bruce prepared some food for everyone. Bobby and Sam were upstairs with Dean, giving him some fresh clothes.
Bucky rolled his eyes and hit both of them on the head from behind, his metal hand hitting Dean. "Enough, both of you."
"It’s just… it’s been years Dean. Don’t you think he would have looked at the cabin if there was a slight change that we would be there?"
A huge man, flesh looking rotten and eyes white and deadly threw Bucky against the wall. Dean tried to shoot him, but the guy was extremely fast for his size and punched Dean in the jaw.
"Your world." Jack said to Dean. "But there he is just a human. No powers, no abilities. Just a guy who may seem a bit crazy to others."
"Thanks." Dean said, as he walked over. He looked into the bag and thankfully the Dean from this universe had the same style as him.
A few days later the two brothers sat on the couch  and drank some beer. Dean had multiple stitches and still some band aids on him, but overall he was fine. Sam also had enough time to relax and they were both becoming restless.
Dean woke up covered in sweat and he was breathing heavily. He looked at the clock in the room and saw that it was 7 am, which meant that he only slept for a few hours.
Natasha continued. "We talked to Coulson after the mission and mentioned you two. He said that SHIELD had their eyes on these things for a long time, but they always had problems to recruit hunters. And it wasn't easy to find out about killing these monsters, because there is a lot of bullshit on the internet and even a lot of books say the wrong things."
Dean looked at Bucky gratefully. Bruce sighed and took care of Dean's arm as good as he could and then bandaged it.
"We'll explain everything later. It's just great to have you back." Sam said and wiped away a tear. The other Dean stood there and smiled at them. "All the monsters are gone now and I will erase everyone's memories from the last week, accept yours, if you want." Jack told them and everyone nodded.
"For you, Dean. You deserve it. This world will be at peace again, thanks to you. You never gave up." Dean nodded slightly. "... thanks."
They watched in silence, while the Avengers cleaned everything up. Afterwards they all went to the boys and sat down opposite of them.
Scott told them everything. It was clear that Steve and Natasha also didn't understand much, but they seemed open to the idea.
"What the hell? I'm a hunter. Just like you guys. I mean yeah, I wanted to be a firefighter when I was a kid, but that was never an option. Though we once dressed up as firefighters and we dealt a lot of times with fire... especially with burning ceilings." Dean muttered the last part.
Castiel looked at the door with sad eyes. It was as if his dead husband just left him... again. He wanted to say something, but he did not know what. He asked Jack about his day in school  and tried to have a relaxing evening.
Tony and Bucky shook off the creatures and hurried inside. Dean followed quickly and closed the door behind him. He then grabbed a pack of salt and scattered it in front of the door.
"Well then,“ Dean grabbed a beer and handed it to Cas. "To you and your precious heart.“ Dean smiled and the others nodded.
"As soon as we hit the road, he is going to get injured anyway.." Sam said and drank more of his beer.
Dean just nodded slightly and then he reached under the bed and pulled out a bag. "Here. There is a gun, a silver knife, salt and some holy water."
Bucky raised his arm with his gun. "Get your brother. I'll shoot if an enemy comes and Tony will handle those guys. We will be fine."
John smiled too. "And I'm glad that you boys are fine. I was worried when you weren't home. I thought a monster got you. I looked everywhere for you."
Jack nodded and pointed ahead. Dean started the car and drove him home. The house was further outside of the town, just like John's and Mary's house. It looked a little bit like an old ranch house, with dark wood and a big porch up front. They even had a garden and a big garage for the cars.
It was silent for a while, until John cleared his throat. "I'm sorry." He said and Dean looked over to him surprised. "I- I know that it wasn't me, but it... it was still another version of me, John Winchester, who didn't give you a normal childhood. It must have been hard on you."
"There is nothing you have to apolagize for. We are just glad we could help." Mary said and then got up. "I'll get you a glass of water." She left before Dean could say anything and John also got up and leaned against the wall.
"Excuse me ma'am. My father here, ...Sebastian... was a friend of Charles. He wants to say he is really sorry about what happened... He is still in shock."
"Hey, saved your ass." Dean said. "I'll tell you another thing. If you screwed up my car... I'll kill you."
The people who witnessed the fight between the Avengers and Dr. Doom, slowly started to do their normal stuff again. For the people in New York it was nothing new that an evil villain attacked. But they always knew that the Avengers would take care of it.
"Dean!" Dean turned towards his friend. Castiel stood there with shock on his face. His hands started to disappear into dust as well.
After 30 minutes of flying they finally reached the Avengers tower and FRIDAY had alarmed Bruce and two medical doctors who often helped out the Avengers after missions. They put the now sleeping Dean on a stretcher and took care of him. Tony helped Bucky over to the couch and made him something to drink.
The next day John and Dean drove over to Bobby's place. John let Dean drive and it was probably the best thing that happened to Dean since he arrived here.
"We want to understand more of this and we want to help you, Dean. You may not be our Dean, but you are still part of this family." Sam said.
"But, is there really nothing we can do to help?" Wanda asked. She did not know Dean, but she had gotten along really well with Sam in the past.
„Dean-“ Bobby tried, but he was ignored. The Avengers also looked at each other, not knowing what to do.
John cleared his throat and stepped up. "The others will be here soon, maybe we should move this inside."
"Bucky!" Dean yelled and tried to attack again, but the huge man kicked him and punched him again. Dean stumbled to the ground, spitting out blood. "Son of a bitch..." He got up again, but as he looked at the huge guy, he suddenly felt a sting at his neck and then everything turned black...
"Steve, Nat and Wanda are here two but they went in the other direction to have a look." Bucky said.
"We only want to help." Tony added. They both had a bad feeling about this. No kid should live alone in the woods with monster-wolf-people running around.
Basically what happened after Dean met Cas. Sam teamed up with Ruby, drank demon blood and got more powerful and the angels wanted Dean to become Michael's vessel and all that stuff. Now they visit the Avengers...
"Sam? How are you?" Tony asked happily. They celebrated their victory with a huge meal and everyone was having a good time.
Later John got a call and had to drive to the next town to fix a car of a friend there. In his hurry, he forgot his phone there, without even realizing. Meanwhile Bobby had to go over to Ellen's place to help her out, so Dean was left alone on the junkyard.
"So, what the hell does a demon do for fun?" Bucky asked and the brothers had no idea, as they had the same question in mind.
He knows that Sam always loved going to school and that his brother would make it far. But he also wanted to look for their father and he wasn’t sure if he could trust them.
Sam tried to stab her, but she pushed him against the wall and he let go of the knife. Bucky tried to attack her, but she used her demon ability to kepp him against the wall as well. Then she used her powers to push Dean on the table.
Sam nodded and smiled slightly at Bucky. He turned and saw Dean keeping an eye on him from the distance. He and Bucky then went to him and together they met the others by the car.
Dean woke up and this time, where ever he was, it was dark. He slowly sat up, even though it cost him a lot of strength.
Dean looked at Bucky and he nodded. "Alright, then both of you can come." Sam was about to say something, but Dean interrupted him. "Come on Sammy. It's in you and you know it."
Dean ran from room to room, but realized that no one was downstairs, so he ran up the stairs to look there.
"I know, Sam. Just always keep your guard up. Don't want a random vampire biting you." Dean joked and Sam rolled his eyes.
Then they were brought into one of the worst homes. A business woman and her drunk husband. They had to be quiet all the time and were never allowed to interrupt them. When the husband came home from a bad day and was drunk, then he would yell at them and scream for more beer. The wife just locked herself into her room and pretended not to hear anything. There it was the neighbors that called the police and so they entered their fourth home. There it was only a woman who wanted to take care of them. First everything seemed nice and they thought that they finally found someone to live with. But no... it wasn't that easy. Turned out she was a vampire and tried to kill them later on. Dean managed to kill her and told the police that she just vanished and left them alone. The police was sceptical, but at this point, they were just frustrated with the boys. And then they brought them to their last home. An abusive woman and her equally abusive husband.
"It is not my fault that the Hulk doesn't agree with me on who the strongest Avenger is." Thor said.
There stood a young woman who was covered in blood. She just looked at them and then screamed. Then she was gone again.
Tony and Bucky nodded and Dean opened the door, letting the beasts in. All three of them shot at the monsters and after a few minutes of nonstop shooting, everything was quiet.
"Well, even though it's 2 am, I will prepare some coffe and tea and then we will discuss this." Mary said.
Everyone looked around. Castiels time travel worked different then the one Tony invented and therefore they could be back any second.
"Jack is alright, as most of me is him. And don't feel sorry. I am happy and you will be too. Actually, I have to thank you. Without you, everything would have been lost. You saved everyone."
"I'll kill you, you son of a bitch." Ruby said and tried to get to him, but was stopped by an invincible wall. She looked up and there was a demon trap painted on the ceiling.
"Well if Sam had his earpiece in, then he could hear us and we could give him advise, but apparently he forgot it."
"He had to drive over to a friend who has a busted tire and he forgot his phone. And before you ask, Bobby is helping Ellen right now, so how can I help?"
"Benny was Dean's colleague. They were partners and he was there when our Dean died." Then Sam started to grin and looked over to Castiel. "Cas was always jealous."
"He just- I don't know, man. He is not here. I looked everywhere. There is no note, no... no nothing. Bobby doesn't know where he is either and I thought that maybe you guys would know?" Dean asked hopefully.
"You are my brother Dean, but this is more of a home to  me then all the crappy hotel rooms. I finally made some friends and I have a great chance to go to college someday."
"What is it?" Dean asked concerned. They both feared that Jack would have problems to adjust. A lot happened and he and Sam's daughters still didn't understand all of it.
"Time there is different. He... he was tortured, Tony. Ripped appart and put together again just to be sliced into pieces again. He was offered a deal by a guy named Alastair. They wouldn't torture him anymore, if he would torture other souls..."
"Uhhh then you should come with us to the gym. You can even try out one of my bows." Clint siad excited.
"No, I have read enough for now. Come on, before Thor is too tired to take you on. Sam smiled and Dean grinned.
They all sat at the table, with Dean sitting between Castiel and Sam and Miracle laid under the table, on Dean's feet.
"Actually... I don't know exactly why us, but Sammy and I are 'special' or something. We have a certain bloodline in us that allows Lucifer and Michael to take over our bodies, without our bodies... exploding. Great right."
Bucky glared at Tony, who just grinned back at him. "What? Some people do that, you know. All alone in the forest at night… ah so romantic."
"I- yes. They are all friends and collegues of mine. I actually grew up with them and Gabriel is like a brother to me. How do you-... I mean... who were they in your world?"
"It was four months up here, but down there... I don't know, time is different. It was more like 40 years."
"We could trap and weaken him with holy oil and an angels depowering sigil, but we would still have to get him in there and then into the cage." Castiel explained.
"He's right, Sammy. We did it. Ruby, Lilith, Lucifer. They are all gone now. And... I know it doesn't mean much, but- but mum and dad would've been proud of you." Dean said.
Chuck sighed. "Really Dean?" Chuck snapped his finger and Dean was pushed back again. He hit the ground, but got up again. Chuck snapped again and Dean started to bleed.
"We fight against supervillains and aliens all the time. We are busy and we would never have a 'normal' life."
"Well... this is a lot to take in and I'll probably ask more questions tomorrow, but for now I have to keep working, even though I believe I won't be able to concentrate on it..." Jody said and got up. "Don't cause any trouble." She said to Dean and then turned to John and Sam. "That goes for all Winchesters." She narrowed her eyes and the men nodded nervously.
"Well, we walked for two hours and found nothing. Let's turn around. Maybe the others had more luck."
"We don't- I'm not sure if it would work." Bucky looked over to Tony who was completely frustrated know, because Steve didn't understand something that he and Bruce tried to explain to him.
"Well we are not leaving you, unless your parents come home and explain, why they left two little kids alone in the forest with these creatures around." Tony said.
That was enough for Bucky and he came to help the boys. Ruby kicked Sam away and then was attacked from behind by Bucky.
Dean nodded. "You- the other Cas actually dragged me out of hell, but that is a different story. In the beginning, Cas helped us and we helped him, but after time he became close to us. He became family. He- Cas was my best friend... We were a team. Cas, Sam, Jack and I. Jack was... well again, complicated. But he was family too. We- we fought against monsters, demons and in the end even against God. But that son of a bitch just... I don't know... Everything just went wrong. We lost everyone. So many friends died..." Dean had tears in his eyes and the others looked like they wanted to hug him.
"Dean probably went ahead and Bucky had to follow him." Sam explained. He looked around and looked at the dead bodies. He stopped at one of them and looked closer.
"I swear, if Sammy doesn’t treat you right, then I’ll come back and haunt his ass." Dean smiled and leaned against his baby.
"Bucky had told us what happened. We are glad that you two are alright and thankful that you helped him and Tony." Steve stated.
Bucky turned on a flashlight and Tony activated his Iron Man suit. They carefully walked inside. It was quiet.
He ran to the Impala and drove back to the bunker where they stayed most of the time now when they weren't visiting the Avengers.
"Look, I am not a kid anymore. I can take care of Sammy and you guys are busy with other stuff, so before we get too comfortable here, I’d rather we leave now."
The rest of the week was similar. Sam went to school while Dean worked at the garage. Only Bucky knew about it and he kept it to himself and Dean was grateful for that.
It was dark now and Dean was outside, beer in his hand and leaning against the Impala, looking up at the sky. He heard footsteps and turned around to see Tony standing there.
"Yeah... should have known that he would give him beer instead of water..." Dean muttered and remembered a few years back, when Bobby looked after Miracle because Sam and Dean were on a hunt.
Tony turned to Steve and Bruce, Wanda and Vision left and Castiel listened to Thor who told him a story from his childhood.
"I know it's a lot. But it's the truth. God thinks you are dead, just like everything else and like I said, he is too arrogant and sure of himself that he won't look for a possible universe that could still excist."
"Wait!" The man yelled, but Dean had already vanished between the trees and finally the man gave up.
"You better. If anything happens to my little brother, then I will kill you." Dean said in a deadly voice and Steve nodded.
"Huh. She used to live there, but a few years ago, she, her husband Sean and their son Owen moved here." John explained.
"Are you sure?" Steve asked, as Thor, Natasha, Clint and Wanda already started to prepare for the mission.
"Yeah yeah." Dean said and closed his eyes for a second. He groaned, knowing that he should not sleep yet and got up again. He grabbed all the guns laying in the house and took all the bullets.
"Thanks Jack or Rob or God, or whatever... Thanks for everything. And I am sorry." Dean looked at him with a sad look.
"Here." Castiel gave Dean a glass of water and Dean gladly drank all of it. They sat on the couch, while Jack was on the ground, petting Miracle. The boy was still scared but tried to be brave.
Dean could see the creature. The hellhound was huge, black and just looked terrifying. He barked and they started to run. They ran into the next room and closed the doors. Bucky and Sam trying to hold it closed, while Dean scattered some dust to keep them out.
Dean gave Steve the four rings, to keep an eye on them. He figured it would be too dangerous, because he would always deal with demons and angels. It would be safer if the Avengers hid them somewhere where no one would look for them.
"We used to live in another house, here in Lawrence, but... the house burned down when you- when Sam and our Dean were younger. We moved to a more quiet area, so there aren't many neighbors around." John added.
Bucky sighed. After walking through the corridor, they reached an open area with boxes. These boxes were filled with guns.
"Don't ask questions. My head hurts as it is. I don't need you guys screwing over my head even more." Dean said and so Castiel turned to the others.
"Yes." Castiel said. "There would be another way, but that would require to be in posession of all the 6 infinity stones. But they are currently scattered across the universe. It would take too long to get them all."
"Oh, so you could save him?" Bucky heard Sam say and he looked around the corner to see him talking to a blonde woman. Some painting and candle were lying next to them on the ground. Sam had summoned a demon...
"It is not. Maybe… maybe there is information about the yellow eyed demon! That could lead us to dad!" Dean said exited, but Sam’s smile faded.
He held the door open and Eileen walked in and when she saw Dean, she stopped in her tracks, eyes wide.
"Lawyer must be difficult. It's understandable that you took a break. And it's really nice of your brother to take you on a roadtrip." Jessica said and Sam nodded.
Bobby just nodded and then got up. "Come on. I'll drive. The sooner we figure out what Sam did, the better." Dean coudln't agree more and they drove off to New York.
"Dammit." Tony shot lasers at them, but they also didn’t do anything, as they just got up again after they fell down.
"These are creatures from my world. Demons, vampires, ghouls wendigos, werewolves... I- Rob said they don't exist in this world, but now they do. It has to be him."
"When I was four years old, when Sammy was just born, a demon killed our mother, Mary Winchester. H-He burned her. The rest of us got out of the house, but after that... John, our father became a hunter and tried to hunt down the demon who did it. From then on I learned about monsters. Supernatural beings and creatures that just want to kill you. Sam and I never had a normal childhood. We were always moving around, because our father got from one hunt to the next. We often stayed in crappy hotels and we learned to shoot guns and handle knives at a very young age. Later, Sam went to college." Dean looked at this version of his younger brother. "You- He... he never agreed with our father and wanted nothing to do with hunting. When we were in our mid twenties though, John vanished. He got problems on a hunt and I needed Sam's help to find him and save him. A lot of stuff happened and it's far too much to explain it all in one day, but... Sam and I hunted together. Our father died, but eventually we got our revenge, by killing the damn demon who destroyed our lives." Dean took another deep breath.
Bucky groaned but kept following Tony. A day earlier they found some clues about some illegal experimentation where Hydra was most likely involved in. Now Steve, Natasha, Bucky, Tony and Wanda investigated. They split up to cover more ground and Tony insisted that he and Bucky go together in one direction while the others went to the other direction.
"Look, ...Dean, I wish I had done it, alright? I tried everything. I tried to bargain, but no demon would deal."
"He was hunting and when we were gone, he looked everywhere for us." Dean explained, but he saw Sam's uncertain look. "Come on Sammy, it wasn't his fault that the cops got to us before he did."
