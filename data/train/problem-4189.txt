Dean glanced at Bobby, who had his ‘don’t ask me to make sense of angels’ face on. “Ok, I guess.” He agreed slowly, tamping down the urge to scream some sense into all of them.
Gabriel nodded. “Another of Lucy’s favorites. It’ll be a cashmere and wool blend. Those buttons aren’t standard, either. Not this season. Custom.” Dean snorted. Who the fuck had custom buttons? Well now he did, apparently.
Castiel stared at the phone, rolling it all over in his mind. Raphael was going to jail. A teenage boy. The boy who had tormented him, sent him to the hospital multiple times, humiliated Dean and harassed Jo. The cruel, hateful boy who had gotten away with so much and dragged Sam, Alfie, and so many others down with him.
“She’s always been a stick in the mud.” Balthazar murmured, scratching at his vessel’s stubbled cheeks. “But she’s right. Raphael isn’t going to back down. I think he may be a little crazy.”
When Dean finally made it home that night Sam and Cas were snuggled up in their separate armchairs watching Dirty Dancing. Cas looked perfectly content, as if today hadn’t even happened. Sammy-time had worked its magic. Sam looked happy too, in fact he was actually humming along to the theme song.
“So a clue. For whoever knows how to read them.” Dean guessed. Sam nodded. “And you think it opens all this?”
Cas’s nostril’s flared as his eyes went dead flat. A crackle of electricity raced over Dean’s skin but he didn’t back down. “I’m going with you, Cas. It’ll be easier on both of us if you just accept it. At least if you know where I am you can keep an eye on me, right?”
“A shield spell.” Gabriel explained. “Can’t access any of the information stored here if you don’t have the club card.”
He tried to keep it as short and simple as possible. “Kennedy is in the bathroom. I believe he is in the beginning stages of alcohol poisoning. I suggest you get him some medical attention.”
“You got a veggie pizza?” Sam felt his eyebrows crawl towards his hairline and caught another flush on Dean’s cheeks.
It was a tense, silent drive back to the Winchester abode, and Dean tried not to sneak to many glances at his irate passenger. Cas was even angrier than when Dean had found him on the roadside, too angry to even mutter to himself, apparently. The stony silence was even more unnerving, and Dean fought the desire to crack a stupid joke and break the tension.
Gabriel made a face but nodded. “Good. Go.” Cas hurried down the porch steps and Gabriel turned to Dean. “As much as I hate to say it, Sam does have a point here. We’ve got to be careful if we don’t want to tip our hand.”
“I am afraid that Alfie will let his fear get the better of him.” Cas pushed on, ignoring the subject of his own future for now. “He knows more material than he thinks he does, but he tends to panic when all he needs to do is think about the question for a moment.”
“No.” Ganem confirmed. “We were trying to make contact with an angel, to set up a path for her disposal, when she attacked us. We never managed it.”
Before Dean could figure out how to phrase “flattered, but no” into something that wouldn’t piss her off a new voice spoke up for him.
Amelia reached out one slender hand and jammed the thick book in, slamming the door for him. “Can we talk?”
“You little shit.” Raphael hissed, reaching for him. Castiel braced himself but before the blow could land someone else joined the fray.
“Right.” Dean shook his head. “I’ll put the order in. I think there’s a table back there.” He pointed to where Benny and Ash had been sitting. Apparently that was the “friends of Dean” corner tonight. He wasn’t complaining. If he got a good view of his beautifully happy boyfriend for an hour or two then maybe he might survive this shift, aching feet and all.
But Metatron’s pride was his weakness. His absolute certainty that he had won as he stood over Castiel with vindictive glee in his eyes had heralded a mistake. He’d nicked Castiel’s skin and began sucking out his grace so slowly. He’d watched Castiel’s face as it twisted in pain, his watery eyes flaring wide as he shushed him like a child. His concentration on breaking Castiel’s will caused his own will to loosen, his dark elation as he drew out Castiel’s grace pulling his attention from the hold he had on the younger angel. It had been enough for Castiel to snatch the blade and turn it on him.
the car and why Sam was trying to hide a knife under his boot he hadn’t really mentioned. The girl - Katy - had no recollection of her possession and apparently led the kind of life where waking up behind the wheel of a stolen car with two strange men really wasn’t that difficult to explain away. She’d screeched at them to get her home before she called the cops or her big scary boyfriend but Sam had eventually convinced her that calling the police would be a bad idea if she still had a drug heavy enough for her to pass out and have no memory of how she got there in her system. Not wanting to be caught high with a stolen vehicle she’d agreed to head into the strip mall and call the boyfriend.
Faster than he wanted he’d moved robotically through his shower routine and turned it off. He emerged in a towel and sidled into Sam’s room to dress in a t-shirt and a pair of soft lounge pants. He threw some socks on too, needing the extra security for the conversation ahead. He came back, his hair dripping onto the shoulders of his t-shirt. Sam had settled into his usual armchair, leaning his elbows on his knees and clasping his hands in front of him. As Dean flopped onto the futon Sam raised his eyebrows and twitched his chin in a “go on” motion.
By the time Cas was nestled between Dean’s legs Dean was ready to shake apart, but he gulped it down and offered what he hoped was an encouraging smile. Cas smiled back and wrapped one hand gently around Dean’s dick. It was like an electric shock.
“Nothing.” Dean answered immediately. He wasn’t already coming off like some jealous controlling d-bag, was he? “Nothing. Just… Last time Cas saw him he was pretty… pretty messed up. For a few days after.”
him in that weird way he had. Dean found himself just staring back. The stitches in his cheek would be coming out in a few days, just a smooth red line left of the cut beneath. The rest of his skin was smooth and unmarked, his stubble neatly shaven down. His lips were slightly chapped, paler than they should be. Dean had the bizarre urge to run his thumb across them.
Dean sighed, wishing he’d had the balls to tell her all this months ago. “Stuff… happened, Lisa. Sam didn’t just die. He…” he shook his head. How the hell was he supposed to say this out loud?
“Who are you?” Dean demanded, adjusting his grip on the angel blade in case he had to stab her through the seat. Sam was right. Whatever she was she was way too strong to be human, and had shown up with impecable timing if she really was trying to help them. “Did Cas send you?” Maybe this was one of his angel-followers, sent to check up on them when he got blasted out.
“Yeah. Like where their super secret headquarters is.” Dean sighed. “And which pocket dimensions they knew about.”
Ruby shrugged, the hem of her shirt gaping just enough with the movement for him to catch a view of her cleavage. “Us.”
Dean grunted an affirmative. “Chavelle coup. ’70. Idiot kid stole it out of the garage and nearly killed himself trying to impress some girl.”
“And a saber?” Alfie grinned and Castiel tilted his head at him. Alfie shrugged, embarrassed. “I don’t know. For some reason you look like a saber guy.”
The sounds he was making, the scent of his skin where it boiled against Dean’s, it was all so perfect. Cas wound his arms around Dean’s neck as his hips pumped, eyelids fluttering and throat bobbing. Dean gave in finally and let himself grab a handful of that gorgeous hair. Cas gasped and Dean brought his lips to Cas’s ear.
He had thought he loved his father, thought he loved Michael and Lucifer and Anna. And he did, in a stale, grey way. He’d always known it was not the same technicolor ferocity of Gabriel’s love, but it was love all the same. They were his family and he loved them. But now he knew just how flat and obligatory those feelings had been. That love was nothing like the vibrant green of Sam’s affection. It was nothing next to the pale blush of Alfie’s respect or the steely blue of Jo’s protective regard.
“Nope.” Gabriel chirped, kicking her heels against the desk in a stuttering, obnoxious rhythm. “Whatever this place is it wanted Dean here all on its own.”
Instead of laughing like Dean expected, Cas patted Dean’s hand sadly. “I’m sorry she used you to make him jealous. You didn’t deserve that.”
Cas’s lips parted and he searched Dean’s eyes for a moment. Panic? Was that panic in his eyes? Tilting his head down in that same way he had months ago, his “we have work for you” face, he spoke very clearly. “Dean, that was a lie.”
“Rent.” Castiel answered, taking another spoonful. He wasn’t hungry and the flakes had devolved into a sludgy mess, but he swallowed it anyway.
Talia’s wife, Abbey, frowned worriedly, craning her neck to pick their boy out of the huddle. “Do you think so?” she fretted. Abbey was a kindergarten teacher and looked like it. Her short blond bob was immaculate and she wore a baby-pink sun dress and white sneakers. Once upon a time she’s have been just Sammy’s type.
“Get the fuck out of my store you homophobic douche canoe!” Gabriel shouted. A little ripple of murmurs burst from the few occupied tables and Cas sunk down in his chair.
“Ex-girlfriend.” Gabe corrected him gleefully. “And what the hell are you talking about, flaunted? He told her he was gay. He said those words. That’s it. You got a problem with that?”
His shower was quick and businesslike and soon he was dressed in his familiar clothes. Well, they were familiar to him now. One of the silly t-shirts Gabriel had bought for him - a black one that said ‘come to the nerd side, we have pi’ - beneath his usual button-down and a pair of well-fitting jeans. He frowned at himself in the mirror, a pink tinge still staining his cheeks. He wouldn’t do this again. It was a privilege to be near Dean, to have his trust and affection. To be able laugh with him and learn from him. That was enough. Why couldn’t that be enough? Why did he have to constantly wish for more? He really was selfish. Dean had already given him so much, it was unfair of him to wish for more. To Dean and to himself.
“This is such a bad idea.” Dean said for about the thirtieth time. For the thirtieth time Bobby ignored him.

“Isn’t it too bright?” Cas asked, looking sadly at the rack of different gray and tan sweaters behind him, all much less eye-catching than the blue number.
“Sure.” Dean shrugged. “Reynard’s?” Castiel looked up at him, startled. “Ellen mentioned you’re Gabe’s brother. It’s not too far out of our way. Hop in.”
Cas leaned against the wall beside the Lawrence High gate, his socks slowly soaking up slush through his shoes as he smoothed his fingers over the torn knuckles of his other hand.
“To what end?” Balthazar asked. “We know what he plans to offer you. You do not intend to accept, do you?”
Balthazar frowned, casting about with his eyes and his grace. Suspicion was another of those human traits Balthazar had picked up in his time among them. Castiel’s wings twitched guiltily but he was confident his brother would not recognize the trail he had followed.
“And when she asked this, did she mention the peanut gallery here, or did she say ‘you and me’?” Dean asked.
Castiel wondered if any other angel had been allowed to see as a human did, if there were anyone who could appreciate beauty in the same way.
“Look,” Sam said, draining the rest of his coffee. “I don’t know what you wanted out of this but whatever it was I can’t give it to you. You and I… we are not good together.”
It was Cas’s turn to blink. He looked down at his hands, his normal, completely human hands, one of which was holding a fork with a soggy lump of french toast threatening to fall. “The… the angels.” He said quietly. Sam silently put a hand on his shoulder and Cas leaned into it.
The whistle blew for the coin toss and for a while Dean forgot all about Finnerman and Rigby. “Here we go, Cas!” he said, rubbing his gloved hands together briskly.
Bobby laid a hand on his shoulder, gripping solidly. “What is it that’s got you down, boy?” he asked, a drop of gentleness in his voice. It set Castiel’s teeth on edge.
Leaning his head back against the familiar warm tweed of his favorite armchair, Castiel listened to Dean prattle on with a soft smile on his lips. A thread of steam drifted up from his mug, melting the skittering patterns of frost that had crept up the window of Reynard’s. As he sipped his hot chocolate he tried to decide which part of the afternoon had been his favorite; watching Sam lead his team to victory or watching Dean watch Sam. On the one hand Sam Winchester in top form was, to say the least, an impressive sight. He was a strange mixture of explosive force and lithe grace, blasting his way through the opposing team’s ranks one minute and slipping subtly around a single defender the next. The dichotomy baffled the other team and by half-time Lawrence had gained an easy lead.
When Dean Winchester had told Castiel he was going to Stull, going to die alongside the brother he had spent his life protecting, Castiel had not understood. Of course the idea of love was familiar - angels had a great capacity for it - but before he had been human he had never felt it like that. As an angel love was wide and all-encompassing. It was in the song he sang to the sunrise, the wash of waves on the shore, the stream of starlight through the universe. But Dean Winchester’s love was nothing so gentle. It was vicious. Dean Winchester’s love was claws and teeth, a wild, clinging thing. A howling fury echoed and amplified by Sam Winchester, whose soul was no less strong, no less fierce. And Castiel didn’t understand, not until Dean’s car was out of sight in the darkness, and his friends were out of reach.
Castiel glanced at Sam, unsure what to think about this news. Was this some sort of ploy to make him feel indebted? Sam returned the look with nothing but a hopeful twist of his eyebrow. “Perhaps.” Castiel shrugged. “I’m afraid I had to leave all my equipment behind.” He opened the bakery box as he spoke and sighed to discover what Gabriel considered lunch. An enormous slice of cardamon cake with lemon glaze, a pair of apple tartlets, and a miniature raspberry cheesecake.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas stepped up closer to him, not touching him with his dirty hands but leaning up for a kiss. Dean chuckled into it and pressed his chest against Cas’s.
“Right.” Dean nodded, taking back the knife and sliding it into the sheath oh his thigh. Crap. “Thanks, Cas. For that.” He jerked his head towards the window, indicating Lisa and Ben.
“I brought you one of Gabriel’s.” Cas said, producing a dark green bomber hat with silver fur lining from his coat. Dean blinked at him, a slow smile spreading as Cas glanced away. “You frequently forget your hat and gloves when we leave work and I thought it would be very unpleasant for you to sit out here all day without one.”
I will, however, apologize for how long it’s been since the last update. I really do try hard to get them out as fast as possible and I really am grateful to everyone who waits when that doesn’t happen. This is only a short one but I like it. I hope it brightens up your new year and I’ll try to get the next one out soon.
“Yes. It was easiest if I attended the schools at which he worked, so that I could offer feedback.” Dean wondered exactly whom it was easier for. It didn’t sound like Cas meant himself. Poor kid. No wonder he was so uptight. A super religious father dragging him to work his whole life couldn’t have been easy on a little kid.
He pushed the scrubs down his thighs so he could cradle his balls in his other hand, rolling them gently as he pictured blue eyes staring at him, blank with need. Blank blue eyes, and dark, long lashes. Just staring. Just watching him as he pushed into her. Oh
“We’re headed to find Ganem?” Sam asked from the doorway. Dean turned, glaring. It was still a shock to see Sam just standing there, just existing. Only 48 hours ago Sam had been busy not existing, dead. Gone. And now he was here. Kind of.
“You didn’t make it easy, Luc.” Sam smiled, flexing his hands on the table. “I just about cracked a knuckle trying not to hit you.”
Cas swallowed, staring at it. “Oh.” Dean paused, realizing just how far he’d crammed his foot in his mouth. “Sorry, man. I keep forgetting you guys were… family.”
“It’s the extension program.” Gabriel explained, flicking it open in Cas’s hand and pointing to lists of courses and photos of smiling students. “You don’t have to apply or anything, just pick some classes, pay, and show up. You can take them at night or in the morning and have a job on the side. I took some business classes there before I opened the shop back when I worked for Ellen. Best thing I could have done.”
“Ah. Sam tells me you’re working two jobs now?” Dean squirmed at the knowing glint in Chuck’s eye. Chuck knew a lot more about the Winchester family than Dean would have liked, and that meant he knew exactly why Dean was working two jobs.
“Dean,” Lisa stepped around the counter, taking his hand, forcing him to take a moment to breathe. “You ran out into the street in the middle of the night.”
It wasn’t until they rolled into the parking lot of Manhattan High West that Dean reached over to slap Cas’s shoulder, not allowing himself a more gentle touch. “Rise and shine, tiger.” He laughed as Cas jerked awake with an indistinct stutter. “Time to go stick it to the home team!”
Castiel sighed. He was grateful for Virgil’s intervention and his clear concern, but it wasn’t so bad now. “Thank you, Virgil, but I will be fine. If they resort to ambush again I may be forced to involve the authorities but as it is with Kennedy still suspended and Rigby under Chuck’s eye I would rather wait and hope it blows over.”
“You and your brother taught me a great deal about impatience.” Cas said with a quirk of his lips, following Dean into the hall.
“Yeah but don’t let that fool you.” Sam said quickly. “All that tough guy shit is just to cover up the fact that he’s a nice guy underneath. He’s nothing to be scared of, really.”
“It can’t be the ‘Haunted Forrest’ without a Samsquatch.” Gabriel insisted, cornering Sam between a table and the display case. “Put the damn costume on.”
“I made Sam leave.” Cas whispered into his hands as though he’d read Dean’s mind. “He had nothing to do with this and I know if he came here he would do something he would regret. I couldn’t make Jo go with him.”
“Exactly.” Nikki smiled. “We don’t steal magic from random creatures or sell our souls for it like a lot of witches do. All our power comes from inside. Although we do occasionally ask the odd river spirit for a little help.” She winked at Dean.
Dean relaxed slightly. “You really put money down on me being queer?” he asked, unsure why that thought rankled. He
Castiel swallowed. For him? His mouth flapped open and closed once before Lucifer stood, raising his glass elegantly.
Cas kissed him, as fierce and dirty as he could manage. If Dean were to be believed Cas had gotten quite good at turning a simple kiss into something filthy with very little effort. Cas had quite liked hearing that and did his best to continue the trend. With a nip to Dean’s upper lip he murmured “As I’ve told you - many times by now - I have a thing for you.” He let himself fall back, dragging Dean gently on top of him by the tie. “However,” he arched an eyebrow and gave the tie another little tug. Dean laughed.
“Yeah. Remembered that the second I heard his voice on the phone.” Gabriel dragged a palm over his face and let his spoon splash into the bowl. “He said he went to see you at the garage. Bet that was a barrel of fricken laughs.”
Cas shook his head. “I do not know. But I don’t feel Raphael in this.” They stared at the door again for a few minutes. Well, Dean stared at the door. He guessed Cas was staring that that freaky web of disco magic.
Castiel blushed. “I doubt I could teach anyone very much. It’s been months since I had the opportunity to practice.”
“Yes, Dean!” he said, sitting up straighter and letting out a sharp little cry as his ribs pulled alarmingly. Three sets of hands shot out to brace him but Dean was closest.
“And what do we get out of this?” Dean asked. He wasn’t entirely comfortable seeing Crowley’s normal composure crumble so drastically. It couldn’t mean good things. Then agin, they knew that the possibility of the cage being open was beyond ‘not good’.
“Dean,” Cas said, clearing his throat as his voice threatened to crack. “I’m aware from some of the movies we’ve watched what the the implication of this question usually is, but please don’t assume I mean anything other than what I say.” He waited, searching Dean’s face until he received a nod in response. “Would you like to come upstairs?” Dean blinked at him, his tongue darting out to swipe across his lip. Castiel sighed. “That’s not what I meant and you know it.” He complained. Of course he wanted to kiss Dean and touch him, and eventually engage in sexual activity with him - he’d made no secret of that fact at any time in their relationship - but that wasn’t what he was asking for now. Dean had limits beyond which he was not comfortable going and Cas respected them, respected him. “I didn’t mean-“
“Do you want to talk about it?” Lisa asked quietly, flicking the safety back on and dropping her gun on the table where she usually put her keys. Dean stared at it, at the death he had brought into her life. The death she had so casually accepted.
Dean sat forward, slipping a hand around his waist and pulling him close. All thoughts of clothing were wiped from Cas’s mind completely. “You keep drifting off and getting all flustered. If I didn’t know any better I’d say you were fantasizing about somebody.”
“Two bacon cheeseburgers, medium rare.” The kid stammered, sliding the plates across the table and staring at Dean like he was a bomb about to go off. Dean bit his lip and glared out the window until the kid retreated.
Chuck slipped into the room fully and closed the door. “I’ve brought the four individuals who were involved to my office and we had a chat. Their parents will be down this afternoon to discuss the incident but in the meantime all four will have serious disciplinary action taken.”
She stuck her hand out and he took it, surprised at the force of her handshake. “Friends?” she asked, a bit of that tentative persona he was used to slipping through.
“Castiel, my office manager received your vaccination records this morning so we’re one step closer to full enrolment. When we spoke before classes began you told me you were waiting on your social security card to complete all the paperwork. Have you gotten that yet?”
“Oh my god.” Sam breathed, clamping a hand over his mouth to keep from cracking up. His shoulders shook and he nearly doubled over as Gabriel just kept staring.
Sam frowned, glancing at the clock. He opened his mouth to argue but Cas shook his head. “Only a short one.” He promised. “It doesn’t do us any good to run ourselves into the ground with this.”
“Hey, knock that shit off right now!” Dean barked. “It’s not your fault your dad had a stroke. This shit happens, Cas.”
“Sure.” She shrugged, popping one of the monstrous cakes in a paper box and shoving it in the microwave. Dean paid and gathered up the food, flashing a grateful smile as the brunette offered a little cardboard tray and a plastic spork. He was about halfway back to the stands when he heard an all-too-familiar voice.
“My part’s done.” Ganem panted, his fingers flicking quick patterns in the air. He was sweating, gritting his teeth. He ignored the gash in his left forearm, the blood leaking from his eyebrow. How had they gotten to him? “I’ve just been waiting for you. Go. Find Henry. Lock Abbadon away. I can destroy these here.” He was glowing now, his skin blurring with symbols that burned into it. “Just been waiting for you.” He smiled, moustache bristling.
Cas touched his cheek, the stitches that would soon be removed. “I’d never been hit before, not by anyone in my family. I’d been beaten up a few times at school, struck in practice by opponents. There’s something very different about your own father’s hand, I discovered. And in that moment, looking up at the disgust and anger in his face I realized that we would never… that I could never forgive him for that. He was
Dean stretched, throwing both arms over his head and arching his back until it popped. His ratty old Zep t-shirt was rucked up around his ribs and sunlight spilled in the open windows, warming the bare skin of his stomach deliciously. It was his first morning off in nearly three weeks and in celebration he’d decided to sleep until noon. Of course he couldn’t actually do it - he rarely slept more than five or six hours a night - but it was still awesome to just lay around being lazy in his boxers and eating frozen waffles straight from the packet.
When they blinked back into existence they were standing in Lisa’s living room, Dean’s muddy boots leaving marks on her clean white carpet. Who the hell gets white carpet, anyway? Dean thought, bizarrely.
Castiel nodded, a bit surprised he’d bothered to mention it. “I have no intention of fighting anyone on or off school property, I assure you.” He said.
Gabriel didn’t seem to mind at all, which was a relief. Having seen Gabriel’s big brother mode up close and personal Dean wasn’t exactly itching to have another demonstration. The most Gabe did was tease Dean mercilessly about cradle robbing every time he saw him. Dean figured poor Cas probably got a lot worse when he was home. Since he’d seen Cas deal with Gabriel’s shit more than once he didn’t feel too guilty about it.
“Glad to know I’m not the only one who had a shit year.” She said with a weak laugh. Ah. So perhaps tonight was not a celebration for her, either.
“I know, right?” Jo scoffed. “I don’t know whether to be proud or pissed. Anyway, this is you. I’ll see you at lunch!”
searching for God, but he continued to follow the path he felt his father had opened for him. He grabbed hold of that conviction, of his absolute certainty that he
“I didn’t ask,” Castiel said carefully, “but she still made it clear that if I want to know about what you experienced last year I would have to ask you. Though I admit I had gathered the bit about the drugs myself.”
“Hello, Ruby.” Said Cas, watching her head swivel towards him in surprise. So this was the girl who had been the center of so much chaos in the Winchesters’ lives.
Cas stared at the phone, nonplussed. Perhaps he meant about the equipment? It seemed an odd phrasing but then again if Lucifer were texting from the car or in between phone calls he might be down to the bare minimum of words to save time. Cas was about to respond that everyone was very impressed with the new gear when he phone rang in his hand. The little devil icon Gabriel had set that Cas still hand’t managed to remove danced across the screen. Cas frowned but hit “receive”.
“Pardon?” Cas turned to find himself staring into a pair of enormous brown eyes sparkling with amusement.
Sam just nodded. He didn’t want to comment on her sobriety or the reason behind it. It was her problem. Still, he would be honest with her. “You look good, too.” He said with a gentle half-smile.
“What’s on your mind, cowboy?” Ellen asked, shoving his head affectionately as she hustled by with a case of bourbon on her hip. She dropped it under the bar and started unloading bottles onto the shelf, a towel thrown over her shoulder.
Dean ground his teeth. “And I didn’t think it was possible for you to get more annoying.” He grated.
“The spell itself will be effective for seven days, and after that he will have to wait one cycle of the moon to cast it again.”
“What am I even supposed to cook for Lucifer?” Gabe continued, pushing back through the door with a massive recipe book in hand. “Infant Flambé? Roast him up a freshly caught virgin? What?” he slammed the book down on Castiel’s table, loose pages flying every which way. “You find something in here that I’m supposed to whip up for Satan’s dinner that doesn’t require a blood sacrifice. I
Gabriel set Cas’s latte on the table in front of him along with a plate of pancakes stacked high with berries and dripping in syrup. A cinnamon roll, fresh and warm, was tucked alongside the pancakes and Castiel smiled wearily at his brother. Gabriel found comfort in sugary food and even more comfort in feeding other people sugary foods. Cas picked up his fork and a bite.
“So you took away his choice to be pissed as hell at you, which as far as I can tell he has every right to be.” Gabriel growled, and Cas could see the trace of frustration that he still didn’t know all that had happened the night Castiel left home.
He was on the road for nearly an hour before the sun had finally set, leaving a bluish stain across the horizon behind him. Exiting the highway, he pulled off in a little stretch of nowhere to find an old access road where he could roll into the trees. He killed the engine and climbed out of the car to lean against the hood.
Of course he knew Dean didn’t love him in a romantic sense. Dean was straight, and even if he weren’t he would probably chose someone as gregarious and vivacious and captivating as himself. Someone luminous. He deserved as much. But nonetheless Cas had felt loved as Dean held him and let him weep. Pulling his pillow to his face he wrapped his arms around it, hugging it to him with all the strength he wished he’d held Dean.
He blinked, rubbing his eyes with the back of his free hand. “Castiel?” Deep in the core of him something clenched, holding tight to the memory of black hair and blue, blue eyes. How the hell long had it been? Four years? Jesus.
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asked, suddenly right beside him. When he’d gotten out of the car Dean wasn’t sure and he tensed in an effort not to lean into Cas’s space. He was extra stubbly this morning, Dean couldn’t help but notice.
“But you seem to have a very strong relationship.” Lucifer continued, as if he hadn’t been interrupted. Castiel had a feeling he knew where this was going and he didn’t like it. “Perhaps teenage boys aren’t such a mystery to you as to the rest of us.”
“Hey.” Dean said softly, placing one hand on the side of Cas’s neck. Castiel knew he must feel his heart thundering, the tremor running through him in a continuous loop. “Deep breaths, Cas.” He instructed.
Cas ignored him. “None of it is. Certainly not breaking the first seal. No one else would have lasted half so long in Alastair’s keeping.” He continued mercilessly.
“Hold up, cowboy.” Gabriel chirped, popping her lollipop back in her mouth and jumping in front of him. It was weird looking down into her little heart-shaped face and seeing those same amber eyes and sarcastic smirk. It really was Gabriel in there. “Lemme just…” She raised her thin hand and waved it around in a complicated series of gestures. Cas gasped. If Dean could’ve taken his eyes off his little brother he would have seen subtle warping and flashes in the air around him. As it was he just stared at the stupid curl framing Sam’s left ear and tried his damnedest not to bust into sloppy tears.
“There are two other major factions.” Cas explained. Looking around like he found the topic boring. “Malachi leads one. He is strong and very wise, and several of our commanders back him. But he is only of middle ranking, and traditionalists flock to Raphael’s banner.”
Jo rolled her eyes. “Thank god. We were totally crap this year. It was only the Lawrence legacy intimidating all the other teams that got us this far.”
“Oh. Yes.” Cas nodded. “Despite what Dean says I would definitely have been… how did you put it, Jo? A walking eggplant?”
“Well,” said Lou, clearing her throat and pushing her plate of eggs over to Nikki. The blond dug in with gusto. “That’s quite a resume.”
Ganem scratched at his moustache. “The reliquary could contain Abaddon, but it could not mask her aura entirely. Even with Henry’s soul enveloping her it would act as a beacon, drawing every witch and demon on the continent to her. If they were to break her free we wouldn’t have another chance to capture her. Henry knew that I would not be able to carry out the next part of our protocol, and took it upon himself to complete the capture.”
They hung up and within minutes Dean was in the impala, speeding towards the school. When he arrived he went straight for Chuck’s office, only to find Cas sitting in a chair shaking and looking like he was about to throw up on his shoes. He didn’t seem to be hurt, at least not that Dean could see. There were no fresh cuts or bruises, his knuckles were smooth and unbroken. Probably not a fight, then.
“Gabriel was in high school when our father began to speak about his career with the church, as though it were already decided upon. I suppose in his mind it was.” Castiel smiled, his lips stretching dry against his teeth. “Can you imagine Gabriel in the church?”
“As I said,” Anna replied, not shrinking for a second from his savage tone, “my prayers have been for my own sake as much as his. I failed him and I failed myself. I have prayed that he should not bear the burden of that mistake.”
“And it can wait til we get back.” Sam said decisively. “We get Cas home, we make sure he’s okay, and
Rigby. His pimpled face locked in a snarl as he swung wide, nearly sending himself through the plate glass as he overbalanced. A short, olive-skinned boy Castiel didn’t know dove in from the side where Cas could see Kennedy lurking - he must have met the rest of the gang after school. Cas slammed his wrist down on the boy’s forearm as he attempted to catch the lapel of Cas’s coat and scooped his hand around the back of his head, sending him spinning to the ground. Hands grabbed at the back of Cas’s collar and a punch landed across the back of his skull. Ignoring the echo in his ears he whipped around again, driving the heel of his hand up into his attacker’s nose. A satisfying crunch preceded a wail of pain. The olive-skinned boy was back up. He threw a punch and Cas tried to dodge. It still caught him in the eye but it was a glancing blow, nothing like the ringing roar it should have landed. He took the opportunity to snatch the boy’s wrist and yank him forward, kneeing him viciously in the gut. He crumpled to the ground with a wheezy groan. Cas spun back to face three more boys. Raphael stood between two others, his eyes wide in anger and shock. Cas smirked as he realized this was the first time Raphael had seen him defend himself physically. Clearly it was more than the taller boy had been expecting.
Castiel looked out over the lakes, focusing again on what a human would see. “Why do you not follow Malachi?” he asked. “You’ve known him much longer, held his counsel for millennia. What brought you to me?”
Ben paused with his spoon halfway to his mouth. “Wait, didn’t the real Loki give birth to a horse?” he asked, his face scrunched in confusion. Gabriel blinked.
“Did you know our dad, too?” Asked Sam. He sat on the bed, hands clasped and wrists resting on his knees. It had taken Ganem about two seconds to decide that he was mistaken, that Sam couldn’t be Henry Winchester. For one thing Henry would be about ninety years old, and for another Sam had a good foot of height on the guy. At least. But apparently the resemblance was strong enough that he had put two and two together, and held off on trying to kill them again. At least long enough to feed them some cock-and-bull story about a secret society of mystics and hunters who were apparently their ancestors or some shit. Ganem had been waiting for a “legacy”, he said, for decades.
Chagrin passed over the old hunter’s face. “Sent Garth Fitzgerald after it. That kind of thing’s about all that boy can handle without getting himself killed.”
“Did you have fun while I was away?” Raphael asked in a mock-pleasant tone. “Fuck your pal Winchester after his big win? Celebrate in style?”
“Gabe, I-“ began Finnerman, clearly ready to back straight out of the whole situation but Gabriel cut him off with a look.
“I don’t know if I would do it again, now that I’ve had some time to get Ruby out of my system.” He smiled wryly. “Among other things.”
“Gabriel has done enough.” Cas shot, not noticing when Jo’s eyes widened at his sharp tone. His movements were jerky as he dialled. It rang twice before Lucifer’s smooth voice answered.
“Option two,” Gabriel bulldozed on, but Dean caught the vacant look in Sam’s face. Not a scrap of shame. No hint of remorse for hiding himself away and letting Dean think he was in the goddamn cage. “Option two is we do a little test.”
“Hello?” he said, not quite able to keep the question from his tone. Lucifer had never called him. Since he’d taken the phone from him Castiel had always been the one to initiate a call. Why on earth should he be calling now?
“Hey, Anna.” He said as she kissed his cheek. “The single life is treating you good.” He gave an exaggerated eyebrow waggle and Cas rolled his eyes as Anna laughed. “I’ll leave you two crazy kids to it.” He said as he pulled on his coat. “Told Bobby I’d pick up Ash’s shift today anyway. Idiot sprained his wrist and got stuck on desk duty for a few weeks.”
“Cas, if you get the butter and heavy cream I can get the potatoes, carrots, and onions.” Jo said, scanning the shopping list Ellen had scribbled on an order ticket. A wire basket hung from her elbow and Cas and Sam each held one of their own. “Sam that means you’re finding sausage, two cans of cream of mushroom soup, and whatever this is supposed to say.” She turned the ticket to him and he squinted at a
Dean gulped as he realized Alfie wasn’t entirely talking about Cas anymore. And Dean realized he would never quite get it. He hadn’t been that kid in high school. He had been the opposite end of the spectrum. Cool, popular, into all the right sports and chasing girls. He’d never gotten good enough grades to be considered a nerd like Sammy, but he hadn’t been one of the dumb jocks either. Yeah he’d been poor and from the wrong side of town but his natural charm and likability had done a lot to smooth that over. And even that had been an advantage with some of the ladies. He was big enough to take care of himself and his life before Lawrence had taught him how to fight. And more importantly taught him how to talk his way out of one and still not look like a coward. Dean had been savvy, street-smart even in the narrow fishbowl of high school.
“But I didn’t. All I could think of was how badly we fit now. We used to…” he trailed off. “Anyway. I told her I didn’t want to go back to that. That I was moving on and I hoped she would too. And then I left.”
“No matter why, you saved my little brother’s life.” She said, letting go of him and stepping back. Kennedy stared at her. “Thank you.” She said with her heart in her voice.
There it all was, still laid out in his beautifully ordered chaos. The paraphernalia of two generations of hunters piled haphazardly on top of one another, just waiting to hurt something.
“Look, Cas,” Sam said as he ran a hand through his hair. “I know you’re gonna have mixed feelings on this. I still wonder if letting Lilith off and not speaking up for Ruby more were the right choices. Part of me wanted both of them to get locked up forever, part of me knew that they were young and dumb and deserved help. But remember what you told Amelia?”
the way she did. Got me. She knew what it was like to have to drag your dad in the door so he didn’t pass out in the street and get arrested. She knew what it was like to have to pretend that you were fine when you were so angry inside you thought you were going to combust. She knew how it felt to be so desperate to get out but feel like you were stuck in quicksand. She just got it.”
“He wanted to tell you.” Castiel said gently, an apology in his tone. “But I was afraid. I asked him to give me more time.”
“What’s this?” he asked, taking the clipboard the delivery guy offered. The guy just shrugged and wheeled it further inside, letting the door swing shut behind him.
“Doing a bang-up job of keeping my promises, aren’t I?” he grated into the gloom. “Sitting in a guest room pretending not to cry. Playing mild-mannered house husband during the day and shaking like a fucking weepy leaf every time my head hits the pillow. Apple pie life my fucking ass. Still. Gotta do what Sammy wanted. Gotta be the good big brother.” He dug his fingernails hard into the meat of his thigh. “I sure as hell sucked at it when he was alive.” A sob burst from his chest, harsh and painful before he schooled himself, fists tightening over his knees. “Yeah, poor Dean, right? I’m the one that needs pity. He’s stuck in the pit with the dickiest angels to ever dick for the next chunk of forever but let’s focus on how miserable I am. God.” He pressed his hand over his mouth briefly to muffle the choked off sob of rage. After a few moments he was calm enough to go on.
Sam couldn’t contain his laughter any more, it seemed. “Stop spitting on my upholstery.” Dean hissed, smacking his brother’s shoulder.
Dean’s head drooped against his arm on the door. “Come on, man.” He groaned, rubbing his thumb over the bridge of his nose. “Can we just…?”
Castiel glared at her, trying hard to hold onto his anger. But there was something there, something eager and tense as she waited for his reply that softened him. And the sadness he’d seen downstairs seemed to swell out behind her eyes into something vast and hopeless.
“Cas!” he turned to see Sam shoving his way through the crowd with uncharacteristic haste. He was clutching a sheaf of papers in one hand, his smile bright with excitement. “3.87!” he panted, “I came in at 3.87!”
Gabriel chuckled. “Lucy even sent him date night money for Christmas. You gonna make use of that soon?”
Castiel felt a little swell of pride. “I’m glad to have been asked.” He replied. This sounded very much like friendship, he thought.
That settled, Dean promptly fell asleep and slept a full seven hours - longer than he had in months.
“Really?” Gabe drawled, picking up the tone just as well as Cas. “Something tells me your pants are on fire, Finnerman.”
Sam was silent for a long moment but Dean could practically hear the gears in his brain clicking along. “Dad?” he said finally, his voice soft.
“Are you alright?” murmured Cas, watching a damp leaf slither across the tarmac as the wind picked up.
Dean threw her a playful salute. “Pino Grigio ok?” He asked, ducking behind the counter for a glass.
Cas gave and ugly snort. “I am no longer part of his family. He and Michael have made that very clear.” Cas tried to keep the venom out of his voice but he could hear it anyway.
Dean obeyed, too stunned to protest. By the time he swung his door shut the girl had it started up and they peeled out. Sirens started screaming in the distance. Dean turned to watch through the back window as flames obscured the whole of Harper House, thick black smoke coughing its way skyward.
“Well you’ve got a pretty big soft spot for the Winchesters.” Bobby suggested. “Maybe he’s trying to get under your skin?”
Dean slashed the demon’s throat without a second thought, spinning away towards the next before the blinding sear of the angel blade died. He didn’t think. He kicked another square in the face as it clambered over the window sill, shoving it back into another three behind it. The bodies crushed a bed of snapdragons, sending mulch flying. He backed up to Ganem’s chair where Sam was already guarding the far side, demon blade and holy water in each hand.
Dean nodded. “Okay, Cas. But what about you? Aren’t you a little busy on the campaign trail for this shit right now?”
“Not all of us live on bacon grease and beef, Dean.” Sam muttered in his lecturing voice. “Some of us prefer actual nutrition from time to time.”
Cas touched his cheek, trying to remember the last time someone had kissed him. Gabriel, the night he had panicked about being thrown out for his attraction to Dean. But before that? Gabriel again. A decade before. On the night he left.
“But in at least 30 different handwritings.” Continued Sam. “And see here,” he handing Castiel a sheaf of yellowed papers, “there’s this mark at the end of each one.” Cas took the papers, looking over the signature after each entry. Dean could see different inks, different hands. Some wrote the name in huge, graceful loops, others in cramped little nubs. Some slanted right, some left. One near the top was painstakingly neat while a few at the bottom were a barely intelligible scrawl. A small, ovular smudge followed each signing, all in the same blue ink. Cas peered at it, all squinty and serious and Dean fought down a hysterical laugh. The most interesting thing about all of this was a frigging ink splatter on some fifty year old papers? Right.
Kennedy cracked a little lopsided grin and pumped his fist once. Then he dropped his hand and moved back, wiping his palm nervously on his jeans. “See you around, Android.” He said with a lame little wave and Cas shook his head.
He was snatched from the warm glow by a pair of rough hands at his collar, yanking him off the path into the frost-tipped bushes. Immediately he spun, throwing the weight of his bag against the chest of his attacker. A startled grunt and the hands released him, letting him come into a defensive stance with his hands up to guard his face.
Gabriel reappeared with a richly decorated pie - chocolate marscapone raspberry by the look of it - and four plates, setting the lot carefully down in the middle of the table. He produced forks from his pocket and a stack of napkins, handing all of them to Dean.
Dean sighed, forcing his hands to open. “As long as you’re ok.” He said grudgingly. He looked back at Lucifer - stupid dick name to match his stupid dick face - and frowned.
Sam scowled, pulling what Cas had heard Dean call a “bitchface”. “You really hate me, don’t you?” he hissed, but he took the feet and strapped them on.
“Sheriff’s office. Found a car. My registration. Had a tree in the middle of it. Two bodies inside.” Tears were rolling down his face. He ignored them. “I just… the bottom dropped out.” His hands were shaking. He ignored them. “Gone. Just… everything was gone. He…” His voice was cracking. He ignored it.
“Uncultured swine.” Gabriel sniffed. Anna chuckled, drawing a grin from her older brother. Dean tried hard not to think about the light in Gabriel’s expression. His little sister back with him after what… ten years? Eleven? Ouch.
Dean squinted at him, his stomach suddenly too twisted to even think about pizza. “Just tell me.” he demanded.
“You know that we can take it as slow as you want, right?” Dean said, making sure Cas was looking at him. “I mean, I know we said once you’re eighteen and all but, if you need more time that’s not going to be a problem.”
Lisa sighed. “It’s alright, Dean. No harm done.” She smiled and patted his elbow. “Do you want a cup of tea or something?” Dean knew as well as she did that “or something” was the whiskey bottle hidden in the back of the cereal cupboard.
“Oh, uh, yeah. The callipers.” Dean said, fumbling with the packaging. Cas’s strong fingers on the back of his neck were distracting as hell but Dean wasn’t about to tell him to let go.
Dean was gonna scream. He reigned in the urge to slap Cas’s hand away and set his jaw. “Cas, you are not leaving me behind again. If you even think of it I will just sneak out and follow you.” Ok, so he sounded like a sulky teenager but it was the goddamn truth. Cas’s frown deepened and his eyes flicked speculatively to the floor. “Last time you locked me in the panic room I escaped.” Dean reminded him. He was pretty sure Cas wouldn’t fall for the same trick twice but the point still stood. He was not going to be left behind.
Castiel tilted his head to one side, like puppy who heard a whistle. “You said that then, too. I don’t understand. It was clear I was outnumbered.”
That earned him a whack on the thigh. “Language, young man.” Mrs. J scolded firmly. “And you’d better hop it to class, young lady,” she told Jo, “before Chuck catches you loitering.”
“I am here.” Cas went on calmly. “I am fine. Nothing is broken, I don’t have a concussion. I am perfectly fine. Dean took me to the hospital and a doctor confirmed it.” He stared Sam down - something Dean knew from experience was no easy feat - refusing to blink until Sam’s nostrils went back to their regular size and he looked a little less like he was about to go on a killing spree.
Cas jerked back, nearly knocking Dean into the lap of the guy next to him as he shoved him away. “I, wha-“
“Ellen, I think I’m gonna die.” Dean complained, rubbing his protruding stomach with one hand. He’d had about four helpings of everything (except the creamed onions which nobody but Bobby ever ate because
It happened a few times over the next two weeks as classes wound down towards winter break. With midterms and lacrosse season over and done with both Sam and Cas seemed to be just sort of coasting towards their last day. Sam was a broody little shit for a day or two after Brady’s party - even more than usual - but that knot of tension that had built up over him the past month like his own personal thunder cloud started to loosen so Dean tried not to needle him too much about it. He still had Cas over to study a few times a week, along with Jo and Alfie, and most of those nights Cas ended up crashing on the futon with Dean. And if it meant spending an extra ten minutes in the shower every morning to rid himself of the raging boners waking up with Cas glommed onto him like a frigging octopus left him with, well, Dean was willing to make that sacrifice.
Cas smiled. “Perhaps. And maybe I could talk Gabriel into coming in to give a few pointers. He was very skilled with a sabre when we were young.”
to each other they could get back on track. But Sam knew all too well that Dean was the reigning champion of the International Stubborn Asshat Association and Cas was a challenger for the title, so that wasn’t likely to happen any time soon.
He beat that urge down with the old Winchester self-denial and kept his eyes firmly on the road all the way to Manhattan.
The terrible television shows Gabriel watched would suggest that at the resolution of such a large confrontation he and Dean should have fallen into each others arms, kissed passionately and forgotten anything had ever happened. That is not what had happened. The soft press of Dean’s lips on his forehead had been welcomed, but that was all. It was a relief to have the anger between them resolved. But part of Castiel, the part bruised by Dean’s harsh words, the part that was still angry and upset, didn’t want to push them any further just now. It felt as though one wrong step and they would press on that bruise, fall back into the pain they had caused one another.
of playing Heaven’s translator.” He spat, thrusting the tablet at Dean. “Nothing good is gonna come off of that hunk of stone and I refuse to keep pointing you two down the wrong road over and over!” Dean set down his spoon and took the tablet, still surprised at how heavy the thing was. Kevin crossed his skinny arms and glared at Dean. “Threaten me all you want, kick me out to get creamed by some demons or angel-napped. I don’t care. I’m
They passed the little bookshop where Castiel worked and then Reynard, which was bustling as usual. Castiel could just make out Gabriel behind the counter extolling the virtues of one of his latest creations to a poor, pretty girl who seemed quite overwhelmed by his attention. Gabe was clearly in top form; charming, witty, and an absolute terror. He’d had that same look two weeks ago when he’d asked Castiel to test his new candied apples. Castiel had bitten into a caramel covered onion and nearly vomited.
Jo raised a skeptical eyebrow. “Oh really?” She folded her fingers together to cradle her chin, tilting her head and batting her huge eyes in a creepy parody of love-struck wonder.
“That boy has got an overprotective streak 10 miles wide.” Bobby shook his head. “I’m guessing he saw your face all torn up, got scared and pissed and took it all out on you, didn’t he?”
“Hey, slow down, man.” Sam said, not quite daring to take a hold of the bottle. Dean shot him a glare. “What, uh, what happened?”
“Had a good time with Anna?” Dean guessed, trailing his fingers along Cas’s belt. He hadn’t seen Cas since Anna’s unannounced arrival. The kid had taken off his shifts at the garage to spend all his free time with her. Dean understood, obviously, but it had been a little weird not having the guy around for a few days. He felt like he was forgetting something the whole time, just a little twitch at the back of his brain.
For a split second he was sitting in that hard, hideous hospital chair fighting just to keep from shaking apart. Staring down at the needle taped neatly into the back of Sam’s hand, unable to meet the shame and desperation in his little brother’s eyes, that’s what he’d said.
Cas nodded. “I never thought any of you would judge me harshly for my sexual preference.” He said, looking Sam in the eye so that he would see he was speaking truthfully. “I had some concerns about Dean but he proved them unfounded after he picked me up this morning.”
“It’s a heater core.” Dean explained, moving the picture so Cas could see it more fully. “You’ve seen how the heater craps out randomly? It’s been doing that since the crash. I thought I might get away without replacing it cause they can get a little pricey. But it’s toast.” Dean looked up, his eyes a little more watery than usual. “Thanks, Sammy.”
“It’s amazing how quickly a divorce can happen when you can confirm rampant infidelity on one person’s part.” She confirmed drily.
It wasn’t a question. Castiel smiled, grateful she’d caught on. “Yes.” He said. “I am. So you understand, it didn’t occur to me that you thought of me romantically.”
“A coven of nerd illuminati witches?” Dean snorted. The way Castiel glanced at him told Dean the angel didn’t believe his shot at levity.
“You see that mother of pearl on the cap? That’s the Montblanc emblem.” Gabriel picked it up, carefully cradling it as if it were a sparrow’s egg. “Guilloché engraving, oyster lacquer, red gold clip and-“ he slid the cap off revealing a dangerously sharp point, “rose gold, hand-carved nib.” The arrow-head nib was covered in delicate scrollwork. An ornate “S” was styled into the gleaming metal. “Custom.” Gabriel added. He slid the cap back on and replaced it in the box. “You take care of that Sammy, I’d say you’re looking at a two thousand dollar pen, there.”
“Latte.” Cas sighed and made his way to his favorite table, taking the seat facing the door so he could watch Gabriel as he flitted about. They’d decided it was too cold for ice cream after all and Gabriel had spent the drive home planning the elaborate brunch they would eat instead. Cas had let him prattle on, his rage slowly dissipating into exhaustion.
“Yep.” Gabriel nodded. “Hence the eighty-three volunteers.” Dean wasn’t sure why but the idea of Gabriel popping in and out of eighty-three people in a span of a few days creeped him out completely.
“Bars and homeless people.” Dean said, digging out his pistol and shoving it in the shoulder holster under his jacket. The demon knife went town the back of his jeans and he laid out one of the salt-loaded sawed-offs on the table by Sam’s right hand.
“Oh, uh… yeah it kinda sucked.” He admitted. “Especially driving home with strawberry ice-cream melting in my boxers.”
“And happy birthday, jerk.” Sam grinned, slapping a box down on the counter. It was from Reynard’s and Castiel could smell a confusing mixture of bacon and sugar wafting up out of the patterned cardboard.
They’d arrived before most of the other guests, when the lights were still on and a non-shouted conversation was still possible. Brady’s parents owned a lovely, large home on the outskirts of town and he had invited the team and anyone else who felt like attending -
Dean gave up trying to get through the herds of kids swarming towards the lobby and parked himself by the doors to cafeteria, leaning back against the lockers and watched the children trail by. Had it always been such a frigging zoo in the afternoons? Thinking back on it Dean didn’t really ever remembering being here for more than two seconds after the final bell rang. Just as he was contemplating punching the next kid that ran into him and didn’t even say sorry he spotted Sammy’s hair flopping towards him nearly half a foot above the rest of the student body.
“Oh yeah?” Dean groused. “What am I thinking right now?” he concentrated really, really hard on the idea of Cas getting a boot up his ass.
It was darker than he had been expecting, blues and greys swirling across the paper in shifting layers. A rain storm. A boy, walking away, a thin tan trench coat whipping in the wind and a backpack clutched in one hand. The boy’s black hair was dancing in the rain, his shoes reflected in the puddle he treaded through. And spreading out on either side, storm-tossed and magnificent, were a pair of massive black wings. The feathers shone and Cas touched them delicately with one finger, almost expecting to feel their silky coolness against his skin.
“Sure.” Kenny shrugged easily, swinging the keys to the old station wagon Bobby had given him on one finger. “Nice to meet you, Castiel.” He said, offering his hand. Cas took it, turning that laser-gaze on the young hunter again, who gulped audibly.
“Oh yeah?” Dean cocked an eyebrow and squeezed at Cas’s waist. “What were you gonna do, hu?” He tugged gently on Cas’s hand, leading him into the apartment. He shrugged out of his jumpsuit and shimmied it down his hips, kicking it into the corner of the living room before he sat down on the futon. Cas followed suit and Dean clamped down hard on the little voice screaming TAKE IT OFF! in his brain. When Cas glanced at the place beside him Dean shook his head, He reached out, guiding Cas forward until he was kneeling on the futon, straddling Dean’s lap. It was fine, Dean told himself. He wanted Cas closer than just sitting beside one another, wanted to hold him for a while. And he could control himself, damnit.
“Cas.” He breathed, only breaking contact long enough to loosen their hands and slide his into Cas’s hair.
Dean laughed. “Cool.” He ducked down and filled a couple glasses with ice. “Hydration is important.” He said, sliding the glasses across the bar and waving off the offered money. “Nah, water’s on the house. That all?”
There was Garland, standing straight, ready to start after a year rebuilding a tweaked knee. Beyond him stood Cole, short and fast as hell. This would be his last game. He was graduating in the spring with Brady after four years on the varsity team. A few places down stood Mark, the wiry little freshmen who had been so stunned to make varsity that he was too terrified to speak to any of the upperclassmen for nearly a month. He’d gotten over that as soon as it became clear he was in the run for high-scorer this season. He had earned his spot on the team so many times over. Keith, Jayden, Dylan, every one of these guys had worked their asses off all year and pushed Sam to be better.
Sam was already dialling. His face was tense as they all heard it ringing in the silence. Then, after the third ring, Cas picked up.
“Well, he works a couple jobs now.” Alfie explained, sliding onto the bench that ran along the wall and dropping his backpack. The zipper was slightly broken, held together with safety pins in some places and Castiel could see at least four textbooks. It was stuffed to the brim and must have weighed eighty pounds with all those books in it.
“Yeah. Your deal. You were staring at Amelia like a fucking pervert all through government this morning.”
He closed the short distance between them, taking her folded hands in his own. Her fingers were thin and cool, but she gripped him back with bruising force.
Norah shrugged at him. “Christmas we are usually full up on volunteers. You’d think we would be empty but people tend to think about those less fortunate than they are at Christmas time. If you’re free on New Year’s Eve, though, we are almost always hurting for help.”
It may have looked like a dump, but everyone in Lawrence knew that the best damn burgers in the state came from the Roadhouse.
Ben nodded enthusiastically, tucking his forgotten comic under his arm as his mother stood and patted the dust from her shorts. Lisa had been cooking for them as a thank you to Bobby for letting them stay, but she’d live with Dean long enough to know he secretly found housework a little soothing so she didn’t protest.
Castiel touched her arm lightly. “Sam is intelligent.” He offered gently. “He has friends who will protect him. And as for Alfie, perhaps we should all stand up for him a little more so that Sam doesn’t take the brunt of the blow.”
“That’s my job.” Gabe agreed easily. “Speaking of, where is Winchester the Elder tonight? I’ve got a hell of a cherry pie with his name on it.”
The half-way point had been agreed on but now he was wishing he had insisted on driving the whole way. It would have at least bought him more time to get a hold of himself before he had to face the music.
“Court mandated.” She sneered. “Just like you.” He refused to let that get under his skin. How many times had he told Dean that all that shit had been
“Yeah, sure Cas.” Dean mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck uncomfortably. “But if you’re running for ‘King of Heaven’ or whatever you might want to run a comb through your hair.”
So here sat Dean, alone in his cozy plush box of a room unable to step far enough out of Hell to appreciate it. How could he? He knew where Sam was, what he was going through. Dean had spent 30 years on Alastair’s rack and even that would be a tropical vacation compared to the cage. And that was where his brother was now. Both his brothers. Adam too, poor dumb kid. Stuck in the pit with Lucifer himself and that colossal prick Michael, eternity stretched before them all with nothing better to do than dole out revenge.
And we went to the hospital. I thought we were going to the morgue. And Bobby would see him. And then he’d know. Pretty shitty way to do it, but I wasn’t really thinking straight at the time.” He shrugged.
“Plus a little ACL repair.” Sam said from beside the door. Lou jumped, apparently not having noticed the hulking younger Winchester on her way in. She spun around and her mouth dropped open as she caught sight of Sam shadowed against the wall.
“He lied to me.” Cas’s voice was small and broken. A tear leaked down his cheek. “He was trying… he was going to banish us all from Heaven. He was angry at God, angry at all of us.”
Ben scurried over to the maps spread across the kitchen table. “That’s less than ten miles from Carthage!” he squeaked.
“You’re welcome.” Gabe grinned. “Well, if he doesn’t have the decency to come get it himself you can at least take that pie home for him. I’ll box it up.” Gabe turned to Castiel, a vicious smile lighting his face. “Now’s your chance to make friends, Cassie. Play human for a bit, alright?”
He’d spent about twenty minutes in the shower frantically scrubbing his come-sticky thigh as if that might somehow erase what had happened the night before. It didn’t.
Bobby grunted and Dean thought he saw the beginnings of a blush creep up from under the beard. “What’s Feathers up to?” he glanced at the staircase where Cas was running his fingers over the sigil-carved bannister.
Castiel had never been a fan of crowds (they rarely failed to five him blistering headaches within twenty minutes) but he was willing to make an exception today. In fact, he was quite excited about the prospect of sitting jammed in uncomfortable bleachers amid hundreds of other screaming fans. It was the first lacrosse game of the season, Sam’s first game since rejoining the team, and he’d asked Castiel to come.
“Sorry about that.” She said, dragging herself up on her palms to sit on the desk. Dean noticed runes carved into it beneath her hands. “Had to get your attention somehow.”
“Mr. Winchester, given your involvement I will give you the option of an early release as well, if you think you need it.” Chuck raised his eyebrows at Sam and Sam glanced at Cas.
“Dean,” Sam grunted, and the sound of his voice vibrating through the side of Dean’s skull nearly knocked Dean flat. “I can’t breathe.”
He slid from the car and rubbed his palms nervously on his shirt. He hadn’t seen Bobby since Stull, had barely been able to speak to him on the phone. He’d checked in dutifully once a month to let the old hunter know he was alive, lying about how great it was in Indiana and how happy he was with his new life. Bobby would talk about a car he was working on or the weather. They both knew it was a pile of horse-shit but they kept up the pretence, Bobby never mentioning his latest hunts or the news of strange goings on and Dean never mentioning the hole in his chest that just seemed to gape wider with every passing week. It was a good system.
That, at least, got a reaction out of Cas. His eyebrow twitched up slightly which Dean took to mean this was big news.
“About the same. I told you he’d returned home last time you texted, and Michael has gone home to Raina and the girls. Some spasticity in the left arm but nothing that’s impairing his movement as yet. He has a physical therapist now who visits every other day.”
“What are you doing here?” Sam asked. Cas was surprised to hear anger in his voice. He turned to find Sam’s whole body had changed. He was suddenly taller, broader, more solid as he faced his brother. His mouth was a stiff line and his expressive eyebrows were drawn together in a stern frown.
But it was something he wanted. He wanted a future where he made his own decisions. Where he made his own way. He wanted to become something, even if the breadth of choice was intimidating. He stared at a photo of a grinning student in a KSU sweatshirt and desperately wanted to be like her.
“How are things at the garage?” Talia asked, noting the past tense and smoothly changing the subject. No doubt Lisa had told her his brother was dead. Dean nodded gratefully and told her the latest gossip, how Leon’s wife had threatened to leave him if he didn’t come clean about the waitress at the waffle house.
A loud cheer from the bar had them all craning to see Gabriel standing on it, firing cookies from a tray into the waiting mouths of a group of half-drunk college kids. A pretty blond caught one in her teeth and another cheer erupted.
“No shit, Sherlock!” Gabriel cried, slapping Castiel’s bicep. When Castiel risked a look up at him Gabriel gave an outrageous roll of his eyes.
Gabe downed the whole thing in one go, his face pinching in distaste. “Ugh. I hate wine.” He complained. “Give me something sweet.”
“Here here.” Murmured Cas, drawing a laugh from Sam and Dean. Alfie swayed a bit unsteadily but Jo took his hand and dragged him back to their table. She gently pushed him back down into his seat and he watched with a stunned gape as she dragged a free chair over and placed in right next to his. When she planted her butt in the seat she looked up at him expectantly. He just goggled at her. With a dramatic sigh and a big eye-roll she gripped his wrist and slung his arm around her waist, slapping the back of his hand firmly to press his palm over her hip.
He managed to get to the bank and drag Cas out of the water, but he didn’t have the strength left in his legs to stand. He rolled Cas on his side, pounded his back, and tried not to panic at the huge amount of water that gushed out of his mouth. He waited, listening for any sound of Cas breathing. After a couple seconds Cas took a shuddering breath and Dean could too.
“They are unharmed.” Cas said from behind him. Dean jumped and spun, sinking the knife into Cas’s stomach before he had even registered the words.
Castiel looked up from the milk-logged cornflakes he was pushing around his bowl to find Gabriel staring at him, a familiar envelope clutched in one hand.
“She’s an angel and she’s sick.” Lisa told him primly, stroking Gabriel’s hair. Gabriel leaned into it like a smug cat.
And afterward, as he lay gasping and watching helplessly as Dean cleaned them both up with the same washcloth, Cas had felt something tighten behind his ribs. When Dean laid back down and gathered Cas close, smelling of sweat and sunshine, Cas felt warm all over despite the chill in the room. And now, stretched out with Dean’s hand gently cupped over his hip, Cas felt right.
“Oh, my.” Cas said, unthinkingly leaning back from the stench. Both of them would have spilled to the floor if he hadn’t met with Sam’s shaggy bulk directly behind him. He hadn’t noticed Sam follow him but he was glad of the helping hand as he braced Gabriel.
Still, Castiel did what he could to raise their spirits, and at the very least everyone here would go away with a full stomach. The other volunteers did the same, treading the line between cheerful and somber as they chatted amongst themselves and with the visitors.
“Are you alright?” Cas asked softly, sparing a glance for Dean as he whined and rolled closer into the seam of the futon.
Castiel frowned. “Whether her advice is to be trusted or not, we already knew Raphael and his followers might come for you if they suspected I was in contact with you again. It is one of the reasons I did not come to see you.”
Dean snorted. “I can count the number of real dates I’ve had on one hand and I don’t think a single one of them could be called a ‘great time’.” Sam tilted his head back and forth with that splayed frown that said ‘you have a point there’. “Besides, none of them were with a dude.” Sam went full-on puppy face and Dean threw up his hands. “Don’t start.”
“I’ll try, Dean.” Cas’s fingers brushed over Dean’s knuckles where they rested on his shoulder before he turned and disappeared through the door to Gabe’s apartment.
For a while Dean just lay there, slowly stroking Cas’s forearm and thinking about the night before. It had been great. They’d made out a little - ok, a lot - ordered terrible Chinese food and fallen asleep three movies into a Bond marathon. It meant his morning breath was enough to make him gag - hunan spicy beef and no toothbrush had been a bad choice - but that was small potatoes compared to the rest of it. Dean tried to remember the last time he’d enjoyed a movie night with a girlfriend that much. Or greasy take out. Hell, when was the last time he enjoyed making out with anyone that much?
“Hey!” Gabriel raised his hands to ward off Castiel’s glare but he was still laughing. “All those times I let you stay over with your older boyfriend? You think I’d let some creeper perv on my little bro if it wasn’t legal? No freaking way!”
“Gabriel’s idea of kind does not exactly match the rest of the world’s. I’d rather not explore that any more than I have to just now.”
Lisa waited for him to continue but when it became clear he had stalled again she prompted him gently. “What had you started?”
Lisa cracked a smile. “Wax on, wax off?” she suggested, waving her hands in front of her like a very attractive windmill. Dean chuckled. He was feeling a little better, having worked the edge off his frustration.
“Come on, Bobby, please?” Dean pressed his hands together in mock prayer. He tried out the closest thing he could muster to Sammy’s puppy dog eyes, sure that it wasn’t even half as effective on his face. “The kid’s had a rough month. He’s Sammy’s friend and he’s helping him keep on the straight and narrow. Just give him a shot?”
Dean chuckled. “You’re welcome. And don’t expect another chance to drive my baby any time in the near future, got it? Don’t think I didn’t feel you hit the gas to make that yellow light.”
“So,” The look on Lisa’s face said clearly that she couldn’t believe the sentence coming out of her mouth and Dean bit his lip to ward off a hysterical laugh, “Sam being back from the dead isn’t a good thing?”
“Olives are good for you.” Sam informed him, actually drooling at the smell of green peppers. He could survive a few slices without olives. Definitely.
“And you went to private schools?” Alfie asked. Dean wondered if he were guessing. Seemed like a fair guess, with Cas.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Of course there is.” He said. “And why the hell would you think we’d help a witch?”
“Gabriel.” Not-Sam said, perfectly calm as the angel’s anger threatened to warp reality. “Might be a good idea to take it down a notch.”
.” Raphael murmured, sliding his hand from Rigby’s knuckles to his wrist. He kept the knife where it was, but pulled Rigby so the skinnier boy was kneeling on top of Cas. Rigby’s shaking hand replaced Raphael’s around Cas’s throat and Raphael gripped Rigby’s shoulder. “If he hadn’t paraded his fairy ass around school, made a complete ass out of you every time you tried to take him down a peg, you wouldn’t have to do this.”
Brady bumped his arm, drawing his attention and offering a tight smile. Sam returned it, hoping Brady could feel the gratitude bleeding off him. They hadn’t talked about it, not even in August. But he knew Brady knew what this game meant. Sam hadn’t been sure in the fall if they would take him back. After the shit he pulled last year he wouldn’t have blamed any of them if they had wanted him off the team for good. Especially Brady. Sam wouldn’t have blamed him if Brady never wanted to talk to him again. But he hadn’t done that. Brady had been the first to encourage him to come back.
Cas glanced from Sam’s face to his forearm, calculating. Without a word he slashed out, the tip of his blade flashing as it neatly sliced through Sam’s skin. Dean lunged forward to grab at Sam and yank him back but it was unnecessary. Cas took a quick step back and Sam just winced. A single fat drop of blood gathered along the little cut, running down the curve of his arm to hang dark from his elbow.
Dean laughed and leaned across the table, placing a wet kiss on her wrinkled cheek. “I fucking bet.” He said, pinching her chin in his fingers.
Dean and Cas slipped out into the deceptively pleasant afternoon air and slunk silently around the side of the house to the garage. It was a small, slapdash shingle building with only room enough for one car. Lisa had never used it before Dean moved in - it creeped her out - so it was easy enough for Dean to back Baby in, cover her over with a tarp and lock the door. He knelt, forcing the gnarled key into the massive padlock that held the door down. That done, he rolled the door up a few feet as quietly as possible and ducked underneath. Cas popped through, the bastard.
“Unlike you lot, I haven’t been sitting around diddling myself since the Moose took a swan dive.” Dean was sure the demon’s sharp eyes didn’t miss his full-body flinch even as he turned his smile on Cas. “Your big brother Lucifer left quite a hole in our ranks when he let the Winchesters pull their little hail Mary. When his devotees learned that their horse had stumbled in the last furlong they were just a tad unhappy.”
, Cas.” He breathed, gripping the comforter tight enough to whiten his knuckles. “I swear to God you’re going to kill me.”
He put the bottle down before he noticed Cas staring again, but he’d gotten pretty used to the kid’s lazer-eyes over the last few days so it didn’t really matter.
He reached the refrigerated cases that lined the back wall of the store and began slowly trailing down the line. He had located the cream and was reading the labels on the butter. There were at least a half dozen brands, each with several different labels Cas didn’t understand the significance of. Was “creamiest” better than “even smoother”?
Dean shook his head, too angry even to glare at Sam. “Got any holy oil?” he growled, staring over their heads instead. There was a flake of battered paint sort of shaped like Wisconsin near the top corner of Bobby’s door frame. Dean focused on that instead of the pain in his knuckles as he gripped Sam’s coat too tightly.
“A stroke.” Gabriel repeated. How the hell was he supposed to feel about that? Eli Novak had been dead to him for a while now, awakening only to piss him off all over again by driving Castiel out into the night almost ten years later. Gabriel never had any intention of seeing the man again or letting him have anything close to a toehold in his life ever again. The man was a controlling, dogmatic prick and he had nothing to offer Gabriel that he wanted any part of. He’d made peace with that. Or, at least he’d thought he had. Apparently not.
By the time Castiel had filled Lucifer in on nearly all that had happened since he left Connecticut it was nearly ten o’clock and Cas was yawning widely. Gabriel was slouched deep into this couch, his empty wine glass cradled against his thigh as he rolled a spent lollipop stick from one corner of his mouth to the other. Lucifer looked as prim and alert as ever but his eyes softened as Cas drooped on the arm of the sofa.
Gabriel’s eyebrows shot up when the box opened to reveal nothing more grand than a slim book. All Dean could make out were slashes of bright color and a small cartoon bird fluttering across the back.
“What?” Gabriel asked, sitting up straighter. “What’s going on?” If Lucifer were here to take Castiel home he’d have had a response prepared, something snappy and sufficiently legal-sounding to force Gabriel onto unsound footing. But he didn’t. Something was very wrong.
“I know that one.” Castiel murmured, as surprised as Dean. “Gabriel used to sing it to me sometimes.” He explained. “He said I was always more serious than kids had any right to be.”
“The fuck are you?” Dean asked, watching as she did it again. The second and third rawheads dropped beside the first, but because the universe couldn’t just lay the fuck off as soon as they were down something else rushed up the road. A wraith, her face hideously torn and her hair matted, came squealing through the darkness. She clambered over the dead rawheads and rushed them.
“The fuck?” Dean breathed. A girl stumbled out of the wrecked car, a frizz of blond curls glowing in her headlights. She shook herself and looked back at the rawhead she’d maimed, which was already getting slowly to its feet.
Dean grimaced, wishing Ben didn’t look thrilled shitless at the idea. “Not sure yet, kid. I hope not. Still got your charm on?” he checked, relieved when Ben pulled it out again. “Good.” Ben nodded vaguely, looking around at the improvements Dean had made to security. Lisa was also looking at them, her expression a mixture of wonder and disgust.
“It’s not safe for you to leave the wards if you’re already compromised.” He said in his most serious tone.
Dean nodded. “Sounds perfect, man.” He said softly, hoping Gabe was too drunk to catch the tears welling in his eyes.
“Henry trapped her in it.” Ganem said, “It was an incredibly draining spell and he nearly died in the attempt, but I leant him my voice and we managed it together.”
Gabriel shook his head. “I still don’t trust this new leaf you’re suddenly turning over. You wouldn’t risk coming out here and pissing off dear-old Dad if there weren’t something in it for you.”
“Shut up.” Dean muttered, adjusting his cuffs. It felt ridiculous to have something clamped around his wrists like that, like he was some yuppie dick. Instead of just a regular dick. He settled for rolling them up around his elbows, hoping Cas wouldn’t mind.
“That’ll be hell on your knees.” He explained. He didn’t particularly feel the need to fill Cas in on which of his old flings had told him exactly how uncomfortable it was to give head sometimes - or how he knew first-hand, come to think of it - but he was going to make sure Cas was comfy. “C’mon, sit up and I’ll show you.”
And that’s where Dean had pretty much lost the thread. Cas, his teeth sticking to the shell of Dean’s ear as he grinned, had kept one hand firmly in Dean’s hair and slipped the other one around to the front of Dean’s jeans. His fingers had found Dean’s mostly soft cock easy enough and just squeezed. Lightly, sure, but Dean would deny the high-pitched squeak it forced out of him until his dying day.
After a tense millisecond surprise flashed over the angel’s face, then disgust. “No!” he spat, so emphatically that Dean let out a breath. Of course he wound’t say yes. Cas looked pissed that Dean would even ask the question. “It’s blasphemy, for a start.”
For a moment he lay gasping while his sweat and come cooled, floating on a gentle wave of euphoria. Then, as the haze over his eyes began to clear he sighed.
“And have Ellen put my nuts in a vice for serving a minor in her bar? No dice, Novak.” Dean grinned.
Cas ducked, planting his palms and swinging his shin out to catch Rigby in the ankles. Rigby stumbled back, slamming against the lockers with a grunt. Cas spared a thought to be glad he hadn’t yet changed back into the fitted jeans Gabriel had insisted on all those months ago; his fencing breeches allowed for much more movement. He let his momentum go, pulling back to his feet and bringing his fist up into the kidney of the dark-haired boy pinning Alfie to the wall. Sanz turned and swung for Castiel’s gut just as Rigby regained his feet and levelled a punch at Castiel’s head. Cas managed to dodge Sanz but caught Rigby’s fist in the eye, feeling the skin along the bridge of his nose burst in a spray of blood. He ignored the pain, breathed through his mouth and brought his elbows in to protect his core, thrusting his knee up into Rigby’s crotch and stomping down on his foot. Sanz battered at Cas’s hands where they caged to protect his head but luckily he didn’t seem to know how to throw a decent punch.
“Isn’t that sweet.” Gabriel cooed, flicking Sam’s hair from his eyes and staring at Dean with something very close to Sam’s “puppy face”. On Gabriel it looked more wolfish than puppy. It was quite unsettling, actually. “Deany-bear found a new baby bear to cuddle all better.”
Crowley sniffed the air, his shoulders sinking in disappointment. “Ah. Not related by blood. What a shame. I could have used some fresh Winchester blood. For all sorts of games.” He popped the candy into his own mouth, the pink bow getting caught in his artful stubble.
“If you’ll excuse me, gentlemen, I’m going to go make sure this is dealt with. I’d like you to stay in here until I return. Both of you.” Under other circumstances Castiel might have been impressed with Chuck’s sudden switch from mild affability to this new business-like manner. As it was he was still seething, too distracted by his anger to care.
Cas… Cas had been raised in a rich religious bubble. He’d shown up out of the blue with no idea how to navigate a public high school in the midwest. He’d shown up with his wingtips and pressed trousers, his piercing stare and his tendency to say exactly the wrong thing, and just been thrown to the sharks. And that backbone, the one that had told him walking out into the night with nothing and nobody and nowhere to go was the
“I accidentally agreed to a date with a girl in my class.” Castiel explained quickly. “She’s coming here for coffee and I’m not sure how to explain that I misunderstood the invitation.”
our father. I have never, ever felt for you what I feel for him. Even when we were children. I doubt I ever can.”
“What’s he done now?” They looked up to find Jo dropping her book bag in an empty chair. Alfie immediately popped up and pulled the chair beside him out for her. She raised an eyebrow at him as she sank down, a tiny smile twitching her lips.
“Nah,” Dean shook his head and motioned to door. The booze just made it worse, made it easier to slip into the dreams of Hell, of Sam tearing his fingers bloody on the bars of the cage. “I’ll clean up this mess and redraw the salt-line. You should get back to sleep.”
Dean snorted. “You can swear, Lis. He’s an angel, not a schoolmarm. Although sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference with him.”
Dean laughed. He stroked his hand across Cas’s chest, drawing a little sound as his fingers brushed Cas’s nipple. “Sort of.” Dean agreed. “But it’s more than that. Yeah, I’ve got a general idea what sort of touches might rev your engine. I know my way around another body, even if it’s got a few different parts.” He grinned and bumped his hips against Cas’s, drawing a little laugh. “But Cas, I’ve never… I don’t…” It was Dean’s turn to stumble, the blush returning. “I’ve never done
” He took a sip of his too-hot coffee, letting it burn its way down his throat in a painful streak. “But he didn’t. Instead he said ‘she has her reward now in Hell’.”
He stood, brushing water droplets from his jeans and looking up and down the road. Not a car in sight, no signs. Not even a mile marker. There was a guardrail across from the hill he’d tumbled down, more trees on the other side.
Cas just looked calmly back at him, for once letting his “creepy stare” work in his favor. Raphael’s smile faltered slightly but he pressed on.
“Or maybe that’s why he lets you stay with him, hu?” sneered the taller boy, brushing his lips against Cas’s ear. “Free blow job with a dozen cupcakes? Spring for two dozen and they can bend you over the counter?”
Dean watched in horror as the whole damn river raised from its bed, arching up over the bridge like a great looming beast. Dean clamped his hand through Cas’s belt and held him as close as he could. The river hung suspended for about three seconds before it came crashing down, sweeping Dean, Cas, and the hellhounds all away.
“Anyway,” Dean breathed, shaking himself. Cas retreated back into his own space. “I’d do anything for Sammy, because Sammy’s the one that deserves it. Our dad doesn’t. I love them both, ‘cause they’re my family, but my dad doesn’t get the ‘drop everything’ treatment anymore.”
Not that he’d been expecting Cas. Of course. He was still pissed as hell at the kid and from the total lack of texting and calling it seemed like Cas was probably still pretty angry, too. When had he gotten used to hearing from Cas multiple times a day? When had he started relying on it? Dean shook his head.
“The red one!” The girl hollered, pointing to a car on the edge of the parking lot. Sam hauled Dean to it and threw him against the back door. Sliding across the hood Sam jumped int he passenger’s seat as the girl slipped behind the wheel.
“Yeah? You… doing ok?” Dean pulled back onto the road, carefully studying the street signs instead of his brother. Sam stared at him for a moment before he let his head drop against the window.
“Sure thing.” Raphael nodded, clapping Alfie hard on the shoulder as he turned away. The look he gave Castiel promised future punishment for his bravado, but Castiel found he didn’t particularly care. Something about the terrified gleam in Sam’s eye was pulling at him, drawing any concern away from his own predicament.
Nikki flopped her head back dramatically. “This one reads minds, aparently.” She hitched her thumb at Cas.
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas patted his arm and turned his eyes away again. “Oh, dear.” He sighed, catching a flash of red hair.
Cas sighed. “Not particularly. The chubby man was quite funny in the cafeteria scene, but other than that I didn’t really understand it.”
Dean sighed as he cracked open a few ginger ales. “You’re such a girl.” He accused and tried not to think about the last night he’d served Gabe one of those. That was the night of Gabe’s tearful drunken soliloquy (and Dean was blaming Sam’s raging dorkgasms for him even knowing that word). That had been a rough night for everybody. “Anything with sugar and you’re on it like a frigging wasp.”
“Anael has taken charge of his work for he time being while he rests. The doctors have advised him to avoid stress while they try to pin down the cause of this episode. Michael is, of course, managing his finances and organizing his care. I have helped him make out a will.” For a brief moment something close to anguish passed over Lucifer’s face but then it was gone.
Cas only squeezed his hand and walked away. It was probably the better option, Dean had to admit. He doubted the weird silence his coworkers had decided to employ would stand up to Dean shoving Cas up against the door of a car and kissing him silly. He watched Cas swing his coat around his shoulders and returned the tiny wave Cas threw his way.
Dean smiled and clapped Cas on the shoulder, letting his fingers dig into the muscle a little deeper than he probably should. “Me too, buddy.” He said. “See you Tuesday?”
It was childish and cruel but Castiel couldn’t help himself. There was a much longer pause before Dean replied.
“Don’t you need to get upstairs?” Dean asked curiously, pointing upward. “Won’t they notice you missing? And weren’t you going to check on that chatter you caught earlier?”
Gabriel shrugged. “Hate to sound like a broken record but I have no idea. I just… knew it was here. Must have left myself a clue somewhere along the way but one of the first whole thoughts I remember having was that I had to get to a Winchester and get here.” Cas had pursed his lips, considering. “And of course the second I saw it, all lit up with Wonderboy’s name here,” Gabriel swung her arm to indicate Dean and shrugged, letting the thought dissolve.
From where he’d stashed himself beside the door Sam glanced at Dean and Dean just shrugged, not really sure what to do about the little reunion taking place in their kitchen. Before he could decide the brunette pushed Nikki away and brushed a hand hastily across her eyes.
Without another word Finnerman marched out of the kitchen, the door swinging viciously behind him. Gabriel took a deep, shuddering breath before Cas heard something metal crash to the ground. His older brother was angry.
Sam’s whole body softened, his nostrils shrinking back closer to their usual size. “Dean.” He sighed. “Cas is really upset.”
Balthazar barked out a strangely harsh laugh. “Oh no. That one came straight from Heaven, Cassie, darling.” He said, and took flight.
“Nah.” Sam slouched back, rubbing at his belly. “Jo was gonna meet me here after the field hockey try-outs to go over the reading list. Then we were going to head over to Gabe’s.”
Sam laughed. “Keep the PDA to a minimum. I don’t think Ash or Benny need to see you getting your grope on.”
Sam sighed but broke into the muffin and Dean tugged Cas over to the chair. Dean sat back down and Cas perched on the arm, wishing really that he could crawl into Dean’s lap and kiss him a few more times. There would be time for that later, he was sure. He’d make sure.
Castiel pressed on, genuinely angry now. “If you feel such an overwhelming need to smooth over the feathers he ruffles and bind the wounds he goes around inflicting, my advice is that your time would be better spent new boyfriend and stop this foolish martyrdom.”
“We’ve never seen any marks or anything.” Jo said, watching as Amelia and her friend squeezed into a table near the register.
Cas’s mouth was at his ear, soft, gentle pants driving Dean straight up the wall and burning anything left of sleep right out of his head. “Dean.” Cas’s hips pushed harder into Dean’s side and dear god Dean needed to stop this right the fuck now.
“‘Cause I’m sure that’s what he needed to hear.” Sam groaned. He could see it, Cas bruised and frustrated, Dean desperately trying to force down the memory of the worst day of their lives. Both of them scared and not knowing what to do about it. Gunpowder and a spark. Jesus.
It had been two weeks since the fight at the park and Castiel’s nose was finally healing. Rigby’s knife had sliced clean through his nostril just above where it connected to the rest of his face. Eighteen nearly microscopic stitches from a plastic surgeon and strict instructions not to sneeze if he could possibly help it had set him on the path towards healing, but he’d been told it would likely leave a faint scar.
A tall brunette in a navy-blue uniform with a supremely unimpressed scowl on her face stood outside, hands on hips.
“And watch this.” Sam said, stepping over to the bookshelves. He reached his hand out, slowly and gently, towards a mouldering old clothbound book wider than Dean’s fist. When his hand was an inch away it stopped, his fingers crumpling and folding down as if they’d hit a wall. He set his palm flat against the invisible barrier and pushed, but it didn’t move.
“Bobby’d towed her to the shop. I’d been holding it together around Sam. Just… put my head down and bowled through with the whole ‘we’ll figure it out’ mindset. But then I saw her sitting there, blood everywhere, barely even a car anymore. Just a lump of metal. Just broken and dead. And I… I freaked out. I smashed in the one window that was still there. I banged up what what left of the roof with a tire iron. I screamed myself hoarse. I was so… angry. Angry I hadn’t protected him. Angry he hadn’t let me. Angry my dad didn’t give a damn enough to even
“Dean!” Sam snapped, gripping his armrests. Dean could see him shaking, wanting to get up and stand toe-to-toe. He wanted to get in Dean’s face, shout him down the way he used to. But he was controlling himself, holding back. He wasn’t going to rise to the bait.
“Trying don’t caramelize the creme brulé, bud.” Gabriel told him as he crumpled all Dean’s hard work between his hands and chucked it at the counter. “As for the rest of them I’m going to get some clear twine and make a snowstorm over the register.” Gabe took Sam’s stack of snowflakes and carried them over to the counter to start attaching different lengths of twine. Dean definitely did not pout. He scowled in a very manly, mature, adult way as Gabe climbed up on the counter to start hanging them. Stupid snowflakes.
“I’m afraid that would be a very bad idea, Dean.” Cas said, his eyes locked on the back of Gabriel’s head. “If contact with holy fire can cause that kind of instability I don’t know what my grace might do to her. I think I should probably avoid touching her at the very least.”
Sam was already jogging down the overgrown bank toward them. He skidded to a halt when he caught sight of Cas laying like a dead fish on the shore. He paused and his face went stony before he kicked back into gear. He pushed past Dean and hoisted Cas like it was nothing, carrying him up the bank towards the car. Dean stumbled after him, pausing when the back door opened and Kevin stepped out.
They sat for a while, just silent. Dean picked at his fries and Bobby chewed his burger thoughtfully. Dean tried hard not to feel the weight of the empty booth beside him, the hulking space that should have been filled.
“But you don’t believe that.” Dean guessed. He didn’t really believe it himself. Raphael had been a douche-wad in only the way an archangel could be but he’d been pretty straight up about his evil plans. A bastard, yes, but a sneaky bastard, no.
“Injured.” He admitted sourly. It still rankled to think how he’d let those idiot goons of Raphael’s get the drop on him, even months later.
Dean sucked in a breath. “Out?” he repeated stupidly. The flare of raw hatred in his chest was making it hard to think. The bitch was out. Not locked away where she couldn’t get her hooks back into Sam. Out.
Dean balanced his chin on Cas’s sternum at looked up at him with eyes turned nearly neon by the slanting rays of sun through the windshield. “I guess… I guess I don’t get it.” He said, and there was something like fear in his expression. Cas stroked his cheek with one finger and Dean bit his lip. His next words came out so soft Cas wasn’t sure he’d heard them right. “I mean, it’s just love, right? What’s the harm in that?”
“Oh really?” Sam snarked. “You haven’t been spending practically all of your free time with him for the last month and a half? You didn’t steal his new number from my phone so you could text him movie quotes he won’t get? You didn’t spend all last Sunday at the Roadhouse teaching him to play pool on your one day off? When was the last time you even went out for a drink with Benny? Or Ash? Or anyone?”
“Nikki went missing and Missouri pointed me in the right direction. Said to tell you ‘take care of those girls’.”
He ran all the way to Reynard’s with his arms aching and his head pounding. By the time he spilled through the door he could barely breath and he collapsed in a chair near the door, barely registering the chatter around him. It was fairly empty, he thought, and he was grateful for that.
A sharp pang echoed through his chest - his actual physical chest - as his grace rippled out around him with a forlorn clang. Sam Winchester. His friend who, even with his restored grace, Castiel could do
Cas did some weird combo of shaking his head and shrugging, a startlingly human gesture. Dean grinned and the worried knot in his chest loosened. Maybe Cas wasn’t totally back to being a celestial stormtrooper quite yet. “No matter what else he is Raphael has always been obedient. He would not defy our father’s wishes that way, I am sure of it.”
to you?” It seemed Dean might as well have said Lucifer had stripped naked and taken a shit on the bar the way Anna’s eyes tried to roll out of her head.
“Likewise.” Dean smiled, steering Cas towards his bedroom. “We’ll leave you two to the whipped cream. Just here to get my birthday present and then I’ll be off.”
“And isn’t that refreshing?” Anna murmured, a hard set coming to her face. Dean raised an eyebrow. Looked like another Novak sibling had the whole “mild-mannered exterior but don’t you dare fuck with me or I will end you” thing going on. There was a story there, Dean was sure.
Sam nodded to himself. That’s what Ruby really was to him. A filter that distilled every nasty, self-destructive habit he already had - Dean too - and sealed it up in a nice little bottle, tucked a rag in and let him molitov his life. She wasn’t the cause of bad things, but she was the highway that let him put the pedal to the floor. And he didn’t want that anymore.
“I still can’t believe you don’t have a cell phone.” Jo shook her head as Cas inexpertly navigated to the dial pad.
“Where is Sam?” Cas choked. His fingers curled in the denim covering Dean’s thigh to steady himself. He pulled, hauling himself upright and nearly dragging Dean to the ground in the process. Dean’s eyes were wide and wet, frightened.
Sam cut him off with a vicious swipe of his arm. “I’ve told you before, I made my own decisions. I made my own mistakes. She didn’t help, but Dean that was
“Android.” Raphael said pleasantly. Rigby, Sans, and two boys Castiel did not know the names of stood behind him, all glaring at him with venom in their eyes.
“Nah.” Sam sighed. “I get it, man. Just try not to get upset if he flirts with you a little hard. He flirts with everyone. It's just his way. He really doesn’t mean to be a jerk.”
The boxes and ticks were starting to blur together before he finally decided that you know what, he’d rather be audited than sit here another minute working on this shit. He hit save and sighed as the pinter whirred to life, scrubbing a hand over his face. His back popped in time with the creaking chair as he stretched, glancing up at the Woody Woodpecker clock he’d found at a yard sale. He’d have to be in the shop in a few hours, he realized. No real point going to bed now.
Dean gave an ugly snort. “Not sure I’d use that phrasing exactly. But Cas here pulled me out. After I’d already started up the END, but, you know.” Dean decided to ignore the brief flash of pain on Cas’s face. He could apologize later for rubbing at sore spots.
“Hi, um,” she fidgeted, twisting a lock of hair around her finger and tugging. “I saw you at Reynard’s the other night. I just wanted to say, uh, I heard about what Raphael did Monday.”
Dean and Sam made identical noises that Cas wasn’t sure how to interpret. Humor? Disbelief? He was too tired to parse it out. “Don’t think there will be a ‘next time’ anytime soon, Cas.” Sam grumbled.
The wind had died down since the afternoon but a crystal thin chill had settled in the air, stabbing at Castiel’s nostrils as he followed Dean to the impala. The car was warmer, the heat of Dean’s drive over still lingering. Castiel settled into his seat, thinking that just over a day ago he had sat here content and secure.
Gabriel’s helpers are a little throwback to his first episode, “Tall Tales”. Curtis is the name of the frat boy he forces to slow-dance with an alien and Angela Case is the name of the actress who plays one of Gabe’s fabricated candy-and-lengerie girls.
Admittedly, she had a killer body. The way the cheap fabric had stretched across her hip when she crossed her legs, the not-at-all subtle display of cleavage as she leaned in closer to touch him…
problem, as in one I won’t touch with a ten-foot pole. The Apocalypse was great and all, but I’ve got my own interests now and that means I don’t have time to go flitting off with the Squirrel tracking down an imaginary Moose.”
Lucifer watched him go, shaking his head with a chuckle. “I’ve missed him.” He mumbled, and Castiel wasn’t sure whether the comment was directed at him or not. After a moment Lucifer turned to Cas, a trace of sadness in his eyes. “I’ve missed you, as well.” He said.
Bobby took it but shook his head with an ugly snort. “Bobby’s plenty formal for me, kid.” He said and Cas nodded. “You Castiel?”
“That’s wonderful.” Cas smiled. “You always had a knack for the artistic. What medium are you working with?” He could remember her coming home with stained fingers when she was in high school, hiding her ruined clothes in the garage from Mrs. Miggins until she could throw them away.
“That you need to get out of here.” Gabriel said, lifting out another present. This one was practically the size of the little guy’s torso and had about a thousand loops on the bow and some crinkly tinsel stuff tied in. “I am not about to have Ellen calling me trying to track your ass down because you can’t make your shift on time.”
Dean snorted. It was like the kid had emotional radar, he usually knew what was going on in people’s heads better than they did. “Yeah. And pissed, and homesick, and probably about ten-thousand other things. Kid’s been through the ringer. I’ll tell you Sam, when I realized it was his brother standing there all smarmy and suave, like he was just popping in for his usual weekly visit. And Cas’s face… I just about tore the guy a new one. Think I mighta scared him a little.” He didn’t bother to hide the satisfied grin that surfaced as he remembered the slight widening of Lucifer’s eyes as Dean had threatened to go Super Saiyan.
“And both will spill their guts for a twenty.” Sam flipped open his laptop and started rapid-fire typing. “Here, come look at this.”
Dean sighed, trying to relax his fists where they were clenched at his sides. “Yeah, I know, Sammy. Just, be smart, ok?”
At least Rigby and Sanz had been suspended. Sanz had gotten two weeks out-of-school to be followed by a month in-school and Rigby had gotten three weeks and a warning that his next mistake was going to lead to expulsion. It at least meant Alfie and Cas didn’t need to look over their shoulders quite so much, though with Raphael still roaming around they couldn’t relax completely. Weirdly, Kennedy didn’t seem that bothered by the whole thing; no poisonous glaring when he saw Castiel, no muttered threats when they brushed past each other in the halls. Once Sam even looked up to see Kennedy nod at Cas across the cafeteria, just a quick, sharp jerk of his blocky head. It was weird but if Kennedy had decided to give it a rest Sam sure as hell wasn’t going to argue.
“Fine, Cas.” He squeaked, “Just, uh, skipped my coffee this morning.” He lied. “Come on, let’s get in there before all the good seats are gone.”
Sam’s smile was a bit warmer now. “He was hoping I would come clean, ask for help. He could see me setting myself up for a hard fall, I think. But he never liked Ruby either so I just figured he was being a nosey bastard. I blew him off.” He sighed. “I blew everyone off. Over winter break I barely saw Dean at all, spent all my time with Ruby. She said it was time to celebrate so we partied like idiots. I got high for fun for the first time on New Year’s Eve. It was amazing. Ruby convinced me we had to let our hair down once in a while to keep from losing it,” Castiel shuddered as Lilith’s voice echoed in his head,
Dean’s finger snapped up to point at Bobby where he sat calmly. “No way, Bobby. Things are shitty enough right now without involving demons.”
