Lestrade did, and thankfully did explain, glaring all the while (although the effect was dampened considerably by the underlying hints of concern, but for what? Sherlock was fine). “I was wrapping up the paperwork for the last case - plenty of it, thanks to you - and packed up and left at about 11:58. I only stopped by the car to grab my apartment keys, although I was sure that I had them with me when I was doing the papers-” (He probably had, this was just a tactic to snatch him) “-when the door closed behind me and locked, and someone cocked a gun right by my ear. Let him do this-” he wiggled his hands and feet (which weren’t bound with the same metal, as Sherlock had thought, and instead were just duct tape. He started to tear the tape off as Lestrade continued) “-and then he called you. Held out a piece of paper with my lines, I recited them, and then he wrapped whatever that is-” he tilted his head at the

The phone hung up before Lestrade could offer any more hints, or before Sherlock could ask for any. He didn’t need to, though, it was clear where he was - Lestrade didn’t drive if he could help it, only owned the police car and left that at the yard. Sherlock didn’t pause before grabbing his coat and scarf, and rushing out the door (he wasn’t worried, just excited for the game to be on).
He wasn’t real.

“Sherlock really did teach you a thing or two about deductions, huh?” someone said from behind him, and John cut himself off abruptly to spin around and come face to face with Sally, who was looking equal parts annoyed and disappointed. John hadn’t known anyone had been listening to him. “I thought I told you to get a hobby before he could infect you, too.”
To Angie’s relief, he turns his piercing gaze off of her, but lands it on James instead, whose face has changed from gleeful to looking like a deer in headlights. Instead of keeping up the stare like he had with her, though, he maneuvers his face into a smile, and says, “Hello.”
James eagerly grabs onto the lolly, and then remembers his manners. “Thank you, mister!”

“John!” Sherlock had hissed at him, intent on complaining, but John had simply ignored him as he picked up construction paper and coloured pencils.

wear this same, soft, oatmeal-coloured jumped, to crime scenes, in the flat, on dates? (Blond hairs on the neckline, small tear at the hem from being snagged on one of Sherlock’s sharper experiments, and distinct smell of John all further proved his conclusion.)
When the urge does hit, as it sometimes does, they find that Sherlock isn’t as fast as he used to be, find that John’s punches don’t land as hard as they used to. With age comes difference, after all, and even after dealing with the elderly for years as a doctor, John hadn’t expected it to catch up with him so soon. Some things still haven’t changed, though. John’s marksmanship is still as accurate as ever, and Sherlock’s mind hasn’t diminished in the slightest.
Safaa drops down on James’s other side, pats his back and repeats, “It’s okay,” over and over again. James’s cries get quieter, but they don’t stop.
“A detective?” Safaa repeats. “Cool!”
“John,” he said to John’s prone figure laying on the ground (his knees, as close as possible to John without touching him, suddenly were wet as he kneeled in a pool of John’s blood, blood that should have been inside his body but- (unimportant, cease train of thought)). “John!”
Safaa looks at him disapprovingly, the same look she gives Kevin when he tries to take her spot at lunch. James, on the other hand, looks much more interested in the yeller than what had been yelled. “Was that your wife, mister? You have a ring, just like my parents do!”
So he closed himself off. He was a self-proclaimed sociopath, after all, he didn’t care. Maybe he’d care when he got John back (maybe he’d tell John he no longer considered himself married to his work-) but right now he had a case to solve, and he didn’t need emotions or sentiment to do that.

“Quite,” Sherlock drawls, giving John a smirk of his own, then heading to the kitchen to do what is usually John’s job. “Tea?”

John hums his acknowledgment, already grasping for a vase to put the flowers in, before pausing and taking another look at the flowers. “Wait, these didn’t come from the garden. Are these-?”
There are two men that live at the end of the road.
He had finally fallen back on flowers, something he had been hesitant to use ever since the rose petal debacle, since it wasn’t clear on whether or not John had disliked the petals, or if he just wasn’t a fan of flowers in general. He had been very receptive to the singular flower Sherlock had been offering him for the past week, however, so Sherlock wasn’t all too concerned about the bouquet he now held in his hands.
Sherlock receives his first clue in the form of one tied-up Detective Inspector.
Human chatter was something he had learned to tune out easily, along with the static noise of London that never faded - most speaking, yelling, honking, and beeping faded easily into the background, in one ear and then promptly shoved to the back of his mind to be deleted later.

He makes sure that the sound of his heavy sigh carries back to the three behind him before calling back, “Yes?” without stopping his quick strides.

The sound of the door unlocking drew his attention, and he headed towards the door to where John was taking off his coat after finishing his hours at the only doctor’s office in the town. It had been a slow day today, which meant mostly filing paperwork, something that John had never been a fan of. He much rather preferred working with patients, but for what reason, Sherlock still didn’t know. Was spending time writing and putting papers away really worse than being sneezed on and bothered by both kids and adults?
John shot another look around the room. No one was paying attention to Sherlock, which was doubly odd. Sherlock always commanded the eyes of everyone in the room, either by his dramatic fashion and billowing Belstaff, his quick deductions and clever mind, or his sharp insults and harsh jabs. Never had an entire room been so . . . indifferent to the tall man. Sherlock was also supposed to be dead, had been for a while

Sherlock debated not telling him what it was, but eventually he would need the Yard (not their help, but their resources) to help find John. “It’s John’s,” he said stiffly, watching as Lestrade’s eye widened.
he had returned to the internet for more clues.
Even as much as he thinks of 221B, even as much as he thinks about the men they used to be, flying through life, gun in hand, adrenaline high and in Sherlock’s case, so very clever, he knows he would never go back, now. Those years had been some of the best years of their lives, danger at every corner, but those years didn’t have to compete against where they were now.

“Yes, Moriarty has John,” Sherlock said, moving on Lestrade’s hands. It was a metal chain that seemed familiar, just as the jumper had.
Sherlock turned his attention to the fabric, starting to snap (he hated repeating himself), “What. Did. You-” only to be cut off as he realized what the restraint was: it was indeed clothing fabric, a jumper to be precise (not very effective), but what was startling wasn’t what it

“Mm. Asshole.”
Angie’s fine with that - she always prefers to hide, anyway. She doesn’t get a chance to check if Safaa or Ada wanted to be it before James is already counting down from twenty (something he is always rubbing in Safaa’s face, because she can’t do it. Safaa always gets mad at him for it.)
Angie and Jafar follow suit - most people answer the door on the first ring anyway, if they don’t answer on the second, they’re probably not there. Ada does the same, and James waits only a couple seconds more before also joining them, saying, “But everyone’s home on Halloween!”
So John fell into a comfortable routine. Morning he would wake up, greet Sherlock if he was there - unlike evenings, Sherlock’s appearance in the morning was iffy - and make him a cup of tea if he was feeling generous, leave for the clinic, and upon coming back, he’d clean up Sherlock’s still-full cup of tea, have a conversation with Sherlock as he cooked or ordered in and ate (if Sherlock was in a talkative mood), and then settle in for a quiet evening, Sherlock opposite him.
Now was not the time to ask him (for the 87th time), so instead, Sherlock greeted John with a kiss. John smiled against his lips, pulling away after a couple seconds. “You’re very forward today.”
She replies, also nervously, “I don’t know! I’m gonna- I’m gonna go get my mum!” Ada turns on her heel and runs back towards the houses. Angie tries to call after her, tell her to take her bike, it’ll be faster, but the words are drowned out by James. She wasn’t very loud, anyway.
Sherlock wants to send a glare at Veronica’s retreating back, but her presence has left a small, soft smile on John’s face that Sherlock’s presence has never done, and so instead he settles for a simmering disappointment and a return to the comfortable silence of before.

Fake-Sherlock kept talking and asking and just being there, and wouldn’t go away, and it grated on John’s nerves and his sanity more and more until-
Sherlock read and reread the messages - it was clear Moriarty had somehow, inexplicably, survived the gun to the face, but that puzzle was for another day - trying to deduce anything, anything at all, about what game Moriarty was playing this time. There was always a first clue, or a first move, that Moriarty had to make or give, but he hadn’t left . . . anything. There was no secret code in the words, nothing that Sherlock could use to-

He answered the call, jabbing at the screen, before holding the phone up to his ear and snapping, “What?” (He couldn’t even have texted, no, he had to call, despite knowing that Sherlock preferred to text.)

Unfortunately, before he knew it, the day was over and evening was near, and it was time to head back to the flat and face Sherlock, who would surely continue to try and persuade John that he was real, that he was back and there to stay. Maybe he should turn in early, he mused, walking up the seventeen steps. It was hours before he usually headed upstairs, but if it meant he didn’t have to hear what he

It was easy to give into his mind’s longing for having Sherlock back. It was easy to pretend that it really was Sherlock sitting across from him as he read the paper, easy to pretend it was Sherlock running his mouth as he made tea, easy to pretend that Sherlock had never really left at all. It was much easier to pretend than to try to fight his mind.
Sherlock's fingers had tightened noticeably against the mobile before suddenly relaxing as he locked it and thrust it into his coat pocket. “Move,” he snapped at Lestrade, no different than any other case, and Lestrade, knowing that getting insulted would only take up more valuable time (which seemed to be a lot more valuable, now that they were apparently on the clock) and energy, moved to the side. Sherlock bent down to peer inside the car, before calling over his shoulder, “Open all the doors. Check inside the car for anything out of the ordinary. This is my first clue, and since you offered no help, there must be something in here that wasn’t there before.”

It had been a nice case, nothing too complicated. After all the drama they had been through, it was great to have a classic puzzle like this again, where they could fall back into their old routine. Sherlock was always at least two steps ahead of everyone else, with John blindly following him and ready to throw both compliments and punches as needed. The case involved a good long chase across London and Sherlock crawling through a window and getting his hand cut on a shard of glass. It ended with Sherlock smugly spewing deductions and explaining details to John (and Greg who had turned up eventually) while John had the suspect pinned to the floor.

Ballet was his life, of course, and had been since he began his classes, almost 20 years now. He didn’t mind the hard work it demanded of him, but nights like these were his way of dealing with the scrutiny of his day job.

And so he had some extra energy left to go out.

Okay, I could use the atmospheric regulator to get the O2 out of the Hab. If there is no oxygen, the hydrogen is stable and safe and I can burn it without blowing up. The thing is that the dirt needs a little oxygen, or the bacteria will die. So I need to lower the oxygen level enough that I won’t explode, but have some left for the soil. Now what is the highest level of oxygen I can have without igniting the hydrogen?
We have to make difficult decisions, Gregory. It’s part of the job, I’m afraid.
John flushed. This was not going the way he had hoped. Save yourself, Watson.
Sherlock bowed his head, remembering where he was ,now: in his own room with John’s hands gliding over his sides, resting on his narrow hips. The cold dampness of the cellar in Serbia was a long way away.

We’d also need to steal a booster from the H.O.U.N.D. project. We don’t have the time to build one, and that’s the only one that could do the job.
Suddenly John was shoved back, his head hitting the brickwork hard, but the sensation of pain only added to the fire rapidly building low in his belly. Sherlock moved his lips down from John’s to place open mouthed kisses along his throat, pressing his tonue over his pulse point and tugging at his jumper to get better access to his collarbones. The scrape of teeth over his clavicle roused John out of his passivity. He grabbed Sherlock’s hips and drew them towards him, grinning up at Sherlock’s surprised gasp as he ground their bodies together. Bringing one hand up to pull at Sherlock’s curls again, he exposed his long pale neck and licked a hot stripe up towards his ear.
“Why did he wish you luck? You don’t have a date, do you?” he asked John, crossing the open office space to the lifts. John hadn’t been dating since the whole affair with Mary, but he was feeling better lately, so it was a possibility. Sherlock was prepared for it, but still the idea left him in a state of panic. John opened his mouth to answer, but then Donovan distracted them by tripping over a desk chair, sending manilla envelopes and papers flying and landing with her head in a paper bin.

John feels a fond smile spread on his face, and lowers his head, studying the hurried scrawl that is Sherlock’s handwriting. Sherlock launches into his lesson with enthusiasm. John’s honestly trying to pay attention to what Sherlock is saying, but he keeps looking at how he moves his hands, how his long and elegant fingers hold his pencil, how they wave through the air, underlining Sherlock’s explanation.

I’ve managed to attach the pop-tents to the Hab. It was frustrating at first, because in theory the airlocks from the pop-tents can connect to other airlocks. The only problem is that they were designed to use with the Rovers, and their airlocks are a lot smaller than the Hab airlocks, which would mean I’d lose a lot of air each time I want to go in - and I’ll have to go in at least once a day. Of course, in normal circumstances, there wouldn’t be any reason to attach pop-tents to the Hab at all.

He was wearing jeans and a fitted t-shirt that showed off his broad shoulders. Sherlock wondered why he was here alone. Maybe he was waiting for someone, a date; maybe he just wanted some stress relief. He could tell by the crease between his brows the stranger was worrying about something. Exams, perhaps. Or it could be his alcoholic sister, Sherlock mused, looking at the phone the man had just fished out of his pocket. No messages. Maybe his date had stood him up.

I’ll present it all to you in detail when we can meet up, but as you can observe in the attached satellite images the solar panels have been cleaned, there are pop tents set up next to the Hab and one of the Rovers has been moved. We’ve checked the mission logs to compare the current location with the last location Commander Sholto reported. But maybe the most telling evidence is the fact that there is no sign of a body.

In any case, because John isn’t predictable, it’s hard to figure out what exactly John would consider romantic. Sherlock had once read that scattering rose petals on the bed would be both romantic and seductive, but John had grumbled at the sight and immediately had started to clean it up before Sherlock had revealed his intentions. On the other hand, John was very pleased when Sherlock had applied his knowledge of chemicals to food and had cooked them dinner, even without the candles.

Angie knows that she doesn’t like new people - it had taken them forever to befriend her, and only recently has she stopped being so nervous around them. She tried to communicate to Ada that Doctor Watson is nice, but she doesn’t think the point gets across very well.

Doctor Watson/Mr. Holmes turns to look at James, who is still sniffling. Angie is glad that he’s (mostly) stopped crying. She hadn’t been sure what to do and it wasn’t a good feeling. “Well, that’s no good,” he says, lowering himself onto the floor carefully. He’s carrying a black box that Angie hadn’t noticed before, and he puts it on the ground next to him as he sits. “Don’t worry, I’m a doctor, we’ll have you patched up in no time.”
Sherlock had mentioned what was going on - Sherlock and Moriarty (who had survived? He shouldn’t have been as surprised as he was, given that Sherlock had survived as well, but surely shooting yourself in the head was harder to fake) were playing a

He wrenched them off of Lestrade’s wrists - “Sherlock, what-?” - and held them up to the light. There was no mistaking them, with John’s name written on them, glinting in the light.

Sherlock had tried to explain this to the two girls opposite Sherlock and John at the table, Larissa and Ally, as Ally drew a heart, clearly for her mum on her birthday. He had even shown them a picture from his book, but this had only frightened them, and John had told him to put the book away before they got in trouble). It’s for some holiday called
Exactly 23 seconds later (Sherlock hated to be wrong, but every second counted when it contributed to John Watson’s life) the ambulance pulled up and the men and women inside burst out, only one stopping to speak to Lestrade while the rest immediately ran to John, as they should.
“Well, I need the flowers to give to my husband-”
They wouldn’t exchange it for the world.
“Yeah, thanks.” There is the telltale sound of John settling into his armchair by the fireplace. From here, they will probably settle down for a relatively quiet evening. Sherlock will play his violin - he has been composing lately - and John will likely read the book he has been reading for the past two days. He is almost finished, and after that he might persuade Sherlock to walk around down the small streets with him, partly just to walk, partly to keep an eye out for any trouble (John has been restless lately, it might be time to call up Lestrade to see if he has any good cases for them). When they come back, he will check out the bees once more before they head to bed, John asking Sherlock to
Doctor Watson wipes both of his knees with the cloth quickly, and James is sniffling again at the end of it, but he hasn’t broken into tears. “There, sorry about that.

They each have one big smiley face in the center. Doctor Watson sticks them onto each knee, and then stands up with another smile, reaching into his black box

Sherlock Holmes is seven years old. His best friend, John Watson, is also seven years old, although he is exactly five months and three days older than Sherlock. That’s okay, though, because Sherlock is much smarter than John. He tells this to John all the time (usually when he’s explaining something that John doesn’t understand to him), but John doesn’t seem to mind. The other kids call him mean names when Sherlock does that. John never has.
“Why do you want flowers so bad, Mister?” James says, at the same time Angie asks, “Why not? Mr. Poppon likes everyone.”
“You can hear him too?” John heard himself say in a breathy whisper.
Sherlock connects his two lives, weaves them together seamlessly. He’s the one constant in a very unpredictable life and John loves him for it, loves him for so much more than it.

“First clue?” Lestrade had read the text, knew that this was all a game to Moriarty, but even Sherlock seemed to be accepting this as a scavenger hunt, a series of puzzles with John as the prize. Lestrade had known that Sherlock liked to play murder - how many times had he heard him cry “the game is on!” before dramatically bursting out of a crime scene, bloody Belstaff fluttering behind him? - but even now, with John’s life on the line, he was treating this just like any other case?

His hands immediately went to work at the fabric on Lestrade’s face. “What did you see?” Sherlock said (resisted the urge to ask if he was okay: what would that do? He had no physical injuries, and it was likely not in the top ten most traumatic things that had happened to the DI).

He frowned, trying to think back at what he had ignored while he was looking at the fingernail-bacteria.

There were few things that could break Sherlock Holmes’s concentration.

“Donovan,” came another voice from across the room, this one Greg’s, who shot Sally a warning look before turning to John. “John, how’ve you been? I haven’t seen you at a crime scene, since, well . . .” He trailed off awkwardly, and John wanted to ask him what he was talking about, why did he still look so sad and so awkward when Sherlock was right there, right in front of the body?
“What are you doing?”
Already, Lestrade was feeling overwhelmed, and that wasn’t something he admitted easily, especially in the presence of Sherlock. Even following Sherlock for the short time that he had, had him privy to a glimpse of the minds of two geniuses - even if one was a notorious criminal - and the games the two played, how they danced around each other and how Moriarty almost
“There is no wife,” Safaa snorts. “Just two husbands.”
“Hey, freak!” Sherlock rolls his eyes and keeps walking - after the first three times Sebastian had used the same nickname, it had lost its already minimal sting. “You, freak!”
“Good-bye, Mister!” “Bye!” “Good-bye!”
Jafar only looks more nervous that he already was, and Angie doesn’t know if she’s allowed to say anything to him. Her mum had always told her not to talk to strangers, but Doctor Watson or Mr. Holmes wasn’t really a stranger, if she (kind of) knew his name?
Safaa looks skeptical. “But there are only three of us.”

John had left to go out for drinks with Lestrade (at approximately 9:42pm - it was currently 12:00am. John probably wouldn’t be back for another 30 to 55 minutes, depending on how nice it was outside).
(John would have, he is sure.)
“From Mr. Poppon’s, yes,” and then, anticipating John’s next question, “one of the young girls down the street gave them to me after speaking to me the day before. She was scared of me, along with her friends, before, and were making a conscious effort to avoid me. However, after speaking to me for exactly four minutes and 23 seconds, they changed their minds.

John turned from where he was making a beeline to the kitchen to flash Sherlock a glare that had battle-hardened soldiers quivering in their boots, only to be cut off by a knock at the door. John heaved a heavy sigh as he went to open it - trying to ignore Sherlock’s presence was always difficult, doubly difficult on days like these.
We’re going to find John in 24 hours or else,” Sherlock ripped the glovebox open, which would look frantic if it was anyone else, but Sherlock was always like this, especially on a case.

But someone’s already in the flowers. It’s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, his long limbs tucked compactly together as he squats down. He seems to be surveying the flowers in front of him, and as Angie watches, he picks three or four of the lilies and turns his attentions to the roses.
“Don’t point, honey,” her mum says first, and so Angie drops her arm obediently. Only then do her mother’s eyes stray to the two men, and she smiles as she watches the two of them walk. “Doctor Watson and Mr. Holmes? Yes, they’re married.”

but James talks over him. “D’you think he’ll tell us detective stories, if we ask?”
Lestrade hated it when people called Sherlock inhumane or a machine. He had seen Sherlock at his lowest - doped up on drugs, rocking back and forth in an alley, covered in sick and mud and dirt and tears, muttering nonsensically - and knew Sherlock definitely felt more than he let on. His earlier outburst was clear proof of that, but suddenly, Sherlock was just as cold and closed off as he was for every other case.
“I am - and I have,” Sherlock had murmured after a split second. “Moriarty is losing his touch. This is obvious, too obvious. We will have John back in only a few more hours, if that.” Before Lestrade could even ask what was so obvious about the little information they had been given, Sherlock had already whipped out his phone, sent Moriarty the answer.
sherlock & lestrade are good friends even if neither of them know it pass it on.
not sure how much I liked this one? but hey I actually have the rest of this planned out so I might as well release the next ones too.
Sherlock had never done that before, but there was a first time for everything, he thought. “Sherlock?”
He had appeared at the end of the aisle as John was debating over wholemeal or white bread. He was in the same red shirt, Belstaff, and scarf as he had been at the crime scene only two days earlier. As soon as John spotted Sherlock, Sherlock started walking - prowling - towards him, and John almost wanted to flinch back, to get away from the fake Sherlock his mind had conjured up, but there was another person in the aisle with him, and he didn’t want to scare her away by flinching away from nothing, so instead he just turned back to the bread. Wholemeal was more expensive, but it was supposed to be healthier.

It was as if the DJ had read his mind, because the lounge music was replaced with an enthusiastic voice introducing the first song, and the soft tones of a slow dance. Sherlock rolled his eyes and sat back, while the girls of the bachelorette party were apparently trying to get their wasted friend to dance with the cutest available male as a dare. He turned back to his drink, hoping the DJ would keep the slow dances to a minimum.
“I’ve hurt you so much,” John whispered into his skin, not talking about the bullet. “But I didn’t know, Sherlock, I didn’t.”
Anyway, in addition to all of that, I also have our spare suits. Everyone had two, but of course the crew left in theirs, and mine didn’t survive the antenna disaster. But I have the spare suits to do EVA’s (Extravehicular Activities) with. I did one to check on the rest of our equipment. So far:
I drove around with it a bit to see if it was secure enough and it didn’t budge. Also tested the rover with the second battery and did a system check: everything works the way it’s supposed to. Alright!

Irene: God, that will be the shortest statement ever. And a depressing one at that.

John really enjoyed their usual languid kisses, the way Sherlock could melt against him, the softness. That was a Sherlock only John got to see, and it was a small miracle how tender and fragile he allowed himself to be at those times. But this, this was why he wanted to be with Sherlock - the puzzles, the adrenaline kick, the frantic energy. Making himself useful, being in danger and being dangerous in turn. It made him want to be alive. It made him want to feel everything at once.
Mycroft: Thank you, Molly. Sherlock, I’d like to see you in my office, please.
John hums in agreement.
Sherlock closed his eyes against what he knew would happen next.
I hate chemistry.
Mike: Well, the Mars Pathfinder was launched in 1996, but we lost contact with both the lander and the rover in ‘97.
John is unable to move, pinned by those sharp eyes, and his throat isn’t working. He can only sit there and wait.
Sherlock’s expression suddenly changes from accusing to something like fear and a faint pinkness colours his cheeks.
I could use his help, actually. Need to get a favor from Mycroft.
I think I’ll make sure I have the basics covered (food and energy) and then I’ll have to find a way to fix the communication. I realise the Hermes will already be on its way back to Earth, but maybe if I could contact them, the people at NASA could think of something…
Sherlock looks up sharply at the question, before his gaze flicks to the window, where he can just see the hive boxes at the back of their garden. The sunlight makes his face seem soft and warm, and for a second he looks young again.
Michael,
Okay. I had a good night sleep and I’ve checked all the supplies and did a quick system check.
Sherlock’s eyes are too closeby to focus on, so John closes his against the blur of green and grey. Then he moves his head fractionally, bumping his nose into Sherlock’s and seeking his lips with his own. Their mouths are just touching, lightly, and John’s chest feels too small for his heart. His hands feel clammy, and he shifts restlessly, trying to wipe them on his jeans.
“Sherlock, what…” Breath left John’s lungs in shock, warm and damp against Sherlock’s collarbone. His voice was raw. Arousal mingled with dawning understanding.
Date: Jan. 23
He sure has spirit! Let’s hope he can keep it up until there is a rescue plan!
“Morning, Sally”, Sherlock addressed the soles of her shoes. She spluttered weakly, trying to get back on her feet.
Hey crew,
Poor John. He was always a fighter, that one. I wonder what must be going through his mind right now.
Back in the rover (just to be safe) with a delicious freeze dried meal (screw rations today, seriously) and listening to the tunes James used to listen to while driving. Classical music, why am I not surprised?
I’ll start by bringing in more dirt, so I have enough soil for planting. And I think I’ll start a seed crop. I have a little corner of fertile soil ready, so if I cut the 12 potatoes I have in 4 pieces with a couple of eyes each, they’ll hopefully sprout. I’ll need to cut up this crop to plant on the rest of the field, so I hope they grow well. My life depends on it.
: They are the biggest supporters of the plan, to be honest. But then again, they are astronauts.
“Do you still write him?” Sherlock fixes him with a stare.
SH: Possibly. Would not be the best plan, though. He won’t be able to stay there for long, and it won’t be an easy drive.
Please, can you take him off my hands, at least until my shift is over? I’ll bring you coffee for a week.
Greg: So, If Sherlock’s guess is correct...
Mycroft,
Once here we got to the surface with our MDV (Mars Descent Vehicle), and set up camp. So to speak.
Either way, we don’t have time to build a custom craft. We have to work with what we’ve got. I’ll talk to JPL again, see how we can do this without stripping the MDV of safety and emergency equipment.
SH: Yes.
I’m guessing it’s about 3%. That’ll be enough for the dirt, so I’ll go with that.

“Miss Hudson”, he greets her rather formally. Lilly’s smile is warm. They talk about her work in the city, and reminisce about her aunt. Or John does, anyway. Her boys are doing fine, although they can be a handful, Lilly tells them. Baby Emma is sweet as ever. She shows them pictures on her phone. John does his Doctor Watson routine, asking after her eating and sleeping habits. Sherlock is quiet. When she leaves, she promises to visit again soon, and to bring the kids.
“Well, thank you for taking care of James,” Ada’s mum says to Doctor Watson, holding out a hand. “Idaline Adelaide.”
Sherlock would recognize that voice anywhere. It’s John.
He didn’t answer, and instead he turned to Sherlock, eyes questioning, searching for an explanation, but found none. Sherlock, instead, stood up, saying, “Good, John, but not good enough. I can tell you what you missed, which was almost everything, while we go find the killer. Come along!”
He is forced into a sudden halt anyway when two of them catch up to him and smoothly place themselves into his way. They’re faster than their broad frames should be, swiftly shifting this way and that when Sherlock tries to swerve around them. Sherlock can already feel the impending bruise. (Bruises, plural, actually, first a ring around his upper arm when Sebastian holds him in place while he blows off steam via ranting at him, then a second one on his face when Sherlock irritates him to the breaking point).
Usually, Sherlock finds it mind-numbingly easy to ignore what everyone else is doing, even/especially his mum and dad, like when he refused to dress up for Halloween (until John came over, excited, and persuaded Sherlock that trick or treating would be fun), or when he found the Easter egg hunts to be too easy and sat up in his room (until John came up to his room, and Sherlock found that dazzling him with instantly finding the hiding locations to be suitable entertainment), or even something as mundane as using an umbrella when it’s raining (unless John is walking with him, because then he starts to shiver and it’s

Angie remembers this - Doctor John Watson, and Sherlock must be Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The ones that were in love just like her mum and dad were in love. That would explain the fondness - whenever her mum yells at someone, it’s usually over the phone, and it isn’t nearly as soft-sounding as Doctor Watson’s tone.
When she gets home that day, it’s to a bright bouquet of flowers, and she thinks of Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson again. They should be able to get flowers, too. So she asks her mum if she can give Mr. Holmes the flowers tomorrow, and explains what Mr. Holmes told her. At first, her mum wears the predictable pinched face, but then it smooths out into a smile. “Of course,” she says. “I’ll bring you tomorrow.”
Angie marvels at how loud they are, to be heard all the way outside the house. Apparently Doctor Watson is just as loud, because he yells back, “Hold on, you prat! I’m busy, I’ll be right back!” The words are harsh, but the tone is anything but, sounding almost fond.
“Sherlock!” Lestrade said, looking at him, concerned (quick glance at the time, 00:13 - he had been staring at the jumper for upwards of two minutes - sloppy, sloppy). “You okay, mate? You-”

She goes to bed vibrating with excitement, and has to remind her mum no less than three times the next day, but they are finally at the park.

Her mother tells her they’ll only wait for ten minutes, but Angie knows that Mr. Holmes will come soon, and he does, heading straight for the flower bed.

“I do,” Sherlock said, glaring at Lestrade pointedly, hoping he’d get the point (Lestrade was of above-average intelligence, which of course meant that he was still an idiot, but he was . . . bearable).
James nods, and all three of them crowd him again. Angie sits next to him and awkwardly pats him on the shoulder. James grasps onto Jafar’s hand - Jafar looks even more nervous that James does. Doctor Watson smiles at all of them, and James closes his eyes as the cloth inches closer to his knees, only for them to fly wide open again as he yells, “Ouch!” as it comes into contact with the cut.
The glare fell off his face and was replaced by a slightly more confused frown (not completely confused - Sherlock Holmes didn’t get confused - but uncertain). He rarely got ‘unknown number’ texts, especially since caller ID numbers started displaying the phone number of those he hadn’t contacted before.
Angie kinda wants a lolly, but she definitely isn’t going to ask for one. Doctor Watson picks up on it anyway, and pulls three more out of his box. “You’re welcome - do you want one too?”
Sherlock tried to make himself move back, but strangely enough, his body, which he was usually in complete and total control of, refused to cooperate. Instead of letting go of the scarves and backing away enough to let the paramedics haul John onto a stretcher, he stayed kneeling over John, hands still pressing desperately into his stomach, eyes locked onto his eyelids, where Sherlock could see his eyes moving wildly (and his mouth, moving silently and saying nothing, but Sherlock could tell that the word John was mouthing over and over was

“I don’t know if your unbelievably stupid genius brain realized, Sherlock, but there was a kid crying outside and I decided to see what was wrong,” John says. Sherlock is a lot like a child in many ways - the most obvious being that he really is just one overgrown child - and one of them is his tendency to also never have any in between. He was either very observant or very oblivious, and both could be very frustrating (and amazing, but mostly frustrating).

Sure enough, when Sherlock turns around, John is glaring at the group of figures around him. He isn’t a very intimidating figure, considering he hasn’t grown nearly as much as Sherlock has, and is left at an unfortunate 1.7 meters. What is intimidating is his glare, promising fierce retribution to the one who dares lay a finger on Sherlock, and after what had happened last time, everyone knows that John can and will follow through on that threat, no matter how much trouble he ends up in afterwards.

It was best to rip off the bandage fast, John thought, and so with quick assured steps he made his way to Sherlock and reached a hand out - Sherlock flinched as if John was going to strike him - and laid a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. It was warm and solid beneath him.

Sherlock didn’t expect it to be unlocked, and he was right. The door stubbornly stayed shut. Lestrade had taken all of Sherlock’s duplicates in his last drugs bust (unfortunately - perhaps this experience would convince the DI to allow him at least one. In case of emergencies, of course), so it was with little regret that Sherlock hefted his hammer (taken casually from Mrs. Hudson’s rather sizeable cupboard of tools), walked over to the passenger’s side (it wouldn’t do to have to waste time cleaning out glass cuts from Lestrade, which he would only do for Lestrade’s help and not because of any
“Now, this is going to hurt just a bit,” Doctor Watson warns him. “Do you want your friends here?”
“But why?” This time it’s Safaa who asks. She has suddenly appeared next to James. Angie isn’t sure how long she’s been there, but it was probably when Mr. Holmes was thinking of Doctor Watson - he didn’t look as scary then.
“Yeah, thank you!” “Thanks, sir!”
This was exactly was Moriarty wanted. He wanted Sherlock to hurt, wanted Sherlock to be too late in getting to John, wanted Sherlock’s heart burnt, set aflame until it shriveled up and turned to ashes. And he couldn’t let that happen (couldn’t let John get hurt, had to find John, had to beat Moriarty, had to- had to-

It wasn’t formatted as a file for a case normally was - instead it, there were only three lines typed in a neat font Sherlock could probably identify on the spot, on blank paper Sherlock probably knew the brand of, inside a manilla folder Sherlock could probably trace back to a specific store. It seemed to be more of a short story blurb than anything, but the name of the victim combined with the “case” was anything but entertaining.
“Or else what?” Lestrade asked, opening the back doors and slipping inside, checking under seats and behind headrests.
“Sherlock, the ambulance!” Lestrade called from behind him, and Sherlock resisted the urge to snap back that, yes, he could
(and he sounded like John, romanticizing everything, but that really was the best way to explain it) as he realized what that meant. Moriarty had promised to burn the heart out of Sherlock by attacking the one thing that proved Sherlock had one.
“It’s not a waste of time!” John gets loud very suddenly, and everyone is looking at him. John doesn’t like people looking at him, Sherlock knows, and right on cue, he blushes a brilliant red as he notices. Sherlock wants to tell John that it doesn’t matter what all these people think, has told him before, but John persists in his embarrassment. Soon enough, everyone looks away, and John continues, quieter this time. “It’s not a waste. You get to tell all the people you like that you like them. Like family, and friends. And, other people. That you like.”
Sherlock doesn’t bother responding, as his next words should be more than enough explanation for his mood. He holds out the bouquet (a beautiful thing, with all types of flowers but mainly lillies, with all sorts of colours, but mainly purple) and smiles. “Happy birthday, John.”
Angie runs towards the flowerbed, making sure to hide on the opposite end of where Mr. Holmes is. The flowers are very tall, and if everyone thinks Mr. Holmes really is all that mean, they probably won’t check near him - it’s a perfect hiding spot, as long as Mr. Holmes doesn’t come any closer.

There’s a shuffling sound next to her, and her eyes dart towards it immediately. She’s probably been caught-

“John! Phone!”
“They leave for weeks at a time, sometimes,” he says. “Back to London, to fight crime. Sherlock’s a detective, and John wrote a blog about them. It’s good stuff.”
“Veronica,” he says, smile on his face bright, and although Sherlock likes Veronica as little as it is possible to like someone and still tolerate them, he can never truly hate someone that manages to put that smile on John’s face. This is the only reason why he accepts their current dynamic - Sherlock and John and sometimes Veronica - rather than Sherlock’s ideal: Sherlock and John, period.
Angie frowns. James is right - almost all adults are home on Halloween. Even at her old city, all the doors she had rung, someone had answered. So she asks her mum when they get back to where they are standing a couple meters from the door. “Where are they?”
Below it was a picture of the charred apartment. It was a studio apartment, although there was no furniture to identify the space, only what could vaguely be identified as former countertops and maybe a stove. A single red light, presumably from a fire alarm, from what Lestrade could see in the grainy photo, illuminated the space with help from the camera flash.
She’s cut off by loud voice coming from inside the house yelling,
They fall into an easy sort of silence as they leave the school campus behind them and begin walking to their respective destinations, in the same direction for most of the walk before they have to split. It has been the same route the both of them have taken since school began, and although they don’t always spend the entire walk talking, the companionable silence they almost always fall into is just as good.
Sherlock cleared his throat again from behind him. “John, I know my return has been quite a shock for you, but if you could say something-”
At first, when Sherlock had showed him John’s things and explained that this was all Moriarty, Lestrade could only wonder: why? Why kidnap John, but also give Sherlock clues as to where and how? Why was Lestrade a part of it, if only to send a message? Why send the message in the first place? Power plays were not something Lestrade was a stranger to (the most notable being when he met Sherlock’s own brother, with ‘met’ really just a kinder word for ‘kidnapped by’) but there was something about the way it was all set up that reminded Lestrade vaguely of the logic puzzles he used to enjoy as a child, before it became his full-time job and the stakes were much higher than just the name of a dead person on a paper.
He walked down the stairs and into the kitchen, registering Sherlock sitting in his chair from the corner of his eye. Two cups today, then. “Good morning, Sherlock.”
Lestrade suddenly looked affronted. “That was what I was trying to tell you, before you spaced out. I thought you hated repeating yourself?”
I will also return your jumper, relatively unscathed. -SH
Sherlock turned his gaze on him, and Lestrade stuttered for a moment, pausing in what he was going to say, before letting out a heavy sigh.
Once he was at the clinic, he let himself slip into his doctor mindset, vanquishing all thoughts of Sherlock from his mind. Sherlock had never appeared in the clinic before, thankfully, and it offered John a much-needed respite from . . . everything. He couldn’t let his mind go completely numb, of course, but he definitely didn’t have to think of Sherlock, and he barely got enough time between patients for his mind to stray to him either.

I can stay in the rover for one more day, but I have to fix this before the CO2 filters are full.
“It’s fine, John,” Sherlock had waved him away. “Just a scratch.”

Sherlock scrapes the chair over the tiles, sits down, reaches for the paper, and starts complaining about it immediately. John is making eggs and toast. Sherlock refuses to eat. John is reminded of all the mornings they shared in 221b and smiles at the stove.

“Know how to jive?” John asked him. Sherlock shook his head, “Not really part of my training,” he answered.
“We are done here, so ehm...make sure you come in for statements tomorrow, alright?” He sounded both embarrassed and amused, and John felt the blood rush all the way up to the tips of his ears. Sherlock wasn’t flustered at all. Calmly stepping away from John and turning his coat collar up, he smoothly swept passed Lestrade as if he wasn’t just about to shove his hand down John’s pants right next to a crime scene.
I can’t quite get my head around the news, to be honest - but if it is true, I can already tell you now that there is no way Hermes can change its trajectory.
Yeah.
John thought about how Sherlock’s life was before he had come along. Sherlock never talked about it, but he knew he never had a friend like him before, one that helped him on cases and stayed after the deductions were explained. The thought of Sherlock eating alone in his flat after he solved a case made him feel strangely emotional.
I shall have to miss your excellent banoffee pie for a little longer, I’m afraid. I leave for California in the morning.

We went to Mars with the Hermes, a rocket specially designed to ferry between Earth and Mars for these missions. It takes a while to get here (4 months, in our case) and it’s a miracle we all made it here alive. No, I’m kidding - we make a very good team. Made. God, no, that sounds wrong.
Sherlock comes back inside a little later, smelling of grass and smoke. He lowers himself onto the sofa, next to John who had dozed off while pretending to read the paper. He feels Sherlock's fingers slip in his own. Squeezing. They are rough from work in the garden, from experiments gone wrong, cuts and burns. Still long and slender. Still beautiful. It’s quiet. John is content to just sit here, in their sofa, with Sherlock’s hand in his. But then he feels Sherlock’s shoulder shaking, and when he looks up, Sherlock’s head is down, black curls tumbling forward and he can hear him sob quietly. The only thing he manages to say is John’s name. John pulls him into his own body, close to his heart.
He didn’t bother looking away to cover his eyes (he knew glass, he knew how to shatter glass, and he knew how to avoid getting hurt as he did so), only waited for the sound of shattering glass to end before he peered inside (Lestrade was sitting in the driver’s seat, of course. Wrapped securely around his face was some sort of fabric most usually found in clothes - required further investigation - and his hands, and probably his feet as well, were secured with a glinting metal that matched with none of the most commonly used restraints - further investigation as well), carefully unlocked the car, and ran around to the other side of the car to open the driver’s door.

James rings the doorbell, and they wait for the footsteps and the door to open, like they have been hearing for the past hour or so. Nothing happens. James rings the doorbell again, and they wait another couple seconds, before Safaa turns back around, the least patient of the bunch. “There’s no one home,” she sighs.
He looks stunned, staring at the flowers in confusion for a couple moments. Angie starts to feel that she has done something wrong, and is about to pull the flowers back and apologize, when Mr. Holmes reaches out to take the flowers from her hands. “Oh,” he says, and then again, “oh. Thank you. John’s expressions over the past week did indicate that he would prefer multiple flowers to only one. I have not yet tested colour scheme, but he does like it when I wear a purple shirt, so this will be excellent. Thank you very much.”
Sherlock let out a noise of frustration (he was disappointed - usually it was John doing the growling
It’s very obvious that Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson like each other very much. Also, Doctor Watson makes Mr. Holmes look not as mean, which Angie appreciates. Why is Mr. Holmes wanting to give Doctor Watson flowers so bad? Flowers always make her mum and dad happy.
John moved without thinking, removed his hand from his shoulder and instead went for Sherlock’s neck
He had dismissed the thought immediately, only for Moriarty to confirm it when Sherlock checked his mobile, Lestrade reading over (around) his shoulder.
Unfortunately, it isn’t up to Sherlock, which is why they are stopped a quarter of the way through their walk by John’s
“John, phone,” Sherlock called, not looking up from the microscope (in which he was studying fingernails that were the equivalent of Petri dishes when it came to the number of bacteria on them - delightful) but holding out one hand.
(Larissa doesn’t understand why or appreciate that isn’t a regularly-shaped heart.)
Angie beams, glad that she hasn’t messed up. Mr. Holmes looks very happy now, and is even smiling at her. He gives her a pat on the head before walking off. She turns to her mum with a wide smile, and her mum smiles back. She hopes Doctor Watson likes the flowers.
“Yes, first clue, Lestrade,
“No,” John cut him off, finality in his tone. “No.”
(John couldn’t die, not when Sherlock needed him, if only to have someone to speak to during crime scenes instead of a skull. There was an odd tightness in his chest and an odd buzz in the back of his mind Sherlock identified as fear and worry but were of secondary importance when it came to John, bleeding out in front of him and staining Sherlock’s hands red even through the scarves.)
but it really doesn’t seem that way. The years since he met Sherlock have passed in a blur. Sometimes it feels as if he has lived two separate lives, one filled with adrenaline rushes and gunfire, running towards danger and watching crimson decorate the edges of his vision, worrying for and about Sherlock,
Mycroft was right. Especially now - sentiment was a disadvantage, and would only hinder him now, would only hinder him from getting to John. He couldn’t let any of this get the better of him (worry about Lestrade: rash actions, destruction of evidence. Fear for John: carelessness, time-wasting, sloppiness. Sentiment was already hurting him, already keeping him from John, with his beautiful eyes and beautiful smile and-)
,” Jafar corrects.
That would mean the heart was for Sherlock, right? It clearly wasn’t for his bully of a sister, and John never really talked about his parents except to complain about how funny his dad smelled all the time and how his mummy seemed sad. John didn’t have any other friends that he would give a gift. Hence, it was for Sherlock.
“Case file. Again,” Lestrade had heard him mutter. He’d found it - and was probably going to rush off with it, leaving Lestrade in the dust to desperately try and catch up and Sherlock solved the case on his own. Not this time - Lestrade liked John, they went out for drinks every couple weeks, and he would be damned if he didn’t at least try to help. Not to mention, he was sure Sherlock was affected by this more than he let on, and he would be there for Sherlock if he needed him (as unlikely as it was to happen - Sherlock would probably admit to being an idiot before he admitted he needed help, or even showed it to any degree).
Mr. Holmes turns their direction, and Angie instinctively swivels her head back around. Safaa’s ponytail hits her in the face as she does the same, and Ada follows suit. They stand quietly for a second, Angie, already nervous at the thought of Mr. Holmes, much more nervous with Ada’s warnings, tries not to let the thought of Mr. Holmes’s gaze possibly still fixed on them scare her. “Do you . . . do you guys want to play hide and seek?” she asks instead.
Speaking of harsh words - Angie gasps along with all of her friends at the word ‘prat’. “You shouldn’t say that word, mister,” she says. Her mother has always told her to not use that word, along with many other words. They were rude.
“It’s me, John.”
“When do they come back?” Ada says.
She looks disappointed, as do James and Safaa, and Angie herself. Pirates are cooler than detectives in her opinion, but detectives are cool too, and she’d like to hear some detective stories. Maybe when they come back, she consoles herself, but until then, there’s more candy to be had.
Thankfully, it wasn’t the cheerful man, but someone who looked similar enough to him that they could be brothers.
The only time he mustered up the strength to fight his mind was when Sherlock tried to convince him he wasn’t a figment of his imagination, because while he knew that he already wasn’t completely sane, what with seeing Sherlock everywhere he went, but if he started to believe that Sherlock was still alive, he would spiral down a rabbit hole he couldn’t climb out of
Sherlock doesn’t know. It still doesn’t make sense, but most things everyone else does don’t. What is making even less sense is that John seems more embarrassed than usual. He’s stammering more than usual, too. This isn’t his John, but Sherlock doesn’t get a chance to ask (or deduce, like his annoying, unfortunately smarter big brother always tells him to do), because the teacher tells them it’s time to leave at that moment, and John, who clearly still hasn’t finished his heart, says, “Oh no!” as he hurriedly cleans up and carefully puts his heart away.
, instead only seeming to make him more determined to have John’s attention. John wondered wryly why his mind hated him, why it was so determined to rub in John’s face that Sherlock was gone and was never coming back. “Did you figure it out?” fake-Sherlock asked from somewhere above his shoulder.

The mediocre Indian place he sometimes stopped by on his way to and from the clinic was surrounded by yellow tape, and, curious and a bit worried for the nice man, barely out of his teens, that always greeted him at the front by name, John ducked under the yellow tape. He nodded at the officers around the perimeter that he recognized - and that recognized him and let him pass without complaint, thankfully - and made his way through the sea of people to get inside.

“Oh, sod the police,” he growled and pulled Sherlock down by his scarf, crushing their mouths together. Their noses and teeth collided, but John roughly yanked at Sherlock’s hair to get a better angle.

The bar was dark and crowded. Sherlock liked it that way. It was oddly comforting to be a little invisible every now and then, to be able to hide away in the shadows. For six days a week, he danced in the bright-lit practice rooms of the Royal Opera House and he was forced to look at himself in the mirrored walls all the time. Every move had to be studied, precise, careful. And repeated endless times.
John nods. Sherlock shuffles outside. John watches golden dust particles dance in the beam of sunlight still illuminating Sherlock’s chair and takes a deep breath.

Okay okay, this isn't a real chapter, I'm sorry to get your hopes up! This little bit was written 3 years ago to start off the next chapter.

“John,” he replied, taking Sherlock’s hand in his. “So, Sherlock, fancy a dance then?” John grinned, not letting go of his hand, but using it to pull Sherlock away from the bar and into the crowd on the dancefloor. The DJ had switched from a slow dance to upbeat rock-n-roll, which made Sherlock a little nervous.
Sherlock stares at him for a few seconds, sits down, reaches for the mug. John is making eggs and toast. Sherlock eats all of it. John washes the dishes after, remembering all the mornings they shared in 221b and blinks back his tears.

Sherlock and John looked at the chaos of police cars and officers surrounding the seemingly ordinary house where they had successfully ambushed the suspect in a triple homicide case.
Cupping his shoulder briefly, the hand moved onwards, gliding over his back and then suddenly it faltered, stuttered to a stop.
: But isn’t that good news?
“No, it’s nothing, but I’d like some tea, please.” He smiled up at Sherlock. “Oh, right, we better get to the Yard for our statements!” He stood up again. John then proceeded to stuff some slices of bread in the toaster, drink the tea and get dressed in record time. He was still eating his toast when he bundled Sherlock in his Belstaff and down the stairs to the front door.

I’ll have to set a fire in the Hab. Fire is possibly the worst thing that can happen, in normal circumstances. The guys at NASA would lose their head if they knew about my plans.

But then I thought, if I connect the air valve that would normally connect to the Rover directly to the Hab, the air wouldn’t be lost at all! So that’s what I did yesterday.

To make water, I need to take hydrogen and oxygen, and burn it. Now this is all very complicated, but I’m currently the best chemist on this planet, so I’ll give it a go.
Irene: I guess he wants to travel to Ares IV so he can communicate with us?
: For longer missions, it’s very important that the crew is compatible, that they are able to trust each other and work and live together in a small space for a long time. They will face new and possibly life-threatening situations. We do extensive testing to get a good reading of their personalities and their stress resistance.

need is Sherlock Holmes asking them about survival rates in deep space.
“The look on your face!” he managed between hiccupping laughs. “Oh this is so worth it!”
The cloth fell on the floor between them with a wet plop as they both surged forward and pressed their mouths together. John’s hand tightened in Sherlock’s hair while his other hand moved to cup his jaw. He pulled back a little and the dazed look on Sherlock’s face ignited a flame in his chest and he was overcome with a bright wave of happiness. Sherlock smiled at him, looking as if John was an unsolvable puzzle. John pulled him back in, using his hand to angle Sherlock’s face a little and brushed their lips together again slowly. It was clear Sherlock didn’t have a lot of experience with this, and he felt a little thrill go up his spine at the thought of it being Sherlock’s first proper kiss. Sherlock’s lips were dry and warm. John nipped at the plush bottom lip, tasting coffee and sugar, and felt Sherlock shiver under his hands. He smiled against his mouth, now catching Sherlock’s upper lip between his and flicking his tongue against it. Sherlock gasped, but John just continued lightly licking his lips, and it didn’t take long before Sherlock began copying him hesitantly, softly biting and tasting John and his hands came up to cradle John’s face, keeping them close together.
“I was brilliant on that case”.
Sherlock looked at his reflection. On his forehead John had written ‘consulting idiot’. He had also drawn stripes on his cheeks, representing whiskers, and coloured the tip of his nose. John had dissolved in silent giggles next to him.
That is to say, a small explosion happened. The good thing is: I’m not a crater and all the hydrogen is gone. So. Mission accomplished!
Okay. I’ve been thinking. I could easily live here for a while. Well, ‘easy’ is relative, but there is enough food for six people for a couple months (NASA packs extra, in case something goes wrong with the unmanned probes - thank god).
Solar panels: covered in dust because of the storm. I’ll need to clean them and make sure to do that regularly.
“Only because it’s you,” he says, amused.
: What is your opinion on the current crew?
The only thing I can say is: calm down and brace yourselves, because this plan is even worse and it doesn’t involve maths.
Greg: Irene!

“How did you…that’s amazing, I...you really think I’d be a good surgeon?” he stammered, studying his own hands and looking back up at Sherlock. It dawned on him he wanted to know the man’s name, for him not to be a stranger anymore.

“Doesn’t matter. I’ll lead, you’ll get it in no time!” John arranged Sherlock and started to show him some basic steps. It wasn’t that complicated, and soon they were dancing.
He’d probably never had done any of the stupid things boys did at school, or in college. Get drunk together, playing stupid pranks… He looked at Sherlock’s face, innocent and soft while he slept, and suddenly saw the opportunity for what it was. They had done a lot of things together that were normal for most mates, but new to Sherlock. Why not expand his experience some more?
Greg: You don’t HAVE to say he’ll starve to death if we can’t find a solution!
I’ll do some short drives to test it all out. I’ll start the preparations tomorrow.
Mike: Why not?
John peeled the shirt off his body then, moving slowly to stand behind him, to have a closer look at where his skin had been unmade and had made itself again. Calloused fingers followed a ridge of raised tissue, the sensation flickering between the tingle of warm skin on skin and nothing at all where it had gone numb.
: Not really. At the moment we’re working on a plan involving the Ares IV MDV. The crew could pick him up before heading to the Ares IV site. But it’s still in the early stages.
: It must be difficult for them without John.

Sorry for taking so long, peeps! First life happened, and then season 4, and it was very difficult to even THINK about John and Sherlock for a while...anyway, I hope you enjoy it and come say hi on tumblr if you do! Your comments are what make me want to write!
Greg: Isn’t there an hourly update schedule?
It could be, yes.
My best bet is still the Ares IV mission. If I can survive here until then, they could take me with them. So I need to find a way to get to the landing site. It’s 3200 kilometers away in the Schiaparelli crater, so it won’t be easy.
“It’s incredible, Sherlock, I can’t believe you’ve solved this one so quickly.” It was true that John had seen Sherlock solve innumerable mysteries, but still he was in awe of the way Sherlock could piece everything together so easily. This case had seemed like a hopeless one, but barely three days had passed before they were forcing their way into their killer’s hiding spot.
Another benefit is that it annoys Mycroft to no end, but he can’t really do anything about it, since Mike rightly wanted to make use of my expertise in telecommunication. So you see, I’m doing quite well.
The plants are sprouting. Alright, little ones!
I just watched one of Sally’s movies. Friends was reminding me too much of the crew and my sister. The film was Groundhog Day. Apart from being really old, the part where Phil keeps finding interesting and creative ways to kill himself wasn’t really good for my morale.
We could use the images to get more funding. Congress funded us for five missions, but since Ares III was a failure, and most of the supplies are still up there, we could get a sixth mission out of this! It would only cost a fraction of a regular mission, and if we make the recovering of John Watson’s body one of the goals, we will definately get support. Of course, we should pitch the idea now that the world still feels sympathy for John Watson’s family. You know the media will have forgotten about this in a year.

After nearly two hours of studying, Sherlock gets up from the desk and lets himself fall on John’s bed. “Enough! That’s as much tutoring I can handle today.” John looks at his friend, spread out on his bed, his shirt rucked up and showing a strip of pale skin above his waistband, and stands up suddenly. “I’ll make us some tea, yeah?” He asks, no longer looking at Sherlock and fleeing his own room without waiting for a reply.
did,” Sherlock corrected.
Molly: Southeast. Ares IV is southwest. He’s charging the solar cells now.
He pressed his forehead against John’s, breathing hard and shallow.
It all seemed to be working pretty well. I managed to put everything in place, I was able to use a catalyst to get the hydrogen, and I very very slowly and carefully burned it, and I was making a lot of water!
“We’re making it up now, though,” John says, kissing the offered fingertips.
Mike: What? Who gave you access to this chat?
John settled himself on the coffee table in front of Sherlock, a bowl of water with some of Sherlock’s expensive facial soap and a flannel next to him.  He started wiping the damp cloth over Sherlock’s cheekbone. Despite John patching him up every other case, his touch was always a little shock for Sherlock. He tried not to flinch.
He spotted an empty stool at the bar and went towards it. Generic lounge music filled the air and dolled up women and men were chatting and laughing in small groups around the bar. Like Sherlock, they were waiting for the moment the DJ would come out and they could dance the night away. Sherlock ordered a drink - normally he avoided alcohol, but he didn’t have classes or rehearsals the next day and he just didn’t care. If that meant spending his free day nursing a hangover, so be it.
Pulling an antenna out of your own shoulder is exactly as fun as it sounds. But I was quick about it, always the best way with things like this. I cleaned the wound carefully, but it didn’t look as bad as I feared. With local anesthesia I was able to stitch myself back together. Do not try this at home, kids! It’s not as neat as it would have been if I could have used my left hand (my clean stitches are praised from Afghanistan to Mars, I’ll have you know), but it’ll do. I’ll need to take some antibiotics to be safe, and I’ll have to be careful for at least a few days.
“Wow, that’s quite something! I’m just a...”
Surprise!
“I’m not like your school friends, John. I don’t understand the need for this idiocy.” He sipped from his cup. “What’s the purpose of it? We’re already friends and we already have a...bond, we don’t need this.”
Mike: Yes.
“It’s different now, though. Isn’t it?” John asked.
Okay, I’m VERY worried about safety. But if I don’t try, I’ll die (oooh, catchy).
They watch her drive off, the sun glinting off her little blue car, the smell of dry grass and hot sand in the air.
SH: If you didn’t want me here, you shouldn’t make it so easy to hack into.
However, the antenna and the congealed blood from the wound were both really good at plugging the hole of my EVA suit, keeping me alive. The water in the blood evaporated, and the resulting sticky residue closed the tear in the fabric like glue. In the end the oxygen warning of the suit woke me up.
Greg: Alright, now he can drive a long distance without freezing or losing battery life. But where would he go?

: Is it true that they still don’t know that John is alive? They still think he didn’t survive?
“No, thank you, John, I think I’ll take a look at the hives”.

Good thing I have almost 4 years to figure out how to do it.
It’s funny how I get really calm and composed when I’m in a situation like that. I wonder what Ella would make of it. It was a good thing I was, though. I took an air sample, put on my suit and went to a Rover - we have equipment in there to check the atmosphere.
That might not be as good as it sounds, though. I have no clue what to do next. I can see the MAV is gone, so I hope the evacuation went well.

Subject: Re: Rescue
“I know you’re not like them. I don’t want you to be like them. You’re brilliant the way you are. I was just being an idiot.” John patted Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock looked up at him. John looked a bit awkward, clearly afraid of having pushed him too far.
SH: It’s simple: he needs the plutonium to save battery power. The heating takes up half of the energy if my calculations are correct (they are), so he’s decided to turn it off. It’s too cold to drive without heating, however, so he dug up the RTG as a portable space heater.
If I can find a way to make the soil fertile, I can start farming!
I miss London. Things are so bland here. The food, the rooms, the buildings. They don’t know how to make a decent cup of tea. I don’t understand how Mycroft can bear it. But I suppose he’ll go anywhere where they let him lead an organisation like NASA.
“Oh, John, you know I can tell,” Sherlock reprimands him.
It started with a kiss. As some things do.
So...
“I do.” His voice still a dark rumble. Lush, John thinks. “We were idiots, back then, wasted so much time”. His fingers slide over John’s lips.
The Hab is in complete working order, everything works the way it’s supposed to. I have oxygen, water, food and all the personal belongings of my crewmates. That could be fun if I get bored.
: With this failed mission in mind, are you going to do things differently next time around?
Mike: I think that went well. Irene?
Molly: Well, he’s not going in the right direction for the Ares IV site. But you’d think he’d stay within walking distance if it was a test drive, like he usually does.
In any case, satellite time is precious; you are not the only one asking for it. I know Ares III is a hot topic in the media right now, but we do have other projects, as you well know. Besides, we’d like this particular media hype to die down as quickly as possible.

“He almost knocked me out earlier, if you hadn’t been there…”
John caressed a sharp cheekbone with his thumb.
Anyway, it took me a while, but I got into the safety of the Hab, got my helmet off without moving my shoulder too much, took a deep breath of sweet sweet oxygen and went to my natural habitat: the medical bay. Because in addition to being the resident biologist, I’m also the flight surgeon.

Maybe Sholto wouldn’t. But he definitely would not approve.

We will dedicate ourselves every single day to assist the remaining Ares III crew on their journey back to Earth.
: Now, you are in charge of all the Ares missions.
If I want to improve the Potato Problem, I need more land to farm on. The Hab is too small, I think I need at least 4 times the surface to plant on. I can use the bunk beds, I’m not using them anyway, and some of the lab tables. But I’d still need more.
“I’m going to have some tea. With your special honey. Do you want some, Sherlock?” He asks, too innocently, a sure tell for Sherlock, but he doesn’t care.
Greg: Yeah, it seems too soon for that. He could of course be desperate to talk to us. He doesn’t know we’re watching him, he’s all alone up there. But Sherlock is right, there is only the MAV, none of the pre-supplies are there yet. It’s very risky. If anything goes wrong with the Rover…
The first thing Sherlock forgets are - shockingly - the bees. He’s usually very precise, checking every two weeks if everything is in order. It’s been nearly three weeks now, and it worries John.

When he enters his room, gingerly holding the two steaming mugs, Sherlock is still on his bed. He ignores John, completely engrossed in the pictures tacked on the wall next to it. John brings the mugs over and sets them on the nightstand.
Yeah, we’re like 99% sure.
When I woke up, I saw the antenna of the main communication dish was lodged into my shoulder, which was...painful. My bio-monitor was damaged as well, so the crew would have thought my vitals were gone.
Right when he started to make tea, he heard John stumbling down the stairs. He walked into the kitchen and looked around blearily. It always took John a bit longer to recover from a case. It was quite endearing, actually. It was fine, John looked relaxed, and he didn’t mind holding on to the easy domesticity that marked their lives between cases now. It wouldn’t be long before he longed for a good mystery again, but the times in between were less agonising than they used to be. John was back home, and even though there we still a lot of things unsaid between them, he felt he already got more than he deserved and he was happy with how things were - even though Mycroft took every opportunity to rub it in his face.
It was Greg, who looked much more awkward that he usually did, leaning on the wall outside. “Oh, uh, John,” he said, clearing his throat. “Sorry to interrupt, just wanted to see how it was going- how you were taking, uh, everything.”
“Four!” comes a voice from above them. James has jumped off his swing, and Angie scatters along with the rest of her friends to get out of James’s way. He lands exactly where Angie was standing. She glares at him, but he only sends her a smile. “And I’m it.”
“John!” she says, voice annoyingly high-pitched as she lays a kiss on John’s lips. John laughs into her lips and deepens the kiss, but only for a second, before pulling back and smiling at her.
“Oh no, what happened?” comes a voice from behind them, and they all turn to the source. Coming out of the house is the man Angie recognizes as either Doctor Watson or Mr. Holmes - whichever one of the two was the blond one.
“Shoot himself, yes, but he’s still alive, as am I. Don’t look so surprised, Lestrade, it’s not a good look on you, only Ander-” and again, Sherlock cursed Moriarty for being such a

“Well-” John struggles to find the words. “Yeah, but like, you get to make sure they know. Or tell people that. Don’t know. You know?”
It sounds terribly mundane when he puts it on paper. But it will not be mundane, because he will be with John, and John is the opposite is mundane. There really are no words to describe John. He is still as much of a marvel as he was ten years ago.
Mycroft: Alright, notify us when anything changes. He might return to the Hab soon.
John smiled at his hands, now moving to clean the other cheek.  Sherlock let his mouth quirk up in a silent reply. “I should have expected this, you quite like childish games, as I recall.”
In this case, ‘successfully’ meant a bleeding lip and a scraped cheekbone for Sherlock and a twisted ankle for John. They were standing outside the police tape, waiting for Lestrade to give them permission to go home, and probably to summon them to his office in the morning. Which was in a few hours already, John noticed wearily.
“Sherlock,” he calls, “Lilly’s here”.
Mike: Molly works at SatCon, she found the evidence that John is still alive. She’s supervising the satellite images for us now.
I’m going to plant potatoes! We have some non freeze-dried potatoes, because NASA thought it might be beneficial for our mental health if we cooked our own Thanksgiving meal.
I’ll need more water for the crops, when I start planting. The water reclaimer works really well, but it won’t produce enough water for the plants. I’ll need to figure out a way to get more.
“You like him!” Sherlock accuses him.

Now my idea for water is basically to make it from scratch. We all know the recipe, the problem is how to get all the ingredients.
Sherlock was still buzzing with energy, radiating waves of euphoria, despite the sure signs of exhaustion underneath. John loved to see him like this - proud, tall and giddy as a boy at the same time. John himself was closer to being dead on his feet, but the adrenaline was still raging through his system and he managed to keep up with Sherlock’s explanations long enough to throw in some words of praise.
