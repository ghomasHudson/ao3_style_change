"Then where's your bows, arrows, pelts, other gear?"
"I just... I..." How can I tell him I find him attractive? This is completely the wrong time for such a revelation. "Is the bed ready to sleep on yet?"
"Um... yes..." I am at a loss for words, pinned by his gaze. I reach up and brush his cheek with my fingertips.
"It's the night for you to lose that superior attitude." I rock into his thrusting as I start to play with my own nipples.
"Then I'll drink your portion as well." I take another small sip and put the flask in my bag. "Breakfast, such as it is, is ready." Now that we're not, say, paying for services, I am at a loss about whether I should serve him or stay sat.
It's 4:02 am when Seb’s snoring wakes me up. No amount of pushing, shaking, or trying to roll him is shutting him up. I'm still enjoying the glow of a good high so I'm more annoyed than angry. This leaves me with three options. One, sleep on the couch. That's a nope. Two, cover his face in duct tape. Also a no since I don't want to train another one. Three, blow job. That always works. He and I know blowjobs lead to sex so I take some time to have a shower and prepare myself. "Seebbbby. Baaaabyyy. Wakey wakey." It's never good to wake a soldier by touching first. A grunt, and lack of chainsaw levels of breathing is enough of a cue to say he's awake enough to touch now. I lift up the covers at the bottom of the bed and crawl inside.
"Corporal Seb Kalle," I put out my hand to shake his. "Formerly of the 19th Regiment Royal Artillery."
I look at Jim, who looks as confused as I am - then look back at Mrs. Hudson's stern glare. I shrug, and head down the hall as instructed.
"Martha, dear, how did you make these? These honeycakes are AH-mayyyyy-zing." There's a bit of an interesting flavor. "What is that unique taste?"
I chuckle at the memory. "Well, I'd had a bit to drink, too... the whiskey was certainly flowing that evening. I'm sure your brother gave you an earful after seeing that..."
Sherlock
Scooting my knees closer to him causes his legs to lift even higher. I grab a pillow to put under his lower back so he doesn't strain himself. I make as I position myself at his opening. Slowly I sink in til I'm balls deep. "Still doing good? No pain?" He's tight and still slicked up. "Tell me when I can move."
The moment I see clothes all over the usually fastidiously neat room I know what's going on but not where.
Sherlock
"Oh. I see. Good for you then. Avoiding all that nonsensical dating stuff. Celibacy is a valiant virtue... Or so I've been told." Smart? Check. Funny? Think so. Doesn't date? That might be the deal breaker.
... want you inside me..." I stammer, barely able to catch my breath enough to speak.
"Pfft no fun." I pat his leg and return my hand to the shifter.
Sherlock
"Sleeeeeeeeeep." I pull my hand back and attempt to grab the blanket to cover myself.
Sherlock
"It's only because you're cute." I bop him on the nose in a playful way then laugh. Without warning I drop the rest of my weight down, making sure to land some of it on his new bruise. The pain on his arse must be deliciously unpleasant at best.
Irene
"Oh, he's not my date." I reply quickly. "Just a friend. I'm single... I mean, I don't have a date... ever."
"Aren't Phoenixes a type of Dragon?" I can imagine him upon a pile of books and parchment.
Sherlock
I press play again, letting the video proceed at a normal speed. Several minutes after Mrs. Hudson lets him in - curse that woman and her trusting nature - we see the young man leaving again, this time with his arm firmly around Mrs. Hudson's waist, almost as though he is helping her remain upright. "John, what does this look like to you?" I point at the screen.
"I would like to ask a favor. My brother has been missing for a few weeks now. I searched for him where I last saw him but he was nowhere to be found. As the Royal Bounty Hunter I would believe you'd have more skill than I." This is the tricky part. "I can't afford to pay for that skill but I believe we could work -something- out in trade."
I try to untuck the blanket so I can be the one who sleeps on the floor. "I can sleep on the floor. I'm good with that."
I chuckle at his attempt to balance a bit of all of them. "Wait." I grab a pint of Lactose free and put it on top of the pile in his arms. "Just in case."
I bust out laughing. "Oh. Precious. That's just precious." I head out of the Security room before Mycroft can deduce the reason for my hilarity.
"In Afghanistan. IED. Took down most my men. I survived." I rarely speak of those days and don't want to now either.
"Impossible. I don't have a plate or a knife and fork."
"Didn't Jimmy tell you? It's what made him so sad. Sherlock is spending all his time with John now. Good thing he has you, honey, and your games."
Sherlock seems a bit confused when he returns. He keeps looking around for something in the sky. "What's it you're looking for?'
"I said part of it was that if you ever kiss anyone else I want you to hate it." He continues to look at me. "Ok, I originally said I want to ruin you for Irene."
Sherlock
Sherlock
"You eat, too, darlin', or the deal's off. Don't think I haven't noticed..."
Mycroft
I look at what I can see of the house. "Round back, should be a door. I'll avoid any windows. Stay right here." I crouch down and start making my way behind the surreally domestic-looking cottage. There's even smoke coming from the chimney.
I lay my head on his hand. "You never were going to come say goodbye."
I grab a Channel Island milk and shake it. "You know, if I wanted to impress someone, or make sure I didn't disappoint them, -I- would get more than one kind. 'Course I know exactly what kind my guy likes."
, I think as I smile at him.
I call Mycroft, rather than text. As soon as he answers, I begin to speak. "Look for records relating to a Sebastian Kalay." A pause. "No, I don't know how to spell it, but I'm suspecting it's a derivative of Charles." Another pause. "Fine. Send me the information as soon as you can."
"Tsk tsk tsk tsk. Cheating makes no body a winner." I glare at a certain ex-Soldier who will be sleeping on his own for the next long while. "We agreed on 48 hours from the moment I relieved you from your premises. That was at exactly 4:04pm. Just ask Sherlock here, he'll tell you that the CCTV MyCraft sent was time stamped 4:04"
I look from him to the bags and back. "Food smells good. Katie still doing the cooking?" It's Kat, not Katie. Thanks to Sherlock calling her Katie constantly we have been relegated to delivery only.
"I might. Any idea when Mrs. Hudson will be back? I'd still like to talk to her about here."
I tear off a small bite of dry toast and wash it down with tea. "There. I ate. Now back to the favor. I must tell you the whole story but I ask that you first give me your word you'll help."
Mycroft
I look at him carefully, his eyes still sad and a bit worried.  "Does Mycroft ever hurt you?"
"Sherlock, there's someone at the door." I call out to my brother.
Sherlock
"No."
"I'll take that as an agreement." My Doctor voice is telling me to be slow and gentle while my Soldier voice is telling me to
Waiting to see how much he learned I allow him to lead the kiss. I respond eagerly with a moan and opening my jaw wider when he dips his tongue into my mouth. He tastes like tea and chocolate.
I whimper a little, then push back against his fingers. Letting go of my own cock, I move my oiled hand to his, grasping it gently, and start slowly stroking him.
"As you wish." I take off the robe and lay it over the chair near his bed. I put my knees on the bottom of the bed and start crawling over him. When our hips are aligned I lean down and start kissing his neck and raking my nails down his torso. He starts to stretch like a content cat. Sometimes I wonder if I could actually make him purr.
Mycroft
"Maybe she slept over at her friend’s house. The one with the married kids." It does seem out of character for her though.
"I'm the only one you've... been with, then?" Now I feel really awful.
I open the box and take out the mask, holding it up. "What is it? I mean, obviously some sort of bird, right?"
I watch impatiently as John sneaks toward the back. As soon as he is out of sight, I take off after him quietly.
Many years from now I will remember this as the moment Sherlock showed his strength by admitting there was something he didn't know and trusted me to teach him. In the not too distant future I will recall this memory when asked if I love him. "Lay back my sweet Prince." I kiss him softly while guiding him to lay on his back. I pour out a dab of oil and stroke my cock a few times to ease the ache a bit. After a bit more oil is on my hands I stroke his as well.
"I remember the day I first saw you. You were training in the courtyard with the other guards. I was there because I had finished a translation for the court Doctor." It was ten years ago but I remember it as if it was merely a week ago. "You were young, golden, and a bit too scrawny."
"Nah. It's cute when he gets all.... All.... Mycrofty." Yep. New word. Mycrofty. "What about you? Did you make your own mask?" I grab a biscuit off the tray. "These aren't burnt! Goofy boy." I ruffle his hair in a way I know he would only accept from me.
"Meh." I make grabby hands for the cakes, but she doesn't budge. I give my best puppy dog eyes, but she still doesn't budge. "I'm rich, successful, adored, feared. All the things. It's ok." My hand rests on the floor when I let my arm fall limp in my failed attempt at more goodies.  "I'm good at being bad. Bad at being good. Good thing I'm bad." A dramatic sigh escapes me. "I am a very bad person."
Mycroft
Mycroft is my name. "Let my hips roll? How does one do that?" Why would one do that?
Shut Up Self!! I can't move now because if I do he'll know that I know that he ... Fuck my life.
Mycroft
"Sherlock. I already told you. No one saw anything." As it's clear he is ignoring me I head down the stairs, again, to get the manager, again.
With a shiver, I rock back against the pressure of his fingers, while slowly stroking my cock. I close my eyes and rest my forehead on his shoulder, forcing myself to focus on not cumming right this second.
I wasn't expecting it when the warmth of the paddle's impact spread across my thigh. My eyes start to water a bit from the sting
"If I were to come back here for drinks it wouldn't be with you dear one." I chuckle at his disgusted face. "Come on." It takes only a few moments to walk to the shop and pick up my car. All eyes are on us when we get out of my brand new 68 Corvette Hard Top Convertible.
"Oh, yes. You'd mentioned needing my help... my expertise, if you will." I nod taking a seat across from him with my cup of tea and a muffin. "Since you've so kindly invited me, the least I could do is offer suggestions."
"Wait. Has it been worse?"
Mycroft
I smile in response. "Her Highness, Lady Dove of Watson." I kiss her hand and bring her attention to my partner. "Meet William... Of the... Phoenix?"
"You're not a stupid man, either, Mycroft. I'm not rejecting you. I'm just having a hard time understanding this. You come to me... have sex with me... wait on me hand and foot... because you WANT to?" The glimmer of hope in my eyes migrates to a relieved and happy smile.
With my hands behind his neck he cannot see what my fingers are doing. "Gregory, I have to ask you one thing. It's very important."
Sherlock
"I worked up an appetite." I rack my brain for any questions I could ask and he might actually answer. "We have apples too. And bee hives."
I'm relaxing into the soft sweep of John's tongue when he moves his fingers deeper. It's like a lightning bolt coursing through me. I arch my back and gasp loudly.
I smile up at him. "I hadn't considered oral sex as a way to win arguments..." I swirl my tongue around his head then take it in my mouth experimentally.
I tug Sherlock back when he starts to follow her. "I don't like this. Something’s wrong. We need to leave as soon as possible. Ok?" I put my arm around him and we slowly make our way to the house.
Irene
"Charles who?" As per normal he has already gone up the stairs and grabbed everything he needs before I am even done putting tea things away.
"Excuse me? Are you saying I found the real desire to be your whore?" I try to shrug off his embrace or even push him away.
"No, not really." I shrug. "Everything gets done..." I've put in more effort in the last 12 hours than I do in most weeks at home. "Despite my brother's letter, I can tell you the family doesn't need my support."
I consider protesting that I'm more concerned with his pleasure, but in my current position, that's fairly difficult. Instead I suck him into my mouth, my tongue running over the underside of his cock the way I know he likes.
"Just mean it. That's all I ask." I turn to look at him.
I moan appreciatively as his grip on my hair tightens.
I purr around his cock when his fingers run over my scalp, and pull his hips toward me, taking him to the back of my throat.
I wuh-uhn.
Sherlock
I roll my eyes. "Tea is not the solution to every problem, John."
I look around the room. "All the outfits are so extravagant. Honestly, I find my own lacking somewhat, by comparison."
"Yes, I want it. Want you. Please." I whine.
Sherlock
I pause. "Keep my eyes out for what, exactly?"
"I confess, I haven't had a chance to attend many. Not a huge fan of crowds, it seems, though." With so many people there can't possibly be enough air in this room, and I'm feeling unnaturally warm. "Perhaps we can step onto the balcony for some air?"
I look pleadingly at John for a moment. "Please, John, we don't be far. I explained to you - I need to do this. If it makes you feel any better, make sure he's unarmed."
I smile when he reaches for my hand. "You'll have to do all the work. I promise to try not to break any of your toes." Too quickly the Estate is back in sight and we are entering the main Ball Room.
Do something. Now! JW
"I've never understood why your folks did that. Right pissy of them." I start doing a basic cleanup of the kitchen. "What were they thinking?"
"Interesting." I start typing on his phone.
I smile back at him as we walk the short distance to the restaurant. The manager nods at me when we enter, and he seats us at a table near the window. "Order anything you like. Dinner's on me tonight."
Approx age late 30s to early 40s. Caucasian. Iraq. Discharged possibly recently. Iraq. Employed. -JW
I share a look with Colonel Moran.
(7:30) *text to JW* He forgot the eyeballs. SH
"Yeah yeah yeah. Unless you plan on an early dinner it won't matter. They only have," I pretend to look at a watch I don't wear, "about three hours left."
"No, I never bought anything from her - or her husband. Seems her husband got caught violating the law while the two of them lived in Florida. She hired me to help ensure that justice was properly served, and I did. She was saved the cost of a nasty divorce, and I got a cheap flat."
"I'm sure John has told you, he's not very good at relaxing, in any form." I smile at the young man. "Now if you two will excuse me, Lord Thomson has requested an audience with me..." I nod to the two of them and swept elegantly across the room.
I take his hand and stand. "I'd love to if you're sure but only if you're sure." With a nod from him I gather our blankets and follow him into Irene’s room. We were both already in what we planned to sleep in but it's far different to sleep on a floor than on a bed. "I'm going to get a bit more undressed since padding won't be an issue now." My hands shake a bit as I remove another layer of fabric.
"It would be better if we just went to sleep, but thank you." Even his voice makes me think wholly inappropriate things.
Sherlock
Once his arse touches completely down I hold him still for a moment. "Wait just a moment." After a few deep breaths I encourage him to continue.
I fall less than fifty meters from the cave when I slip on a patch of ice. The breath is knocked out of me and my vision is going dark. I wonder briefly if this is how I will die.
"John Watson. You are the dumbest intelligent person I know." The Consultant Detective took off his scarf and gloves and went over to his blogger.
A third finger... more pressure... slightly unpleasant until I manage to relax a bit more. I kiss him again - rougher this time - as my whole body trembles.
Sherlock
I pull him forward a little, letting his knees rest against the mattress between my thighs, but don't relent.
"That -was- the whole reason behind the Ball if you recall. Don't worry, the average engagement lasts at least a year."
“Who the Hell are you?" I stand between Lock and the guy that came out of the woods. "What do you want?'
"Nothing too exotic. Just tried some different herbal combinations in the stews." I didn't want him to think I'd tricked him into anything... like
“Don’t you find that odd? Given how long you two have been ‘other-than-professionally-acquainted’? You don’t
"Mum’s looking for you."
"You honestly think I'm that stupid?" I look back and forth from the brothers. "I know a fight when I see one. Even a silent one. And I know a bully too." I look directly at Mycroft now. "Tell me what's really going on. The whole story."
First Impression
I let my head drop forward again and whimper. "Four more... please?"
I say with a sad look in my eyes.
Sherlock
Relaxing against the headboard, I nod at Mycroft as he enters my bedchamber. I have thoroughly enjoyed his company these past few weeks, even though I've paid dearly for it.
I try to arch my back a little, to take the pressure of his weight off my aching arse, but he forces me back down into the mattress. Still the combination of pleasure and pain sends a shiver through me.
Haven't not slept a wink does not make for a happy soon-to-be-deployed Watson. With the obvious exception of a likely still-drunk Harry, we all gather in the breakfast room for brunch. Mum has forgone her normal pile of newspapers in favor of a crossword. The reason is soon apparent... The front page of every paper, even the local gazette, has a version of me and William dancing. The headlines range from Romantic to Ridiculous
I check him for injuries from his slip down the out cropping. "I could have told you I smelled smoke from the north. How far do you suppose we are?" I estimate we are an hour's walk at most.
“Enough. Honestly, brother, I didn’t even realize what I was doing.”
Mycroft
"No. It's easy to see... plain as the ... mask ... on your face." I give him a sly grin.
"It was weeks before I could leave the house without being afraid someone would see me. Obviously, I couldn't work for my father anymore - my very existence had a negative impact on the bakery. So, I took Daisy and left as soon as I could." I sigh. "One advantage of the guard is that they don't care about your past. I knew I'd be safe there."
I shake my head. "Dunno. Don't think it will mate. People everywhere are talking ‘bout how to find The Phoenix. I even heard a rumor, just a rumor mind you, that Lord Watson is so heart-broken he's gonna move away." People and their stupid notions of love and crap. "Tell me what happened. I need to know. Did you really cure him of an injury?"
"What do Hedgehogs even eat."
I shrug. Seb shrugs. We get up and go wash our hands. "I think she's worse than the Nun back in boarding school."
"As is that." I thrust our groins together then push my arse out into his hands and repeat.
"No! No. Don't do that."
"Ask me anything."
Unable to wait any longer I help him through his orgasm then start jacking myself off. The sight of him in the throes of pleasure that I gave him is the best thing I've ever witnessed in my life. As soon as I cum all over his legs I collapse to his side. "Sorry. I couldn't wait. Give me a few minutes and we'll continue." Afraid to see the disappointment in his eyes I cover my own with my arm.
"I know he was better at making me money. Dis so good I didn't even charge him rent. Quiet boy, him and his partner. Good people. Clean. Respectable like. Kinda pretty too." They were nice to have around.
His mouth is doing wonders for me. When I look down and see him playing with himself my cock throbs hotly. "Sher. Sherlock. That's so hot." I can see his arm as he plays with himself and his arse flexes.
Turning to my side I grab his hand in mine. "Promise me? Promise that if I don't think it's safe that we won't go back?"
I whimper when he moves away, then wrap my legs around him. "Yes, yes... I'm ready." I lean up and kiss him back.
"Did I... did I do something wrong?"
His sphincter is still fluttering as I bottom out inside him. The rhythmic clenches do nothing to stave off my release. I grab the head board and thrust into him and slowly pull til I'm almost out then thrust in again. Soon his cock starts to reinflate and I pick up my pace. Before I get going too quick or hard I lean down and kiss him.
I grab his hand and put it on my chest. "This isn't about you Holmes. It’s about me taking my pleasure from you." I come to a stop and stroke myself a few times. "Do you understand?"
Mycroft
I watch her carefully apply the poultice. "What are you using? Sweet clover?"
Mycroft
"It's always harmless when -you- do it." I grab a smoke from the pack in my jacket and blow smoke rings into the darkening sky. "There's a different set of rules for you than the ones for me."
"Sounds good. Early start and all tomorrow." The tree is hollow is deep enough for two but not side by side as much. "You want to be front or back first?"
"NO!" I jump up from the sofa and throw my arms around him, burying my face in his shoulder. "Please stay..."
"Shall I put my mask back on and we pretend there is another man my height that is also referred to as Highness?" I put the hedgehog mask that my sister had commissioned for me back on. "At least call me John. Please?'
I lay over the top of him and kiss between his shoulder blades. "14 it is." When I return to kneeling behind him I take a moment to grab his arse and massage it. It's solid muscle, like the rest of him, but the only place he doesn't have very many scars. I've often wondered if he wears every battle he's ever been in. Between the broken bones, nasty scars, and the complete apathy I found him in, he was lucky I took him in and made him my own. I saw his potential and he lived up to it. It's times like this I have to, no I get to, remind him.
"Sherlock. Please. Stay. Still." My hand had traveled down to his hip without my noticing until I found myself trailing his hip bone with my fingers.
(7:48am) *text to ICE* I guess it could be if the person who owns this phone is important. JW
"Oh, I'm such a sucker for those puppy dog eyes," I pinch his cheek playfully and take his cup. "Let me get you another cup of tea, then." Setting both cups on the tray, I get up and take it into the kitchen, where I put the kettle back on.
I hand the phone to Sherlock to see.
"Of course, it doesn't hurt that I find you incredibly sexy." I grin at him.  "But it's more than that."
Mycroft
In this chapter, John's Mum is portrayed by MoonShineD
I laugh out loud and sit with my cup. "Oh, Jimmy. You need to get out more."
Mycroft
Sherlock
"You've already suffered from Society's judgement of your character. I would hate to be fodder for more. Especially now that you've overcome it." I look up into his eyes so he can see the truth in my words. "I want nothing more than to be with you. Always. But... I wouldn't have you be harmed anymore."
"Oh, Greg. Thank you for coming on such short notice. As you can see, the evening edition has caused a bit of a problem." I glance over at John, who is rolling his eyes.
"Yes, Captain? May I help you?" I say in a sweet voice.
"If he read anything about history, he'd know that people tend to congregate and build settlements near water sources. Hence, following a river isn't too far-fetched." I comment. "Of course, he may also simply have been thirsty. Even he could figure out that a river would be a good way to fix that."
Mycroft
Already working on it. Should have information within the hour.
"I'm sorry Lock. We're both a bit on edge." I set down the vegetables for the stirfry so I can go over and hug him to me. "Greg is using everything the Yard has to work with. I'm sure Mycroft is as well. You know Greg won't let him do less than he possible could."
"Good plan, Watson. Let me help." I quickly get up from the table and follow him out, letting Jim and Sherlock hash out whatever details they need.
"Of course she has a car," I walk into the living room. "How else would she... never mind. What did you find?" I follow his gaze and see the cold cup of tea. Picking it up, I sniff it. "She would never let her soothers go to waste like this. Something is terribly wrong..."
"We... we had just finished the last of the food this morning. That's why we were looking for a hot meal and a warm night's sleep. We happened upon the smoke from your stove..."
I watch him get up and walk away, a full-body shudder going through me as I quietly get up off the bed, too, dropping to my knees.
Sherlock
"Sure... thanks..." I try to calmly set down my cup and not run from the kitchen. As soon as I'm out of her sight, I nearly sprint to our room, closing the door behind me.
"John..."
Sherlock works on his experiment while I finish preparing tea. He's cataloging the difference in ashes in the hopes that some day it will be used to tell how a fire was caused. I bring him a cup of tea in return for a kiss on the cheek. When I sit down with my feet near the fire I expect to warm up but become colder instead. I look in my lap but see no reason for the frozen feeling. The more I look and see nothing the more concerned I become.
"Yes. Every man in the district is probably there, trying to make you think they are The Phoenix." I shake my head sadly. "I knew you wouldn’t find me, of course, but I guess I hoped you would find someone of a social standing that your family approved of."
I hear birds chirping, and shift, and realizing there's weight on top of me. "John... John!" I give him a shake. "Get off me, John" He somehow managed to crawl on top of me during the night. He's warm, but this could become
Irene
"This work for you?" It's not until I let out my breath at his nod that I realise I'd been holding it. "Your turn." I get on his bed and back up til I'm leaning against the head board. As he starts to strip off his clothes I run my hand from my thigh to hip, then hip to abs, and from abs back down to thigh. Each pass bringing my hand closer to my full erection.
Sherlock
I set the rest of my grass aside and start to make a small fire to keep us warm and heat the rest of the rabbit.
Mycroft
I huff at her simplified view of my life.
If we don’t find something soon one of us won’t survive the night.
I slide a hand behind his balls to see how loose he still is from the sex we had up against the tree just a few hours ago. "You're not too sore are you?" I want him so bad but I won't hurt him.
My eyes light up. "Do tell." I go back to the couch and sit with my legs crossed under me. "Tellmetellmetellme."
I unfold my arms and place my hands on his hips. "If that's the case, Mycie, let me help you dress."
"Will you clean it?" I stop him from pulling away until I reciprocate the kiss but on the lips.
I sit up properly, put my hands on his lips, and slowly lean in to lick the tip of his flush cock. "I knew you'd be delicious."
I know how much he likes it when I swallow him that way, but part of me still wants to fight it. When he lets me loose for a second, I pull back quickly, gasping for air. I return to lick along his length - not teasing, per se, just not letting him get his way. A little act of defiance.
I seize the moment and reach up to grab his tunic. "You are entirely too dressed," I growl, pulling the tunic and vest off in one movement. Sitting up on the edge of the bed, I grab his arse and pull him to me, licking over his stiff nipples.
"You have far more practical experience in this area than I do. If you think it would be wiser to find shelter now and go to the cabin tomorrow, then that's what we should do." I nod. "How far do you think it was?"
"Uncomfortable? No. But why? Surely there are others who..." I stare into the fire quietly. I don't want him to think I would -want- sleeping with someone else.
(5:49am) *text to Shit Head* Hello? Are you going to respond? JW
Sherlock
I cough on my tea when it hits me. I force out words between coughing spells. "Marriage. Spouse. Lord. Sherlock."
I had been looking away for a moment when he said this. "Please tell me you didn't taste it to see if it was poison." He returns with the small vial and sits on the bed.
I chuckle. "Somehow, I'm not sure a life of crime on the high seas would work out for me."
The fish is beginning to smell quite delicious, and my stomach rumbles in agreement. I flip them, to ensure they're evenly cooked, and notice Mycroft watching me closely. "Afraid I don't know what I'm doing?" I grin.
"Oh. I'm sorry." I consider for a moment. "Where were you injured, if you don't mind my asking?"
I'm startled from my morning paper by the text alert on my phone. I read Sherlock's message, frowning.
Sherlock
"Well, I don't know. Alchemy has always been an interest of mine. Perhaps something related to medicine." I shrug gently, trying not to dislodge him from the comfortable spot he's got on my shoulder right now. "I think more exploration is required." I stifle a yawn.
"Oomph." Due to his momentum I end up on my arse in an easy chair with six feet of Sherlock on top of me. At first, I can't seem to figure out what happened. "Should I be worried this is going to become a pattern?"
"Will you keep your voice down? Mycroft's upstairs, you idiot." I hiss at him. I sit down next to him, looking at the paper Greg flung at me. "His
By this time Sherlock was fed up with the accusations and he prepared to leave the flat for a few hours.
"I'm sure Martha still has enemies - and 'friends,' for that matter - from before. But she's been lying low for so long, I'd be shocked if it was someone she knew." I steeple my hands, deep in thought. "And of course, I have numerous enemies, most of whom are known to you. Many of those are incarcerated at this time, due to my work."
I start thinking to myself when he looks up and his eyes bore right into my soul.
"Brain."
"Of course. I have just a bit left from last spring."
Mycroft
Mycroft
"It's really almonds, but it's surprisingly tasteless. Why do you ask? Do you not like almonds?"
"Irene gave me some suggestions, so I thought I'd try them out. Obviously you find them acceptable." I smile up at him.
Having pity on him, I relieve him of the tray, setting it on a nearby chair for the moment. "No, my brother is at home. He is quite busy, though... I'm not sure he has time in his schedule for another project."
I grab his hand, pressing it flat against my hip. "That tickles, John..." OK, it doesn't actually tickle, but he really needs to stop doing it.
I follow his lead and wrap my hand around his shaft, pumping what my mouth can’t take. I let his cock slip from my mouth with a pop, my hand now stroking his length. "You are delicious, John." I say, licking the precum from his head.
Mycroft
"I will forgive you going through my belongings and taking that mask." I look at her sternly and take a seat next to her. "I forgive you because I can tell you did it out of love for me." I pat her hand and nod for the guard to send the first one through. At first he seems somewhat possible. Correct height area, correct figure, but when he speaks to say his name, William, it takes all my control to not spit my tea everywhere at the sound of his affected lisp.
"He's cheating on me."
"It looks like someone, at least, came through this way." I point at some long-broken branches in the brush. I carefully lead Daisy down the path, keeping Mycroft as near as possible. Daisy seems to find it entertaining to try to nibble at Mycroft's hair as we walk, and I stifle a giggle.
"Maybe they broke in to get at Lord Watson... Shh." Though the few people who know Sherlock would not necessarily mind him getting hurt they definitively are not the type to do it themselves.
"Try me." Jim squints his eyes and grabs a match from on top of Mrs. Hudson's fireplace.
Mycroft
I sneak into my brother's room to take a look for myself in his full-length mirror. The mask is blood red, with enough black around the edges to blend very nicely with my curls. The jacket is a plain black - which is good, because the only dress trousers I have are plain black, too. And the shirt... damn, that red silk is a perfect match for the mask. It fits snugly, but not unpleasantly so. I brush over suit as I turn in the mirror, looking at myself from every possible angle. I jump when Greg appears next to me - I hadn't heard him come in.
I take another look at Kale, err Moran. "Why a Corporal? Really?"
Sherlock
I wake the next morning with Gregory snuffling in my neck. After I slither out from his arms I stoke the fire and take a chance to grab a sip from my flask as I unpack a small portion of the food that remains.
"Want some more, sweet pea? You need to put some meat on those bones of yours."
OK, ok... Jones finally got here to take over. I'm on my way
Sherlock saw the look on John's face and it all clicked. The fact that John was scared that Sherlock would leave him made him smile. John misinterpreted that smile to mean he was glad to have finally told him.
I grab his wrist before he can back away right out the back door. "Stop it. This isn't funny William. Or is it Sherlock?"
My eyes widen. "Move to Baker Street? Have you been drinking?"
Sherlock
"I asked you to do one thing! Just one thing Sherlock!"
"Now you're just teasing me." I frown. "Fine. I won't use anything but your name." I push him off me, and roll onto my side, facing away from him.
Sherlock
That sing-song voice of Jim's brings me out of deep sleep, and the feeling of him crawling up my legs brings a smile to my lips.
"Set up a bed?" I look around curiously. "You brought a bed?"
I rock slowly at first. I keep changing the angle minutely until he clenches up and moans loudly. Now that I know I'm hitting his good spot I speed up my pace.
"Iraq. Artillery. With the 19th. Maybe it is worth looking into." I hand him my cell.
His noncommittal answer. "You are going to be even more incorrigible than ever now." I turn away at yet another bite of food.
As he bites down I add my pinky to his entrance. Once he's as prepped as I can make him I grab his hips to position him above me with my cock head at his opening. "Take your time. However long you need."
I do as I'm told, relaxing as he works the muscles in my neck and shoulders. I shiver as his lips graze over my shoulder, momentarily distracted from where his hands are until I feel him wrap his strong fingers around my cock. "Ungh... John..." I manage to say as my mind goes blank.
"I told you, Jimmy dear, not late. The clock started when we placed the bet, remember?" I reach over and pinch his cheek with a grandmotherly smile.
I scowl at him. "Sometimes. Father often tutored quite late, and the shopping had to be done." I never really gave it any thought, that my parents spent so much time away from home.
I look at the clock.  “Fine, then.  First thing in the morning.” I sit down with a huff and start picking at the meal he’s set in front of me.
I huff. "I doubt your pride could be a truly debilitating injury." I try to help him get to his feet, but he yelps and lands back on his arse. "Your ankle?"
I reach up to kiss him again but someone tugs on the other side of the curtain.
Mrs. Hudson has gone missing. We've been left a note which suggests she did not leave of her own free will.
I shudder as I feel my cock hit the back of his throat, and a little beyond... a little more each time his head dips down. Sitting as I am, it's not possible for me to thrust against him, which is probably a good thing, all considered. I'm not sure I'd be able to control myself. My hand curls from the back of his head to the front of his neck, where I can feel his throat working against me. Unable to coherently speak, I hope my moans of pleasure are enough encouragement for him.
A sly smile comes across my lips. "Brother, didn't you want to ask Greg something?"
"No. Don't think so. No one came to our door at least." I look at the guy on the screen. "He does look a bit familiar. Keep playing."
"I would prefer you not destroy the kitchen to find a way to feed your broken heart, brother." I reach into a seldom-used upper cabinet and pull out a jar, handing it to him. "Do you want coffee with those?" When he nods, I turn to start a pot while he heads to his bedroom, grasping the jar of biscuits like a lost child. After taking him a cup and being chased out of his room by just a glare, i return to the kitchen and pour myself a cup, nursing my own broken heart silently.
Mycroft
"Come along then." Without letting go of his hand I lead him down the trail to the Gardener's shed. "There's a little bit of everything in here. Including a fridge with snacks and beer." I open one for him but just before he grabs it I pull it back a bit and smile. "Uh uh. How do I know you're 18?"
"Yes, I had a very good time. Lord Watson was... quite the gentleman, actually." I blush a little bit. "I'm surprised you didn't notice us. Seems half the journalists within a 50 mile radius did." I show him the front page of the paper I'd been reading when he arrived.
"Most fish is hard to eat, unless you have the tools to properly filet it, which I don't. On the plus side, it cooks a lot quicker than, say, rabbit.”
My jaw drop open at his obvious annoyance. "He's your brother, Mycroft. He gets fearful of crowds and he has a damn good reason. He's been left alone most of his life. It's a wonder he hasn't shut himself in completely." I slam my fist down on the table. "You are his Brother! You're all he has left of blood family and he's all you got left. I get that it's hard raising a kid, a kid too damn smart and one that tells strangers exactly what he's thinking but you gave up fairly early." I grab his cup and head to the kettle. "Just for the record -I- was the one that talked him into going. -I- gave him the mask and the jacket. -I- even drove him there."
I blush. "There's nothing wrong with being solitary. I often prefer it, myself."
"Well, this is what's come of it. Now he's gotten himself... involved. I wonder if Lord Watson really understands what he's in for, getting involved with someone like my brother."
"So you can go out but you choose not to?" My fear of his ability to consent are laid to rest. Now my heart is heavy knowing that he lives in fear of people. "How were you able to talk yourself into going to the Ball?"
"Four, maybe five days. Maybe the guard was wrong?" Or worse, maybe he was right. "Oh bloody hell."
"Why do you want him?" My hand is on my knife hilt ready to defend Sherlock. "And I repeat, who the Hell are you?"
The rustling stops.
I carefully pull myself off of him and make my way to the loo. After taking care of myself I return and toss a cold damp flannel at him which hits his head. I laugh at his startled expression. "Was Soldier Boy not ready for a wee bitty washcloth?"
"What did you do? Just tell me so I can get mad then forgive you."
"I... think I know where he's gone. Greg and I are going to go check on him, perhaps bring him back in time for dinner, if that's all right."
"Rest assured, young one, your friend is quite safe."
"I saw you with that group of 'ladies' - you were the only interesting person in the lot." Some of those 'ladies' tended to spend their nights in various bunks in the barracks - never mine, though.
"She behaving herself? Not giving you too much trouble, is she?" I tuck him into bed gently and curl up beside him.
"Mum seems to be convinced I won't be happy til I marry. Sis, because she's mean when she wants to be, suggested a Masquerade since I don't care about looks anyways. The problem is everyone knows who I am but I don't know how anyone is. With or without a mask." My leg starts to twitch and I rub at my thigh. "I've never been a fan of crowds. Or noise. Or noisy crowds."
"Poor baby. You don't seem happy ‘bout how I'm fucking you. Want me to stop?" I punctuate my words with a twist of my hips.
Sherlock
I am stunned into silence.
"No. I'm not going anywhere without you. Daisy probably wouldn't even let me ride her if you are not present." I snuggle, I mean make myself more comfortable, into him. "I will miss the closeness of these last few days." I'm embarrassed by expressing such juvenile emotions. "How do you know where the spring is?"
"Oh, don't you think she's used to it by now? She even offered to get me a key once... I prefer the challenge," I huff with a grin as I head back up the stairs. "To begin, I need to talk to my brother."
I carefully slide off Daisy's back, pulling along a half-asleep Mycroft. I hand him her reins and walk over to the cave. "By the looks of it, no one's been here in a few weeks. When did you say you left him here?"
"I've scheduled a few to return tomorrow at 7am. Lord Watson leaves at 9am, assuming he doesn't find the guy." I hand the folder with the basic info of the twenty candidates to my new assistant. "Speaking of... Have you seen Lord Watson? He should've been back hours ago."
Sherlock
Sherlock
He keeps moving his hand like he has no better idea where to put it than I did. I tug my arm out from under his and put it on top and grab his hand. "Stop fidgeting." I pull our hands into my chest. "Is this better?" My budding erection hasn't waned and his breath on my neck is sending it all the signals to grow. Whose stupid idea was this? Dying from cold would be preferable to dying from embarrassment. Maybe.
I scowl at his deflection. “Yes, brother mine. Chocolate would be delightful.” I get up and head to the living room, the paper under my arm.
Sherlock
I roll my eyes at how very dramatic Johnny has to make everything. "All over a silly boy. How stupid."
I shudder at the mention of Mycroft Holmes. "Nasty man, he is. But useful in his way. Now the rules of the game. You can't do anything to deliberately misdirect the boys, and I can't try to contact them or escape." Like I'd try to escape - this is a very comfortable flat. "With those rules, I think they should be here 2 days from now, if not sooner. What do you think?"
Sherlock
Sherlock
"Are you ready to get started, Greg?  I understand we are to use the drawing room for interviews, as needed.”
I yell out to our guest. "Hey, Martha, your boys say you've gone on vacation!"
"He sounds more like a dad than an older brother." Maybe I should at least talk with the bastard before I kill him. "Do you want to see him?'
I wake up with a start, to find that John is not in the room. Worried, I climb out of bed and tiptoe to the door, only to find That Woman kissing John breathless, right there in front of the fire. I clear my throat loudly.
I look at the crowd milling about inside. "Perhaps we could go for a walk? I have heard wonderful things about the castle gardens. We could watch the sunset..."
"Gregory." I set breakfast on the stand near the bed. "Thank you. No. I am only here this morning to discuss the favor you agreed to last night."
"Brother was mostly inventorying the Castle's library and relieving them of a few rare additions." He has seen enough of my embarrassing actions around Gregory.
"Want me to do what sweetheart?" I rub his back and squeeze him tighter.
I chuckle at his facetious apology, and let him unravel himself from my limbs.
Sherlock
"I like to solve puzzles, but I rarely have time anymore.”
"Of course, of course. You didn't do so well at Epson Downs last weekend. Perhaps researching the horses more thoroughly would help - picking them based on 'lucky numbers' or jockey 'attributes' isn't a reliable way to do it, you know." I nod.
"What happened?"
"What else do you see, William?" I lean my elbow on the railing and look up at him.
It's been a long and grueling couple of days. The last rainstorm caused me to lose my bearings and washed my arrows away. I spot a small cave that I hope to the Gods is free from any hibernating animals since it’s my only hope to survive another night in this frozen forest.
"Likely true." I rise to my feet. "I want to come home, Mycroft. Am I welcome?"
"Hey you didn't burn anything down or let it die." I ruffle his hair
With a sly smile, I climb over him, sliding my body down his, kissing my way down his chest and stomach, smoothing my thumbs over his hip bones as I brush my stubbled cheek over his cock.
I let out a cry at the last impact, my last shred of control gone. "14... Thank you, sir," I sob, my whole body trembling at this point.
“Take him to dinner.”
I bite my lip to keep from giggling, which would be wholly inappropriate given the current topic. "I noticed you're rubbing your shoulder, yet you complain of a limp and walk with a cane. Your limp is psychosomatic, of course. And right now, your hands are perfectly steady - likely because you're under pressure, trying to impress..."
(3:45am) *text to lost phone* Happy you found it. Yeah, he was cute. Something about the smile. JW
Sherlock
I chuckle, and grab hold of his hand. "Pay attention to the road, Gregory..." I give his hand a squeeze. "Save that until after lunch, hm?"
His command makes me moan and I can feel my brain relaxing. I stop sucking and focus on licking his cock from base to tip and back again. I pay particular attention to the vein on the underside, intermixing kitten licks with long stripes before suckling on the head again.
The Sun has barely moved when Sherlock comes out if the woods with a small blonde man. They are pulling a sled behind them with the remains of a freshly killed deer. I go to stand and yell when Gregory puts his arm around me with his hand over my mouth.
"Sorry..." I look up at him. "I-I'll do better," I say with the slightest of whines in my tone.
I look over and see that he is holding the rabbit up by its hind leg about as far away from him as possible. "I expect you to take the innards out and put it on that flat rock by the fire. Unless you prefer your hare rare." If he didn't look so adorably pathetic I would be laughing my arse off.
Sholto. Damn him. "John, you just got home. Wait a while." I change tactics and try a sweeter approach.
Mycroft
"Not a couple. He asked her to the ball only because he couldn't work up the courage to ask the person he really wanted to bring... her brother." I chuckle lightly.
"I'm fine, really... I'm fine. Jimmy and Seb are really delightful boys. Jimmy was just feeling a bit... well, left out." I lead Sherlock inside and close the door.
"I don't think I'll ever be able to give you an Estate, or all the books, or even guarantee you'll always have a comfortable bed to sleep in... But I promise you this: you will always have a home with me. Wherever you go is my home." I'd follow him anywhere, and most likely will have to drag him out of a few places as well.
John knew he had to have done something or, worse, he planned to do something. "What are you planning?"
I look horrified. "My coat? How will I stay warm if I'm sleeping ON my coat? Shouldn't I be wearing it?"
Mycroft
In my dream the Earth was shaking and soft snow was falling everywhere. I could hear the wind call me name and tried to answer but I was too tired.
"Oh!" I jump up to try and help him back to his feet, but he decides to just sit on the floor. "Would like me to call him for you, dear? I don't think you're in a fit state to talk to him right now."
I put my head on the back of the sofa and just start to drift off with one hand running up his leg and the other resting on his foot. "Good. I want everything I do to you to feel nice. Or better than nice." His regal features are enhanced by the glow of the fire light. After a while my back starts to ache in this position. "Be a dear and go sleep in the bed so you're not all cramped up tomorrow."
Mycroft
I let go with one hand and take him deeper into my mouth. The tip is just about to my throat with still five or six centimetres to go. I do a slow bobbing action as I twist my hand. It's one of his favourites and quite possibly what sealed this job for me.
Sherlock
"Sherlock says everything I do is annoying." There have been no others, only ever Gregory.
Mycroft
"Well, Greg helped... convinced me that I could do it, I guess. Being anonymous helped. I just didn't want Mycroft to find out I was there. He would be very upset with me."  I stand up and finish dressing. "And once I was there, chatting with you put me at ease, too."
I sputter and almost trip on nothing at her calm declaration of the reason behind the mob. "M'sorry. Musta heard wrong. What? My Phoenix? Is them? No." I walk away from her and back to the secret passage.
"By then, I thought it was just that you needed the money, but were too proud to ask for help. I didn't want to force you or your brother to go without." I shrug.
I can only think of one way to shut him up - I turn his face toward me and press my lips to his.
I intersperse our kisses with my own observations of him. "When you smile the left side of your mouth goes up slightly more than the right." I lean down to kiss his neck before I gently nip his ear. "You prefer sweeter fruit in the evening." I kiss my way across his jaw to the other side. "You'll choose coffee over tea but you know that I prefer tea so you drink it without complaint." I kiss down his neck to graze my teeth on his collar bone. "You are developing silver in your hair even though you've not reached thirty years of age."
Sherlock
I huff. "Even I wouldn't expect tea out in the wilderness." I step closer to the fire, crouching to warm my hands. "My brother wasn't totally heartless, it seems," I pull out the bread and flask he left with me, offering some to John. It only seems fair, given that he shared his jerky with me last night (even if it did taste like shoe leather).
"Indeed they do." He tosses me half an apple and I catch it, taking a big bite with a smile.  "I used to make a delicious honeyed apple topping for fish. Everyone who tried it loved it. Maybe I'll make that for you sometime, when I have the tools to properly filet a fish, yeah?"
"I am aware of that. I am also aware that although you had your cane with you when you met me by the fountain, you left it lying in the brush when we hid to dodge my... that Red Ferret and the Silver Fox. Since then we've walked the grounds and done a fair amount of dancing, and you've not limped even once." I smile.
"I told you..." I say through gritted teeth as he swivels his hips deliciously
"There was no one else I could even imagine being with." I shudder when I think of Lord Moffat touching me and offering me coin for favors. "Once it was suggested I sell my... services. I deduced that you would not only be interested but capable and willing." If I could have you no other way this way would suffice.
I stifle a laugh at the look on Jim's face right now... being bested by a little old lady... He glares at me and I quickly turn away, to keep from laughing out loud.
I lean over and give him a peck on the lips, escaping just before he can pull me back into bed. "I do love you. But we must."
"Watson pegged me right away for former military, of course. Asked if I'd served in Iraq." I rub his calves when I feel him tense up at that. "Didn't give him my real name, of course. Just friendly conversation."
I chuckle lightly, stroking my hand across his back as he rests his weight on me. "And you me... twice. Quite impressive." I rub my cheek against his hair.
"I'm good at being bad. And Seb. I'm good at Seb. And bad at Seb. I want my Sebby." I try to dig for my phone but end up rolling off the couch instead.
I grind my hips against his as he draws his fingers lightly down my chest. When his hands reach my trousers i raise my hips slightly, and he slips my trousers down my thighs, freeing my rapidly-hardening cock.
"You wouldn't." Sherlock glares as he folds his arms.
"If your parents adopted a fey child it would've been you, not him." Maybe that's his secret? He's half fey and half ... No. He's Sherlock. That's it. That's all. That's more than enough. "We should take the place from the back. Let me scope it out before you run in half-cocked and get your head blown off. I've grown quite used to it."
Mycroft
Sherlock
"I will make a note of it." I nod, wriggling anxiously underneath his weight.
"Come on..." I coax him softly. "We've earned a bit of a break. We'll be back on his trail at first light. Come enjoy the moment, hm?"
As I stand I become aware of my completely nude state. I grab the nearest pillow and cover my cock. "Oops?"
(3:32pm) *text to JH* ?? SH
"It wouldn't be right for me to make him choose between his family or me. Generally speaking, the one making such an ultimatum is the one who loses, you know."
After he helps hoist me up the first branch I quickly scale the tree, get the location set in my head, and get down. "Don't think I didn't know that me climbing was your plan all along. I wouldn't have gone for it ‘cept you'd probably break your posh neck if you tried." I check the traps to find them empty.
He leans in much closer than he needs to when he speaks to me. His breath touches my ear and causes me a small shiver. "Much. Thank you." I see now what he meant by rolling your hips.
"Gregory?" I can barely speak but I feel the need to try. I don't know what to say or. how to ask. I've never been confused as much before.
I comb my fingers through his hair with a grin, but say nothing. I growl as he kisses and nips at my collar bone.
"Did someone tell you that?" He and my therapist would get along fabulously. Maybe he should go next time.
My mouth twists as I consider his words. As much as I hate to admit it, he's right. "All right, then."
I stare at my phone impatiently until a text from my brother arrives. I jump up off the sofa, striding quickly to grab my coat. "Come, John - we have a wolf to catch."
I walk around a bit after I'm finally off that weapon of pain. "What’s her name?" I pet the beautiful horse. Her mane is a silver black color and she is quite fitting her master who's dark. hair is showing signs of early silver streaks.
I set the mask back on the pillow beside me to it won't get harmed. "Promised Mum I'd give her til midnight tonight to find my partner from the Ball. When that doesn't happen, and I think we all know it won't happen, then I officially sign up with Sholto's crew and head back to the Desert for four years."
"Interesting. Mugwort can be toxic..."
"I'm sure we can put together something. I think I have enough stew left over from yesterday evening for all of us. Finish your tea, John..." I smile at him.
I nudge Greg's arm and direct him back to the kitchen where we can chat. "Don't mind him. I burned the last batch of biscuits I made, and he's been grumpy about it for days."
"No, just the one bowl is plenty for now, thank you." I smile in a friendly way. I feel very... odd. I wonder if I can wake John and ask him. Maybe he was right about this woman. "I think I'll go check on John, if you don't mind."
"Just how much information did you give my boys? And when?"
"I can make you a dessert that would curl your toes, darlin'." I reach up and kiss him, trying to distract him from all this talking.
"NoPe! I -know- you are.  What do people normally say?"
"Yeah, sorry bout that." I lean my head back on to his shoulder and look through some branches to see the stars. "We'll be at the cottage tomorrow and you'll be heading for home before you know it. You still plan on going home?"
I come rushing out of the kitchen, wiping my hands on the apron I'm wearing. "What is it, Greg? What's wrong?" I'm almost in a panic.
I hand him a small hunk of cheese with some bread that I made yesterday. "I would like to get going again as soon as you're done."
Stifling a laugh, I pull back and let him slip out of my mouth. "What's in it for me, if I do that for you?" I grin up at him, teasing him with the tip of my tongue.
(3:24pm) *text to JW* Piss off. SH
My eyes narrow. “You’re lying. You’re a terrible liar, brother.”
"Hmm. NoPe. If you had been a good, quiet boy you would already be fucking me by now. Instead I'm going to take my time and make you beg to cum." Helps that his dick is always sweet and clean tasting.
Sherlock shook his head.
"All right. Irene is probably waiting on us." I get up from the bench and take his hand, letting him lead me indoors.
Wiggling... oh gods. "Just... hold still." He finally stops fidgeting, and I breathe a sigh of relief. "Much better."
I jump when I hear the kitchen door open, and see a very annoyed Mrs. Hudson standing there, holding out a bag. "Yes, ma'am," I reply quietly, taking the bag from her. "Thank you, ma'am." I nod, turning to walk down driveway to the garage where I parked my motorcycle.
I help him get off me without further injury to either if us. "Oh, well I guess you'll want to follow him... The one who brought you here... Your date." I brush leaves and dirt off my backside. William is still quite clean since he was on me instead of the dirt.
Sherlock
I laugh at his haughty attitude even during sex. "Never change Mycroft Alexander Holmes." I nip at his hickey then commence riding him for my sole pleasure alone.
I shiver as his finger slides into me. My cock twitches in response, as well, so I take his earlier suggestion and stroke it slowly. The hard flesh is still slightly slick from John's oiled hands earlier. All these sensations... my eyes flutter closed.
All I can do is nod. He makes a good point but I still think she had something more sinister in mind. "If you insist."
"Sunrise. So be it." I roll to my side facing away from him and close my eyes. I do not need him to tell me if I can or should not have some of my own Brandy.  "Good Night."
Give me 20 minutes.
Mycroft
"But he's your little brother. That's what younger siblings always think of their older siblings."
Mmm "Sex and everything aside, I love you." I lay on my stomach feeling completely relaxed.
Sherlock
(7:02pm) *text to body buyer* What? No! What makes you think I have access to dead bodies?!?! JW
I turn us with the music, and glance at the man John selected. "Unhappy marriage. You see how he's holding his partner? That's his wife. Every time he takes notice of another woman, her grip on his shoulder tightens."
After bringing the deer round back, and checking out the boot prints, I go and find Lock in the garden. "There were two sets of footprints." I sit down next to him and wait for an eventual response.
I move closer to him, finding some rocks under the water that make a perfect seat, and pulling him into my lap. "Now, where was I?" I chuckle, nibbling on his neck some more.
"Wha- jealous? Really?" My eyes are glittering with amusement when Jim and Seb walk back into the kitchen and take a seat at the table.
I stop the kiss because I hear something out of the norm. I look around and see Sherlock at the bedroom door. "Sherlock!" I jump up and the Sherlock in my lap almost falls to the ground. "How can you be there? And here?" I look from the Lock by the door to the one next to me but the one next to me starts to transform into something, someone else. "You? How? Why were you kissing me?" The woman looks smug as she stands and flicks imaginary dust off her gown. "I. I. Uhh. I." I push past the woman and storm out the front door.
I grab a flannel to rinse all the soap off of him. I take my time making sure his penis is free of the gel as well. "First I'm going to lick that plump arse of yours, then I'm going to suck that long cock before I return to opening you up with my fingers and tongue."
After a moment I pull away and busy myself with fixing his jacket. "Yes, good idea. Help me up." Once I'm standing with my arm around his shoulder I can't help but make a small joke. "It really is good tea though."
"Definitely. I bet when the morning paper came out, his wife gave him an earful." I chuckle to myself.
As I add a second finger I hum around the head of his cock. I encourage him to set the pace by putting my hand on his hip and guiding him forward into mouth then back onto my fingers.
Sherlock
My knees are actually shaking now. "John... John... wait..." I pant. I have no confidence that I'll be able to stay on my feet any longer if he continues, and God, do I want him to continue. "Bed... please..." He smiles up at me and pulls his fingers away, eliciting a whine from me, and turns off the taps. With a last lick up my length, he gets to his feet. I attempt to step out of the shower, but these wobbly knees... I manage to tear the shower curtain off the rod.
I switch back to the other side and caress his cheek with the paddle. I wait almost a minute, just when he starts squirming, to pull my hand back and barely tap him. Then I do it again but at full strength. "Such a good fishy. You should see this arse. The bubble butt all red and glowing." A weird thought of a glowing red goldfish crosses my mind. I wonder what I would need to create one.
"It'll be fine once we put your coat over it." After we're done making up a bed I take a quick look at the rabbits that are cooking nicely.
Sherlock
"It's good to know someone who understands." I say.
Irene
"Uh... nothing, brother." I glare at Greg a moment. "Greg stopped by with a special evening edition of the paper for us."
"But I'm naked! I can't -" I immediately stop whining when he glares at me, and quietly move closer to the fire, trying to get close enough for warmth without actually standing in the snow.
Sherlock
A sudden realization occurs to me. "You mean, you plan on sleeping NAKED?" I'm positively horrified, and it shows.
I stretch and yawn. "I'm sure we can work out an equitable trade. In the morning." I pull his warm body close and close my eyes.
"We're going to freeze out here..." I continue to whine. "Once it's light out, we need to find our way home."
I put some of my bread and cheese onto his plate. "You are going to eat that. And you don’t need this." I comment, taking the flask of brandy from him "And no sneaking it off to Daisy this time."
working on it.
Lord Watson lets go of my arm, and gets to his feet, offering me a hand to get up as well, which I refuse angrily. "What the fu... what is going on, My Lord?"
"Good thing you know better then. I -always- have the best of motives." I wiggle my arse a bit to get him to hurry up. My cock tries to wake up when he calls me Gregory in his posh voice.
I'm still staring at him in shock. "After all that, after knowing what you know, you still want me?  Why?"
I bow deeply. "It is a pleasure to meet you, officially this time." I smile at her.
Irene
"Left out? What do you mean?"
"Well, um... it's like John said. We were heading from Whitby to Russell and got lost."
"Dinner will be ready soon. Sherlock, did you find the herbs I asked you to get me? I'll be needing them later."
"I-I'm Sherlock. I-I have no idea how I got here. I suspect my brother was involved, though."
What? No. Shut up self. We don't call men beautiful.
"Cool your jets, ace. It's obvious it isn't for you so it has to be for someone else. If it were for a lady, she woulda sent you with a list and specific brands. So that means it has to be for a guy. It's not all the hard to figure out. It's called deduction." Inside I am laughing at his look of... Sherlockiness.
"Greg says the guy is Jim Moriarty. I think he means the same one you referred to as posher and gayer than Mycroft."
Too busy for me? Pfft.
I huff. "Yes, I've seen me. I do own a mirror." I roll my eyes.
My breath is ragged as I continue to thrust into his slick hands. My fingers curl tightly into the bedding as my orgasm overtakes me, and I spill over his hands and onto my stomach. He strokes me through until I relax, the waves of pleasure finally ebbing.
I can feel him swallow around my cock, and it's the most exquisite feeling. My fingers curl into his hair, holding him steady for just a moment before I pull him back slightly, so he can take a breath before I push him back down. "Just like that, darlin'... just like that..." I growl as I control his movements. I can feel the familiar curl of sensation in my groin.
I suck him down as far as possible and swallow around the head in my throat. My eyes are watering and my breath is coming in pants.
I can't exactly see what's he's writing, but by the strokes of his hand, it appears to be drawing, rather than writing. "Whatcha drawin', darlin'?" I ask quietly.
Sherlock overheard a conversation between the Royal Family.
"Will you let me? Let me help you?" I hold him close, rubbing my hands up and down his back soothingly.
"You shouldn't lie to old ladies. They'll steal your breath while you sleep." A stretch and yawn and I'm awake.
"Some men don't get the subtleties - you have to be very specific and direct with them. And things said... ahem... in the bedroom, don't count. If you love him, tell him. If you don't, let him go. It's really quite simple." I shrug. "I don't know why some people make it so complicated. It took an age for Sherlock and John to get to that point. Even that horrible brother of Sherlock's recognized it before they did."
"Now boys, stop that." I snap. All eyes turn to me. "We're going to have a nice, peaceful dinner. Then John, Sherlock and I are going to head back to Baker Street and get things ready so that you two" nodding at Jimmy and Sebastian "can get moved into 221C by the end of the week."
"Sherlock
"It might take me a few more min---" Of course, I'm talking to dead air. I make my way inside and off towards the left before I am accosted by the Red Ferret again.
"I told you before, I like to solve logic puzzles."
"Or we can stay like this."
He arches when I grab his pecs and dig my finger nails in deep. "Uhhhhg. Just like that." I bounce harder each time I drop down.
Irene
"It's not that I don't want to... just haven't met the right person, I guess." I shrug. "And my... family makes it difficult."
Sherlock
Sherlock
His kiss is tentative either due to his inexperience or the thought I may not return it. I can help on both those accounts. I place my hand on his jaw and ease up on the pressure a bit as I tilt my head slightly. His body starts to relax against me again.
I must look like a deranged fish with dark crumbs coming out of my mouth as I just stood there and stared.
And why are you using John's phone again, brother?
(3:02pm) *text to John btw* You not only texted her three times in three minutes but you offered her two choices so she could opt for the more casual one. You reminded her of your name so you assume she often gives her number out yet you still tried to reach her. Finally, and most telling, you responded after you knew this wasn't her number. SH
I let him pull me forward, parting my lips as his cock brushes against them. I flick my tongue over the head, and try not to smile at his response to it.
(7:50am) *text to ICE* Not saying unimportant people don't need their phone for important things. JW
As John hands me the envelope, a small piece of red ribbon falls out of it. "Of course!" I nearly knock over the table as I jump up. "Charles Perrault. Red Riding Hood. Come along, John. We need to talk to my brother and see if he has any information on his infernal cameras." I sweep back out of the flat and head upstairs to retrieve my phone.
I sort through the pile of clothes I'm huddled under, and pick out mine, putting them on while exposing as little skin as possible to the cool cave air. "I read something the stars being used as navigational tools once. I don't know how to do it though... must've forgotten it." I pull my boots back on and shiver. "How far is it?"
I barely glance in that direction. "No. But I would love to chat with you about your time in Afghanistan." I try to take his arm and lead him out of the crowd.
When I hear the door close, I let out the laugh I've been stifling. I start to get to my feet, but John holds me back.
"NoPe." I plant a series of kisses on his neck. "I don't want you to work anymore. It's boring. You need to stay here and play with me and Martha."
"Must be why we get along so well." We've come to a fork in the path, and I stop for a moment. "Let's go down this path. I hear water nearby - he might have thought to follow it."
"You went to Baker Street?" I stand up and pace. "You. Went. To. Baker. Street!"
I reach into the tree hollow and grab my coat, slipping it on quickly. "Come on, John!" I'm anxious to leave.
(4:29am) *text to Blonde* Married to my work. SH
"No, thanks." I watch as she turns to finish cooking. "You cook for Holmes?"
"As skilled as you are with your hands, Mycroft, I think I want more than that tonight." I loosen the drawstring on my trousers. "Your mouth is just as talented, after all."
"Tsk, tsk. No one is all bad," I get up and squeeze onto the sofa next to him, rearranging him so he's sitting upright, and I have an arm around his shoulders. "Even Frank had his good points," I say, thinking back wistfully. I give Jimmy's shoulders a squeeze. "You just need to find something that you're good at."
"Let. Me. Help." I lean in and kiss his cheek softly. "I'm not leaving you here. I need you to help me find your brother." I move closer to him and put my arms around him gently, holding him to me.
I reply with a mouthful of jerky. "Tastes awful too. Its jerky, you know, dried animal meat. Lots of vitamins and proteins." I rip it in half and hand it to him. "Eating will help warm you up."
"All of them! Not you. All of them but you. Idiots." I give up on my biscuit quest. "What did Lord Watson say to his Mum? Did he agree with her? He seemed like a nice enough bloke. Shame really. Even the nice ones care about how everything looks. Why can someone just not care about looks for one goddammed moment and care about how it feels instead?! But noooooo. All that matters is what it -looks like-." I keep thinking about my fight with Mycroft. "Good for you I say! Getting out of there before you got invested! Not gonna let him make you his dirty secret. No sir! Not Sherlock! Proud of you.  I wouldn't tell them who was under that mask even if you told me too!"
"John Watson. You are the dumbest intelligent person I know." The Consultant Detective took off his scarf and gloves and went over to his blogger.
I press my body into his as I pull his head down a bit. Our noses bump into each other first and I giggle at how unsuave it all is. My lips brush his, in no hurry to speed this first kiss into anything more. As I feel him relax I swipe my tongue against his lower lip then retreat it.
Sherlock
"So close. It was 10. I won't add any for being wrong, this time. Next time say you don't know instead of guessing. If I wasn't feeling so generous we would start all over." I grab his neck and forcibly turn his head, so he can see my eyes. "You know how much I hate guesses."
I hug my Mum and give her a quick twirl. "I found him. Mum, this is Sherlock, aka Phoenix, aka William." I take Lock's hand as I introduce him to Mum. "Lock, this is my Mum, Lady Dove of Clan Watson."
"Did he say where he served? Perhaps my brother could prove useful after all..."
"What we -should- do..." I arch my back so he can pull off my belt "and what I -want- to do are not the same thing." I lean up and nip at his chest.
"N-no... just surprised me. I wasn't expecting... that. Do continue..." I focus on relaxing against the wall again.
Leaning up against the wall, I'm pleasantly relaxed, almost drifting, when I feel his hands part me, and his tongue tease at the sensitive flesh. I jump in surprise. "Oh!" I freeze for a moment, and look over my shoulder at him.
It's odd for John to be suddenly so sleepy. I know chamomile tea can be relaxing - many people drink it to aid in sleep, after all - but it shouldn't knock him out like this.
(5:10am) *text to SH* Why? JW
I settle my nerves and climb in after him. It takes a moment to get comfortable leaning on his chest. I pull his coat on top of us and bring his hands into my chest area. "Comfy? Not to unpleasant I hope." I wiggle a bit to dislodge a pokey twig.
leaving. He sank to his chair with an oomph. "Oh."
I laugh at the seriousness of his question. "I don't know. Will you do this every time you want me underneath you?" My smile slips away, and my face reddens as I realise what I said could have many different meanings. "Crap. That's not what I mean. I meant... oh bugger."
I push back against him with a shiver that has nothing to do with the ambient temperature of the cave.
Mycroft
Whatever. After a moment I notice he's going too far away. "Sherlock! Get back here! Right now!" He has the gall to flap his hand at me and keep walking. I finally catch up to him and try to turn him around. "Look, sorry I teased you, but it happens a lot. It's a beginner's thing to do and an old timers thing to joke about it."
I drag my fingers along his rapidly-hardening cock. "Me? A tease? Perish the thought..." I smile up at him.
Sherlock
I think for a moment. "We left them in a cave a couple of days ago. We didn't want to weigh ourselves down for the trek back, since we didn't know how long it would be. We made sure we would be able to find our way back there later, of course."
Having seen all this posturing before I just roll my eyes and sit back.
Once finished with my rabbit I hand him my knife. "Here, maybe a sharper knife will work." His hands look like a musician’s hands, or a doctor, or someone who -should- be a doctor or musician. The fingers are long and lean but obviously strong and dexterous.
Mycroft
"Jim, darling, you are a madman. And the old woman isn't much better." I say quietly. I can tell he's only pretending to be asleep now. I wonder how much he heard.
Mwah. Mwah. I air kiss both her cheeks. "Oh he's ALWAYS HUNGRY. ISNT THAT RIGHT, SEB??" I yell down the hall and grin when I hear the click of the bedroom’s door to the outside close.
"You can't. No one can." I try to push him off but lack strength and will. "Is there a place I could rest just for a bit?"
"I can't heeearrr you. Louder." Pleasepleaseplease.
I start shifting uncomfortably. “She did need a stable boy, but that wasn’t why she called for me. She’d seen me a few times, making deliveries, and I guess, liked what she’d seen. I found out much later that she’d offered my father money to take me in when I was younger, but he’d refused. Now that I was of age, she just decided to ‘hire’ me directly.” Mycroft looks at me, concerned. “What do you mean… ‘hire’ you?” I wave off his question and continue with my story. “Alicia knew all the right things to say – how horrible her life with Lord Smallwood was, how she would take care of me... It didn’t take much for her to talk me into her bed.” I blush. I take a deep breath. “Officially, I was the stable boy, of course. Keeping up appearances and all. But everyone knew what my real job was. Of course, I was completely besotted with her, so I didn’t care.”
Pfft. "Yeah, I went to Baker Street. It's not like they know who I am. No risk.  I'll tell you, Watson looked like he hadn't slept in a week. They must really be worried about her," I nod toward the kitchen.
"Yes, John." I gaze up at him. "I will do my best."
"Perfect." I get off the bed and help him up. I grab the lube before I follow him to Mycroft’s en suite.
Sherlock
I relax into the familiar sensation of his finger pressing into me, trembling and writhing when he presses my prostate again. The warmth curling in my groin grows exponentially every time he does.
"You didn't. You didn't see. Didn't see?!?! What the hell am I paying you for if you don't see?? I don't pay you to think! Get. Out. NOW! Both of you report to Seb. NOW!" I squint at the old woman still calmly holding her tea. Who does she think she is! "You. You. You've ruined them. They're useless now. Only I'm allowed to manipulate the help."
(3:11pm) *text to SH* Yes. Why? JW
I smile internally.
Mycroft
My coffee spills on the autopsy report I had been working on. "Sherlock. Umm. What?"
"Why, no. Haven't seen anyone out this way in months." I reply smoothly. "Would you like to come in? I have a pot of stew on, if you and your... friend... are hungry." I look over his shoulder at the skinny man behind him.
(7:18p) *text to SH* Don't you already have an assistant? Billy? JW
"Ha. Oh dear Martha. You are a fun one. There's an opening in my business if you're interested. We could use some old school talent like yours."
His warm breath on my neck just heightens my own arousal. "Um... no... I think you're doing plenty." It's a good thing he can't see the beautiful shade of crimson my face probably is right now. Here I am, on the verge of freezing, and my cock has other things in mind...
"Does it look recently vacated? Any signs of movers?" I start to push past him to get to the flat.
"What's that supposed to mean?" John looked up at Sherlock in confusion. He went to stand up but Sherlock pushed him back down then got on his knees in front of him.
"But... you CAN'T..." The pitch of my voice almost sounds like panic.
I smile at him a little. "Now how would I maintain anonymity if I did that?" I reply with a chuckle.
"All right. Good night, Sherlock."
"It's Miss. Irene Adler. You may call me Irene." I smile at him seductively.
"It was the other way ‘round I think." I stretch and make to grab the blankets so we can get up.
"Sit. Stay. He's fine." I put my arm on the back of the couch and play gently scratch my fingertips against his jaw. "He needs the sleep. You wouldn't want to disturb that, would you?"
I reach up and cup his face in my hands as he kisses me, soft and slow. Every slick movement earns a whimper or moan from me. The fullness of him inside me is better than I ever could have imagined in my wildest dreams.
do you have an address?
Mycroft
"If that's what you want, dear," I shrug. "But I'm going to go take a hot bath and go to bed, if that's all right."
I walk back into Mrs. Hudson's flat. "Charles Perrault, John. Do keep up." I flop onto Mrs. Hudson's sofa. "Author of Red Riding Hood in the 17th century. Hence, the references to Grandma and the Wolf in the note, and the red ribbon in the envelope." I huff. "It seems we are meant to be Red Riding Hood."
"I would never do that!" I'm appalled he'd even think that of me. "No... I was... well... Lady Smallwood took me in when I was just a young man..." I rake my fingers nervously through my hair, unable to look him in the eye. I may not have been paid in coin, but I sold myself nonetheless.
"I think... I think..." Dear Lords what do I think? "Why would it even matter? It's not as if you want more than what we have." I scoff at my stupid romantic notions. I'm almost as bad as my baby brother. "As it is, you, a Captain of the Guard should want less of my attention so that you can find yourself a wife, a mother for the kids you should have."
"I noticed he has a weird scar. Looked like he had a wolf wearing a crown branded into his forearm." Before I get a chance to text that to Mycroft my phone beeps with an incoming picture message. It's a photo of Kalle in fatigues.
Dammit All! "Bollocks. I do smell something. Not saying it's definitely smoke but it's definitely something."
I gasp as he wraps his warm hand around my rapidly-hardening cock. "I... I..."
Mycroft
Mycroft
"Then. First thing I am going to do is put that beautifully long cock of yours into my mouth and give you the best blow job until you cum down my throat. It will help your body and mind relax so I can prep your lush arse to take me." He quickly goes from nodding along to huge open eyes. "Good. You are paying attention."
"Yeah, um," I run my fingers nervously through my hair. "Ain't lookin' to get married. Not Jim's type of relationship." I shrug.
I'm starting to whine when he swats me hard. "Four." I shift my knees slightly, trying to get a little bit more comfortable without moving much.
"That, John, is another question for my brother." I take a screenshot of the mystery man and Mrs. Hudson, and send it to Mycroft.
Mycroft
"Ah. Yes. I see." The specter of her presence seems to surround us at the mention of her name.
Once we enter his room I whip off his towel. "Bed. Now."
My hands are shaking as I stroke over his thighs, not nearly as gently as before.
Mycroft
It's not been to long but the pain in my ankle has turned to a dull throb. I could attempt to walk again but this is quite nice. "I don’t know. Maybe twenty minutes or so."
I swear I just want to smack him sometimes. "Yeah yeah yeah. Come on Princess." We head for the cottage.
With the contented side, I snuggle up against John's warm body, only for him to move away. "Jawn, hold still. I'm freezing." I mumble.
The moment he cums I immediately follow. The relief is so intense I get dizzy. "Gods I love you." I collapse next to him and grab his hand to intertwine with mine.
Mycroft
(7:12p). *text to useless goldfish* Shame. Let me know if you change your mind. I'm currently looking for a new assistant. SH
I open my legs wider so he has more room to explore with his bolder touching. Releasing his hair I put that hand under my balls and tug them slightly to show him something I like. I stroke up and down my shaft a few times before returning to tugging on his curls.
I start to feel a bit chill and open my eyes to find the sky has begun to turn grey with sunrise, and our fire is almost completely out. Slipping out from under the blankets, I tuck them firmly around Mycroft's slender form, and tend to the fire a bit, getting it just hot enough for me to make some tea.
"Please..." I whisper weakly. "Tell me." I squirm under him.
"M'not hungry." Lack of proper rest seems to be catching up with me.
He's found that spot again - his cock rubs it much more insistently than his fingertips did - and I feel like every nerve ending is aflame. My own dick is in dire need of attention, too, as I try to arch against him for some friction.
Mycroft
I open my eyes and sit up as he hands me a cup of tea. It's too early for bad tea so I must hope it turned out better than the fish. "This is decent." I wave off the food. Eating in the morning has never been easy for me.
"I know she tried to seduce us, and has been drugging us, but on the other hand, she's also kept us warm, fed, and ALIVE for the past month. Surely leaving her the cuts she's asked for isn't too much trouble?" I'm only trying to be fair to her. I've learned quite a bit from her, after all.
My fingers dig into his hips as I fuck him hard, a fine sheen on sweat on my chest from the effort. The soreness of my arse and the slight burn of the lube have blended beautifully with his body's tight grip on my cock and the sight of the blissed-out look on his face as he strokes himself.
"Okiedokie. Best of luck to you." Borrrring. So borrrring. Shopping for milk?? Poor Sherlock. Such a sad ending for what promised to be such an entertaining story. I shake my head softly before an idea pops in my mind.
"He's gone Mum. I doubt he'll ever come back."
"Mmph," I mumble, careful not to glare at him as I clean up with the cold flannel. "You're lucky you're so damn adorable," I say under my breath.
"Hello?? Delivery. Anyone Home?" I try to make a point to drop off all deliveries to the Holmes house myself. It's mostly to say to my friend Sherlock, but catching a peek at his brother definitely doesn't hurt. "De-LIVE-er-Y."
"Oh. Good. That’s good. Yeah." I blush as I realise I implied he was capable of killing a man for hire. For the greater good? Sure. But not for hire. "Sorry love. Guess I got carried away."
"I want you to ruin me for anyone else." I reach up and pull him back into another kiss.
I encourage Gregory to kiss all his discomfort into me. "Soon. One more. Can you do that for me? Take one more?"
What can you find out about this Sebastian Moran? More than you found about Moriarty, I hope.
Sherlock
A buzz at the door tells me dinner has arrived. I open the door to a rough looking gent. It makes me think back to my first meeting with Lock. "Afghanistan or Iraq?" It was the memory that made me blurt that out I suppose.
I grab his hand and roughly pull him back down next to me. "No, your land is what you HAVE, not what you ARE." I stress to him. "I want YOU, not what you HAVE. You could be as poor as I am, and I wouldn't care."
Irene
I look away, feigning innocence with a grin. “Speaking of cleaning, I should clean up the kitchen. Perhaps bake some more biscuits for you. Chocolate, this time?” I smile sweetly.
"Oh good. You actually got a decent size." I gather some snow and put it in the bark. "Now we leave it by the fire for a few hours and the dirty stuff will sink."
I set the paddle next to him and pet his back side when I get behind him. With his head down and arse up I can't see his face but I know well the expression he's wearing. "It's been too long hasn't it. I've been neglectful and will make it up to you. It's a good thing you don't have to sit while tending bar ‘cause you won't be sitting comfortably for a while." I reach a lubed hand between his legs and fasten the cock ring.
"For the love of. Sherlock!" He looks around the fire at me. "Get your arse on this side of the fire. There's a reason I put it in the entrance so we wouldn't have to be in the snow to use it." No one can be that stupid.
Sherlock
"Luckily, the Chief guard didn't see it - I suspect I might have gotten a bit of a stern talking-to. I was
"John!" I rush over to him. "Are you all right? Did you break anything?"
Mycroft
Sherlock
I sweep past John and look through the kitchen. "She's not been here at all this morning. The kettle is cold, and breakfast wasn't made." I note, looking wildly around the room.
It takes longer than I'd hope to set up a trap. The chances of finding anything are pretty nil around here. I return to the clearing to see a perfectly made up patch of bedding and a proper fire waiting to happen. "Wow. That's"
"You know, Greg, I've seen his eyes when the two of you are in the room together. You really don't have anything to worry about." I sip my tea. "He's completely smitten."
I smack Seb on the backside, and nod toward Jim. "Go get washed up for dinner, you two. John, Sherlock - you, too. Get inside this instant." I scold.
Sherlock
I place one of my hands over his and play with his hair with the other. "We also had a lot less clothes. It was so hard for me to not to pull you closer and have my wicked way with you." I kiss his forehead and take a moment to just breath him in. "Did you use some cleaning product today? You smell divine."
"We didn't see any harm, sir. We were hungry, and she offered..."
Sherlock
Fuuuhhh-- "uh yeah. Ok." I lift myself up a bit and press myself as completely against him as I can. "We'll do this for a while then turn over." It's time to turn over when, not if, I get too turned on. He won't have the same problem I do.
I look at the biscuit, and my stomach growls. "No, I shouldn't, My Lord, it's your last one. You take it." I reply, trying not to sound disappointed. "I know the baker, do I?"
"Yes. No. Maybe. Why does it matter?" Why does it matter to -you-? "It gave me enough liquid courage to return to the Castles to confront you a few days later."
pfft I sent them away. You need to send them away away.
"Uh. No, they don't. We agreed on 48 hours. I aquired you at 4:04pm. That gives them 2 hours and 46 minutes." How dare she try to cheat me? Me??
"She met with an accident the day after you disappeared." I shrug my shoulders and let him assume what he wish about her demise and who took care of him. "Then I give you the lands and anything of worth."
So, no phone number?
Sherlock
(4:19pm) *text to SH* No worries. It's only a date if they put a candle on the table. JW
Sherlock
I'm looking closely at an interesting patch of mushrooms when I hear someone calling my name in the distance. I look around - luckily, the falling snow hasn't completely obscured my footprints, so I manage to get back to the little cave, where John is standing there, holding two rabbits. "Did you call for me? I was just over there" I waved in the direction I came from "I found an interesting growth of Armillaria mellea on a fallen tree in that area."
"There’s someone with him." I shrug and wait for him to process all the information.
Sherlock
"Well, when you say you are going to 'set up a bed' I assume you have appropriate materials to do so." I shrug. I have a feeling my books have missed some important data points.
"I can imagine that was highly entertaining. So you say this man claimed a military background, but it didn't sit right with you. Tell me - what was amiss?"
"Are you not allowed to shop alone? Or talk to people? What the hell is wrong with him?" I start to get angry remembering all the things Sherlock has alluded to about his brother.
"Oh, nothing special. Just a sweetener I like to use." I take his empty stew bowl. "Did you like the stew? There's a bit more..."
"Well, we are having water.  You don't need alcohol right now."
"MissEss HUD Sonnn. Wanna go out? There's a little bar not far from here." I can't drink tea from my laying down position so I sit up and cross my legs beneath me with my back leaning against the sofa.
I look at each of the boys in turn as Sherlock and Jimmy pick at their meals, and John and Sebastian studiously ignore them. I sit back and smile. It's just like having my own happy little family, without Frank there to mess things up.
"Goddammit. You don't get it do you?? I don't want your devotion or whatever else the bloody hell you seem to think I do. I want you to acknowledge me, you utter moron. I want you to be willing to be seen with me. Not dating or any shite like that but no more hiding the fact that you even know me." I get off him and the bed and put my robe on. "I no more want exclusivity than you do. I like my life as it is. I like fucking who I want, dating who I want, not having to get permission for anything. I don't want marriage or any other bs but I am sick and tired of being your dirty little secret.  If you can grope Mr Diplomacy you can at least shake my hand on the street!"
"I don't know. Seems as though I wouldn't be welcomed back with open arms, doesn't it?" His blond hair is brushing softly against my jaw, and I resist the urge to nuzzle into it. "Perhaps this would be a good time for me to acquire some practical knowledge of the world."
"If I didn't know what a dick you are, I would be hitting on you. As it is I have the most beautiful date of anyone else there." I knock his shoulder playfully. "Your date isn't too shabby himself." The living room was clean, and all the supplies put away. "Come on now. Need to get going. Have to walk to my shop to get our ride."
Sherlock
His breath on my neck makes me curl my toes. "What..." My eyes flutter closed and I moan. I never realized how sensitive my neck was. Of course, no one like John has ever taken an interest in it like this, either. "What else?"
"Can I help you? You look as terrified as a kitten at a dog show." My persona, Jamie, grew up on a farm in Midwest America.
"Cute. So not some tabloid? You sure?" It's tantalizing how I can see his mouth and color of his eyes and nothing else. I want to see all of it but not if he's some tabloid nutter fanboy.
"Or Mycroft."
Sherlock
Mycroft
Irene
"A bed of twigs and leaves? That sounds uncomfortable, but admittedly, better than the cold ground."
I nod along knowing any attempt to debate this would simply end in him dismissing it. "Then who has got the absolute worst? Or the best? Which one would you have preferred?"
My eyes travel the curve of her neck line down her back as she leans forward. When she goes back so sitting normally I notice her smock has accidentally unbuttoned a bit to reveal the swell of her breasts. My attention is drawn to the creamy color and barest hint of a medallion hanging from her necklace. "Hmm? Sorry, what?"
Don't just see, observe "Looks like he's holding her to make sure she doesn't fall. She's grabbing his coat to keep from tripping. Her feet are in house slippers. That's all I see. 'Cept the obvious of course. I assumed you didn't need me to point out the wolf tail attached to his jacket." I squint as I look closer. "Hey. That's a Belstaff just like yours. I think you even have that shirt."
Sherlock
"Mycroft, wake up." I lean over and kiss him on the temple. "We need to get on the trail. I'm making some tea, and I think there's a bit of cheese left." If we're out after tonight, I may have to do a bit of hunting.
Mycroft
"So... how are we supposed to eat these rabbits?  With our fingers? They're awfully greasy..."
Sherlock

Mycroft
I smile at his words. "Don't forget the kiss goodbye."
My reaction is instantaneous and very very physically apparent. "Yeah. Yes. That." I stop for a second to calm down. "That sounds good."
Sherlock
"I'll take you to my rooms. Mum, we'll see you at diner." I'll need to arrange to get the rest of his stuff. Oh... "How do you feel ‘bout asking your new employee, who happens to head Security, to get your things for you?" I ask with a smirk.
"No. Ok, maybe yes. But you're also William." Why are we discussing this? It’s obvious he's William.
"Perhaps. Or perhaps you will tire of me and my more annoying habits."
I walk in the front door quietly. "Babe? You awake?" I call out quietly. Most of the lights are out, so I follow the dim lights to the living room where Jim is softly snoring on the sofa. Shaking my head with a grin, I go over and smooth a hand over his shoulder. "Hey, sleepyhead," I kiss him on the cheek.
I leave the bedroom, sans another man’s dressing gown, but return shortly with our clothes. "Least I won't need to call the PR Rep to smooth this over." I give Sherlock a kiss as I hand him his clothes.
I look at him in surprise. "I didn't say who the milk was for..." I say, suspiciously.
"Now, now, there's no cause for shouting, young man," I scold the well-dressed man. "I was just being friendly..."
(3:09pm) *text to JW* Really? You think so? SH
"Me? Go to a bar? At my age? I don't think so, young man," I scold a bit as I return with his cup of tea and set it on the coffee table in front of him. "But if you want to go, you're welcome to. I think I'm going to turn in soon... perhaps a hot bath first."
"Mmm. That feels nice." I start to relax a little. For such strong hands, they are wonderfully soft, too.
"Since my goal was not to hurt you, it seemed that 'goodbye' would be ill-advised." I let my hand linger on his cheek. "I've gone about this all wrong, haven't I? Forgive me..."
"You're not serious. You don't know what jerky is? Dried meat, Mycroft. Best way to preserve it when you travel. Light to carry, nutritious..." I reach into my pack and pull out the bundle of jerky I'd packed away, offering him a small piece. "It may not be fresh steak, but it's better than starving."
"Don't be over-dramatic, John. I did no such thing. I simply made sure that the State of Florida had all the information it needed to convict the man. It isn't my fault that they opted for the lethal injection over life imprisonment." I follow him into the kitchen and sit at the table, watching with interest as he prepares dinner for us.
I smile widely and hold out my hand. "I'm Jamie. You are?"
"Oooookayyyy." I nod my permission for him to take off the ring.
"Nothing. Empty. Neighbors didn't see a thing." I feel a tad guilty about using the warrant card I borrowed from Greg to gain entry into the flat. "Pretty dodgy area. Not the kind of place any one ever sees anything."
"We were lucky I snagged these guys. Gravy is a little harder to snare." I chuckle a bit thinking ‘bout him wondering how one would best catch gravy.
Greg and I share a look of confusion. "Today is the Tenth of April. What's wrong?"
I arch my back and grip his biceps tightly, his change in rhythm sending ripples of pleasure through me, pushing me closer to the edge.
There's a noise coming from the back of the cave. The animal sounds hurt, or worse, pregnant. With nowhere else to go I decide to stay against the wall as close to the entrance as possible and try to wait it out til daylight.
Before I have a chance to offer my knife he has already taken a huge bite of the peach. Beer spills down my chin when the lip of the bottle misses the lip of my mouth.
"Sure, John. Sherlock, be a dear and keep an eye on the stew for me? I don't want it to burn." I follow John out back.
I chuckle quietly. "Of course. How foolish of me." I follow him out of the car. "Do refrain from shooting anyone unless it's urgently required, though." We walk up the road along the hedges until we reach the house. The sun is setting, and it appears the only lights on are downstairs - that might make it more of a challenge to be unobserved. "Where shall we start?"
"But you're good. Good heart. Good soul. Good tea. I'm bad. Bad bad bad. No heart. No soul. No tea." I turn over my empty cup.
"No! That's not what I meant..." I reply quickly. "Even the money wouldn't have mattered to you, if you were truly afraid. And I've seen how some of those 'ladies' behave... you weren't that way. You tried to take care of me, and not just in bed." I let him pull away from me, but reach for his hand. "Remember that time you came to see me, and I was laid up with a black eye and a couple of bruised ribs? I never did tell you how that happened. Stevenson noticed you spending nights with me, and made some smart remarks. It was one hell of a fight, but I came out on the winning side." I grin.
"Hedgehogs are generally solitary creatures. So are you." I shrug. "This party was a way for your mum to get you to meet people... possibly a potential partner?" I ask quietly.
"Hmm. Yet you asked me if I was working. Was it interest or guilt that made you ask? It was obvious you were not there as a friend of the family."
Sherlock
"Busy. Go get them yourself." Brat knows I'm doing dishes which is a bit more important than sitting on a chair waiting for a nice old lady to bring tea and biscuits.
"You could touch yourself other places." I shrug.
I slowly make my way to him and make a show of walking my fingers up his arm to his neck. "I want... I want one thing. One itty bitty thing."
"I'm cold, I'm sore from sitting on the cold hard ground, and I'm wrapped in the arms of a total stranger trying to stave off hypothermia." I huff. "Of course I'm not OK."
"Wait. I'll pack you a lunch while you say goodbye to Jimmy." I have my hand on my hip and a Mom look so he doesn't even think of brooking an argument.
"The moment it was possible I went back to the cave. I hoped that I would find him cold but safe. I feared I would find him dead. What I did find was the remains of a campfire and animal bones. Somehow someone and he survived the blizzard and then left. I looked for him and called out but no answer." I need another dose of brandy. "I've returned a few times but... nothing. Hence why I require you." I need you. "I have no way to pay but I'll do anything. Please, help me find my brother, or find out what happened."
Sherlock
"No. No no no. No talking." I can feel my head hit his throat and shudder when he swallows around it. His nails dig into my hips making me groan in pure pleasure. The thought of wearing his marks for the next few days has me closer than I would normally be right now.
Sherlock
I close my eyes and purr at the touch of his hand, even when he presses into the handprint he left before. It doesn't sting so much now - more of a dull ache. My cock twitches in anticipation
I grumble sleepily. "Stargaze some other time, John. I'm cold again." I burrow deeper into the layers of clothing that was covering us.
(6:10am) *text to Shit Head* Scratch that. I AM boring. JW
Mycroft
"sex!" Ugh "I meant what do you know about sex?" This time it comes out calmly and mature.
I slip the Brandy flask into my hip pack before I load my pack. "Do you believe he was alone? The bones tell me someone cooked a fresh kill. He doesn't know how to trap, skin, or kill food. Bugs maybe, but nothing worth eating."
I pull his head off me and stand up. I unwrap the sash and reach for the paddle I grabbed earlier. "I tried to be nice. I -wanted- to be nice. But you want to be punished so punish you I shall." I tap his feet with my foot. "Up. Up. Up. On the bed. You know how I want you." As he positions himself I grab a cockring and lube out of the nightstand drawer.
"You two should get along beautifully while I'm at work." I strip down and get into the shower. "Try not to take over a small country before I get home, please."
That was just a dream.
I yawn as I didn't realize how tired I was til right now. Maybe it's because I'm quite warm and comfortable. Something about all this makes me feel needed and some how safe.
His hand wrapped around my cock is making me tremble, and when I feel his finger stroking over my arsehole, I shudder, almost whining with pleasure.
"John! Has my brother gotten a license plate number yet?"
Sherlock
The crack of the paddle makes me jump, but I don't move away. "One..." my voice cracks a bit.
"Two days is long enough then I'll be out of your way and you and Harry can be surrounded with all the appropriate and properly-vetted company you can handle." I grab the Phoenix mask from Harry's drunk touchy-feely hands.
I watch his thumb smoothing over the back of my hand, then realize he's stopped talking. "What? Hungry? Yes, definitely. What do you have in mind?" I can't imagine we're going to take off for the nearest pub...
Mycroft
"What else have you tried?"
"All kinds. Cards. Jigsaws. Mostly these ones he played in his mind. His friend, Seb, understood it a lot better than I did.  He was a big fan of yours. Always asking questions about you."
"You really must be close friends... you can't even remember his name." I giggle. "To answer your question, about an hour. He finished off a bowl of stew first, though. Would you like some?"
"Why so happy?" We pull through the gates of the Castle and I escort him inside.
I stroke him a few more times then let it go. Both hands return to his back and I kneed into the muscles there as I work my way down. When I get to his arse I take my time rubbing it and marveling and the perkiness of it. "Michelangelo wouldn't have been able to depict an arse this perfect even in his wildest fantasies." I run my soapy hand between the middle of the cheeks.
"Sorry ‘bout that." I can hear a tremor in his voice that says he's as cold as me. "What was your name again?"
Goddamit Self! I told you to shut up and stay shut up. "Right. Off we go. This way."
I put my hand over my heart and dramatically flop down on the couch. "A bird? A bird he says! Oh my wounded heart." I get up and walk over to put the jacket around his shoulders. "It's a Phoenix. You know the story, yeah?"
"I want you to..." I take a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves. "Take me."
"The trail seems to lead over that hill, but still in the general direction of the river. When we get to the top of the hill, I may be able to get a better vantage point." I take Daisy by the reins and look over at him. "Walk or ride?"
I'm standing at the foot of the bed, staring at him blankly as he approaches. When he's within reach, I wrap my arms around him and pull him close. "Thank you." I whisper in his ear.
The moment his hot cum enters me I pulse out my own release. My body feels boneless and sated. I find myself nodding in to a needed nap.
Sherlock
"I'd prefer wine." Especially if the fish is poorly cooked.
"Yeah. It's good. Thank you." I stretch a bit, feeling loose and relaxed. "Sorry we're such a bother." I grab the bowl to continue eating. "What meat is this? It's good."
Mycroft
"I'm at your service buttercup. What else you need? Maybe I help you find it and you tell me what to do for fun in these parts. Deal?"
"Jawn." Huh, what? "John!"
Mycroft
Sherlock
"No idea what you mean gov." I nod a thanks for the tea then sit at the small table. "So. Enjoy yourself last night? Get to see under the mask, if you know what I mean?"
I glare at Moriarty sharply as I jump up, minimizing the amount of hot tea that spills onto my lap. "You did that on purpose..." I snarl at him. I start to reach across the table for a buttered roll. I am about to fling it at Moriarty's forehead when Mrs. Hudson's shrill voice makes me drop it.
I come back into the camp a couple of hours later, a string of three small fish over my shoulder. I had cleaned them by the river, so they were ready to immediately set by on a stone by the fire to cook. Mycroft had done a good job keeping the fire up, and tending to needed things around camp, too. Once the fish is situated on the fire, I look over to see Mycroft quietly hunched over the journal he brought along.
"You're still going to see him. He'll be at the Castle that you're head of Security at. Is there something you're not telling me?"
After straddling his legs above his knee I pat the red area on his groin left by the smacks. "This is going to hurt so very good." I put my weight down on the hand touching the fresh marks. "Welllll, it's gonna hurt you. I'll be happy and pain free." My smugness is honestly earned because I had the foresight to prep ahead of time.
"What??"
There's something not quite right about what he says. "Artillery, huh. You looking for a job? I know a couple people at the Yard." Criminals get twitchy when NSY gets brought up.
"My pleasure Sir." I grab one for myself and a bag of crisps off the counter.
"She won't ever hurt you. She was actually trying to make me happy. She had this absurd notion that maybe if she apologized you'd come back." I watch his eyes as we talk. No matter how silent he is being his eyes are telling stories. Sadly, I don't know how to read those stories.
Sherlock
"Sherlock, please." I let my fingertips dance along his chest softly.
Sherlock
"Babe. Yes. I believe we had discussed you not referring to me as a child, Gregory. I am only a few scarce years younger than you." Is he trying to hit every bump possible?! Ouch.
"Can you smell it now?" I sniff the air. "It's stronger here than it was by the river. And we're upwind of our own fire, so it's not ours."
Sherlock
Sherlock
"It's not uncommon for guards to travel in groups, John. There's safety in numbers, especially in a forest such as this one." I look at him somewhat numbly.
I take a deep breath and nothing. "Nope. No smell of smoke but our own. We're not the cleanest smelling anyways. Look, why don't I boil some water and we can take a whore's bath and we'll both feel better. Ok?" I tug on his sleeve and try to lead him back to camp.
I nod enthusiastically. "Brilliant idea!" I grab small containers of each type and tuck them into the basket. "I can't be wrong this way!" I smile, pleased with myself.
I stare blankly at the empty champagne glass, and my eyes follow him as he walks away rather quickly. I shrug and set the glass down on a nearby table and head toward the dessert table.
"Brother, one last question... how long have I been missing?"
"Wait." I stand up, carefully, and give her a kiss on the cheek before she retires. "I'm not good but I like that you think I'm not bad."
I nod to cousin Percy, the biggest gossip in the family. He winks as he walks past with his wife. "Father had the good sense to die instead of coming home, you mean." Mum had oft said that our Father's greatest gift to us was dying a war hero. I used to think she said that to hide the pain of his death. Now, I'm not so sure it hasn't become her version of the truth.
(4:12pm) *text to JW* Reason four to tell how clingy you are. SH
Sherlock
"There was a girl I grew up with. Just before I got involved with... Lady Smallwood" I shudder at the memory "She and I were very close. Considering marriage, even. But her father didn't approve of me, and one morning, I woke to find her father had taken her to live with distant relatives, to get her away from my 'bad influence'." I huff, tossing some small sticks into the fire. "Since then, well, there's been no one I wanted to call by those terms."
I nod in acknowledgement of his statement and start walking to a visible clearing nearby.
"You've mentioned puzzles but not very specific." We manage to do a full count without me stepping on any part of his anatomy or my own.
"Wow. Amazing." Looking closer I can see that the couple is Mrs and Mr Smallwood. "How ‘bout them?" I point out a pair in perfectly mirrored scales.
Sherlock
"I managed to sleep on a cave floor... this floor is far better than that." I grin at him. I bundle my coat around me, and lay my head down.
"Now, John." I say seriously, my words interspersed with licks along his cock. "I can only do one thing at a time" *lick* "Do you want me to talk, or..." I take him as far as I can into my mouth, my tongue still working against him as he just touches the back of my throat.
"All the skin that is touching you is quite comfortable." I mumble as his grasp around my ribs tightens. "I'm just trying to get the rest of me warm... my backside is cold."
I wipe my hand over my face as he exits the cab. This could be a very bad idea.
"Is it actually almonds or does it just smelling like almonds? Arsenic is surprisingly easy to make."
"No, really, John... get off me. You're heavy." I give him another shove.
"You. Noticed. Me. You noticed a small change based on humidity in the air. That may be the most romantic thing I've ever heard of."
I wave my hand in the air in a meh way. "I did do my homework, ya know." I start quoting from the dossier that was put together about her.
"I watched him head west. Remember there's going to be at least two, maybe more. You need to stay hidden til the coast is clear." We slowly make our way out of sight from That Woman's cottage. "Before you get all too thankful for her hospitality, you should wonder why she wanted to keep us there." Sometimes he's too naive about people's motives. It's endearing and frustrating in equal parts.
My righteous anger starts to fade. "I've been around him since he was 15, Myc. I've dealt with the panic. I've also been there to help him through his recovery from the attack. Remember that. I've been there." Since the day I found him, bloody, torn up, helpless, I've done my best to get as close to him as he will let me be. "He's been doing so good. I thought maybe being able to hide behind a mask would make it easier."
"Pshaw. The reward don't matter. What matters is he wants you!" I grab the paper and smack him on the head lightly. "I've had reporters all over my shop and house since this was delivered. I snuck out and came here soon as I could."
We need to find this man with Mrs. Hudson. I doubt they got far on foot.
"Suit yourself. Go hungry." I take a good bit out of my meal. "I'll be sure to tell your brother that you died with good and proper manners. He'll be so proud."
No dawdling. Working at top speed.
When he pulls off his shirt, it's like the unveiling of a precious gift. I stroke my hands over his bare flesh, leaving both of us gasping. I turn my attention to the crook of his neck, much as he had with mine, and find he has a similar reaction.
"I've heard of that woman. Rumors say she was banished from the Kingdom for trying to black mail his Highness." Always good to know where a intelligent ally can be found. "I am in her debt for keeping you hale and hearty."
"One of those for me?" I am more relieved that he is here than I thought I would be.
"You don't date because of your family? They can't be worse than mine. What do they do?"
I freeze for a moment. "Hello, your Highness." I bow politely. "Seems you've thrown a popular party." I look around the crowd, partly to distract myself and partly to make sure I know where my brother is. I'm sure he'll recognize me and make a horrible scene if he finds me here.
My hand goes on top his arm. "Thank you. It is an honor you will allow me to come by." I see Gregory and Sherlocks beau both in an attack stance. "Perhaps we should return to our men before they do any damage."
Sherlock
My shock must show on my face. "Wow. Your books actually got something right. Did it tell you how to clean the snow so you can drink it? Or the best ways to stay warm?"
Mycroft
I focus on what he's saying, rather than the sinful ideas the rest of him has put into my head. "I would never laugh at you, John."
"He should be down in a few minutes." I hand Greg two bags of biscuits. "Give one of those to the Royal family, will you?"
"Just so you know, if it's not edible or medicinal it's not important out here." I skin one rabbit and blindly hand it to Sherlock. "You finish that one and I'll work on this one."
"Where should I put my things, John?" I ask quietly, trying to avoid looking at his mum. I can tell by her body language that while she's being supporting of John, she's not sure if she likes me or not.
"Good night, Irene."
"It's Miss, but you may call me Irene." I smile sweetly. "Are you injured? I might be able to lend assistance."
I fumble for the right words. "I will have no heirs to give it to." I say quietly, glancing over at John, who is watching us intently, as though waiting for something to happen. I look back at Mycroft, as recognition flashes across his face. "The only thing I want is to have my brother back."
"Sorry, no. Try to enjoy your time off." I see him furiously rubbing at something in his hand but before I can ask if I can help he has already walked away.
I keep glancing at the clock right along with Martha. "Dear Martha. Martha Martha Martha. They're not gonna show. Even -if- he does he's already laaatee."
I reach over and snatch the flask from his hand, spilling brandy all over. I solemnly upturn the flask and let the remaining brandy pour onto the ground. "You have to stop, Mycroft. You don't need this."
"Why is it always Sussex? Does anyone besides criminals retire here? Be nice to meet some normal people who own property out here." I enjoy the scenery as the driver navigates the road. "Maybe a quaint little B and B after we get Mrs Hudson back."
Irene
(4:01am) *text to SH* I'm Blonde. JW
I'm gasping for breath, a familiar heat curling in my groin. "John, wait... I want..." I shiver as I thrust into our hands.
"Did you really think that? That you were in danger?"
I whistle and flit about the room randomly picking up this and that until he barely relaxes a smidgen. WHACK
Sherlock
I bury my head in his shoulder silently. "I know. I'm sorry about the kettle, by the way. Nerves." I smile against his neck.
"Sherlock and Mummy are gone. The house and property are paid for. Father’s pension is enough to cover the basics. I make money translating and transcribing old texts." My needs are remarkably few. "I spend my nights with you, when you want me, not because I have to." Please don't make me say it is because I want to.
"Wait," if I let him climb he'd probably fall and kill himself, "I'll do it."
"Brandy is a terrible breakfast choice, you know." I comment. I saw the open flask in his hand as I opened my eyes. I sit up and stretch.
"I told you making Valentine's for Mrs Hudson was a bad idea." Seb shakes his head but a slight grin is visible.
"I think we should... " I completely lose my train of thought as he drags his lips up my body. I lean up a bit and finish pulling off my vest with a chuckle.
Irene
(3:01am) *text to phone finder* The cashier. Cute? Really? SH
Sherlock
"SHERLOCK! JAMES! STOP THAT!" I jump up from the table I can't remember the last time I had to raise my voice to anyone, let alone one of my boys. "You are grown men, for God's sake." I roll my eyes.
"Sherlock!! Get back here this instant!" This time I grab his arm and yank him in the direction of the camp.
"My mind’s made up Mum." I don't even need to turn to know that its her who has entered my rooms. There's always been this chill that follows wherever she goes.
Sherlock
"Better than you. What is that on your hands?" I make my way inside and straight to Mycroft. "Mycie! I've brought your mask. Some of my best work if you ask me." I set the box on the corner of his desk near me.
Sherlock
"You've been drowning your guilt, Mycroft. Between that and not eating, you're going to kill yourself before we ever find Sherlock. And that's not on. I won't have it."
Mycroft
I whimper at his words, and try to focus on anything but what he's doing with that talented tongue, to keep this from ending all too quickly. With one hand, I run my fingers through his blond hair.
"Don't do that!" I hiss at him. "He's already insufferable - you'll just make him worse." I shrug. "I haven't been out of the house except for running to the market once a week while he's asleep in the afternoon, and then, I don't have time for the local gossip and chatter." I consider for a moment. "You know, if I work all night, I might be able to finish what I need to get done by tomorrow afternoon. Any chance you can make one more mask? I'm sure I can find a way to pay you for it..."
I roll my eyes. "It's a term of endearment, Mycroft. Has nothing to do with your age. What term of endearment would you prefer, then?"  I can't help but notice him wincing with every step the mare takes. "And if you let your hips roll with her gait more, you won't be as uncomfortable."
I flop down on the bed almost asleep before my head touches the pillow. "Shhhh I'm sleeping."
"Agreed!" I escort Myc to the Corvette and we make our way to the Castle. "You really think William won't show up?"
"Oh, gods, John... don't stop..." I gasp.
I drop my fork. "Where did you hear about that? I bet it was Greg, that snitching bastard..." I mumble under my breath. "Yes, I am. Why do you ask?"
"Stop it." I lightly smack Daisy’s nose again. "And you," I smack Gregory, "stop laughing. You're encouraging her."
"It's part of having my wicked way with that wicked mouth. It's part establishing the fact that I will do my best to make you feel good in every way possible." I duck my head and mumble the last reason.
"I prefer the view from down here." I tie the bedding onto Daisy’s back. I am proud of the skills I have acquired over the last few days.
"I need tea. Lots of tea. And clothes. I'll meet you down there." I head back to my room to find a comfortable but desirable outfit. After over thirty minutes and several jumper changes later, I settle for just a comfortable outfit and head down stairs.
"You were lucky, then, to find me when you did. My... mistress... would not have been pleased if I'd strayed from her bed, even if she rarely spent time in it with me."
(3:46am) *text to JW* He is paid to smile. SH
"Last night was nice. Thanks." We had ended up going out to drinks after 'making-up' all the way through dinner time. It was different to be seen in public with him. No, not actually seen with him, but him not being afraid to be seen with me. We both ran into friends and no one said anything. That's what was nice. We'd been seen, together, doing friend stuff, together, and nothing changed.
I take his hands with mine. "And you'll have that sweetheart. Just relax for a moment." We both need a moment to calm down. "Do you want me to tell you what I'm going to do first? I'm sure you understand the basics, but the mechanics can be a bit... mechanical."
Sherlock
I gasp when he takes me into his mouth. With what little analytical thought i can manage, I try to make a mental note - not only does his mouth feel fantastic, it distracts me from any discomfort I might have felt... which I don't. I open my eyes and look down at him.
I make a small bow to Mrs. Hudson. "Oh. Hello. I'm surprised to see you here. My guards were instructed -quite clearly- to keep you in the room I provided for you." I see Jeff didn't even bother to wipe the crumbs off the table and Eric is staring at the ground. What has she done to my guards?
"You do not see the point." Maybe he simply does not want to. "I have already told you that you will not pay me ever again. I thought that was acceptable to you..."
"Wait, Mycroft... We should approach with some caution. I'm not sure who the other man is, but I'm fairly certain he's armed, since they're bringing in a deer." I instruct him to wait with Daisy while I go introduce myself to the pair.
"That's a long time without a warm bed to sleep in." I take a seat beside him, resting a hand on his knee.
Sherlock
Sherlock
"I am almost afraid to ask, but why?" Something starts to wiggle in the pit of my stomach. Fear I've taken advantage of a person who may not be able to have made an informed consent. "Not allowed or don't want to?"
Mycroft
Sherlock
"Yes it is. Helps that you're quite handsome as well." I push him against Daisy but she doesn't take kindly to being used like that and takes a large step to the side. We would've fallen if it wasn't for Gregory’s quick reflexes.
(5:16am) *text to SH* What about me is interesting? JW
Sherlock
Before I can decide if it's safe Sherlock appears in the clearing. "Dammit. I told you to stay put!"
"Onward faithful steed." I chuckle at my own joke. "I've always wanted to say that." His hold of my legs keeps my foot from bouncing, for which I'm grateful, but does not keep the rest of my body in place, which is torture.
The second finger brings a whimper from my lips, and my knees wobble. My hips rock, my cock pushing to the back of his throat alternating with my arse pushing back on his fingers. His fingers press against my prostate, and my brain completely whites out with the sensation. "Oh, my God, John..." I gasp. "That... that's good." I did tell him I'd try to tell him what I liked.
Find a connection between Moran and Moriarty
Sherlock
May the Gods forgive me. "Mummy had been most insistent that Sherlock leave the manor. She told me either I could remove him myself or she would. One night, after I had medicated his cocoa, I took him to a cave in the forest." I go over to the small liquor cabinet and pour myself some Brandy. "I left him whiskey, a knife, and a note explaining my reasons." At this point I can no longer look at him. "Before I was even back to the house I was disgusted with my actions and tried to go back but the blizzard had set it."
Mycroft
"What?? No." I look at Sherlock with shock. "I don't trust him or his guard."
Having watched his technique closely, I find I am able to almost perfectly duplicate it with the sharper knife and have cleaned and dressed the rabbit in no time flat. I beam with pride.
Sherlock
"Yes, you. You are brilliant, kind, gentle... all the things I wish others could see in me." I reach over and put my hand over his. "And if paying you is the only way I can have that, then I'll gladly do it."
He clenches tightly then relaxes even further as I'd hoped. I add a third finger while I take his dick all the way in my mouth as possible.
I push his shoulders down as I get on top of him. "Have I lied to you yet? I'm going to fuck you so hard. I'll make you feel so good you'll be able to think of nothing but me." I run my thumb along his bottom lip. "I want to hear my name come out of those pretty lips of yours."
"Wait a minute... when did that guard say Mummy died?"
"Good night, John." I start to relax against him, savouring the warmth. In a different time and place, this could have been a really fantastic night. Now I'm just hoping to wake up with all my fingers and toes in the morning.
I nod quietly. "I think I have some leather cord in my pack - I will string it around my neck in the morning, if that suits." Working with my hands as I do, wearing a ring on my finger all the time isn't terribly practical. "Now go to sleep, love." I kiss the top of his head. "We need to go get your brother home tomorrow."
Mycroft
"Well. He was always doing puzzles and asking riddles and such. He was too smart if you ask me." And too gay.
Something about this woman is worrying at me, like a pebble in my boot that won't come out.
"Charles? How does kaylay make Charles? Why Charles instead of Wolfe? I think you might be wrong this time."
I walk back with an armful of reasonably-sized branches. "There's also wine, and some jerky." I smile, as I kneel to get the fire going.
I put my hand on the base near his balls and squeeze mildly. "I want to make you cum just like this. I want you to fill up my mouth and ruin me for anyone else too." I return to his cock and take it into my mouth. I wrap my lips around the head and suck as I put my tongue against the vain that's pulsing on the underside.
"Hmm." It hurts my heart with how little love he's had that attempted murder is so easily forgivable. "Let's go in love." I feel eyes on us and want to get him out of danger as soon as possible.
Sherlock
I sit up the rest of the way. "Damn" I breathed. I stretched uncomfortably and shivered.
"I? You! Me! What?!" Actually surprised by this old lady's audacity to question my skills, I end up flopping down into the chair vacated by the soon to be janitor at Sherrinford. "Who. Are. You??"
"Here love, let me help." I pull him to standing and divest him of tunic and myself if pants. I sit on the bed and lean back on my elbows. My dick is rigid and there's a drop if precum on the head. "Come here."
"Have you figured out who it might be?" According to Mycroft there was a riot of at least fifty exact copies on Mrs. Hudson with the Sherlock look-alike.
Sherlock
"That's exactly what I was hoping for, Greg. John's getting a bit... frustrated... with the process, I think. The fewer men make it through your preliminary examination, the better." I glance at the bag he's set on the table. "What's that?"
I forward my brother's request to Anthea and ask her to make haste in getting the video to him. She replies within 20 minutes that the video links have been sent as requested.
Because somehow I have been trained to giving it to him even before he commands it. JW
Sherlock
"Oh, I see. So you two are just not marriage-minded, then. That's all right. I've had plenty of men in my life since dear old Frank paid his debt to society. Not so much marriage-minded myself anymore, you know." I wink at him as I get up from the table, taking the tea cups to the sink. "So, you don't think I'm important to Sherlock and John, do you? Care to make a friendly wager on that?"
"I don't care! I don’t deserve to live! I killed my own baby brother! I am nothing more than a whore." I finally get a hold of the flask but it's well and truly empty. "I need to not think sometimes. It's the only other thing that works to shut up my mind."
Climbing out of bed slowly so I don't disturb Locky, I leave the bedroom and quietly shut the door on my way out.
Sherlock
I lift myself off his lap and kneel in front of him. I shimmy out of my pants since I know he prefers me to be naked. Maybe next time I'll ask him to make me undress. I use my hands to wrap around his shaft and lick the precum off his tip. In this position I can't see what his face is doing so I lay down on my stomach to watch him. The cold quickly gets to me and I start to shake but I don’t stop sucking him.
"You mustn't breath a word, Greg. Promise me." Now it's my turn to panic a bit.
I walk alongside him, letting him lead Daisy as we head north. "I'm hoping we find a camp, or even a cottage. There's obviously someone out there. Maybe your brother is with them, or they've at least seen him.
Mycroft
Sherlock
"What should we do my love?" I trace my nails down his chest, past his belly, to the buckle of his belt. I undo it slowly as I move on to teasing his other nipple. "What do you want to do?"
(8:01am) *text to ICE* I forgot to send my number.
Sherlock
I run my hand through my hair nervously. "Yeah, that was a pretty colossal misunderstanding, wasn't it? I don't regret it now, but when I figured it out, I thought for sure I'd insulted you to the point where you'd never consider me anything but a paying client."
"So... what about you?" I take a seat near where he's working on starting a fire. "Anyone from home looking for you?"
Sherlock slumps down in the chair looking more contrite than the situation calls for. Greg hands me the cocoa and I head over to him. "Here love." I sit down so I'm in between Lock and Mycroft. Greg sits across from me. "Look. I don't know what the problem is but it stops now. Got it?" I look at Mycroft who has a bit of a sneer on his face.
"Three weeks. I was back as soon as possible but it appears I was too late." Gregory looks around at the debris. "I am aware I am a terrible person. I must know, do you think my brother may be alive?" I brave myself for whatever the news may be.
Sherlock
'Oh don't blame me for this. I would've been quite happy with some brews down at the pub. But this is what Mum wanted." As I tell him this I begin to think just how stupid I'm being. "If you like parties... Do you like parties?"
"Yeah, almost forgot you know Sherlock. He's good by the way." After a bit of small talk, the conversation got around to our respective jobs. "Actually, now that the Ball’s over and I won't be making any more masks, or anything, for a while... Anyways, I've been looking for a job in PR. I got the diploma for it, might as well get some use out of it." The waiter came buy with fresh drinks for all of us.
"Ta." I quick smile lights up my face as I think of such a big guy on such a small scooter. Upon entering the flat I call out to Sherlock. "Get up, food’s here." His curls are dragging on the ground and his normally beautiful cheekbones are covered in a light scruff that does nothing to hide the pallor of his face.
I agree to his demand and shut up about who we saw and his relations. The room is mostly taken up with a double bed and books. I mostly let him lead matters as he seems to enjoy figuring out what he likes. I do take care of the little things like toeing off my shoes and tugging up on his shirt to untuck it from his trousers.
I stop my eye roll before I get glared at, and turn to return to the kitchen for my own meal. I stop and look at him. "So you're going to the Mask Ball tomorrow?"
I look at him, wide-eyed. "Spouse?"
"Yeah. Well." Pfft. "Whatever."
I raise an eyebrow at his story. "Or did they get -lost- too?"
My jaw drops. "I..." I don't even know how to begin to respond to that. "I think I should leave. I... need some space..." I quietly get up and locate most of my clothes, deciding that looking for my socks and underwear is not a priority at the moment. Shoes in one hand, I open the door to leave, and stop to look at him. "Please accept my deepest apologies, Gregory." I step barefoot onto the street, the landscape lit by the first glimmers of sunrise. I opt to walk the few blocks back to my house, hoping to clear my head.
(7:59am) *text to Brother's phone* Fine. Give me your number in case of problem. MH
The thought of getting up is overwhelming. "Yeah. No. Wait. There's something..."
"Aww, how sweet. You're jealous of John!" I smile over the teacup. "I can understand why, though. That Sherlock is certainly a catch. A very useful boy, too. Did he tell you how we met?"
Mycroft
I think back to all the nights he spent hours edging me. We have very different ideas of waiting too long. He does a twist of his hips and starts really pounding into me. I can feel another cum coming on. Oh fuck. So good. I'm so overstimulated but the pleasure in the pain is delicious.
I put my hands in his hair and tug. "What about the rest of me?" I unbuckle my belt and kick off my shoes but leave the rest for him to do.
I look at him confused. "Jim? From last Christmas? No. He was a bit weird for me. Something was just off about him." Didn't help that his boyfriend didn't like me much.
Sherlock
"I was 13 years old and knew in that moment I would never be attracted to a woman. You were the Adonis in every book I had ever read. And, yes, you were scrawny." I blush as I tell him of my crush. "Sherlock even said so when he would tease me and ask about my beau."
"John, wait!" I grab his arm roughly. "You can't do that. She's likely to just poison us if she finds out that we know she's drugged us." I say in a rough whisper. "We need to wait until dark, then sneak away... find that guard."
the thought of a vial marked -for sex-with John- in Sherlocks neat script makes me laugh and the tension drain from me.
Sherlock
"Get back here, John." He turns to face me. "Do you have a better way to get him to come here? He may be in that crowd. I need your help, if you want to find him."
Sherlock
I consider a moment. "Mycroft won't be back for hours, yes?" John nods, slightly confused. "Then we will use the shower in his private bath. It's large enough for us both."
