“Like I said I’m crashing at a friend’s, he helped me get everything packed up yesterday.” Sam gives Charlie a confused look and she shrugs.
“I’ll have that out to you in just a moment.” Sam says and he turns to ask Charlie if she’ll make it but she has also disappeared. He makes the disgusting drink and hands it off to the guy, who gives him a quiet ‘thanks’ and then leaves.
Cas just rolls his eyes and reaches for the door knob and then suddenly the door swings open. Mary grins at them from behind it.
“What?” He didn’t know did he?
He looked back up at the mall santa sitting on the overstuffed chair next to a large christmas tree. Cas smiled in approval. Even from this distance, he could see that this guy was leagues above the guy that played Santa the previous year. Jack had been so excited last year that he could not sit still long enough for a picture and Santa hadn’t had the patience to deal with him. He wasn’t rude or anything but he didn’t seem at all interested in conversing with the child. Before Jack even really had a chance to tell Santa what he wanted, the man was handing him a candy cane and passing him off to an elf to be returned to his parents. Luckily for Castiel the three year old was easily distracted by the candy. Jack might not be distracted as easily this year so Cas was glad it was a different Santa.
“Thanks man. He’ll be all right. Hey we’re sorta throwing him a welcome home slash get well soon party on Tuesday.  Really it’s just gonna be dinner and chatting for a couple hours at our place nothing too crazy cause he’s still healing but I bet he’d really like to see you again. It’s been a while. Maybe you can talk about your project and see if it jogs any memories? His doctor said any little thing might do it.” Sam looked hopeful.

“Still in the hospital, but he insisted I come tonight. Said he was sick of seeing my face.” Cas’ heart immediately sped up, why is Dean in the hospital?
Dean finds himself taking a seat next to Castiel while Charlie explains how things are going to go.
“Yeah sure.” Cas says and tips his popcorn tword Dean. Because he knows Dean wanted popcorn but couldn’t justify the cost and Cas always buys one because: how can you not buy popcorn at the movie theater?
“Don’t bother Sam, he’s pretty useless in the mornings. Usually takes a couple cups of coffee before he’s ready to be civil.”
“It’s supposed to be secret isn’t it?”
Cas goes to his room to get his phone while his brother talks to his girlfriend. His screen lights up with three missed calls and eight texts. He scans the ones from his family briefly, they’re all variations of “where are you” and “call me” and the voicemail from his dad is pretty much the same. Then he sees a text from Dean. It’s just a stupid meme about your crush liking you back but it makes Cas laugh and then he starts to cry. He scrolls through his contacts to find Dean’s name, barely able to see the screen through his tears, and hits the call icon. Dean answers on the third ring.
“Yeah, He was out for a couple days. It was touch and go and the doctors were worried about the extent of the head injury. His ribs will heal and his shoulder is in a brace. They have him hooked up to morphine so he’s not in much pain but he’s also suffering from retrograde amnesia. He’s lost the last couple years. Still thinks he’s in college, had to convince him he’d finished his masters in architecture last spring.”
“Did I fall asleep?” Dean blinks at the light pouring in from the hallway.
“Why wouldn’t I stay with him? I’m not gonna let him celebrate Christmas alone Sam.” Dean immediately goes on the defensive.
Patience runs out of patience and instead of trying to get Dean to finish opening the present he’s holding she grabs the 11th present and tears it open. It’s a bottle of strawberry flavored lube. Dean looks at it and suddenly forgets the package in his hands and Clair snatches it away while he’s distracted. It’s a silk blindfold that says ‘fuck me’ and she blushes when she starts to connect the gifts.
“Hey Dean I can’t get the entrance to the garage open. I think it might be frozen shut. Will you come out and help?”
“Well apparently my brain has a lot of material to draw from. Even if I don’t remember it when I’m conscious.” His words seem to dampen the moment for both of them.
Charlie looks up at Benny with a grimace that he tries not to find offensive. He knows she doesn’t swing his way but he’s not some disease ridden scoundrel as her face seems to suggest.
--------------
“You like me?”
“Cas is just my friend” he reetirates. “And I think you made him feel very uncomfortable. He doesn’t like me like that.” It hurts to say it but he knows it's the truth.
“You never told me you were seeing someone. What’s his name? How did you meet?”
“Is this a record player?” Jack holds up the box and Sam nods.
“Thank you Mrs. Winchester. I didn’t realize how much I needed that hug.” He says with a hoarse voice.
“Kid’s a natural in the kitchen” Dean beams with pride.
“What?”
“I wanna go play outside” he whines a few seconds later when he sees that Dean isn’t about to give in.
“You know what guys. I feel weird being the only one opening gifts. Why don’t I leave the rest of these for tomorrow and we call it a night.”
Gently he pulls it free and holds it up to examine it. Light catches the metal charm and Cas remembers the day Dean gave it to him. He'd proudly held it out to Cas while simultaneously holding up his other wrist to showcase the matching bracelets. Cas remembers teasing Dean about the sappy words written on the charm but despite that he wore it every day. He only took it off after Dean stopped returning his calls and he thought they'd broken up and before he learned of Dean’s accident.
“We can’t frost them while they’re warm the frosting will melt.” Dean says it with the authority of someone who’d learned that lesson first hand.
“What song?”
“You forgot, didn't you?” Sam sounds annoyed. “I reminded you this morning Dean.”
Sam walks over to the record player in the corner of the room and gives it a cursory once over. It looks antique and he notices some symbols carved into the wood.
“Oh, that might be fun. Did you have any place in mind?” Cas asks Sam.
Dean walks into the decked out lobby of their office building with a neatly wrapped box tucked under his arm. Charlie rushes over to him and gives him a slip of paper with a number on it for the game.
“Because he’s a big guy with most of his face covered in hair and he wears a lot of red.” Dean says as if it should be obvious why any child would be afraid of Santa.
“Just hold me, please.” Cas sniffles.
“Are we excited to see what Santa brought?” Cas asks in hopes of dispelling the tension.
“Is that so?” He asks and then catches Dean’s eye.
“Hi mom” he waves.
Jack follows his instructions but he’s not quite sure how to tell if they’re thick enough. When he asks Dean if he should get a ruler and measure the thickness Dean laughs and says “Just eyeball it kid” He holds up his hand to show him an estimate of how thick they should be and Jack isn’t sure what that has to do with eyeballs but he looks at the flat dough and thinks it looks close enough. Dean presses the cookie cutters into the dough and then places the cookies on the baking sheet. Once it’s full he sets a timer for eight minutes and puts it in the oven.
“Oh they have, have they?” Dean says at the same time. Jessica nods solemnly. “Well, hate to burst your bubble dude, but I’m already seeing someone.”
“Please, it makes my heart ache to see you so sad and alone all the time. Whoever she is, she's a fool to let a great guy like you go.”
“Hey kid, didn’t expect to see you here.” Dean takes his coffee and sits across from Jack. “Thought you were busy being God and all.” he waves his hand vaguely in Jack’s direction.
“Yeah” Dean nods and scratches the back of his neck.
“It’s just you’re really good friends and you normally, well before your accident anyways, you would go, well I don’t know where you went but Tuesday's used to always be dedicated to Cas. You’d always do something with him and now you haven’t spoken to him in weeks and I guess I was just curious about when we’d see him again.” Sam babbles to cover up what he really wanted to say.
Mary wipes at her eyes and then looks down the hall where the two young men disappeared.
“Did your date stand you up?” Gabe’s words made Cas look up in shock.
“Nothing. Forget I said anything.” Sam quickly backtracked at his brother’s tone. “It’s been a long day I think I’m gonna get some sleep. Night Dean.” Sam almost missed the look of concern mingled with relief on his brother’s face when he let the subject drop.
Dinner starts off a little awkward as the two men dish up their plates. Dean is mentally freaking out over what to say to Cas while he dishes up. He can’t help but reflect on how much this feels like an awkward first date. Or is it a second date? They did have that whole movie date/not date thing the other day. But does it really count as a date if the other party isn’t aware of it? Dean spends a stupid amount of time looking down at his plate trying to get up the courage to start a conversation. He glances up briefly through his lashes and sees Cas’ eyes shift off to the side as if he’s embarrassed at being caught staring. Dean clears his throat.
“Good bye.” he says sarcastically before putting the phone back in his pocket.
“You’re dating?” Cas nods “Since when?”
“Dean where did you sleep last night?” Sam asks.
Jo pulled out her phone to show everyone but Sam grabbed it before she had the chance.
That comment seems to hit a little too close to home for Michael and before anyone can step in Michael’s fist connects with Cas’ face and knocks him on his ass. Dean sees red and immediately puts himself between Michael and Cas. He’s torn between checking on Cas and beating Michael to a pulp but before he can do anything Gabriel steps in and drags Michael out of the room. Dean pulls Cas to his feet and starts assessing the damage to his face.
“No, Cas is a dude. Like I said he’s just a friend from school. We had some classes together.”
Sam gimmys the window open quietly and hauls himself through. It’s a tight squeeze but he manages ok. Dean struggles a little bit more, he’s not as tall as Sam and his forty year old bones aren’t what they used to be. He grunts when he pulls himself through and then loses his grip and nearly crashes down to the floor face first. Sam’s lightning fast reflexes stop him from face planting. Dean regrets making fun of his brother for all the time he spends running and eating rabbit food, because it’s apparently helped him stay in shape enough for their job. Not that he’ll ever admit that outloud.
“It’s on!” Sam calls and hurls another two snowballs in quick succession. Cas still hasn’t moved.
“Hi, I’m Dean Winchester. I’ve heard a lot of great things about your work and I can’t wait to work with you.”
Cas backs Dean up to the counter and licks his way into his mouth and Dean’s hand finds its way under Cas’ shirt. His fingers graze the taught lines of Cas’ abdomen leaving fire in their wake. Cas shivers and works his mouth down the side of Dean’s neck, sucking a mark into the skin just below his ear.
“I love you.”
“No” Cas shakes his head.
“Cas’ mom had a heart attack. I really don’t want to leave him alone right now.”
“Oh like you never dote on the boys when they come home to visit.” She chides him.
“Well hello Mary, are you having a fun day my dear?” Santa asks her.
“But where is Cas gonna sleep?” Dean asks perplexed. His mother just gives him an incredulous look.
“Wow, that sucks. I mean it’s a little crazy, like it’s the plot for a cheesy chick flick, maybe you should sell the idea to lifetime or something.” he jokes “What are you going to do?”
“No” She pushes her plate away and folds her arms.
“I had to work.” Sam defends himself.
“Sounds good to me.” Dean takes another sip of his coffee and turns when he hears Cas’ morning zombie shuffle coming into the kitchen.
“You’re drunk.” Cas realized out loud. “Don’t touch anything I’m coming home.” Sober Gabe was destructive enough; Drunk Gabe was like a damn hurricane in the middle of an earthquake.
“With guests in the house?” Eileen feigns a scandalized look.
“Yeah it will be, it’s super sharp and it has this part that attaches to your belt so I can carry it with me wherever I go.” Dean gets more excited as he talks about his gift and it warms Bobby’s heart.
“Can I have your number?” Dean blurted out. “I mean just incase I remember something . . . about you.” Dean cringed at the awkwardness. “To check accuracy.” He finished lamely.
“Do you get to color and play trains there or do you have to read lots and lots of papers like daddy?” Jack asks him and Dean chuckles.
“Sam?” Dean looks at his brother for assistance. Sam just rolls his eyes and launches into an explanation of the holiday and it’s history. By the time he’s done Dean and Cas have the lights on and are sorting through the shopping bags full of ornaments that’ Cas bought. Dean hands Jack a tiny ceramic reindeer with a red nose and tells him to hang it on the tree. The four of them work together until the tree is fully adorned with brightly colored baubles and figurines.
“We should talk to him.” John sighs.
“Do you think they even noticed us leaving?” She asks him through clenched teeth and before he can answer the other three men burst through the garage door.
“Yes” Cas gasps. “Need you, need to be close to you.”
“Mother” Gabe finally looks at Cas when he says it and tears start to stream down his face. “She’s gone Cas.” His voice breaks on the last word.
“Pick up, pick up, pick up.” She chants quietly and watches as Novak gets closer and closer to the front of the line.
Sam hesitates at Eileen's car, not quite ready to say goodbye.
Things are going well until Mary pulls out the pie she’d had in the oven. The warm smell of apple pie floods the room and Cas feels the prick of tears. The smell of pie usually reminds him of baking apple pie with his grandmother, but today the smell reminds him of the one time his mother tried to bake a pie after his grandmother had died. She was not a good baker and the pie was burned on the outside and somehow cold in the middle. She sat on their kitchen floor, covered in flour and sobbed. Cas was the only one home at the time and he ran into the kitchen at the sound of the fire alarm going off. It was the first and only time he’d ever seen his mother cry. She was always so put together and she rarely showed intense emotions. He pulled the pie from the oven and then fanned the smoke away from the alarm until it stopped beeping. Then he crouched down next to his mother and gently patted her shoulder. She mumbled something about not knowing anyone was home and how she missed her mother. Cas sat with her for a few minutes and then once she’d calmed down he helped clean up the mess and then made a new apple pie. They never spoke about it after then but it was the only time he ever felt like he understood his mother. The only time they’d ever really connected.
“Well, he did say something about raising bees back in Philadelphia and how he misses it.” She shrugs “I don’t really know what he would like for a gift. Sorry.”
“And that stupid song kept playing from her phone. I couldn’t get it to turn off.” Bradford continues on despite Sam’s words.
“I’m not leaving you alone right now Cas.” Dean sits up too, he’s completely forgotten that he’s on the phone with his brother.
“Oh hey Cas. I didn’t know you knew Garth and Bess.” Sam was smiling as he took a seat next to Cas, followed by the two people in question.
“I’m fine, put the tree back in the base and hold it still while I screw it in.” He grumbles. Cas rolls his eyes but complies with the older Winchester’s orders. He doesn’t understand the point of cutting down a perfectly good tree just to dress it up and watch it die slowly, but the wistful look in Dean’s eyes when they drove past the tree farm the day before almost broke his heart. So, if he was the first person on the lot when they opened the next day and he spent two hours examining every tree until he found a perfect one to surprise his favorite humans with, well it was nobody’s business but his own.
Dean barely glances his way when he pokes his head into the ‘Dean Cave’ to say goodbye. Jack and Cas both wave him away distractedly. They're in the middle of a Lord of the Rings marathon and are too engrossed in the films to pay Sam any mind.
“Yeah but you might have just said that to be polite.” Dean scratches the back of his neck nervously.
Cas pulls the ribbon off and the lid flies open as a small bundle of fur pops out. It’s a puppy. A tiny, fluffy little dog with floppy ears and it yips at Cas excitedly. He scoops it out of the box and cuddles it close.
Cas stares at the floor with flaming cheeks and wishes for a black hole to open up at his feet. Dean’s thoughts are quickly making their way to that same track. It’s not that he’s embarrassed about his family thinking he’s into guys, because he is, it's that they’ve somehow managed to zero in on his attraction to Cas while simultaneously missing the fact that Cas is not into him.
“Are we gonna put an angel on the top?” Cas and Jack have twin looks of confusion at Dean’s question.
Gabe looks at his glass as if it knows the answer and then his focus shifts to Dean. “Hey Dean-o!” He waves energetically, spilling more of his drink. “This is great. I’m drunk, Michael is furious, Anna is MIA, Lucifer is probably getting high, dad’s helpless and you brought your boyfriend to meet the family at mom’s will reading.” He slaps Cas on the shoulder and giggles before downing the rest of his drink. “You can’t make this shit up man, I should film it.”
“Told you” Cas teases him and Dean stares back and forth between him and Charlie’s retreating figure.
As the silence stretches on Dean panics. Maybe he’d read the situation wrong the guy probably had a date. Of course he had a date, she probably had to freshen up or whatever it is girls do, and sent him in to find their seats. No way this gorgeous guy would be going to a movie alone.
“Yep him and his brother Gabe rented out their spare room to me for a year. How do you know Cas?”
“Well Sam and Charlie never shut up about you.” She gives Sam a mischievous smile. “They’ve been trying to get you down here to meet a certain, tall, and handsome, customer.” Sam stares at her, mouth agape.
“No you didn’t,” Sam argues.
“I don’t even know what that song is. But apparently you do if you could recognize it from someone humming.” Dean tries to force the attention away from himself.
The pizza shows up not long after that and they all sit in stony silence, picking at their food and glaring across the table at each other until eventually Chuck decides to put them all out of their misery. He gives up the pretence of a nice family dinner and immediately goes into the funeral plans that Mrs. Novak had planned out in her will.
“Did I just hear it was time to eat?” He sniffs at the air and pats his belly. Sam and Cas roll their eyes but give him fond smiles.
Anna picks up Jack from Cas’ office a little after one thirty and watches him for the rest of the afternoon and the rest of the week follows the same pattern. Jack is a good kid and he sits quietly in Cas’ office and colors or plays with his trains while Cas works. His boss was hesitant about the boy being there the first couple days but when he sees that it’s not impeding Cas’ ability to work he allows it.
“Oh, cool.” Dean tried not to sound too disappointed, but he’d hoped he and Cas were closer friends. From what Cas said it sounded like they were just slightly above acquaintances.
“That’s ok Krissy. We’ll figure something else out” he assures her. “Feel better soon.” He groans and gets out of the car. He knows it’s not her fault but he’s still frustrated that it's such short notice.
When Sam finally finds Charlie twenty minutes later she’s on the phone with his brother and she’s giving periodic sighs of understanding and the occasional ‘No way!’ or ‘He did what?’ When she sees Sam she switches the phone to speaker phone.
“What light show?”
“No, I said his lease was up and he’d be staying with me until my lease was up and then we’d get a new place.” Dean corrects.
“Oh, yeah . . .” Dean rubs the back of his neck self-consciously.
Dean pushes against Cas’ clothed crotch and shudders at the sensation. He’s still fighting with himself silently. He doesn’t want to take advantage of Cas in his vulnerable state but he doesn’t want to turn Cas down and make him think he doesn’t want this too. Things are still so new between them and not new at the same time.
“Yeah, uh… Listen, I wasn’t following you. I recognized you at the coffee shop that first time and I knew you didn't recognize me so I didn’t say anything. I honestly never thought I’d run into you again after that. But then you were there the next day and the next day and by that point it felt too awkward, ya know?” Dean rambles and Cas has to admit, he understands what the guy means.
“That was quite the comeback.” Sam yells after him. “Dinner will be at six on friday. Wear something nice.” He adds before he hears his brother’s door slam shut.
“This is nice.” She sighs and momentarily rests her head against his shoulder as they glide across the ice. Sam just nods and thinks about how he could stay in this moment forever.
“Oh that reminds me, does Cas have any food allergies or dietary restrictions?”
Kali: Little brother is pissed!!! What did you do?
Cas’ heart shattered at the news. Here he was this whole week cursing Dean and being angry with the man when he was in the hospital. And then the knowledge that Dean wouldn’t remember him, or anything they’d been through over the last year, hit him hard. His shattered heart felt like it had been set on fire and then stomped on.
“So vic one listens to Blue Christmas and turns blue, vic two listens to a song about giving someone your heart and has the sudden urge to, literally, give her heart to someone?”
There’s a rustling sound and a yip before Dean answers him. “Give me a minute” he sounds out of breath. Cas glances toward the kitchen door wondering what his boyfriend could possibly be doing in there.
“Heya, Sammy.” Dean saunters up to the cash register, and winks at Jessica. Sam rolls his eyes.
At that moment Charlie comes out from the back room and spots Novak behind the woman and then Jessica calls Dean’s name for his order and her head whips around to see him standing on the other side of the counter. Her head swivels between Sam, Dean and Novak and she squeals. Like actually squeals in delight and runs over to Sam.
“What are we doing?” Sam asks as he watches Dean flatten the box and then put it inside one of the garbage bags.
“We didn’t talk about it.” He sees Gabe’s scowl and quickly tries to explain Dean’s behavior before his brother can say anything about it. He’s already heard Gabes opinion on the ‘girl’ who stood him up and he doesn’t want his brother thinking nasty things, however inadvertently, about Dean.
“The human body is capable of a lot more than we know. Sometimes things like this just can’t be explained.” Sam tries to reassure him but it falls on deaf ears.
“Why?” He drummed his fingers on the kitchen counter trying not to think of the time Dean had pinned him up against it and tried to sucked his brain out through his dick.
“You’re right honey. We don’t need to talk about this now.” Mary agrees with him and then smiles “So, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.”
“Then you find someone else.” Gabe shrugs and then continues before Cas’ glare burns a hole through his forehead. “Look, I know it’s scary and I know you’re not much of a risk taker. But that’s what love is. It’s scary and hard and sometimes you just have to jump in with both feet and hope you don’t drown.”
“Who wants pie!” Charlie class as she enters the room holding her masterpiece aloft. Dean and Castiel’s heads whip up in unison at her words and they both start walking toward her with determination.
“I wish. I think it’ll still be a couple years before I can leave for longer than a day without them burning the place down. They’re great but nobody else really knows how to do the books or fill out parts requests. I’m training Benny and Jo right now so hopefully someday I can leave one of them in charge while I go on vacation.”
“Because Cas is asleep.”
“Calm down Red.”
“I hadn’t thought of who would have gotten my name.” Castiel looks a little worried when he says it.
“Cas buddy, why did you get these? Did someone” Dean sends a pointed glance at his brother “put you up to this?”
“Uh, that’s… we don’t have to…” he looks pleadingly at the other guests and then back at Charlie “I don’t think it would be right to make Charlie kiss a guy just for the sake of some stupid holiday tradition.” Benny looks pleased with his sound argument but the drunk party guests aren't having it. They’re chanting ‘kiss kiss kiss kiss’ and if Charlie ever figures out who started it she’ll skin them alive.
“Ready as I’ll ever be. Thanks again for letting me tag along.”
“Oh, he tried to give me some bulshit excuse about studying when I invited him but after I, subtly, hinted that Dean would also be here, he changed his tune pretty quickly.”
He takes another long sip of hot coffee, bracing himself before he turns around. He knows what he’s gonna see and he knows it will hurt. They’ll be sitting at the table, sharing a ridiculously domestic morning with coffee and light conversation. They’ll be gazing across at each other with shy, private smiles and entwined fingers. And then they’ll notice him staring and they’ll feel bad, they’ll pull away from each other and invite him to sit with them. The conversation will be forced and awkward and he’ll bow out with some lame excuse and spend the next couple hours holed up in his room or driving around aimlessly until he doesn’t feel like his chest has been ripped open and his insides are spilling out.
“Just mix it around until it's smooth.” He hands  the mixer over to Jack and returns to his own task. He pours some vanilla and some almond extract into the bowl with the egg and then sets it aside. After Jack’s mixture is smooth Dean tells him to turn off the mixer and add in a cup and a half of sugar. Then he has the kid mix it again until it’s light and fluffy.
“Is that what people do for Christmas, make cookies?” Jack picks up a cookie cutter shaped like a tree and examines it.
“Oh, I can’t wait to see our little one dressed like a reindeer.” Eileen sighs.
“No!” Dean says loud enough to startle them both. Cas looks up at him then and sees the hurt and confused look on his face.
“How’s your hunt going?” He asks, just realizing that Dean probably called for a reason.
“You couldn’t even wait until after the funeral. You just had to come and rub your deviant lifestyle in all our faces.” Michael gets right in Cas’ face. “You disgust me.” He shoves Cas.
“Sam, I got a new race car. Do you wanna play?” Jack jumped off of Sam’s lap before he could answer and ran into the other room to retrieve the toy. He backs into the room a moment later, towing a box full of cars and track pieces.
“Yeah, they do. We could see Santa, then grab dinner and check out the light show.” Sam suggests and Cas agrees. They chat for a while and then Sam leaves to pick up Eileen and Mary from the airport. They’d gone to visit some of Eileen's relatives in Milwaukee and Sam had to stay behind when one of his clients got arrested for trespassing. His court date was set the following week.
Cas hesitates when he gets to the door and Dean, not paying attention, narrowly misses running into his back.
“I didn’t really have anything planned. My parents are both gone and my only living relative is a great aunt that lives in a nursing home. I might stop and see her for a bit but she probably won’t remember who I am so… I’ll probably just stay home and enjoy the time off work.” She shrugs.
“Well that’s good to know but uh, Cas is just a friend.”
“And knowing what name everyone drew isn’t?” They stare at each other for a long moment waiting to see who will break first. It’s Charlie.
“Did a bag of flour explode in here?” He asks and Dean laughs before he realises that Cas was being serious. He genuinely thought that something had exploded.
“So you wouldn’t object if I did this?” Dean leans in and presses his lips against Cas’.
“It’s the park by daddy’s work.” Jack informs him and the man smiles. Cas hadn’t been able to make out what the picture was supposed to be but now that he knew it was the park he could see that the darker blobs of green and brown were trees.
“I heard about this light show a couple towns over and I thought it might be fun.” Cas said hesitantly, suddenly hyper aware of the fact that Jack wasn’t a normal toddler and would probably not be interested in a light show
“That looks like a good place to start.” They head inside the hospital and ask for directions to the security office. After another flash of their badges the head security guard lets them into the surveillance room and they play back the tapes for the parking garage and they see the guy run past a few cameras, he keeps looking behind him but the cameras don’t show what he’s running from and then suddenly he’s on the ground being stopped to a pult by something invisible.
“Not a chance Winchester.” He knows she won’t budge on that but he still asks her every time he sees her.
“How are you honey?” Mary gives up arguing with her husband and focuses on her youngest.
“That’s good.” He says and proceeds to lick the beater clean.
“I actually took the time to talk to him.” Dean feels a little abashed when she says that.
“We missed you too kid, and you can visit any time you want. This is still your home and we’re still your family.” Dean tells him and he really means it. He was angry with Jack and it took him a long time to forgive him but Jack was still his kid. No matter what, that didn’t change.
“No, of course not. But Eileen and I are a couple.” Sam waves a dismissive hand and Cas shifts uncomfortably on the other side of the room.
“Probably custom made” he guesses.
“You wanted me to call you.”
“Thanks for this.” Dean rubs Cas’ back and presses a kiss to the top of his head.”I know you wanted to spend our first christmas together, just the two of us.” Cas props his chin up on Dean’s chest so he can look at him.
“I’m not crashing your family dinner.” Cas scoffs.
Once all the children are settled one of Santa’s elves hands him a large picture book and he starts reading the story to the children.
“I promise I won’t read too much into it if that’s what you’re worried about. I know you don’t like me like that.” Dean scuffs the toe of his shoe against the floor and looks anywhere but at Cas. He feels very vulnerable talking about this and he could really use that black hole right about now.
“I’ve waited months for this!” She squeals again and Novak walks right up to the counter and stands in Dean’s personal space. He gives Charlie and Sam a wary look and then turns to Dean.
“Wow, these are really good. Are you a professional artist?” He asks and Jack grins with pride.
They all looked adorable as they waddled onto the stage looking like little snowmen. They sang Frosty the Snowman, slightly off key, and then they all ran off while their teacher tried to get them to walk backstage calmly.
“I got the race track too so we can play car races.” Jack announces and then hands out tiny toy cars to Sam and Eileen. He pulls his new car out of his pocket to show them and they ooh and aah. The little boy beams at the praise and then tells them how to make a race track so they can race their cars.
“M-my what?” He stutters.
“I’ll be in the library with Sam and Eileen.” He announces to the room and then leaves. Dean stubbornly refuses to turn and watch the kid’s exit.
Eileen comes home a few hours later and joins them. Sam signs his newly acquired information to her while Dean and Cas are engrossed in the movie and she raises an eyebrow at him before glancing at them out of the corner of her eye.
“Dean’s a pretty simple man, he likes classic cars, old music, and cowboy boots.” Castiel nods, his mind already running through possible gift ideas.
“Come on’ Dean sighs and he turns off the tv. Sam bounces off the bed excitedly and quickly stuffs his feet in his boots, almost tripping in his haste. Dean grabs a roll of duct tape and a couple trash bags and then helps him into his coat and gloves and then they go outside.
Kali: Thanks Gabe. He’s free 1:20-2:00
“What about you Cas, how are things at the school?” Sam asks.
Sam and Dean carefully shut the door behind them, not wanting to wake up any other members of the family, and then book it to the car.
“Oh, just a package that I had to sign for.” He holds up the package in question and then deposits it on the counter.
“Yes, would you like to buy one?” Jack asks and Cas almost has a heart attack.
“I love you too Dean.” Dean hangs up in time to see Cas emerge from his room in a nice button up and a pair of jeans.
Sam quickly heats up his food and then disappears behind his bedroom door saying something about an essay he hasn’t finished yet. Dean and Cas stand awkwardly in the kitchen not looking at each other. Sam had effectively disrupted the moment they were having earlier and neither of them know how to get it back.
Once everyone was settled in the conversation flowed pretty easily. Dean discovered that Garth knew the handsome stranger, Cas, and they spent a good amount of time chatting about Garth’s coming nuptials. Dean quickly surmised that the blond with Garth was his fiancé.
“So, those Dreams?” Dean wonders quietly, more to himself than Cas.
“Mmhm” he presses his face against Dean’s chest and sighs contentedly.
“Did you tell Santa what you wanted for christmas?”
After their trip to the mall Cas makes dinner, bribes Jack to eat most of it, wrangles him into a bath where they both come out soaked, and tucks him in bed. After five stories that is. Then he calls the number on the slip of paper that’s been burning a hole in his pocket all afternoon.
“That’s so cool buddy.” Dean releases his husband and goes over to get a closer look at the new toy. He finds a button that turns it on and the room is filled with lightsaber sounds.
“Dude, what?” Sam asks.
“This way Jack.” Sam tows him to a store on their left.
“And remember how we talked about the Santa’s at the mall not being the real Santa but helpers that dressed up like Santa to talk to little boys and girls because Santa is so busy getting ready?” He asks and she nods again.
Three hours pass and they’re each allowed to go in and visit with Eileen while they wait. Dean was hesitant when Sam asked him if he wanted to see her. He was expecting blood and gore and lots of screaming but what he saw was a clean room and some machines beeping away while Eileen chewed on some ice chips. He chatted with her for a good half hour, stopping periodically when a contraction hit and she’d have to take slow steady breaths through clenched teeth. Nurses busseled in and out to check on her. When Sam asked what was taking so long the nurse just gave him an indulgent smile and asked if it was their first. At his nod she proceeded to tell him that the first one usually took the longest and it could be a while.
“It’s been a long day.” Dean groans as he sinks into the soft mattress. It’s not as comfortable as their memory foam one but it’s better than a hotel. Cas slips under the covers next to him and curls into his side.
The rest of the week continues in the same fashion of long conversations with Cas at night and then suddenly it's Friday. Dean finds himself angrily buttoning up a blue dress shirt at 5:53 that night. He’d hoped he’d find a way out of this stupid thing but Madison kept bringing it up and she was so damn excited about it. He felt guilty even thinking of trying to get out of it. It’s not until the doorbell rings that Dean realises he never once asked who was invited.
“When will he be able to go home?” Garth asked.
“Hey, Kali.” He pauses. “Yeah he was sleeping. We were just about to call dad.”
He’s a lot less hesitant about his next present and is a little perplexed when it’s just a candle. He pops it open and takes a sniff, it smells like the ocean. He’s not much of a candle guy but it might come in handy on a hunt or in a summoning ritual.
“Yeah, we haven’t seen Cas since our wedding. It will be fun.”
Later that night after Sammy is tucked in and fast asleep Dean gets rid of the candy wrappers and their sled before John gets back. He knows he disobeyed a direct order from his father but he’d do it again in a heartbeat if Sammy asked him to.
Dean paces back and forth across his beroom floor for roughly ten minutes before storming back out. Sam, still on the other side of the door, prepares to be yelled at but is shocked when his older brother storms past him without a glance.
“I know, I know. It’s just. You never told me about going to New York with Cas and I though we told each other everything. Or at least the big things and a trip to New York is a big thing.” Sam looked hurt and Dean felt terrible even though he didn’t intentionally hurt his younger brother. At least he hopes he didn’t intentionally keep this from Sam to hurt him. He didn’t really know why future him, well past him technically, hadn’t told his brother about the trip.
“Miracle” He says decisively.
“Wow” Dean pants.
Dean rolls his eyes and shakes his head. “I’ll tell you later” he whispers and she gets the hint.
Cas beams at her and they spend the rest of dinner talking about the benefits of growing your own produce and other ways to be self safficient. Cas tells her about his dream of one day being able to raid bees and collect his own honey. Mary talks about her family raising chickens and how her mother always had a large vegetable garden in the backyard. They both lament about living in the city and the lack of greenery.
“Ok then it’s a date. Be prepared for long hours of train tracks that span the entire living room and dining room, and a shit ton of trains.” Cas warns him “We take trains very seriously in our house.”
He can’t think of anything to get for Dean so he googles ‘gift ideas’ and there are autofill search options for ‘gift ideas for men’ ‘gift ideas for wife’ ‘gift ideas for mom’ Cas clicks on the first one and sees something that catches his attention. 12 Days Of Christmas Gift Ideas For Him. Cas clicks on the article excitedly. It’s perfect he’s known dean for 12 years so he can get him a gift to make up for each year he’d missed.
“They wouldn’t mind.” Sam says through the phone loud enough for Cas to hear. Dean nods.
“It’s not really our first christmas together. We’ve known each other since we were five and there was that one time when we got snowed in our dorm and we couldn’t go home for the holidays.” Cas points out.
“I don’t know Sam, don’t you think they’re a little young?” Dean asks as he cleans up the remnants of his eight month old twins lunch. Sam just shakes his head and lifts Jack out of the highchair.
“Fuck, Cas.” Dean moans.
They’ve also run into the juice swapper two times at the coffee shop. The second time they see him waiting in line for his coffee, Jack runs over to show him the pictures he’d colored the day before. The man crouches down and examines each picture with interest.
“Don’t mention it. You’re actually doing me a favor. With a new person there my family won’t constantly pester me about my love life.” Dean chuckles and climbs into the car.
After several seconds of shocked silence Cas pulls her into a tight hug, barely able to stifle the grin that’s spreading across his face when he looks at his husband's slack jawed expression.
When Dean looks back to Sam and Charlie they’re both gone and he frantically searches the room for them. He knows, he just knows they’re up to something and he will not get caught with his pants down. Not this time.
“Well last night the helper Santa that was supposed to come to the hospital had to cancel because he got the flu. So Becky asked if I would wear the Santa suit and be the helper.” Cas explains gently.
“Really?”
“Wow, that’s amazing!” Eileen says around a bit of her burger.
“Yeah, I guess it is.” Dean answers a second later “But we ain't exactly normal.”
“Why is he in the hospital?” Garth’s fiancé, Bess, echoed Cas’ thought out loud.
“Mmmhm, I’d marry a man too if he could cook like this.” She sighs.
“Dean!” Mary chides and swats Dean’s arm.
“Rudolph got run over by a reindeer?” Dean guesses and Sam isn’t sure if he really thinks that’s a song or if he’s trying to make a joke.
“Hey Dean, see if Cas can come too. Angel strength might come in handy.”
“Dean--” Cas starts but Dean cuts him off.
They got to the front of the line and an elf crouched down to Jack's level and asked him what his name was and if he was excited to meet Santa. Jack nodded vigorously and started telling the elf about all the toys he wanted for christmas. When it was their turn the elf escorted Jack to the chair and helped him climb up on Santa’s knee. Cas snapped a few pictures and stood off to the side while his son launched into a detailed list of toys he liked. Santa sat with him for several minutes, completely absorbed in what the boy was saying. And when Jack’s monologue didn’t appear to be letting up Santa gently steered the conversation back to what Jack wanted Santa to bring him. Jack looked around until he spotted his dad and then he turned back to Santa and whispered something that Cas couldn't hear. Santa looked at Jack with a soft smile and said something quietly. Jack nodded and looked over at Cas again. Santa followed his gaze and suddenly his eyes were locked on Cas’ then he said something else to Jack who nodded. From his position off to the side he couldn’t hear any of their hushed conversation but he could see a spark of admiration in the other man’s eyes when he’d looked at him.
“What was at the door?” She asks when he comes back in the kitchen. She’d seen the light flashing to indicate someone ringing the doorbell but she ignored it, knowing Sam would answer.
“Have fun Sammy!” Dean throws over his shoulder “Tell Eileen we said hi.”
“You’re an idiot.” Dean cracks a small smile despite himself.
“Seriously?” He arches an eyebrow at her like he’s not sure if it really is company policy or if she’s just saying that to get him to take a name.
“You’re on mute!” Sam says loudly as if speaking louder will fix all of their problems. His dad pokes at the keys some more and the video stops for a few seconds before it comes back. Sam hangs his head.
“Yeah.” Dean says in a slight daze.
“I really don’t like you dating my secretary.” Cas grumbled low enough that Gabe almost didn’t hear him. He chose to ignore the comment in favor of ordering his food. Cas gave his order as well and they both waited patiently for their meal.
“Yeah, my brother is minutes away from destroying my apartment. If I leave now I might be able to minimize the damage.” Cas tries to sound casual.
“Cool!” Jack swings it around even more and narrowly misses wacking his sister.
“Ok so spread the flour on the table before you roll the dough out so it doesn’t stick.” Dean demonstrates by sprinkling a handful of flour across the table. Then he takes some of the dough and works it into a ball. “Now sprinkle more flour on the dough and rub some on the rolling pin to prevent sticking, and roll it out.” He shows Jack how to roll the dough flat. “Don’t roll it too thin or they’ll be crunchy when they bake. About a quarter inch thick is what we're looking for. They’ll be soft and just a little crisp around the edges.”
“Yeah, companies want you to have the experience and the degrees but they don’t want to pay you what you’re worth so they hire people less qualified and tell the graduates they’re “overqualified” or they hire them and underpay them because they’re kids who need jobs and can’t really fight it.”  It’s a topic John’s passionate about. Especially after seeing the struggle Dean went through trying to find a job after graduation. He also blames this backwards system for Dean’s accident. Dean started working construction when he got out of school because he kept getting turned down for jobs he’d applied for, for the sole reason that he was overqualified and they couldn’t afford him. He’d only been working at his current company for a few months when his friend asked for help and Dean had the skills from his experience working construction and he’s just that kind of person. The kind that will help out a friend if they ask. So that’s why he was on that roof and that’s why he got hurt.
“Will you tell Dean dinner is ready?” She asks but before Sam can say anything Dean saunters into the room.
“Do you think . . .” John stops but he doesn’t have to finish for Mary to know what he’s thinking.
“We only have one guest room Dean and Cas is more of a guest than you are. We have a pullout couch in the tv room downstairs. I put clean sheets on it earlier and it’s pretty comfortable. You’ll be fine.” Sam tells him before he can complain about being stuck on the couch. Then the doorbell rings and Sam leaves to answer it. Dean and Cas stare after him with twin looks of confusion.
“Kid down for the cound?” Dean asks when Cas enters the library and joins them.
“No” Dean chuckles as he answers. He’d gotten Becky two years in a row and she’d been a little obsessive. That is, until the day she ran into him and Sam at the grocery store and her attention focused on the younger Winchester. “Though now that she’s set her sights on Sammy it would be a lot easier to pick a gift. Hell I could probably give her one of Sam’s socks and she’d love it.”
“Not really. I woke up and I could hear Christmas music downstairs and I went down to see if breakfast was ready.” The girl informs him. “Dad likes to play christmas music in the mornings while he cooks breakfast.” She said with a wistful smile.
“I wouldn’t put it past them.” Sam stands up and says, “I’ll go see where they are.”
“I woke up at like two in the morning and found him hovering over me and taking pictures of me while I was asleep. So I did what anyone would do if they woke up to a dude looming over them with a camera. I punched him. Then I grabbed the camera to see what he was taking pictures of and found a lot of pictures of me. Mostly of me sleeping but there were a few of me just around the apartment and even one of me on the toilet. I don’t even know how he got that one.”
“Uh . . .” He looked at the expectant faces of Dean’s friends and family, at a loss for words. A loud buzzing sound broke the silence and Cas barely managed to stop the massive sigh of relief when he realized it was his phone vibrating.
“Was it as bad as you thought it was going to be?” Sam teases his brother.
“I’ll stick with water too.” he says as he fills two glasses with ice water.
Santa looks stunned for a moment and then his eyes start to shimmer with unshed tears.
“Awesome!” Jack informs him and then launches in a detailed description of how the lights are timed to the music and the Santa that appears to be flying around them.
“Good job buddy.” he ruffles the boy’s hair and starts filling his plate. Jack makes a face at the grapes but Dean just raises an eyebrow as if daring the child to complain.
“Yeah, it’s all planned out in mother’s will. She was always very efficient and she liked to have things in order. So it’s no surprise she had a plan for after she died but it does make it feel a little rushed.” Cas explains.
“Dean please, I need to be close to you. I need to know that you’re not leaving too.” Cas pulls him closer and Dean lets him. They lay back down and Cas slowly mouths at Dean’s neck.
“Well, having a playdate with a new friend is a helluva lot easier and more likely than a new mommy” Cas chuckles “only if you want to thogut.” He ads quickly.
“Dean?” He looks at him for several seconds before asking “Why are you here?”
“Water will be fine.” Cas feels his eyes sting a little at the endearment.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. We have a bigger problem. Krissy’s sick, will you call and see if Patience can babysit tonight?”
“I love you too Dean.” Cas sighs. “I never wanted you to get hurt.”
“Hey loser.” She says as greeting when he finally answers.
“Yes he did, I saw him!” Clair states vehemently and pulls away from her father to glare at them both.
Cas doesn’t object so Dean turns and presses his back to Cas’ chest and pulls Cas’ arm around his middle, lacing their fingers together over his heart. Cas gets the hint and curls himself around the other man, tucking his face into the crook of Dean’s neck. Dean falls asleep in Cas’ arms and it’s the first peaceful night’s rest he’s had since that day. But before sleep has fully claimed him he mumbles out a soft “Love you” and he feels Cas tighten his hold just a little bit.
Castiel groans when Charlie bounces into his office wearing a Santa hat and brandishing a plastic bowl full of paper scraps.
“You didn’t even know my name and you wanted to set me up with your friend?” Cas looks at her with a mixture of confusion and distrust.
“Why are you looking for a new apartment. Did Gordon kick you out?” Sam says over the end of Charlie’s sentence.
“I would love to see you guys Sammy but I kinda had plans with Cas.” Dean tells him and hopes his little brother understands.
“You almost caught us in the kitchen when I gave her some food and water. Sam kept her at his place for a couple days and he dropped her off this morning while you were still asleep.” Dean explains but Cas isn’t really listening.
“He did?” Cas asked hesitantly. “I-I mean we were kinda friends but it was so recent if he doesn’t remember anything from this year he probably doesn’t remember me.”
The rest of dinner continues in easy conversation and then they clean up and move to the living room. Jack convinces his parents to let him watch Arthur Christmas, promising he’ll go to bed right after it’s over. He doesn’t even make it half way through before he’s passed out across Sam’s lap. Dean gently scoops up the kid and takes him to his room Cas not so subtly makes an excuse to follow him.
“Let's get this show on the road.” Dean grips the handles of the carseats and carries them out to Cas’ Highlander. It’s not as cool as his baby but the older car just isn’t ideal for small children. Plus the carseats leave dents in the leather seats. Once the children are all strapped in they head off. Cas plays christmas music and sings along, glancing every now and then in the rearview mirror. He has mirrors strapped to the headrests of the back seats so he can see into the rear facing carseats. The babies are kicking their legs to the music and they can hear their high pitched squeals of excitement. Dean grins and rests his hand against Cas’ thigh while he drives. His fears haven’t abated much but he’s doing his best to push them down and enjoy the day. He’d even dressed the kids up in matching outfits for the occasion.
“Are you sure Sammy? I don’t want you to feel like you have to invite him.” Dean hesitates. He would love to celebrate christmas with the three people he loves the most but he doesn’t want to impose.
“Ok I’ll see you there.”
After they’ve run out of snowballs and the barricade is half demolished from Dean tackling Sam into it, they all shuffle inside. Half melted snow drips from their hair and Sam slips on a puddle of slush at the bottom of the stars, just managing to catch himself on the railing. Jack’s cheeks and nose are bright red and Cas has snow in his left ear, but they’re all laughing. Dean gazes at his family with a soft smile, filing this memory away for Heaven, Just in case, by some miracle, he ends up there in the end. This memory is one he wouldn’t mind reliving over and over again.
Dean and Cas had been sending funny memes and gifs back and forth since last night, well, it had started as memes and gifs then somewhere around two they just started talking. They talked for hours before Cas insisted on going to bed. When Dean woke the next morning he briefly wondered if the texting had all been a dream and scrolled through their conversation just to confirm that it wasn’t. He even scrolled to further to BSA (before stupid accident) conversations. It was mostly just memes and texts confirming plans. He realised that he and Cas exchanged memes every day, multiple times a day, for several months up to the date of his accident and then they just stopped. Until last night that is, and not for the first time, Dean wondered how close he and Cas really were BSA.
“Must be a little kid thing. Sam used to be the exact same way. Just slept through being manhandled into bed.” Dean reaches over to ruffle Sam’s hair and his brother slaps his hand away.
“I’ll come help you get your stuff and we’ll see if the camera is still there and if the pictures are still on it. Do you have a place to sleep tonight?” Sam asks.
“Yes.”
“If I knew you felt that way I wouldn’t have come. Come on Cas let’s go.” Dean stalks toward the stairs and Cas hesitates looking back and forth between the brothers.
“She’ll be ok right? I mean people do this all the time.” Dean asks as he stares at the door Sam and Eileen disappeared behind.
Sam smiles at his phone. He’s trying really hard not to imagine celebrating next christmas with Jess and introducing her to his family. It’s way too early for that but his heart doesn’t seem to care.
“A dinner party?”
“Ok, I see your point. Do you have any suggestions for what I should get him?” He tries to look as repented as possible and maybe a little pathetic so she’ll take pity on him.
“What time do you think you’ll be here?” She asked again with barely concealed irritation.
“Agent Masser” Sam answers and then after a short conversation hangs up. “Sorry man, you're gonna have to wait, they've got another body.” He tells Dean who sighs dramatically.
“Let’s go save dad and get this over with.” Cas, not so gently, shoves Gabe toward the hallway telling him to go find their brothers and then he and Dean walk into the kitchen to find Chuck trying to chisel the burnt bits off of the chicken breasts he’d tried to cook.
“That’ll be $3.75, Name?” He tries to be cheerful but it comes out a bit strained.
“You’re no fun” she pouts.
Cas slammed the door and stalked into his office on Monday morning. His secretary, Kali, watched him cautiously and sent a quick message to his brother Gabriel.
“Don’t guilt trip the boy Mary.” John grumbles at her “I’m pretty sure he already feels bad about it without your help.”
“Juice please.” She pulls out the juice and sets it on the table in front of Sam and then pulls out a couple beers for John and herself.
Sam and Dean were out on a hunt and they’d left Cas and Jack behind to ‘hold down the fort’ as Dean put it. Cas just squinted at him but didn’t ask, he’d learned that when Dean said things like that it was usually some common human phrase.
“Cas…” Dean says gently and pulls Cas into his arms. “I’m so sorry” he whispers into the man’s hair. “Do you need anything? Have you eaten?” Dean asks. He’s never been good with crying people. He doesn’t know what to do or if he should do anything.
This is an AU where Jack isn't fully grown after he's born. Sam, Dean, and Cas raise him like a normal child.
“Do you like apple juice?” A voice behind Cas asked. Jack stopped crying and looked at the man behind his father and gave a small nod.
“Hey Sam.” He whispers.
“Right, just a friend.” Sam rolls his eyes. “I don’t know about you but I don’t play footsie with my friends during family dinner.”
“Yep, seven pm.” He calls after her but she’s already gone, probably accosting some other poor bastard. He looks at the slip of paper again and shakes his head.
“It is christmas, Dean.”
“I’ve already tried that. She’s adamant that she’s not privy to that information” Castiel grumbles.
“Hey Cas, sorry to call you after hours but I just received an email from Mr. Alistair. He needed a copy of the invoice. I can't find it in our files.”
“I’m not afraid of Santa but Sam was when he was little. Like deathly afraid. He’d scream his head off. I don’t want our children to face that kind of fear at such a young age.”
“Wait, what about Cas’ bag.” Sam asks.
“A girl?” Gabe offers gently.
“Cas!” Dean yells at him “Get to work, this is war.” Cas quickly snaps into action and starts forming his own projectiles. Dean laughs with mirth and darts back and forth trying to dodge snowballs. He and Sam haven’t had a snowball fight in decades and he’s loving it. His fingers are frozen, there's melting snow sliding down the back of his shirt from a snowball he took the the back of his head, and, unlike Sam and the kid, he and Cas don’t have their own wall to hide behind so they’ve definitely taken more direct hits but it’s still one of the best days he’s had in awhile.
“Oh please have you seen the way he and Cas look at each other? I didn’t realize it until just recently but it makes total sense. And what you did tonight in front of your parents was uncalled for. He’ll come out when he’s ready and you really shouldn’t have interrogated him like that.”
“I’m so sorry honey.” She gently squeezes his arm then tells them to come out when they’re ready and have some pie if they want any. She even reassures Cas that she won't be offended if he doesn’t want any of the pie or if he would rather leave early. He and Dean do eventually join the rest of the family and have some pie and then the three boys say goodby and head back home.
“Don’t expect me to believe they’re not catering to your every whim.” Sam scoffs at his brother.
They spend the rest of Christmas watching classic holiday movies and nobody comments oh how clingy Dean is or the fact that he hasn’t stopped touching some part of Cas all day. They get it. Sam and Eileen were the same way the first couple days after they defeated Chuck. There was some deep rooted need to be in physical contact at all times just to make sure that no one was going anywhere. Jack understood too but on a different level and from more of an omnipotent perspective.
“Duly noted.” Cas smiles and takes a bite of the chicken. “Not too bad. It’s nowhere near as good as your bacon wrapped chicken but it’s not bad.” He comments and then takes another bite.
Dean really was not in the mood for a dinner party. He wasn’t in the mood for guests at all but Sam was so sure that these people would help him regain the two and a half years he’d lost. It was weird enough waking up in a hospital and having some nurse tell you that you were two years in the future but now he was expected to entertain friends he didn’t even know? Maybe for them it wasn’t weird but for him it was like time traveling and then being expected to take over his future self’s life with no knowledge of what had happened in the years he skipped.
Dean stretches out across the couch and plops his feet in Cas’ lap and the angel absentmindedly massages them while they watch the kid get his tongue stuck to a pole. Sam notices but doesn’t comment.
“So, Castiel, what are you getting Dean and Sam for christmas?” Charlie says as she sidles up next to Cas in the bunker’s library. “And can I, maybe, join in?” She bats her eyes at him.
“What can I do?” Cas sighs. “It’s over and as much as I'd like to get back together we’d still be in the same spot we were in before. The relationship wasn’t going anywhere and that still hasn’t changed.” Cas realizes he’s giving away way more than he originally intended to, but it’s been months of silence on the subject and he never realized how much he craved talking to someone about it.
“Patience has a project due tomorrow, Clair is on a date, I even tried Gabriel but he was out at some bar and he already sounded pretty drunk.” Cas grumbles into the comforter. Dean looks at the time with a sigh.
“Mommy and daddy and uncle Cas and uncle Dean and my dudes.” Ever since the twins were born Mary has referred to them as her dudes or baby dudes. Nobody knows how she came up with that but they suspect Charlie had something to do with it.
“Um, probably not with these cards” Sam hands the box back to Dean and his face reddens when he sees that they’re actually a sex postition card set.
He’d actually fallen asleep and he jumped when Cas said his name, dropping the book on the floor with a thud.
“Uh, I didn’t think of that.”
“Fine, see you tonight.” She bounces out of his office.
“She just sold out her girlfriend like that?” Castiel asked. He almost looked offended on Charlie's behalf.
The awkwardness stretches for one very long minute before Sam calls for everyone’s attention.
Eileen lets them scroll through the pictures on her camera while they wait for their food to arrive and they discuss their plans for the rest of the evening.
“I can do this” He whispers to himself. He’s been nervous since Sam sent him a text asking if he wanted to come over for dinner and it didn’t help that Dean never mentioned it once while they were texting. Maybe Dean didn’t mention it because he’s not even here. Cas muses. But why would Sam invite me over for dinner if Dean’s not here? What if he knows about me and Dean and he invited me over to tell me to leave his brother alone? I can’t do this.
“I like this one. You should bring him around more often.” John smiles at his older son then turns back to Cas. “So Castiel, tell us about yourself.”
“Um . . .” Cas starts and then stops, at a loss for words. “Ok I have one. Last September Dean bought me tickets to Sweeney Todd for my birthday; I’ve always wanted to go to a Broadway musical and he was able to find tickets for really great prices. So we’re sitting there waiting for the show to start and I noticed that there happened to be a lot of women in the audience. I mean we were two of maybe eight men total in the building and I thought it was interested because the show is pretty gory you know? I mentioned it to him and we tried to guess why so many women were there and we figured it’s probably because it’s a musical. Women tend to like musicals more than men do you know? So, finding that explanation to be satisfactory, we let the subject drop.  Well ten minutes later the lights dim and the curtains open. Standing directly in the middle of the stage is a man, and I suddenly become aware that the show we’re about to see is definitely not Sweeney Todd.”  Cas pauses for dramatic effect. “And I know this because the man on stage was completely naked. Dean, on the other hand, did not know that the show was not Sweeney Todd and the mortified look on his face when he asked me why there was a naked man was priceless. It turned out that there was a misprint on the tickets and the show we were seeing was called Naked Boys Singing. Sweeney Todd wasn’t scheduled to play until the day after.” The mortified look on Dean’s face was enough to force raucous laughter out of the rest of the group.
Cas moves back to his mouth and kisses him again. He’s got his body pressed up against Dean’s and he can feel the other man getting hard against his thigh. He moans and tries to pull Dean even closer. He’s missed this, missed Dean, so much. He feels like he’ll combust at any moment so he breaks away for a breath of air.
“Whatcha got there?” Cas asks with a smile. Dean gives him a nervous smile and the box jerks in his hands. He quickly steadys it before he drops it and Cas gives it a dubious glance.
“That’s ok, my girlfriend Madison is coming and he doesn’t remember her. I’m trying to get a mix of people he’s know for a long time and people he’s only met recently to see if anything helps.”
A short but sweet kid fic.
“Yeah I did, I told you about taking him to that new art exhibit and I told you two months ago when he moved in.”
“A record player?” Jack asks and that earns another chuckle from the man behind them.
“Yeah, I don’t need a mommy for christmas. I just want my friend Dean to come play trains with me and daddy.” Jack tells him and Cas is a little taken aback. “Would that be easier?” Jack asks him.
“Good cause I’d have to kick your ass if you did anything to insult my boyfriend.” Dean pats him on the back and then snatches up the remote.
Jess: You got any plans tomorrow?
“Those look great Jack. I’m glad you got to learn something new today.” He gives Jack a pat on the shoulder.
“You like me.” It’s not a question this time it’s a statement. Cas just nods.
“Hey Dean! We’re at a light show!” The woman in the booth smiles at Jack and then tells Cas that they need to stay in their vehicle the whole time and follow the arrows and then she tells him what station to turn the radio to. He nods at her instructions and hands her money for the entrance fee, then he follows the line of cars as they slowly drive through the elaborate set up.
--------------
Sam walks into the kitchen to see what’s taking them so long and then slowly backs out when he sees them.
His hand reaches forward without being told to and swipes the white foam off Dean’s face before Cas remembers that he’s not allowed to do things like that anymore. He freezes with his hand still in the air between them when he realises just what he’d done. Dean looks almost as stunned as him and then a bright red blush spreads across his face and he steps back and swipes at the same spot Cas had just touched.
“Nice to see you too mom.” Dean grumbles to himself.
“Hello”
“Now what’s all this about Santa?” Bobby rasps and clears his throat.
“Daddy I see Santa!” Jack bounced up excitedly and pointed to the jolly man.
“Probably. But you should know better. Your brother can't keep his trap shut to save his life. Especially when he's been drinking.”
“Ok, let's get out of here.” He grumbles and starts walking away.
“Um, no.” Cas looks up at her outburst. “We’ve never exchanged gifts before, why would this year be any different?”
“Oh, that makes sense.” Jack nods and sticks his finger in the frosting when he thinks Dean isn’t looking. Dean glances up just in time to see Jack suck the frosting covered finger into his mouth and he smirks at the kid.
“Yes sir, I’m Castiel.” Cas says as he shakes John’s hand.
“Because he hurt his knee and I was just trying to be nice.” Dean argues.
“Will he get his memories back?” Bess questioned.
“Dude that’s messed up.” Sam grimaces and Charlie nodes along, sharing his sentiments. Neither of them really liked Gordon but he and Dean had been assigned to the same dorm room their first year of college and they’d become friends so a couple years later when they decided to move out of the dorms they thought it would be more cost efficient if they just shared an apartment off campus. It had been going alright for nearly three years. At least Dean thought so, apparently he was wrong.
“No, honey.” Cas says at the same time Dean says “Never.” She pauses a beat while she considers everything she’s heard and then she shrugs.
“So number one you get to give your gift first.” A small woman from HR stands up and walks over to Anna. She hands her a brightly wrapped box that contains a 3D wooden puzzle. Anna grins at the gift and thanks her warmly. The next number is called and they slowly work through each secret santa until it’s Castiel’s number. He doesn’t stand, he just thrusts his gift into Dean’s hands, not making eye contact.
“Don’t leave us hanging dude, what did he get you?” Charlie says and there’s a murmur of agreement from the others.
“You’re not getting your best friends anything for christmas!?”
“Famous huh?” He asks her.
“What do you mean ‘gone’?” He has a pretty good guess but he needs Gabe to confirm it.
They spend the next couple hours with their diy sled, they do have to replace the trash bag when the first one rips but other than that it works pretty well. After they get bored of sledding they have a snowball fight and then Sam tries to make a snow man. It ends up looking more like a snow blob with one eye and a gaping hoal in its side but Dean lies and tells him it looks great.
“Do I think Dean may have been dating Cas? It’s possible.”
“But if you wake them up you’ll have to deal with them. If you’re quiet you can just sit here, drink a beer and watch tv while I’m gone.” Bobby pointed out and Rufus’ eyes widened in understanding.
……………..
“You forgot? I guess I’ll just have to tickle you till you remember.” Jack giggles and Dean steps aside to welcome Eileen in. He puts the child down and sends him to go find Cas.
Before he works up the courage to turn around he hears them get up and walk out of the room. He bows his head with a deep sigh when he knows they’re gone. Now he feels even worse because his moping has made them so uncomfortable that they didn’t want to even try with him this morning. Not that he blames them. It’s Christmas morning after all and no one wants to be stuck with a sulky joy killer on Christmas morning. Hell, he doesn’t even like being stuck with himself on a regular day.
“Oh, what did you have in mind?” Santa put his hands on her dad’s waste and Clair glaired.
“Dude you have nothing to eat here.” Gabe said. Opting to ignore Cas’ question.
It works.
“We’ll get in trouble” Dean sighs. What he really means Is ‘I’ll get in trouble’ because John never got mad at Sam for anything. Dean was older so Sam was his responsibility, which meant he took the blame for any misbehaviour.
Sam fusses with his hair in the bathroom mirror for a ridiculously long time. He just couldn’t get that one piece to stop falling in his face. With a huff he gives up and decides to just wear a hat. They’ll be outside anyways, so it’ll keep his ears warm, in addition to restraining the rogue hairs.
---------------
“Jack what have I told you about answering the door without a grownup?” Dean scolds and the boy looks up at his dad sheepishly.
“Sorry that’s me.” He said, not sorry at all and walked out of the room to answer his phone.
“Is your family getting a new baby?” Santa asks her excitedly.
Before he can think better of it he’s sidling up next to Castiel and making a comment about how boring work christmas parties are. The man looks up at him with a confused expression and mumbles something along the lines of an agreement. Before his talk with Charlie, Dean would have automatically assumed his lack of response was due to him thinking he was too good to talk to Dean. But now he can see how the guys hands were shaking slightly. He really was nervous talking to Dean, of all people.
“Yes, just like the grinch.” Dean tells her.
“So our sitter canceled last minute. Cas has been calling around trying to find a backup but he hasn’t had any luck. So the question is do you want to reschedule for another night or would you be alright doing dinner here? It would mean having dinner with a four year old.” He asks. They’ve got everything they need for some burgers and Dean can throw together a potato salad pretty quickly.
He glances around the nearly empty theater and catches sight of the hot econ guy, Cas, walking down the aisle and checking the seat number on his ticket stub. He’s alone too and a moment of bravery seizes Dean, or maybe it’s insanity he’s not sure, and he gets up from his seat and swiftly walks over to where the guy’s just sat down and plops in the seat next to him.
“Just let mom and dad know that I won’t be coming over tonight.”
The insistent buzzing startles Dean awak and for a moment he wanders where he is. He Feels a warm weight against his chest and glances down to see a head of dark hair. He gently strokes the hair back from Cas’ forehead and then the buzzing starts again. Dean fishes the phone out of his pocket, careful not to disturb the sleeping man and looks to see who’s calling him.
“Oh that’s a fun age” She nodded toward the toy cars and trains. “When my oldest was that age he loved toy cars and so did most of his friends. Trains too. Or if that doesn’t work you could try toy swords, guns, lightsabers, anything that makes a noise or a mess, coloring books, balls, pretty much anything really. Five year olds are pretty easy to please.”
“Ok, stop.” Cas cuts in. “Sam, I’m sorry I think there's been a little mixup.”
“They were pretty cute.” Dean grins at Cas “With their little noses painted red and the off key singing.”
Cas chuckles, he’s giddy with the high of finally getting to kiss his boyfriend after several weeks. He knows he should talk to Dean. Ask him when he got his memory back. Ask him why he didn’t tell him he’d gotten his memory back. Because clearly Dean remembers them. He wouldn’t kiss Cas like that if he didn’t remember. Past Dean would have been too nervous to even try something like that.
“Oh that’s right. You always had ‘Cas days’ as Sam liked to call them. We could always count on you being out of the apartment on Tuesdays.” Madison chimed in, then blushed when she realized what she’d implied about her and Sam’s relationship.
“Are we doing presents or not?” Cas calls after he’s located the gift. He’d expected Dean to follow him out of the kitchen like an excited puppy. Dean was unusually excited for christmas this year and Cas thought he’d be just as excited to finally open presents this morning, but he was still in the kitchen.
“She had a heart attack Cassy. Last night or early this morning they’re not sure she just went to bed and…and now she’s gone.”
“I’ll talk to him. I’m not sleeping in the basement.” Dean opens the suitcase and pulls out a few things. He wants to wash off all the travel grime before dinner. He gives Cas a kiss and then leaves to find the bathroom Sam pointed out earlier. Cas wanders into the kitchen to see if Eileen needs any help. She doesn’t hesitate to put him to work.
“So we can take them to the police and get a restraining order.” Sam says as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. And Dean has to admit that it does make sense.
“Hi” His voice sounds wrecked and he clears his throat, hoping she doesn’t notice or at least writes it off as something else.
Castiel was late for work and Jack was throwing a tantrum in the middle of the coffee shop. It wasn’t Cas’ normal coffee shop near the elementary school. Jack’s school had let out for winter break that week and Cas usually sent Jack next door to stay with their neighbor while he was at work but she’d slipped in her driveway the day before and broken her hip. He hadn’t been able to find anyone who could take the kid all day. His sister Anna said she could watch him in the afternoon but she had to work the morning shift. So Cas found himself hauling a grumpy, half asleep, child to the coffee shop on the way to work.
“What kind of dreams?”
Cas wraps the leather around his wrist where it belongs and fastens the clasp. Even if it means nothing to Dean anymore it still means something to him. He can almost convince himself that the promise it holds of always being together is true.
Sam spends the next twenty minutes stubbornly sitting on his bed and facing the wall. He’s doing it in hopes that it’ll make Dean feel bad about not letting him play outside.
“Clair honey, are you having a bad morning?” He tries again and she shoots him a scathing look.
“Is this the famous Dean I’ve heard so much about?” She asks.
“There should be a hard copy in my filing cabinet.” Cas sits up and rubs at his temple with his free hand.
“Yep” She says with a pop of the p. “I’m gonna go grab the pie” She gives Sam a double thumbs up and then scurries off into the kitchen. Sam just rolls his eyes and goes to find the place with the best view of their trap.
“That’s great. Are you able to get away now and take a break?” She asks.
“No uh, her name is Cassy. Cas is just a friend from school.” Dean doesn’t look away from Sam when he answers his mother.
“I can’t wait to meet them but before that why don’t you tell me what you want for christmas this year.” Santa gives her a cheerful smile.
“What’s a light show?” Jack asked and Can was hit with yet another realization. Jack may not be a normal toddler but he was still a new human and, while he could walk and talk and kill a man without breaking a sweat, he was just a kid.
“Cas, buddy, these are um… nice?” He wonders why Cas thought he’d want them. Charlie comes back and fills each shot glass, handing the other lady one to Sam and Jody takes one of the dude ones. Donna turns down the shot so Charlie presses it into Dean’s hand. He gives it a once over and is impressed by the detail put into making it anatomically correct. They down their ‘body shots’ and then Charlie encourages him to finish opening his gifts. Dean shakes his next present and gives Cas a wary look.
“It’s not really office gossip if I don’t work there. And it’s not like she’s talking to any of the other people in the office. Just me. She’s worried it might be something I did but I don’t remember offending you the last time we spoke. In fact I remember you being exceptionally chipper the last time we spoke. What happened?”
“Cas what’s wrong?” Dean asks as soon as the door is open. Cas’ bottom lip trembles and Dean immediately pulls him into a tight hug. They stand in the open doorway wrapped up in each other’s arms for a minute before Dean gently pushes Cas back and looks at him. “What happened.”
“I won’t”
Cas racked his brain for an appropriate story that wouldn’t give too much away. There were a lot of stories that he wanted to share with Dean. Stories he wanted Dean to remember. Like that time they broke Dean’s couch during an impromptu wrestling match over the remote. They’d propped it up so it looked fine and then when Sam sat on it later that evening, after Cas had left, it fell back down. To this day Sam still believes he was the one who broke the couch. Or When Dean bought Cas flowers for their first date only to find out that Cas was allergic to something in the bouquet. He had hives all over his hands and arms and Dean, upon realizing it was the flowers, snatched the offending things from Cas’ hands and threw them out the window. Cas had looked on in bewilderment and then started laughing. “I could have still put those in a vase or something. They wouldn’t have bothered me if I didn’t touch them.” Cas still teased Dean about the flowers, well, he did before  now Dean wouldn’t even know what he was talking about.
“Yes, all the excitement must have worn him out. Didn’t even stir when I took off his shoes and changed him into pajamas.”
“Uh oh, did you get Becky again?” Charlie asks.
“Oh, ok.” There’s a pause and Dean can hear the cheerful christmas music from the other end of the line before he asks. “So how is it?”
“It was delicious Sam.” Cas responds.
“Is he ok?” Sam asks. “Sorry, that’s a stupid question. Of course he’s not ok. Do you need me to do anything”
“Dean” Sam says and points into the room. They both look through the window and see snow falling from seemingly nowhere. Then they hear the song Let It Snow Let It Snow Let It Snow coming from somewhere in the room. It's just a faint muffled sound but Sam is able to pick out the lyrics.
“Well you know what this means?”
“Cool I’ll tell him to expect three, unless you plan on bringing a date?” Cas shook his head at Gabe’s question. ”Great, I’ll see you then. It’ll be so cool we’ll get to see some of our old college buddies.” Gabe smiled and then said goodbye to Kali a second time.
“But I do and that’s exactly the problem. I’m afraid that I will read too much into it” Cas sighs.
Sam stared at his older brother like he was trying to figure out a complex puzzle. “You know you can tell me anything right? I won’t judge.” He said after a moment’s consideration.
“I’ve got nothing” he looks over at his brother hoping he might have found something but Dean just groans and echoes his words.
“Novak,” the guy says and gives Sam an odd look. All of their previous interactions have been friendly so he couldn’t figure out what he had done to offend him.
“Then why did Sam bring him up?” John asks. Now more intrigued with the conversation. Mary raises her eyebrow at him and he shrugs.
“Oh, sorry” Dean’s clearly at a loss for what to say.
Sam doesn’t even comment when Dean drops him off at their apartment and then tells him not to wait up cause he’s gonna be at Cas’ for the night. He just waves his brother off and then goes to call his girlfriend.
They spend the rest of the morning just relaxing in bed. They talk and kiss and just quietly hold each other until Dean’s stomach demands attention. He pulls Cas into the kitchen and scrambles some eggs for them and they eat in silence with their knees bumping under the table occasionally.
“Oh, he’s back!” Charlie, his manager/ friend who got him the job, suddenly materializes by his side and Sam looks up to see who she’s talking about. It’s the guy that works in the admissions office at their university. He’s been coming in almost every morning for the past six months but he was mysteriously absent for several days.
“Hello” the voice on the phone chimes after three rings.
“No man, you’re the guest. I’ll take the couch. Trust me, you’ll be much more comfortable on the bed.”
“I went alone but ran into a friend.” As soon as the words leave his mouth he knows it’s a terrible idea but Gabe latches onto the information excitedly. There would be no hope of changing the subject now.
“Thanks for your time, please let us know if you’re able to do any tests.” Sam says and hands the man a business card with his fake name and phone number on it.
“Do you have enough to eat? Are you going to be ok?” His mother is worried now.
“I would like that.” Cas smiles at him.
“You didn’t seem any different than the last time we saw you.” Sam defends himself.
Dean just grunts and pours himself a large cup of coffee after a few sips a strip of bacon he answers.
The memory of his friend, Jack’s mother, still causes him pain. Especially on days when he feels like he’s failing her. When he’d agreed to be Jack’s guardian if anything ever happened to her he hadn’t expected her to die just a few days later. Jack was only a couple days old when Kelly invited Cas to come and meet him and that was when she asked if he would be Jack's guardian. She’d almost died giving birth to Jack and it had scared her, so as soon as she got out of the hospital she’d called up a lawyer and set up her will. She told Cas she’d named him as Jack’s guardian but if he wasn’t comfortable with it she could change it. He’d assured her that he was fine with it and then the next day she was rushed to the hospital. She’d gotten an infection from the complications during Jack’s birth and it hadn’t been detected early enough. It spread to her lungs and she was put on a ventilator but by that point the damage was too extensive. She’d died after a couple days in the ICU and Cas went home with a newborn baby.
“It’s just what people do.” Dean shrugs “Maybe it symbolises angels watching over people or something?” Cas just looks even more confused.
“What are these?” Jack pulls one out of the sleeve and stares at it holding some ancient secrets. A middle aged man in line behind them laughs and he gives Sam a commiserating look.
“Dean said he was having a hard day when he called earlier to tell me he was bringing a friend. Did we do something?” Mary looks worried.
“Sure.” Dean follows after him still unsure of what to do.
“Coulda fooled me.” Dean seeths.
“Oh, he already knows.” Cas dismisses the threat. “You know how crazy my family gets and how crowded my parents house is on christmas morning. I really just want a quiet christmas and I don’t mind that it’s not just the two of us as long as it’s not crazy. Which so far it’s been pretty nice.” Dean grins at Cas and gives him a soft kiss.
“Last Christmas” he says with a shudder. “I can’t get it out of my head.” Sam looks at Dean who shrugs, neither of them know what song he’s talking about but they don’t ask.
“Tilt it a little more,” Sam says again but his parents ignore him. “Mom?” Sam tries but she just looks confused. “Tilt the screen”
“You’re right, I’m just being selfish because I miss you and I haven’t seen you in so long.” Sam sighs and Dean can’t stay mad at him when he’s being all emotionally mature and shit.
“You made me a mixtape?” He asks and Cas nods. “You know what this means right? Giving someone a mixtape.”
“Yeah, well…” Cas shrugs.
He should have known this would be a disaster. The second he’d called his parents to let them know he wouldn’t make it home this year because his flight was canceled after a massive snow storm that had no intention of stopping any time soon. He’d taken the refund for his ticket and called his parents. It was his mother that suggested doing a video call after dinner.
“325 South Prescott Street” Sam tells him and then points at a house to their left. “I think it’s that one”
“Because a bad man has been stealing people’s christmas presents and we” He gestures to himself and Dean “are going to everyone’s houses and making sure all of their gifts are still there.” Sam explains to the child, hoping she’s young enough to believe him.
“Probably making out somewhere.” Sam guesses.
“Gabe?” Cas asks hesitantly, but his brother doesn’t respond.
“It’s your turn to pick a name Castiel” She singsongs as she waves the bowl in front of his face.
“Dean!” He calls and his brother saunters over. He says something to their parents but Sam can’t hear it and when he hovers over their window he can see they’re muted. His mother is saying something to the computer and then she looks back at Dean who shrugs.
“CD?” Jack tests out the new word.
They spend the rest of the evening talking about this and that and pretty soon Eileen decides to call it a night with Sam following not long after her. He asks Dean and Cas if they mind calling it an early night and they tell him they’re ready for bed too. They’ve had a long day of traveling. They say their goodnights with Sam checking and double checking that they don’t need anything before he heads to bed. They assure him they’ll be fine.
“No, she was terrible in the kitchen.” Cas laughs. “But she loved apple pie, especially after my grandmother died. I was the only one who knew how to make granny's apple pie so every year my mother would ask me to make pie for the holidays and sometimes she’d even try to help. It was really the only thing we had to bond over.”
“What are your plans for the day?” Dean asks while they eat.
“It depends on what time Cas gets done with his exams. I’m pretty sure we’ll be there in time for dinner but it might be close.” He says distractedly as he digs through his dresser looking for the sweater his grandmother had knitted last year. The thing is ugly as sin and itchy like you wouldn’t believe but he promised his mom he’d wear it when he saw his grandma.
“Ok, um, there was a knock at my door and when I opened it I saw Nancy just… standing there holding something in her hand. It was red and dripping blood and it kept moving. I didn’t realise what it was until it was in my hand. And I could have swore it was still beating.” He shudders a little. “I mean, how is that even possible? How was she even standing there with that gaping hole in her chest?” The man asks, clearly in shock.
“You were intimidated by me?” He asks in disbelief. “Me?”
Jack is adamant about seeing Santa again because he needs to change his wish and that’s all he’ll tell Cas. They get to the front of the line and when Santa’s eyes lock on Jack he breaks into a wide grin.
“No” Dean grumbles. He was actually impressed with the fake Santa. The guy really had a way with kids and he was able to handle both babies with ease.
------------------
Chaos, the bunker is in utter chaos. Dean is throwing jackets and shoes at people telling them to put them on. Cas is trying to find his phone which just so happens to be in his hand. Sam runs back and forth with a duffle bag throwing in things they really don’t need like salt and red spray paint. And Eileen is standing in the middle of it all looking royally pissed off. She’s tried to get their attention multiple times but they don’t seem to hear her over the noise they're all making. Jack seems to be the only calm one. He’d quietly escorted Jody, Donna, and the girls out to their cars and told them they’d call when things calmed down. Then he’d answered the call from Charlie, telling them she and Stevie were running late, and told her that plans had changed and they would see them on another day.
“I’ll tell you what kid, if your dad says it’s ok, I’ll trade you my apple juice for your orange juice.” The man smiles at Jack and then turns his eyes on Cas.
“Yes, Miracle. Because it’s a miracle that my boyfriend who doesn’t really like dogs got me a dog for christmas.” Cas gives Dean a gummy smile.
“Yeah dad, we know how corrupt corporations are.” Sam rolls his eyes and takes a bite of his sandwich.
“And you’re already drunk?” Cas grumbles as he pulls away from his brother. “Where’s Kali? Isn’t she supposed to keep you away from the liquor at family dinners?”
“That sounds lovely.” Mary smiles. “When John and I were newlyweds we had a little apartment on fifth ave and I tried to grow some herbs in window boxes but there just wasn’t much room or sunlight. I would have loved the chance to have my own garden even if it was just a small one.”
