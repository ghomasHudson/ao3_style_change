It’s an unimaginable thought.
Cas is still staring at him with that otherworldly focus. The one that makes him feel like he’s the only being in existence. "Are you sure?"
Cas blinks at the tiny parcel and then at Dean, whose eyes are suddenly glued to the road in concentration.
He shuffles closer until their shoulders are touching and flicks on the Tv. In the back of his mind a milky thought tries to float to the surface but Dean doesn’t let it. This moment right now, with Cas, snuggled under
Cas scoots awkwardly along the bed until he’s perched beside Dean, his profile unreadable as he stares at the wall. Dean leans forward and gently turns his head until he can see the back. He runs his fingers along the scalp where his skull made contact with the door and tries to ignore how Cas seems to lean back against his touch. He’s probably just imagining that anyway. “It looks okay. Don’t think you’ll even have a bruise.”
“The night we met.”
Cas’ gaze flicks quickly to Dean and then away, but not before he catches the flash of hurt that crosses his face. “Sam isn’t here, as you’re already aware. I don’t know why you don’t want me to do this, but I’m just trying to help you.”
Dean considers this for a moment. Cas kind of is the jealous type. “Nah, you’re good.”
“Of course.” Cas closes his eyes. Why are emotions so difficult?
“Yes,
blanket, is the only thing Dean cares about.
It’s a blissful feeling.
Cas moves his hands to Dean's face, gently wiping the tears from beneath his eyes. “It’s real, Dean. Me and you, we’re the only thing I’ve ever been certain was.”
Damn it, he’s charming! Dean Winchester is charming! He digs through his social arsenal and pins what he hopes is a reassuring smile on to his face. "My name is Dean."
“Oh, you have to be careful with roses. Pretty but dangerous!” She takes the rose from him and expertly adds it to the bouquet.
Agatha clearly doesn't know what to make of this but she’s too polite, or maybe just too uninterested, to ask. She moves on, leading Dean over to some bright red flowers, shaped like hearts. “These are known as flamingo flowers but I call them love hearts. They ooze romance!”
“Ow! Watch it!”
And when his brain calms down and the smoke clears, he’ll say it again.
On the other end, Dean chuckles again. “Who’s hanging up first?”
The woman stares back at him in agonizing silence.
Cas senses rather than sees Dean shake his head. "Cas, it's not your fault that you got injured. I can't tell you the number of injuries I've had over the years. Hell, you've seen most of them for yourself."
Cas has experienced many days since that night in the barn, but this, right now, is the very best of them.
Dean can’t help but smile. “Nah, he’s an angel.”
"Hi. I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions?"
“Yes. You humans tend to sleep a lot and I ran out of books to read.”
He looks at the cake strewn about the place and a part of him never wants to clean it up.
Cas smiles, his eyes crinkling the way Dean adores, and follows him through the door. Inside, the terminal is loud and crowded, people bustling to and fro with luggage and screaming children. Why are children always screaming in crowded places? If anyone should be screaming, it should be him. He’s about to willingly step on an airplane in the hopes that it won’t explode. A feeling of panic starts to inch its way along his skull but Cas cuts it off quickly with a gentle hand on his elbow and a nudge towards the security gate.
“I disagree.” Cas says, tilting his head in that annoyingly familiar way. He is an immovable, stubborn creature. A force of nature. A constant worry.
Cas smiles to himself as he rests a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I love those. But it’s not the same when you’re not here.”
“I’m glad, Cas,” he mutters, his breath close to Cas’ ear.
That remark earns a very enthusiastic eyeroll from Dean and a nervous stomach flip to match it. "Hot stuff? Really, Cas?"
A heavy silence descends on the space between them in the seconds that follow and Dean starts to feel like an animal trapped in a net. He wants to leave. He wants Cas to say something. He wants the ground to crack open and swallow him whole. Finally, he manages to drags his eyes from the floor to look at Cas who is staring at his exposed torso with eyes the size of dinner plates.
Silence.
“A wish?”
“I could say I’m sorry, Dean, but that would be a lie”.
Steve follows his eyeline to Cas who is still watching them intently.
His turns his head, shock lighting up his features. “Dean, what are you doing here?”
“Number five. I hate that it’s taken me almost eight months to fix up this old wreck of a place.” He motions to the repainted oak walls of the lakehouse, the boxes neatly unpacked, the reading nook with its upholstered window seat, the polished floors, the new light fittings. “I hate it because I wish it took longer. Every time I fix something, or paint something, or build something, I feel like I’m fixing a piece of our story, something we broke along the way. I feel like I’m building towards our future and I- I don’t ever want to be done with that.” Cas can feel his stomach turning somersaults under the pressure and depth of the love he feels for the man standing before him. He wants to tell him again how much he means to him, wants to tell the world. But this moment is for the human he loves, the person who spent years crushed beneath the weight of the words he couldn’t say.
“Yes, I mean, I intent to, but this is not…” When he sounded so human, with all of this ranting, Dean felt almost as if there was nothing separating them. But then again, so much happened, they both made mistakes, they both almost killed each other and…
“It’s quite an uncommon knowledge among the angels, but I once worked with a guy, who did a few researches about Nephilim,” he started and Dean knitted his brows together. What guy? “He discovered a very old report, similar to the one we found and investigated some time ago.”
Then he was hit by that smell.
The party had been great, and Jo had been happily chatting with Sam’s fiancée Jess and a young, bubbly woman from next door, that stood out immediately with flaming red hair and a Star Trek shirt. Dean was content, that she made friends that easy and the sight eased the guild, that he had had for taking her out of her familiar environment. Of course, she had told him, she was fine with moving here, but Dean felt guilty anyway.
Castiel. His mate.
"What are you doing here?" the omega asked, noticing too late that it sounded quite rude. Well, no brother here now to stop him from saying stuff that made the alpha go. Which he apparently didn't.
On their way back, they passed a local bar, only three hundred meters from the motel, and as Dean saw a familiar form disappearing through the doors he held his brother back. “Hey, I will go for a drink,” he said and licked his lips at the prospect. He could do some investigating in his favourite environment with girls around him and some booze in his hand.
“It’s not your fault that your wife is in this state, she probably got depressions from the pregnancy and the outer circumstances and these are very serious. What I’m trying to say is, that you really could not have done a lot different, I mean you both decided to marry and being gay is really not your fault nor could you have foreseen it that well if everybody always tried to press you into a certain character. So, the ones to blame here are definitely your family members and Sam said you two should consider a doctor but also find somebody your wife trusted before you married, maybe a family member or a friend.”
There was a short silence on the other end and then laughter.
“Thank you for… saving me,” he manged to get out, while he clapped the other on the shoulder, in a way, he thought was appropriate between two male friends. Not as if anything they had done in the last five minutes was something like appropriate, but they could play it down and forget about it like they always did.
"I'm not the same person I was created as," Dean still tried to argue but he began to understand that the other was about as stubborn if not more than he was. "I changed since birth, ya know?"
"Can I scent you?" Cas suddenly asked and shook his head afterwards while taking a deep breath. "I'm- I'm sorry, I didn't intend to be this straightforward. It's just the alpha voice telling me to reassure myself that you are going to be okay."
“Do you think it was an angel?” Sam asked Cas and it made sense to Dean. Why hadn’t he thought about that? The angel on their side nodded. “Could be possible, maybe they use humans now to travel in disguise from the Nephilim and us.”
The alpha got up slowly as if to not scare a wild animal and lowered his face towards Deans. For a second the omega thought he would kiss him and was kind of glad he didn't because he wouldn't have known what to do then.
"You're in rut," Dean stated the obvious and Anna, who had been turned towards her brother, rolled her eyes.
Why did everything always happen in the most inappropriate moments? The nursery was not even ready yet. Dean had wanted to add a few pictures of their family to the walls and they hadn’t found anything to save Glynn and overall… the hunter was not ready to be a father.
The man’s smile widened just a bit.
The two hunters, the angel and the alien lady arrive at the bunker. Being concerned about the baby, they decide to see a doctor and make an ultrasound.
“It’s a- it’s a girl?” he asked and hoped to keep all of his emotions out of his voice. The hand that was laid on his arm from his left showed him, that he didn’t succeed, but he didn’t dare to look down.
"How are you feeling?" Cas asked, brow furrowed. Dean motioned for him to sit down in the armchair. He suddenly really wanted to give the other a blanket or a pillow so he could rub his scent all over those and Dean never had to let it go again.
“Don’t you understand? The child will be the heir of the Winchester line and at the same time the offspring of a very powerful seraph,” the unknown angel hissed as if this should be clear. “It will be a vessel, that can hold any angel, no matter how strong and can be a forceful weapon on its own. I would have supposed that you had wondered why we took so much effort in creating an offspring of yours.”
What would he give for a normal birth in a normal hospital, where somebody could make a c-section now and everybody would live. But nothing in his life was ever normal.
Glancing over into Cas eyes, he saw that the other had wide eyes, and if the angel had really learned how to cry, Dean was sure, there would also be tears glistening in the blue orbits.
Den smiled tiredly. He would have protested, but his mother was essentially the same age he was and therefore probably didn't have worse back problems.
“What are you doing here?” he managed to spit out to the man that was uncomfortably laying on his front with his face pressed into the pavement.
It was a Sunday when he met him.
“Everything is all right,” Dr. Gabriel said, advising a nurse to wrap the boy and putting the stethoscope back around his neck. “He is just a little bit shy. Congratulations for a healthy daughter and a healthy son.” With that, he placed the small boy in Dean’s other arm, who directly went to Jo to lay the babies on her chest.
Left to him, the hunter noticed the kitchen utensils hanging neatly next to each other, the potato masher standing out against the others. He really needed to learn how to cook for a baby at least, if he couldn’t cope with his feelings.
“It’s perfect,” Jo said next to him and smiled wide. The open spatial concept and the big windows on the backside where exactly what they both had wished for. To the right of the entry was the staircase, that led to the first floor and behind that, Dean could see a big, open kitchen with bright yellow cupboards. To the left was a little bathroom and straight ahead was the room that was most likely the living room and dining room in one.
The man didn’t protest, and Sam helped him up to haul him towards their car. As Dean started to walk, he remembered his hurting ankle and flinched, what made the angel turn towards him.
After a short drive they arrived at something called Black Canyon Motel, what Dean eyes suspiciously. Not that he was too much of a pussy for these kinds of places now, but when he closed his eyes, he always just saw his memory foam mattress in his own four walls.
Behind the angel Glynn let out an iron cutting cry, making all of the three men aware of the proximity of death.
“In a relationship”, the angel jumped in when Dean took a more extended break than it was comfortable.
The hunter manoeuvred Baby into a free parking lot of a clinic a town over. He looked again at the angel and found him staring back at him as if in deep thoughts. Panic swept over Dean like a wave. If the guild overcame the other in the same way, he would maybe think of a completely stupid reason and leave, and then…
"Which hospital? I'll come," the alpha stated just like that as if it wasn't probably three in the morning.
“We need to take you into questioning, Mr…” “Walter,” Sam jumped in. “You know you entered this property without permission, and our earlier investigations gave rise to a few more questions, that you can probably help us with.”
The older hunter wondered for a moment, why Cas was not correcting his mind brabbling, when he suddenly heard a voice in the church speaking.
Dean breathed in deeply. This was it. This bit of body contact that had always been forbidden by his own mind was better than everything he could have ever imagined, like an explosion in his nervous system. It felt as if the air around Cas, that smelled like him was pure oxygen and Dean had lived on a 15% percent restriction all his life. They moved their lips very slowly against each other as if they were trying out uncharted waters.
“Just don’t stay away for too long,” she said accompanied by a long yawn. “They get twirly when you’re not here.”
"No, our dad had some business with demons and angels both, and he dragged us into it," Sam revealed despite the death-threatening glare he received from his brother. To hell, if they had already gone this far, what did it matter now.
Why not, Dean wanted to ask, but he didn’t want to assume, that he himself was into them. That would have been really contra productive, considering his plans. So, Dean just looked Cas up and down, showing obvious approval on his face and smiled what he hoped was warmly. “So, how was your day?”
There was no way she could get emotional stability from any of the Winchesters.
"Sam," Dean croaked out because he really didn't want to wake his brother, but the guy would probably have a stiff neck by tomorrow from sleeping this way. Years of training got the younger Winchester out of his slumber by milliseconds.
Thanks for reading and please leave kudos if you liked it ;)
As Cas nodded after a few seconds, Dean took in a sharp breath. From what he had caught from the book Sam had read to him, it was scarce but possible for true mates to feel the other's feelings after being mated. But this?
Without the useless verbal confirmations of the other's wellbeing, Sam got straight to the point, reading the older Winchesters expression correctly.
“She was conceived when I was “riding along” in Dean’s “vessel” because he was hurt”, Cas explained in his gravely voice, air quotes and all. At that, even the other two Winchesters raised their brows. “She has Dean’s genes and my grace which makes her a Nephilim.”
It was soft and needy at the same time, and Dean felt again as if he had been cut off of oxygen his entire life and was breathing it in now. Cas scent, which had been a little bit dampened by Dean's own nervous one before was all around him, and he couldn't get enough of it.
"What's wrong?" one of the guys behind him suddenly asked, and he sprung back into reality like a spring, that had been tightened for too long.
After that, Dean didn’t really remember much. He got his brother free and both of them to the car, but the spell must have been stronger than the times before, because he got the rest of the events from Sam’s notes.
He remembered Crowley talking about this meeting, some kind of territorial tit for tat, and that the omega didn't have to come, because they had enough guns and 'tough guys'. Dean could only laugh at that. If the beta was the head of the organisation, the omega definitively was his brain.
"You all right," the bus driver, a man in his fifties with beard covered cheeks and a baseball cap asked as soon as Dean entered.
“I need to try and get things straight with Cas,” he said in a low voice. “Want to have everything settled before the babies come, alright?” He could see Jo nod in the dim light.
”Nice companionship you got there,” Dean said after Cas fell into the black leather. At the look of his frown, Cas didn’t approve the assumption.
Dean wanted to ask, what he meant by that, but he had made the mistake to look down at Cas mouth. Oh, those gorgeous lips. He knew his gaze lingered there for too long and when he looked up into the other man’s eyes again he imagined he saw an unspoken question there. Unconsciously, he leaned in a bit, never averting his gaze from those blue orbits.
“Hey, little girl,” Dean said and went over to stand very close to his angel and their daughter. “Do you want me to rock you a little bit to make the air come out of your belly?”
Before, he had only gotten glances of it, tiny whiffs taken in between a fight or when they stood too close for no reason at all and this felt completely different.
“That explains a lot,” Sam said, sitting on a chair in their motel room, stretching out his long legs. He had shown up at Glynn and Kates flat the moment the two other men had emerged from it and they had filled him in on the way.
Duh-duh-duuhhh...
"You don't believe," he simply stated and then carried on. "You don't believe that nature or whatever god there is, makes true mates perfect for each other. I just knew that you would never harm me since you are the person that fits me the best on earth and I don't wanna die. Or get hurt"
Maybe Sam looked over at them and then turned away, a slightly disgusted but also smug smile on his face. Maybe all of heaven and hell and purgatory and whatever else there was, was after them, but right now Dean didn’t care at all.
Dean was struck to silence once again. That was only two months away, or probably less, if their cycles shortened even further. Damn, Dean didn't remember ever having real heats as frequent as three months apart, it must be horrible to have them more often. Maybe not if you have the right partner, a quiet voice at the back of his skull whispered.
“Yes, but it wouldn’t make sense, because I should have felt the conceiving of a Nephilim back then, even in my closed of state.” The angel frowned and Dean’s heart melted at seeing his best friend question his disappearing angel abilities.
“Can I help you?” Dean asked because there was no way the other could have recognised him since he had been disguised and always wore scent blockers-
Without further words they agreed on Dean going around the house to climb over the fence, Sam to duck into the shadows of the bushes and for Cas to go up to the flat to protect the door.
“We do?”
"Dean, oh. Hello Dean," Cas stammered as if he hadn't expected for the other to call. He had his rights, Dean thought since it had already been five days. "Are you alright, Dean?"
“She was all right, when she was in the flat, right?” Dean asked and dropped himself into the front seat of his Baby. “Everybody probably thinks she’s crazy anyways, so why bother. If she talks about the angels and stuff and what she might have seen, nobody will believe her.”
Instead of waiting for an answer he came inappropriately close and tried to feel Deans sides and head without hurting him. The hunter had to admit that he would be doing exactly the same if their positions were reversed, though.
“What else does it say?” Dean asked after more moments of silence and Cas looked up at him as if he had almost forgotten that there were more people in the room.
Dean slept for almost fourteen hours, after having laid down for a nap until he was woken by the sound of his phone ringing. It was Crowley's ringtone, Gives You Hell from The All-American Rejects, and that couldn't mean anything good.
So, when Cas came back one day with a piece of paper in his one hand and the rest of the mail in the other, he was trembling. Dean immediately got up from the couch approaching him but not quite daring to touch the other. With her head leaned on the armchair, Jo was looking up from the floor, where she had been reading a magazine on hunting while playing with her baby’s feet.
“God sent me!” Jim chocked out and Dean forgot why he remembered his name.
“A Nephilim,” Dean said dumbly and this time Cas looked up at him.
Jo’s face turned into a painful grin and she hit her husband in the arm with her fist. “Okay Dean, I know you are freaking out, but you have to calm down,” she said panting heavily as another contraction hit her. “You love Cas and he loves you. Don’t say anything,” she continued as Dean wanted to interrupt her. “I saw his face when he looks at you, he is one hundred percent screwed. Just like you. So, get your shit together; our children will love it when you’re happy and by the way, they need you now, so can you pleasaaaahh”
"Remember that thing that was going down tonight in the old warehouse with the guys from Heaven's angels, where I said you didn't have to come? Well, you need to come here right now. I send you the locations." Dean heard the sound of a phone call ending and took a deep breath. Well, he had to go now, didn't he?
Dean only knew, that there was a button for that since they had inspected the warehouse two weeks ago to search for any emergency exits, and/or possibilities for a trap.
"I mean, if you don't want, that's fine with me, we can wait. Or we don't have to mate at all." Dean felt the courage leaving him thinking that this had probably been a bad idea. Who would want to mate him, a lost man who had stolen more money from people than he could count? Not because he couldn't count very high, but...
It seemed pretty stupid now that they had just kissed, but that hadn't been Deans original intention when he wet in here. Cas still turned around and looked at him through the mirror as if to say that he could tell him anything. Well, he probably didn't know the stigma spun around the last spoken sentence, which was probably good.
“Nothing she could have said or found out would be something supernatural, that the baby couldn’t deal with.” It all made sense now. The angel hadn’t insisted on taking Glynn to the doctor to confirm the right position of the little girl; he had done it to reassure her and calm her down. And probably to allow her to see the baby a last time.
The big package held a bathing tube and diaper changing mat they didn’t have time to buy yet. They made Glynn take off the wrapping paper, but Dean was still excited since it felt like the Christmas they never celebrated. When it came up in a few months they should really make a feast out of it, no child should grow up without traditions like that.
“Dean,” a gravely voice next to him interrupted the hunter. “What if this guy had the intention to harm Glynn that night, or at least it looked like that. The child could have wanted to protect her.” That made more sense than Dean wanted to admit.
And Dean was lost. He had never seen eyes this blue, this energetic and this sorrowful at the same time. He smiled a shy smile, and Dean forgot his name.
“Dean,” Jo’s voice startled him out of his thoughts. “Relax,” she said with a calmness that was so typical for her. She would probably even peacefully go into death, possibly giving her life for others if the chance was given to her.
Right in time for Dean to hear Jo asking: “And what about Mrs. Novak? I haven’t seen her around yet.” He couldn’t leave his family alone for one second. They would let everything crash around them and Cas would probably never talk to him after this evening.
In the third week of February then, the letter arrived.
"But it is for you?" the alpha suddenly roared, having jumped over to Dean, lifting him by the collar. "You were dragged into this against your will by your father. Do you really think you deserve this?" He looked like a raging angel like this, Dean thought as he searched for an answer in those deep blue orbits. Every fibre of him told him to submit, but he couldn't, that just wasn't him.
Dean sat upright in the bed, started to load his gun with silver bullets from his duffle bag and spoke loud enough to wake Mary. “They’re probably coming for mom. And they’re gonna be here soon, so Cas is taking Sky out back, and you should gear up.”
“Sure, spit it out,” Sam said calmly and Dean could hear a smile in his voice.
"You should at least talk to him," his brother voiced after some time of silence. "Since he already knows part of your big, bad secret, and is still willing to have a conversation, you should probably hear him out."
When they emerged from the bathroom, Sam pointedly didn't look up from the surveillance footage he was watching on his laptop. Skylar had fallen asleep in the middle of the younger hunters bed, and Dean picked her up to put her in the middle of his and Cas.
Dean in this story really likes to have a definition for his sexuality, doesn't he.
“That’s actually a long story”, Dean said at the same time the angel said, “Dean and I.” Mary’s eyes would probably touch the ceiling soon.
"How do you know him?" Cas asked and it was not more than a whisper.
The others came back about twenty minutes later, which the older Winchester had spent on the edge of his seat. Everybody, who had been approaching Baby only in the slightest had been stared down until they fled.
Cas rang the doorbell, and they stood there for a moment, looking at each other. Then the door was being unlocked and the moment a huge amount of dark hair and two brown eyes came into sight, Dean knew why the name had been so familiar to him.
"Dean," Castiel said unnecessarily because of course, the addressed had smelled him already. The fresh air outside thinned the scent at least a little bit out, and Dean decided to ignore the other in favour of getting to his car.
As the older Winchester with the help of his brother tried to rub the blood and other dried fluids of her though, he didn’t seem able to work fast enough, due to the fact, that she was so tiny and fragile and he didn’t want to break her. They still managed to get most of the dirt off her and as soon as she was dry, Dean wrapped her in a diaper with the help of his brother like a pro.
“Well, the record this guy gave me, or maybe I took it without asking, but I didn’t understand the human concept that well back then-“
“Dean,” a very blond almost-not-teenage-girl-anymore grinned, probably having followed her “dad’s” gaze towards the hunter. She hugged him as he approached, what was followed by greetings of Jody and Alex respectively.
"Dean." He could hear his brother trying to figure out what he was up to but then giving up with a sigh. "Without the claim, the heats and ruts apparently get unbearable, no matter if the other is alive. Actually one of the two cases ended that way because the alpha was executed before they could mate."
The first time it had happened like this, they had been in the middle of a research for a possible angel related sighting a few towns over. Sam, without looking up from his laptop, had asked a kind of long question about leaving traces of grace on humans or animals and Dean had registered very fast, that this was directed to Cas. So, he told the angel to open his ears, if he didn’t want to piss of Sam.
“It’s not the way you think,” Cas said, looking down on his shoes now. If it wasn’t for his mental fight right now, Dean would have thought he looked adorable. “I didn’t want to tell you, to not make you think less of me.” The word ‘impossible’ crossed Dean’s mind at that. “But it is my fault, that she is sick.”
He needed to get away from this intoxicating scent. He needed to think.
“You don’t know what it means,” the blue-eyed guy stated as Dean tried to turn around and kept him in place with this intense stare of his.
He knew he was being mean. He knew he kept being mean to keep the angel at a distance that was supposed to keep them both save. And hell, it didn’t work.
Four hours later, the kitchen of Dean and Cas’ lakehouse looks like it was ravaged by a hurricane of particularly unskilled culinary proportions. A collection of bowls filled with various unidentifiable mixtures line every available workspace and globs of butter lie in places as unreasonable as the kitchen window and as unlikely as the ceiling. Dean steps back from his creation, eggshells cracking like tiny spines beneath his boots. He examines his work from every angle, smiling at it like Doctor Frankenstein in awe of his creation.
“Yeah, it does. Dude.”
Cas smiles softly and runs his hands over the thickly woven material as he peers at Dean. “
Steve begins the pat down, his hands moving quickly but thoroughly along Dean’s arm, legs, waist, and chest. Cas is staring daggers from the across the way, and somehow, making Dean feel like he’s just been caught cheating.
“Uh, yeah?”
“Cas?”
“Huh?”
Cas is silent for a long moment but when he does find his voice it comes out wrapped in enough love and appreciation to last Dean a lifetime. “You made this for me?”
Dean can feel a fond smile cross his own face as his tongue finally unties itself. “He is, but he doesn’t always see that. He’s a huge dork about nature, bees especially. So, uh, I thought some flowers might make him happy.”
“Cas, what you did back there-”
“Oh, Dean.”
Dean nods and manages to muster up a tiny smile despite the churning in his stomach. This is good. She's starting to relax, to let her guard down. "And how's business? I heard that places like this aren't as popular as they used to be."
Cas feels his eyes sliding to the floor as he motions with his good hand. "For this. I've barely been human a week and I'm already causing problems."
Dean shuffles on the spot, clears his throat and continues. “And there’s one more thing I hate about this place that isn’t on the list.” He folds the paper and stuffs it into his back pocket. He looks at Cas and his eyes are searching, waiting for Cas to tell him to stop talking, to tell him to shut up. Cas stares back at him with every ounce of love and affection in his tender heart and waits for him to keep going.
"And I would love to discuss that with you in detail and listen to whatever terms you'd like to submit for my consideration, but I know you're only doing this to delay us."
His eyes slide closed, the evening sun warming every part of him as he lies on a towel beneath a cloudless sky. A contended smile takes up residence on his face as he digs his feet into the sand for what must be the millionth time. He still can’t believe that this is real. That he’s actually lying on a beach in Honolulu with Cas by his side. And they’re safe. There’s no end of the world, no sacrificing themselves for the greater good, no more goodbyes, no more regrets, no more maybes. He feels for the first time in his life like he can rest, really truly rest. The relief of that is so powerful as the pain and trauma of all those years of sadness slips from his shoulders and melts into the sand that before he can process what’s happening, he suddenly finds himself crying. A steady stream of quiet tears sliding down his cheeks and falling away into the golden sand.
Dean flips open the glove compartment clumsily with his left hand, his right still holding on to Cas' wrist.
He thinks about that night. The one that changed his life forever. A night when he had no faith, when he didn’t believe in Cas, when he couldn’t believe in anything that good. Looking at him now, smiling and filled with enough love to build universes, Dean is happy he was wrong.
“One.” A breath. “Two.” A bizarre feeling of panic flashing through Cas. “Three.”
Cas nods in agreement. “They are headache-inducing.”
"Sir?"
Agatha raises a curious eyebrow but says nothing. “Well, how about a nice bouquet? That way you can choose a mix of flowers you think he’ll like.”
blanket?”
Dean lets himself experience the familiar wave of love and affection he’s still trying to let himself believe he deserves wash over him. “You’re not supposed to... never mind. Blow out the candles.”
“Thank you, Dean. I love it.” And Cas is smiling at him, and he’s still so intoxicatingly close. Dean could do something about that, if he was brave enough. Is he brave enough? “Ready for our walk?” Cas asks him, and Dean nods and loosens his grip on the scarf, but he doesn’t let go. Instead, he pulls Cas closer and plants a gentle kiss on his left cheek. Maybe he’s not brave, but maybe he’s not a coward either. He feels his heart stutter as he releases the scarf and climbs from the bed. By the time he reaches the door he’s already got a million reasons why that was perfectly normal best friend behavior. Don’t Europeans do that all the time?
Cas has the audacity to look embarrassed as he averts his eyes and Dean feels a fresh spark of affection flash through him. “I was, uh, crocheting.”
“Sorry? For what?”
Agatha was right, he does miss him already.
After greeting a few angel that were passing at the moment, Cas teleports him back to earth, back to his and Deans home, only to see the older Winchester fast asleep on their bed, Miracle cuddled up next to him.
“I’ve always liked you more than friends Cas, especially since you first saved me from becoming Michaels’ Vessel. I’ve fell in love with you when you decided that free will was what you’ve wanted, what you deserve, that you aren’t just a toy to be played with.”
“Hey Jack, Sam and Eileen are going to be parents.” Cas says, smiling brightly. “Oh, that’s nice, I’m happy for them” Jack answers, watching his dad smiling and being happy. “
“Ok, I’ll be there as soon as we finish bringing all the furniture into the house.”
“I’ve got Cas back, and you’ve got Eileen, fair I’d say, and now leave us alone, please” Dean yells back, Sam understanding every word of it.
After Deans’ confession, Cas slowly leans in, coming closer to Deans face without breaking the eye contact.
Cas walks up to the nephilim, putting his hand on one of his shoulders, like he used to do with Dean when he needed to be calmed down.
“I’ve got to tell Cas the news, let’s meet up in a few weeks, we haven’t seen each other in quite some time.”
Dean looks up into the sky, starting to smile “That is awesome Cas, I love it! Not as much as you, but I love it” Dean nearly screams, then pulling Cas in for a short kiss.
“Is there anything else you need help with or is that everything?” Jack smiles, shaking his head no. Cas decides to tell him about the happy news Dean told him.
“Oh yes, I would like that” Gabe says, exited. Dean intervenes.
“That’s not nice to say” Gabriel whispers to himself. “Why- Why is her tummy so big?” Gabe asks Sam, being very confused and tilting his head.
She smiles, and signs Sam that she thinks that Gabriel is adorable. “What did you do with your hands?” Sam is asked after Gabe saw Eileen signing.
Cas responds, while bringing in a few more boxes full of clothing.
Dean lays his hands on Cas’s hips, their bodies coming even closer than they were before, while closing his eyes.
Dean needs a moment to process, after he has realized what just happened, he begins crying tears of joy.
Ok, I have to go now, Dean’s taking me out for dinner, if you have any questions relating angels or creating ask via Angel Radio, ok?” Cas says before vanishing and appearing next to Dean, who’s on his way home.
Cas takes a look at the display at the bed. “Uh, Dean, his name is Gabriel” Cas smiles, but being at the edge to cry, because it’s then when realisation hits again, remembering him of his favourite archangel brother, who sacrificed his life three years ago to save them.
“Jack, do you have like 5 more minutes to spare? I’m moving with Dean and I told you to not disturb me if it isn’t important.
He’s kissing Cas with a smile on his lips, and he feels that Cas is smiling too. Both are incredibly happy and start crying tears of joy, breaking apart while still hugging one another and crying into each others shoulder.
“Come here honey” Cas smiles, while walking up to Dean. He kisses him, first soft and innocent, then more passionate. They’re both the way in love they’ve been on the day they confessed their love to each other.
Both are interrupted in their reunion moment by Sam knocking on the door. “Dean, is everything alright?” Sam asks concerned.
“Thank you Dean, thank you from the bottom of my heart. If I only had known earlier, I wouldn’t have been so harsh with you, every time you resurrected me, or made something stupid I yelled at you for. Thank you.”
“Jack, I’m sorry that I’ve always been that harsh to you, even though you did nothing wrong, I just wasn’t able to deal with the fact that Lucifers kid isn’t as bad as his dad” Dean says, smiling and standing up to pull Jack in a hug. “Thank you for pulling Cas out of the empty, thank you for bringing Eileen back, after your grandpa erased all live on earth.”
This is not the end of their story.
“Excellent.” Agatha moves back behind the counter and begins to arrange the flowers in a sheet of brown paper, her hands little more than a blur as she snips and folds and rolls.
Dean laughs and rolls his eyes and loves Cas a little bit more. “Yeah, because that wouldn’t be weird at all.” He nudges him gently with his shoulder. “Cas, it’s perfect. Thank you.”
“Because-”
Cas shrugs and looks away. “Your knees get cold.”
He starts to pace.
Before he can figure out what to do next a wave of nausea passes over him so abruptly that he barely makes it to the vase in the corner before he and the contents of his stomach part ways. He wipes his mouth on his shirt sleeve as a violent shiver shakes through his body and his legs buckle beneath him. Cas catches his arm before he can collapse and guides him gently to the nearest chair.
Dean freezes in place, his gaze flicking up to meet Cas’, and in the strength of that endless gaze, it feels, not for the first time, like he’s drowning, blissfully and without regret.
“Wait.” He doesn’t want him to go. When does he ever? Cas glances at his hand on his arm and then at Dean. “Why did you come in here?”
“Why?”
So Dean smiles back, of course he smiles back. And as he does, an ancient weight lifts itself from his chest and his breathing comes easier than it has in years.
He lifts his watch to his ear and listens. Nothing. It’s evidently picked this ideal moment to stop working, because of course it has.
Cas turns his head to see Sam approaching in the distance and sighs. Time to hang up. He pictures Dean in his soft dressing gown, his hair spiked up in all directions and he desperately longs to be back home. “So, I guess I’ll talk to you at the bunker?”
Dean smiles and shrugs his shoulders in reluctant agreement.
Dean shuffles slowly down the hallway, sleep coated like rust on his tired joints. He rubs at his eyes again, glancing at his watch in the dimly lit passageway. Almost 4am. A sigh escapes into the silence before another yawn stretches from his mouth. Insomnia strikes again. Maybe a warm cup of milk will help. It never has before, but hey, there’s a first time for everything.
Cas holds the tape in his hands like it’s the most precious and expensive diamond in the whole world. No, not a diamond. A diamond would dull and wither in comparison to this. Dean made this. Dean made this for him. He doesn’t even like pop music but he made this for Cas. His hearts swells and aches with the love he feels for him, powerful enough in this moment to make him feel breathless.
Dean wants to disagree but he can't. That’s exactly what he’s doing. Dean and airplanes. Airplanes and Dean. They just don't mix. He looks at the glass entry door again and wonders why he agreed to this. Then he looks at Cas, and oh yeah, he knows exactly why.
Agatha smiles and winks at him as she completes the final touches on the bouquet. “How about a ribbon?”
Harold offers an unhelpful sigh as Cas leans across him.
He lets go of his hand and Cas swears he can feel the kiss radiating through his skin, seeping into his veins like ink.
“Because-” But he can’t stop. Not this time. Not until he wins this fight. Not until Cas understands.
Dean waves him away and rises from his seat, his heart skipping a few beats as he moves closer to Cas. He leans against the edge of the table and holds his hands out towards him. “I’ve never been one to turn down free stuff. Give it here, sunshine.”
A soft chuckle slides down the line and settles against his heart. “Yeah, buddy, I missed you too.”
“Yeah, buddy, go ahead,” Dean replies, wondering why he’s bothering them at all. He’s tempted to add a snide comment but he bites his tongue, aware that they and this stranger will, unfortunately, be sharing the same space for the next few hours.
“Good.”
“So, you’re not upset?”
“Okie dokey,” he says, bouncing energetically on the balls of his feet. “Can you step to you left and spread your arms out, sir?”
“What? Oh, uh, no.”
"Give it here."
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Cas is sitting up now, his sunglasses pushed up onto his forehead and his hands resting on Dean’s chest, a grounding force as always.
Dean’s arm flies across the row to clamp a hand across Cas’ mouth. “Do not finish that sentence!” He can see by the mischievous sparkle in Cas’ eyes that he knows exactly what he’s saying.
Cas did it again.
Maybe this is too much for him to handle.
Dean clears his throat and ceremoniously unfolds the paper in his hands. “Ok. Here we go. The five things I hate about this lakehouse.” His eyes flick back to Cas, who meets his gaze curiously but remains silent.
Cas feels himself nodding encouragingly even though Dean can’t see it. “Sam was wearing glasses too, and he had his hair tied up in a horsetail.”
He sits beside him and Dean knows he’s saying something but he can’t hear any of it. It’s like a grenade just exploded inside his brain and every circuit is crying out in confusion as the whole place burns to the ground. Cas places his hand gently on Dean’s back and even though he can’t hear a single word he’s saying, he can feel the circles he’s rubbing there in gentle repetition.
“I didn’t tell anyone. Even Sam doesn’t know how bad it got. I just felt so lost. Like I was drifting out to sea, and I didn’t have anything to hold on to.”
It’s 8am (still?) and Dean is sick to death of the airport.
Cas peers at him earnestly. “It did.”
“Thank you, Dean.”
Dean keeps his fingers wrapped tightly around Cas’ wrist, knowing he could easily break free but hoping that he won’t. “Can’t you just, y’know, heal me?”
“Finally snapped out of whatever that was,” he gestures between them with an air of disinterest. “Can you let me sit down now?”
“I-” Cas tilts his head, glancing between the wound and Dean’s face, trying to understand. “I’ll heal you, but I need to at least see the wound first. It’s important to know what we’re dealing with in case it happens again and I’m not here.”
Who knew tattoo shops could be so romantic?
“Am I so awesome?” Dean interjects. “Well, that would take years to explain. But, look, September 18th", he shrugs “seems like as good a day as any for a gift.”
“It’s...it’s a blanket.” If Dean didn’t know any better, he would swear that Cas’ face is turning its own subtle shade of crimson. But that’s not possible, right?
He feels fingers tracing lightly over his skin as Dean turns his hand gently from side to side, bringing it closer to inspect the severity of his shame. He shifts in the seat beside Cas, the black leather squeaking under his weight as he leans forward. Suddenly close to Cas. Too close. Close enough to-
Stop it, he tells himself. Stop it, before it’s too late.
Instantly, the smile falters on Cas’ face as his stomach drop and his heart skips a beat. There’s a breath of silence on the other side before Dean clears his throat and barrels on.
Cas reaches his hand up to hold Dean’s as he lets his head rest lightly on his shoulder. “Thank you, Dean, for everything. You really are the most loving man on earth.”
As if hearing his thoughts, Dean finally finds what he's looking for and settles back against the worn leather. "Your first real injury, Cas. This is a big day." He swivels around to face Cas, tucking his right leg beneath him, and placing the tin on the seat, worn metal reflecting sparks of sunlight. Cas remains silent as Dean places his hand palm side up on his knee and opens the tin. He gently wipes the wound clean, his fingers working with the pained knowledge of a hunter’s life. Cas watches him as he works, feeling his heart hammering against his chest like it’s desperately searching for a way out. He watches the way his brow knits together in concentration. He watches the way he places the stitches in an orderly row, like tiny soldiers under his command. He watches his eyelashes as he blinks, their shadows casting dark lines beneath his downturned eyes.
Cas nods, his eyes filled with an odd mix of compassion and confusion. “I’m sorry.”
Agatha stares back at him in silence. She blinks twice, and then a smile bright enough to power a solar house for a lifetime lights up her features. “He sounds wonderful.”
Cas takes a step forward, a spark of anger flashing in his own eyes. “I did exactly what you and Sam have done a hundred times before.”
“Actually, it is.” Harold points to the window and Dean turns to see the lines of the runway beginning to disappear beneath them as the plane picks up speed. His heart starts hammering in his chest. This is it. No turning back now. The engines blast loudly as the plane hurtles down the runway. Oh crap, this is happening. He feels himself pushed back into his seat as the wheels leave the ground and the plane tilts upwards. He tries to look at Cas but Harold is in his line of vision and both his nerves and the belt tight across his lap are preventing him from leaning forward as the plane continues to rise. Suddenly, a hand shoots across Harold’s body, a familiar hand, welcoming and strong. Cas’ hand. He hesitates for a moment, feeling silly for wanting to grab it. He’s a grown man on a mundane, everyday flight. He’s not a baby. Harold is frowning at the hand in his space. The plane jostles and dips for a second and Dean’s resolve melts away as his hand shoots out reflexively for Cas, their fingers lacing together with easy familiarity.
The elderly woman is still frowning at him from across the room. He hates the judgement behind those eyes. Or it it fear? If he could stop acting like a scared child for long enough to talk to her, maybe he could find out.
An elbow connects with his back as the teenager behind him urges him to move along. It’s not the first elbow to connect with his back in the last ten minutes and he’s sure it won’t be the last. He’s beginning to wonder if only the first fifty people seated get to stay in the plane and the rest have to ride on the exterior wings. He mumbles an Enochian profanity taught to him by Cas and shuffles further down the aisle.
Agatha looks at Dean and then at the yellow spadix protruding from the middle of the flowers, and then back at Dean again. “If you say so, honey." She stoops and picks up a handful of pink flowers that Dean thinks he actually knows the name of.
It’s perfectly imperfect.
“When I saved your life you mean?”
Cas wanders over to the car to wait for Sam who is still busy consoling the residents of Charming Acres. He reaches for the handle on the passenger side before remembering that Sam also has the keys. He could go back, but he doesn’t want to explain to yet another shocked individual how a man was using the power of his brain to keep them all trapped in a town suspended in time, decades behind the rest of the world. Nope, that’s definitely Sam’s department.
Dean doesn’t know long they sit like that, just the two of them, but he does know that the longer Cas rubs his back, the better he feels.
Cas is sitting on the couch in front of the blank television, encased in a comical amount of sunny bright yarn. His legs have disappeared completely beneath the mess and it looks like his torso is soon to follow. Dean can’t see his face properly from his frozen spot at the door, but what he can see is the glint of a small hook held in Cas’ right hand which he is expertly moving through the yarn as he mutters to himself.
He moves forward, closing the gap between them in three quick strides, and rests his hands on the worn oak counter. He tries to appear relaxed, unassuming, normal. He feels like an ant trapped under a magnifying glass.
Cas gazes out the passenger window, watching the countless empty fields roll past. An earthy breeze pushes through the gap at the top, fresh, and ordinary, and wonderful. Cas rolls the window down further and tilts his head into the wind.
The sound of a mountain cracking and breaking apart cuts through the spell, causing Dean to blink and reluctantly drag his eyes away from Cas. Standing in the aisle is a man, a human man, and the noise Dean in his trance-like state interpreted as a mountain, was him loudly clearing his throat. He is dressed in a smart pinstripe suit, with short cropped silver hair, roughly in his fifties and with a wiry frame.  He’s leaning into their row, his brow knitted together in annoyance as he gives off the self-important air of a man for whom the world moves too slowly.
can’t do that. He swats the thoughts away like mosquitos and tries to remember what Dean asked him. “He, uh, looked extremely nerdy. You would’ve enjoyed it.”
“It’s...it’s fine.”
“Try it again,” Cas’ reassuring lilt echoes from behind him.
“Oh, for God's sake! Can you move your arm from across my chest?” Harold’s voice cuts in.
Cas happily stays right there, with Dean, together in the home they’ve made, until the sun starts to dip and the stars wake from their slumber. And when they finally untangle themselves, and Dean reaches out for his hand, Cas takes it gladly, willing to follow him anywhere. Into any adventure. On any journey.
“Yeah. I made it for you.”
Dean redirects his gaze from the sky above to see a woman in a sundress glaring pointedly at the case she narrowly avoided tumbling over. “Sorry,” he calls after her as he pulls his luggage quickly to his side, the plastic frame knocking sharply into his right leg. “I don’t know why they make these things so complicated with all these dumb little wheels,” he mumbles to himself distractedly. Sighing, he shifts the bulky green duffel bag from one shoulder to the other, glancing again at the dark clouds ominously obscuring the sun.
His words are cut off by the sound of Dean’s laughter. Loud, and happy, and free. “Did you see that? It was like a stack of pancakes crossed with a stack of dominos!" He slaps at his knee gleefully as the laughter rocks his shoulders up and down. "Man, I wish I’d been filming that.”
Cas is still standing in front of him, hands by his sides, eyes aflame. “No, Dean. I wasn’t wrong and I’m not sorry. I’d do it again, all of it, a million times over.”
Now it’s just him and Cas, alone in the library. Just him and the angel, and this anger crawling up his spine like a parasite. A living thing, feeding off his emotions, pulsing through his body in waves. Pounding against his aching skull.
Dean feels his eyes widen. “What? No! Cas, of course I trust you; I trust you with my life.” He sighs and closes his eyes. “Look, I have my reasons, okay?”
It’s not easy.
“Did you remember to put all your liquids in separate bags?”
Dean opens his eyes again, his senses still on high alert. He mentally calculates how many weapons he currently has strapped to his body. Four guns, two blades.
For as long as Cas will hear it.
“Betsy?”
“No, leave it.”
“Number one. I hate how cold it gets in the winter and I hate how you hog all of our blankets.” Cas is about to interrupt with a protest when Dean looks up to smile at him and suddenly every word dissolves in the wake of the love he feels for him. “I hate it because it makes it unbearable to untangle myself from you every morning, even if it’s just to go make us coffee.” Cas feels the butterflies he tried to ignore for years fluttering freely in his stomach as a fond smile crosses his face. Dean’s eyes flick back to the paper. “Number two. The chickens.” His words are perfectly punctuated with a cluck from outside that makes both of them laugh. “I hate that we’ve become weird chicken people, and I hate that I don’t hate it at all. I do think those chickens understand more than they’re letting on though”.
He glances up at the sky again, just in time to see a shooting star jetting across the inky night. He closes his eyes and makes a wish, fueled by the secret desires held in his heart.
Cas opens his eyes, surprised by the movement and his sudden proximity to Dean, and for a moment he just stares at him, his bright blue eyes blinking slowly. Eyes Dean could stare into for hours. Eyes he could easily get lost in. They’re so dangerously close now that Dean can feel Cas’ breath on his face. He feels himself swallow as he holds the end of the scarf up between them. “Uh, this is for you.”
“That sounds nice.” And it does sound nice. In fact, it sounds perfect. He just wishes he was already there. He wishes he could still fly.
A few more seconds of silence pass before the line goes dead. Cas pulls the phone slowly away from his ear and tries to resist the temptation to hit redial.
“Anytime.”
“Yeah, well, it’s not your fault. But I’m not gonna lie, it was bad. I was drunk most days and every night, and I was just so angry all the time. One of those nights got especially bad, and suddenly I found myself talking to you.”
He tries to laugh but it comes out as a bark so sharp it causes both of them to jump. He knows he’s blowing this but he can’t seem to wrangle it back from the edge it’s galloping towards. "Sorry. No, not a cop. I'm just kinda stressed out and it’s making me jumpy."
And maybe this time, he needs more than words.
She looks back at him with such gentleness and understanding in her eyes that Dean has the most bizarre urge to hug her. “Yes, I know exactly what you mean. I’ve been married for three years and everyday that I wake up with my wife by my side, I feel blessed.”
He opens the door and risks one quick look back at Cas who is still sitting on the bed. He’s perfectly still, and maybe he has one hand resting lightly on the spot where Dean placed his lips, and maybe he doesn’t.
Reluctantly tearing his eyes away, Cas unties the ribbon and gently opens the box. Inside, on a bed of blue tissue paper lies another mixtape. Cas lifts it out, reading the words scrawled across the white label aloud. “Cas’ top 13 pop traxx,” he reads, his voice clogged with emotions. He follows the loops and twists of Dean’s words across the white surface, ending with a tiny wobbly heart scribbled beside it, and feels a tsunami of affection rush through him.
The bell above the door chimes as Dean pushes it open with an unsteady hand. He winces and looks over his shoulder, expecting something or someone to be hot on his tail. The street beyond is calm and suburban and completely free of any visible danger. He sighs and takes a deep breath, closing his eyes for a moment to steady himself.
“When we get there,” Cas says, gently tugging at his chin and tilting Dean’s worried eyes away from the window. “A little too late for lunch but a little too early for dinner, so what should we do?”
"I'm sorry," Cas blurts out.
She nods politely and disappears.
“You don’t trust me?”
He shakes his head, like maybe he can knock the thought loose. “Okay.”
They cling to each other, as the seconds tick by, and then the minutes, maybe even the years. Cas doesn’t know and he doesn’t care.
The soft smile that Cas flashes him in reply makes Dean want to wrap his arms around him and never let go. He shakes the thought from his head and digs into the parcel, gently pulling apart the layers of paper and tape, and expertly avoiding the gum. As he clears away the debris, something falls from the parcel and lands on the ground. He stoops to pick it up and a wave of emotion washes over him so suddenly he feels breathless. He straightens and looks at the item in his hands. For a long moment all he can do is stare at the gift Cas gave him. The thing Cas picked out, just for him. Just because he felt like it.
Cas searches his mind for something else to say, anything that will make Dean laugh again. He screws his eyes shut tight and tries to focus. Bingo! “Hey, uh, there’s something else too.”
He promised Cas they'd have a proper holiday when they came back from the empty, somehow miraculously alive, somehow together. And he kissed him, long and hard, and still covered in stinking black goo. And then he asked him to marry him, the words and promises stuttering out among the sobs. He would have promised Cas the sun, and the moon, and the stars, if he asked him to. Thinking of it now, and the airborne deathtrap he's about to willingly enter, he kind of wishes Cas did want the sun. It seems a lot easier to wrangle that from the sky right now then take the five steps to the doors of the airport.
They drove home in dead silence after the hunt, Dean’s knuckles standing out a brilliant white against each passing streetlight. Back at the bunker, Sam disappeared from sight, too exhausted to referee another of their arguments.
“You took a stupid risk.” Back and forth Dean paces, his feet following an invisible path on the hardwood floor, his anger rattling through his bones like a second heartbeat.
It is him.
Instead, Cas moves to the front of the car and leans back against the hood, his hand digging instinctively in the pocket of his trenchcoat for his phone. He unlocks it, scrolls through his short contact list, presses the call button beside Dean’s name and waits. It doesn’t even reach the second ring before his voice pipes through, instantly dissolving the distance between them. “Cas? Everything alright?” His voice is warm and gentle and Cas feels a familiar stirring in the pit of his stomach. Why are emotions so confusing?
“Yeah.” Dean nods and it feels like his mouth is made of cotton. “It didn’t stop the hurt, not even close. But it helped a little. Like, I dunno, like I was carrying a piece of you with me. Like you were still here, watching over me, protecting me.”
“I was drunk.” As soon as he says it, he knows it was a mistake.
“Alright, Cas. I need to say something.”
Dean pulls his duvet up towards his chest and raises an eyebrow at Cas. “Dude?”
Cas rolls his eyes over Dean’s shoulder, his chin resting on the crook of his neck. “Of course its a yes, dumbass. It’s like you told me, Dean. We’re better together. We just are.”
Dean’s response is immediate, like second nature. “Nah, I’ll wait for you.” A pause. “I can make us some drinks.”
“Yep, that’s what we call the detector over there. Or, at least, I do anyway.”
“Not all of us.”
“Cas?”
“You’re bleeding, Dean.”
Cas can feel tears prickling at the backs of his eyes but he swallows and forces them away. “What else do you hate?”
“Woah, buddy, how about giving a guy a little warning before you do that?” A laugh escapes from his lips as Dean wraps his arms tightly around Cas, his hold making Cas’ heart stutter.
“Yeah, I, uh, thought you might like them.” He looks at Cas, his eyes pricking with tears. He looks back at the novelty socks and the little pizza slices embroidered into the fabric. “I know how much you love your hotdog pajamas and I thought-” Cas’ voice catches suddenly in his throat, doubt sneaking into his words. “I saw these at the store and they made me think of you,” he finishes quickly.
Dean glances at him again, his eyes reading the doubt painted across Cas’ face and softening immediately. “Oh, man, it’s not about the tape. I love the tape. I wouldn’t have made it for you if I didn’t.” The thought makes Cas’ heart flutter ridiculously in his chest. “I just thought that we could listen to something else.” Cas nods slowly and removes his hand from his pocket as Dean tilts to his right and begins to dig in his own. “Hang on a second, I’ve got something here.”
He takes a deep breath, scans it, and hallelujah! the gate slides open. He breathes a sigh of relief and joins the security queue. Cas scans his own tickets and appears beside him, his hand resting gently on Dean’s arm once more. They reach the front of the queue and a burly, tired looking man in a security uniform motions to the conveyor belt. “Bags on the belt, liquids in the box, shoes, belts, and anything metal in another box. Do not make me repeat myself people, it’s not that complicated.”
“Because I love you”
“Tired?”
Cas feels a smile tug at the corners of his mouth as a memory flashes before his eyes. A barn, shattering lightbulbs, a dagger to his chest.
Dean bites back several sarcastic comments in favour of a slight nod of his head.
“Nah, I got it.”
“Oh, dude,” Dean wheezes, “I hope you took a picture.”
Dean leans forward shyly and takes a cautious sniff. “Yeah, I like those. Put some of those in.”
“C’mere.”
"That's cus most of ‘em are dead," she responds, her tone giving nothing away. "What are your questions?"
Good things do happen.
Dean feels his mouth flapping open and closed like a fish as he tries to decide how to react to that sentiment. He finally decides on outrage and gasps theatrically as he clutches a hand to his chest. “How dare you! And in the DeanCave, no less. I thought you liked Tv? You always seem to have fun at our movie nights.”
Dean tries really hard not to roll his eyes but only manages a thirty percent success rate. He glances at Cas who is still firmly seated in his place. “Dude, does it really matter?”
Agatha gestures at him to continue, suspicion still tugging at her features. Dean leans an elbow on the counter in an attempt to appear nonchalant. Start off with a simple question. Make it easy on both of them. "How long have you worked here?"
Cas tilts his head in that old familiar way that makes Dean rolls his eyes even as his heart stutters. “It’s to make up for all the birthdays I should have been celebrating with you since we met. A layer for every year we missed out on.” He gestures to the blue icing beginning to run down the side of the cake. “Now, blow out the candles before we have another mess to clean up.” Cas smiles and leans forward but Dean pushes a hand against his chest before he can draw a breath. “Woah! You need to come up with a wish first.”
He shakes his head and digs beneath the duvet for what he stashed there earlier. Taking a short breath to steady himself, and before he can talk himself out of it, Dean yanks a crochet scarf from beneath the duvet and throws it around Cas’ neck, pulling him closer as he does. Which is a complete accident, of course.
“Dean-”
“How about some music?” Dean suggests, his words breaking the spell and reminding Cas that he should at least try to act normal around him. He drags his eyes away and reaches instinctively into the inside pocket of his trenchcoat, his fingers closing gently around his Led Zeppelin mixtape. Always with him, safely tucked against his heart.
“Alright, Number three, brace yourself.” Dean takes a deep breath before he continues. “I hate the little knick-knacks you pick up at the thrift store in town.” He motions to the leg shaped lamp beside Cas, the novelty egg cups on the coffee table, and the melting clock fixed above the fireplace. Cas is already opening his mouth to defend his coveted treasures when Dean waves him away. “I hate them because of how much joy they bring you and because I wish I’d found them first. I hate them because I want every soft smile to be for me alone. And I hate them because, as dumb as I know this is, I’m jealous of their ability to make you happy.”
“Why don’t you watch Tv?”
Cas feels a spark of warmth and affection so strong and so true that for a moment he almost tells Dean the truth.
Dean does as Steve asks, a feeling of dread now swimming in the nauseous waters of his stomach.
“Just don’t-”
“And when I came back? Why did you keep it?”
“Yeah?”
Dean scratches the back of his neck and shifts uneasily on the spot. “Uh, I don’t really know.”
Cas nods again and reaches for the tattoo, his fingers tracing the letters, slower this time. He deliberately follows the loops and turns across Dean’s skin as Dean sighs and closes his eyes contentedly.
“I appreciate the help. I’m completely lost when it comes to all this mushy stuff. I mean, I did make him a mixtape once but it wasn’t sappy or anything. Led Zeppelin tracks...well love songs mostly, and I wrote a couple of kisses on the label.” Dean rubs at his neck again. “It was nothing romantic though. At least, Cas didn’t seem to think so. But then again, that little dude’s never been great at social cues.” Why the hell is it so warm in this place? And why the hell can’t he seem to shut up?
He finally found the words. He finally said it.
Cas offers Dean one of his classic eyerolls as he walks towards him. “Clearly you don’t. Besides, I’m practically a superhero.” He pauses to lifts both of his arms into the air in mock flight. “I’m like the incredible hunk.”
This is their mess, in their home, on his angel’s birthday. The thought repeats itself in his head like a mantra. This is Dean’s life with Cas, sometimes messy, but always coming from a place of love.
“Uh, not that,” Dean says quickly, his eyes flicking between Cas’ face and the road. Cas feels his hand still as a flicker of doubt flashes through him. Is Dean sick of the mixtape? What about all the highways they flew down, the tape blaring and their voices joined together in pitchy unison? Was he just humoring Cas on the long drives when he would smile and let the tape play all the way through before flipping it over and starting it again. A final, heavy thought settles like a dull stone in the pit of his stomach. Does Dean regret giving him the mixtape?
Cas motions to the letters “And you got that?”
A TSA agent starts towards him and Dean can feel beads of sweat beginning to prickle on his forehead. No, he thinks to himself, I went over it a million times, I don’t have anything on me.
Cas nods and smiles “Yes. I will.”
He looks back at the recipe book he picked up at their local thrift store to see if it can offer any guidance. A beautiful, artistically photographed cake stares back at him smugly, but offers no assistance. He shrugs, picks up the bag of flour to his right, and begins to pour. By the time all three cups are full there’s at least half a bag of flour scattered on the floor and counter and Dean’s hands are caked in white powder. “Huh. This might be a little harder than I thought.”
“I-what?”
They join the noisy group of travelers waiting to scan their boarding cards and go through to security and now Dean is really beginning to feel like a lamb on his way to slaughter. Cas keeps his hand on Dean’s elbow and the warm touch of his fingers makes him feel grounded. In fact, it’s the only thing stopping him from turning tail and running for the exit. He tries to focus on the lingering sensation of his touch as Cas is forced to let go and step back so that Dean can scan his ticket. He holds his boarding card against the scanner, his hand shaking unevenly. The machine echoes a loud beep, the light turns red, and the little glass partition remains closed.
Dean is about to open his mouth with a few choice words of his own when he feels the grip on his knee tighten and Cas’ eyes once more lock on to his. “It’s ok, Dean. I’ll still be right here, just one seat over.” A panicked feeling beings to swirl in the pit of Dean’s stomach. He needs Cas. He can’t do this alone. He takes a deep breath and nods his head, determined not to ruin their holiday over something as silly as seat arrangements. Cas smiles gently and releases his hold on Dean’s knee, its sudden loss causing a cold feeling to seep through the denim of his jeans. He forces himself to smile back as Cas shuffles past Howard, who barely moves out of his way as he squeezes into the seat beside Dean, his arms instantly coming up to position their sharp elbows on the armrests. What a dick, Dean thinks to himself as he sighs and tries to peer around him at Cas.
“I’m fine, really.”
Dean drops the socks and steps forward fast, before his brain can take over. He has just enough time to see a familiar look of confusion cross Cas’ face before their mouths connect. Without a second of hesitation, Cas returns his kiss, so eager and so gentle it makes him want to cry. If Dean wasn’t so preoccupied he’d pinch himself. Cas gave him pizza socks and now they’re kissing? With a monumental effort, Dean switches off his brain and lets every doubt seep from his body as he leans into the kiss.
Cas just squints back at him. “What?” And then his eyes flick to the duvet before widening comically. “Oh, sorry, are you...undressed? I can come back later.” He backs up awkwardly, his head knocking noisily into the closed door and Dean can’t help but smile even as he rolls his eyes.
One day, he thinks to himself, one day he’ll tell Dean Winchester exactly what he means to him.
“Yes, out. On a date. With me. Dinner. Or lunch, it doesn’t have to be dinner.”
Shit.
“C’mon angel,” Dean manages, as the laughter finally subsides amid the stares of their fellow passengers. “Let’s get out of here.”
The agent, his name tag says ‘Steve’, is still smiling as he motions to Dean’s left and waits for him to comply. Dean glances at Cas again who shrugs uneasily. He really can’t catch a break today.
Dean nods dumbly and picks out an ocean blue ribbon that reminds him of the aqua shade of his angel’s eyes. Agatha takes it from him gently and wraps it expertly around the impressive bouquet.
Cas runs his hands slowly along the length of the scarf wrapped around his neck and Dean remembers belatedly that he’s still holding on to either end. He should probably let go. He should definitely let go. He doesn’t let go.
Dean feels his heart rate triple in speed as he waits for the inevitable. Instead, he feels the warm touch of Cas’ fingertips brushing hesitantly against his skin. “It’s...it’s my name.” His voice is low and uneven as he examines what Dean desperately tried to hide. The tattoo. The tattoo of Cas’ name. Spelled out in simple black ink just below his ribcage. Cas traces the letters with his fingers, his touch so gentle and welcome that Dean finds himself holding his breath as he suppresses the shiver trying to make its way down his spine. After what seems like an eternity, Cas looks up to meets Dean’s eyes, his fingers still resting lightly on his skin. “Dean, I don’t understand. You got a tattoo...of my name?”
He waits for something else. Anger, disgust, laughter, but nothing else comes. Only silence. Horrible, empty, awful silence. He swallows around the pebbles in his throat and forces himself to speak.
Cas offers him a shy smile that feels like a punch to his heart. “Thank you, Dean.” He starts to get up but Dean grabs his arm before he can go.
“That does sound excessive.”
Dean laughs, the motion shaking them both, before his voice becomes serious as he asks “Can I take my almost concussion as a yes?”
Shit, Dean thinks. It sounds pretty complicated to him. And what did he say about shoes? On or off? He looks around for guidance and, seeing other barefoot individuals, decides to follow suit, hopping on one foot as he tries to undo the knotted laces of his boots. For the first time in his life, he wishes he had a pair of Velcro strap shoes. Beside him, Cas calmly lifts their luggage on to the belt and digs out their liquid's bags. “Do want me to wait for you?” he asks Dean, hand coming up to steady him as he removes his other shoe.
“Because-” Dean steps forward, anger and frustration pumping through his veins as he says the only words he has left.
Cas rolls his eyes with almost enough strength to beam the image to Dean. “We were a little preoccupied.” He sighs, but he can’t stop the smile that spreads across his face. “Yes, I took a picture.”
“Uh, ha-ha, alright joker!”
Cas leans forward again as Harold sighs again and mutters loudly “this is getting ridiculous.”
"What? I like it."
She hands it proudly to Dean who can feel the tears welling behind his lids “It’s perfect. How much do I owe you?”
Eventually the laughter slows until only a few soft chuckles remain. “Oh, he is never gonna live this one down. I want all the details when you get home.”
Cas tries to fix a serious expression on his face, he really does, but he finds himself distracted by how vulnerable Dean looks. Like a hundred times before, he’s hit with a need to protect him so strong it almost winds him. He wants to get up and wrap his arms around Dean, but he forces himself not to move from his spot. Instead, Cas puts down his paper and arranges the pillows behind his back until he’s sitting up straight on the sofa. He nods towards Dean before folding his hands and placing them neatly in his lap. “My apologies. Go ahead.”
Cas leans forward to peer at Dean intently and suddenly, he can’t seem to focus on anything but the shape of his lips. “You’re still having trouble sleeping?”
Cas’ eyes flick towards Dean. He blinks slowly as remembrance flashes across his face. He nods and examines the wound, his fingers brushing quickly over it. “A shallow cut, it would heal fine if kept clean and bandaged but-” he reaches out and lays his palm across its surface. Dean is hit with the same giddiness he experiences every time Cas heals him. Some people would call it butterflies. Yeah, some people. The pain disappears instantly and Dean actually misses its presence as he opens his eyes again. It’s worse now, with no sharp sting to distract him from a much more prominent discomfort. He reaches up to tug his shirt down but Cas stops him, his left hand closing over Dean’s.
“Ah, I see. He’s a handsome guy, very serious looking though.”
Dean studies them carefully. “I don’t know...the bit in the middle’s a bit...phallic, isn’t it?”
Dean can feel his face redden as he knocks his knee against Cas’. “Shush with all that.”
He’s trapped.
Dean reaches for the blanket, running his fingers along the soft material. Feeling every bump of wool, every motion made by Cas’ deft hands. For him. He pulls it gently across his lap where it lands softly across his knees. It feels like home. An excess of material spills onto the floor and by the looks of it, Cas isn’t stopping anytime soon. Dean feels a familiar lump wedge itself into his throat. “Cas, this is...amazing. I’ve never had anything like this before.”
A few more seconds pass and Cas knows that he should hang up now, but he doesn’t. He waits for Dean to say something else but he seems just as lost for words. He swallows and allows himself a moment of honesty. “Dean?”
Cas looks back at him, his eyes wide, his head tilted.
Cas opens his mouth to protest but before he can say anything, Dean reaches across the impala and gently takes his hand. The stinging line of the cut marks an angry L across his palm. He feels like such an idiot. L, for loser, he thinks bitterly. How fitting.
"That’s a beautiful name," he lies through his teeth. "Don't get many Agathas nowadays."
“Yes, I know. Is it inappropriate to give you a gift anyway? I just thought, because of the tape you made me-”
“Besides,” Dean continues “you healed me enough times. It’s about time I returned the favor.”
Dean wraps his arms around Cas even tighter as a tear escapes and tracks gently down his cheek. It splashes silently onto Cas’ shoulder and somehow makes him feel more complete than he ever thought possible. This is the life he’s always wanted for them, this is the life they both deserve.
Silence.
Click. Thump. Click. With every passing second another flash of anger stacks itself in front of Dean like the bricks of a mighty wall. It’s caked with blood, and dirt, and regret.
Cas glances between Dean and the man, his hand still on Dean’s knee and his expression bemused. “Sir, I think you’re mistak-”
A moment of comfortable silence passes before Cas speaks again.
“Yeah, I, um, I hope so.”
“Cas,” Dean begins, but the rest of the words dissolve on his tongue. He looks at him and wonders how he can even begin to explain how much this means to him. How much the angel, standing only a breath away, and fidgeting nervously with the belt of his trenchcoat, means to him. Even if he could find the words, they wouldn’t be enough.
“Oh.” Cas rubs at the back of his head.
“It’s uh, a gift. I mean, you know what those are now, I told you about them already.” He gestures to the box still held in Cas’ hands as a faint red hue creeps up his neck and along his cheeks. “This one is especially for today.”
Dean clears his throat and motions to the gift again. “Go ahead, open it.”
And neither does Dean.
It’s perfectly them.
“I don’t gives a rat’s ass whether you agree or not.” Dean can hear his voice rising sharply like it always does when he gets angry. “You shouldn’t have done that.” He wants to smother it, to silence the dark thoughts that slither along in its wake, but he knows that it won’t work. It never works.
His words have dragged every sound from the room. Only vast, endless silence remains.
Cas tilts his head, seemingly more startled by this than by the kiss. “Out?”
“Of course.”
“Dean, if you wanted me to, I could knock you out.” Cas raises two fingers in the air as Harold’s head snaps around to stare at him.
He grins at Cas and secures the bandage, pausing in a moment of silent deliberation before quickly lifting Cas’ hand to his mouth and planting a kiss against the pale fabric. “There," he murmurs "all better.”
The warmth of Cas’ lips, and his hands gently cupping Dean’s face are the start and the end of the world for Dean Winchester.
Together.
Cas disappears from view again as the plane starts forward with a lurch that makes his stomach drop. He glances out the window and sees the runaway slowly coming into view as the plane rolls into takeoff position. Panic settling in, he snaps the plastic blind shut. It might be better if he doesn’t have to see them suspended in midair in a giant metal monstrosity. He closes his eyes for a moment, and tries to regulate his breathing before a sharp voice cuts in. “Excuse me, sir?” He opens his eyes to see a blonde woman dressed in a cabin crew uniform and peering into his face, her scarlet lips pulled into a classic customer service smile.
“I missed you.”
“Sorry, Dean.” And he is. Dean knows he is. And hell, he loves him for it. But he can’t tell him that, because of course he can’t, so he nods and shrugs and motions to the blank flatscreen in front of them.
Before Cas can finish talking, Dean turns the parcel over in his hands and comes face to face with a hilariously hideous mess of tape, torn paper, and what looks suspiciously like chewed gum. He raises an eyebrow at Cas who is awkwardly rubbing a hand across his neck. “I was going to tell you not to do that.”
Cas moves closer in the sand, their bodies touching as he leans into him. He plants a gentle kiss on Dean’s head and glances out towards the sparkling water. He grins to himself, a wistful look in his eyes as he turns to Dean. “It’s just like I told you the night we met. Good things do happen, Dean.”
Dean tries to refocus and ignore the sick feeling sloshing around in his stomach.
“I meant it.”
“Uh, it was a weird one. I’ll tell you all about it when we get back.” Cas crosses his feet at the ankles and glances up at the star-speckled sky. He wishes Dean was here to see how beautiful it looks. He feels a smile cross his face, a secret smile for Dean, even if he can’t see it. He’s got something he knows will make him laugh. “Sam wore a knitted cardigan.”
Dean glances at him quickly before sighing and pulling over to the side of the road in resignation. He turns to Cas but his eyes seem to be having trouble maintaining direct contact.
Dean can feel his palms sweating as he once again considers abandoning the mission. Agatha stares at him evenly, her eyes barely blinking. He takes a deep breath and forces the words to spill from his mouth before his lips can clamp themselves shut forever. "What flowers should I buy for the love of my life?"
He takes a deep breath and steps through the metal detector, his heart hammering in his chest. A second passes before a loud beep escapes the machine. Cas glances over sharply from where he is busily gathering their luggage.
Dead silence.
Cas peers at him, shaking his head in disbelief. “No, actually, it’s not.”
Before he has time to say anything else, Cas steps into the room and closes the door behind him.
Dean's stomach flips twice on the final words.
“Oh no, I can’t do that.”
Dean smiles and takes them from her. They smell heavenly. He already knows Cas will love them. “They’re perfect. What else?”
“Woah, easy there, Scooby Doo,” Dean’s voice wafts over from the driver’s seat, chased quickly by the sound of his gentle laughter. “Decapitation stains are a bitch to get out of this thing. Trust me, I know.” Without even looking at him, Cas can tell that he’s grinning. Vividly, he can picture the lines marking happy creases beside his eyes and mouth. Cas turns to him, unable to resist seeing it with his own eyes, and knowing as he does, that he will never grow tired of seeing Dean Winchester smile. It’s heartbreakingly rare and breathtakingly beautiful and even now as Dean directs his gaze back to the road, Cas can’t seem to look away.
“Exactly. They represent gratitude and affection. They’re very popular.”
Dean is deliberating whether or not to burn the entire bunker to the ground in frustration when he hears a knock on his bedroom door. A flash of panic races through him as he quickly tries to hide what he’s doing. “Uh, just a minute!”
He leans his head on Cas’ shoulder and watches the waves lapping gently against the shore.
Despite his desire to do anything but, Dean finds himself hastily pulling out a library chair and sitting down.
“Nah. I mean, yeah, I did spent way too long making that but I did it to make you happy.”
Dean smiles back and reaches for the remote control. He slides closer to Cas and throws the blanket over his knees before he can think of a reason not to.
“It’s Hulk, Cas, he’s The Incredible Hulk. I thought Metatron downloaded the entirety of pop culture directly into your brain or something?”
Dean can feel his smile faltering. He glances towards the door behind him. It would be so easy to turn and make a run for it. He could just forget this whole thing and go home. He shakes his head, trying to knock the thought loose. No. Not now. He has work to do. "I have three questions for you, but I promise I'll be quick.”
