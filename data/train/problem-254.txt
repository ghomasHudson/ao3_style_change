In hindsight, it shouldn’t have been so surprising. He had been randy for hours and he hadn’t gotten laid in months. Nevertheless, it did surprise him when, in less than a minute, his pleasure peaked and he was coming between them. He grunted and whined and barely kept himself from biting into Sherlock’s shoulder.
John threw his hands up in irritation. “There’s no talking to you. I’m going to go find where Sherlock’s gone. Make sure he’s not getting himself arrested for stealing medical records. Just don’t tell anyone about this.”
“... Granted, but then I’d be the one cleaning the litter box. Not to mention doing the shopping for it and taking it the veterinarian.”
“To be clear... you know my lack of experience and difficulty with social situations in general - and sex in particular. I need to know if there’s some subtext I’m missing in this conversation. Like how asking someone if they want to get coffee is code for asking for a date.”
John played with the curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck and murmured encouragements. He hummed back pleasantly as he suckled at the tip for a moment before dipping down again. His eyes were closed in concentration. The longer his mouth was on him, the more John’s focus narrowed to just the delicious feeling on his aroused cock and the growing urge to spill inside that soft mouth. Oh, did he want to.
“Though I thought I could branch out to another activity. Would you object to a- ah... friendly blow job?”
“Then why are you looking so bloody bashful, eh? If you didn’t talk then what... oh.... really? Again?”
John was having yet another birthday. ‘Odd how it happens every year, genius.’ Sherlock actually agreed to attend this time. There may have been sexual bribery involved.
“Just anxiousness. This isn’t my area. But I’m a quick study. I have done it once before. I’m sure I could have learnt to do it well, given the chance.”
His friend pulled up a bit, but kept his mouth wrapped tight. His other hand slid up to rub his balls. The man groaned around his glans massaging it with his tongue as he sucked.
If he had to choose one or the other, which would he... He imagined having Ava... and the thrill of a possible future with this vibrant woman paled against his emotional recoil at the thought of losing the closeness in his friendship with Sherlock.
Sherlock returned to staring at the far wall again. They both took a moment to think, which was progressively more difficult as they finished the second bottle of wine.
“Look, I think you just got caught up in the moment and acted on impulse. Happens. People love to celebrate with a kiss. It’s understandable. I am a pretty decent kisser after all.” John smirked.
“Ha. I’m here because you’re the best friend I’ve ever had. There have been days that I questioned if you cared about me at all, but most days it feels like you do. It was so strange. From the beginning, you wanted me around even when you were cross with me. And I’m here because you’re the most interesting person I’ve ever met. Other people seem boring compared to you. When I’m out with a friend or on a date, I think about what you might be doing, if you’re safe, if you’re bored, if you’ve eaten. And I want to protect you too. Losing you terrifies me. I hate when you go chasing after a criminal without me. You can be such a dick sometimes. You wind me up, but there’s no one I’d rather spend my time with.”
John walked up the stairs to their flat. He was home a few hours early due to a marvelous plumbing disaster at the clinic. The whole place had flooded. He wasn’t sure how long the building would be out of commission and he was already hoping a good case would keep him busy for the time being. Maybe he’d walk into their flat and find Sherlock talking to him like he thought John had been there the whole time and then he’d pout that he’d have to repeat himself, the git. John grinned fondly.
They set another date in just under a week from their first one. Meanwhile John spent much of his free time thinking things over. Sherlock could tell something was up and John could see his uncertainty about it. But for once, he wasn’t pressing for information.
John brushed them aside, used to his sulky comments by now. ‘It’s important to me.’ ‘I’ve slept with my fair share too.’ ‘You’re the one married to your work, not me.’ ‘Necessary, no. Desirable, yes.’ ‘I actually like my archaic mating rituals, with the chatting and laughing and good company. Don’t tell me you don’t like being wined and dined or I’ll tell Angelo how little you appreciate him.’
The stranger smiled and pointed at the badge clipped on John's shirt. John unconsciously lifted a hand to touch it and nodded.
"When did you get here?" John stared at him with bloodshot eyes, silver blonde hair sticking out in a way that made Sherlock want to smile for some reason.
Sherlock melted into John's arms, his mind involuntarily still analyzing and filing away emotions: pleasure, fulfillment, happiness, contentedness, love.
BTW sorry for all the mistakes I must be making, Sherlock would be appalled, but please keep in mind English is not my first language.
A rickety old thing that had no affair being called a bridge stood ahead of them just as they emerged from under the canopy of trees. It was hanging over a rushing stream flowing deep below within the confines of its bed. The erosion patterns on either sides of the riverbed clearly indicated it often flooded to higher levels, Sherlock noted as he started crossing right behind John.
"Do you really?" John was impressed he played the violin, though he didn't quite get the point of the statement "You'll have to play for me some time."
"But you never attend these tedious things." Sherlock gives him a dissecting look, and then smiles maliciously and looks around searchingly. "Oh I see. Where is my dear brother in law, then?"
He leans back and away, sitting on his heels on the bed, and Sherlock almost whimpers at the loss of the warmth and contact, but John is still moving, and suddenly his head is down between Sherlock's parted thighs.
"Everything's under control but you should go back to the infirmary building. When things calm down, I'll have your patients transferred from sick bay" he paused and tried to smile conspiratorially at John "Just looking out for your best interests," he added
Mycroft, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson were far from shy in pointing out how uncharacteristic of Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective and self-proclaimed sociopath, to not just have John stay over, but also dote on him like a love-sick teenager.
Maybe this is what he needs to stop feeling miserable. Maybe this is what he misses so much he can barely breathe. Time to test the theory, then.
"Not the way you do" Sherlock said. This was it. John was going to find out, and he would lose him forever.
"He is right here, ready to play peacemaker between you two prats as usual." a gruff voice comes from behind them and they all turn to face a silver-haired man who looks weary and bored. John has the feeling the man has seen too much of the Holmes' drama in his lifetime. He also looks extremely familiar, but John just can't quite place him.
John huffs out a broken, heartless laugh "I suppose it's my fault that I hoped… well, I hoped…" John shrugs and doesn't finish this sentence either. He keeps leaving his words hanging in the air, unfinished, open and lost on his lips. He looks sad and like a light was blown out in his eyes. Sherlock doesn't know what to do or say.
She turned to John. “Oh my god. You didn’t tell me you live with Sherlock Holmes!” she hissed at him.
It was a losing battle, though. Mostly because none of it, in fact, bothered John. Not really. The only reason why he dug in his heels about any of it was that it bloody well pissed him off that Sherlock didn’t respect his wishes. So after John gave him a blistering ‘no means no’ speech, Sherlock finally backed off. A little.
Sherlock returned to the sitting room some time later, though in less time than John would have taken if it were him. He was once again fully dressed, even wearing his favorite dressing gown. John got the distinct impression that he was attempting to appear unfazed. He supposed most people would believe it.
“...I ...My predictions of how long any task will take you to complete are reliably accurate. I know when you’ll return and I give up long before that deadline.”
“You should look in the mirror, mate,” John tossed back. “My advice is to grow a personality because your face is one hell of a handicap.”
Thanks for all the comments on the fanfic. This is one of the few stories I've ever finished. Endings are not my thing. So... what kind of dog do you think they got?
“I believe I’ve complained at length about your impulses to go out and find women with which to have sex. I now have first hand experience of why sex is so appealing.”
Remembering he wasn’t supposed to tease him, John slid his hand down to cup Sherlock’s bollocks. The man gasped. Then he tried to stifle a moan when John gently fondled them. “You don’t have to worry about keeping quiet. The sounds are part of it.”
Sherlock started shifting about oddly. Like wriggling, but slower. John thought he might be uncomfortable and fidgeting, but then he reached back and ran his fingers along his hip. Oh. Sherlock was feeling John’s skin and was using his whole body to do it. He remembered the sensation of a warm naked body against his own must be new for him. Couldn’t blame him for that. Sherlock’s body felt new to him too.
The row turned into a wrestling match on the sitting room rug, which ended with Sherlock’s energy dwindling into a large yawn. And so he decided settle down onto John’s chest for a nap. Yes, he actually did that.
“Not at all.” He teased the frenulum with his tongue for a few moments, then popped the head into the O of his lips.
“And what about...uh, I’m given to understand that it is... expected... customary to reciprocate sexual activities.”
“This is what happens when you exhaust yourself. What if we’d been in the middle of chasing a criminal? I’m not staying here on the hard floor while you snore in my ear.”
Life continued at 221 B. At first there weren’t any changes. But eventually a few things started to pop up here and there.
They finished the last case. At home, they touched each other easily as always. But now each of those touches was accompanied with the thought, ‘This won’t be allowed.’ And he was startled by how often it happened.
Instead, he intently scanned the large crowd of patrons for maybe a minute before returning his attention to his companions. “The woman of Lebanese descent showing a tasteful amount of cleavage. She’s sitting at your 4 o’clock, and with a pint rather than a mixed drink. She fetishizes authority figures. This is not her local, so she doesn’t want to be recognized. Looking for one night stand. No interest in anything past that. Your body language indicates decently high hormone levels at the moment. Assuming you don’t botch your introduction or drink too much, the probability you will enjoy a very satisfactory orgasm tonight is quite high.”
“It’s fine. He’s going to be annoying for the foreseeable future though.” John glanced at him. He looked unsettled. “What is it?”
“Mocking me isn’t helping. It’s not stupid to care about your feelings. You have to tell me, because I can’t tell what’s in your head.”
He slid his hand into Sherlock’s hair and brought him down for filthy kiss. “I want to see you come like that again. Take your clothes off. Come on.”
“Why not? Because he’s a man? Because if that’s it, fuck’s sake John, I think I might actually become violent with you.”
“Your approval or disapproval affects me, whereas the opinions of most others are irrelevant. Your presence is both calming and stimulating. You improve my focus. I... find pleasure in your company. Don’t smirk. I wasn’t talking about sex. But that too.... How do you think of me?”
“Half of the yarders think that’s the reason you two aren’t together, yeah. The other half think you’re secretly shagging. A few think Sherlock’s asexual.”
“Two weeks ago we were in Swansea. For three days. And you didn’t remember to tell me we were going until five minutes before we had to leave.”
John pressed his lips together to keep the smile off his face, but the harder he fought the more difficult it became and soon he was shaking trying to hold in the laughter. Sherlock risked a glance at him when he saw the movement and the moment of eye contact broke him. He snorted and couldn’t suppress the giggles any longer.
Sherlock removed the headphones from his ears, and was conspicuously not looking at John. “It’s safe to assume the clinic had to close for some issue or another. It’s difficult to read your emotional level due to the shock of the situation, but you didn’t leave work of your own accord. Your general demeanor shows it wasn’t a serious issue such as legal trouble, contagious epidemic, physical danger, etc. Hmmmm.”
A new case fell in their lap. An exciting one. Well, it was more exciting for Sherlock. Very difficult. The culprit was a sly one. John appreciated that it got them out of London for a change. But what started out as a fun new puzzle turned into an obsession that dragged on for weeks. Pictures and clippings and yarn littered the hotel room they were staying at. Which was one room, one bed. Mycroft (or the government, if there was a difference) was footing the bill for this one and, given the length of their investigation, had decided to economize. Not that they ever slept at the same time... That would have been easier.
Did John think about that night in bed with Sherlock? Of course. Without hesitation. Contrary to Sherlock’s fears, he really didn’t worry about it. It had just never happened before. With a man. He’d never wanted to. It was kind of exciting, actually. He would never admit it to anyone ever - for fear of sounding like a twat - but it kind of made him feel sexier. Like he was less boring and vanilla.
“How in the hell am I still standing? Haven’t slept more than a few hours in the past few days. And god, I must reek. Can’t even remember when either of us last showered. Have you been wearing the same clothes this whole time? Have I?”
He suspected Sherlock would prefer to just get down to the main event going by the desperate little noises he was making, so he didn’t stop for any foreplay. He pumped him firmly, watching his expressive face. His eyes were shut tight and he was biting his lip, and John didn’t like how anxious he still seemed. Last time they hadn’t been facing each other and he suspected Sherlock was uncomfortable being watched, no matter that it was a fantasy of his. In the fantasy world you could pretend to you were confidant. So John leant down for a kiss, getting a gasp in return. A moment later Sherlock kissed him back. And unlike all of their kisses for the past months, it wasn’t chaste at all. Sherlock’s tension eased away as their tongues slid together.
John could tell in his peripheral vision that Sherlock was studying him. Then he seemed to be getting closer. And closer.
“Hi, um... Is this your flatmate?” the woman asked, clearly implying ‘the one you said wouldn’t be home?’.
Ok, so John hadn’t technically lied when he said Sherlock was good in bed. He just never really got the chance to find out for sure, though he was certain he would be good at sex given the chance. John was more concerned about defending Sherlock’s reputation. Greg was being a complete tosser.
It all became so second nature that they found it harder to remember not to reach out and touch when there were eyes to witness them. And people were starting to whisper even more. Angelo beamed at them, putting a candle on the table every time they came in. Lestrade rolled his eyes at them. People assumed they were together more than ever. John supposed there must be something in their body language’. It was inconvenient, but understandable.
John sucked him like a lolly, taking his time to map the area with his tongue. Sherlock was getting desperate and starting to keen. He finally took pity on him and slid down to engulf his cock in soft wet heat.
Sherlock set it aside and John could see that sure enough, the man was ready; in body at least. John moved to stand beside him, but didn’t really know how to get things started. He was usually good at this part. But this part was usually with a woman. And there would be kissing and flirting.
“Catalogue you. Fill in the missing information. There’s only such much you can glean from sight alone. Through clothing.”
“No! For fuck’s sake, Greg. Why would you say that, like you assume he’s a freak? In fact, he’s actually really good in bed.”
“For a waltz, you must have a partner,” he replied quietly, eyes on the floor with a small shy smile.
John worked. They went on cases. Sherlock did putrid experiments in the kitchen. John went on dates. Sherlock tried to keep a beehive in their flat. John shouted.
“Fuck, that looked so good, mmm, yes. I’m gonna - yessss!” And John emptied himself, fucking his own fist, keening.
“You should think about it, John,” Lestrade called out to his retreating back. “Friends nonsense,” he continued to grumble. “Perfect for each other and too stupid to notice. Pillocks.”
“I... wasn’t sure. You might be... sens’tive. ‘cause of your sister. People say you must be queer too.”
“Regardless, I see no reason I’d want you gone. Our current state is my ideal. It’s you who are seeking something else.” His arms circled around John, as if to keep him there.
“You forget where you left your keys constantly, but your mind retains that particular memory in vivid detail.”
John snorted. “Yeah, they did. When I ‘as a kid. Got inta few fights ‘cause o’ that. They’d say things... such bullshit. The things they’d say about her... blackened a few eyes over it.”
“What if I did it for you?” The look of shock on Sherlock’s face was enormously gratifying. “If you wouldn’t be comfortable with that, I get it, but...”
John’s hadn’t really thought about the words before he said them. He surveyed the reactions. A few looked confused. Molly looked like she hadn’t been expecting the revelation to happen right then, but didn’t seem exactly surprised by it. Greg looked smugly satisfied, mouthing ‘finally’. Mike had a growing look of suspicion blooming on his face. Mrs. Hudson looked proud as you please. Finally he glanced at Sherlock who had blanked his expression, but he could read him well enough to see the shock and uncertainty he was feeling. But John didn’t see fear or embarrassment or anger. Relieved, he brought his hand rest against the nape of Sherlock’s neck, idly playing with the curls there.
When he returned, Sherlock had not done a bloody thing about the tent in his pants and was by all indicators back working on the case.
Sherlock snickered and inspected that part of him too. That finished, he impatiently tried to roll him over.
That is to say, Sherlock’s libido was making itself known. Multiple times over the next few days, he was plagued by sudden erections at random times. And on top of that, his general demeanor had returned to full on twat mode. John wholeheartedly believed it was because Sherlock was incapable of dealing with Work frustration at the same time as sexual frustration. Obviously there was a simple solution, but every time John suggested it, it turned into a shouting match that ended with them giving each other the silent treatment for the next few hours. Then eventually the argument would cycle back around again.
“Dear lord, they’re going to find out that you’re having sex with John sooner or later. Why you can’t act like a grown man about it instead of a sulking adolescent is beyond me.”
“You know, John, people change. In the years I knew him before you came along, he was always the same. Aloof, callous, derisive. In fact, I only think he would have become more isolated and spiteful if things had stayed the same. The change in him after he met you... you can’t know. He’s... thawed. Willing to interact with us mere mortals. He’s even considerate every now and then. Most of all, he’s happier. He’s affectionate even. We both know the sociopath routine is a load of shit. He pretends sentiment is beneath him, but it comes as natural as breathing when it comes to you. He’d just never admit it. Don’t let him fool you with his bullshit. Just... don’t dismiss the possibility.”
Sherlock reached back and started tugging at his waistband. “You want, I think you want...” Amazing. Even distracted as he was, he was still making deductions.
“Oh. Um. No, it’s fine. Just don’t let it get caught on camera. It’ll be all over the news and then we’ll have to stage a public breakup before anyone will date me again.”
“Come off it, John. You’re not just casual friends who are having casual sex now. You’re joined at the hip. You live in each other’s pockets, to be honest. You share a flat, you work together, you go to dinner together... He kisses you when the mood strikes him and quite frankly you two have zero personal space boundaries. And, god, those soppy looks you give each other have gotten worse.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. You’ll already be doing the shopping, you can get its food. It’s illogical to have me go as well. A waste of time.”
He gave a long suffering sigh and faced the Detective Inspector. The man’s eyebrows were attempting to reach his hairline and his expression was beginning to change from shocked to amused.
“It’s unfortunate about my gender. Oth’wise walking in on me mighta been jus’ what we both like.” Sherlock’s face contorted in mortification about what had just slipped out. “Sorry. Drunk.”
“Yeah, I do. So no more talking about me finding someone else and leaving you. I’m not looking for anyone else.”
That was a huge plus in her favor, in fact. He was so busy having a nice time that it took far longer than it should have for something important to occur to him. He liked her. No, that wasn’t the revelation. But he liked this woman. And he didn’t get the vibe that she was purely interested in one night of lust. He thought they were really hitting it off. Their date wasn’t even quite finished and he was already looking forward to another one. And then presumably there would be another one after that. And definitely sex soon, though probably not tonight. All that possible future was running happily in the back of his mind.
have been the end of it, but of course it was not to be. As it turned out, Sherlock’s body had become very insistent about its needs. Needs that Sherlock had been ignoring for the last few weeks.
“Do you think you can come like this? Dancing in the middle of the flat, in your pants like a teenager?”
“It doesn’t matter if I believe in something or not. A thing exists or doesn’t regardless of my belief in it. Love is a chemical process in the body. It does exist.”
Thanking him, Sherlock takes his time stirring sugar into his coffee, embarrassingly relieved to have something constructive to do that will while away a few extra seconds, bringing him closer to the moment that he and John part ways once more. John's conscience will be salved and he’ll be able to go back to his perfectly nice life and say that he and Sherlock
I have ever been and the most… real. I won’t lie; I like sex, but never at the cost of my place in your life because I like you more. I would be content with my own hand forevermore if that’s what it takes.”
“Poor dear,” she coos, turning her attention to Sherlock. “Of course - you haven’t felt up to it lately.”
"Lick your palm - get it good and wet. Good. Now wrap it around the top... further up, so just the crown... yeah," John breathes. "Just like that."
“I’m amazed you allow yourself to be seen with me, heathen that I am with my Marks and Spencer shirts and my non-cashmere socks!”
A pleased but surprised look steals across John’s face. He is not normally given to being concerned about impressing people, or having them like him, and Sherlock is intrigued to find it in this case. John is polite and friendly in social situations but he doesn’t suffer fools gladly and makes no bones about letting people know when they have pissed him off. Of course when he used to date, he would have a vested interest in the women he had his sights on enjoying his company as it would dictate his chances of intercourse later in the relationship, but to his knowledge John has nothing to gain from making a good impression on Mummy and Dad.
“I ought to check Dr Watson’s vitals,” a timid looking man is brandishing a blood pressure cuff, but already retreating in defeat at the glare that Sherlock must be levelling at him.
John focussed on his tea and tried to push away the wave of possessive lust that swept him every time he thought about Sherlock sitting there wearing his favourite jumper. He’d left it hung over a chair in their room a few days ago, worn once but not dirty enough to warrant washing yet. It would smell of him, he knew and the fact that Sherlock had chosen to wrap himself in something so clearly John’s and so unlike his usual choice made John want to pick him up and hug him – stick his hands up the inside of the soft wool and finish what the jumper had started, namely, scent-marking Sherlock as
For a while it even felt like a good idea. We papered over the cracks and you agreed to be my best man." John's eyes close at the painful memory and he has to pause for a moment. "I'm sorry about that too, that was unfair of me. But you agreed and you seemed to like Mary, so I thought to myself, well, why can't I have both? Why can't I have my best friend back from the dead and a wife? But the more I thought about it, the more wrong I realised it was. I was too far in to back out though, so I convinced myself that it was the nerves and the confusion of having you back that was making me doubt. It wasn't, and Mary knew something was up almost from the start. So in the end, one morning she asked me, and as I looked at her and told myself to fight for her, I already knew what an empty victory it would be. When you have experienced love in your life, it's very hard to mistake."
He has no recollection of doing so, but John has already got his hand inside his pyjama bottoms. At the first whisper of a touch, John realises that he is already much too far gone to mess around. He takes a firm grip on himself - there's no time to find lube or get more comfortable. The need to come thrums under his skin like static on a thundery day, demanding and imperative. Watching Sherlock come apart like that, so trusting and uninhibited is one of the sexiest things he has ever done - and that's saying something.
John agrees that it is sad but doesn’t tell Mme Hudson that he cannot find it in him to fault Clara for calling it a day knowing how his sister gets when she’s drunk. In some ways he’s amazed that she stuck it out for as long as she did. He hopes that his sister’s marriage might deflect the direction of the conversation but Mme Hudson is tenacious.
and the way time slides and folds around him is making that feel unachievable. No newspapers, no emails, no TV – nothing that can pin down a date.
Sherlock shrugged huffily. “No, I like to remind myself that I am no longer an adolescent by wearing clothing designed for adults.”
Hudders and John discuss banalities; Christmas movies and family traditions. Sherlock accepts the offer of a glass of red wine (an excellent Saint-Émilion, at the perfect temperature) and listens with half an ear, relishing the warmth of John pressed all down his side, the fullness of his laughter and the way he unconsciously angles himself to fill the spaces that Sherlock has left between them until they overlap and the boundaries between them blur.
is gay or not, he wouldn't be the first man who re-evaluated his choices after a chance meeting. And until he has accepted an offer elsewhere, he is fair game, Sherlock. You should consider that. Sleep well, cousin!"
“Sherlock, I’ve been wanting you for the longest time, do you really think I’ll give up now? Take as long as you need. Forever if you want. I don’t care, as long as we are together.”
"So, what do you think happened?" Sherlock said, standing up straight and looking at John with those piercing eyes.
Every thought left Sherlock's mind except for John… John… John. Could he really be with him? Would John be with him if Sherlock sacrifices everything? Descend to Earth, become an immortal, give up all the beauty ha was privy to…
He sat under a big tree where he knew John took his lunch sometimes. Moments later, he smiled and opened his eyes when he felt it: John. How could he not feel it? Everything was gentler and sweeter when John was around.
Sherlock slowly raises his head to look at his brother in law. He is startled at the deep affection in his eyes. Greg lets go of his arm slowly and smiles to him.
They reached a big double door that led into an office. As soon as John stepped inside he knew something was wrong, and his feeling was confirmed when his eyes fell on the man lying on the floor just behind the desk.
"By the way guys, sorry about before." John said as his face turned a deep shade of pink. "I think I walked in on some of you earlier."
"I don't eat while working" Sherlock said as he carefully sit his violin in its case, "Slows me down. You can have your dinner nonetheless. I don't mind."
"Are you sniffing my hair, you mad man?" John opened his eyes to look up at Sherlock, who had his nose buried in the short blonde strands.
Sherlock was sitting at a table by the edge of the garden. A curly-haired boy that John recognized from the picture Greg had shown him sat next to him and they were both whispering conspiratorially.
If John hadn't dedicated years and years of his life to study the human heart and its every detail, he would have confidently sworn that he felt his heart smash into a million pieces at the moment. Black, liquid ache crawled through his stomach into his chest, prickling and painful in his eyes. He felt his lips tremble, but he pursed them and stepped back
The silence was heavy and loaded, as if something was about to explode in the room. Sherlock felt John move next to him, getting ready for what was to come.
"I… I'm sorry." was all he could say while watching a person's world collapse right before him. The mother and daughter clung to each other sobbing, and John fled the room.
Theory two: Sherlock is annoyed John wouldn't spend as much time with him when he gets back with his ex. Plausible. John proved useful and less boring than average by a wide margin, not to mention his skills in bed. Sherlock blushes at the thought and checks if John is looking at him.
He decided not to wait for John to hand him the file and shuffled through the box on the table to retrieve it.
"I'm really tired, Sherlock. I think I'll go to bed now. I'll… see you around." John says even as he moves towards the door hastily.
Then, Sherlock apparently snaps out of it, as he gives him a warm smile, snatches the key, and leaves without a word.
Sherlock goes cold all over. He leans back, causing John's hand to slip from his face and hang in the air, frozen and unsure. He stares at John, unable to believe how much the words hurt. Apparently, he miscalculated, overlooked the danger, but he should have known. He swallows against the lump in his throat.
Suddenly, John's eyes are sad and fearful. He's looking at him differently, like they haven't known each other for months, like he is bracing himself for something hurtful and difficult. Sherlock tenses with apprehension.
"And I appreciate that, Officer, but you and I both know that it's illegal to deny a prisoner medical care and you could lose your job over it. Now, I'm just looking out for
“I know.” Greg said, unable to keep himself from continuing to stare at the graceful curves of John’s body “But I can’t get over it. I want him, and I need to get it out of my system.”
They started walking again, Sherlock leading, until they reached a door half hidden behind a large file cabinet. Inside, there were pieces of old furniture, including desks, chairs, and an old bunker bed. It was dark and quiet. All John could hear was Sherlock's breathing and soft rustle of clothes as he moved close by.
Greg swallowed audibly at the sight that confirmed all his suspicions and fantasies, John’s cock was mouth-wateringly huge, hanging heavily between his thick but fit thighs. He was uncircumcised, foreskin pulled back a bit revealing the flushed tip which was glistening with precum. Greg’s hand moved faster, now fisting at his cock and feeling drops of precum wetting his pants.
Theory one: Sherlock is jealous because he is in love with John. Assessment: Ridiculous. Emotions render one's brain clouded and slow. Caring makes one's judgement biased. No. He can't be jealous because he isn't in love with John Watson. Theory ruled out.
"Johnnn" he drawls grumpily. John lifts his face, lips swollen from kissing and damp from sucking on Sherlock's peaking nipples.
I hope this is posted in the right time, I feel like it's too late or something, but I couldn't post it earlier
"Your eyes are red-rimmed which indicates lack of sleep, yet you chose to stay late and do dull paperwork. You wanted to occupy your mind with something mechanic and detached, so something is wrong.
"Come on, we deal with life and death every day. Why can't we talk about it? Now, can we talk for a minute?"
"You want me to baby-sit some delusional friend of yours as a favor," Sherlock glared at him, he really wasn't that desperate for a case after all. "Probably a personal trauma masked by an invented conspiracy theory. Dull."
"Oh, that was smart. I admit that threw me in for a loop at first, but it's also simple. What if the killer wasn't outside at all that moment? What if it was just an illusion? A simple trick using a dummy and some piano wires."
"We'll have all the time in the world to prove it to you. Right now I need to show you something. I need your help John, please" his eyes were open and pleading, somehow stripping John of all his defenses. He sighed in resignation and found himself walking behind a possibly insane prison inmate again.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and took John by the arm. They got in a luxurious black car that Mycroft had apparently arranged for them. John planned to ask Sherlock who exactly his brother was and what he did later on. Not now though, all he wanted this moment was to shower and rest with Sherlock by his side and as far from Pentonville as possible.
He leaned across John's lap to retrieve the remote control, only to find himself on the receiving end of a scorching kiss. He wordlessly melted into it, nibbling softly at John's lips before he opened his mouth. He had no idea how much he had wanted this until it started. Moments later, they were both panting as their lips and tongues swirled together in a heated kiss.
He turned around to glare in his direction, but instead of the anger he expected, John looked like he was trying not to laugh.
John's eyes were soft as his hand brushed Sherlock's palm gently. They locked eyes and for a moment, they were the only ones there, drawn into one another and connected. Each of them peering into the other's thoughts like his own. They didn't have to say anything. It was well understood by now that neither could live without the other, and watching someone attempting to take John's life was as if they were attempting to rip out Sherlock's own heart.
When John lifted his head from the mountain of paperwork on the desk, he realized by the ache in his neck that he had been sitting there for hours. The place around him was in semi-darkness and silence.
John clasps his left hand around Sherlock's cock and buries his face again under his balls. It only takes a couple of strokes for Sherlock to start feeling the delicious tremors of a fantastic orgasm. His body is a ball of flame, seizing with the pleasure, and everything disappears for a moment... or many moments, who knows?
Sherlock felt the adrenaline already flooding his veins, his heart jumping with euphoria, and his brain racing with the excitement.
Sherlock's feet led him to John and his arms wrapped around him without thought. He immediately noted he was the one trembling violently, whilst John, who had been the potential victim, stood calm and still, letting Sherlock hold him close.
"Sarah asked me to go away with her" John said with clipped tones, as if every word cost him so much.
"Shit." John said and quickly kneeled next to the body. He recognized the officer, Johnson. He hadn't known him well, but he had seemed nice. The back of his head was covered in blood. It looked like he was hit with something heavy, John felt for a pulse but the man was clearly gone.
His movement is sloppy and uncoordinated, but he pushes John against the wall, making him gasp as he finds himself trapped against Sherlock's longer frame. He looks up in confusion, his lips move to form a question, but Sherlock kisses him desperately and the words are lost between their mouths.
But as soon as the moment passes and the fire in their chests dies down, Sherlock flees the scene mumbling something about work.
Thump, thump, thump. Sherlock could easily recognize Mycroft's steps on the stairs from a mile away. And it wasn't just his stupid umbrella thumping along with his stupid feet, it was also the pompous peacock strut that he never failed to demonstrate.
Being the love of someone’s life is pretty time intensive, Sherlock thinks as he opens the kitchen window and drops the sack onto the bins below with a loud squelch and clatter.
Sherlock blinks a few times, then looks down and, sure enough, he has presented John with a plate on which there is  a flat, green nylon pot scourer, carefully smeared with butter.
He sits beside Sherlock on the bed, picks up his hand and plays idly with his fingers, learning the texture of his string calluses and the shape of his knuckles. Sherlock watches and follows John when he shifts across the mattress to lie down on his side, facing him.
Sherlock's mouth drops open at that and his face goes a strange combination of slack and pink which strikes John as rather odd.
John is tired to the core and he recognises that something has changed between them tonight but he’s been here before. He was so certain that the return to their life at Baker Street would herald the beginning of a new understanding between them – an acknowledgment of the importance of their relationship. And in some ways it has, but it hasn’t shifted as far as John hoped it would. And now they are back here, after the rawness of the hospital, John can’t help but feel that another opportunity to tell Sherlock has slipped through his fingers. For a man who strives to show no emotion, Sherlock certainly does provoke them in others. John feels like Mother Nature herself has decided to teach him a lesson.
Watching over Sherlock Holmes is enough to test anyone’s patience and although the job description is very similar, Martha has never embraced the notion of being a Fairy Godmother for a number of reasons - in particular the travesty that Disney made of the role. (
John imagined that the tub would take some minutes to fill, as large as it is, but when Sherlock pulls back to look at him, the steaming water is two thirds of the way up the sides. and John wonders again at how time bends and warps when they kiss. Sherlock lets him go and piles their towels on the floor where they can reach them. He helps John into the bath, settling him at the end and allowing him to sink down into the water before he climbs in after him, turning to find himself a space between John's thighs where he can lay back against John's chest and rest his head against his shoulder. The tub at Baker Street isn't really big enough for this - they have tried it once or twice, but it has ended up being more trouble than it was worth. This bath is a different thing altogether. John doesn't know if people in the 1920s or 30s were taller, or if a big bath was a status symbol, but there is enough room for them both to be under the water and stretched out in relative comfort, although Sherlock's long legs are bent a little at the knees.
John quickly coated his fingers and watched as Sherlock shimmied the fatigues lower so he could spread his legs, offering John the tempting display of his pretty, pale arse and the fine dark hairs that dusted his cheeks and thighs. Wanting to bend down and take a bite of such perfection, John groaned and contented himself with a double handful.
” And this is stellar work, really, by Sherlock. Worth every penny his parents paid for him to attend (however reluctantly) the most expensive schools in the country. Debating team material, without doubt.
“Yoohoo!” she calls, letting herself into the house through the kitchen doors, reminding John that he hadn’t even checked the doors were locked last night.
John shrugs and nods - it’s as good an answer as any. He doesn’t feel the truth will satisfy Mme Hudson any more than it did his therapist or his sister, or indeed himself. He’s here because he has nowhere else to go and nothing else to do. Here he can avoid the well-meaning attentions of his sister, live rent-free in return for maintenance of the house and garden, and possibly stretch his meagre pension with whatever he can persuade to grow to eat here on the property. He speaks only the rudimentary French he learned at school and this is another reason he accepted his sister’s offer. Without having the necessary linguistic skills he imagines that he won’t be invited to many meals with sympathetic locals.
It takes John much of the morning to put right the damage M. Holmes has done but the irritation soon wears off into a weird kind of fascination. He sits on his step at lunchtime eating his sandwich and wonders what kind of a man wears dress shoes in a garden. He clears an old bed of thistle-like things, now desiccated and rough and asks himself where a name like Sherlock comes from. Is it his first name or part of a double-barrelled surname? He replaces a few glass panes in the dilapidated greenhouse he’s beginning to uncover from beneath the overgrown vine and considers what M. Holmes’s first language might be as he seemed equally willing to insult him in either.
Those brought on by the physical realities of his injuries are not the only changes produced by the explosion. The time he spent in his mind palace seems to have wrought some changes in Sherlock’s attitude. He’s told it’s quite normal for a person’s characteristics and indeed entire personalities to be altered by the injuries and the subsequent unresponsive, sedated state he experienced. He finds it hard to judge how significant such alterations might be, but he sometimes catches John’s surprised glances and understands this means there must be some noticeable deviation. Is it brought on by the injury or the revelations he’d had while sedated – and does it even matter which?
“Sherlock… Sherlock Holmes? Well, then you must be Dr Watson!” The burly man looks overly pleased with himself at his deduction. “He’s usually in the morgue, I’ve been told. I don’t get over to that side of the hospital very often. Never seen him, only in the papers. Was proper glad when he turned out to be alive after all…”
John raised an eyebrow at him but allowed the kiss that followed, folding his arms around his sticky, half naked, semi-interested again
“Understandable given your heightened anxiety and our less than cheerful history with the hospital,” Sherlock agrees. His hands are on John’s knees, warm through his sodden jeans – the only part of him that is.
And John is thinking himself in circles. One moment he's certain that Sherlock was about to admit to his attraction to John and the next he's equally as convinced that he's ruined everything and that Sherlock was finding the words to tell him that their partnership was over. The uncertainty is awful and John recognises his state of mind when Sherlock reaches over and carefully redistributes the six baubles John has crammed onto the same branch in his distraction.
John gets less than a second’s warning  - warm breath ghosting across his cheek – before Sherlock kisses him. It’s careful, gentle and little more than Sherlock’s lips placed against his own and lingering there. The tension rolling off Sherlock’s body is palpable; he’s almost vibrating with it.
With his usual predictability John has to go and find the Gent's after a while,  leaving Sherlock with his cousin and a return to the uncomfortable quiet.
John pulls up his weather app and swears quietly when he sees the forecast - there's no way Sherlock is getting out of Edinburgh by air today and probably not tomorrow either by the look of it.
There is an almighty crash and pieces of the casserole bounce and skitter across the floor, spreading in all directions except the one Sherlock wanted. He leaps to the window and examines the pane of glass in detail but there is no damage, not so much as a scuff.
It’s not a beginning; that was years ago in a lab at Bart’s. Nor an end - no one can know when that might be. This is them, and maybe it’s a new component to their eternally complicated relationship; they are old dogs and these are new tricks, and it remains to be seen how well they can learn them. But he is definitely still John Watson, doctor, soldier, and writer of a popular blog and terrible poetry, and the man at his side is the world’s only consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes, and they’re together in 221B Baker Street. Because that is where they belong and that is how this story will
“You were there all along,” Sherlock says and reaches out a hand to John’s face, hesitating momentarily before he brushes a thumb across his bottom lip, sending lightning tendrils of want snaking between John’s legs. He tries to calm himself – this is Sherlock he’s dealing with – he cannot keep up with him intellectually at the best of times – so how can he possibly know what his intentions are in this action?
“It might,” John nodded and slipped past Sherlock and out of the door into the spring sunshine, although he had plenty of colour in his cheeks already.
"Can't be helped," John mutters and he has to swallow again when Sherlock's neck arches from the sensation of his hand on his hardness. "But I wish you were here all the same."
“I won’t leave,” he says. “I know I said I can’t go back, but… If this isn’t what you want, we can, I dunno, stop now, stay as we are. We
“I don’t have a lot of experience with…” his hand makes an abortive gesture that John understands immediately. It’s not often that Sherlock is at a loss for the right words, he’s usually Mr Scrabble score, but he is trying to explain emotions with a rudimentary and untried vocabulary. “I expected you to be surprised by my return, even pleased. I’d thought about it for so long and planned so many ways to tell you, and in none of them had I factored your grief or the possibility that you might have moved on. If nothing else, that  demonstrates my naivety most succinctly. If anyone needs to be forgiven, it is I. I was the instrument of my own downfall. I saw but I did not observe.”
Sherlock didn’t even grace that with an answer, merely dripped onto the carpet, leaving a spreading patch of darker red. His suit and shoes had to be ruined they were so sodden, and his jacket was darker at the shoulders but dripping from the hem. His shirt, where it was visible, was translucent and stuck to Sherlock like a second skin. His curls, so artfully messed that morning, were plastered to his head, dribbling rivulets of water that he didn’t even bother to wipe away from his face and neck.
The peal of the bells ringing in Christmas Day startle John, even as muffled as they are in the snowy night. John glances at his watch redundantly, of course it's midnight and John stretches in his seat, wondering how long it's going to be before Sherlock emerges.
Sherlock can feel his resolve weakening the longer John talks. It terrifies him - he has fought for months to have arrived in this place. There were nights when his body and mind had both screamed for the oblivion of a hit, when he'd been assaulted by so much emotion that he'd wished he'd been long gone from that lab at Barts before John Watson had walked in and loaned Sherlock his phone.
John snorted and wiggled a finger, evidently trying to catch the attention of the baby, who was staring at Sherlock right behind him.
"Using the right means, and the right people. The infirmary is the weakest link in the security chain here, so that's where I started. The night I nicked your keys I knew for certain the drugs were being hidden inside boxes of medical supplies. No one suspected anything, and the right people were always there to receive the goods and hand them over to the members of the mafia on the inside."
It's been days, and Sherlock still doesn't understand what happened. He sits by his window and watches John leave to work every morning. Then, he goes downstairs, turns left and opens John's door.
"Very well. I will inform D.I. Lestrade that you shall give your statements later. Go home and take a shower, you smell like prison."
His eyes open fully two hours later, judging by the direction of sunbeams on the wall. He realizes his phone has been buzzing in his pocket. He pulls it out and stares at a text from Lestrade on his screen. Case, double murder. Excellent, just what he needed.
A theory was taking shape in his mind. Everything clicked into place except for one part… John. What did John see?
The house was not far. It was small but with an elegant air of domesticity. Most of the crime scene personnel had cleared off by the time they arrived, which was better. Sherlock could think properly, uninterrupted.
"That's what he wants. He attacks when we're on our own and when our guard is down. It's better if we stick together and not give him what he wants."
Sherlock shuddered at the words, feeling a flush rising from his neck to his cheeks. He buried his face in John's neck, breathing in the scent of warm skin. John's breathing was harsh and quick when he spoke again.
"It's the same guy isn't it?" He said, his voice slightly uneven "Tell me I'm not insane. Tell me it's related."
"That's right Rupert! Sherlock said the killer had a medium build!" Max said, patting Rupert's back.
Sherlock stopped kissing him for a moment, he was panting and his eyes were dark with lust and John just couldn't stop himself from moving down onto the long pale neck. He mouthed slowly at the delicate skin, inhaling a scent that lit his insides on fire. Sherlock moaned softly beneath him, and he knew then he wouldn't be able to stop until he tasted ad worshipped every bit of that body
But what Sherlock Holmes does not understand, is why he feels jealous right now. At first he doesn't see it, can't put a name to it. He feels hot liquid rage trickling inside him the moment he meets Dr. Sholto. He wonders why he feels like he wants to hold John's hand and lead him away from here. It's ridiculous.
And John was tremendously relieved to know that Sherlock was just as emotionally invested in their friendship. He called it his ideal even. What exactly did
“Seriously, I know it’s.... not all what proper Englishman say, but there’s not much that could put me off. You can tell me.”
He heaved a great sigh, nodding. He showed her to the door, promising no hard feelings. Sherlock was out in the sitting room when he came back upstairs. John ungracefully dropped to the sofa in resignation and didn’t bother to hide it when he adjusted his still hopeful erection.
John stopped himself again and forced his hands to unclench. He even did some counting exercises that he’d read were good for anger management. Bloody useless internet articles. Now was not the time to lose control. Sherlock was clearly in distress.
“Git. Ok, yeah, in ‘mature’ situations he should’ve stayed and... not jus’ used you n run off. But you were at uni... young and idiots. He mighta been scared. ‘Cause you’re blokes.”
“If I weren’t so well rested, my transport would hardly be capable of... ‘this’,” he hissed, gesturing to the offending appendage.
Bracing himself, John shuffled into place behind him. He took an ungraceful moment to sort out where he should put his other arm so it didn’t fall asleep, and to reposition a pillow under his head. Then there was nothing else left to do. He hesitated. “I’m going to touch you now,” he announced.
The fact that they’d had plenty of time to pull apart and compost themselves before he actually saw them would have made the situation a bit less embarrassing IF it weren’t Sherlock. John saw him read the entire scene, probably starting before he’d even left the flat that evening.
Approximately one second after he pulled back, John saw the look of realization flash over his features. But whatever other reaction he might have had was a mystery, because he was out the door in a flash. Leaving John to do damage control. Of course.
“Not in person. Online only. It didn’t work. It’s too detached if I can’t see them. And if I can see them, I don’t appreciate their efforts to participate.”
John stood there trying to process the scene before him as Sherlock’s breathing slowed and he relocated his arms from behind his back. Then he eventually opened his eyes, leant forward and pressed a button on a laptop that John had not noticed until that moment. He automatically checked the screen, but there was no porn to be found. Looked like a music website. ‘Odd’, he vaguely thought in the back of his mind.
“And if he or she liked you and liked us being together, then I might be up for it. If you were too.”
Days turned into weeks which turned into months. Months filled with affection and bickering and sex and sharing a bed more often than not. And John wasn’t lonely. How could he be? Sherlock was always there, being needy, demanding his attention, making him feel wanted.
“Nah. I assumed you’d be gone like you have been lately, so I chanced it bringing her here. No dice.”
John’s anger quickly dissipated. His friend wasn’t being obstinate, he had a problem. “Ok. Talk to me. What’s wrong?”
John continued to rub his back, hoping to ease some of his distress. “I know what you mean. Lestrade is kind of acting the same way. Pushing me, us, to be like everyone expects. But it’s not their bloody business. We aren’t accountable to anyone but ourselves. We’re fine without their interference.”
The Holmes brothers were at each other again. Yes... shocking. Mycroft was demanding that Sherlock agree to meet up with their parents who would be visiting London in a few days. John was trying to hide his curiosity about who could possibly have raised these alien men in his sitting room.
"All right. Give me a minute," he said as he turned to look at the room. His clever eyes roaming his surroundings.
Sherlock turned around and met his eyes "I saw you on the monitor in the officers' surveillance room after the prisoners broke into it" he shrugged.
Forgot to say I've stolen a line from You've Got Mail cause I'm a sucker for old romantic Meg Rayan movies!
"Please help me find him" he put all the pain and confusion he felt into the words, hoping Mike would believe him.
That's what the CO's and con's called the new batch of inmates arriving at Pentonville. New fish being dumped into the tiny, already overcrowded bowl.
Sherlock followed the doctor who disappeared behind a metal door and into a stairwell.  John was his name.
I know this lacks romance but I promise lots of fluff is on the way. Thanks to whoever is reading, you're awesome and I hope you have an amazing weekend :)
"Odd don't you think? And he was hit from behind, do you really think he would have turned his back to a con?" Sherlock asked.
Through the infirmary's glass door, Jon could see a guard escorting Sherlock into the room. He was now in his prison uniform; a blue shirt and navy blue trousers that were hanging loosely on the narrow hips. He stood by the door staring at John uncertainly, one soft curl partially covering his right eye.
Rupert kept staring at the floor for a moment, seemingly struggling with himself, but instead of exploding, he simply sighed.
John took several deep breaths before he entered Mr. Lestrade's room. He tried to devoid his face of all expression as he said hello and opened the chart. Before he could say anything a small brunette woman jumped out of nowhere and started glaring at him.
They both wrapped their hands around their joint lengths, and their mouths met again in a deep kiss. It was to John's taste in his mouth, to John's feel between his legs that Sherlock came, pleasure rippling through his body in sweet waves. John followed not long after, and they both lied there panting and kissing softly.
He felt good about today, he had been working at Bart's for two years now, gaining a fairly good reputation as a cardiothoracic surgeon. He rarely lost any patients, and he liked to keep it that way. 'Focus. Follow procedure. Be prepared. Don't let them die on your table.
"Kiss me" Sherlock managed, and their mouths collided again, ravenously drinking and breathing each other.
It was clear Costello had no clue and Dimmock was standing behind him, unable to see the mark either. Suddenly, Sherlock was grabbing John by the shoulders and screaming at him to get down.
"I think Sherlock's been keeping a lot of secrets lately." Mycroft says as he gives John a knowing look, making heat rise in his face. Sherlock rolls his eyes, turns, and walks away without a word.
Sherlock was only gone for 15 minutes when John heard the commotion. He abandoned the files on his desk to find Dimmock and another officer supporting Sherlock. John surveyed him quickly, his body was curled around itself in agony, sweat streaming along his face, and blood running freely from his left foot.
"No." Bill shook his head, signs of panic on his face "But she needs to get back. Someone out there tried to attack John and Susan."
The smells though were the most fascinating element thus far. The salty, hot odor of sweat and blood, intertwined with the cold sweet scent of the rain. So much input. So much data to file and categorize
Sherlock knows Molly has a bit of a crush on him, and he shamelessly takes advantage of it. Before she was replaced, she used to allow Sherlock into the lab, let him take a look at the fresh corpses, and even give him specimens for his countless experiments. But now, after one visit to the lab, Sherlock knows those privileges are no longer granted to him.
"Maybe he was afraid it would look like he's leading us to it." Sherlock said. "Or maybe he's worried I'd ask him if he
"You know if you keep doing this you're going to get sacked" Anderson spat in a low voice as he handed him gloves. By now, he knew better than to try to stop him.
His features had to be carved in marble, like statues of Greek gods John had seen at museums. The celestial face was all graceful curves and neat angles, framed by thick, warm dark chocolate curls. The man was wrapped in a long black coat, but underneath, there must have been nothing but liquid light.
"Are you alright?" Sherlock said, watching him with concern. John's hand moved without permission, and covered Sherlock's elegant, pale fingers still resting on his shoulder.
"Sherlock, just come to bed, I won't be able to sleep if I'm not sure you're there." John blurted out, his face turning pink. He was worried, and it was finally showing on his face. But amazingly, he seemed to be worried about Sherlock, rather than himself. He wanted to keep an eye on him and Sherlock simply found himself nodding.
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What happened? A graft occlusion? What? It was textbook. It was textbook. I should've done more. I should've massaged longer. I'm so sorry!"
The next thing John did was simply stupid, but he was not planning on being taken hostage for the inmates to dangle to the guards any time soon. So, he pulled out the needle from his pocket and shoved it in the hand of the inmate who was grabbing him. Luckily, it seemed that the act was so reckless his assailant did not expect it, so instead of responding, he just recoiled with a yelp of pain.
Despite everything Mycroft had said to discourage Sherlock, he had followed John around nearly all the time since the day he saw him. He had never experienced a state of serenity like the one he did when walking with John. Well, he wasn't technically walking with him, just on his side, but it was amazing nonetheless. Never a dull moment with this fascinating man. His thoughts seemed to amaze Sherlock every second.
He blinked, and Harry was there, smiling at him, clinging to his arm like she always had done, like he was the only family and protection she had. She was laughing as she dragged him to meet Clara.
"I could have taken a cab" Sherlock said as soon as he hopped in the car next to Greg "You didn't have to come all the way to get me. You know I hate riding in police cars."
An embarrassing noise escapes Sherlock's mouth as he feels John's tongue flicking on his hole, his whole body wriggles helplessly while John continues to lick between his cheeks. His hand automatically flies to stroke his cock but John somehow catches it and grabs the other one too. He presses Sherlock's hands on the bed on either side of him and settles again between his thighs. Sherlock whimpers, feeling fat drops of precum creating wet patches on his stomach, and John never relents.
Right, Sherlock had to focus now. He turned to the woman standing over her daughter. She was so agitated, her thoughts ripped through his own head immediately: "oh god, what do I do? Alright, stay calm, you can reduce her temperature with a cold bath before going to the A&E." Sherlock watched as she scooped her child, whispering reassuring words to her as she put her in the cold tub. The little girl, Samantha was her name, started sobbing weakly, until her eyes connected with Sherlock's.
"No, I just believe in you." He answered simply, no hint of hesitation in his weakened voice, and took Sherlock's hand to his lips to plant a soft kiss there.
"In a restaurant once, a blind woman turned to me all of a sudden and asked me to pass her the mustard."
Also, sorry if this was case-heavy, but I'm kinda obsessed with mysteries, I spent my entire childhood gobbling every word Agatha Christie ever write.
As I said, this is heavily based on Prison Break, I used to be obsessed with that show, that is before I watched Sherlock and my life was forever ruined of course. I'd like to point out that all information about prisons and prison slang is taken either from Prison Break or from movies like the SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, So it is going to be a bit too American, plus my English is pretty Americanized as well so sorry! I unfortunately don't have a beta but let's just see how this goes! It's all for fun anyway. If you like this and think I should go on please leave a comment or Kudos or whatever, and if you have suggestions of critique I would love to hear it. Love.
Sherlock was drinking in the sight before him, his own erection was bobbing in front of him, John's body was splayed underneath him, and he was in full view of a mouth-wateringly gorgeous cock being stroked in front of him. He started bouncing gently, fucking himself on John's wet tongue, feeling the beginnings of that delicious tingling sensation creeping in. he wasn't going to last long.
"We're lost." Sherlock finally snapped. They'd been walking around in the woods for an hour now after leaving the car at the edge of the forest. There weren't any paved roads for cars to go through the woods, and so they had to hike the rest of the way to their destination.
John casts nervous glances in his date's direction. He often finds himself taking the opportunity of Sherlock's distraction to stare at him like an idiot.
"Yes. In the past 27 months, there have been three cases in London of supposed murder-suicides among couples married little more than a year."
One night, in a haze of post-case euphoria, he had called John his conductor of light, and immediately felt so embarrassed he thought his face might have melted, but John had just looked at him with twinkling eyes and a little smile that made his heart flutter madly. That was the moment he knew was done for, and he was at the mercy of one John Watson and his navy blue eyes.
"Don't you dare die, you idiot!" Sherlock said, and John wanted to laugh but he couldn't. The harder he tried to cling, the quicker reality slipped away into hazy dreams of nights spent in a cold house, glass shattering around him, and Harry blinking blood out of her eyes and smiling.
John had been quite excited about this bizarre trip to some forest in the middle of nowhere in Wales. He had been invited by an old friend by the name of Bill Murray to stay at his family's estate there along with a group of other friends for Halloween, and Sherlock was practically dragged into the affair.
God! How was he so smitten like a teenager after meeting this guy twice? He didn't even know his surname. Maybe John should just ask Greg Lestrade once he gets better.
That night, lying in his bed, John could not help thinking of Sherlock kissing him, of the way their lips fit together effortlessly, and of Sherlock's hand sneaking into his hair… Sherlock's hands… his mind stuttered, as if trying to catch up with something rushing through it. He suddenly opened his eyes thinking of that sentence and why it triggered his brain.
"Must you?" Sherlock rolled his eyes. He was not in the mood for tedious introductions, he needed a puzzle to solve, but Greg ignored him and started talking anyway as he drove away from Baker Street.
He was vaguely aware of the sounds and pleas he was making. It must have been embarrassing, but he couldn't care with John's warm hand working his erection, his thumb stroking the slit and drawing small circles on the head. He wasn't going to last long, but John seemed out of it too, so he let go.
If you watched Orange is the New Black you'd know I kinda stole the drugs story from it. I love that show.
"John…" Sherlock calls, but John is already opening his door. "Goodnight, Sherlock." He says before he disappears inside.
Mycroft stood facing the sun, eyes closed. The others had been there already, all facing the sun, long black coats rippling in the wind. It was a formation, a ritual as old as time. Everyone would welcome the rising sun every day. No one questioned it. Sherlock rather liked it.
Sherlock was lying limp on the bed, eyes squeezed shut, mouth open and gulping air, face and neck flushed, and chest heaving. The beautiful terrain of his chest and abdomen smoothed gradually into the dip just below his hip bones, where his flushed cock lied delicately.
John, who now has three days off, is very keen to see his husband of only seven months. It sounds like he might get a pretty interesting story to write up, but the truth is that John misses Sherlock. Never mind that it's February fourteenth - they wouldn't have celebrated it anyway, but John is going to use the excuse of Sherlock's return to open one of the good bottles that Mycroft gives them every Christmas and cook something a bit more special than their usual fare. He has lamb shanks in the fridge and a recipe printed out from the internet. Sherlock won't even remember that it's Valentine's Day anyway, so John is safe to spoil him without being challenged on it.
“Expensive, was it?” John asks meanly, locking eyes with his best-friend’s brother, earning him a beat of silence and a flicker of irritation, quickly smoothed away.
The head of Sherlock’s cock sprang eagerly from the confines of the denim, hard already, causing John to lick his lips and look askance at his boyfriend.
With a deep breath, John steps away from Sherlock, his hand lingering on his back until the last possible moment which reduces the sting of it somewhat.
Sherlock spots him immediately - new jacket, barely touched tea, has been running his hands through his recently trimmed hair. Clearly nervous. Hasn't been sleeping well, has lost weight and seems to have taken some care over what he has chosen to wear. He hasn't noticed Sherlock yet though - he's looking at the clock, working out how long he should wait - how long it is acceptable to linger before his actions appear pathetic. He swipes his palms over his thighs - a habit of his when he's stressed. It’s interesting, although Sherlock would really rather it wasn't.
thirty six years old and not completely hideous. Surely it must come as no surprise.” He doesn't seem fazed at all at John's direct manner, in fact his eyes shine with intelligence and challenge.
"Because I thought I could live that life. With you gone... " He snatches a breath in the cold air and purses his lips, preparing to continue. "With you gone, I thought I could learn to love her. Be a husband. Be happy."
Regardless of their current communication issues, Sherlock is confused by what kind of a man would sit at a friend’s bedside for days on end, reading to him as he lay sedated and convalescing from a head injury, then continue as if nothing had happened when they return to their normal cohabiting routines. Surely this was an act of devotion to wait hour after hour for him to wake, and even when he had, to remain there once the immediate danger had passed and Sherlock’s consciousness had returned. He only recalls short periods of John’s absence, and even those were often to provide Sherlock with something he craved.
This is the chapter where the story gets its E rating - you can skip it if that's not your bag - I think you've got the picture.
John was hesitant about it at first, but eventually decided drugging the man before he had a psychotic break was the only way. Being a doctor had its perks. He lamented that he didn’t even feel a bit guilty, but when it finally kicked in, the silence was nirvana.
“You have to choose her. Or another like her... eventually. Your choices are limited, and maintaining our unusual physicality is the least logical course to take when the end goal is a committed long term relationship.”
Jesus, it was a shame Sherlock had never experienced anything else in the wide variety of sex that existed. Far from the ascetic he once believed Sherlock to be, it seemed in reality he was quite the opposite and the only thing holding him back was a lack of social skills. He was probably a natural at sex.
John felt Sherlock’s deep laugh reverberated in his chest, and he realized they were flush against one another. He didn’t remember when that had happened.
“By my estimation a virtual statistical zero. She is steadfastly monogamous, though not adverse to going through partners like socks.”
The memory of Sherlock’s body gripped with pleasure with his hands behind his back flash in his mind for the thousandth time. Did he have a thing for bondage maybe? Or self restraint?
“Christ, took you long enough, though,” Lestrade finally burst out. He was too far into his pints to be discreet. Molly shushed him, but he ignored her, “Everyone could tell right from the start, but John kept on with girlfriend after girlfriend.”
“Regardless...” John stepped in, “I’m happy with how things are now.” He squared off towards his army mates.
Sherlock reproachfully replaced his hand back to its original location. “It’s easier to lead with your hand higher up.”
“You’ve always treated me as a fully functional human being - mostly - despite other opinions to the contrary. Are you shocked that I am capable?”
John hesitated. His first thought was to say he wasn’t with anyone right now, but that was... not true. Not true at all. He was with Sherlock. In every way.
“Oh, goodie,” Sherlock griped, “Now we’re both frustrated. I’m not leaving. You can use the bathroom.” Now, how the bloody fuck could he tell when he hadn’t so much as looked at John for the last several hours? He was just sitting propped up against the bed’s headboard with his laptop.
“Well, he talks about sentiment like it’s some kind of disease. A weakness. He hates it when people try to flirt with him. One time, when we first met, he thought I was trying to do. He told me he was married to his work and didn’t want that sort of thing. So you see, I know that’s not on the table.”
“It wouldn’t put me off. As you noticed, reading all that stuff on the internet has me a bit hot under the collar. With the way I’m feeling right now, I’m liking the idea actually.”
Greg roared with laughter. “Can you picture him in a big billowing purple cape? I’d pay to see that.”
John was going to comment on how flirty that sounded, but was derailed by the feel of Sherlock’s tongue dragging along his shaft. And he indeed experimented on John with various techniques, utilizing his hands and lips in addition to his tongue. He tested the variation in speed, pressure, suction. He tested the sensitivity of each section of skin from the tip of his glans to underneath his balls, rubbing his prostate from the outside.
“Ok.... .... Um.... “ John had to think a moment about the conversation. “I didn’ even know if you wanked.”
Sherlock complied and John reached out to pull him gently to the bed. He settled him on his back, laid his towel to the side, and lent over him. “This ok?”
“Bollocks. You shot a man fer me on our first case, knowing me barely more’n a day. You’re special. Knew it then. Still true now.”
John situated Sherlock on one side of the bed, pulled his shoes and trousers off. No, he didn’t feel weird about pulling off the man’s trousers. For years, John has borne witness to Sherlock in various states of undress without him showing the least bit of modesty: from threadbare pajamas that clearly showed the outline of his cock, to those posh sheets, to nothing but a pair of thin pants. John started to unbutton Sherlock’s shirt as well, but when he revealed he wasn’t wearing a vest underneath, he thought it best to leave him some covering. He could suffer the wrinkles.
John inhaled carefully through his nose and exhaled through his mouth as he held onto his temper. “Please explain what you mean by that.”
At home the frequency of touching was increasing. And also decreasingly deliberate. Without thinking about it, they reached out to touch most times they came within arm’s reach. John’s fingers combed through Sherlock’s hair for a caress instead of a quick ruffle. There were kisses on the cheek for hellos and goodbyes, kisses on the forehead for goodnights and I’m sorrys. Hugs became slower and with more body contact.
No matter. It was easily dealt with. He was fully ready for a quick self-pleasure session as he re-entered his bedroom. However, it transpired that John was still there, sitting on the side of his bed, obviously working up the will power to get up.
They lay there, enjoying each other’s proximity. He wondered what Sherlock was thinking. Would he start to think about the case again now? Currently John was thinking about the fact that he could feel Sherlock’s genitals resting atop his left thigh. He never expected to know how that felt. Not bad at all, actually.
And apparently he’d wondered too long because his friend’s smile began to fade. “Ok, but why did you move all the furniture?”
Sherlock could deduce when John was in the mood for sex and would let a kiss linger longer than is chaste in order to hint that he was interested being his partner for the night - or day as it happened. John found Sherlock’s nervous but eager approach to new sexual acts endearing. And arousing. He gladly went along with exploring this part of his friend - and yes, his stamina did increase.
“I was worried this would... put you off. Make you stop... I mean, I’m not oblivious, you know. I know this isn’t how normal friends behave. It’s... it’s nonstandard...”
. John leaned his body forward, deliberately making contact with Sherlock’s pelvis and felt the tell tale bulge against his lower abdomen. He pressed against it, getting a hiss out of his dance partner.
If it had been any other person, John would have thought it possible they were either consciously or subconsciously showing their attraction and interest in more sex. But this was Sherlock. And really, it just figured. One thing that really rubbed Sherlock the wrong way was the illogic of social protocol.
“Sides... Ya know, now I think about it... I haven’ acted like that in ages. But it DOES make it impossible to pull when every’ne thinks ’m already taken.”
“I’m aware that it appears that way from an outside perspective. Were I to deduce information from our interactions as a third party, I would most likely come to that conclusion. That aside, there is more telling evidence to support it. I’ve allowed myself to become vulnerable. Several times now, criminals have used you to get to me. And they were correct that it is a weak point. Yet I don’t try to eliminate it. That is, I believe, a clear example of sentiment. I’m not suppressing it. However, I have been wary of showing it outwardly. As for what I want... I told you. I prefer things how they are.”
“No, she heard us. Baked celebratory scones the next day, looking pleased as can be. Why are you all so determined to shove us together?”
John bent his head to kiss his friend’s cheek, then again closer to his ear, and then nuzzled into his neck. He smoothed his hand down his chest as he rubbed his lips here and there. Sherlock grasped his head and brought their lips together just as John’s hand slid down the grasp his smooth balls. “Mmmf.”
“I’m not promising anything. I’m just telling you how I feel. Either one of us could change in time. It happens and it could be complete shit if it does. That’s life. No guarantees. Things are good now. Great, actually. Assuming that an unhappy ending is inevitable just ruins what we have now.”
Murray spoke, “Every time I read your blog, it always sounded like you had a bit of a crush on him. How’d you talk him round to your side, Sherlock?”
John surveyed the group with drunken sentimentality. He’d managed to find some pretty decent friends.
After a couple of days, Sherlock started getting anxious. Perhaps he had come to the same conclusion that John had done? Or maybe he was just reacting to John’s strange behavior.
Choosing a relationship with someone like Ava and in turn stripping his relationship with Sherlock felt even more repellent than before. But would he be happy if he never chose a partner? If he stayed living his life with Sherlock, would he long for romance? Would he be lonely?
“I want to see you come. God, Sherlock, I’m so hard.” John licked him at his opening and reveled in the deep groan that fell from Sherlock’s lips. He licked and licked. He massaged his prostate and kept licking and kissing and didn’t stop until the other man was desperate and shaking.
Then there was his behavior. John worried that he was stereotyping now that he had an indication that Sherlock was possibly gay. Maybe. But it seemed that his friend’s mannerisms and speech had become just a bit more... feminine? Possibly. He wasn’t sure. Was he seeing things? Or was the man just posh? He kept these thoughts to himself.
Because he realized that no one he’d ever been with made him feel as cared for as Sherlock Holmes. God, imagine that. A man he’d thought would never let himself be close to anyone, was the person who made him feel the most loved.
“Oh, have I been? What’s that then?” John was admittedly a little slow on the uptake. He’d blame the wine.
Decided to break up the last chapter into two because my beta has a life. Hopefully the last half will be finished soon.
“I...” John decided to just roll with is. “Yeah, sure.” And he proceeded to the shower where he indeed had a lovely wank thanks to his adrenaline high.
“I should be used to you manhandling me by now,” John grumbled, but relented to being turned and to having his back half given the same treatment. He wasn’t really put out. It felt rather nice, actually. Sherlock’s fingers combed through his hair and then his lips were on the back of his neck. He had a suspicion he was also being sniffed. Typical.
