And with that thought, he made his way towards the bar.
Dean's naked body is wrapped around mine, covered in dried blood but breathing. I didn't kill him. For some reason, I'm relieved about that.
"We'll see," he decides. "Haven't really had company in a while," he says and a smug smirk tugs at his lips. "You really are unlucky though, I was about to let you go but you just didn't leave... And I can't exactly let you wander around knowing who I am."
"Hey, dude, you okay?" the man from beside him asked curiously and Cas turned his head towards him. He was still standing where he stood before, his book open in his hands, but he was now staring at Cas with raised eyebrows. It was obvious he was talking to him.
Dean would never admit that he was pouting.
The door closed behind me and I looked around nervously, taking in his apartment. It was similar to ours but cleaner -I never got around to tidying up and Mom was always at work- and there was a painting on the wall. Apart from that, the flats were about the same.
There was a voice Castiel didn't quite recognize. It was weirdly familiar. He couldn't put a face to it though...
I stayed with Castiel whenever Mom wasn't there -which was often- and I even stopped eating at home in general, not wanting to waste Mom's food. Castiel had assured me that he earned enough to support us both without it having negative consequences for him. I was unbelievably thankful that he did that for me.
able to read minds, especially his? He would die for sure. That'd mean Dean knew all about his crush on him, the patheticness of his pining and the idiotic happiness he felt whenever Dean as much as glanced at him.
He gripped the counter even harder. His knees were getting a little weak.
On the other hand, though, it would probably the most memorable. So he leaned in anyway. When his lips finally touched Dean's, he decided that yeah, it was definitely not the best place to kiss, but none of that mattered when Dean returned the sentiment and kissed back with all he had.
"I'm afraid I can't do that," I say, voice icy, and I honestly can't remember when I've ever been this angry at someone. Alastair, naked, hanging from the ceiling in Dean's basement, beaten and bloody and just
I shifted uncomfortably.
When they parted, Dean didn't let go of him.
Dean's eyes turned darker. Bingo.
And Dean and Cas were alone once again.
he texted back.
Castiel blinked, twice. Dean wanted to watch a movie?
I couldn't do anything but nod.
good to see you!" he lies, drops of sweat forming on his forehead. "Listen, if you can just get me out of here, I'll never bother you again, I'll give you money, however much you want okay, just get me out, please," he begs, seeing something in my eyes that scares him. He's down on his luck though, trying to save himself with pathetic deals. But deep inside he knows it won't work.
Dean didn't care all that much that he'd slept with a guy. He'd freaked out about it at first, of course, but once he'd gotten over himself and googled around for some information, he'd reluctantly accepted that he was bisexual and dealt with it.
"I haven't known you for all that long," I decided to say. "But you're one of the few people in my life who seem to care about me, for whatever reason. And maybe, one day, you will be able to love me. It doesn't matter which way. And I will wait until then."
"I should--"
He remembered all the little things Dean had done for him, like lending him stuff, somehow instinctively knowing when he'd need something -- and if it was a pencil. Not even a word would leave Castiel's mouth and Dean would just know. He would turn around, graze him with a gentle, amused smile and simply hold out his pencil for Castiel to take.
do that to you," Dean promised sincerely, staring into Castiel's eyes.
"I suppose I should go," Cas decided, locking gazes with Dean. "I will see you when it is over, hopefully."
"Wh-what...? What do you mean,
Suddenly, there was the sound of a door being opened and someone outside left their apartment, apparently annoyed by the shouting in the hallway.
Castiel stayed where he was and curiously watched him come closer.
be protected from any repercussions, but none of them could be sure. It was pretty likely that all the robots who were living their fake life in peace were gonna collapse as soon as his chair leg hit the machine.
boy," he said. "And you're gonna be even better with my cock inside of you," he promised and pulled his fingers out of my hole, making me clench around nothing uncomfortably.
for transporting human beings at this stage; I won't get out of there alive!" he spit out the words, just barely keeping himself from yelling. He knew that shouting at Amara would do him more harm than good; she was cruel enough as it was. But he was angry so who cared? "Who authorized this?" he then asked and crossed his arms in defense.
It was driving Dean crazy.
Like before, Castiel showed the object to the camera, set it down in the teleporter and pressed the button without much hesitancy. The human tooth was fine.
"I had a little help building it, too. Mostly through reassurances and motivational words, but it was what I needed the most at the time and that's why I want to thank Dean Winchester for helping me whenever he could. So, thank you, Dean," he said and Dean smirked, holding up both his thumbs. Castiel was doing amazing.
"What do you mean you sleep in one bed?" I asked, hurrying after him. Dean only looked at me as if the answer was obvious, which left me even more confused, but before I could say anything he joked, "It means you'll have a bed to sleep in instead of a couch, you idiot." Then he left.
Not quite sure what to think, Dean set the vase down at the edge of his desk, making some space for himself and getting to work. It was probably nothing after all, just a gesture of respect maybe. Dean didn't know. Castiel was a little weird after all.
He woke up to lowered voices.
The world explodes in a burst of colors, red and blue and green dancing across the room, and the relief and happiness I feel intensifies even more. My body arches into the other one, jerking violently as if I'm having a fit, when the beautiful man comes himself and holds me close, riding out his orgasm inside of me.
"Just one," Castiel replied, flushing a little at Dean's smirk. "I barely believe it myself."
"You must be Castiel," I said.
Taking off my clothes eagerly, I climbed onto the bed, waiting for Dean to come in a few minutes later, and he did, finally, closing the door behind him.
"I'm, uh, I'm working on two things, actually. Have been for a while... The first one is a solar powered outlet. You attach it to a window and if it's day, you have electricity," Castiel started, growing a little more relaxed. Work was safe territory for him. "I'm almost done, though, it shouldn't take me long to figure out the last kinks."
"I'm sure of it," he said. His eyes lit up all of a sudden. "Hey, you think you can give me a demonstration?"
pull me into this. I have a life outside of work, okay, and I promised my wife and daughter that I'd be home in time for dinner, which, thanks to you, I probably won't be anymore. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be back tomorrow morning to help you any way I can if you're still here. Until then, stay out of my way."
"You're right," Castiel said, taking Dean by surprise, and looked to the left in fake contemplation. "I could've asked Gabriel, I guess. But if I wanted to impress my family, he probably wouldn't be the best choice," he decided.
"Oh God, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to stumble into you," the boy says hurriedly, embarrassment staining his cheeks.
And that was when Castiel realized that something about this conversation was entirely wrong.
would he do that to you?" he continued, anger taking over once again. It seemed like the only thing he was doing lately was get mad at people -- or one person in particular. He scrambled into a sitting position. "I'm gonna fucking kill that bastard," Dean promised, about to climb out of bed.
The second time is just as bad. My pleading screams are hoarse and loud sobs break into them while Dean's cock continuously penetrates my hole again and again. I hate the helpless feeling of arousal in my gut. I don't want to like this.
"Okay," she said and laid her hand down on the button. Before pressing it, she said, "Dean... Be careful."
is great about those pills.
I look around carefully. There's an uncomfortable looking bed, a pot that's probably supposed to serve as a toilet and a desk with a chair. The small window I can spot at the end of the room is high up and not big enough for a person to fit through.
Slowly, my other senses come back to me, I'm feeling again but it's damped. There's some kind of pressure in me I feel now, something's
"Yes. But it's too late now. You're going out with Alfie because I was too much of a coward to admit it. I wasn't ready."
Dean groaned, too, then, but it was more from
Castiel couldn't help but let out a snort at that.
"Good," Dean said, but he was sobering quickly. He knew he needed to have the talk soon, but everything in himself resisted and he couldn't get the words out. So, he ended up staring at Castiel in indecision.
Castiel thought and then he
He looked around curiously while the men dragged him through a small door on the side and down a narrow hallway. Dirty white walls were everything Cas could see.
Because in the end, no matter how much Castiel had changed me, how much he'd manipulated and hurt me; in the end, I'd do anything for him...
"Seriously?" he said. "You don't believe your own
Using the now perfectly well working elevator, Castiel rode up to second floor and walked towards his 'laboratory', as he called it. The teleporter, a big machine consisting of two identical parts and a console, was already waiting for him, impatient to be used again. Castiel was convinced the teleporter itself wanted to succeed just as much as he did -- not that Castiel would ever say that out loud to anybody. It made him sound crazy.
than the pleasure of an orgasm.
Dean lets me sob into his thigh quietly.
"Well, I was used to it. I was always the calm one, so I rarely got involved in any fights. I also have a sister, who I get along with great."
"I'm gonna get rid of the tracker," Sam then explained, his mouth still half-full, and picked up the device in question from where it was still lying on the living room table. Dean hummed in response, not seeming all that interested in the whole thing. "Don't expect me back for a few hours," he said and waved at Cas with a smile on his face, leaving the house with a, "See you later, guys."
to be my teacher, pleasuring me like he'd pleasured me two days ago, no matter the consequences. All I had to do was keep quiet anyway.
"Garth broke his legs," he explained and Castiel's eyebrows shot in the air.
"Part one of the test was more than successful," he said, smiling. "Now part two, the human tooth."
Maybe Dean had spoiled him too much. But he was his baby boy, what was he supposed to do,
he continued and Castiel didn't waste any time jumping into Dean's dumpster and trying to rip the book out of his hands in a panic. "
"Of course," he promised, ready to do everything in his power to help Sam.
"Number one, how do they make such perfect copies of real people? They gotta get their information from somewhere. Number two, how -or better, where- do they replace people with robots without being obvious? And number three, how does no one notice the difference between robot and human? Those people gotta have friends or something, who would definitely notice if their friend was replaced by a robot behaving like Cas. No offense, man!" Dean said, smirking at Cas, and Cas nodded solemnly. He hadn't taken offense -- he
Castiel didn't wait long to start riding him and soon, their moans were indistinguishable from one another. Dean pulled Castiel into another heated kiss and bucked up into him over and over again, chasing his orgasm in desperation. Castiel was pretty close as well, Dean could tell, and he just hoped he would outlast him for a few seconds. Dean picked up the pace of his thrusts.
He didn't.
, and what it was like to still have him in his life. How well he'd seemed to fit in.
, Metatron thought sarcastically.
Sam shut him up before he could even voice his thoughts. "We're not interested in your sci-fi
"I never fell off a stupid ladder," he admitted cheekily and smirked when Castiel's face contorted into a confused frown. "I also never had any back pains. I just wanted to mess wit customer service and get a nice laugh out of it," he continued contently.
"That wasn't very nice of you," Castiel said, his frown deepening, but he didn't step away from Dean.
"Would you... give me a second chance?" Dean asked hopefully. "And join me for dinner some time? When we're back home?"
There it was. No taking it back now. Castiel would leave after this amazing date and find someone else, and Dean would go home to Jack and keep living like he had been before. It was better this way.
before. He wondered who had sent them.
She stopped all of a sudden, eyes widening and staring at something behind him. "Oh dear," she muttered in disbelief and then a smile was tugging at her lips. Castiel turned around.
Dean slowly smirked at him, a knowing look on his face, and Castiel blinked. He'd taken too long to answer, he realized.
"Yes, sadly. My boss only told me today... You two will be fine though, won't you?" she asked, sounding worried herself, but Dean calmed her down quickly.
But it's the danger that's so thrilling about this. It's the danger both Dean and I seek.
. But don't worry, I'll fix it for you. Luckily, we're surrounded by dumpsters!" he laughed and Castiel immediately realized what he was going to do.
Castiel was dying of embarrassment.
, little bro," Dean countered.
The knowledge alone should have been enough for Castiel. He could simply walk away now, knowing Dean wouldn't be able to rape anyone tonight -- or at least not as easily. But something in Castiel was reluctant to go. It's not that Dean was attractive enough for Castiel to be able to overlook the attempted rape and let himself be fucked anyway -even though, admittedly, it was part of it-, it was also that Castiel's pride was hurt. Had Dean genuinely believed Castiel would fall for that little distraction and let himself be drugged as easily as this? Well, bad luck for him because Castiel had certainly been in enough clubs to know what to pay attention to.
"Give us two weeks before you give up on us," he said. "If we're not back by then, we're probably dead."
They formed a quick friendship. Whenever Dean Winchester was seen during senior year, Castiel Novak was sure to be close, and after a while, people just knew to expect them together wherever they walked.
"What is it?" Cas asked and he seemed alarmed. He probably didn't know about it either.
Even though Dean knew better, he agreed to another date. He knew it would have been smarter to end it before Castiel got too invested, but it had just been such a nice evening and Dean had felt so understood and accepted, and he'd still been raw from their talk about Jack, so really, there was no way he could have said no. Besides, it would work itself out as soon as Castiel met Jack because Jack had never liked anyone Dean had dated in his life. He sincerely doubted that Castiel would be the exception.
"What time is it?" I asked a little uneasily. It was a Saturday, which meant I had to be at work at ten. And if it was eight already, that'd give me the perfect reason to leave.
Dean sighed. It was gonna be a long night, he believed.
Frowning, Dean glanced over at Castiel to check if he was still looking away. When he was, Dean's eyes snapped back to the burger in his hands, slowly and almost involuntarily inching it towards his mouth, when suddenly--
"Please!"
I desperately wanna be a part of that life.
Still confused, he shook it off with some effort and continued down the hallway. It most likely didn't mean anything anyway.
But to be honest, I am beginning to think Dean taking advantage of me isn't even the worst thing there is. The loneliness and boredom while being alone is slowly driving me crazy and I'm starting to crave human touch like I used to crave hamburgers. So whenever Dean comes downstairs to fuck, I can't help but take, take, take.
"Yeah, it was," Dean agreed hesitantly. "Jack seemed to like you."
Just like the previous 432 times, a beam shot out of the opening of the teleporter and dipped the toy in blue light. Electricity was crackling, sparks flying, and just a second later, the car had disappeared. A short while after, the other part of the machine came to life. The same blue light shot out of the top and aimed downwards, making the whole room glow brightly. Electricity, sparks, and all of a sudden, the car was there.
"Besides," Dean started, speaking with a full mouth, successfully gaining Cas's full attention again, "it's not every day you find a robot walking the streets. 'S normal to be curious."
They climbed into the teleporter. "Let's hope this thing works," Jimmy muttered, not really calming their nerves, and Castiel reached out to hold Dean's hand. Dean squeezed it shortly and they smiled at each other one last time.
"Dude, just because he doesn't
"I don't want you to talk to him again. Do so and we're over... And you know that I'm the one for you," Castiel said confidently. My eyes filled with silent tears. He couldn't make me do this, could he? He couldn't make me choose. I already lost so much. I lost my own mother.
"Tattoos," was all he said when Castiel raised an eyebrow in question.
"Are you serious, Asstiel? You're writing about your grades?" Michael continued mocking him. "What else are you writing about? Girls? Oh wait, I forgot. You're strictly into dick."
Dean stared. Why did this man have to be so obnoxiously, amazingly wonderful, and why couldn't Dean just be gay?
Because Amara was doing an amazing job of ruining that for him.
"It's not about whether you
"Would you, um..." Dean continued. "Would you maybe, uuh... God, I don't know how to say this," Dean stuttered on and since Castiel felt rather sorry for him, he decided to relieve him of this torture.
, he thought sarcastically.
"C-Castiel Novak," Castiel stuttered, flustered, trying to get control of himself and his visibly awestruck face again.
"Don't act like you care," Dean muttered and his voice sounded even worse than he felt. He swallowed against the disgusting taste in his mouth.
"The teleporter
"Hey Cas?" Dean asked one time when they were lying in bed after a thorough sex session, cuddled together like lovers. Dean had been tracing Castiel's tattoos with his fingers but stopped now to glance up at him from under his lashes.
We're kind of cuddling the rest of the time, naked bodies wrapped around the other desperately while Dean keeps talking about stuff I can't remember. If I had to take a guess, I'd say it was about something intimate. Probably some 'confiding in the one that won't remember most of the night' thing.
Content with his decision, Castiel leaned back against the couch and turned to watch Dean at the bar. He'd just gotten the drink handed to him from the bartender and was obviously looking for something in his jacket pocket, not finding it.
Dean: "THIS ISN'T FUNNY, SAMMY!"
? Seriously?" he asked, spitting out the hateful name. Castiel tilted his head, not giving anything away.
"Cas? What's going on?" a familiar voice behind him said and Castiel turned around in surprise. His eyes were puffy and red, tears still staining his face, as he met Dean's worried gaze. Fuck, of course it was gonna be Dean. Of course
When I eventually wake up, I feel thirsty. So very thirsty.
Dean with come leaking out of his hole.
He knew what picture Dean was looking at. It was the first one he'd taken, of Castiel shoving his tongue down Dean's throat, both with cum-covered faces.
He smiled in response.
Neither of us said a word throughout the whole thing, and when Castiel came, it was with a low moan and a shudder. His come splattered all over the washing machine and the floor, him not seeming all that bothered by it. I was still staring at him, his dick becoming flaccid slowly now that he was finished, and I still couldn't move. I watched him take off his boxers now, too, wiping away his come with it and then throwing it into the machine.
When he pressed the button, the machine came to life and I was ripped from my stupor violently.
Jimmy only laughed. "If you say so. But you do need a break," he decided. "So let's grab a bite to eat and then you tell me about your life in that other dimension."
"Dean," Castiel says again, more insistently. "Please open up, you're scaring me."
"Go nuts," he said and handed it to Dean. Looking at him with raised eyebrows, Dean turned his gaze to the phone in his hands... and froze.
"Nobody did, Castiel, I
"Where the hell did you disappear to?" he said angrily, grabbing Cas's arm and pulling him towards the van while waiting for an answer.
"Okay," Sam said, taking his last few notes, and then sent Dean a meaningful glance. Dean nodded.
"Well,
His heart starts pounding with fear when he realizes he's lost him, and he feels sick to his stomach. What if somebody got to him and Castiel is getting beaten up right this second? Dean was supposed to protect him!
"I-- I don't know. I mean, I've been thinking about it for a while and it's just... We were eating dinner a few days ago and I looked at him and he smiled and... suddenly I had this feeling that I had to do something, you know? I mean... it's been
Dean snorted in disbelief but let it slide and turned his attention back to his TV show. Cas sat at the table and stared at his hands.
', just remember that whoever is behind all of this managed to build perfect robot copies of persons, so why the hell
All of a sudden, I noticed a movement out of the corner of my eye. It was Castiel's hand wandering over to his white boxers determinedly, cupping his obvious erection and slowly stroking it through the cloth. He let out a small moan and I felt my breathing becoming shallow.
Something in the back of my head screams.
He somehow doesn't want that. He wants to share this whole mess with someone. Even if this someone is the cause for all of it.
It didn't seem like the rain was going to stop anytime soon and even though Cas didn't feel things like coldness, he was a little bothered by the moisture on his skin. It felt slippery.
I let him use me like a toy.
When I looked at Benny next, his eyes were still fixed on Castiel and he had a suspicious glimmer in his eyes. They instantly disliked each other, that much was obvious.
Dean stared back in reluctant wonder. Then he said, "You're no fun," and turned around to walk back to the couch. Cas looked back down at the cube with a small smile and began mixing the colors up again so he could start anew.
teleporter," she ordered and all of a sudden her voice was ice-cold, the pretence of false friendliness completely disappeared. It was eerily quiet for a few seconds, in which Castiel could only stare at Amara in disbelief. She wouldn't let it go, he realized. She really would make him test his own invention on himself.
Fact was though, the flowers were beautiful and no matter who had sent them or with what intentions, the effect was still the same. Dean's mood was already improving at the thought of somebody caring enough to send him some.
"Ahhh..." Dean sighed when he was done, reveling in the feeling of
I didn't hear Dean come up to me, but suddenly, he was there, his arms wrapping around my waist from behind and his nose burying itself in my hair, inhaling deeply. My knees got a little wobbly.
we might end up
I didn't reply and pulled the covers over my head instead, shielding myself from the outside world. Dean wasn't actually
"Hey! I was gonna eat that!" Dean exclaimed when the burger was ripped from his grip and thrown to the floor by an unamused looking Castiel.
Then he'd tell me to stop worrying. So I would.
The first few hours after Jimmy had left, Castiel buried himself in work. He inspected the teleporter and wrote down everything he saw; how much progress Jimmy had already made, what materials and settings he'd used; just everything Castiel would need to know if he wanted to get back home. The outcome was frustrating more than anything.
"We were just talking about this beautiful piece of jewelry," Cas said teasingly and held up his hand, smirking up at Dean. Dean let out a breathless laugh when he saw the ring and promptly leaned down and --
The only sounds filling the room were the commercial in the background and the clicking of the cube. Dean watched Cas work with rapt attention, seemingly fascinated by the way Cas worked.
They walked to the store. It wasn't all that far away after all, and Sam had taken Baby to check out the hospital -- which, honestly, Dean couldn't even mope about because it meant he'd gotten out of researching again. So walking it was.
"And because you made such a mess on my floor, I'll make you lick up your own cum while I pound you from behind a second time," Dean continued, as if he hadn't just slipped a date rape drug into his fucking drink.
Castiel set his jaw at that, biting back the words on the tip of his tongue. Amara had no idea how complicated his invention worked, how much more time this
and I have a
"Don't worry about it." He looked down on his notes. "What happened after the van?"
Without hesitation, Dean stepped into the teleporter.
"What are you doing?" he asked sweetly, his voice muffled by my hair, and I gulped, feeling tense.
"No," the man answered. "No, we're definitely in the right place," he announced cryptically and Inias
Castiel stilled in fear.
"I really like you, too," he replied quietly, and a shy smile appeared on Dean's face before he hid it in Castiel's armpit in embarrassment. Castiel laughed loudly at Dean's antics and scratched his head affectionately, which made Dean melt into him even more.
Cas looks at me contemplatingly for a while, until he slowly says, "I might have..."
"What is it, Dean?" he muttered and I was speechless for a second. Castiel didn't seem surprised or bothered by seeing me in his bed, apparently he didn't regret last night or think it was weird. I didn't know if I should be glad or scared.
"Maybe we should-" Dean started a few minutes later. "Maybe we should go upstairs now."
Dean groaned and hid his face in his hands. "You're unbelievable," he mumbled and rubbed at his eyes tiredly. Then he decided, "I'm making us pancakes and you'll fucking enjoy them, 'kay?"
Benny stopped texting me, too, hurt by my blatant refusal to talk to him and intimidated by Castiel's insistence for him to leave me alone.
"Mhh, that's really good pie," I exclaimed surprisedly after taking the first bite and humming contently. Even Mom's pies didn't taste as good! I wondered where he'd gotten it from.
Castiel’s face morphed into a watery smile. "Of course I will, Dean," he said and pulled him into a relieved hug. Dean held on tightly, happiness seeping into every corner of his being.
I weigh the blade in my hands and step closer, feeling Dean's presence right behind me the whole time. I look up. The guy is jerking on the ropes again, trying to get away from me, humming loudly in fear, but I ignore it all pointedly. This man deserves no mercy.
The man does nothing like that though and only buries his hand in my hair, slightly pulling on it. It doesn't hurt but it's not feeling very comfortable either.
He turned me around, pressing my face against the cold metal of the refrigerator, and shoved my pants down to my knees. He fucked me quickly, bringing me to an orgasm as well as himself and wiped away our cum with paper towels. He pulled my pants back up, closed them without a word and left me leaning against the fridge, feeling sorry for myself.
Dean thought, forehead wrinkling in confusion. He wondered what was up with that.
omething
Dean didn't seem to be feeling any better at his words. Instead, his breathing sped up slightly and his eyes became wet with tears. "So, have you -- been with other people then?" he forced out and Castiel could actually see just how much it hurt Dean to say it.
The door fell shut behind him.
Castiel couldn't help but smile.
The next day, Dean was in a horrible mood. Castiel and Balthazar had left early for the wedding, having decided to help with the preparations, and Dean was left alone sulking in his dorm room. Sadly enough, Dean didn't have any plans for the day, meaning it was even harder not to think about what Castiel and Balthazar might be doing in the meantime. Had Balthazar kissed him on the lips yet? Would he? Were they holding hands and leaning into each other's sides? Were people telling them what a cute couple they were?
"I mean the teleporting machine that
Even though Jimmy had been working on the teleporter for far longer than Castiel, Jimmy's invention was clearly behind his. The man hadn't even changed the material of the teleporter, which was about the first thing Castiel had done when he realized that regular iron would end up dissolving. Castiel would have to replace about half of the machine to get it up to his standards. It was unbelievable, really.
, he told himself.
I stayed silent.
!" he demanded.
Oh. I'm chained to the sink.
Dean forgot to lock it.
with him? He wasn't the one with the crush!
"I have an idea. If you come home with me, I could try to fix that problem you have with getting stuck and help you figure out what you are," he offered. "In return, I'd like you to answer some questions for me. Sound like a deal?"
He just adds to my beginning insanity.
"When I first realized I was gay, I was freaking out, too. Admittedly, it wasn't as bad as it was for you, but I was so scared and confused and I didn't know what to do either. But it gets better, I promise. And one day you won't even remember why you were freaking out about it in the first place."
Without thinking, he turns his head towards Castiel and dives in for a real kiss.
He stares down at me, his gaze intense. I can't bring myself to look away. "But you didn't," Dean concludes. "You're special."
"He's not," I protested, knowing that I was wrong but not wanting to admit it. Castiel was wonderful most of the time, just every once in a while he said stuff that hit me hard.
"Just a little more patience," Dean said, winked at me, and then proceeded to cover his dick with lube. He positioned the smooth head at my entrance and I sobbed needily. "Please, Dean, please," I panted, wiggling my ass against his dick, drawing a moan out from him. "Please fuck me," I begged him.
I set my jaw, suppressing my anger. This was not the way I'd wanted dinner to go. I'd wanted to eat delicious steaks and have some sex afterwards, was that too much to ask?
Nope, still not a morning person.
He shook his head in reply.
To be honest, Dean isn't even surprised by this turn of events - his panic attack has been a long time coming, he knows that, and ignoring the problem has probably only made it worse. He just couldn't deal with the reality... But it's too late now anyway. He just hopes somebody will find him when he eventually passes out.
"Please don't touch anything," Sam said, more as a precaution than anything else, because Cas hadn't moved a single finger since sitting down. "It's just that this is my brother's car and he
The beautiful face now comes down on me and kisses me, tongue invading my mouth immediately. All of my senses are heightened and it feels so fucking amazing I can't help but kiss back, a moan leaving my mouth without warning. I suck on the man's tongue eagerly and pull him closer, the sound of our combined groans filling the air. The world is still a mix of glowing colors.
Besides, the pills make Dean somewhat easier to read and it's reassuring to know what he's thinking every once in a while.
"Stop teasing me, asshole," Cas ended the conversation, shoving Dean's shoulder playfully, and then shifted on the table, so he was lying down, resting his head in Dean's lap. He closed his eyes contently, humming when Dean started stroking his hair, and smiled.
"Every once in a while. I'm no chef though."
Dean and Castiel were having lunch in the college's cafeteria -they had surprisingly good food-, when Dean noticed his sworn arch enemy walking right up to them from afar.
Ten minutes later I am sitting down on the couch with a bowl of noodles, contently taking a random book from the shelf and starting to read. It's been a while since I've had a book in my hands and I'm cozy and feeling so very different than downstairs. I wonder if I have to go back once Dean returns. I don't want to. But I'll probably have to, because no matter what, I can't leave Dean either. He's everything I still know.
"I--I'd like that," he breathed out and Dean's lips kept slowly kissing their way towards Castiel's mouth. Castiel didn't dare breathing.
"You did great, baby. Keep that up and I might let you take a shower tomorrow. I made the right decision keeping you," he decides and turns away, leaving me with my face burning in a twisted kind of pride and embarrassment.
"You have
Dean only nodded and Castiel left for the bedroom where his phone was still lying on the bedside table. Grabbing it, he pulled up the pictures from last night and headed back into the kitchen.
Dean picked up after the second ring.
"You want to pretend that we're... in a relationship?" I ask, just to make sure, and Cas nods quietly.
"Oh, would you now?" Castiel asked and smiled expectantly. "As far as I've seen, Balthazar has been good to me."
"Try anything and I'll kill you," Dean warns me before we leave the room but his voice doesn't have its usual edge to it. I didn't even realize that this would be the perfect opportunity to try and escape. I'm too used to being captured by now, I guess.
He had Cas's face.
"Really?" Lisa asks, just as excited as Jess seems to be. "But he's, like, the shiest guy ever! Oh god, they'd be so cute together," she gushes.
Dean's eyes widened in disbelief and he sent another alarmed glance at Cas. Then, he set his jaw, grabbed Sam by his shirt sleeve and pulled him with him into the kitchen. Sam yelled in protest but went with him nevertheless.
For some reason, educating Cas on the subject of sophisticated medical dramas had made him decide to teach him about other stuff as well, his first and foremost being his Baby.
"My name's Castiel, by the way," the boy introduces himself when they're done picking up books, and Dean looks up for a second despite himself. His gaze gets caught by bright blue eyes.
Not sensing or simply ignoring my unease, Dean tousled my hair playfully and I wasn't sure whether I imagined it or not, but his hand lingered a little longer than it probably should've.
Tonight wasn't any different. Getting himself a cocktail in an intense blue color and taking a sip, he spotted a few couches at the other end of the room. Knowing that this was exactly his kind of place, he started walking towards them.
Cas mumbled a quiet, "Thank you, sir," and followed the man's description down the hallway. He turned left and stopped at the third door, glancing around to make sure there was nobody else around. Then he looked down at the door. There was a small keyboard at the right and an instruction to type in a 'fifteen letter password'.
I realized that Castiel had been right all along. I was nothing but a burden, an unwanted roommate, eating her food and not paying rent. It didn't matter that I worked my ass off at Bobby's because the little amount that it got me wasn't nearly enough to support even one of us.
It didn't matter that Dean had said no. It didn't matter that she
"Wow," Dean said from behind him with barely contained awe in his voice. Castiel turned in his direction and was greeted with an excited, mind-blowing grin. "That was so freaking
It all started with this.
On the other hand, though, Dean's heart sank. He had wanted Jack to dislike Castiel, so he could use that as an excuse not to go on another date with Castiel. Now that Jack liked him, he had to actually tell Castiel that he couldn't date him because he was straight. And he couldn't bear the thought of hurting him. Castiel was so kind-hearted and just... so absolutely awesome. He’d have to make it right soon.
! Stupid thing.
"I'm Sam, Dean's brother," I introduced myself and Cas took my hand immediately. His grip was tighter than I'd have expected for somebody this nervous.
"After," he decided. "Definitely after." And with that, he finally, finally pressed his lips against Dean's.
"So..." Castiel repeated. Neither of them really seemed to know what to say. Awkward silence stretched between them.
bring a robot into our home without asking me first or knowing any of its intentions? He could be dangerous, Sammy! Hell, he
"This is test number 433," Castiel said at the beginning, just like every time. He had to admit his job was rather monotonous sometimes but he still loved everything about it. "The test objects are a red toy car, a human tooth and a caged rat."
But then, a single moment before I came, Castiel wrapped his hand around the base of my cock tightly, successfully preventing me from coming hard. I sobbed loudly, not able to hold it in.
you need to tell me?" Metatron asked, anger lacing his voice.
"Come on," Dean announced, grabbing Cas by his elbow on instinct and not letting go. He apparently knew where he was going, so Cas followed behind him more or less willingly, all the while watching the other customers curiously. Some of them seemed to be in a hurry and cursed when they saw the long line at the checkout. Others didn't seem to mind as much and took their time looking around. Cas hoped Dean and him counted to the latter ones. Cas had decided he didn't like being under pressure.
It was the only explanation.
And what else could Dean do but give it to him when faced with this challenge?
He was silently panting for a few minutes before he pulled me on top of him, kissing me another time and then taking in my wrecked body, cum dripping out of my ass. His look filled with lust all over again when he saw that and he quickly picked up something lying next to him. It was a butt plug, and even though I had no idea where it came from, I felt weirdly thrilled when I saw it.
"Because it's too much, Dean!" Castiel exclaimed, effectively rendering Dean speechless for a second. "It's simply too much... You're always so kind to everyone and I don't want to take advantage of that, because you're important to me," he explained, sounding genuine.
"Thanks." And with that, Dean left for the kitchen while Castiel headed for the TV.
When he'd told Jack that he was gonna be bringing a date home this weekend, Jack had simply nodded and avoided the topic for the rest of the week. That was how he usually reacted. Jack didn't like when he went on dates.
Cas nodded again, turning back to look at the screen. "So that's why Dr. Sexy is making out with Dr. Hale right now? Because he's grieving?" he asked, not quite sure if he got it right, and Dean nodded.
It's obvious.
I was full on crying now, sobbing in relief and exhaustion, and Castiel pulled me closer, caressing my back slowly.
" he exclaimed as cold terror began to fill him. Castiel couldn't be dead, he couldn't be! His heart began to race. "What do you mean, he died, tell me what happened,
Dean adds two more cuts then, one on my other arm and one running from my heart to my belly button. I am beginning to look the way I want.
, and I still didn't care.
"Oooh," he says and a sweet smile steals on his face. "Well, did you like it?"
was gonna happen there. If we assume that the hospital is involved in everything, we can answer question number one pretty easily -- where do they get their information. Hospitals have lots of information about their patients. They might have CT or MRI scans that help with building similar bodies, they could've put up cameras for pictures to copy a perfect face, they know the whole medical histories and everything! If a patient's limping for example? Then it's important to have the robot limp, too. Get what I mean?" Dean asked, eyes sparkling happily, and Sam blinked in surprise.
theories, Dean," he scolded him and Dean looked away from the table, pouting.
I gulped nervously before answering, aware of the fact that the hallway was empty apart from us. "Uh... Yeah," I said, not knowing what Castiel was getting at.
-- and then he walked inside.
better boyfriend than Balthazar."
"God, you're so fucking hot," Castiel muttered and let his hands roam underneath Dean's shirt, caressing his stomach, tweaking his nipples. It seemed to be driving Dean crazy.
," he announced, glad that Cas seemingly shared his love for Dr. Sexy MD. "We can watch it tomorrow, if you want to. What do you think?"
different, according to Dean- when he realized he didn't have any of the ingredients left. And logically, instead of maybe realizing that baking three pies was enough for one afternoon, Dean decided that they had to go grocery shopping instead. For all Dean knew, it was simply another great opportunity to show Cas how to live.
"I haven't done anything yet, but I know what the problem is. I just gotta go and get some tools," he assured him. "I'll be back in a minute." And with those words, he disappeared.
Inias frowned. "What do you mean the robot's not there?" he asked, glancing at Metatron, who, at his words, was already starting to fume again. "You have to be in the wrong place," he insisted.
. Fuck, Cas, you're a genius," he groaned and couldn't help but wrap a hand around his dick, which was hidden from Castiel's view but undoubtedly hard.
"What else could I have meant?" Castiel asked, bewildered, but Dean just shook his head in amusement and opened the door wider for Castiel to step in.
The man had just been about to teach him how to make pecan pie -as opposed to cherry pie, which they had made earlier that day and which was something
He'd have to make somebody take care of it some day...
"Believe me, if I was gay, I'd go out with you in a second!" he assured him, but Castiel just shook his head and turned away, a clear indication for Dean to leave. His disappointment was visible in the sagging of his shoulders.
And finally Meg looked up at him. "Want the short story or the long story?"
spend together," Castiel said, winked at Dean playfully and then turned around and left.
"Oh, I'm fine," Dean replied. "I've been working on my car a lot lately, so I'm as happy as they come," he announced, grinning. Immediately, Castiel was bombarded with pictures of Dean underneath his car, shirtless and covered in dirt, hair sticking up with sweat and grease. It was embarrassingly sexy, and Castiel gulped visibly.
He'd taken off his shirt and his pants, the only thing he was still wearing were his boxers. In his hand, he had a bottle of lube and something else I couldn't quite make out.
By the time he knocked a third time, he started yelling through the door. "Come on, man, I know you're in there!" Benny said loudly and he sounded annoyed, upset by my sudden change in behavior, and I flinched involuntarily. "Open the fucking door!"
"Dean?" he asked in alarm and came closer quickly, thinking that Dean had hurt himself. That was just his luck though, hurting his boyfriend with
," Castiel started, leaning forwards on the counter suggestively. "I guess you'll just have to keep trying."
"Why--" Castiel forced out. Dean's lips on his skin were really fucking distracting. "Why would I use 'massage' as a -- a code word for sex?"
As soon as Dean was gone, he looked down at the small pill in his hand. Beside this one, there had been no other ones in Dean's jacket, meaning he wouldn't be able to spike another drink of his, thankfully.
A bitter laugh escapes my throat. Alastair falls quiet.
"Awesome," Dean said with a bright smile and squeezed Castiel's arm happily. "I should get back to my friends now, but I'll see you later, okay?"
"Really? What is it?" I ask and Cas runs a hand through his already messy hair, thinking.
And with these words, he picked up a piece of pecan pie and pushed it into his mouth, moaning at the taste. He chewed but only swallowed parts of it. All I could do was stare.
"Are you pissed?" I asked hesitantly.
"But... I--" Castiel stuttered. "I'm not lying!"
"Yeah, or maybe she was just cold."
"Out of all your brothers?" Dean laughed. "How many do you have? Twenty?"
"Wow, you must be really desperate to be giving
Conversation returned back to normal and by the time the check came, it was later than Dean had expected it to be. It was good that Jack usually spent the night at Mary's whenever he was on a date (which hadn't happened very often lately), so he didn't have to watch the time.
"Leave, Benny!" I shouted through the door, letting my emotions get the best of me. "Please, just leave..." My voice broke.
"Y-You want to watch?" Castiel repeated, just to be sure, and Dean nodded.
? Trust me, I could've figured that out on my own," he said and pulled himself to his feet, wincing at the stinging in his ass. "Now where's your fucking kitchen? I need a bottle of water and some coffee," he growled.
"You really think so?" Dean asked timidly and Sam rolled his eyes in exasperation.
Cas couldn't suppress the happy laugh that left his mouth.
"Please," I repeat, my hope slowly decreasing. I am not gonna get out of here, am I?
"I'm glad then," Mom said and smiled. "I'm sure some father-son time will be good for you."
Again, Castiel didn't say anything, but I felt him pressing a soft kiss to my hair, stroking my back calmingly. It made me feel better instantly and I closed my eyes.
And this was so not what Sam had expected to hear.
"Dean," I gasped, the sensation too much and not enough at the same time, and I bucked up into his fingers.
for something evil without actually knowing about it. So, if you let us take that thing out, I
"I got lost," Cas replied and he wasn't even lying. "I was wandering the streets."
Suddenly, Jimmy's words from before registered. "Wait, what did you mean,
"Wha-- why did he do that?" Dean stuttered, disbelieving and louder than he'd intended. "You asked him to help you out and he treated you like shit; what the hell?
"Cas," he mutters, dumbfounded. "What-- what are you doing here?"
Dean had gotten up early again, like every day lately, and strolled into the building. His attention was on Meg right away and they talked until the delivery guy came. Once Dean took the flowers, a smirk on his face, he said goodbye to Meg and left towards the elevator.
. He'll be fine. Besides, I could tell you everything that happens the next
He put the cube away. "I apologize," he said, deciding to return to sitting quietly on the couch next to Dean. The man sighed in relief.
"You heard him. Go," Castiel said and I was glad he did. I couldn't force out one more word.
"I really am sorry," he repeated one last time before reluctantly turning away and leaving the room.
Would it?
"Dean," I exclaim, a sudden want tugging at me from the inside.
When Dean showed up at his doorsteps later that day, Castiel did not expect him to be wearing his nicest clothes - or what he assumed to be his nicest clothes anyway. Dean was wearing jeans without holes in it, as opposed to normal, and a light green button-down that matched his eyes perfectly. Castiel loved the way he looked but decided not to comment on it since he himself had not dressed up at all. He did wonder a little though.
"I know," Castiel said matter-of-factly and Dean's drunken brain tried not to feel insulted. He wasn't that obvious, was he? "It's fine. We won't do anything you don't like."
"Are you here alone?" Dean wanted to know, leaning forward to take his glass in hand again, taking a sip of his drink.
He wasn't sure he could do it.
It's hours before I finally hear the sound of footsteps. Unexpectedly though, Dean doesn't enter my room immediately, instead, I hear the door of his torture chamber creak open. He's taking a look at the mess I made, I realize. I instinctively wonder whether he likes it.
. Why would I give that up?
"Cas! You're not even listening," she complained, and Castiel glanced up at her defeatedly. She had a pout on her face and her arms were crossed.
"I-- I--"
I promised myself to prove it to Castiel tonight.
"Tonight was nice," Castiel said, looking into Dean's eyes hopefully. He was beautiful like this, even Dean had to admit that.
Like he'd predicted, the door to the bathroom opened. Cas didn't look up, until Dean called his name.
As easy as it was to send flowers and a note, it was unbelievably hard to talk to or even
"Who are these from?" she asked and reached out a hand to touch the blossoms, not seeming to appreciate their beauty but rather wanting to feel the delicate structure underneath her fingers. The gesture felt violating in a way.
"Now I'm gonna fuck you and make you feel it for days," Castiel announced, not caring that there was no one to listen. Castiel simply loved the sound of his own voice.
The silence is a little awkward.
"What the...?" he started and sat up quickly. "Why's there two of you?" he asked, but the answer was obvious. He was going mad. The teleporter had screwed up his brain.
"Dean, whatever you're about to tell me, it won't change how I look at you," Castiel promised and laid his hands down on Dean's. "I've already made up my mind about you."
"I apologize, but it's not ready for that just yet," he forced out reluctantly, knowing he'd just given Amara more ammunition to shoot him with. He braced himself mentally.
"Doesn't feel all that great, huh? Getting roofied," Castiel asked smugly and Dean glared at him. Before he could answer with something witty though, the feeling of being sick punched him in the gut like a freight train and he groaned again, in pain. "Cas, please, untie me, I think I'm gonna be sick," he warned and Castiel did as he said. Seconds later, Dean was on his feet and sprinting for the bathroom. Luckily for him, the door was literally right next to the bed.
of all people to pull something on them. If he answered with, 'I am human,' and the man checked his back, he'd be in trouble.
hide from me," he warned, staring into my eyes with meaning, and I gulped, nodding.
I nodded stiffly and avoided Dean's eyes. I felt his gaze on me the whole rest of dinner.
"One sister. But no twin, if that's what you're asking," he answered.
These kinds of experiences were part of why he loved doing what he did though. He had variety.
"You were alone?" Sam asked. Dean frowned.
, Castiel realized, that was because he had his eyes closed.
"Um..." he utters and blinks. I wave, smiling.
"Do not complain, Dean," Castiel ordered, voice hard, and I shrank in his lap slightly. My excitement was almost gone again, balls slowly getting blue, and I barely managed to hold back my tears. This was so unfair. "I'm gonna let you come eventually," he said.
"Yes?" Cas asked, aiming for a naive tone.
The cock inside of me increases its pace, hitting this one spot again and again, and if it felt good before, it feels fucking
"Go ahead," he ordered and glared at Meg, who was standing next to the button insecurely.
Castiel began to stutter. "Do you... well... I mean... I could give you a massage?" was what eventually left his mouth.
He may not know what he is, but at least he has a name now. It's a step in the right direction.
The guy only grins and holds up a paper bag. "I'm his drug dealer," he explains and my suspicion fades away slightly. I smile.
"Sit on the bed," Dean orders and I turn towards him in surprise. I just assumed he'd left, but he's still there, closing the door shut, turning a key around in the lock. I am closed in with him.
"Would you like breakfast?" Cas asked politely, but I didn't even have a chance to answer because he was complaining to Dean a second later, still smiling. "Dean, please, it'd be very helpful if you could put me down now, I am trying to have a conversation," he said, as if this was something that had happened before, and I was even more confused.
"Then they'll for sure notice Cas missing, if they haven't already. I'll drive a state over tomorrow and hide it somewhere, so if Cas's absence gains attention, they get the wrong location. It wouldn't do us any good if a potentially dangerous guy came after us," he decided. Dean grumbled but agreed reluctantly. "And we still have to figure out what exactly is going on here..."
Castiel smiled to himself when he entered the building, a feeling of familiarity curling in his gut. He felt home in here, having spent a quarter of his life in clubs like this, willingly or not. He'd had the kind of friends who would drag him along to places like this, and after a while, Castiel really wasn't bothered by it anymore. He rather enjoyed it actually.
Castiel stared at him with a raised eyebrow. "You absolutely can. It's called bisexuality."
, and wraps Cas up in his arms.
The club felt like it was vibrating, that's how loud the music was. Masses of people filled the dance floor, grinding on each other and not caring about who was watching. A few drunk teenagers with fake IDs were moving among them, looking for some fun and an easy lay. Because that's exactly the kind of place this was, a semi-legal club with semi-legal parties and patrons looking for relief -- one way or the other.
," he laughed.
It takes him a while; he doesn't know how long exactly, but he eventually manages to calm down enough to sit back against the wall without the risk of falling down unconscious. Castiel is sitting right next to him, stroking his arm, and it's so much more calming than it should be.
-, but Castiel liked the way it made him feel superior. He wasn't usually the dominant partner in bed, but he'd definitely make an exception for this one.
It was this exact moment when the alarm went off.
"Well, to summarize, your girlfriend
Dean couldn't suppress a smile.
"Alright, but I am," he said and set his jaw. "And I need
"I'm good! Moving sucks though, you wouldn't believe. But it's over now, luckily," Benny said. "I'm glad you could make it tonight, we should definitely drink some shots later. Oh, by the way, there's some pretty hot girls here tonight if you're interested, so take your pick." Benny winked.
When Dean finally lifted his head after what felt like hours, he was feeling somewhat clearer. The room had come to a stop and his eyes could focus again, only his head was still somewhat muddy.
This was big news as far as I was concerned. I'd never seen Cas being interested in anyone -he was always with Dean after all- and I was curious to know who it was. I didn't want to intrude on his privacy though and Dean and him were mid-talk anyway, so I decided to ask Charlie about it later on.
"Dean," Castiel gasped suddenly. "I need you."
The only thing Cas remembered when it came to that last one was that, "Taylor Swift is evil and Zep is heaven," which Cas wasn't sure he could fully support because he'd asked Sam about it later and listened to a Taylor Swift song, finding that he'd quite liked it.
"Man, that was one hell of a drive," he starts, obviously speaking to the other guy, and turns around to him distractedly. "Never seen so many damn car--"
. The robot would know everything the original did and probably wouldn't even be aware of not being human. They'd just go on with their life as they knew it, until their master or whatever sends out a signal and takes over the world," Dean couldn't help but smirk even though it wasn't all that funny. Still, he was pretty damn proud of himself. "And of course -to get back to the hospital being the key to everything-, there is no better place to put a plug in a person than in a hospital. Oh, and before you say, '
"Well... yeah," Dean said, looking up at Castiel in confusion. "And I don't mind, really, it's just, for Prom, I'd really like to have you there."
All my tired numbness is suddenly gone and panic rises in me. Where the hell am I? Who brought me here? And what is that mysterious person gonna do to me?
Every time, I would greet him with a smile and a "Hey," and he'd answer with his intense stare and a "Hello Dean." I didn't know where he knew my name from, but I knew his as well, so I supposed it wasn't all that weird.
The pie was as amazing as the burgers had been, just like expected, and Dean once again praised Castiel for picking the world's best restaurant for their date. He would definitely come here again.
Math actually
Castiel had to suppress a smirk at the question, silently biting his lip and looking down at his coffee. "I could make you a slideshow out of it later," he winked, causing Dean to go a little red in the face, if in anger or embarrassment, Castiel didn't know. "Let me just get my phone, I'll show you," he then added, a little more serious this time.
I shifted slightly, trying to escape his arms without waking him up, but he just pulled me closer, possessive even during sleep. I turned my head towards him.
"Friend of yours?" Castiel asked when Benny had left. I hadn't noticed that he was waiting for me in his doorway.
Dean was hers; it was the fact that Castiel had the audacity to even
I'm happy.
"Perfect copies of real-life people, complete with memories and everything. Nobody will notice the difference! Not even themselves," Metatron bragged, still wearing that insufferable smirk. Inias somehow felt the need to rain on his parade.
"Done," Dean said and Castiel turned back to look at him. His heart skipped a beat when his eyes involuntarily wandered over Dean's biceps and chest, down his abs and strong legs, and he had to rip his eyes away from him forcefully. Dean truly was breath-taking (meaning 'flaming hot' in Gabe's vocabulary), but Castiel quickly shook off the thought. Now was certainly not the time to check Dean out.
"I didn't see."
"L-Let's watch a movie," Cas then says and presses a button on the remote.
"Here," Dean said, handing him the glass as he sat back down.
Castiel smiled.
"Yes, that's alright," Castiel agreed, ever the gentleman, and sat down on the couch hesitantly. Jack was watching him from the corner of his eye but didn't say anything.
For all of three seconds Dean couldn't do anything but look at them, dumbfounded. Nobody had ever gotten him
Deciding he'd better get somewhere dry, Cas started looking around for a shelter and saw a café at the corner. But since Cas didn't require nutrition or anything, he decided on the building next to it. A library.
He pressed the button for sixth floor -the management section of the building- and leaned back against the wall. The good thing about having an office that high up was that the view from the windows was awesome, the bad thing was that it was exhausting to climb all the stairs if the elevator was stuck again. Which happened quite a lot, actually. Wasn't it weird that with a whole floor full of dedicated mechanics, nobody bothered to repair the thing? A little maybe. Then again, the research and invention sector was only on second floor, so they didn't have to climb a lot of stairs and therefore didn't need it fixed.
I didn't ask how he knew about Bobby. I didn't ask why he knew when I usually got up in the morning either.
, Dean," Castiel snapped, finally pulling his hand away. "But that doesn't change our situation. You still did what you did!"
Without glancing away from Dean, the boy said a few words to his friends, a goodbye of some sort maybe, and then walked right in Dean's direction. Dean didn't even get the time to panic because the guy was already sitting down next to him on the couch.
"That's... that's great," Castiel replied half-heartedly. Before he could add any more, Mister Singer had entered the room, catching everyone's attention.
"Bobby made me work on four separate cars today, but like, really big stuff, no easy fixes. And as soon as I was finished with one of them, he'd shoe me to the next one. I was
"Well. Are you ready now?" he asks quietly. He keeps Dean's gaze somewhat confidently, but Dean notices the slight blush tainting his cheeks. It's the most wonderful sight Dean's ever seen, and it makes his chest throb with hope.
"Um..." I start, having lost the ability to speak. "B-both?" I stutter and hurry to explain myself. "I -- I mean... If only one of us has hickeys, Sam might think they're from someone else, you know? But if we both have some... Just being thorough," I add quickly.
When Castiel was finished setting up the movie, he sat down on the couch and waited for Dean to come back, which he did only a few moments later with a bowl of popcorn. He sat down right beside Castiel even though the couch was big enough for three, which made Castiel huff in amusement.
"....Alright," Sam said slowly and walked past them warily. "I think I'm still gonna get that motel room."
"It doesn't hurt, it doesn't harm and it brings you from one place to another in a second, which is exactly what our modern society needs and wants."
"I don't know," Dean admitted, smiling. "But you seemed like the type."
, his victim, the guy he's despised from the beginning, to
him for it!
"Where'd you leave your trench coat?" Dean asked Castiel later when they'd sat down and ordered already.
Then, all of a sudden, he turned back to me determinedly and said, "Stay away from him, okay? He'll be the death of you."
It didn't take him long. Not even five minutes later, Cas was done, every side of the cube one color only. He looked up at Dean, holding the cube out to him, and smiled proudly.
. She'd
"Dean," I panted when his tongue left my mouth for a second, and he immediately knew what I wanted. He opened my pants quickly, took out my dick and started stroking it. It was dry and hurt a little, but I was dying to get off and didn't really care anymore. I bucked up into his hand, making Dean chuckle at my enthusiasm.
(I forgot.)
Inias didn't elaborate.
"I would've chained both your hands but I only had one pair of handcuffs," he tells me conversationally and I feel tears prickle at the back of my head. I close my eyes in anticipation. I know he's gonna kill me now. Snap my neck. Choke me. Anything.
cock and stroking it lazily. He was rock hard, I noticed, apparently getting off on me watching him, and I couldn't suppress the small whimper that escaped my mouth. Castiel smirked at that, not that I had enough brain capacity to notice right now.
I ate breakfast slowly, deep in thought and confused beyond believe.
I raise the knife to his stomach.
in the other world. Well, that certainly explained the creepy similarity.
"Hey," she replied quietly and for some reason, it didn't sound as perky as he was used to. A little alarmed, Dean turned his attention to her and looked her up and down. She seemed tired, like she hadn't slept at all that night, and her shoulders were tense. She was awfully quiet.
But that was when Dean pulled a small box out of his pocket, revealing a ring, and smirked at him.
, he couldn't help but buck into it, burying his whole length in Dean's throat. Dean didn't visibly react and fuck if that didn't turn Castiel on. He pulled back after a few moments, not wanting to accidentally choke Dean while unconscious and instead set a hard rhythm, using Dean's throat for all it was worth.
I swallowed it down eagerly and let him take full control of the kiss. I still tasted the pie on his tongue and it made me happy and dizzy at the same time.
And with that, he was gone, leaving me behind with trembling hands and an uncomfortable hardness in my pants.
On the fifth day, everything was finished. Castiel sent Jimmy to get a few test objects, just to see if it was working the way it should, and Jimmy didn't hesitate to do so.
Castiel hated parties.
"You know that Novak guy? The one with the teleporter?" she asked. "That's the one."
Neither Dean nor Castiel really noticed.
, by the way. Dean Winchester," he says and smiles, sickeningly sweet. "And now that you know, there's really no reason at all for me to let you go."
Standing as still as possible, Cas waited patiently for the van to reach its destination. He was aware that it might take a while, but when they still hadn't stopped moving after what felt like hours, Cas started wondering where exactly the factory hall even was. He hoped it was still inside the country and not in, like, Mexico or Canada.
"You just wanna make Mommy happy, huh, Cas?" Dean asked and innocent as it sounded, I wasn't sure how to interpret his words. "You're such an amazing boy, Castiel," he added. The way he said my name sent another shiver down my spine and unexpectedly, I felt my dick twitch in my pants. What the fuck? This was wrong.
"Looking way too tempting there, Cas," he growled amusedly and I let out an embarrassing sound that was half-moan, half-squeak. Blood was rushing to my dick so fast I got dizzy. "Ever taken a dick up your ass?" Dean whispered into my ear when he leaned forward.
Dean didn't seem to notice.
Before his eyes, Castiel's face shattered. "Oh no. I knew it. You didn't really want to go on a date with me, but you felt sorry for me, didn't you?"
"But, Sammy..." Dean started quietly, voice unsure and hesitant. "What if-- what if he says no?"
. Dean had always put me first, how had I not expected him to do something like this? Besides, sleeping next to your best friend wasn't too big a deal. I guess I was just a little confused because he had said, "
Seeming a little confused by his unspectacular reply, Dean left him alone after that, walking back to where he'd been standing before and leaned against the wall. His arms were still crossed over his chest skeptically.
I give up resignedly and try to remember what happened again. My head still hurts but slightly less so and concentrating seems to be easier. It's still hard to recollect the recent happenings though...
He looked at me in sympathy.
I blushed again, but Dean knew just how to make me forget about my embarrassment. He settled between my legs, holding himself up on his muscled arms, and leaned down to kiss me deeply. He sucked on my tongue eagerly, distracting me from his hand, which was travelling over my naked body in the meantime, taking it all in.
Suddenly, Dean is back on me, lips mouthing at my neck, leaving wet kisses down the side of it. I'm too overwhelmed to react in any way.
He was interrupted by the sound of the front door opening. Dean was home from work.
"Why-- Why'd you stop?" he mumbled disappointedly and Castiel couldn't help but giggle at how cute Dean was acting. Their gazes were locked again, Castiel smiling up at Dean, Dean staring back at him in awe. Castiel couldn't believe he'd ever deserve the way Dean was looking at him right now.
This was it, he realized. This might be the beginning or the end of him. Neither Sam nor Dean were a hundred percent sure if turning off the computer would turn off
"Well, it's a... It's a teleporter," Castiel said bashfully, knowing how ridiculous he had to sound. Nobody really believed in teleportation yet, knowing how much energy it would take and how much damage it could do to a person if it was done wrong. People were scared of the risks and skeptical, and Dean probably didn't think any differently... Nevertheless, Castiel wouldn't give up. He was determined to be the first person to ever build a functioning teleporter and he would freaking deliver!
He decided on the same objects as last time, since he wanted to see the direct difference between his current and his previous attempt. Setting the stuff down at his desk, Castiel turned on the camera.
"Shh," Dean made, calming me down only slightly, and his hand reached out to the bottle of lube lying next to him. My heartbeat sped up. "It's gonna be okay. Just wanna make you feel good," he promised.
"Does he have any siblings?" Sam asked and Dean nodded.
"Hello Jack," Castiel smiled nervously. "It's nice to meet you."
"Nothing happened," Dean replied, huffing an uncomfortable laugh and it was a sound Sam had never heard leaving his brother's mouth before. "Not yet, at least," he added cryptically.
in his direction when he saw her in the hallway. Apparently, he'd driven away
, actually, but he doesn't like that name," Dean explained and I could tell he was excited. Ever since he got accepted at college, he'd been impatient to finally get there. He'd moved in a week ago. And even though he'd never admit it, I could tell he'd been somewhat anxious about making friends.
together. We sleep in
Jimmy turned around slowly, a fiery scowl on his face and his voice was dangerously low when he spoke, a warning hidden underneath. "Listen, Castiel. I really am sorry that you're stuck in this world or whatever, and you're more than welcome to stay here and try to fix it, but do
Cas smiles gently when he sees them and looks back up into my eyes.
"Stop, Dean, I--" he stuttered, struggling to get out from underneath him, and Dean quickly pulled away, throwing his hands up in the air in a soothing gesture. Cas sat up and scrambled away a few feet, not meeting his eyes, seeming extremely uncomfortable.
But now the man -Castiel- started fidgeting even more than before and averted his eyes for the first time during their conversation. He blushed a little and wiped his hands on his suit pants, as if he was nervous about something. Dean frowned skeptically. Finally, Castiel's mouth opened, then closed again, then opened up a second time, and eventually, he spoke.
So instead of taking my time, I simply step around Alastair so I'm standing right behind him, his body desperately trying to wiggle away from me and mumbling a mantra of 'No, please, don't', but I'm not paying any mind to it. I am furious, possessed by revenge and not giving in to my conscience. This is what this monster deserves.
"But... But... You... I thought you were just friends," I told them, thoughts still racing through my mind, not quite grasping what was happening.
"More than anything," he'd reply.
Maybe they'd just used it as an excuse to get away from him though, Cas wasn't sure. Fact was, the second Dean was inside his room, Cas had heard a key turn in Dean's lock.
. He was gonna get neck pains at this rate...
"I mean, I know you're not really into PDA, but it'd mean a lot to me to have you there, and we wouldn't have to, like, kiss or anything, I just--" Dean continued when he didn't get an answer immediately.
Something in Dean's words made Cas's eyes narrow and then look away, a little embarrassed maybe. Was it because their conversation had gotten so intimate? Was it because it had sounded weird coming out of Dean's mouth? Or was it because...?
He knew he only had a couple of minutes, maybe half an hour if he was lucky. Depending on what the two men were discussing with Metatron... But seeing as they seemed to be rather talkative fellows, Cas guessed he had ten minutes at least.
"Why? What've you heard?" I asked, trying to seem casual.
"They shouldn't do stuff like that though," Dean grumbles. He looks thoughtful.
Wow, okay.
I shouldn't watch this, I realized. I should leave right this second and never turn around, move to another country even. But my limbs were frozen and unmoving, the only part of my body reacting in any way being my dick that was perking up in interest.
Cas followed my gaze and his eyes softened when he looked down at it, a warm smile spreading on his face. "Oh, that," he started, spreading his fingers to have a better look at it. "That's--"
"I'm not ready," Castiel said anxiously and gripped Dean's arm tightly. "I can't do this, Dean, drive me home, please," he begged but Dean only laughed in response.
And still the obvious was ignored. 'Dean Winchester isn't gay, he's straight enough to let a guy blow him and not be a fag.' 'Dean Winchester is just done fucking all the girls at this school, so he's doing it with guys now. A hole is a hole, nothing gay about it.' And the most surprising statement, 'Dean Winchester is simply lying,' which wasn't something anyone had ever dared to even
The night passed in a blur for Castiel. He didn't sleep, not that he would have been able to even if he wanted to. To be completely honest, Castiel was scared shitless. Trapped in a world where everything appeared to be the same but nothing was as it seemed, Castiel was left alone with his thoughts and it was driving him mad.
Dean huffed a laugh. "What lesson?
"Just admit it," he teases. "You
"Shit, I gotta take a photo of this," he mumbled, scrambling off Dean to get his cell phone out of his pocket. When he finally found it, he took a picture of Dean and him kissing with come all over their faces.
Sometime during their conversation, their food arrived and they stopped talking in favor of devouring their truly
"You have a spare key under the mat," he explained. "Everybody keeps it under the mat."
Maybe there was time for that later.
"You," I panted, feeling like I'd been away from him for years, even though it'd only been one day. I was eager to finally have him back inside of me.
"Another 10,000 were just replaced," he told his boss. "So, adding the ones we've already replaced over the last few weeks, we have a total of 250,000."
"It's, uh... It's really no problem," I choked out and excused myself quickly before hurrying out of the kitchen. I didn't know what to expect from Dean, so I thought running away would be the safest option. Also, I had to hide my half-hardness somehow. I just hoped I didn't seem too keen on leaving...
I stopped going to school as well, the risk of seeing my friend and being confronted was too much for me. Castiel said it was fine, school wasn't important for me anyway since I had him to care for me. And if Mom found out about my skipping, I'd deal with it later.
I pressed my eyes closed.
I couldn't listen to it anymore.
Dean now reaches for the knife he put down on the bed before and weighs it in his hands. "You know what's fuckin' amazing about those pills?" he asks and I nod enthusiastically.
"Um, as you probably know, uh, I'm Castiel Novak. I'm here to -- to present to you my newest invention. You've probably already heard what I was working on, but it's, uh, it's a teleporter and it works, so... Yeah," he stuttered and turned around to pull on the cloth that was covering the first part of the machine. The other half was standing across the room, for the demonstration later on.
. Dean wanted to keep on experimenting!
It doesn't happen all that often to be honest but the times it does happen are always amazing. I know it's not right, I know that drugs are bad, but God, I've never felt anything like it. They're the only distraction I have in the dull room I'm locked in and it's a huge relief every time I take one.
Castiel didn't look convinced. "And when will that be, Dean? Since when has he been promising you more money? Must've been a while ago."
"You're-- Wait, you're finally gonna ask him? That's amazing, Dean!" Sam exclaimed, worry quickly turning into happy surprise. Dean had been crushing on his roommate Castiel since the day they'd met, and it'd been obvious to everyone except them that the feelings were returned. Still, neither of those idiots ever seemed to be able to make a move. Hell, Dean wasn't even officially out of the closet yet -- even though everybody knew, obviously. And all of a sudden, seemingly out of
"Until then..." he continued, turning to walk towards the bedroom while inconspicuously presenting his ass to Dean. "Why don't you get rid of your boner the traditional way?"
He doesn't notice the confused glance that follows him.
Forcing them open, the action taking more energy than anticipated, he groaned at the brightness of his surroundings. Why did everything have to hurt so much?
, Castiel thought.
She pressed the button.
"How's your day been?" Dean asked conversationally and Castiel replied, "Same as always," while glancing around to check for Dean's friends. He couldn't see any of them but that didn't have to mean they weren't there. And if they saw Dean talking to the only openly gay guy at school, they'd surely be wondering what Dean's business was with him. Not that it was any of Castiel's business, but he didn't want Dean to get hurt because of him.
I had nowhere else to go though, so naturally, I stayed at Castiel's. Mom never knew I was just next door.
I guess I was right. Dean has had more than one hostage. I shudder.
far already! Why was she complaining?
"Let's get us cleaned up," was the last thing he heard Castiel say and then he was fast asleep.
"Dean," the other man said. His skin was rough and calloused, his handshake strong. Oh yes, Castiel could appreciate a firm grip. Very much so...
Sure, it was wrong and dangerous, and I could theoretically get Castiel arrested for taking advantage of a seventeen-year-old, but
?" Castiel asked and shot a quick look at the awkward man standing next to Amara. He guiltily averted his eyes when he caught Castiel looking and fixed his gaze on Amara instead.
that.
"Yeah, well, I believe you now..." he grumbled, poking a piece of lettuce with his fork but not eating it. "Mind readers suck."
I didn't go downstairs for breakfast the next day, feeling too humiliated to even face Dean. I wasn't gonna leave my room ever again, or at least until Mom came back. I could survive four days without food, right?
boyfriend," was all Castiel said, laughing heartily. Every word he said shot Dean right into his heart.
Castiel turned away instead, staring ahead with his ears on fire, and Dean suddenly realized that Castiel was
"He seems nice," Castiel deadpanned and I almost laughed at the absurdity. It was obvious that they despised each other.
Dean awoke the next morning to a dick coming in his ass and the feeling of his arms having been tied to the headboard. "Shit, Dean," a hoarse voice ground out into his ear. "Looking so good on my cock, babe, fuck," the voice groaned loudly.
to come, okay, please," I reasoned, but Castiel didn't react in any other way than in starting to jerk me off again, so I stopped arguing. There was no use, Castiel did what he wanted anyway.
That evening, Castiel asked him to stay the night and have breakfast together with Castiel's parents. He agreed and, to no one's surprise except maybe Dean's, Mr. and Mrs. Novak loved him from the very first second on and promptly made Dean promise to join them for meals more often. Dean agreed that he would, blushing happily, and got pulled upstairs by Castiel for an appreciative blowjob afterwards.
"I expanded my search to hospitals in a 30 mile radius. I doubt you've really gotten that far but it's better to check every possibility. I'm pretty sure the hospital in question will be among them," he said. "Wait a sec, I'll get them."
"Good," Dean says and pulls me with him.
"I'm making pancakes, no matter what you two would prefer," Dean shouted over to us and Cas smirked at that, saying, "You know I love pancakes."
Castiel's eyebrows shot upwards. Amara couldn't be serious. Was she really suggesting what he thought she was?
Castiel leaned in a little more, carefully coaxing Dean's mouth open with his tongue, making Dean moan in surprise. And suddenly, the heat from the party was there all over again, burning low in Castiel's stomach, making him impatient, and so he pushed Dean down on the sofa and crawled over him without hesitation. Dean groaned once more when Castiel rubbed their groins together, and Castiel couldn't help but join him.
"You'll do fine," Dean assured him, smiling, and reached out a hand to touch his.
The boy was standing around with some of his friends, it seemed, but Dean had never seen them before in his life. It was two girls and a guy, all looking a little older and neither of them familiar. Maybe they were already out of school or didn't go to his one. Dean didn't know or care.
So... what exactly did it mean if he was serious?
"Gosh, just how big is this thing?" Sam asked, slowly starting to believe Dean's theories and feeling more than a little uncomfortable at the thought. "World domination sounds a lot more realistic now," he admitted reluctantly. "Early stages, but still."
"So..." Castiel started and smirked at him in amusement. "You come here often?"
"So, um... You mentioned you had a wife? And kids?" Castiel asked and looked up at Jimmy insecurely. It was so weird looking into your own face and imagining them living a completely different life than yourself.
The next time he comes downstairs he's on edge, his gaze wild and crazed, and I immediately know that it's gonna happen today. My heart sinks.
"I did not!" I exclaimed. "How should I have known about this?"
"What brought this on though?" Sam added, curious about Dean's change of heart. Not that he hadn't known it was gonna happen eventually.
small possibility, I might add- that he's not dead," Meg started slowly. Dean perked up. "There was no residue in the teleporter, ashes or whatever, so he
And then Dean kisses me again, and again, desperation showing in the way his hand grips my shirt. He has me, he understands now, he's had me for a while already. He doesn't need to keep worrying because I am not going anywhere.
bad of a kisser... "Seriously, Castiel, you could've warned me at least."
"You okay?" Dean asked, one last time, and I nodded, cracking a small smile at him. He smiled back softly. "Come on then," he said, and I followed him downstairs.
"I'm widowed," it burst out of Dean all of a sudden. Castiel blinked at him. "I'm widowed and I have an eight-year-old son that I'm raising on my own."
He winked, hoping Dean would take it as the invitation it was.
But still, Castiel couldn't deny his jealousy.
I shook my head quickly. Was he gonna do that? Fuck me?
Weirdly enough, I actually liked Dean. He was handsome, funny and didn't make me feel like the annoying 15-year-old that I apparently was, according to Mom's previous boyfriends. Yeah, Dean seemed great -if not flawless- and I enjoyed dinner with him greatly. But it was the thing after dinner that had me feeling a little unsure about his motives...
Then he pulled back and dragged Castiel into a passionate kiss.
"I got stuck in here yesterday," he ended up saying and silently hated himself for it. What the hell? Castiel flinched in surprise, risking a glance in his direction, and stared at Dean with wide eyes.
How was I gonna survive living with Dean as my new step-father if he was sending me looks like these?
"Who are you never going to leave, Dean? Who are you gonna be with forever?" Castiel asked, louder now, and I screamed the answer into the room.
"You can't do this, Cas, please, don't be cruel, I
Well, everyone's except Castiel's, of course. He was still busy admiring Dean from behind, watching his every move as always. It was just that he was such a genuinely nice person; he was funny and good-hearted, helpful and hot as fuck. Not that Castiel would ever tell him that.
"Morning to you, too, doll face," she joked, not even bothering to look up at him. Dean chuckled. Meg was a good worker, a little sarcastic at times but a great person deep inside her heart. He'd grown quite fond of her over time.
"You may be right," Cas said, lost in thought. "Did you find any more pictures of hospitals?" Cas then asked and Sam nodded.
He deflated quietly, not knowing why he felt like he did, and turned his head, not wanting to continue listening. Instead, he forced himself to take another look around. Hanging on the wall were a few family pictures of Sam and Dean as kids with their parents. Also, a photo of a grumpy looking older guy in a suit and a tough-looking woman in a wedding dress, a girl of about 16 years standing next to them proudly. Maybe their daughter? Cas didn't know. He should ask Sam about it later...
Is he gonna kill me, too? I have to get out of here.
"I didn't know what we were," Castiel quickly assured him. "All this time I thought you didn't want people to know, so it didn't even occur to me that you might want more with me," he explained.
"What about this?" Dean asked and held up his clipboard.
"A-Alright." Castiel blinked. He didn't expect that turn of events but oh well. "Choose an object then," he said, calmed down by the fact that their conversation was work-related now.
More blood is spilling, red color against white skin and I have the weird urge kiss it. I don't though. Instead, I add another cut on Dean's shoulder and hear him humming contently. He pulls me closer eagerly and bares his throat, pointing a finger to it, offering.
"D-Dean?" Castiel asked, feeling somewhat crushed by that new knowledge. Knowing that Jimmy'd had the chance to be with Dean while Castiel himself was desperately trying to win his own Dean's heart and failing, was almost worse than Dean's rejection had felt like.
, so more often than not, Cas would get an earful or no reaction at all. Cas never took it personally.
"That's right, sweetheart, swallow. Swallow it all down," Dean encourages and the look in his eyes is hooded; satisfied and hungry at the same time. Then, Dean pulls his cock out of my mouth and packs it away, closing his jeans happily.
"There's this empty rental space downtown that Dean and I have been looking at. We'd like to open up a small restaurant there," Cas told me and smiled at the thought. I wasn't surprised that Cas wanted to do that, open up his own restaurant. He loved cooking and he was exceptionally good at it. Doing anything else would have been a waste of talent. That Dean wanted to join was a little unexpected but also not
My little brother eyes us up skeptically, aware of today's date and very much expecting a trick. "What is it?" he asks.
"Do you know what I do not understand though?" Cas then asked, successfully pulling Dean out of his thoughts, and locked his gaze with Dean's.
"Fuck," he cried out when he got closer to the edge, licking up Dean's chest in a frenzy. "So fucking sexy, Dean, so
"Hello?" a voice suddenly shouts, sounding panicky, and I look up surprisedly. This is not Dean's voice. "Is anybody here? I need help,
When he was finished, he turned back towards Dean, who'd been standing around, watching him attentively the whole time.
"Come back here," he said as a goodbye and hung up.
"I left her a note in the kitchen, saying you slept over at Benny's. I signed for you," he yawned and I frowned slightly. Did Castiel even realize what he'd just said?
For some reason though, the days he doesn't visit are the worst. Yeah, he kidnapped me and rapes me on a regular basis and I know that he killed enough persons that he doesn't remember how many; but if he's here, at least I'm not alone. Being alone is what's hard; being alone is what drives me insane. There's too much time to think, too little space to move and nothing to relieve my mind.
"Listen, man, I really don't have time for this. You'd do me a huge favor if you explained to me why you came out of my fucking teleporter and why the hell I feel like I'm looking into a mirror," the voice said, a little impatient, and Castiel forced his eyes open again slowly. This time the pain was bearable.
"You have two options," he began defeatedly, successfully gaining Dean's attention, who looked up at him with puffy red eyes. "Either you stop lending me stuff, making me compliments and being sweet to me in general, so I can get over your stupid face..." Castiel's heart tightened even at the possibility of not having Dean near him anymore, but he knew it was probably for the best. Dean's lower lip started quivering. Castiel averted his gaze. "Or..." he continued with option two. "You get your shit together and ask me out like a real man before I change my mind, to at least
, he'd screwed up yet again.
"Tired?" Castiel asked and smirked at me, eyebrow cocked.
"What do you mean? Who've you been thinking about?" Benny insisted and I squirmed slightly. I decided I'd tell him the truth, or parts of it.
"Perfect choice my ass! Everybody would be better than him," Dean said, fighting hard to keep his voice level. "I'm sure you have enough other friends who'd be more than willing to help you out!"
"Mm-hm," Castiel made non-committedly.
to watch.
He's surprisingly gentle, exploring my abdomen and chest, and I melt under his touch.
Collapsing to his knees in front of the toilet bowl, he threw up the second he reached it, emptying his stomach immediately -- or what little was left in it. He hadn't eaten a lot the night before, so basically all that came out was liquid mixed with bile. Puking that up was an excruciating feeling and it smelled like shit, but at least now there was nothing left to vomit afterwards.
His eyes met mine unexpectedly and I startled, the look in Castiel's gaze dark and hungry. My mouth fell open for a second, before I forced it close again and gulped hard. There was tension between the two of us, so much, and I didn't know what to do. I'd never been in a situation quite like this.
I don't have to think twice before saying yes.
"You're gonna wear this plug for the rest of the day," Dean said, searching my eyes for some sort of protest. There wasn't any. "And then tonight, I'm gonna fuck you again," Dean added, pushed the plug inside of me and pulled me into another kiss. I hummed quietly.
And fuck, Dean felt raw. Nobody had ever reacted like this when he broke the news, and it just felt so nice to be accepted this easily. He didn't know what to do or say to that, so he simply nodded and squeezed Castiel's hands back.
, that's what he is. He's manipulating you."
But that was when another thought crawled into his brain, a small possibility, the faintest chance, a
Four days passed vigorously, only interrupted by a few hours of sleep every night. It wasn't exactly comfortable to sleep on the cold tile floor but Jimmy had at least brought Dean and him a blanket, which Castiel was thankful for. And no matter how hard the floor was, being able to sleep curled up in Dean's arms was worth it all.
So far, it had worked after all, with small things like toy cars. It wasn't much, but it was better than nothing.
Fifteen minutes passed without a word spoken, hands buried deep in the waste of others, and the only thing they found was that students were fucking
Dean hesitated before answering, not wanting her to know but seeing no point in lying either. And maybe she'd leave him alone if she believed Dean was gay -which he wasn't-, as flowers sent from a man might suggest. "They're from Castiel Novak," he therefore said and the second the words left his mouth he knew it had been a mistake.
Sam and Cas arrived soon enough and Sam parked the car in a spacious garage next to a small but pretty looking house. Leaving the car when Sam did, Cas followed Sam around to the front door.
By the time Friday came around, Dean was basically a mess, his head filled with a confusing mix of anticipation, anxiousness, and guilt, while he desperately tried to decide on what to wear. All Jack had to contribute to the topic was a shrug and a sweet, but totally unhelpful, "You look good in everything, Dad." God, Dean loved his son.
"Hey, Cas, looking good," he greeted the other man.
Well, at least in theory. Because for some reason, his body didn't get the fucking notion. He continued dry-heaving for what felt like half an hour -but was actually more like two minutes- and when he finally stopped, he was watery eyed and exhausted, holding on to the toilet seat for dear life.
"What about my--"
"You're such an angel, baby, such a sweet, innocent angel," he mutters and hits the back of my throat when his speed increases again. Tears well up in my eyes again and I fight the urge to throw up. I know Dean is close, I only have to hold on for a
Unexpectedly, he brushed my prostate and I cried out, one of my hands finding my dick involuntarily and squeezing it, but Castiel slapped it away quickly. I suppressed a sob like so often and simply hoped for Castiel to touch me soon. He kept pushing in and out, brushing my prostate on purpose every time.
"You will," Dean assured him. And then he leaned in for a sweet, lingering kiss that had Dean smiling into Cas's lips. When they parted, Dean smirked at him, saying, "See you later, babe." All the reaction their kiss got from Sam was raised eyebrows and frustrated silence.
Leaving the woman shouting at Raphael, knowing she'd shut up the minute he opened his mouth, Castiel stepped a safe distance away. He didn't want to deal with all this anymore and even though he knew the next customer complaint would find him soon enough, he wanted to indulge in those short, sweet minutes of silence.
Castiel gulped down what was still in his mouth. "I-- I missed lunch," he then stuttered, a pathetic attempt to justify himself, but all Dean did was laugh.
"It's..." Castiel started reluctantly. Did it really matter anymore? His day had been horrible and he'd already embarrassed himself in front of his crush. He could just as well let Dean help him... "It's a book. My book. Michael threw it into one of the dumpsters and I can't find it. I need to find it, Dean..." he said and held back tears again, still refusing to look at Dean, when a gentle hand touched his shoulder. He glanced up involuntarily.
When nothing more happens, I open my eyes carefully. The man is staring at me quietly.
"Yes, Dean?" Cas asked, ready to wish him a good night's sleep, but was surprised by Dean's next words.
"You didn't," Dean assured him. He watched Castiel put away his overnight bag in silence and fought the urge to ask what was going on. Dean didn't know if he was allowed to do that though, so he stayed quiet instead.
Castiel couldn't help but stare.
I came to visit them sometimes. I still saw them at school a lot, but some days I just didn't feel like staying in my dorm all day and followed them home instead. They didn't mind and were rather glad to have me over. They were proud of their new home and liked showing it off.
One of the bedroom doors opened then and Cas looked up. It was Sam, already dressed up in a loose shirt and shorts, apparently about to go for a run. He greeted Cas and asked him how he felt, which Cas thought was nice, replying with a heartfelt, "Very well." Then Sam said goodbye and went for his jog while Cas continued sitting on the couch.
people! Improved versions. And of course, they're all completely under my control!" Metatron exclaimed and laughed exhilaratedly. The happiness didn't suit him. But then again nothing really
Sam and Dean let out a relieved sigh they tried not to let Cas hear but he did so nevertheless. He didn't comment on it and instead waited patiently for Sam to open him up once more.
I was useless.
This was more important though. "Cas, my mom..." was all I had to say. Castiel shook his head quietly.
Still, the days passed and without really noticing, Dean kept an eye out for Castiel -- but for nothing. He didn't see him during lunch, he didn't meet him in the elevator, he didn't see him in the hallways. Nothing. Nada.
"No, it's really not. I was selfish. I climaxed in front of you and neglected to take care of you afterwards, even though you were so obviously aroused. It wasn't fair. In my defense, you didn't give me a lot of time to help before you left," Castiel said, voice plain but regretful. I flinched at his words. How could he say stuff like that without feeling ashamed?
"In a second, Dean," Castiel says, gesturing towards Alfie in explanation.
"It's... I don't know," Dean started, staring at the thing hidden on Cas's scalp. It was metallic and it looked like... a plug or something?
"What's it to you?" Benny asked, ignoring Castiel's attempt to get rid of him.
"Hey guys," I said, sitting down next to Charlie and she promptly laid her head down on my shoulder. We'd grown to be really good friends as well.
So why the hell hadn't Dean thought of an answer just yet? How did he not know what to say?
"Castiel, buddy, it's
"Yeah. Sure," was Sam's answer. And that was all that was said on the matter.
gay, he'd totally have fallen for the guy by now. It really was a shame he wasn't.
"A little frustrated, I take it," Dean joked, a smile on his lips, and Castiel's heart fluttered like so many times lately. He'd fallen so hard... "Don't worry, you'll figure it out eventually."
While he apologized
) crush on Cas, so what? How could I not.
and Castiel was proud of it.
The worry in Castiel's voice made Dean inexplicably angry.
"Open your eyes, honey, I wanna see those baby blues looking up at me," he says and I open my teary eyes reluctantly, innocent gaze searching his as I look up at him pleadingly. His eyes get even hungrier when his gaze meets mine and he thrusts inside my mouth even deeper than before. I try to loosen my throat as best as I can.
He took a small bite. And his eyes widened in revelation.
All of a sudden, Castiel was furious.
idea, to be honest, and I hadn't planned to run back to Castiel that quickly. We'd basically fucked the night before, and we didn't even know each other all that well. Not to mention the unusually big age gap between us.
Not wanting to move, his limbs feeling heavy and wobbly, he was painfully aware of every part of his body and closed his eyes again with a whimper.
Even though Castiel's thoughts were on Dean the whole time, he didn't see him once until his lunch period, which wasn't weird in and of itself, but he kinda would've liked the reminder.
"Sorry, man, but you must've mixed up the numbers. If you're the new guy, your room is the one next door. I forgot which was mine, too, when I first moved in," I said and I didn't know how I managed to talk as casually as I did. Castiel's gaze was scrutinizing and
Maybe he'd let me come this time though, I thought hopefully.
"I wanted to apologize for the other day. That was inappropriate," he said and my eyes went wide. I'd been completely content with never thinking about the laundry room incident again, let alone talk about it. And now Castiel had just casually mentioned it?
What would Castiel do then?
And he does, later that day, when he sees Alfie walking over to Castiel's table during lunch. Without thinking about the consequences, he hurries over to Castiel's table himself, rudely cutting in front of Alfie, and invents some bullshit about forgetting to take notes in class and whether he could copy Castiel's. Castiel looks at him strangely but gives him his notes anyway, and when Dean sits down next to him to copy them and checks his surroundings, he finds that Alfie is already gone. He smiles triumphantly into his notebook and pointedly ignores the worried looks Charlie, Meg, and Castiel are exchanging. Keeping Alfie away from Castiel turned out to be easier than expected.
Pushing in, he entered the room and stopped in its middle, staring.
Benny
uncomfortable in my skin.
Benny looked up at me in surprise. "You alright, man? You were winning," he said.
"Anything, Cas," Sam answered genuinely and Cas couldn't help but smile. Sam was so very different from Dean; he was nice in an honest, easy way. Dean on the other hand was rude sometimes but enthusiastic enough to make up for it and of course, no less nice on the inside.
Dean nodded absent-mindedly. "We'll have to check that out," he commented, speaking up for the first time during the intervention.
Dean's smile dropped. "What do you mean, 'robot'?" he asked tensely and alternated between staring at Cas and glaring at Sam. "You're fucking with me, right?"
After a while of living together, I came to realize that Castiel was just as alone as I was. It took me longer than it probably should have to figure it out, but it turned out Castiel felt just as lonely as I did, secretly isolating himself from the rest of the world and hurting on the inside. He'd cut me off from my family and friends on purpose I realized soon, but weirdly enough I couldn't get up the energy to be mad at him. He hadn't really had a choice now, had he? He was lonely and simply wanted somebody to be there for him. Somebody who was ready to give up everything. And Castiel had found that in me.
. "Been waiting to do this since I first saw you," Dean admitted and finally, his hand found my crotch. I bucked up into his hand, longing for friction, and Dean pressed down on my hardness willingly.
Without acknowledging Castiel's response, Michael kicked the backpack away and reached down to grab the small book before Castiel even had time to react, leaving the latter scrambling to get up from the ground.
He didn't look in the men's direction when they eventually noticed him, but rather opted to stare at the apple tree in front of him in interest. It was a beautiful tree.
"Cut it out, Dean. Cas is a robot or something, I doubt he's even
When they got to the store, Cas was a little surprised by how big it was and by just how many people managed to fill the space. It was noisy, chaotic and a little chilly -- not that Cas really felt that last one.
"Mornin', Meg," he grumbled absentmindedly, not really paying attention to anything when he walked up to the counter.
So, armed with a chair leg and determination, Cas turned back towards the computer.
Until now, I'd managed to stay over at a Charlie's whenever Mom wasn't home for a night, fleeing Dean's scary gazes and the danger of something happening, but this time, Charlie wasn't home. She was on vacation with her parents -- Spain, to be exact.
Castiel to stop and he should be glad the guy had listened to him... Shouldn't he?
Suddenly, Castiel was in front of me, handing me a plate with some pie on it and I blinked at him surprisedly before taking it. He led me to the table and sat down across from me, smiling slightly when I looked anywhere but at him.
"That's awesome," I encouraged him. "I could work for you every once in a while if you needed some support," I offered and Cas's smile widened.
"You're in my apartment," he said matter-of-factly, his voice deeper than I believed possible, and I shook my head, forcing a smile.
All in all, I couldn't complain. Sure, I was a high school drop out with no job, no friends and no possessions, but then again, all of that faded whenever I looked at Castiel. My love for him was unconditional at this point. One word from him and I'd jump.
Castiel looked at him contemplatingly for a few seconds.
The crowd was silent.
"You!" I exclaimed, eagerly sucking his third finger inside of me, and I moaned loudly when I felt so full with him, so close to satisfaction, coming undone under his hands. I was ready for more in seconds, I
"Again," I demand and Dean is smirking. He cuts me again, a little higher up my forearm and it's mad how good it feels. This cut is deeper, blood spilling out of it, running down my arm and I wanna be covered in it everywhere, that wonderful color glowing all over my skin. The thought makes me whine.
. Castiel knew it was a hopeless task -the dumpsters were huge after all- but he refused to give up and Dean didn't complain.
his words flying across the room. My eyes follow them absent-mindedly but I nod nevertheless, all the while fucking myself back on the man's dick in desperation. I am unfocused but more than great. "Feels even better the second time," he promises and happiness spreads in me all of a sudden, knowing that I'll be feeling like this again. I don't wanna feel anything but this pleasure, pleasure, pleasure.
To be honest, I was a little curious about him. But who wouldn't be? A new neighbor was big news in a small apartment complex like ours and I was already wondering when I would finally meet him for the first time...
I didn't open immediately, not knowing who to expect, so I looked through the spy to make sure. When I saw that it was Benny though, I jumped back from the door like I'd burned myself. He'd looked confused and angry, obviously wanting an explanation for my behavior, but I couldn't look him in the eye and tell him. So I didn't open.
Obviously, it had been mind-blowing.
Castiel managed.
And damn it, but Dean honestly didn't know how to answer that one. 'Because it's a medical drama,' he wanted to say. 'It's
"You should try it out now," she said, leaving no room for arguments.
I was hiding away in my room until late afternoon, rolled up in my blankets, curtains closed, and all I did was think for hours. I couldn't believe what had happened the day before, Dean taking advantage of me like that.
Every night, when it was dark and quiet, Dean closed his eyes and remembered. Remembered
He doesn't know what they're talking about. The only word he can clearly see on screen is
"Nope," Sam replied, not even sparing his brother a look. "Gave me an electric shock so strong I saw stars. He has to be some kind of robot, or cyborg or something."
He braced himself for the pain.
Then he'd think about the rest.
He quickly sent a text back.
"It's... fine," Dean forces out in reply, his gaze involuntarily wandering down the boy's body. His heartbeat's doing something weird that he'd rather not question, so when his gaze falls down to the guy's books scattered all over the floor, he quickly crouches down and starts picking them up one by one.
The alarm didn't go off for another hour. Castiel was asleep again, his nose buried in my hair, while I was wide awake, thinking about last night's happenings.
"Listen," Dean started and took a deep breath. "About Saturday night..."
There's a figure standing near the payphone. A figure of Cas's height, wearing a trench coat, a mop of black hair on his head, and it doesn't even take a millisecond for Dean to know that this really is his Cas. It's irrational, but he just
"No, really," Dean said and his voice turned into something more serious. His smile never faded. "You're a genius, Cas."
Still, Dean was pissed because of Amara's behavior. He thought it was ridiculous and annoying, and he didn't know how she dared to even think she had the right to interfere. The only thing she did achieve was to make Dean angry.
And finally, that was a question Castiel was willing to answer.
"Okay then, I'll just get a pen and some paper to take notes, okay?"
"Well, what is the last thing Sam would expect us to be doing?" he says and I raise my eyebrows expectantly. "I mean, what would have to happen for him to be completely and utterly speechless?" he adds.
What neither of them expected when they arrived back in their lab though, was the unconscious person lying on the on the floor next to the teleporter.
"Sam might," I thought out loud. "He's always been great to me. He left for college though and I barely talk to him anymore."
"Uh, Meg?" he said, turning back to her. "Did something happen?"
"Yeah, real sad," was all I answered.
Slowly, his hand wandered up my thigh, making my dick twitch in anticipation, and this time, I couldn't suppress the moan.
There was no way.
want to kiss him because Dean Winchester, football star extraordinaire, was simply beautiful.
"Real-- Wait, does that mean you
Castiel didn't reply.
"So, what do you really work as, if not as a customer service guy?" Dean wanted to know and Castiel hummed quietly.
"Well, Kevin said that his mom met him in the laundry room a few days ago, and he was reading a book, naked. Like,
Castiel didn't react. Instead, he said, "Get naked."
The ride was actually shorter than ten minutes, but Castiel was already standing outside his house waiting for him when he arrived.
The memory came back quickly. I was with my neighbor Castiel after a night of an intense jerk off session and he was lying in bed next to me at the moment. My chest filled with panic. What had I gotten myself into?
He was wrong. Of course he was. There was no way, Mom wouldn't--
"I- uh-" Alfie starts, nervously sneaking a glance at Dean, who is staring him down murderously. He swallows visibly, but then seems to make a decision and looks back at Castiel confidently, lifting his head higher. "I wanted to ask if you would like to go out with me some time," he eventually says, voice steadier than Dean would have expected, and keeps his gaze on Castiel's face, awaiting a reaction.
It was a much better image, Castiel thought.
His name was Castiel, Mom had told me. He worked from home.
"God, stop! Please don't go all 'Mr. Winchester' on me. That's my father. Just call me Dea--"
Once the light stopped, Castiel hurried over to the plastic thing to inspect it. It was fine -- more than fine actually. The colors hadn't faded, every part was where it belonged... It was his best result so far!
Castiel was a weirdo, that much was clear, and he was probably a little too obsessed with me as well, but did it really matter? As long as we'd repeat last night, I'd put up with almost anything.
"I know how to make it better," he says, realization suddenly dawning on him, and he pulls back to look me in the eye. His pupils are blown wide when he meets my gaze, but he doesn't stare at me for long, hand fiddling with a small box in his pocket.
The next time Castiel saw Dean was later that day during his lunch period. Shoving his books into his locker, Castiel threw the door closed and was treated to the sight of Dean fucking Winchester heading right towards him. He had an embarrassed blush on his face and was looking anywhere but at him.
"I'll be fine," he then said, more to himself than anyone else. "You'll be with me."
Dean walked in the direction of the kitchen in his boxers, Cas thrown over his shoulder lazily, also in just boxers, and they were both smiling stupidly. Dean's hand was holding onto Cas's ass unashamedly.
"Isn't that--"
And with this sentence, the last of Castiel's brain cells burned away. "You want me to meet your parents?" he nearly squeaked, even more mystified than before.
"Uh," Dean started, suddenly looking a little insecure. "Actually, I was thinking, we could, um... I mean... I brought a movie? And popcorn?" he asked more than said and held up the small bag he'd brought with him.
"Yeah. That." His reply was mumbled, eyes getting heavier by the second, and soon he gave in to the temptation of sleep.
"Uh, yes?" Dean replied eventually, realizing he hadn't said anything for too long a time, which was probably why the guy was looking so uncomfortable. Dean forced a small smile on his face, too, so he wouldn't appear as mean as he probably seemed at the moment.
Of course, he wasn't someone to kiss and tell -or at least he wasn't someone to let any names slip- but that didn't exactly stop him from bragging about how he'd just gotten an amazing handjob ten minutes ago or how he'd totally just gotten himself a stay for the night.
Dean pulled back after a couple of seconds.
Was this guy seriously trying to roofie him right now? Castiel had to suppress a sigh. It could've been such a nice night full of vigorous fucking...
?" she asked annoyedly and I sent her an apologetic smile.
this!" Castiel exclaimed. So he was right. This
was he awkward.
He tried tugging harder.
. His head was still thumping painfully, but Dean had had hangovers as bad as this, so it was manageable.
--" Dean stopped, obviously having read the last two words. "--
It was time for a
"Okay..." he sighed. "Still don't feel like sleeping though."
"We both do," he decides, voice hoarse, and he turns away, starting to inspect the wounds on his body. There are a few more cuts than I remember, a big one across his stomach and a smaller one on his hip, a few tiny ones on his biceps.
," was all he commented, sounding slow and dangerous. The man on the other end hurried to comply.
"You know what to do, Cas?" Sam asked and Cas nodded. "Great. We'll be right behind you the whole way. As soon as we figure out where they're taking you, we'll call the police. The rest is up to you."
Castiel stepped behind the console determinedly, anticipation rising him like always when he tested. It was thrilling every time.
His lips barely graze mine then and I press my eyes closed in fear. Is he gonna rape me, too?
Okay, that wasn't true. That had hurt like a bitch.
"I just found out that Alfie is gonna ask out Castiel today," Jess says, giggling excitedly. Dean's head whips towards her. Alfie is gonna do
"Part three, also successful!" he announced, held the rodent up shortly, and shoved it back into its cage. He'd have to keep an eye on it the following few days, he wasn't sure if there were gonna be any repercussions yet. Sure, for now the rodent seemed alright, but you could never know what was happening in a rat's brain.
After dinner, Sam showed Cas pictures of hospitals from around town, asking if he recognized any of them. He did not. Sam said it was fine and promised he'd try looking for more in the vicinity. And that was that.
So Dean continues to search the hallways, head clouded by worry, hands shaking with nervousness.
"What do you mean?" I said monotonously.
Dean is starting to move now, too, groaning and rolling off of me exhaustedly. Apparently, he's not immune to the repercussions either. He sits up with some effort, rubbing his tired eyes and yawning, before he glances over to me expressionlessly.
"Yes," I say, surprising myself. But what reason is there to lie about it?
"No, I am afraid not."
"So you're the infamous Castiel Novak," Dean repeated, smiling at him brightly, and Castiel's heart nearly melted. All he could do was smile back stupidly. "I've heard a lot about you."
The man sighed in frustration.
Now or never, he thought.
So yeah, it is kinda getting harder to stay away from him when he visits just to talk. Especially because Dean seems to have realized what's going on. He seems to know that I'm struggling with staying away, that I need somebody to touch me every once in a while, and he cruelly decided to tease me until I can't take it anymore. He hasn't touch me in days, hasn't even stroked my hair like he does sometimes, and every time he leaves, I have to suppress frustrated tears.
Oh yes, sex was so much better like this...
"Wait," he said and Dean turned to him with raised eyebrows. "What is that?" he questioned.
"I-- I don't know yet. I've got a lot on my plate at the moment, I probably won't have the time..." he lied, hoping that she believed him but also kinda hoping for the opposite and that she'd finally get the fucking hint. Amara didn't visibly react to his words, so Dean still didn't know whether he'd succeeded or not. Instead, her gaze wandered to the bouquet of flowers on his desk, her eyes narrowing suspiciously.
"The first thing I remember is standing in a factory hall," he said slowly.
It was about half a year later that I first spent the night. My roommate Andy had announced that he was gonna be having an epic party in our dorm room -- I didn't know how that was supposed to happen since it was a really small room but I didn't want to be there, just in case. I preferred a good night's sleep to partying.
In only a few words, Castiel explained to Dean how he believed they were able to travel back, meaning, changing Jimmy's teleporter so it was as close to Castiel's one as possible, getting inside and hoping for the best.
The door was still open when he arrived, somebody had obviously just gotten in, and Dean hurried inside just before the doors closed. He barely made it and sighed in relief when he got in just in time. He hated waiting for it to come back down.
I started squirming in his lap, my hard-on hurting uncomfortably at the lack of friction, and I pressed against Castiel's crotch eagerly, thrusting up slightly. He gripped my hips in response and stopped my movements.
be true. There was no way.
But I know it's not quite true and so does Dean.
Sparing one last thought on Dean and his soft lips, his gentle touch, his blinding smile, Cas gripped the leg with both hands.
"I met him in English class. He was reading Vonnegut, Sammy, I couldn't just walk by, right? So I talked to him. His name's Cas -- well,
"What are you doing?" someone asked and I recognized the cold voice immediately. My hands fell away from my ears and I perked up, hope growing within me. It was Castiel, saving me yet again.
Well, he didn't
Cas nodded, again. He had nowhere else to go after all.
"No problem guys, you were a blast to hang out with," Jimmy joked but smiled a little wistfully. "I hope you make it home okay," he said a little more seriously.
"Um... Okay," the man responded awkwardly.
The words hit me like a bullet.
I didn't say a word when he crowded me against the fridge, kissing me eagerly, and I reciprocated like always. It wasn't as if I didn't have the physical strength to shove him away, I just couldn't help myself. I was weak because wanted him. I
Once the man is bleeding from what feels like every pore, his fighting becomes less and less, exhaustion and blood loss making him weak. He won't be alive for much longer.
Conversation continued as smooth as it had been all night, and wasn't it weird that Dean had never spoken so freely on a date before? It was totally unexpected but kind of liberating. He thought about bringing up Jack a few times but decided to put it off for now, and to enjoy the nice time they were having.
Still strutting closer with purpose, he entered Dean's personal space, noticing the way the guy stumbled backwards in surprise, but Castiel ignored it pointedly, his mind only focusing on his mission. It didn't matter if Dean was disgusted, or if he'd never look at him again. Nothing mattered except that Castiel did this. And he would.
"You, uh... You kissed Jimmy," Castiel said slowly, still not looking at Dean, and Dean was thankful for it. His face was burning up all of a sudden.
Focusing back on his beer, he put the thought out of his mind and instead checked his phone for new messages. Sam had texted him two more times, apologizing yet again for standing him up, so Dean replied with a half-honest,
"What happened?" Sam asked, not bothering with small talk. He had to know what was going on, and fast.
"Dude, I just fucked this girl in the janitor's closet and
"Where should I put this?" Castiel then asked, holding up the table, and Dean just shrugged his shoulders.
"Anyway," Castiel now said and turned back to the crowd. "I'm sure you'd like a demonstration. That's why you're here after all."
The last one had been:
"Barely legal then, huh?" he asked, voice lowering suggestively. "I gotta say, you have guts, coming here on your own. Not everyone has intentions as noble as I do concerning barely legal twinks like you."
And that was about the nicest thing Cas had ever heard Dean say to him. Staring at Dean in wonder, he let himself be dragged around yet again, Dean taking care of the rest of the ingredients, not bothering to explain everything for a change.
I'd kissed girls before and it had been nice, but I'd never kissed a boy, let alone a grown man. His lips were chapped and moving underneath mine, his stubble slightly scratching my cheek, and I loved the feeling of it. I went limp under his hands, trusting him completely to make me feel good.
to go out with Castiel? Did it make any difference? He wasn't gay after all; hadn't ever been. He'd slept with more women than he could count, and there was probably no point in going out with Castiel if Dean wasn't even into guys, right?
"Dude, this is awesome already," he muttered and that was the only thing that was said for the next ten minutes. The silence didn't bother Castiel though; to be honest, he almost preferred it. It helped Dean relax and himself to properly get into his work.
"Either that or they were the first ones who got replaced," Dean said. "Also, this probably isn't the only hospital that's in on it. Cas said there were other robots with him, and they went into different vans with different destinations, so it's possible that there's hospitals all over the country that are doing the same."
Determined, Castiel entered the school today, knowing exactly where Dean would usually stay in the mornings, and headed there purposefully. He knew Dean was gonna be in hallway five in the football team's company but honestly, Castiel couldn't care less. It'd be fun to shock those homophobic assholes by kissing their
"Hey man," Dean greeted his friend, smiling, and enveloped him in a quick hug. "Haven't seen you in a while, how have you been?"
"Do you--" I started, feeling stupid for asking, but
When he gets there after what seems like forever, he locks himself inside a stall and breaks down like he never has before. His breathing has steadily been getting worse since leaving the cafeteria, his vision swimming before his eyes - whether from tears or hyperventilation, he cannot tell. Fact is he is hiding in a bathroom stall, gripping the toilet seat tightly, and waits for the world to stop spinning and the tears to stop falling. His chest is heaving with too deep breaths, but he can't seem to control those any more than he can control his pained moans. He's just glad there's nobody else in the room.
Castiel sighed in defeat and looked up at Dean with sad eyes. Apparently even he had gotten the notion that Dean was genuinely hurt.
"Bingo," he agreed and Dean voiced his approval by letting out another guttural moan when Castiel dug his fingers into his neck. For the rest of the massage, he continued to stay mostly silent though. All in all, the atmosphere was calming for the both of them and if Castiel was being honest a little arousing as well, considering that the occasional moan which left Dean's throat was downright porn material.
"Yes, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night, as you might recall," he explained, winking, and Charlie shouted a fake-disgusted, "Gross, Cas!"
Cas didn't come up again in our conversation.
"Where are you going?" I whimper and wince at how pathetic I sound.
Pacing the room in agitation, Metatron waited for Inias to arrive, so he could scream his anger out at him. As if on cue, there was a knock on the door.
backwards. He tilted his head in confusion and brought up his left hand to try and tug at his arm, but it wouldn't budge. What was wrong with him?
Seconds later, I was asleep.
When he finally got home, he was as exhausted as he hadn't been in a long time, but he'd promised Sam to meet up with him at the Roadhouse after work. So even though he didn't really feel like it, he left the house half an hour later, quickly shooting a text to his mom to thank her again for looking after Jack. With Mary taking care of Jack, it was the only way he could get a night out anymore. Not that he didn't love Jack. He loved the shit out of the little guy! Nevertheless, he did make going out rather complicated.
as well. Seeing as he got rid of the signal receiver inside of him, he
?" Dean exclaimed and embarrassedly withdrew to the other end of the couch. Castiel quickly followed him, taking his hands reassuringly.
"Shit," Dean cursed. "I didn't realize. I always thought it was one or the other – Dad always... He always said I was straight because I liked girls. It made sense at the time, I just... I didn't know."
Frowning, Sam looked down on his phone, reading his brother's message a second and then a third time before quickly dialing his number.
Castiel always knew how to cheer me up though.
And because Dean didn't seem to be able to say no to anything tonight, he agreed without a second thought.
I stay quiet. What does he expect me to say?
"I do not know," Cas replied quietly. "I appear to be stuck," he explained and turned his gaze back to his arm hanging in the middle of the air. The man's eyes followed him.
"Lean over," he ordered and I bowed down, revealing my hole to him completely, propping myself up on my hands. "You can make all the sounds you want today, Dean."
I sighed. There was no use thinking about it any longer, at least I
"No way, babe! Jus' feeling a li'l drowsy. Must've drunk too much," he explained, but Castiel knew that was bullshit. He knew the real reason for Dean's behavior and it was only a matter of time until Dean himself would realize. Hopefully, he'd be too far gone to voice his thoughts by then.
Grocery shopping had been a success, in Dean's eyes.
"Well, his name is Jack," Dean began, voice rough and hands clammy.
Cas just continued looking at Dean before he had to glance away for a moment, and then nodded solemnly. "I understand," he replied. Weirdly enough, he didn't even feel insulted by Dean's mistrust. It was justified after all.
He continued, "Adding to that is the fact that we don't know what they were planning to do with you once in the hospital, so checking the place out would be smart either way," he added, more to himself than Dean or Cas. "We also don't know your maker's plan. All we know is that there's lots of robots that look like real-life people running around, possibly being controlled by someone we don't know. It's a little confusing. I wonder what that guy's goal is," he muttered.
"Obviously not," Castiel grumbled in reply. "It's gonna take ages to get the teleporter up to my standards and send me back."
But then again, I can barely remember what they looked like; life truly seems to slow down when you're locked in.
"Are you
"Got him," Dean suddenly announced and pressed down on his phone. His eyebrows raised in surprise. "Okay, that's weird," he decided and held up his Smartphone to present the Facebook page of one Jimmy Novak, his profile picture big on the screen.
"Excellent idea," Castiel agreed and pulled Dean up quickly. The two of them almost sprinted upstairs, getting rid of their clothes on the way, and as good as jumped on the bed once they reached it.
Dean's heart shattered.
"Yes, that's the one. He can be... difficult sometimes, but out of all my brothers, he's the one I like best," Castiel explained.
And then, because he really liked Castiel and thought the man was too shy for his own good, he added,
They lived together, or so it seemed.
According to Jimmy, the nearest burger joint was just down the street, thankfully, and for whatever reason, you could get burgers for breakfast. Castiel didn't dare complain about it but silently cursed himself for not having thought about a burger breakfast before. It seemed like the perfect idea.
care, Dean," Castiel insisted and came to sit next to him. "I didn't
His words naturally put a damper on the mood -- the silence that followed was heavy and thoughtful, and Dean couldn't stand the look in Cas's eyes. He averted his gaze quietly.
"No, Inias, I
"He's like a
"Show me," Dean said breathlessly.
It's the first time I ever have sex and I don't want to lose my virginity to a stranger, much less a killer, and I struggle and fight and scream at him to let me go. But Dean only sets his jaw in annoyance and takes me anyway. It hurts and makes me feel filthy, and even though I come, I don't feel good in any way. I'm broken when Dean is done with me.
team captain.
Not saying anything, Jimmy leaned back and watched Castiel fiddling with a screw in frustration. It just wouldn't
The laugh that escaped Castiel's mouth finally startled Dean out of his stupor and he blinked his eyes open in a daze.
Mom left right after dinner, only sending a quick, "See you later," my way, and then she was gone. I stayed alone in an empty flat with too many dark thoughts surrounding me.
"Ah, so your brother put you up to this?" Dean smirked, remembering the few hilarious times he'd embarrassed Sammy by giving him awful advice on flirting.
Again, he couldn't have said how many minutes he was out, but when he came back to himself, Sam was already speaking, "...should be fixed now."
"Cas?" he asked through the door, sounding worried. "You haven't been out of your room all day, are you alright?"
He motioned for him to get inside and Dean did so willingly. He'd been in there a few times already.
"You trust your machine, don't you? Now prove just how much you believe in it."

"You know, I might just do that," he said and I could practically
The pictures were masterpieces, Castiel knew. He just wasn't so sure Dean would see it that way.

It wasn't as if he
Sadly, he pulls away after a few seconds, aware of the other dude's eyes on us.
Castiel's heart shattering as he visibly deflated. Dean felt sick all of a sudden, the words like lead on his tongue. "I'm... I'm honored, really," he continued, trying to save what was left to save, trying to make Castiel feel less rejected than he did right now. He wasn't sure if that was even possible. "The flowers you sent me, they... they were beautiful, really. And I appreciate that you fixed the elevator for me, but... But I just don't swing that way."
Castiel tearing at Dean's abused nipple with his teeth, its color so red it was almost glowing.
"You-- You thought I was cute?" was all Castiel gathered from that.
"Did you sleep at all tonight?" Jimmy asked and came to sit next to him on the floor. He was in a better mood today and almost emphatic concerning Castiel. Not that the latter was able to appreciate it, really.
"Hey, Sammy," Dean replied, turning his body towards me slightly. Cas only smiled at me in greeting.
hurting.' But that answer didn't seem to grasp exactly what Cas was asking.
Until suddenly, he fell to his knees.
I nodded without hesitation. Right now, I'd do anything Dean said. I wanted to learn, wanted
In the laundry room, there were two rows of washing machines and I quickly walked over to the one I normally used. Castiel chose the one in the second row, directly across from me, and I couldn't help but look at him from time to time while putting my dirty clothes inside the machine.
I knew it was a bad idea, it was a
From the moment Dean answers the phone, he's hoping. He knows it's impossible, he
"Excuse me if I
He started writing.
His second finger pressed inside right next to his first one. I moaned again, trying to fuck myself onto Dean's finger and he increased his speed slightly when he felt how eager I was. It didn't take long until I was ready for the third one.
"Everything," Dean replied teasingly, knowing he was about to drive Sam crazy. He continued before Sam could say anything. "I know how Cas's maker did it, Sam. I know what their plan is and I know how they pull it of. And believe it or not, their plan really
"Okay."
Today when Dean found me, Mom was out jogging, leaving me alone with my step-father yet again. I was in the kitchen, looking for something to eat when he came in, fixing me with that look I'd gotten used to over time.
"What is the point of this game?" he asked curiously.
Dean didn't spend a lot of time with me today at all, being out of the house for once, but it's okay because I know where he is. He told me that he had to pick up an old friend, some guy named Benny... It's the first time I heard Dean talk about anyone else but Sam and I am kinda jealous but then again, Dean'll return to me every time, so I am not all that worried. I'm the one Dean
I only stood up in response.
Castiel smiled at him in response. "Yes," he said simply. "I'd like that."
One last pleading look at the man next to her -he only glanced away uncomfortably- and Castiel deflated. There was nothing he could do, he realized. He knew right in that moment that he didn't actually have a choice anymore.
He was dragged into an aisle full of baking supplies and headfirst into Dean's explanation on the importance of knowing all the different kinds of flour. It was very detailed and proved a little too much, and it made Cas's head swim after barely a minute. Nevertheless, he tried to catch as much as possible. (Spoiler alert: It wasn't a lot.)
, Inias," he scolded, a smug, I-am-better-than-you expression on his face. "We're replacing them with
"So perfect for me, Cas, such a
Castiel smiled soothingly and shook his head while leaning over to me, and my heartbeat slowed down slightly. Castiel wouldn't harm me, would he?
Speaking of Amara, Meg told him a few days later that she'd had to rip the flowers out of Amara's greedy hands more than once; she'd apparently decided not to let Dean receive them in her jealousy. So far, she'd failed and Dean was always greeted with the sight of a beautiful bouquet on his desk.
He walks over towards me, stumbling a little and I barely have time to wonder about what's wrong with him when he's pressing me into the wall, kissing me hungrily. I try to push him away, just like always, but he insists and only presses in harder. A sob leaves my throat and I make one last attempt at shoving him away when suddenly... He's gone.
"So, how do you wanna do this?" Castiel asked seductively.
"What do you mean?" Dean asks and he raises his eyebrow. He seems concerned.
"I won't," I promise weakly, almost whispering. I probably wouldn't have tried anything even without him telling me. I'm way too scared for that.
"Are you two done being awkward?" Jimmy suddenly asked, standing in the half-opened door. When he saw Dean and Castiel sitting on the floor staring at each other, he sighed. "Obviously not," he commented but entered the room nevertheless. They'd probably never stop doing this if he left.
"That's great, Cas," Sam said genuinely and took the photo in hand. "Now we found the hospital at least. It doesn't get us the location of the factory hall you mentioned, but that's alright; we can at least keep an eye on the building."
It was in senior year when Dean Winchester met Castiel Novak and his world seemingly turned around. Nobody knew what exactly had happened or that it had anything to do with Castiel, but there was no denying that all of them noticed the change in Dean. It wasn't a particularly big change, he still seemed as content and confident and lady-killer-y as he usual, but his bragging slowly got quieter and less all together.
"That's good," Castiel muttered and forced a smile.
"Yeah, of course, I just..." Dean started and gulped down his guilt. This was harder than he'd thought. "I just haven't been completely honest with you."
and date me before damning it all to hell. I'll let you decide," Castiel concluded, getting up before Dean could even gather his words, and left the bathroom like a motherfucker.
Sam and Dean had told him he might have to put in some passwords and they'd had a rather easy solution for it as well. Underneath Cas's cover, they'd hid a small device that would help him crack open the door, but something stopped Cas from taking it out. It was the
I look up at Dean.
"Don't worry, I took care of that," he explained.
Dean looked away at that, not wanting to see Castiel's pitying face when he'd inevitably refuse him. "Of course I am, Cas. Everybody knows that... Even Balthazar did," he replied, annoyed.
"Can I ask... why?" Castiel asked hesitantly and his gaze flickered to Dean shortly and back to the wall.
"Two men made us leave the car. We were standing in front of a hospital, I believe. They ushered us inside but I became distracted for a few seconds -there was a child's drawing of a bee hanging on the wall- and when I looked up again, the others were gone."
"Did you get bullied?" Dean wants to know and he sets his jaw hard, seeming weirdly upset. My heart flutters when I realize he's angry at my harassers.
"You-" Dean started to reply but that was when their drinks arrived at the table and he was effectively cut off for now. They toasted to a nice evening and each took a sip of their beverages.
It wouldn't surprise him if he was one of them. He just hoped he'd manage to do enough damage during that one hit.
"Working hard as always, I see," a voice behind him suddenly said and Castiel spun around in surprise. Dean Winchester! What the hell was he doing here?
"And since when is that? Please don't tell me for, like, ever," I groaned.
He put the shirt in the machine as well and then took off his socks and pants, and threw them in, too, leaving him standing in his boxers. I couldn't help looking down at his crotch for a moment, noticing the obvious outline of a hard dick underneath the white cloth, before my gaze flew up again.
they know how to build a memory transfer-er?" Dean said, having gotten to the end of his speech, and waited for Sam to stomach it all.
Uncomfortably, Castiel tugged at the collar of the stupid suit thingy every one of the employees was obligated to wear and once again cursed Gabriel in his head -- this time for him being as small as he was because sadly and without a doubt, this suit was
Sandover. Not Winchester. But how...? What did that even
"Th-Thank you again, Mr. Winchester," Castiel forced out, trying to keep calm, but his heart was thumping in his chest excitedly. What was it about this man that threw him off so much? One flirty comment and he was a slobbering mess...
His apology didn't feel like enough.
"I didn't notice you looking, and I wasn't avoiding you -- especially not because of something like that," Dean said firmly, but then frowned. "Well, I mean, I
His tongue found its way back into my mouth and I let my mind go blank again, simply
Apparently, I'm where I belong.
"Thank you, Dean," Castiel said genuinely, holding up his glass in an obvious gesture. "To my stupidity?" he asked and Dean laughed, picking up his own drink. "To your stupidity," he agreed, clinking his glass against Castiel's, and they both took a few sips.
For a guy anyway, he added as an afterthought.
"What's the name of the guy you despise the most?" he then asks and I tilt my head in confusion. Why does he want to know?
"Hey, Cas?" Dean asked somberly.
"Uh, we'll see," Dean replied, undecided. He wasn't really in the mood for a hook-up tonight. Hell, he hadn't even been in the mood for a party in the first place, but he wasn't gonna pass up the chance to see Benny again. It'd been too long.
A few seconds later he was ready to start, sitting in his chair again. Dean's skeptical -but also mighty curious- gaze never left Cas's face.
"Um... Lie down on the table, please," he instructed quickly and waited for Dean to comply before walking over to the switch to turn off the lights. The candles were the only thing illuminating the room now and Castiel had to admit, if this wasn't a professional situation, the candles would create an
Cas narrowed his eyes in thought. "Not that I can remember," he said. "But then again, I cannot remember

"So, Cas," Sam started, sitting down again, and Cas glanced up again. "Do you know where we can... open you up? You know, uh, to try and fix you?" he asked awkwardly and Cas frowned, thinking. Whenever someone even came close to him in that factory hall, they were standing behind him. So his back was probably the most likely location.
He takes it out and opens it.
Cas looked up at Dean. "What does that mean?" he asked. Was he Jimmy Novak? Was that his real name? What if he lost his memory or something...
"How do you know my name?" I ask timidly, deciding that I could at least satisfy my curiosity if I was going to be used and killed anyway.
Then again, they actually somewhat were friends, he assumed. Just with a few benefits.
invention, you know everything about it. All you have to do is talk about it for like five minutes," he reassured him.
cute. And hot as fuck," Dean hummed and leaned forward to nose at Castiel's throat, applying little kisses to the tender skin, and continued. "When I gave you my number I hoped you'd ask me for a date," he explained. "And when you did call, I thought 'massage' was a code word for sex."
