Yesterday, on December 2nd, Shirley Holmes, the great-grandniece of the legendary Sherlock Holmes, explained to the once again-baffled police of Redington that a smuggler ring is right under their noses—quite literal—as the noses of many snowmen in town were, in fact, the perfect hiding place for drugs.
"HOLMES!"
Suddenly there was a tremendous crash as if one wall had fallen in.

A male voice had cried out his name as the gunfire had continued.
Just like his feelings towards John Watson.

The doorbell rang. Short, once, with pressure. Like a client.
"All I want for Christmas is you, Holmes," replied the doctor, looking at him full of desire. He bent down again to kiss him, hungry, before grabbing him by the thighs and taking him in his arms, carrying him to the bed. He was determined to take the gift he so longed for, without knowing

Sherlock does the breathing exercise his doctor — not John – recommended. Back then Sherlock had scoffed. But it helps. In, out, in, out. It improves his stress level too. He feels calmer, more balanced, and Sherlock would be royally pissed if it wasn’t so counterproductive.

"Unless…" Sherlock Holmes said, looking soft, not quite the man the architect and consultant expected to meet given the background information of their clients’ more active days. The two women, mid-thirties, red-headed, career-driven, were prepared to be mocked, deduced and called names. Instead, they were watching a man following his partner's lead.

The first night in Sherrington. We were like newlyweds. Suddenly, we were so shy that we dressed separately in the bathroom. The new bedroom, a shared bed, was such a thrilling feeling.
“John, we don’t even have all the ingredients.” Valid point, Sherlock believes. “I’m banned from Tesco. And you hate shopping. Remember your incident with the chip-and-pin-machine?”
Returning to Crevecoeur Hall hours later, our spirits were high. My Holmes was in a good mood, and I was smiling. However, we stopped in our tracks, brought back to reality in mere seconds.
"She is also concerned with Mr Landsbury's will," replied Mr Arbucklehurt calmly.

There was a silent conversation going on, a talk that might have gone something like this:

We still own the notes. From time to time, I take the box out from its compartment. It is still the same box, a similar one I got in my youth from my grandfather, the one I kept all the treasures from my boyhood. I never knew it existed until I came back to Sherrington almost half a century later and rediscovered it. It was quite a time capsule, and the complete trip was a walk down memory lane.

For half a year now, John had been back in London. His birth city that used to be his home for decades, did not scare John (or, so he claimed). Yet, his new situation was alienating, and so he held his cane protectively, clutching his updated CV to his chest. If asked, John would say he believed it was the immensity. The hugeness of things below. The darkness of dreams. He was afraid of his memories: the ones in which he was dressed all in black-and-white and the ones in which he carried the military bearing that was apparent to him alone. John Watson was anxious about London with its sheer quantity of people, all shapes and sizes, as they spilt from their high, filthy buildings onto the sidewalks. He was petrified of the honking hullabaloo of the traffic, and he was even worried of the air, which smelled both dirty and sweet—nothing at all like the air of Afghanistan.
Mike was perpetually cheerful, self-deprecating, getting soft and round as a university professor. He had only stopped his easy smiling when John had replied to his inquiry about what he had done in Afghanistan with “Getting shot”.
“Tell me what you want. Short and quick, and don’t bore me. I assume that my brother Mycroft Holmes has sent you to me.

Everything was so cold. What

"I suffered the same fate, Dr Watson. This war was absurd." I bristled, but I did my utmost to keep my emotion under control. Our client was going through hard times. Surely, they caused his bitterness. “It was a useless war, costing us far too many men, good and brave ones.”

There was the potter, the cloth maker, the woodworker, and many more.

A little later, we sat next to each other in our sitting room. The evening was still close and oppressive.

Holmes put his hand on Landsbury’s shoulder and led him back to his chair. A young woman appeared, a glass of alcohol in her hand, clearly worried. Holmes grabbed the glass and forced it into Landsbury's hands, who drained it in one sip.
I will stop the rest of my conversation with Miss Parker at this point, as it was far too intimate and surely of no interest for the reader. Let just say that the governess suffered from conditions more serious than vomiting and could lead to a miscarriage if a doctor did not stop it. I helped the young woman as best I could. Then Doctor Lewis arrived and took over, much to Miss Parkers’ relief.
“You think so?”
John wouldn’t be surprised if suddenly a new batch of thumbs, heads and other body parts had appeared in the fridge.
Forcing myself to calm down, I returned to sit opposite Holmes and tried to take an interest in the medical papers in my lap.

If Sherlock doesn’t want to suffer from arthritis in retirement, he should look after himself better. His doctor — not John – has reminded him of that fact repeatedly. It’s not that Mike Stamford isn’t correct — he’s a good doctor, even though he’s not John – but it’s a nuisance.

It was indeed less than a minute before we heard the door of the front of the house opening to the laboratory and what sounded like two men.

After all, even in the maddening absence of an answer, John could not remember where the sex had stopped
Where are the days in which he could wake up without pain? His right knee, for instance, bothered him last weekend. He had taken a nap on the sofa, and that was how his body showed his gratitude! Sherlock would have scoffed far more if he hadn’t been so occupied searching for pain meds.
Another pause. A shook of cutlery.
It was in the early hours when we opened our eyes.

There was nothing for John outside London—no family to count on, no friends devoted enough to offer support—so he had to make do. John sensed he would lose his lodgings again because he screamed in the night.
"Poisoned." The clipped reply.
Sherlock hums. John could interpret it as “yes”.
The interview of the co-worker confirmed the victim had catered to an only male clientele for roughly half a year, but no BDSM connection as far as he recalled.

Inspector Stanley sent for me around ten o'clock. Mrs Nordon wanted to speak to Sherlock Holmes and to placate her. The inspector finally agreed. But Holmes, not being there, I went to Norwich Police Station alone. I picked up my doctor's kit on the off-chance, fearing that the unfortunate young woman must be in a state, critical in her condition. The inspector's first words only heightened my concerns.
“If you have eliminated the impossible…”
I was having none of it.
It's well past ten when Sherlock drags himself to the piano. Normally, his practice starts at 8:00 sharp. His mind is sluggish; too much caffeine and not enough sleep. Most distracting are the thoughts about John, however, painting his war memories in the ever grimmer palette with each passing moment. There is the echo of John’s outcry replaying forever.
My proposal seemed honest to me, but the maid made a displeased face. The colonel seemed confused. He didn’t seem to know what course to take either.

It was true what he had answered when she had asked that night over fish-and-chips: “How do you stop loving someone?”, “You don’t.” Because John Watson loved Sherlock Holmes. Yet he knew it was vital to let him go.
The ‘Ladies’ companion’ is believed to have been carved from elephant tusks in China. The Chinese were famous for carving ivory, and the quality of the carving is so good, I think that is where he would have had it done. He would not have known that he was coming home, and would have wanted his wife to have this. Though the fine detail of the sex toy was done in China, its container was made in Ireland.

Without further explaining the meaning of this cryptic poem or offering a translation, Holmes left the house. I followed, baffled.
Or that there is only one man on this earth who surprises the great Sherlock Holmes: my John.
It is something I learned during my years as a beekeeper: to focus inwardly and to use my talents at self-observation. Earlier, I had deduced passersby in the streets and England's finest criminals, and sometimes I had played a trick on my companion or had tried to teach him my methods.
Nowadays they bickered and bantered, her visits longer each time. There was officially no plan for a move, but John might have spun a plan to rebuild a wing, or maybe even both. Apparently, Sherrington Hall had been much larger in the past.
"You are inheriting a fine fortune, Madame. "
"It was foolish to leave the Winsterneys without treatment. Or to run off into the cold. Whatever have you been thinking, Holmes? You are no longer a young man!"
John could concede the point that the ever-present umbrella could be useful today: November was approaching. Clouds had darkened the sky all day, and around midday, the drizzle had turned into heavy rain. In the evening fog had set over the city. Now, it was a dark and stormy night. It would be heartless to let a man stand longer than necessary on the doorstep, but John was tempted.
“But...how?”
At this, John Watson grins at him, and Sherlock Holmes grins back.

While John hurried the seventeen steps back to 221b, the repeated “John!” were following him now, however not as an echo of a ghost.

After a glance at the list, Sherlock pointed out one name: Mr, formerly Dr, Neil. Apparently, he'd been struck off when his addiction got the better of him. He'd helped himself too liberally to the contents of the pharmacy.
I whisper endearments in his ears, as well as propositions for later when we retire to one of our bed chambers. With every minute passing by, I get bolder; heady feeling to be in love and to be loved in return. Oh, and how his cheeks are flushed already. Pretty as a picture!
So, he faked his voice, just like his identity. If one had just really listened to him one would observe his faultlessness; and one would have deduced that his reputation, fortune and background had been forged by his intelligence.

I didn’t dare to question his motive, but his disguise as Sherlock Holmes made me uneasy.

Watson has heard it once before: by the same man, uttered in this room, only yesterday. The events of today haven’t been enough to push the memories out of his head. Frankly, Watson fears he will never forget it: the one night during which they shared a bed.

So we made our way through the snow, as content as two men can be. The snowflakes were so thick and heavy that they fell and covered our footprints almost immediately.
Oh, I wish I had more time to tell you all about Doyle: what it was like before John Watson returned, how lonely Sherlock Holmes had been then, and about the great battle that had sent Watson home and started it all.
He moved closer to Mrs Nordon and placed both hands on the table, in the attitude of a victor. He proclaimed, barely hiding his triumph in his voice: "So it is settled, Mrs Nordon? Isn't it better to come to an agreement and share the Colonel's fortune? Doesn't 500 pounds make a beautiful sum?
"No, it was an order from Inspector Stanley."
Sherlock looked around, so surprised that he could not even reply for the next four seconds.
“You can rely on me, Holmes.”
It was true what I let slipped out when we chatted for a few minutes, recalling once again the days of the past, while our prisoner vainly wriggled to undo the bonds that held him.

I was going to miss them. They knew more about myself and my family than I did, but I comforted myself with them not knowing what has become of me. They had their lives, and maybe the memory of the old John Watson, Johnny, as they called him. When I glimpsed my companion, who seemed to wait for me, sitting aloof from them, I did not want to change it for the world.
“I know it is all ridiculous but... why do you think he uses such a bluff?”
“I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you have a sister who is worried about you but you will not go to her for help because you do not approve of her—possibly, because she is an alcoholic, more likely because she recently walked out on her wife. And I know we met because I am a Jinn. It is fate, kismet, whatever you like to call it, John—and believe me, I wished things were different, too. I hate surprises just like you. That’s enough to go on with, don’t you think?” Sherlock turned and walked into the room again. As if an afterthought, he added, “Yes, I am always like that.”
This was my third mistake. One that couldn’t be shrugged off lightly.
Now, I need to alter my plan once more: “Watson, John, it’s me.”
Surely, Mrs Hudson was already engaged in many preparations: ordering the goose, baking, the overall cleaning of the house. One reason I had left the house so early today, to be frank, was I had wanted to flee the busy haze. Sharing the mulled cider with Holmes in the evening, the fire blazing hot, and we, sitting next to each other as content as two men can be, was rather wonderful, but the household chores were naturally not our strong forte. Our maids even outbid Mrs Hudson in their enthusiasm for home decor. If they had any saying, the tree would be up on December 1st. To the cheer of the Irregulars, of course.

The soldiers in the station are battered and bruised, too young to die but too old for the world already; in them, I see Watson in younger days. I refuse to think of my honey because to give them the secret won’t save them, it would only prolong the pain. There is no meaning in war, not one set in Afghanistan nor here, war is war, and that’s everything. What I hope to bring my Watson is peace.

“Watson, it’s the science of deduction paired with the new field of medicine: psychology. Both, I think I do not need to elaborate further, dear doctor. The phenomena I am referring to is déjà vu: the feeling that someone has relieved a situation already. In your case, it means that your subconscious—I think that is the term Sigmund Freud used—links the scene with a traumatic incident in your past. Rather elementary, don’t you think?”
While he wants to rush into his mind palace and update this vital information in John’s room (which gets bigger every day, soon he'll get his own wing, not that Sherlock minds), he realises that he hasn't reacted to John's admission.
Normally I would storm out to my club, Holmes would torture the violin in reaction, and if all was lost, we would both have it out in the boxing ring. There Holmes would take part and I would enjoy a little gamble—and always to bet on my man, of course—and later, I would patch him up.
His world was irreversibly changed: a life without Sherlock seemed impossible now.
. "And this is one way the illustrious Mr Marley made his fortune: fraud."
Instead of explaining, he ordered me to go to Crevecoeur Hall alone. There, I should wait for his return.
We didn’t shout it like the youngsters who were being placated by Greg and Donovan. I did it in simple things, like fishing Sherlock’s smartphone out of his trouser pocket. He needed to look up the London scene immediately because whenever there were activists, the bigots weren't far off.
The eyes had reopened in a steel grey flash. Holmes gave me a piercing look. I had spoken without thinking, just trying to cheer him up. It might not be wise, but it was necessary. I could not stomach to witness my Holmes' hopelessness.
I did not know that I would see him again soon under even more peculiar circumstances.
He was silent for a moment, as the strains of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" wafted up from a platoon of listless carol singers on the street corner.
I read the following headline and accompanying article aloud:
When Miss Parker approached the table, Landsbury rushed to pull out a chair for her. Whenever their gazes met, she smiled at him, which he returned promptly. I turned to Holmes and gave him a pointed look. It was rather obvious that those two were lovers! It pleased me to outwit my partner’s character analysis for once.
“The writer of these lines didn't lie the first time. I'm afraid he's not lying this time around, either. Our man is the one who kidnapped and killed Adèle, he's just trying to get Mrs Nordon accused of her crime.”
: How was it for you, Dr Watson, when you heard that Sherlock Holmes has got a protege? And one that was so similar to him? Wasn’t that a huge shock for you?
"Please understand our position, please."
“Let me” had been the only warning before Sherlock had taken him into his mouth. No, that wasn’t accurate: sucked him down, in one go, almost to the root. John had believed
“I imitated the colonel's handwriting.”
“No. Few of us. People know nothing about my people here. They think we grant wishes. If I could grant wishes, do you think I would drive a cab?”
"Why didn't you contact me before?"
Surprised by our intrusion, while flattered by the words of Holmes, the cook knew how to react. She ushered us to sit down. The soon served scones were still hot.
A hundred yards southwards along Baker Street, three men were struggling. Two of them were bundling the third man into a cab against his will.
Sherlock raised himself to his full height.
Sherlock had been
“The coachman?” Holmes asked, unsurprisingly.
Therefore, Sherlock Holmes pretended to have not a heart. Yet he had always had one and still did. A heart that now belonged to John Watson. A heart whose love burned inside the man, made of fire, like the hottest flames known to humankind.
John is not staring at his partner, neither is his mouth hanging open. Hurriedly, he picks up some food to cover and recover. Should he check Sherlock for a concussion or a fever? Potential aftereffects of the rip?
Sherlock lectured us on the difference between the “normal” cross and one used here: "St Andrew would have considered it too great a blasphemy to crucify anyone the same way as Christ, so would have used the diagonal cross instead."
Put all your soul into it, play the way you feel!
“You, sir, are guilty as sin, and I- no, we, my partner and I — despise you. But mark my words: The queer community is stronger than people like you. We’ll survive and thrive and continue to live and love.”
“As far, it is quite obvious.”
“So: right man and right place, but not the right time.”
“Prepare something for yourself,” he called back. “I am afraid I have sent Mrs Hudson away. I cannot risk the lives of innocent people. And Watson, be so good to stay away from the basement. Confine yourself to our own rooms and the kitchen, there’s a good fellow.”
Holmes and I deserve a soft epilogue, and how does the saying go?
“Sherlock...”
"What do you say?" Holmes turned his head to look at Watson with shining eyes, smiling at him in that special way he reserved only for him. Then he returned all his attention to the tree and he stood on his toes just enough to let the wreath pass over its top, beginning to decorate it.
"Why Holmes," I said laughing, "I fear you are becoming Mr Scrooge from the celebrated Dickens story."
Sherlock uses his well-trained technique to focus:

I jumped to the conclusion that a devout catholic might be the killer. Sherlock wasn’t pleased.
HOLMES: Because I am Sherlock Holmes, the greatest detective of all time.
“Right. My father was probably the only man on earth that your grandfather confided in. On the day of his disappearance, he drove to the house in the morning as usual. He should have been returning around three o’clock in the afternoon, as he had said to my mother. As the two houses are close, it should not have taken him long. Yet, between those few miles, he disappeared and was never seen again. How is that possible? People cannot simply vanish!”
“Have you searched for a sedative, Molly?”
I didn’t like it one bit.
Sherlock feels something twist in his chest. How long has he, Watson, wanted this? How long has John needed it?
"They invite me regularly to their country party." Landsbury smiled condescendingly. "The Winsterneys have a higher rank, they are nobles."
"Do you deny you were going to marry him?"
We had reached the estate. It had taken us considerably less time as we had rushed here before the weather turned for the worst. I hoped that no snow would fall because if this would be the case, we would be well and truly fucked, or so I feared. However, as I would learn soon: my Holmes had some tricks up his sleeves.
It’s her line - and England would fall when she’s going to leave Baker Street: “A nice cuppa? I’ve made a cake, a simple one, mind you. Not very celebratory. Will pop over to the shops later!”
For the third time this week, I woke early and alone.

. I had feared to lose my companion, and the cliffs brought it back. Déjà vu, nothing more to it than that. I was a doctor, I reasoned to myself. I turned my eyes away from the horizon and onto my companion.
“Watson, this is David Jones. His father was once the private valet at your grandfather’s estate in Sherrington. He could recall you, even if you do not remember him. Until recently, Mr Jones believed you to be dead or at least severely ill. He will give us the full report about the events in a moment. Before doing so, can we offer you another brandy, Mr Jones? Or something else?”
"And all the ribbons..."
Urgently, John replied, “Are
This is his design, his masterpiece.
“Nonsense.”
"Did he say that?"
“Bear with me, my dear Watson, I beg you. You know that I have tried to keep my work here secret but how certain can one be about that. The police are involved in these matters and are aware of my experiments. Who knows whether one junior or even a senior member of the forces is not involved with this utter ruthless villain? Now, having alerted them the newspaper report might be the case would not be assumed that you would no longer be in London, and he would further assume that you would no longer share this premises with me.”
"Hah, Watson!" he groaned. "What has happened to the criminal fraternity? Where are their invention and creativity? Three months have passed since any singular crime came my way—you recall the Case of the Exploding Beehive? Since then, nothing but poison-pen letters and stolen bicycles."
Alas, at this moment Sherlock wasn’t paying attention, too busy examining the note.
Girl power!

Holmes did not emerge from his infernal basement, and Mrs Hudson did not appear with an evening meal. I cannot recall how the rest of the evening passed.

"Count Winsterney told me he served as a witness for the making of the will. As the little heiress, Adèle Landsbury is a minor, Winsterney has been chosen as guardian in case her father, Colonel Landsbury, dies too soon. Count Winsterney is Adèle’s godfather."
How was my dear Watson doing?

myself relieved he had gone.
Stranger things have happened, like Sherlock Holmes on a date. Sherlock doesn't quite remember what made him mention that John has asked him out, but suddenly he's pleased. It’s a warm, fuzzy feeling which needs to be shared with the world. Instinctively, he goes to his piano. Normally, it's another 20 minutes until his practice starts. Today, he improvises again. For the second day in a row, his heart rules over his mind.

welcome and cherished, but not ready to be shared with the world.
“Landsbury left a farewell message telling about the dead Adèle and the guilty Jane. He must have cracked. There is no logic in suicide.”
John nodded. “Didn’t remember it until we moved out here. It freaked me out as you can recall Those bloody cliffs are still the same. I used to sit under them, to escape from my family.” He cleared his throat. “In particular, my sister Harry.” His attention shifted to the horizon. “They spent three days sniping and shouting. The third day, I sat here, all day, on this beach, right into the night. Thinking, I will not have a family. When I got back, they were livid. They had been out looking for me. They didn’t think to look on the bloody beach, mind.”
The good widow, Mrs Partridge, had been agreeable without a ruse yesterday, and that should have been suspected on its own. The alternative would be to let her never meet Mrs Hudson. However, that outcome was better than a blackmail case.
“Have you ever heard of a quasi-religious reenactment group in Soho?”
Maybe it was this knowledge that spurred Holmes into action when the young woman wanted to take revenge: a bottle of vitriol had been in her hand in a flash. Quick and persuasive, Holmes convinced her to abandon it, to let go of the past and focus on a brighter future.

Feeling validated, I observed the governess.
allows no harsh words. Yes, they might be chatty. Yes, they might be soft in their heads. Yes, they all talk only of men. But that’s no reason for Phillip Anderson to yell at them and call them names. They were only asking him politely if he wanted to have a bath, some herbal soap or a massage. It’s all proper! And if Anderson jumped to a conclusion, surely he was at fault. Yes, it isn't wise to ask a strong man such things. Yes, they understood now that it had made him the laughing-stock of his lad. But if they’ve learned a lesson, so shall he.

Surely, neither Sherlock has neither, nor he intends to repeat it. It cannot be done, surely. It’s up to Watson to be the level-headed of the two again. Any second now, he will refuse to follow him to bed a second time.

I gave a small nod. If it was in my capacity to give, I would concede Mary-Ann’s wish.
I finally freed myself and took her two small hands in mine.
Sherlock’s cheeks seem to be reddish, it’s all a mess, man and bed. One could observe and deduce so much from the display, but John had forbidden himself to go down that path for a long time. Normal people react similarly. There is nothing normal about him and neither about himself.

“At the trial?” I cried, surprised.
I did not know what role I played in this mystery and what led me to forget Sherrington Hall for all those years, but when being in Holmes’ arms, it did not matter. I knew that just as the sun rises every morning that he would tell me then. He knew who I really was. I knew how I felt when I was with him, and that was all that mattered. I trusted him, simple as that.

MORIARTY: You evidently do not know me.
We were the two puzzle pieces, fitting together. The rest would solve itself, somehow. I had to believe in our love, in us, in Sherlock Holmes.
“Surely you jest!”
“Sorry?”
The week after “The Fall” from John Watson’s perspective. After self-pity and self-destruction, he pitches a new idea game to his boss. He calls it: “If Baker Street Could Talk“.
The morning is well spent irritating his publisher. Yes, out of the blue, Dr John H. Watson wants to continue the stories for The Strand Magazine. He sketches the outline: it’s the miraculous return of the hero. Oh, yes, Sherlock Holmes survived the fall; and yes, the wife is out of the picture as well. The two men are reunited on Baker Street. Together, they solve crimes and save the world.
“They say that you only got four-pound and ten shillings from him.”
It was Mary-Ann who poured the drugs into the herbal tea. She opened the window while her lover waited downstairs. Then she lit a hellfire to burn the little girl's diary where she told how she didn't like the maid and how much the maid hated her. Then everything is linked. My arrival was scheduled, and the letters were mailed to the newspapers. The scandal because of Mrs Nordon erupted, causing the colonel's suicide. Especially after the help of Michael, who wrote to his uncle the story of the death of the kid, just to break his heart. The letter that Mary-Ann carefully had destroyed.
Make no mistake: the townspeople inquired about his father's health. They brought flowers, cake and soup. They offered to pray. And they meant it well because they are not a bad lot, they are simply terribly human. They mirrored her own helplessness. They feared that this disease is contagious. Oh, how James Moriarty turned from an eager suitor to dropping her like a hot potato. It hurt immensely. “Surely, you understand, my dear Molly, but my precious mind…”
For a second, I feared it was a stab towards Alice. The second wife in my life, or fiancée, as I did not do the same mistake twice. I left for America with her but came home to England for Holmes. Something I should have done decades prior. I have been a fool, a terrible fool. Now, I was an old fool as well. I hoped I was not too late - however, I hoped that Holmes' invitation to accompany him to the case was a good sign.
Dr Watson, this isn’t helping.
"My brother might be the British government, and I'm almost certain that he is in charge of the Royal Family’s social media accounts, but even Mycroft Holmes isn't immortal, John. He has his limits and living for 150 years is

It was one o’clock.

So much about needing the women’s advice in the first place, John

An inspector, his name was Gregson, suggested you. And here I am. Please, Mr Holmes, help me. If not for me, then for my girl."
loves to ruffle Sister Mary's feathers when she calls out the hypocrisy of virginity. Mrs Hudson is not one for mincing words. Once she came upon Sister Mary and told her, without batting an eyelash, “I’m looking forward to marrying a sixth time when I meet him. I don’t want to abstain from sex forever.”
“You played for me.”
“Why, then? I trust Mr Sherlock Holmes.” She sounded so sure, and I desperately wanted to express the same sentiment.
“Yes”, Holmes replied, “we will, won’t we. Therefore, something rather wonderful will come out of it all.“
Thank God that he had stopped smoking in his late twenties. Oh, Sherlock remembers with much chagrin his reply to Mycroft as a teenager. “Who cares that I smoke? I’m not a singer, Mycroft. I’m a pianist. My fingers are doing just fine.”
In our younger days, I could not imagine the other man to use such almost sentimental sentences. Oh, I was no fool; I had learned that behind the mask of a man resembling an automat when presented with a puzzle to solve existed a human heart. A heart that belonged to me, and if his memory did not fail him, for decades now. Watson did not know the exact date, but...
“And I know him?” Holmes looked at me expectantly. Maybe I would receive a little something, regardless. “I assume you didn’t want to imply that I have something to do with it?” He nodded, suggesting that I should continue. “However, if the treasure were still missing, I would have heard about it. After all, I have been to the church and even asked the vicar. Fair point. I only asked after the grave of my grandfather, but surely, he would have mentioned it? So...”
John Watson is drenched in sweat, his back slick with it, his hair is a mess. He is trembling all over. “You do not know how handsome you are, John. All desperate. All mine. Do you want to be buggered, John Watson?”
The sun had just risen when John Watson woke up. The room was bathed in twilight, shadows making the few items look like monsters hidden in the dark. But he wasn’t afraid anymore. The past was buried, and with Sherlock Holmes at his side again, how could he be afraid of ghosts?
“We don’t know a thing about each other. I don’t even know how we met; I don’t even know how you know my name.”
John did not know and did not care, and that was Sherlock’s downfall and salvation.
He was wearing the same clothes as the night before.
“And they say she's pregnant!”
He is both wise and suspicious of everything. Mycroft Holmes chooses his words carefully, always. His vast knowledge and wisdom have made him famous.
It helped that the wealthiest merchant in town calls Miss Hooper his wife. However, that is the way of life! The carpenter paid his price: the judge voted in the barber’s favour.
Oh, the great Mycroft Holmes admits having made an error?
WATSON: I love you too, Sherlock.
“Please, trust me.” He spoke quietly and determined. “Watson, go to the hole and climb into it. There you should find something familiar to you. Show no emotions and pick it up secretly.”
“Watson, does the name
“I just had to be persuasive. He lives with a new wife.”
Wilkes, who is pale and drunk and nearly falling off his stool, interrupts Anderson without even an apology. With a booming voice, he blurts out, “Damn! What great jewellery! Bless Holmes’ britches and his balls!”
"Either way you're going to lose your case and you'll end up with nothing.
It took me some time to reach the flat of Mrs Norton, the fog making it difficult, only to realize that Holmes had tricked me: the police were already there, making sure that Mrs Norton was not leaving. Of course, Holmes had known this. It had been all a trick to get me away from Baker Street, so no harm would come to me. I rushed home at once.
I am bewitched, body and soul, and I love, love, love him.
“By Jove! And the governess?”
“Orange blossoms. Why?
Michael Landsbury's eyes widened in amazement. He was choking with so much rage that he could not respond for a few moments. The maids were as confused as he was. Even Mrs Nordon had turned pale, not knowing how to react.
Blast this twilight! I wished I could see my lover now. I was convinced that there had to be a lovely blush on his cheek. He was a magnificent specimen of a man, all mine. And I intend to remind him of this soon when the case was finally closed. He could read my mind in my eyes, or maybe he had plans of his own he would share with me in private, as he cleared his throat loudly before he continued.
It took less than half an hour to complete the tree. They both took a step back to admire the effect, and they both felt very satisfied so. They turned towards each other by chance, and Holmes's eyes widened, then burst out laughing. Watson was full of pine needles and coloured threads, which were attached to him by the sticky resin of the tree.

"Nice try, Mr Holmes, but you won't hear anything from me."
I had not seen him for a couple of months and he seemed to pay us a surprised visit.
Sherlock’s future path has demons, and he has created each one of them.
Then we set off on our journey to hell.
Constantly, his body had betrayed him. He vividly remembered raising his voice against his sister, ashamed of how he had driven away everyone who wanted to help. He had insisted, repeatedly, there was nothing wrong with him.
“Come to bed, John.”
“I understand,” I said, “your astonishment. Especially since this postscript was added to Colonel Landsbury's will by me. It was a setup, you see. And you fell into the trap.

Captain John Watson, in full military uniform, was standing on a battlefield. He flinched as a shell exploded close behind him. A second or a lifetime later, he was sitting next to a fallen brother-in-arms. He had tried to help him; God knew how he had tried.
Adèle Landsbury was hypnotized with fear, unable to move. I turned to her and shouted: “RUN!
“Sorry?”
There was a scuffle at the basement door.
I had wanted to take a chance. Sharing a bed with Sherlock Holmes… what might happen?
Actually, John decided he would buy Mike a coffee next time in thanks.
"But he did, Mr Landsbury," Holmes uttered calmly. “I have a piece of paper here from the colonel to prove it.

Watson’s presence should distract him, but the opposite effect is true: It keeps Holmes focused.

The horrible thought occurred to me that someone might already be in.
I had been dropping hints lately about taking early retirement. We had been partners for nearly twenty years. Holmes had always insisted that he would never leave London; the countryside held no interest for him, and I could never bear to abandon him. Now, for the first time, alone in the darkened town of Sherrington, I gave retirement serious consideration.
Before John had given his directions, the cab driver grunted, and pulled away from the curb, into the traffic.
It is a good place for the poor, as their starvation is put to rest. The food might be dry, sometimes close to coal, but it is kindness that helps them survive, as the soul hungers for it.
“Good Heavens, Holmes! What are you doing, old boy?”

And I decided not to continue the conversation. I didn't want to and had nothing to add.
According to Holmes, the solution was "elementary": our client was the ship‘s owner. He had reported it missing at sea, while it had been in Plymouth Harbour since — "exactly" — 12th of December. Under its new name —
I went to the door and admitted him.

Yes, sir, thank you, sir. Dr Watson, sir!
It got worse when Landsbury coaxed out my opinion in this debate.
“And you... You are linked to…” It still hurt so much to say his name aloud. “Sherlock. How?”
“It costed that unfortunate Cavendish his life. Yes, Watson, this case is not one of my greatest successes. I prefer that the case not be published during the lifetime of Mrs Nordon or Miss Landsbury. It has already hurt them so much.
Sherlock was not. "Oh, Lestrade, it was wise to consult with me first. You would have embarrassed yourself if you'd asked someone else. This one is child's play: every letter stands for a day of the week. F means Friday, and what’s today?"
And John chose Bea.
John had read aloud, but it had not taken long until the men took turns. Rosie
How Mr Norton had escaped? It was the ribbon...
“And what happened before breakfast the next morning?” Our visitor looked at my companion, stunned. Holmes smirked, clearly enjoying that he could surprise him. “Mr Jones, the stage was set. Everything pointed at it that something would happen before the family gathered together again.”
For a minute, there was nothing. Then I hurried to declare myself; hoping it was not too late.
"No, Mr Holmes! Certainly not."
A deep silence stagnated in our living room, a palpable tension. Without a doubt, it was the last fragment of our morning argument. I wanted to restart the discussion, dying to make a last plea to Holmes and willing to take all the risks that this manoeuvre entailed, and yet I did not dare to disturb him.
He, who is bound to the work and produces chains for a living, breathes easier.
Lastly, he was a storyteller. He knew when he was in one. But surely, he had no clue how it would end. Would he wake up some time later and this all would be a strange dream? He will play his part at the side of this enigmatic man—if only for a time.
“But where I thought I would find him. At the foot of the big elm tree, she fell to the ground when the colonel's hand let go.”
The captain of the guards ought to resist, as it is his drum, but it is also his love, so he lets it happen.
“And how did you choose?” I whispered as I felt that such conversation was for us lovers alone.
"Yes. Adèle liked herbal tea before going to sleep."

Both men have their scars, but they aren't broken.
A flame had lit him from within. John Watson, a man who had stared silently into the darkness, into the reality of his bedsit and the flicker of his imagination for a month.
“That’s right,” Watson said, “Being together is everything.”
“Will the child may bear the colonel's name?”

“Certainly, I abandoned you in a situation that could not be more disagreeable.

The streets of London were rushing by.

the world; after all, tonight had been very pleasurable.
Those were John’s immediate thoughts: queer and a rather odd mix. John wished he could move in immediately, but who would have him as a flatmate? John knew he was not an easy man to live with.
Damn, Holmes, that man knew me all too well, like a puppeteer, or as a violinist manipulates his instrument to make the most marvellous tunes, to choose a metaphor more fitting for Holmes.
One last time, he would try to solve a mystery on his own. He blocked out all thoughts about
"What is it, Holmes?

I had painted a picture in my head ever since we had boarded the train to Sherrington from London.
"Could it be a countdown?" Lestrade and Sherlock turned to me. It was a bit intimidating to be scrutinised by two men who tower over me, but I was a soldier, so I battled on. "The date, you see? Monday is the first of June."
“Of course you did.” I shouldn’t smile, so I grinned. “Should I warn Mrs Hudson?”
“Worried?”
My thoughts were in uproar as much as my feelings.
I looked at him suspiciously, raising an eyebrow. Holmes was wearing shirtsleeves that were currently covered with pine needles, and I could spot some entangled in his hair as well. It should look ridiculous, but I found it strangely endearing. For a second, I try to reason with myself and wanted to argue that Holmes used to look dirty and unkempt after investigations too. Yet, I could not bear it. Not tonight, not any longer looks made him look human. It was the private side of him. One I know was a privilege to witness, and I cherished it.
Yet, when he witnessed Bea’s breakdown, echoing his grief (“Everyone leaves me”), he reaches out to put his hand on her shoulder. And Watson made his last vow: “I’m not going anywhere.”
Can you imagine that there were people who knew about them but looked the other way or even supported them in secret?
Then the snow had fallen, and Sherlock had panicked. He was no fool: he knew he could not bend the weather to his will, but he had hoped that his London would play its part. However, everything had fallen into place as if following a play that not Sherlock Holmes had written but a man similar to himself, one that shared some of his character traits and intelligence but has a bigger, better heart (or, who has a John Watson at his side as more than his constant companion...). First, the
Holmes reached out his hand to link it with mine for a flicker of a second.

"How would you describe our client's inner state the last time you saw him?
Slate-black curtains tumble over the safe house. Thunder growled among the hills. It is going to be a dark and stormy night.
Life in 221b was alarmingly domestic. He somehow sensed that if he were to discover—let us say, a foot in the larder—that he would not bat an eyelash. Sure, he would order Sherlock around to clean up his mess, but not without both of them in companionable hysterics.
As John Watson is a hero, the family name cleared from his service in his majesty’s army and tales of bravery accompanying him, the mayor hires him immediately. However, it is the other Holmes who connects that Watson is the son of the late apothecary, who years ago had fallen, heavily drunk, into a ditch, and died there. The only son had to sell the family shop to pay the bills and had fled the town intending to join the army.
“Yes, Watson. It seems like you know nothing about this.”
"Your nephew?
After several years of celebrated collaboration the eminent consulting detective, Mr Sherlock Holmes, and his medical companion, Dr John Watson, have ended their professional partnership, and it seems simultaneously ended their friendship.

Later that evening, we had retired to bed early. A knock at the door woke me up. With my revolver in my hand, I
"Only from a sadistic perspective. And why crucifixion? Is that someone's idea of true Christian values?"
John’s treacherous mind instantly flashes back to yesterday: Sherlock in his arms. He has snuggled against him during the night. They woke up together in a position that everyone else would call intimate. John prays he isn’t blushing and also that Sherlock keeps his mouth shut.
“Sherrington Hall?” I said, close to deadpan.
Oh, how much different this ending is from the real events!
"Miss Parker will inherit."
Holmes had left Baker Street without further notice, so all I could do was to wait for his return. I tried to relax by the warming fire and indulged in Mrs Hudson’s baked delicacies. The woman was a treasure! She was clearly relieved that I was still among the living, though she did not mention my recovery in so many words her baking spoke volumes.
From this point onwards, Bea races through her breakfast. She even puts too much milk into her tea to let it cool down quickly so she can gulp it down. No time for extra sugar as a treat today, too. Instead, when the clock is showing a quarter past 8, she springs from her chair, rushes over to kiss them on their cheeks and almost runs to the door.

"There is a message for you, Mr Holmes," our landlady replied blankly.
However, Holmes was faster, as he grabbed my hands and repeated urgently, “
“No, Watson. Do not insist!

The heat of the day, the peculiar case, even the confinement in 221 B. It all faded compared to the missing man at my side.
WATSON’S
Welcome to the queerest radio play of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson to-date: "The Newly Discovered Casebook of Sherlock Holmes". True to Victoriana, full of (sex) puns, and simply hilarious, it's one BBC production that far more people should know about.
"That kind of creature! You don't like Miss Parker, I see."
“And at this moment do you hear me laughing?” I take another sip, needing courage. “I don’t want to amuse you, John. I want to resurrect you. Let us both be young again.”
"But why leave a note for that?" I asked.
The next day I witnessed a shocked Mr Landsbury, confronted with a layered-up and therefore much more confident than Mrs Nordon.
He dropped the thumbs back into the crisper.
With something close to disgust, Sherlock roams over the bolthole for tonight. It is far from home and not only because of the distance. It is a shitty place, probably a former dealer's nest. Who knows? Maybe it will be one when Sherlock is gone again when he is going to flee to the next destination on his never-ending trip.
[Sound of a door being opened. The CURATOR enters.]
as the raid of the ship proved later.
“Why a London cab?”
The lawyer quietly closed the envelope after putting the will in order. He smiled as he looked at Mrs Nordon.
Her boy is so smitten! He mumbled something about “fixing his lame leg” when he first mentioned him. But she is no fool. They are going to fix each other just fine.
“John: we opened a rip twice, we fought some supernatural powers, we suffered for fifteen years and some.”
"He only wants proof of the death of his daughter?"
"I thought you were more insensitive, Mr Holmes, if Dr Watson's writings are to be believed.
Baffled, but stern he ordered: "Please, look at Miss Parker, Watson. I'll be waiting for you in the living room. Mary-Ann, show him to her bedroom."
He rumbles: “Turn over.”
In his head, he repeated the mantra of a dead man:
) I tell you it is the boldness born of ignorance. Do you think I would be here if I had not made the streets quite safe in every respect?
"And mentioned in my mail," said Holmes bitterly.
“Indeed, Watson. And equally stifling to be in.”
Although I had always tried to involve Holmes in the holidays, I had never succeeded. All the years, the uttermost we could engage him was to play some Christmas carols on his violin, but mostly he had remained almost motionless in his chair, smoking his pipe. He had only reacted when the smell of goose or Mrs Hudson’s biscuits had tinted the air. In particular, the latter was a secret weapon as my Holmes was a sweet tooth, and our landlady prepared it always for the occasion to his (not so) secret delight. The reason, he had explained to me repeatedly, that he was bored without a case to be carried out, and as the London criminals seemed to fall asleep during that time of year and his mood got darker. It had frightened me long before we had become lovers.
The driver nodded, and we could get into a pretty, well-maintained English carriage harnessed to two superb chestnut horses.
Sherlock Holmes, an acclaimed pianist, moves into 221b Baker Street on a Friday.
“Fear, you, Holmes? I cannot believe it. And what outcome?”
"And she is killing her child," I replied.
My Watson has me; I will have no one.
In secret, I hoped he would let slip that he preferred my company. Partly, he did as he shuddered and replied, "An hour in Mycroft's company is a trial. A whole day would be close to torture. And I cannot join in the general fondness for dining with elderly relatives, pulling snap-crackers and wearing comical paper headgear."
"Thank you, Dr Watson."
"Sherrington Hall hadn't," John Watson interjected, "I would have known it. It would be in the blueprints." He waved them around.
"Do you think Miss Parker is pregnant from Landsbury? Are you not going too fast?"
45 minutes after the alarm bell, Sherlock is back to his former self: The Pianist.
The conversation turned to little Adèle. To my great relief, Landsbury’s anger subsided. Perhaps, I mused to myself, was the mysterious fire lit in Adèle’s fireplace during the night of her disappearance an important lead...
John was furious. First, because it was almost an echo of Sherlock’s first sentence during their first cab ride, and he wouldn’t put it past that bastard that he did it on purpose. Second, because the older Holmes had always claimed that he would worry about him, Sherlock, which had to be another lie. Because, and that was the third and final reason, he had used his own brother as a pawn in a game with Moriarty. Yet, John pushed back his emotions, but barely.
Accompanied by her partner, Bo
“Yes, yes, Watson. What’s the matter with you?”
“Well... Holmes is an
He isn’t a good man either, so he can react accordingly: “Thank you, madam. The cake looks delicious, but you shouldn’t have. However, Beatrice will be delighted. She loves sweets.”
"Would you be so kind as to explain to me what's going on?"

Hopelessly intrigued, I gave no thought to the discomfort to be shut indoors in this heat, to the boredom, or to the fact that I had appointments on my own.

went unsaid, but not unheard.
"People die every day, Lestrade." Acting nonchalant, Sherlock has straightened up his posture on the sofa, regardless.
But when Sherlock implied he could put in a good word and get him better conditions, Dr Neil gave my partner a tip.
Here, the blacksmith had explained his instruments and the enigmatic stranger was allowed to touch it all. Afterwards, Holmes had shown off his best pieces, relishing in Watson’s praise. While he had an urge to tidy up a bit of the mess he’d made, he also wanted to listen to John Watson’s “That’s clever!” forever. As an ex-soldier, Watson knows about weaponry, and he has broad shoulders and a fascinating scar.
Holmes turned his head and motioned for me to approach. I greeted the poor lady. She looked more tired than ever but she still had those beautiful blue eyes.
“My business partner and I run a small detective agency. Our office is here in Baker Street, 221b. However… we are reputable men, and we do not have access to the more disreputable parts of London.”
"Yes, sir. "
During what I later published as

Then he forgot her name. Then he forgot his own name. Her mother's name was forgotten already.

“Not just, madam,” Holmes smiled. “He is not completely innocent either.”
. How can you expect our messenger not to trust such an authority? As for the rest of me, the wearer remembers only one thing, I wore a big black beard and glasses.
“Hello, Molly, are you well?”
“No, the carriage, as well as himself, of course, we're never seen again.”
Sherlock’s outfit is completed by his fake glasses.
He stood up from the table and went across to the hearth. After retrieving his pipe and tobacco patch, he filled his pipe and lit it. Then he sank into his beloved armchair.
It is what it is: the great Sherlock Holmes is an old man who once or twice could not even recall his iconic line of ‘observe and deduce’.
I included
Holmes remained silent, more sullen than ever.
“Yes, John. That was my purpose.”
It must be close to midnight when Holmes broke the silence. Since saving Anna and her unborn child, and convincing Lestrade that Hans would make a perfect witness to Marley's wrongdoing and in return the soon-little family should be offered protection, he had been unusually quiet.
The final line echoes loud. Mrs Hudson has stopped her hoovering as well as her sing-along. Leaving on the mic had been a bad idea.
Immediately Holmes started inspecting the room, first the corners, then the walls, muttering quietly to himself. To be frank, I was not sure that he was not secretly enjoying this. While I was visualizing myself and Holmes being starved to death, my companion brought me back to the present.
I knew he wanted to add an “obvious” or “elementary”. Yet, he observed our ex-client and has learned to not agitate criminals. It was a tough lesson, and as I knew it didn’t come easy for him — he, who wanted to prove that he’s the smartest in the room and could beat every baddie at their own game — was proud. Sherlock Holmes was capable of change, and I was once more grateful to witness it.
“This too, is your fault, Watson. It was you who infected me with the Christmas affair and the decorations. After all, in the past years, you and Mrs Hudson have always wanted to decorate Baker Street despite my grievances.”
I stomped off.

Lastly: WELCOME BACK and THANK YOU for your patience, understanding & encouraging words. It means A LOT (also 2020 is A LOT).
The next day, Holmes was absent. Instead, Michael Landsbury wanted to meet Mrs Nordon.
John was certain of that—partly from his memories, partly from some other sense. He was not hearing voices—not really, at least, when one did not count James and all the other boys he had tried to save but could not—but something told him that London was the key.

"John, John Watson. How did you know all that?" The stranger tries not to stammer but fails. He looks at him expectantly, which is unexpected. Everyone else on the market rushes by, ignoring him and vice versa.
“We will see. You can count on me.
The door to the basement was shut and when I tried the handle, I found it to be locked. From within I could hear the occasional crack of that seemed to be a gun being fired and the grind on metal on metal.
“I am here,” he said.
For hours, while the sunlight was dancing on the carpets and wooden floors, they had shared 221b’s drawing-room.
"So you trust Miss Parker?" Holmes inquired, indifferent to the feelings of the people in the room.
I remember our first night in Sherrington Hall. The first night as official owners of the property, I mean. I never found out how Mycroft or Sherlock Holmes or both had managed that I inherited the house in the end, as my grandfather had intended in 1870.
“I don’t remember any of it.”
"The victim didn’t die from the crucifixion. There has to be some poison involved."
“Excluding last night, you mean.”
The gunshot fired.
Today, 10 years ago “A Study in Pink” aired on the BBC. A show that has its flaws and a fandom that has its drama as well, and yet, I think we all agree that the show and our fandom are both pretty damn special.
“You don't have to. Watson forces the line. "
“It's not the age that matters. He must have a well-stocked purse!”
“That was certainly a rather intriguing conversation with Dr Neil. Don’t wait for me, John, I have to do some research.”
There were the already mentioned bumpy cars, a roller coaster, carousel, pony riding, and countless other amusements.

Once more I was confronted with Holmes' lack of human feelings. Alas, I could be stubborn too. After all, I was the one the public perceived as the more human. Last, I knew him well enough to push the right buttons.

His first line, “I’m a doctor” was followed by her outburst, “If you come any nearer, you’ll need a doctor.” It had been her dynamic ever since.
For a long second, I feared the worst: to spend the upcoming holidays with Holmes suffering from ennui and boredom. I would and could not desert him - I had promised as much to him and myself after the fateful events at the Reichenbach and his long absence in my life - but I will not lie to myself: I had looked forward to a peaceful celebration in our rooms. Reunited, at last. Enjoying good food and company, listening to his violin, and maybe finding a quiet moment to address the feelings I harbour since I first saw his face.

"You see me delighted."
The fall was thrown at him. The reunion should be on his terms.
John smiled in disbelief. He turned back to the younger man.
He should be alarmed, but he isn't. After living so long in quick-sand memories, he's used to being forever in limbo. If there had been a disruption, and something as soothing as

until both could trust Mycroft again. For months Sherlock Holmes had taken the Watson family for his own. John and Rosie were his families and 221b Baker Street, their home once more. Then it all changed once more. A new adventure, one might say, and the three of them had ended up here last month for good. Here, in Dorset on the English coast, where apparently John Watson had been before.
“Ten days, Mr Holmes. It took ten days, during which Dr Watson’s grandfather had already been passed away from natural causes. His condition had been critical prior and the disappearance of his grandson had been too much for him, or so I was told. It was quite some eventful days, as you can easily imagine, and in particular, when it happened in such a small town as Sherrington. Then a letter arrived that assured that John Watson was alive but severely injured after a fall. You remember Sherrington is close to the sea, and the weather turns fast, so an accident was accepted as gospel. Especially, when taking into consideration that you had only spent a few summer vacations at the estate in your youth. Apparently, you were an adventurous young man, talking about joining the army in a year. Therefore, it seemed plausible. The letter ended it wasn't expected that you would recover fully and probably would die young.”

Inspector Stanley may not have been a nice or pleasant person, but he was efficient. In no time, the area was searched with care and diligence, including the tomb. Besides the blanket, various objects were discovered, including a plate, a bowl filled with water, a bucket and a red coat with pom-poms. The coat caused a great sensation among the servants: the coat belonged to Adèle Landsbury. However, there was still no trace of the young girl. Was she even still alive?

“No. I was here last night too, tossing and turning in my bed at the thought of my ruined reputation,” I replied.
“No charade, Watson. If you could only see what excellent work, you have done. One can rely on you, in every instance.”
I cradled Holmes’ head and stroked his hair. His locks were like silk, so sensual. His hands were skittish still, unusual of what they were allowed in daylight, as it must be around seven by now. He patted my back. It was rather endearing. After assembling some courage, he touched my neck and my shoulders, growing bolder with every passing minute, and soon there were some hesitant kisses.
cracking the case, he kept his mouth shut. His daughter and husband should enjoy the tale, or at least to an extent.
As if it was yesterday or tomorrow, I played along, "for you, Holmes. However, a normal fellow like myself needs some explanation."
I did not care what they did with him. All my focus was on the well-being of Holmes.
Let me ask you a question: Who is worse off?
I was glad to be inside a building again as a storm was approaching. Dark clouds coming nearer, it seemed as if it would rain soon. The temperature had dropped over the run of the day; I wished to be back in the inn already. Entering the storage room, probably for garden

They came from different universes, but they were star-crossed. They were together: Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. And for both their sakes, John Watson was ready to fight for it.

It is sudden wetness that brings me back to the present: my Watson is silently crying. Hesitantly, I brush over his back. It is a foreign feeling to offer him comfort, and to know that I have a remedy for it all; alas, all I have to give is my love.
