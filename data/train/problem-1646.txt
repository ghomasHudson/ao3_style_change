“No running after them alone,” Sherlock groaned. There were tears in his eyes, and the jeans he still wore constricted his cock painfully.
New Year's Eve, '73/'74. John teaches Sherlock a little respect for tradition. By positive reinforcement.
It wasn't just that Sherlock had come home stinking of skunk spray like a bad dog, trying to walk right into the house as if bringing home an acrid, eye-watering reek was just a normal Sherlock day. (Some things he liked to play with smelled almost as bad and were actually dangerous.) It wasn't just that he didn't even care to change his clothes.
Holmes leaned forward in the chair, picking at the dregs of the eggs. "He sure seems to, doesn't he? I feel bad for that boy, to be honest. You make a couple mistakes in life, and your old man always thinks the worst from then on. I'm keeping an open mind. I don't think our client here is an unbiased source."
"You really are a fucking know-it-all," John said fondly, giving Sherlock's ass a light slap. He picked up the picnic basket and cooler, and didn't even mind having to carry everything, because Sherlock kept his hand in John's rear pocket the whole way back down to the house, except when he slipped around a little for a bit of a discreet fondle - which made John feel just fine about being temporarily a little itchy and doing a fair amount of squelching.
John looked out at the moon over the Greenbrier. "Look at this...spread. Ten miles away, people without indoor toilets. Grandson of a coal miner, supposed to only come in by the back door. I think Mycroft doesn't think I'm good enough for you."
Moonlight flooded the room, washed in on a breeze starting to carry the scents of the first spring flowers. One low lamp glowed in a corner, not to overwhelm the silvery light.
Sherlock groaned and molded himself against John's back, driving his cock in deep and moving his hips in lascivious circles as he pinned John's wrists to the bed. “So tight. So hot,” he purred. “I'm not cold anymore, are you?”
"Yes. A priceless jeweled headpiece, obviously worn by someone very important long ago. It happens to contain a large number of good-sized and valuable stones, and if even one went missing it would be a disaster. The integrity of the piece as a complete art object is vitally important to its value. I can't abide even the hint of scandal. I've held my position honorably, I've never even had the whiff of anything unethical about me. I can't stand it.
The spot they had chosen was secluded, surrounded by tall pines and shielded from the sun. The ground was naturally weedless and coated in an almost plushy bed of old pine needles, and the scent was rich and fresh. The mountain started to rise more sharply at this point, but they'd found a natural flat area.
past the point where these people have no public sympathy. If you let yourself be seen abusing queers, then you yourself will look weak. Don't let that happen. Keep your men on a tight leash OR ELSE.”
Then the phone rang - ridiculously, comically loud. Greg didn't stop, but the mood was rather damaged. It rang six times, then stopped, then started again. "I'm not gettin' that," he muttered up at Molly, staring at her face and the undersides of her breasts in the moonlight. Christ, he was a lucky man. Though he'd be luckier if the damn phone stopped ringing.
Jon got up and paced around a little. "Irene seemed to think you played violin. That pretty bartender Nellie told me she said that. She deduced that from your hands or something. That true?"
Sherlock scoffed. "Of course not. It was a perfectly respectable abandoned loading dock in the Meatpacking District."
Sherlock’s hands gripped the bedpost, white knuckled and straining. He was shirtless and his skin reflected the light as his back arched, and he jerked with each blow.
“It’s too cold for this, John,” Sherlock said, shivering and naked with the quilt around his shoulders.
He was really pissed at himself, because he ought to be more used to losing patients by now, but damn, that poor boy could have been Omare, just a few years older. And he'd had to hear a mother's screams. You don't get a sound like that out of your head. If you want to stay human, you shouldn't.
Sherlock shuddered softly and leaned his back up against the tree that was just behind him. From his motions, he was remembering the feeling of John's massage. When he leaned back he took his cock in his hand and closed his eyes.
“Mmm,” said Sherlock, slightly preening. “Anyway, the business partner was grateful that her arrest put an end to the embezzling too, so I took care of Mrs. Hudson’s Mother’s Day present a little bit early.”
"Decoration Day" is the original name of Memorial Day. Many Southerners still call it that, and observe it in the
Lestrade made a sort of understanding grunt. Then he shook his head. “God, I can't even imagine what that's like.”
The moon shone huge and misty through the bare black trees, and then came uncanny yipping cries. Not hunting hounds. Not yet. Just the eerie conversations of the Eastern coyote. Sherlock scrambled down the steep slope under cover of their noise, cursing the creak of his knees in the cold. Was he just out of condition, or really getting too old for this? Stop. Focus. Assess surroundings.
To be ready to go is a blessing - to learn how is hardest for the ones left behind. Music helps. 221B format.
"Yes," Sherlock said, completely deadpan but clearly on the verge of losing it. "You're trying to look scandalized because you think you should be, but our little adventure in Roanoke told me you're neither afraid of kinky stuff nor completely married to sexual exclusiveness. It's something you think you're supposed to want, more than you actually do."
him, seeking everywhere Sherlock's pulse could be found surging hard: his neck, his chest, that glorious, growing handful between his legs.
Sherlock gave his left cheek a little slap. “I’ve got so much to give you. Been saving it up. How about you go lean up against the wall there?"
“Put more wood on the fire then,” John shouted down the stairs. “And don’t close that door. We’ve gotta let all the bad luck out!”
"I can't finish if you start giving me a boner," John said. He wasn't there yet but it was clearly oncoming.
"Of course," Sherlock said, closing up his own stained jeans and, as usual, standing around watching and preening while John did the work of packing up their picnic leftovers. "Not taking those to Mrs Hudson's yet, I assume," Sherlock said, gesturing at John's jeans.
"Yes, of course," Holmes said, sitting back in his chair and steepling his fingers in a particularly relaxed, arrogant way. "Child pornography and state secrets, I hear."
"I did clock you for a Friend of Dorothy, though," she said quietly. She said no more, just watched his face journey. It was long, and complex, and beautiful - and exactly what he deserved for interrupting her
Mrs Hudson sighed. She loved Alice because Alice was a survivor, and very underrated. Oh, she hated the crack and the smack and what they did to her people, but she'd never believe there was anything wrong with a little ganja, so she indulged. She got absorbed in the opening track - the swaggering opening riff, the whole long 15 minutes with that sexy sax, Pharoah Sanders on the right channel and Joe Henderson on the left. A good music journey, and she felt safe enough to lean into it in her own store.
John woke to a tight, strong arm around his waist from behind. A nightmare newer than Nam, and somehow Sherlock
Sherlock gave a little groan and John could feel him leaning into the touch, rolling his head slowly as John dug in with his thumbs over Sherlock's scapula, feeling the tension give way. Sherlock's shoulders stretched, curled backwards up and straight, then settled down again. John could almost feel him melting into his hands, and that was a good feeling. "Yeah, that's good, isn't it?" he murmured. "You're all wound up. Just relax, just let it be, you're fine. Drink more though. It's kind of hot out. Don't want to get dehydrated."
Holmes was in the kitchen of all places, trying to do his best to cook a breakfast. His best wasn't very good, but Jon appreciated the effort.
Remarkable. The third album after Trane had passed, and Alice was coming into her own as a bandleader. Already a master pianist and harpist, and still in the shadow of her husband. He was so young when he died. Only 40. Imagine being married to a genius like that, and to lose him so soon.
“Kill him,” she repeats, still smiling, “or I will.” Sherlock opens his mouth to protest loudly, but a loud voice makes him quiet.
John’s eyes brighten with tears. “We were idiots, weren’t we? All this time, we could've had it all.”
Then she introduces herself as Aeolus. “Aeolus,” Sherlock mumbles. “Aeolus, the Keeper of the Winds?”
“I don’t know how to dance.” The declaration comes abruptly, about a month before the wedding. 221b Bakerstreet looks the same as always, the two of them slouched in their respective chairs.
And Sherlock has another epiphany, right there on the creaking floorboards of a killer’s attic. He’s never understood love. Until now.
Sherlock is left cross-legged in his chair, definitely not pouting a bit. “A shame,” he tells Mrs. Hudson, seated at the kitchen table. “You seem to have driven him off.”
“It’s going to be okay,” Sherlock echoes, pressing a delicate kiss to John Watson’s cheek. John trembles, and doesn’t resent this death for a moment.
“Yes,” she says, “including Eurus.” They both stiffen. It’s been barely half a year since Sherrinford.
“I’ll give you a bit of incentive, then.” She pulls out a gun and levels it with John’s forehead. “Deduce.” John does his best not to flinch.
After a few minutes their kidnapper grows bored and stops. Sherlock thanks a god he doesn’t believe in, until she turns to him. “Why don’t you give it a try? Deduce. It’s the only thing you’re good for, isn’t it?”
They waltz around the living room for a bit longer, until Sherlock tries to twirl him on a whim, and the back of his knee crashes into his chair. He wobbles dangerously, then gravity makes him sit, hard. Sherlock laughs. John joins, and they both just sit there, Sherlock collapsed on the floor, giggling like schoolchildren.
John swallows. “Because if I tell I’ll be alone again, and I-“ He closes his eyes. “I‘d rather die than bear that.”
He understands. Suddenly, he understands. He knows the truth, so beautiful and devastating that he must’ve been blind to miss it before.
Only then does he allow himself one longing glance at John’s chair. Closing his eyes, he says in an undertone, “I know, Mrs. Hudson.” Unconsciously, his hand rubs his forehead, John’s touch still lingering.
So Aeolus continues to cut designs on his skin, Sherlock helpless but to watch, until Sherlock is practically begging John to just tell him. He watches the light glint off the metal knife, can’t look away, and tells John, “Please.”
Aeolus presses the gun into Sherlock’s hands. He clutches the loaded weapon to his chest while she watches. “Kill him or I’ll kill you both.”
John runs his hand over his face. “I bet Mary knows how to dance. She knows how to do most everything. What am I going to
“Sherlock,” John pleads, and his voice breaks in the middle. It’s a tone he’s heard a thousand times before, but never understood. But something is writhing in the back of his mind, seeking release and it’s so close-
That draws a laugh out of him. “Of course.” He places his hand in Sherlock’s, trying not to think about the warmth. Sherlock uses lotion, the bottles always had been scattered in the downstairs bathroom, but it hadn’t registered until now. Because Sherlock’s hands are soft.
Sherlock sobers immediately. “What do you want.” His voice is dangerously low. But she doesn’t ask for anything, doesn’t demand anything, just carves a bleeding heart over John’s chest until Sherlock shouts at her to “Stop!
“Can’t you see, even now? My girlfriends were all denial. Remember Jeannette? She was tall and dark and had the same stupid blue coat and- and she reminded me of you.” John doesn’t meet his eyes.
Curse his brilliance. “I’ll teach you,” he repeats slowly. “That way you won’t have to worry about conflicting interest.” Because who would ever guess that Sherlock Holmes was interested in John Watson? An engaged man, no less. Only a bloody idiot.
John sees something in Sherlock’s eyes that looks like regret before they separate once more. “Now you try,” Sherlock adds brusquely.
He wets his lips. “Course,” John mutters. “Course.” Taking a deep breath, he leads Sherlock in dance. The music swells, and he thinks his heart is going to beat out of his chest.
“Make it quick,” he says. Sherlock sobs. “And look me in the eye.” The worst part is, Sherlock knows why. He’d been shot, in Afghanistan, by a stranger. Uncaring metal and hot sand, it could’ve been anyone. It could’ve been a stray. John wants to be killed by someone he knows, someone he loves (even if he knows they don’t love him back).
One-two-three, one-two-three. Sherlock hits the beats perfectly, dragging John along with him. Then, taking pity, they practice the step slowly. He must get bored, though, because after a minute of the slow tempo he speaks up.
? Staring hard at the skull, he doesn't respond. Eventually, she gives up and exits, leaving him alone with his thoughts.
“Perfect.” Aeolus claps her hands like this is entertainment. “Now that we’ve got emotional context, it’s time to destroy you. Sherlock Holmes.” She picks up the gun again, aims it at John. “Because Eurus was right about one thing, wasn’t she? Emotional context. It destroys you. Every. Time.”
Aeolus has been quiet, watching the drama unfold, but now she hurries them. “Go on. The finale. Shoot John Watson.”
Sherlock clears his throat. They’d stilled without noticing, and he starts stepping again. “Anyways, it’s most logical to practice in the last position, as you and Mary will be newlyweds.”
When John and Sherlock awaken to the sensation of coarse fabric against their wrists and stiffness in their limbs, neither are quite alarmed. Villains aren’t getting any more creative, and this is the fifth kidnapping in as many months.
He may be bored, but he’s not reckless, like Sherlock. “We’re at her mercy,” he hisses, “don’t be stupid.” Sherlock looks affronted.
He stumbles upon a locked door in his palace. This shouldn’t be possible. But he’s desperate, so he throws himself at it, rams it with his body, until it splinters open with a scream and all its contents roar out.
“When have we ever been afraid of change, John?” he says softly, but John only shakes his head in silence.
“I want to break you. I want you not only dead, but flayed open and hurting for the world to see,” she spits. “I will find what makes you hurt, and I will dig my knife in and
It’s the end of the world, it’s the end of their world, and Sherlock stands there with a gun to John Watson’s head, and confesses, “I love you too.”
John looks at his hand, then to his face, then at his hand again. He seems amazed, nerves showing. “Now?”
John only stays another half hour of embarrassed small talk, before bidding his leave quite hastily.
Love is promising them it’s going to be ok at the end of the world, even as his finger puts more pressure on the trigger. Love is putting up with him when he’s bored, when he’s rude, when he’s a maniac, and running around London without complaint. Love is right here, right now, as John stares into his eyes so deeply he’s afraid he’s seen his soul. Love is unconditional. Love is selfless. Love is John Watson, and Sherlock wonders how he’d never seen it before.
“You'd probably know the most painless way to kill a man,” John says, and he grins with a smile that’s unsteady around the edges. “One last thing, Sherlock. For me. Just for me.”
“Brilliant,” says John, and for once he sounds bitter. And the utter lack of denial is all the confirmation Sherlock needs. He reels, blinking rapidly. Because he’d guessed, that was mostly what he did, made educated guesses, but some part of him never believed it.
Love is fear. Constant, pervading fear of putting your loved ones in harm’s way. It’s terror at the very thought of losing them.
Their kidnapper keels over with a hole through her forehead. Sherlock shoots her again with her bullet for good measure (just to be sure) before roughly untieing John, every touch a reassurance of his wellbeing.
Sherlock raises the gun with a trembling hand, tremors running through his body. He levels it at the forehead of the only person he’s ever loved. The muzzle caresses John's skin like a lover, and somehow, the moment is more intimate than any they’ve ever shared.
Their kidnapper laughs, elated. “You got it! I didn’t actually think you’d get past your own ego, but it’s always him, isn’t it?”
“I meant it, you know.” Mrs. Hudson turns to look at him, features understanding. “It really is not the best time.”
Sherlock meets John’s eyes and knows that nothing will ever be the same. With his gun hand aching, he lifts his other and brushes John’s hair back tenderly.
John looks as if he’s been struck. “Tell him,” she croons, “go ahead.” Sherlock looks at his partner with bewilderment, as John presses his lips together until they turn white and refuses to say a word.
“For once,” she responds. Then she laughs again. Sherlock doesn’t know why she keeps doing that. Nothing about this is funny.
“John? Sherlock?” Walking in completely, Mrs. Hudson is greeted to the full sight of them still in a very compromising position. Her eyebrows rise to her hairline, but she’s still smiling in an “I knew it” way that Sherlock doesn’t like one bit.
“Oh Sherlock, I’ve seen the way you look at him. The whole of Scotland Yard, too,” she says pityingly. Setting down her teacup with a clatter, she sighs. “I know you love him, Sherlock, but he’s
John snakes an arm around Sherlock’s back and lowers him. He leans in, enough to see Sherlock’s eyes widen, before diverting and kissing him delicately on the forehead. He laughs at Sherlock’s frozen expression. “You should’ve seen your face,” John murmurs, grinning. Sweet revenge.
“Well... Kind of. I just have to distract myself“, he replied as he remembered that he had promised John to be honest with him from now on.
“You know me so well, honey”, Moriarty smiled, still holding the knife against John's throat, but they had made some steps towards me, “Continue, if it pleases you.”
Sherlock looked away and stumbled into the room in a clumsy way, trying to act normal, but amazingly failed. “I'm sorry...“, he managed to stay and held on to a chair.
Sherlock stroke over John's arm carefully, then he nodded, "Alright. No hospital, I think that's for the best. You can't get up, but do you think I can lift you?" He had talked kind of fast as John's words had fastened his pulse and had the blood go into his head. He was all that he wanted now. To just lay there with him. It was... a good feeling to be needed, to be loved.
Sherlock couldn't help himself and smiled at how happy John was about this small success, and was equally happy about the fact that his health was improving. Soon John would be the same again; if there were lucky nothing from the attack would stay. As the elevator arrived Sherlock asked: "Would you like me to help or try it on your own?"
"Well I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't, would I?" John said, his question tapering off into a light chuckle.
“I'm sorry if I was... difficult again...”, Sherlock said, figuring that he himself might have been the problem – again, “I just... didn't understand.”
He looked at him when he entered the living room and a slight blush scurried over his cheeks when their eyes met. He nodded towards John as a thank you and went to the kitchen to get the tea, then he sat down.
I shook my head and went to the kitchen, well, if you could still call it kitchen. Not much had changed since I had moved out, except that Sherlock had gotten himself even more equipment for his... experiments. I was almost scared to open the fridge, anything could await me in there. I opened it but... it was empty. Of course, Sherlock had wanted to leave. Keeping anything in there would be ridiculous. Although six months were nothing... He surely could have found an experiment that could have taken that long...
John shut his eyes briefly before looking back at Sherlock with tired amusement shining in his eyes.
I almost ran into Sherlock as he had stopped in front of the apartment's entrance. I was about to say something, to tell him to hurry, as he moved on. He walked slower now, not straight up to the laptop, as I would have if I hadn't stopped to watch what he was doing, but took off his coat and his scarf.
Sherlock took a deep breath. So he would have to talk now. He actually was good at that but talking about feelings?
Sherlock smiled at the cute faces John were making, trying to move but he couldn't. So he just pulled him over and held him in his arms. Sherlock carefully stroked John's wonderful hair and holding him like this... he knew that he belonged to him. That he was his alone. "I'm yours too", Sherlock whispered and placed a soft kiss on John's head. He would fall asleep any moment, if he hadn't already. And Sherlock would soon, too, eventually.
“No...”, Sherlock replied with his mind being far, far away, “We said we would just grab something, remember? Go for a walk then.”
John wanted this too. Of course he did. They wouldn't have done all they did before if he hadn't. Still this was a huge step. An intimacy that Sherlock had never known. But he wanted it now. So he slowly pulled on John's pants, it wasn't easy as they were tight and him being aroused didn't make it easier, but he finally managed to take them off. After that he waited for further orders from his captain.
He had noticed Sherlock's little smile, and felt his cheeks redden with slight embarrassment, and happiness. Sherlock hadn't objected to him potentially leaning against him, was this progress?
"You can lay on it completely", Sherlock said; he wouldn't mind anything that John would do. He just should be alright.
Sherlock still knelled next to John when he stopped wincing. His first thought was that this was his end.. which he wouldn't accept just like that. But John was still breathing. He was breathing. Breathing meant: Alive. "John...", Sherlock said and pulled him closer to him, pulled him on his lap and held him tight. It was only when a tear fell down on John that he realized that he was crying.
The body had several scratches, it's condition showed that it had been on the ground of the river for 11 days and a half, the last sand murder had happened 3 days ago. Sherlock looked at her clothes. They had been quite expensive. Lower upperclass, he presumed. There had been jewelry on her before, her neck showed lines where her tent was brighter, as well as around her left wrist. There were no green imprints so it must have been gold or silver at least.
Then Lestrade and his colleagues arrived; they entered through the front door. Sherlock didn't pay attention to who else had joined him.
It took about 2 hours to reach John's safe place, which took the form of a small house in a country town. It was situated in a normal street, with normal people who had normal lives, something Sherlock and John didn't posses. Through the darkness of the night, bright lights shone through the clean windows of the house, which, to the relief of John, meant that someone was home. He pulled up into the driveway, and hopped out of the car quickly, Sherlock seemed to follow suite. John was on edge. He was certain that they were safe here, but paranoia still whispered to him at the back of his brain. It was like his mind was working at triple speed, ideas and thoughts branched from one another. He wondered whether this was what Sherlock's mind felt like, constantly crowded and restless. The urge to hold Sherlock was unbearable, he wanted to please him, to calm him and to soothe him. Anything to get him to feel safe from Moriarty, even if it was rough sex or foreplay. At this point, he just wanted to forget about everything. He skipped over to the side door on the house, and knocked gently. In between all of his panic and agitation, there was a slither of hesitance. He hadn't been to this house in years, the people inside had nearly faded away to ghosts in his memory, washed away by life with Sherlock. He felt the presence of the detective behind him. The man was breathing harshly, and although he was silent, John could tell that the alarm bells in his mind palace were blaring. God, how he just wanted to kiss and hold him right there on the brick wall... He turned his head around to talk to him, but as he opened his mouth, the door in front of him opened, and he whipped back around. That little slice of hesitance grew until it was all he could feel. In the door's entrance, stood a young, blonde woman. John let out a shuddered breath, and a silent exchange of words were said between them. She glanced over at Sherlock, before returning her cold eyes to the doctor.
“Evidently!”, Sherlock returned the smile of his friend. He couldn't wait to get going, couldn't wait to feed his brain, couldn't wait to make an impression. Although he was aware he had already made  one. It was quite interesting that John was susceptible to what he was doing. And for what reason ever it felt good to see this reaction on him.
Sherlock was moaning John's name as he went faster, it was... incredible! And he went faster too with his hands. He wanted more of this touches, as soon and much as possible, he wanted to be released!
He was relieved that there was an elevator, he wondered what would've happened if there weren't. Sherlock would have probably carried him, scooped up again. The thought put a faint smile on John's face, which widened as he thought of himself carrying Sherlock that way, it was a ridiculous image.
He slammed his cup down and held his ears in an attempt to mute the pain and ringing in his head. It felt like something had cut through his brain, like a bullet. In desperation, he clamped shut his eyes and hunched over himself, begging the pain to go away. He was hanging off of the chair, and he fell off, slamming his legs onto the stone floor. It was overtaken by the agony in his head. Sherlock! Where was Sherlock?! He exclaimed in pain and lowered his head to his knees. Air pumped in and out of his lungs frantically.
“I need to think”, Sherlock said, “Think about all of this. I'm sorry, John, but I need a quite place.”
Sherlock kept looking at John for a second, considering if he should listen to him, continue this together or not. This had been precisely why he had rejected John during all this time, why he couldn't tell him that he loved him. It was too dangerous. But if he did all this alone now he would lose him just like if he was being killed. How could he forgive him this kind of treason? So he nodded and opened the door of the car, walked around it and opened the door for John as well, ready to hold him in the way that was necessary.
“We will come back and set you free, Mrs. Hudson”, I heard John say behind me as I was already flying up the stairs to the apartment.
John braced himself by taking in a deep breath, and looked at Sherlock, silently begging for him to take over and explain it, the detective stared back, but made no inclination that he was going to speak. Ok then. "W-Well..." John started, averting his gaze to the floor. He wiped his hand with his mouth, what the hell should he say? Well, we're here because a manic psychopath, who I shot and killed, has decided to stalk us and whilst he's at it, kill me, because Sherlock and I are fucking each other in secret and this man, whose Irish by the way, will do anything to make Sherlock's life a living hell, so we, I specifically, decided to come here because I haven't come here in years, so he won't know where we are. Would that cover it? Her eyebrows rose with expectation. "Well...?" She asked, wanting John to continue his unfinished sentence. That woman could strike John with pure fear at times, even when she didn't mean to.
At first he feared that he'd be too heavy for John, as he was much taller than him, but he was wrong because his soldier was strong. And he did like that.
Then he left the restroom and closed the door behind him. People were already approaching him, but he stopped them by lifting his hand. “Please, stay calm everybody. My partner and I” John had followed him and opened the door just in the right moment, “are from the police. More officers will be here soon. I recommend to leave the building immediately.”
John tensed up, suddenly feeling the urge to move away from Sherlock. Their intimate embrace turned sour in that split second, this wasn't how Sherlock normally spoke to him. "At least I did something." John said coldly.
"Well, that's what we're here for!" She said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes, John could tell that she didn't just mean it in a joking way, "Will you be needing a room with single beds or, a double one?"
Sherlock didn't know how but his body longed for John and moved against him in a way. It made weird moves but he couldn't help it, so he ignored it and kept focusing on that intense kiss, on John's fingers in his hair and at his ear. How was his skin so sensitive that all of this sent waves of pleasure through him.
"Wait, drugs? Where did that come from?" John asked, frowning and wiping his face, "Why did I think that?"
An innocent... There was a part of him that was scoffing at his shock, it was saying: "But you've killed hundreds of innocents in war, why should one more matter?" And truthfully, John saw the logic in that, so he didn't know why he felt like that, why he was so affected.... Was he rusty? Had the remorse he had buried in Afghanistan crawled back out and returned to him? He had a feeling that he wasn't just mourning the one man in the restroom, but all of the people who were 6 foot under thanks to him. It came crashing onto him.
John obeyed and increased his speed, which caused the bed springs to groan and creak. Sherlock didn't care, he was on the final stretch. As he felt it reach its climax, he panted heavily, before feeling himself topple into pleasure, a strangled moan escaped his open mouth. His member erupted onto John's stomach, spreading white seed across his tan skin. His eyes widened, it was like nothing he had ever felt before! Never had he experienced such physical enjoyment, yes he had felt it mentally, but that was nothing compared to the waves crashing over him!
John panted heavily, guiltily enjoying the buzz of adrenaline going through his body. The doctor shook his head and let out a small sigh, shoving the gun back into his pocket before glancing over at Sherlock, reluctantly sending a text to Lestrade before leaning down, pressing his fingers to Moriarty's neck "dead..." He muttered quietly before glancing back at Sherlock, watching him leave the room. John knew he would need to help him out, since Sherlock wasn't all that great at controlling the crowds. John stepped out of the door and nodded at Sherlock, his face and eyes hardening as he watched the crowds, holding up his hands "Get back now. This is a matter of national security and you need to evacuate the building.... NOW" He shouted, using his discipline, military voice. John stepped forwards, intimidating the people as they surrounded the duo "I said, you need to leave." He growled in a low voice "I WILL NOT SAY IT AGAIN" He shouted which caused them to back off and begin to fill out of the building as they could hear sirens in the distance. John smirked and glanced across to Sherlock, a run of adrenaline running through him as he tapped into his military side.
John leant in for another kiss and closed his eyes upon contact. He wished that they could relive this moment again and again. It was funny how he could be close to death at one moment and the next, holding his boyfriend intimately in a hotel room. Two opposites of life, in the space of a few hours. He didn't care about what has happened or will happen, he shut his world off to just this moment, where he could enjoy Sherlock and the time they had together. He felt his heart ache to be with Sherlock's, it was the exact same feeling he had at his mother's house, but amplified. He needed to be one with Sherlock, a part of him.
“How charming,” is all she says. “But now is not the best time, is it? With you and Mary’s wedding so close,” she directs at John.
Then Sherlock pauses. “Aeolus is a male god. You’re Aeolus? You couldn’t have chosen a better name-” John elbows him, or he tries to, momentarily forgetting about the bonds.
“No,” he says, and John flinches. “He can’t be.” He stares at John. “You can’t be. You’re straight. You’ve had countless girlfriends-”
Sherlock swipes frantically through every byte of data he’s ever collected on John Watson, bashes in the walls of his mind palace just to find an answer, but ends up with...nothing. There’s not enough information. The irony.
John is sitting as far back in his chair as he can manage, eyes squeezed shut and face contorted in a grimace.
But he’s not exuding his usual confidence when he actually dips John, arms surprisingly gentle around him. He brings their faces closer until their breaths mingle. “This is where you kiss her,” he says softly, voice low.
“John,” he forces out through a dry throat. The memories, the clues, come flooding back, now that the dam has been smashed to smithereens.
It’s deafening, the loudest sound he’s ever heard, but when John Watson opens his eyes, he’s still alive.
Sherlock smiled at John's sigh, but felt a bit guilty that he hadn't taken off the pants earlier. At least John was a free man now. But those thoughts were erased when they got back at it, and John's loving kiss let him disappear into their own world again.
Sherlock's voice broke there. He had figured out what they could do to make him leave the shadows. It was hard to control himself and not have one of his outbursts here. Think. He had to think. How exactly could they do it?
John found it adorable how embarrassed and inexperienced Sherlock was with this side of him. A teenager, unsure of what or how to do this. It was like he was just discovering his own body, a mystery he had never explored before. John placed his hands on the sides of Sherlock's face and lifted it up to his eye level. He pressed his forehead against Sherlock's whilst maintaining his beautiful gaze.
"Oh yes, I remember, I remember now." John said. That felt like such a long time ago, like he was a different person.
No. He needed to stay awake. Where were they going to go? He was almost certain Sherlock didn't know how to drive, and with John being unfit to drive, how were they going to get anywhere? At least, he thought Sherlock couldn't drive... Perhaps he might be wrong.
So, what was it that Moriarty wanted to achieve? Chaos, Control, Pain. He was mad, his brain like a box of cats, so actually easy to manipulate. He had to be given the feeling that he was winning, that everything worked out the way he wanted.
“You're amazing, John“, Sherlock smiled before he got up. It was only then that he realized that his legs were trembling. Must have been from all the excitement that John had sent through his body. It weren't only his legs, his whole body was in this state.
John had dove into deep thoughts and probably he wouldn't even hear what Sherlock was saying but he had to at least try.
“It's nice weather today, isn't it?”, Sherlock said, looking up into the sky, “Perfect time to do some deductions outside.”
John looked over to him and gave him a gentle smile "Ah.. Boys right?" He asked, tilting his head to the side and studying his face for a few moments "Is that why you walk about in a sheet all the time? Trying to draw me in?" He asked, a small smirk on his lips and his cheeks turned a slow pink colour. He rested back into the chair and sighed "We are just going to a cafe, it will be nice" he said, the male clearly in a far better mood compared to before, his heart pounding as he thought over his feeling for Sherlock, licking his lips slowly before chuckling, shaking his head "Ahh... Emotions" he said simply, glancing across to him. "Ever loved someone Sherlock?" He asked
She looked over to her computer screen and began typing on the keyboard along with the occasional mouse click. By now, the radio had changed to a new song.
“Maybe someone burnt Moriarty's corpse”, Anderson suggested and Sherlock sighed in disbelief. Why couldn't people for once just think?
Then John turned around. Sherlock didn't expect for him to wake up so soon, and already thought that he had woken him up. He wanted to say something but couldn't, John's perfection paralyzed him. His eyes were the most... fascinating. They had the most extraordinary colour, yes, there were many people whose eyes were blue, but John's were... different. They were worth observing, seeing the depth in them, the soul that they were the door to.
"It was sarcasm Sherlock." John said, putting his hands on his hips. "But if you're offering, you might as well ask, she might not even talk to you, so be warned."
I looked at him in surprise. How did he... yes, it was him. Of course he knew. But... how was I to react? Simply tell him the truth? I couldn't lie to John anyway. I was aware that sooner or later he would find out, and if I had lied to him, he would be mad at me.
“I mean that you can't protect me. Don't look at me like that, it's not about you, I know you're a fantastic fighter and great soldier, I am very aware of that. But what can the strongest soldier do when he's being shot at by a superpower? We can run, but we can't hide. This is only a delay, John. It was a mistake to take you along, it was a mistake to come here. He wants me, and not am I only endangering you now, but your entire family!”
Outside of the palace, where he was rarely allowed to venture, his nobility was often such a novelty that the citizens fell over themselves to grant his every wish, even those he had yet to wish for. Inside of the palace, he was practically ignored. In all settings, adults spoke over and around him.
John watched the intricate weave go flying and admired the brilliant colors of the shells and rocks weighted at the corners. He ran to the side to see the net sink, but the body of the net was already under the languid waves by the time he leaned over the edge of the boat.
“Or stop bringing anything to market at all!” Mik huffily suggested as he began bleeding the animals. Sarah ignored Mik.
I realized that I used the "secret of your birth" trope multiple times in this story. It's weird because it isn't a trope I normally employ or particularly enjoy, but whatever lol.
Wat exploded in laughter so raucous that John, still sitting in his lap, was rocked from one side to the other with the strength of it.
John loved hearing every tale his family spun about her and missed her though he only knew her by who and what she had left behind.
His father gave him another indulgent smile and ruffled John’s blond hair so that some fell into his eyes. Wat offered to take any letter or parcel to Chala’s parents tomorrow, who lived along the Chenab, before bidding farewell to Chala and moving onward.
“I—I’ll tell you after dinner,” Wat rushed out, pushed off of the wall, and was gone inside before John could string together any more response besides his shaken expression.
“Yeah, papa?” John peered at the ropes tied to the side of the boat, blue eyes bright with curiosity.
Darting past the mage who still stood smiling down on his mischief from the edge of the hidden balcony, Sherlock dived over the edge. Falling rapidly, he spoke the flight spell, but nothing happened. His abruptly movement on the balcony had drawn the gazes of many of the courtiers. A few of the less controlled people raised their arms to point in surprise and interest.
Amused at this, John mockingly sucked his fingers in imitation. He was slightly shocked when he drew a few gazes, as well, and he ripped his fingers from his mouth immediately but could not entirely hide his blush.
John continued home. When he saw that the lantern on the door mantle was lit, he was relieved. He entered the house in search of his father and gave the box on the shelf a cursory tap as he strode past it. After a just a few seconds of looking around, he determined that Wat was not inside the house. He walked to the door on the side of the house and exited into the yard. To his shock, Wat was leaning against the wall just next to it, and John hastily lunged to catch the swinging door before his father was crushed behind it.
Once he had light, then he began to move the items from the bed onto the floor. Some of it belonged to him, but most of it did not. When the bed was cleared and John had shaken the dust out of the linen, John crawled into the bed.
John looked harassed. “No, it’s not!” As all other times when his sister teased him, becoming petulant was John’s default response.
Abruptly fed up with waiting, fed up with the feeling that he and the world he knew could be gobbled up at any moment, John asked bluntly, “What did that lord have to do with us? And aren’t we supposed to, I don’t know… Why didn’t you kneel to him?”
John still doesn't know how Sherlock returns his affection, and he could be doing something foolish at this very moment! Sherlock has to find him.
“No,” Jaituna said shortly in response, and Sherlock had the feeling that she would have paled even more if she had not already been at her limit. “I mean that you are not a child of my womb.”
His pillow is still indented from where John had lain his head. John's fragrance lingers on the pillow and the sheets. His bed smells like John. Sherlock takes a moment to press his face into the pillow and inhale deeply. The scent of John is mixed with that of Sherlock's linen, and Sherlock wants to smell this exact fragrance every day for the rest of his life.
Mycroft’s betrothed was seated in Mycroft’s section of the table, almost directly across from Sherlock’s. Mycroft had taken some time away from her in order to speak with some other nobles in attendance who he apparently considered worth his time. He had since returned to her and taken the seat beside her. Her father, Lord Tufaena, was not with his daughter but seated closer to the head of the table, only a few seats from the empress herself.
‘Those children are so young, definitely in the years when they should be regarding everything with innocent curiosity. Why would such young children already be so wary of adults? They look so… jaded.’ John thought.
It had been years since his mother had last visited Sherlock’s rooms. Her regal presence seemed to fill up the space differently than it had when he was younger, before he had learned the pretensions that were required of the royal family at court. It had been so long since Sherlock had interacted with his mother in private; it was difficult to look at his mother and only see her as that, not the empress she had to be in public. He had the novel feeling of being nervous around her. Thankfully, she broke the silence first.
“Can you hear anything at all, Harry?” Wat asked, drawing out his words and enunciating clearly, allowing Harry to attempt reading his lips to discern his words.
“Your room is still there, for when you’re ready to sleep,” Wat offered, “I’m thinking its about time I turned in, myself.”
Sherlock admires John's silhouette. As silhouettes go, objectively John's is moderately pleasing. Subjectively, Sherlock finds it unnervingly endearing.
As if there need be any greater punishment than the dull, repetitive, platitudinous experience of everyday palace life.
Slowly, as if she was a statue just come to life, Jaituna spoke to Sherlock as if his nanny had not interrupted. Where her voice was hesitant the first time, it was like iron the second time, “Sherlock, there is something that you need to know, but first you must promise me that the information will not leave this room. Mycroft seems to think that you are ready enough to handle more mature issues, and I respect that judgement.”
“Even when you’re all grown up, you still have to be very careful, John. Don’t forget, okay?” Wat reached down for John. John raised his arms so that his father could lift him up, since he was not tall enough to reach the shelf on his own.
Tomorrow, he would make plans. He needed to give Harry space, figure out what he could do to help Wat, and find some way to contribute to the household until Harry was actually ready to sort out her feelings. John tried to quiet his mind and was eventually able to fall asleep.
However, there were more pressing concerns at hand. Once Sherlock’s eyes had acclimated to the dimness enough to see the hall, he could see a set of stairs carved from the stone of the wall to his left. He ascended them rapidly, taking no care to muffle or silence his footsteps. However, it seemed that luck was on Sherlock’s side; although he burst from the stairway, the mage was too engrossed in his own task to notice Sherlock’s sudden appearance.
Wat was lying in his bed, peacefully asleep. John approached him. There was a window in Wat’s room, cut into the wall above the head of Wat’s bed. Even though John could not see much in the failing light, he picked out the sheen of scars, spidering across the visible half of his father’s face like ragged vines. The quilt had been pulled up over Wat’s chest, almost to his neck, so John could not see much more than that. The severity of the scarring was a harbinger of dread, though. It gave John the feeling that his hopes Harry had overstated the situation were likely in vain.
“Highness?” A voice called from outside of his periphery. Male. Likely a guard, then. Compared to servants, there was a disproportionate amount of them this deep in the castle. Voice possessing a strained quality that meant he had probably been calling for Sherlock for quite some time but had lacked the temerity to approach or intrude on him.
“Today wasn’t quite so bad,” Sherlock ignored the return of his mother’s amusement, “but I’m bored with my studies and life in the palace is so—”
The woman certainly lived on a farm—the slight stains around her fingertips smacked of berry-picking and her skin was quite weathered from sun and wind—and she was a fairly recent widow, made apparent by the ill-fitting nature of her dress. It had clearly been made for a much wider woman, though not for a taller one, which indicated the dress had always been her size, and likely always been hers. Still, there was a nagging feeling, perhaps it was in his own innate magic, telling him that the woman—
Mik’s face seemed to cool a bit, but his reply had an acerbic tone, “Who wants to spend their whole day hitting a ball of rags with a stick, John? I want to know more about the world outside of our own district. I want to know what the emperor is doing, like… My parents have been arguing with each other, lately. My papa says we might be going to war, that one of the lords is so wealthy he might try to take over the whole empire.”
John planned to visit Mik tomorrow. He would ask about his father’s treatment and see if there was any work available for him at the clinic.
“She’s—” Mycroft started, but Sherlock cut him off with a breathless word, expelled from him almost involuntarily.
“Shut up, brat,” Harry glared good-naturedly over her shoulder as she threw the thick cloth tarp on the frame above their heads. The tarp would provide shade for them and the fish if the sun got too overbearing.
“Ah, no,” Jaituna tsked, and wagged her finger at him. “Go to sleep now, Sherlock. I will sleep in one of your other rooms tonight, nearby so there will be no more mischief. From assassins, or from you.”
Both boys watched Wat go for a moment. John turned back to Mik to continue where they had left off. Mik spoke up first, still looking after Wat’s distancing figure.
“Look at Harry!” John grinned and pointed, squealing up at his father. Wat smiled indulgently at John’s actions but never took his gaze from his daughter, standing precariously close to the edge of the deck.
Sherlock surfaces from his deep thoughts to find that John has led him into their apartment, taking over care of Sherlock's body and wellbeing (transport, the tedious thing) in the moments when Sherlock's thoughts had run away with his consciousness.
“We had to throw the seed,” John muttered, disappointment lacing his voice, “so we can’t plant a peach tree.”
Wat was with the sole owner of a neighboring stall. He was assisting her with trying to dig her wares out of the mess of what remained of her benches, racks, and tables. There were glints of color near their feet every so often, tiny loose beads or broken clay pieces from the pottery she had been selling.
“And now you think you can just come back,” Harry continued, though John had turned and most of his focus was toward deciphering the figure of his father from the shadows. “Now that everything is better and settled and I’ve done all the work? No, John! I won’t stand for it. If that’s how…  if that’s how you expect it to be, you may as well go back! Just run away again!”
They caught up over breakfast. To John’s surprise, Mik had got a bit better at sharing the conversation and did not just chatter. He seemed to be genuinely interested in what John had done during his time away. Mik was still more than happy to talk at length about what running the clinic had been like after Dr. Vihaan had left, but he did pause for breath every now and again.
John, a bundle of keen energy, bounded over to his father and grabbed a fistful of the fabric near his hip to stop his momentum. Harry approached more calmly.
What would John think of that? Sherlock's friend, whose attention and appreciation Sherlock craves, who freely gives Sherlock that devotion--when he isn't lavishing it on nonexistent hidden compartments. Sherlock tries not to be jealous.
At any rate, it had been a fairly clear case, the only hitch being that the thief had met his untimely demise before he had been able to confess the location of his spoils to NSY. One text from Lestrade to Sherlock's mobile, and few hours later has even that bit sorted, despite Sherlock's slight (unnoticeable, John, surely) lethargy. All in all, Sherlock deems this case clean enough: the case has ended without the taste of blood in his mouth, which is often the line he uses to differentiate and which fact is also likely a relief to John--if Sherlock could be bothered enough to consider that.
Sherlock could scarcely believe his ears. After he had been so clever, had deduced even what Mycroft had not (though could it really be called true deduction, he wondered), so clever that it had even stayed his father’s tongue from scolding him… to have it be his brother who reprimanded him, instead… it both confused and infuriated Sherlock.
The house was dark. The shades over the windows were still pulled back, which would have let any sunlight in. However, it was just past dusk there was very little natural light to be had. Because of that, the floors of the house were completely shadowed and the walls were not much better. John reached out a hand, searching for the candle that had always sat in the corner of their sitting room window. His hand only encountered the cool clay that made up the windowsill, no candle to be found. So, it seemed some things had changed.
“Anyway, he’s supposed to be super rich. I was told that he’s so rich, he basically bullied the emperor into betrothing the crown prince to his daughter. They’re so young, too! Way before the age even most royalty gets betrothed, I think, so Tupanda must really be loaded. His daughter’s supposedly very sickly and never seen at court.
The nearby temple allowed the neighboring citizens, including John’s family, borrow books freely. Few of the citizens were literate, and the temple possessed a vast number of books, so any book John wanted was usually in stock and at his disposal. Because of this, John’s family had little cause to own any books themselves. The few books they did own were Wat’s and were exclusively about different branches of magic, spells, and enchantments.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Sherlock spat acidly. “I just did exactly as we have done all day! What, are you jealous?”
Sherlock wakes up alone the next day. Judging by the angle at which the sun is illuminating his floorboards, he has slept through the entire morning and well into late afternoon. What a waste of time, all those hours sleeping when criminals were getting up to crimes (hopefully some of them were interesting) all across the city! There is so much to learn, so much to deduce and unravel!
“You should eat a little something,” Harry insisted. She pulled a mango from a bowl on the counter and began peeling it with a knife. When John saw how she peered down at the knife and how her hands trembled, he wrestled the knife away from her. Harry protested at a volume that John thought was probably loud enough to wake their neighbors on both sides of the house.
The marketplace itself was one long street, wider than most others. There were buildings on each side, inns, apothecaries, and other merchants of the like. In front of those permanent shops, other sellers set up temporary stands to sell their wares on certain days, such as Wat and his children did.
"Sorry, I shouldn't have done this when it's clear you're so tired," John says, clearly amused but also pleased by Sherlock's response. Sherlock mentally deconstructs John's expression: his amusement is for Sherlock's verbal gaff, his satisfaction is because of Sherlock's favorable response to his romantic overtures.
“Yes!” John exclaimed in joy. He wasted no time in running off down the street to find his favorites.
I hope I conveyed his bittersweet relationship with Mycroft successfully in this chapter. He's overbearing and annoying, but he loves Sherlock and vice versa. Sherlock still admires him, at this point.
Sherlock turned his face away from his brother again, though Sherlock worried it might be pointless to try maintaining an unaffected façade at this point. Ahead, in their path of travel, he caught sight of a bustling group of courtiers, likely abuzz because of someone important. He and Mycroft were still too far away to identify who it was.
Excitement thoroughly concluded, Sherlock jumped at the chance to escape the tedious duties. He practically leapt from his chair. When he would have literally run for the door, Mycroft wrapped a quick hand around his arm and escorted him from the room in a more stoic manner, befitting their station.
“They are here to support Mycroft. Remember, his birthday is less than a month away. Preparations for the celebration have already begun.” There was pride in the empress's voice, a tone that he rarely ever heard her use when speaking of anything but her empire. “Your brother is a very important man and already people wish to curry his favor.”
John’s platoon had only just finished subduing an attack on the southern border of the nation, after months of grueling battle. John was sure there were still bits of dried mud flaking off of him, and that was after he had washed several times. He was a captain though. He was a man now, with responsibilities to more than just his family. The men under his command were owed a leader, and John had been given a wartime promotion that had eventually been made officially.
John kept his eye on the bird as he placed the pit in Harry’s free left hand. She too looked up at the bird, took a moment to aim, and threw the pit. It disappeared into the leaves of the branch above the bird, causing them to rustle and the bird to startle. It took flight without hesitation. John had not realized he had been holding his breath, but now he released it in relief and took a deep breath. He looked up at Harry in amazement. She was smiling down at him, fond. It was good to have a big sister, John thought. Or a big brother.
John’s mouth and throat were dry, and it was only then that John realized that he had been yelling up at the boy, screaming a cheer for him that may as well be a whisper since not a bit of it was audible over the deafening roar of pounding elephant feet. The elephants thundered by and took the boy on with them. Though the feelings had been the most intense John could ever remember feelings, the entire episode only lasted moments.
Harry suddenly clapped her hands a few times, which startled John. Then she clapped again, almost manic.
Mycroft made no such effort to hide his ire. His voice was sharp and cold, “Must you persist in being obtuse, brother? Every moment of life in this castle is part of the game, every interaction with someone else another move on the board. Small victories can be fun or diverting at times, but the real object of the game is to have and keep your power. Those with no might behind them do not survive, Sherlock.”
As Sherlock watched, a face emerged slowly from behind the woman’s head. Based on his clothes and the way he was holding onto the woman, it seemed to be the ghost of the woman’s husband, the late farmer. The apparition stepped forward a bit at Sherlock’s command, but would not release his wife’s shoulder.
John mumbled around his fingers. “Mik said I’m a runt, too. Everybody said it so that means it’s true, I guess…”
“We had only been in our new home, this house, when we received a delivery. It was a wagon full of gold, sent from Tufaena, and it came with a letter, mocking us.”
Reader's Notes: Okay, so this was my first time reading Johnlock smut out loud, and I'm not sure if I got all John's passion-y sounds right. That said, I had previously been warned that it is difficult to read the sexy bits of stories aloud for the first few times... I must be shameless, because I just read the whole thing through and didn't blush one single time. SMH (all my talents are useless in RL)
As they left, Sherlock noted that Mycroft’s eyes followed the apprentice’s departure. He smirked at his brother. The movement drew Mycroft’s eyes to him.
Sherlock was shocked. He had always been told, by his parents and his nanny, that he should be grateful for the privileges his high birth afforded him. Since Sherlock looked to them with respect, and for guidance, he had tried to at least appear to be grateful, even in the moments when he was not. To hear his brother, who he also looked up to, contradict them shook him.
Author's Notes: I'm so sorry for the delay! Back in school and buried by life. But I know where this story is going, and when my internet is returned to me tomorrow *grumble grumble growl* I can keep writing more insteadofstudying--I mean, when I am all done with homework, naturally.
“Still, it’s better to be safe now rather than sorry later. For example, a curse for bad luck may not affect us, but give everyone around us bad luck instead. It can be very dangerous. Or… a spell to make a person taller could end up making you even shorter,” Wat smiled a knowing smile.
Jaituna motioned for the group to continue, and as they all entered the dining room, replied to Sherlock, “Now, don’t speak of your brother that way, my dear. You know it’s inappropriate.”
“Your mom is still active, I see,” John teased. Mik responded by shooting John a humorless, impatient look.
By the time John thought he had cleaned everything enough to satisfy his father, his anxiety was a tired, ever present thrum running beneath. The tanner agreed to store their meager belongings there to save John the trouble of having to put them in the icehouse storage. John was honestly grateful for the man’s considerate nature, but John did not have the energy to muster the appropriate level of enthusiasm as he thanked him.
“Oh relax, Harry” Wat said, after he had calmed down and was wiping away the tears his delight had left behind, “or you’ll start looking like that one.”
Jaituna stiffened and a discomfited look passed over her face as she looked at Hadsana. At Sherlock’s words, Hadsana had brightened considerably, but after seeing the empress’ expression, she replied, “Oh, no, not at all! Perish the thought, your highness!”
John, overjoyed, leapt out of his father’s lap and tackled his sister in a hug, who just barely saved herself from spilling the almonds all across the deck. Harry just laughed.
Suddenly he remembered the moment earlier that day, the boy on the elephant, and how he had been so exhilarated—felt that he was at the head, barely in control of a great force that could smother him, but in control all the same. Now John was experiencing similar feelings, was still almost swallowed up by the strength of his emotion, yet this time he felt like he was on the edge of a precipice, at the rim of a great mouth that was ready to consume him.
Harry slowed a bit but did not spare a glance over her shoulder for her brother. “’Harry, wait! Oh, Harry’ –John, I told you to stay home. Father is teaching me our family trade today and you’ll just get in the way. As always!”
There was a reason that his mummy was empress, Sherlock thought, feeling much better, if a little wrung out. Mummy really could fix anything.
“Mummy!” Sherlock exclaimed, startling Jaituna when he shot up straight. Sherlock wove the tale of his episode in the garden to his mother, who grew progressively paler.
Jaituna was appeased by this and turned away. Sherlock thought that Hadsana still looked sort of pleased at the thought that Sherlock thought of her as his godmother. He felt warm at the thought. He considered trying not to manipulate her so harshly in the future. Maybe he could whine a little less?
“Actually, Harry and I have had a bit of a falling out. I’m honestly not sure I would be welcome aboard the family vessel right now,” John said, chuckling as if it was a joke. Contrary to his words, John was actually fairly certain Harry would refuse to speak to him, let alone sail with him right now. “I was hoping that I might be able to put my limited healing knowledge to use, if you’ve got any work available.”
“And good riddance,” Mik added when they had gone further down the hallway. “I hate butchering. I’m a doctor specializing in illness and disease for goodness’ sakes. I know it’s too bad that there aren’t any butchers in the district, but what’s that got to do with me, huh? Why doesn’t she just move somewhere else, then?”
John would be that graceful, too, he vowed to himself. When he was bigger. John was too little now, but that was okay.
Of the necessities that came with their family trade, market days were John’s favorite. He loved the active air of the place: music played erratically, hot food sold by food vendors, seeing the various wares of the neighboring stalls. Everything was so colorful, so vibrant, endlessly fascinating or familiar. He disliked how, on particularly warm days, they had to cover the fish and be mindful of the freshness. On windy days such as this one, the fish also needed protecting from dust and other airborne nuisances. It was tedious, but it was not as if he had many options. He was to be a fishmonger, as his sister was, and his father before her.
When he had heard that Mycroft would be leaving the palace to survey the outer plains, he had jumped at the chance to accompany him. The palace staff had been becoming even more overbearing than usual, always watching him.
“Mummy, are you saying that I can go to learn about foreign magic in another land?” Sherlock had to be sure that he was understanding correctly. This was not the time to allow wishful thinking to influence him.
Mik, who had never been much taller than John, had experienced a growth spurt of approximately an inch and a half in height, but considerably more inches in width. John was still waiting for his own growth spurt, and rather hoped he grew more than Mik had, and up instead of out. Mik’s face had filled out with the chubby look reminiscent of cherubs. It made him incapable of looking fierce. Even his glares, though they were few—he had mellowed some as he aged into his teen years, conversely to the rest of the adolescents in the neighborhood who seemed to aspire to be the next Harry, breathing fire and roaring loudly and being generally as irritable as a dragon—were not heavy like most glares. Personally, John felt that Mik’s sternest glare was akin to being glared at by a small river lizard, that is: small, without consequences, and unreasonably cute.
John carried the food back to the stand. Though there was a veritable mountain of food, the three of them demolished it speedily. There were no leftovers and, when they had finished, Harry embarrassed them all by slowly sucking her fingers. John thought it was childish and immature, but then he noticed the behavior had drawn the eye of a fair few people in the market.
Nextly, I received valuable critique about Sherlock being a little out of character with his apparent instant attachment to John. I have a few reasons: 1) I am a hopeless sentimental idiot, so unfortunately he mirrors that a little. 2) My favorite view of Sherlock is sort of the mid series 2, post Hounds/pre Fall Sherlock, who grasps that John matters to him, who's still himself but more or less understands the give-and-take of having someone who cares about him. 3) This is AU. Sherlock if he chose to dance Moriarty's jig without totally selling his morality. He is softer than the real Sherlock, but not as soft as he gets sometimes.
“Well, come through to the kitchen and I can whip us up something quick,” Mik answered, ushering John through the clinic’s waiting room and down a hallway towards the back of the building.
First, it seemed like nothing, maybe a strange shift in the breeze. Then it felt like a lurch in the earth, down deeper than John had ever been. He put a hand to the stall’s table in front of him, trying to gauge the movement. There was a tremble going through the table, a strong vibration that shook John’s hand.
John set to work preparing dinner while he waited for Harry to get home or Wat to wake up. He was happy to see that their pantry was well-stocked. John had hoped to ease the strain on Harry as much as possible until he was able to return home. It appeared that, although he had been absent, he had been able to help. It eased some of John’s concern.
“Alright, Harry, that’s enough,” Wat said, mostly successful with smothering his chuckles though not his smile, “John was just excited. He won’t do it again, right John?”
The morning was temperate but dry, the slight breeze blowing dust from the yard over John’s feet as he crossed the threshold of his home.
“Harry’s brother, you say?” The young man shot a sideways glance over to their stall, where Harry was haggling with a customer. She was smiling and her dark hair glinted red in the sunlight.
Sherlock is waaaaay OOC for an 11-yr-old child, even a precocious one (like I imagine John to be) but hey, he's Sherlock.
With a wan smile, Mycroft engaged Sherlock in a game in which the petitioners seated before them became subjects of their intense scrutiny. As these were the exact same subjects who had bored Sherlock practically insensate only moments ago, Sherlock considered that this was proof his brother could truly make anything interesting with the power of his mind.
Sherlock could not understand what she meant. There were obvious dissimilarities between him and Mycroft, though he was certain his mother would not stoop to saying something so obvious, so… “Are you talking about that rumor that Mycroft is not papa’s son?”
John did not want to know. He was horrified at all of this. He had thought he wanted to know, but now he knew that he did not ever want to. The pain on his father’s voice was something he had never heard before. He could only imagine what his mother had felt, to be violated in that way, to be attacked by someone she had trusted.
Harry stopped at the shelf inside of the door, gave the wooden box a gentle tap, and hurried inside to begin lighting the candles.
Mycroft was able to gather his wits and recover more quickly than Sherlock, whose mouth was still gaping a bit in surprise. He tilted his head at the lady the tiniest amount necessary in order to apologize and said, “My sincerest apologies, Lady Tremaine. Congratulations on your new child.”
John smiles and leans in to kiss him again, a chaste peck on the lips that is clearly a goodnight kiss. They settle close together, facing each other, heads resting on the same pillow. John wraps an arm around Sherlock's back and Sherlock throws an arm over John's shoulders.
“Well, actually, I only threw yours. I still have mine,” Harry said smartly, reaching into her sash and pulling out the pit. “Oh! And here, papa, I brought some almonds too, in case we got hungry.”
The inside of the house was shadowy and dark, barely lit at all with the spotty light from the setting sun. It was too late for the sun to illuminate much, but too early for the moon’s rise.
Siger made a show of waving a welcoming hand and gesturing to the newly appointed chair next to Mycroft. There had not been enough room for it on the dais, so it was lower and approximately a foot further back from the seats his father and brother already filled.
Uncharacteristically, Jaituna had retrieved Sherlock and her hands encased his shoulders as the family swiftly exited the room. He noticed that the guards had apprehended the assassin, gagged him, and were taking him somewhere. The dungeons, Sherlock’s mind filled in, sluggishly.
As loud as Harry could normally be, her current volume was much more than she usually inflicted on people in close conversation. John shrank back a bit, perplexed and a little offended. He had not been playing around, what was she talking about? Why was everyone saying such backwards things today? John could not understand it and called for his father.
John waited impatiently for the sun to be high enough in the sky that he could beg some lunch money from his father and procure some street food. When Wat’s own stomach growled loud enough for John and Harry to hear it, John spoke over Harry’s raucous laugh.
“Though your mother enjoyed learning about the magic, we were both concerned that the lord spent so much time and attention on a single employee of his massive household. One evening, she asked me if she should quit and look for a position in another household. He had not yet done anything inappropriate, so I advised her to stay on while we asked around to see if any of our friends knew of an open position in any other households. John, if I had known…” Wat voice was strangled, and he hung his head with a pained noise.
Sherlock goes to New Scotland Yard, but they've been advised not to let him in without Lestrade who, inconveniently, is not answering his phone. Sherlock has called him seven times now. He has called John twenty times.
Wat pointed to another fish, this one pink and flat with red eyes. Unlike most of the other fish, it was parallel to the bottom of the basin, its flat face and body giving the entire fish a squashed and disgruntled appearance.
John began to make his way home. Even though there were a few other vendors leaving at the same time, no one spoke. To John, the entire world seemed quiet. The sun had set some time ago, and the sky had begun darkening. Even the cicadas that buzzed and chirped at the oncoming night seemed muted.
Sherlock tried to snatch his hands back from the snake but, having landed on his front and with no solid ground underneath him, he simply landed face first on the snake. He looked down and noticed that, because the mass beneath him was writhing, he had actually landed on a different snake when he fell the second time.
Harry unwrapped her side of the net from the pole. She and Wat began dragging the net over to the basin. Wat called John over to help. The three of them heaved the fish over the rim of the tub and into the basin, all the while John kept trying to get his fingers through the gaps of the net to feel the slick bodies of the fish as they moved.
One of her keepsakes was kept on a shelf near the door, a small brass figurine that looked like a rabbit, her namesake. A wooden box sat next to it, an heirloom passed down through Wat’s side of the family. His father and Harry touched it when they came into the house each day, and his father always made a point of holding John’s hand while he did so. They stopped at the nearby ice house, where John watched avidly as his father paid to store the fish there. It had only taken moments before they resumed their journey home.
“Wat’s sons are here! Wat’s sons are here!” John echoed her as she leaned the plank against the side of the ship, steadied it, and began to walk up. She alighted at the top for only a moment before she was coming back down after a “Help your brother” from their father.
Try to overpower the mage, and then force the man to information from him? What the spell was on, what the spell was, and how to counter it, all before the pitcher reached the table—no, Sherlock did not have that kind of time. And that was assuming that he was able to subdue the man who, although Sherlock had faith that his own education in magicks was more thorough, could command foreign magic that Sherlock could not understand himself. That would make defending against the mage’s spells difficult. So even if he could take the man down, in that short period of time—unlikely—could he trust the man to tell him the truth about the spell he had cast? Sherlock could place an honesty geas on him, but that was risky and would take time Sherlock did not have. No.
Sherlock respected his father. If Siger was subjecting not only himself but also both of his sons to this ceremony, then Sherlock figured that surely there must be something to be learned from it. He would try, at the very least.
Sherlock paces by his bed, stopping to study the light scattering of a black, ash-like substance that covers the floor near his bed. He takes a sample to investigate later and cleans up the rest. He hates cleaning, of course. He's only doing it because he knows what needs to be done next, and he hates that more.
About an hour passed before John saw his father coming down the lane with the icehouse’s cart. The sun had just begun to peek over the horizon, and the rays shone brilliantly warm tones of red and purple across the dirt of the marketplace.
Sherlock noticed that he was on the opposite side of the dining room from where he had been earlier. This was the side closer to the kitchens. The dining staff came and went from multiple hidden entrances, most of which were covered with curtains.
Still, as was part of the tradition, he leaned over and tried to guess the tale the book told from the illustrations on the cover, ignoring the title. He did not have to guess at the tale this time, though. The book that she held in her hand had always been one of his favorites. When he recognized the story, he recited a line.
Wat had been distracted for most of the night, since Harry had been mistakenly given the wine that the adults had been drinking. Of course, Harry had been able to tell that it tasted funny immediately, which only made her drink it all the faster. She had managed to finish most of it before Wat had noticed and, since she had been only twelve at the time, was uproariously drunk. Harry, at the best of times, was like a firecracker lit indoors. Tipsy, she was… better? Worse?
Sherlock followed him into one of the palace’s gardens, sprinting for all he was worth. There was not a guard in sight, which Sherlock noted but was not too alarmed by. This was one of the public gardens which were open to anyone who was visiting the palace, not his mother’s private garden. IF they were supposed to be manned at all times by a guard, Sherlock did not know it.
When Wat approached, John just pointed to Harry. Wat laid a firm hand on her upper back to draw Harry’s attention, and she turned toward him, swift and sharp like a whip.
The possibility that he might find something thrilling had revitalized him, until the convoy had reached the plains. He had been disappointed, at first. The plains were just that: plain. Flatland and scrub, dry and dusty, for as far as his eye could see. But then, on the outskirts of civilized land, or at least as far as the heir of the empire was allowed to go, there had been an elephant breeder eager to showcase his herd to the crown prince, and Sherlock, well… anyway, now he was being punished.
Most stalls were set in front of complimentary shops. The farmer’s stand was set in front of the bakery, who was able to take things from the stand and improve their own offerings, for example. There was a merchant selling beads and bolts of fabric set in front of a tailor and a stall selling imported teas in front of one of the streets few restaurants. John’s family’s stall was in front of a leather tanner, one of the few shops who thankfully wouldn’t complain about the smell of dead fish since the scent of the skins inside was already so strong.
John would not go back to the army, especially not now that he had seen how badly his family needed him. He would request an extended leave, which should be granted now that their border was adequately protected again.
Wat looked to John. “That was very dangerous, John. I know you want to learn about the fish, but some of these fish bite. You have to be careful, boy. Here, sit still and wait for us to get the other net, then I’ll teach you about the fish that we caught today.”
This one, though, had a beautifully made paladin. Figures and creeping vines were etched into the sides. It reminded John uncomfortably of their family heirloom. Could such things be bought so casually by those of this class?
Sherlock glanced at Mycroft, incredulous and suspicious, “You expect me to believe that you’re seriously advocating anarchy right now, Mycroft? You, of all people?”
"No, Sherlock," Mrs. Hudson says, slow and stilted, face an intriguing myriad of emotions: sadness, anger, fear, pity, and a few others Sherlock can't spend the moments it takes to detangle. "Oh dear, have you seen the news Sherlock? Maybe you should sit down. We can talk--"
“I don’t go to market,” Sarah clarified, moving beside Mik to hang a few rabbits on smaller hooks and begin skinning the animals. “I just bring the meant to an old friend of my dad’s.  He’s a merchant there, so he sells the meat for me and gives me a portion of the profit.”
Harry’s most recent letter had worried him. As Harry had listed them, Wat’s injuries had seemed quite extensive. John was not sure if his father would be able to make a full recovery or, if he could, how long that might take. John still had a bit of medical knowledge—some of his training and duties had been too gruesome to forget—and he could minimally imagine what sort of damage had occurred during his father’s trauma. Still, John was also used to Harry and her wild descriptions of things. She was more than prone to exaggeration; John was not sure if she could ever truly abstain from elevating a situation to the most dramatic level it could reach.
