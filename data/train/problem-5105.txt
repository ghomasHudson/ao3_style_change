His phone buzzes again.
“No,” Cas shakes his head. “No, I fear she isn’t.”
“Well, I told her about Sam wanting a dog. That’s about it in terms of personal information.”
They stay like that until the uncomfortable position on the floor becomes too much. Even then, they move away from each other only reluctantly. And they stay close, always in the same room or in each other’s space all the way until Charlie rings the doorbell. Cas goes to open then while Dean starts making a pot of coffee for them.
Behold, a minor miracle has happened! Not only is the hiatus over and we have a new chapter for you, no we have indeed
Steve lets out the breath he had been holding.
,” he adds in Castiel’s direction, the challenge open in his eyes.
it. How does that make it
“So he could just be a good writer,” Dean points out.
“Must be,” Dean nods.
“What’s Nat doing here?” Bucky asks with a frown.
Dean grimaces and because he can’t well start a fight with his ‘husband’ right now, he answers in a sickly-sweet tone. “If it’s that important for you, honey...”
“Yup,” Dean agrees.
“I gather out of the same reason that you don’t live with your grandma anymore. We have to be who we are.”
“A decision after my own heart. You?” he turns to Cas.
She looks at him for another long moment, making sure that he’s no lying to her, then she nods abruptly and lets go of him. “Good. Go make yourself useful.”
“Is she really that bad?” Cas asks.
“Yeah, right,” Dean chuckles. “Wait, are you serious?”
What is he going to answer? Is he going to answer? Dean’s heart picks up its pace as the possibility occurs to him for the first time.
Cas looks so crushed that Dean can’t take it. He wraps his arms around Cas and engulfs him in a hug. “‘S not true. You’re awesome and you’re helpful and since when are you listening to me anyway?” When Cas wants to protest, Dean hugs him tighter.
when Steve’s weight crashes into him but he doesn’t pull away, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck instead, and that’s enough invitation for Steve to seal their lips together.
?” he splutters. Living in suburbia is becoming a serious health risk, seeing how often he’s choked on his own spit lately.
Charlie raises her eyebrows at the statement and Dean can feel himself flush.
Cas had been freaky good at that. Knowing when Dean was too far inside his own head to make the right calls.
(See the end of the chapter for
Eileen finally showed up, yay! I approve! That said, I’m both hearing and not a doctor, so I’m doing my best, but if you find something that’s completely off, find me on twitter (or tumblr, but I’m not there very often anymore) and let me know.
He rolls his eyes. “It doesn’t work like that, you know that, right? Just cause he can get me to do stuff, doesn’t mean it works the same for you.”
“Would you prefer ‘brother’? Cause you know, technically, we’re foster brothers and all.”
She wants him to move in with her. In fact, she wants him to not even go back home but go with her to her apartment right now. And Dean? Dean’s got no idea how to get out of that. How to convince her to listen to him. How to even get enough words out to start on this topic.
“He didn’t tell?”
The easy smirk is still there. It’s different now, though. He’s teasing, but it’s friendly ribbing like you tease a friend. He’s not actually trying to rile Dean. He’s trying to tell him that they’re not in trouble with SHIELD. And Dean can appreciate that.
Then it hits him. That last word is not for Dean. Or it is, because Dean is the recipient of the letter, but it’s the one word that isn’t carefully tailored to be for him. That isn’t Cas trying to give Dean what he needs.
Dean almost starts laughing, the situation is so absurd. “Is anyone else getting an Ocean’s Eleven vibe here?” he chuckles. “No? Just me? That’s okay.”
“Yeah, I get that,” Dean nods. People had reacted to his dad the same way. Averting their eyes and politely moving on. Dean kind of thinks that if someone had looked closer they might have seen the two suffering children behind John’s imposing figure. “My dad he - never talked about it.”
Sam grimaces at that. And yeah, while Dean's still got mixed feelings about this, he's pretty sure that Sam is 98% relieved that their dad will never show up again anywhere ever. But then, Sam had been smart about their dad from the beginning, while Dean had clung onto wishful thinking for way too long.
“You’re a good man, Dean,” Cas mumbles against his lips. “You deserve everything good in the world.”
He shakes his head, though the corners of his mouth are drawn up in a smile at the memory. “I was a weird kid.”
part of the sentence. He could do with a little warmth and bare skin tonight.
Cas’ hands cramp into his bed sheets and for a long moment, he looks torn. Then he breathes out deeply and lets go of the fabric. He turns to the closet and rummages in a drawer until he unearths a pair of PJ pants. “I’m going to go change in the bathroom.”
“People can be more than one thing, Dean,” Cas says with a slight rebuke, though his smile is wide, an open-mouthed grin like he’s delighted about how many details Dean’s picked up and thought about. “I can be a boring office guy, an ex-soldier, a white upper-middleclass man, a bisexual male and an estranged father all at the same time. I can have been brought up to be narrow-minded and still strive to be a better person.”
But Bucky just makes a weird noise and says, “Yeah, I guess you could say that. What about you? Your man or you the one who gives the orders?”
“You remember that.”
No answer. There is the possibility that he just didn’t hear him, so Dean keeps calling for him as he walks deeper into the house. “Cas? Are you here?”
“Thanks. You’re a lifesaver.” Then Sam gestures vaguely back towards the houses. “Alright, I guess I should…”
Steve nods. He can tell Natasha is serious. “I took this assignment to give him a few weeks of peace. But I try to keep boundaries. I know he’s not good and I don’t plan to abuse my position of power.”
going to happen!”
“Dean, you can’t honestly mean that!” Cas sounds caught between outraged and flabbergasted still. “Amara
“I’m the
am I talking about.”
“Shut up. And stay put. I’m gonna be there in a few hours, okay?”
“I’m sorry.”
Which leaves his tumblr tab open.
Against the odds, that makes Dean smile. When Cas looks at him questioningly, Dean says, “I like it when you do that. When you talk about the pack and include yourself with ease, as if you had never felt any differently.”
“Shoot me now,” Claire lets herself fall back dramatically in her chair and almost keels over, chair and all.
“Don’t want to lose you, either,” Dean whispers and suddenly he’s got his hands fisted into Cas’ dirty shirt to cling on to him and then Cas draws him into a tight hug. It’s the kind of hug where you feel like you’re drowning and holding on is the only way you can get a tiny bit of air and maybe, just maybe survive long enough to come back to the surface.
Only it had. It had fucked him up so much more than he let on.
“What about the documents he needs?” Gabriel asks.
“Hi Sam,” Cas answers and his voice sounds lower than normal. Lower as in, coming from below. Where he’s crouching and holding his hand out for the dog to sniff. “Hi there, Simpson.”
Bucky and Nat are sitting out on the porch when Steve comes back, the spy hardware in the living-room beeping quietly, abandoned to work on its own.
Sam startles. “Claire’s - what?”
“Wait, let me help.”
. Because I haven’t seen him like this, either.”
She goes on to hug Cas who hugs her back a little awkwardly but fiercely.
“Yes. Be careful, Dean.”
“What?” Cas asks.
Cas rolls his eyes. “Your puns are awful. Also, I am not asking because I want to know how long I have to bury your body before someone misses you, I’m asking, because if you have a concussion, I’m not letting you go home to an empty apartment. So if you live alone, you’ll have to give me the address of your family and I’ll drive you there.”
Cas has his head tilted like he’s trying to puzzle Dean out, but to Dean’s relief he gets with the program and lets it slide, pointing to a stack of grass green sheets. “Those. I like those.”
“I don’t – this, I don’t do it very often. Never really found a safe space for myself. And there’s enough possibilities for a quick night when you work at a bar. So that’s the easier route.” Dean swallows hard. “But with you I’d like to – I promise I’m not always such a mess. I can be better.”
There’s nothing Dean can do. He can’t say No to this. Not without spawning a barrage of questions. “Yes, Sammy. Course. Nothing I would want more than to morally compromise your offspring.”
“It’s been a long time since then.”
"Nah," Claire sighs heavily. "Tell him he can come by." There's more apprehension in her voice than she wants to let on, though.
Dean takes a deep breath and gets out through gritted teeth, “Fine. I’ll figure it out without you then.”
“He does?” Sam asks. “What? Where? How?”
“Yeah,” Dean nods. “Only then he left, and that was a weird conversation in itself, and then you came along and insisted on talking about shit, and…”
“I taught her,” Dean admits to Cas. “Saw it pretty instantly that Claire’s not the type to back down from a fight. Coulda have told her a hundred times to run and let someone else deal with the assholes, she was never gonna do it anyway. So now she at least knows what she’s doing.”
“Well,” Dean shrugs. “I guess the other person gets a choice, too, so you’d have to be lucky to find someone who’s up for that.”
"Nice? Far as I can tell anyway. He's got a dry humor that you got to get used to before you even notice when he's making a joke. He loves burgers. And I think he's a little lost. Like, he's lost everything that made sense to him a while back and I'm not sure he found something to replace that yet."
"Why?"
“Thanks, Charlie,” he smiles. If nothing else, he’s made a good choice in his best friend.
She’s never once admitted to her part in what happened, but she
“She found Jess, okay? And if she found Jess, she can find Sam, too. And she saw Cas, so he’s not safe, either. It’s just - it’s too high a risk, okay? I can’t do it!” It breaks out of him unbidden, hot tears suddenly residing right behind his eyes. He angrily blinks them back. “It’s better this way. Going with her is the only way. It’s how everything should be.” He hopes that it sounds more determined and less hollow than he feels.
give your real number to strangers! No matter how good looking or
“Well yes, Dean, of course. It is important that you can see when you hurt me and make amends for it.” The edge in her voice gets sharper with every word until her voice alone could cut glass.
“Dean, you do know what I do for a living, right?”
“It’s not,” Dean shakes his head. “Or it wasn’t. Believe me, I’ve almost lost Sam more times than I can count.”
“You’d do that?”
Cas catches his confusion, apparently, because he explains, “This house is mine and you are a guest in it. I don’t want that anymore. I want a house that is home to both of us.”
Dean turns up the volume another notch as if this could help him to get rid of the thought. It doesn’t help. Because he knows Amara will never ever agree to this. But he also knows that he has to try. And he’s not looking forward to that confrontation. In fact, he’s reasonably sure that Amara would rather see him dead than break their bond.
Cas treats that hand with the same devotion as the other. Dean watches it, morbidly fascinated, while he tries to wrap his head around any of this.
“I did,” Hannah confirms.
Dean presses his lips together. It’s none of Castiel’s business either way. So whether he’d like it or not is irrelevant. And it definitely should not spawn a surge of guilt in Dean. Or a wish to be good so that Castiel will be happy with him. He doesn’t know the guy at all for God’s sake.
“Yeah, man, if you do, at least don’t do it in this car. I’m never going to live that down.”
? Seriously, Cas?” Dean snorts.
That makes Dean guffaw with surprised laughter.
in the comics actually happened. In 1943!
“Not sure Nat’s doing your vocabulary any good,” Steve shakes his head. He dumps today’s clothes into the hamper and climbs into his side of the bed. Not his side. Not automatically. “Unless you wanted this side?” He asks Bucky.
“Would you – would you want me to come?”
“They will be here any minute,” Cas says, and Dean looks up at the clock and fuck, it really is that late already. At least the fries are almost ready but the patties need to go on the grill and the BBQ-sauce still needs attention and… this has to be perfect. He will show this Steve-dude what it means to get in the way of Dean Winchester, master chef.
“Had someone…” Cas blanches.
“Okay,” Bucky nods, but instead of going back out he lets the bedroom door click shut behind him and sits at the foot-end of the bed where Steve’s leaning against the headrest. He doesn’t crowd in on Steve, but he also doesn’t look like he has any intention of leaving him alone any time soon.
“For the record, I didn’t notice that Cas guy. It was - camaraderie, is all.” A weird sort of camaraderie, that for a moment there felt not unlike what happens in the trenches. Just in this case, the common cause was being two husbands trying to keep their bratty spouses from doing something they’d regret later. It made sense for a minute there.
Because angelheart never replies to anyone. Angelheart doesn’t have a tumblr, either. Angelheart leaves brilliant stories on AO3 and does not otherwise interact with the online world. That Dean or Charlie could find out about anyway. And they’ve tried. Oh, they’ve tried.
“Uhh, do you need another moment for your lovers’ quarrel or whatever this is? Or do you want me to actually look at that cut?” And somehow they haven’t even heard Chuck come back in.
For a long moment, Bucky looks at him silently. There are no empty promises of
That is both unexpected and worrying. But Steve guesses that if this guy found his inhuman powers somewhere in the middle of a battle situation, that might have had unforeseen consequences. So he tries to shake off his discomfort about the personal topic and answers to the best of his abilities. “It’s been awhile since we served together on an actual battlefield.” Not a lie. It’s been 70 years. If you don’t count facing off against each other not all that long ago. “We’ve always tried to save each other’s ass when we had the choice.” No need to elaborate how very little choice Bucky had in the matter in the past few decades. “But shit happens.” He almost hears the words in Natasha’s voice, they sound so directly out of her mouth.
“I don’t like getting an additional agent on a mission and not knowing why,” Steve growls.
“Natasha said, we’d have to come by so you can meet the dog anyway, right? So we can eat the rest of it together,” Cas says pleasantly.
“You’re such a nerd,” Dean groans.
“Yeah,” Dean nods. “The moose. He’s -,” Dean breaks off for a moment. Then he takes a deep breath. “He’s important. Don’t tell him that I said that, though. He’s gonna make fun of me. But yeah, I care about him a lot.”
Dean grumbles some more but he’d just been thinking about how he hopes Cas has someone to talk to, so really Dean should take his own advice and not lock his best friend out.
“I’m aware,” Sam nods. “Now look at this. This is from the website of the Smithsonian. Remind you of someone?”
“Dean? Are you listening?”
“But are you really sure that this case warrants all of this? I mean, renting a house is beyond what we normally do.”
Because these days, Dean’s actually kind of proud of his life, pathetic lovesickness aside. He’s got a job that he doesn’t hate, he’s got great friends, and back when he thought Cas was
“You know that it’s not necessary, right?” Ellen joins him at the stove where the first batch of popcorn is cooling and the next one is in the pan. “We have actual decorations and everything.”
Cas’ eyes flicker up to Dean’s. They stay there for a long moment, like Cas is weighing carefully what he wants to say. “I’m real, Dean,” is what he finally settles on. “This is real.”
“Yes,” Steve nods again.
“That’s pretty impressive,” Charlie agrees. “So he’s lawyering it up in sunny California?”
Cas saves him before he can do anything in that direction.
“What happened?” Cas asks quietly.
“No! No way, Cas,” Dean blurts out.
Cas nods his understanding and even manages to turn Bella around so that she comes to a halt closer to Kaz. “That speed was distinctly unpleasant.”
“Good for you,” Dean replies, aiming for gruff but missing by a mile. “You tired?”
"Yeah, yeah, whatever."
This time, Cas doesn’t say anything. His mouth forms a tight line.
Bucky huffs, a noise of disagreement that everyone else probably takes for normal, only Steve knows that Bucky doesn’t actually remember any of this. And it’s nice of him to disagree on principle, but, “I was a sickly child. My, uhh, final growth spurt didn’t happen until later. So I weighed something like 90 pounds wet, and I still couldn’t stop myself from getting into fights. When my asthma didn’t keep me inside, that is. I have no idea what you saw in me, Buck.”
!” Cas defends.
Dean lets himself sink into the feeling, Cas’ warmth steadily crowding out everything else. Crowding out the knowledge that this is not real, can’t be real, because people don’t catch Dean when he falls. Crowding out the knowledge that even if there was someone to catch him, it wouldn’t be Cas. Cas is out of his league and he knows it. He’s never answered what he does for a living or whether he’s single. He cares for Dean, tonight, yes, but he’s not ready to share his life with him. Not even with his words.
They get into a fight, almost at least. About who is going to drive. Because Dean will not make it a habit to let other people chauffeur him. Nevermind that Cas’ argument that the Impala is way too conspicuous is sound. Nevermind that without having eaten much all day Dean’s hands are kind of shaking and that it was a good idea last time Cas insisted on driving, too.
But all that happens is that Cas’ face gets ever more determined. “I’m not leaving you, Dean.”
“Shhh,” Cas draws a calming hand through Dean’s hair, petting the unruly strands before settling on keeping the hand at the back of Dean’s neck.
“That Corolla that’s been standing around for three days does,” Bobby counters.
“Means I’m playing for both teams, in case you’re not up to speed on terminology. What with you not being around diversity much and all.”
It gets him a fond eye-roll before Cas bends down to pick up the blankets. “Let’s just get these to the bedroom.”
“Yeah,” Dean whispers weakly, “yeah, I know that.”
“Care for a little fresh air? I can show you around the property if you want.” Maybe luck is with the brave. Just cause it’s Christmas or something.
“Yeah, no offense, but the recently fallen do not count. Cas means well but he’s not really of much help right now.”
“Want to tell me what happened?” Castiel asks.
Steve chuckles, though it’s not a happy sound. “No. No, it’s not quite as simple. You have to understand that we grew up in a very conservative - area.” Era is what he wants to say but he’s reasonably sure that that is not the appropriate word for the current company. It’s impossible enough for him to wrap his head around the fact that he met Bucky something like 85 years ago.
“I know,” the redhead nods but for the first time there’s a smile, too, as she pushes herself off the railing and comes closer. “You a biker?”
Nat gives him her patented
“Well, she is the one who sent me into that darkest valley,” he bites. “So it’s not necessarily a surprise that I’m not her fan.”
“Dude, as if you didn’t like the show,” Charlie snickers.
Cas’ lips draw into a tight line. “I know that you mean that sarcastically, but, Dean, a soulmate is not all there is to life. You are a whole person on your own.”
She smiles at him. “I am. I’m Charlie now and I intend to stay her for a long long time. But no, it’s not the name I was born with.”
“Did we actually do that?” Bucky turns around.
“That sounds doable,” Cas says. ”I will inform Steve.”
“But?” Cas asks.
Cas carefully takes one of them from the carton. “It seems very delicate,” he wonders while he turns it in his hand.
“There’s a back exit,” Cas says. “It’s staff only, she won’t see us go.”
“Yeah, as I said, I ain’t that strong,” Bucky sighs. “Can I come on your morning run?”
“Loyal sidekick, that’s me,” Bucky grins and ignores Steve’s immediate protests. “Nice meeting you.” He holds out his hand.
The wristband in his hand weighs heavily. He doesn’t remember even grabbing it. Part of him still wants to get rid of it while another, much louder part holds on as if his life depends on it. Things had been good, Dean was good to him - was good for him, in more ways than Cas could tell. Dean had wormed his way deeper into Cas’ heart than Cas had ever given him permission for. In fact, deep enough that Cas’ heart is aching even now.
“There’s blood running down your face,” the man observes.
But Dean has a hard time answering. Instead, he exhales a shuddering breath while Cas softly strokes his hand, the broken skin already scabbed over. His whole attention is on that part of Dean, broken and torn as it is, and he touches it reverently, gazes at it as if it is something special. Something he holds dear. Suddenly Dean shakes with the effort not to draw his hand out from under Cas’ touch. Whatever Cas is doing here, it’s bordering on too much very quickly. “Don’t be so – nice to me.” It’s not the right word, but it’s the best Dean can do.
Gabriel leads them into one of the lots and then into one of the warehouses. It’s a large space and not exactly bustling with activity. Still, there are a few people moving around, moving boxes and containers.
Cas’ voice shakes him out of it. The worried frown on Cas’ face has made the crease on his forehead even steeper than normal.
Dean fidgets uncomfortably. “Course not,” he mumbles.
Cas leaves around midnight. Dean tells him that tonight’s food and drinks are on the house but Cas sneaks a couple of bills under the plate anyway. Dean shakes his head and puts the money aside to give to Claire. It is Christmas after all.
“So, are you telling me I’m wrong? That this the first time we’re feeling this or doing this?”
“You okay there?” Dean asks worriedly.
“Look, Cas, I gotta-,” Dean stops, bracing himself against a junker for a moment because his breathing is too shallow and it makes him kinda dizzy. “I gotta tell you that thing that I accused you of blackmailing me about.”
“Home.”
Dean doesn’t answer because sarcasm is okay but if he answers he’ll accidentally tell her how happy it makes him that Cas tried to elbow him in the face instead of ignoring his existence, and then she’s going to declare him certifiable. Which, in all fairness, he probably is.
Seeing that he can’t actually listen in, he observes Sam interestedly while Simpson patiently waits and only sniffs around the wall a little. It’s intricate, the gestures and expressions flowing into each other, even though every so often there is a pause in the flow as if Sam is looking for the right words. Steve’s immediately fascinated. He decides on the spot that he should try to learn some sign language as well, for Clint’s benefit but also because he remembers how it was when his hearing was sub-par. Frankly, it sucked. So if he can make someone more comfortable by knowing their language, he should make the effort.
Immediately, Cas wraps himself around Dean tighter.
The pity from before is back in Charlie’s eyes. “Who did you say the things about? Him or yourself?”
Cas is a bit freaked out.
Bucky’s eyes turn grey and cloudy. “You’ve wanted to get married before. With Peggy.”
Fine. So if she finds me
It takes a long time before Cas answers. But when he does, he has the leather band clasped tightly in his hand and he meets Dean’s eyes and there’s even something like a small smile curling around the corners of his mouth.
“Nope,” Natasha says tightly, “that’s someone else altogether.”
Another half an hour later and they’re finally at Bobby’s place. Unsurprisingly, Sam’s car is already parked in the lot, next to Bobby’s old junkpile. Dean carefully maneuvers Baby next to it. He pets her steering wheel. “Remember this place? This is where we made you all nice and shiny again. You like it here.”
“Losing a soulmate is hard,” Charlie says quietly. “It’ll be hard even when it’s your decision to lose them.”
“I’ll give you cover.”
“Yeah,” Steve nods.
“Nat had a thing,” Bucky announces while he’s shoving one of the plates he’s carrying at Steve.
a hunter, and a damn good one to boot.”
in who I spend my life with!”
“Obviously,” Dean echoes sarcastically. As if they haven’t all been trying to get angelheart to respond and it’s never worked until today.
He sends Natasha a hard glare that is answered with equally harsh eyes.
“Yes, yes of course. Nice to meet you again,” Sam says quickly.
In response, Bucky squeezes Steve’s hand where he’s still holding it.
“Good. That’s good,” Dean sighs. “I know it seems abstruse when you’ve just met her but she’s - she can be pretty scary.”
For a heartbeat, Cas stares at him, anger flaming in his eyes. Then he pushes forward as well, yells it in Dean’s face, “Nothing, Dean. I know absolutely
“Cas, please. Not now,” Dean asks softly, looking up into cool blue eyes.
“You’re infuriating,” a dark gravelly voice suddenly says.
after all and yeah, Dean possibly chickened out of the word
She looks at him expectantly, so he nods dumbly, not sure what to say to this. She gave him his space? He fled, making sure she couldn’t find him, right?
“You’re talking of a unsanctioned Unsealing!” Cas sounds scandalized.
“Simpson,” Sam answers. “After Alan, not OJ.”
“Are you hungry?” Cas asks when they’re inside.
By the sympathetic look Charlie gives him, all his anguish he feels about his brother was splayed open in that. “I promise I’ll do my best,” she nods, before she hesitantly adds. “But please be aware - I was your Guardian, Dean.”
Dean growls and Sam shuts up.
because it sounds way weird to have a boyfriend and to have that boyfriend also be his best friend and an ex-angel on top.
Still, Dean’s steps get ever slower when he finally reaches their street. Their house looks peaceful, light blue color contrasting nicely with the white picket fence. Dean’s got a house with a white picket fence. And a spouse waiting for him inside. Sort of. It messes with his head, that’s what it does. In the darkness of the bunker, at least he gets reminded of who he really is. Here? Not so much.
“You can keep it if you want. You still have to face her again.”
It’s probably not a good idea to even think this way, but Steve thinks he could get to actually like the Winchesters, given enough time and some clearing up of intent on all sides. They might be valuable assets to have. He sighs. This is threat assessment, not a recruiting mission, and he doubts that Fury would be happy about having plaid-wearing, pie-baking hunters on his team anyway.
Dry humor seems to be Cas’ ammo against intrusive questions, and Dean is okay with it. It makes the situation less awkward. “Ah, but you are the one who said nothing untoward on a first date. I never said that I wanted you to keep your hands to yourself. So, are you? Single?”
"I said I'd ask. That's all."
“But…” It comes out before he’s had the time to think about it and he snaps his mouth shut. He can find another approach. Direct opposition is not it. Not when he’s supposed to be good.
That makes Dean huff and roll his eyes. “Figure of speech, Cas. We’ve talked about this. So, are you done with gardening?”
“You want me to want you.”
Dean snorts.
“So, uh, want to finish this up and go watch a movie?” Dean changes the topic.
What would his Dad think of Amara? Something along the lines of
“Her name is Charlie. I think the two of you will get along. I’ll ask her about taking you on when I see her at work today. I have the day off tomorrow, so if she has a free spot then, I can introduce you.”
It’s not an empty praise, either. Bucky’s actually taking much faster to modern life than Steve did. But it definitely doesn’t hurt saying it out loud, because Bucky suddenly has one of his rare smiles going and he’s ducking his head like he wants to hide a blush. “I’ll go make that lemonade,” he mumbles and is gone before Steve can say anything else.
His Dad’s words ring hollow in his ears. It’s been a long time since Dean was a kid confessing to a teacher that he’d fainted because he’s given the last few granola bars to Sam, but he can’t stop the feeling of guilt. He’s trying to do this by the books, and that means involving the Guardians. But yeah, he knows his Dad would have gone a different route.
That’s where the string of messages ends. Dean feels frantic just reading it. He types quickly.
They end up buying nothing but some Asian take out and that only at Steve’s insistence. But Steve’s not in the mood for trying his cooking skills tonight. Or Bucky’s for that matter. Though Bucky’s still too quick to acquiesce to Steve’s food choices. He doesn’t comment on it, though, at least not until they’re safely back home. Only then does he ask, “Can we talk about this, Buck?”
They haven’t addressed the kiss after it happened, so Steve has no idea what it means for them. Or how to start the conversation to find out. He has always relied on Bucky for that. Everything unspoken between them, if it was ever brought up, it had always been Bucky who found that courage. And so far, that holds true in the new age. Some things never change, it seems. Which all in all, is a comforting thought, even if it doesn’t help much.
“So you’re saying if I spent
“No,” Steve laughs dryly, “no, we haven’t.” He can’t help it, he reaches out the short span between them and squeezes Bucky’s hand. “I still mean it, though. You can count on me. Always.”
. But how can he say that? “Cas, you’re still my friend. You’ll always be my friend. We’re just -,” Boyfriends? Lovers? Partners?, “something more as well, okay?”
“Like what? Homemade lemonade?” Steve asks, shorter than he wants to be. But the 1940s vibe of the street is getting to him.
"You're shitting me. You're driving down here every weekend just to -" Dean gestures vaguely around them.
And maybe if he tells himself that another few thousand times it will stop feeling as horrible as it does.
“Gabriel talked of this,” Cas says quietly. “That he had met someone once, who had lost a – mate.” He can’t be sure of course, that Dean’s mom was that to Dean’s dad. But everything he’s told him about them so far seems to indicate it. “He said there was hardly anything left but grief.”
thing? We talked about it,” Dean reminds him. “As you can see, this ain’t the fanciest part of town, and Kaia’s folks are a ways away from your white upper middle-class community. And while I’m honestly pretty fucking sure that they don’t give a rat’s ass whether you approve of them, I’m also pretty damn certain that Claire does. So if you’ve got anything disparaging to get out of your system, do it right now and I will listen, but hold your peace when they’re back.”
“Okay. Okay.” Cas nods abruptly and turns on his heels to leave the room. “Gabriel? Yes, I can talk.” Then the door to the living room falls closed behind Cas.
“No, it won’t. He’s a friend of mine. He’s helped me out many times before. Yes. Yes, that’s perfect. We’ll do that.”
And okay, Dean gets that but it’s not really what he wants to know. “Yeah, but what about you? Do you want that? Or would you want to…?” He leaves the sentence open.
He’s thought about this before, of course he has and Cas has pretty much told him that he’d stand by him come hell or high water, and Dean’s pretty sure his brother would tell him the same thing, but - Dean rubs a hand over the bruises on his wrist. They still hurt.
“The Impala?” Claire’s eyes widen.
“You’re risking it by bringing us into town as well.”
“What?” Dean turns to face her.
Her eyes are warm but Cas can’t hold them. “I’m sorry,” he mumbles, because he knows that it is his fault that they’ve lost contact. He’s fucked so many friendships up over the years.
It’s Dean’s hand on his thigh, shaking him like he’s trying to wake him up, that makes him aware. His face is wetter than the light snowfall that’s set in again a few hours ago can account for.
“You’ve been there for me through so much, Cas,” Dean starts, his voice quiet. He doesn’t care if Charlie hears what he has to say but the words are for Cas. “I am so incredibly grateful for that, Cas. You are - you and Sam are the most important people in my life. And I never -,” He has to clear his throat. “I’d never
talk to her?"
“I know. And I want you there! It’s just...  I’d never forgive myself if something happened to you. So maybe you could, I don’t know, stay on the other side of the room or something?”
“Yeah,” Dean grins, never one to be shy when the compliments are about food he makes. “I come with perks.” He wiggles his eyebrows.
Steve rubs at his face. Nat being mysterious is giving him a headache. “Feel like sharing with the rest of the class?”
He shudders. Amara figuring out everything about his habits, about his friends, about every detail of his life feels bad. He’s been conditioned his whole life that you’re supposed to want to share yourself the minute your mark starts glowing, but to him it feels like a hunt. And he’s not the hunter. He’s the prey and she’s running him down.
“What?” Dean huffs. “I didn’t say…”
“A life-model decoy?” Steve interrupts her. “That’s expensive tech.”
Dean hums along to some song on the radio when Cas enters the kitchen.
“It’s going to make you sore for the first few days until you’re used to the horse. That’s not avoidable I fear.”
Since they took her car, Charlie has to bring them back home. It’s weird. It’s only been a few hours but so much has changed. Charlie seems to feel it, too, because she gets out of the car to hug Dean goodbye. She holds on tight. “We’re going to get through this, okay? Just don’t do anything stupid until we get there, alright? We have a plan to follow now.”
“Why?” Dean asks.
“Thank you, Dean. You’ll like him, you’ll see.”
“Yep,” she nods. “But after you’re showered and smell better. Judging by this,” she points at their blankets that they haven’t had the chance to clear away yet, “you don’t really need the guest room, right? Care to clear your shit out, Bucky, and stow it with Steve’s so that I can move in?”
Dean stares at the messages for a moment. Cas sounds - formal. Timid. It weirds him out. Cas is a lot of things, but mostly those are things like blunt and to the point. Or, if you look at them in a more negative light, a little arrogant and harsh. He isn’t - timid.
“Since you’re asking so nicely,” Gabriel rolls his eyes. “Follow me.”
Progress.
It is easier to walk back to the car than it was walking to the house. Cas still keeps an arm around him though instead of holding him up he now has a hand on the small of Dean’s back, guiding him forward. Not that Dean is complaining about it.
“Dean!” Jess gasps. “Don’t even think that! That’s not true! You deserve to be loved just as much as anyone else!”
And for all of his soldier of God deal, Cas is a frikking innocent in this regard. The very few sexual encounters he’s had over the time Dean has known him being a point in case. They all exploited Cas’ innocence. And Dean will be damned if he lets that happen again.
It’s impossible to miss the way Dean blanches when she mentions Sam, he’s sure of that. But Amara merely holds his gaze, her teeth a pearly white where they shine between her lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And now
Cas huffs. “I mean what I say. I always mean it.”
“Hey, I’m gonna die in a few days, I don’t think the pizza will manage to give me a heart-attack before then.”
Cas’ answer hurts more than Dean cares to admit, so he defaults back to anger. “I do what all the time? Drunk text you at 3am? Cause I don’t think so.”
“Apparently the number belongs to a telemarketing company. The lady immediately started to try selling me shit. Took a while to get rid of her,” Sam elaborates.
“That I might have to wait a very long time. I already know that, Cas. It doesn’t scare me. This is worth the the wait.
Cas doesn't hesitate. “Everyone is unique, Dean.”
And yeah, Cas must be meeting these people in his profession. No wonder that he’s passionate about this. “I know, Cas,” Dean soothes. “I know. I didn’t mean any offense. It’s just that I didn’t expect it, you know? The mark’s been there for so many years, waiting. Kind of killed my life plans a little when the whole thing went bust.”
Cas relents, holding his phone out to Dean with the contacts open. Dean quickly types the number into his own phone and sends it to Sam.
Gabe’s wearing a smile on it, Cas doesn’t. On the surface, it looks like Cas is the one who’s haunted. But if you look closer, you can see it. How both of their eyes are hollow, and how there’s a strain in Gabe’s smile. How it never reaches his eyes.
“Captain Rogers, can I have a word with you?”
“Yes, he does.”
“As long as they’re not your soulmate,” Cas deadpans.
“Dean.” This time, it sounds sympathetic. “Oh Dean.”
“That’s it, I am going over there,” he decides. “Are you coming?”
“Dean.” For a moment, Cas seems speechless. But then his expression changes, turns thunderous and determined. “I won’t let you. Charlie, I won’t let him.”
“Yes,” Cas smiles.
and Dean’s totally okay with that. At least someone here remembers whose boyfriend is whose.
Dean doesn’t think anything of it until he turns back to find a pen and paper to write down what he needs and sees the steep frown on Cas’ face. He stills. “What’s wrong, Cas?”
Dean doesn’t answer, maybe doesn’t know what to answer, but his arms come up in a protective circle around Cas, holding him close like there was someone who wanted to hurt Cas right this second.
Cas rolls his eyes. “Don’t be dense, Dean. I’m merely trying to figure this out.”
The small task doesn’t take long to accomplish and all of sudden Dean is draped all over Cas without an excuse as to why. Which means he should step back. He should step back right now. But somehow, even while his mind screams at him to stop, he sinks his head into the tuft of Cas’ hair, pressing a quick kiss to the back of his head and enjoying the mixture of their shampoo and the flour that Cas’ hair smells like.
“And - Gilda and Dorothy aren’t…?”
“Left from where we’re standing?”
Cas averts his eyes like he’s averted them for the past decade. The fact that he’s come here to change that somehow doesn’t translate into actually being able to face Gabe’s fake smile.
It blinks menacingly at him.
“Just live a good life, Dean. Okay? That makes it worth it.”
“You’ll get your clothes dirty,” he says lamely, because it’s the only thing that comes to mind.
“I didn’t,” Steve insists. He just hadn’t really wanted to live, either. “I took what I deemed to be the safest route for the world.”
“I got bored. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m the only one who’s not got anyone to make heart-eyes at.”
“Hey! That was definitely her fault, not mine!” Dean complains, but he embraces Ellen in a hug as well.
,” Dean insists. “I’m so happy for you and Jess, man. I’m just, I didn’t expect this. Like, I didn’t even know you were trying.”
The concept needs a moment to sink in.
“Uh-uh,” Dean shakes his head though he softens his voice. “Cas, have you been thinking about kissing me?”
Cas nods. “Yes. Being a Guardian, it was too inflexible a structure for him. Now he has - contacts. For the kind of support that he couldn’t give as a Guardian. And the cafe makes him happy. That’s worth a lot.”
“That, I don’t know,” Sam says.
“No, he is not. Chuck, we require your help.”
“I didn’t know that. I’m sorry.”
And fuck, that was a pretty explicit answer to that question, wasn’t it? Dean swallows heavily and presses the handkerchief harder to his forehead just to counteract the clenching in his stomach. “Three guys cornered my little sister. And before you say it, yeah, it’s pretty damn stupid to take three guys on on my own. But she’s my little sister, man.” Or as close to a little sister as he’s ever going to have.
“Yeah. Nothing much to do other than wait right now.”
“Is she going to interrogate me?” Dean asks to cover his feelings. He only halfway means it as a joke, anyway. Of course there’s another possibility, too. “Or are you going to introduce me as
“Alright,” she nods. “You know that this is true for many of us, and it is true for me, too. I have blood family outside of this pack. And if I’m not very mistaken, Dean is leading us right to where they live.”
And yeah, this might be a Bucky who doesn’t remember the old days, but Steve knows that tone well. “Buck,” Steve shakes his head, “how am I supposed to know? Maybe. If there had been a way to stay close to you.”
Dean shrugs, playing it off casually. “Wasn’t all that exciting until yesterday when he told me about being Claire’s father.”
“Yup.”
“So, you talked about marriage, huh?” He says quietly, and feels a little faint at the word.
this story and will be updating regularly for the next few weeks until the story is complete. Enjoy! <3.
“Cas, do you think it’s possible to bless garden hose water?”
“Does that mean you – do you not want to be
Maybe some fresh air will clear his mind, running has always helped with that. And as soon as he’s decided that, he feels better. There is something he actually can do right now. Something that makes him stop thinking. At least for some time.
He has notifications.
Well, at least if anyone tries to rob him, they’ll be in for a disappointment, he thinks in an attempt at gallows’ humor. Of course, if someone attempts to rob him and they get angry because Dean doesn’t have anything of value on him, that’ll probably be worse. Dean’s in no position to defend himself.
Too close, too close to home. Too close to those words, to his feelings, too close.
Dean shrugs. He doesn’t always like who he is but he’s got enough people calling him out on his bullshit that being honest with himself has become habit. “Yeah, I kind of know who I am. I kind of know what I want, too.” He takes an ostentatious sip from his coke bottle, knowing that Cas will get what he means.
“Please, Cas. I can’t. I can’t contemplate
“You do?” Cas asks confused.
“Alright. Then get ready for bed. I’ll go get you another aspirin and some water.”
“Oh darling.” She pats his hand that has somehow found its way onto the table again. Dean is sure he hadn’t allowed his hand to do that. “I understand that your things have sentimental value to you but when you see the place, you’ll understand why they won’t fit our common life. It’s okay. I have the money. We’ll get you a new wardrobe, make you a bit more - presentable. It’ll be fun.”
Bucky shrugs and plants himself on the floor next to Steve’s knees. “You know her. She got a thing, I don’t ask.”
That should be enough for Sam to do a full background sweep. “Good. If there is something fishy, Sam will find it.”
“Hello, handsome stranger, what can I bring you?”
“Yeah?”
“Cut the crap. Where do we need to go?”
Dean looks over to Cas then, who also automatically takes a step back. Yeah, he trusts Dean, but angry Alpha is to be avoided, no matter who that Alpha is. Of course, the moment Dean sees the tinge of fear on Cas’ face, his posture changes. Dean closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. When he opens his eyes again, the harsh glow is gone. He turns back to Sam.
Dean freezes “What?”
“Wait, what was that?” he asks.
“And you,” Dean turns to Claire, “pancake batter. Make it a generous portion. They’re gonna steal.”
Which, for all his mother’s faults, grates. That he’s been such a disappointment to her, that she’d never even come looking when after college he’d moved out of the dorms and didn’t give her his new address or phone number. He didn’t even move out of town, though. She would have found him, had she tried.
Because they’ve agreed that if this is Dean’s suicide, Cas can’t be seen leaving the house with him. So he’s going to go have dinner with his brother. Very visibly in his cafe, where they’ll talk very publicly about how Cas is going to help Gabe with bookkeeping that night, before they’ll clandestinely make their way to whatever location Rowena has chosen, at around the same time as Dean. Gabe’s going to give them the address for said location, and he and Cas will take Dean’s overnight bag with them, to be safely stowed in the car purchased solely for the purpose of driving down to Cali.
He retches until there’s only bile coming up.
She cocks her head at him. “About what?”
Claire shrugs. “He was just an old dog.” She gives it a harsh spin that doesn’t even begin to cover the heartbreak.
“Boys,” Natasha says calmly. “Play nice.” Then she turns to Dean. “Should we sit out on the terrace? The weather is nice for that today.”
That makes sense to Cas, so he nods, though he isn’t sure the motion is visible to Dean.
When Cas comes in a couple of minutes later, holding a stack of towels with a toothbrush on top, Dean is still looking at the pictures. “Did you make these?”
“Congrats, guys. Really. I was giving up hope. I’m glad I was wrong.”
“No,” Dean shakes his head. “I hate waiting.”
Had. Had a brother.
I'm definitely posting faster than I'm writing, but I can keep the weekly updates up for a while longer. <3
“And have I led you astray yet?”
He has no way of actually making good on this promise. He knows it. But he has to give it anyway. Has to give words to what is in his heart.
“Dean? Look at me.” Amara’s voice holds that slight edge again and Dean couldn’t stop himself if he wanted. He looks up at her. “I’m glad that you came around and we can leave the unpleasantness of our last meeting behind. I feel like we need to talk about it, though, so that there are no hard feelings. Don’t you agree?”
“I never wanted to hold him back,” Dean whispers, his voice not cooperating.
lead the way?” he amends.
“The thing is, there’s been something. From the first moment that you walked into my life, there’s been, I dunno - something. A spark. And in the beginning I told myself that it’s just because you’re hot, you know? That it was - lust, I guess. But then we became friends, so I expected it to go away. Cause you know, you don’t creep on your best friend. But the better I got to know you, the harder it got to bullshit myself. Cause what I felt for you was never just - it was never just about wanting your body, Cas. It was always about you.”
“You’ve lost each other before, too,” Steve states, more out of habit than because it’s still a question.
in the middle of his living room, prime access to snooping around his life.
“No, I haven’t,” Charlie denies the accusation. “Though I do have an outstanding Lara Croft cosplay, if I dare say so myself. But no, Angelina is
“I’m pretty sure he doesn’t expect one.”
was always Dean’s dad and he’d rather not. “Thank you for inviting me.”
But Dean stops in the living room. “I can sleep on the couch, Cas. It looks comfortable enough.”
“No kidding,” Dean mutters, but somehow his other hand is scratching Simpson’s other ear now and he has to brace himself on his knees because the dog is pushing into him with his whole weight.
Dean snorts. “That does not sound like me.”
“Sorry,” Sam shrugs. “I wish I had better news but I don’t. Legally, there isn’t much you can do on your own.”
“Time to learn new things, then,” Bucky says and the determined look on his face is the same the tackles a new weapon with.
“Does that mean
So he chooses a dark green and starts drawing.
“Alright, alright, Sam texted me. Happy now?”
“Penny for your thoughts?” Cas asks.
It is both true and untrue in too many ways for Cas to have the words to describe. True, because he’s seen the relief on all of their faces and suffered their enthusiastic hugs when he came back. Untrue, because he sees the shadow of fear on Sam’s face whenever he observes them together while believing himself unobserved. True, because Cas has learned enough to pull his weight in the pack. Untrue, because he’s still an additional mouth to feed. True, because Dean seems genuinely happy whenever Cas is near him. Untrue, because without his intention, Cas has changed their routines and schedules enough that they won’t make it to their winter route.
He beelines to the kitchen to get himself a glass of whiskey. One, no more, he promises himself. He takes his phone out of his pocket and swipes to the recent photos. There are half a dozen pictures of Cas, with his mouth stuffed full of burger but obviously trying to smile for the camera, then coughing when something had gone down the wrong pipe, and finally laughing about the mishap. His laugh is quieter than Dean’s, more conscious of his surroundings, but Dean finds it infectious anyway.
“He is?” Steve asks surprised. He didn’t think the guy in the suit would be into gardening. “Did you talk to him?”
“Bucky!!” Steve rounds in on him, grabbing his non-metal arm for emphasis.
“So, did you two meet in the military?” Steve finally asks in an effort to include Dean in their conversation.
“Awesome,” Dean mutters, aware that absolutely nothing about this situation is awesome. “Lead the way then.”
“What?” Dean asks, taken aback.
He sends it before he can think about it too long because his stomach is tying itself into knots already. He doesn’t think Cas’ affection is based on Dean’s submission. It plays a role, yes, but Dean’s never thought that Cas doesn’t value him as a person beyond that dynamic.
Dean’s face heats up and he’s glad that the ping of the microwave saves him from having to explain himself. Because yeah, that was kind of what he had wanted to know. “And they - they don’t feel like, like it’s less than what they have with you?” He talks to the microwave because there’s no way he’s going to get these words out while looking at Charlie.
“My partner.” Cas tilts his head like he’s mulling the word over. “My life partner.” He emphasizes the
“No, man, I’m fine,” Dean says but the way his whole body falls back against the wall when he tries to get up somewhat belies his words.
“Well, it isn’t exactly hidden. But if I was you, I’d have turned off anon comments like ten minutes ago.”
“Like vampires?” Dean asks.
“Watch me,” he says as he walks out of the living room, grabbing his jacket before he leaves the house, leaving Cas and everything that is unsaid behind.
Dean really doesn’t but there’s something so hopeful in Cas’ voice that he holds out his whole apron to Cas. “Sure. That’s what you got an assistant for in the kitchen after all.”
Cas seems to notice Dean's bewildered look, because he abruptly shuts up and takes a deep breath. “I’ve only ever seen her from a distance, Dean,” Cas says softly. “I wouldn’t know whether she’s in trouble.”
He says it with such apprehension that Steve can’t help asking, “Everything okay between you two?” So far, they have seen their neighbors argue more often than not.
Abuse victims. That’s who. He rips himself out from under her touch after all. “‘S not like that.”
“Oh, thank God,” Dean sighs a breath of relief.
“Yes,” Cas nods.
“Dean…,” Cas starts but Dean cuts him off.
given Cas the money for an out-of-state college. Where she couldn’t control what he was doing - or more to the point, who he was doing. He guesses it’s the most remorse anyone had ever gotten from her.
Dean feels himself blushing furiously, because fucking hell, now his brain is providing him with images of the redhead plus Bucky and after the beer bottle incident that is not a direction that his thoughts should be going in and fuck, he needs to get out of this situation before he embarrasses himself. Judging by the way his pants feel tighter than they did, he’s on a speed train towards embarrassing, and really, fuck his stupid brain for being inappropriate. “I.. umm… I… my boyfriend is waiting…”
Immediately, Dean sits up. His own worries and the seal that’s about to be broken had taken a backseat in his mind last night, thoughts about Cas so much more prominent, but now all his anxiety floods back.
“Flighty and somewhat commitment shy,” Charlie replies soberly. “But such good kissers!” The somber tone changes into a dreamy sigh.
Dean chuckles. “Yeah, about the same reaction I had when he told me who he was.”
Cas tries to push the feather back into Dean’s hand but all Dean does is close his own fingers around Cas’, encircling both him and the amulet.
“You don’t have to tell me,” Dean can practically hear Sam’s eye-roll and he is about to tell him what he thinks about this when he hears it. It’s a small sound but distinct, even though it’s a little bit muffled.
“Sorry,” Dean clears his throat. “I’m kinda - this is awful timing of course. Putting all that bullshit on you and then -” He breaks off, rubs his hands over his face in frustration and starts anew. “Cas, I - I like you. A lot. And I wasn’t gonna say anything, because you were straight and because I’m - I got so much baggage, Cas, and I have no idea whether I’m even capable of trusting again and that’s a lot to put on you and…” He tapers off under Cas’ earnest stare. “You get what I’m saying?”
“Ah, but the morning has always been just for us,” Sam smiles. “It’s about the past more than the future and that’s okay. We survived a lot. Taking a morning to remember it and to see how far we have come is healthy, I think.”
“That should suffice,” Cas says gravely.
“Okay. Okay, Cas, come on. Let’s get to the couch.”
He’s not sure whether it makes things better or worse when Cas is already in bed, huddled under the blankets and looking just as nervous as Dean feels.
That’s a memory.
“Right, punk. Nice try. Still a bad liar. Try again.”
“No, Dean. You brought it up as an argument for giving yourself up - why, Dean? Why use it for that?”
Dean doesn’t talk on the drive back to Cas’ place. Cas keeps shooting him glances and Dean notices them but he just can’t. There aren’t any words for the way it feels like his ribcage is being spread open from the inside out. Like he’s falling into a black hole and not even the darkness grants comfort. He wants to drink until he’s forgotten absolutely everything about this night and at the same time he still feels the phantom hug where his brother had wrapped his long limbs around him for just a second in goodbye. He had seen it in Sammy’s face, how it had worried him that Dean hadn’t fought him off. That in fact, he had held him tighter and refused to let go for another few heartbeats. It had drawn together Sam’s eyes in a frown, but in typical Winchester fashion he hadn’t said anything. Dean’s still not sure whether he’s thankful for that. He thinks if Sam had pushed enough, he might have told him. Probably to the detriment of them all, but maybe the hole in his chest wouldn’t be quite so big then.
“Yes, the kiss! It was for show, wasn’t it?” Dean asks again, covering up his anxiety with exasperation as best as he can.
Cas’ smile falters somewhere in the middle of the speech, and yeah, Dean guesses this isn’t Cas’ ideal option, either.
“They did,” Hannah agrees. “Actually, I think, in middle school you made teachers color-code their scripts at least twice, too. It was important to you.”
Steve is content learning to read Bucky instead of trying to figure out what Nat is doing, but he guesses you can only stare so long before you count as a creep. So he mobilizes his technical knowledge and manages to snap a picture of Nat and Bucky hunched over the computer. And that would probably still be kind of creepy if it wasn’t for the fact that his two favorite spies and assassins of course completely notice that he’s snapping a picture.
She hits play before he’s even got the remote in his hands again. “Unfair!” He scrambles to catch up.
“Well, you’re a bit more than that. On account of you being a person and all. But yeah, that’s the general gist of it.” He tries his best to smile back. Sam’s not going to expect him to be in a stellar mood but Dean can’t let him get too worried.
It gets him a predictable frown from Cas.
“There something I should know about, boy?”
“No, seriously, Cas, it’s not that I – but I’m pretty banged up.”
“No,” Charlie shakes her head. “I want to know what is wrong.”
That brings Dean up short. Both because he hadn’t thought about it that way - and oh, he’s sure Amara would have gone all the way if he had given her half a chance - and because of the
“Yeah, okay, point,” Charlie allows. “What about Victor then? He might not be as straight as he seems.”
“Let him go!” Cas is next to him in a heartbeat, shouldering his way between them.
“I know, lover boy.”
Which is how they end up with slightly burned burgers. It’s not too bad, the burgers still taste fine, but they are not perfect and Dean can’t help his scowl, even when Steve praises his burgers and asks for the recipe.
Bucky shoots him an insecure look, obviously torn between doing as he’s told and asking what the hell is going on.
“The really interesting thing isn’t even where the call located from. It’s how they traced it. And we got that.”
And then the pic comes through.
Dean is glad for it. He’s had enough people telling him that he disgusts them, he doesn’t need Cas directly in his space when he tells this story.
“Well, they’re not the keys to the neighbors’ house.” But when he sees Dean’s expression, he softens his words. “Yes, Dean, I do. It might be hard to believe but I actually like having you around.”
him?” There’s an edge to Amara’s voice and a dangerous sparkle in her eyes.
“Yeah, why’d you do that anyway?” Bucky asks, eyes narrowing.
“Cas! Cas!” Dean grabs his hands and makes another attempt to get through to him. “You haven’t lost me! I’m right here, okay? You haven’t ever lost me!”
“You can always do the dishes,” Bucky shrugs.
The determination in his voice leaves no room for argument, so Dean accepts it and scoots over while Cas sets his alarm and turns off the light. Then he draws Dean in, until Dean’s back is flush against his chest. It’s been years since Dean’s been the little spoon.
And that sounds almost honestly confused. Which, probably not Sam. Sam would have gone for witty.
“Hey there,” Rowena protests. “I’ve never
“I’m aware,” Dean grinds out between his teeth while trying to race down the homestretch. Of course that’s when Princess Peach sends him a red shell. “Goddammit,” he grumbles when three more carts drive by him before he makes it over the goal line.
Dean crushes his lips onto Cas’, a hard, angry kiss that has them both staggering, now in the opposite direction, until Cas’ knees hit the bed and he stumbles. His hands come up to fist into Dean’s shirt and then he’s drawing Dean down with him, Dean landing on top of Cas, barely managing to catch his own weight on the mattress not on Cas’ sternum. But Cas will have none of that, instead he’s digging his fingers into Dean’s back, not allowing him to retreat even an inch.
He’s got the urge to apologize again, though he isn’t really sure for what this time. The other billion times that Cas was fed up with him were clearer that way.
“Peggy. Peggy Carter.”
“Well, he said he was in the military,” Dean points out.
But then, it sounds like Cas’ wounds have already been ripped open.
“I feel you,” Dean nods because he’s looking at the same fate. Only, Dean had a seal and he had plans and everything and for Cas that’s different. “So, uhh, are you okay with that? Or would you, you know, want it differently?”
to lose you, Cas. Never. You gotta believe that. But I’ve thought about it, about this whole insane plan and - Cas,” he touches Cas’ arm after all, if only for a short moment, and he even tries for a small smile, “it ain’t gonna work. It’s going to endanger all of us, and for what? Just so that I can spite the universe? Just so that I can - no, Cas, it’s not worth it. The universe has decided that Amara is my soulmate and I’m hers. That’s God’s plan for us, right? We learn it from kindergarten on. Every soul was split in two and one day you’ll find your other half. Or maybe not every soul,” Dean amends in light of what he’s recently learned about Cas, “but most of them. Mine included. So this is it. Amara is my other half. I don’t like it any better than you do, believe me. But I shouldn’t - I shouldn’t be fighting it. I should accept it like we’re meant to do.” He looks at Cas and wills him to understand.
His face flushes again, in shame this time, because Dean is one of these people as well. And for months and months on end, Cas has shut him out. Has pretended to be alone when Dean had always been by his side. Has seen him as a burden even, when Dean was what kept him stable. He sees that now.
Dean shudders at the memory. Even with the overwhelming feeling of their bond forming, the words had registered. It had taken a little longer for the warning bells to turn into screeching sirens, but those first sentences really said it all.
Sam chuckles and a moment later Dean’s phone beeps and he’s got his first official photo of them as a couple.
Dean takes another sip of his drink and lets her get it out of her system. When she’s calmed down, she leans in close, waving Sam off when he looks at them curiously. “I swear he’s thinking about tying you up and spanking you until he’s not irritated at himself anymore.”
The bite Dean had been chewing turns to ashes in his mouth. He swallows it with effort. “As involved as I can be,” he repeats, voice toneless.
Cas waves a dismissive hand. “I cancelled. Hannah can do this alone. I called her right after you texted. This is more important.”
An apple pie life. That’s what they call it. And this is the closest he will ever get to it. So he stays for another moment without moving. Watches Cas absentmindedly reaching for his coffee, too engrossed in the newspaper to even look up. He gives himself this one moment to dwell on the illusion. To fill his heart with it so that he can look at it again on dark days. So that he keeps the memory safe for the rest of his life.
“Buck,” Steve admonishes, even though, in a way that was what he had been asking. They have enough issues between them without adding alcohol to the mix. Though he isn’t even sure whether Bucky can get any more drunk than Steve.
But Dean isn’t upset. He pushes a wet lock out of his face and blinks up at Cas against the rain that’s started up again. “You will. You’ll figure it out.”
“I feel like Linus,” Dean grumbles silently.
Sam sighs deeply before he says, “Take care of yourself and look after Cas, okay?”
Cas nods like it’s the most normal thing in the world. “I’ll text Gabriel to set up the meeting.”
“Sometimes I think that your judgement is more impaired sober than when drunk,” Cas shakes his head.
Cas self-consciously pats at his tie and turns it, just for it to immediately flip over again. “Ties and me don’t seem to agree,” he finally shrugs and then with a glance in Dean’s direction, “At least not this way.”
Cas working so closely by his side doesn’t make it easier. It’s when Cas accidentally brushes against him when he puts a plate away that Dean finally breaks. “It was for show, wasn’t it?”
The message ends abruptly and then a picture is loading. Dean’s heart immediately thumps in his chest. Either it’s going to be a picture of Gabe’s butt or - can it be? Can it be that this is actually angelheart and Dean will be the first and only person online to see their picture?
“And you told them No!” Cas argues.
“But I’m not.”
“Uh oh, outed.”
“Cas, I…,” Dean shakes his head. “What?” he asks helplessly.
“Dean, that’s not actually good back-up…” Sam says but Cas interrupts him.
and he says it’s good,” Bucky shrugs. He’s leaning against the wall, whole body one relaxed long line, but he’s holding out the beer with his metal arm and there’s a challenge gleaming in his eyes.
“Actually, things seem to be clearing up a bit,” Nat replies.
“Very,” Cas answers with emphasis.
“That’s more
“The kiss?”
Holding Bucky’s hand produces the kind of static in Steve’s brain that makes it hard to inconspicuously follow their targets. Hell, it makes it hard to walk without tripping over his own feet. Because that’s Bucky’s hand in his and yeah, they’re not a real couple, this is a spy thing, but that doesn’t change that Bucky’s skin is warm and that he grips tight and that it feels real. And as such, it feels exactly like something he’s wanted to do since the 40s and never thought he’d get a chance to. Not like this, anyway. Not openly in a shopping mall on a random day, like it is the most normal thing in the world to hold the hand of someone you love. Even if that someone happens to be a guy when you are a guy, too.
“Okay,” Dean agrees again, though somehow that part of it had escaped him right up until now. That they’d have to choose a room and a bed. That Cas is actually inviting him to stay in his bed for the night. And because he’s Dean Winchester, he swallows heavily and, under the guise of changing into his PJs, flees to the security of the guest room.
“Not that unique. Wait until this afternoon.” Dean turns towards the back where the girls are just climbing in. “Heya Kaia, how are you? Ready for a Winchester family trip?”
Dean hadn’t even really thought that far yet. His world is still crashing a little bit around him.
And that doesn’t sound good. “What did you do?” Steve demands.
“Life isn’t fair, Luigi.”
“Dammit, Dean, stop it. I can’t concentrate.”
“What?”
Steve’s pretty sure that if he had to bet, he’d have betted that no one would survive that, not even Clint. By the way Bucky stares at the proceedings, he’s probably thinking the same. But Nat just shakes her head and pats Charlie on the back.
“I haven’t been okay for a long time, Dean,” Cas answers softly.
Without having to keep an eye on the road, Castiel can level him with a stare again and he immediately does. “I’m sure. Also, I have a name so you might as well use it instead of calling me ‘man’.” He waits for Dean to nod before adding. “Stay where you are. I don’t want you to topple to the ground and hurt yourself more.”
Dean grimaces. “Guess I don’t have much choice.” But then, that’s not quite true, either. It’s just that all of the choices Dean has are pretty sucky. And in comparison, the one they’re going with is definitely the best. “I’m glad, you know. That you’re doing this with me. That I don’t gotta do it alone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?”
. “Thanks, Cas. For being there for me. Even though I fear that your place isn’t safe anymore now, either.”
“Dude, that’s so last century. Last millennium, actually.”
“The Roadhouse?”
By now, Steve’s probably been staring at Bucky for too long, so he rips his eyes away and looks right into the biggest shit-eating grin he’s ever seen. “I knew it!” Charlie whoops. “I need a picture of this to send to my high school history teacher. Stuck-up fossil gave my an F for my essay on Captain America being the bisexual hero that America needs.”
Buying sheets is more complicated than it sounds.
“Do you know what happened? I mean, he was out of the picture for half a decade.”
Bucky snorts, a sound that fits much better with the boy he had known in Brooklyn than with the Winter Soldier. “You’re an idiot, Steve.”
“I - of course not.”
“Significant other. I was gonna say significant other,” Deans sighs. “But yeah, the other thing, too. I’m gonna try to be, you know, just someone who cares about him and wants him to be okay. Cause I do, you know. Care about him.”
“I know,” Dean nods.
“I’m sorry, Dean.”
“Want to get rid of me already?” Dean asks and it’s only half-jokingly.
“What the hell?” Dean growls. “Someone’s trying to break in. What do I do? Turn the notebook off? Take out the battery?”
Dean frowns at Cas because that doesn’t make much sense to him.
“Yeah,” Steve nods. “Yeah, she knew about you. Not that I’d ever told her. But she was smart. She figured it out.”
“Yeah, okay,” Dean grinds out.
He swallows heavily. He doesn’t think he’s ever discussed his heats with anyone. Let alone with an Alpha, and one who has so far not even touched Cas in those places. Not that Cas has ever before known an Alpha who didn't immediately touch and instead wanted to talk to him like Dean does.
! Just temporarily! Does no one ever listen to me?” Rowena exclaims in mock exasperation.
“It’s all good, old man,” Nat pats him on the back. “They’re hunters, that’s all.”
It’s tall guy who saves them. He rolls his eyes at the other two and shoulders his way past them. “Chill, dudes,” he says to his companions and turns to Steve, stretching out a hand for him to take. “You got to excuse them, they’re not always this rude. They just have their preconceived notions about suburbia. Which I’m sure your new neighbors don’t share,” he adds with a hard glare towards his friends.
“He died. Scooter. The year after you left,” Claire spits.
He has failed him in life, he is failing him again now. Every time he turns around, every time he can’t make himself go through this gate, every time his mind conjures up the image of a pale unmoving corpse instead of the picture of his brother.
“There’s two cats that stayed. They have their own free will, though. They’re used to being independent. They stay outside.”
“Now, tell me, where have you been all these years?“ Hannah asks.
They both flinch but it still takes a moment to rein in the kiss.
“Well, at least they stuck around.”
By the end of it, they are hungry, though, for something more substantial than sandwiches, so Cas produces a few take out menus and they order some fried rice from an Asian place and settle back in for a rewatch of Rogue One.
So Bucky’s done his homework. Steve nods, pleased even though it’s still a soldier thing, being prepared at all times, not a thing that is genuinely Bucky. But it’s better than just waiting for orders like he’s done in the beginning. “Inhuman, radiation, no one knows. All SHIELD’s figured out is that there’s something off about the guy. Hence, us.”
“Dammit Cas!”
Dean finishes his burger while Cas plays with his last few fries.
“Tell Garth to take over.”
“We don’t have to do this. If it really makes you this upset, we can walk.”
"You've not been around much of what they call
That shuts Dean up. Because yes, Cas is his rock, but the other way round? Cas has Hannah and Charlie and Gabriel and he’s a Guardian and - and it feels good what Charlie just said. So Dean lets himself smile. “Cas is pretty cool,” he admits quietly.
And that makes Dean snort a real laugh. “Thanks for not wearing a mushroom hat.”
“Dude, the fact that you’re getting defensive says more about you than it say about me, you know that, right?”
“Ex-SHIELD. Been underground for a while, but no signs of working against us. We parted amiably.”
“How are you, umm, how are you managing it? The whole...” he gestures vaguely.
“Cas, you can’t just…” Dean catches his hand. He doesn’t want to but he can’t help staring at the pattern on Cas’ wrist. “Ink? Really?”
A smile plays around Dean’s lips at the desperate way that word gets said. “That, she is. She was how old when you last saw her? 9? 10? Of course she’s not that kid anymore. She’s mostly grown now. And she’s had to fight for herself a lot.”
“Uh-uh,” Dean grabs his arm and keeps him in place. “Even if what, Cas?” He lets go of him once he’s repeated his question. If Cas really doesn’t want to answer, well, Dean guesses that he’ll die without an answer then. Literally.
“And you’re competitive,” Charlie smirks. “Though not as competitive as I am!”
“Are you sure this warrants you coming here, Sam?” Cas pipes up. And is this Cas trying to say he’d rather spend some more time alone with Dean?
Long enough that Bucky looks up after all, fear now plain in his eyes. He goes on, though, and mumbles, “I think I still do, Steve. Even though I’m not that Bucky anymore. I think I still love you.”
“Yeah?” Dean stutters.
“Whatcha doing here, man?” Dean asks, much gruffer than he feels, and pours a beer for Castiel without asking.
And okay, in terms of wheedling information out of Cas, that is probably anything but subtle. Cas seems to actually think about it for a moment, though, because he does the head tilt before he answers. “Well, if you must know, I find Chris Evans quite aesthetically pleasing.”
“I am in Lawrence… in the…” Dean can hear rustling and a short huff before Cas says, “Angel Heart motel, room 401.”
Dean splutters somewhat indignantly which, he is very well aware, is not helping his case at all. “Traitor,” he mumbles towards the sky in the general direction of where his brother’s apartment is.
“Dean,” Cas’ hand is immediately on his back, warm and soothing.
He startles a laugh from Cas’ lips which is better than expected. In fact, Dean feels better than he would have expected, too.
He smirks. “Was that you admitting that you think he loves me?”
“Dean, do you want to solve this case or not?” Sam bitches and Dean rolls his eyes.
Their talk by the horses comes back to Cas, where Dean had used almost the same words. Back then, Cas hadn’t understood. Now that he does, he isn’t sure whether that makes anything better. It definitely doesn’t make anything easier.
“I really have three soulmates, who all have more than one soulmate as well,” Charlie nods. “So, we’re both freaks who’re faking our way through the agency, huh? No wonder that I instantly liked you.” She nudges Cas’ shoulder.
“Huh.” He had forgotten that. “They did it, too, didn’t they?”
"Doesn't he have anyone else to celebrate with?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Charlie hums her understanding. “Make it a good pity party at least?”
From his old wallet, he only takes part of the cash, which isn’t much to begin with, and the crinkled childhood photograph of Sam. He’s pretty sure that there aren’t many people who know that the photo was in there in the first place, so it won’t arouse any suspicions if it’s missing even if the wallet doesn’t burn up. He carefully smoothes the photo down into the side pocket of the bag he’s taking.
Ridiculous. Ridiculous to have hope. But his heart beats faster just thinking about it.
Thirty seconds later, Charlie breathes an awed “whoa”.
“It’ll be impossible to keep the charade up, I know,” Dean interrupts harshly. Because while the bunker is spacious, they’re living pretty closely together. And Sam is always there. Dean takes a deep breath to calm his voice and starts anew. “I know, Cas. I know we can’t be this and keep it a secret.”
If he thinks they can be someone good for each other after all.
“You can do this,” Cas repeats, and Dean thinks it would be more appropriate to wish him good luck, but he doesn’t disagree and moves forward.
Steve grumbles under his breath, because he’s got no idea about this and it’s Nat’s own fault if the cables end up in the wrong boxes.
It’s Dean’s turn to raise his eyebrows at her. Charlie shrugs, completely at ease with what she’s just said.
“Well, Sam’s a nerd,” Dean grumbles, even though the one doesn’t necessarily have to do with the other.
“I would love to meet her,” Cas replies. “I’ll be on my best behaviour.”
It’s that thought that makes him open his eyes. Because holy shit, he’s in Cas’ bed and Cas is wrapped around him and Cas’ hand is definitely not on top of Dean’s clothes but underneath them and Cas’ shirt has ridden up and there’s naked Cas-tummy, and all of this felt completely natural a second ago but they haven’t actually ever done this before.
“Missouri is not against it.” It comes out louder than planned, Cas’ face feeling even more on fire. “Missouri is not against it,” he repeats in a quieter voice. “And I think she would know. If there was danger.”
"Yeah, okay, I'll grant you that. So, do you like the new job?" Dean tries to give the topic a shift into an easier direction.
“You’re killing me, girl.” Dean rubs a hand over his face, though mainly to keep Claire from noticing his smile. He’s supposed to be upset at her antics after all. But she’s right, it
But it doesn’t work. They’ve been hacked and Sam is coming over and sitting here makes Dean feel useless. But if he’s useless, he’s worthless and that means he has no right to enjoy sitting here with Cas’ arm wrapped around him. He should be doing something.
“Not particularly. Still a little hyped.”
Dean shrugs. “It’s just the truth.”
Claire snorts. "If you set your mind to it you can get the straightest guy to give you a blowjob."
“If you had chickened out,” Claire says in too sweet a tone and holds out the mug to Castiel.
“Okay. Can he come to breakfast?”
Cas huffs. “I think those labels are overrated. I like dogs. But does that make me a dog person? Because I also like cats. Guinea pigs are cute, too. So maybe I’m just a person who likes animals? Or maybe, you know, just a person?”
And that, that is not something Dean has considered. That the outcome of what they’re doing could be more than avoiding broken bones and a life shackled to the one who’s breaking them. That the outcome of this could actually be something good. The start of something new. A life that he actually - enjoys. How weird is that?
“Nat’s stronger than me. She’d just decide to let you go and then she’d let you go.”
“I’m just
She shrugs, “Technicalities. It’s on a need to know basis. Right now, I’m here, so you don’t need to know. End of discussion.”
Followed by a string of emojis.
“Steve,” Steve says and shakes her hand. “And why would we arrest you?”
“Yeah, Cas, I know,” Sam pats the angel on the arm awkwardly. “But I’m sure you two can figure it out.” He hopes like hell they can, anyway, because living in the bunker with the permanent tension between these two has become impossible. “I’ll hit the books and send you anything relevant, okay?”
There is a disbelief in Cas’ voice that hurts Dean deep inside. How could he ever not want Cas? “Yes, Cas. I’m coming to get you. Stay put. Be safe until I’m there. I’m going to hang up now. But I’ll be there. Understood?” All he wants right now is to be with Cas, to bring him home, to hug him tight, to tell him...
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greets him quietly.
“Stop with the frown, Steve. I’da have asked you but I didn’t want to put it on your conscience. I know that you follow the rules.”
She is already there.
Indeed, he has to clear his throat before he can answer and even then his voice is hoarse. “You’ve said it to me before. And when you said it, you meant it. Every word of it. That was when we were young.” He leaves out that it had meant the world to him. Still does. Even if it’s another memory he will forever carry on his own.
The answer comes within seconds. As if she is sitting with her phone in hand waiting for his message. He shudders.
A tiny spark of jealousy immediately flares at Steve looking for all the world like he’s actually looking forward to seeing Cas again, but fortunately he also still has his arm tightly slung around Bucky’s waist and Dean can smuggle his hand back into Cas’, so Dean will grant him this one.
“You broke into their house?” Steve asks horrified.
“Is he not the one who put you up to this? I swear ever since he knows I’m not straight he’s paranoid about every guy around me.”
“Cas and I are a couple. For real.” It’s not what Dean had wanted to say. It really isn’t. But he can’t take Sam’s patronizing tone for a single second longer. “Not defending. Just saying. So that you know. Cause it’s none of your business what we do anyway. So you just gotta live with it,” he growls.
“Sometimes I wish I was, you know?” It comes out as a hiccup as he tries to hold back the tears. “His son. He keeps calling me that, and…” He hides his face in Cas’ neck. Cas’ fingers come up to his hair, rubbing soothing circles into his scalp and neck. He lets his tears fall. It’s probably better to get them out before he meets Sam anyway.
“I understand how scary this must have been. But there’s an explanation for it. For why you couldn’t move away. Do you want to hear it?”
Nat nods. “We’re going to have a visitor.”
“Do I have to decide right now?” Dean asks, fighting back his panic. It vibrates under his skin but he’ll only allow it to come out once they’re safely back in the car.
“Why not?” Dean asks in disbelief. “Have you seen us, Cas? Everything… everyone who gets close to us -,” Dean almost says
Dean huffs a mirthless laugh. “You are of course aware that if you hadn’t insisted on driving I’d already be halfway out of town, right?”
“Steve, behave,” Natasha comments without even looking up from her notebook.
“Far as I can tell,” Dean shrugs. “You’re a little intense and a little clueless sometimes, but you’re friendly and not a judgemental asshat. In my book, that’s a win.”
Cas holds his hand out and Dean takes it and lets himself be dragged up. Without any further words, he follows Cas inside.
He’s not sure how much time he’d actually need for that, though. More than a few minutes, that much is certain.
“Part one done, part two coming. We need the eggs next. You can help me with that. Eggs aren’t complicated as such, but we need to separate them because we need the yolk for the filling and the whites for the meringue. Can you give me two bowls?”
“You knew with me,” Cas smirks.
“Sure,” Steve nods.
It had made Steve want to throw up because if there’s one thing he doesn’t want to do, it’s taking HYDRA’s place in Bucky’s mind. Natasha’s answer to that had been just as pragmatic. ‘Then don’t.’
She shrugs. “It was and it wasn’t. My parents aren’t bad people and they’re good teachers and stuff. But parents tend to win all fights. And they never have the same interests you have.”
“But then you changed your mind. You said just this one night,” Dean answers dumbfounded because he’s heard that loud and clear.
“They are clueless. Or at least that one is,” Natasha concludes when she comes back inside. “You have most definitely not been made. Though he looks the type to have collected Captain America comics when he was a kid.”
okay?”
So he is too nervous to do anything but keep his phone in hand and wait for it to beep with an incoming message, well aware that Cas doesn’t know that he got his letter and that it’s quite possible that he has better things to do than to sit next to his phone and wait for a message from Dean.
Cas shakes his head, incredulous look on his face. “Dean, you realize that you did exactly what I wanted, right?”
Jess sighs. “I was saying that there’s a reason I texted you to call me back in the first place.”
“You apologized for saying it to my face,” Cas bites. “I’m not weak, Dean.”
Oh yeah, Steve remembers, they’re supposed to make conversation and build trust. “We brought lemonade,” he says lamely. “Thought you might be thirsty. What with you moving in and everything.” Right. Way to state the obvious, he sighs inwardly. He might be out of the ice longer than Bucky’s been away from HYDRA, but his small talk skills are still lacking.
“We’re here.” Castiel stops the car in front of a dark house in a silent side-street.
After texting Cas the info about the meeting tomorrow, Dean has nothing to do and so the day isn't moving forward at all. Dean watches his way through some new series on Netflix and it pulls him in enough that time passes marginally faster at least. He’d go grocery shopping for their dinner later but Cas’ fridge is actually decently stocked. And it’s definitely too early to start cooking.
They both chuckle, the teasing comfortable like a well-worn blanket.
“Dean,” Cas turns to him anyway, “there is nothing I can do to change this. I can hide my status with a tattoo, I can pretend to be disappointed that I haven’t found my soulmate yet, but deep down, I know it every single second of my life: There is no soulmate for me.”
Finally, they have everything set up and can start playing. Dean chuckles when he clicks on Luigi. Charlie raises an eyebrow at him.
“Well, if you want to build a case,” Sam starts hesitantly, “it’s better if she immediately agrees to an Unsealing as far as the documents go.”
Dean had seen it fit not to contradict that at that moment. Or now, actually, because Cas is glowering darkly again. So better not step on his angel sensibilities any more than he already has.
“Magical?”
Just a heads up, we're in for a bit of a rough few chapters and not all angst gets resolved immediately. <3
It makes Dean angry again, because yeah, he’s kind of been thinking the same thing about Cas, that one day he’ll fly off and leave Dean behind, but it’s not the same thing. “How can you even think that, Cas! I know what you gave up for me. I’m here for you.”
‘This is not your first rodeo, come on, you know how to do this.’
They’re almost back to normal in the morning. Bucky’s up before Steve, even though Steve gets up early for his morning run. He gets cornered by Bridget, their middle-aged neighbor on the other side, who he thinks is oblivious to any implied relations between Bucky and him. And to pretty much the rest of the world. All she ever cares about is how much she despises her husband and children. Steve’s really got to learn how to extract himself from these conversations faster.
Because deep down, he knows it’s better this way. He’s got his Dad as an example of what happens when a bottle of Jack is your best friend. And cigarette smoke tastes vile, he can’t really deny that, even if he gave that one up for Cas and right now he’s in the mood to be stubborn about anything that Cas brought into his life.
Another assessing look that makes him think Natasha has already figured out how she can make sure that he stays dead if she kills him. “He doesn’t need distance from you, Rogers,” she says grudgingly. “He needs to feel that he’s not a monster. That he is still worthy of a good person’s love. I can’t give him that. I can be his big sister, but that’s it. I’m a monster myself, and he knows it. But you aren’t. Ball is in your court, gramps.”
“Dude! I’m not gonna report you! What the fuck?”
Dean turns his head all the way away, looks over the house and the sparse trees. The cold air bites his lungs, his breathing still too shallow, too rapid. He tries to calm it down. He’s talked about this. Often enough that the words are there. They just never want to come out. “He kinda thought he owned the world. And me. Didn’t take No for an answer. On anything.” He turns back to Cas after all, even though it feels like his blood is freezing. But he needs to word this as bluntly as he can and see the reaction to this. Needs to see the look in Cas’ eyes. Needs to see whether there’s disgust. Or even worse, arousal. “When I said No, he didn’t accept it. So he raped me. He hit me and he raped me. And one time he did it bad enough that I ended up in the hospital. And that was the end of it. Sam didn’t let me go back after.”
Cas. Which is all very proper and doesn’t go beyond cuddling and the occasional kiss. Admittedly, they really haven’t had as much as half an evening on their own, and Cas thinks that Dean is rather private about these things. Cas himself doesn’t really see the difference, but then, he has the creeping suspicion that he and Dean have different expectations about this particular part of their relationship and what it is supposed to mean. Knowing Dean, he’s going to want to find beauty and connection in it.
Cas shakes his head: “Don’t be. You were one of the few friends who stayed by my side. It’s not your fault that I was too messed up to tell you how much I appreciated that. And I did. You know that, right?”
“I can ask Dean whether we need you to bring anything,” the guy says tightly.
The outburst is met with astonished silence. Dean rubs a tired hand through his hair.
He flinches when suddenly there is a hand on his shoulder. He almost punches Cas before his brain registers that yes, that is his best friend’s hand that’s touching him and that’s okay.
“I can’t,” he mumbles. “Sorry.”
“Want to make you stick around,” Dean admits and lowers his eyes away from Cas. It’s bad enough to say it, he doesn’t want to see the rejection.
Dean’s throat suddenly feels tight, and okay, his emotions are on a rollercoaster today. “You wanna stop with the deep talks for a while and, I don’t know, eat the sandwiches and watch a movie or something?”
And uhh, that was probably a little more than he’d wanted to say but Bucky ducks his head to hide his soft smile, and tightens his hold on Steve’s hand, so Steve thinks he did okay with what he said after all.
But Cas sighs. “I wish they could. There is nothing I’d want more than to be with you. But I can’t.”
“For God’s sake, Dean,
“And you’re here…”
“What’d you try the landline for anyway?” Dean deflects because he’s got a feeling he’s got some bitching out coming as soon as Sam puts two and two together.
It comes out a little too loud and a little too angry, as usual when his guilt wants to choke him into silence and he has to battle to get the words out at all.
Only now, he’s met his soulmate and on the surface, she’s an attractive woman. She’s got cleavage and even though he’s more of an ass than a boobs kind of guy, nice cleavage is nothing he frowns upon. And his body responds to her, too, there’s no doubt about it. Only his mind doesn’t. His heart doesn’t. And maybe he should try harder, maybe he should get over the fact that he’s terrified whenever he’s in a room with her, maybe he should cook for her and have a candlelight dinner with her - and goddammit, Cas actually lit that fucking candle. It messes with Dean’s head is what it does.
“But I…” Dean breaks off. Because, yeah, he’d kind of said that thing about passing the time with sex. And that had been all good and it had always been clear to everyone involved that it was no more than that. A nice activity for two people to feel good. Never made unnecessarily complicated by feelings. He’d liked the people involved, of course, and felt a hazy sort of fondness for them, but that was the extent of that. But Cas? Cas was different. “I think I understand what you mean,” Dean frowns thoughtfully.
“Yes,” Charlie nods. “To your loving soulmate and wife Amelia, who died two years ago.”
His phone buzzes almost immediately with a reply.
“You can do your research simultaneously,” Dean replies. “If you find anything helpful that’s legal, all the better. Otherwise, I’m all for exploring all options.”
“Well, your judgement might be impaired. You hit your head pretty hard.”
“Be careful?” Cas asks.
Dean isn’t really sure what to say to that. “You don’t?”
“You don’t want me to keep my hands to myself?” Cas raises one eyebrow and instead of going over to the other side of the bed he strides closer to where Dean is sitting. It’s somewhere between casual and predatory, Dean can’t really decide. What he knows, though, is that Cas switches gears fucking fast. Gone is the guy who photographs bees, and instead there’s a steely eyed man towering over him, demanding an answer.
Cas stares at him a little more intently than maybe necessary but he nods. “I’d like that.”
Really it’s more like he doesn’t want to admit how natural it feels for him to bake. It was always his Mom who baked, his Dad never really setting a foot in the kitchen apart from getting some beer from the fridge. Dean can’t help but feel that his Dad would be disappointed in him for reveling in the way the dough comes together in his hands, the separate ingredients slowly forming one smooth mass.
“The sheets are too big,” Cas states the obvious.
“Really?”
Dean nods because it really is obvious, Bucky’s attempt at riling him earlier notwithstanding. Because all of that snark, all of that attitude, it drops away when Bucky looks at Steve. And yeah, Dean sneaks a glance over to Cas, he knows how that happens.
So Dean goes shopping for the few things he needs to make dinner. It means braving the outside world and Dean’s still a bit paranoid about public places, expecting Amara to show up any minute, but he keeps his mind focused on the goal of the operation (burgers and pie - because burgers are Cas’ favorite and pie is his) and that helps. Cas deserves all the good things in the world and Dean can already hear him moaning around his burger because that’s what he always does, and it’s mostly something silly that Dean laughs about but he can’t help but wonder whether it’s close to whatever sex noises Cas makes.
Too many feelings, too many memories. It still feels like a fog hanging over him, making it impossible for him to do a thing. To take back control.
‘Dumped in the garbage. Awesome job, Winchester,’ he thinks.
“No, Dean,” Cas shakes his head. “I’m too close to this. I couldn’t offer you any professional support even if I wanted to. Which doesn’t mean that I won’t be here for you because I will,” he hurries to assure.
“Castiel?” Hannah asks, worry tinging her voice.
Dean buries his face in his hands. “Don’t let your brother spray-bottle me, Cas. Please?”
On a canon note: Happy birthday, Dean Winchester! I'm very much ignoring the last few episodes, so in my mind, you're having a lovely birthday party right now, Cas saved from the Empty and Eileen back at Sam's side. Have all the burgers and pie for your birthday that you deserve!
Natasha leads them through the living room, no technical gadgets apart from her notebook in sight. Dean side-eyes the notebook, too. He covers it quickly by pretending to have a general interest in the layout of the rooms, nodding and umming at the various differences between their houses as he points them out to Natasha. But Steve is sure that Dean would love to get his hands on Nat’s computer.
“Wanna check up on them?” He growls and knows he sounds possessive as all hell.
He resists the urge to bang his head against the table. Instead, he sends a quick message.
Suddenly, it makes Dean angry. “Got nothing to say, huh? Never had anyone hate his soulmate quite as much as I do, huh?”
“You got it, Cap,” Natasha nods and turns back to her notebook. She types a series of commands into the new window and then waits.
“The same one whose code the neighbors are using? You tripped their tripwire and they noticed you?”
“Pretty sure the principles stayed the same. Soil, nutrients, water and seeds equals flowers.”
“Dean,” she says sternly.
“Dean, this is a bad idea.” But Cas turns around and drops the heap of blankets on the bed. On his side of the bed, to be precise.
“What would you have me do? Camp outside and hope that the winter shows us mercy? Starve Cas in the hopes that weakening his body will stave off a heat until it can be survived in spring? Risking that the cold will kill him anyway?”
It hurts somewhat fierce that Cas even has to ask. That he trusts that little. But it’s not like Dean wasn’t had it coming. So he grits his teeth against the pain and bears it. “Always, Cas. I always want you near.”
“So we go by your motel, then go get Kaia. No need for you to pay for a motel room you’re not staying in. As long as it’s good for you if we’re back here tomorrow late afternoon?”
“It was quite difficult,” Cas states. “Dean’s got a knack for being difficult sometimes.”
“Did you do that, Sam?”
And yeah, that was probably a bit better than mentioning the booty but it’s still kind of shallow. Dean can do better.
“No, don’t,” Sam says quickly. “Just describe what you see.”
Fear clutches at Dean’s heart. “Cas?” he calls out.
Now Bucky’s at the same height as him, his hand on Steve’s chest. “I think you’re lying. Cause you’re trying to imply that we’ve never done this before. And I don’t believe that.” He leans in with the words, and then his lips are on Steve’s again, soft and sweet. “You were probably too good for me back then, too.” Another peck. “But I doubt I could stop myself then, either.” This time, the kiss lingers a little longer, Bucky’s mouth open and inviting.
“I’ll talk to you soon, okay?”
And okay that was a low blow but what the hell is Sam’s problem talking about Cas like he’s useless?
Dean can hear her shaking her head.
“You want to drench Steve with a super soaker?”
Cas nods then. “I understand. Not the  soulmate bond, obviously, but the - I understand that you don’t want it.”
Depending on how the evening goes, this might be their last day together. Tomorrow morning, Dean might be packing a bag and leaving this house and this life behind.
“I - I’m sorry that I ran away without telling you where to.”
Bucky looks at him for a long moment, then his face softens into something that is almost a smile. “I want a happy end as much as the next guy, Steve. This modern age is a pretty good place to live in. So I won’t go and do anything stupid. But chances are, there ain’t gonna be a happy end for me. So I need to know that I’ve got an out. That I won’t have to go back to -,” he breaks off.
“About Cas.”
“Dean!”
Squinty guy’s eyes soften somewhat at the words and he even gives him a smile. “They make it hard sometimes.”
And right, Cas is a Guardian. Cas knows all about this kind of shit. Dean nods.
“You really love each other,” Cas’ voice is soft and Dean looks over to him. There is a small smile on his face and Dean’s heart aches.
He can’t help it, he watches Hannah like a hawk. Watches for any sign of disgust, now that he’s mentioned the gender of his partner. But her eyes stay gentle.
“Well, you did something right with your last comment, obviously,” Charlie answers excitedly. “Also, you can’t be sure it’s a
Suddenly, there’s warmth wrapping around his palm.
“That he hadn’t ever said it before.
“So you think our new neighbors are nice?” Dean rounds in on Cas and Sam turns to head over to the kitchen to put the lemonade down. He doesn’t want to be a part of this conversation. Not with the way that there had been a dangerous glint in Dean’s eyes when Cas had not hesitated drinking the lemonade after giving the tall blonde guy – Steve was it? – a smile.
“If she says No, you’re not showing up against her will. And you’re not dragging her out of the house to come with you. You get reacquainted, see whether you click. And if she likes you, then you meet again. And again. And then eventually you can ask her about moving back with you. Without pressuring her. And if she says No, we’re back to you’re not gonna do nothing without her consent.”
“I have no siblings,” Charlie says apropos of nothing in the middle of the last round on this course.
“Did I hear my name?” Claire stands in the doorway.
“But you can’t knoooooow!”
Dean doesn’t know if he wants to punch something or if he wants to run away and hide in the kitchen because his neighbors have what he can never have. They’ve worked it out, they’ve managed it. Somehow they’ve worked through all of their issues, because Dean senses there are issues for them, too, but they are together now, holding onto each other so hard that they’re completely oblivious to the world around them. Dean wishes it could be like that for Cas and him. But it can’t and Dean wants to punch a wall and scream and tell them to stop.
“Valid point,” Natasha nods amiably, “I still got bored. So are we going to argue my love life or do you want to hear what I found?”
Cas is no help, either, he just watches from the armchair that he’s currently occupying. Keeping himself neatly out of reach until Dean makes good on his promise and tells Sam about them.
“Whether it’s the crack that makes him love you?” Dean says in sudden inspiration.
Cas’ stomach does an unpleasant swoop when he notices that, yes, that is actually what he was doing. And no matter what, that is not okay.
Time has no meaning. Has it been seconds? Minutes? Hours? Dean can’t bring himself to care. This right here and now is what he wants. It feels like a dream, like something he’s made up because he wants it so much, so just in case he wakes up the minute he lets go of Cas he’s not going to. His mind is awesome with the HD and dolby surround, so if this is all he ever gets, he’s going to enjoy it to the limit. He sucks Cas’ lower lip into his mouth, reveling in the way it makes the angel shudder.
“Jesus, man, wear a bell.”
“With a girl.”
“Exactly what I expected. Weapons. Many, many weapons. Not of the assault rifle kind, either. More of the shotgun and rock salt and silver knives and holy water kind.”
And yeah, somehow Dean is reasonably sure he’s not going to get out of this one. “Yes,” he confirms what she already knows.
not okay,” Cas replies and throws Dean with that. “Please stay with me tonight?” Cas asks, his voice soft again.
“I’m glad,” Castiel answers, “because that would be a pretty risky way of dealing with things. And I wouldn’t like it.”
“Yes.” There is no doubt about it.
“No. And I hope from the bottom of my heart that they’ll never figure it out. They don’t need this on top of everything.”
“Never mind,” he waves the question off. “It was just a thought.” An important one, though, even if he has no interest in telling Hannah why.
Cas @Dean: [screenshot of map with address attached]
“Was,” Cas answers, deep sorrow in his voice. “She was my sister.”
“Hey, Dean, it’s going to be okay. We’re going to find a way.” Suddenly, Sam’s face is openly worried.
“You’re welcome, Red. SHIELD wants some information in exchange, you’re aware of that, right?” Natasha says.
Great, now they’re teaming up on his sorry ass.
When everyone’s taken their last bite, Gabriel pushes his plate away and burps. “Better. I’m never good with crime on an empty stomach.”
Steve nods impatiently, because well, any piece of code that can hack SHIELD is elaborate. “What’s interesting about it?”
“It wasn’t?” Dean asks.
“You wish that he’d have seen you undamaged? And you him?” Steve asks.
It’s embarrassing, really, how his breath hitches at the light contact when his fingers brush Cas’ as he takes the strings from his hands to wrap them around his sides and tie them in the back.
“Mi casa es su casa or whatever,” Dean says and gets up to let Sam and the dog pass him.
“Yeah, how is it going on that front anyway?” Dean immediately holds on to the thing that allows him to get the attention off of himself for a moment.
“You should really get a haircut.” He slaps his brother on the back in greeting. “Jess is gonna leave you any day now.”
Steve chuckles mirthlessly. “Pretty sure the house does all the reporting for me. Stark Tech was here for three days before we moved in.” He picks up his voice a little. “So, Tony, in case you’re listening to this, you’re a creep. Also, I’m handling this operation, so decisions in the field are mine to make. Which means that for the duration of this operation, Buck can take all safety measures he deems necessary. Firearms included.” He goes back to his normal voice. “It might become necessary, too. Castiel’s military of some type. I got that much out of him. He seems stable and non-threatening, but he’s got combat training and we’ve got to assume that his partner’s got training, too.”
Steve is taken aback for a moment when Sam’s “Hi” is accompanied by a quick touch to his chin, but then he gets it.
It’s not that simple and they both know it. “Do you remember the Howling Commandos?” Steve asks.
“They’re not…”
She nods, both like she’s expected the question and like she’s satisfied that he’s done as she requested and has come straight to the point. There may be many lessons he has not learned yet, but this is not one of them. Things are much simpler when you take Missouri by her word.
Suddenly, their dynamic seems unfair. He’s put everything on Cas’ shoulders. Trusting Cas as he did, Dean had stopped making decisions. He’d given them all to Cas. And he’d become someone to care for, someone to be protected. Without being a support in return.
Dean stubbornly avoids looking at him and stares out of the window while Cas dictates the address to Charlie to put into her GPS. He keeps staring out of the window while they drive, too. He can’t keep his legs from jittering or his breaths from becoming shorter and shorter the longer they drive, though, no matter how hard he tries.
come back to this.
“How’d she react?”
She raises one eyebrow at him, sits up straight and leans forward into his space.
“Because I don’t like loose ends. And I didn’t want you to think that I’m still upset with you. I’m not. I don’t regret what we had, Dean. Not a single moment of it.”
“Tell her yourself. You’re still coming over for family night, right, boy?” Bobby asks, concern clear in his voice.
“Dean, breaking a bond unlawfully is nothing that’s to be taken lightly,” Cas cautions.
Steve swallows around the lump in his throat. “We can try it out if you want to. Tonight.”
“If I want a newsletter subscription, it’ll be something useful. Like recipes, not spy news incorporated,” Steve grouses and rather doesn’t admit that he’s set the SHIELD memos to end up in his spam folder. Though it is a point of pride to him that he managed that. He’s getting better at this whole technology thing.
Bucky laughs, a short and slightly bitter thing. “Not enough to lower my inhibitions, don’t worry.”
The line goes dead and Dean lets himself fall back onto the couch. He’s not sure whether talking to his brother made him feel better or worse. Both, probably. It was also the last thing on his list of things that he can do other than contacting Amara. So logically, that’s his next step. Contact Amara, tell her that he wants an Unsealing. He grimaces. Yeah, that’s going to go over well.
“I’m aware.”
“You got a pretty big bed.” Dean sits down on one side of the bed and looks over the expense of sheets and blankets. “I don’t need it to be all mine.”
“Great,” Dean mutters but doesn’t actually fight being placed on a chair at the kitchen table.
Dean’s kind of genuinely curious about this one. Yeah, he’s a regular in angelheart’s comments, but so are all of his friends. And Dean’s pretty sure that he’s neither the wittiest nor the smartest of their regular crowd. He’s not the creepiest, either - that title goes to Becky, no doubt - but just cause he was begging for a new chapter to finally solve the mystery of Dr. Sexy’s stolen boots (hopefully with a steamy scene involving said boots)? In fact, it could be seen as bad online etiquette that he was impatient about getting a new chapter. Angelheart is writing this for free, after all.
“No?” Cas answers hesitantly. “But I just thought - because I’m new?”
He self-consciously brushes over the fresh bruises on his arm. Cas follows his gaze. “She shouldn’t have done that,” Cas says quietly. “She shouldn’t have hurt you.”
“Are you set on California?” Charlie repeats patiently. “I kinda gotta know which state or country your ID documents should belong to.”
“How about you? Do you have someone?” Balthazar asks.
“You just let me know, man,” Steve nods amiably. “Don’t let me keep you from,” he waves vaguely, “this.”
But Bucky looks back up at him anyway, through his lashes and all his hair.
Gabe deserved better. He deserved better in life and he deserves better now.
“No, Dean, I don’t,” Cas says confused as he puts the plate down on the counter next to him and steps forward right into Dean’s personal space. It’s as if Dean never talked to him about that.
“No, Dean, not that!” Cas shakes his head, expression warring between impatience and something that is also not unlike desperation. “Don’t say goodbye, Dean. Please don’t. Not like this.”
“Seriously, Dean, that’s mafia type professionals. You need backup. I’m sorry and I really wanted to give you two some t- I mean, I know you two are doing great working this case, but this could get dangerous. I’m coming over.”
Dean stares at his keyboard for another few minutes before he types.
Natasha shrugs. “Used the good fortune that you distracted them to do some digging.”
There’s another shudder running through Dean at the promise. Breaking him apart and remaking him. It’s a promise of more than one night and a promise of more than sex. He sees now why they need safe words. But even though he’s shaking, he doesn’t feel like using them. “Okay,” he mumbles and feels like with this one word he’s giving himself over to Cas completely.
“I’ll help eating,” she shrugs.
“Cause you -,” Dean thinks about it for a moment. “I’ve tried fitting the pieces, but somehow they don’t. The oversized suits suggest that you’re a boring office dude. But then you have this permanent bedhead that I’m not sure you can even tame down, and most offices don’t approve of that. Also, I saw you in a t-shirt today and you’re hiding muscle under all of those layers.” Dean grins appreciatively, though he tries not to make it a leer. This really isn’t about Cas’ physical appearance anyway. “You seem like a very together guy, holding yourself with confidence and a straight back. But then some moments, you’re terribly awkward - I don’t mean that badly but you’re kind of a dork. But then you have this brilliant wit and can banter with the best of them. The pieces of the puzzle don’t fit, man.”
He’s said the same words to Cas before, and there they had blown his cover, but all Bobby does is grumble some more.
“Umm, it’s too close to untoward for a first date?”
“Oh, none of that, Son. I ain’t John. Now, I’ll see you next Sunday?”
Charlie shrugs. “Depends. Did you need it?”
Dean chuckles. “You are aware that you’re only naming dudes, aren’t you? What happened to we don’t know angelheart’s gender?”
The beef is on the grill in minutes (hooray for their brand-new, well, found at a garage sale, Weber gas grill), but somehow it still feels like an eternity. Nothing goes fast enough and Dean really should have chosen a dinner that didn’t keep him away from Cas. But his burgers are his signature dish and it does not matter how good of a chef Steve might be, Dean knows with absolute certainty that he can outshine him in this one area. There simply are no burgers better than Dean’s. Which is why he forces himself to take his time, to be extra careful and make sure the patties are neither raw nor burned into charcoal. It’s a pain in the ass but Dean won’t screw up his burgers just because he can’t stand the thought of Cas in the house alone with them.
“I didn’t say that I was considering suicide,” Dean says. As far as attempts to calm his family go, it’s unsuccessful, because suddenly he has Cas holding onto his one arm while Sam is holding onto the other. “Jesus Christ. Guys! Will you let go of me!”
“Yep,” she confirms.
Much to his chagrin, Charlie presses pause and touches a hand to his arm to make him look at her. “That’s a pretty hefty thing to say.”
“Even if what?” Dean asks.
Cas nods, but the apprehension in his features does not get less. And yeah, Dean has put him through the wringer once already today, hasn’t he?
Charlie slaps him on the shoulder. “Dude, if you tell me next that you don’t know that you’re the most important person in Cas’ life, I’m gonna spend the rest of the afternoon driving Luigi off the road in retaliation.”
to go and try to convince her. She
Thing is, Cas knows how much Dean had wanted this once. How hard he’s tried to make this kind of life work for him. He also knows how bitterly that has failed. Dean had concluded back then what he already knew, that a hunter is not made for suburbia. That the monsters are always going to follow and he’s never going to fit in and be happy.
But Cas is unperturbed. He cups Dean’s cheek, stroking the skin softly. He brings his other hand up, too, following the same paths on the other side of Dean’s face, trailing carefully around where Dean’s face is busted up, mapping out the unhurt parts more deftly. It’s just sensation, good, but not meant to be more than that. An exploration of a world unknown. Cas lets his thumb trail over Dean’s lips but when Dean lets his mouth go pliant so that Cas can push in, Cas shakes his head. “Not yet.”
“It’s not a matter of
“Cas? You still with me?” Balthazar’s expression is openly worried. “Seriously, I thought Missouri was exaggerating but now I think she was actually understating how screwed up you are.”
“A thing?” Steve asks with raised eyebrows.
“I don’t know, man, just getting the feeling you’re used to getting an answer when you ask something.”
"I know," Cas quickly assures. "Believe me, I know.” He grimaces. “It's just that I'm also - kind of a coward."
But Dean shakes his head. “Never mind.”
But Cas only shakes his head. He doesn’t walk towards the door as Dean had expected. Instead, he goes over to the shelf unit. He bends down to retrieve something - a box, Dean thinks. He doesn’t bring the whole thing over, instead he opens it where he is and searches for something. It’s that thing that he finally brings back and holds out to Dean.
"Until recently, I had a lot of time to fill," Cas grimaces.
Cas raises his eyebrow, clearly not believing him.
“Are you sure you’re okay?”
“Thought you served. Is what your boyfriend said anyway.”
“I can’t, Dean. I need to clear my head. I can’t do it while you’re around.”
Natasha snorts. “Right.”
“Yeah,” Dean nods. He gets two beers out of the fridge, puts one on the table for Cas, opens the other for himself and leans back against the counter, watching Cas place the call. It’s so fucking familiar, every motion one that they’ve gone through a thousand times over the course of their friendship. Hell, Cas didn’t even have to ask what Dean wanted on his pizza. He just knows. Like he knows pretty much everything else about Dean. Including when to come home because Dean’s one-liner he sent via text message sounded too much like goodbye.
If that’s what he wants.
“Heya, stranger,” he greets him with a wide smile.
His whole face radiates pride and joy and all Dean can feel is the bottom dropping out from under him. “I’m… Goddammit, Sammy, I’ve got no idea what to say.”
Once he is done with the stitches, Chuck sets the needle aside and nods. “Alright, that looks good. Humans are easier than hamsters, I got to admit. Now let’s check the rest of you out. Remove the shirt if you please.”
Sam starts fishing around in his pocket, and Dean isn’t sure what he expects. Some legal papers that relate to his situation maybe. What he gets, though… What he gets is so much worse.
Hesitantly, he picks up the phone to check the caller ID.
Steve sends him a hard look, but then he suddenly blushes and runs a hand through his hair. “Gosh, look at us,” he chuckles self-consciously, “not even wanting to let them out of our sight for a few minutes, when they’re both warriors. It’s a bit ridiculous really.”
“Huh,” Cas sits back in his chair, staring into nothing for a moment. “I guess I haven’t really thought about it that way. If you have no mark, then you get a choice.”
"My dad is a baby queer?" Claire laughs somewhat hysterically. "And here I thought the night couldn't get any weirder."
Balthazar’s arms sink as he observes Cas with a new attention. “Okay, so Missouri was right, you are in a bad place right now. Any particular reasons for this one? Or at least something else I can call you? I’m not going to go and call you Castiel every time I want to talk to you.”
Cas nods. “But that part of it stands: I swear you’ll like this.” He waves the DVD case and fishes for the remote.
Dean groans. “I asked for useful information.”
“Huh,” Charlie says and then a second later. “Oh. Ooooohhhh.”
“Tricks, huh?” Steve raises his eyebrows.
“Of course.” The wish is simple enough.
"I live there," comes the dry reply. Dean has to bite back a grin.
“Nope,” Charlie shakes her head. “Said it’s your story. But really, Dean, you tend to be a pretty sensible guy
what you think is important right now?”
Charlie elbows him in the ribs. “Stop drooling,” she whispers as Cas turns away abruptly.
“No problem. See you.”
Her gaze pointedly drops to the bruises on his wrist before she looks back up at him and he quickly crosses his arms to hide his hands. “She didn’t,” he breaks off and starts anew. “When she was happy with me, she didn’t - do any of that,” he finishes lamely. “Which is why I thought I could ask her whether she’d agree that we - you know, that we come see you every so often? Or whether she’d let you visit us at home? Just to, you know…” He trails off lamely and looks down at his feet.
It feels like a private moment, so Steve averts his eyes. And looks right into Bucky looking up at him. Bucky’s got his lower lip caught between his teeth, absentmindedly chewing on it. Steve can’t help that his eyes are drawn to it before they flicker back up to meet Bucky’s eyes.
Cas lifts his head and looks right back at him. “Love is nothing to be ashamed of,” Cas says.
“Now, now, be polite, Dean-o. I’m helping you after all.”
She smiles benevolently. “At Stanford. He’s quite the bright one, isn’t he?”
"I - apologies. Again. I was - curious how she came to live with you."
is - is supposed to have a chance at all.
Dean tries for a charming smile, tries to make her forget that Cas even exists. He’s too scared of what she might do to Cas if she figures that he is important to Dean. “What do you say, want to sit and talk?”
“Watch DVDs?” Dean asks even though he knows that’s not the answer.
“He likes you,” Cas observes and there’s a smile in his voice.
All Jo does is laugh. She is faster on her feet than him. He takes her stretched out hand and lets her help him up. They hug in a more normal and less destructive way before Ellen cuffs him around the ears.
“Like whadda who now?”
“Oh hell, no!” Dean half jumps out of his chair. “That can happen? There’s a chance that I have to go through all of this shit
“And I could never forgive myself if I let you do this. So I’m guessing we’re at an impasse.”
“Good,” she huffs.
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.
“Haha,” she pouts.
“Your parents didn’t.”
They stare at each other until Charlie clears her throat. “You have completely forgotten that I’m in the room, haven’t you? Yeah, thought so. Anyway, I’m gonna call in sick for work. And you, Cas, should be calling your brother. Let’s see what he was able to arrange.” She whips her phone out and turns to leave the room. At the last second, she turns back around to them. “Oh, and guys, if you ask me, you need to work this out. I propose to advance from staring to kissing. Just my personal opinion.”
For a moment, that seems to catch the other guy off guard but then he nods and digs for his cell phone. Steve does the same. Of course the phone he’s carrying is not his private phone, it’s SHIELD tech and he’s got it just for this type of operations.
There are a few haphazardly packed presents on the table but Claire herself is nowhere to be seen. Dean puts his presents next to Claire's. His wrapping skills are definitely no better.
When he notices Steve enter, he looks up. “Is this okay?” he asks with a frown. “Is this how we used to do this?”
“Here,” the man holds it out to him.
“Hmm,” Balthazar gives a noncommittal grunt. “Maybe that should be your place to start. Honesty. I mean, I get the casual thing and all, but the way your eyes and your face do this thing when you’re talking about him, I’m getting the feeling that it isn’t all that casual.”
Dean chuckles. “You get nightmares from watching Indiana Jones? No wonder you almost didn't make it through Star Wars.”
Hannah raises her eyebrows. “You didn’t mention that you’ve got someone.”
“You’re still scared of me, though.”
“Oh.” The confused blink is back.
Gabe nods “Always am. And you just, I don’t know, keep holding Dean’s hand or something.”
“Yeah, well, tough shit because I don’t give a flying fuck about that. He loved you and he didn’t blame you. So your opinion about it doesn’t matter.”
But not even the intentional dig can wipe the smile of Sam’s face. Instead, it grows only wider. “It’ll be great, you’ll see!”
“Okay, Sam, the laptop is on. Now would you please tell me what’s going on?”
Finally, Natasha clears her throat. “Okay,” she says. “Okay. But the minute I get the feeling something is off, you’re in trouble, Rogers.”
Steve sighs and looks at the cable in his hand. “Thanks for the offer, but in my experience, the boss usually ends up cleaning up the mess.”
“Her,” Cas points at a slim young woman who in the photo has one arm wrapped around a teenage Cas and Gabe each. “I’m talking about her.”
I know, I know, it took forever and a day and the chapter isn't even that long. But the story is still alive and so are we and that's a cause for celebration! Hope you enjoyed cute huggy fever-cling Dean!
“Okay,” he nods when the kiss finally breaks. “Now I’m ready.”
“Oh, Alan Simpson’s a politician. Or was. He’s over 80 now. Definitely a better guy than OJ.”
“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t talk about me like I wasn’t here,” Cas says quietly, though no less angry for it. “Unless you want me to go until you have sorted this out?”
“Welcome to my humble abode.” Dean gives a little half-bow when they enter his bedroom. “Please ignore the chaos. Alright, let’s see what we have.” He opens his closet and kneels down to find the box that he’s just stashed back after finding his own Christmas sweater in it this morning. He looks through the options and then throws a red sweater with an enormous gaudy Christmas tree on it at Cas. “Try it on. Cause that suit won’t fly at Christmas, dude.”
“He got a dog. From a shelter. He wants us to meet him,” Cas saves him.
For a moment, it is silent enough that you could hear a needle fall. Then Charlie breaks out laughing. “Seriously? This...?” She grabs at Cas’ wrist.
“Well.” It’s Cas’ turn to shrug. Naomi has always had a lot of acquaintances but she’s too self-righteous for anyone to get close and become her friend.
She chuckles. “It’s fine. You’re doing pretty well for a first timer. I had people not say a single word the first time they met me. Awwwwwkward.”
“Touched her?” Dean asks. He guesses that’s the question that doesn’t want to leave Cas’ lips. “Not that I know of. She had a few scrapes and bruises, but I think it was mostly from getting into fights. She still does that every so often. She’s gotten better at it, though, now it’s the other people bringing home most of the bruises.”
“She searched you out?” Dean sits back down on the bed because suddenly his legs don’t want to carry him anymore.
“That you mean it. And you can’t mean it.” ‘Because then you would fall completely and I can’t let that happen.’ But he doesn’t say that out loud because Cas is a stubborn son of a bitch. Well, son of God, actually, but the point stands.
Cas vehemently shakes his head. “She knows about you. She knows you’re more than a friend.”
Dinner goes surprisingly well, all things considered. Castiel - Cas, is easy enough to be around. Probably because they are both awkward as hell in the company of strangers, so they’re naturally drifting towards dorky topics like gardens and bees and the coloring of different flowers that Steve guesses Bucky and Dean would never be caught dead talking about, but that Steve finds interesting enough, if only because he’s now got the chance to paint nature scenes for the sake of the nature instead of because that’s where he’s hunkered down during a war.
The small hairs next to Cas’ ear move with the words and Cas shivers.
“Oh.” The woman’s eyes dart to Cas and back to Dean.
Steps in the hallway announce that Bucky’s coming back before Steve can find a reply to that.
Natasha shrugs. “We traced back their call, too, but it got pinged around the globe too much to be sure where it came from. Tech is pretty sure it originated from within the US.”
“Tell me everything! Right now!”
“How can you be so sure?” Dean asks because Cas’ voice leaves no doubt that he actually is sure about this.
“Damn,” Dean mutters. “That’s about a 15 minute drive from where I blacked out.”
“What was that?” Amara comes a threatening step closer, somehow managing to tower even though she’s shorter than Dean.
Jess chuckles. “Turned off the alarm, huh?”
“Michael? Really? What about Luke?” Cas asks because he had been reasonably sure that his older brothers would be fighting for their Mom’s attention, even if it was only because they wanted to ensure their inheritance.
“Write me a postcard, okay? If you ever, you know, get hitched? There’s these online postcards that you can totally send anonymously. I want to know, alright?”
Gabe shrugs. “You gotta ask the gal that’s actually performing them. All I know is that the result is exactly what you want: A broken bond.”
“You didn’t even notice, did you?” Dean shakes his head. “Dammit, I flirted with a handsome dude for two months and he didn’t even notice.”
Dean’s hands are nervous with sweat with the door bell finally rings. He still tries for a smile when he lets Charlie in. “Thanks for coming by so fast.”
The rage of the Mark rushing through him. The impact of his fist on Cas’ face. Cas stumbling backwards, pleading with him to stop. Never once fighting back. Trying to reach Dean, to pull him back from the edge, and at the same time just accepting that he’s probably going to get killed in the process. And he succeeded with his plan, didn’t he? In a way, anyway. Not in keeping the Mark from finding other targets. But with the rage running against Cas’ stoic refusal to fight, the Mark screeched and stomped its feet and urged him to kill, but the part that was still Dean wanted something else out of this fight. And suddenly knew that he wouldn’t get it. That he wouldn’t be able a goad Cas into killing him. Next time I won’t miss. A lie of course. He hadn’t missed, he’d given up. But it sits in his throat like he’s swallowed a two by four. He’ll never manage to swallow it down or cough it back up. He’ll never be able to make this right.
Steve huffs but of course Bucky is right. Steve knows jack about gardening. It’s not an activity Captain America has much time or use for usually. Still, that doesn’t have to be a disadvantage. “Guess I’m just going to have to do this in my own style, then,” he nods. “Keep an eye on me in case he does something weird?”
. That’s the only word that comes to Dean’s mind about how Cas’ get-up makes him look. “Jesus,” he coughs and makes a deliberate effort to turn back to the stove. It’s going to be an interesting night.
“Only when we were drunk cause we weren’t a couple.”
For a long moment, Cas doesn’t answer. Then he swallows heavily. “Who.” It is no more than a whispered word. “You should ask me,
Cas lets go of him just to cross his arms in front of his chest. He’s blocking the doorway, staring Dean down.
What was that? A text message? “Sam, who is texting you?” Dean wants to know because maybe the hacker got to their phones, too.
“So we’re seriously thinking about this?” Dean asks, his mind still caught between screeching and shutting down.
The question is a little more aggressive than is called for, so Dean raises his eyebrows again. “Dude, you can ask about my life but I’m not sure I should be telling you her stories.”
“Well, Gabriel has helped out with me at the dog shelter before,” Cas replies drily. “So he would know about that.”
But Cas doesn’t move away. He comes closer. “May I hug you?” he asks. “Or is touching still too much?”
He doesn’t avoid her probing stare. “I’m good, Ellen. I swear.”
There isn’t much else that Steve can do but wrap his arm around Bucky’s back and hold him steady.
“One step at a time, sweetheart. It’s the only way anyone moves.”
The pressure on Dean’s hand increases painfully where Amara holds it.
“Uhh, Bucky, if you’re up for it, I mean?” Steve asks his partner, and it sounds a bit like an afterthought but it also sounds somewhat worried.
“So why are we here?” Sam asks.
Chuck sighs again, obviously resigned to his fate. “Kitchen table, please. The light is best there. I’ll get my emergency kit.”
There’s a long moment of silence and then a defeated sigh. “You need backup.”
She laughs. “You color-coded your notes in school! And you made your lab partners color theirs in the same system.”
“They traced the origin of your phone number back to SHIELD HQ.”
Dean interrupts him before he can get far with that. “Nah, Cas, this was coming. Now’s as good a time as any. Whatever you want to say, I deserve it.” The words curdle on his tongue like sour milk. If he could get away with never facing this, he’d prefer the hell out of that. But he’s hurt Cas enough as is. He can’t go on in this limbo of whether they’re still friends or not. If Cas needs to cut him out of his life, he has to let him. It’ll hurt like a bitch, but it’s not like Dean isn’t used to losing everyone he loves. Cares about. Whatever.
“Hey,” Dean says. This time, when he pushes into Cas’ space it’s not to tower over him. This time, he nudges his shoulder with his own, “I had you to save me, didn’t I? So it’s all good.”
. “I’ve waited a long time for you to come into my life, Cas. Now I’m willing to wait for you to be ready as long as it takes. If that means forever, I will wait that long as well.”
“Alive but unavailable. At that point, anyway. He died a few years ago.” Before the trial, thank God. Dean doesn’t even want to know what names his father would have called him after that.
“I just- I didn’t know that-,” he stutters, “that my, umm, heats were a decision criterion.”
Dean shrugs. “‘S gonna be around ten thirty, eleven. When the kids and the old folks are in bed after all the pre-Christmas cheer. That’s when all the stressed-out middle-agers come here to get some liquid courage for tomorrow.”
“She’ll know I lied to her. I told her I stayed at a motel. She’ll find your address.”
Cas. But boy, does he
“I’m not going to the hospital,” Dean insists.
“See you around, neighbors.” This time, Bucky’s smile could almost be mistaken for genuine, and for a second there, Steve thinks Bucky’s going to smuggle his hand into Steve’s but he doesn’t. He just comes closer until his arm is almost brushing Steve’s and then looks up at him, waiting demurely for Steve to lead them home. There is something about it that is deeply unsettling.
I’m sorry for that night, the night when you came to me after having visited John. And before you say it, I know I did nothing but what you asked me to do. I know that you didn’t call red and that I would have stopped had you done so. The thing is, I should have called red. Not even because you were drunk, though I should have known better than to accept your request while you weren’t at full mental capacity. No, I should have called red that night and then at every subsequent meeting that we had any interaction at all because I was in no condition to be anything to you. Not your boyfriend, not even your ex-boyfriend, and most definitely not someone who you give up control to.
“Nothing.” It’s not even really a lie. Because there is beer sloshing around in his stomach, making him fuzzy and pushing everything that’s wrong into the background a bit.
“You have a beautiful family,” Cas starts them up on a conversation once they’re walking. “Thank you for inviting me.” There is something like a genuine awe in his voice.
“Nah, it can’t be him. When would he even find the time?” Charlie muses. “Between his AP classes and cello and whatever else his mom makes him do, he’s barely got the time for D&D these days. Unless he doesn’t actually need sleep, he’d never have the time to write so much. Hmm, who then? Victor? Garth?”
In response to Dean’s snuggling closer, Cas’ arm comes up around him tighter, and then it takes no more than another deep breath and the conscious decision to just enjoy for a little while and not think, and Dean’s arm comes up around Cas’ waist and that is how they stay for the rest of the movie.
In the kitchen, Missouri is taking the tea out of the cabinet.
“What? No way, man! I ripped myself away and ran. I came straight here!”
“And you have!” It breaks out of Dean because the unfairness of it all is just too much. Even Charlie is going to suffer long-term consequences from this when she shouldn’t have to. “I know it’s just words, but thank you, Charlie. Thank you for keeping me from doing something stupid. You were so very needed.”
And that turns out to be a good idea, because Dean’s already got half a dozen anon messages and all of them are various degrees of alarming.
“Okay, Cas,” he sighs. “Compromise? We’ll get you the bee ones, but we get a second set in the grown-up section so that Sam won’t make fun of me forever, okay?”
“I do what?” Cas asks and the anger seems to be partly replaced with puzzlement.
“Well, can you blame me?” Dean shrugs. “He’s a dashing dude.”
So he lets it go. Concentrates on other things. Cleans the kitchen again. Gets his papers on the desk in the guestroom in order. Ignores the worried looks both Charlie and Cas are sending him and keeps quiet. Until finally Charlie says, “It’s almost five. We need to go.”
So he answers, “I’m not freezing. The clothes you gave me keep me warm.”
“Cas…”
“I’ll get it,” he jumps up off the ground.
“It’s just Gabe, he’s harmless,” Dean says quietly.
“She’s not on board. Amara. My soulmate.” Dean scrunches up his face. Even saying it feels wrong. Like a stain on his soul that won’t come off no matter how hard he scrubs at it.
“Hey, it’s a Corolla. There’s nothing he can fuck up. That car’s just gonna run.” That prompts a guffaw of laughter but no immediate protest, so Dean plows on. “I know this is shitty and inconvenient but - I’m gonna need a few more days to figure this out. Sorry, Bobby.”
Dean shrugs, though the gesture is tense. Cas can’t know it but his question is veering close towards the territory that Dean’s not usually discussing with people he’s just getting to know. “Well, I guess you could say I was her, once upon a time. Only I also had my little brother to feed and…” He breaks off. “I’m not gonna tell you my whole sob story tonight, especially since you don’t even know the whole thing with Michael and the trial yet.” Dean rubs his hands over his arms, a small comforting gesture. It’s been years but he can feel the bile rise at the back of his throat. So instead of lingering, he presses on. “Suffice it to say that the strangers that took me in never did it out of the goodness of their hearts. So, I didn’t want to see that happening to her. Didn’t want to see her hurt. Anymore than she already was, anyway.”
For a moment, Dean falters. He could leave it at that. If he never takes the first step to explaining this, he’ll never have to tell the rest of the story. He grimaces. That’s wishful thinking and he knows it. Cas is in his life now, for better or worse, because for some odd reason they have ended up at a place where they share the responsibility for a child.
Bucky nods. “Yeah. It showed up among the HYDRA bits and pieces a few days ago.” He bites his lip. “When you said it, it felt - significant. Made me stop. But I couldn’t - I can’t remember why. Why is it significant, Steve?” His voice is small and Steve’s not sure his is going to be any better.
“No worries,” Natasha smiles. “Better make sure all the food is packed away and that there are no shoes out for the dog to chew on.”
“I assure you that I have no intent of murdering you,” Cas says exasperatedly.
Dean’s got the urge to clap a hand on Cas’ shoulder in physical support, but he refrains. Instead, he says, “You’ll get used to it. Saying it out loud, I mean. And the more you do it, the easier it gets.”
She pushes his phone back to him. He doesn’t light it up again, just puts it to the side.
"Have you met her?"
“Dean, no,” Cas shakes his head fervently. “That’s not what I meant! If anyone has to feel guilty, it’s me, not you. You saved her. I abandoned her.”
“I’m not - I’m not good at relationships. I don’t know how they work. Or whether I’m made to be in them. So I cannot promise you a happily ever after. But what I can say, what I know without a doubt, is that I have loved you for a long time now. And while I cannot say whether my love is the same that other people feel, whether it’s the love that you want or need, I’m - I’m willing to give this everything I have.” He takes a deep breath. “Please take me with you when you go? Give us a chance?”
Dean apparently chokes on his spit because he starts coughing violently. “Yeah, tall, well-built considerate Steve… Who the hell is called Steve anyway?”
Castiel gives her a smile. “That even the bossiest color coder sometimes needs help.”
“Yes,” Dean nods and feels the slight flush creeping into his cheeks. “’Cause you like bees. I mean, we had a whole fight about how much you like them and all. With the bed sheets, I mean,” he mumbles.
Cas’ blush deepens. His eyes flit up to Dean’s and away again. “ That was before - You didn’t correct Claire. When she said you had a crush on me.”
It’s like Bucky’s trying his best to melt into his boyfriend, to be swallowed up whole. It should be terrifying, this amount of abandon. If there wasn’t Steve’s hand on Bucky’s neck, solid and firm, holding him, grounding him, keeping him safe.
“Okay, let’s try this again, champ,” he encourages Cas who has gone back to scowling. “And if you smite me, you’ll have to finish this pie on your own. So better think about it before you do that,” Dean smirks.
“Yes,” Cas nods and it doesn’t look like he had to think about this one.
Rowena fixes her eyes on Charlie before turning back to Dean. “
Dean chuckles at the tame threat. “Alright then, I’ll behave and we’ll see what you’ve got there. It better be awesome if you want to make sure that I’m going to behave.”
"And you have a crush on him."
“Of course,” Dean sighs. “It's either the Unsealing or …” He doesn't even want to think about it because the thought alone makes him a nauseous. Spending the rest of his life with Amara is - unthinkable.
“Fuck.” What a clusterfuck of a situation.
That’s the thing Sam doesn’t get. Sam’s got a soulmate who cares and he assumes that every soulmate is like Jess. But Amara isn’t Jess. Amara doesn't care about Dean at all. She wants to own him so that she can shape him after the idea of him that she has in her mind. It’s painful to realise but he has never seen it clearer than yesterday.
“Dean. Please look at me, Dean.”
“You - what?” Dean is stumbling over the words. Has Cas heard him? Because he’s pretty sure he’s never said that out loud.
Now comes the part where they figure out whether it leaves them freezing.
Immediately, Cas lays a protective hand over Dean’s but he still turns to Sam with the question, “Can we use this? Violence against your soulmate is a pretty big red flag.”
For a moment they both sit in silence nursing their beers.
Selfishly, Dean holds on for another few seconds before releasing Cas from his grasp. “You sure you’re good?” he asks.
“Yeah,” Dean nods. “It sure is.”
Cas isn’t buying it, though. He frowns. “Dean, I told you yesterday, you can stay here as long as you need to.”
She can't.
It gets better still when he goes back out to the front and sees a familiar figure sitting at the bar, trenchcoat and suit jacket folded neatly beside him.
And yeah, Dean can see what Sam is trying to do here but really, who are they kidding? “She won’t,” he interrupts his brother. “She won’t agree. Ever. I mean, you and Charlie, you weren’t there today, but Cas and Gabe can back me up on this.”
“It’s a stupid thing to say, probably, but he - I don’t know what it was, but I really liked him, Cassie - Cas. Like, in the whole I’m-going-to-miss-out-on-all-the-orgies-he-doesn’t-want-to-take-part-in way.”
“Are you okay?”
“I assume you want a full report?” Dean asks, discomfort stirring in him.
As it is, by the time Steve manages to get home, get showered and dressed, Bucky’s made breakfast.
“A nice guy? That’s what he wants you to believe, what with his perfect hair and perfect smile and perfect chin….” Dean trails off when his brain finally catches up to his mouth.
“You knew that the phone number isn’t registered to Steve and that it leads to another phone number?” Sam asks surprised.
Dean shakes his head with a little huff. He’s so gone for his angel it’s not even funny.
“It’s okay, Charlie,” Cas smiles a little sadly, “I did not expect to be able to keep my job.”
“Not a good time, Charles.”
“I never told anyone but Gabriel. And the tattoo artist, I guess.”
“Don’t sass me while I’m driving.”.
“That we’ll move together at my place of course, dummy,” she laughs sweetly. “The penthouse is a modern and open space. I’m sure you’ll like it. In fact, if you want we can go there right now. We can always get the stuff you really need from your old place later.”
“We were friends,” Cas says. “But then we kissed.”
probably. Dean shudders. He may not have been born a leader, but he sure as shit doesn’t feel like becoming a mindless follower again, either.
“No, Cas,” Sam shakes his head. “Captain America is not a monster, I’m pretty sure about that.”
“Good thinking,” Charlie nods.
Another deep sigh escapes Cas before he very quietly admits. “You’re already helping. I… I guess I was lonely. That’s why I texted. I am sorry that I woke you from your dream. I didn’t want to disturb you.”
“Because you don’t know the answer to that question,” Dean says quietly. “That’s why I do this.”
Dean hurries to get out of the car and approach Cas.
“Do it,” Dean says quietly. “Take the call.”
Please note that the rating has changed to mature and the final chapter count has been set to 8.
“No, that’s definitely not me,” Sam says puzzled. “That’s someone new.”
Just a reminder that Dean sometimes uses slurs without realizing what they are because cruelty and dismissiveness are so normalized in their society (he uses an ableist term in this chapter). Dean has no chance to know better, but we do. Language shapes our world just as much as society shapes language, so let's be thoughtful and kind to each other.
?” Charlie asks.
“What?”
It’s their neighbors. With a big plate of -
make him feel. “Cas, you can’t just say shit like that.”
Cas shakes his head. “Missouri, a little. But none of the others.”
It’s too much. Even if it isn’t as unconditional as it seems. Oh, Cas is aware that if he laid one finger on Sam, Dean would not hesitate to beat him into a bloody pulp. But not for himself. Never for himself.
So Dean covers Cas’ hand with his own and squeezes it. “Then don’t try.”
It’s a black and white clip showing two laughing men. There’s no sound and the quality is horrendous, the static almost having more weight than the picture.
“Yeah, I’m good,” Dean nods, the words slightly rushed. He clears his throat and tears his eyes away from his rescuer before the staring becomes too obvious. “Wondering where we are.”
Not surprisingly, Dean’s mouth works a few times before he actually manages to reply. “I think a goodnight kiss was deemed decent enough…” Cas has come so far into his personal space that Dean has to look up to keep his eyes on Cas’ face. His stomach somersaults just the tiniest bit at the new angle. Cas is all hard lines from here, strong runner’s thighs, square shoulders, angular face.
“He did what? Why did he…? Give me the number!” Dean stutters out.
“To the graveyard. When you go visit. I’m not sure you should visit alone.”
“They are?” Dean asks dumbly.
Not that he’s counting.
Cas nods though he doesn’t seem to know anything else to say.
That’s when he sees it.
For a moment, Dean can’t breathe. Hope seizes his heart, sudden and strong. Clenches his insides, and he’s sure all blood is draining out of his face. But the moment doesn’t last. It never does.
And maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be. Maybe this is how your last hours feel like when you know the end is coming. Maybe your brain prepares you for the parting by already cutting off the connection to the world.
He fills the next batch into the pan and puts it back on the stove.
“Eileen,” Dean says because even he has noticed this one.
Dean sighs. “Yeah, sure.”
“Why? What do you have to be sorry about? You’re the good guy here, the Guardian who’s propping me up. I’m the sorry asshole, who can’t even manage what everyone else in the fucking world can do.”
“No,” Dean quickly holds on. “It wasn’t a bad shiver. It’s just that -” it’s the first deliberate touch in months. The first time neither of them is crying and the touch is more than comfort. In fact, it sends tingles up his whole arm. Dean swallows hard because with the tingles the butterflies in his stomach make another appearance. And really, he’s known Cas for so long and they’ve been through so much, how can there still be butterflies like on the first day? “I’ve missed you,” he admits quietly.
“Bucky!” This time it’s not a question. This time Steve steps into Bucky’s personal space and makes his voice firm. It shuts Bucky up immediately. “What’s wrong?” Steve asks, voice much softer again. “And please don’t lie to me.”
“Here, it’s done like this,” Dean puts his own hands over Cas’ and guides him into smoothly breaking the egg and then separating it.
. How for one second he had almost forgotten that he isn’t allowed to feel this way. That this is not supposed to make him feel good. If anything, it should make him feel more guilty. Should remind him how much Cas has lost for him. How many angels are dead because of Dean. How many friends. It should remind him that all Cas got as a reward for helping them, for trying to save the world over and over again, is being half-broken, half-human and stuck in suburbia with Dean.
“More like, he knows where they’re likely to grow,” Missouri snorts. “Either way, they’ll give the stew new flavor and us new strength.”
Bucky and Dean worry him, though, even though nothing is outwardly wrong. But Dean seems to be seething with a quiet kind of anger and he’s throwing Bucky dark looks that make Steve wonder what happened between the two of them when they were outside.
“Not yet,” Dean shakes his head.
Dean refreshes the page and there are several new comments under angelheart’s. The first being:
“It’s not personal,” Dean interrupts before Cas can even finish the question. “There’s been a lot of
But Cas doesn’t seem to notice, instead he nods with a huff. “The lemonade is actually pretty good, you know.”
He can still hear Charlie’s voice, muttering something that sounds like
Cas’ eyes find his, searching his face with an intensity that’s unusual even for Cas. Finally, he gives Dean a small smile back, though his voice stays serious. “Always.”
Freaking angel doesn’t want to see what Dean is trying to do here. An idea forms in his mind and he tries to be as casual as he can when he finally says, “Okay, you know what… let’s flip a coin. Heads, you get the bed - tails, I get the bed. There is a 50 - 50 chance for both of us, Cas. It is only fair.”
