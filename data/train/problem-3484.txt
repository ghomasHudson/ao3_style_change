He tangles his feet around Dean’s and shifts his hips around until their erections are brushing up against each other. It takes a calculated effort, and maybe a little mojo, but soon enough their cocks are sliding together smooth with just enough lubrication. If Dean’s love truly is making his grace stronger, it seems fitting to use his power to help them express their love physically.
Castiel felt his cheeks turning red, heartbeat rattling in his chest. He had never realized Zachariah harbored so much resentment towards his father, himself, and...who was Joshua? A spike of self-awareness drifted through Castiel’s subconscious. The name sounded so familiar…
“I see him,” Bobby breathes on the other end, “him and Gabriel both. They’re roughed up, but alive.”
, it just happened, but it’s part of the story now and I don’t want to take it out.” He took a deep breath. Behind Dean’s head, Castiel and Anna craned their necks and exchanged a hopeful glance. Dean was a passionate, persuasive speaker—could he actually change Zachariah’s mind?
shower,” Dean explains, shuddering at the amount of dried blood still caked on his boyfriend’s torso. “I’ve seen you covered in enough blood to last a fucking lifetime.”
Castiel sighs, the pad of his thumb drawing soothing circles into Dean’s shin. “I’m feeling better today because your presence and scent soothe me, but I haven’t been around anyone else in a while. Not without getting violent or reacting unpredictably. I don’t trust that my—my alpha instincts won’t kick in tonight, won’t ruin the pack’s chance to make a deal because I’m feeling territorial and overprotective towards you.” It goes against every impulse, every instinct in his body, but he breathes in through his nose and continues. “Not to mention that, I know logically you can take care of yourself. You’re one of the most skilled fighters and cool-headed thinkers in a crisis. If I had to choose anyone to be on my team, it would always be you.”
“I’m glad to hear you say that, because their headliner pulled out for Monday’s event,” Castiel took a long sip of beer before continuing, “and I told her you’d fill in.”
“You look very arousing like this, Dean,” Cas says silky. “I can’t wait to see what you’re wearing underneath that robe…”
“Yes,” Dean whispered, lips muffled against Castiel’s neck, holding him tight. “That’s a definite, fucking yes.”
There’s a trickle of laughter around the table before Sam finally says, “We were just singing your praises as future packmaster.”
“This has been entertaining, but it’s time to move on. We have other books that are more pressing. Dean has one week to rewrite the book to my approval, or we’ll cancel it and his contract will be broken.”
Sage. It’s sweeter, still invigorating but more indulgent now, their combined scent reminiscent of a mint chocolate candy. But it’s still there, the soothing clarity of
The alpha finishes a moment after him, even popping a knot from their shared hasty handjob, which surprises Dean. Usually knots are reserved for full-on sex, aka, penetration—from what Dean has heard, at least. He’s never actually been knotted by an alpha before, only messed around with one, a god-awful experience that made him steer clear of alphas for years afterwards. He wonders why Cas’ body is having such a visceral reaction from rubbing one out…maybe it has something to do with the post-battle pheromones? Yeah, that’s gotta be it.
“Dad,” Dean breathes, and there’s a warning in his voice that Castiel can’t quite place. He gets the distinct feeling that Dean knows what this conversation will entail, but Cas has only
“Let me,” he said softly, elbow grazing Castiel’s as he made space for himself at the counter. He fiddled with the mechanism the same way Cas had done, then peered closer for a moment before pulling down a smaller latch in the back and successfully closing the top. He slid the mug under the spout and pressed the “brew” button, turning back to look at Cas, who had decided then and there that Dean Winchester was an absolute marvel.
“Nothing,” Castiel whispered, and Joshua’s eyebrows knit together in confusion, so Castiel raised his voice and continued. “There’s nothing you can do for me…I’d rather ask what I can do for you.”
When snowflakes begin to sprinkle down from the ceiling, a warm sun shining behind Dean’s head, the kids
“I really oughta do laundry and check in on Sammy…” He gave Castiel a shy glance. “You could come over, if you want.”
, is in town visiting me! We're basically gonna eat/drink/watch SPN the whole time, so… best. weekend. ever.
, his eyes even greener than the well-watered grass they’re currently flattening. Dean licks his lips and looks up at him, amused. “What’s up? Boycotting the word ‘hey’ or something?”
The omega looks at him in the dark, green eyes shining. Thanks to the bright moonlight and heightened were senses Castiel can see the man’s shape almost perfectly, can even spot the freckles scattered across his boyfriend’s cheekbones.
Dean wasn’t one to brag, but that dedication had been a great fucking idea. Possibly his best ever. He had woken up via blowjob for almost a week straight after Cas read that shit.
Here's a real conversation that just happened between my auction winner and my editor after reading this chapter:
she asks playfully, but Dean doesn’t get a chance to answer—it must’ve dawned on her, because suddenly she’s squealing. Loudly. In Dean’s ear. Or...brain.
Content warnings: Temporary Major Character Death (resolved within the chapter), Heavy Angst, Graphic Depictions of Violence
Dean looks up at him, eyes full of heat and want and mischief. “May I?” he asks, hoping that Cas will get what he’s referencing—that he’s been thinking nonstop about their first time in Purgatory, when Cas asked that same question before blowing Dean’s mind. If the spirited gleam in Castiel’s gaze is any indication, he knows exactly what Dean is doing. He wets his lips and nods, just like Dean did years ago, too overcome to speak.
There’s another person, bound like Castiel but also gagged. His eyes are closed shut, long hair messy, blood staining the front of his shirt.
his alpha to reconsider, to let him stay near. Dean was just about to slip some tongue in between Cas’ parted lips—sealing his rather effective argument—when Gabriel cleared his throat comically and nodded towards the open door. Dean pulled away, glaring, and watched his hurting alpha stumble out of the room without him.
“Dean...I like you like this,” Castiel whispered, hands roaming Dean’s thighs, his voice an inexplicable rumble.
…are immediate. He gasps, his veins at once icy and burning hot, the pain sharp and throbbing. His only clear thought, beyond
He hopes his little friend is getting a kick out of it. He/she/they had read Danielle Steel, apparently, so they’re no stranger to the genre. Dean had read
The next half-hour goes much more smoothly than the first. Dean and Castiel are not only more comfortable with each other, but approve of the song choice, and they sound…well, pretty damn good together. He’s actually looking forward to tomorrow’s concert now, which is a complete one-eighty from his earlier attitude. Jesus, what a rollercoaster day.
For a moment his vision went dark, black and fuzzy around edges. Then there was only the sound of a bookcase falling, the contents tumbling to the floor. He had to get the fuck out of here. He couldn’t face Sam or Jess or anyone who knew him, anyone who might try and talk this out. He needed to not exist, to erase himself and vanish, to run far enough that he couldn’t hurt anyone else. Anyone besides himself, that was, because
“No,” he says out loud, though he’s not entirely sure what he’s refuting. “No,” he says again, and it makes him feel better, so he repeats it again, embracing his own stubbornness. It’s the middle of the afternoon and he’s surprisingly been unbothered for that whole stretch of time, since Charlie and Sam and Madison taking over some of his duties as the unofficial pack mayor. They’ve tried to comfort Dean during the wait, urging him outside and asking him to come run errands with them, anything to keep him from fixating on his missing alpha. But Dean has been sulking and isolated, afraid to leave the cabin, worried he might not be here when Cas inevitably returns. The only productive thing he does do is finally fix Cas’ front door, which has been a thorn in his side for, what, a week now? Apart from that he sleeps in their bed and cradles Castiel’s pillow, seeking solace in his alpha’s scent, and passes most of his time in a sort of fever dream.
Dean’s baking process was long, but Castiel didn’t mind waiting. He hung out at the kitchen table with Sam and Jessica, drinking beer and playing cards. Dean’s expression was focused as he baked, not following an obvious recipe but reaching for ingredients on instinct. Interestingly enough, it was similar to his writing process—utter creative chaos, which stressed Castiel out to no end.
“Isn’t it unwise to drink during a hunt, anyways?” Castiel said, a question he had intended to ask Sam before he had gotten so distracted back at the motel. Distracted by Dean, and the clothes he was wearing, and the way he had looked at Castiel…
“I’m not,” Dean grunts lowly in response, and Sam looks up, eager for Dean to finally share his feelings, “…
“I understand your hesitancy. I intended to come here and convince you to help us. Dean is…” He breathed deeply, biting his lip, and took the plunge. “He’s the man I love. The person I’d do anything for. But if you meant what you said about considering me your family, then...” He pulled his hands from his pockets and waved them around, losing his train of thought, attempting to push through. “Chuck was like a father to me and he saw something in you. Enough to keep in touch, to divulge all his burdens. And I would like to know that man. As a person, as a friend, as a—” He felt sweat creep against his collar, his voice shaking. “As a brother.”
“That…” He shudders as Cas nips at his earlobe, wrist flicking around his cock and gathering beads of precome to stroke him more smoothly. “Feels amazing.”
“Like I have no control over my emotions, my actions.” Castiel’s voice is ragged now, his breathing uneven. “Right now…right now I want to break something. I want to punch Sam in the stomach even though I know that’s illogical, that he was doing the right thing by helping you. I want to bend you over the coffee table and pump you full of my seed again and again and again, want to watch you get round and full and pregnant even though you shouldn’t, not right now. I want to kill Azazel with my bare hands, to feel his bones snap, to see his blood. I want to leave and never come back. I want to hide away in bed with you and never enter the outside world again.” He covers his face with his hands, shuddering. “I’m afraid I’m no use to you right now, Dean. Not like this.”
“Castiel,” he responds, shaking the man’s outstretched hand. “I heard a little about you last night. You’re a lawyer?”
And there it is, Castiel’s cue. He walks to the pyre, and—no longer perfumed in the irritating, chemical spray—Dean is immediately struck by Castiel’s scent. He puts down all his carefully placed guards and allows it to flood his system, the aroma unbearably rich and chocolatey, like a cocoa bean split open and nestled in sugar. His mouth dries, his floppy pink tongue hanging from his panting jaw. He wants to get closer to that mouth-watering fragrance, to
Sammy. Old dog, new trick…you know how it is.” Then he reaches into the fridge, grabs them both a Margiekugel so cold the glass is frosted, and they sit together in comfortable silence until it’s time to grab four fitful hours of sleep.
“The best thing I can do for you is to stay here.” John’s tone is resolute, firm. “Let Castiel be packmaster—mate him, have a family, enjoy your life. Forget about me and just be happy.”
There are also two human men sitting between the alphas, nondescript white guys with unkempt brown hair. Dean finds them both vaguely familiar….
The commute to Chuck’s apartment took longer than usual. It was a bright and early Sunday morning and Castiel scowled at the autumn sky. It felt cruel that life was still continuing while his newfound happiness was on the precipice of crumbling. Castiel stuffed his hands into his trenchcoat and cast a worried glance at Dean, who hadn’t said much all night...just poured himself glass after glass of Maker’s Mark while staring at the floor.
Jody’s eyes widen. “You can’t be serious.” When neither of them refutes her claim, she leans over her stack of paperwork looking incredulous. “You want me to go on a date with a demon…
Dean leaned against his desk and closed his eyes. “You want me to what...break up with Cas? So you can get his undivided attention? Are you a psychotic, twelve-year-old girl?”
“Somebody’s skittish,” Castiel breathed playfully, kissing and nipping the globes of Dean’s ass. “Or just daydreaming?”
“Uh, yeah, will do,” Dean said, face turning red. Cas tilted his head, probably wondering what could possibly be happening
“Not at all. It was my birthday and she was the DD. To be honest—” she leaned into the couch, a frown on her lips “—she really didn’t even want to be there. She hates dancing, especially at places like Holy Grail. It’s not her scene.”
“Cas,” he whimpers out, trying to warn his alpha, but it’s no use. He comes explosively, all over his hand and the sheets, and then the alpha’s knot is swelling and he’s pumping him full. It’s a newly familiar and still thrilling sensation, being stuffed with a knot, and Dean tries not to think about the come filling him, about satiated and happy he feels. “Fuck, that was…”
“When did the attack happen?” Cas asked, clearly attempting to steer the conversation back into familiar territory. “After Aaron’s boyfriend left?”
intended to return to Tennessee, and only agreed because Anna and Chuck spoke so highly of Dean. But Castiel was forming a different opinion. Either Dean was a rude asshole, or he was in such a state of disorder that he had forgotten about their meeting. Whatever it was had Castiel fuming. He packed up his computer, slung his messenger bag over his shoulder, and walked towards the door.
“Oh, uh…okay.” Dean accept the phone, heavy and wider than his own, feeling disconcerted as Jimmy watches him with fascinated eyes. “Hello?”
Two decades ago he had been gawky and fourteen, sporting a mop of unruly brown hair and sitting in the pew of his mother’s church. He was alone, quiet—how he spent every biweekly occurrence at church, sulking and withdrawn. It was an early Sunday morning and service hadn’t yet begun, so Castiel let his eyes and mind wander, catching Raphael’s gaze down at the altar.
With another flash of light, there are four new occupants in the ring, the alphas surrounded at every angle. Dean didn’t believe he could feel any
Dean sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “What are the consequences, exactly? Of breaking the contract?”
“He is,” Dean says instantly, meaning it with every ounce of conviction he’s got. “He’s going through a lot right now and isn’t really himself, but—but he’s—” He pinches the bridge of his nose, feeling a whole host of unwanted emotion burning the back of his throat. “He’s fucking amazing.”
the contract? Really read it? Or how about when I asked if Sam would read it and offer you legal council? Did you ever even ask him about it?”
He reaches for the alpha’s injured hand, plopping the ice pack onto the swollen knuckle. Castiel winces and pulls back, but Dean keeps his grip firm. The alpha growls in a way that sounds involuntary but Dean can’t help glaring at him.
“These weren’t even Chuck’s wishes,” he said vehemently. “I know that for a fact.” The service had just ended and they were buckling up in Anna’s car, about to head towards the burial site. Apparently Chuck had requested a day of greasy food, cheap bourbon, and classic rock. Dean thought that was maybe the best fucking combination he had ever heard of, and he obviously had to steal this idea for his own funeral...but one look at Cas’ downcast eyes and he decided to keep his opinion to himself. Dean gazed at his boyfriend empathetically, feeling the need to comfort him, to make this better somehow. He leaned forward from the backseat and found Cas’ hand. Anna started the ignition and joined the funeral procession line, heading for the cemetery and shaking her head.
The door flew open and there he was, wearing a mockingly pleasant expression on his face. He was dressed in his standard dark suit and silver tie, despite the early Sunday morning meeting, and Castiel irrationally despised him for it and his inability to act even remotely human.
Dean downed the rest of his whiskey in one gulp. Then he put the glass down with a sigh, as if he had just made a decision.
“You would be amazed at all the things I know,” Crowley says offhandedly, though he’s distracted now, rummaging inside his pockets. His phone is buzzing—Dean can hear it thanks to their close proximity. “Duty calls, ‘m afraid. Feel free to take a moment, debate my offer amongst yourselves, while I take this call.”
Dean didn’t acknowledge he was being lowered to the bed until he felt the dip of a mattress beneath him. The laid-out notecards folded under them, wrinkling and bending under their weight. He already missed the feeling of Castiel’s hands on him, but Cas was busy untying Dean’s shoes and unbuttoning his jeans, fondling the cotton of his t-shirt, effectively slipping off Dean’s clothes with a sensual drag of his fingers. Dean just laid there, breathing in and out his nose, trying to remain in the experience with Cas and not slip inside his head again. Castiel surprised him then by stripping off his tight boxers, the sweep of the elastic band against his aching cock making Dean moan without warning. Castiel raised an eyebrow and Dean smiled sheepishly, letting out a mumbled “sorry.”
“Oh, Dean, you charming little wolf,” she purrs, her red-tinted lips pulled into a smirk, “you know I always try and impress the infamous Winchesters.”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel replies, grinning now as he takes his seat. He’s placed right beside Dean, which is ideal, but they’re in a crowded trailer full of people, which is…not.
“When I thought about leaving you again...I couldn’t.” Dean could feel Castiel exhale, the airflow tickling Dean’s neck. Dean’s hands gripped Cas’ wrist, rubbing his thumb absently, his heartbeat pulsing loudly in his ears.
“So responsive,” Castiel says approvingly, and he reaches forward to turn the door knob. They stumble into the covered porch kissing again, Dean barely coherent enough to remember to close the door behind them. They separate long enough to push the cover off the hot tub and go up the steps, but as soon as the jets are on and they’re both in the hot and steamy water, their lips find each other again. Dean floats into Castiel’s lap, their hard cocks occasionally brushing in a way that feels startlingly good. But then Castiel switches their position, Dean hovering in the water as Castiel floats down in front of him, hands reaching around to Dean’s ass. He’s not entirely sure what Cas has planned until he feels his cheeks separate, one of Castiel’s fingers circling his rim.
Lost in his thoughts, Castiel nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt someone touch him from behind, sliding hands around his hips. He whirled around and faced Dean, who had somehow returned to the room without Castiel noticing.
“Yeah,” Dean answers, and his voice sounds scratchy and dry. “He was just trying to look out for me. For both of us.”
“My house,” Castiel rasps, unwilling to cross this boundary and alter their relationship while the entire pack stands only yards away, undoubtedly eavesdropping. They need privacy, they need seclusion, they need…
The bartender threw his dishrag over his shoulder, then pulled up a stool. Dean and Cas followed, sitting across from him at the bar.
When they crossed the threshold, Castiel struggled not to gasp. He had spent many nights at Chuck’s apartment, discussing books over drinks, sharing cigarettes on the balcony, even ordering takeout and losing themselves in a good movie. Now everything was in boxes, a moving crew taping up cardboard and hauling trash bags, the landscape of Chuck’s home startling and barren.
“That wouldn’t happen if you’d let Alfie drive you more places,” Charlie pointed out, but before Dean could argue that only douchebag celebrities demanded to be driven around, she was already ushering him into his clothes fitting. Next was hair and makeup in his makeshift dressing room, where his rough morning started to turn around for a moment. He felt lulled by the familiar motion of having his face touched and prodded (he still remembers his first modeling gig ever, feeling loose powder on his face and whispering in horror, “I’m a painted whore”).
Shout-out to my beautiful, Book Club betas for their extra helpful feedback on these next few chapters!
“That bullshit has Zachariah written all over it,” she muttered, and Castiel tightened his grip on Dean’s hand, nodding. Dean squeezed his hand in response and they shared a small smile. It was a relief to be intimate again, even in such a small way. They hadn’t been affectionate around each other all day, not even around the handful of Cas’ coworkers Dean had met today (his two favorites being Hannah, who seemed sweet but clever, and Balthazar, who was certainly...entertaining). For his part, Dean was more than willing to show anyone and everyone he was
“Heard the name once or twice,” Crowley says noncommittally. He takes a deep breath, looking between the four men. “Allow me to speak in hypotheticals for you, gentlemen. Or gentle-wolves? Do you have a preference?” When no one answers his question, Crowley shrugs carelessly. “Imagine I wanted a certain demon…off the gameboard. Imagine I wanted a powerful ally to do the deed, maybe someone who wouldn’t mind getting his hands dirty so none of this…unpleasant business…could be traced back to me. Perhaps I would reach out to the leader of the largest werepack in Kansas. Someone who, I knew for a fact, my enemy also wants dead.”
“Your group project presentation will be due in two weeks’ time, just before your final portfolios,” he announced. “Any questions?”
“You okay?” Dean whispered, and Castiel nodded mutely. He wondered if Dean would be self-conscious later about holding his face this intimately in public, in front of all his friends and a few-dozen of his readers, none who knew yet that Dean was bisexual. Castiel should’ve been thoughtful enough to subtly push Dean away, and have this discussion later in privacy, saving Dean from potential embarrassment. But he had yearned for this
“We can wait,” Cas said, cool and casual. His eyes flickered to the bottle in Dean’s hand. “You haven’t finished your beer.”
“Nope,” Charlie says with an amused scoff. “Not one bit. Pretty sure he would die from embarrassment if that video was ever leaked. Luckily only
“The sex magic or whatever,” Dean says in a rush, the surrounding blackness inside the Impala making him braver. “Is that why I can’t get you outta my head? Why I’m dying to…” He lets his sentence trail off, not sure either of them are ready for him to lay out all
Castiel takes a large, unwavering step forward, easing into the other alpha’s personal space with cool indifference. “Your son just risked his life to save yours,” he says coldly. “You should show him some respect.”
“Mmm,” Dean mutters, grinding his hips back and forth, just enough friction to make Castiel’s cock stand to attention, his breath catching in his throat. “Mornin’, sunshine.”
After he had ranted an adequate amount of time, Dean leaned forward on the couch in Bobby’s office, staring at the clock on the wall. His therapist watched him impassively, looking between him and the clock, both of them silent. Finally, he leaned back into his recliner said, “Got somewhere better to be, son?”
“No one as good as you,” she said simply. She took a step forward, eyes fixed and unyielding. “I don’t need to remind you what will happen if Dean fails to submit his manuscript...do I? Or have you already forgotten Zachariah’s new contract, the one he made all our authors sign—the outrageous termination fees? The publisher’s retainment of rights? It’s bullshit, Cas. It’s highway robbery at best. Dean could lose everything.”
Dean rolled his eyes. Admitting this was hard enough—now his supposedly brainiac of a brother couldn’t pick up on context clues. “Jesus, Sammy, should I draw you a diagram?” he said. “We-we got...physical. Okay?”
“Jesus fuck...” Dean’s voice was rough and wrecked and Castiel pumped him faster, watching Dean’s reaction and getting even more turned on by it. “Please don’t stop.”
“Understandably. You and Sam are both wonderful,” Castiel says, using that confident tone that Dean’s come to think of as uniquely Cas. He has a way of implying that his compliments to Dean aren’t opinions, but facts, and it’s absurd and awesome and embarrassing as hell. Even with their clothes firmly on, Cas makes Dean’s stomach somersault.
Castiel breathed against Dean’s neck, trying to calm down. His hands were still wrapped around the man’s hips, partly in a honorable way—hoping to keep the man safe and steady—and partly…
“What this lovely little stalk of Minnesotan sweet corn is trying, and failing miserably, to ask,” Crowley interjected, “is if you and your navy-suited doppelgänger over there are doing the manky panky, enjoying the back passage, fondling each other’s dangly bits?”
adorable if he wasn’t so rude. “So, we’ve been discussing song selection with both of your managers, and they’ve explained you’re both willing to perform just about anything as long as rehearsal goes well today. Is that still the case?”
“No, Cas, just let me say this.” He took a deep breath. “Whatever I said, I guarantee I didn't mean it. I say dumbass shit when I’m drunk—you can ask Sam, it’s what I do. So whatever I said, I was
.” Castiel tried not to laugh. He knew it was an actual newspaper in Virginia, which is why Dean had settled on it for their alias, but it was almost too tongue-in-cheek—even for Dean. “We’re doing a piece on local, historical families. We’d love to ask you a few questions about one of your ancestors, Edward Lowry.”
“You really are insufferable,” Castiel panted, and Dean could tell by the tone in his voice that he was already close to coming. “Everything I tell you to do, you do the opposite.”
“Seriously?” Sam looks incredulous, eyeing the current mess on the floor, but Castiel pointedly avoids his gaze. “I’m here to help you, Cas. I’m here—” His face softens and Cas sees a flash of the young boy he knew growing up, the well-mannered bookworm always trailing him and Dean around. “I’m here to help you win.”
thought so. He still didn’t know enough about Dean’s inflections, his various tones and cadences, to say one way or another. Not knowing this bothered Castiel—in some ways he felt like he had known Dean for years. But in other, very real and unnerving ways, it felt like they were on a first date.
And then, with one final nuzzle into the warmth of Dean’s neck, he spins around on his paws and leaps off the porch steps, flinging himself into the early morning forest and obscure darkness.
“Dean would never do that unless he felt cornered. Unless…” The words returned to Castiel all at once.
“A deal with me requires something a bit more personal, bowlegged beauty,” he murmurs. “Though I don’t know if you’re at liberty to seal the deal.”
Dean cups his boyfriend’s jaw, staring into his eyes and pouring every ounce of love into the gaze. “A wedding.” Castiel’s mouth goes slack, a look of awe overtaking him. “Wanna make an honest packmaster outta me?”
“I’m going to kill you all,” Castiel growls, eyes struggling to see through the blindfold, and he hears Meg laugh raucously in his ear.
Castiel growls, half-asleep and cranky. “If it’s the same to you, I think I’ll skip today’s showing.”
It seems to take the alpha longer than usual to process the request, but after a long pause he’s gliding Dean backwards and into his lap. They both moan at the sudden adjustment, and Dean swings his left leg over so he can straddle his boyfriend properly. The new angle hits his prostate
“Yeah?” Dean swiped precome from the tip then put both hands flat against the mattress. He was close already, but he wanted to come on Castiel’s cock. “Show me what you got...”
“You could say that.” There’s a pause, as if Castiel is trying to decide if he should elaborate. “I think often about life, and choices, and free will. And meeting you seemed…” Castiel chuckles lightly on the other end. “Serendipitous, to say the least.”
Maybe it was the confidence boost he had received from the reading. Or his newfound assurance that Cas would be receptive towards his feelings. But whatever it was, Dean brushed his lips against Castiel’s ear and whispered, “Go get ‘em, handsome.”
“Didn’t look that way when you locked me out of the bathroom,” Dean reasoned, taking his first sip of coffee. “Uh, you’re right—not great coffee.”
“We need to splint your hand still,” he groans, annoyed at himself for forgetting. Castiel has removed the makeshift dressing and it’s swollen and red.
The whole crew, minus Charlie, loaded up and into the Impala without any additional fanfare. Dee was sitting in her carseat, wedged between her parents, and she made goofy faces at Dean in the rearview mirror. The grown-ups chatted about the after party and the weather, but halfway to Nashville Dee grew ravenously hungry and Sam and Jess searched the diaper bag for stray snacks. Dean took the moment of distraction to slid a soothing hand on Castiel’s thigh, giving him a wide, sideways smile.
Castiel, forever the direct communicator, responds eagerly with kiss…and Dean knows without a doubt that this will be one of those moments he relives, over and over again, in heaven. After he lives out a long and happy life, of course, as a brother, husband, and—
Dean sighs with relief, feeling a little foolish. “So, I’m not like, under your spell or something?”
“Just remember the conditions of our deal,” he says, eyes flashing at Bobby, and the elder nods with obvious irritation. “You’ll be seeing me again one day. Now, who’s walking me over to the Moose’s house to fetch the gun?”
“Fluency in Enochian comes in handy more often than you would think,” Cas is saying as they’re walking towards the exit. He opens the outer door and Dean steps through first, hands in his pockets. For the past few minutes he’s had difficulty concentrating on anything Castiel is saying, his adrenaline in overdrive as he thinks about what comes next for them. “—which is why I doubt the existence of them, but haven’t discarded the probability altogether.”
“Well, the way I see it,” Zachariah began flippantly, as if they were debating something subjective and frivolous, “Castiel may find it romantic at first…maybe he’ll even love you for it. But he will eventually resent you. In this scenario, he lost his career because you were too proud to compromise—any idea what that does to a relationship? Here’s a hint. You eventually break-up. Afterwards, he works a soul-crushing job but still can’t afford his rent. Maybe he becomes homeless again. Speaking of—” Zachariah’s pitch took on an excitable quality, as if he had just thought of something
By the time Dean parked the Impala, a large crowd had already gathered outside the Holy Grail. A makeshift stage had been assembled from a long cut of plywood, where everyone was gathered. Just outside the club entrance, where the bouncer usually checked IDs, there was a table filled with photographs: Sarah Blankschaen and her girlfriend, Aaron Samuels and his friends. The photos made Dean’s inside ache. He had seen so many deaths, many that he could’ve prevented...if only he had be quicker or smarter or stronger. If only he could have saved them all.
“Apologies...we didn’t mean to ambush you,” Castiel said genuinely. “We just have an important matter to discuss with you, and we preferred having this conversation in person.” Cas took a small step forward, extending his hand. “I’m Castiel Novak. I am...
“Not to mention,” Sam says, with some finality in his voice, “that Rowena said Dean technically entered and won the third trial when he killed Azazel and prevented the gates from opening. So, there’s
“Snakes.” Cas looked strangely proud of himself. “According to Samuel L. Jackson, that would make the flight significantly worse.”
“Following the tradition of packmaster weddings, which dictates that the pack and their friends are influential in this union, we now invite everyone to approach. Each of the best men are holding baskets of ties and garland, such as vines and flowers, which have been spelled for elasticity and strength. Please knot your offering to the larger thread, held first by Dean and Castiel, and we will conduct the Gaelic and Celtic gesture of handfasting the bonds of their union.”
Dean had no idea who this woman was—Missouri, apparently—but hey, if she was helping their cause, Dean was grateful. Hell, if she could convince Joshua to help them, Dean would invite her to Thanksgiving dinner.
“Do you…” Pamela tries to keep her voice level, but Castiel can hear the uneasy shake, the hesitation there. “Do you have any interest in the claim?”
She just stares up at him, knowing how uneasy he is but not offering him an olive branch of conversation.
“Reba McEntire, Jason Isbell, Carrie Underwood, Tim McGraw,” Sam provides, as if he’s memorized the freaking lineup. When everyone gives him a look, he flushes red, the nerd, and adds, “Uh, just to name a few.”
“There’s something that I need to tell you, Dean.” He looks down at his feet, seeming smaller and more nervous than Dean’s ever seen him. “I should’ve told you earlier, but we were having such a good time, and I didn’t want to…change your opinion of me…”
“What are you two doing here so early?” Charlie shouted. Realizing she had essentially asked them both to speak, she quickly added, “Don’t answer that question!”
But honestly though, I am still REELING from my first convention experience. It was freaking amazing.
Dean let himself be drawn forward, hands finding the dip in Castiel’s lower back. Cas gripped Dean’s neck, bringing their foreheads together.
“Didn’t know you ‘ready knew about that,” Dean muttered. The thought that Joshua was already aware of his father’s will and was simply rejecting it…
“I’m gonna need more details.” Castiel kissed the inside of Dean’s thighs lightly, purposefully avoiding his cock. “You
“Yeah.” She drops her iPad lightly on the counter and takes a step forward, bracing her hands on either side of Dean’s shoulders. “Can I ask
There’s a dip in the mattress, a knee falling in between legs, Castiel partially straddling in. “Are you not enjoying yourself?” he says, bending down to kiss at the back of Dean’s neck.
The rest of the day is chaotic. Anytime he braves the hallway there are books hovering and flying every which way. Jo’s book nearly smacks her in the forehead, and she groans when she sees it’s
“Is that so?” Castiel whispers, licking his lips away with the last trace of Dean’s blood, and the omega only gapes at him. He’s never known any mated couples who could do
“I hardly think you need to go on a diet,” Castiel says, unable to keep the defensiveness out of his voice.
Then each night, after Dean has spent the day as the unofficial go-to guy of every imaginable pack problem, they reconvene down by the brush. They strip their clothes—though they have to do so several yards away, or else they might get
“You should eat something,” the alpha whispers, the only one in this chaotic breakfast to notice that he hasn’t made himself a plate yet. Dean bristles, holding up his piping hot cup of coffee. “I’m good,” he dismisses, but when Cas looks at him doubtfully, he adds in a quiet tone, “I wanna make sure there’s enough for everyone else first.”
Castiel swayed, suddenly lightheaded. He read the letter again, heart racing, before reaching across the table and pulling out his phone.
has an equally wicked sense of humor. Rather than sending a paper note, a spelled sentence appears in the air in front of Dean’s face, the careful cursive flowing into the air:
thank you for gathering. I am John Winchester, alpha of this pack and Second to the recently fallen packmaster, Chuck Novak.” A hush falls over the crowd and Castiel can feel his heart rattling in his chest. “We meet this evening to shephard our pack into a new era of leadership.”
Dean clamped his mouth shut. He didn’t want to incriminate himself or Cas if Zachariah was somehow bluffing.
“I have no clue,” Castiel whispers, hand traveling down towards Dean’s knee and squeezing. “I told you…I haven’t exactly embraced this ability. Each time is different.”
When enough fire has gathered on his torch, he holds it up triumphantly and scowls at the beast. The moment he steps beyond the Anasazi symbol he’s going to get ambushed, but all he has to do is plunge the fire onto the wendigo. He doesn’t allow himself time to think about it, to second-guess himself. He begins to sprint headfirst, and to his amazement the wendigo is now running
said” joke. But Castiel seemed to be in a stern mood, so he sipped his coffee and said, “Jesus, that seems daunting.”
“Easy?” Dean laughed darkly. “You think any part of that was easy? Groveling for you to publish my book, even though you clearly have some sort of vendetta against it?”
“Usually, yeah. But we’ve gotta try and become this thing’s next target.” Dean opened the car door and tossed the empty flask in the backseat.
Crowley is a pompous ass,” she read in a flat voice. “He seems to believe he’s charming and suave, but his facade only makes him look weak. If I had to guess, he’s probably the type of frail, pathetic man who would be useless in a crisis and afraid to get his hands dirty.”
He takes a step back, adjusting the tuning pegs. Without the full band behind him, this cover will sound much more like James Taylor than The Byrds, but he doesn’t care. In the back of his mind, he reminds himself that he was chastising Castiel Novak hours ago for his folksy sound, and here Dean is, singing an acoustic ballad. Maybe his hatred of the other man
“Apology accepted,” Gabriel answers, and Cas can practically hear the absurd grin on his brother’s face. He fights the urge to growl in irritation. “Jeez, lighten up bro. I can tell you’re brooding from over here.”
believe it. Do you really think you’re traveling across the country, to the home and undoubtedly glamorous apartment of your hot-as-sin boyfriend, and not getting blown to smithereens?”
A half hour later they both receive a text from Charlie’s automated system. Even though the message makes his stomach sink, Cas can’t help but be proud of Charlie for ushering the community into the twenty-first century:
Fact is, if Rowena had followed through with her duty to the pack all those years ago, if her protective enchantments hadn’t fallen at just the
“By a ‘step back,’ do ya mean…” Dean pauses for dramatic effect, his eyebrows wagging suggestively, and Castiel chuckles and looks away, his face flushed.
“All I’m saying is that I’m in this.” He reached his palm forward on the table, open and exposed. “If you’ll have me.”
Castiel’s knot swelled up with such intensity that Dean choked and sputtered, spit dripping from the corners of his mouth, tears forming in the creases of his squinting eyes. He tried to dislodge the cock from gagging him but in the process, Castiel’s come covered Dean’s lips and chin. Once he recovered and breathed again, Dean parted his lips and swiped at the white hot stripes of come adorning his face. He was like a gorgeously obscene portrait of love and lust and want, and Castiel watched the sight through his blurry vision.
“Noted,” the guy says, that mischievous glint in his eyes making Dean’s insides turn to jello. “I’m Castiel.”
come spilling all over his belly. His orgasm had built-up so powerfully than his brain couldn’t process it, and wow, that hadn’t happened in a long fucking time. He breathed through the aftershock and looked up at Castiel, wanting to witness the moment his normally buttoned-up boyfriend lost control. He barely had to wait at all, though, as Castiel’s hips halted suddenly and his head fell back, gripping Dean with a prolonged moan and falling forward into the bed.
“What’s Cas been writing about me?” he asked boldly, wondering if he took a sudden approach if Charlie would slip-up and spill all her secrets.
“You already know,” John says evenly, calling Dean’s bluff just as the omega knew he would. It makes him blush like a damn idiot. Apart from a nun or a priest or his kindergarten teacher, there’s literally no one on this earth he’d enjoy discussing this with
Castiel exhales shakily and tries not to shiver. Dean pulls away slowly but hovers, as if he’s going to kiss him right here, right now, and Castiel leans in and—
“So, just to summarize,” she said, taking a long sip from her coffee mug, “you and Dean interacted outside of the study, though totally by accident. You kissed outside a bar, and now...”
Abby was projecting some heavy, hostile alpha vibes and it made Dean’s eyes water. He instinctively leaned closer into Cas, hoping the sweet sugar aroma would overpower his senses. With a flourish Abby opened her folder and shot Charlie a sharp look, then laughed without humor and pulled the microphone towards her. “
He exited Alfie’s car but asked him to wait in the driveway. He knew this conversation could go several different ways, and he might need a quick getaway if Dean chased him off the farm with a shotgun. Not that he could entirely blame him, but still. He scanned the area, looking for Dean. His eyes finally settled on the goat pen, and there he was—handling bales of hay effortlessly, shoulders wide and sheening sweat. The front of tank top was clinging to his torso, and his loose jeans were snug around his hips. Castiel’s mind went blank, his mouth fuzzy and dry. There was
“I didn’t realize public sex was so enticing to you, Dean,” he says cheekily, voice low and teasing.
“Hey fellas,” Missouri greets, short and feisty with a gleaming white smile. “Have to say, I’m a big fan of you both. Dean’s a veteran around here, but we’re excited to have some fresh blood this time around.” She gives Castiel another signature smile and he can’t help it—his bad mood lessens slightly.
The guy—he oughta use that penny of his to buy himself a clue—puts his hand on Dean’s elbow. “I’m Dick.”
Crowley smirks happily. “I’ll let the ‘two-faced bitch witch’ speak for herself, actually.” He looks over his shoulder, and the petite redhead ducks from behind a bookshelf, a long, sweeping black gown gathering at her heels. Dean’s shoulders tense—thanks to her, Cas was kidnapped and almost killed—and reaches backwards towards the hutch, fumbling for the stray gun hidden in a drawer.
“Let’s go,” he commands without preamble. “It’s a fourteen hour drive, but we gotta make it in thirteen. Twelve if we can swing it.”
Dean had been acting strangely since the bartender, Leo, had assumed they were gay. Castiel didn’t understand Dean’s unease with homosexuality, considering angels don’t identify with any particular gender or sexuality. Honestly, he thought Dean’s hang-ups were quite juvenile, but didn’t see any reason to start an argument when things were already tense.
) and evenings spent with Sam and Jess, playing games and watching movies. Despite all the work he was doing in frantic attempts to meet his manuscript deadline, this was the happiest Dean could ever remember being. He tried not to watch the calendar, to countdown how many days he had left with Cas before they became long-distance. Or...what, exactly? Just friends again? Strangers? The uncertainty of it all caused Dean to worry, though just privately, since moments without Cas were becoming few-and-far between. He tried not to get used to Cas’ constant company, his comfort and companionship. Everyone he cared about had a tendency to eventually leave him or move on with their lives. Odds were, Cas would one day do the same.
“Cas, where you and me are concerned…I’m in this,” he admits, and it’s the closest thing to a love confession he’s willing to risk right now, but it’s still
“You gotta be fucking kidding me,” he grumbles out, and Castiel chuckles beneath him. “I’ll get that, but just, uh, don’t go anywhere, okay?”
“Uh, yeah, a little,” Dean admits with a chuckle. “You’re kinda one of the most famous people ever right now.”
Dean shrugs, nonplussed by the news. “Makes sense.” He takes another long swallow from his cup, and when he glances back up from the dark brew, Sam is staring at him with a measured scowl. A classic bitch face.
Dean cleared his throat, mumbling something about not getting his standard three hours of sleep, then ranted about how the motel lobby had been out of coffee that morning. Sam narrowed his eyes skeptically, but when the front door finally opened and the grieving girlfriend answered the door, he turned to her and frowned sympathetically. They pulled out their FBI badges and she stepped out of the doorway, inviting them inside.
“I know all this sucks, it really fucking sucks, but—” The omega looks at him pointedly, chest puffed out, seeming to regain some of his composure. “It hasn’t been a picnic carrying all this crap around, y’know. Maybe I would’ve told you sooner if I knew you weren’t gonna go all…”
“Not needed,” Dean quips back hoarsely. He’s half-hard now, Castiel can feel the weight of his cock pressed into his thigh.
“Right,” Castiel agrees, the corners of his mouth twitching upwards. “I barely lasted a semester before I dropped out. I moved to Nashville to try and find an agent, and my parents were horrified, but figured it was a phase. I played at hundreds of open mic nights, dozens of street corners. I was visiting Gabriel two years later at his insistence when, as you mentioned, I met an agent at a party in the Hampton’s, completely surreptitiously, of course. He was only interested because of my family name, but once I played for him, he seemed more inclined to help me launch my career.”
It was an unremarkable Wednesday night, three weeks later, when it happened. Sam was taking Jessica to a concert that night, so they were free to spend some time at Cas’ place instead of their usual “family” time. Dean came over after work to fix his boyfriend’s dishwasher, which was old and on its last leg. Castiel didn’t care about repairing the appliance, but Dean had insisted in that thoughtfully persistent way that brokered no argument. Castiel was thinking about ordering them pizza whenever he rounded the corner—having been instructed to go grab a pair of pliers from the trunk of the Impala—and Dean was bent over, ass up and presenting, tight and round and simply
“Waffles,” Dean comments, amazed as he eyes a square stack of fluffy-as-fuck belgians plated on the counter. His stomach growls, and his gawking continues until he spots the skillet… “And bacon?
“Still chatty as ever,” Bobby says, and Cas realizes the pack elder must have been speaking to him, tossing him an olive branch of “welcome home” chit-chat. The alpha flushes, embarrassed to be so lost in thought.
and let him drive them to New York City instead. ‘Cause seriously...what the fuck was Dean thinking, casually buying a plane ticket?
With Cas in his life, he wasn’t trying to plan too far into the future or make himself any promises…. Especially since the thought of one day selling his portion of the farm and moving to be with Cas had been crossing his mind a lot lately. But could he even live in a place that he hated, a place where he didn’t fit in? And would Cas even want him to make such a long-term gesture? Dean shook his head, staring at the back of Cas’ head and wishing he was standing beside him.
smell. He doesn’t have to run far, since Dean is jogging towards him in the dark. He squats low after a few feet and waits for Castiel to come to him, and the wolf does, whining the minute he’s close enough to rub his flank against Dean’s shin.
He tries to make up for it now by giving Cas a mindblowing orgasm. He sucks fiercely as his mouth tightens around the intrusion, his tongue finding a pulsing vein at the underside of Castiel’s cock and lapping around it. Castiel’s hands find his hair, long fingers threading through and tightening, and Dean growls around the dick in his mouth to show how
“You did it again,” he says accusatorily, shaking his head. “Charlie, what the hell? You can’t keep telling me these meetings are fifteen minutes
Then there’s only the cold surface the knife as it slashes across, and he releases a held breath, blood dripping down with the density of a fallen curtain. Absurdly, he tries to mop it up with his hands, but his eyes are closing on instinct and he plummets towards the earth, shoulders slumped and body trembling. Strangely he feels very little pain, only an uncomfortable wetness and vague sense of alarm, and he’s wondering if Rowena’s cut wasn’t actually fatal whenever he feels frigid immobility weighing down his limbs. Then he’s no longer moving, no longer thinking or blinking or breathing, he’s—
He had shifted back by then, perched on his knees and crying, completely naked, unable to take his eyes off the charred remains of his family. What followed was chaos—Chuck telling him goodbye and ordering Inias, a were only a few years older than Castiel at the time, to put the last surviving Novak pup on the first bus to Ohio. The fire was tempered by then, and Castiel had managed to put on clothes before being swept through the back door. He had screamed for Dean, searching for him despite Inias’ insistence that they should leave silently and not draw attention to themselves during battle.
Dean opened his mouth to argue, but evidently thought better of it. He examined Castiel closely, not only his face and clothes but his whole apartment, trying to make sense of the man he had essentially been silently dating for four months. Castiel allowed this without question, figuring they were used to it by now…staring at each other wordlessly, intently, like standing in front of a work of art and trying to decipher its meaning.
Castiel bites his lip, looking around the empty meadow nervously. There are about ten round tables situated on the grass, half of them strewn with wrinkled tablecloths, and two buffet style food lines and he just realizes he has
They slowly started walking towards the Impala. Their hands were dirty and sweaty, but entwined together all the same.
Castiel hums in agreement, unsure of what else to say. They start heading towards the center of the compound, to a small but handsome cabin with a wraparound porch. “Was this my father’s house?”
Castiel instinctively scrunched his face up in protest, then swayed and grew dizzy. Given his current state, he decided that denial wasn’t his best course of action. “So are you,” he accused instead, and Dean shrugged.
But on the other hand, he knew the scent blockers they were swimming in might be his biggest clue...
“Dean!” Sam’s voice is laced with concern, his large palm shaking Dean by the shoulder. “C’mon, wake up!”
Dean entered the dance floor. He ran a hand through his hair nervously, his eyes adjusting to the dark. The inside seemed the same—the caged-in DJ booth, the high-rise platforms, the corner bar. He spotted the same bartender, Leo, mixing a cocktail, a dishcloth tossed carelessly over his shoulder.
There’s an arachne in one corner. It’s in the shape of man, average build and height. Looks can be deceiving, though, ‘cause that fucker is definitely a spider-like creature with white eyes, light blue irises, and black pupils. His skin is crusty and flaking and he’s grinning, probably gearing up to spin his first web, to trap Cas so he can bite him—kill him, turn him, whatever seems most fitting to his fucked-up brain.
“Dean,” Castiel whispered reverently, removing his fingers and craning Dean’s neck, searching for his lips. Dean kissed him back, using his tongue to tease open Castiel’s mouth. He already missed the feeling of fullness from Castiel’s fingers. “Fuck me, please,” he growled, and sighed in relief when he heard a zipper being dragged, followed by the rustling of clothes. Dean breathed into the brickwall, anticipating Castiel’s next move, listening to the familiar sound of lube being generously applied to his boyfriend’s cock. He felt the tip first, accompanied by a burning throb that didn’t feel too uncomfortable, so Dean begged for more. Castiel moaned and slammed into him fully, but stayed stationary behind him, unwilling to move until Dean had adjusted. Dean breathed through the pulsing pain, knowing the discomfort would be replaced soon by insane waves of pleasure.
It had been difficult to nap after that, but they would undoubtedly survey Charlie’s gifts later. They needed a little rest before meeting Anna in Greenwich Village for drinks.
“Light expands in our world, right? Luminosity weakens the farther it travels, but light itself stretches twice as far as the original source—”
“How do you know it’s only been a few weeks?” The fact that this demon knows so much about his personal life is unnerving as hell.
Dean took a deep breath, wondering what to say and where to start. Maybe a lighthearted “I totally wanna bone you” would break the tension? Or a super dramatic “hey, I know you’re a thousand-year-old celestial being, but I might be in love with you, wanna head back to the bunker and cuddle”?
He needs to hear his alpha’s voice, needs to wrap him up into a hug, needs to keep him safe from every ounce of danger…
“Get your lazy ass out here!” Sam called, his voice ringing loud and playful. Dean just tossed him a “maybe later” wave of the hand, and popped open the cooler, pulling the coldest Margiekugel from its sheath of melting ice. The sun was high and unyielding above, the sky void of any potential cloud cover. It was a warm day for their little slice of coastal California, close to eighty degrees, and Dean could feel his neck growing red with heat—the span of his shoulders glowing with tones of muted pink. Despite working outside all day, his back and shoulders were always covered by his uniform. But after a couple hours at Coyote Point Park, Dean would undoubtedly be left with a sunburn.
Castiel instinctively wrapped his hand around Dean’s length, stroking him at the same merciless speed Dean had been setting. Dean shut his eyes at Castiel’s touch. Suddenly he came, almost violently, practically convulsing on Castiel’s lap. Panting, he leaned his forehead against Castiel’s. Castiel drew soothing circles into his back, kissing softly at his neck.
At the mention of the packmaster competition, the awkwardness surrounding them seems to resettle. Dean tries not to look at his dad, but he can’t make himself stop.
“Will you take me into town tomorrow?” he asks the wolf, still rubbing his ears. “I need to pick up a few things.” He had flown in just this afternoon, and Bobby had promptly retrieved him from the Lawrence Municipal Airport. He needed a variety of things that he was either sure his father wouldn’t have, or he would feel strange about using secondhand.
“Well he is,” Dean snapped, color draining suddenly from his face. “I, I mean…” But the stranger was already gone, in search of other company. They stood together in silence before Castiel finally spoke.
“What about Azazel? The gates of hell? The danger any Novak will always be in?” Dean takes a step forward, voice breaking. “You’re just—what? Gonna check out? Let me deal with all that shit on my own?”
“Thank you,” he says, sounding a little more gruff than he means to. He’s not annoyed, just confused. There’s commotion going on near the door, the crowd pushing against itself to get closer to something or someone, and Dean’s curiosity is official piqued. “What’s going on back there?” he asks, trying to appear casual.
“Subtle,” Dean snorts with a shrug, not seeming to care one bit about the media circus. He looks over his shoulder at Castiel, giving him another lopsided smile. “You wanna get outta here?”
“Yeah, well, it’s a dumb rule,” Sam says weakly, but even he knows his argument is flimsy. Weres are deeply dependent on history and tradition, so fighting against the status quo doesn’t really get you anywhere in this society. Dean stands up and takes his plate to the sink, rinsing it off and sliding it into the dishwasher. He eyes the oil-filled skillets on the stove and the remaining dirty plates, rolling his sleeves up, but Sam nudges him on the elbow and shoos him away.
“Cas...” Dean moaned, pushing his hips further back with surprising fierceness, rubbing deeper and deeper. Castiel tightened his grip on Dean, a buildup growing between them as they rutted and panted and drew closer to the edge…
The words send a surge of confidence in Dean’s movements, and he takes a large and leaping step forward, pushing Castiel against the wall with more force than he meant to. Their bodies collide until they’re chest to chest, and they circle each other’s lips for a moment before Dean surges forward, kissing the breath out of him. Cas is already so turned on that he moans against Dean’s lips from a simple, closed-mouthed kiss, and it’s so fucking sexy watching Cas be so…human. Dean deepens the kiss instantly, slipping his tongue between Cas’ parted lips, and his own erection rubs against Cas’ thigh with delicious friction. He reaches his hand down, tenderly touching Castiel’s wrist along the way, and then he strokes the angel’s erection with a tight fist.
He had barely gotten through the third chapter before closing his computer, stepping away from his desk, and taking an unofficial sabbatical from writing. Or was in a resignation? A renouncement? He wasn’t quite sure.
It sounds so much like the prayers he heard every night as he ran, keeping the Leviathan occupied and leaving Dean room to fight off whatever else he came across. It sparked something new in Cas, that if they could overcome it—what happened in Purgatory last time and what happened after—then they could get through this. It would take time, and so much effort, but Cas would forgive and move on. All Dean had to do was ask. The open hostility had died down, making the necessary conversations easier. It wasn’t even close to their normal friendship, but it felt like a start.
Castiel closes the leather bound journal rigidly. His scent is suddenly so hostile and so furious, Dean feels like running in the opposite direction.
“Well, that apple shit is real. There’s a natural plant hormone called ethylene that literally forces certainly fruits to ripen. It’s pretty much poisonous if they’re in proximity to each other.” Castiel was looking at Dean with raised eyebrows, clearly impressed.
Dean’s a big deal too. Thing is, he doesn’t flaunt it. That Novak guy is some stupid folk singer playing a watered-down version of country, crooning into the microphone like some depressed teenager, and suddenly Dean’s music is “traditional” and “old school”?
“Yes, Dean, I like you,” Castiel says plainly, evidently just to appease Dean, but it feels amazing all the same. He pulls away from his constant kissing to look Dean square in the eye. “Even before I knew you, I liked you.”
“I’m interested in someone, too,” Castiel said. He looked down at the floor, not trusting himself to look up right now. If Dean looked half as inviting as Castiel imagined, then he might end up pushed against the bar, being kissing senselessly in front of the entire bar. Which Ellen might not appreciate. Or find very sanitary.
filled with holes.” Sam had cleaned up well, sporting a black button-up and slacks. Then again, Dean reminded himself, Sammy wore a monkey suit five days of the week—tonight was like casual Friday for him. Deanna was hoisted on his Sam’s hip, her light brown hair tied back in a bow, her expression soured.
Gabriel tips his head, winks at the box one more time, then saunters off the porch and out of sight. Dean lets out a relieved sigh, running a hand through his still-damp hair, and opens the fridge. He’s still freaking starving, and needs to do something to keep his hands busy, so he pulls out all the ingredients to make pancakes from scratch—milk, eggs, butter, and lots of dry baking ingredients he finds in the cabinet above the microwave. He’s stirring the concoction together, lost in thought, when he feels hands wrap around his waist. He experiences a millisecond of panic, but then Cas’ scent—which has somehow become their scent—crashes into him like a soothing wave.
Castiel looked at Dean with his nose crinkled. “Here?” he said, sweeping a long finger towards the river and the trees, and Dean nodded. “Why?”
“So you see now why we need you,” Dean finished. Joshua opened his mouth again, likely to protest, so Dean barreled on. “You’re a gardener, okay? You of all people should get it. ‘One bad apple spoils the barrel’ or whatever the hell the saying is—”
wasn’t about being taken care of. Instead, they would be partners who took care of each other. The power dynamics weren’t imbalanced in the ways he had subconsciously always feared—because he trusted Cas, and that trust would only grow with time. He leaned into the touch then, no longer feeling self-conscious for the tears, for the show of emotion. Though, if anyone but Cas decided to point out his crying, he was definitely not above kicking someone in the balls. Especially if that assclown Crowley decided to toss his two cents in.
“Dean…” Their lips were circling, the energy between them heavy and tense, the yearning for contact overwhelming Dean. They were so close now, both tilting their heads, coming closer and closer, wetting their lips, taking a breath and—
Dean places the acoustic guitar back on the stand with as much gentleness as he can muster, and then he’s pushing against the crowd, Benny following closely on his side. If he thought the bar populace was crammed together before, now it’s practically impossible to move, and Benny is struggling to keep people from tugging on Dean’s collar or stepping on his boots. This whole freaking night has become a big mistake, Dean thinks miserably, wanting nothing more than to be back in his private cabin on the mountain, away from this crowd, away from the hands grabbing him, away from Castiel fucking Novak.
“Dean…” He pulled away, glancing down at his feet and feeling suddenly uncertain. They hadn’t talked about it since that day, over a month ago outside the Roadhouse, the first time they had kissed. For weeks now the word
And then he joins his alpha in the shower, washing him and rinsing him clean. Cas must assume the tears in his eyes are nerves for the second trial, and when he holds Dean’s face between his hands and whispers, “I am so lucky to have you,” Dean buries his cry into his alpha’s neck, unable to look him in the eye. Rationally he knows the chances of him actually carrying a child right now are slim, but he can’t help mourning what could have been, can’t suppress a surge of frustration that their life together is being orchestrated in this way. Part of him yearns to tell Cas everything right this second, to unburden himself fully; but the other, less selfish and more empathetic side, knows this his burden to carry.
Joshua opened his mouth and then closed it, shaking his head as if he couldn’t engage in this argument with Missouri again. His interest turned to Castiel, a hand resting on his chin.
. They can’t just dive back into their relationship—uh, friendship—as if no time had passed. Besides, for all he knows Cas has settled down with a nice omega guy or gal and has a pup or two on the way. Just the thought sets his teeth on-edge.
Dean scoffed and took a step away from Castiel, feeling a blush form on his cheeks. “No, that’s…uh, that’s ridiculous.”
“Just one then,” Cas said desperately. “Just tell me one thing, please Dean...I’m…” He looked at Dean fully then, taking a step closer. His voice was trembling when he said, “You’re driving me crazy.”
Castiel sat up slowly, feeling tender and sore. He closed his eyes, concentrating, healing himself with grace. He was aware that Dean was touching him, rubbing his shoulder and kissing his forehead. When the healing was complete and he was fully restored, Castiel kept his eyes closed, leaning further into Dean’s touch, wrapping his arms around the hunter’s waist and trying to commit the man’s touch to memory.
He turns and runs back towards the mayhem, willing himself not to look back, not to freak out about how Bobby’s escape plan is going. He nearly collides with his dad and brother on the way towards the tomb, and they say “the Colt!” in complete unison. They split up, Sam taking the left side of the ornate structure and John and Dean taking the right. Dean peaks over the side and spots it: the revolver is lying in the grass, momentarily forgotten, while Azazel has Crowley pinned to the side of the tomb with his telekinetic powers. Crowley is writhing and rising up towards the roof, and it’s so similar to the way Mary was murdered all those years ago that something in the omega—
“Is this okay?” Castiel whispered in his ear, the new directive from the photographer forcing his erection to press harder and more insistently against Dean’s ass. Dean was beginning to sport a serious tent of his own, but he knew he couldn’t have his dick falling out of the panties, so he tried to calm down.
“I begged him to have Sam—that’s his brother, who’s a defense lawyer—look the contract over. But Dean was already so...despondent.” She bit her lip anxiously. “I don’t think he even read the terms before signing.”
The question catches Dean off-guard, and he blushes a little, remembering all the dirty things he said a few minutes ago.
He could only pray that Cas was in bed, sleeping it off. He gripped the steering wheel tight, imagining all the other scenarios.
The corners of Sam’s mouth move minutely, a gesture that mirrors a small smile. “No, that’s not… Don’t you remember, Cas? We read something about this in
what Cas feels. The hard cock in hand, the sweet taste of omega on his lips, his erection rutting against Dean’s ass and seeking an urgent release.
“I don’t understand,” Cas said, the disappointment in his voice making Dean begin to ache. He had wanted this plan to succeed for everyone, but Cas most of all.
made me do it, he said, ‘break-up with Cas, leave him.’ He said he would fire you and you’d be homeless and—
He’s breathing heavily on Castiel’s thick neck and the wolf shivers. Dean’s scent is so revitalizing, so strong and soothing, and he feels himself relax minutely. The omega parts his lips, licks them, his airflow tickling Castiel’s skin in a way that makes his heart race…
“Jesus, Cas...you are ridiculously hot,” he mumbled, a comment seemingly more to himself than to Castiel.
“Hold on,” Dean said, “how does a guy like that end-up dirty dancing in a gay club, getting hammered, then having a public fight with his boyfriend on drag queen night?”
“I can promise you he won’t make many jokes. Well, unless you count sarcasm. And he’s actually from Tennessee originally, so he shouldn’t have any problem navigating the area. Or your farm, I imagine.”
They froze, effectively pausing their eager-dry-humping situation. Dean looked up at Castiel guiltily, as if realizing they had initiated the exact activity that Charlie had requested they not do. He looked down at the digital clock on the table and gasped. It was right at six o’clock.
Dean’s not sure how they’ve managed to skip all the awkward, “tell me about yourself” first-date questions, but he reckons it’s ‘cause they’ve been in each other’s orbit since January. Whatever it is, he’s happy to skip the stifled conversations and head right into everyday life. “S’fine. Becky wouldn’t let me do the puppet show, even though I’m totally fine.”
They eat on the patio, on a small wooden table with two chairs. Dean’s made so much food that they have to go into the kitchen and bring it back, their plates filled with potato salad and baked beans, cheeseburgers barely fitting on the ceramic plates.
Anger flashes through Castiel, making his hands shake. “Maybe if you knew what you were doing, I could follow your lead.” He slips the guitar strap off his back, cradling the instrument back into the stand as carefully as possible for how angry he is, rolls up the sleeves of his sweater, and stomps off to take five. Backstage he’s seething, ignoring everything Balthazar is recommending about being friendlier, about not having such a short fuse, because who is
“I am Castiel Novak, last surviving son of Chuck Novak, and I challenge you for the role of packmaster,” he roars in his most commanding tone, rounding up the hill to stand beside John. “The blood of The Wolf flows in my veins. I am the rightful heir of this pack and vow to serve you to the best of my ability, as my father did for over three decades.”
When Dean glanced up, Anna was walking to the microphone. Dean sat up straight, every muscle tense, leaning closer to catch every word.
He realizes that Cas isn’t gonna hit his prostate from this angle, and as much as he’d love to come untouched on his alpha’s wolf cock, the chances are getting slimmer the longer Cas thrusts into him. Even in his current form Dean can tell his boyfriend is getting close, so he props himself up by the elbows and takes himself roughly in hand, pumping his cock with precome smearing at the tip. The sounds from his lips alternate between harsh, needy moans and jilted whimpers and Castiel is fucking wild behind him, yowling with over-stimulation. Dean focuses on the feeling of the growing, swelling dick filling him up, making him full and satiated, and Cas’ erratic motions are jerking his body forward and back. It’s rough and messy and completely fucking thrilling, and when the wolf finally starts to come Dean thinks he might not ever stop, ropes and ropes of white hot come packed inside him until semen runs down his thighs.
