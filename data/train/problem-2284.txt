The dog answered with enthusiastically licking John’s mouth, making John sputter.
Back home only Lestrade and Mycroft knew about their relationship, John didn’t want to explain himself to people when he didn’t know if they were really dating. Here, he allowed Sherlock to call him his ‘partner’. It was true either way.
He returned to Sherlock staring at him with anticipation.
“I think a hickey might work.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s grief was a weight he had to live with every day and he did everything to survive, he occupied himself in whatever way possible, he build this house for a family he would not have, and he hoped he could just keep working and occupying himself with this useless effort until he finally died.
“I want you to touch me here,” John said to Sherlock’s baffled expression.
“Satisfied?” Sherlock asked, throwing the shirt on John’s lap.
John doubted he could take a dare without going too far at this moment.
“Why should I?” He asked, his deep voice playful.
John could hear Sherlock’s footsteps and he turned around so that Sherlock would face his back when he came into the room. It was already quite late, but he had a lot of time to prepare. They just came back from London yesterday, the case springing on them last second and its conclusion reached just because Sherlock’s mind apparently really worked better when there was an incentive.
Sherlock took it to heart to embarrass them both by acting overly proud of having John by his side at the wedding. John could see that everybody who knew Sherlock was surprised that someone could bear to date him. Sherlock was showing him off to prove them all wrong.
He clutches to humor anyway.
“Why?” John asked with a hitched breath.
“If you carried me to your bed,” John answered jokingly, but the moment he felt Sherlock’s hands settle beneath his thighs he knew he miscalculated.
Sherlock kissed his shoulder.
“The problem, John, is that I like it entirely too much. Ludicrously so.”
It was bad enough that John couldn’t see him do it, which made his skin tense with anticipation before every little touch. Did he really need to cage his cock in fucking silicone, too? How much of a sadist was Sherlock, really?
“I want you to enjoy your vacation.”
Sherlock’s hand was getting lower, disappearing beneath the water, the sponge travelling John’s spine. Suddenly, Sherlock pressed it a bit harder and John straightened up, as if he was electrified, with a gasp.
“Violin instructor?”
“Then how am I supposed to call you? Besides, you didn’t answer my question; what are you doing?”
He felt like this before, when Sherlock kissed him in Italy, when Sherlock played the violin after the concert, and he couldn’t quite explain it. He knew it was adrenaline, but it was a different kind than the sexual one. He yearned for Sherlock, but not in any concrete way, he just wanted him.
“He works here. He won’t attack me here, he’s going to follow us to Britain, this is how he hunts.”
“Sherlock, I don’t understand.”
“I arranged it,” Sherlock said with a half-smile, leaning down to kiss him again.
But if you don't want to here are the links to the things:
“I would be much better with some alcohol.”
John looked at him through a haze with a questioning look.
Is he testing if I will escape from Italy to get away from him? Because I’m considering it
“Fine. Let me … dress you.”
His finger circled John’s hole and for a moment John was afraid he would do it for hours until John begged for it, but his finger finally breached John. Sherlock was being tender at first, but a sudden harder move made John rest his head heavily against the mirror.
“He will know it’s a trap.”
“He wants to prove I derive pleasure from it.”
John was too lost in Sherlock’s eyes to answer for a moment.
“You didn’t have to handcuff me for that.”
“We don’t have to go all the way if you’re too tired,” Sherlock suddenly suggested.
After Mrs Hudson assented, delightfully surprised, he went to grab his jacket and stared at the card holder from Sherlock. It seemed to him as if he grabbed it, he could never go back. At last he snapped out of the silly feeling and took it into his pocket.
Before John could answer, Sherlock started sucking his neck. It took all of his self-control not to make any more embarrassing sounds, but he couldn’t quite stop his body from shivering when he felt Sherlock’s hand moving up his tight.
John looked at him in disbelief. How dare Sherlock lie to him.
“Don’t come until you tried my gift, John,” his voice is commanding, and at least that John can comply with.
John was pissed off. He could somehow survive the mortification of getting hard because of Sherlock, if the other was sharing it with him. But he was the only idiot here.
That much John suspected, he only wanted to make sure. He really underestimated how much money Sherlock got from his brother.
“Not like this” Sherlock fingers pressed into his scalp more “It has to be quite eye-catching. And I won’t be tender.”
John didn’t think it necessary. What they did was hardly sadomasochistic. At least, he thought so, he didn’t really know what Sherlock planned.
“Hm, do I?” John teased, groaning when Sherlock sped up his movements only to suddenly halt them.
“I want to punish him,” John answered with vehemence, “I want to make him lose.”
“What game?”
“Yes, in fact, this is exactly what I wanted,-” John grinned, “-to hear. Dare.”
John hesitated only a moment before taking it. Sherlock helped him up and let go immediately after.
“Will you do it for me, John?”
“You hungry?” He asked, his whole air returning to normal.
Looking back at it, these were not good reasons to act the way he did that night. He blames Irene, even though it was not her idea. She put these stupid things into his head.
Sherlock leaned in slowly, almost hesitantly. John had a lot of time to close his eyes this time. When Sherlock’s lips finally touched his it was hardly a kiss, just a butterfly swipe, but it had them both gasping. Sherlock disconnected their lips almost immediately, resting his forehead against John’s.
“The clothes, I could maybe live with, but a collar, Sherlock? Really?”
“I came because Sherlock wanted me to be the person to execute his will,” Mycroft stated without needless chatter.
Sherlock started talking again, unfortunately.
He swam for an hour, and it calmed him. Sherlock appeared in the meantime, but he just sat down at the bar, making no indication for John to leave the pool.
“You can drink, but don’t overdo it. I need you clear headed.”
Sherlock drove them back obediently. On the way, John reminded himself of his talk with Mycroft. And he thought Mycroft was ridiculous for badmouthing Sherlock.
I just wanted to test him
“You arsehole!” John didn’t care about keeping his voice down, even if Mrs Hudson could possibly hear them from her kitchen, “I fucking told you to wait for me!”
“Because I didn’t know what it meant! I thought you were just being nice! Return the things and don’t buy me anything more.”
They returned home in silence and in silence disappeared into their rooms.
“John, there was no time-“
“Take that away,” John’s voice was surer than he thought it would be, “Take the ring away, take the will away. I don’t want to see it.”
“No,” John knew the moment he said that Sherlock would know he lied.
“It’s a watch, John, I’m pretty sure even you can deduce that.”
“I don’t know. Maybe.”
“Sounds interesting, John. What do you have in mind?”
“Did you ever have sex?” He asked Sherlock and the detective didn’t seem that surprised by it.
John sighs.
“Put it on yourself. You don’t want to make a mess.”
“I want you to buy it.” He gestured to the shirt with his head, and could see the exact moment when Sherlock noticed it, by his scandalized expression. “And I want you to wear it. Now.”
Once Sherlock recovered John fell on top of him, all the strength evaporating. He could feel the wetness of Sherlock’s pants, his own sticky mess between their stomachs, his hole cold from the chilling lube. It was clammy and uncomfortable but the last thing he wanted was to move from his spot, too occupied with cursing Sherlock in his mind.
Besides, Sherlock had really nice mouth. Beautiful and skillful. His hands were also lovely: big, sure, unhesitant. Sherlock really wasn’t kidding when he decided to take care of John’s needs. If Sherlock enjoyed this, who was John to expect anything more?
“Bored? Not even close. Why? Uncomfortable?”
“You know, I’m a little worried that you know my size better than I do. Without any measurements. This suit feels as if it was made for me.”
Right as John thought this wasn’t so bad, Sherlock retrieved the trousers he left on John’s bed and kneeled before him. John couldn’t really stop the gasp of surprise. Sherlock continued on as if he haven’t heard, asking (demanding) John to lift his leg. Sherlock touched his ankle then, but only to stabilize him while he was putting on the trouser. When he finished he immediately switched to the other leg, in the same kind of weird, calm trance. John was not prepared for the moment when Sherlock started raising up with the trousers, moving along his body, yet never directly touching. When he started buttoning and zipping them up John closed his eyes.
Sherlock must have reserved a loge for them. John didn’t really care, as long as he could sit down and hide. It was in front of the bar, and some people sat there, but John assumed that if he sat more inside, Sherlock would cover him. That plan didn’t really work.
Everybody knew that Sherlock’s eyes had some paralyzing quality to them. From this close the effect was too strong for John to stand.
John really thought that was it, Sherlock’s control finally broke and he won. But when he felt Sherlock rubbing against him desperately, still in clothes, he reared up with anger, though Sherlock pushed him down again.
“I do, I do. Now please continue.”
John could admit this situation was maybe, a tiny bit, completely his fault. Who could blame him though? Living with Sherlock was tiring at the best of times, living with him when he was in a shitty mood for god knows how long now, would drive anyone crazy.
It was a heavenly feeling to be under this man, his heaviness hot and damp and grounding. There was nothing John wouldn’t do to protect him from harm, no one he would let destroy their happiness. He would hold Sherlock safe or die trying.
“I wouldn’t say you’ve been losing, John. Sherlock must be holding onto the last of his patience by now. He likes pleasing you, use it to distract him.”
Great, now John had another image of things he wanted Sherlock to do to him right at this moment.
John was getting a bit anxious about the sound of water pouring he heard from behind the closed door so he texted Irene.
“Was it” Sherlock’s mouth travelled to John’s neck, and John realized there was no escape from him, “a relaxing shower?”
“I don’t accept that as an answer.”
John’s mind was just noise at that point and he bucked wildly to free himself from Sherlock’s hold. It was an uncoordinated and half-hearted attempt and Sherlock managed to hold onto him firmly.
The detective woke up when he heard the door opening. He took one look at John and raised his covers making space for him. John laid down. He was fuming inside, but he was also tired and he got used to sleeping in Sherlock’s bed.
“You may lie to yourself, John, but you can’t tell me that you didn’t feel good when you received them.”
He turned his head and saw in Sherlock’s expression that he was ready to stop. John should have wanted that.
Sherlock bit on his nipple to turn his attention back to him.
He never expected that Sherlock would ask about this, though given Sherlock’s nature, he should have. John was surprised to see him too because he wasn’t supposed to be back so early, so he was at a disadvantage.
Anyway, he wouldn’t able to pull off the dominant thing Sherlock had going for him.
“I wanted to.”
Sherlock’s eyes were closed and he rested his forehead against John’s temple. Free from his gaze, John could observe himself and it was the strangest sort of autoeroticism to see himself like this, corrupted by Sherlock’s presence, no clothes covering his most intimate parts, his body bowed slightly to arch itself more into Sherlock’s touch, his whole countenance desperate for it.
“No,” the word shattered John’s heart.
say it.
After a moment they went to a Vietnamese restaurant, so he supposed all was well and forgiven. It wasn’t that big of a deal anyway.
“Sher-“ Before he could finish, his lips were covered with a hand.
A talk he recently had drifted to his mind. John spent too much time thinking about his and Sherlock’s unclear relationship and his only advisor was Irene Adler, who had quite an original approach to all things sexual, and so John decided to ask for an opinion of someone slightly more down to the earth.
“Please.”
“In a manner of speaking.”
John wasn’t quite sure which one of them lost or won this game of theirs, but if it was his loss, it certainly turned out to be a very pleasant one.
On the third day of Sherlock’s case John received a package. Inside was a jumper and a note with Sherlock’s handwriting. It said ‘Truce? I think it will suit you. SH’
“You wanted me to promise you my life?” John spat out with disdain, “you’re not responsible enough to have it.”
Sherlock’s hands, making circles on John’s hips, stopped abruptly. John didn’t wait for the question.
“Fine, whatever. Just do it quickly - Ah!”
“Not getting molested, probably,” he answered swatting Sherlock’s hand away from his waistband.
“Would you like to sleep with him?”
John snickered.
Sherlock’s mouth opened but no sound came out.
Maybe it was necessary, maybe it wasn’t, but after that John felt the balance of their relationship straightening out. Sherlock used to be in control before his fall, but after, he acted as if he was John’s prisoner, as if he owned him everything. But once John went too far, Sherlock seemed to free the dominating part of his personality he had been keeping in check and it made it easier for him to stop John whenever he was overcome with desperation, and restrain him, sometimes physically, from causing himself harm, though John quickly realized where lied the limits of what both of them could and liked to do. Sherlock’s preferred method of torture was relentless teasing, but John’s was exhausting all of Sherlock’s energy, and there were days they spent never leaving their bed.
“Is that a compliment or an insult?” John asked, his hands tightening on Sherlock’s arms.
“Ah, you must be John Watson” the man took his hand into both of his with a friendly expression, “My niece told me about your blog. I’m not much for technology, but she said your writing was very entertaining. Ah, but she still can’t forgive you for stealing Sherlock away!”
Normally, John would just let it go. It was not in his nature to point out other’s strange preferences, but Sherlock has been a dick about it for the whole night. What’s more, he found it so funny and unexpected that Sherlock, who he considered completely asexual before the Women, and later straight and maybe slightly masochistic, would have such an embarrassing and harmless kink as that.
“That’s more of a dare, isn’t it? But fine,” John had to wonder for a bit. He had an entire library of sexual fantasies.
The jumper: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d0/fb/7a/d0fb7a1fe0e5ecfdd643f82bb79a4ce0.jpg
John blinked with the sudden change of his tone, but he complied, raising to Sherlock’s lips with a smile. Sherlock kissed back sweetly, almost innocently. When John drew back Sherlock had a smile on his face but his bright eyes seemed sad, somewhat.
“Turnabout? How is this a way to make fun of me? You’re just wasting your money and time without any reason!”
“John, I really need that-“
“Here is a good place,” he told Sherlock with breathless amusement, moving to his balls, “here is nice too.”
None of these things could top the one gift John received that he never considered throwing out, or selling, or destroying in the following months. One day Sherlock just returned to the flat and called John to show him a bulldog pup he was holding. John was at a loss seeing the small creature wag his tail at him.
John turned around and was hesitant between checking up on Sherlock and punching him in the face, but the hands on his hips stopped him. Sherlock looked up at him with false supplication, but John was just a weak man, if he had someone, especially this person, down on his knees before him, what was he supposed to do? He could do absolutely nothing when Sherlock’s head moved forward to mouth at the outline of his cock through his trousers. The only thing left for John was to put his hand in Sherlock’s hair and sigh.
John turned his head to the side to protest but it was quickly dragged back to face forward with the hand still in his hair.
“God, that’s a lot,” he commented, the burn of it making his voice throaty.
“Yes. A business man, I believe? Likes to eat well but doesn’t have anyone to take with him. He’s not bad looking. Is he gay? But not out?”
When they returned to their rooms, he passed Sherlock and closed himself in his bathroom with a bang.
If Sherlock thought John was going to request a kiss in return, he was mistaken.
“Because I might be able to help? Come on, John, I’m a specialist in that area.”
“Don’t move,” he mimicked Sherlock’s commanding tone.
John raised from the bed angrily.
Sherlock raised John’s foot, kissing it with reverence. When he looked back at John, his irises were almost completely black. John shivered and covered his mouth. Whatever Sherlock wanted to do, he doubted he would be able to hold back any noises.
He had no chance really, when Sherlock removed the hand he was biting, interweaving their fingers. The sensation of the lips on his chest through the thin material of Sherlock’s shirt, of his hand on John’s spine, was too much and John could predict his defeat.
John couldn’t help but wonder where exactly did his life get so off course. How did he manage to fall so hard into the grasp of a man that was unable to follow any rules of propriety or sensible thinking?
He will not be the first one to give in. He might lose to Sherlock in many things but this one he can win.
“Enough, John,” he said in a demanding voice and John felt instant disappointment.
His hands roamed that lovely chest while his mouth disconnected from Sherlock’s reddened lips to contour his sharp cheekbones and moved down to his neck, sucking a bruise there. Sherlock’s muscles were tightening with force, opposing the binds. John’s fingers traveled under Sherlock’s shirt to the low of his back, while he ran his mouth down to Sherlock’s nipple.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think it’s great. Thank you for taking me.”
John tried not to shiver. Sherlock would be able to percept any change in him like this.
“We can’t go out right now. London is practically flooding, no taxi will arrive.”
Sherlock was moving, still unhurried but no longer languid, and John found himself on his back with Sherlock leaning on top of him. His kisses travelled from John’s lips to his neck, and John felt the unmistakable stirrings of arousal. He put his hands on Sherlock’s chest and pushed him back a little, and Sherlock raised without any protest.
It was almost a spasm when his knee went up quickly to make contact with Sherlock’s stomach with a force that threw Sherlock to his knees, clutching his stomach, his grunt shocked and accusatory.
The detective’s eyes widened at the sentence. He looked into John’s eyes, looking for a trace of a joke, but John’s face remained serious. In a sudden move he embraced John. His kisses over John’s body were full of affection, his exploring hands more tender than ever.
John allowed him to open his trousers and force it down to above his knees, along with underwear. It was just a blowjob. Of course, the place wasn’t ideal, but it was also … not bad. Fuck, he was turned on by the place. Damn Sherlock.
“Unless you don’t want to.”
John wasn’t afraid of other people stealing Sherlock from him. There was no one who could keep the detective’s attention for that long. Not even him.
“Oh, sod off. Truth or dare?”
“Why, what did Sherlock leave me?”
I may have done smth stupid
Not that he had anything on him. The only money he took was Sherlock’s card. He didn’t really have to pay for anything here: the flight, the hotel and the hotel food were prepaid by their hosts. That Sherlock wanted to throw away money on extracurricular activities was his choice. At least, that was how John was explaining not taking any of his money to himself.
John took a white macaron into his mouth and did a mental double take. He did not imagine it would be that good. It looked hard from the outside, but the vanilla inside was chewy. He looked up and saw Sherlock self-satisfied smirk which meant Sherlock could easily see the pleasure John was experiencing.
Sherlock apparently predicted something like this could happen. He covered John’s lap with a thick towel. Before moving back he leaned once again to whisper into John’s ear, but his voice had its normal deepness back “Are you alright? Can you walk back to our room?”
“Will you stop sulking, John? I’m sorry for what happened, but it was necessary.”
He went to stand behind Sherlock, putting his hands on his neck and massaging lightly. He could hear Sherlock’s sharp breath when he pressed harder, using his hands to unknot the tense points. He kept doing that until he felt Sherlock’s posture relax.
“What, that’s ridiculous! Sherlock wouldn’t want to be called ‘Daddy’. Would you, Sherlock?”
He tried not to imagine them in more intimate positions, but he couldn’t help himself when Sherlock pinned him against the wall to kiss the life out of him.
“I was busy.”
John smirked and started taking off his suit jacket. It was getting hot in here, but he wasn’t going to get immediately naked.
John didn’t think about disobeying, though he could torture Sherlock further. There was something in that voice that made him unable to defy him.
Whether it was the moment when he agreed to not masturbate on his own or when he started spending every night in Sherlock bed, or if it was even earlier, when he discovered Sherlock was into some rather surprising kinks, John should have realized that he was not mentally prepared to deal with him.
“Hmm, what is he doing then?”
“I’m sorry, John.” Great, now he was speaking against his throat. “I needed a genuine reaction.”
For a month after Sherlock returned from Switzerland with John’s fondue set, he didn’t buy John anything more. He thought that was it, Sherlock got bored. Irene was harassing him through texts to test that theory by actively asking Sherlock for something, but John just couldn’t bring himself to utter such a sentence, so he ignored her.
“I don’t understand.” John’s throat was sore.
“I don’t mean right now. We should move here once we retire.”
Sherlock looked up, confused, as if he woke up form a dream. His pupils were blown wide. John could do little more than stare at him, pinned to this position, to this moment, by nothing more than a look in those eyes.
“And why would I tell you?”
“Take off your shirt.”
“It’s Lestrade. The murderer escaped.”
“And I told you we are here on a case, John.”
John looked at him with confusion. What did it mean to give himself over –
“Behave. Truth or dare?”
The wine was good. The temperature of the water was sublime and the scent form the candles and bubbles made John a bit light-headed. He was starting to lose the sense of how weird this was.
This was not a vacation John imagined Sherlock would ever take him on. He didn’t think he would have any vacation at all really, not while Sherlock was on a case, because if there was a personification of workaholism, Sherlock was it.
Sherlock rarely left the site of the crime before looking at the victim, but suddenly he told John to ‘wait a moment’ and disappeared. When he returned twenty minutes later John was surprised by suddenly having his head covered by a black beanie. He didn’t see it very well, as Sherlock put it on him quickly, but he could say it was black, and quite simple, except for a bit of fur underneath that felt really nice and warm on his ears.
“Sherlock, why are you even awake?” John asked blocking the insistent lips with his palm.
“Are you done with the witness? Good. Pay the bill for me, will you?”
“Professor, please restrain yourself from revealing too much. I prefer my past to be something of an enigma.” Sherlock complained which made the man laugh more.
God, how was he supposed to survive tomorrow?
When they finished dancing he still had the melody and the movement in his body, it didn’t want to leave. He felt too full of satisfaction and as if he would never be able to get enough of Sherlock at once. He felt like he was overflowing.
John was having a heart attack.
John thought his life was crazy enough, what with helping a genius consulting detective solve crimes and whatnot. Apparently not, because if your flatmate happened to be Sherlock Holmes you were in it for the full experience.
John laughed, leaning down to bop the pup’s nose, “you see, Gladstone? I can never win with that guy. Will you be on my side?”
John felt strange doing this when he could see himself in the mirror, opening the buttons slowly, Sherlock watching every move like a hawk. John whimpered when Sherlock rewarded him with harder touches against his prostate. They were still slow, too slow to satisfy him in any measure.
The next morning he woke up to find a box on his nightstand. Inside was a cell phone. A freaking cell phone!
And John was afraid of thinking about it. He was frightened of imagining it, because every time an image passed his mind it was one of his submission, of Sherlock taking him, using him, pleasuring him in a way that John had no control over.
There was no other way. He could not break Sherlock’s resolve without losing himself, without giving himself up in this small parts. He was too weak to deprive Sherlock of the things he wanted, he could only focus on refusing to promise him his life. Everything else had to go. Sherlock would not allow him disobedience, neither would he let John keep his shame.
I'm sorry, this probably has even more mistakes than usual. I've been hesitant to write in English lately (that's why there was such a long break) because I currently read and write in my third language almost all the time, and I completely lost my confidence, as I'm not a native speaker of English either. Anyway, I'm sorry for the break, and hope you enjoy!
(See the end of the chapter for
“And what do you think?”
“No, it’s fine. I want to keep playing.”
John didn’t know the bride but her father was the music professor that they met in the opera house. He suspected he was the one that made his daughter invite them. Sherlock told him that they were wealthy and the groom was even more so, though Sherlock hadn’t met him before.
“It was the fastest way. We had to make him follow us, I can’t work with the police here.”
“How about a game?”
“I am always by your side, John.”
“What is this?” John asked, breathless.
“There’s no need for that.” Sherlock’s sudden voice made them both jump. How did he arrive here unnoticed?
“John, if you break my arm, we might really have to call off the wedding,” Sherlock said, painfully amused, and John freed the hand, sitting on Sherlock’s hips instead.
Sherlock’s whole atmosphere changed in a moment. John could feel his body become less relaxed, his hold more constricting. Whatever Sherlock was to say, he expected John to try to detach himself.
Sherlock joined him in the bath, providing little time to enjoy the view of his completely naked body and sat right before John. He was close enough for a kiss but John didn’t move, just looked down at Sherlock’s lips and back up into his eyes with a smile. Sherlock’s intensity when he looked at him always got John’s blood running.
“Just tell me.”
“I don’t feel it.”
For once, he imagined himself a winner. God, how wrong he was.
“Where did you serve?” he asked the guy, taking a seat next to him.
When they both returned to their flats and Mrs Hudson thanked him for a wonderful evening, joking about John being a delightful date, he took out his phone and wrote to Sherlock.
The instant Sherlock felt the metal of the handcuffs against his skin he struggled and John made his hold tighter, stopping all their movements.
Sherlock’s eyes bore into him. The hand on the back of John’s seat moved to touch lightly behind his ear, but it wasn’t pushing him, or holding him in place. It just rested there.
He recognized the teste of a cream ice lolly, its shape long and thin. He couldn’t believe it. Sherlock had the audacity to blindfold and bind him to make him suck fucking ice cream. It was also melting down his chin, dripping onto his naked body and the cold feel of the substance made him feel dirty. It was nothing compared to when Sherlock leaned down to kiss him while he was licking the ice cream, their tongues meeting and separating with the substance on them. Sherlock didn’t even let him speak, keeping John’s head in place and John felt uncomfortably filthy-minded, because he could imagine himself at that moment, covered with white splashes and with his lips around this wretched thing, swallowing it down, and he felt hot.
“Oh, so there are rules to spending it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now you’re worried? I’m fine, Sherlock. I could take more,” he said with a wicked smile, opening his eyes to see Sherlock’s disapproving glare.
John glanced at the half-eaten box of chocolate-covered strawberries on the table. Sherlock looked at him hungrily while John ate them and John imagined that he just couldn’t wait and that’s why he pushed John against the wall licking the chocolate out of his mouth.
For a moment, John was certain that he had finally gone mad, that he was seeing things, but then he realized this,
“But I’m not gay! I’m too old for such revelations.”
His mind did not give him rest, it kept replaying Sherlock jumping off the building over and over. The image of Sherlock’s bloody body on the pavement was seared into his brain, appeared like a phantom when he closed his eyes.
“Was it good? You seemed to like this song the most, so I wanted to-“
He only teased John with his tongue a bit, which earned him John’s hand in his hair, not really tugging, but a clear warning. He finally opened his lovely mouth wide to take almost all of John in, and John emitted a moan that was really more a scream.
“You should come up with a word that tells me you want to stop,” Sherlock talks from the other side of the room.
“Only if you want.”
After a few times in which Sherlock made him come with his mouth or hands and then refused to let John take care of him, John accepted that it was probably Sherlock’s asexuality standing in the way. He couldn’t have known he was wrong because any logical explanation was never the case with Sherlock.
John scoffed into the phone. He would never admit how much Irene helped him through his confusion in dealing with his impossible lover.
John felt his breath stop. Of course. This was stupid. The stinging in his chest was stupid. Sherlock was never affected. Of course he didn’t want John.
When he saw them together instant regret hit him. Sherlock was such a graceful dancer, but with John, he could never look as well as he did with that beautiful woman. Together they appeared as if taken out from a movie, turning the heads of the pairs around them.
“Would you be able to sleep comfortably if I was beside you?”
“No, thank you,” he answered adamantly as if he was Jesus rejecting Satan in the desert.
“I don’t need a safe-word, Sherlock.”
Why did Sherlock have to be so stubborn?
“I didn’t allow that.”
“No, Daddy, I wouldn’t,” he makes his voice softer but he can’t stop himself from snorting.
John almost laughs. Sherlock’s request is flat but he still did what was asked so John opens up, first one leg, teasingly, the other following, just as slow. He may as well let Sherlock enjoy the show, it’s not completely outside of his strategy anyway.
The detective just looked at him with a self-satisfied smile.
“Say ‘please’.”
It seemed like a good idea at the time. If there were any unpredictable side-effects John would notice them immediately. At first, he sat in a chair next to the bed, but it quickly became uncomfortable. He hesitated only a moment before joining Sherlock under the covers. It wasn’t that much of a big deal, he tried to rationalize. Sherlock’s bed was big, there was a lot of space separating their bodies, and the other was sleeping soundly. Moreover, they shared beds before in inns and guest rooms.
It was good that he wasn’t expected to do any actual detective work, because the thoughts about his current situation with Sherlock were taking all of the space in his brain. At first, he tried to avoid them, but that passed quickly enough.
Sherlock didn’t touch him, so John had to close the space between them himself.
“Very well. Truth or dare?”
A week later he gave John a new detective story that John wanted to read, because he apparently ‘found it by accident on a street market, and thought maybe John would like it’. John doubted that a book that was just published two months ago was already on street markets, but he let it go.
When he went around to Sherlock’s front again he could see his irises swallowed by the black of his pupils. John smiled, sinking to his knees to Sherlock’s clear perturbance. Once there, he started taking off Sherlock’s shoes.
“No, physically dress you.” Sherlock looked at once determined and hesitant.
“Is it good? Let me try.” Sherlock said it like an order, and John automatically tried to reach for his already empty glass, but before he could as much as turn his stool around again, Sherlock put a hand on the side of his face, his thumb posed on John’s lower lip, opening his mouth.
There was one person he straight up told he was dating Sherlock, even if it was not entirely true, and it was Molly. He liked to think it was because he pitied her for her hopeless crush on the detective, that he wanted to help her get over it, but there was an itching sometimes when he saw them together. And while Sherlock was abrasive towards her and often ignored her presence, John could tell she was one of the people Sherlock trusted. And sometimes, when he observed the way she looked at Sherlock, he saw himself, and he thought they both had to be mad to fall in love with someone so alien.
“Pardon?”
“Can I ask you something? The shirt was for my benefit. Wasn’t what followed supposed to be for yours?”
“Sherlock” John’s voice was quiet, but still loud in the room occupied previously only by the sounds of their breathing and the covers moving, “I don’t know what you want from me.”
“Sherlock …”
John hoped it meant Sherlock changed his game plan. Alas, the world was not so kind to him, as he saw Sherlock motioning him over. It was show time.
John barely managed to read the last line through his angry tears. He was mad at Sherlock for writing it, for playing him, for dying.
Honestly, it was hard to say how he had felt right after Sherlock’s return. He was happy, of course, but by that point, he had so much sorrow inside it was hard to let it go, and sometimes Sherlock’s face just reminded him of the pain he had to go through when he saw him jump from the roof and which he felt every day since.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice and breath against his ear made his insides clench, “reach into the pocket of my coat.”
He knows he will most likely regret this little revenge later on, but for now, he doesn’t care. He’s making Sherlock furious and that is worth anything.
This was definitely the real Sherlock. Only the original could be this impudent. John tore the ring off his finger and threw it at Sherlock’s chest. It bounced off and seeped into the snow.
He didn’t know how long they would stay like this, but suddenly Sherlock let go of his foot, stood up and offered John a hand.
“Fine, suit yourself,” John sneered, “but I will be the one to make you come.”
“And that is what? I don’t get turned on by receiving gifts, Sherlock.”
“What would be the point of seducing someone who’s already your lover?”
“You’re right. Sorry about being so inquisitive, I’m just really curious about the whole situation. My friend is something of a mystery to me.”
John took it with a sigh. They were alone here, so the only one he could embarrass himself before was Sherlock, who knew him better than most people anyway.
Even now, while they were heading to the airport in his open top cabriolet, Sherlock seemed completely focused on the road, letting John enjoy the wind in peace.
“Reminds me too much of my grandma.”
At the time, he didn’t think that the folder on his laptop with the recordings of Sherlock playing his violin was a present, but later on, he realized it must have been, though he was able to listen to it only once, and it was lost once he smashed his laptop in a fit of desperate rage. Another thing he couldn’t make out was a leather notebook filled to the brim with Sherlock’s handwriting, but everything in it was written in code, and John did not understand its importance right away.
“Because it’s not against the rules.”
“Don’t worry,” John said, pecking Sherlock’s collarbone, “I won’t do anything you don’t want. But I assumed you prefer to bathe without clothes.”
But he did, and he blamed himself for it. It was unfair of him. If Sherlock didn’t want to go any further than this, couldn’t John just be satisfied with that?
John took his fingers out just to add another one, leaning down to coax Sherlock’s tongue out and suck on it, and he hoped Sherlock felt regret over forbidding him from sucking another part. He showed him how good that could be, Sherlock’s body straining to free itself. He went as far as he could when John started leaving his lap, his arms pulled to their limits.
John reacted by slowing down the progress. When he took down his trousers he looked back at Sherlock.
: Good for you lovebird. I see he’s taking out some big guns.
But he was not jealous of the blonde Sherlock was chatting up, not exactly. It was more of a general jealously of what was taking up Sherlock’s time and irritation about his prolonged disinterest in John. He maybe exaggerates a bit, but when you get attention all the time and then a myriad of one case after another takes away the source of it, it is very acute. Case mode Sherlock was a nightmare to live with, he was not looking after himself or their flat, and John was involved in his cases, which were, he admits, a good source of adrenaline and mostly interesting, but that meant nobody was actually caring for keeping their standard of life. And John could go quite a while without clean plates, regular meals, and sleep, but after some time it did make him grumpy. And he still couldn’t masturbate (he could, but he was kind of afraid what new way of driving him crazy Sherlock would come up with) and Sherlock was still adamant about not fucking him, so John was overall irritated and sometimes he was just done with Sherlock’s bullshit.
John opened his mouth and closed it again. God.
Fine, this wasn’t exactly true. He knew more or less how he got here and he cursed Sherlock for running after the BDSM killer without back-up. He just about managed to reach them and when he saw Sherlock laying on the ground he didn’t hesitate to shoot the man next to him in the leg. He barely restrained himself from shooting him in the head.
“We?”
“Sherlock, there are probably cameras here.”
“It’s fine. You kissed me before for a case.”
“Take off your shoes and coat,” John commanded quietly and Sherlock obeyed.
“Why is there a dog here, Sherlock? A case?”
Sherlock deposited him on his bed carefully, disappearing instantly. John managed to fall asleep while he was away, waking up only to feel Sherlock dress him up in his pajamas and arranging himself behind John. What followed was just blissful sleep surrounded by Sherlock’s heat.
“What do you want to ask for?”
“You have endangered your life, you have endangered the
John smirks and circles his finger around his hole. He loosened it a bit before in the shower while cleaning, so one finger gets in easily. Drunk or not, John knows anatomy and he knows his own body, though that particular part of it was not explored before.
When the word fell again Sherlock clenched his eyes shut. He opened them only when John reached to stop the video. Sherlock looked at him, with a silent question.
Of course, there were people who already knew about them. Except for Adler, Mycroft and Lestrade were the two that knew for a long time, though between them, John was sure Mycroft had a much better idea of what their relationship status was. He was pretty certain Sarah knew, from all the times she commented he started dressing better and asked him where he got something and he just answered honestly it was from Sherlock, and because of his general obsession with the detective that made a lot of people think he was gay in the first place.
“John? Are you all right?” Sherlock came closer to look straight into his eyes.
“Do you like him?”
John smiled at that, holding onto Sherlock tighter.
When John stood up it was an early brisk morning and he washed perfunctorily with freezing water by a small outside tap. One thing he had done before coming here for good was having his water and septic tank connection checked. It was still too early for his contractors to arrive, so John decided to walk to Friston. It was only about thirty minutes on foot and the road lead straight to it. He found the Inn Mrs Hudson was staying at and they ate their breakfast there. It was too early for the shop to be open, so he walked back along the forest line to his house, not wanting to miss the arrival of the construction manager. Mrs Hudson would take care of the shopping before she returned to London.
“I said I don’t care, Sherlock!”
Mycroft reached to his pocket to retrieve a simple purple jewellery box. John wasted no time in opening it up, hoping he was wrong about what it was. Inside, there was a simple gold wedding ring.
“It’s cold.”
“Why were you in France?” John was a bit hurt he was not present for this trip.
When John shoved the box in his direction, Sherlock completely ignored it and just opened his mouth expectantly. John sighed and complied, picking a black macaroon and pushing it through Sherlock’s mouth. It was not the first time he fed the childish detective. Occasionally, when Sherlock was immersed in a case for too long and John, anxious his friend would faint at some point, grew tired of asking him to just eat a little, he force-fed him. While Sherlock was usually compliant, he never looked at John in those moments, not like he did now. His gaze was known to be piercing and John found himself wondering if Sherlock was checking for some clues, if he was in the middle of some bizarre experiment conducted on John.
John wondered what he should ask about next. He had no idea what information Sherlock needed.
John didn’t have an answer so he kept quiet.
“Don’t worry, John. Sit back and relax. I’ll take care of you.”
When they exited the car, Sherlock put his arm on John’s lower back, and John tried to use as much of Sherlock’s body as he could to shield himself from the stares. Thankfully, the club had dark reddish lights, making him less recognizable. Not that he knew any rich people who frequented such clubs, but you never know.
Before John had a chance to take a good look at the club a waiter approached them.
“Depends on what you mean by sex. I consider what I do with you sex.”
John did indeed know, but he didn’t want him to stop. He was ashamed and slightly alarmed, but he was also very curious about what Sherlock would do. Scratch that, he was hopeful about what he might do.
“I’m sure Gladstone won’t mind being your dog too.”
The conditions he set were a bit of a problem, especially now, when John desired him more than he ever did. He cursed himself for using that damned vibrator, from discovering a pleasure he could only imagine before. Now Sherlock was back, and John couldn’t even use it.
“John,” Sherlock’s hands were on him before John managed to react, “I didn’t want to go too far before I was sure you would stay with me. This was to protect both of us.”
“Wait!”
John had many occasions to see Sherlock’s chest before, but it always amazed him how much thinner Sherlock seemed in his dress shirts. He was, of course, quite thin, but his chest was sculpted, his wiry muscles strengthened by whatever strange martial arts he trained.
“It’s not that public.”
Sherlock turned to him with a serious expression.
John was already losing his mind, just from Sherlock’s words, just from the cadence of his voice. The begging quality of it, like Sherlock wouldn’t be able to live without getting to know the taste of John.
“Sherlock is not seducing me!”
“Than why did you start at all? Why the gifts, why the kisses?”
“A sign of ownership. It would be nice if you had one, while I’m kissing you. Make more of an impact.”
“Until you admit you belong to me, John, you can always find somebody else. As long as you don’t promise me this, you may try with other people, though I wouldn’t want you to.”
“Wear it.”
He can hear Sherlock opening some kind of box.
“And if I agree,” Sherlock said looking into his eyes “Will you do anything I ask for?”
In contrast to the man, he made no rash or sudden movements, which took more of his self-control than he thought he possessed. He moved Sherlock lightly to rest against the couch and straddled his lap. Sherlock watched him with calm fascination, though his pupils were very wide and John could feel he was hard against his thigh. John started just by running his hands up and down Sherlock’s naked chest, not to tease him, just because he really wanted to. It was already completely dark outside, the only light was from the candles, of which half had gone out. They were enveloped in this semi-darkness and it helped get John in the right mood, not be too hasty, try to be sensual. He begun kissing Sherlock’s lips lightly, giving little pecks to his upper lip, then to the lower one, later using his tongue to lick the same trail. By the time he used the slight gap left open to put just the tip of his tongue inside, Sherlock’s lips were swollen.
Sherlock laid down before him, and they just rested there, unmoving, watching each other.
“What? Didn’t your friend tell you?”
Something was wrong when he used that word. A new sort of madness appeared in Sherlock’s eyes.
John bit his lip and kept himself from pressing Sherlock’s fingers stronger against him, meaning to move them further down his leg but Sherlock tore his hand out from John’s.
Sherlock looked at him and slowly moved forward making John stumble back. As John predicted, he was terrible at this and it was getting on his nerves. He looked down at his useless feet, as much to predict what move Sherlock would make next as to not look in his eyes.
John wasn’t going to lie, he felt warmer. Sherlock was caring for him, somehow, and this was a man who couldn’t even care for himself half of the time. It did make John feel a bit special.
“Wait a moment.”
It was still pretty dark outside, and Sherlock wasn’t any closer than when he fell asleep, but John’s heart still jumped. The detective was observing him in his usual attentive manner, as if John was a clue. He was silent, and John didn’t know what to say either, so they remained like this, watching each other while the room became brighter.
The heaviness that seemed to fill Sherlock with each day was growing and John felt helpless in solving it, especially with Moriarty back in the game, kidnapped children, and sudden accusations.
John just grins at him and bites his lip.
Before he could say another word John pointed his gun at him. Sherlock pressed his lips together, his smile gone.
John followed instructions not sure how he felt about leaving their spot on the couch. Sherlock’s hand made him look up.
Observing himself in the mirror he was glad to see he reached the level of suggestiveness he was aiming for. Theoretically, it was just a nice suit, but because of the lack of a shirt that left a lot of his cleavage unobstructed and the added collar, his intentions were unmistakable.
“I don’t have anyone else to ask.”
He knew full well how it would affect Sherlock and he wasn’t surprised when Sherlock took his foot and raised it to kiss his ankle, but when he pulled on John’s leg to make him lie underneath him, he did it fast enough John hadn’t stopped him.
“Are you going shopping?” he called from his door.
“I know,” Sherlock said, putting his hand on John’s cheek. “I wanted you to be aware of it, but I don’t expect you to decide now. Once you’ve chosen to stand by side, I will never let you go.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He moved Sherlock’s hand to his chin so that Sherlock’s thumb was touching his lower lip. “And here.”
He didn’t hurry, even though taking the ready meal and pouring the wine wasn’t a demanding task. Sherlock stared at him half in amusement and half in disbelief as he put the things on the bedside table and sat back on his lap.
On the other hand, maybe he should find out what Sherlock’s plans with this little experiment were. He wasn’t sure the embarrassment was worth it, but he wasn’t a coward.
Who was he kidding, he missed him. He always missed him. He supposed half of the reason Sherlock even went to his government missions, besides acquiring money, was making John miss him so that John would be more compliant with some new mischief he had in mind.
“We’re supposed to be in an Sadomasochistic relationship. Ideally, you would wear your collar, but here might not be the best place for it.”
“Well, thank you, I guess.”
“You get lonely, right? When I go abroad for my brother’s dreadful cases? That way you’ll have Gladstone here to keep you company when I’m away,” Sherlock answered, his voice light, but his smile a bit forced.
loved jumped off a building two years ago and made me watch it. He’s dead to me,” John gripped the gun tighter to control his trembling hand, “You are a stranger. Get out of my house.”
“I desire you so desperately, John. I want to be inside you, come inside you. Make you scream. Make you come just from stimulating your prostate. I would do it again and again, all night. I would drive you entirely mad.”
“It sounds strange.”
He fell asleep, exhausted. He woke up what felt like days later in Sherlock’s arms and freed himself from them to go drink some tea and find something edible for breakfast.
“No? Then the piece of silicone’s getting it tonight.”
“What’s wrong?” he asked, running his hand gently down the side of Sherlock’s face.
John was mortified, but that is what you get when you find an incredibly observant friend who also completely lacks tact.
“John, please,” Sherlock had his hands raised in a placating manner, “I never wanted to leave. I had to protect the man I love and my friends, this was the only way.”
“What were you doing in the bathroom?”
“Yes,” Sherlock’s voice was satisfied but John could see in his expression the torture was far from over.
Sherlock smiled at him.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock beamed at him. His expression was too much for John to take.
“Offering my congratulations, John,” Irene said with deep humor.
“Don’t sound so generous. You started it, now finish it. And I’m not going to ride you, my thighs are already sore, so you better get to work.”
John knew making light of this situation wasn’t really helpful. The silicone was holding him in places that were well calculated to make his erection last long but constricted the blood enough to make it very hard to come. Add to that the sensory overload he was sure to experience without seeing anything and you get what Sherlock wanted: agony.
“It’s not like I wanted to, John!”
Irene Adler. How was that possible?
Sherlock shot up from the couch.
Sherlock: Do you want me to bring you back anything in particular? SH
“For example honey? Sugar?”
“What?” Before John could even process the command, Sherlock leaned down and bit his nipple through his own dress shirt. John managed to remain quiet only by biting his hand.
“Shouldn’t you offer them later? I can still say ‘no’,” he stated, looking down at Sherlock, who started unbuttoning his shirt.
“Fuck, yea, okay,” John was beyond the point of caring about such small things like reality or the future. “Just let me come.” His voice took on a demanding quality.
“So, we’re leaving soon?”
“Ah, ah. Truth or dare, Sherlock?”
I told you, I’m testing him
“John,” there is a clear threat in it, but Sherlock is far away right now, so it loses some of its effects.
“Sure. And you had to buy everything I’m wearing right now, because I obviously don’t own a suit. Or shoes. Or a tie.”
“Raise your arms.” He said softly, but his deep voice made it sound like an order anyway. John asked himself why he obeyed so easily.
“Yeah, just let me grab some milk and cereal.” He went to the kitchen. It was no use, trying to go to bed again. He could never fall back asleep right after waking up. Besides, there was no work tomorrow, he could just sleep before noon.
“He always lies about these sort of things. I guess he’s afraid I would babble, but I won’t, you know? I’m just curious.”
“John, there is a case!” Sherlock informed him yet again.
“John,” Sherlock started in his soothingly low voice, “it was just a dance.”
“No,” Sherlock’s fingers suddenly pressed hard into his nape making John gasp.
It wasn’t normal for Sherlock to care that much, especially while on a case.
“John, what are you doing?” Sherlock asked, the look in his eyes desperate.
John couldn’t stop looking at himself in the mirror. Around his neck, on his shoulders, there were kiss and bite marks everywhere. It did look like a collar. John wasn’t so sure he didn’t prefer to just wear a normal one. At least then, last night could have been avoided.
“And this really works?” John asked surprised.
Sherlock tried to lift up but when John started moving his hips, he laid down again, too overcome with the stimulation. John smirked down at him, trembling and helpless underneath him. Sherlock was indeed very aroused, it only took a bit of John undulating atop him to make John witness his orgasm for the first time, Sherlock’s mouth opening wide with soundless grunts, his brows furrowing as if he was surprised by the sensation. John watched it all with cruel fascination.
John thanked his foresight for making himself come in the shower, he was already yearning for Sherlock’s touch, of which he had deprived himself the past weeks. Between them, he was the one with way less control, he wouldn’t have been able to survive it without letting off some steam.
After spending half an hour in various stores he realized something; he had no idea what he could buy, except for basic groceries. Mrs Hudson had a penchant for walking into every store they passed, but it just confused him further.
John opted to cooperate, not that he had any choice. Sherlock never stopped his ridiculous investigations in the middle.
He took Mrs Hudson to dinner in a Greek place ‘Vasis’, which was not anything outrageously expensive, but he greatly enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and his sea bass main dish.
“How can I know your intentions? For all I know, you might just be jealous.”
“I’m not that nice,” John answered and went to get out his latest purchase.
“Oh, don’t be so sour, John. Sherlock only answered me, because I kept messaging him incessantly. Also, he values my opinion and experience. Besides, I would never have pieced it together if not for a certain friend who saw you in a certain club and decided to inform me.”
A brilliant idea crossed his overheated brain. He took Sherlock’s right hand and put it on his cheek, holding it with his own.
Did Sherlock actually contact her? Did he tell her everything?
.’ It was not enough for Sherlock to make John literally naked. He had to expose him in all ways.
: Too big for me. What should I do?
“You said you wanted to take care of me,” he addressed Sherlock, entering the bathtub, “so take care of me.”
“What are you doing?” John forced himself to whisper. This was dangerous.
Sherlock wasted no time. “Don’t make a sound.”
“John, please be calm.”
“Sherlock, why are you showing me this? Do you want to move out of London?”
“Do I have to dance at the wedding?” John asked in a tortured manner.
“Will you not masturbate without telling me?”
John swallowed.
No, John. He’s testing your obedience. This is how I train my subs.
Sherlock didn’t seem much disturbed by this. He passed John a full glass of wine and sat down on a stool, next to John’s chest, looking at him.
When he opened his eyes Sherlock was looking at him in a dangerous fashion.
“Where’s the fun in dominating someone who is naturally submissive? You have a strong character, you’re a leader. A perfect challenge.”
Sherlock was, thankfully, only unconscious. The man drugged him, of which Sherlock informed John himself, regaining consciousness for a while. His resistance to drugs was higher and so he drifted in and out of consciousness on their way home in the taxi. John dragged him to the bed, to let him sleep it off, but Sherlock stopped him before he could leave the bedroom. He asked him to stay.
So not only for him than. Probably.
It was torture. John was holding his body still, but it wanted to tremble.
He managed to mollify his own anger, somewhat, though not completely. Surely, if he pretended nothing was wrong Sherlock would notice, so instead he acted spoiled and didn’t let Sherlock touch him too much. Normally, Sherlock would push harder, but he must have been feeling apologetic, so he did what John wanted without question and stopped his affections whenever John told him to.
“Yes, John, do you need anything?”
“In what way does he punish you?” she asked, and he could hear the smirk in her voice.
His smile fell somewhat when he saw Sherlock lift up the corner of his lip.
In the plane Sherlock reassured him that he didn’t need to take anything because everything was prepared. The murderer was apparently to be found in Naples, so that’s why they were going there.
“Why don’t you just ask him?”
“You fucker,” He was barely beneath shouting, “So that is why you didn’t let me touch you? But you touching me is fine?”
John licked his lips, passing on to massage Sherlock’s other foot in the same manner.
“John, this is Edward Chalamet, he was my-“
“So, do you want to go back to how things were before? Because it rarely works like that. What’s done is done, now you have to decide if you want to move forward or not.”
John was too tired right now to stop the thoughts about Sherlock from filling his mind. He was in the shower and the tension in his body needed to be dealt with if he wanted to withstand meeting the man in reality.
“John, I’m sorry.”
“It improves our chances of drawing his attention.”
John was pliable enough in his hands already. Sherlock held him securely, and John would never admit it, but he really liked the fact Sherlock was taller. He liked how they fit together. He liked Sherlock’s body, although there was nothing feminine about it. He liked his big hands, his long fingers. His smell, his touch, his voice, his mind.
He thought he might finally be getting the upper hand when Sherlock moved back a little, changing the place where their tongues played from John’s mouth to the space between them, letting everyone see. At the same time, the hand on John’s hand moved down to the inside of his thigh. Sherlock’s tongue was delineating John’s upper lip when he started dragging John forward by the hand on his ass, simultaneously opening his legs up with his other hand. John broke the kiss and pushed him slightly back, closing his legs.
“There is no ‘forward’. Whatever Sherlock’s games are supposed to prove, it’s not what you think.”
“Don’t be absurd, John. I’m in the middle of a case, I hardly have time to go grocery shopping.”
It’s hard to take his hand off this place, but this is not the most important part of his body today. He can see Sherlock’s eyes widening when he sees John pour lube on his fingers.
The camera in his new laptop is really good. He can see Sherlock clearly and he’s sure it’s the same on the other side. He got drunk for this, but he still feels a slight nervousness. He’s had phone sex before, but never video-chat sex. Not that Sherlock is going to actually have sex with him, he’s pretty sure no matter what he does, it won’t be enough to break Sherlock’s resolve, not when he was not physically there and Sherlock could always just end the call if it became too much.
John shouldn’t be surprised to see people fucking in this kind of place. It was the way they were doing it that made him uneasy.
“I can’t just suddenly uncover the hidden side of my sexuality with Sherlock! I live with him, and I work with him, and, even though I don’t know how it happened, he is my best friend.”
