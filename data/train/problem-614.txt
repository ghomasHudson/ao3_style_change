John looked up at Sherlock and saw immediately what had prompted Mrs Hudson’s comments. Sherlock was slumped back on the sofa, feet up on the coffee table, wearing a soft t-shirt. In this position, his belly was proudly on display, looking quite a bit bigger than John remembered. Sherlock sat up and tugged at his shirt, and their eyes met.
John smiles at him, pleased. “Once you start eating, your appetite’s going to improve, you know. You might feel a bit better in general.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Sherlock merely raised an eyebrow and swung his feet up on the couch.
Life continued as usual: plenty of takeaway, late nights at Angelo’s. John took to cooking meals, and to his great surprise, Sherlock actually ate them – and even seemed to enjoy them. Encouraged, John stepped up the shopping, and soon even Sherlock took a turn making supper several nights a week.
“Problem?”
Sherlock grumbled.
John’s heart stutters. He’s a little tipsy, so he reaches out before he can really stop himself and pats Sherlock’s belly. It’s solid and warm, adorably curved, and a little more substantial than John had imagined. “Quite an improvement,” John says, and then turns beet red, not sure how Sherlock will interpret that statement. He takes his hand away quickly.
“Well,” John says, surveying Sherlock with a glint in his eye, “let me see.” He tilts his head, then tugs at Sherlock’s t-shirt, pulling it tighter, and grins. Sherlock’s belly is surprisingly round, straining against his shirt and pooching out over his pyjamas. His waistband dips down to accommodate the swell of it.
John feels his stomach twist. He’s loved this, watching Sherlock fill out, but he figures it has to be over sometime. He sighs. “Sherlock, you really don’t need to lose it –”
“Of course,” Sherlock says. “Needed breakfast. And lunch.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock says around a mouthful of curry.
“He has,” John admitted, trying to ignore the warmth in his stomach at the thought. “He is in his forties, after all. Somehow I thought he’d be immune.”
Sherlock gave Lestrade the withering look he saved for anyone other than John who touched him, but then his mouth twitched in a smile. He put a hand on the curve of his stomach.  “I had to start catching up to the two of you sometime.”

If I ever return to the bosom of civilisation, I shall burn this journal.
JHW, September 16
I thought I jumped and wasn't caught, or
"I think that was the best sex of my life."
I awoke with impressions of having felt embraced, enveloped, loved. There was no sign of anyone having been in the cottage, nor of any forcing of my door-latch. I was, as I have been these many months, alone.
“Believe me, I will,” Sherlock said, still breathing hard as he did up his trousers once more and smoothed his shirt. His eyes sharpened and darted across John’s outfit. John was suddenly, acutely aware of the cool air on his legs, the rough wool brushing his thighs, and the sporran’s weight on his straining erection. Sherlock sank to a crouch and looked up at John. He slid his hands under John’s kilt and brushed his hardness with the backs of his knuckles.  “No pants,” he said, raising his eyebrows. “I approve. ”
Planting for the autumn harvest has begun. I am consuming my stores more quickly than I had expected. I fall asleep exhausted each night, then rise again in the morning to begin anew. My hands a blister & sore I cnt writ
I dreamed I died under the water.
Rain, rain, more rain. Blast it all. I spend my time in fishing, collecting firewood, the business of keeping myself fed. Winter will be coming soon, and I think of it often.
Perhaps it's easy being dead.
"Unfortunately I do. Well, the first thing that comes to mind is the Chili Oil Incident."
As the last of my paroxysm shook through me, I relaxed my grip on my mid-night companion’s shoulders. I allowed myself to collapse, face-down, upon my bed, and lay there, quite unmoving, waiting for his nerve to break.
Piece by piece, we destroyed each other. I flooded a warehouse where he had been importing smuggled silks and linens. One by one, my little street Arabs began to disappear. I allowed Mycroft to pull the strings which led to his termination from his post at the University. A runaway hansom sent Wiggins to the infirmary with shattered legs. I orchestrated a raid that sent fifty of his men to the gallows. Bodies that were far, far too small surfaced occasionally in the Thames.
Sherlock moved in close and kissed him, cupping John’s buttocks through the thick twill and grinding their hips together. John groaned and kissed Sherlock’s neck above the bow tie. “Mmmmmmm,” Sherlock rumbled, stepping back. “But then I’d miss showing you off, and knowing that you’re just dying for me to take you home and flip your kilt over your head while I fuck you. Where would the fun in that be?”
"I can't. I'm dying. I need air."
I should have thought to set this right
He nodded, amused at the sensation of his brain sloshing around inside his skull. Yes, definitely no more drinking.
There was a case.
"You really don't give yourself enough credit. Oh, there's one more entry - " John crossed his other leg and took a sip of water, as Sherlock had managed to bring up a glass along with the hot chocolate. "This is dated some six years later.
I'm sure you're unaware, but men don't often announce to their best male friends that they would marry their friend's wives,
John shook his head, motioned towards Sherlock. "You first."
"She was nurse, John. That was part of her job. She was like you."
Swift as a bird, Sherlock bent down and kissed john on the cheek. When John looked up, surprised beyond all measure, Sherlock merely nodded once. "Read your book. I'm going to take a bath. Good night."
"Sleep well?" asked John, pouring tea into a cup. He pushed it towards Sherlock along with the sugar bowl.
Right. "If you like."
on the regular? Too right he did.
"That's not what I'm talking about and you know it," John tapped the book gently, making it rock on the arm of the chair. "I'm just saying."
"The journal? Yes, yes I do," he took a sip of tea and gathered his thoughts. "It's rare to come across an autobiography that hasn't had the most intimate emotional details of a person's life edited out. Here they are, though, in their most raw state. I'm actually surprised it wasn't burnt after being written. I keep reading, hoping for a happy ending."
I have a companion, now, and in this book I shall call him 'Victor'. He is the most wonderful creature I have ever met, full of life, vim, and vigor. He is everything my old college friend was not, and it was not until I met him that I understood the difference. His courtship was slow and steady and even now I wonder at his patience, for I was horrible in my disbelief of the depth of his feeling, and cruel in the way that only the desperate can be.
Sherlock flipped the paper up, then down again a moment later, a quizzical expression on his face. "Did you think no one would notice?"
"Mm."
"I...I should like to go in to town today," answered Sherlock quietly.
Sherlock looked directly at him and blinked, his eyes a little too wide. The great faker knew exactly what John was on about, even if he didn't want to admit it. "Really?"
"John."
Shit.
"All right. You can always change your mind in the morning, yeah?"
said they were distantly related, and being an genealogist, he should know. Anyway, it was very kind of him to offer the place in lieu of payment for services rendered. A case of identity theft, money laundering, and murder that had brought John and Sherlock to Edinburgh where they had all too soon learned that the depths of depravity were not owned by London alone. A harrowing chase through the underground vaults of the city had frazzled their nerves nearly to the breaking point, capping off the end of several months of hard work on human trafficking for Mycroft. John had thought he had understood how low humanity could stoop while in Afghanistan; Eastern Europe had proven him wrong. They had both needed a break, with even Sherlock looking utterly exhausted by the time the job had been 'completed'. Halted for an instant, more like. Not only that, old injuries had risen their ugly heads, to the point where Lestrade had simply shaken his head, refusing to pass them any more cases until they had had a rest.
"Yes, do," said Sherlock, adding another log on to the fire. "But first, I need a hot drink. Want anything?"
"You would have hated it," John said, chuckling.
After breakfast, they went for a walk. Sherlock was eager to see their surroundings, something about animal tracks and insects, bird's nests and spider casings, while John just wanted to get the hell out of the house. All those weeks of running around in London and Dubrovnik and Budapest, he found he couldn't give up the physicality of it all. He itched for action, not unlike his time in Afghanistan, when he was honest with himself. Besides, he had to work off his hangover.
Some time later he cracked one eye open, then the other, gazed at Sherlock's beloved profile, the structure of his face thrown into further bas-relief by the firelight. Oh, but he was feeling contrary tonight. "Have you ever thought about it? Kissing another bloke?"
Right now it was Sherlock's turn to stand in front of the window, arms folded, his back to John, who silently admired his friend's physical form, slim in his suits, surprisingly muscular when out of them.
3) Tea and Butteries, Warmed, with Blaeberry Jam
"John?"
Sherlock finally turned around, leaned against the windowsill. John was abruptly glad he had lit a few lamps before dinner. He had agreed with Mrs. Boyd about the day being right dreich, the morning's low and dark clouds never clearing. He hadn't been tempted outside at all, though Sherlock had popped out for a few hours. Lights had been necessary all day, in fact, though he had mostly sat next to the window in order to start Lewis Grassic Gibbon's 'A Scot's Quair', a classic he had somehow missed in school. Soon enough he had been called back to the journal and now only had a few pages left.
"I don't…speculate."
"Of course you did," John said equally softly. For of all the things he knew about Sherlock Holmes, his loyalty was beyond reproach. Still and all - Mary? "Why? Why her?"
The fields and hills surrounding the lodge had turned into shades of gold and ochre and sienna brown, interspersed with distant rectangles of the deep, black green of national forest pines, and the lighter greens of the natural forest in the area. The lodge's drive was private, running nearly two miles before it joined the main road. The metal gate was closed, though not locked, but Sherlock ignored it in favor of climbing over the stone wall. John followed, glad he had thought to bring his leather gloves, a habit he had picked up while Sherlock was gone. A gift from Mary, of all people. He still wore them, even after everything that had happened, because they were just a pair of gloves and thus useful and it wouldn't do to waste a useful thing.
"Many books of that nature were written in the 19th century, John."
"Of course," said John, a bit nonplussed. He hesitated for a moment. "Do you want company?"
"Oh come on, how on earth do you know that? And don't even tell me you deduced it out of thin air."
"I have my moments."
John shook his head. The poor bastard. There really was nothing worse than falling in love with someone who didn't return your affections. He would never forget Sharon, much as he would have liked to. Or Dora. She at least had deigned to give him a hand job at Richard's party before telling him to piss off, so there was that. He considered himself lucky, though, to have eventually been able to have a high rate of return from the women he set his cap to. Which was not the most politic thing to say these days, but it was the truth. He would deny it to his death bed, but secretly he was quite proud of being Three Continents Watson. Thing was, he was pretty sure he was more of Casanova than a lout. At least he'd never gotten the impression, he'd never heard an inkling of a rumour that he was a bad lover, and that counted for something. Or at least it did in his view. After all, hadn't Leonie played that one Missy Elliot song to death, winking at him and telling him he made her scream
An hour later, freshly bathed and in warm clothing, they met back in the snug by mutual agreement. John read a few more pages in the book, details of the author's background, before setting it down to pour himself yet another whisky. A bad habit to take up, even on holiday. The secret thrill of it had him enjoying it even more, made him a little reckless.
"You - you remember she almost killed you, right?"
"Oh, I don't know," John answered, eyeing Sherlock with the slightest smile. "I think I'm rather closely acquainted with one, myself."
am happy. Beyond happy. I doubt I have felt this since I was the littlest child, excited by the idea of a full belly and the promise of a nap after chasing butterflies in the garden.
John took Sherlock's silence as neither a yes nor a no, but rather a pregnant pause where anything was possible. He slowing leaned forward and touched Sherlock's lips with his own.
"Yes, but she had her reasons."
"Maybe just a glass of water?"
The case was child's play, and why Sherlock had gone on with it had John wondering. The postie was missing mail from his house for several weeks; turned out his aunt had been collecting it in the mistaken belief he had gone to Tenerife for three weeks. Beyond simple, nothing a few enquiries wouldn't have fixed. Oddly, John found himself unsatisfied with the result, even though the 'mystery' was solved. He felt himself out of sorts, lately, prone to long walks along the lane or through the fields. Sherlock was doing the same, funnily enough. Occasionally they met at the pub for lunch, or tramped  up into the hills, although neither of them had brought gear for such activities. Despite the time of year, the weather mostly held when they were out and about, apart from the one time they were caught in a sudden burst of rain, becoming drenched in seconds. Luckily they were only a mile from the lodge, an easy enough run. John noticed that Sherlock had a hand to his side when they arrived, pain from the bruised ribs, but Sherlock seemed in good spirits nonetheless. John figured anything serious would have Sherlock in a different state altogether, and thus said nothing.
Which was ridiculous, coming from Sherlock 'Only Consulting Detective in the World' Holmes. John knocked back the rest of his glass and carefully placed it on the table between their chairs. The decanter was right there, it would be easy enough to pour another finger or two, but he was already very pleasantly buzzed and didn't fancy trying to make it up the stairs with poor balance. Well. He had tried. Given Sherlock's bombastic relationship with Mycroft, John was hardly surprised to find Sherlock quiet on matters pertaining to his own body. Maybe Sherlock would find a partner some day, or maybe he had it off on the regular with one of his...cronies. Who that might be, John didn't know, though he found the very idea irritating. In a weird way, Sherlock was his - that's just how it was. He could grudgingly admit that Sherlock deserved someone to love him too, someone who wasn't John.
"1553," Sherlock said primly. "Decriminalized in 1967."
"Craig was just passing and I thought maybe you could solve his problem," said Mrs. Boyd, so much the mirror of Mrs. Hudson that John found himself wanting to call home just to find out if she wanted anything.
A log on the fire shifted, sending a shower of sparks flying upward. John glanced out the window. Although he could still read without one of the lamps turned on, dusk was falling swiftly. The view was nothing to write home about, merely a bit of lawn before the forest encroached, yet he felt as utterly at home, as if he and his ancestors had grown up here. The forest looked after him as he looked after it, and if that wasn't a bit of poetic nonsense at the hands of malt and barley, he didn't know what was. On the other hand, Gordon
John felt his cheeks heat and hastily looked down. Since Mary's death, Sherlock had become much more effusive with his feelings, and John wasn't sure he was entirely comfortable with it. Not because Sherlock was being honest so much as John felt he should be honest in turn, and he...he was not good at that. "Shall I read on? It's almost finished."
John snorted.
In time, I graduated.
"I thought so, too. Made in the American manner, with milk," said Sherlock, taking a seat. "I grew to love it when I was - "
"Irene?" huffed Sherlock incredulously. "A snake if ever there was one."
Sherlock looked at him, twitched away. "Hardly. Look in the mirror, John."
He closed his eyes at the gentle tone in Sherlock's voice. "Are you saying - did you - have you - ?"
John managed to eat the majority of the bowl - thank god it was small - before resting his spoon on the saucer. "Any chance of an egg?"
"I...can't explain further."
I spurned any and all attempts of romantic inclination at home and abroad, preferring not to take the risk of entanglement or worse, a repeat of what had happened with my friend. If I had known I was to see him but one other time, perhaps I would have been less adamant in matters of love.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "You know my methods by now."
Sherlock took his time in answering. "She was intelligent. Kind. Compassionate - "
"Poor sod," said John. "Bad enough to fall for someone who could care less, even worse to be treated like that. And in public! If the author were my friend I would have hunted down those bastards and given them what for."
his lust for me. Watch, how he taunts -
Morning finds Madonna, stately,
Almost as though we assumed our initial handshake to have been improperly performed, we continued to find excuses to touch each other. In any case, surely if the second handshake or fifth anointment of a wound or hundredth kiss had not revealed our connection, being roughly ravished on the seventeenth step after solving a particularly invigorating case or the long, slow swallowing of your prick on the settee on a summer's afternoon wouldn't do so, either. But that did not deter us.
I affected long shirtcuffs to hide my wrists as a precaution – not from the world, but from you. I wanted to spare you the knowledge that our strange affair would end in a coincidence of bitter cosmic humour. The two of us, ignoring the rest of the world, I had once thought. Yet the world had taken notice of us, and intended to come crashing down around us.
JHW, July 26
in hopes of saving a dying Englishwoman. I let you go. That deception – sending you on a fool’s errand, on that day, to try to save a phantom Englishwoman – was Moriarty's cruellest act, and I would have killed him for that alone.
"Well, good, me neither. We'll just have to keep working at it."
"Definitely the former. I was fifteen, and I'd been practicing for months for a violin recital at one of the community halls. One of the pieces I was playing was the Devil's Trill Sonata, which is an extremely complicated piece. A beautiful piece, too, but full of rapid gruelling double-stop trills. I had a recording of Itzhak Perlman playing it that I listened to over and over, every night, to get the rhythms into my brain."
Such was the line of my thoughts, and such was my torment and distress, that I began to wonder whether I could steal downstairs and avail myself of one of my friend's syringes of morphine in order to pass the time insensible until at least morning. Surely, this household was no stranger to drugged sleep and the keeping of queer hours? But no sooner had I turned my mind to trying to work out whether his supply might be kept in our shared rooms downstairs, or whether I might attempt to breach the sanctum of his bedroom in search of my relief, that I realized that I was idly considering succumbing to exactly that from which I dearly wished my friend would resolve to abstain. I pressed the heels of my hands to my eyes in frustration, alone in the dark. Clearly I had become a desperate man.
"All right, we both had awful early sexual experiences. So you see, I was right. The baseline was terrible so everything from then on can only improve. So, shall we see if we can top the last time?"
JHW, June 13
The cottage’s garden continues to produce well and I am beginning to harvest those vegetables which have ripened nicely, and which the deer and rabbits have not destroyed. I have created a perimeter of gorse and snares which appear to be a satisfactory deterrent. I have rebuilt the east wall of the cottage enough that the wind no longer howls through the gaps in the stone, though a strong rain will likely undo all my hard work.
John glanced up at Sherlock’s face. Still slack and peaceful. Either he was genuinely still completely asleep or was doing a wonderful job of shamming.
"Worst how? Worst partner, worst position, worst decision, worst orgasm?"
"Oh god."
And with that, he whirled and, gathering his coat and scarf from the hook in the hallway, clattered down the stairs to the street to hail them a cab. John breathed out deeply, counted down from ten, and followed him out into the snow.
I cannot explain the profound stillness in which I find myself this morning. I have wasted half the day in recording dreams. And yet, I dread the loss of even the fragmented memories which I do retain, and so have resolved to record as much as I may, so that I may think on this in the days to come.
I intend to return in the early year, fully prepared to make my permanent home in my cottage in the woods, just as soon as the first sap of spring begins to flow.
You were not the only Watson I visited on the 24th of April.
Seeing you there, with your as-yet-unnoticed wrist ringed in a black band, I realized what I had done and I was struck dumb with horror. Dimly, I watched you as you stood above the cauldron of the Reichenbach, calling my name. I could not reply. I did not wish to comprehend that you were standing before me. I could not help but wait for you to turn your attention to your wrist, and for understanding to descend upon you, as it had upon me.
I must admit that I was doing much the same, albeit not for the same reasons. I had, over time, discovered a vast criminal web operating in London with a spider at its centre, and I had been doing my best to snap as many threads of silk as possible. It kept me occupied.
John sighed, glancing at his own middle, which wasn’t too small these days either. “That does mean we have to get up.”
“Some of them are a bit old. And I’d much rather buy new ones if this experiment has the effect I’ve theorised.”
“I’d try it.”
They stumble heavily up the stairs, and then flop onto the sofa after hanging up their coats.
For the next week, they hardly left Baker Street. Clothes were abandoned, appointments cancelled. They resumed life quietly after that, mostly the same. Except for that one not-so-subtle change, the one that meant John could kiss Sherlock whenever he wanted. At last.
He felt Sherlock stiffen, then withdraw slightly from their embrace. “Quite.”
John raised an eyebrow.
John’s knee ached as he rounded the corner to their flat, lugging shopping bags as he went. Stairs weren’t quite as fun as they used to be, and his knee was starting to act up in damp weather. Unfortunately, London had plenty of that.
John swats at Sherlock’s hand, but his cheeks flush. “Christ. You’re impossible, you know that?”
When they broke apart, Sherlock hummed contentedly. “I did wonder why you’d started to pay so much attention to – certain areas, in bed. I feared you were trying to give me a subtle hint.”
John feels that warm jolt of arousal again, and thinks about how much he’d like to be the one to get Sherlock out of it. “Don’t forget we have ice cream at home,” he teases, hoping Sherlock won’t notice his flushed face.
“John.”
“About a stone?” John tried not to sound incredulous.
“Sherlock, love – I think this is your button.”
“You’re in good shape,” Sherlock rumbles in his ear. “I should know.”
you like this. It looks like you take care of yourself.” He paused. “Or at least,
“And get a few larger suits, just in case.”
“You’ve gained a pound,” Sherlock says, before John even steps on it.
“No idea.”
Sherlock smiled back.
“What?”
“Want to take a break?” John murmured into his ear, and Sherlock nodded, popping the rest of the scone into his mouth before tipping his head back to let John kiss his neck.
* * *
John grinned down at him. “I think we can remedy that.”
John wasn’t sure what was so damn arousing about this, but the fact was, they were both turned on beyond reason. Maybe it was the danger of it, actually -- Sherlock couldn’t afford to be truly fat, not really, so this kind of overindulgence seemed like forbidden fruit -- a truly foolish idea. Which meant it was also appealing as hell.
After that, Sherlock stopped complaining. It seemed that John’s persistent enthusiasm and lavishing of attention over every inch of new flesh had put his mind at rest. The sex continued to be amazing, and Sherlock’s weight crept up, slowly but surely.
“Maybe I cooked a bit while you were away,” Sherlock said, watching him, a smile at the corner of his mouth. He shut his laptop.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Why?”
Sherlock rolled to the side, pulling John with him. “Sorry to disappoint,” he said, and John could tell he was smirking in the dark.
John feels like he might incinerate. He wants to kiss Sherlock that badly. He nudges him back. “Hungry, were you?”
“Something like that." Sherlock turns to look at him. "I’ve liked… this. Eating together. It’s nice.”
“Mmm,” Sherlock said, edging his trousers a bit lower. “Hungry. Didn’t realise.”
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
“You, of all people, should never play dumb.” John tugged on Sherlock’s waistband.
“…Hungry.”
“We’ll see about that.” John heaves himself to his feet and frowns down at his waistline, which, now that he looks at it, is approaching a definite belly. “I’m going to get the scale.”
“You – you like me this way?” Sherlock asked hesitantly, after a moment.
John couldn’t figure out what to do. So he said nothing, but as soon as the lights went off and they went to bed each night, he continued to lavish affection on Sherlock’s middle. Sherlock, for his part, continued to take John to pieces with his hands and his tongue, as usual. And when they weren’t in bed, Sherlock continued to eat with his now-normal enthusiasm.
Sherlock exhaled. “I’d been afraid to say anything in case you wanted me to lose it.”
. One night in bed Sherlock straddled him, then leaned in to kiss his neck and let out a surprised “oof” of breath. John kissed his shoulder and began to laugh. Sherlock’s tum was in the way, pinning John down just enough that he felt a bit breathless.
“Sod that.” John heads toward the shower; Sherlock’s still watching him. “It’s all the food I’m cooking for you. That you’re not eating, I might add.”
So they didn’t turn down any invites, and instead spent a week sampling hors d’oeuvres and eggnog. After that, there was Christmas dinner at the Holmes country cottage, and more Christmas feasting back at Baker Street. On Christmas Eve, they tumbled into bed together buzzing from several glasses of good Scotch, and full to bursting with Sherlock’s roast and John’s Christmas pudding. They reached for each other, their kisses sloppy, a little breathless from overindulgence.
“Thirteen ten,” John breathed. Nearly two hundred pounds. The thought made his insides go absolutely molten. “No wonder.”
He looks up. Sherlock is blushing again. “Clearly not,” Sherlock says, but his voice is more fond than teasing.
“You’ve mostly put on muscle,” John added. “Which is completely unfair.” He glanced down at himself again. “And honestly, I’d better stop eating altogether if you’re thinking like that.”
Sherlock chuckled, and poked John in the side. “You’re not exactly slim these days, either.”
John groaned. “This is ridiculous.”
Sherlock heaved himself up, still unfairly coordinated despite the food and wine, and adjusted his shirt, which was riding up a bit over the generous bulge of his belly. As he did, his unfastened trousers began to slip, and he grasped the waistband at the side as John chuckled.
“I do think you need to lose these, though,” John murmurs, pulling at Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms insistently.
“Sorry,” John said quickly, casting about for an excuse.
“Nearly,” John says, as Sherlock brushes up against him: broad chest, long legs, and recently, the beginnings of a perfect little tum. Well, John thinks it’s perfect, anyway.
“Have at it all you like,” Sherlock said, taking a bite of toast. “Let’s see how long it takes you to deduce the reason.”
They switch places. “I’ve gained six,” Sherlock says. “Satisfied?”
Sherlock was rigid next to him. John swallowed. He had no idea what to say. It made no sense to deny it – Sherlock’s tum, full of supper, had just been squashed against John’s. “No, um. Well. Not fat, exactly,” John hedged.
“Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.”
“Go slowly,” John urged, as Sherlock’s hand crept lower. “I can hardly move.”
As Mary’s departure faded into the past, the mood in Baker Street steadily improved. They were busy, but not too busy, striking a balance between case work and leisure time. If John didn’t know better, he’d almost say Sherlock seemed… happy. The violin played soaring melodies these days, rather than cacophony. The wall hadn’t been shot at in ages. Sometimes, John came back from the surgery to find that Sherlock had even replenished the milk. Baker Street was starting to feel downright domestic.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
John opened the envelope. Inside were a stack of photographs, many at least a decade old – some even older. Shots from crime scenes, newspaper clippings of cases. All of them featuring Sherlock, and some with John as well. John grinned.
Sherlock pats his middle, which gives a definite jiggle. “Getting fat,” he grumbles.
John chuckles.
“Budge up. This sofa seats more than one, you know.”
Sherlock looked flushed, but was it embarrassment -- or arousal? John felt his own cheeks growing hot. Last time he’d checked, Sherlock had been thirteen stone -- up from his usual rail-thin eleven stone.
They’re at Angelo’s, which has become a more regular stop on the rotation of late. Against his better judgment, John has stuffed himself silly on a plate of lasagna and a basket of rolls. To John’s great delight, however, Sherlock has done the same, and they’ve drunk a bottle of wine between them. Sherlock shifts in his seat, adjusting his waistband, and John notes with surprise that Sherlock’s shirt buttons are looking more strained than usual, especially around his middle.
“Yeah, nope. No, Sherlock, you’re fine.” John grinned at him. “Better than fine. I
John pats Sherlock’s belly, which has started to make itself known, decidedly round under his soft grey shirt. “You’re entirely too lazy.”
Sherlock’s gaze went from irritated to heated. “I...”
John sighs. “Only a pound? It’s been a week and a half.”
Sherlock throws out his other hand, and John grabs it. The boards creak again, and Sherlock immediately slides forward toward the edge of the hole.
“Save one for me, will you?” John teased, as Sherlock reached for yet another scone, absorbed at his microscope.
Sherlock looked down at his phone again. “Maybe two,” he added, far more quietly.
“You look marvellous.”
“What’re you implying?”
“Must... experiment,” Sherlock gasped, before they became far too distracted to talk.
They tried to limit their experimental sessions, mostly because Sherlock would sometimes be out of commission for at least half a day, and they couldn’t always risk it. But even so, Sherlock’s weight stopped inching up, and instead, took a leap. It wasn’t until Mrs Hudson bustled in with their linens one afternoon that John truly noticed.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but actually looks pleased. “Are we done with this nonsense yet?” he says. “I’m nearly back to our usual weight.”
Sherlock chuckled, and his tum jiggled faintly. He rested a hand on it, where John had just kissed. “I’m getting fat, and it’s all your fault.”
But it was still surprising to see the effects of Sherlock’s indulgences slowly becoming visible. Straining buttons at Sherlock’s chest were joined by even more stressed buttons at his middle. Sherlock’s trousers began to look painfully tight at the waist, their bespoke tailoring unprepared for any added inches. Even his jacket buttons were beginning to look strained. Sherlock took to wearing his pyjamas more often, abandoning his suits as soon as they got home from a case, his pyjama bottoms pushed lower to accomodate his newly rounded little belly.
"Do you like the book?"
"That sounds ominous."
"Well, it's just that mail has gone missing from my house. Including my passport. This has happened before, so I've made sure to have a locked mailbox...
"Isn't that lovely? The perfect thing after a cold morning on the shoot. Of course back then you had everything else for breakfast too," said Mrs. Boyd, folding her arms and apparently settling in for the long haul by leaning against the sideboard. "It was so grand, when the lodge was filled with people. Mr. Carnahan loved his hunting, he did, and the fishing, too. Cook, she was my mum, taught me everything she knew. Those were the days."
John paused with his toast halfway to his mouth. Why on earth - ? What kind of man did Sherlock think he was? Surely Sherlock knew better by now. Surely he had known since the day they had met…? "My sister is gay, I was in the Army, I'm a doctor, I could care less."
Sherlock made a moue of distaste. "To a woman?"
"I've done things, John. Terrible things."
Sherlock blinked.
It was no use. They were going to have to talk about it.
"People have small minds, John. I would have thought you would be used to the comments by now."
With a sigh, Sherlock folded the paper and put it on the table next to his chair. "In this age we fail to remember that religion was all in the 16th century. The rhythm of life was the rhythm of the church, with very little between."
"Yes," said Sherlock, grinning. "Your hand prints in the dust were a trail even the Yard could follow."
"Mm."
"Maybe another day or two."
Sherlock nodded.
, he didn't go to church on Sundays or the high holidays, but he had a soldier's liking for it. He wouldn't consider himself pious only in the foxhole, it was just that his concept of god and holy things was perhaps more philosophical than simple church attendance might allow.
Oh fuck it, why not.
Sherlock jerked a nod.
"That's the way my Gran used to make it when I was a little girl," said Mrs. Boyd, hands clasped in front of her waist. Her pinny was gaily floral  and very representative of her personality. John had no doubt that she and Mrs. Hudson would get along fabulously. "Not for me, obviously, for my grandfather. But he snuck me spoonfuls when she wasn't looking, and I loved it!"
And then he winced again. He chuckled bitterly. "Can't seem to stop putting my foot in it, tonight. Sorry."
"Okay...we can try lunch at the pub, yeah?"
'I had forgotten I even wrote this journal, finding it some years after Father's death, and long after Mother moved to the Italian Coast for the warmth and the sea air.  How much has changed in the intervening years.
"I suppose that for people like you it's easy to forget that Christianity has much to answer for in this country, as well as others."
It was a comment that had John staggering to the whisky. He poured himself a second glass, added several drops of water. He drifted over to the window to stare out window. As happened every night, the mist was falling over the hills, ensuring the forest was no more than a dark haze within. Soon half the meadow would be gone, and then all would be invisible apart from the immediate spill of light from the window. When he felt ready, John took a deep breath. "What do you mean?"
Sherlock blinked at him.
"I think you liked her more than I did," said John slowly, because he simply could not understand why. "I mean, she completely snowed me...and you. So why doesn't that bother you?"
4) Black Bun
Despite the moisture in the air that promised rain at some point in the day, John quite enjoyed the walk. He felt strong, a man not quite in the peak of physical perfection, but not far off it, either. Sherlock still had a bit of a hitch in his gait from falling down the steps along the Thames, which was only to be expected given the rain and poor night time light.  He had hit the shingle hard enough to knock the wind right out of him, waving John after Tucker when John would ordinarily have stopped to make sure he was all right. John had brought Tucker down just past the bridge, nearly sending them both into the water. By the time John was bringing Tucker back, Sherlock was limping toward them.
John shrugged. "What's your point? It's not that big a deal, not these days. I mean, not in Britain. Not with non-religious people."
Sherlock chuckled. "You're a true friend, John, in the best meaning of the word."
At college, my former friend was gone. The friends of his who remained completely ignored me, although the majority of them also tried to catch me on my own and force me to perform acts - suffice to say they were illegal, even in the privacy of one's home.
"I slept like a rock, actually. Between the bed and the whisky I was out like a light," he continued, hoping to ease any awkwardness Sherlock might feel. The kiss had come back to him as soon as he had woken, and he could have kicked himself at his own stupidity.
Christ, he needed to go to bed, he wasn't making any sense to himself. John got up and stretched, groaned at the popping of his spine. He did a little side to side stretch too, immediately felt better for it. "I think I have to go to bed."
"Night," John murmured, unable to think of anything else to say.
Should I be lucky enough - '" John turned the page, and then flipped through the remainder of the book. The rest of the pages were blank. "That's it, that's all he wrote, whoever he was."
"I do, John. I do."
"You'll have to tell me, sometime. I'll let it cool a bit." said John, filling the space left by Sherlock's abrupt stop. He lifted the mug to his nose. Yes, perfect. He set it aside and picked up the book one more. "Ready?"
"Don't you think that's rather brave of a gentleman to write, never mind publish, in...1840?"
Sherlock conceded the point with a nod. "Mary was a consummate actress."
"Anyway, have you? Kissed a bloke?" asked John, before taking another sip of whisky. He didn't know why he wanted to know, he just did. Besides, it wasn't anything else but the truth. A person lived with someone long enough, of course they got curious. Sherlock had seen him through a multitude of girlfriends, which of course didn't include the women John had slept with and never brought home, because no, and of course he had gone and gotten himself fucking married, for fuck sakes, so little wonder Sherlock was giving him that look. "I'm just curious. We never talk about this sort of thing."
Hunh. "That's...wow."
Evenings were spent in the snug no matter if they were apart or together during the day, Sherlock flitted from book to book, muttering to himself and occasionally making calls in French or Italian and once, Greek. John found himself listening with bated breath, for though he had heard Sherlock 'speaking foreign', as his Granda would have said, it never ceased to give him a little thrill. Ridiculous, of course, because he knew more than a few multilingual people, but there it was. Something about Sherlock speaking in tongues was magical, miraculous, lovely to listen to and beautiful to behold. It made Sherlock seem...other worldly, even more so than normal. And how funny was that? To find his friend still so extraordinary, even after all these years?
A comment which left John blinking in surprise.
"Do you think you would have married, back in the day?"
John was too used to soldiers trying to be macho to allow Sherlock the chance to tell him that he was fine. He simply nodded at him, barked "At home," and miracle of miracles, Sherlock had simply accepted the command with a great deal of grace. Back at the flat John did some gently probing and while no bones had been broken, Sherlock was going to be in some pain for a few days yet.
"Oh, goodie."
He strode over to Sherlock with far more confidence in his steps than he might possibly have felt, or maybe his forward momentum was a little fast, he had drunk quite a lot, actually, given that parts of his brain were suggesting his sudden thought might not be a good idea after all. Then again, why the fuck not? Sherlock glanced up at him blankly, then canted his head to one side slightly, brows furrowing. John put one hand on the wing of the chair, the other on the arm, leaned in close. "Can I kiss you?"
"Sorry," John repeated, forcing a smile he didn't feel onto his lips. He shook his head. "Don't know what's wrong with me, lately."
John shrugged one shoulder. "Sure. Someone smart, like, I dunno...Irene Adler, say."
Sherlock steepled his fingers in front of his mouth, watching John carefully and with a little sadness in his gaze. "We're none of us free in the department of murder, John."
"I'm sure it's nothing so dramatic, nothing that won't resolve itself," added the postie, a pained expression on his face.
John took another sip of whisky. Thank god times had changed in Britain. No, that wasn't quite right, was it? Harry had had a terrible time with their parents, but that was part and parcel of growing up in that bloody house, gay or not. She was out, though he wasn't sure if she was proud. She seemed happy? He should make the effort to call more often...he wished talking to her didn't bring up things he didn't want to think about or discuss. God, he didn't want to think about it any more; it was over and done with years ago.
"Yes, I know," John forced himself to say calmly.  "I just wouldn't expect it to be out in the open, on the bookshelf like this. The laws against Homosexuality took effect in what, the 18th Century?"
"You're not…bothered by the subject?"
We are happy.
Sherlock nodded and slipped out of the room, leaving John to gaze at the fire and wonder just what the hell he was doing. Lately, over the past few weeks working the case that had taken them abroad, he had found himself thinking of Sherlock a lot, in ways that were, frankly, confounding. Yes, Sherlock was incredibly attractive, both physically and mentally. He was also a pillock, but then so was John. This was different, though. Mary had said something, once, to the affect that John didn't have much room for anyone in his life besides Sherlock, and that if he wanted to be a proper father, he was going to have to make a choice. At the time he had scoffed at her, thinking he knew better. The baby was here now, and he had discovered there was some truth to her words after all. Truth, but not the whole truth. Rosie was a good baby, a pretty baby, and he loved her with every fiber of his being - just as he did Sherlock. A different kind of love, obviously, though not by much.
After a pause in which all John could do was stare at Sherlock, mouth open, "Are you fucking kidding me? All we went through and you'd marry her?
Sherlock said nothing. Instead, he stood, straightened his jacket, and took the single step to approach John.
John pondered. No, he wasn't religious
'By the time I fully recovered my health, the term was over and I was sent home for the summer. Though I was determined to never return, Father was of a different mind entirely, and I was made to go back or suffer my inheritance. Father is very strict in this manner, believing in the power of Education about all. Also, he does not wish to see the house or his fortune squandered in ignorance.
With my father in good health, I went to South America in search of adventure and the pursuit of my own fortune. There was much toil, and danger, and more than once I nearly lost my life to disease and snakes, to a wild boar's tooth and the resultant infection. I accomplished what I set out to do, and within a few years returned home, triumphant in will and spirit.
He was almost at the point where he didn't have to remind himself of such every time he put them on.
Just as John was beginning to feel less relaxed and more antsy, the Postman was shown into the snug by Mrs. Boyd.
Sherlock must have twigged John's annoyance. "By which I mean non-religious."
They fell into a silence. John took the initiative and split the two day old
"Yes, thank you," Sherlock came around John's left to take a seat at the table.
The pub, when they finally reached it, had a roaring fire going in the heart, and was, even at this time of day, filled with locals. There was a brief lull in conversation as folk looked to see the visitors, but the volume of laughter and talk soon regained its strength. Though it was a little soon after his breakfast, John found he was hungry enough to eat lunch. One homemade steak and kidney pie and a bowl of buttery mash later, he was utterly full and quite pleased about it. Even Sherlock had eaten, which still surprised John. He was glad to see it, however. Neither of them were getting any younger.
Sherlock bent the top corner of the paper over to peer at John. "Yes? What about it?"
"Good night," said John, waiting just long enough to make sure Sherlock didn't want another kiss. Not that he was necessarily interested himself...he would hate to deprive Sherlock of something he wanted, that was all. With this in mind, he left the room, carefully closing the door behind himself. A satisfactory experiment. He went upstairs to his room, washed up and performed his usual nightly ablutions before falling into the massive bed. Big enough for four, if a person were so inclined. Ah, there had been a time in his life when...drink had loosened him up enough to contemplate memories of leave, Colchester when he was a lad, frantic couplings when he was a med student, half-insane with exhaustion from being on duty for 24 or 48 hours. Necessary training, and it was that that killed any thoughts of further stress relief between the sheets. He curled up on his side, cozily wrapped in an old-fashioned down duvet, a fluffy (but not too fluffy) cushion beneath his head. He was half-way asleep when he thought of what he had done in the study, and gave a 'ha!' as to his own chutzpah, as Steinberg would have said. Before he got blown up, anyway.
Sherlock looked at him earnestly. "Do I get a kiss to make it all better?"
"There's a bit of a break here...ah.
"Mary," Sherlock announced. "If I were forced to marry, it would have been Mary."
1) Loons
Sherlock stilled, his mouth drawn down so much that John was instantly sorry he had asked. "Listen, it's okay - "
"Sher - "
I was in Bath, waiting for an acquaintance I had met on the ship, and decided to take the waters at the Pump Room, trying to dispel the slight nausea I had been feeling upon my return to England, when I saw my old college friend and his wife across the spring. He was staring at me, distracted enough that his wife had to tug at his sleeve to garner his attention. As soon as she realized he was looking at me, she looked, and then gave a little wave. He immediately forced her hand down, and that was enough for me. I tipped my hat at her, turned, and promptly left the Pump Room.
"He did NOT!"
"If the continent fits..."
"Yeah, not seeing the sexual connection here, Sherlock."
wrapped my waist and offered slim chance,
I had never been much interested in domestic bliss or partnership, and I had seen more than enough of the desperation which compels men and women to spend their time seeking their counters instead of actually living their lives, or else withering despondent over surviving an expired term. Having considered the question in my youth, I had resolved to live my life uncountered, unbanded, and ringless.
because I want with all my might
"....No."
The air was flat and still, and it seemed the entire city had collapsed under the weight of the heat that remained trapped between the pavement and the low, oppressive atmosphere. Barely a sound reached my ears from outside my opened window, which had been thrown wide in hopes of catching the smallest errant breath of air. Sleep had eluded me for many hours now, and, cursing the omnipresent heat that brought my mind back to the worst and brightest days of Afghanistan, I once again drew a clean rag from the wash-bowl, wrung it slightly in the basin, and passed it, dripping, from the tops of my feet to the edges of my collarbones in hopes of cooling myself enough to be able to drop into the elusive arms of Morpheus.
but I was made to love no other.
There must have been an unfriendly pair of eyes on us as we stood in your doorway, bidding our final goodbyes. She could not have known that she had become a piece in Moriarty’s great game of chess. With her innocent kiss, she had been revealed to be my secret queen; a loss that would devastate every facet of my life and legacy, whether I survived him or not. No matter what the outcome of the fourth of May, Moriarty putting Mary between the crosshairs of his sniper’s rifle ensured that any of us who saw the dawn of the fifth would wake to a bleak and empty world.
"No, of course not - I didn't grow up in a sitcom. Shan and me had a good laugh and then spent the rest of the night standing in the shower with our bits slathered in yogurt. Couldn't look each other in the eye without giggling for a week. We broke up three months later when she fell out of love with me. Don't look like that. It can happen, especially when you're young."
JHW, June 10, 18-
I do not recall every particular of the dream. I remember the taste of grass, and mushrooms, and summer. I remember a vivid moment of finding myself with my nose pressed to the inner joining of his thigh, himself entirely buried in my throat to the very root, just as I was in turn in his mouth. I remember tongues, slippery-wet and tasting of silt and sky. I remember wool under my fingers and the feeling of fine paper as I gripped the globes of his arse. I do not remember any words spoken between us, nor of any moment of departure. I remember only pleasure and the sensation of strength and life flowing into me. I slept deeply and well at long last.
"That ... does not sound appealing."
She says she knows what kind I am:
I do not believe in fate. I reject the machinations of an unfair universe which brought you to me and did not permit me to have the last day of our earthly acquaintance emblazoned on my wrist. I would have cherished every day spent with you, knowing that you were mine. I cherish each of them nonetheless.
Selfishly, I was glad you were with me. I did not know whose last days I was savouring more. I would not have spent them more gladly with anyone else.
On an otherwise unremarkable day in midwinter of '87, when a gaunt, tanned military man recently invalided home from service shambled stiffly into the Barts upper chemistry laboratory where I had been working, I felt certain, with the arrogant naïveté of youth, that my life’s term was about to be revealed.
danced the final
John knew that, antisocial as Sherlock was, he hadn’t purposefully burrowed into sleep to avoid the evening’s festivities. John knew genuine exhaustion when he saw it. They had been visiting Mummy over Christmas, with all the paper hats, acrid dinner conversation, and charade choices from thirty years ago had taken a lot out of Sherlock; then visiting Harry in Aberdeen for her awkward “Everything’s Normal, Damn it” weekend following that had taken the rest. They’d only arrived back in London that morning, and even if they had (mostly) slept on the train, they were both exhausted.
It was all I could do not to burst out laughing at this statement, but I soon regained my composure. "Indeed? You come creeping into a private residence EXACTLY like a thief in the night, and you're merely looking for some … refreshment?”
Gently, John cupped Sherlock’s testicles through the crotch of the trousers, enjoying their heat and weight. Pinching the zipper pull, he undid Sherlock’s fly and stroked his fingers into the gap. Huh. No pants. John wasn’t sure whether to chalk that up to pride or lust – either Sherlock hadn’t wanted to ruin the line of his trousers across his arse, or had been planning for a bit of impromptu post-midnight frisky –  but either way, the effect was utterly sinful. He carded his fingers through the tightly coiled pubic hair, tugging lightly, and stretched a little further down to stroke his fingers along the length of Sherlock’s dormant cock before withdrawing to undo the button and hook closure.
However, it is not for nothing that I have lived with Sherlock Holmes for lo these many years, although I am sure he would not hesitate to scoff at my attempt to ape his methods. I knew that it was a fatal mistake to theorise ahead of the facts, and therefore I would wait to be certain as to whether my nocturnal visitor was a dangerous and vicious enemy or merely a lusty tomcat on the prowl. I kept myself hidden among the shadows, and waited.
Nothing appeared.
I tuck away the sheet.
Of all the songs on all the nights!
And you will drown in me.
bedfellows so brief.
My first task, after ensuring that the well remains sweet, is to clear away enough of the encroaching brush and saplings as have taken root in what was plainly at one time a sizeable vegetable garden. The earth is good, fertile and black, and once the crust has been broken it turns with, if not ease, at least not impossibility. There are few stones to hinder my progress. I hope that I will have more clement weather before the next rains begin.
At times our physical paths would cross, and we would rut together even as we vowed between gasps to strangle the life out of one another at the first opportunity. I took to carrying an extra set of drawers in my coat pocket, so that I could dispose of the remnants of our disgusting trysts and proceed with my daily mission of causing him as much inconvenience as possible. We were attracted to each other even as we repelled each other, like a pair of magnets spinning between north and south at random.
I could not hold back my deepest passions any longer – I pulled him towards me, and kissed him thoroughly. My hand went to stroke his hair, and was surprised when its familiar sleek smoothness was interrupted by the band of black fabric. I began to undo the knot of his mask, when my wrist was caught in a vicelike grip.
JHW, November 12
"Oh god."
"Nothing. Just reminded me of something. So ... what was the worst sexual experience you've had?"
Well, except...
March 15, 1894
Sherlock snored delicately on.
"Hey. Team effort. But yes, also, thank you."
JHW, June 24
I lay sleeplessly in my bachelor bed in my bedroom at Baker Street, where I had taken rooms some years earlier with my intimate friend, the detective Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I hadn’t seen Holmes for days, which was not unusual, but that I should have had no word from him at all vexed me more with each passing day. Still, I resolved to put such thoughts aside until morning, and to take advantage of having the house entirely to myself.
“Thass right, innit? Now, what sort of refreshment could a fine upstandin’ gentleman like yersself offer a poor beggar like me on a night like this?” And the blighter licked his lips.
her,  I love as would a brother;
Perhaps is such a cheat.
She must have known that I was leading you to your most certain death. She knew that you expected that she would be the one to be decorated with the mourning counter band. She knew that she would need to carry the burden of facing the rest of her life in a world where she had known and lost you. She would have honoured your memory, and kept your name alive on her lips for the rest of her days. But I had been stupid enough to visit her in her house, and to allow her to kiss me on the cheek as I left. I can still feel it, though it has been nearly two years. I think I shall always feel it, burning like a caress.
I have just awoken from a night of waking dreams such as I have never experienced, not even when I was a young lad and visited often by nocturnal visions of tempting images. I recall then that my nightly spectres had taken a variety of physical form, some impossible to mention at the time, even among my schoolboy chums. I had thought that I had outgrown the mental  weaknesses which showed me such incubi. But my sleep last night was troubled by such images as seemed most real, as real as the table, book, and pen I see before me now.
JHW, August 21
"He did. For five years. Stop laughing."
up on the weekend. Turnabout was always fair play in the Holmes-Watson household.
I remember when your false hands
"Really?"
Well. Such cheek could certainly not go unpunished within the hallowed halls of Baker Street. Never taking my eyes off the villain, I tucked my gun into the second drawer of my dresser. I noted that his sharp eyes followed my every move, but I was resolved to press my advantage to the fullest. I realized that my member had been stirring since first I rose from behind the bed, and now jutted proudly out before me, as though straining to batter my intruder senseless.
watching as I make my shaking
To pass those years, I wrapped myself in casework, cocaine, and morphine. Occasionally you would join me on my particularly interesting dalliances, but for the most part you were at home, making the most of your time with Mary, and she of her time with you. I had expected you to visit me at some point to tell me that you were expecting joy, but that never occurred.
You'll love it. I will be enough.
I have no idea how long I lay in the dark, blowing rhythmically across myself, but I believe I was nearer sleep than I had been for hours when all of a sudden I was on alert. I froze, wondering what had aroused my soldier’s instincts, and pricked up my ears to listen intently. Had there been a sound from the rooftop outside?
"Comparison without a baseline is meaningless. You can't have been having progressively better sex with me unless your previous sexual history was appalling."
JHW, August 11
I have found a charming glade, perhaps two mile or so from the cottage.
"You didn't."
"There are limits. Can't all three dance."
"Bet you half a pot of yogurt that I can fix that. Hand me my laptop."
I hung a fortnight on a chain,
While Sherlock dressed in his usual black-as-midnight, tight-as-sin evening wear, John had tartaned himself up in his father’s kilt and charlie, even pulling out the fly plaid and giant amber faux cairngorm brooch. His cream hose were neatly folded over his matching Watson-tartan flashes, and his razor-sharp sgain dubh was tucked securely into his left hosetop. Into his sporran he’d tucked ID, cash, and a small flask containing Highland Park 18 for luck. If he did say so himself, he thought he looked rather dashing.
John continued to devour his lover’s cock - sometimes sucking, sometimes licking, sometimes scraping his teeth lightly over the flesh - as Sherlock began to moan and shift his hips up to meet him.
"That is either going to be a very disturbing story or a very boring one."
but I cannot bear release.
Moriarty began his campaign to dismantle my life. I believe he was pleased rather than dismayed that our term was so short; he would have me and kill me, or we would head together to the Beyond. An eternal extension of term, perhaps.
I had just finished climbing the treacherous cliffs beside the falls when I saw you. I was hunting Moriarty's favourite colonel, a sniper who I was sure had taken your life from a safe and cowardly distance as you returned to the hotel to assist your nonexistent patient. I was certain that he was lying in wait for me to return down the mountain path, should Moriarty's plans for us to finish together have failed, as indeed they had. I was so convinced of my own cleverness in sussing out Moriarty’s contingency plan, that my bowels turned to water and my mouth to ash as you strode furiously into view and up the path.
At half-five, they’d gone down to share a lovely New Year’s Eve meal with Mrs Hudson –  “Oh, I never can stay up to midnight these days, loves, just can’t keep my eyes open. I’ll ring in the new year in the morning.” – and Sherlock had actually eaten everything on the plate Mrs Hudson had put together for him, which, John realized, had almost certainly contributed to the sudden somnolence.
If there is any justice in the world, I hope with every fibre of my being that it was quick and that she did not suffer. I have it on good authority that modern air rifles are powerful indeed, and that Colonel Moran is very skilled in his despicable pursuits. Certainly, I did not read any sensationalist nonsense in the newssheets. Merely that a woman in countermourning was shot dead as she dozed beside her own fireplace, and that the police had no suspects.
very sincerely,
In the semi-darkness, it seemed as though I saw a man standing in the centre of the room, quite still, but certainly intently watching me as I dreamt in the bed. I sensed no malice or evil intent from the apparition, nor was my dreaming brain concerned enough to question whether the intruder be man or spirit. By the light of the banked fire I discerned that he was tall, thin but with a muscular sturdiness about him. His hair was as wild as a sheep’s coat. His skin was of a pallor which caused him to appear to glow like snow in moonlight. He was entirely without clothing, but stood as though completely unashamed, bold as a Greek statue. I found myself noticing that his feet and legs were neither damaged nor covered in dirt, as I would expect a corporeal intruder’s to be had such a man walked nude through the forest, and I relaxed further into the dream, quite unconcerned.
With the barest hint of a smirk, he did as I'd instructed. "Now, now, guv, no need to get your knickers in a twist – so to speak, anyway. I was just thirsty, was all, and was looking for a place to stop where I might find a drop or two to my liking." The voice emanating from my visitor had more Cockney twang in its accent than the broadest review comedy act.
The bees have indeed made their home within this glade, in a lighting-cracked tree just within  the green-carpeted area. The hive appears to my eye to be quite massive, and while I at first was apprehensive of making the bees uneasy enough to set upon their human intruder, they have thus far paid me no mind. I shall mark the spot and return once I have read up a little more on the harvesting of honey from a wild hive.
"Mycroft later made it his ring tone."
As he disappeared out the window – and bedroom – from whence he came, no doubt to climb down to his own chambers like a madman instead of using the stairs, I sighed with contentment, and hoped that the heat wave would continue for a good long time. I fully intended to sleep with my windows open until January.
Perhaps I never saw you wed.
"No."
"Why?"
It soon became apparent that it was not an amorous moggy, but was a man of unknown origin. He stood just outside my window, balancing with ease upon the rooftop tiles, and though I could see little more than his outline in the waxing moonlight, I could tell that he was peering into my chambers. He turned his head, perhaps to ensure that no witnesses were party to his imminent ingress, and I saw his profile clearly against the sky. He was a lean man, but muscular, and clearly no stranger to breaking and entering, from the relaxed set of his shoulders.
"Yes it was. It involved you with your cock on fire."
I have packed up that which I would be distressed to lose to the elements, and will be travelling now to the nearby city of ---- to spend the winter. I intend to work as a physician or barber, or, failing that, a labourer or porter. My body is strong as it ever was - stronger, perhaps -  and I am willing to seek my fortune for a time amongst the towns nearby. I will leave this journal well hidden in my cottage. I can no longer bear to think of burning it.
I immediately felt the term rise like a bruise upon my skin. I was not prepared by any medical or anecdotal description for the swirling tempest of pleasure and attraction which coursed through me, from the bottoms of my feet to the top of my head, and which flowed down my arm to the point of our contact. Throughout, Moriarty never took his eyes from my face, though he must have been feeling the same things I was.
The spectre at the feast.
You chose to accompany me on my more dangerous and interesting adventures, confident in your term. You were dangling your life in front of fate like a morsel of meat in front of a caged cat.
Tightening my grip upon my pistol, I resolved to teach this brute a lesson he'd not soon forget, if he became so bold as to enter into my domicile unannounced. And look – here he came, bold as you please and quiet as a mouse, stepping gracefully over the windowsill and into my bedroom. He wore a thin black mask across his nose and brow, and the rest of his attire was similarly black as sin and as fitted to his body as a well-worn leather glove. A couple of quiet sniffs told me that my visitor was scenting the air, as a predator does while seeking its prey. He reached out and patted my recently-vacated bedclothes with a delicately probing hand. Apparently satisfying himself that the bed and thus room were unoccupied, he turned to the lamp on my night table and turned it up enough to illuminate the room.
"Dick. Call it practice, then. You can't get good at something unless you work at it."
John Watson was a superstitious man. No one comes through a combat zone without getting used to a little forced luck – throwing spilled salt over a left shoulder, never putting boots on a bed, picking up coins and then throwing them into a fountain with a wish. So, by God and all that’s holy, he intended to be kissing his lover at midnight to ensure that the coming year was filled with more of the same. There was a bottle of real champagne from France chilling in the fridge next to the baggie of ears packed in salt. They had bacon and eggs and orange juice waiting for breakfast - which, John fervently hoped, would be more in the mid-to-late-afternoon range. Possibly after some New Year’s Morning shagging.
Sherlock turned onto his back, humming softly and smacking his lips. He stretched briefly, then settled again, the long column of his throat white in stark contrast between his hair and black bow tie. John pursed his lips.
"Thank you."
I walked over to the man until my cock was but a hand’s length away from his masked and upturned face. I could see his own trousers were concealing quite the cosh. “I do believe I have something to spare, yes,” I said, and stroked my thumb across his bottom lip, pulling it down. His mouth opened readily, and without further penny-dreadful dialogue I allowed him to suckle at my cock – to slake his suffering, you understand.
John checked his watch. Just after 10:30. If he started trying to wake Sherlock up now, they could still make it to Molly's at a reasonable, if not respectable, hour. By 11:30, at latest.
I glimpsed a brighter green through the trees than I had ever seen in this country. It reminded me of the grass in front of a palace, thick and well-kept and greener than the finest emeralds in the crown. In the months since I have been in occupation of the cottage, I have found no other place or colour like it. During my foraging rambles, I have found wild places and stoney outcroppings and high heathered hills and dank swamps and open fields, but nothing that I would have considered pleasant. I cannot help but wonder what happy combination of elements have led to the growth of such a singular environment.
He says that I must. He speaks to me in harsh secrets and beautiful truths. He tells me the difficult things I must do, that we might be as one.
Yours.
Well. Certainly by midnight.
I am certain that this bafflement was where our affair began.
John reached up under the smooth white linen shirt until he found a nipple, then rolled it between his fingers. He flicked it with a fingertip as he swallowed Sherlock completely.
I have written you my confession, my dearest Watson, to tell you that I am the cause, even though I was not the author, of your wife's death. If there is any god to hear it, I pray for Mrs Watson, and I thank her daily for her sacrifice. I have spent these last two years wiping every trace of Moriarty's network from the earth, in her memory and for the preservation of whatever happiness can be salvaged from your future.
who fucked with death and came again.
My dearest, dearest fellow, if nothing else I only ask that you believe me: I have always been, and will always remain until whensoever my truly final day shall be,
"You. Are a ridiculous man. Shove over, I've only got room for one leg."
I reached out to run my hand up the pale, cream-like thigh, and the muscles beneath were as hard and strong as oak. His own prick was pale and unremarkable, except for its perfection. I thought again of Greek statues, of their sexless virility and of their powerful immobility.
The first place I had gone on that day was to your house, to reassure myself that you and Mary were both still well, and to bid you goodbye. Your Mary was a formidable woman. She saw that what I really required was permission to take you, for those last days. She knew that you would never hesitate. She gave me her blessing, and kissed me on the cheek at the door. She loved you well enough to let you go on your own, and to endure what came after bravely.
“Oh, oh, fuck,” Sherlock swore, as John swirled his tongue over every exposed millimetre. “Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhh!”
I recall well that as soon as you touched her, the connection that immediately blossomed between you was more obvious to me than a muddy footprint on a marble floor. You could not have noticed, but I strode immediately away, deeper into the gardens, to give you the privacy of your discovery, and so that I would have enough time to compose myself. I would rather have walked naked through Piccadilly Circus than let you see my streaming eyes. But of course, you only saw each other.
John bent at the waist and stroked his left hand along Sherlock’s thigh from knee to groin, admiring the rough-slick feeling of the fine fabric under his palm. “Sherlock,” he said, softly. “Come on. Up.”
I will write to the Royal Bank in London to forward the installments of my pension which have gone unclaimed. With the funds I shall receive in the towns over the winter months, I shall purchase provisions for better rebuilding and fully settling into my cottage next year.
We had a little less than two weeks remaining in our term when he burned me out of Baker Street. Mrs Hudson survived, though the skin on her hands and arms would forever be twisted and scarred. I ensured that she would have the means to escape London as soon as she was well enough to travel.
