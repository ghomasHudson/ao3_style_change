“Would you like to officially become Chloe’s dad?” John asked, pronouncing each word clearly and slowly.
“Anything?” John called up at him.
Time is now. Add on palette next to night sky blue.
“Well, that’s what put me on the right track, yes.”
As Sherlock now sat in Lestrade’s office, waiting for the finalisation of the paperwork surrounding his witness statement, and craving a cigarette rather badly, he couldn’t help but think how one of the most baffling features of this whole case had been the fact that when Mary (Rosamund) had entered that clay workshop in Venice last November, looking for a place to hide the Black Pearl that she and her pal Amit Joachim had just stolen, there had apparently been such a large collection of various drying figurines to choose from that she’d been able to pick an actual damned Thatcher bust to hide it in. It had likely been meant as a huge middle finger to him and John, seeing as they’d had a case over four years ago that John had elaborately described on his blog under the title ‘The Six Thatchers’, in which a man had hidden a murder weapon in exactly the same way; inside a still wet Thatcher clay bust. Also a batch of six.
John found the world to be a different place since their date at The Golden Beehive. Not only did he strut through London feeling proud as a peacock for being engaged to the world’s only Consulting Detective, but also he felt sluttishly naughty at the idea of having spread his legs for another man – and it was exhilarating.
Sherlock swallowed, in a futile attempt to make his lip stop trembling. Even that hurt.
There. Done.
His mind had raced over the options as to how Sherlock had come by them. Various sorts of accidents crossed his thoughts before settling on the inevitable.
, made it all a very simple puzzle that could have been solved by a five-year-old.
He felt a sudden pang at seeing Sherlock lie motionless on the floor and quickly tried to push away the images of that other time he’d seen him like that. The bastard was good at faking these things.
(What if his diagnosis was wrong and there was something awry with his vertebrae as well? He couldn’t risk changing anything about John’s position and causing him even more harm.)
Sherlock and John were right behind it, on the sofa.
“Oh, sorry,” Smith said, softly. He paused for a moment. “Yes.” He chuckled briefly. “You mean, am I a serial killer, or am I just trying to mess with your funny little head? Well, it’s true.” He walked around the head of the table while John looked at him grimly. “I do like to mess with people...”
That was nice, Vivian thought. And she closed her eyes. At this point in her life, it was just nice to be…
There was a five-minute break, during which the others discussed which Hamlet they preferred, and teas and coffees were brought in.
Now that he properly recognised Mycroft’s motivations, it would become much easier to no longer let himself be provoked by the protective manner in which he was always behaving and meddling.
Sherlock found himself repeatedly needing to push away the thought that maybe it had just been the wine, that John would regret what had happened as soon as morning came.
Sherlock had merely raised one eyebrow and given him a blank stare.
There were only two new tweets since he’d last seen him – and not very informative ones at that.
Sherlock heard John reply close to his ear with what he thought must be a happy sob.
Sherlock thought of Irene, but she was safely out of the picture. He considered for a moment. “Janine,” he said eventually. She was in fact probably at Baker Street right now, waiting to look after him and give him his pills. It was her turn, this afternoon.
“Are you really sure?”
Three days had passed. John had hardly eaten. But he hadn’t drunk either. Well, only fruit juice. So that at least was a good thing, he reckoned.
Crikey, what a way to find out that he and John were an actual item after all. If they hadn’t kept it a bloody secret, he wouldn’t have just bloody barged in on them like that, would he, now?
At one point, three courses into their meal, Mummy very deliberately put down her cutlery and rested her chin in her hands, smirking. “You’re in love with him, aren’t you?”
“It calms the nerves.”
Better than ever before, in fact, seeing as they’d barely had any of the personal friction they’d used to have regularly in the past. Mainly because Sherlock had stopped putting body parts in the fridge and mould samples in the sink without informing John beforehand. Apparently, as long as he simply
“So, you’re from around here, then?” Charlotte asked, his fake eyelashes fluttering up and down comically under his earnestly wrinkled brows with every eye movement. John couldn’t help but notice how his purple eyeshadow had been applied with admirable perfection.
“Who were involved?”
“How was it?”
Mycroft was probably just trying to soften his feeling of guilt over losing sight of Eurus after Jim’s death. He sat in the other chair next to John’s bed and attempted to look sympathetic.
The skinny dark-haired boy with the dog-paw tattoo flat on his back with his knees drawn up high as the muscled blonde pushed into him. The same youth bent over a desk with the other man slowly entering him from behind, while he turned his head so that they could kiss at the same time. The boy with his back against a wall, his legs wrapped around his partner’s waist as he was being held tightly in place by the blonde, whose hips meanwhile rhythmically moved forward and back.
John was pushing Sherlock against the wall; with Sherlock’s legs wrapped high around John’s torso. John had his head tilted at an angle near to where Sherlock’s neck met his collarbone – like a lion quietly choking its prey, Angelo thought amusedly – as he steadily rocked into him. The prey, in this case, was very willingly undergoing this treatment, letting his head fall back the other way – mouth wide open in a silent cry of delight – while tightly holding on to a ridge in the wall with both hands for balance.
“Mycroft, we know.”
In the background, they head Mummy ask, “Isn’t that just the same breed we used to have, only a different colour? The ears look very similar.”
“Hm. Do you have any connection to South Africa at all?” Sherlock asked, finally.
When he woke up a second time, the bed was cold and empty. He sat up with a start, only to hear typical John Watson breakfast preparation noises coming from the kitchen.
“Not really. Except the minor fact that Redbeard was wearing his leash, which was a little unusual to begin with, on the premises, but moreover, it was broken. When autumn came, we discovered the other end of the leather leash in the flower bed nearby the spot where the nanny found you.”
Sherlock felt a shiver down his spine. Then he got up and left, slamming the door tightly shut behind him.
It was an evening full of shy smiles and occasional tentative touches; a quick kiss on Sherlock’s forehead as John handed him a cup of tea after dinner, a hand on John’s shoulder while they were doing the dishes – together, for once.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock sighed, interrupting his song to roll his eyes.
Sherlock carefully put it in the breast pocket of his jacket, as close to his heart as possible.
Sherlock reached for his phone the minute he walked out of the residential care home. He was brimming with excitement to tell John what he’d just learnt: his brother was innocent.
The odious teenage girl with the unusual Greek name (“
“Sherlock…,” he’d rasped.
John, longed for him to take over control and let Sherlock switch off his mind, to dictate all of Sherlock’s bodily sensations, to fuck him slow and deep, to
Also, last year, Sherlock had spent weeks organising John’s wedding at the cost of his own work, like it was the most natural thing in the world to drop everything in order to help John. Not to mention he’d previously jumped off a bloody building, risking his own life to save John’s. He’d spent two years under mostly ghastly circumstances, disabling Moriarty’s network to safeguard other people’s lives.
He knew perfectly well that Sherlock’s phone’s battery needed charging every night, and he knew for a fact that Sherlock had not taken his charger with him when he left for Wantage yesterday, so those two things combined provided a perfectly plausible explanation for why he couldn’t be reached.
He went over to the kitchen to pour himself some of the coffee John had made and sat at his desk, in the chair that was still vaguely warm from John’s body heat.
He put down the phone and narrowed his eyes at John for a moment in silence. Then he took a large breath. “Let’s move to the Britannia.”
Time suddenly seemed to fall away, years disappearing into infinite space. They were both even standing in the exact same spot as they had that first time they’d been in this room together and he’d spoken those same words, just before dashing off on their first joint case.
’ screamed through John’s brain, but that would be something for later – if ever. What he really meant was ‘

busy right now,” she said, her voice suddenly low and conspiratorial. The poor woman looked a bit flushed. Had he interrupted her elliptical trainer workout? “It might be best not to disturb them at the minute,” she added, articulating rather exaggeratedly. She reminded him of the next-door neighbour back when he was a kid: overly sweet to the point of being a tad annoying.
“Hmm. I’d expected a similar approach from Sherlock, but he’s the exact opposite, isn’t he? He’s really good at comforting her, listening to her.”
Or could it have been a scam, once more?
After pushing away the duvet, he slung an arm around John’s chest and smiled blissfully.
“The way you’re talking...” He stopped.
“Poison?”
“Well. We drank tea. He gave me a painting of Redbeard.”
It was pulling at him in every cell of his body. A new and strange urge that left no room for his previous doubts and reservations.
Two cups of tea and one more changed nappy later, Sherlock padded into the kitchen. “Morning, handsome,” he yawned, gently squeezing the back of John’s neck.
There was only one small obstacle, if he wanted to say anything back, or ask any questions. Sherlock couldn’t for the life of him make any sort of realistic drawing.
“Mummy,” he said, through gritted teeth, “do I
She smiled vaguely as she entered, tilting her head as she tentatively raised her eyebrows, wordlessly asking how he was, if it was okay to come in. “Hi there.”
“Now, regarding Mummy’s birthday,” Mycroft began, visibly tired. “I’m arranging a little dinner party on 28 October. You will be coming, I presume?” He looked from Sherlock to John.
“Hmm.”
Just then, they heard a loud thud and a breaking noise from the landing. Sherlock looked at John in alarm and, having tucked himself in already, jumped for the door. He narrowly avoided the casserole dish sitting on the landing, which turned out not to have been the source of the sound. He then took in the sight of a startled Mrs Hudson covering her mouth as she shrank back from the large broken flowerpot on the floor. “Oh dear,” was all she managed.
When at last John steadily pushed in, Sherlock let out a deep groan of satisfaction.
A few minutes later, as soon as Sherlock reappeared, John asked him, “Who else have you told?”
John felt like a complete arse.
Suddenly, there was a girl with bright red hair standing in the doorway, about twelve years old.
The woman whose job it was to know what people liked (and who was pretty damn good at her job).
What time of year was it, even? He couldn’t remember.
Initially, he’d only planned to get admitted to Smith’s hospital and to then try and entice Smith into trying to kill him, so he could catch him in the act and get him arrested. But when he’d been presented with the opportunity to pickpocket him and ‘borrow’ his phone, so that he could solve Faith’s case a little more directly – and with considerably less fuss – he had grabbed that chance with both hands.
Sherlock nodded. Yes, he’d travelled there by plane. (On the false passport Mycroft had provided.)
well. His now-lover was sitting not twenty yards away from him and Sherlock could feel his soothing presence.
Both of them came three times that day.
“I’m sure she was. Well, I’d better leave you to it, then.” She smiled sympathetically and made towards the door.
Sherlock breathed deeply when she left.
Like an eagle, he looked at every detail, memorising anything that might turn out to be suspicious later on.
As the nerves continued to slowly fall away from him in little waves, he became aware of John leaning against the doorframe, watching him. His relief was visible not just on his face, but in his entire appearance. He suddenly looked several years younger.
“Yeah,” Greg huffed, “I bet you probably do get your share of misunderstandings with
When he finally snapped back into reality, he suddenly recalled the case and what needed to be done.
Then it was time for the Ophelias.
“Nice. It’s very touching how you can hijack the machinery of the state to look after your own family.”
He could, of course, make something up again, like he’d done before, just after Mary (Rosamund) had died, just for the sake of letting people believe everything was business as usual. And to keep up the visitor rates on his blog.
They all froze, eyes wide.
The monitor next to him beeped reassuringly at regular intervals.
“Interesting, isn’t it?” Sherlock said. “I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to every available data stream in the world simultaneously, it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything.” He sniffed and looked down, pondering how impressive it was, in a way, that his mind had autonomously put together the information he must have distilled from various sources into one plausible but fake context.
To John’s shock, Sherlock agrees with a simple “alright” and the unbuckling of his belt – not taking his eyes off John.
Meanwhile, John was rather busy getting a Christmas tree into the house as well, then putting it up – and persuading Sherlock to help him decorate it – and buying toys for Chloe to put under it on Christmas Eve.
“God, yes,” John said.
Sherlock’s gaze slowly turned to the wooden panel opposite the bed.
A smile played around John’s lips at the prospect of an old-fashioned evening with his best friend in front of the fire. Although there was always, of course, also the frustrating and almost sickening feeling of longing in his stomach whenever he was near Sherlock. Longing for what, exactly, he still wasn’t willing to admit to himself. Neither had he figured out how to deal with those silly feelings. They were ridiculous and completely futile. But always there, nevertheless. Over the years, he kept thinking he’d buried them deep down safely, out of reach, only to be reminded time and again that they had a habit of flaring up at the least convenient moments.
“I... er... had been planning to.”
He should have known she wouldn’t just go along with his request without having questions.
“Can it wait, Sally? I’m about to set out for Sherlock’s to show him some pictures of the scene. According to his text, he’s ‘too busy’ to come here himself. Your lucky day, apparently.” He managed a comic fake-smile. “Not bloody mine, anyway,” he couldn’t help adding in a grumble. He took a deep breath to compose himself. “Hell, if he spots
Mycroft raised his head and looked down his nose at John, but then turned his gaze towards the door, as Mrs Hudson barged into the room. “Where is Sherlock? How is he?” she asked, clearly as concerned as they were.
Sherlock frowned. The tea was only lukewarm. Apparently, it had been sitting in front of him for quite a while. “Hm. Why a seven?”
“Nothing to worry about, you’re just a healthy young man.”
familiar way – and hears the desperation they invoke in his soft moans, and feels the wavering of his legs as they struggle to support him, for sheer bliss, John can only wonder how they never did this before. Sherlock is desperate for John’s touch. And John is more than willing to give him what he wants. He marvels at how Sherlock is even more beautiful like this, as he feels himself fall incredibly more in love with him.
John considered for a minute. “Horrifying as that sounds, you might very well be right,” he eventually said, still absorbed in thought about the matter. “Might very well be.” He squinted at another group of similar cottages, which had taken a desolate tinge after Sherlock’s observation, and tried to imagine the hidden wickedness which might go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.
… John…”
* * * * *
When his shirt was open, Sherlock didn’t take it off just yet, but started unzipping his trousers first. Once his fly was undone, clearly exposing the lace of his knickers, John must have sensed some of Sherlock’s anticipation in his breathing, because he suddenly looked up. Then his eyes widened and his eyebrows rose high on his forehead. Sherlock let his trousers pool at his ankles and shrugged off his shirt, revealing his bra, before gracefully diving into the bed next to John, smirking.
Luckily, there was still time for a proper shower and the removal of his neck tattoo and false missing tooth, which required almost as much time and attention as it did to apply them.
Living with mouth-moving people not nice. But paintings there. And cats. Important.
Sherlock nodded and John got up to put the kettle on. Nothing like a good cuppa to have a break and help organise your thoughts. While John was busy, Sherlock sauntered over to the kitchen table behind him, which was covered with papers and pictures related to the case. In a corner, John had noticed a neat pile with the stuff relating to the sadly unsolved Abergavenny case that Sherlock had taken down from the wall. Archive material.
Considering what to do with it, and looking around to see where it might have come from, she briefly glanced through the bedroom door, down the hallway, and saw John sitting stiffly on the sofa, clutching his daughter, and following Hannah’s every move.
“Don’t worry about it, Mrs Hudson,” John said as he appeared from behind Sherlock, apparently having quickly finished erasing all the evidence of their previous activities.
“Why?”
(See the end of the chapter for
John chuckled.
“Oh dear. That’s what you get for not watching your child, isn’t it? But with some luck, the child will come to the dog rather than the other way round. Look at his cute face!” And she squished the dog’s head between both hands.
“And the younger maid, then?” Sherlock ventured. “With the curly hair? Seemed a right snob to me when I met her the other day. Much like the older lady you just described.”
But she couldn’t be her, right?
. You don’t build a beach if you want to hide a pebble; you just find a beach!”
Is this what Sherrinford had imagined the reason was why he’d not seen Sherlock all these years? Because it only made sense for Sherlock to have been abroad? Studying bugs, like he’d done as a child?
. “Secret door.” Not his imagination, after all. Not being able to tell the difference anymore was starting to get really annoying. But it would stop happening very soon.
Sherlock got up and looked on as Lestrade charged her with the murder of therapist Elsa Robins, manslaughter of Hannah’s look-a-like neighbour, as well as with inflicting grievous bodily harm on John Watson.
He was, however, not really surprised that Sherlock had known where he was, as he had practically told him, himself. But he needed to keep up the act of not having been in touch.
She stood waiting beside him, smiling.
“Yes, yes. It’s a good thing I don’t have anything to do with that. I just make pretty things with the stuff, is all. But you do hear things now and then, of course. Lots of politics.”
Sherrinford’s blue skipping rope. His almost-murder weapon.
The prices had gone up since last time. Not that that was his major concern, at the moment.
Donovan’s voice brought Sherlock back to the present. “So what happened tonight, at the Aquarium?”
“Serbia,” he’d simply replied in a faint whisper, as he awkwardly leaned on one elbow for the nurse to take his other arm out of one sleeve. And then, apparently, reading John’s next question from the silence in the air, “Three days. Then Mycroft found it necessary to wade in and rescue me.” He spoke slowly, flinching every so often as the nurse eased him out of his gown. “Just when I’d managed to snatch the key to the lock on my chains from my captor.” He vaguely smirked, although that could have just been the morphine, before another painful grimace contorted his face.
, Greg.” John paused deliberately to take a steadying breath. “
John stilled and swallowed.
had Sherlock thought this idea, of all people’s ludicrous suggestions that Sherlock usually didn’t even come
When they came back into the lounge, all dressed again, Hannah had an outrageously proud, knowing grin on her face.
After he’d managed to turn the last one off, he remembered.
“Our former neighbour, Mrs Tubbs, recommended this place, and I must say it’s quite lovely indeed,” Mummy said, stirring her tea cheerily. “Surely you remember her?”
“We’ll just take it slow, yeah?”
Chloe was absolutely miserable and kept whinging whenever she was awake.
Sherlock realised he was stuttering a little, as he thanked her for everything. And John was decidedly more quiet than he usually was, and merely stood there nodding a lot.
She remembered how she had loved the visits from her own aunt, Vivian, who had always done fun things with her and John and had shown her that not everybody saw the world in the same way her parents did. Who had bought them Mivvi ice lollies in the park, because she didn’t think they were a waste of money.
Simultaneously, they rushed for the door, and the world slowly pulled back into focus again.
* * * * *
Sherlock spent the next few minutes struggling with the many layers of sticky tape. Bit by bit, he tore pieces off of it, picking away at the clump and making it gradually smaller.
“I love you,” John said once again, his voice strange and raw this time. “And the whole world will know. I will be your husband and you will be mine.” He looked at Sherlock, dead serious now, emotion filling behind his eyes. “Promise me we won’t ever let anything drive us apart ever again. Promise me we’ll stay together forever.”
The man stumbled back, as Sherlock triumphantly smashed the Thatcher bust onto the floor.
“Come on, let’s scoot over to the middle of the bed,” John whispered. Which was a good idea, seeing as their legs were uncomfortably dangling off the edge.
Whereas I had originally intended the story to have the length of an episode of the show, you could say it now has become an entire (alternate) series. :D
Since takeaway food reminded him of his days with Sherlock, it occurred to him he might as well go over to Baker Street and see if his old flatmate was in so they could eat together. Or he could eat in his company, at least, if Sherlock was in one of his fasting spells.
(No one would ever believe that they remained friends after she shot Sherlock, except, well, Mary herself, ironically.)
Shame be damned.
“Of course,” John chuckled, shaking his head elaborately. Then he looked at Sherlock questioningly.
“Well, he couldn’t have given you this one. It’s...”
Sherlock snickered.
But he also couldn’t bear abandoning Sherlock.
“You’re going to have to be more specific, Craig,” Sherlock had said.
It was just that she feared she might have neglected to do something, or say something, before the chance was gone for good.
Sherlock ended up sprawled on top of John, and then paused.
“Does he want to find out what she would spend the money on so he can cash in, one way or the other?” Sherlock went on. “Then why would he be following her at 7.30 am when she’s on her way to work? She’s not likely to give any hints as to her hidden expensive taste at that time of day.”
they’d successfully pulled off this whole charade now, he would never know for sure that they truly
John was zipping down his fly before he even thought about what he was doing – half his brain possibly even fooled by the fact that he’d been planning to undress to try his outfit on anyway, although truthfully that plan had little to do with his actions right now. Sherlock’s mouth formed a cheeky, noiseless ‘oh’ that made John abandon all decorum and he grabbed Sherlock’s hips to press his cock (still with his pants on) against Sherlock’s gold-clad arse. The bastard then found it necessary to softly let out a high-pitched ‘mmm’ that sent shivers down John’s spine. He was really asking for it, John decided. They’d never done it in this position before, used as they were to the comfort of their bed, and occasionally the sofa, but as needs must, John pulled his pants down and then reached underneath the dress for Sherlock’s. But his lover grabbed his wrists before he’d gotten hold of his underwear.
“I’m so sorry I wasn’t more supportive of you back then,” John said, as if reading her thoughts. He swallowed and ducked his chin. “I was always so afraid for you, scared that your being so open about your orientation would get you into trouble. That someone might harm you. But now I understand why you didn’t want to hide. Why you wanted to actively make the world a better place for LGBT people.”
Sherlock held two fingers to John’s carotid artery to check his pulse, which was regular. The only blood Sherlock could see were some tiny, microscopic droplets coming out of a small, red spot on his forehead, where his skin was slightly damaged.
“Good,” Smith said. He continued rolling up his sleeves. “Say that for me. Say it.”
“Paintings?” he asked. “Cats?”
. There was clearly no point in even thinking about that. The Work was all that mattered to Sherlock, after all. The fact that he’d become more comfortable touching John and being physically close, like when they sat on the sofa together, leaning against one another, didn’t have to mean anything.
Janine was right, he realised.
“You can also exhibit your paintings at an art gallery without selling them,” he clarified. “Then you get them back afterwards. Maybe you would prefer that?”
“So... what have you been getting up to?” John said, sitting down rather awkwardly next to Sherlock on the sofa.
them.”
Thanks to providence, he’d had the guy back at gunpoint within about twenty seconds, because the moron had managed to stumble over the very pipe he himself had thrown in their way to thwart their pursuit only minutes earlier.
God, would the idiots never stop associating him with that stupid deerstalker? He didn’t stalk deer, that much should have been clear by now.
Well, it didn’t matter now. Smith wouldn’t ever use TD12 again in order to confess his sins.
“Da! Da!” she yelled gleefully.
Sherlock got up and was all weary, reassuring smiles. “Yes, honestly. Just a glass of water perhaps, if you would be so kind,” he timidly said to the goldsmith.
Sherlock sat beside the bed, both hands gripping the arms of his chair. His heart rate was definitely not as calm as John’s.
When Sherlock was done, he gestured for John to sit between his legs again.
“Oh, sorry! I haven’t even introduced myself. You know half my life but not my name,” she giggled, suddenly looking five years younger. “It’s Violet Smith.”
Dammit, why hadn’t he spent his time on more pressing matters?
Using this note as an entry ticket, however, could prove an ideal way to find his weaknesses, so that she could target him in the exact spot she needed to, and would know precisely which way to twist the metaphorical knife for maximum effect.
John sat at his bed, just as he had for days on end last autumn. Except that now, Sherlock looked scruffy, dirty and unshaven, and he had a large bulge on his head and a swollen lip from where he’d hit the floor in the morgue.
John cleared his throat while he tried to regain his neutral face. “Now?”
They were still standing almost as far apart as was physically possible while holding each other’s hands.
Before mid-afternoon, Sherlock was unrecognisable even to himself. When he looked in the mirror, it was as if a strange woman had intruded into his bedroom.
? I think she should be the next one to know, although she might very well have guessed already, of course.”
It was clear to him now, that he’d simply been too narrow-sighted to see the damage done by miscommunication back when meagre two-way monologues had still been the only way he knew. Now that he’d successfully begun to repair that damage between him and John, by listening, and by
It was an incredible coincidence that fate had given her this opportunity for this act of mockery.
They had let her, buying themselves time to come up with a plan.
As they drank their tea, Sherlock asked how she was and she gave some vague, socially acceptable answer that he forgot the same instant.
“Ah, I see. You devious creature. Here I thought for a second you were being nice.”
“Need another hit, do you?” John asked.
To distract himself from the fear of John somehow finding out about the device, he started rummaging through the mess that was his desk in an attempt to clear away the clutter. He needed to tidy up his stuff as much as he needed to get his life back in order. Preferably with John still in it.
Soon, nurses rushed in.
, which had decidedly not been pretty, and that was just nicotine withdrawal.) But he just had to be there for him. He owed him that much.
“Well, making something up shouldn’t be too hard,” Mary sneered, in his head. “You’ve always had such a
When he was done scribbling something down, he handed Sherlock the receipt and sighed. “Today’s youth,” he mumbled. “I can’t remember things always being this complicated when I was young.”
Suddenly he wasn’t sure.
“Oh! Where to? Can I come?”
, Mrs Hudson. Please stay where you are!”
“Yes, we used to do it twice a day for the first couple of weeks. That’s also normal, love.” John was smiling at him fondly now, and rubbed his thumb gently over Sherlock’s hand.
When he wiped his fake persona off his face, he seemed to wipe away a layer of stress, as well as a bunch of frustrating memories from the recent past.
When they were seated inside the car, John tried to fish for information once more. “So... what are we doing here? What’s the point?” he asked, hoping to get an actual answer this time.
Sherlock had explained that Rosie had been staying at Sherlock’s parents’ house, with a female MI5 agent looking after her who was also an old friend of Sherlock’s. (At the time, John had wondered whether ‘old friend’ might mean ‘ex-lover’, but now he was glad to know it didn’t.)
“Yes?”
“Sherlock. Sherlock!”
Towards the end of the afternoon, when they were lazily lying on the sofa, limbs intertwined, John furtively crawled down and hooked his fingers in the waistband of Sherlock’s pyjama trousers again. Sherlock became hard within seconds, catching his breath when he felt John’s fingers on his bare hips, pulling down his pants. Without further ado, John took Sherlock’s cock into his mouth and, using his already expanding array of creative tongue techniques, soon made him come, grunting and screaming as dazzling fireworks went off in his head once more.
As John put his arm around him, still dazzled at what had just happened, he was suddenly overcome by a fierce feeling of protectiveness, and he held Sherlock with the same reverence and tenderness he would a rare butterfly, unable to take his eyes off him.
For those now trying to remember what those hints in the show were again, exactly, here's a recap:
, without learning it somewhere first?
In an instant, John dropped the fire extinguisher and stormed towards Smith, as Lestrade and Hopkins came into the room after him.
What gave people an enormous positivity boost are the incredibly realistic and very in character "Contact"
(NSFW!).
It was from the clerk to the court’s office from where Eurus Moriarty had been tried.
She was dressed like an overly fashionable 17 year old boy and had matching short hair. Convenient for use with wigs, Sherlock thought.
If looks could kill, Sherlock would have been stone dead that instant.
He was not going to push him away or scare him off again, not if he could help it. If he was honest with himself (which he was now starting to be), he’d been wanting to hold John like this for years; and finally there was no reason anymore why he shouldn’t. Until now, John had been the only one with the guts to take the initiative, so now it was his turn.
Nobody had mentioned another, brown rope playing any part in this.
, you woke up. John, please, please say something.” He sounded distressed. “Do you… do you know where you are?”
From the corner of his eye he saw Sherlock enter the shop a minute later. John moved a little closer to the open door so that he would be able to hear the conversation inside.
It was a consolation at least that a quarter of Rosie’s genes came from his mum. His wonderful, incredibly strong mum, who’d always been there for him, until the day she died – much too early. If only Dad hadn’t been so excessively drunk on that particular day, when there’d been so much dirty laundry from the school trip that she’d had to keep climbing up and down the stairs to hang it all to dry. It had all been a matter of chance, really. As was true for any accident, he supposed.
“Naturally. So all we know is the location of one of her safehouses. Most likely one of many. It might be weeks before she returns. Long after Lestrade withdraws the stakeout, probably.” Sherlock sighed.
Sherlock hurried over to the kitchen to hold the paper up to the bright lamp suspended over the table, looking for clues he might have missed earlier.
John looked at Sherlock with a blank expression, not quite getting the point of this exercise.
The next few days passed similarly, as they looked for the The Lost Special Pearl in several villages, spending one or two days in each, before deciding to travel further north each time.
how Jim knew so much about Sherlock from the beginning, knew what his weak spots were. And
They were standing close together now, their foreheads touching.
The silence, however, only lasted a few minutes.
Sherlock’s mind briefly stagnated at his brother’s obvious, intense sorrow. ‘
“Alright then.” Sherlock cleared his throat. “As you’ve now gathered, Mycroft and I have another brother. His name is Sherrinford. He's two years older than I am, five years younger than Mycroft. He’s always been… difficult. He’s deaf, to begin with.” Sherlock stirred his tea.
?” He’d never expected Sherlock to be amenable to so mundane a concept, and was amused at how his lover kept surprising him.
Sherrinford’s innocence was something he and Sherlock had both been vaguely suspecting for a while, which had been why Sherlock had gone back there to begin with. A shock, certainly, but not entirely unanticipated.
This was all rather amusing.
of January, meaning that in a few hours, the house would be flooded with people for his birthday.
, managing to make Sherlock promise him all sorts of things, which maddeningly accelerated the proceedings of said activities for both parties immensely. Although John, of course, still tried to draw it out as much as possible, most of the time, as was his M.O..
Painting almost finished.
Sherlock could breathe again.
,” Sherlock said, intently, his eyes wide. He looked… scared.
So with Steve’s help, she had made sure that Jim’s face had been all over the country, on all screens simultaneously – with an ominous ring to it, as had been his trademark.
Sherlock let out a resigned sigh and lowered his mug again. “Actually, she’s not. I saved her from being decapitated in Karachi. Took the place of the executioner and told her to run.” He nodded, thinking about how much detail he should include.
John raised his eyebrows.
The girl thought hard at this, then remembered. “Yes, actually. Once he got into a conversation that sounded like an argument, with another guy on the street. I quickly walked on, glad to have lost him.”
to him?
If John had ever even felt like that in the first place.
Molly wondered if this exchange was all code as well.
“Ahh, glad to hear it.” A genuine compliment still made Angelo’s heart skip a beat, even after all his years in the business. Especially when it came from valued customers like these two. “Would you like anything else?” he asked, mostly out of habit, since he doubted that there could be much room left in their stomachs, especially after all the wine. “You know what: I’ll give you a coffee, on the house. Espresso?”
The idea behind the text-flirting had been to lure John away from Rose, with the advantageous side-effect of annoying the shit out of Rose, once she would find out, of course. And Sherlock Holmes would probably not be amused, either – not even being second but third best – which was excellent.
“Oh, that’s very nice of you. I will tell him,” John replied, puzzled.
Suddenly, John involuntarily pictured Mary in the crowd, sitting behind the children. Saintly beaming at him, as if she wasn’t a ruthless murderer. “He should be wearing the hat,” her ghost said, smiling her deceptive, radiant, coy smile. “The kids would love the hat.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock had been working round the clock trying to figure out what AJ had meant when he’d mentioned ‘the Goddess of Tbilisi’. It had taken him days until he’d found a tiny newspaper article in an online archive that mentioned a uniquely intact ancient goddess figurine from the late Bronze Age, dug up at an archaeological site in Tbilisi back in the eighties, which for some reason had been in the possession of the British Ambassador to Georgia. It disappeared six years ago, during a hostage situation at the Embassy. The article, however, was very vague as to the specifics of the incident.
to love, miraculously.
By then, he’d already known that Mary was Moran and that she’d done a decent job running Moriarty’s empire after his death. While on the side, of course, accomplishing one of Jim’s most important missions of burning the heart out of Sherlock – by seducing John. So her being who she was, was a perfectly good reason why she could very well have been behind the uncanny mystery with the broken busts also.
“I was peckish, but we had no cereal or bread,” John said, his voice practically back to normal. “But we did still have some flour and also some dry yeast, which you probably purchased at one point for some sort of foul experiment I’m not sure I want to know about.” He threw Sherlock a fond look. “Anyway, I actually mixed too much for one loaf, so I’m making another one with raisins that we still turned out to have as well.” He beamed at Sherlock as he rested his hands on the ball of dough.
John couldn’t help but wrinkle his nose in a suppressed giggle, and as Sherlock not so subtly spread his legs much wider than was necessary to straddle him and started shamelessly dragging his arse crack over John’s now newly rousing prick, John reckoned he could postpone falling asleep for another hour.
“Hmm. We should get dressed.”
It took a second for it to click in John’s brain.
* * * * *
“Elizabeth, what happened in Tbilisi in 2009?”
“You wouldn’t be able to watch it for more than three seconds,” John was quick to add.
Meanwhile, his cock had become so hard under John’s mouth that it ached and Sherlock was starting to become rather desperate himself. An unfamiliar sensation, and he was not sure whether it was in fact unpleasant or not.
John squeezed his eyes shut. All he wanted right then was to hold Sherlock in his arms until forever, and keep him in a protective bubble so that nobody could harm him ever again. As he rested his forehead against Sherlock’s temple, John could feel his eyes burning and soon hot tears were spilling down his face. He softly stroked Sherlock’s back in a repetitive, comforting rhythm, as the new information gradually settled in his mind.
* * * * *
He grinned in spite of himself.
Wine colour on brush. Why?? Arm in mid-air. No, not on canvas. No blood in picture.
If they didn’t find the blasted Pearl during their holiday, they had at least found a much better name for their daughter, John thought.
* * * * *
The only movements were those of John’s chest still subtly heaving from exertion and Sherlock’s eyelids blinking rather stupidly indeed – and making him look even less like the genius Greg had come here to see.
He wanted to yell it, sing it.
Sherlock leaned against the side of a cupboard, hands in his coat pocket, watching with interest. This man had some impressively simple but effective intimidation techniques.
And it worked.
Then it hit him. Lunch with Mummy. She was in town for some crafting event.

“What?”
But had she, really?
The recording.
Sherlock could tell that the headaches were getting worse again, as John tilted his head backwards, closed his eyes and scrunched up his face, sitting very still.
them.
Maybe they should get out more, do fun things together that weren’t case-related occasionally. He made a mental note to act upon this intention.
“Yes!” Sherlock nodded. “Bring.”
Great. Jimmy Savile’s murderous cousin. Sherlock wasn’t sure who was more evil.
“Wait, what?” Eurus had exclaimed. “Does he know your true identity?! How can you still be safe here??”
“Did you, now?” Sherlock smiled back.
But still, one might rightfully wonder whether it was actually a good idea to move back in at this point. Wouldn’t it be wiser to first watch from a safe distance where this was going? For instance, John had literally no idea what sex with Sherlock was going to be like. He wasn’t even entirely sure what he wanted in that respect. Or whether Sherlock wanted sex at all. He’d always seemed a bit funny about the subject.
Sherlock shrugged and casually strolled over to a quiet corner near the stables, away from the stable’s entrance and out of the line of sight of the builders. There, he sat down and took out the borrowed handkerchief, carefully folding it open. It didn’t contain anything, nor did it look like it recently had. It looked at least three decades old, and cherished – although it could have done with a wash. Sherlock produced his phone, took a picture of the cloth and a close-up of the neatly embroidered coat of arms, before hiding it back in his sleeve. He then ambled back onto the lawn, exaggeratedly studying the trees above him and looking up at the house. When he caught sight of James from the periphery of his vision, he made sure to inconspicuously get near enough to him for his next move. Sherlock stooped, pulling the handkerchief from his right sleeve with two fingers of his right hand and pretending to have just picked it up from the floor, as he called, “Hey! You lost something!”
“I’m truly very sorry having to tell you this,” he started, trying to look John in the eye as he spoke. But for some reason he didn’t succeed and found himself staring at the buttons of John’s coat instead – only barely managing to stop himself from compulsively counting them (he knew perfectly well there were eight, including two at each cuff).
(30 May)
Little brother came. Hardly recognisable. Big now. Still alive, then.
Smith stopped and looked at him. “Saheed, isn’t it?”
“Hmm, in that case, I think I need just a little more data,” Sherlock replied, “on my
A second later, he wished he had.

,’ Irene’s voice echoed from the past.
But moreover, ever since their teenage years, she felt that he’d never really accepted her being gay. There had been endless discussions about why it was really necessary that she was actively volunteering with the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. She thought it was important to press for law reforms and try to influence the provision of medical, psychiatric and social services, back in the early nineties. Her brother John, however, had seemed to think it was all just a load of nonsense and that she should stop wasting her time and start doing something that mattered. Like study medicine.
John was taken by surprise, but a very pleasant surprise at that. He loved it when Sherlock took the initiative and the fact that he was now doing it in public sent butterflies fluttering all over his insides. It made him want to devour Sherlock on the spot.
“For God's sake, Janine, stop gaping and close the bloody door. Go and make yourself some hot milk.”
Sherlock patiently sat there with him.
“So, er, Johnny, want to tell me what that is all about?” Harry asked, nudging her head towards the remaining armed agent.
John let out an audible breath and briefly closed his eyes, as a pained expression passed over his face.
“Can’t complain,” the man replied with a smile.
And he’d said he loved him.
.” Blinking against his own tears, he continued to hold his sobbing best friend for a long time.
keeping me awake at night. Sometimes.”
Irene?
John closed his eyes, trying to think of what ulterior motive Sherlock might have to be so interested and helpful right now.
(John still wasn’t sure about the nature of Sherlock’s own sex life, or absence thereof. Not that it mattered
The door opened and a police officer entered. “Sir. You probably want to see this,” she said, putting an open laptop onto the desk.
“Christ,” John said, stunned. “If she hadn’t been there…” He swallowed, then shook his head. His grip on Sherlock’s hand tightened a little. “So you haven’t seen your brother in, what, 34 years?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He leaned back and drank his coffee, thinking about the next step.
“But in spite of everything, I feel you and I unfortunately can no longer be friends.”
“Oh, sorry. You were sleeping already,” Sherlock said quietly, upon John’s suddenly jerking awake.
Sherlock quietly cringed at the thought.
No one in the world knew her pain.
When he felt Sherlock’s grip on his hands loosen, John held him tighter, with the little force his muscles could muster, making sure Sherlock stayed exactly where he was – like a lifeline – while John drifted off again.
Sherrinford’s face lit up. “Yes! Excellent!”
Lots of new revelations, both factual and physical. Also, trains aren’t running as they should.
Mycroft held his gaze. “No,” he spoke firmly.
Suddenly, he heard a belt open and a fly being unzipped, making Sherlock’s face fall into a satisfied smile.
This was definitely not good.
“Sherlock?”
After staring into nothingness for a bit more, he eventually picked up the unfinished crossword on the coffee table and decided he might as well try to complete it now. Not a very spectacular way of spending his last evening before going back to work, but his life wasn’t that spectacular anymore in the first place. And maybe that was just as well.
“Which was undoubtedly a good start of getting back into the habit,” John smiled. “But we need to think this through. No rash decisions.”
“Someone might
Sherlock’s heart started to beat faster, euphoria creeping in: an even stronger feeling than he’d had just now upon finding the lost pearl. He thought back to their first week in Norway. John had still needed to sit down quite often during their expeditions. But not the last couple of days. They had walked for more than an hour on end, sometimes.
Sherlock couldn’t help a smile. “Well, that too, although that might be slightly inappropriate tonight. We’re going out.”
Also, after six weeks of detox, he should be able to do without, really. Even though John’d had a more gradual weaning schedule in mind.
“Please John,
Sherlock wasn’t sure how to respond.
“No, I do! I do,” John assured him, almost tearing his dress as he took it off in one swift movement. He wasn’t very well going to do it looking like
, he was going to say. But John provided the last bit by pressing an actual kiss to his mouth, standing right next to the body they’d been examining.
At this realisation, there on the streets of Gloucester, he felt another surge of love for the man who had so successfully tried to make most people believe he was nothing but a calculating egotist. But John decided he’d better save any sort of expression of his affection for later, as they had just arrived at their lunch venue.
. The man had just been off his head on coke. Simple as that. John chastised himself for trying to explain away his actions.
(21 May)
“Sherlock,” he called, as his lover stepped into the hallway.
“John.”
“Surprised? Yes, so was I.”
Sherlock held up his hands as he continued forward. “Okay. Fully equipped ambulance; Molly can examine me on the way. It’ll save time. Ready to go, Molly?”
There was another long silence, during which Sherlock wondered why his brother was still there. He had his gaze fixed vacantly on John, appearing lost in thought.
Sherlock needed to get hurt. Needed to make sure he ended up in one of the hospital beds in this very building.
Greg grinned, unzipping his coat as he started for the stairs. He had long since gotten used to the unconventional methods of his consulting detective. Just then, he heard John calling “Sherlock!” in a rather desperate tone of voice, as if Sherlock were up to something awful again, which would be no surprise.
“No,” Sherlock simply said, blankly. “I didn’t feel like I needed them anymore. Nor did I take anything else, in case you were worried.” Sherlock underlined his words with an intent frown in John’s direction.
John drags himself up the stairs as if the task is a specific punishment for his cockup: with great effort but very little enthusiasm. It’s not as if there’s any kind of reward at the top. He needs to get off, for God’s sake, not spend another evening locked inside, with his crazy flatmate huddled over a microscope or some other unspeakable experiment. (Or torturing his violin. Or shooting holes in the wall.)
“I stopped lying down.”
the closest he would ever be to him, even now that Mary was gone.
“He always forgets to charge his phone,” Craig said, on the verge of tears. “I keep trying to call him, and the police have been trying to track his mobile signal, but he’s had it switched off all this time. I hate it when he does that. It’s because he forgets to plug it in.”
Sherlock had been so taken aback by this incredible piece of egocentrism that he’d failed to prevent AJ from snatching up the Pearl from among the debris.
The child looked at Harry with big, bright eyes. “Da!” she exclaimed enthusiastically.
“Why would I?” he frowned. “
Sherlock was holding his hand.
Outside the therapist’s house, the door of the red sports car opened to reveal none other than Mrs Hudson. Turning to John, she sighed deeply and walked over to him. “Oh, John...”
John was strictly speaking only there to observe and to provide backup if things should escalate, but this was too good an opportunity to ignore. “Oh! Yes, I heard! He… she died, right? A member of your club?” John said sympathetically. “Awful business, just awful.”
And that’s how they both fell asleep.
(no, not just Sherlock’s,
Two pairs of surprised eyes had looked up at him from the carpet.
before.
“Of course alone.”
With everything he did, he could feel a direct response on his own cock. When he planted soft kisses, John would tenderly run his tongue alongside his shaft. When Sherlock dragged his nose over the sensitive underside of John’s bum, he was rewarded with increased suction and some beautiful moans coming from deep within John’s throat.
“Thank you! I got it from Ally, you know…” Charlotte’s face fell into a sad smile, from which seconds later, only the sadness remained.
He hurried up to his room to grab the walking cane, then fetched some fresh PJs, underpants and a toothbrush from Sherlock’s room and travelled straight back to Saint Caedwalla's Hospital as fast as he could.
on the scene. And by the time Sherlock had been well enough to go back and find any specific traces that could be used as evidence against Mary, Magnussen’s penthouse had of course long been cleared.) And he most certainly hadn't wanted to rely on Magnussen's witness statement, as that nasty piece of work would likely have had no problem lying under oath in order to retain the bargaining value of that piece of information, so that he could blackmail Mary even further.
“Fine,” Sherlock snapped, and strode over to the hallway, where the lift was located. After stepping inside, he punched the button for the top floor.
Sherlock… He felt anger welling inside him, competing with the intense grief that had already settled in his throat.
Molly and Greg were seemingly practising their parenting skills – sitting on the floor next to the fairy-tale castle Hannah’s daughter Imogen had built together with Chloe in front of the hearth, and undergoing an imaginary adventure that was taking place there – as Hannah and her wife Briony were happily chatting away with Harry and Natalya, who’d flown over especially for the occasion.
for one another,” Greg beamed. “He’s always happy when he’s with you, even though he doesn’t necessarily show it, as such,” he conceded. “But without you, he’s a total, insufferable prick. That’s true love, innit?”
, the question mark had no meaning to his brother. He then pointed his pencil at the empty space left and right of the dog, and looked at Sherrinford expectantly.
John was sure he was in heaven: to see Sherlock beneath him, limp with abandon and preciously smiling with his eyes shut, his legs resting on John’s back, as John’s cock slowly sank into that beautiful, lean body. John was practically gasping for air. And when Sherlock briefly opened his eyes and looked up at him as if John were the only thing that would ever matter to him in the world, John thought he might cry for joy. The intimacy of it all was mind-blowing.
Sherlock was quiet, his gaze drifting along the trees in the distance, as if digging up old memories.
The next hour passed with the two of them being treated to the club’s rendition of Lady Gaga’s ‘Poker Face’ and Sherlock quietly deducing the crap out of everyone in the room from their plastic chairs in the audience. He ended up with a couple of clues that needed following up on, for which he gladly used the coffee and tea break.
“Er, yes please,” Harry heard herself say.
“Good, good. Listen, can you help me move him? I mean, we can’t let him lie in the middle of the doorway like that, can we?” The man looked slightly baffled.
exactly.
There seemed to be fear and hope in Sherrinford’s eyes. He was blinking rapidly. And when John looked again, he saw the beginning of tears.
Sherlock absently chewed his biscuit as he allowed the scene to roll out in his mind once more. This case was almost as important as the Moriarty one, after all, even though it might not be as urgent. He figured he might as well allow his mind to wander a little, especially seeing as he wasn’t getting anywhere with the other one at the moment anyway.
Sherlock snorted, deciding to ignore the remark.
Was the dog really for him to keep, though? Maybe the present was that he was allowed to just hold a puppy for a while?
Sherlock closed his eyes, a slight frown on his forehead as he gritted his teeth in mild frustration.
The realisation hit him hard as a truck. He was ready. Was he, seriously?? The expected panic following this thought never came. The fear and awkwardness at the idea of being penetrated suddenly
John’s heart had skipped a beat at the sight of the uneven, bobbly stripes on Sherlock’s back.
“How did you get in touch with them in the first place? What kind of group was it?”
Just like himself, she had segmental heterochromia iridum in one of her eyes. Difficult to fake with contacts.
At that very moment, a car loudly crashed into a rubbish bin on the street right in front of the house, sending it flying over the kerb.
A few minutes ago, a member of the medical team had removed John's breathing tube, because she estimated he could now breathe on his own. Which he indeed seemed to be doing fine.
(The possibility of them both sulking simultaneously crosses his mind, but John quickly pushes that rather horrific idea aside.)
Sherlock blinked, trying to think.
He lifted his shoulder blades from the mattress to reach between his spread thighs and grab John’s bottom, desperately digging his fingers into the wonderfully firm yet soft flesh, to pull John even closer to him. He ardently longed for John to hit the magic spot and wanted to come under his spell once more, to let his restless mind crash down all the way from the cold mountain tops where it too often resided. He could feel it hovering over him already, like an invisible veil that would trap him soon. He threw his head back, letting the delightful feeling of John moving inside him wash out all other things.
Champagne glasses were already set out on the coffee table, the bottle in a cooler next to it.
His landlady was in the process of baking a cake as he entered her kitchen. She was just pouring some honey onto a table spoon above the bowl with batter. “Oh
Sherlock watched him through Lestrade’s office window until he disappeared out of sight.
“You’re not her. You’re not the woman who came to Baker Street.”
All he needed to do now was to come up with the right time and place to propose.
John was biting his lip in delight. His rhythm was gradually picking up speed and little sweat beads appeared on his biceps.
Only half awake, John trudged up the stairs to get her out of bed.
John opened his eyes a crack. It was night. But he could clearly see Sherlock’s face hovering in the darkness, illuminated by his phone. He was probably on a case. Solving mysteries. Saving people.
Sherlock briefly wrinkled his nose in a smile. “But I said I didn’t mind if you came, even if the house was already full of armed people walking around. The more, the merrier, I always say!”
As he stood on the pavement in front of number 221 and routinely checked his surroundings before reaching for his key, he realised there was no need anymore. No more reason to double-check his every move, to scrutinise every person around him in the street.
Or should he just get up and leave early? John didn’t think he was going to continue coming here, anyway, after all. Politeness, however (and plain inertia, perhaps?), made him stay where he was.
in fact the fanciest hotel in the city, of course, established 1897. “You just wanted to make sure we didn’t leave on tomorrow’s flight without properly wrapping up the case with Interpol.” He sighed, throwing John a look. “Rather transparent, don’t you think? We’ll consider it, though. Good evening.”
“Seems like a plan. Any excuse for some fresh air, really,” John had replied, getting up from the desk full of papers.
“Good.”
‘LE IPOTESI SULLA SPECIALE PERDUTA CONTINUANO’

The idea of Sherlock and Irene together still made him feel sick to the bone with jealousy. But Sherlock had said they were just ‘friends’, right? It was just texting.
Sherrinford started rummaging among his other works and produced a rather stunning painting of Niagara Falls. The spray of the water was beautifully captured, showing subtle rainbow diffractions from the sun’s rays. When his brother pointed one finger from Sherlock to the painting, making Sherlock realise it was another question –
“You need to lure her with something that she wants,” Hannah said one morning. “Something not related to you two. Or me. Maybe make a list of her interests besides, you know, threatening and harming people.”
There was something.
Whether John was being an appreciative listener to his being particularly brilliant or not, Sherlock just wanted John
It had felt extremely liberating, somehow.
But since more Hamlets had turned up than expected, the Ophelias were now due to start twenty minutes later than originally planned.
Arthur smiled at them from a sunny holiday picture on the side table, taken on the shore of a lake, presumably in Italy, judging by the colour of the sand and the height of the mountains in the distance. Just as in the description that the earl had given them, a woman that was presumably his mother was very aptly only partly visible in the background, with her back turned towards Arthur and the photographer. As Sherlock contemplated the level of coincidence in this piece of photographic symbolism, he became aware of a soft noise made by John shifting uncomfortably in his chair. Then he cleared his throat.
“Yes, well. Thankfully, I’m good and well out of the pit I crawled into,” Sherlock said, casting down his eyes. “Thanks in part to your good care, preventing me from relapsing in the first month.” A faint smile touched his lips as he looked at her, before setting his jaw. “And that Moriarty woman is lucky that John woke up well and sound – even though it did take a few months to recover properly – or she would herself no longer have been
They’d agreed that she would stay inside as much as possible, never far from Rosie.
John did sense that Sherlock was slightly uneasy about not being there for Sherrinford during the holidays, despite his own, rightful argument that he simply couldn’t accompany him everywhere all the time, and it was only healthy for Sherrinford to get used to having to fend for himself a little whenever he was outside the safe confines of the care facility. Even though he would of course largely be unable to communicate. (Mycroft had been very vague as to whether he’d started learning BSL yet. The twat.) But then of course, that was the way it had been for years.
- - You boys having a good time? :)
“It must be Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock said faintly, feeling slightly embarrassed. He showed John the Twitter account, the sole purpose of which seemed to be to point out when Sherlock was being arrogant, misogynist or otherwise offensive. Just like he’d asked their landlady to do.
When he walked up the driveway of Holdernesse Hall the next morning, wearing his suit again (slightly sweaty from the clammy train journey), Sherlock casually greeted the workmen that he’d interacted so elaborately with the previous day when he’d been in disguise. Of course, none of them suspected he was the same man. Meanwhile, Sherlock’s eyes scanned the grounds and anything that moved on them. There seemed to be one builder less than before. After a simple process of elimination, Sherlock realised that the one that had been coughing so loudly was nowhere to be seen. The older maid crossed his path and nodded curtly. The door was opened again by Amy, who, once more, appeared to avoid eye contact at all costs, and who silently disappeared the minute she’d shown him to the earl’s study.
Corridor by corridor and floor by floor they searched the derelict building, slowly but surely closing in on the source of the GPS signal.
John eventually ended up wearing a leather jacket, cowboy boots and a wig with long, greasy black hair.
“Oh, he’s… well, just
John was becoming rather desperate for some stimulation himself, but this was not about him; so he resolved to simply put his own needs on hold for now.
I should tell him, John thought.
So while they had now eliminated one crucial link in Moriarty’s web, in the form of Mary – though in a rather dramatically different way than they’d envisioned – there remained at least one suspect to be reckoned with, Sherlock was sure. And it wasn’t AJ.
When they eventually reached the last Ophelia on the photocopied list in front of him – Number Eight – and a tiny girl with big glasses entered, Sherlock softly cursed to himself.
“John, I… want you… inside me,” Sherlock stammered, between kisses.
A few moments later, John came into the bedroom, took one look at Sherlock, and pulled him close. “Hey,” he said, concern audible in his voice.
On the one hand, he loved the tranquillity – to
John frowned. “Bliss?”
“Yes! Very kind, thank you!” Sherlock added, thankful for John’s direction. He needed the man on so many levels.
They were still fully dressed – well, save for John’s open fly and hastily pushed down pants – and had been about to head for bed, toothbrushes abandoned on the edge of the sink.
While living and working with Sherlock was certainly never boring, being in a relationship with him was even less so. Although their lives continued to revolve mainly around Sherlock’s

“I don’t have very long with you, so I just need you to tell me what you can see outside the plane.”

Sherlock played over the supposed events in his head.
So they continued.
Sherlock needed surprisingly few strokes before his semen spurted against John’s chest. John had seen him come quite a number of times by now, but nothing like this before. The intensity with which he knitted his brows together, wrinkling his forehead and grunting out John’s name, sent a beautiful chill down John’s spine. (Making John awkwardly slip out of him in the process.)
been thinking the same thing after all, because he all but launched himself at John.
Then Sherlock stopped moving.
It had all seemed so simple.
“No, the other one. Sherrinford. He’s deaf,” Sherlock clarified.
He sounded as if he were merely playfully trying to avoid using the word ‘masturbating’.
It was almost as if he could feel himself turning into a new person, with an entirely new context. Like an old painting revealing new details when displayed in a different light. Or with layers of old grime removed.
Then there was only his own heavy breathing and nothing else.
He tried to imagine John sitting behind him in his chair near the fireplace, reading a newspaper. Even though the silence was the same – save for an occasional turning of a page Sherlock had to add in his imagination – ,  there was a huge difference in John actually being there or not, as irrational as it seemed. Just as Sherlock hadn’t really needed him to accompany him to the goldsmith that afternoon, but everything was just so much more...
Everything was perfect.
,” John said, with a playful angry look in her direction.
Also, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my amazing betas once again: 88thparallel, mydogwatson, camillo1978 and Jonathan, you are truly indispensable in the creation of this fic! :)
Instead, he just whispered “See you tomorrow.”
John started to move to a sitting position so he could arrange the blanket properly, but halfway through his movement, he was reminded why he was in a bed in the first place. Even after this small shift in position, his head felt like it might explode and he fell back onto his pillow with a frustrated moan.
Harry turned the corner onto Great George Street and straightened her jacket.
John was afraid of hurting him. Wonderful, wonderful John. Everything was going to be alright.
“Exactly, yeah,” John said, now showing a noticeable spark of enthusiasm himself. “It’s all about consequences, isn’t it. That’s one of the great challenges in writing fiction, I think. To figure out how certain events make people feel, how they are affected by them in the long term.” He nodded, pressing his lips together. “It’s somehow always easier to see such things more clearly when it’s about someone else, weirdly, even if they’re fictional.” He looked pensive for a moment. “Someway, it still manages to teach you something about yourself and your own life.”
, I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just… it sounds tough.” John went to sit across from Sherlock, next to the fireplace, and put a hand on his knee.
Sherlock tried to focus on continuing to take regular, deep breaths as he thought about this specific subject, but he already felt the beginnings of panic rise from deep within. He’d managed to avoid  really thinking about it until now, but it was hitting him doubly hard now that he couldn’t hide anymore from the fact that this was real; John had not pulled back in the morning. And it was quite obvious that he had expectations.
‘Did you know Culverton Smith is a serial killer? #crime #hidinginplainsight #thosearethemostinterestingones’
Suddenly, Sherlock was silenced by lips pressed to his mouth. John was kissing him again, just like before: tender, slow and full of…
He reclined on the goose-down pillows as John quickly leaned over to one side of the bed to find the lube tucked into the front pocket of his weekend bag. Boy, was he glad he’d put it there, with such easy access.
“No, I’ve never been there.” She looked puzzled. “Never known anyone who has, either, until Bob and Jack, that is. Well, except one uncle, who moved there when I was little, but he’s hardly been in touch since my dad died. But all I’m asking of you, really, is to just find out who my stalker is. A name is all I need. Well, and preferably some photographic proof. I was told you were good at shadowing people yourself.”
“You really think so?” Mycroft asked, surprised.
After the fireworks in his head had slowly fizzled out, he just dazedly stood there, leaning back against the wall, panting and feeling utterly sated, as the miracle that was Sherlock gently nuzzled his hairline.
In response, Sherlock teasingly licked the ridge of his auricle, before whispering, “Tell me what it is you want, John.”
with you,” Sherlock breathed. “I want you… inside of me.”
“Oh, I’m, er, fine! I’ve just got some, well, potentially bad news, although I’m not really sure. Um. I just thought I should talk to you about it.”

-- Lovely British weather, eh? ;) J
There. That should teach her to shut up inside of his head.
“How long have you been working here now?” Smith asked, casually.
While they were at it, they’d given her a new middle name as well.
One of the things was that Sherlock seemed to have no shame. John had always known that, of course, but it had acquired a whole new dimension with the changed nature of their relationship. Sherlock would simply drop to his knees in front of John in the middle of the kitchen or living room and unfasten John’s trousers, regardless of whether the curtains were open or closed. Thank god the flat wasn’t on the ground floor.
This entire situation was starting to get rather ridiculous.
“I need to use the least likely disguise,” Sherlock said, through gritted teeth. “One she can’t possibly see through. None of my things are actually good enough for that purpose. I have no idea what to wear. A whole wardrobe full of stuff and nothing suitable.”
(A slight feeling of embarrassment crept into the corners of his mind as he realised he and Mycroft were basically still acting like children, playing the ‘yes means no’ game.)
