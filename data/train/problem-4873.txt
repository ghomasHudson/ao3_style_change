Before Tony could make it to the doorway of the kitchen, he suddenly realized there was more than one person in the lobby. Rather, at least half a dozen sets of feet were padding quietly into the mansion through the front door.
Steve couldn’t even count the number of strange looks they got; two government-looking agents walking down the street, lead by a cat and followed by four more, all of which were in perfect formation and step? Not very common. Steve was focused on using every sense he could to pick up a trace of Tony. It was almost after two hours of searching that he got anything.
Tony wasn’t as ravenously hungry as before, and wasn’t looking at the sparrows with a mad gleam in his eye, so he took some time to sit down and think over his options. He was hiding out in an alley a block away from the mansion- just in case Animal Control was monitoring the street and being a little more vigilant than before. The cement was cool on his legs, but the fur of his body kept him perfectly warm, which was a small blessing so late in September. Hopefully he could get back into the Avengers’ good graces before the first frost.
“Climb in!” Tony said, jumping into the chest cavity and laying on his back, head stuck into the helmet space. The rest of the group was extremely skeptical, but they all managed to fit. Clint and Natasha had decided to jam themselves into the legs, while Bruce, Steve, and Thor took the chest, jamming Tony’s shoulders closer to his head.
“You mean you saw more spiders?” Clint asked, face slightly pinched. Tony shook his head against the carpet.
“You don’t know Tony Stark very well, do you?” Pepper said, her voice suddenly hard as flint. The whole team paused and looked at her in confusion. “God, did you even bother? You have no idea how to read him, at all. The only time he drops is when he’s been binge working, and even then, as soon as he’s awake, he’s back at it again. This is something else. What happened?” She asked, and Natasha was the first to speak up, looking doubtful.
“I’m going to go order some pizza.” Clint said- despite it being breakfast time- and pulled out his phone, disappearing into the other room. They all knew the order by heart: three meat lovers pizzas for Steve, an onion-mushroom-ham for Clint and Natasha to share, a pepperoni-bacon for Bruce, and Tony hoped that Clint got four extras of whatever in case Thor came back and wanted something. If Tony had been human he would have added a supreme with extra pepperoni, but as it was he’d probably just be getting another bowl of the raw stuff Bruce put together. It wasn’t as good as pizza but Tony wouldn’t be complaining.
“I think Coyote has something, so we’re heading back in.” There was a pause as they reached the first building and they stepped through that barrier. “No, I don’t know. Stand by.” Clint whispered, and then it was truly silent. Their footsteps shuffled and echoed down the narrow streets and Tony felt once again like he was being watched. He could sense Clint’s uneasiness behind him and they picked up the pace a bit.
“Brother! We have come to ask that you return us to our normal forms!” Thor called, pulling ahead of the group as they turned the corner. Loki was curled up in a small black ball of fur on the other side of the cell.
“I would be mad that you went in against orders, but if you hadn’t, Natasha wouldn’t still be here.” Steve started, and Tony just let himself be carried through the streets and back to the quinjet.
They got ice cream, sat down on a bench, and enjoyed the early morning breeze. It was strange to Tony, to just sit with a friend because they had time and they wanted to. With Pepper it had either been dating or working, and Rhodey had so little leave that he rarely saw Tony, since he usually visited his family when he could. It was a companionable silence and Tony found himself wishing that it happened more often.
What he didn’t expect was to wake up at around three in the morning to someone getting pans out of the cupboards.
The door clicked open and one of the nurses leaned in, flipping on the lights. Tony let out a breath and she smiled, coming up to him and checking on his heart monitor.
Anyway. Secondly, he still hasn’t taken a bath since Afghanistan, and he would probably have a panic attack before the lathering could even begin, so it honestly wouldn’t be worth it. He’d rather stand on the mat until it melted off.
“Hush now, snookums. I haven’t got more than a scratch.” Tony insisted, opening his mouth to say something dramatic about being heroically saved when gloved hands suddenly wrapped around his middle and jerked him up, unceremoniously stuffing him into a carrier and shoving Steve in right behind him.
“Stark is Coyote. Finley! I thought you said you had two agents responding? Stark isn’t an agent!” Clint said, and the agent- Finley- scoffed.
words. Peter worried at the hem of his shirt and shuffled his feet as he waited, movements increasing in anxiety until he looked like he was sweating.
“May?” Tony meowed, rubbing against her shoulder and trying to rouse her. Her forehead creased for a moment before she squinted her eyes open. “May! You have to come with us, SHIELD can get you to the hospital.” He insisted, knowing she couldn’t understand him, but trying to nudge her to her feet anyways.
Tony let out an agitated hiss and lashed his tail, trying to think of a way they could get to Queens quickly and without the help of Coulson.
“Clint and I will stay with her.” Natasha called, and Tony lifted his tail gratefully. The rest of them trotted back to the house and started poking around carefully. There were signs of Peter, but nothing recent. He’d obviously been at the house sometime in the morning, but every scent was stale enough that there was no way he’d come this way after noon.
Tony put all his eggs into the half-cocked basket that was his plan, and leapt with all he was worth. He pushed off from the fence, then off from the oak, and right over the top and out. He barked in delight, getting out of range of the poles as the catchers tried to get him through the bars. He was a free dog!
“Stark, no! Get out of there!” Steve grabbed Tony by his ‘required’ collar and dragged him back, snatching the fries and putting them on a higher shelf that Tony couldn’t reach.
Tony found out soon enough when Steve grabbed him and plopped him right on an examination table. Tony scoffed. He’d been betrayed. How could Steve do this? Cap was throwing him to the wolves!
“What’s going on? I didn’t know Tony had cats… Pepper’s allergic.” He stepped carefully past them, and began to race up the stairs that led to the roof. They all felt a bit put-out as they watched his heels disappear up the steps.
The second batch of cookies was almost done when Steve entered the kitchen, throwing up his arms when he was accosted by a half-dozen marbles.
“Well, alright. You’re free to go. There should be a quinjet waiting on the airstrip to escort you back to New York.” He said, leaving the room with a dramatic swish of his cape. Tony gave one last sympathetic look to the agent before he hopped off his chair and left, making his way to the lobby and then up to the hanger where the quinjets lived.
Steve hopped down off the table once Tony was finished, and they waited while JARVIS put the scans together with the code.
I know this could be seen as ship-y (omitting the fact that tony isn't a human right now, so don't worry- i'm not a fan of any human-animal romance/etc) if squinted at, so i just wanted to mention that it isn't meant that way- its just platonic. The team find that their guard is lower around Tony in his dog form, and Clint is having a rough time. Also he just really loves dogs, but can we blame him? 'Cause same.
Tony rolled his head to look at Clint. He was staring off at the far wall with a scowl on his face, though he wasn’t fidgeting with his bow like usual. Tony figured it wasn’t a good sign and he made a growl-bark noise, nudging Clint’s hand with his nose.
No way. He’s been suspended and it’ll be too dangerous, he hasn’t even trained in his new body yet-”
Tony was so tired of being a dog, and he’d resigned himself in that department. But being Iron Man was one of the things in his life that he wouldn’t give up- not over his dead body.
didn’t seem to care. He was almost vibrating with frustration, hands fisted and jaw set. Steve tailed Tony through the whole house all the way into the basement, right down to the doors of the workshop.
Plus, Loki wasn’t wrong. Tony was pretty powerless as a dog, and there was only one option left to him.
“Coyote- one bark for yes, two for no. Is Widow there with you?” Finley asked, and Tony gave a single bark. Clint sucked in a sharp breath but the agent talked over him.
“Would you want to come on my run with me? We’ve been keeping you all cooped up in here, might be nice to stretch your legs while one of us can keep an eye on you.” Steve was leaning back against the counter and Tony all but leapt up, tail wagging in delight. Steve wanted to
Tony jumped forwards and tore the other cat from Loki’s back, flinging it into the leg of one of the tables.
“Nothing happened. He’s just being an ass, like usual. Nat, could you put him somewhere out of the way while we clean up his mess?” Natasha turned with a nod and took Tony down the hallway.
“JARVIS, make a note: 10:46 a.m. on a Sunday, which in the Stark household is deemed ‘catch-up day’, I voluntarily am eating and drinking something that is
“I was about to say the exact same thing. These are obviously Hammer tech too.” Natasha continued, smiling ever so slightly. At that she turned and rifled through a duffel bag at her feet. Steve continued explaining their mission log to Fury, but the talking cut off when Natasha tossed a severed robot-head onto the table, where it clattered to a halt right in front of Tony. He looked at her and cocked his head, but she only raised an eyebrow in return, as if saying,
None of it was helping, so he barked. And barked, and barked, and made so much noise that it echoed around the room and made his head hurt. Tony barked himself hoarse and nobody came back.
“I’m sorry, guys, but we aren’t getting anywhere. We need to go back to the tower and come up with a new plan; Tony is resourceful, and I’m sure he’ll be fine until we find him.” There was a great amount of grumbling and huffing, but they all turned around, and started the trek home.
“I think his leg is broken. It was a German Shepherd, so I’m not surprised there was so much damage. They have the strongest jaws-” Clint cut himself off when Natasha gave him a
I'm soooo sorry for taking so long to continue this. I've tried really hard not to be one of those writers, but alas, it happened. Either way, I saw a post about viewer engagement on Tumblr and it made me remember how encouraging you guys are, no matter how critical I am of my own work. Just reading through your comments made me so happy and inspired again that I'm determined to keep going! So consider me back on the wagon, and I'm going to do my best to upload semi-regularly. I'll be gone for a week in late June but that should be the only hiccup, if it even causes one. But anyways, I'm done rambling, enjoy the chapter!
“Everything seems to be running fine, vitals are okay.” Hannah said, hanging the clipboard on the end of the bed. “Just press this button if you need help.” She tapped the ‘call nurse’ button and they all filed out, leaving Tony with Bruce, Steve, and Clint.
“Widow, Hawkeye, there’s been an attack in Queens. We don’t have time for you to go all the way back to the mansion, so suit up with your spare gear and meet us here instead.” Steve’s voice sounded over the loudspeaker of the jet, and Clint and Natasha rushed to change as the jet did a 180 degree turn and headed back to the site of the battle. They could already see smoke rising above the buildings and the pilots packed on some speed.
“I wonder what’s gotten into him.” She muttered, distracted as the oven timer reminded her not to burn her cookies.
The helmet was pulled off his head and Tony could finally breathe. He choked out all the water in his lungs and gasped, turning onto his side and breathing through the burning in his chest and the constricted feeling of
“Well, in our current state? I don’t think we could avenge much more than a teensy mouse-massacre. Not exactly the most qualified group of enhanced individuals fighting on both U.S. and sovereign soil to protect humanity. Hence,
“So you’re saying that you’re Tony?” Bruce sounded surprised, then he frowned. “Prove it. What’s the name of our secret boyband? What happened to you and Rhodey in the summer of ‘93? What blend of coffee is your favorite? Which Kardashian do you think is ridiculous?” Bruce asked, and Tony went right back at it, paw swiping across the paper as fast as he could legibly write.
Tony pulled himself up and sluggishly went back to the holo-keyboard Jarvis had helpfully enlarged for Tony’s paws, and yawned as he picked up where he had left off.
“You wish for me to follow you? I must admit, never have I been acquainted with so intelligent a Midgardian animal as you.” Thor said, humoring Tony as he was led to a small patch of dirt at the end of the drive.
All of this was written really late at night, so please let me know if you see some typos or grammatical errors!
Tony thought, padding out of the kitchen and heading to the foyer. He came back a minute or so later to see Steve waiting with a bemused expression on his face that turned into a smile when he saw what Tony had brought.
Tony looked over at the truck and his suspicions were confirmed; it said Animal Control on the back, and it had cages set into the sides. There was another person rummaging through a hatch and getting out cases. He too had a noose-thing.
“Well, then by all means, let us go speak with the man. He would be delighted to know of a dog such as yourself.” Thor started back up the driveway and Tony trotted behind, trying and failing to keep his tail from wagging. Progress!
“That’s the dog!” Steve called, pointing at Tony and taking a step forward. The catchers were faster; they both darted forwards with their noose poles and Tony’s heart leapt into his throat as he took off at a sprint, eyes darting around the yard for an escape route. He looked to the left and saw that one of the catchers had rounded the house and was trying to cut him off.
“God, you guys are always so lovey-dovey after not seeing each other for like ten hours.” Clint sighed, and Steve shot him a glare potent enough to make the cat shut his jaw with a click.
Peter was very obviously reeling from the news that the six cats laying on the counter in front of him were previously an elite team of crime-fighting superheroes, but Coulson tended to gloss over things like that, and he was already moving on. “Now i’m sure you’re wondering where you factor into this. You know too much about this to go gossiping with friends- which I trust you won’t do- so you might as well have an… insider role, if you will.” Everyone was looking at each other with a bit of apprehension, since Coulson hadn’t brought this up with them beforehand.
They left the bedroom without Tony needing to set foot in the bathroom. The rest of the day consisted mostly of Tony sleeping out of the way in Bruce’s lab, and occasionally handing him equipment he needed in exchange for head scratches. He even got fed a few bites of Bruce’s takeout when the team settled in the living room to watch a movie.
Tony snarled and clamped his jaws down on the majority of Loki’s face, teeth sinking into the god’s cheek bones.
“Um, well, Nat-” Steve tried, but Fury raised his hand palm-up and gave them all a ‘what the fuck?’ sort of look.
“Heartbeat is fine… No arc reactor?” He felt the fur around Loki’s chest, and when he didn’t find anything, he looked at the cats in confusion. “Is this Tony?” They all shook their heads no, and he seemed to perk up a little at that. Steve knew that Phil wasn’t very expressive when he was on the job, so the small shift screamed ‘relief’ to the people who knew how to read him. Phil set the cat down again and stood up. “The only other person up there was Loki. I’m guessing that’s him?” They all nodded, and he whipped out his cell phone.
don’t do anything stupid, Tones. Please. We’ll be back as soon as we can.” With that Bruce took off, jogging for the elevators.
Tony was trying to smell past the thick layer of smoke in his throat and he caught something. The scent of blood was both hopeful and foreboding; someone was there, but he had no idea if he’d be too late.
? Like sardines?” Clint scoffed, ears flat back as he watched Tony jump up onto the terminal and start to type. A few short commands lowered the suit to ground level, and JARVIS maneuvered it to rest on its back.
“You hit the coffee table? It must’ve been pretty hard, what were you doing?” Steve asked, inspecting the ground around the table. Tony huffed in annoyance- how was he supposed to explain without words?
“Alright, alright. Maybe next time, if Tony allows. So what was going on today? Do we have specs on those robots?” He diverted, looking right at Tony, as if there wasn’t someone in the room who probably shouldn’t be in the know about their current predicament.
“Where’s Tony? I don’t see the suit anywhere.” Thor trailed after Steve, his tail dragging along the ground.
Loki, trying to get us to attack Tony. How are we supposed to know you’re telling the truth?” All eyes turned on Tony, and he pushed the roll with his foot to get more paper, smearing the last of the paint glob onto his paw and trying to use as few words possible.
“Peter, what is it? You still have all of them, right? God, please tell me you at least still have Tony, he’s the hardest to keep in one place once he realizes he’s actively being kept there-” Tony cut Coulson off with an offended huff, and gave him a piece of his mind while Peter tried to snatch the phone back, and Pepper switched from pissed off to slightly freaked out.
Tony put his stick in a spot he would be able to find it later, and kept quiet as he rounded the house and peered into the front yard. Steve was standing at the front door with a woman, and she was holding a noose-pole. Tony had no idea what the name for it was, but it made his fur stand on end- a sensation not unlike goosebumps- because he’d seen them used plenty of times before.
“You’re not half bad, you know? Considering. You have a pretty decent temperament. Should I even try to return you to your people? I refuse to send you back somewhere they…” He trailed off, picking up the cat as he flopped down on the bed, before settling Tony on his chest. He seemed to be getting himself back together after he had dried his face and changed topics. “I thought I was done with this animal-enhancement bullshit, you know. It was bad enough when I got mixed up in it. At least I could do something about it after I got my-” He shot a furtive glance at his closet door, and Tony perked up. What kinds of secrets was he hiding in there?
“Lay him there, please. Nurse Harley to room fifty-eight.” They all glanced at her in confusion but she had her fingers against her ear so Tony assumed she had a comm in. Steve situated him in a small nest of blankets and Tony sighed; he liked Steve’s warmth but he was tired of being carried around and he wanted to sleep.
“You have been working for fourteen hours, Sir.” JARVIS sounded a little irritated, so Tony decided to appease him and take a break. He skipped a few paces until he jumped onto his rolling chair, which travelled to the kitchenette with his momentum. Tony ended up within arm’s reach of the fridge and he peered in to find leftover Thai-Fusion from the last time he ordered in. It was only a few days old so he chucked it in the microwave and plugged in the blender, which excited Dummy so much that he nudged Tony’s chair out of the way so he could make the smoothie himself.
Tony did his best not to worry, but thoughts crept into his head without consent, and he was starting to get antsy.
Tony trotted over to a tree and found an appealing stick, flopping down on his side next to the trunk so he could gnaw out his anger and think, which were two of the very few options he had left. He needed to convince them that he was at least more than a normal dog. They wouldn’t believe that he was Tony, but maybe they would take him in if they thought he was a meta-dog of some sort? What the hell was he supposed to do, spell out ‘I’m not a dog’ in the dirt?
They all entered the lab to see ‘Tony’ typing on the main computer, all the bots in their charging stations and powered off. They must have manually been shut down, which Tony knew they hated, and it made him want to go for Loki’s throat. He kept himself in check and stood next to Thor while Clint got Loki’s attention.
“What’s going on? Did they get Aunt May?” Tony asked, peeking past Bruce’s shoulder to look. There were several black SUV’s parked precariously in the rubble up what used to be the street. Some agents were leading May into a car and likely back to a nearby medical tent, while Agent was bent down next to the Iron Man armor and talking to the spy twins.
“Hey, kid, what the hell? I mean, yea, I would be upset too, but really. That was practically a tantrum.” He climbed up onto the jean-clad legs, and curled up as best he could in the awkward criss-cross space he had. The kid huffed out a laugh.
Steve said, the whirring of engines heard both through the speakers and distantly above the house where the jet sat on the roof helipad.
“We were pretty close to the mansion- touching down now.” Natasha announced, everyone grabbing a hand bar to keep steady through the jolt.
“You put your entire team in actual danger today. When you’re a group of superhuman crime fighters, you’re allowed a little leeway when it comes to reasonable risk. This? Completely unreasonable, and completely unnecessary.” Natasha and Bruce made protesting noises, but were hushed by a scathing glare.
“You’ve been going at that awhile. How much coding are you going to have to do?” Steve asked, lazily stroking his tongue down a leg.
“Thor, I’m-” Tony choked and started to hack, inhaling more water through his mouth as he gasped for breath. “I’m in the water! I’m-” The water was too high in Tony’s helmet for him to talk, and he forced himself to breathe through his nose despite his lungs screaming for more air.
why you two thought it was an amazing idea to drag the entire team- the off-duty team, if I remember correctly- down into a clusterfuck of this magnitude, just to go looking for one person. A person SHIELD has tabs on, by the way. A person who is completely fine and actually being rounded up as we speak. Can you explain this to me?” Coulson hissed, a sour smile twisting his lips. His eyes, on the other hand, contrasted nicely by quietly screaming ‘murder’. All of them were taken aback by his anger.
His first goal was getting back to the mansion. He had to tell his teammates what had happened, capture Loki, and get himself transformed back to normal. Easy.
It was a quiet car ride. The only sounds were from the radio playing softly in the front and Natasha’s knives making
It was peaceful, and Tony felt a small bubble of content blossom in his chest. The team felt more like home than the mansion itself ever had- and likely ever would.
“Brother, we’re just here to help. We need you to explain your situation to us before we can do that.” Thor rumbled, as calm as ever. Loki’s ears flicked and he sighed rather dramatically.
of a workable situation. If he’d still had his damn collar, he could have explained the best way to handle the problem- but instead, he would be locked up inside and forbidden from getting involved.
“What are we going to do about him?” They all looked at each other again, and then Natasha’s ears flicked.
“Just now, friend Banner.” Thor beamed, and Bruce blinked owlishly a few times before he turned and shuffled into the kitchen without a word. The rest of them paused for a second before they realized what they had been talking about before.
The barista instantly recognized him when he walked through the door, but it wasn’t just because he was Tony Stark. Before he’d moved himself and all the Avengers into the mansion, he was living at Stark Tower, and he came here almost every day.
“Well this sucks.” Tony grumbled, remaining on the cool metal ground and turning himself over to face Steve. “Are you okay?” He asked, listening to the rest of the group walk away as he checked Steve from nose to tail for scratches. There was a small one on his chest and before Steve could protest, Tony rolled him onto his back and planted himself firmly on top so he could clean it.
“I already said I’m not helping you.” Tony realized he was gripping his- thankfully empty- plastic coffee cup so hard that it was a crumpled mess, so he relaxed his hand and took a deep breath.
“The kibble must taste horrible, look at him go.” Clint looked back to the hand Natasha had laid down and swore, throwing his cards onto the pile and crossing his arms as he pouted. Natasha gave a raspy chuckle and scooped up the candy bars they were playing for.
With renewed hope Tony picked up his pace. Four streets away, then three. As he came upon the second to last crossroad, something heavy knocked him away from his goal, driving the breath right out of his lungs. He couldn’t see the group of Shield agents any longer, but he prayed they were hurrying to help. Tony could hardly move as his chest spasmed and he stared into the barrel of the robot’s wrist-mounted MP-5.
“I don’t know, I just came to get him for our run, and he had the rag on his neck. He must have taken care of it himself, and I’m worried about where the collar went. I didn’t know he’d be able to get it off by himself, or that he’d even want to. A cut like this looks like it cut right through unless he took it off beforehand.” Steve fretted, patting down the dog bed and moving blankets in an effort to uncover it. Tony put his paw over one of Steve’s hands, mind racing on a way to de-escalate this before Loki thought he’d tattled, or the team cottoned onto the likelihood of foul play.
“Are you alright, Tony? Are you hurt anywhere?” Bruce was crouched in front of him and had a hand between his shoulder blades, rocking the armor back and forth from the force of his concerned rubbing. Tony flopped himself back into a sitting position and groaned.
That threw them all for a loop. They’d thought of this as a little test-run, to get a better feel for the guy. Fury would definitely scare him off if he tried to force him into joining.
across the street, but he felt more uncomfortable without keeping an eye on the tesseract, so he reluctantly turned and slowly circled it, trying to keep his back against whatever meager cover he saw.
“I guess I don’t realize it, but I’m always doing something. I’m training, or painting, or reading history books and using the internet. I haven’t just sat down to breathe in a while.” Steve stared out at the cars passing by, and Tony stopped to think about that. He’d seen Steve as much as he’d seen the others the past two weeks, but he hadn’t actually seen Steve sit down much, besides for movie nights. The guy also seemed tense and wary the rest of the time which for the life of him Tony couldn’t guess why. If the others even realized how vulnerable they were without JARVIS they hadn’t let on, so it couldn’t be their safety. What else would Steve be anxious about?
“It was mostly the same as the last one, except for the company I had this time.” Tony said, wiping his snowy paws on the mat before trotting beside her as she returned to the living room. She made an inquisitive humming noise and Clint glanced up from the floor where he was picking at his nails. The T.V. had Mario Kart paused on it, with a first-place toad and a princess peach frozen mid-air, two green shells arcing away from her character. Clint and Natasha weren’t afraid to fight dirty.
“You’re so dumb, don’t ever do that again or I’m going to have a heart attack, jesus christ-” Tony babbled, settling himself on Peter’s shoulder and purring like a motorboat.
Tony hadn’t gone on a drive just for fun in a long time, and he was enjoying the late September wind through his damp hair. It felt nice to just do something for
“How are we going to tell him it’s us? Nothing like this has happened before, it’s not like he has a protocol for it. Morse code, maybe?” Natasha wondered aloud, and they sat in contemplative silence for a few beats until Thor suddenly jumped to his feet.
phone? I literally have people that I employ for this specific purpose.” They all heaved a collective sigh, and Steve nosed the side of his face.
. Just above the ceiling tiles, came a humming sound overlaid by telltale ticking. He had no idea how Loki managed to acquire (read: steal) a device that was retro enough to actually tick,
“Hello? Tony?” She called, sticking her head out of the kitchen doorway and frowning when she spotted the whole team gathered in the entrance to her apartment. “What is it?”
The building gave an ominous rumble and Tony barked, inching his way towards the door. They needed to
“I’m alright, I’m fine. Thanks, Thor.” The whole team was gathered in a circle around Tony at this point. Thor nodded solemnly at him, resting mjolnir on his shoulder as he surveyed the damage to the streets behind them. Clint moved his quiver to his hip and slung his bow over his back so he could get out his SHIELD-issued phone and call Coulson, while Natasha investigated a dead grasshopper and Steve stood rigidly in parade rest. He was almost vibrating from what seemed to be anger, if his Disapproving Frown was anything to go by.
Tony wanted to shout, but he settled for harsh barking. He stepped a few paces back from the agents, which forced the kid to fall over onto his behind, and allowed Tony to block him more effectively.
“Well, now we can’t have that.” Loki’s hand shot out and he grabbed a fistful of Tony’s hair, his other hand resting on Tony’s forehead. He whispered a harsh-sounding chant in an unfamiliar tongue, and Tony had a moment to enjoy a sensation similar to being slammed into a brick wall right before his consciousness was ripped away.
Unfortunately, the universe did not have proper rest in store for him. As soon as Tony reached the main level, he was startled by chunks of brick flying through one of the large windows lining the hall.
“That was fun. I’m going to crawl under something and sleep until we forget that it happened.” Tony said, but Steve made a sad humming noise and stepped forward.
Tony pushed that to the back of his mind and put his nose to the grindstone for so long that he lost track of time, until his stomach was growing painfully and he really needed to pee. He was only maybe an hour away from finishing the SHIELD assignment though; that was a plus.
Tony had naively expected everything to be all hunky-dory when he finally got all of the Avengers living in the same building (which had taken a lot of persuasion, money, and grovelling to accomplish), but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Everyone was awkward around each other, and most of them were the type of person who would rather have a fist-to-face than a heart-to-heart; which meant that everyone was easily set off, and little squabbles broke out over even small things, such as picking a channel or deciding who got the last of the leftover chicken wings. The entire mansion started to give off a perpetually irritated vibe in itself- unless that was just them projecting their feelings. Though perhaps not- JARVIS was just as short as the rest of them the longer it went on.
taller than Tony remembered. Of course, Tony was on all fours now- but either way it was levels more intimidating than before.
The rhythmic stroking and purring calmed Tony’s racing pulse, and his brain finally clicked back into ‘work’ mode.
Tony lured them all the way to the docks, hovering over the water while almost half the grasshoppers slipped over the retaining wall before they could stop. The remaining bugs chattered angrily and a few even jumped at Tony in a vain attempt to avenge their drowned brethren. At least, that would probably be their motivation if they were sentient, but they likely just wanted to eat Tony’s gauntlets off.
The first snow of the year had fallen while Tony was gone, and the next time Steve and him went running, it wasn’t quite as pleasant as it usually was. Tony ended up with snow clumped to the fur on his belly, between his toes, and all the way up his legs. Steve just laughed at him and Tony grumbled as they finished their lap and came in through the front door, pausing to get themselves as snow-free as possible. Unfortunately, the snow was matted in Tony’s fur, and he stood there uncomfortably as Steve kicked off his own sopping wet shoes.
If Tony Stark was anything, it was an achiever. And he was determined to stay on the team; whatever it took.
“Alright, you can stop. Steve, if you could set him back down up here-” She said, putting her stethoscope in her ears and listening to Tony’s chest once he was laid down on the table again. The frown was back on her face and she opened Tony’s mouth again, then used a penlight to look in his nose.
Tony survived the yelling and even slept on the flight back to the states. None of them had asked for his report, but once he got back to headquarters, Fury would surely force him to sit down and tell the whole story.
“I’m fine, just tired.” Tony said, closing his eye again as Steve nodded and slipped back into the conversations with the others.
A young voice screeched, and Tony whipped around in time to see one of the metal suits hurtling downward towards him. With his last moment of time, Tony closed his eyes and thought to himself,
Tony had barely finished his food when Peter’s chair suddenly screeched against the tiled floor. They both hissed and looked over at him in time to see him vanish into the hallway, footsteps echoing for a few moments before it was quiet again. Pepper looked after him with an incredulous frown on her face.
Thanks for sticking around! Please feel free to leave a like or a kudos if you enjoyed it, seeing a positive reaction really helps me build up the confidence to keep going!
“Hey! Clint, knock it off!” He shouted, grabbing an empty cookie pan and using it as a shield as he ducked behind the island. “I’m not here for whatever you’re cooking. Fury is on his way.” That stopped the pelting and Clint groaned, draping his front half dramatically down the doors of the fridge.
At this point the others were almost vibrating with restraint, looking back and forth between Loki and Tony. They couldn’t attack without putting their teammate in danger.
Tony pushed Natasha into the corner and she shouted in surprised pain, landing on her back as chunks of brick rained around them and huge plaster sheets from the ceiling made them a small cocoon, Tony barely managing to support it with his back as he stood over Natasha. It was several minutes of uncertainty before the building stopped falling and they were left in an eerie, pitch-black silence. Natasha let her head thump down against the concrete floor and before Tony could blink she was out again. His legs were straining with the weight on his back but it wasn’t as much as the beam had been; he supposed it was mostly venting and insulation. Though there could be tons of weight above and any shift could bring it down and crush them.
Tony looked over at a potted plant next to the front door, and he was so angry, he wanted to destroy it and leave them something else to pick up. He’d learned his lesson after Natasha, though, so he instead made his way over to the gym, and started to run off his anger on the track.
“I can’t say for certain what happened, but he got her from the north-west corner of the third floor to the stairwell of the second, so they were close to getting out when the building came down. Took us two hours to find them. He was holding up at least two hundred pounds of plaster and debris the entire time, keeping Nat from being crushed.” Steve finished. Hannah nodded with a concentrated expression on her face as she felt Tony’s legs up and down and rotated his ankles.
“Sugarpie, you are the light of my life. I owe you a favor, or a massage-” Tony bunted Steve when he jumped back onto the counter, and they took a second to rub faces before Clint gave a loud cough. Steve dropped the phone by Tony’s feet and laid down, tail still stubbornly wrapped around his boyfriend.
Tony meowed, which was the initial cue to JARVIS when he wanted to be scanned. He made a scooping motion towards his chest, followed by dipping his head once. After a second or two of Tony standing still JARVIS gave a ‘bing’, and Dum-E stirred from where he had been told to stay (after not-so-helpfully trying to help, and accidentally knocking Tony off the table), and beeped happily at them.
“Come on, Tony, let’s go back upstairs.” Bruce said, scratching behind Tony’s ears. It had the opposite effect of what Bruce was aiming for, and Tony simply sprawled himself out on the cool concrete floor. Clint was still acting weird but he too started to pet down Tony’s back almost absent-mindedly. Tony wasn’t going back upstairs; once they stopped petting him, he was going to figure out what Loki had done to JARVIS, and get him operational again. They were sitting ducks without him protecting the mansion.
“Why did you do that? He’s not an animal!” Pepper said, both hands massaging underneath Tony’s ears.
“Who’s under that? Which of you is which? Widow, report.” He said, and Natasha stepped forwards to sit in front of his feet. He called each of their names (Clint had to be shoved forwards by Steve, since he had no idea what was going on), and grimaced as he eyed the cape. “That’s Tony, isn’t it?” He sounded resigned as he set down the uniforms and crouched next to the bundle. None of them knew how to tell him that it was actually Loki, and that the cat was fine anyways. Coulson lifted up the edge and his eyebrows scrunched up. The rest of the Avengers paced around him anxiously.
. That was the name of one of his last-ditch backup plans; Laundry Day was a code that could be used by the other Avengers if Tony was killed and someone had acquired his tech. It was an override that caused every single armor he’d ever built to initiate self-destruct.
“What the hell? She’s more banged up than I am!” Tony complained, standing right up on the bed while Clint held his arms out in a placating gesture.
Tony couldn’t see what the light was from the ground, so he made his way across the chapel, weaving around demolished pews and giving the destroyed alter a wide berth. The longer he stayed the more his neck tingled; the more he felt like he might not be completely alone. His footsteps were loud and echoed in the space no matter how hard he tried to be silent. Tony was grateful when he reached the scaffolding and started to inch his way up, legs hooking over the rungs of the ladder as he slowly pulled himself from level to level. Nobody talked on comms so he continued all the way to the top, stopping to listen just before he heaved himself onto the final platform.
“Fury, this is Agent Coulson. The Avengers have been compromised, Raven is in custody, and Iron Man is MIA. I’m going to need some backup.” The cats’ hearing was much more acute than it had ever been as humans (Steve’s hearing as well, which he assumed meant it had amplified even more, since it had been excellent thanks to the serum), so they could hear the whole conversation.
“Find Peter and his aunt, and extract them.” Tony said, flicking his tail to signal for the group to follow. He lead them down the street to where Peter’s house stood- thankfully- mostly intact. The front portion was partially collapsed in and they all picked their way carefully over the debris towards the kitchen. Tony stopped when he scented blood, fur fluffing out and nose wrinkling at the potency.
Steve finally got up and picked up all the wet towels while Tony shook himself out, dry but still freezing. Maybe, when Bruce came back up, Tony could convince his friend that he was a lap dog.
“I have returned from Asgard!” He boomed, startling Steve out of his chair. Tony barked in excitement and sat up, tail wagging. Thor walked over to him and dug something out of his pocket, holding out what looked like a leather collar.
Tony contemplated his options. The door was shut, and locked, with something too complex for him to open as a cat (He had to hand it to the kid, he was pretty smart). He might be able to pry open the laptop, but it was possible that the light would wake up Peter. He could try to open the window- though he wasn’t sure if he really wanted to find out whether he would land on his feet or not. So he sighed and curled up around Peter’s feet, drifting off to sleep faster than he ever had as a human.
“Are you alright? You seem stressed.” Steve put his elbows on his knees and relaxed his posture a bit to make sure he gave off a more companionable aura.
Natasha scooched her chair back and Tony got out of the way so she could get up and hobble back into the kitchen proper. He instead hopped onto a stool at the island and they stayed in comfortable silence while Natasha put a kettle on the stove, getting out a few ingredients from the cupboard.
“A spy must always be aware of their surroundings.” He started, and Tony actually paid attention to one of his ‘lessons’ for once; he was always giving one tip or another. “Nat is as silent as the grave, but I knew she was there because you turned to look right at her. Always be observant.” Clint tapped the skin next to his eye and went back to waiting with his slingshot, while Tony contemplated it. Clint was mostly deaf without his hearing aids in anyways, but the point was still valid. It actually proved the point even further but Tony just went back to chewing on his rubber penguin instead of over-analysing Clint and his guarding of the stove.
“Let’s go on a walk. Or at least try. I know a lot of cats that like walks, so let’s hope you don’t mind it.” Tony was actually glad to get out of the small room and burn off some of his nervous energy. Peter didn’t have to fight to get him into the harness, and as soon as they set foot outside, Tony was attempting to drag Peter down the street.
Tony forced his aching body to begin climbing the stairs. Now that he was a little more confident that New York was safe, his pains were returning. If the fighting failed to bring down the mansion, maybe he could catch a cat nap.
on the face. Peter looked really confused and scared- Tony didn’t really blame him. Official Suit Guy, accusing him of a felony. Poor guy. Tony purred at him, papping him a few more times until he smiled again. Coulson interrupted their little heart-to-heart, exchanging a glance with Hill.
just because it was the most dramatic option you had!” Steve jabbed his finger into the chest of the armor, right where the glass casing for the reactor sat. Tony slapped his hand away and used his height advantage to loom over him.
“What the hell, Stark?” Steve said, gesturing to the absolute mess he had made. The mansion was almost silent besides the faint noises of birds and cars from outside.
“Tony? Where are we?” Natasha hacked, trying to push herself up on her elbows. She seemed to remember what had happened because she groaned, putting her hands on her thigh. They had to get her out before the building destabilized, and it seemed like most of the issue was her left leg. It had to be trapped under a beam or something heavy. Tony turned and pulled the mask off his back, dropping it on Natasha’s stomach. She fumbled to put it on while he tried to think.
“I get it, I get it. Complaints noted.” Tony slammed the button to shut the workshop doors, leaving Steve to fume in the hallway. “Lock the lab, JARVIS. I have programs to code, boots to weld, and gear to fabricate.” Tony discarded his gauntlets and helmet on the table designated for the suit as he made his way to the back of the room, where JARVIS was prepping the machines to remove the rest of it. The process was more refined than it had been at first and Tony was off like a shot once the last piece came off, raising all the holograms he had left before the spontaneous battle. He had been halfway through a security upgrade for SHIELD’s helicarrier amongst numerous other things. He plucked that particular hologram out and discarded the rest, opening up a few empty windows for notes and ideas as he went, delving back into his project as the workaholic version of stress relief.
“Hey, Steve. Thanks.” Tony grabbed a sandwich and gestured to a spare seat, where Steve sat down and started in on the rest of the sandwiches like he’d been starved. Tony could swear that the man lived half his life in the kitchen.
“Did I wake you?” She asked softly, dropping a hand to card her fingers through the fur on the back of his neck.
“I’m peachy, really. All good.” Tony assured him, enjoying the last few scratches before Bruce got up and cracked his back.
“What do we do?” Peter called, having sat down next to the agent. He was petting Bruce with one hand while he nervously fidgeted at the hem of his shirt with the other. Tony and Steve trotted over to meet them and Tony immediately went in for the phone, but Peter saw what he was doing and got to it first. “I’m calling Coulson this time.”
Sure enough, it folded like a chair. Before Tony could worry about it getting up, Spider-Man came up from behind and webbed it to the ground, tearing off the head for good measure.
“If you want to stay here, that’s fine by me. I’m going to help my friend- who is a small helpless teenager, by the way- and keep him from getting killed. I’m going to go and do my goddamned
“You can go now, Tony, I’ll turn off the locks.” Bruce said, getting out his phone and tapping at it a few times. Tony wasted no time in limping across the house and down the stairs, right into Bruce’s lab. He hopped up on a stool and prayed that his paws would register on the screen.
sulking about his Daddy Issues when he heard a car pull up. The gravel crunched as two people walked up to the front door, and Tony was about to jump up and sound the alarm when a key was turned in the lock and he heard Clint complaining about something.
“Are you sure bringing Stark in is a wise choice?” Clint asked, as blunt as ever. Tony would have been insulted, but to be quite frank, he was wondering the same thing.
Loki!’ Tony tried to shout, but it only came out as a series of barks. Clint looked over at him and frowned while he pulled Loki’s arm over his shoulders to help him walk.
“Calm down, man. You’re too tense. Mi casa es su casa, or however that goes.” Tony was the first one done eating, and he jumped up onto the granite countertop to hang out with Peter. The kid was in awe; he couldn’t keep his eyes still for more than a few seconds.
“What happened? What’s… Why?” She settled on rather lamely, and Clint looked over at Thor and Steve expectantly. Thor spoke up before Steve could
“Wait, you mean, like, I, uh, I would be- like you mean that I’m going to watch them? Here. Like I’m going to be here, what, cat-sitting, but for like sentient cats?” Tony snorted, but Coulson ignored him and nodded at Peter.
Tony wiggled closer with every omission, finally ending up draped in Clint’s lap while the archer stroked his fur. He talked about the nightmare he’d had, of losing Natasha in that building, finding her broken and bloody because he hadn’t been near enough or fast enough.
“Good luck, kid. I’m going down to the lab.” Tony smacked Clint in the face to liberate his tail, and then jumped down from the table and made a break for it before someone could catch him again.
Tony was a bit nervous about Peter, so he paced around the living room for a while, much to the annoyance of the rest of the team.
“I can’t handle it when he says shit like that with a smile on his face. It fucking freaks me out.” Tony grumbled, pulling the phone towards him and trying to type some shred of an explanation that left his ego somewhat intact. Shame burned on his nose, but he still felt the need to defend them somewhat. Or at least defend everyone else, since it was really just Tony who convinced them all to go with him.
” Tony shouted, having regained some energy after nearly drowning. The team had benched him while they helped clean up since he’d refused to go to medical.
“It’s not the same as laughing as a human. You’ve gotta…” Steve trailed off and frowned, his nose scrunched up in concentration. Tony thought it was one of the most adorable things he’s ever seen. “You know that thing cats do, when they see a bird?” Steve imitated the noise, a quiet chattering sound. Tony made it back and Steve nodded. “It’s like that. Next time, try doing that, but louder and more of a… chuff, I guess.”
“He’s right, you know. I bet he would faint if he knew how much this kitchen cost.” Natasha chuckled at herself, but Tony had to agree. It was… a pricey building.
The kettle was just about to steam when she took it off, pouring a cup and adding a packet of tea along with a spoonful of honey. It smelled soft and homey, like the perfect drink to soothe one’s thoughts.
“None of us speak dog, Stark.” Clint grumbled, handing Bruce a roll of tape to hold the gauze in place with one hand while he scratched under Tony’s chin with the other. He closed up the first aid kit once Bruce was finished.
He grumbled to himself, paw pads rubbed raw from sprinting across pavement. He was dodging gunfire at every step, robot shrapnel raining down, craters opening up in the streets. Pure chaos.
Clint was quiet for another minute, before he partially uncurled himself and looked at Tony for the first time that night. His eyes were bloodshot and he was sporting purple under-lids, looking really-not-okay. They looked at each other and Clint finally deflated, resting his forehead on his knees as he started to talk, a hoarse whisper that seemed too loud, filling up the room despite trying to curl in on itself and disappear.
Finally Tony heard something shift above him and he barked, voices muffled through the rubble but getting closer.
“Relax for a second, deep breaths.” He whispered, demonstrating and trying to get Tony to copy him. He tried, forcing his chest to sync up with Clint’s, but there wasn’t enough air getting in and he started to hack again.
“Loki transformed them all into cats.” There was complete silence on the other end, and they could almost hear the look on Fury’s face from the heavy quiet.
“I see them!” Someone called, sunlight suddenly filtering in through the cracks in the drywall. Several pairs of hands lifted up the piece that was on Tony’s back and he pushed off the one that was resting on his head and neck. It was too bright and there were so many people, his body completely exhausted. Tony’s legs wobbled and gave out so he laid down next to Natasha while there was a path cleared to lower a gurney down for her; there was no way to wheel one in. Someone’s hands slid under Tony’s chest and he was lifted up and out of their way.
Tony was feeling the deja vu pretty hard as the scanners were hooked onto his vest and he was shooed out into the freezing night. There was nearly a foot of snow on the ground and Tony had to lift his feet like a show pony to push forwards.
Dawson’s voice sounded distorted and worbled the next time he spoke, and Tony had no idea what he’d said. The whole inside of the decrepit church was pitch-black and dead silent. No birds, no skittering of small creatures over the bricks, no shifting of the building. No wind. Tony was utterly alone.
“Well, I suppose my ruse is up. Pity. I was so close to dismantling this wretched computer.” Loki stood up and didn’t even reach for his crutches before he smoothed out his shirt and took a step forwards. The other Avengers were finally convinced, murmuring to each other. Tony had already had enough.
“Let’s talk for a second. If you guys could excuse us.” Steve said, laying his tail on Tony’s back and steering them into the kitchen.
“Tony, are you alright?! Thor, can you find him?” Steve was yelling, and Clint said something, but then the water sloshed up into his nose and Tony was effectively drowning. The grasshopper had stopped moving, but the legs were locked in a morbid embrace even after death. Tony tried to scream and it came out as a desperate gurgle.
It was pretty much Tony’s fault, what had happened. He’d pissed Loki off, made the spell rebound, and dragged everyone out of the tower to go chasing after some teenager the rest of them barely knew. What was he thinking? That they could ‘save the day’? Granted, they found May, but all of those houses had people in them, and SHIELD was never too far behind with search and rescue. She likely would have been fine- just a few scratches and a minor concussion.
Tony lunged up and sunk his teeth into Loki’s leg, biting down as hard as he could. To his surprise there was a sick
“Shit!” Steve spat, pushing past Thor to jump and slap his paw against the door release. It opened with a quiet hiss, and they all pushed into the room. Peter let Tony and Natasha jump down from his arms and he went to check on the agent, letting the cats search the room for any sign of Loki.
“Stark, there’s nothing here. What are you looking for?” Clint called, turning to make his way back to the entrance. Tony let out an anxious whine that startled them both as he felt his fur standing on end. Didn’t Clint feel it?
The first thing Tony did was create an entire new interface for interacting with JARVIS. It took hours to type up the relatively mediocre code- mostly because of his paws, but also because Steve was lounging on the table next to the keyboard, and he kept
Tony climbed up to stand on the edge of the platform and stared. The tesseract had gone back with Thor to Asgard- what the hell was it doing back on earth?
“Comms check.” Rumlow barked, and Tony wanted to heave a sigh. He was fed up with the guy after being stuck in a quinjet with him for hours. He steeled himself and pushed down his irritation to focus on the mission.
“Coyote, we’re going back. Come on.” Clint ordered, not waiting for Tony to follow him as he ducked outside. The room seemed to lean in closer and Tony turned tail, leaving the feeling behind as he trotted after Clint back through the town and into the woods once more.
“That was a lot of spiders. We lost the connection to your comms and the camera died, so I came in to check on you. What the hell was that crashing sound?” Clint wandered back towards the entrance to the church, but he was back in a flash and didn’t seem to realize that he was itching himself. Apparently the spiders hadn’t left yet.
Monroe woke up a few minutes after Peter hung up with Coulson, and to say he was not pleased was an understatement.
“Okay, Coulson, stop freaking him out! He’s just doing what he thinks is right, that’s all- Pete, bud, if you could stop squeezing me so tight-” Tony wriggled a little, shimmying his way out of Peter’s death grip. He licked his new friend’s chin and then got up onto the table, padding over to Coulson and papping him on the face.
Tony wallowed for what felt like forever, until suddenly the lights turned off, and the whole ward was plunged into near-darkness, save the soft safety lights that lined the hallways.
instead of someone else. Especially when it involved Starbucks- his guilty pleasure when he had the time.
Tony flailed into a sitting position and started to cough. His eyes were watering and there was something on his face, what the fuck-
And he knew Tony was there. “Now is no time for games. We have something to discuss.” He continued, and Tony barely stopped himself from screeching when a hand grabbed onto his tail, yanking him around the island and across the tile until he was surrounded by seven masked figures and one incredibly sadistic bastard.
Tony pounded down the stairs, and input his code into Bruce’s keypad. If he shut down the generator, he could find where that ticking was coming from, and move the bomb into the safest place in the mansion.
“Are you alright?” Steve asked, and Tony hadn’t realized it was been directed at him until Steve nudged one of his paws. Tony cracked open an eye to see Steve giving him a frown.
“Well, it was at least a replica, or an illusion. But yes.” Tony confirmed. Fury rubbed a hand over his mouth in thought.
“We need something for you, I won’t let you go inside without something to prevent smoke inhalation!” She nearly had to shout over the chaos so that he could hear her, and Tony’s mind raced to think of something. He’d personally upgraded the SHIELD agents’ gear multiple times, but he had no idea what they kept in their pockets.
Hannah spoke like she knew Natasha personally, so Steve seemed to ditch the act and he went straight to the point.
“Oh, you don’t even know. You’ve never even seen him with his shirt wet, it’s like fucking Christmas in July-” Tony was cut off by the return of Coulson, who was just in time to see Natasha bump shoulders with Tony and twitch her whiskers at him. She totally agreed.
Tony looked down and nearly threw up. His reactor was gone, and he was going to die, the shrapnel was going to pierce his heart and kill him and the team wouldn’t even have any idea that he’d died and he would be put down as missing and never found again.
“We’ve met, yes.” Loki said, picking at his nails as if he was bored. Tony subtly triggered the Avengers alarm he had on his phone and slipped it into his pocket. Loki glanced down at it but said nothing, instead lounging back in the seat and crossing his legs.
Tony wrote, shoving it back at Agent and holding his head up high while a vein started to stand out on their handler’s temple.
Let me know what you think about Nat's nickname for Tony! According to wiki, both Steve and Tony are fluent in Russian, so they both will be able to understand what she's saying, but I prefer just putting translations in the chapter notes instead of interluding to explain. Hopefully that's okay with you guys, but if I get any feedback that you want it the other way, I can change it :)
“Well, that means we have an hour to kill. And Tony needs supplies.” Clint had a shit-eating grin on his face, but Tony had no idea why. He also detested the notion of supplies- he had anything he wanted there in the mansion. What else did Clint think he needed?
“Wait, wait, wait. How do we know he’s not lying?” Bruce called, and they all looked over at where he was leaning against the door frame, hot cup of coffee clutched in his hands and hovering just beneath his chin. “Maybe this dog
“Sorry. Anyways; team, this is Peter. Peter, this is team. Also known as Steve, Natasha, Clint, Thor, and Bruce.” Peter just blinked at them, but Tony kept going. “I don’t think you’ve figured it out yet- bless your young, naive soul- but we’re basically the Avengers, and-”
“I’m fine, the comms always seem to go dead whenever I get near the source of the energy readings.” Tony said, and he heard an angry huff over the line.
Tony started kicking his legs and twisting in an attempt to get down. The skin on his neck was screaming in pain from being held up for so long. It felt the same as being dangled by the hair on his head; Tony had experienced that more than enough for one lifetime.
Tony turned into a near-empty parking lot to see the quinjet idling behind the forms of Natasha and Steve, who were waiting for Clint as he all but dragged ‘Tony’ towards the open hatch.
“I won’t be gone for long, buddy. I’m gonna go for a ride, get some lunch, and be back before you know it. I promise.” Tony ran a hand down Dummy’s arm as he made his way to the workshop doors, getting to the garage as stealthily as he could to avoid running into Steve. He got in his Audi and peeled out of the driveway with a screech of tires.
It was so loud that Tony wasn’t surprised when all of the other Avengers (minus Loki and surprisingly Bruce) came rushing in from the kitchen. They all looked excited to see Thor, until Steve glanced down and noticed Tony standing next to him.
After what felt like forever, Tony reached the bottom of the steps. The door had an old-fashioned keypad, which ran on its own separate generator in the event of a power outage, which suited his situation well. His nose was clumsy with the disk in his mouth but he painstakingly pressed the combination in and waited for the heavy ballistic bay door to slide open.
Tony didn’t sleep, but he let the noises around him fade away as he solved equations and drew schematics in his head.
Hannah gave Steve a smile and nodded. “It wasn’t totally out of the way; I have a relative who works for SHIELD, and I’ve always wanted to check out the helicarrier.” She gave Tony some new gauze and re-taped the wound, putting the sweater back on him and rubbing underneath his chin.
After a few minutes he found the place he had entered the town and released a breath of pure relief, passing the barrier and letting himself relax slightly as the sounds of the wind and birds filtered back into his ears. The comms also crackled from static into voices- angry voices.
There wasn’t another delay as they got back on the quinjet as left Italy- and Tocco Caudio- far behind.
“Well we can start with your teeth now, it’ll only take a minute or so. I also cleaned up my lab, so you can come hang out, if you wanted.” Bruce said, leading Tony to the bedrooms and into Tony’s own.
“What happened here, Tony?” Bruce asked, coming up on his other side and looking him up and down for other wounds. The Avengers (save for Thor, who was sitting with Coulson’s team) were all gathered in a loose circle around Tony, so he figured he could give them a quick debrief of sorts.
“We’ll figure this out, Clint. Loki is in the same boat we are, he’s bound to change us back once he wakes up.” Steve sat down, twitching his whiskers in confusion when he saw the blank look on the archer’s face, which slowly turned to a look of horror, and finally settled on irritated acceptance.
“What in the hell-” She muttered, sitting up and blinking owlishly at both the cats and the debris. “Peter’s cat?” May said incredulously as she stroked her hand down Tony’s spine. He murrped happily and sat down as she scratched under his chin.
tell what was what, “-and here. It probably would have been worse if you’d already been put on fluids. Honestly, I’m surprised at how bad this is, compared to how calm you are.” Hannah gestured for them to follow her again and Clint tagged along as Steve carried Tony and Bruce hovered by his elbow with the oxygen tank.
Tony thought, shaking himself to make his fur lay right. When he looked up, everyone but Thor was staring at him like he’d grown a second head.
Sorry it took me a while to update! I'm still trying though, and I'm going to finish this if it's the last thing I do!
“Um, can I help you?” She asked, half in the elevator to keep it from taking her with them, but probably also to keep it from leaving with a stranger on board. Tony meowed at her in delight, rubbing his cream and brown fur all over her black pants. Her face scrunched up in annoyance and her shoulders fell a little as she seemed to resign herself to the situation. It wasn’t anything different from what Tony usually saw from her, so he kept getting cat hair all over her slacks, if only to keep their relationship consistent.
Something bumped against his elbow and Tony turned to see Dummy holding out the blender container itself instead of a regular cup. It looked to be a fruit smoothie this time, which was weird, since he didn’t think he’d brought anything fruity down to the workshop recently.
“I felt bad that all you can eat is cat food, so I thought that while I was taking a break, I’d make something a bit more interesting for you.” Pepper explained, straightening up and dumping the contents of her bowl onto the counter. Tony and Steve hopped up onto a barstool and watched as she started to knead what looked like dough. "I also took some medicine to keep my eyes from swelling shut, and it seems to be doing wonders."
“Tony, shhh, calm down-” Someone rested a hand between his shoulders and he would have laughed if he could get enough air to do so.
?” Clint said, leaving Tony- the ‘dog’- alone and instead going back to the doppelganger to help him up. Loki made a bit of a show of trying to stand and then collapsing, holding his leg and scrunching his face up in pain. Tony didn’t see any of the other Avengers, though he heard the
“Aunt May, I’m home!” He called, thundering up the steps and shutting his bedroom door behind himself.
“You were given fair warning.” Was all she said before she was on him, bowling Tony over and slamming them against another table leg. Tony clawed and bit with all he was worth, but this was obviously not an ordinary cat. She had exceptional strength, tossing him across the space like she was playing with a mouse. She streaked towards him and Tony had the sudden epiphany that he was in way over his head, unable to do anything as she jumped on him and dug her claws into his stomach. Tony kicked out with his back legs as hard as he could, sending her flying a few feet. Just enough for him to get his bearings. Loki was still lying in a heap in the middle of the room and Tony had just inadvertently thrown their aggressor right back to where she wanted to be.
“You guys seem pretty down in the dumps. I’m sure Coulson will get him back, he seems qualified enough for that sort of thing.” Peter chirped, seeming mostly unphased and chipper. Tony wasn’t sure why, and he was distracted as the doors pinged and they were released back into the Avengers’ commons floor. The cats dispersed and Peter’s face went back to being slightly anxious as he looked to be internally regretting his decision to sign the forms Coulson gave him.
“Miss us?” Clint chuckled, clapping Steve on the shoulder as he went by. Bruce came up to Tony and took off his vest before he gave him a once-over, tutting when he found a lot of bruising and the sprained ankle. Natasha and Steve talked about the mission while Tony sat and waited for Bruce to return with a medkit.
“The other guy’s a bit upset today, but hell if I know why. I think I need a vacation.” Bruce leaned his head back against the seat and they remained quiet until it was time to disembark.
By the time Tony was let out of the bathroom it was almost noon, and he didn’t leave his bedroom until after dusk. The rest of the team was gathered in the living room, a new couch having been acquired while Tony was in ‘timeout’. Nobody turned to look at him as he trotted over to an empty chair and jumped up. He had just flopped down when Steve reached over the armrest and pushed him off onto the floor.
“If he breaks anything, or makes a mess-” She started, but Peter was already wrapping his arms around her and thanking her. Aunt May’s chin rested on his shoulder and Tony gave her a friendly pap on the cheek with a paw. She laughed and gave him a small scratch behind his ears. “He’s definitely cute.”
Natasha was leaned against a wall and her head was on her shoulder. Tony came up to her again and whined, pawing at one of her hands. They needed to get out- the building was still unsound, and they had no idea when it would come down around them.
Tony would have loved to give Steve a piece of his mind, but he could only growl. That got him a glare as they walked back down the hallway and Tony sighed.
Tony ran forward and leaped onto the counter, typing a quick message onto his phone and spinning it to face her.
So they sat down and Tony recited the mission from start to finish as Fury stared at him with the same level expression the entire time.
He gave one final look at Spider-Man, who looked incredibly confused, even with his mask on. Fury turned to the guy and sighed.
That… sounded like agent Jackson who was shouting. If he didn’t listen to the kid, then he’d hopefully listen to Tony. Shield would take this vigilante-teen, interrogate him, and cajole him until they got his identity. He’d be watched, or forbidden from being involved in Avengers matters- and from the brief interactions Tony already had with the kid, he knew that wouldn’t stop him. He’d get himself into much more trouble than he was already in- trouble with the law. He’d make himself a scapegoat for the government’s looming movement on superhero registration.
“Alright, I believe you.” Bruce rolled up and tore off the used paper, setting it aside to be destroyed later. He then sat down heavily next to Tony and whipped his phone out. He used the arm holding the coffee to wrap around the back of Tony’s neck and he held out his phone with the other, smiling as he snapped a selfie. Tony peered over his shoulder at the shot and Steve walked in to see them both focused on the phone, chuckling to each other as Bruce set the picture as Tony’s contact image.
“I wonder how fast we can get down the stairs…” Steve turned and hurried to the emergency stair access, meowing to let JARVIS know that they wanted him to open the door. As soon as it was open, Steve was bounding down the steps, Clint shouting behind him.
Tony sighed and motioned for the computers to be shut down, walking back to the doors with Steve right on his heels. They stood outside the elevator doors and waited with their sides pressed together, easy and quiet. They had mastered companionable silence before either of them had even realized they liked the other, and it was common for them to be together without being on top of each other all of the time. It was something Tony loved about their relationship, though they had only been ‘official’ for a few months, and they still had things to work out- but they’d made it this far, and Tony had faith in them to persevere through the rough patches. It was a bit strange to trust himself so much when it came to relationships, but it was really Steve’s fault. His positive vibes were contagious.
It was at that point that Bruce emerged, looking like a deer in headlights; he was probably fresh from a science binge, the lights too bright and not enough coffee in his system to function any higher than 57%. Tony knew the feeling.
throughout the lab, and he was nearly crushed by a pair of squabbling cats who materialized in mid air above him.
Tony resumed his angry gnawing on a large bone he had found behind a dumpster. He had no idea where it came from, and he never wanted to find out. It was as stress-relieving as a sparring session, so he wasn’t going to look too deep into it.
“Of course not!” Thor scoffed. He turned to Tony and crossed his arms. “There are more ways to communicate than just words. Do you know Anthony Stark?” Thor said, giving a smug look to the others when Tony nodded his head slowly and deliberately. They all shifted uncomfortably and their faces went from doubtful to resigned acceptance.
“God, Chrome? Dude, that’s archaic. I almost feel bad for you.” Tony mewed, sitting up to begin licking himself clean. It was a carnal urge, and once he realized that he couldn’t really taste the grime he decided it wasn’t so bad. Being dirty made him feel itchy.
“There are a number of creatures I know of that could perhaps be her.” He announced, the end of his tail flicking back and forth in irritation. Natasha paused in her translation for Clint to look at Thor with a calculating glance.
“We can get Peter and his aunt, and we can get them out of there.” He said, ignoring the way his teammates shot each other doubtful glances. Why didn’t they care?
Tony refused to die, he wasn’t going to go back to that bucket or that cave or those bastard men and he needed to get
“No, not from what I saw. Just aggressive. It wasn’t mangey looking or anything so either it was a lost pet, or someone ditched it. Not our purview.” Clint said, looking over at Natasha. She gave a small nod, and they started back towards the quinjet.
Seeing Pepper, Tony was reminded how much he missed her, and even how much he missed being Iron Man. If he wasn’t turned back soon Fury would have kittens. Tony wouldn’t get kicked off the team, though. Right?
“Tis’ a common thing in Asgard, a normal spell put upon bracelets or jewelry for those who hath vocal or hearing impairments. Tis’ an enchantment that hears the thoughts of the wearer and projects them as spoken words. Not to worry, Tony-” Thor added when he saw Tony reel back in alarm. “-it only speaks the thoughts you wish to be spoken. Try once more.” He urged, and Tony leaned back when the others all leaned in expectantly.
“It won’t help you, but if you swear on your mother’s grave to be careful, you can go in with me and find Nat,
Peter’s face expanded into a grin, and he nudged Tony’s paw with a finger. “Sooo. You never mentioned you had a
“Thank God.” Tony huffed, watching at the scene of the fight grew closer on the HUD. JARVIS dropped them off near the beginning of Peter’s neighborhood and they all tumbled to the ground- scraped up- but grateful all the same.
Tony gazed at Steve, silently pleading for him to salvage the situation. Ever the team captain, he jumped back into the conversation.
After their first night as cats, the team was more adjusted and ready to find their missing member. Clint especially, even though he hadn’t a clue what was going on when Natasha wasn’t tapping on him in morse code.
Steve made himself a sandwich and took it with him back to his room. Tony took the opportunity to grab up the bowl, take it to the bathroom, and dump all of the contents into the toilet. He flushed it and swore vengeance upon Loki as he watched it swirl down and away.
“We were gone for like, six hours. What happened?” Clint said, picking up an empty cushion husk and tossing it onto a chair. Steve shook his head.
Everything was fuzzy, and slow, and it took a few shakes of his head to get his bearings back. Something was rocking him, pushing his shoulder back and forth. It had felt like he was only down for a second, but somehow somebody was already next to him.
He told himself, tilting his head side to side as he tried to pick up on any noises. He got nothing so he started to pick his way carefully towards the corner with the blue light, neck craning as he looked up. There was a ton of scaffolding in that portion of the church, as if someone had started doing repairs and then abandoned the place a second time.
“You’re talkative, I’ll give you that. Definitely some kind of Siamese… which is weird. I’ve never seen a Siamese cat with brown eyes. Your head is also really round...” He zoned out as he started typing, scrolling through google images in search of a similar cat. Tony took the chance to check out the room he’d be stuck in for the foreseeable future.
“Do any of you guys want to watch a movie? You have movies, right?” Peter asked uncertainly, shrinking into himself a fraction when he was met with silence. JARVIS decided to take pity on the kid and spoke up.
After a few seconds he tried flexing the muscles in his throat, and was pleased to hear a deep rumbling start up in his chest. Tony was awarded a watery smile.
Tony wasn’t sure how long he’d been out when he woke up. He was lying on the cool cement in what looked like an alley, nobody else in sight.
“You could get hurt, so yes, you’re still locked out.” Steve said, passing them all and disappearing into the kitchen. Bruce frowned at his retreating back and heaved a sigh.
Steve was frowning at it, though he said nothing. Clint glanced up and seemed to pick up on Steve’s tension.
“He’s here with us, Cap, don’t worry.” Bruce answered, from where he was still fussing over Tony’s bandages. Only a couple little cuts required gauze, but the spot where his head smacked the pavement had been wrapped and treated with ice. Bruce generously volunteered to hold it- given that Tony couldn’t.
Rhodey chatted aimlessly for a minute or so before he promised to visit soon, and they ended the call, leaving Tony and Steve sitting on the icy driveway while Bruce stood there, shoeless. Tony avoided eye contact and started back towards the house while they trailed behind him.
“I suppose that would work. I’d love to get my hands on that greasy little weasel if you’re telling the truth.” Bruce said, shrugging innocently as Thor shot him a look.
“Well, it’s definitely good to see you again. What’ll you be having?” Tony always got something different if he was in a good mood. He settled on something 120% chocolate and cavity-inducing, thanking the barista- Megan- after he got his drink and left to sit down. He chose a quiet corner and sipped his sugary monstrosity while he went through his emails. Most were about the battle from the morning, a few from Fury and Coulson, while the rest was from SI and Pepper.
Tony thought, staring down at the horrible-smelling bowl of dog food with a small white pill sitting on top. He’d actually gotten hungry enough the night before to try a bite, and it was even worse than it smelled. There was
He was getting terribly frustrated at how limited his life was so suddenly. Dog’s didn’t have a language, and all the noises like barks and growls and yelps conveyed emotion more so than actual words. Tony quite literally couldn’t speak.
“I’m good to go, Katniss.” He joked, and Clint shot him a half-glare half-smile before he ducked back out of the room.
Tony’s head bobbed as he weaved between legs and avoided getting brained by briefcases and the occasional suitcase, hissing angrily when an oblivious businessman stepped on his tail. He felt overstimulated as he sped up, trying to block out the sounds and focus on the smells. He was familiar with many of the restaurants around New York, and if he could find one he recognized, he might be able to make it back to the tower with relative ease. Bolstered by his plan, Tony continued on.
“Who’s are you, huh? Where do you belong?” He continued to coo, and Tony took the opportunity to look around. He’d made it a couple blocks, and the fighting wasn’t as close as before. Spider-Man must have been watching the perimeter, and chased down the escapee robot. “I could bring you somewhere, I’m sure the Avengers have this covered-”
sapient? This is so cool-” Peter paused, face slowly turning into a frown. “...Wait. I’ve been baby-talking you for two whole days, and I put you on a leash. Sorry about that...” Peter’s face was turning pink, and Tony almost laughed. He typed out, ‘No big deal’ on the phone, and Pete smiled. “Cool. So, like, are you a sapient cat, or were you a human turned into a cat, or-”
“He’s got some fluid build-up in his lungs, but I gave him some diuretics, which should force it out.” Harley said to Clint, who stood up straight and nodded.
“Tony really wasn’t supposed to be anywhere near the fighting, but he’s stubborn.” Steve seemed to hesitate after that. The last time they had seen her, Steve hadn’t let on that Tony was anything more than a pet. But if he was going to tell the truth, they would have to let the cat out of the bag.
“Bruce put together a new diet for you, and I think you’ll like it a lot more than kibble.” Steve popped off the lid and gave the container to Tony, who investigated the contents. There was a whole raw chicken leg, a few tablespoons of some kind of meat and some chopped up vegetables all coated in what smelled like egg yolk. It was less than a regular portion size and Tony figured it was because they didn’t want him to get sick. Either way he wasn’t at all complaining, and dug right in, tail thumping against the bed. He’d stopped trying to force it to sit still when he was happy and Clint snorted.
At some point, he heard the door open and feet fade back out of the bedroom, but it must have been another hour before he could make himself open the cabinet door and force himself back into his bedroom. Tony felt so exhausted and weak that he crawled under his bed with a blanket and slept in a small nest where no one could find him and put him back in hell.
The desk was nice, though Tony couldn’t really see the browns very well. There was a lamp, and stacks of clear disk cases all over. Files? Why would a kid need so many files? Tony figured they were probably for school, the poor sap. He also had a bookshelf full of the classics. Tony sniffed along the bottom and could tell that the kid favored Vonnegut, though Whiteman was a close second; those volumes smelled more strongly of him than the others. He smelled like laundry detergent and fresh paper, combined with the metallic smokiness you got when you used a blowtorch. Tony trotted over to the closet and stood up on his hind legs to reach the knob. As soon as he got it open, the kid glanced around at Tony and startled out of his chair.
Chills crawled up Tony’s back and he took a deep breath as he soldiered his way across town to his destination. From their satellite images, it had perhaps been an old house or shop.
“Loki is gone.” There was a long few seconds of silence on the other end, and Tony wasn’t sure if it was because Coulson was trying to keep his cool, or if he had covered the mouthpiece with a hand and shot off a string of swears without them hearing. After a few moments he cleared his throat and Peter winced.
Along with the quiet came a faint ticking sound. With Loki’s bomb still fresh on Tony’s mind, he darted into the hallway to locate it. He investigated as far as the stairs before the emergency generator rumbled to life, lights and electronics resuming their normal functions.
“Both your fibula and tibia are snapped, of course it’s broken. Stop complaining and hold still so I can splint it.” Bruce growled, massaging a palm against his forehead while he tried to wrap Stark’s leg.
Steve looked pissed, but he didn’t say anything, instead getting on comms to talk to the SHIELD agents in charge of cleanup and medical assistance. JARVIS spoke up in Tony’s private comm line while everyone else wandered away to help the agents organize the chaos.
“Thor? Is that you?” He sat up all the way and looked around. They were still on the roof of Avengers tower. “What happened? Why are we cats?” Steve looked down at himself again and felt his heart beating light and fast against his rib cage. Thor nodded solemnly.
“Nu-uh, Stark, don’t even think about it.” Clint said, coming up behind Tony and gently nudging him towards the door with his foot. Tony made as if he was going back to the living room, but at the last second he veered off towards his bed and laid down. Clint was glaring at him, but Tony tried to look as innocent as possible as he lowered his head and wagged his tail.
“Release me, you filthy mongrel!” Loki screeched, claws whirling and tail lashing as he thrashed his body in Phil’s grip. It had barely been an hour since everything had happened and the god was finally awake; and righteously pissed. Phil looked around the room, striding over to the couch, tucking Loki under an arm and getting one of the pillowcases off the couch pillows. Three of them were regular sleep pillows and Phil used one of those. He dropped Loki inside it and tied the open end, letting the bundle dangle from his fist as he observed the damage.
“He owns seven cats, as of two days ago. Well, maybe six, I don’t really know how this actually works, they just made me sign the papers and told me not to fuck up under pretense of extreme pain and the literal obliteration of any future conquests, to quote Agent Coulson directly. I can call him, if that’s what it’ll take for you to let me leave without being castrated. Please.” Peter was subtly leaning back while Pepper was slightly leaned forward, scowling at the kid as his rambling petered out to a nervous grimace. Tony reached up on his back legs and pushed Peter’s new Starkphone up and out of his pocket, pinning it to the floor and typing in Phil’s contact info while Clint watched over his shoulder and Steve took his turn giving Pepper’s slacks a new layer of orange fur.
Loki shouted in surprise and sliced his knife across the meat of Tony’s shoulder before he dropped it, instead using both hands to pull at Tony, who held on for dear life. He couldn’t see what was going on behind him but he saw mjolnir glint out of the corner of his eye and Loki’s body lurched to the side. They nearly toppled over, but Loki finally yanked himself free, and then he was gone, letting Tony drop to the floor like a sack of potatoes. His back hit the cement and all the air was pushed out of his lungs in a
“The Fantastic Four are officially on call, in case something happens while the Avengers are out of commission. And since I highly doubt any of you are going to be staying behind, I’ve gone ahead and procured the necessary supplies.” Coulson informed them, rifling through a box by the fridge and coming up with six tiny flak jackets. Steve lifted his tail in excitement while every other cat groaned.
“Bruce also told me about what happened this morning, before the alert. Ochen' stranno, Tones. Very strange situation.” Her voice had an undertone of suspicion now, and Tony started searching for anything that could bolster his previous excuses. Or… he could come clean.
“I don’t want Stark getting fur all over my helicarrier, so let’s make this brief.” He said, as ill-tempered as usual. He seemed especially grouchy, though it was warranted; they’d had Loki almost within their grasp and he’d slipped right from the Avengers’ fingers.
“We need to split-” The agent started, but Tony barked loud and harsh, and she fell silent. He turned and cocked his head side to side before he made up his mind, nearly sprinting through the halls towards the faint yelling he could hear. The agent was following behind and swearing as she jumped over beams and fire, doubling her pace when she seemed able to hear the noise too.
“Crying is a healthy way of dealing with emotions, you know. Everyone does it.” Tony added, and Clint gave one last sniff before he seemed to compose himself.
“No. Thank you, though.” She murmured, petting down his head before leaning back and pulling her new mug to her chest. “I should be getting back to bed. You too, shchenok.” Natasha said, briefly pressing her lips to the top of his head when she rounded the counter. The sound of her sirregular footfalls faded as she returned to her room, and Tony slid down off the stool and limped back to his bed, curling up as he let the smell of honey lull him to sleep.
“Okay, sure. You must have a pretty bad concussion if you’ve forgotten. Bruce, should we bring him to see Hannah?” Steve acquiesced, hands up in surrender.
“Perhaps a nearby, advisor-like role would be best.” Natasha agreed, but their conversation was interrupted as the loading bay doors in the back of the jet hissed open.
Tony’s heart monitor jumped in pace and he took a deep breath, willing himself to be calm. The hallway lights were on, he was fine. He was on the helicarrier, above New York, in the medical wing. He was fine.
“I need to get them outside. Keep looking for Widow, and pull your tab when you find her or any other survivors. Stay safe.” She gave him a pat on the side of the neck and then she was gone, leaving Tony to bound back the way they had come and navigate his way through the hallways. Natasha had been underneath the corner that had exploded, and he didn’t often pray; but he prayed to any God that was listening for her to be alright.
“Those were basic questions. Tony Stark 101. I need something more specific…” Bruce trailed off, unclasping one of his hands from his mug. “What’s the Operation Harlem override code?” Bruce asked, knuckles white on his cup. Tony was the only person who had those codes, and it would make them both uncomfortable to have it on paper somewhere. But Tony needed to prove himself- and he had the most expensive paper shredder on the market upstairs in his office.
“I did what I had to, okay?” Tony snapped, pulling the release on a gauntlet and yanking it off. Steve was hot on his heels as they made their way into the mansion from the landing pad. The Quinjet wasn’t back yet, and Steve had asked for a ride back. Tony knew he was going to get yelled at when he accepted the request, but Steve’s ire only got worse the longer one avoided it, so he tended to just let Cap blow off some steam so it would be over faster.
Hands grabbed onto his shoulder and gave him a shake, causing Tony to fly upwards and knock skulls with the person crouched over him. It turned out to be Steve, who didn’t even flinch at the collision.
“Nothing out of the ordinary, besides a lot of spiders. The energy signatures faded before we even left.” She reported, dropping her bag at her feet. They hadn’t expected to stay for very long but bringing supplies was always a precaution; just in case.
interrupted Tony’s train of thought. Another suit had landed right behind him, and was raising a weaponized hand to shoot at him.
On unsteady legs, Tony hauled himself up, and placed his body between the kid and the guns. Jackson lowered his uncertainly, but the rest of the group didn’t flinch. Tony wasn’t tall enough to totally shield the kid, and they still had a rather clear shot.
“It bum rushed me, too, but I rolled out of the way and it was gone when I looked back.” Tony finished. Neither of them spoke up as they thought about what he’d said, and the comfortable silence lingered as Clint tossed Natasha her controller and unpaused the game.
“Normal dogs would have already gone into shock, but you’re even up and moving when you really shouldn’t be. Which was a mistake on my part if I’m honest. You need to be laying down with oxygen and monitored fluids until you heal.” Hannah continued as she led them into a standard hospital room and pointed at one of the two empty beds.
Tony barely managed a few minutes of rest before three suits descended on his alley, weapons primed.
“Can’t you sit still for ten seconds?” Natasha growled, pawing at the top of Tony’s head as he passed underneath her spot on the couch.
The first thing they did was feed the cats.The fun was starting to wear off into grumpy Hangriness, which was a term they all learned from Tony. Nobody was keen on letting all the Avengers go hungry for too long- especially Thor. Coulson poured out their food into bowls while Hill took off their jackets, and Peter fidgeted anxiously next to the kitchen island.
But his end never came. Instead, Tony cracked open an eye to see Spider-Man standing over him, the bot stuck to a wall in what looked like a huge spider web.
“Anthony-” One of the cats huffed, momentarily cutting off as the air was knocked out of him. “-for the love of Asgard, get. This. Hack. Off. Me!” Loki growled in between blows, scratching and kicking for all he was worth as he got his ass handed to him by a heftier tabby cat of unknown origin. Tony almost laughed out loud, sitting down and watching the scuffle with amusement.
“What’s wrong?” She continued to stroke the top of his head, but Tony’s joy at seeing her crept away, and he despaired a bit at the fact that not even Pepper could lift his spirits. They had broken up after New York, but she was still his rock, his best friend. The last person in New York who actually liked Tony. It all felt so
Once again, as soon as Tony passed into the town, the wind dropped and it was absolute quiet. Nothing moved. The trees looked frozen in place, not a speck of disturbed snow in sight. The even blanket of white had a slight glow in the glare of the full moon and it was almost serene, if not for the feeling that he wasn’t supposed to be there. Like something was waiting, slumbering underneath the cobblestone streets and waiting for him to get too close. His fur was standing on end again.
“No! That’s not my point!” Steve shouted, throwing his hands up, and dropping his own helmet in the process.
Spider-kid visibly gulped, definitely more nervous now that the government officials had arrived. Tony gave a soft growl at Fury to dissuade any interrogating.
As soon as Tony could get in a breath he gasped, rolling onto his stomach, leaving smears of blood behind as his chest heaved and his head cleared. Steve and Thor were scouring the lab for any other signs of Loki, while Natasha had vanished, and Bruce nudged Clint out of the way to resume the prodding himself.
“Is this enough paper?” Steve called, holding a few tubes of red paint in one hand and a giant roll of paper in the other. Tony nodded and bounced impatiently, itching to finally tell them that they had an impostor in their midst. Steve shot him a glare as he rolled the paper on the ground and squirted a liberal amount of paint in the corner, then gestured as if to say, ‘go ahead’.
“Let us rejoin them and hatch a new plan of action.” Thor said, taking off towards the rest of their group and leaving them to scramble after him.
“It was from a day or two ago; he jumped off of something and landed wrong. It wasn’t too bad.” Bruce said, arms crossed as he watched Hannah unwrap the ace bandages. As soon as she picked up his foot pain blossomed all the way to the knee and Tony yelped, jerking it out of her hands.
“Steve, please calm yourself.” His voice was a deep rumble, and when Steve actually pushed down the fear that was trying to choke him, he recognized the tone and the odd way he structured his sentences.
“We tried talking to that new cat.” Peter added around a mouthful of food, not looking up from where he was making notes and munching down on some bagel bites. “I guess she didn’t say anything, but it doesn’t hurt to keep trying.” He said, this time through what had to be at least two bagel bites and possibly a third. Tony wrinkled his nose and redirected his attention to Pepper, who was much more pleasant to hold a conversation with.
“Doesn’t he understand- that as part of a team- he needs to communicate better?” Steve said in between punches, steadying himself and the bag before he continued. “In order to work as a team, we need to trust each other, and if I can’t trust him to be honest about
The scaffolding was creaking and he watched with his own two eyes as the few that had reached him started
“What? What is that?” He asked, looking at Harley while he pointed at the dormant machine. The nurse turned and smiled from where he was checking the readings on the monitors.
“Straighten your leg out as much as you can.” She said, and they waited as Tony carefully extended his foot, cautious about hurting it any further. She took the x-ray and then removed the jacket for the final two of his chest. The three of them ended up in the other room as they waited for Hannah to fetch the results.
Nobody dared argue. Bruce caved to Tony’s puppy-dog eyes (or maybe was still feeling sorry for him), and occasionally slipped him pieces of cheese and pepperoni when Steve wasn’t looking.
Tony rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself into a sitting position, waiting for the light-headedness and nausea to pass. Steve reached into a duffel by his feet and pulled out a tupperware container full of food and smiled.
“Sorry Vivian, I’m not gonna let you walk all over my stuff. I’ve already had several of these keys replaced.” He wheeled back from his desk and picked up Tony into his arms, scratching behind the cat’s ears. Damn, that was nice. What had he been doing? It probably wasn’t as important as this. He began to purr like a motorboat, and Peter chuckled.
“It’ll be quicker if you duck and let me scrub out the soap, instead of using the cup.” Steve said, pausing when Tony didn’t immediately react.
“Can I carry you, shchenok?” Natasha asked, bending down to his level. Tony could most definitely walk himself, but he’d gotten to the point where he didn’t even mind being carted around. So Tony nodded and allowed himself to be scooped up and carried down off the roof and through the mansion to the miraculously untouched briefing room. Since the backup generators were still off, the elevators wouldn’t work. Tony hoped that the food in the fridge wasn’t warm yet- but he likely wouldn’t need to worry, since without heating, the building’s temperature was slowly dropping. The random holes in the walls and windows didn’t help either.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, his voice right behind Tony’s head. Tony let out an involuntary murrp and laid fully on his back, sighing out all his remaining energy and finally relaxing a bit. Steve sat down and took over the grooming, occasionally spitting out tufts of cream fur that had been torn loose in the commotion.
“The coding runs impeccably, as it was assumed to.” JARVIS informed. “Mr. Parker also requested to be notified when you were finished working, and will be down momentarily.”
“Two agents being deployed to coordinates, comms active.” The pilot- agent- who had grabbed a gun slammed the button to open the doors, taking off at a brisk run with Tony right on her heels. The other pilot was probably required to stay with the jet in case of hostiles or anyone needing medical attention.
The others slowly started up a new conversation, and Tony was buzzing with the energy to talk and interact, but he paused and thought about it. Clint wasn’t kidding when he said he hadn’t missed Tony’s constant talking. The others probably felt the same.
Tony took the time to maneuver his head back out, and once he was free he climbed back down and took off at a sprint down the hallway. His body still ached from the roughing up he got courtesy of the goons, but adrenaline drowned out the pain. If he messed up and dropped it, the results would be catastrophic.
“Natasha, can you start us off by pulling up all the information you guys gathered during the fight?” Steve amended. She nodded and rose to her feet, scrounging a few Stark tablets out of a cupboard and laying them strategically on the powered-down holo-table. Tony perked his ears and looked over at Steve, who narrowed his eyes back as if to say,
Tony choked on his panic for a few seconds and tried to rein himself in. He was quite suddenly nearsighted- extremely nearsighted. Tony could only see for twenty feet or so before everything was just a blur of movement and gray. The gray was what truly freaked him out; everything was dull, unsaturated, and it was like he was in a whole different world. Tony could still see the green of the dumpster he was next to, and the silver cans, but the rest was strange. The bricks that made up the walls on either side of the alley were a mossy-yellow color. The more he looked around, the more he felt his heart pounding. Tony’s armor was completely disassembled and scattered around him. It was green and yellow. He tried to stand up, and promptly flopped back down.
It was dark, and cold, and once again Tony was forced to stare at the wormhole and re-live his near death, shaking and curled in on himself in the corner so soon after the night before.
Then a few things seemed to happen at once; Tony looked over at Thor, who was spinning his hammer and waiting for a signal. As soon as Tony raised an arm that meant ‘go nuts’, Thor let loose on the group of bugs, and one jumped up in the time that Tony had looked away, grabbing onto both his boots and dragging him down into the water.
“I’m in! Petey, prepare to have your mind blown.” Tony crowed. Clint made a comment under his breath, but it was too quiet for Tony to hear.
“Okay, so Loki turned us into… cats. Where are Bruce and Tony?” She looked over at Clint, but he shrugged.
Tony put the bowl back and went to find Bruce, who was holed up in his lab. The motion-sensing doors opened for Tony and Bruce looked up, a little frown on his face.
“I don’t think you should be in here, Tony. I have a lot of chemicals sitting around.” He got up and basically shooed Tony out, giving him an apologetic smile. “Sorry. I’ll come hang out with you later, when I don’t have any time-sensitive experiments. Alright?” With that he went back into his lab, and Tony watched through the glass as he typed in his code to lock the doors.
The quinjet touched down after a five-hour flight and they all stretched, though they still had hours before night fell. They at least had plenty of time to prepare.
What was big enough? Tony wasn’t able to do much as a dog. At least nothing obvious like a banner that read ‘I am Tony Stark, stop throwing things at me’. He wouldn’t have enough time to get all the way up to the front door, let alone spell in the dirt. Tony
“If you wanted to run a lap or two around the park, I can hang out here.” Tony said, pointing with his nose to the bench. Steve smiled and shook his head.
“We need to wait for Natasha to get out of surgery, and it makes us feel better if we’re keeping an eye on you. So two birds and a stone and all that.” He said, quieting as he focused on what he was doing on his phone. Tony would have bet money he was playing that stupid Stack game again.
“No, everything’s alright. Thank you for helping… the dog. I would like it if you came with us to participate in the debrief later, but you’re not being held at all, and you’re free to go if that’s what you wish.” She reassured, and slowly Spider-Man’s hands lowered to his lap.
“I can? Do I have my own access, or do you need to be in there with me at the same time? JARVIS needs to be up and running again, the mansion has literally been defenseless since Loki shut him down.” Tony said, pacing circles around Bruce, whose eyes went wide.
Hey guys! Welcome back to the time line where Tony continues to suffer. Wait, what do you mean, that's just canon?
“Clint, what are you doing? What implants?” Clint watched his face as he talked, then shook his head.
when you need to do something or go against orders. I understand that you’ll see someone in danger, or you’ll realize the solution and need someone to cover while you do what it is that you need to do.
The lights came on dim, just enough to illuminate Clint’s face as he walked back to the bed and patted Tony on the back.
” Tony barked out a laugh, wrapping his tail around his feet while Natasha jumped up onto the table next to him.
He was about to formulate an escape plan when a nurse came in and beamed at the two of them, Steve basically pinning a squirming Tony down on the table.
Tony was a big boy, though. He didn’t need to make Steve chase him all over the house again. So when Steve shut off the water and put Tony in the tub, he stood stock-still and tried not to flinch every time Steve poured a cup of water over his back. The water just barely reached his belly and he shivered, taking intentionally deep breaths to keep from panicking.
Hey all!! This marks the point where Mr. Parker joins the fray. I always imagine and characterize Spider-man as the Tom Holland version, but I don't think it'll change much if you preferred him to be Garfield or McGuire, besides that May (if she makes an appearance) will be characterized and aged as the Marisa version of May. Okay, without further rambling, please enjoy the chapter!
they decided it was dark enough for Tony leave and get the readings. The town was abandoned anyways, so Tony was really restless and irritated about being forced to wait so long.
“What do you want?” Tony growled, careful to keep his voice low. He had no idea what they would do to him if anyone else was alerted. His mind was racing to come up with a solution to his predicament, but all he could think to do was wait and hope they didn’t intend to murder him where he lay.
His internal pity-party was interrupted by the elevator doors opening to deposit their resident teenager, who walked nervously up to Tony, wringing his hands a bit. His mouth opened to speak just as Tony scrambled to his feet and jumped right into the kid’s chest.
“Wow, are you a military doggy? That was cool!” The guy- no, kid- pulled off his mask, panting as he got fresh air. Tony figured the shitty mask smelled like sweat- but that wasn’t an important thought, because he was suddenly struck by how
“Alright, I’ll come help you with the jacket. I only want two of the foot so this is the last one.” Hannah disappeared from view and there was a pause before she came in through the door, taking off the lead jacket so that Tony could roll on his back. She put it back on and made sure it wouldn’t fall off before she left and went back to the control panel.
As Tony passed the first building the wind suddenly dropped and there was only silence. A breeze still stirred the trees behind him and it was almost as if Tocco Caudio was in its own bubble. It made his skin crawl but he stopped and made himself focus as he crept down streets, footfalls light and quick as he made good time getting to the building.
“Hello? Peter?” Tony yowled, leaping across ceiling beams towards the source of the smell. There was a small intake of air from Steve, who bounded forward and started sniffing around a wrinkled hand that was extended from underneath a sheet of drywall. “Oh.” Tony whispered, placing his paw on it and sighing in relief when there was a faint thrumming underneath his foot.
“Have a nice day.” The cashier gave them a face that looked like she was aiming for smile but landed somewhere around a grimace. Tony did not envy the brave souls who worked retail. Not one bit.
Tony heard Clint trudging along behind him and he stepped up the pace a little, nearing the edge of the trees by the time Clint spoke up on his comms.
“I’m serious. Loki is the one that fucked you over- he made you think you wanted to help him. That wasn’t you. It was never you, it was his scepter, he turned you into a pawn and that was
Tony’s nose burned too much to smell who was cradling him, but the arm under his head looked like Steve’s, decked out in red, white, and blue. They stood back and watched as Natasha was strapped to the gurney and lifted into a quinjet to be taken back to SHIELD medical.
“Alright! We’re done with that. Let’s get some sleep, and in the morning we'll go meet up with the others and try talking to the batshit-insane gods in the basement.” Tony said, leading the way to the elevator as Peter hurried along behind him.
Tony didn’t feel cool stone under him as he ran but it didn’t matter- he just needed to get out, to find sunlight and Rhodey-
“Please, don’t start. At least wait for us all to get back to the mansion, I’m too tired to argue.” Tony muttered, using Thor to haul himself to his feet. The armor somewhat compensated for his unsteady legs and he picked up the helmet, slipping it back on his head and reading the HUD as his vitals started popping up.
She went straight for his bathroom again. “If you’re going to act like a child, you’ll get a timeout like a child.” She hissed, dropping him in the room and leaving before he could dart out past her legs.
“Would you like to be the Avengers’ temporary handler?” The cats all balked at him, and Peter started to stutter a bit.
They stared at each other for almost a minute before Clint heaved a sigh and gave up. He instead staked out a position by the stove and didn’t bother leaving again, occasionally shooting Tony glances as he instead played a game on his phone.
“Would you want us to brush your teeth? You can’t do it yourself, it’s not really fair to make you deal with that if you don’t want to.” Tony nodded and Bruce scratched him behind the ears, pulling him into a hug.
Natasha and Clint were waiting at the door to let them in, and nobody spoke as they brushed themselves off and wiped their feet.
“-and he’s not even…. What the fuck?” The footsteps stopped and Tony’s heart sunk; the stuffing. He’d just been so mad, and he had so much energy now, he was just- “STARK!” Natasha yelled, and Tony yelped, scrambling off the couch as feet started pounding after him and doors slammed open. Steve’s voice penetrated the haze of
“Yes, he’s alright.” Natasha didn’t provide any more clarification, instead setting Tony in his normal chair on Steve’s right. Natasha always sat on Cap’s left, with Clint on her other side and Thor across from them next to Bruce, who sat next to Tony. Spider-Man was unaware of any seating arrangements and had sat in Clint’s spot. Tony hoped the archer wouldn’t be a dick about that when he got back from sandwich-making.
They had to go around the fighting and they could hear the screaming, the screeching metal and the rumbling through the ground as the Avengers fought. They had no idea where the robots had come from, though they did seem like mediocre skeleton versions of the Iron Man armor. It was possible Tony was just over-reacting; but maybe he needed to force his way into his lab to fix JARVIS, since he was the only program with access to the specs. These were likely pilfered right from his servers.
“We can’t just sit here!” Tony insisted, mind reeling as he tried to remember where he’d left his phone. Steve jumped onto the counter and dropped back down next to Tony, setting it next to his feet. Tony wasted no time in texting Agent, who responded shortly and to the point.
“I’m appalled, Steve. I can’t believe you’d think I’d sink to such lows. Pussy is another word for cat and nothing more.” Tony pretended to look serious, but as soon as Steve cracked up laughing his own composure broke and they both spent the rest of the walk to medical in a fit of giggles.
