“I’ll behave if Papa does.”
“My Gregory.” Mycroft managed to eek out, feeling his own tears roll down his cheeks.
“Let me finish please. I’ve held this in for so long.” John sighed, then gave his Alpha’s hand a squeeze. “I saw all these babies coming in from other GIs … Coworkers of mine, people who knew our secret. It was the worst kept secret on the base. Everyone knew I was Mr. James Sholto in all but name, and here’s the fucked up thing, ‘Lock, I kept telling myself that my time was coming. That something would change. It was nothing but magical thinking.” John shook his head, reflecting on the years spent with James.
“‘Lock, we can’t. There’s-”
“Sherlock Holmes.” Sherlock glanced over Moran, but ignored his outstretched hand.
The image on the screen clicked and whirred telling him that his therapist was ready for him. John sighed, and ran his fingers through his hair making a mental note to trim his hair.
“You’re right, it doesn’t, but this grief you’re experiencing isn’t just Mary’s death.”
Suddenly the slam of the bedroom door, and a shout of “Daddy! Papa’s attacking me with flour!” interrupted John’s train of thought.
“Don’t ever make that voice again. I’ll never want to kiss you, again.”
“This really hurts…” ‘Lock held out his palm. “Why didn’t you say something?”
Sherlock stared at the cool hand resting on his arm. He could feel the chill through the two layers of shirts. “Why are you so cold?”
“Graham’s never going to willingly leave his job,” Sherlock scoffed, handing Mycroft a cup of coffee.
John cleared his throat in an attempt to stave off a fight. “Does that machine tell you anything about Hurricane Sadie?”
John laughed, and pulled his daughter into a hug. “Good thing, I already spoke to Auntie Molly and Uncle Greg about taking you. They have a room starting tonight, and-”
“John,” Sherlock said, touching his arm gently. “Thank you so much for bringing my nieces safely into this world. It means more to us than I can say.”
“Did you really date Sholto?” Sherlock’s tone was curious.
“I do know that!” ‘Lock insisted, taking a deep breath. “I’ve been a bottom before.”
“Oh, piss off Ella. You think you’re so smart. You’re not. You went to-”
“Were you really trying to break in somewhere?”
“You already know she’s deceased.”
That night as Greg laid curled into Mycroft’s arms, “Who will love Sherlock?” came floating to the front of his mind.
“Ah, yes, my girl.”
“Your up-tight, my-way-or-the-highway attitude
John thought.
Sherlock regarded him with veiled amusement. “I believe John has asked for tea.”
Mycroft eased his phone off the top of the table next to him. Greg shifted a bit, but didn’t complain. Quickly he shot off the following two texts:
“Not since I was born!” Rosie reminded them in a ‘don’t be stupid’ tone.
“Holmes’ don’t get them.” ‘Lock said, matter-of-factly. “And it’s on the wrong hand.”
“Oh, I agree. My husband is trying to get a security deal, but the Board is being complete dicks.”
“Congratulations, Mr. Holmes. You have three healthy, perfect daughters.”  John scooped up one of the babies, and placed her in Greg’s arms. Greg was crying, staring at his daughter.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and said sarcastically,  “Oh no! Gasp! My big brother sleeps naked with his pregnant husband!”
“That’s because you shake, Ma,” John said dismissively. “I can see that rehab worked well for you.”
techinally the story is over, but I Want to write some happy moments so, that'll be the prologue...
“Major Sholto has been granted the right to marry you by the Queen herself.”
“But not the person who mattered the most to me,” John said, evenly. Rosie held her arms out to Sherlock. “No, acushla.”
John pulled away, and panted breathlessly for a moment. Sherlock’s lips curled up into a smile, and he ruffled his own curls. “Can you try to be less angry if I promise to talk about my feelings?”
Slowly Sherlock eased him down into the waiting wheelchair. “See you soon... Brother mine.”
“What were you doing that you were dehydrated?” Mycroft asked, pointedly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because I wrote these books,” Sherlock replied simply. “JF has a wife, three children including his heir to the park, Ritchie, and both parents live-”
“Why don’t you shower when we get up there, and then I will. After that, we’ll lay down on the bed and do some skin to skin.”  ‘Lock ran his hands down John’s back causing the older man to shiver a bit.
Rosie rolled her eyes, and looked at Sherlock. “Don’t burn the apartment down. Hudders won’t forgive you for that!”
“Oh, Sherlock! You’re still here.”
John laughed, then placed a chaste kiss on ‘Lock’s lips. “It’s naturally assumed that Omegas are bottoms, ‘Lock. How do you think we get pregnant?”
"Why do you feel so secure about that?"
John laughed, and grabbed the biscuits and his coffee before he walked over to the table. He slid into the seat and opened the laptop. John took a sip of coffee, then logged onto the laptop. John grinned to himself as he ran his fingers over the biscuits. John quickly lost himself in his e-mail, but continued to protect the sleeve of biscuits.
“The Science of Deduction,” John stated, trying to sound posher than he was.
“Dada!”
The man’s smile stretched from cheek to cheek. “I’m clever.”
“Widowed and a father,” John said, evenly firmly ignoring the description of sexuality.
“What side is that?”
“My house burned dow-”
“When I asked you today, ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’ You seemed surprised. Even after reading my website. You should have expected it.”
John sighed quietly, and thought What if it were Rosie? He shook his head, and scribbled aimlessly on his notepad.
“It’s so hard to be you, Sherlock Holmes.” John stumbled over to the counter to poke at the coffee pot.
For just a moment, John looked at Greg with his first daughter, and saw his own stillborn daughter. He saw her wispy blonde hair, the too-thin eyelids that never opened, and her sweet little fists.
“Of course it does. You know what Avia told me on our Bonding Day?”
“She was stuck in Fantasticland during Hurricane Sadie. So, I’m sure she’s dead, but no one can tell me how. I just-”
“Are you ready to be an uncle?”
Sherlock laughed loudly. “I’m not worried about bullshit. I was raised with Mycroft Holmes-”
“I need help…” Sherlock said, switching Rosie from one arm to the next.  “Consulting, I mean. I have a bored landlady. She’ll love your daughter.”
“Oh, it’s just dirt.” ‘Lock pulled his hand away.
“Oh, that’s a relief,” John agreed, pushing his plate to Sherlock. “I want dessert, and more wine.” Sherlock poured more wine into John’s glass, before John was swallowing it down. “This is lovely.”
“Uncle Greg, Papa!”
An elderly lady wearing a smart suit opened the door. “Oh, Sherlock!”” she called excitedly, turning away from John. “Your Omega is here!” She turned back to John, and smiled politely. “Come in, come in. he’s upstairs in B. up those stairs just there.”  She stepped out of his way, and shut the door firmly behind John. A gentle hand touched his shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know I do, but I don’t know how to work it,” John admitted peevishly. “Besides, you’re the work horse on this team. I’ve spent decades trailing after your father-”
“Shall we grab a snack?”
“So the truth is, you’re not broken. You’re healing, and healing hurts like a bitch. The wound is there, but it’s like the skin healed over the wound that just grew down and out. Now you have to rip off healthy skin and get rid of the bad tissue before you can heal again.”
John glanced at Sherlock, shook his head, “let’s do this before I change my mind.”
“Holmes here.” He heard his husband say for the first time in 3 months. Greg cleared his throat, trying to push the emotions he was feeling away, but failed.
John stared at the retreating figure, and made a decision in an instant. He ran out of the flat, and down the stairs. His heart racing. He threw the door open, and paused to find his target, “Hey! If you’re going to retrieve him, I’m coming with you.”
“I have experiments everywhere.”
Rosie laughed heartily. “I’d rather carry on Papa’s work and smoke a bowl or two.”
“You’re wrong, ‘Lock. You’ll see.” John said, confidently.
John grinned widely at this man next to him. “You always surprise me.”
“So you’ve said. How can you verify it?”
John lowered himself to the floor, and held his arms open for her to run into them. “I missed you too!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock smirked before he pulled John into another kiss. “Obviously.”
“No problem. We care so much for our Omegas in Bangladesh.”
Abby tsked, “Is breá liom tú.”
Greg slid himself off Mycroft’s lap with a thud, then looked at him with worry clearly written on his face, “What about Sherlock? Who’s going to take care of him?” Greg started crying again, and Mycroft pulled his husband’s head to his chest.
“Oh please, Captain Watson. You don’t need anyone by your side to do this. You know how to do this in your sleep, all the procedures we did together--”
“Hello, my princess. Don’t you look lovely in your new dress?”
“Oh my innocent lad, you have no idea how much I owe you,” Mycroft smiled. “Brother mine, now that you are married, you are no longer mine to babysit. Good luck, Dr. John Watson.”
“What kind of experiments?” John continued to eat, ploughing his way through a small mountain of cafeteria food. He waved Moran over to them.
“A medicine man?” Sherlock asked, eyeing John as he ate.
“I don’t have to stay,” the man was saying, as he walked into the room. “I’d love to make you breakfast. I make killer pancakes-”
“Mr. Holmes,” Moran said, with a grin. “I’m going to take Dr. Watson and show him our operating theatre. Dr. Watson, if you would follow me.”
“No, Myc.
“So do I, but you and I have to handle ourselves first. Someone will come into Sherlock’s life and just light it up.”
John rolled his eyes before he dialed MH’s private number. The line rang through until John heard a slight hum and a loud exhale. “There’s a black sedan on the way for you. I need you here, now.”
“Dr. Watson?” a staff member called, coming into his office.
Sherlock stood up, and helped Greg to his feet. “Good luck, brother mine.”
“So you’ve decided to make it up to Daddy for shouting?”
“My dear lad, call me if you need anything. Money, housing, a car.”
to ask Mrs. Hudson to make you tea?” John kicked one of his trainers off, and then the other. He picked one up and stumped off to the kitchen. He grabbed a beer from the fridge and came back. He flopped down on his chair and put his trainer on the arm. He popped the beer open, and took a deep draught.
‘Lock nodded, and held the Omega close. “I would love to take you out of country and spoil you.”
John popped the lid off the soup and stirred it. John let the odor waft over to the sleeping man. ‘Lock rolled back towards John, and pushed his eyes open. “Did you say soup?”
“I’m too angry to do anything,” John said instantly. Regretting the moments the words were out of his mouth. “I don’t have an anger problem though.”
“Yes, love. Sit up for me.” John stirred the soup again, and watched ‘Lock sit up. John brought a spoonful of soup to his fiancee's mouth. ‘Lock slurped it down. He took the soup out of John’s hands and drank the bowl of soup.
“What if Papa packed Staph instead?” John asked, in a teasing manner. He finished his tea, and handed the empty cup to Sherlock. Sherlock put it up on the desk.
“Sherlock,” Greg said, gentle, waiting for Sherlock to lazily turn towards him. Finally Sherlock made eye contact with Greg. “There is
Sherlock sighed loudly, and reached over to take John’s hand again. “You kissed me upstairs without a concern, and now it’s been long enough that you doubt yourself. You aren’t sure you really want to be visibly seen holding my hand because someone will think you’re gay. Part of you wants to say ‘fuck this, I want to be happy,’ but another part of you wants to protect me,” Sherlock paused a moment. “Oh, that surprised me. What do you want to protect me from?”
. We’re here,”  Sherlock said, glancing out the window.
Some more about Sherlock’s soul mark and a love confession from John.
“John!” a shout came from outside the bathroom, then arms wrapped around him. “Hey! It’s Sherlock. It’s me.” John forced his eyes open, and glanced into the mirror. Concerned eyes, a handsome scarless face, and no beret look back at him. “What happened?”
“Oh, you stop it. You know that I could arrange it so it looked like an accidental thing, but it was really on purpose.”
A knock on the window of the car interrupted to the two men. “Welcome to the William Vale,” the driver announced as she opened the door.
“Hey, Sid, what’s up?” John asked, putting on his kind doctorly smile.
“Married couples are always scent-bonded.”
“Do you?” ‘Lock grinned, then kissed John’s hand.
“Yes, I am.”  Greg confirmed. “I was in the local ER for a concussion, and they ran a pregnancy test.”
A buzzing in John’s pocket told him his ride was waiting for him. He walked over to the funeral director. “I’d like to settle the bill.”
“I work weird hours, or I don’t work for weeks on on end,” John admitted, with a shrug.
“I’m going to be honest with you, I’ll agree, but never follow through.”
“I am not, but you are and you should be wary.”
“You must enunciate, acushla,” John instructed, picking up a biscuit. “Would you like a biscuit?” Rosie slid off the chair, and giggled out a “oop!” before she ran over to her dad with her hand out.  “Manners!”
“American, obviously, Papa. If it had been an English girl, he never would have started the way he did.”
“In fact, Watson, weren’t you engaged to Sholto? What happened with that?”
“Watson!” the short Irish man cried happily. He embraced his friend, and pulled back. “So you’re the idiot American doctor I’m working with.”
“Consulting detective.”
“Mama, mama, mama!”
“I just want him happy.”
Rosie put both her hands on either side of John’s face and pressed them together. “I’m going to be a melittologist, I need to see all the bees I can, Daddy.” Rosie removed her hands from John’s cheeks, and kissed his forehead. “‘Sides, Daddy. Uncle Greg is going and he loves Auntie Mol and I.”
John nodded his approval.
“I was an idiot.”
“Balderdash!” John cried, not containing his laughter.
John sighed, and ran his fingers through his hair. “Rosie, stop whining. Sherlock, get off your arse and do it unless you want to call a client-”
“You feel just as guilty about the embassy bombing as I do. You hand picked me for the mission and it ended both my marriage and my career.”  John said, pointedly, clenching and unclenching his fists. “If we’re going to do this, Sherlock, it’s going to be a proper marriage. We’re going to talk about things and work as a team. I’m going to expect you to pick up your socks.”
“He’s the first Omega that didn’t take my bullshit and really respected me in the O.R.”
“I had some spicy noodles.”
“Thank you, Dr. Watson, for doing this for my family. I’m sure Myc won’t ever thank you.”
After a moment’s thought, he dialed the number and strummed his fingers on the desktop. The line rang a few times before it was answered. “Good afternoon. This is John Watson and I’m calling to speak to-”
Angelo returned with the candle, and placed it down between them. It was already lit, so he took John’s food order. John stared at his spouse, and before he took a sip of water. Hesitantly he stated, “Afghanistan.”
“Oh, no, but there’s a bakery only five minutes from our flat.”
Bí curamach = Be safe
John shook his head, but couldn’t stop the grin that came upon his face. “You are your papa’s spawn through and through.”
“We weren’t kids in Germany. We weren’t kids in Uni. We weren’t fucking kids when you married my sister… My sister, Johnny. What a fucking power move that was,” the man laughed, the scars on his face crinkled more. John squeezed his eyes shut, leaning hard against the sink unable to move or break free, waiting for the touch to come.
“Sorry about earlier, mate. Handsome fella you got out there. The posh one.” Moran said in hushed tones just for John.
“He-” ‘Lock started, then shook his head. “He proposed to me and made it a terrible evening. I know that you don’t intend to rape me, or force me-”  ‘Lock bit his lip. “I love you, John. I love you in a way that I never loved Victor. You never once… I just- I’m trying. To love you my best. And I’m not very good at it.”
The husbands sat at the table, as Angelo waddled off.  “That’s not necessary,” John started to say, but stopped himself.
Rosie groaned loudly, and shook her head. “Just Syph.”
The man on the other line choked back a sob and cleared his throat. “If it was your daughter, wouldn’t you want to know?”
“You’re insane,” Sherlock said, with a laugh.
“Jesus, we gotta pack.”
“Stop thinking so loudly,” Sherlock said, as he shut the door on the cab. The driver pulled away from the curb and Sherlock sighed. “Please don’t make another decision for me.”
“Myc, I’m pregnant.” Greg said, as the tears fell from his eyes. “It must-”
Rosie stood up, and walked over to her Daddy’s armchair. She kneeled down, and smiled kindly at him. “Daddy, Papa is right about you. You’re too tender-hearted.”
“Of course you did. You’ve been over there pressing all the buttons and- John. Are you going to focus on this application forever?”
“The emotional range of a teaspoon.” Sherlock grinned, remembering the line from a movie they had watched together.  Sherlock glanced at Greg carefully, just in time to catch Greg grinning widely at him.
“Rosie, you must store things in your mind attic like your Uncle Myc and I do.”
John nodded his head, and brushed at tears. “You are correct, my darling.”
“Yes, I am. I want this job. I did a lot of research-”
“I would if I had too.” John threatened, then went back to fumbling with his phone.
“I love skin to skin,” John murmured, as he wrapped his arms around his Alpha’s waist. John buried his nose in the crook of ‘Lock’s neck and breathed deeply. Scent of sweat, the earth, and tobacco. “When did you have tobacco? You always smell like it, but you never seem to have it.”
“Just pack the bare essentials. They have stores in America.”
Sherlock glanced at his brother, and nodded. He smoothly stood up and fell in step behind the doctor and the nurse. “Thank you for saving me from my brother. He’s a right git when he wants to be.”
“I’ve never been here before,” John admitted, slipping his other hand into the crook of ‘Lock’s elbow.
will let this obsession with Sherlock’s future go-”
“I’m not really sure that’s me, but I’m going to do my best,” John said, as he turned to go upstairs.
“The babies will be born. You’re going to disappear back into the ether.”
“It’s a great space.”
Dr. Rami nodded, and set to work as John removed his sterile gear placing it in red bin. He washed his hands again, and dried them before he came back to the babies. He stood between Greg’s prone figure and the cot.
“Ah. That sounds like Myc.”  ‘Lock nodded, then pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. Quickly he shot off a text to his brother.
téigh go dtí do sheomra  = go to your room
“I’m not in my mind palace.” Mycroft laughed, pressing his lips to Greg’s neck. “I was thinking about how your arse always seems to find my cock when we’re snuggling.”
“Canterbury!” John exclaimed as if he had no idea about this. “That’s so far away from here.”
“Congratulations Alpha and Omega. You are now registered as one family. Go forth and repopulate this Earth.” The marriage podium whirred off, and the lights in the room lit the exit path.
‘Lock’s cheeks flushed red. “Sex, of course.”
‘Lock yawned, and handed the empty soup bowl back to John. “Why don’t we go out to the couch?”
Sherlock blinked at John, and shook his head. “No, I insured his death.”
“John, please email the client with our enhanced COVID fees, and remind him that payment is due sooner rather than later,” Sherlock said in a brisk voice. “Also, there may be-”
“Yeah, I feel the love.” Greg said sarcastically. They reached the office, and Greg stepped in the room taking a deep calming breathe. He picked up the landline, and dialed Mycroft’s emergency number.
dun dun duuuuuuuun!
“I’m going to head out, John. I had an amazing evening with you.”
“It’s just Myc,” ‘Lock grumbled. “When he puts his mind to something, he comes through. He probably waited until the sun was up to send it to you.”
“Of course I don’t,” John said forcefully. “My wife isn’t even cold yet and he’s fucking-” John cut himself off, and wiped more tears away. “Jesus fucking christ, Mycroft. What can I do?”
‘Lock stared at their joined hands while he thought about what John asked. Absentmindedly he flexed his right hand. “Don’t give up on me?” he finally asked.
“Lost husband. Need to send :  Xanax 0.5mg TID #30 0 refill. Son is helping with her medical needs. Needs psych referral. Check narc database.”
“Prove it,” John looked at his husband, smiling. Angelo returned with John’s meal, and placed it in front of him.  John dug in. After a few minutes of silence, John glanced up to see Sherlock study him.
John glanced away, then back again. He couldn’t hold back his giggles any longer. “So this thing we’re brewing-”
“You’re correct, but your brother sent over fifty-seven pages of information on the company.”  John stood up from the laptop and stretched.
“Any of them up to your standards?”
“I’m a doctor.”
“Make sure there’s room for me in that place. This old house is getting too much for me.”
“I can’t imagine anyone would. You’re quite an imposing figure.”
John set to work, increasing the medication as necessary, before he carefully cut down Greg’s abdomen. Slowly and carefully, he freed each child. Dr. Rami spent time cleaning and caring for them as they came out and laid them in their cot.
Sherlock quickly unlocked  John’s phone and texted himself the photos. He hurried to catch up with John. He opened the door to the washroom. “I never met a soldier who took such an unnecessary risk before. What kind of madman leaves his phone with an absolute stranger?” he teased, jovially. He held up John’s phone before he tucked it into his pocket. “If you don’t have your phone, how can you respond to the text message I sent you?”
“You’re an arse, ‘Lock.”
“We’re not married, yet.”
“Something to discuss, I guess,” John agreed, following Sherlock into the building. Sherlock walked over to a table, and flung himself into a seat. John rolled his eyes, but pulled his own chair out. He sat down in the chair, and studied his dining companion.
“So meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but super important to a few folx?”
John watched the kettle boil, but didn’t say anything and he listened to his daughter in the other room. He felt Abby leave his side, and knew she was watching Rosie.
“And they were granted?” John asked, running his fingers over the edge of the menu.
“Oh, go tell Hudders anything you want. You are her favorite. She will believe you.”
“I’m fucked up too,” John defended himself, letting go of ‘Lock’s chin. “Let’s talk about James. We spent three years playing house. I lived in his suite on the base. I made sure he had clean uniforms and that he always ate. I made sure he took his meds.” John exhaled loudly, moving his hands to fiddle with the seat belt. “I took his knot and spent hours hoping against hope that I was pregnant. I never was, and thankfully, now I know it was for the best. I spent years thinking, ‘maybe today’s the day he’s going to leave his wife for me.’ years. It fucks with your mind, ‘Lock-”
“Sherlock!” John chided, with a shake of his head. “Your Papa is so naughty.”
“Oh, yeah,” Sherlock said, pulling the door open. “Hi.”
John exhaled a bit before he continued, “Thank you for coming into my life.”  ‘Lock snuffled in his sleep. “The engagement ring on my finger is fantastic, but the best bit is that blob on your hand that you hate. It’s going to be something. It’s going to be a part of us. I think it’s the beginning of us.” John pressed his Soul Mark against ‘Lock’s bare chest. “I’m not like you, ‘Lock, I’m not well-spoken like you are, but this is everything.”  John nodded against his Alpha. “Thank you for loving me.”
Greg stared at his husband with tears overflowing. “Please, Myc-” He asked, then threw himself into his husband’s arms, crying.
was happening and John just need compliance.
“Grief doesn’t have an expiration date,” John reminded her stubbornly.
John rolled his eyes as he managed to start the machine. “Next time it’s time for coffee, you make it.” John chewed his lip as he waited for the coffee pot to brew.
“Why haven’t you mentioned him? Why wasn’t he at the funeral?”
“Yes, he’s investigating something in the lobby. I ran ahead because I missed you, Daddy.”
John cut his own thoughts off with a sigh, “Fancy a cuppa?” he turned to the stove and started making tea. Abby came over to the stove, and placed her calming hands on John’s busy ones.
“Thank you, Sherlock.”
“You are giving my brains away for free!”
John touched Sherlock’s arm causing him to stop walking. “Are you serious? We just met.”
Sherlock smirked, and ruffled his own curls, but didn’t answer the question. John slipped his hand from Sherlock and crawled into the cab that pulled up. John turned his face towards the window, and turned to his thoughts.
John entered dressed in dark scrubs, wringing his hands together. “Hello, Greg!” He grinned widely. “So we’re just waiting on the rest of the team. Your husband is currently mortgaging your house as we speak to pay for this. So I hope you enjoy being homeless.”
“Nan!”
Sherlock shrugged and flipped his collar up. “Victor’s Mummy and Daddy stopped by the other day.”
John exhaled loudly, struggling to hold tears back. He fiddled with his military ring-
“I’m sorry, John. He really is a good man, but he gets so wrapped up in his family’s old school manners and who he thinks he should be.”
“Me too.” The Alpha murmured sleepily, “I missed you so much, Gregory. I drove ‘Lock nuts.”
“Goodbye, John. I’ll talk to you on Tuesday at the same time.”
John laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners. “This is going to be a shit show.”
“No. I’m very busy right now,” John answered as he continued to type with his first two fingers. John kept glancing up at the screen, then back at the keyboard then over to the biscuits.
“Oh!” Sherlock said, as he dusted his hands off. “Hudders said that she’d rent ‘C’ to us too if your Nan wants to live with us.” Sherlock paused, then glanced again at John. John wasn’t used to being studied this intensely, and he moved away from the window. He picked up a new book, and added it to a random box.
for you to breed.” Greg snarled. “I do not have pups. I do not have anything but
“Because I was on duty. I wasn’t supposed to be drinking, but I’d just filled out my first death certificate and the older medical staff tried to ease my pain. So I hid and when he found me, I vomited in his face.”
“Why is this so important to you?” John asked, seriously.
“Really, Daddy?”
“Don’t you dare call me that. It’s a terrible nickname.”
“A concussion?”
John nodded his head, a bit surprised at how smart Rosie is. “You’re gonna change the world, remember?”
John heard Rosie’s excited footfall before he saw either of them. Rosie ran right into the office and hugged John’s legs. “Hi Daddy!”
“Nan, we will be fine. I’ve always managed in the past, now’s no different.”
Mycroft grabbed his phone and read his messages from Sherlock.
“Shut up, dear.”
“I need to know how. I need to know if my girl was tortured-”
Greg looked at Sherlock with tears in his eyes. “You fucking bastard! You do care.”
“Spend the night with your Alpha, acushla. I’ll take care of your daughter.”
“Myc’s known me my whole life. You’re still learning me.”  ‘Lock grinned, then reached out with his other hand. John reached out for the hand, studying it. There were dark lines clearly visible on ‘Lock’s palm.
“My dear girl, it has been a hellish landscape without you. Your father is such a dullard.”
“When she’s done, we’ll get you back in bed, and then I’ll join you,” ‘Lock promised his sleepy Omega, playing with the blonde hair resting on his shoulder.
“All three of them, Mycroft. You’re a lucky man.” John said, with a small tight smile. “Also, Greg said ‘Tell him that the March sisters are happy to meet him’. So, don’t be afraid. Pick them up. Hold them. The nurse will be in shortly.”
“I was very mean to you and baby girl.”
The men appeared next to Moran a bit breathless, laughing. “What took you guys so long?” he asked. “Are your nails finally dry?”
‘Lock glanced up just as John came out of the bathroom. “Let’s getaway.”
“Oi!” Greg called, happily. “I’m about to kiss my husband, Sherlock Holmes, so you may want to turn away now!”
The flight to America was as smooth as possible. John slept snuggled up against his Alpha, while ‘Lock himself got lost in his mind palace.
Please, please, please be patient. It'll be worth it for our Holmes' :)
“So, Daddy,” Rosie said, sitting down on John’s knee. “May I sleep over at Auntie Molly’s? She’s going to a honey fest in Canterbury.”
John nodded against ‘Lock’s chest and neck. “That could be fun.”
Moran nodded. “I’ll see you there, then. Dr. Watson. Mr. Holmes.” With a nod, he picked up his tray and headed up to the O.R.
‘Lock pinched John’s arm, and said grumpily, “Unacceptable.”
“You horrid, ruinous child!” Sherlock jabbed her. “You know that weed slows me down worse than food!”
“Sherlock, get off the couch and help your daughter.”
“Greg, I must say these girls are beautiful. You did a good job,” John said, as he switched the second baby for the third baby. John cradled the second baby for just a minute before he placed her in with her sister.
“Yes, I did,” John agreed, watching the lines of his husband’s back move. John made his way to his armchair, and sat quietly in it. “How shall I make it up to you, my love?”
blonde hair -
“And it’s worse! I’m pregnant.”
“Why would you be homeless? Mycroft’s got more money than many third world countries.” Sherlock wrinkled his eyebrows.
“Thank you,” the fiancee smiled at the clerk, and pulled John over to the elevator.
Greg grinned, feeling his husband settle into the snuggle. “I am so glad to be home, Myc.”
“Yes sir.” Mycroft said, with an audible swallow.
“I’m hardly an amatuer.”
They approached the podium in the center of the room. Sherlock pressed the red button in the center.
“You’re a brat, Daddy.”
“Get in the car when it comes. Don’t ask too many questions…. How good of a liar are you?”
“They’re not.” Greg said, with a sigh. He tousled his hair. “Can I borrow your phone? Myc hasn’t heard from me in nearly 3 months. I need-”
Sherlock grabbed a package of ginger snaps, and a hot tea for himself. John took a full meal, two snacks, water, and a hot tea from the commissary. They walked to the cashier, and John paid for them both before Sherlock could protest. There was a table near the exit, and they sat down together.
Sherlock helped Greg stand to transfer from chair to bed. He looked at Greg, and smiled. “Are you ready to pop those brats out?”
John smiled sadly, before he hugged his grandmother tightly. “Thank you for last night. I really appreciate you coming to the funeral.”
Mycroft glared at his brother, and through clenched teeth he said, “It is
“There was no equipment failure,” John said, placing his cup down. “There was a hurricane.”
John gave a snort, and removed his hand. “It’s a side effect from the implant.”
me so much.”
John sighed loudly, and stood up. He kissed Rosie on top of her head. “Do you want to go to Nan?”
John laughed. “I can’t say for sure, Sherlock. I’m usually sleeping at the time. Do you?”
“Because he was busy.”
“You’re going to need to be. John, make sure you bring your daughter.”
“I know you have asthma-”
Ella smiled blandly, but didn’t say anything.
John smiled, realizing that Sherlock knew he had looked him up at some point. “It said ‘The World’s Only Consulting Detective’ but that’s not a job title.”
your fault that you had this terrible thing happen to you, and honestly, Sherl-”
“Yes it was. I know it’s three years later, but I just can’t move on. My therapist said-”
“Healthy?” Myc asked, glancing over John. He could tell
“It doesn’t matter who you love John, as long as you love someone.”
“Had,” John said resolutely.
“Yes, dear,” Mycroft sighed, and glanced out the window. “Sherl, you’re going home?”
“No.”
Something fabulous this way comes!
“Daddy, you are giving away hours of work-”
“Hallo Bruder. Wie geht es dir?”  =  “Hello brother. How are you?”
“Why is he the champion of Omegas?”
Both men laughed, then each of their phones went off. “Thanks for a great night, John.”
“This is perfect.” John pronounced.
“Oh, fuck you Ella. You never listen. You think you’re so clever and helpful. It’s annoying,” John snapped, annoyance clear in his body language.
“Of course I do! How can I prove it to you?” John asked, stroking ‘Lock’s hand.
Sherlock slammed his book close, and stood up. The cell phone clattered to the floor as Sherlock stamped into the bedroom. He slammed the door.
Rosie sighed, and rolled her eyes. “Daddy, please. I want to go to the honey festival.”
“Absolutely not, ‘Lock. I was thinking of how fucking amazing you are.” With a smile, John looked at him, then turned to his friend. “Lead us to tea.”
“Is there a match on?” ‘Lock asked.
“What do you think it’s going to be?”
“Dr. Watson, this is my brother, Sherlock. Sherlock, this is John.”
“I guess you’ll just have to count the nights that I have a sock tied to the door,” John said, before he walked away from Sherlock. “You coming ‘Lock?”
“I can’t afford rent elsewhere,” John said, as the three men made their way down the steps to the lunch room.
“But how does this help me?” John asked, frustrated.
“How did you manage that?”
“You should!” Rosie snapped, turning her face away. Sherlock wrapped his arm around her shoulders, and she leaned against him.
“Oop! Oop!”
“It was a false alarm. I was dehydrated.”
Ella shifted in her seat, and pulled out John’s note file. “When you started, you stated you were single, straight, and lonely. How would you describe yourself now?”
“The woman lived.” Moran shrugged with a grin. “She used to bring Watson baked goods.”
“Please do,” The tall lanky man said, taking a step away from John. “Bye.”
“Hullo, Papa Myc and Uncle ‘Lock! Your girls have arrived.” John said, as he stepped into the room. He forced his voice to sound cheerful. Myc dashed to John’s side to stare at his children.
“I don’t care about that. You’re being loud. Stop it.” Flour hit John in the face, and he looked furiously at his family. Sherlock made a guilty face before scurrying back into the kitchen.
“I do.” Greg agreed, zipping up his coat, and smoothing it out. “Listen, my name is Gregory Holmes-”
“As you should be, my-”
“You’ll be an uncle soon, ‘Lock.” For the first time, Greg sounded weary.
“Sherlock, if you could take that chair with you. Thank you so much for your help today.”
“Do you miss Mary or do you miss the idea of a wife?” Ella asked in a soft voice, knowing that John was listening to her.
“Because he’s the boss?”
“You have access to MI-6’s files. Figure it out,” Greg grinned. “But it’s apparently S.O.P. to run a pregnancy test on any and all Omegas and Betas who seek treatment.”
Sherlock dug through his mind palace to place the reference and laughed out loud as his mind replayed the scene in question.   “No, I don’t think I’ll be that detached.”
“You can’t force him to find a spouse.”
“American or English?”
Sherlock glanced at the label, snorting out a laugh. “It should be for that price. Also, they usually have really good gypsy tart.”
Sherlock arranged his face into a neutral look, then nodded. “It’s my pleasure to help you.”
“Thank you for business. Come again.”  The funeral director smiled mildly at him.
John finished washing his hands, and entered the O.R. again, fighting the blush on his cheeks.
“Of course he’s my friend,” John responded without thinking, annoyance clear in his voice. John picked up his tea mug and took a sip, trying to remain calm.
mine, my Alpha, my husband, my lover
“Papa, don’t you think you’re a bit too long for Daddy’s lap?”
Sherlock sat up and stood up to pace the room. “Well, that narrows it down quite a bit. So it’s either Six Flags New Orleans-”
“I submitted it.” John announced, somberly.
“Why do they always mention that bastard? Why do you let them? Why do you still see them?” Mycroft asked him, angrily. Sherlock glanced over at Mycroft and tried not to smirk because his “distract Mycroft by making him angry” plan was working. “Why didn’t you tell them he used to put cigarettes out on you and he drugged you-”
John glanced at Rosie and sighed. “Your Papa is so tetchy-”
“Alright, Greg, let’s do this. We’re going to deliver those babies. I’m going to hang up a privacy shield, and we’ll bring the babies around for you to cuddle for a moment.”
“Now, what can Sherlock and I help you with?” John asked in a brisk professional voice.
Greg climbed on top of his husband’s lap and swallowed the rest of Mycroft’s words down with a kiss that was feral, all teeth and tongue.
“I’m glad to be home. I missed my Holmes boys.”
“Sherl, John’s being humorous,” Greg supplied kindly.
“I shall not apologize. He was trying to give my brains away for free.”
“You do. I only fell back to sleep because I was still not feeling my best.” ‘Lock pulled his legs back to his body and tucked his chin on top of his knees.
“What do you want to hear about them for?” John laughed.
“The personal shopper and the concierge will be up momentarily.” The hotel clerk smiled politely. “Your bags have already taken up.”
“My brother is not dead. He’s been away,” Mycroft said flatly, and barely had time to duck from the flying beer bottle. Behind Mycroft, it shattered on the floor.
“Also, you look hungry,” Sherlock said, a touch of guilt in his voice. “I will make you something.”
"Hes out in public because he's either unclaimed or a whore, darling. Shame! Shame! Don’t make eye contact. He’s probably a thief as well. Hmph!" The mom answered with hate in her voice.
John bounced Rosie in his arms as he listened to the funeral director speak. “Then I guess everyone is satisfied.”
Thanks Myc. How fast do you think you could arrange a trip to America for John and I? SH
“Well, then you can study his cock--”
“You don’t have too,” John smiled politely. “When is your flight?”
“The boss of science and making a mess, nothing else.”
John smiled at Sherlock, and touched his hand. “Thank you for trying to save me. It’s much appreciated.”
Sherlock nodded, and rushed to catch up. In silence, they walked together to Greg’s room.
Sherlock nodded his head, “That makes sense. So do you want children?”
“Kay, ‘Looock,” John said, laying his head on his Alpha’s shoulder.
“You know Nan’s rules, if you are going to cry, you must do so in your bedroom.”  John carried her into the nursery. He placed her gently in her cot, and she continued to cry softly. John kissed his fingertips and pressed them to his daughter’s cheek.
Sherlock glanced over at John and rolled his eyes. “I’m going to find Myc,” he announced then departed the room.
Rosie glared at Sherlock meanly, but took his hand again. “Did we stop by to pick up Daddy before we went to Aunt Molly’s?”
John couldn’t reply because they were at the marriage chamber. Mycroft stopped walking, and made a shooing motion to get them into the room. John took a deep breathe, and stepped into the marriage room. Sherlock followed bouncing Rosie in his arms.
“What happened, my acushla?”
John choked on the question and coughed, unable to answer. “I had my marriage. Mary’s dead, remember?”
“We were kids, James. I didn’t know what I was saying or doing.”
Moran nodded, and shoveled some food into his mouth. “How did that go over?”
“The entirety of the British Government.”
“Dr. Rami, can you hang out a bit longer?”
“John…” ‘Lock exhaled, as his right palm burned. He clenched it tightly, then shook it out. “Do you really mean it?”
“There was no talking. You turned on that animal show and were snoring minutes later.”
“You do it all the time, I’ve noticed.”
“Da! Da!” She stated, not stating very clearly if she agreed or disagreed.
Sherlock leaned over and causally filled up John’s glass again. “You tell me.”
“‘Lock, it was a joke.” John said, reached out for ‘Lock’s hand. In the palm of ‘Lock’s right hand, there was a ornate something beginning to emerge. There was a long handle, and fancy swirls visible, but nothing else. John held his Soul Mark open to compare to ‘Lock’s.  “That is not dirt.”
“Who do you think you are, making demands, Omega scum?”
“Pardon?” Sherlock asked sharply. “You are forbidden to die until I am rotted in my grave.”
“Oh, John, I couldn’t predict when you’ll want coffee.”
“Nan’s always in the kitchen, isn’t she?” John smiled a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes as he carried Rosie to the kitchen. John placed her things down on the counter and lowered her to the floor. Rosie made a small noise of surprise, before she ran off to the living room. “She loves those plastic covered couches.”
It means I can be ‘easy’ with little to no consequences.”
“Ro ate breakfast. I bathed her, and dressed her for the day.”
“Hey, cut the sexist remarks out.” John said, slipping by to grab himself food. Sherlock followed John with a snicker.
“Myc,” Lock announced, then ruffled his curls. “When.” He started, struggling to sit up. Finally ‘Lock was in an upright position before he chugged an entire water bottle. “When I was little, our cook would make us that soup when we had a sick day. We found this crappy little Indian place by my old apartment and basically Myc bought it… I know it’s stupid, but it’s my favorite.”
“No, this is perfect. I wasn’t sure you would call.”
Mycroft slid his phone back on the end table, and Greg grumbled irritability, “Problems tomorrow, us tonight.”
“That’s probably true, John. I’m still practicing and growing. What about you?”
Sherlock laughed, and moved her hands to his mouth. He kissed each one before she lowered them down to her side. “I have never forgotten Syph at home. I don’t intend to start now.”
John lost himself in charting on Mrs. Baine’s arthritis and her uncontrolled blood pressure. He finished her chart quickly. He wrote out a paper prescription, and added it to his ‘needs faxed’ bin.
“He was really good in bed,” John sighed, then touched Sherlock’s arm again. “The base was a lonely place. Part of me thinks I knew there was no future, but when you could die at any moment, the future means nothing.”
“Are you crying too?”
Mycroft stared at his husband’s face, lightly tracing over the scar of the soul mark on his left ring finger. “It’s so frustrating. No one gets soul marks anymore, and you get one, and they steal it from you.”
“Oh, piss off, Mycroft,” John said dismissively. He tucked his laces into his trainers, and stood up. John walked over to the brunet and held his hand out to him. “Come on, dear.”
“You’re safe from Sholto for now,” Sherlock said, brushing his curls out of his face.
John reminded himself, pulling his arm back over to himself.
and covertly rubbed his eyes.
“Those two documented cases… Do you remember them?”
“I know you are not into being a jobless miscreant-”
“How did you two meet?” Sherlock asked, leaning forward tapping on the table.
“No!” Greg looked up at him, in horror. “You. I want you to deliver the girls to Papa Myc.”
Uncle Myc came. Papa upset. XOXOXO. See you soon, Daddy. RWH
Mycroft laughed, then said, “Grandmother would never say that!”
John’s eyes swept around the room, systematically ignoring the majority of the aged photos until he saw one of two young boys with their arms slung around each other. John moved over to it, and picked it up.
“I’ve got more money than the British bank,” Sherlock said, leaning forward to pluck the menu away from John. He placed it to the side with his own. He picked up his phone, typed something, and then smiled widely at John. “You’ll never have to work again. I don’t want to have sex. Really John, you could do worse.”
Sherlock looked at the phone in his hand in amazement. “How will you get there on Saturday?”
Is breá liom tú  =  I love you
“Oh, Daddy, stop. You’re just fine!” Rosie grinned, as she turned to start her Daddy’s tea, and her own iced coffee. “Is this new case really important?” Rosie grabbed two ceramic mugs down, and a tumbler with a lid.
“I agree, John, it’s completely less than ideal, and honestly you’ve had a really shitty run lately. I don’t know why I am worried about this…”
John sat in the cab on the way to the flat at Baker Street, counting on his fingers as he rode. He was thinking about his life with Mary and how it was as close to perfection.
“I’m better behaved than my dear sister,” John muttered, as he watched the women in his life file out of the funeral home. Abby came over to John, and transferred Rosie into his arms.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but kissed John on top of his head as he walked by. Rosie appeared in the doorway and grinned at her Daddy. “Did it work?”
John smirked, and returned to his job application. John was so focused on the job application that he let the biscuits be stolen.
“Only worse because of where you are. I’ll get a team to bring you home.”
So there it is.
Sherlock sipped his tea, and made a hissing sound. “Uncle George is picking you up here.”
Rosie sighed, and rolled her eyes. “No, Daddy. I want an iced coffee!”
“I was just watching Greg.” Sherlock’s words were rapid-fire.
“Tell me a Watson glory day story.” Sherlock asked, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.
Sherlock smirked, and headed back to the car to let the husbands enjoy themselves. It felt like less than a minute and the two lovebirds joined him. He glanced over his brother-in-law and the words
The cab ride to Angelo’s was a quiet one. John got out of the car, and pulled his wallet out to pay. A glance at Sherlock shaking his head had him putting his wallet away.
“No, I moved here when I was-” John paused, then shook his head. “I hated it at first. My wife moved here for a job. She was a nurse, and I moved with her after my discharge. We lived three minutes from-” John cut himself off, and made eye contact. “You don’t care.”
“Who’s the ghost?”
Greg had reached the end of his patience. “Stop being such a meddling nosy fucker and be the caring man I know you are. Be the man who changed the country’s laws to join my life. Remember why I choose you. Remember what I asked you for. Just remember what I deserve. Do I need to remind you what I left behind? Do I need to show you pictures of the bruises and marks that so often littered my skin?”
John exhaled loudly, and nodded his head. “I can’t promise Sherlock will want to take the case. He’s very picky.”
‘Lock cleared his throat, then grinned. “Every single one of those places are owned or operated by Omegas and they were floundering. So… Myc did what he could.”
“Jesus, Watson. You haven’t changed, have you?”
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen this side of you, John.”
Greg Holmes stumbled into the antique building and took a deep breath. He tried not to clutch at his stomach, as he made his way into the consulate’s office. He stood in line ignoring most of the people who either pulled away from him, or cast dirty looks at him.
“I remember when my girl and my wife were younger. They used to bake cookies once a week. Somehow Gemma, my daughter, would always end up stealing cookies for me. She would grab two or three and run into my study with them. She was covered in flour and melted chocolate.” Robert sighed loudly. “The point is, I miss her, and I need…. Closure.”
“It… Ok, so then if it is a Soul Mark, what is it? Did I get something lame?”
“I know he will. I have so much information! Thank you, Dr. Watson! Thank you!”
Rosie grinned as she stood up, “I’m brilliant, remember! Are you going to go make up with Papa or shall I get him stoned?”
thank you all so much for reading. I really enjoyed writing it <3
Rosie stifled a laugh, as John took a deep breath. “Sherlock, change your tone-”
‘Lock studied the thoughtful expression on John’s face, giving him time to process the words he wanted to say. “The year after he left, it was so hard. I spent hours every week in hours of therapy with Ella over our break up. James said it wasn’t a break up. It was just a … Halt.” John wiped a tear off his cheek. “He told me that his love for me was eternal ... That time and space meant nothing, but the moment he was away from me, the truth crashed down on me.” John took a moment to swallow hard and wipe his eyes.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock asked, as he pushed the menu to the side. John made a polite “what do you mean?” face. “Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“I want to be a crime scene investigator,” Sherlock continued. “So all sort of things. How long it takes flesh to rot in the sun-”
‘Lock cleared his throat, then smirked, “Avia and I spent years telling him I was an Omega so he’d stop being a pompous arse. It worked.”
“Yes, dear,” Sherlock sighed, standing up and brushing his Bellstaff off. He reached down to help John stand up, and pulled him to his feet. “You ok, John?”
John cleared his screen, threw his phone down. He heard the toilet flush, so he made a grab for his pj bottoms. He pulled them on, and leaned back against the headboard.
“Sherlock, you causing trouble?” Greg looked at his brunette brother, amused.
“Papa, why is it ok for you to have books to look things up in, but I’m not allowed to use Google?”
“Four years ago, John,” Ella reminded him softly, as she wrote something on her notepad.
“As long as I’m yours, nothing else matters.”
“Oh, you fucking bastard. Are you in your mind palace? I’ll murder you too. Fry your nuts-”
A palpable switch happened in John before they walked into Greg’s room. He went from friendly John Watson to indomitable Dr. John Watson. Sherlock filed that moment away, and a fast glimpse of John’s arse, into his mind palace for later use.
John Watson had his arms full of his daughter and her supplies as he eased his way into his grandmother’s flat door open. “Nan?”
“I refused James several times before Mary.” John interrupted Mycroft. “You don’t have to remind me that his spouses died suspiciously. I know more about that man then you do. Also,” John started, but stopped to adjust his grip on his flailing daughter. Sherlock rolled his eyes, and pulled her into his arms. John sighed, but let him. “I just buried my wife. I have a mourning period, as is customary.”
John tells his Nan about his wedding and sees the new apartment
The driver passed the building and pulled into the garage. Two tall figures dressed in black were waiting for John and his daughter. The driver slammed the car into park and jumped out to help John out of the SUV.
‘Lock laughed, pressing a kiss to John’s head, sneaking his hands up the back of John’s shirt. John giggled as he felt the gentle sweep of his Alpha’s hand. “I smoke quite a bit, my love. I just don’t do it around you.”
“Of course I am. I have been building their financial future since the day since you two got married.”
“Mycroft!” John snapped, wrenching his daughter out of Sherlock’s arms.
“Yes.” Greg nodded, and glanced up as Mycroft entered the room, pushing a wheelchair. “Myc, you alright? Ready to be a dad?”
John’s eyebrows knit together, and he looked at the man in front of him. “How old are you?”
“I already know about your ex, and I’m not-”
wrong with you, despite what your ex tried to tell you. I’m here if you ever want to talk about it.” Greg held Sherlock’s gaze, until Sherlock nodded and turned away again. His hand moved down to Sherlock’s and gave an it affectionate squeeze. “Aren’t I a better choice to actually talk about it than Myc? The man who has-”
John exhaled loudly. “My wife isn’t even in the ground yet.. It’s going to look-”
“What about Sherlock?” Ella asked in a neutral, careful tone. “Is he your friend?”
“Don’t worry, I’m sure Myc will buy you a few weird places, too.”
“I’m the Alpha, John,” Sherlock said, as he handed the driver cash. John nodded, realizing his faux pas.
The man nodded, “Thank you for last night,” he said awkwardly as he flopped down on the couch.
“You’re not ready to have actual intercourse, and that’s ok. When I need to get filled, I have toys…”
“What makes you feel so hostile, John?”
“Gregory, don’t be kind to him. It’ll just give his curls more waves.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and took the toddler into his arms. “You don’t speak for me. I’ll hold my daughter whenever I want.”
The grin fell from Moran’s face. “I’m an asshole. I claim it. I own it.” He looked properly contrite about the slip-up. “I’m sorry, Watson. I had no idea.”
“I didn’t forget,” Sherlock said. “I also put your “my favorite feminist is my aunt” shirt.”
Greg gently placed his hand on Sherlock’s arm. “Hey, it’s ok if you want to suck his dick. There’s nothing wrong with your biological urges--”
“Oh my goodness!” John exclaimed, switching back to Daddy mode. He grinned at his daughter, and she grinned back. “Is breá liom tú, acushla.”
“Fuck Tex!” John laughed, his eyes crinkling up at the corners.  “Anyway, I’m so glad it’s you. I need a man like you by my side for this one.”
Quietly, John whispered, “You are the best thing about this life, Sherlock Holmes. I love you so much more than I ever thought possible.”
‘Lock nodded seriously. “That sounds about right.”
“My daughter is missing.”
“Right-”
“Mr. Holmes, I’m sorry, but I need to get your Omega’s measurements,” the stylist said, in a low, slow voice with just a hint of southern twang.
The boys haven't had sex yet, so that'll be the next chapter, because let's be real..... That's all we want.
“I love you, I love playing with your cock. I just-”
Sherlock giggled, then glanced over at John to see him smirking. “You’re an idiot.”
“It’s John!” John hissed, fumbling with his phone. He looked around, and saw his Nan. He made his way over to her, dodging the few remaining mourners. “Nan? Can you hold my daughter for a mo’?”
The knock on the door made him jump, but he quickly composed himself before he opened it. Waiting behind the door was an assortment of staff. ‘Lock welcomed them in the room, and allowed them to do what they needed so they could leave him.
"Share my bed and I'll think about it."
“Sherlock is dead,” John insisted, standing up. He clenched his fists in rage. “Go.”
“Daddy!” Rosie groaned. “It’s a cell phone. You have one too, you know. Uncle Myc made sure of it when I went to America.”
“It’s been handled, Dr.”
“And soup, apparently,” John said a bit bitterly.
“False, Omega. I’m incredibly damaged and you’re good enough to love me while I put myself back together.”
“Do not call me your love! You-”
“I have not! I miss my wife-”
“The Beta ripped from asshole to navel after giving birth.” James laughed. “Well, a medicine man tried to perform a c-section. Watson here rushed in and saved the day.”
Sherlock bounded out of the car as soon as it stopped. He ran over to Greg’s side to help him stand. Greg took a moment to gather himself before he allowed Sherlock to pull him upward. He pulled his hands out of Sherlock’s and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck. “I’m so glad you’ve been here so much. I’m going to miss you.”
“I wish I had met you years ago. After Victor and I parted ways, I was so lonely. I saw all these Alphas and Omegas or Alphas and Betas together. I’d watched Molly Hooper meet five different Alphas, and marry one. I watched my big brother, my favorite person, my only friend for so many years, meet Greg and marry him. I watched them get pregnant.”  ‘Lock paused, clearing his voice.
John smiled at the screen, knowing that she used voice to text. He clicked the heart emoticon and sent it to his daughter.
“Oh, Johnny, give her to me,” Bethany Watson chided him. “This gorgeous granddaughter of mine and you barely let me hold her.”
“I could say the same thing for you Mycroft Holmes,” Greg called back before he ran down the steps. He jumped off the bottom two steps and threw himself into Mycroft’s arms. “I’ve missed you so much, darling.”
Rosie was too happy to be annoyed with her Daddy. She hugged him around the neck and said, “Does Papa already know this?”
Sherlock stopped pacing to dash off to the book shelf. He pulled one of his home made tomes down to page through it. “Ah, yes, Fresno. I thought the name sounded familiar.” Sherlock took his tome over to where his daughter sat and perched on the arm of the chair. “Johnny Fresno is an Iranian-American businessman who’s mostly interested in the amusement industry. He has spent several years-”
“She’s yours.” John confirmed with a nod. He pulled his cell phone out of his pocket, snapped a quick picture and put it away again.
“Omega, place your second finger of the left hand on the lighted panel.” John put his finger on the podium. A quick blood sample was collected from the two men.
Rosie nodded her head, and grabbed Sherlock’s hand. “Come on, Papa. It’s time to go wait for Aunt Molly.”
John has a mini heat.
“Well, then, please explain it to me in your simplest manner so that I can understand your thoughts.”
Do you understand?”
Rosie squealed loudly, and threw her arms around John’s neck. “Daddy! You should have told me!”
“An Omega slut like you having a mother.” The  Alpha laughed, then called to his friend, “Amir, Greg here says that he has a mother.”
“He needs an heir. You have an heir.”  Sherlock said, as he rubbed Rosie’s back. Sherlock cleared his throat, and made eye contact with the child. “I’m asexual,” he announced. “And any spouse that would want me would want to have sex so you can see how this would work for me.”
“Hudders?” John asked, wiping his hands on his pants.
John scowled at his Alpha, and muttered, “I should get up. How did you talk me into sleeping on the couch?”
Greg shut his eyes and focused on his husband’s face to remain calm.
“Gregory,” Mycroft sighed.
“John?”
“Illusions are only necessary if you have something to hide. What do I have to hide?”
“I think you said something about crap telly and Angelo’s?” John walked over to Sherlock, awkwardly. Sherlock smiled, and held his hand out for a taxi-cab.
“You will.” Greg grinned, then pulled away. “Come on, let’s go.”
John nodded at her words, before he stated, “I’ll call you when I’m ready to pick her up.”
John nodded, before he pushed the cot out of the room. “Say goodbye to daddy!” he said to the girls, as he carefully guided them down the hall. John stared at these three miracles that he’d helped bring into the world, and felt overwhelmed again. He allowed himself a moment to mourn for his daughter,
Sherlock pouted, as he turned his back to John to put his instrument away. “You shouted,” Sherlock accused, churlishly.
John laughed, as they walked through the darkened building. “He’s been a right arse to me, so bully for you!”
“Geeze. Poor Greg.”
“Yeah, I know. I miss Mama, too.”
“Roommate does,” John grunted as he pulled his shoelace too tight.
“You know he’s stalking me?”
. You will let your obsession with his future go, and you will focus on your duty to me, Alpha. I am your responsibility and I need your support now more than ever. This is my third pregnancy…. As you know, we were here once before and it ended poorly. So-”
‘Lock used his foot to knock John’s phone out of John’s hand. “You should view that e-mail on the laptop anyway.”
Sherlock bit his lip, and turned away from Greg. “I’m married to my studies, Graham. You
“It’s true,” the cab driver spoke up. “Me Nan’s a giant lesbian and she’s like seventy. She’s been divorced three times!”
“Now, but when you’re a kid you don’t have a smell.”
Greg bristled instantly at the archaic term
“Every single one of them has gone to college, even their grandmother. It was apart of the terms when Myc bought it.” ‘Lock yawned.
“Hello, Angelo,” Sherlock grinned at him, then gestured to John. “This is my spouse, John.”
Arranged for a car to pick you up and take you to the William Vale. Also hired a concierge to handle anything you need. Don’t be afraid to spend money. MH
John scribbled “Fantasticland” and “Hurricane Sadie.” “That was in 2017, wasn’t it?”
‘Lock nodded, thinking. “The one turned out to be a very convincing hoax, but by the time it was discovered, one of them was dead. I mean, it’s Russia, so they probably froze to death. The other was from Argentina in the early 1900’s. The Alpha had three dots going up his left ring finger, and the beta had the same three dots. The photographs are a bit blurry, but they’re legitimate.”
“Sorry, y’all. I just quit smoking. It’s a bitch,” She tried to smile, then turned away.
“Papa and I will be just fine, allow me to assure you!”
“Soon,” Sherlock promised, placing his empty tea cup on the corner of the desk.
“It bloody well should be!” John cried, upsetting his daughter with the loud shout.
came flying at him. Satisfied, he smirked at his brothers and turned to look out of the window. He felt Greg’s hip at his, and smiled into his palm. “I’m glad you’re safe, brother mine.”
“Filthy Omega scum though, his eyes are nice. I bet my wives would let you sleep at their feet.”
she wouldn’t want you shipped out of the country for being unlawful-”
“Because potential flatmates should know the worst of each other.” Sherlock admitted, with a laugh.
“Uncle Mycie dropped off your bag on his way back to the office.”
Sherlock grinned, flushed bright pink at the endearment. “If you want to go ahead, I’ll meet you there.”
“So did you, as I recall.”
Sherlock gave him a pointed look. “They’re his parents. You know how it went. Complained about the weather, told me I’m too skinny and tried to actually feed me-”
“Papa, did you hit your head? You always forget Uncle Greg’s name.”
“John?” Sherlock asked, noting how John’s entire body had tensed.
“Uh, yeah. That’s me.” John managed to say, ignoring the way his heart swelled at the surname.
“Naturally. My brother’s the head of the department,” Sherlock said turning back to John and cleared his throat. “So, do you want children?”
“I’m not a miscreant!”
“Where is Rosie?” Sherlock asked, as he moved a box to the kitchen table.
“Don’t act like you didn’t love it, Daddy!”
“Maybe yours will be something matching mine.”
“MRSA?”
Rosie laughed, as she entered into her fathers’ bedroom. In a sing-songy voice she said, “Come on, Papa. Let’s get baked!”
“Hey, thanks for staying with me, ‘Lock. I know you wanted to go play with… The grown ups.”
“Investigation.”
The tall thin man glanced over John and his daughter, then asked, “Why do you blame yourself for the embassy?”
“That’s magical thinking.”
“Hello, I’m Sherlock Holmes,” ‘Lock introduced himself and pointed to his partner. “This is John.”
John thought ruefully, as he felt his pocket go off. He shifted his daughter to the other arm, and pulled his phone out.
“When’s Auntie Molly coming?”
Abby placed a hand on her grandson’s cheek. “Johnny, I’m serious. If you need anything-”
“Oh, so Greg owns a grocery shop, an ice cream shop, and an island in Greece.”
“No, love. That must have been-”

“Goodbye, Ella.” John turned the video chat off, and pulled up one of the charts from earlier today.
“It’s going to be a defined shape. It’s already more than just swirls.” John leaned forward for a kiss. ‘Lock leaned in and kissed him sweetly. “‘Lock, you and your kisses will be the death of me.”
“I’ll be down in about twenty minutes. I’m not on call this weekend, so I just want to finish my two charts.”
John regarded him coldly. “I should have acted faster.”
And this is all dirty......
“What do you do for a living?”
Moran turned to the tall Alpha, and stuck his hand out. “Any friend of Watson’s is a friend of mine. Patrick Moran, nice to meet you.”
Sherlock stopped playing abruptly and pulled his headset off his ears. “I am furious with you-”
“Oh, that’s right! Graham!” Sherlock said, as Rosie giggled.
Extactly what the label on the tin says.

“I didn’t know that story.” Moran laughed out loud as he pushed his plate away from him. “But, I have to tell you, it doesn’t surprise me. Watson always did have a thing for a man in power. First, the real Doctor on the base, then your second C.O., and of course the commander of the base. That was just Afghanistan, so I can’t imagine what a ho you were in Germany with Americans about. Everyone knows Americans are extremely easy.”
John eagerly dug into gobbling down his meal, while Sherlock opened his tea and dipped his biscuits leisurely into it. He stared at John’s military-efficient eating before he spoke.
Sherlock nodded his head, and leaned in to kiss John again. John eagerly leaned into the kiss, and grabbed a fistfull of curls.
“Is this important to you?” John asked, and Sherlock nodded. “So, stay a Holmes. I don’t care.”
John smiled into his cup of tea, before he took a sip of tea. “American. She worked at an amusement park and died there-”
“They were my biscuits,” came the lazy response from the black armchair.
John’s got a secret :)
“No, you listen to me, Mycroft Holmes. I love you more than anything in this world, but I will not let you behave this way. Stop being such a controlling arsehole that doesn’t listen to anyone but his brain.
“Better. I told you I just needed to sleep.”
“It was,” John assured him.
“Thanks, Dr. Watson.” Greg breathed evenly, pupils showing the medication was well saturated.
“So it must have been Fantasticland in 2017,” Rosie said, pulling her phone out. “According to Google-”
“I’m worried about Sherlock.” Mycroft admitted quietly, then added, “I want him to have this. What you and I have. I want him to have a spouse- a partner in crime. An Omega to care for. He’s really an affectionate child.”
John went to the bedroom, carrying the soup. He curled back up in the bed, and poked ‘Lock. “Wake up, dear. I’ve got soup.”
“I’m cheerful because I have my fiancee to myself for hours on end.”
“What does that mean?” Greg laughed.
“Major James Sholto has put a bid in on you. Do you wish to be Dr. James Sholto?”
“Why haven’t you been married before?”
The voice on the other line sighed loudly.
‘Lock lowered himself onto the bed, and moved his body close to John’s. He wrapped his arms around him, and held him close. ‘Lock kissed the back of John’s neck, but didn’t rouse him further.
