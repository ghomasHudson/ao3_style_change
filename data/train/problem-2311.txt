After unpacking John’s things, the two sat on the sofa, John half watching the telly and Sherlock not at all. Sherlock was lying down, his head in John’s lap, which allowed John to place his right hand in his bed of curls, slightly stroking them, making random patterns. The ringing of a phone, which startled John, interrupted the peacefulness. Sherlock practically leapt from the sofa to retrieve the phone out of habit and it wasn’t until he turned back around, phone in hand, did he realise what had happened. John was still sitting, but he was breathing faster, his eyes closed tightly, his left hand clutching the arm of the sofa.
Sherlock mumbled incoherently, but sat up. John took one look at Sherlock’s disarray of frizzy curls and his swollen lips and he was in a fit of giggles.
Sherlock stuttered, his cheeks blushing. “I—I’m happy with you too. But John, you don’t need to worry, these people are just idiots who desperately need my help.”
Sherlock nodded. “The cot wasn’t very comfortable.” He pouted as the front desk attendant handed him his coat. John giggled slightly. “Well it is a jail Sherlock.” He teased, as he picked up his coat.
Sherlock collected John’s soiled clothes and the sheets and headed to the washer, placing them inside. When he went back up stairs, the shower was turned off. He walked past the bathroom and remade the bed with clean sheets from the hall closet.
“The crime scene. Don’t worry, they won’t miss it. Come on.” He walked into the vacant door, tugging John by his hand with him.
“We can’t...Sherlock...” John tried to say, his voice shaking slightly as Sherlock sat up. They had to give their coats to the front office, and so in rather quick time, Sherlock had unbuttoned his rumpled shirt, discarding it to the side. He kept his eyes on John as he stood up, leisurely unbuckling his trousers. He kept them on however, only to allow the head of his erect cock to peak from his pants.
“Alright. Over the next two weeks, I want you two not have sex. If you have a nightmare John, I want you to talk about it, in detail, to Sherlock. Find other ways to connect as well.”
John moved from Sherlock’s neck to his spine, making his way down to Sherlock’s arse, nipping slightly at each cheek of his arse. Sherlock let out a surprised moan as John turned him around suddenly, swallowing down his cock.
“You…” the man let out a laugh, catching Sherlock once again off guard. “You were that loud man that I…” The man didn’t finish as sirens began blaring, appearing closer and before he knew it, there were almost half a dozen emergency vehicles down below including an ambulance.
At that last word, it was clear Sherlock had found it. John walked back to the kitchen, ready for the embarrassment that would come along with the awkwardness is will put between him and his flatmate.
“Do you…do you have any…” John stuttered as Sherlock lifted his head, his eyes staring up at John. “Do you have any…kinks?” John said, blushing.
“Right. Sherlock, I want you to be comfortable. Okay?” He said, kissing a kiss on the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “Now, I’ll wear them for you. But I don’t know if I’ll like wearing them or not. Okay?”
“Yes, that bird.” Sherlock said, pointing to the remains of a taxidermist bird, hidden under some torn blankets. “It was a hawk, stuffed and placed on the bookshelf in the hallway. The killer grabbed it and stroked Ms. Bass, killing her. The killer is someone she knew, someone against animal cruelty. This apartment is filled with animals from taxidermists and there are at least 4 animals skin rugs, and two stag heads, one in the main room, and smaller one in the hallway. Ms. Bass was a collector. The killer tried to make it look like a burglary, that’s why this place is a mess but there’s no sign of force entry. Look at her business partners, someone who knew Ms. Bass well, and would benefit from her untimely demise. Check with the daughter, she may know those her mother had disagreements with.” Sherlock finished.
“Oil! What are two doing?!” The guard yelled. He began to fumble with his keys, which allowed John and Sherlock to shuffle with their clothes. When the guard entered, Sherlock was completely dressed, however John still had a few buttons of his shirt left when the guard grabbed him by the arm, dragging him away.
Sherlock scoffed in response, and slowly sat up, his sulking mood radiating violently. He was still in his dressing gown, had been for –
John and Sherlock’s faces were red from trying to keep from laughing and as soon as the cell door closed, the room was filled with laughter, John doubling forward, a hand on his stomach, the other supporting him against the wall. Sherlock somehow managed to gracefully lie down onto the cot, deep laughter escaping his throat.
“I mean…I don’t know whether or not you’re flirting and I would like to know if you are so that…I could…flirt back.” Sherlock said, his eyes skittering across John’s face, to the floor, and back.
knew it would turn out bad, it’s your own fault you told them how long you’d be staying and so you couldn’t leave because that’s who you are.” Sherlock huffed, clearly angry about something John could really care less about right now, for he was much angrier now.
“I…I thought you were…” He looked away from John for a moment and then back at John, his face shifting, the panic disappearing. “Why-why were you sleeping?”
“Of course. I’d love to…go further with you.” John said, smiling up at Sherlock, trying very hard not too blush.
“I…I should…I…fuck…just...mmm…thank you…for doing what you did.” He finally said, his cheeks heating, no doubt very red now. He kept his gaze on the floor.
Sherlock rocked his hips against John, his erection evident. John moaned slightly, his grasp tightening. “John.” Sherlock said, hoping John would get on with it.
“Mhmm?” John groaned quietly, rubbing his face. “Sh’lock?’ He turned to Sherlock, his face wet. “I…”
“Sherlock…please…” John started, but couldn’t finish for he hiccupped, and the tears just began streaming down, his breathing turning ragged.
John, having seen the stolen keys, huffed, but his arousal got the better of him and he slid inside.
“Oh, okay. Then I’ll meet you in the sitting room. 5 minutes.” John said, grabbing his towel and the lace underwear before going into their bedroom.
“Mhm, its fine.” He said as he pulled the red panties back up, following by John’s jeans. He then crawled on top of John to kiss his lips. He picked up John’s bitten hand, kissing the red marks softly.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but was confused and he looked at the bed. It took him longer than he would admit, but when he did notice the slight dampness in the sheets and the slight acidic smell did he realize what had happened and John must’ve realized when he figured it out for he placed his forehead onto his knees and let out a muffled sound-something between a whimper and a hiccup.
Sherlock lips were harsh, nipping and licking John’s. John relaxed at the feeling, only to be suddenly aware what was happening and where they were. He shoved at Sherlock, tearing them apart.
John looked up, his eyes wet too now, and Sherlock thought his heart was going to leap out of his chest. “I...I believe I’m in love with you too.” He whispered. John’s eyes widened, and began to glisten sharply.
“John, its alright-oof” Sherlock started, falling onto the bed, with John clutching him in a tight hug.
“I’m sorry, I don’t want to upset you but I think you haven’t been dealing with the nightmares the best way and I think we should work together to do that.”
Sherlock nodded, looking down at John. John looked up at Sherlock, and once their eyes met, Sherlock lowered his head, capturing John's lips roughly. John's hands moved to grasp Sherlock's arse as he kissed back, swiveling his tongue with Sherlock. Sherlock moaned as John nipped his lips.
John followed Sherlock up the seventeen steps into 221B. Upon entering the new flat, he looked around, noticing the flat looked a bit messy, but still welcoming.
are the only one that is being daft. I mean, it’s…” He paused clearly realising he’s about to let out a deep secret. “It’s so obvious to Lestrade, to Molly, to Mycroft...to practically every client, I mean, how could you not have seen it?” he said the last part softly, his face relaxing in resignation.
“John!” He yelled, as he saw the boat begin to slow down and turn back, Molly at the wheel as Lestrade ran to the railing.
A giggled erupted from John suddenly his body shaking slightly he squirmed underneath Sherlock’s body. Sherlock didn’t move, but stayed laying on top of John’s, his head resting on John’s chest as a deep laugh vibrating from his throat.
Sherlock blushed as John rocked his hips against Sherlock’s, his nearly full hard cock brushing John’s. He nodded, and John smiled widely this time, his eyes gleaming with…relief? Sherlock wasn’t sure but any thoughts he would’ve had disappeared as John’s kissed Sherlock’s lips very quickly before sliding down, kissing down Sherlock’s torso.
John’s breathing was growing ragged, his cock growing as well. “Sherlock...” He whispered, trying not to sound as lustful as he was feeling.
Before he could finish his rambling sentence, the door swung open, and a disheveled and bleeding Sherlock stood in the doorway.
The “case” Lestrade had called them about wasn’t at all as interesting as thought to be, but more of a serious lack of intellectual people working for Scotland Yard.
Sherlock and John looked at each other before dissolving into giggles. Sherlock hastily buttoned his shirt and picked up his coat. “Come on John!” He said, pushing open the door quickly .
“You are mine.” He rasped against Sherlock’s lips before kissing his lips. “Mine.” He repeated as he moved along Sherlock’s jawbone. The taller man’s breathing grew ragged, his voice cracking as he spoke. “Yes…John…I’m yours.” He gasped loudly when John then nipped at his pulse point, before licking over the mark. John slapped a hand over Sherlock’s mouth.
Molly only giggled and closed the door. Sherlock looked up at John who was still as red as before, but now whose lips were red and swollen, his eyes twinkling. Sherlock smiled back, and pressed his forehead against John’s.
“Any luck?” John asked. It had been over two hours since they arrived at Emily Bass’s apartment and John was exhausted. He was hungry and felt a headache coming. But he didn’t want to let Sherlock down.
Once below deck, John cornered Sherlock. “What’s wrong Sherlock? You’ve been acting rather odd today.”
John and Sherlock made their way hand in hand through the crowd, Sherlock leading John by tugging him left and right, clearly in a hurry.
It was lunchtime, so London was buzzing with people, so John took his lunch to a small bench in the park and sat quietly.
Sherlock opened the door swiftly, nearly knocking over a few people. He jumped out, John right behind him.
John, clearly worn out by the emotional ride he just went through, simply nodded, not looking at Sherlock.
Sherlock stood up swiftly, and ignoring John’s plea, spoke his deductions out loud. “You went on a three and half day trip to visit your parents. You were at first pleased to see them, but that quickly went away with their pestering about you and a lack of a wife. They pleaded with you about their age and how they have no grandchildren and proceeded in making you feel guilty. They didn’t even mention Harry or how sober she’s been or how she and Clara are back together and are expecting a baby. You got tired after only the first day, but had to stay because you had initially told them you’d be staying three days. Really John, you
“Um John…” He began, his eyes on the ground. “I’m not….I haven’t done this before John…but I want to!” He quickly added, seeing John’s face change silently.
“Well, obviously you are not fine on your own since you are sitting in the edge of a balcony with eighty feet below you.” Sherlock snapped back. “And I am not going anywhere, not until the police arrive with the actual help.”
“Oh, don’t you worry sir, I’m taking you to exactly where you need to be.” The cabbie replied, pulling up in front of what appeared to be a school. John’s defenses went up, but he didn’t know what to do as the cabbie swiftly got out and opened John’s door, aiming a gun at him. “Come along now.” The cabbie ordered.
“I think we…like each other in a way—well a lot and we want this to work, but aren’t sure—shit, I um, am not making sense…” He dropped his head and looked up through his lashes only to see Sherlock still looking at him, his face softening.
“John!” Sherlock tried shouted, pulling back, his arms coming up to John’s shoulders, pushing him gently but firmly back.
“Its alright John. We can stop.” Sherlock assured him, before sitting up. “Let me just…” He faltered, but waved a hand to his groin. John nodded, and they both got off the couch. Before Sherlock left, he placed a kiss on John’s cheek, very close to his lips. John blushed and then sat down and waited for Sherlock to come back.
Sherlock pulled back, only to kneel slightly to pull down John’s jeans and pants swiftly off. He then stood up sharply, lifting John with him, so that his legs wrapped around Sherlock’s waist.
John and Sherlock broke apart but only John responded as Sherlock began kissing and sucking his neck.
Sherlock Holmes was a man of many things. He was obviously clever, and had known that since he was five. His parents knew that too, and although they seemed rather ordinary, they cared for Sherlock and allowed his to grow into the man he is today. He is a man of science, logic, reasoning, sentimental only deep, deep down, and although he’d rather deny it, he does love. He loves his parents. He loved his dog, Redbeard. He will most certainly deny that he loves his brother Mycroft. And of course he loves Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock Holmes was a man of many things and rarely kept anything a secret, having ousted all the secrets his cousins and aunts and uncles at a Christmas party when he was nine. He told his parents he was gay when he was thirteen, and they told him they
Thoughts like that began entering John’s mind and he shook his head, a habit he developed before he had gone to the hotel, to clear out those hazardous thoughts that led to him to that balcony.
John looked at Sherlock and with a happy sigh, he walked over to Sherlock and picked him up from his seat and pushed him to the threshold of the door that leaded out to the hallway.
“Oh, fuck yes, Sherlock! Sherlock!” John was nearly yelling, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s has he rocked into him.
, more expecting the sound of glee. John didn’t look towards Sherlock right away. He knew Sherlock must’ve gotten it.
Sherlock Holmes always thought that he couldn’t get attached. Not after Redbeard. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t appreciate the beauty and loyalty that was always found in a dog. And then one day he found a little terrier following him from Bart’s. He assumed it was a hungry stray and started to head to the local pet store. But it wasn’t until he noticed the limp and tattered fur did he gently pick up the dog and carry it home.
John’s smile, which had only begun growing, faltered slightly, the gleam in his eyes dissipating. He tried to recover from that abrupt question but Sherlock caught his shift in emotion and realised what he had asked must’ve sounded harsher than he meant and so he quickly recuperated.
Sherlock flushed, though that could’ve been because the heat from the jacuzzi. He bit his lip and leaned forward, his lips closer to John’s ear.
“Excuse me!” the man yelled, causing John and Sherlock to break apart. Startled, Sherlock slipped out of John and fell onto the floor.
John hurried home after apologizing to Marie’s family, and accepting the reward money reluctantly. He skipped taking a cab, and once on an empty sidewalk, he began running back to Baker Street.
Lestrade signed and nodded, waving them away. Sherlock didn’t waste any more time; he grabbed John by the arm and lead him to one of the parked police cars.
and her crew made their way through the harbor and into the open waters. Sherlock, much to the surprise of John, was silent for the first 20 minutes of the cruise. He was huddled on the port side of the boat, his stare focused in front of him.
As those words were taken in by Sherlock, his eyes started darting around the living room, cancelling out things that didn’t belong to John and so on. When a list of possible things came to mind, Sherlock started typing, only to end with a huff and a slam of his head on the table.
“But you shouldn’t be!” John blurted out in a rushed whisper. “I…I don’t like what they’re saying about you.”
They sailed for about fifteen minutes, the sun reaching high and Sherlock had shucked off his windbreaker, complaining about the heat.
“Oh fuck,” John moaned against Sherlock’s lips as Sherlock moved his right hand to John’s thigh, hitching it up. Sherlock then grinded against John, rolling his hips.
“Jesus, Sherlock, I told you I didn’t want to hear about it.” He gritted his teeth, clutching his mug of tea as he stalked to his chair.
John’s face softened into a look of true admiration and he softly kissed Sherlock’s lips before pulling Sherlock down onto the bed with him.
“Yes…Sherlock…I love you..come for me…” John gasped as his own orgasm hit him suddenly. He bit his own lip hard as he rode out his orgasm. Sherlock gasped suddenly against him, his own orgasm ripping through him.
“Ah, John…” He stared, about to introduce John to the people around when he stopped, noticing John’s current state.
John followed Sherlock through the swarm of police officers at a rather posh apartment complex. There were people with cameras being held back by a string of yellow type, though that didn’t stop them from snapping their equipment. Feeling out of place, John kept up the pace, staying right at Sherlock’s heels as he made his way into the elevator. Sherlock remained silent as the elevator took them to the 20
John hesitated, then clicked the safety on, checked to make sure it was loaded, and then placed it in the waistband under his jumper. He then followed Sherlock out of the flat.
Sadly, around the same time when John Watson learned and accepted bisexuality, his older sister Harriet, or Harry, had come out as gay, and that she had been seeing her best friend Rosie and after dealing with two weeks of fights and tears, 18-year old Harriet Watson left their home, or was kicked out by their red-faced father, their timid, teary mother silent behind their father. And so John kept his feelings for other boys a secret. And over the next two and half years, the secret got buried, and it wasn’t until his third year in university, living much farther from his parents now, that John let loose that secret and began his first relationship with a man.
“Oh you know, his normal exuberant self,” John answered, although, truth be told he hadn’t seen much of his flat mate lately.
Why were the killings so different. The first one, so cold. The lack of blood and the dumping in the river in stark contrast to the other two, all blood everywhere, speaking of anger and haste. Certainly, a razor or some other sharp blade had been used in all murders, a scalpel maybe? The cuts had all had that surgical precision so it had to be the same man. Finally, why did John seem absolutely clueless, surely an enemy like that you would remember?
“How you did it I will probably never understand but you never cease to amaze me,” Sherlock had pulled it off, and all was well in the world again.
“There is nothing in the samples of interest anyway,” Sherlock cast an irritated look over his shoulder at Lestrade, why was he bothering him with these inconsequential comments.
“The people living there have a thousand year old history, they had seen conquering armies come and go from Alexander the Great to Genghis Khan; everybody wanted a piece of that land. We are just one out of many in their lived experience, since the seventies they have been in constant war, they have seen the Russians, the Talibans and now us, a collaboration of so many nations that is impossible to know who is who.”
“I told you to run, I told you to run,” John cradled his body in his arms, he couldn’t believe that the voice repeating the same thing over and over were his own.
Sherlock had also proven over the last weeks that according to him, everything was normal. For him, nothing of importance had occurred between them.
“Now I will kill you John, you and your friend. Did you think I wouldn’t find you or that I would leave you alone just because you make friends with police officers and detectives?”
He wondered if he had intended all along to come here today? Maybe his conscious mind had left it to his unconscious to sort out the details. He had tried to tell himself that he did not know which day it was, but deep down he had known it even before he woke, in his dreams.
“Mate, you better pay your due, or else,” He shook his head is if to say he was disappointed, a look hard as steel in his sunken eyes but John never got to hear what that else would have been.
John tried to stop Sherlock, surely this couldn’t be it. The place felt empty, unliveable. But Sherlock wasn’t looking back at John, eyes stuck somewhere in the next room and he could see him suddenly stiffen. Where they going to turn back, had he realised he was wrong?
His throat clenched, from more than the frantic running, but John ignored it skilfully; he has had lots of practise. He snapped back and focused on the now instead, on finding Sherlock and banished the doubts to the back of his mind, whatever was happening, Sherlock would figure it out.
“You are angry,” Sherlock said as John helped him out the door, one arm wrapped around the wounded man, and into the rain. John didn’t answer, keeping his eyes focused on the uneven floor, jaws clenched shut.
It felt oh so good, like this was how it was supposed to be. His hands stroking John’s hair as their mouths explored each other. John’s lips were hard and dry and he tasted like iron or blood. Sherlock let his hands move over his chest, feeling his body through the shirt; heat radiating through the fabric. John had his eyes closed and Sherlock kissed his lips, the line of his jaw, and trailed kisses down his neck hearing John’s breathing hasten. It was absolutely intoxicating.
“I’ve been better, but I’ll live,” He paused, putting a hand up to the feel the blood on his head, “Thanks you, all of you.”
“Wait what,” John’s face turned bewildered as an officer placed him in handcuffs. Sherlock was pushed against the cop car, his wrists handcuffed behind his back as well. He tried to squirm but his efforts failed and he was pushed into the back of the squad car, John right behind him.
“You have no idea how much I have been wanting to hear you say that.” John said quietly, his voice cracking.
“Alright, Sherlock, look at me. Sherlock.” John waited until Sherlock looked up and then he continued. “Was it the “dying part” that upset you or was it something else?”
John followed suit, and soon the two were dressed. John smiled up at Sherlock as he pulled his down for an adoring kiss.
“Sherlock?” He said quietly. The DI glanced at him as Sherlock continued on ranting about some bad photographs being taken at a crime scene.
Their target for the evening was, according to Detective Inspector Lestrade, working London’s night life selling some drug that looked like cocaine but put the user in a coma. After which he, as Donovan had expressed it, sliced and diced until there wasn’t much left. The police had been tearing their hair out over the case and they had, after the second victim, asked for help for Sherlock’s help. And since where Sherlock went, John followed, here he was. Trying to find one nasty serial killing drug seller in the vast and trawling London night life; he felt like he was looking for a needle in a stack of needles.
“Don’t be silly, it is quite obviously the same killer as last time,” Sherlock said before something more considerate could have time to form. He studied the wall where somebody with the dead man’s blood had written:
“What? How can that not be important,” John said, “The poor kids might be scared for life, you could show a bit more consideration for people,” He met Sherlock’s eyes angrily and his voice rose towards the end, earning also him an equally warning stare from the waiter. Sherlock was being such an arse, he thought.
So he focused on the burning muscle pain in his arms, the throbbing of his head, the parched feeling in his mouth, the shoulder that was starting to go numb from lying still on the cold floor for too long. That way fear couldn’t take over.
He was not prepared for what happened next, he was upset over his miscalculation and not thinking or he would have stopped it. John pulled him in with the tight grip he still had on his hand. Sherlock fell forward over him as John’s other hand came up behind his neck pulling his mouth to his. Their lips met as John kissed him; it was dry and still, lips pressed against lips.
“There is nothing wrong with me, my body is just trying to tell me I need some rest and some, eh, private time. A perfectly natural thing.” Even to himself, the last sounded somewhat strained.
He looked on in, he had to admit, slightly sullen silence as Sherlock rolled up his charcoal grey jumper sleeve and added a patch to his arm. He smiled in content as the alkaloid was released from its sticky home on the patch and spread in his system. John noticed that there already was one badge next to it.
“To be honest, you never crossed my mind Peter, my world does not revolve around you. After that day I never even thought about you again” Angry, John had realised was the answer, if he got him angry enough he might be careless, John could rush him, as long as he saved Sherlock what did he care what happened to himself.
“Cudda just phoned,” John replied, his head feeling as if it weighted a ton, rubbing a hand over his eyes trying to clear his head.
John took the stairs three steps at a time, just waiving at Mrs Hudson trying to approach to him in the hallway. When he came into the apartment, it was empty. He felt the cushions on the couch; he was learning after all, they were still warm, Sherlock could not have been gone for more than a minute or two.
The hand he held on Sherlock’s shoulder sneaked its way up into his hair as John pulled his head forward so their foreheads were resting against each other. They did not look at each other but rather down, at Sherlock’s hands moving over John’s body. John gave up all pretence at control and let himself be swept away, load moans escaping as a wave of intense heat hit him forcing his pelvis and stomach muscles to clench as he came hard splashing over Sherlock’s hand.
Some kids had found the body playing by the Thames; that snaking river running through the entire city of London. The body had stuck underneath a bridge hidden from everyone but adventurous children trying to make a city of concrete and glass into a magical forest.
At the third turn he had John’s route figured out. There had been no sign of struggle in the flat, John’s jacket was gone. This meant he had exited the flat on his own accord. He would have been on the way to the clinic. How? How did John get to the clinic? Bloody hell, this was why you should bother with the trivial details.
He moved back to the other body and clear as day now that he knows what to look for he saw the ruined tattoo, not a birthmark after all, and moreover, he could almost make out the remnants of black ink, the faintest layout of a symbol.
He stood utterly still, Sherlock still in his loose embrace, moth hovering but not touching Sherlock’s lips. After what felt like a lifetime, he felt Sherlock’s hands at the small of his back, the gentlest of presses but it was enough. His body came alive and a heated burning flared up abruptly in him as Sherlock met him kiss for kiss.
He reeled back when he realized where his thoughts were taking him, or would have if Sherlock had not been holding him in place, instead only his head moved, slamming into the wall behind him.
“Here allow me,” John looked up, Sherlock was standing next to him VISA card in his gloved hands outstretched between his index and middle finger towards the landlord, who shrugged and took it, “Whatever you say mate, it’s your headache.”
However, right now, he had more important things on his mind than his feelings, he had to keep John safe, which went far beyond anything else at present.
“John, good to see you in one piece,” Sherlock looked as calm and perfect as he always did, but then John’s perception was slightly flawed at the moment.
John hated these moments when nothing Sherlock said made sense because now he would have to ask what floater and Sherlock would roll his eyes in exasperation at him.
Sherlock, followed the trail with soft little kisses as his strong hands stroked up John’s sides. They slid under his shirt and slowly, so slowly up his sides, long slender palms enclosing his chest. His thumbs searched for his nipples; rubbing slow circles round and over them as they hardened. John threw his head back and gasped; his hands clasped Sherlock’s by now naked shoulders, feeling the bones under the sinewy muscles.
“It was a black Mercedes. I got the registration number if that helps?” The man cringed as he tried his best to please the murderous looking police officer standing in his kitchen.
Somewhere John found an energy reserve, something his body had been saving for matters of life and death, which surely this was. The distance to Sherlock shrunk as he forced his body onwards, they were running shoulder to shoulder now, he looked over at Sherlock who was smiling a wild, wicked smile as he ran and he realized a similarly mad smile was plastered on his own face.
This just would not do John thought, why was Sherlock trying to do this on his own, didn’t he trust him? John scratched his chin absently, his finger tracing the fine stubble already covering it, even though he had shaved that very morning. He nodded at Mrs Smith who had just said something quite derisive about bus drivers and made a decision: this would have to end.
He carefully righted himself and took one first step towards the green door; one foot in front of the other down the street. He kept his eyes firmly in front of him, keeping his goal in view unless he might lose his courage.
He focused on these feelings because they told him he was alive. It was one of those habits he had picked up in the war; if you could feel pain you knew you were still alive. There are few things a soldier fear more than that moment before death when the central nerve system shuts down from overload and the pain goes away; that is when you know you are going to die.
“But, why now?” John asks. He knows he should let it rest or at least let it wait until afterwards but he also knows that he won’t feel perfectly certain himself until he is sure Sherlock wants this.
“Because you are here, even though your brother clearly told you to stay away from us. Or I believe ordered you for the sake of national security to do so,”
He fishes around in his shoulder bag which is standing beside the armchair and pulls out a present wrapped in a hideous bright green paper riddled with little elf’s in pointy hats dancing with each other. John had chosen the ugliest, most ridiculous paper he could find. He is sure Sherlock will get the point.
John set the tray down on the table and poured them a cup of steaming Darjeeling each, noticing that the latest scar on Sherlock’s chest was pale and healed now, before sitting down in his usual chair.
“But what does it mean?” John asked curious, he had never heard of this group and he wasn’t particularly religious either except being baptised in the Church of England at birth, how could it be connected to him?
If Lestrade didn’t give the order soon Sherlock thought vaguely that he would go insane, he would cross that fine line between genius and madman once and for all. At that precise moment a radio on the police behind him crackled into life and out over the static came Lestrade’s steady voice, “Team Doyle, the garage has been cleaned you go on five, Stand by.”
John whished dearly that he had brought his gun, the place might seem empty but he had an itch between his shoulder blades, reminiscent of the feeling you get when someone is watching you.
They drank their tea in silence, John even picked up a paper which he tried to read, something about a record breaking Christmas tree being put up.
John breathed in, then out through his nose watching the air escape in a white cloud. He was cold. It was just before Christmas after all and the weather was being its typical grey, miserable self. He looked at the metal downpipe by his side and could see little white crystals of ice covering the surface.
“Tessa, tell the others to search downwards,” Tessa, the police officer closest to him nodded and spoke into the microphone at her shoulder.
The next second he was on him, his own weight toppling them both to the ground and they fell in a pile, riffle crushed between them.
He turned around, he had to go find Sherlock, see that he was ok. He froze in his step. A wail he didn’t know he was the origin of escaped his lips.
John reached the stairs and dragging a hand along the painted concrete wall he started up after their goal. He shook his head trying to clear it, he wished he hadn’t had those drinks, but it had been the only way to stay awake. The wall was cool against his hand and wet from condensation. He ran the last steps not wanting to lose his target from sight.
Sherlock started by telling the same story about Peter Middleton as he had told John a few days ago. After that Mycroft entered the scene and in his stiff, emotionless way told the assembly about the
“John, why won’t you tell me what’s been on your mind recently,” Sherlock was looking at him now from his reclining position; there was something in his voice John thought, something he should recognise. John on the other hand felt paralyzed, like a small rodent caught in the flare of the headlights from a car closing in fast. When he didn’t answer straight away Sherlock gave him a measured look and continued.
Sherlock pulled off, and sucked the head of John’s now completely erected cock. He hummed as he sucked, one hand moving to cradle and massage John’s balls.
“Honestly, Lestrade. You call yourself an inspector.” Sherlock snapped as the culprit was taken away.
“This is Sherlock, Sherlock, Bill and Charlie and…” He looked at the brunette, giggling with Charlie’s date, a tall redhead.
John rocked his hips, before the feeling of Sherlock’s clothed cock became annoying and he broke apart to take off Sherlock’s trousers.
“Sherlock?” John sighed as he was pushed surprisingly gently into the car. Sherlock followed in afterward, slamming the door behind him.
John was currently lying on his bed in the small room provided for him by the rehab center. He had been for the past 3 hours since arriving and his future being in the rehab center currently resigned in his mind and that depressed him even more. He was given a full schedule of therapy sessions, leisure time, activities, and chores he was required to do and although he appreciated that he wouldn’t have spare time to let his thoughts get to him, he was afraid—afraid of something he couldn’t quite put a name too.
John looked over at what Sherlock was so fixed on; the screen was still at the login. John sniggered. Sherlock’s eyes snapped at him.
“Sherlock, yes, like that, perfect, love, that’s perfect.” John emitted as he grinded his hips furiously. “Oh fuck, yes. Sherlock!” He cried out as Sherlock nipped at his throat, a hand having grasped his cock.
The cabbie didn’t respond but pulled out two bottles, a pill in each. He placed them next to each other in front of them.
“See? Now come along John.” Sherlock said, pushing his way past Lestrade and walking into the bedroom, John right behind him.
In the shower, John tried not to think about Sherlock and his oh-so warm lips and the feeling of his hands along his backside. He was growing hard again by just thinking about it and he wanted to go further with Sherlock but he was nervous. He didn’t want to fuck it up but then again he really just wanted to cum with Sherlock. He turned the water to cold and after a few minutes, he was able to finish up showering.
John made his way into the sitting room. Looking at himself in the mirror, he adjusted the collar of his uniform, it being quite a while since he’d worn it. He tugged at the navy coat, trying not to fidget as much, when Sherlock walked in. John looked at him, only to take a double take, his mouth going dry. Sherlock was dressed in a sleek, shiny black tux, his hair lying perfectly around his face. John felt all the blood in his brain go to his lower abdomen, his uniform trousers tightening slightly. Sherlock, having noticed, raised an eyebrow and smirked. John blushed at being caught and shook himself briefly before going up to his partner, placing a kiss on his cheek.
John let a small grin form over his face. “No, we can still share a bed. If you want,” he replied gently.
“Of course it was.” John replied. “It was quite extraordinary.” He smiled at Sherlock, who laughed in return, and gently pressed a kiss to John’s kiss-bitten lips, silently promising for more.
He bucked his hips, and he felt Sherlock move one of his hands to firmly stroke the base of his cock before moving further down. John jerked slightly at the feeling of Sherlock’s fingers at his hole. He briefly noted that Sherlock had pulled off quickly to stick his fingers into his mouth only to place them back at John’s entrance.
The body belonged to a somewhat pudgy, white, middle aged man. He was extraordinary ordinary looking, except for the fact that he was grey as the river from which he had been pulled and slightly bloated from being in the water too long. He was wearing a cheap suit and nothing in the form of identification, they would have to wait for a matching missing person or dental records.
He let his arms enclose John, putting his head in the nape of his neck breathing in the smell of John.
“Just move, move Sherlock,” and Sherlock did move away. He took several steps backwards as he looked at John as if expecting him to suddenly grow horns. John couldn’t handle it, all the dread and despair suddenly bubbled up and he just panicked.
“Of course. I never act unless I am absolutely sure,” Sherlock says and has the audacity to look slightly offended that John could doubt him.
“It is the best Christmas present I have ever gotten,” Sherlock adds sounding sincere and John blushes a bit even if he hates himself for it.
There was the meeting, at the morgue of all places, the astonishment as he realised just what this tall, pale man could do. Looking at the flat together and moving in, everything happening so fast John forgot he was supposed to be sick. Then there is a torrent of running, laughing, tea, and criminals; then of more intimate moments of heated breath, soft kisses, and stolen moment; of Sherlock being brilliant yet utterly ignorant and the two of them teaching each other about life and love.
“It is too bad, you have to look after him you know,” said Lestrade as he put knife and fork neatly on the side of his empty plate wiping his mouth with his napkin.
“Good, you are here,” Sherlock swept in the room, like a tornado, filling the room with that intense energy that followed him around. He discarded his coat on the floor and threw himself down on the coach.
His eyes twinkle for a second and then he says, “It is still wrapped, you will have to open it yourself,” and he makes a small theatrical nod with his head and let go of John’s arm to indicate himself. John feels like he is in free fall and he has a fevered vision of undressing Sherlock right here and now and fucking him senseless into the carpet.
He tried to reach out to help Sherlock up but was stopped by the cold metal of the double barrel aimed at his forehead. The holes in the barrel were black, black as death.
Lestrade nodded, it was John’s decision after all. “I will station an undercover patrol outside your place,” This is not negotiable,” He added, putting on his stern police face when John looked like he would start to argue. Sherlock didn’t bother; this was inconsequential after all.
“I am so sorry Mrs Smith but I just recalled that I have a very important appointment and I need to leave straight away,” He wasn’t sure if the woman was more surprised that he interrupted her or that he was already out of his chair grabbing his jacket from the hanger in the corner before he had finished speaking.
Carpets soft, chair warm, this place here and now. Rain running down the window making patterns on the glass. Chaos theory dictated that they were always different, always new. Where the rain had gone before mattered not; nothing in the past mattered after all.
John opened his mouth, lips looking dry and cracked, but nothing came out sending icy shivers down Sherlock’s spine, what had they done to him?
It was a scar, one of those old ones people used to get when tattoo removal wasn’t fancy lasers which break down the colour pigment but rather were removed with a knife or burned away. Sherlock felt that familiar rush, like the most perfect high, filling him as things shifted and moved in his head, as the pieces of the puzzle started to reveal themselves. These moments were why he did this; when the world sharpened its edges and everything became clear, Sherlock lives.
“Good, you follow behind him and I will move around and cut him off from the other side. Do not let him notice you. We need to catch him with the substance on him; otherwise Lestrade won’t be able to make an arrest. And don’t engage him, he is dangerous.” Before John had time to argue Sherlock was lost in the crowd, his slim figure hidden by a moving wall of flesh.
“It hurts, but that’s no surprise. Everything else seems to be here, so fine I suppose,” Well if you counted fine as sporting cold sweaty palms and a pounding heart. John was scared, more terrified than he remembered having been in a long time. He had screwed up and now Sherlock would tell him to leave and he would have to go back to the bleak existence he had lived before he met Sherlock. He shivered at the thought.
It was too much. Being in the army, there you were someone among many, always in danger just because you were a part of something. Maybe you had no control over what was happening but you tried to survive and do your best and hoped others knew what they were doing. Here someone was after him personally and Sherlock was warm and beautiful and unaware of what the contact was doing to him. It was basic military tactics; don’t fight a war on two fronts at the same time.
“Like you have been hit over the head with a small blunt instrument, probably a police baton, by someone either slightly taller that you or hovering above you,” Sherlock answered and said nothing about tousled hair and glittering eyes which made a familiar warmth spread in his stomach. In response John laughed, one of those laughs which involves the whole body and was absolutely contagious to everyone around. Sherlock smiled, glad John was here and not tied up in a dark room somewhere, or worse.
He crossed the street rummaging in the inner pocket of his coat, earning an angry honk as a car had to brake hard to stop from running him over. Sherlock didn’t even notice, he had only one word running circles in his head; John.
“Mr Holmes, haven’t told you about us then I take it. Well never mind, we are here for your friend, nothing to do with you.”
“There are other cases you know,” Lestrade walked over to Sherlock and pulled the pen from him as he attempted to draw another arrow in the schemata, “When was the last time you slept anyway?”
Off course this was what Sherlock had meant, the case. Why had he believed there had been something else in his voice when the consulting detective had spoken, he stomped a couple of times on a strange feeling that had flared for an instant in his stomach.
“What is that vile thing in your hand?” John jumped as Sherlock suddenly stood beside him, one slim elbow resting on the bar and restless eyes scanning the crowd.
Behind them ran the men clad in dark, any other features was lost in the speed and the sparse lightning. It was as if they shifted to and fro existence as they reached and moved on from the pools of light cast by the yellow street lights.
Right now Sherlock’s mind seems busy elsewhere and John takes advantage of it. He allows his gaze to travel down Sherlock’s outstretched form, from the pale and delicate hand making aimless shapes in the air to where the open coat Sherlock is still wearing has slid apart and is showing a shirt stretched tight over his stomach, the smallest indentation visible where his belly button would be.
Two nights ago Sherlock had shown him the photo and the content of a brown paper package. Inside it was Peter Middleton, in a sense at least. Someone had taken the time and energy to collect all the information they could on the man. So inside the package he was; there where pictures from when he was a child, from his graduation and marriage. Lists of former friends and people he had worked with. The address to where his wife now lived with their daughter, whom he was not allowed to see anymore. There was even John’s name, medical colleague it said next to a photo of himself, stuck to the note with a paperclip.
“Girl trouble I bet, well I have been young once, don’t let an old lady stop you Doctor.” John almost thought she snickered slightly at that.
John willed himself into becoming part of the wall, disappearing into the bricks and the fear from earlier, forgotten in the rush, came crushing back. His breathing seemed thunderous enough to overpower a jet engine. He closed his eyes again and tried a calming technique his therapist had shown him. Slowly breathe in and slowly out again through your nose, focus on your breathing. Slowly in and then out.
“Yes indeed,” Sherlock replied sounding somewhat smug, but then he had the right to be John thought.
John lets his gaze linger a bit longer, taking in the sight in front of him while saying in his own head that this, this is the last time. It is Christmas tomorrow and he has made an early New Years Eve promise to himself, next year he is going to absolutely and most definitely stop obsessing over someone he cannot have. He will give up this ridiculous crush on his best friend, who had stated very clearly that he was not interested in something like this and that his work is everything for him.
“John, I...” Sherlock started and John looked searchingly at him, trying to read his pale face. As always those finely boned features were closed to him; had he doomed himself or were there hope? Sherlock got up, gingerly, and went to stand at his usual spot in front of the window. His shoulders seemed slumped, paisley dressing gown hanging loose.
“Si’, spa’e some chan’e’?” John just shook his head at the tramp huddling at the corner and walked past, intent on his goal.
“No. And there was more than one as well. At least three, the two that grabbed me and someone driving the car,” John looked at Sherlock, still standing too close but none of them made any attempt at moving, he was staring absently into the wall. Now that he knew that John was safe it felt like he could think again and his mind was rushing.
“You want to pay now?” He nodded at John. “I think you should call it a night. Right mate? I will let you finished that though,” He added when John grabbed his beer glass tight. John nodded fussily and immediately regretted it as the world started to swim in front of his eyes.
Suddenly Sherlock coughed, a broken, weak sound and John stopped, eyes wide and hands hovering an inch above Sherlock’s body, back bent in a painful angle. Sherlock cried out in pain as he resurfaced back into consciousness. John hurriedly put an arm behind him, gently helping him sit upright, easing the pressure on this chest.
“Who said both did not want,” Sherlock replies and John doesn’t have any time to compose any form of intelligent reply before Sherlock is pulling him flush, bodies pressed tight and John squirms mortified that Sherlock will feel his eagerness through his trousers.
Putting the kettle on and turning around he found Sherlock on the sofa, hair plastered to his scalp, a puddle of wet carpet on the floor next to him where water was dripping from his hand hanging over the edge.
John curses out loud in his bedchamber, was there anything which passed the brothers by? He continues;
A sudden noise in the ally they had come from forced his eyes open as a new dosage of adrenalin was pumped into his system. Sherlock flattened himself against John, making them both as small as possible; his head was turned so that he could see in the small crack between the dumpster and the wall.
John turned up his tweed collar, stuffed his hands in his pockets and turned his face down from the slight drizzle. He walked, limping slightly, the last few blocks while he went through the medical cases he had dealt with during the day.
He was almost startled when Sherlock suddenly addressed him, while in-between two mouthfuls, “So what is your opinion John?”
It has been going on for almost a week now, the case. At every turn it seemed to grow more complicated and make less sense. Between this and his work at the clinic there were simply no time for such mundane things as sleep, so by now he was exhausted. Sherlock looked bright awake as always, his clothes and hair in perfect order, the man never needed to relax, nevertheless sleep or eat; he was inhuman in that sense.
Nothing was happening, Sherlock lying perfectly still, his skin ever so pale, the red such a stark contrast it was almost beautiful and John lost himself in the motions, blowing, breathing. Twinkling stars in front of his eyes from lack of oxygen, tears making clean tracks across his dusty face. He thought dimly that he would have to give this up soon or faint and hope was falling.
John mentally called himself every name he had ever heard of, starting with stupid and ending with not even fit to be the arse on an arse.
John’s brain, which normally functioned quite satisfactory, short circuited, it simply took this opportunity to be elsewhere. John’s body on the other hand did what it normally did when someone kissed him, it kissed back. His lips parted slightly as Sherlock pressed towards them, his tongue licked John’s lips sending shivers to the rest of his body and his mouth opened on its own accord all the way and he leaned into the kiss. Lips meeting his lips, tongue meeting his tongue.
Sherlock stoked John’s cock and soon he was coming, panting hard, his hands clutching Sherlock’s shoulders.
Sherlock didn’t say anything right away, but spun John around, shoving him gently against the clear window.
“Sherlock.” John said again but was cut off as Sherlock kissed him gently. When he pulled back, Sherlock eyed him up and down. “Okay?” He asked, genuine worry etched on his face.
“Oh, Sherlock, careful. I don’t want you to slip.” John muttered out as Sherlock moved to his neck, gently nipping and sucking at his pulse.
John remained silent, his lips turning up into a smile. He looked away to conceal it but his efforts weren’t needed for the security guard came puffing behind them.
John nibbled at Sherlock’s ear as he continued to bring Sherlock to orgasm. He sucked and nipped around Sherlock’s neck, leaving behind red marks. Soon, Sherlock was clutching him, his teeth sinking into John’s neck as he came.
Sherlock grasped at John’s hair as he sucked and licked. He sucked and licked and smiled at Sherlock’s cock, emitting moans of ecstasy from the detective.
Sherlock looked at him fiercely for a moment, then his face softened slowly, the aggravation being replaced by confusion. He furrowed his eyebrows.
John shook his head as his body shook. He sat up and leaned forward, grabbing Sherlock by his now wrinkled and cum stained shirt and pulled him into a kiss.
This case is a bit creative and will take up about 3 chapters but John will be going through some things; so don't worry, this case is not shadowing John.
At the sound of that, Lestrade’s team all let out noises, muttering to themselves as Donavan scoffed. “Why?” She said.
“Sherlock. Please. Just let me in. It’s going to be all right. Marie will be fine. They obviously love her and care for her-”
Sherlock, his mouth had gone completely dry, nodded, his pupils dilated and his breathing quiet but quick.
And before John could express his worry, the boat lurched over some waves, causing John and Sherlock to ram into each other before falling, John underneath Sherlock.
“Sherlock…” John mumbled as Sherlock moved to John’s neck, licking and sucking, determined to leave a mark.
Sherlock huffed, as he pulled the towel around his shoulders closer as he bent down to shuck off his ruined trousers.
John sighed. “Of course, I’ll wear them Sherlock.” He said softly, titling Sherlock’s head up. “Is this why you made me breakfast? And the whole…shower thing?”
“Oh, yeah, sorry, you’re busy, I can tell, lying on the sofa really calls for a lot of focus.” John responded sarcastically.
John then pushed Sherlock harder against the wall as he moved his hands to Sherlock shirt, unbuttoning it enough to reveal his pale chest. He then began sucking along Sherlock’s chest as Sherlock held onto his uniform tightly. John latched onto one of Sherlock’s nipples, nipping slightly before swirling his tongue. He sucked at his nipple as he moved his hands across Sherlock’s chest, scratching slightly before going back to his arse, slapping him.
"Yes. And food. And I took her to the vet; none of her bones were broken but she did have a cut on her hind leg that the vet took care of.
John held tightly onto Sherlock’s shoulders as he slowly sank himself onto Sherlock’s cock. The two men gasped in pleasure, their breathing the only sound in the cell.
“That was amazing.” He said, smiling as Sherlock’s grumpy expression relaxed. “How did you know?” John asked.
“Did…I mean…would you like to join me on a case? It could be interesting…Lestrade wants me to take a look and I thought maybe…unless you don’t want to then I understand…”
“I want you to ride me.” Sherlock explained slowly, pausing to nibble at John’s ear.  He rocked his hips harder against John’s cock. “As we sit in the back of a police cruiser.” He finished, gripping John’s cock.
John had been quietly reading a novel while sitting in his chair when Sherlock’s phone went off. The detective was sitting at the kitchen table, immersed in his experiment (something with enzymes?) and John looked over seeing Sherlock step away from his experiment, his eyes wide, listening to a rather exhausted person on the other line. Upon finishing, Sherlock said,
“Yes we’re…we’re fine. Everything’s…fine! We’re fine, Molly.” He said as Sherlock began biting his neck and sucking to soothe the bite.
“That’s okay. You can just join me…when you’re tired.” John said, understanding written all over his face. “So…I’ll see you tomorrow morning then?”
The man didn’t know what to say but turned slightly to look at Sherlock for the first time. Their eyes met but neither of them moving. The man was breathing slightly uneven, his eyes glistening and tears falling down his face. The man gulped but didn’t move. Sherlock took this opportunity to ask,
John was currently sitting in the comfort of their hotel’s jacuzzi tub, the steam relaxing his sore legs. They just finished up a case after four days with barely any rest and food and John was finally able to relax. Sherlock was…somewhere John wasn't sure, the heat fogging his brain.
When John went limp, Sherlock pulled off and stood up. He captured John’s lips hard, swirling his semen-soaked tongue with John’s.
“Sherlock-” John began but was caught off when Sherlock stopped suddenly, tugging John inside a room. “Sher-” He tried again, only to be shoved against a desk, the feeling of Sherlock’s lips against his, completely stopping his train of thought.
“No, no, no,” He repeated as a prayer as he fell down besides the lifeless body behind him. He turned him carefully over, blood smeared across his dark curls, smoke rising from his chest where the shotgun had hit at close range. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, his skin pale as ivory.
He looked at it dumbfounded, “It’s a month left to Christmas Sherlock, and usually these things come attached to a gift of some sort.”
Lestrade was suddenly there, looking flushed and out of breath, he must have run up all the stairs from the basement.
He could see the door a few houses down, it was still green. He had not been here in a very long time. He still met Mrs Hudson occasionally, but always somewhere else, a restaurant or a café. They met and talked about the weather, John’s job, or politics. Just not about him.
“That my friend is what we are here to find out,” The door opened with a slight click and Sherlock smiled triumphantly.
“We had no intention of hurting him; if he had just listened and kept calm we wouldn’t have had to,” She had the gall to sound irritated at that.
“We found a grave; they had stumbled upon it during their road building. It was old but not so old that there were not people who should remember it. They tried to hide it, distract us so we would not find it, it was of an era long past anyway. They are practical in that way, maybe war made them like that, and who would it serve to bring these things up again. The people are already dead and nothing can bring them back.”
Sherlock takes the gift and smiles at him and it just kills John, the smile is happy and almost childlike in quality and John suffers a minor heart attack as he forces himself to sit still and not pull Sherlock into a hug and kiss the living hell out of him.
He thumbs the tag over and thinks that, odd, it is his size rather than Sherlock’s. He shakes it and almost misses the note which had been folded up inside. He picks it up and reads,
Sherlock slapped his hand down on the table surface, noise reverberating in the cubicle sized restaurant, prompting an apprehensive look from the short waiter as the sound echoed, “John, focus on what’s important will you.”
John looked at Sherlock, eyes almost begging for forgiveness, not that Sherlock could give it, or anyone really. Sherlock didn’t offer it, far too clever for his own good John thought, this was just something he had to live with.
“Yeah, I think there is no doubt about that one,” Lestrade agreed looking over at Watson. “We should put you in custody for your own safety John. Until this is all over.”
John looks at the anonymous package resting on the table in front of him, “But,” he says. “It’s for you, are you not going to look who it is from at least?”
Sherlock shook his head: “I am sorry John, there is simply no time for that sort of thing right now. We are close to a solution and I need your help to figure this out. In the morning the vase leaves for Santiago and then it will be too late.”
As he turned to go she called after him, “Be sure to phone us Sherlock, for both your sake and that doctor friend of yours.” The threat in her voice was clear as spring water.
“You should thank Sherlock,” Lestrade said and nodded towards him, still gently rubbing his hands up and down John’s arm.
He supposed that maybe this was the reason he felt so protective. John was his after all, this murderer, this man threatening John, it was personal.
She was lying with her arms straight out from her body as if she had been crucified and there was blood pooled around her wrists where huge open gashes still looked red and fresh. John rushed forward, feet turning up dust as he ran over the dirt floor and falling to his knees beside her, feeling her pulse and checking her breath, but to no use. Scattered leisurely around her body where bright newly minted pennies. He shook his head slightly at Sherlock, they were too late.
“He left, I mean he went home maybe a year before,” He paused trying desperately to pull himself back into reality, “Maybe a year before me. He was a field nurse, employed civilian. Ended his contract and left.”
Sherlock looks at him and slowly licks his lips and John almost gives in to his urge to just ignore this trying to do the right thing and just ravish the man, but he holds.
John carefully lifted Sherlock’s head and met his lips. Tongue entering his hot mouth and kissing him deeply as Sherlock kissed back. For a second he lost himself in the kiss as Sherlock’s dick rubbed, head leaking unconsciously against the crook of his hip.
“Tell me about this John,” Sherlock sat up in one fluid motion, he seemed serious and John forgot about neurodegenerative diseases and whatnot. Sherlock’s clear eyes fixed on him and he held out a folded note wrapped in plastic towards him, John took it feeling apprehensive.
Sherlock walked up to the chair, flipped his coat tails back and sat down. The perfect, calm English gentleman on the outside.
Sherlock pulls him close, hands sliding down to grip his arse and John grinds helplessly into his hip as he starts to work Sherlock up and down. Sherlock turn to the side facing him and his lips meet John’s again and it is better than anything John can remember. He lets Sherlock’s dick go and grabs his hips, grinding against him as their mouths fight for possession.
He realised that this running was utterly pointless and felt a bit ashamed, he needed to stop and make a plan, he needed to think. He returned to the flat and waved off Mrs Hudson yet again and started up the stairs.
“Peter calmed down after that, I think he realised what he had done. We returned to base and reported to our superiors. They were busy with more important things of course so Peter was sent home, the young officer relocated and the dead man’s family compensated,” he laughed bitterly, “We were told that it would be best not to mention this unfortunate affair again, after all it had nothing to do with us.”
