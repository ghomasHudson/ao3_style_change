Dean looks down. He hates that Cas won't talk to him. Not like he used to. He misses it, misses him.
Dean finds himself in his room at Bobby’s. He looks around and sees a younger version of himself sitting in the bed, a bottle of whiskey on his hand and a piece of clothing on the other, but he can’t see what it is.
He remembers this day. He had just lost Cas in the lake and the whole day he had tried to play it as if he didn’t care, but when Bobby confront him about it he had locked himself in his room. He had spent the rest of the night crying and thinking of Cas.
They sit in silence going over everything that was said. Cas never thought he would see Dean being so open and Dean… he can’t believe he could be so stupid.
Sam looks at Dean and sees that he’s trying to keep his sobs under control, so he decides to let them talk in private.
Cas is quick to kiss back and Dean can’t stop a moan from scaping. They kiss for a few minutes until they hear someone clearing their throat.
"Not really, but there’s Dean. He was the most important thing to him. Do you think it will work with a person?"
He sighs and tries not to think about it, but he can’t get Cas’ face out of his mind. The way he looked when the Empty took him...
"I can feel them. I can feel my power running through my veins. I feel almost invincible. I feel like I could do anything", he says with a smile on his face.
Dean remembers that day. It was before the Apocalypse. They were planning on killing Raphael and Cas didn't expect to survive, so Dean he had taken to the brothel, just so he wouldn't die a virgin.
“I don’t think I can take it if he gets mad again. Seeing the hate in his eyes. It nearly broke me last time. I don’t-”, he starts tearing up again, “I don’t really have anyone else. Sam and Dean and Jack, they are my family, my only friends. If he- If Dean pushes me away I don’t have anywhere to go”
Tears start welling in his eyes again and he knows that if he keeps talking, his voice will break, so he turns his head.
Sam is sitting by Dean's bed and he's holding his hand. Cas has gone out to let them a few minutes alone (after a little begging from Sam's part).
“I didn’t even say goodbye to Sammy, I just… I gave him the kit and told him bring me back. And then I saw Billie, and she knew, she knew I didn’t want to come back, but she said it wasn’t my time, that we had work to do”
“After that... conversation, I left. I couldn’t bare seeing the hate in his eyes every time he looked at me. But then I had to come back. We needed to deal with Chuck and we can’t do that if we don’t work together. So I returned, and he still hated me. I had hoped that some time apart might have been good for us, but it only made things worse”
"Yeah..." Cas swallowed dryly, his heart skipping a few beats. "I... I'm afraid, Dean. I don't know anything about raising a human child."
Castiel could see that Dean's cogs were turning and he needed to talk to him without it being too suspicious. "You should come closer if you're interested in more."
Cas was sitting at the edge of the water, snow surrounding him, like he had been sitting there, unmoving, for a very long time.
His friend drew him into another hug. "I'm glad to have you back, Cas," Sam whispered, then drew back, patting him on the arm before leaving him alone with Dean.
Cas watched him turn around and walk back to the set, and he needed a few deep breaths to calm his racing heartbeat. He tried to think about something unsexy to will away the almost erection, before he walked back to the set.
"Yeah," Dean said as he nodded, bringing his lube drenched digit to Cas's hole. The heat radiating was intense. Inviting. He gently started rubbing the lube over the puckered flesh.
The tweedle demons came in, on the freakin’ second. Dean groaned even louder, rocking back and forth for good measure.
Cas was clearly surprised hearing that, staring at him for a few moments with parted lips. He shook his head then and sighed. "Don't say that if you don't mean it, Dean. I can't do this again."
Dean shook his head, letting out a breathy laugh, as though he was processing everything in amazement. “How long does that take?”
Cas looked really uncomfortable now. "I am sorry... Yes, we have to do it again. I would... understand if you... don't want to though... That wasn't what we talked about."
"In the library. His name is Sandalphon. Suit, ugly trench coat. Can't miss him." Bobby nodded at the door, dismissing him.
“Oh yeah, tell me what you’re wearing.” Dean cringed at how dirty that sounded, but the way Cas laughed it was totally worth it.
Cas breathed out a relieved smile. "Yeah... Please," he replied as he leaned in closer, closing the gap to Dean's lips with a soft kiss. A kiss that quickly turned more heated as he wrapped his arm around Dean, sliding his other hand into Dean's short hair. He just knew he would never want to let go of Dean again.
Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He didn’t really know why Cas wanted him, but he felt exactly the same.
Castiel laughed at that. “I actually hadn’t thought about the impact that could have before you just mentioned it. It’s not the first time I’ve played a gay man. But the other show I was on wasn’t a prime time soap, and also, it was full of gay characters. So, I was just one of many."
Dean nodded as he sucked on Castiel's earlobe. "No good having a dengel if it won't survive." He wrapped his legs around Castiel's waist as he hopped into his arms. "When they open the door, we charge." Dean let out a soft groan into his ear.
Cas gave him a barely there smile before he nodded. "Yes, let's go." He touched Dean's shoulder for a second, hoping the action looked like a concerned mother hen, before he started walking up the road.
Cas frowned as he looked at Dean. "Are you telling me... we should..." He rubbed his hand over his neck. "Try to enjoy it?"
Castiel couldn’t agree more with that sentiment, and as he reveled in the feeling of Dean’s solid warmth pressed against him, he began humming absentmindedly.
It was really annoying because he had sworn to himself to never start anything with a guy again. Men were assholes. Every one of his exes had cheated on him. Not that he had a lot of luck with women either, but all of his life he had fallen for guys a lot quicker than he had for women, and it always ended up with him left being heartbroken.
"Sure, that would be helpful." He stepped closer to Dean, right into his personal space. "You didn't answer my question. Is the coffee any good? Because I really had a rough night."
Cas sighed, already missing the closeness. "That sucks… you must think that I'm pathetic, still being hung up on this guy."
Sam pulled away and ran his hand through his hair. "He's here. I only got back yesterday, and I'll be honest with you, man… he's not doing great."
Dean swallowed dryly as he read the next step. He turned in the chair to face Cas. “I, uh… stretch you. With my fingers.”
He’d then insisted on reading out the show’s description in a fake announcer’s voice, and Dean tried to pretend he wasn’t interested. “
The angel was breathing hard, his expression contorted in confusion. The purple lines were completely gone and it was evident Castiel was in full control again. "What?"
“Are you saying I’m annoying?” Castiel put on a fake offended expression and shook his head, before smiling at Dean.
“The series I was talking about… Dr. Sexy is my guilty pleasure, too. I know the plot is ridiculous but I can’t seem to stop. Especially now that Dr. Sexy and Dr. Dan are flirting all the time. And I just wish they would kiss already.” There was a little pause where Dean could hear Cas catching his breath. “I can’t believe we both love that show.”
If there was still a human side of that man, he wanted to comfort that. Maybe this had been the thing he had been feeling when they were having sex before.
The angel – Dean suddenly remembered was named Castiel – pressed his palm down over Dean's mouth, silencing him. Blue eyes were staring intently at Dean before Castiel used the finger of his other hand to roughly push it inside as he brought Dean against the door. Castiel slowly dragged away his hand, eyes still fixated on Dean.
Immediately Castiel let go of the iron bars, next to him in a matter of seconds. His face was contorted with worry as he grabbed Dean's shoulder. "Dean, are you alright?"
2019 has been full of ups and downs, not least the recent depressing election result here in the UK. BUT... one of the absolute highlights was getting to meet Frankie and Any in the flesh. What a whirlwind of a weekend that was! 😀 Another high point has been meeting and getting to know Trex; sadly not in person, but online is the next best thing. It’s been such a pleasure getting to know you all better, getting to write with you all, plus getting to read all of those fics before anyone else. (Beta’ing certainly has its perks). I feel truly lucky to count the three of you as my friends, and I love how our conversations can go from loving to funny, to bizarre, and back again. Plus the occasional obligatory burst of Misha spam.  Anyway, helping to create this advent calendar has been so much fun, and I hope our readers have enjoyed reading it as much as we’ve enjoyed writing it.
Dean nodded as he reached out for a box of Trojans and then pulled his hand back. "Guess we only need the lube."
He rubbed the back of his hand over his cheek to wipe away the tears before he opened the door for Dean, letting him in. He quickly closed the door behind him again. Just in case.
The Empty sank to its knees, sheer terror reigning over his face. "Noooo, stop. Please. I can't listen to this anymore."
Cas gave him a wry smile. "Put 'way too trusting' on top of it, and you get the perfect idiot that keeps falling for other people's bullshit. Like, 'I had a late work night' or 'I was just out with my mates'."
Sam appeared conflicted as he replied, "Yes, and no. Just…" He grabbed the cuff of Cas's trench coat and pulled him down the stairs. "He's gonna be happy to see you, dude."
They had the highest rated show in their timeslot, and Dean and Sam were getting a pretty penny after the most recent negotiations. He was sure that was why they took the show in the direction they did; separating the brothers in the show to branch out. To introduce new characters, and specifically to take a huge step in representation.
Dean was standing next to his brother, talking to him as he walked up to both of them. He had already met Sam before, who seemed like a very nice and calm guy. "Hey," he greeted them.
His instinct had countered the witch's spell in the past, his grace reacting to the demonic presence and smiting it despite the spell forcing him to need to breed any creature in his vicinity.
the life of the party. Balthazar is the fireworks that fizzle out after twenty seconds of loud screeches and pops."
He failed. His mind was already at the bunker, alone with Dean, and he felt like he was dying inside, melting into a pool of nervousness for what was about to happen. His mind just couldn't imagine it. Couldn't imagine being sexual with Dean.
Cas gasped against him before he parted his lips further, his tongue finding Dean's as he licked into Dean's mouth with a deep moan.
The cashier's eyebrows raised, but he didn't say anything further. As they made their way out of the store and back to the car, Dean gently grasped Cas by the elbow. "Do you… would you rather do this with someone else?"
Simon Losechester is out of commission for at least a month after a particularly brutal showdown with a coven of powerful witches. In fact, over half of the hunters are on bed rest or desk duty, so when an opportunity to partner with Heaven, and bring a couple of angels on their payroll, presents itself, there isn’t really a choice. While some of the hunters are excited, Dan Losechester is anything but, and his new partner Sandalphon, sounds like a real dork.
Dean scoffed and folded his arms over his chest. “I mean, if you’re that much of a coward you run right back because I won’t kiss your ass, then go right ahead.”
Castiel knew now that he had to try his plan. For one thing, it would be fun to see how a cosmic entity would react, and also, he knew that Dean would be so proud of him. Even if he never found out what Castiel had done, the thought of it was good enough.
"Are you sure, Dean? Because there's one more featuring yours truly," the black-clothed jerk said, small smirk gracing his smug face.
And suddenly all thoughts were gone. Dean lost himself to the same pleasure that was consuming his best friend. As he started chasing that intense sensation, his arms bracketed around Cas's head and Dean braced his forehead to Cas's own.
Cas didn't sound too sure about it, so Dean quickly backtracked. "Nah, I'm only pulling your leg. But, dude… pie. You'll have to let me taste some one day."
Dean swallowed Cas’s whimper as he continued to kiss him. He stroked Cas until the last pulse painted them both. As Dean drew back for a moment, in an attempt to catch his breath, he couldn’t help but look at Cas in amazement. “Fuck,” Dean breathed out through a laugh.
Good thing Castiel didn’t date men, because Dean was pretty sure he’d be bad for business. “Let me take you to dinner, as a ‘welcome to the family’ gesture.”
Even Crowley sucked in a breath at that. "Brutal, my friend. I may have always favored you over your brother, but even I would have been appalled at that bit of delivery, right there."
"That's okay," Dean said, trying to hide his disappointment. "I like when actors play outside their sexuality."
Nodding, Sam started walking through the bunker, leading Castiel to the wing where they slept. Stopping at Dean's door, his friend gave him a reassuring smile and rapped his knuckles on the wood.
Deans breath caught in his throat at the beauty of it all. He lifted a hand to gently cup and caress Cas’s cheek. “Silly angel.”
Fixing him with a glare of her own, the witch stepped towards him. “Ye watch your mouth, Fergus, or I’ll turn you into a frog. I don’t know how you expect me to work under these conditions; I don’t even have all the ingredients.”
The soft hitches in Cas's breathing sounded sexy as hell. One of Cas's hands reached up and wrapped around Dean's bicep, holding on. His wide blue eyes were still on him, looking surprised and almost… lustful. "Dean… I think I can take more."
"Unless what?" Cas asked, not looking at him. His voice was husky, and Dean just knew if his friend still had his wings he would be off by now. Cas turned around and went back to the bed, sitting down with a deep sigh.
"That is enough," he commanded almost softly before sinking to his knees in front of Dean. He cupped Dean's face and pressed a gentle kiss to his lips. "Turn around."
He knew it was all about making the contestants feel relaxed and open, but he still couldn't help but feel nervous as hell. His hands were sweaty, and not for the first time, he asked himself why he was doing this to himself.
Instead of pulling them on, Cas buried his hand in Dean's jacket pocket with a sigh. "I didn't even realize it was snowing," he breathed out, white fog coming from his lips before he looked up at the sky. Snowflakes landed on his eyelashes and hair, decorating his angel in white fluffy stars.
There was this decidedly delectable rush Dean felt whenever he wielded the blade, like the build up to the top of a rollercoaster, or the climax of an orgasm. There was a reason lab rats, when given the choice between pleasure and food, starved. Dean wasn’t cocky enough to believe he was somehow better than a rat. Deep down, at the end of the day, every creature shared one thing in common, the penchant to submit to their base, animalistic instincts.
"Fuck," Dean gasped out, he clenched again and stilled his movement, fully seated on Castiel's girth. "The hell is that?"
When Dean was out of earshot, Balthazar stepped closer. "Look, all I wanted to say is that I'm sorry how things ended. I was never brave enough to come out to you as poly, and I should have done that from the beginning. I just hope you can forgive me and that we can get along on this gig."
Dean made a sound that Cas couldn’t describe, but he knew it was one of happiness. “What happens now?” he asked, breathlessly. “Man, I can’t believe this is happening.”
"You can, I friggin' pinky promise, but don't you wanna get outta here?" he breathed out, trying to get the angel to shift him against the door, if Dean could just get some of the bind against the rusted metal of the handle.
The words were caught in his throat, so instead of answering, he grasped Cas’s hand again and squeezed. He finally managed to nod.
Dean could make out a silhouette against the frosted glass. Cas was clearly leaning against it, so Dean got up from the couch with his beer and leaned against the glass from the other side. “Tell me more about you,” Cas asked softly.
Dean's dick twitched in response and he had to stifle his own groan. He started fucking the digit into Cas's hole, itching to know how that was going to feel.
Castiel wasn't sure where Dean was going with this. He had thought the plan was to tell Crowley they had been successful, so he would open the door. He nudged Dean, giving him a questioning look, hoping he would get it.
Cas stepped closer, his eyes never leaving Balthazar's as he hesitantly reached out and stroked over the hard muscle.
In the end it took closer to twelve hours, and it was two a.m. when he finally arrived. Five different people had stopped and driven him a few miles, and he’d also walked some of the way too. By the time he knocked on the door he was exhausted, but delighted to be back.
The angel seemed to hesitate for a second before he suddenly jumped Dean, and grabbed his throat in an iron grip, pinning him against the metal bars. He nudged his nose against Dean's cheek and inhaled deeply. "Human," he whispered hotly before he licked over Dean's cheek.
“He’s not here. He’s not here. He’s gone. You saw him. You saw that thing take him away. He’s gone. He’s gone...”
. He looks over at Cas and rans a hand over his cold cheek. He hears the crying sound again but this time it sounds familiar.
He seats by Dean's bed and takes his other hand. He stays for two hours before he tells Cas that he's leaving again to keep researching. Cas just nods at him. He knows Sam feels sorry and is doing everything he can to help his brother, but Cas is still a little pissed at him.
"You don’t have to apologize. He was... He was family. You lost him too. I should be the one apologizing. I haven’t been here for you. It’s just that..."
“Heaven is dying. And it hasn’t been my home for years. Since the moment I met Dean. I guess I don’t really have a home”
He thinks of all the “moments” they’ve shared. So many moments that could have turned into something else if he wasn’t such a coward. If he didn’t choose to bury his feelings. Maybe Sammy was right and he should talk to Cas. Make him understand before it’s too late. With that in mind, he leaves his room and goes to Cas’ but, when he gets there, he hears voices inside. It’s Cas and other Dean.
He starts looking around for a way out. He finds the door to the corridor and runs out of this room where he still can hear his own sobs.
“Hey, you’re not a tool. I need you for you. Because you’re family. Because I care. I need you because- because I love you, Cas”
“We’ll explain everything later, but first we need to figure out why you’re here and how to send you back”
With this, he starts thinking of who can help him with this. Cas obviously can't, or won't, he'll stay with Dean until he wakes up, but perhaps there's someone else who can help him.
“Then you know we have to beat him. And then, once he’s gone, we will bring Cas back. We’ll find a way”
Dean hears his brother and, even though he doesn’t want to talk to anybody, this is his little brother. And he needs him. He needs to be there for him. Slowly, he turns his head, his hands never leaving Cas’ face.
“I’m sorry it took me so long. I’m sorry it took me this long to understand. I’m so sorry. I love you. I love you so m-”
“Yeah, I just… I felt awful. I felt guilty about how I treated Jack. I couldn’t even look at him without getting angry. All I could see was you- you laying on the ground with… with your w- your- wings… your wings burnt on the floor”
“He didn’t. He told me... He said that what he knew he couldn’t have what he wanted”, he says as tears form in his eyes, “He thought that I didn’t...”
He breaks down and stars sobbing loudly. Sam hugs him again, this time holding his brother tightly while he buries his face on his shoulder.
"I don’t know. But I don’t want to sleep. I need to check on you. I need to know that you’re okay. That you...", he’s stopped by another yawn.
’ crap, being a prophet and all… He was just a kid and they had gotten him into this craziness, they had gotten him killed. No,
Cas looks at them and can’t help the smile that shines on his face. He knows how much Dean blames himself for her death.
Dean feels like he might throw up. They all sit down to talk about this and Sam is the first to talk.
“Cas”, he starts as he caresses his cheek again, “they can wait a little more”, and he finally puts his lips on Cas’.
He doesn’t know if Dean can understand anything he’s saying as his voice is full of emotion. He tries shaking his shoulder, but Dean just keeps looking down, tears running down his cheeks.
Once in the hallway, he closes the door and he thinks that’s it, but he hadn’t count on his mind tricking him. He could run from that room, but he couldn’t run from the memories on his head.
"I’m sorry, but it’s true. He wanted to have a child so he could have more power. But we- we locked him away in an alternative universe you opened."
Just then, he hears a sob and sees tears running down his other self’s face while holding the clothing tighter.
He places one arm behind his knees and the other one behind his neck, and stands up. He starts walking to the car. Sam opens the backseat door so he can place Cas’ body there. To his surprise he gets in the back with him, placing his head on his lap.
“I think there will be other books devoted to the Empty,” Eileen added, gently rubbing a thumb across the page. “Maybe even in the same crisp condition.”
"And that's what to believe in. I'll be here. Well. Nearly as close as this." Jack put a hand on his heart, and Sam couldn't contain his tears any longer. He was leaving them for the greater good, as he was always supposed to do. So, why did it seem so erratic?
Cas didn’t really react. He sat, frozen, in his seat, fingers white from clenching. Yet, Dean observed how his eyebrows slightly arched in the middle and ultimately failed to contain hopefulness when he said softly:
"It's a hell of a time to bail," Dean said. He involuntarily clenched his jaws and looked Jack straight in the eyes. Everything, almost everything returned to normal; it was a wrong time for another grand escape from God. "A lot of people are counting on you, people with questions. They're gonna need answers."
Three minutes. The signal broke through the pounding in Dean's ears and forced him to pick up speed. He saw the light turning from the faint dot into the shimmering light and mentally prayed to Cas just to hold on.
The Shadow looked content, even satisfied, as it put its hands in the pockets. Scrutinizing the borrowed face, Dean swiftly realized that there was neither time nor point in fighting. Through the gritted teeth, he muttered: "Fine."
He turned to Dean with a half-smile. Facing away from the sun, with an almost celestial crown of light around his head, he appeared far from being a human. Dean involuntarily questioned the statements about his fading grace, even though he had witnessed it himself. Yet the dark blue of the eyes was so recognizable and dear that he wanted to believe.
Another vision, this time in a playground, his mother holding the man’s hand and he saving her from another woman.
He’s lost. Usually he would drink out his pain, convincing himself of the idea that at least he had saved Sammy, but now? Now his brother had told him that he wouldn’t save him, making it clear that he doesn’t care anymore.
After three hours of looking through books they haven’t found anything. So Cas puts his book down and turns to Sam and Dean.
“And I will spend my life making you understand how much I love you and that you deserve some happiness”
And with that he leans in and pulls him down for a passionate kiss. Dean puts his hands on his waist and pushes their bodies together, wanting to feel as close as possible.
“So apparently we just need to stand were we arrived and after you throw the potion, we say these words and we should get back home”
“I feel like I lose you when you push me away. Every time I start to believe that maybe I really belong here, with you… then something goes wrong and you lash out at me”
Cas looks at Dean with doubt but he thinks that maybe Dean is right. Maybe it will be good for them. For their relationship.
There’s another knock and he gets up and opens the door to scream at his annoying little brother but, as soon as he opens the door, he falls to his knees and buries his face on his hands.
Sam goes inside, looking for the Nephilim. He’s trying not to think about what just happened. He knows he should stay with Dean and comfort him, but he doesn’t have the strength at the moment. He goes into the master room and sees Kelly’s body on the bed; she looks so peaceful. He hears a noise coming from the corner of the room. He gets closer and sees a young man in his 20s sitting on the floor with his knees to his chest and his head on his knees. The boy senses him and looks up, his golden eyes staring with curiosity into Sam.
“Jack. He got me out and asked my help in restoring Heaven. We’ve created the Heaven you deserve, although I wasn’t expecting you to enjoy it so soon”
He’s feeling excited now. He needs to tell Dean. He approaches him and places a hand on his shoulder.
“He doesn’t love me”, he scoffs, “I’m just a tool to him. And now, without my powers, I’m of no use to him. Why would he keep me around? I’m broken”
"Please, let me know if you find anything. I’m not sure he can take this much longer. It’s almost been two days... Just... Let me know."
"Okay, I’ll tell you. But try to keep your emotions in control. Your mother... Kelly, she... She died giving birth to you. I’m sorry. I-"
“We don’t know”, tells them other Sam, “We were driving when suddenly we appeared here. What’s going on? Who’s Chuck? And what do you mean other universes?”
"Cas, please, come back. I need you. You know that. I told you once before and I meant it. Please, don’t leave me", he knows he’s rambling now. Probably not making sense, but he couldn’t care less, "You know, I never apologized for beating you up when I had the mark. I almost killed you and I wasn’t brave enough to tell you how awful I felt. I- I’m so sorry, Cas!"
But it's too late, the memories come with force and he remembers every time he has let Dean down. Ruby, leaving for Stanford, the demon blood, not telling him about the hallucinations, not looking for him in Purgatory... After thinking about everything they've been through together an idea comes to him.
Tears keep falling down his cheeks and he can’t help it. He hasn’t allowed himself to think about Cas’ death until now, but he was his friend to.
"It’s okay to feel the way you do. You’ve lost so many people... But this time... This time is different. You’ve never lost someone like Cas. What you two had..."
Sam looks at Dean and they both get up and go to the hallway but, while Sam heads to the library, Dean stops at his room to check on Cas.
Dean feels tears in his eyes and he feels his throat closing up, but he has to tell him. Cas squeezes his hand and moves closer.
Dean looks at Cas in the eyes and, slowly, brushes their lips together. When he leans away, Cas puts a hand on his neck and pushes him in into another kiss. This time is deeper, desperate, trying to show how much they love each other.
Dean is now sitting in a motel bed and the floor is full of empty bottles of beer and whiskey. He doesn’t think he’s ever drunk this much but, who cares? Apparently no one does so, why stop? He takes another bottle of whiskey and starts drinking. He knows he should stop, but he can’t remember why. He has nowhere to go, no one to get back to, so he keeps drinking. He’s always buried his feelings in alcohol and he’s not gonna change now. At some point, he decides to take out his phone and tries to dial Sammy’s number, but he stops himself from doing it. He said he doesn’t want anything from him anymore, so he won’t bother him. He places the phone in the table and keeps drinking. He really should stop drinking. He’s starting to feel numb but, that’s the point, right? to stop feeling?
“I don’t love Cas. Not in that way. But I don’t want him to be with anyone in that way. That’s so selfish. I just want him to be happy… happy... with me. Oh!”
Crowley opens his mouth to make an annoying retort but, before he can say anything, Sam rolls his eyes and keeps going.
"Don’t try to deny it, Dean. I know you. I saw how you two acted around each other. You cared about him. You liked him. You-"
One he gets to the bunker, Sam goes right to the library. There are hundreds of books spread over the tables but he hasn't found anything useful.
Sam watches as his brother breaks down over his angel’s body. He doesn’t think he can come back from this. This time he is truly broken. He needs to do something. Suddenly, he gets an idea.
After Sam turns in for the night, Dean and Cas stay in the kitchen for a while. Cas tells Dean about the djinn he killed the other day and Dean listens with a smile on his face.
They move towards the end of the room and when Dean feels the table at his back he sits on it and wraps his legs around Cas while running his fingers through his hair. Cas lets out a moan and pushes closer, deepening the kiss.
“Easier? Cas, how could you- It wasn’t easier. In fact, it was worse than ever. We finally had the courage to get our head out of our asses and admit our feelings and that fucking thing took you away. Took you from me!”
Cas is getting worried. Dean should have called by now, or texted, but hasn’t done either. He decides to look in Sam’s mind to see if he can find why he left. He knows he promised to stop looking into their thoughts, but he needs to know.
“So, we’ve been talking and, as we haven’t found anything that can help us...”, other Dean looks at Cas, “we could just all live here together”
A door appears in front of him and he walks into the hallway. There, he falls to his knees and starts sobbing loudly.
Sam and Jack are in the library doing research. They had found a book that mentioned a resurrecting ritual. It was a long-shot but, right now, that’s all they could do. Dean hadn’t left Cas’ side since they got to the bunker and Sam had to force him to eat and go to the bathroom. He refused at first but, in the end, he was able to get him to eat and clean himself. Still, he wouldn’t do anything unless Sam was there telling him over and over again to look after himself. He just sat by Cas’ side, holding his hand. Sometimes he would talk to him but other than that, he hadn’t said a word.
Dean kisses his forehead, his temple, his eyelids, his nose, his cheeks and when he reaches his lips he pulls away enough to look into his eyes.
"Dean. Please, look at me. I need you to look at me. I- Please, I need to tell you something. It’s important. Don’t shut me down. I know you are feeling broken and you are hurting, but don’t shut me down. I need you here."
. Instead, he goes to his room but, on his way there, he passes by Cas’ room. He enters and sees that it’s empty.
“Dean, it’s okay. I know you don’t like to talk about these things”, he says as he takes a sip of his beer.
Cas' eyes seem about to cry but then, in a second, his stare hardens and any track of hurt is gone, a blank expression taking place.
Cas crushes their lips together and, at first, Dean is too shocked to respond but then, Cas brushes his tongue over his lip and he sighs and opens up for Cas. They kiss for a while, hands touching wherever they can reach, legs and arms tangled so they can get as close as possible. That is, until they hear Sam clearing his throat from the door.
And then he leans in, sealing their lips together in a kiss full of love and emotion. He can’t stop the tears falling down his face. Cas wipes them out with his hand and leans his forehead against Dean’s.
"CAS!”, he sobs, "Why did you have to go against Lucifer? I know you just wanted to do the right thing but... You always tried to do the right thing and it always ended up with you dead, hurt or... I just... I- I need you to come back. Come back to me. Cas... Cas... Please, please, please..."
“And then, when I tried to talk to you one last time, you blamed me for basically everything that’s gone wrong in your life. And still, you dare to get mad because I left. What did you expect me to do? I couldn’t stand being your punching bag anymore!”
“For now. But I know that what you really want is to go to sleep. So I’ll make you a deal. You let me take Cas back and we leave you alone. If you refuse, I’ll keep waking him up. For eternity. You’ll never sleep again. Your choice”
Dean is standing still, eyes watering, watching as his brother’s world crashes down. That was one of the worst feelings he’s ever experienced. The feeling of incapacity, of not being able to help his little brother.
“Okay, I can do this. Cas, you deserve so much better. I know lately I’ve been treating you like... like I don’t care, but I do. I care and when you left it- it hurt. But I’m trying to be better. With everyone, but specially with you. Because you deserve everything you want and more. You’re the most amazing person I’ve ever known. You are family, I need you to know that. Even if I get mad sometimes, you’ll always be my family”
"Cas, please. Don’t leave me again. I can’t- I don’t think I can survive it. It’s been less than a day and I’m already a mess. Please, please, please. I love you. I can’t- I need you. Please, please, don’t leave me."
“He’ll be here when his time comes. But as I said, time is different here, so it won’t feel as long for you”
He finds himself in a playing yard but how is it possible? He looks around and sees a little boy that reminds him of himself. A man wearing an old cap approaches the kid and, when he turns, Dean recognizes him.
Cas turns his head and kisses one of Dean’s hands. Dean gasps and he can’t wait anymore, so he launches forward and kisses him.
Cas stares at Dean, trying to analyze what is going on in his head. He sees that Dean is hurting, but it doesn't make sense.
“Because. I’m not- I don’t deserve-“, he remembers what Cas told him and he knows he was right, he has low self-esteem, “Why... Why didn’t he tell me before? We didn’t have time. I didn’t have time. I couldn’t even tell him. He was gone before I could even process what had happened. He didn’t know...”
“I know I fucked up. And maybe it’s too late but I just… I felt like you needed to know. I wanted you to know”
Dean doesn’t listen, or doesn’t care. He doesn’t turn to look at his brother, he just keeps rocking Cas’s body.
All Dean can see is what happened so many years ago to his mum. He saved his little brother then and he will save him again. He runs in, grabs his brother’s arm and forces him to get out of there.
Sam tries to think how he can tell him what happened and avoid him getting pissed and doing something dangerous.
They are laying in bed, Dean sleeping with his head on Cas’ chest and his arm across his torso, when Cas feels it. Sam has arrived.
Dean buries his face in his neck and holds him tighter. After a while, he manages to control his tears and leans back so he can look at Cas.
They get in their car and Cas drops the potion on the floor while the other Sam says the spell. Suddenly, a cloud of smoke starts forming in the map room and when it finally leaves, they are gone.
He’s sobbing hard now. He doesn’t think he can feel more pain but it keeps getting worse. His mind has decided to remember every single moment he had disappointed his angel, every time he had hurt him.
Dean does as he’s told and he can feel his breathing starting to calm down and Cas gets up to bring him a glass of water. Dean follows him with his eyes, making sure that he’s not leaving.
Dean can’t stop thinking about those moments. When he had lost one of the most important people in his life and he couldn’t do anything about it. He remembers the depression, the alcohol –so much alcohol... And to top it all, he had to lay low because the fucking leviathans were after them. Those were tough times. But then... He remembers when he saw Cas –or Emmanuel, actually– and he didn’t recognize him. That... that hurt. But then, he still left everything he knew to help him, and he didn’t even know they were friends. Friends... They are more than friends.
Dean doesn’t understand how he can have missed that. How he didn’t see how much Cas was suffering because of him. Because of his inability to express his feelings.
Sam pulls back to look at his brother and sees that he is crying too. Damn it! He’s so broken. I shouldn’t have let him found me like this.
Dean puts his hands on his butt to push him closer and they both climax while moaning the other’s name.
"No, it’s not! It’s not okay! You died, Cas. You died! You died and I couldn’t- I didn’t- Please, don’t do it again."
“I tried to reach out to you for days. I apologised and you ignored me. You sent me to Hell with that… abomination, as if you couldn’t care less what could happen to me, only to get mad at me when I had to kill a demon wearing my son’s corpse”
“You’re infuriating, Dean. You’re so frustrating. You never say what you feel. Or what you really want. You’ve treated me like I mean nothing to you. You broke my heart. And you've hurt me. You've done things that still make me get angry at you”
Cas runs his hands over his chest, causing Dean’s nipples to harden, before pulling him down by his neck to kiss him and rub their crotches together. This makes Dean let out a moan and move his hips faster.
With that he picks up his books and goes into his room. Cas decides he has to find Dean, so he tries calling him to his cellphone, but it goes straight to voicemail. He didn’t have a choice. He had to use his powers, even though they were nearly drained. He concentrates in Dean and he senses him in a motel downtown. He has to get there as soon as possible, thankfully, he had the car he used to get to Lawrence.
It wasn’t the first time he lost him, it must have been at least the fifth. Hell, it wasn’t even the first time Lucifer killed him. But, somehow, this time felt different, more final. It’s the first time he sees the wings burnt on the ground.
“Yes, I do. I tried to tell you a few times, but we were always interrupted. Not this time. You need to know. When I... When Chuck told us that he had been planning our whole life, that every choice I thought I had made hadn’t even been a choice, I was mad. I was fucking pissed. And the more I thought about it the angrier I got. And I’m sorry I took it out on you. But every time I thought about you, I thought
Cas kisses him then and Dean can hear his heart in his ears. Cas pulls back and Dean looks at him with wide eyes, before he lifts his hands, caressing his cheek with one hand and running his fingers through his hair with the other.
Cas feels a wave of rage and he turns to look Dean in the eye. At his harsh stare, Dean takes a few steps back.
Dean hates how Cas has just given up on them. He had hoped that, after his prayer and their short talk in Purgatory, they would be fine but now he realises that it won’t be that easy.
He doesn’t see Sam going in the house. He feels numb. He falls to his knees next to his... next to Cas. He is in shock.
Dean is in the hallway again. He hates this place. He’s reliving his worst memories over and over again. He doesn’t think he can handle this for much longer. After the door to Hell... he thought he would finally break but then he heard Cas’ voice.
. And then he said that you were the only being in all the universes he couldn’t control and I felt like a fucking dick. All the things I said... I’m so sorry, Cas”
“I know, Dean. But I feel like it was always in the middle of a world-ending crisis, never because you wanted to tell me. It was basically forced out of you. And you’ve pushed me away so many times…”
Cas knows, of course he knows, that Dean is starting to spiral, so he puts a hand on his forearm to reassure him that it’s okay, that he can tell him anything.
Now is Sam’s turn to look wide eyed at his brother. He didn’t think that his brother would admit it. He thought he would have to convince him or something.
He follows the sound to Cas’ room, just right across the hall. He finds his little brother sobbing on the floor. He crouches down next to him and brings him into a hug. Sam brings his arms around his brother’s body and Dean holds him tighter.
He sees Dean resting his right cheek on his hand, the one that’s holding Cas’. Sam decides to let him rest.
Dean is watching all of this and he can feel a tear running down his face. He hasn't thought about this moment for so long. He remembers feeling betrayed by Sam, he thought they would always be there for each other but he just left him behind while he was trying to start a new life. He remembers getting really mad and wishing he could go with him but dad needed him, he had to stay with him. He remembers feeling completely alone, even though he had dad, but Sammy was his little brother and he had to protect him. That was the first time he felt like Sammy didn't need him anymore and that had hurt him more than he had ever admitted. A door appears in front of him and he opens it.
Cas looks at him and Dean has difficulties finding his voice. When he can finally talk, he speaks in a quiet voice.
Cas looks in the box again and sees the mixtape Dean had recorded for him, a few pictures of them he didn’t know existed and a letter.
They smile at each other and Dean can feel his heart drop. But when he sees the other Dean lift his hand to brush Cas’ cheek he turns around and sits down in the other side of the room.
Just as he is about to ask Sam about the visions he sees a house, the man and his mother are in the same room he is in now. His mother is trying to build some furniture and is getting frustrated but then the man enters the room and she relaxes. She trusted the man.
And the only reason he was even in this position in the first place was because some black-eyed bitches just so happened to run into him while he was fucked up on ayahuasca.
"That's true. Having a bisexual main character in this genre doesn't happen often enough... or ever. Shit, at the moment I can't even think of an example..." Castiel rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Nope, nothing comes to mind."
The man nodded and Cas couldn't help but feel extremely excited, happy but also nervous. What if Dean didn't like him when he saw him? "I'll see you in a moment, Dean. They’re letting us meet."
Dean braced an elbow next to Cas as he took himself in hand and made his way forward. His heart was hammering against his chest. This was it. He and Cas were about to cross a line.
And there it was. The patented bitch face. "No, my body is like a normal human male body, Dean. Except that I don’t need to bother with food and other things to maintain it.”
Cas rolled his eyes before he stepped closer. "Dan, I could check your body for illnesses and heal you. You just need to let me touch you."
An uncharacteristic smirk played over his conterfeit's features as he sneered. "Well, well, well. Finally had your happy moment. I hope it was worth it."
The angel dragged his lips over Dean’s cheek towards his lips, before he softly bit his lower lip, licking over it to soothe the bite. Castiel groaned deeply and Dean could feel a second finger pushing into him. “Breeding… Spell,” he gasped into Dean’s ear. “Can’t stop… myself, human.”
He wanted to be with the hunter regardless, but he didn’t know if it was possible to annoy The Empty into releasing him a second time. Surely the cosmic entity would be on its guard against him this time.
Dean winked at him as he effortlessly helped Cas to his feet. And they were somehow even closer. "It's a damn shame we aren't on the same page," he said as he licked his lips.
"Oh, that's... um, good then." Cas swallowed dryly, looking away from Dean. It had looked painful in the video, and for some reason, he felt even more nervous and terrified of everything ahead now. "Can we buy that here?"
“Well, now I want to know what it is even more…” Dean flashed him a smile and leaned against the craft table. “They’re probably gonna pull us in soon, you ready?”
Dean was momentarily distracted by the angel circling him, yet still keeping his distance. When they locked eyes, Castiel gave him a confused look. “What are you?”
“What’re the odds, huh? I love that show almost as much as I love pie, and that’s saying something.” Dean realised he had a stupid grin on his face, but finding out Cas loved Dr. Sexy too was almost more than he could have hoped for.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean breathed out as he gently pulled his fingers out and slid on top of Cas, waist settling between his best friend’s legs. Dean sank back on his haunches to grab the lube and quickly slick up his dick. He groaned, his dick almost painfully hard.
"Yes, I can breed you over and over," the angel slurred and Dean could see the purple lines glowing again. Apparently Castiel had lost his fight for control. One hand reached in between Dean's legs, fondling his balls as Castiel’s breathing turned ragged. "I'm close to filling you."
"We're still building up the light, so you have probably like thirty minutes." She shrugged before she smiled. "But your schedule isn't as long today, so maybe you’ll have more time after?"
“And if I’d known angels could fuck like that…” Dean chuckled before he leaned down and picked up the tattered binds. He held them, gaze hyper focused on the fabric.
"I vote we don't stick around then," he said as he grabbed Castiel's hand and dragged him to the door.
For a brief moment he wondered if there was still a part of Dean’s humanity calling out to him, surging from deep within the darkness, trying to reach the light. “Dean,” Castiel moaned as his fingers slid up to Dean’s throat again, then to his chin, turning his head so he could press his lips to Dean’s.
"With Chuck not writing our story anymore, we get to write our own." Sam's carefully chosen words broke the silence.
Everything happened too quickly for Dean to process. One second he was trying to catch his breath as he took the grace extractor and removed the safety cap, the next, he was supposed to be ready to use it on Cas. He inhaled slowly when Cas’s fingertips guided the needle to the right spot on the neck and exhaled once he pushed it in. Dean bit his lower lip, forbidding his hands to tremble, and pulled the plunger.
The creature put an index finger over its lips and started humming. The almost inaudible melody contrasted greatly to the place's overall buzzing and lacked pattern and structure. Dean huffed silently, tapping his foot against the nothingness of the floor. Once again, he hoped the creature couldn’t read his thoughts.
They stayed up past midnight, retelling the story. At some point, Miracle appeared, having slept blissfully through half the day. After a thorough examination via sniffing, she accepted Cas as a new friend and proved it by nuzzling into his open palm. Even if Dean took a photo, no one could notice it, too absorbed in petting the dog’s fluffy fur.
Truth be told, Dean wasn’t sure. Neither was Sam or Eilleen. They’d read that the orb had a temporal effect on the Empty, but its length or what influenced it remained a mystery. No one had been able to check or test it, really.
"I accept your offer," The Shadow said so abruptly that Dean didn't notice when the humming stopped and the speech started. He was opening his mouth when the creature pointed the finger in his direction and added, "On one condition. Castiel's deal stands." With each following word, it stepped closer, piercing through Dean with familiar blue eyes. "The moment he feels happiness, I take him back."
“The last time Jake visited it, he blew up,” Sam protested. “He has a lot on his plate. I doubt he’s fixed it yet. It’s been only a few days.”
Under Sam’s tender look, she opened the book on the pages that she kept her index finger between. The edition must have been from the Medieval times, but the volume seemed mere years old, lacking spots or hue. Eileen scanned the text until she found the right place.
"Oh, I can," The Shadow interrupted, baring its teeth in a grin. "And I will. You see, Castiel and me — we are connected. He's been here not once, not twice, and I won't even start on him arriving here that last time. I know him. I sense him. I can run his grace to earth." It unfolded the arms and spread them, raising the shoulders a bit. "And you physically cannot hide it from me, Dean Winchester."
Cas dismissively threw the grace extractor in his pocket and let the veil hang from the chain. It kept shining as he elevated it to face level and examined the object from different angles. Dean touched the glass lightly; the hair on his hand rose from the electrical sensation that ran down his arm. His eyes were drawn to the glowing force contained in the small place. It wasn’t the first time he saw grace, yet for once, it wasn’t just someone’s grace. It was a part of Cas.
Slowly but surely, the weight of his words reached Sam and Dean's minds. It smoothed the wrinkles on their foreheads, and they smiled. He stood as the embodiment of balance, and peace, and freedom, and everything the Winchesters could've expected from God but had no luck before. But it was still Jack that they knew and loved who raised his palm in a familiar gesture and waved goodbye.
“So.” He shuffled in his place, tapping his foot against the ground. “How does it feel? To be a human again.”
He was on the point of moving towards Jack but stopped and closed his eyes. Gesturing to Sam not to intervene, Dean collected himself. Despite his anger, his desperation, he knew they couldn't afford a new enemy right now, yet he might have been coming dangerously close to displeasing God. Again.
The first thing Dean saw were the letters. The ink and yellowed pages seemed far better preserved than he expected from the book written in Enochian. Then again, it must have been due to some sort of spell, given the room where it was stored. Dean didn’t have time to speculate on the place’s nature or powers, but he figured that magic was involved. But then he saw the picture.
“It’s a simple transaction: you give me Cas, I give you the pill, and we part our ways. As soon as I’m home, I talk to God about your problem. Deal?”
“More, actually. But I’ll get used to them,” Cas said and turned his gaze to the windshield again. “It’s impossible to take pleasure in human things without overcoming some difficulties anyway.”
"Alright. And Eileen.” Dean caught her eye and pointed the finger at Sam. “Don't let him do something stupid."
Sam removed the crystal orb that they’d found in the secret room from the tiny canvas sack. The transparent surface permitted light through so eagerly that it would’ve burned his hand if it had contained water inside. Not daring to tighten his fingers around such a fragile object, Sam handed it to Eileen, who carefully opened it in half. She held both halves in her palm as Sam slowly poured the dark shiny liquid from the bowl into one of them and then closed it. The orb lighted up for a second and went out.
After these words, after his firm assertion, Dean knew: there was no hope. Jack wasn't the same kid who was willing to expose his powers or die to save everyone he could. New God was beyond moral grounds or mortality, achieving peace within himself and among the worlds. He returned the humans Chuck had annihilated but won't interfere with people's choices and decisions. In other words, he won't bring Cas back. This revelation alone formed a lump in Dean's throat that expanded so fast it could've burst open. He looked away, forcing himself to ignore it.
He didn't have a plan B, and the time was running out at a dangerous pace. Come to think of it, he had never had another option to begin with. His machete or flashlight wouldn't work against the creature, even if he had enough strength to harm anyone with Cas's face. The whole grand scheme they had invented relied on the thing they couldn't control — the Shadow's desire to sleep. According to their research completed over the last days, it would do anything to calm the Empty down. In particular, Sam had insisted on its grudge against staying awake and desperation to return its tranquil existence, but waiting for its response, Dean couldn't help but doubt.
"What I'm saying," Sam continued, rolling his eyes, "is that it may not work like the key to Billie's library did. But it will." He clapped Dean on the shoulder with the sympathetic look that his brother usually hated.
Another pause was threatening to appear. Dean reminded himself that the creature could’ve been able to read minds; thus, his only option was to speak genuinely yet wisely. As he cleared the throat to continue, the creature rolled the eyes and groaned.
Dean stepped inside the room in the bunker, accompanied by a loud ‘whoosh’ sound. He turned to face Cas but tugged his hand with so much force that the angel tripped and fell right into his arms upon entering. As the portal closed behind them, he was lying on Dean’s chest, with one hand wrapped around his waist. The fingers of his other hand still held on to the angel’s wrist.
“We’ll look anyway,” Sam said and followed her. “Even if we can’t affect the Empty, we can find something else, like a spell to hide Cas.”
“Not an option.” Cas shook his head, deep crinkles forming between his brows. “The Empty is the only place that holds celestial beings and demons. If closed, chaos will unfold.”
The grace was reluctantly flowing in a thin stream as if struggling to move at all. The sound it produced was as faint as its movement. It felt like ages passed before Cas touched Dean’s shoulder and muttered, “Almost there.”
The longer they drove, the nicer the day became. The morning chilliness gave way to warmth, allowing Dean to open the window and let the gentle breeze in. It replaced the music, which seemed excessive for the cause.
Cas leaned his back against the car at Dean’s elbow without a word. They stood still beside each other and gazed at the field, squinting in the sun. The tree was solemnly towering over the surrounding area, not bothered by the slight breeze. It barely whispered through its leaves just as it did with Dean and Cas’s hair. Nothing had really changed about the place apart from the aura around the oak, though it made a difference for the two of them.
“Nope, just the talk,” he replied and finally let go of the machete, raising his hands, palms out. “I came here to offer a solution.”
Two minutes. Same old flashbacks flew through his head when he felt the reassuring squeeze. Squeezing back, he got his second wind. Almost there.
It was when it clicked. Sam must’ve been right: Jack had indeed woken the Empty up and let it be. Their plan could work.
He waved in an unspecified direction and left upon seeing the corner of Cas’s lips curl upward. He didn’t fight his smile on his way back to the road.
Upon hearing his own voice, he noticed that it rang not in silence but over a sound. A constant buzzing, a mix of whispering and struggling, and moaning, and something distinctively else, filled the seemingly unlimited space. The noise was almost subaudible but continuous and too tangible to be ignored any longer. It touched bare skin and stuck between the layers of clothes. Dean couldn’t determine its source as if the buzzing was coming from everywhere at once.
Dean let out a sigh. It was a hand-drawn illustration in black and white that depicted complete darkness with a single silhouette in the bottom right corner. The figure was facing the nothingness in front of them, standing so far in the background that their face wasn’t even drafted. What was drafted was a contour of their wings.
The sun was shining on the car and two people, whose heads cast one messy shadow on the pavement. The wind blew gently, barely stroking the grass and the edges of the trench coat. The two pairs of hands moved from time to time to caress, to stroke, to hug closer, to run fingers through hair. Sometimes, new tears glisten in the sunlight, and their shoulders shook from sudden laughs. Once parted, their lips formed words that quickly disappeared in another kiss.
As soon as Dean parked the Impala by the side of the road, Cas sprinted out of the car. He left his still full cup on the pavement near the door.
Dean suspected that the whole ordeal was a matter of symbolism as well. Cas wanted it to be memorable, different from any other extraction he had observed or participated in. He never specified the destination, having asked to head north towards South Dakota, and Dean vaguely understood why. It was a farewell, after all.
Cas smiled unsurely, and broken wrinkles formed on the sides of his eyes. He folded his hands on the chest and turned his head to Dean but didn't get a chance to reply.
All the books and manuscripts referred to the creature at the head of the Empty as a “shadowy figure,” which wasn’t really useful when trying to communicate.
Dean feels his eyes watering and tries to stop the tears from falling but he can’t. Soon enough he’s crying silently while he comforts his brother. After a few minutes, Sam seems to relax and slow his breathing.
“Cas…”, Dean says as he lifts his hand to hold Cas’ face, “you know… well, I guess you don’t, given our conversation. But… I- I love you. I’ve loved you for so long, I don’t even remember a time when I didn’t”
Sam sees his brother realizing who it was and he doesn’t know how to explain, but he has to say something.
“Well, we were here doing research about the whole Chuck thing when we heard a loud noise coming from the map room. When we got there, there was this car and then these two came out and they were us from another world?”
The lights start to flicker and they go completely off. They stand there, in the dark, and nothing is happening. That is until they hear a loud gasp from the bed. Dean turns on the lamp from the bedside table and he sees Cas sitting up on the bed.
Dean can feel tears running down his face. He raises his hand and touches his chest, expecting to feel the amulet there, but then he remembers; he threw it away.
Cas sighs and gets up. Dean looks away when he sees he’s just in his boxers and a t-shirt, but he smiles when he realizes it’s one of his band t-shirts. They go to the Dean cave and they sit in the couch. They stay quiet for a few minutes, until Dean can’t stand it anymore and breaks the silence.
“I need you to understand that you’re… You’re my rock, Cas. Every time you d- die… I feel like a lose a part of myself. And I’m sorry, I’m so sorry that I made you feel like I didn’t care. I’m sorry I made you leave. I’m sorry for blaming you for… everything”
The phone buzzes again but he doesn’t even look at it. Sam has called three times already and he can find it in him to pick it up.
He stands and heads to his room, but on his way, he passed by Dean’s room. Without thinking about it, he entered and stood by the door. Everything is so organized... He sees the few pictures they own on the desk, but he tries not to look at them, as he is sure he would break down, but he can’t help it. He picks them up and sits by the bed.
Sam gets to the bunker and sits in his favorite chair in the library. He covers his face with his hands and sighs.
“Cas, you need to let this out. You should talk to Dean”, he can see the panic in Cas’ face, “okay, I get it. Tell me, then. I’m basically him. I’ll listen”
He seats in one of the tables and tries to think of a book he hasn't look yet but all he can think of is Dean.
Dean looks so tired, and Sam doesn’t know what to do. It seems as if he’s lost all his will to fight.
“It’s a long story but basically I saw something and I didn’t say anything and then his mother died and he blamed me. He- He told me I was dead to him”, he can feel tears in his eyes, “And then he sent me to Hell with this... abomination and we lost a friend and he... he blamed for everything. He blamed me for every fucking thing that went wrong in his life”
The ride to the bunker is silent and, when they get there, Dean takes Cas on his arms and goes to his room, where he places him on his bed and covers him with the duvet. He sits on a chair next to his bed and takes his hand in his own.
“Don’t open it yet. I need you to hear me first. Having the other... me here, it made me realize that... that I- fuck”, he stops and whispers, “
He sighs deeply. He has so many feelings at the moment and everything is so new and confusing. He sees Dean waiting for an answer.
Cas is seating by Dean's bed, holding his hand. He's been like this for three days, talking softly to Dean in hope that he's is able to hear him and wakes up. Sam has been visiting him every day but he can't stand staying long, every time he sees Dean laying there, in the bed, he feels too guilty, so he's trying to look for a way of waking him up.
This past week he hasn’t been able to get more than a few hours of sleep. Every time he closes his eyes he sees Kevin. The kid didn’t deserve to die. He shouldn’t have had to go through any of this. Just because of that ‘
Dean reaches for his hand and they go in. Everything looks like that night all those years ago. Even the sigils are in place.
He reaches a hand and places it on his cheek. It’s still warm. You could think he’s asleep. He looks so peaceful. Dean can still see the expression of relief he had when he got out of that damn portal. For the few seconds their eyes met, they thought it was over. They had won and they were all okay.
It’s been... he doesn’t even know how long he’s been here. He hasn’t moved from the floor since he saw Cas disappear. His brain is still processing everything that has happened. Death trying to kill him, Cas saving him, Cas’ deal, Cas’ confession, Cas’...
They smile and keep talking about whatever they can think of. Cas feels so comfortable talking to this Dean, he wishes he could talk like this with Dean. He feels his smile falter and other Dean puts his hand on his shoulder.
He doesn’t notice two figures coming out of the house and standing a few feet away from him. Doesn’t see his little brother’s pained expression as he sees what the angel’s death is doing to his brother. And he doesn’t see Jack with a frown on his face, thinking hard about something.
Dean manages to take him out of the house and, when they get to the driveway, the fireman and the police are already there.
Sam was about to ask him when he realized he had feelings for him when he heard a voice calling his name.
With that, Sam turns to leave the hospital room but, before he leaves, he stops by the door to look at the laying form of his brother.
Dean arrives at Heaven and the first think he sees is the Roadhouse bar. He turns the corner towards the porch and he stops on his tracks. He stands there in shock for a long time, until he hears those familiar words.
“It was me, Sammy. He- He said... He said he l- He loved me. Me!? How... After how I- I treated him terrible!”
“That’s kind of cute”, he whispers as he puts his arms around his neck, “I’ve been thinking about you too. When you said... when you told me you loved me, it made me rethink every moment we’ve had. Specially this last year. I- I’m so sorry about everything I’ve said or done”
Dean hears Cas but he doesn’t think he has it in him to fight anymore. But then, he feels something warm caress his cheek and pressure on his hand.
“We’re both a couple of dumbasses”, he says while laughing, “I know I’ve never shown you how much you really mean to me, but believe me, I love you. I’ve loved you for a while now. I was just too afraid to admit it and I’m sorry”
“Dean, he knew. He knew you cared about him. Even if he thought you didn’t feel the same way he did, he knew you cared. And when we get him back, you can tell him how you feel”
“I admit that our last moments together were rather... rushed. But I thought you could find closure in our conversation. That it would make it easier to keep on living”
"It doesn’t say anything about bringing someone back from the dead, he sees Sam defeated look and keeps going, but it talks about my powers. I think I can use them to bring him back. I just need to be surrounded by things important to him. Did he leave any stuff here that I can use?"
“I didn’t confess my feelings! I just... I... Okay, fine. But I would’ve realize my feelings sooner or later”
Once in the hallway, he tries to take control of his emotions but tears keep running down his cheeks. He takes a deep breath and dries his face with the sleeve of his flannel.
Dean can still feel tears running down his face but, as he looks at Cas’ eyes, he knows he needs to tell him, even though he’ll probably be disappointed at his weakness. Why did he thought talking about this was good? He doesn’t want to relive all of that, he-
By now Dean is practically sobbing and he can’t control it. Cas wipes the tears from his face and brings him in for a hug.
Despite the circumstances, there was no tension in the air around them. Either the dark circles under Dean’s eyes or deep lines between Cas’s brows, or both excluded a possibility of any in-depth conversation. They mostly sat in silence, listening to the blowing wind and the motor hum. It was Dean who broke it, having finished his coffee. Joyfully tapping his fingers against the wheel, he said:
The corners of Cas’s lips twitched as the information slowly reached him. His hands remained intertwined on his knees, but he dropped his shoulders and leaned on the chairback, visibly relaxing. He looked fine, as far as Dean could tell. Tired, but fine.
Nothing was weird about the place. It was the same old field without signs or houses around — they’d passed similar areas en route. The only thing that stood out was a huge oak a couple of miles away from them. Its branches spread out in every direction; its vibrant green foliage appeared so dense that it hid the bright blue of the sky. Dean shielded his eyes with his hand and followed Cas, who had moved to the tree with no delay. Soon he was forced to quicken his pace to keep up. The angel had no problem moving forward, even when rare blades of tall grass clung heavily to his trenchcoat as if intending to hold him.
Dean shifted a little, releasing a key from his pocket, and looked it over. He ran his thumb over the engraved letters and muttered them. Nothing happened. With a huff, he threw his head back under Sam’s observant eye.
“You don’t have to do this, you know,” Dean started, his voice small but firm. “We’ll find another way. Hell, I’m even tired of repeating this, but we will, as always. Especially now, without Chuck.”
The Empty wasn’t an exception. The moment Dean entered the area, the hair on his hands stood on end. Someone was indeed watching him, monitoring his every movement, but his discreet observer could’ve been anywhere. Space around lacked beginning and end, up and down, or any starting point except for the furiously glowing portal. Dean leaned his hands on his knees, his half-bent body urging him to get closer to the floor, which was also missing. He shakily stood on nothingness and stared at his scuffed boots outlined against total blackness.
He responded by merely throwing his hand in the air. Almost stumbling on the turn, Dean approached the closest door and stood still in front of it. He breathed a broken sigh and brought the key near the lock. Its size appeared to fit, but nothing else could be inferred without examining the hole or the bit. Dean closed his eyes, tilting his head, as he put the key in and twisted it counterclockwise in one rushed motion. Click, and the door opened on its own.
"Good.” He knew it wasn't the time and place for that but abruptly wrapped his arms around Cas. With forcefully shut eyes, he tensed in a desperate attempt to press closer and brushed his nose against the dark hair. "Man, it's good to have you back."
Dean gets Cas out of the Empty, but new problems emerge (bc of course they do). It's basically the first half (maybe a little more than half of the episode that I came up with).
Jack stepped back and looked around. His skin was somewhat glowing, illuminated by the sunlight and his white jacket. With an amicable expression on his face, he seemed content.
The grace appeared to be finally out of the body, reaching just above the center of the barrel, and Dean waited for a second just to be sure that there was nothing left. Once he received a squeeze on the shoulder, accompanied by a low ‘mm-hm,’ he carefully took the needle out and put the cap on it. Now, his full attention on Cas, Dean was able to assess the damage.
Dean pronounced the last words softer, searching for any sign of resentment, but as Cas's pupils doubled in size, and his lips parted slightly for an inhale, he continued.
“Pictures? Dean, it’s not a comic book store to have...” Sam stumbled on his words, turning a page, “...pictures. Yes. You might wanna check it out.”
“Yeah, no problem, we’ll be there,” Dean said and placed the food on the hood. “I call Sam, or you wanna invite him yourself? Oh, okay. Yeah.”
Smirking, Dean and continued staring in the distance and fiddling around with the key. There was something off about it. It wasn't the combination of Enochian letters that didn't make sense or sound right - he was accustomed to untranslatable angelic expressions. And it wasn't its bit, which was pretty ordinary, to begin with. The key looked like it could've fit any old lock on the chest or a door, but it merely made finding the right one almost impossible. And wasn’t it supposed to lead them to the Empty? Or what was it meant to do? There were hundreds of books in the bunker, dozens of which Dean had scrutinized over the years. Researching any artifact could've taken weeks or months and never guaranteed that they would discover anything. He couldn't allow it.
"What the hell am I supposed to do with it, Jack?" Dean muttered, his eyes turned to the letters on the shank. He couldn’t escape an intrusive thought that the key bore no relation to the Empty and opened some kind of treasure chest. The idea alone caused his stomach to curl. It didn’t add up, though. If it were a key to happiness like Jack had implied, it could lead only to Cas.
So, right, I have a question that was probably discussed before in the fandom, I just haven't seen it. According to SuperWiki, Chuck returned Cas as a seraph, and, I guess, he remained one for the later seasons. Then why the hell he has only one pair of wings? I mean, shouldn't he have 6 wings? And why didn't they state any of this in the show?
He stood there, surrounded by humans whom he created back into existence. The street was filled with noises since Jack's presence didn't mute them, enhancing every sound instead. With the small shining smile, he seemed so young and hopeful that it reminded Sam of the day he was born. Yet his eyes were no longer naive or searching for something. It wasn't wisdom that prevailed in the way he observed people around, nor was it Chuck's curiosity in the earlier days, when he wasn't bored with Humanity. It was a peacefulness and satisfaction as if he finally found all the answers. And he did.
“Nothingness,” Dean started, clearing his throat before the next words. “Cas described it like darkness all around, so it adds up.”
It was either curiosity or playing it safe in front of someone who befriended God, Dean decided. Or was it total desperation? Given the relentless buzzing, it must’ve felt tired. The corners of the mouth inexorably fell once the creature failed to control the face for an instant; a few black spots occurred on the trench coat. Dean was familiar with anguish well enough to identify one.
"It's fine," he said as he looked up the street. "Should we, uh… get back to interviewing the last witness?"
“Fuck,” he gasped out, turning his face to nudge Castiel into another kiss as the aftershocks vibrated through him with each passing pulse.
When they entered the pharmacy Cas followed Dean, who pretty much immediately seemed to know where they needed to go for the lube. Cas looked at the shelves and the bottles, picking up a purple one. "Astroglide. Real pleasure lasts longer. Gel. Personal lubricant," he read. "Is that what you were looking for?"
Castiel rolled his eyes. If he had needed any confirmation that Dean was a demon, that would have been it. "I have no intention of having sex with you again. I'm talking about our escape from this cage," he whispered, hoping the camera wasn't picking up anything, and it looked like he was sexually interested in the demon.
"It depends," Cas replied honestly. "It can take from two weeks to longer. My grace isn't that stable at the moment, so I suspect it could take longer." He licked over his lips before he looked over to Dean. "Do you have any wishes about the gender or physical traits?"
It hurt as he slowly stood up and patted the dirt from his clothes, looking up. A slick black portal was closing over his head.
"Crowley… our captor, is trying to cross our species to create a 'perfect' creature," he explained, using finger quotes to underline his words. "A demon that isn't vulnerable to heavenly light."
Charlie sighed. “That would have been the moment Sam would have finally taken a path towards his own happiness. Sadly, he was too worried about you to take that road.”
There went those damn butterflies again, but if Cas wanted to know about him, he might as well start at the beginning. "My mom died when I was young, and my dad, he… he couldn't handle the grief. He hit the bottle pretty hard, and-" he stopped himself before he started talking about something more painful. "And I... well, I raised Sam myself. I know I give him shit, but he's a good kid. Smart, like you."
"Um..." Cas swallowed visibly before he shyly looked away. Dean could see he was breathing harder when his finger reached up to his tie, trembling slightly as he opened it. "I... we can do whatever you feel comfortable with."
Cas gasped, his lips parted as his breathing turned faster and more shallow. "Dean... uh, that feels... um... strange."
As Cas laid down, Dean slotted himself between his legs. The way Cas’s half hard cock settled against his lower abdomen, sharp hip bones jutting out, Dean found himself more affected than he expected, his own cock twitching with interest. He flashed Cas a (hopefully) reassuring smile and poured a little more lube onto his fingers. “Ready?”
A waitress asked them to follow her to a cozy place at one of the windows. Dean sat across from him, the evening light hitting his beautiful smile as he looked up at her when she handed them the menus.
A couple of moments of silence followed, before Dean spoke up again. “I’m a mechanic. I like getting my hands dirty.” Cas could practically sense the eye waggle that accompanied that statement.
“Fuck,” he breathed out before he groaned again, dropping to his knees as he clutched his abdomen even harder.
"Shit," Dean said as he straightened his stance and approached Castiel. "And you keep saying breed. Is this some kind of fucked up puppy mill?"
Dean helped Cas up. “Let’s get you home,” he said as he pulled his own gloves from his jacket pocket and handed them to Cas. Dean needed the movement for distraction, feeling a little out of place, unsure of what to do now that the pretty big elephant in the room had been unleashed.
"Mhh?" Castiel gave him another puppy eyed look as his fingers went to his own mouth, rubbing the wrong side.
Cas seemed to think about that before he shook his head. "I... I don't know yet. But it doesn't hurt."
Dean had never taken anything so big before. The angel must have been at least ten inches. A fucking Godzilla dick.
Dean took a taste of each cocktail, and yep… there was pineapple in every one. He couldn’t help chuckling before he answered Cas’s question. “Yeah, and I’m not really a fan. I’d prefer a nice cold beer.”
Cas smiled brightly at him before he leaned forward and drew Dean into a tight hug. One he really needed in that moment. He pressed his face against Dean's throat, inhaling his aftershave with a soft hum.
Dean quirked his brow. If the bastard who put him here was another one of those collectors… He shuddered at the memory, causing demon dum to yank him upright. They brought him to a stop right in front of the woman. “You gonna give me my nice, shiny collar?”
He felt Sam grasp his shoulder, then he stepped back. "I'm going to give you two some time to talk. But later, Cas, I want to know how you got back."
He was holding onto the metal bars on each side, his biceps flexed, as if he was trying to rip them out of the cage. Blood was running down a toned chest from a few cuts, and something that looked like a sigil that had been carved into his skin.
Castiel bit down on his lower lip. "Sit down… Maybe… I didn't hurt you the last time?" There was a shadow of guilt on Castiel's face.
My friggin’ heart. I wasn’t expecting that, miss any. Dude, you pulled me out of an almost decade long hiatus on writing, and now I’m in grad school for creative writing, something I never envisioned for myself until I met you. You have changed my life in so many amazing ways and the words don’t exist that truly capture my gratitude. I love you, also my muse, my angel, and my PIC. I can’t wait to see all that we create as our journey continues.
Cas looked up at him like a deer caught in the headlights. “Yes, much better.” Cas bent his knee so that it was easier for Dean to reach him. “I don’t know why.”
They hadn’t spoken in a couple of weeks, and Dean couldn’t stop himself from approaching Cas. As he reached out to grab the guy’s shoulder, his hand went through him, like Dean was a ghost too.
Dean nodded and kept pushing in, the breath being squeezed from his lungs as the heated vise-like grip encased him. “Fuck,” Dean groaned when he finally bottomed out.
And that probably shouldn’t have been as sexy as it was. Dean cleared his throat. “Um, yes.” He shifted to his knees and grabbed the lube. “Should we… get started?”
Crowley grinned and shook his head at the demon. “Oh, I don’t think so. I think you’re perfect, and if you’re not… all there’ll be is a scorch mark on the floor.” He really hoped that that wouldn’t happen again, but he wasn’t about to admit it.
The angel growled again before Dean could feel a finger probing at his hole. He could see hesitation though. It made him hope that the angel was still fighting the spell. "Want out, want you." And then the angel sank his teeth into Dean's shoulder, biting him before sucking a mark into his skin.
Castiel stared at Dean, unable to find the words to express how he was feeling. In his wildest dreams he never could have expected to hear that from Dean, and he didn’t realise there was a tear on his cheek until Dean lifted his hand to his face and gently wiped it away.
Dean took a machete from the map table and started sharpening it on the grindstone. The sharp edge of the blade shone under the lamps, but he continued grinding it back and forth.  His movements were abrupt, even violent, which didn’t escape from Sam and Eileen’s attention. They didn’t comment on it, though, too busy adding the ingredients into two separate bowls according to the books in front of them.
“Look, I offer you an exchange,” he continued, putting the glowing ball back in the sack, A pill that will send the Empty back to sleep and bring you peace even if for a while — no more noise, no more disturbance — for Cas.”
“You know. Without my powers.” Cas glanced at Dean and smiled unsurely upon meeting his worried gaze. “I’m okay with being a human, I am. I awaited it so long: seeing the world in mesmerizing colors, tasting the food with its intrinsic flavors, feeling...emotions at full capacity. It’s just. I understand that I’ll be less helpful. Maybe I...”
"I said, fine. Now bring him back." Dean took the sack with the orb shining through it. He held it at face level between his fingertips but quickly recoiled from The Shadow's reaching hand. "Not until I see Cas."
Only then, as Sam crouched to pet the dog, Dean felt something cold burning his palm. A small key laid forgotten, hidden in his clenched fist. Nothing particular stood out about the object, except for the carvings on its shank - letters of the language Dean recognized immediately. Enochian.
The blue eyes fixed on his face, it fell silent for a moment. While Dean slowly took a deep breath, relaxing muscle by muscle, The Shadow folded the arms on the chest in one exaggerated movement and squinted.
When Dean screamed the last word, he heard something from behind. He wheeled around to face the gooey sounds, putting a hand on a machete handle and letting it go in an instance.
He could’ve sworn that Cas’s already big eyes became twice as large. His voice sounded more hoarse than usual when he added:
"Now, the pill," The Shadow said in a low voice, suddenly stern, and extended its expectant hand. Placing the orb on its palm, Dean didn't bother to come up with a remark or return the glare. Instead, he turned around and covered the distance to his friend in a split second. Cas had already regained consciousness and tried to sit straight, relying on his elbows.
As he finished the call, he managed to take another sip before Cas got close enough to speak without raising his voice. A smile grew on his lips as he noticed the bag.
"People won't need to pray to me or to sacrifice to me." Even pronouncing these words, for a moment, he looked confused at the prospect of someone hurting themselves in order to please him. "They just need to know that I am already a part of them and to trust in that."
He grabbed his coffee and took a long sip. His eyes wandered around the horizon a bit and stopped once he saw Cas standing in the field across the road. He was facing away—his hands in the pockets, his head tilted back—but turned around as if sensing the stare. Dean saluted him with the plastic cup and, unable to read his reaction from afar, was pleased to see Cas moving towards the car.
"We can still go together,” Sam said, getting a crumpled sheet of paper out of his pocket. The Enochian letters on it were smeared a bit. “Eileen can keep an eye on the portal just fine."
“Yeah, I guess. We deserve a little celebration.” Grinning, Dean shifted his gaze to his free hand and started drawing circles on the hood. “Bye, Jody. Tell the girls we said ‘hi.’”
“I don’t know, Dean,” Sam sounded more tired than exasperated. “It’s not like it has been done before.”
The click of the front door opening prevented Dean from forcing a joke, and someone hurried down the stairs. Well, not someone. Judging from the way Sam sprang to his feet and rushed to the exit, Dean was fairly sure it was Eileen. He remained alone as muffled voices filled the other room and then disappeared completely.
The statement made Cas’s smile spread a little. As he twisted his head, the sun illuminated the wrinkles near the corners of his eyes.
They ran as fast as they could but didn't seem to get closer to the portal. Since the buzzing from troubled beings ceased, nothing produced sounds apart from their sprinting. The watches beeped five minutes left. Dean's rhythmic breathing burned his throat and nostrils with freezing air, but he chose to ignore it. He concentrated all his attention on the glow in the darkness and Cas's firm grip. The angel visibly struggled to run in a straight line, though kept up.
Dean noticed Sam’s glance, though he didn’t comment on it. He wasn’t sure how much his brother knew. Even though he never specified the details of Cas’s sacrifice, Sam was more than able to draw his conclusions based on the provided snips of information.
Cas caught his breath, quickly returning the hug, and exhaled loudly upon hearing the words. It lasted mere seconds before Dean distanced himself, though not far enough to take his hands off the shoulders.
Cas let out a shaky breath and sniffled. His eyes had filled up with water by the end of the monologue, and tears started streaming down his face when Dean cupped it, shortening the distance between them. Tenderly wiping the skin under the eyes, he smiled unsurely in wait for his reaction, and Cas could only grin at him. He placed his hands on Dean’s shoulders and pulled him closer and slowed down for a moment. The hot breath between their lips, gentle touches that pierced through the skin, wet lines on the cheeks, and a limited view with only each other's eyes in sight. They sighed. They smiled.
Nothing caught his eye. Dean took the compass out of the pocket just in case, but its needle was aimlessly spinning clockwise. The flashlight proved to be useless as well: the light couldn’t reflect from the absolute nothingness, just as Dean couldn’t wrap his head around the place. He didn’t feel claustrophobic. The Empty started to resemble a spacious room without walls or ceiling, but, apparently, a floor, given that he hadn’t fallen through. And how come he could see himself so clearly? It wasn’t due to the portal because Dean was able to have a good look at his stuff with his back to the only source of light. And how did it glow but seem not to illuminate anything?
"I won't get involved, but I won't leave you alone," he said and placed a small object in Dean's hand. "With me around, every human will get an opportunity to pursue and reach happiness. And now, everyone has a key to theirs." He glanced over the brothers with his brows raised. "The choice is yours."
Pushing it forward, Dean plodded on. What he saw was reminiscent of any other storage room in the bunker. Three ceiling lamps lightened sufficiently to see the shelves and desks clearly, every surface covered in manuscripts and artifacts. The room lacked free space and other exits, as Dean could conclude from his perspective. Diving into the smell of decaying books, he heard familiar steps behind and didn’t bother to turn around.
“No, Dean, it’s okay. I want to,” Cas said and raised his head to see the road. “I thought about it before. A lot. With my grace fading away, I’d prefer to extract it on my own volition.”
Standing in front of the shimmering orange line, Dean faced them one last time and nodded. With tightly pressed lips, he extended a hand and entered the portal.
“We don’t have more time. Let’s do it.” He turned to face Eileen as soon as he finished. “How’s the portal?”
The Shadow tilted its head and forced a smile through tightly pressed lips. More black spots appeared on the trench coat where the fingers clung to the sleeves; they pulsated slightly.
“What’s it about?” Dean slurred back over his shoulder and put down another book he couldn’t read on the shelf. He moved considerably far compared to others, in search of other doors or peculiar signs to no avail.
When they came to the conclusion that extracting grace in the bunker was a bad idea, no one could tell. It’s not like it had never been done before; these rooms had witnessed both similar and far more dangerous procedures. This time, everything felt different. Not only the Empty could get through the bunker’s warding once summoned, but it could also track Cas’s grace anywhere, making it risky to keep its remnants inside. Extracting it somewhere else seemed like a reasonable option, though such precautions might have been pointless.
“You have about an hour,” Sam said, and Dean stopped on his track to set up a timer on his watches. “Better put it on 50 minutes or less, just in case. And good luck.”
The three of them exchanged glances and simultaneously looked around. The room was still packed with various books and manuscripts, but only several of them stood out if you knew what to notice. Some volumes and sheets of paper were considerably better preserved than the others.
The more Dean focused on the area around him, the more he wanted to puke. All the thoughts in his head mixed in one unintelligible mess that resulted in high-pitch ringing in his ears. He refused to close his eyes, which could’ve caused more dizziness, and turned his vision to the portal. Dean observed it long enough to take his mind off the space. When the noise and nausea receded, he stood upright and gave the place another look-over.
Eileen placed her palm on Sam’s shoulder, and he grunted in response with a small smile. He fleetingly brushed the hair back from his forehead and furrowed his brows. Holding the paper next to the bowl, he read the spell, distinctly uttering each sound. The liquid flickered once more as the portal appeared on their right.
As opposed to Dean's worries, Jack didn't sound annoyed or entitled. In fact, he began to resemble his old self more. He treaded lightly towards the brothers, his feet barely leaving the ground. His eyes were warm when extended a fist. There was a moment of hesitance as Dean observed it, quickly eyeing Sam, and put his open palm under. His glance traveled back and forth between Jack’s face and hand and stopped on the former.
"Never would think otherwise, Sammy, but I need you here.” Dean turned his flashlight on and off and, satisfied by its condition, continued. “If something happens, and we won't return, I need you to be here, to keep moving and holding this place together. And taking care of Miracle, okay?"
Cas was okay, or so it seemed. He was paler than before but could stand on his legs without a visible struggle and took his hand off Dean upon realizing it. With an unreadable expression, Cas retrieved a vial on a thin chain necklace. The glass was nearly transparent in the shadow where they stood. As Cas was slowly but surely injecting it with his grace, it began shining brighter than the sun above. The veil didn’t obscure the glistering mix of light blue and white colors in the slightest.
The first steps are generally the most dangerous while entering a portal. Once on the other side, the only things that can save you are your instincts and skills (and luck, but Dean never used to rely on it). One step forward, and you have to be ready for a sudden attack right away, even before you have an opportunity to look around. If no one’s trying to kill you, for now, as the following step, you still have to take all the surroundings into account, adjusting to the environment in mere seconds. An enemy can come from anywhere, especially from the portal you’ve just gone through. Thus, the next step is to move and move fast as if somebody’s watching you. Usually, somebody does.
"Let me. Let me finish," he stumbled. "I spent nights thinking of your speech. You said that happiness is in just being, but I disagree. Happiness is not in just being. Neither it is in having nor doing what you enjoy, or something cheesy like that. Frankly, I don't know what happiness is and where to find it. The only thing I know is that I cannot have mine without you."
The day before, in the bunker, Sam, Eileen, and Dean had filled him in on all the events of the last weeks. After defeating God, nothing had happened in regards to action as the three of them sat still, covered in books and random manuscripts related to the Empty. So, they focused on repeating everything leading up to their victory, with which Eileen was already familiar enough to contribute.
“It should’ve,” Eileen said as she put the orb back in the sack. “We’ve seen the sleeping pill mentioned in several books. It wasn’t accidental, even if no one specified how it works.”
Cas could only nod in response as he felt Dean taking his hand and leading the way to the glimmering light afar. And they ran.
Could the Empty get Cas without his grace? Dean doubted it but had eagerly agreed to drive the angel to a “safer” place in the morning. Eileen and Sam only exchanged weird looks in response and claimed that they had a lot of work to do in the bunker — like some research in a mystery room or checking upon other hunters, right, Sam? yeah, definitely, other hunters needed a quick check-up. you guys can handle it without us. — and left the task to the two of them. As soon as the sun came up, Dean and Cas hit the road.
"Everyone, huh?" Dean failed to make his voice calm. Even talking to Jack, he couldn't help but sound bitter. It was clear as day that no phone call or message was waiting for him. "Everyone but Cas?"
His thumb, tracing over the letters on the key, stopped on the central symbol. It really shouldn’t have to. As Sam and Eileen entered the room, he jumped off the table and dashed to the bunker’s halls.
One minute. The line was considerably thinner than earlier. It was present, even though its light almost faded. Eyeing the angel behind him, Dean considered stopping for a moment to grip Cas tight around his waist but was discouraged by the dangerously slight glimmer ahead. When he stepped into the light, he only wished not to return alone.
