“We have acquired a rehearsal studio for your use,” Pavlović said. “A car will take you there tomorrow at nine in the morning. Ah!” he said as the driver came through the door, carrying John and Maja’s suitcases. “There we are, all settled. And Mr. Holmes, we were able to recover your luggage from the plane.”
“Been a while,” John said, his breath coming shorter than before. “Also you’re a fair bit taller than my last partner. You sure?”
But John’s leg was there, at the correct angle, their calves touching briefly, without hesitation or error.
After a long time, the shaking dies down into small tremours, and he knows the risk of hypothermia has passed. He feels his brain coming back online, his hind brain releasing control of his spine.  He realizes that his face is tucked into Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock is leaning his cheek on the top of John’s head.
Sherlock sprinted from the car to the plane, taking the steps two at a time. He turned into the cabin and was surprised to see Mycroft, already seated and buckled in.
John couldn’t help grinning at Sherlock’s concept of a murder as a ‘fortunate coincidence’. “So if you knew about Valentine’s, what were we going to do if the case hadn’t happened?”
“Say goodnight to daddy, Watson,” Sherlock said. His voice was low, and John imagined that Rosie could feel the vibration of it through her cheek.
“Can’t you see the cameras, Pavlović? You want to take me down in front of the media? The all-powerful, far-reaching BBC? Some of them may even be livestreaming to the net.”
In reply, John pulled at Sherlock’s hand, pulled him close, and kissed his laughing mouth. They tilted their heads together and giggled into each other’s breath.
“I used to make a cake for Harry’s birthday, when we were younger,” John said. His voice was so low it was nearly drowned out by the sound of the simmering water on the stove. “Mum… Mum couldn’t manage it, most of the time. And Harry wanted a cake. The first time, her fifth birthday, I just went to the store and got a packet, the kind where you just mix in water and an egg. The next year, I tried making my own. It was awful, but I got better at it over the years. They were nothing near this fancy, though.”
John ran slightly ahead of him into the main part of the ship, jamming his palm onto a large green button to close the hatch. “Come on, we’d better hightail it.”
(Also, he won’t lie - seeing Sherlock dance like this, watching the flexing of his thighs and calves through his skin-tight costume, muscles rippling with exertion, his skin glowing with sweat, not to mention the shamelessly defined shape of his arse in those tights, did inspire secondary, far more lustful thoughts than mere admiration, leaving his mouth dry and his cheeks warm. He can’t be blamed; he knows Sherlock’s body as well as his own, knows its capabilities and its limits, the softness and hard edges, his weight on top of him and beneath him and surrounding him. He’s also very aware of the fact that they haven’t had sex in over two weeks, given how busy Sherlock has been, with no time to focus on anything except rest and sustenance and practising between shows. To many couples, that might not be much, but for them, it is utter torture.)
“Well, for once, give yourself a night off, eh?” John tucks back a stray, frizzy curl behind Sherlock’s ear, who in turn purrs and leans into the gentle touch. “It’s your last performance of this show. Celebrate. Enjoy yourself.”
“Oh god!” John moans as Sherlock finds his prostate, rendering him desperate and making his cock leak against the wall. (God, he hopes they won’t leave a stain.)
“There’s always room for improvement, as you know. I felt I could have landed a little better on that leap in the first half, and I could have lifted Sofia higher, but- “
John breaks away from Sherlock’s lips, who then immediately turns his attention to John’s neck and jawline, kissing and sucking bruises there with undivided enthusiasm. John manages to gather his wits enough to moan out, “like this. I want you to fuck me like this. Against this wall.”
“Of course.” John kisses the crown of Sherlock’s head. “That’s what boyfriends do. We hold each other up.”
“Shut up. You’re fine. You feel wonderful.” To prove his point, Sherlock starts to move, rocking into him while still holding John up, it seemed, with little-to-no effort. And, almost as soon as it starts, something snaps, and finally, Sherlock is fucking him properly, and John is helpless to do anything except clutch tightly onto him and allow himself to drown in the feeling of it.
John moans, rocking back against Sherlock’s fingers. “Fine. A little longer. Can you at least take your clothes off?” He can feel the soft cotton of Sherlock’s post-show t-shirt and jogging bottoms against his bare skin, doing absolutely nothing to hide the erection currently bumping against John’s arse.
“Spectacular. As always.” John leans down and kisses him, which Sherlock meets halfway, smiling giddily against his lips from the adrenaline of his performance. “How did you think it went?”
Jesus, he really misses him, and he’d held off texting when Sherlock hadn’t got back to him, because he didn’t want to seem too desperate, but now…
It’s agony not touching, but beneath it all something else is starting to build, and he realises, as it grows, and grows, and grows, that this is it, this is what he hadn’t managed the last time.
Sherlock gives his thigh a squeeze, but keeps his attention on the road, allowing him a moment to master himself.
John grins, drops the satchel slung over his shoulder onto the floor, shuts the door, and crawls back into the bed, fully clothed.
John obliges without hesitation, his body melting against Sherlock’s as though he had only been waiting for the word, waiting for permission, maybe.
He scrubs until he is sure there can’t possible be a single microbe, parasite or bit of bacteria left.
I mean really talk about it, because I don’t want to put you in a position where you are overwhelmed in a bad way.
The next is one John had taken and then forgotten all about, Sherlock sitting in his chair, reading, for the millionth time, the Christmas letter John had written him.
John balks when told they’re leaving London, grumbles about never getting a say, and how some things never change, sniffs, and slams things, and tells Sherlock to pack warm, and bring extra blankets, and ‘oh, don’t forget your favourite tea,’ when it all comes down to it.
It’s the sort of thing Sherlock never thought he could or would enjoy, but enjoy it he does, and when John falls asleep sitting up a few hours later, and slowly slides over and comes to rest of Sherlock’s shoulder, Sherlock thinks he might just be the luckiest person in the world.
On some level he wants this desperately, with all the fervour of the boy he once was, the boy who never had the chance to love a beautiful boy, and who always felt horribly guilty for even wanting to.
Sherlock trails his fingers lightly over John’s waist, beneath the water, and feels John relax a little.
He goes downstairs, and puts the leftovers in the fridge, before shrugging into his coat and scarf, locking the door behind him, and heading down the street toward the main thoroughfare where he can catch a cab.
There are only a few other patrons in the pub, all of them eating plates of English breakfast, so John assumes they are probably patrons of the inn upstairs, and haven’t tried to brave the snowy roads like he and Sherlock had been foolish enough to.
It’s not easy to find; the trailhead is tucked away in the trees, but find it he does, and they are both soon on their way.
A young man says the events from a series of graphic novels he analyses with are coming true in real life.”
John gets back up to his flat, pours himself a glass of whiskey, and realises with a jolt that he has no phone.
John may only have a decade left, and every second that goes by without him telling Sherlock the truth seems like one second too many.
But today, here, in this moment, John loves Sherlock so much it sits like a heavy ache in his chest.
There is a small reserved sign on the table; the only way they would have managed such a prime spot right at supper hour.
This morning is no different, and John is scrambling to support himself against the counter, heat bursting, toes curling, a loud shout filling the small kitchen, in no time.
His eyes are riveted on John, and John can feel the responding awareness in his body, the warmth and tingle of so much concentrated attention.
Instead he takes off his coat, folds it in half and lays it atop the haphazard pile of newspapers on the coffee table.
Sherlock stares at the way John can’t meet his eyes, at the way he switches the icepack back to the worse of his two hands and cradles it against his chest.
He carries their bags into the second parlour which has been converted into a master suite, and starts to unpack.
They’re going to keep me a few more hours because of the concussion, probably, and the flash burns, the flesh wound, those will heal up.
There had been a boy or two in uni who had caught his attention, and whose company he’d craved and even sought.
John stands in the middle of the room and looks around himself as though searching for what comes next.
There is a faux pine wreath for the front door, with a slightly moth-eaten velvet ribbon, that John insists on hanging anyway.
John—always so buttoned up, always so careful, held in tight, and now his hands have dropped (his walls have dropped), and he is standing before Sherlock, almost shy, waiting…
It’s private, typical given his station Sherlock supposes, but hardly advantageous when it comes to making friends.
mock battling Chris Melas in the streets, in front of a gathering crowd until Melas whips off his mask and tells the truth to everyone.
Sometimes it’s going on three in the morning, and I’m looking at the bottom of an empty whiskey bottle and I don’t know how I got there.
John lets his own hand wander downward, rubs his hot palm against his straining abdomen, feels the fire build as the backs of his knuckles brush against his cock, as he tenses, lets the ache build, and build, releases again.
But staying when John is constantly denying them both, constantly punishing himself, only one bad night away from leaving again, possibly forever—it’s too much.
They remember their bags from the cab, and when they are finally settled in their seats, and the train is on its way, it becomes evident just how sick Sherlock is.
“He’s fucking brilliant, I won’t argue you that, but I didn’t think business was quite that booming.”
John suddenly realises that work is something he and Sherlock haven’t even discussed since everything happened.
I used to lay on the sofa in the afternoons while you were blogging, and stare at it, wait until I could hear the music.
She tuts and coos over the previous day’s festivities and then insists that she’ll be just fine for a few hours, and that the two of them should just head out and get their honeymoon started.
“You realise you’re only going to get more eccentric with age, and I’m likely going to turn into a grumpy old man.”
He strokes his hands up the full length of John’s thighs until his middle fingers meet John’s pelvis, and then strokes back down again.
And Sherlock holds his gaze for a moment, with that look that always takes John’s breath away, and then nods and smiles.
Sherlock pushes past John and crawls into bed, turns his back and pulls the blankets up and over his shoulders.
Sherlock replies, and gives him one of those looks that makes him feel like there is no one else in the world but the two of them, for just a moment.
He pauses for a moment, in front of the mirror, and artfully musses his hair, before strolling out in the kitchen as though he’s just woken up from the best post-coital sleep of his life.
Sherlock gets up and heads downstairs, and John grins like an idiot, and pokes absently at the detritus of their meal spread out on the bed before him, half empty food containers, and crumpled napkins, discarded ribbon, and the green and red foil Christmas crackers they have yet to open.
, and John moans loud, and thrusts up into the cold darkness and wraps his now hot, slick hand around his cock.
“I’ve given you a glimpse, Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse of what I’ve got going on out there in the big bad world. I’m a specialist, you see, and a disappointment—like you.
He aches for the fact that they have shared a flat for almost two decades, and yet in all that time he’s never managed to say the things that matter.
John smooths it all over when he agrees to help, and to stop jumping to conclusions before he has all the facts and Sherlock seems sufficiently assuaged when John lets him eat more than half of his dessert.
“Oh Christ.  I—I’m gonna…”  John’s hand speeds up, flying over Sherlock’s cock as he draws closer to his own orgasm.  It’s clear he wants them to come together, or as close to as they can manage.  Sherlock lets go then, lets it build to the breaking point, crest and crash over him.  He moans in relief when it finally claims him, when he spasms around John’s body, spills onto his hand and belly, and then feels John fill him with a shout and a drawn out moan, hot pulse after pulse, and it vaguely crosses his mind that they’ve both been very careless indeed, in not insisting on protection, but his head is too fuzzy, and his muscles too weak to consider it any more.  He collapses against John’s chest, lets him slide out, and pulls him, hot, and sweaty, and sated into his arms.
I’ve never been this way with anyone, and it’s surprised me, too, the things I feel when we’re together.”
It freezes him where he sits, and he watches, as if in slow motion, as John reaches into the washing up water, and hurls plate, and mug, and tea cup against the tile of the floor, sending little bits of porcelain skittering over the tile, and under the appliances, and when there is nothing else to break, he drops to his knees in the detritus with a long moan, and a whimper, and that is when Sherlock finds his courage and presence of mind once again.
“There were so many things I’d wanted to say, so many things I swore I’d say if by some miracle if was all just some huge mistake and I got a second chance.
Sherlock hears the front door slam, hears Mrs. Hudson’s small exclamation of surprise from the foyer, and then suddenly he is on his feet, down the stairs and out the front door before he even realises how he got there.
John sits up a little, leans over, and kisses the other side of his neck, presses a kiss to his chin, reaches up, cards his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and pulls his head down until their lips meet.
John snatches his bag off the counter, throws some money at the proprietor and dashes out the door without even waiting for his change.
He starts to sob, great wracking things that wring him out, and double him over, and Sherlock feels utterly helpless.
They order a takeaway, and Sherlock falls asleep eating, and wakes up several hours later tucked in on the sofa, with John snoring softly in the chair across the room.
It has been a part of his life for as long as he can remember, but it had gotten worse in Afghanistan, an almost constant feeling of being outside rather than grounded in his body.
There is a motley assortment of tree ornaments, some of which John is almost certain must have had sentimental value, and there are a good selection of Christmas albums on vinyl, some Classical, some War Era.
A woman about his age approaches him as he stands in the middle of the stacks, no doubt looking completely out-of-place.
His eyebrows arch to the ceiling before he catches himself and punctuates the expression with a dramatic roll of his eyes.
He makes a tentative attempt at untangling himself from the web of Sherlock’s gangly limbs but he’s only made middling progress, when Sherlock grunts in objection and pulls him back in.
John does, without question, but beyond the simple act of obedience he doesn’t acknowledge Sherlock at all.
And Sherlock lets himself be gathered up from the floor, lets John fold up the blanket with the rest of their picnic, and toss it on the floor, before pulling Sherlock down onto the bed and into his arms.
He wanders back into the kitchen to fetch his meds, and sure enough, Sherlock is still hard at work at his dissection.
“And I meant what I said before.  It’s fine. It’s all fine. I’d be happy to be yours just like this, just to hold you close, just to know you want me, need me, love me, Sherlock.  I don’t need…”
Sherlock’s already taken his second finger all the way in, and is pushing himself back against John’s fingers, and his throbbing cock, like he’s desperate.
John’s hand is small, dry and warm as it wraps around Sherlock’s, fingers curling around the side to press against his palm.
John watches him, looks up when Sherlock pauses at a small, pale pock mark, an old scar, one of many strung along John’s ribs like pearls.
And Sherlock lets his held breath out in a huff.  “You’re still here…”  He sounds sincerely surprised, and it pains John somewhere deep down.  It’s not as though it’s undeserved.  Sherlock has plenty of reason to assume John would shag him and leave him, but even so—it still hurts.
And John thinks again, of the little box stowed away in his overnight bag upstairs, and all the doubts and fears he’s wrestled with for the last year, and of the decision he’d come to just a few days prior, and now here’s confirmation that Sherlock wants, and needs, and loves him just as much, and predictably John’s been a right arse about it.
He’s hardly had a moment to sit back and really process everything they are becoming since everything began.
It’s possible, likely even, that his experience is extremely minimal, perhaps even when it comes to self-pleasure.
He’s passingly aware that his tone is not communicating the requisite level of ardour, but he really does feel quite distractingly awful.
He presses up, and tangles their limbs, and cards his fingers through inky curls, before pressing their foreheads together, and holding Sherlock’s gaze.
John reaches out and pulls Sherlock a little closer, relishes in the firm warmth of his body, the way Sherlock’s hands lift from his hips to splay, large and hot against his back.  “Can’t say I mind that.  You want to get out of here, though?  Go back to the flat for awhile before supper?  I’ve got the minder at mine until 20:00.”
It makes him look young, and besotted, and all the things that John never thought to see on the face of a man looking back at him.
They gave you a sense of belonging, of camaraderie, and perhaps even tightened the bond of your friendships.
The image of it pops wholly unbidden and fully formed into his mind, so bright, and clear, and vivid that he gasps audibly.
John looks up at him with a look he can’t quite interpret, like he’s sad, and fond, and sorry all at once.
It’s such a deceptively simple tune in the beginning, just a few notes, beautiful but sad, that slowly evolve into something rich, and layered, that seems to constantly unfold, revealing new mysteries, new beauties.
And finally he does, unfurls, and curls up against John’s side, clinging tight, like the absolute limpet he is.
Rosie's sleeping like a log, so I thought I’d give her a day off from nursery, but if you want to take her later, go ahead.”
Sherlock dips down to kiss him again, slow, deep, and when he finally pulls back his eyes are shining.
And now he is reaching up to toy with Sherlock’s curls, and Sherlock feels warmly anchored by the sensation.
He feels Sherlock smile against his neck. He crawls all the way on top of him, and sits up, straddling his lap.
John finally decides upon what will probably prove a rather sad sort of a pub in one of the farther flung villages, but it’s still deeper into the areas they have yet to cover, and closer than retracing their steps, and he absolutely insists.
There are only a few lines exchanged every few months.  They usually start off light, bantering, but then quickly return to what seems to be the only topic they truly talk about—John.  More specifically, Sherlock’s unrequited feelings for John.
He reaches down and grabs the wrist of John’s other arm, guides his hand between their bodies, down, hopes he understands.  And of course he does.  John is remarkably clever, after all, especially when it comes to the important things.
“Mr. Holmes, my personal secretary, Mr. Wilder, whom I believe you have already met, is at your disposal, as is my home, which is just over the hill, should you and your colleague require a place to stay.”
He feels John go tense with momentary surprise, and then relax again with a smile against Sherlock’s mouth.  “Christ, Sherlock. Been thinking about this all day.”
He lazily cleans himself up, and then leans forward and tentatively lifts the lid of his laptop with one finger.
Sherlock lies in the dark and listens to John’s breathing deepen and slow, feels the way his body relaxes and melts back against his as he drifts to sleep.
He reaches around and takes himself in hand, vaguely aware that it should be embarrassing this animal need, the desperation to chase the pleasure John is fanning aflame inside him, to selfishly, and unabashedly masturbate while John’s tongue plunges inside.
Sherlock admits with a smile, and when John looks up again all that remains of his previous emotion is a slight redness to his eyes.
I make him a new one every year for all those festivities they have in Brighton every summer, but you keep it.
John starts to shiver, and so Sherlock reaches down and pulls the blankets up and over the two of them, wraps his arms back around John’s waist, and waits.
And Mycroft looks to John again, sizing him up, assuming, Sherlock guesses, that it is all John’s doing.
In that moment, it feels like it could become one thing or the other, and you don’t know which it will be until suddenly you’re there—possessed by it.
He blinks, his grip on the counter behind him, growing so tight Sherlock wonders if a chunk might not break off in his hands.
Sherlock moans long and deep, a moan that breaks off into a breathy grunt as he feels John push impatiently against him at the sound.
There had been a case today.  There had been a chase down damp alleys, and there had been the unexpected ambush, Sherlock thrown to the pavement (he has a bruise blossoming along one cheekbone and over his eyebrow, even now).  There had been a scuffle then, John launching himself at the man, Sherlock recovering quickly, joining in. Together they had brought him down, and had him restrained and handed over to the Met in no time.  Neither of them was hurt very badly, but John has been strange since. Wound tight.
You would be begging us to take you to Molly’s after only a few hours of our nonsense, believe you me.”
John shakes his head, eyes still closed, grips the sheets beneath him in white-knuckled fists, and fights the urge to arch his body upward, to meet Sherlock halfway, and never let go again.
So, I have some questions I’m going to be asking, and I need you to answer them as honestly as you can.
Mike holds up his hands in surrender, still smiling, always smiling.  That’s just Mike’s way and John feels a twinge of guilt.
They take three trips to the woodshed, and by the time they are returning to the cottage the last time, the temperature has dropped considerably, and an icy cold rain has started to fall.
He aches for him, for all the years of aloneness, and all the people who were idiots, who couldn’t see the miracle he was, and chose to judge, and hate, and abuse him instead—John included.
Sherlock tunes John back out at that point, piecing the puzzle together. The woman, whose ID has yet to be found was obviously on her way back home from a night of clubbing with friends, getting over a bad breakup. Gordon was an idiot, and he decided to let the man know that now since he was asking if Sherlock had anything. Of course he did, it was insulting to even doubt that he did.
“How do you feel about the violin?” Curly asked. It took a moment for John to realize that the man had even spoken to him, and he hadn’t even heard the question.
“I did. I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flat mate for.” Curly starts putting his coat on at this point. “Now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t a difficult leap.”
They are still walking when Sally shouts after him again, but the key difference is in what she says. It’s an insult, an insult that actually borders more on a curse than anything, and it’s said in a universal language known to all Fae, like it’s been hard wired into every Fae in existence. Sure, each type had their own individual languages, and some even had different dialects in each just like with any other human language, but this one, it was how Fae of different species communicated. Where Donovan had even learned such a word was beyond him.
Things weren’t supposed to be this easy right? Sherlock had expected the anger that had come after John had first seen him, even the sadness and grief while he was gone, but it felt like the last two years hadn’t happened between them.
Curly looks briefly to the left and the right as if he would find the answers somewhere else before focusing his eyes back on John. “Problem?”
“John what happened? What was that back there?” Sherlock briefly regretted pushing John, considering it was exactly what he said he wasn’t going to do, but he couldn’t go on without knowing, he couldn’t help if he didn’t know what the problem was.
When John woke it was to freezing cold, he had never experienced cold before, but it was dreadfully uncomfortable. He was hungry and shivering and so like any baby cried, he cried and cried, but his beautiful, radiant mother never came, his handsome, reliable father never came, so he cried more, until all that would emit from his mouth were soundless screams. And he slept again.
When most people thought of John Watson, most probably didn’t think Fae. After all when most people thought of the Fae they imagined tall, pale, and ethereally beautiful. They imagined beings like the elves, vampires, incubus and succubae, and the like. Or if they were of the younger variety they might think of small beings who fly around with dragonfly wings and grant wishes, and while some Fae do have wings and can fly none are so small as what is usually depicted and the only beings who grant wishes were the djinn and you usually didn’t want the type of wishes they offered to fulfill. And while they might be correct on both accounts, they were not the only Fae in existence. For instance John doubts people think of goblins as Fae, or other such nightmarish creatures. Creatures like trolls, boogeymen, tsuchigumo, or homunculi. But almost every piece of myth, legend, and folklore had to come from somewhere. So most creatures, both good and evil, both beautiful and horrendous, both heavenly and demonic are real, and they were all Fae.
John sighs quietly, making sure to keep the heavy suspicion out of his voice when he replies with a slow, “Afghanistan. Sorry how did you know…” he trails off as a woman comes into the lab carrying a cup of coffee, which she hands to Curly as he speaks.
“Sorry, what?” Even though that was only the second time he’d said it, John was starting to feel a little like a broken record. This person just kept throwing off his social equilibrium, not that it had been very stable since he’s been back in London, but it feels like he’s not even in the same realm as this stranger when he speaks. It’s dizzying and disorienting and he hates it with a passion.
Sherlock can feel the sudden tension in the air, can almost taste the energy coming off of John in waves. Sherlock knows something is about to happen but doesn’t know what, however he has a pretty good idea. A quick glance at John out of the corner of his eye and he can see the almost unnoticeable breeze that is starting to sway John’s hair, can see the ways John’s eyes both darken and lighten simultaneously, sees faint markings starting to appear on John’s exposed skin. He needs to diffuse the situation and fast otherwise John might unleash said gathering energy on those around him, and since Sherlock doesn’t know what John
It was even colder and darker the next time John opened his eyes, he was too cold to kick his feet or flail his arms, his stomach was empty and cramping, and he was still alone. So he cried some more, though at this point his throat hurt from the frigid air, but he continued to wail. It was on a particularly harsh scream that he heard a noise, but that only made him cry harder and louder, but soon he heard someone speaking and he was being lifted into warm arms, and he was being shushed and rocked like his mother did, and even though this wasn’t his mother he still quieted before falling back asleep.
His mother notices first and after she finished lecturing him she brought him into a tight hug. Once he was feeling a little better, meaning after he had taken a shower and eaten, he explained what had happened. His mother looked slightly nauseous at what he said, about how his body had reacted. She made him swear to never do something like that again. He told her that he would have to be barmy to even consider it. He had gone to bed that night, his hair back to its original length, with the thought that he would have to be content with this from now on.
John really needs to stop looking this stunned, he must look like an idiot really, but it’s just one thing after another with this man. But since they are back on the subject, “How did you know about Afghanistan?” not that Curly answers or anything, just kept talking as if John hadn’t just asked a question. Stupid dominant elvish git.
There had been all manner of animals out, and while most creatures weren’t as wary of Fae as they are of humans Sherlock had never seen them in such abundance before, and they were all centered around John. Sherlock had never seen anyone wrestle with a red deer stag, or any type of stag really, before he had met John. Had never seen anyone chase after small forest creatures like red foxes and European hares. Or wood larks, red kites, common chaffinches, and butterflies and other flying insects alight on outstretched hands like they did for John.
“Lestrade this is barely even a four, if I’m being generous. You really ought to work on your marital problems, it’s slowing you down.” Lestrade makes an indignant noise but doesn’t deny or dispute it. Sherlock sighs and has to resist the urge to rolls his eyes at the level of incompetence that he has to put up with.
John slowly opens the door, glad that he recently took care of the squeaky hinge, and peaks in. Whoever is in the room has their back turned and is searching through the wardrobe. John pushes the door the rest of the way open and steps in. He has his gun trained center mass as he says in what his soldiers used to call his captain voice, “Turn around, very slowly and with your hands up.”
, it says. “And John is right, the head wound isn’t the cause of death, you can tell by the way the blood appears around the wound. Your victim suffocated, or rather drowned, one of her ribs was broken at the beginning of the scuffle and punctured her lung. Find the ex, arrest her then find me a better case, one that’s actually worth me coming out at this time of night.”
He won’t though, at least not yet. It was hard enough loving the man the first time around, John will always love Sherlock, until the day he dies certainly, but John doubts whether or not he will ever be in love with Sherlock again. But only time will tell that, so instead he goes about taking care of Sherlock’s injuries. John has the man remove his trousers so he can take care of the gun wounds and physically recoils at the extensive scarring there. John shot straight through the fatty part of Sherlock’s thighs, no risk to arteries or tendons, a clean through and through shot that would heal with a very small scar if any; it takes a lot of force to cause scarring in Fae.
John honestly can’t believe this person, who still remains unnamed, as if he isn’t aware that that is rude. This presumptuous arse. John looks over at Mike, who once again has that sly expression on his face that John really just wants to smack. Curly also glance over at Mike, but quickly looks back at John.
Lestrade meanwhile checked the crime scene to see how much damage had been caused by John’s little spectacle just now, only to find that – to his non-Sherlockian eye – not a single hair had been moved out of place.
“John.” Sherlock starts, but John knows what’s coming and heads him off before he can get started. “Sherlock I’d really rather not-”
When John is fifteen he gets his first girlfriend who he suspects likes his hair more than she likes him, and thinks him some novelty. She’s taller than he is and she likes to call him adorable, as if he's a puppy. He breaks up with her within three weeks. When he reaches sixteen he's on his seventh relationship, this one being his third boyfriend. He was nice, good looking, and was on the rugby team with him, which John was the captain of. When John finds out about the two other "boyfriends" John drops him like the sack of shit he is. As retaliation his ex thinks that he'll cut John's hair in the middle of class. What actually happens though is that when the pocket knife tries to slice through his hair it shatters like glass and John is up and out of his chair turning to snarl at whatever threat is behind him, only to be stopped short by the terrified faces of his classmate. He doesn't know what he looks like, what with his elongated canines and his violet colored eyes and his floating hair or the pulsating marks on his skin. He runs out of class and all the way home, and doesn't come out for two days after.
, wearing a vest of explosives. Or the Woman, when he started to suspect John’s thoughts and feeling on Sherlock himself. Or the Hound when Sherlock finally admitted, to himself at least, how he truly felt, and to John that he was invaluable to him, or as close as he could make himself say. Or the Fall, the Fall and everything that came with and after. He was blind, the worst kind of ignorant, and now he was going to see.
It was the biggest mistake he had ever made in his short twelve years of life, but even after he was older he still thinks it ranks in the top five.
John graduates from school with little fanfare. His grandparents were dead, his family didn't really speak to their cousins and aunts and uncles, so it was just his mum and Harry, the latter of whom had been on her way to drunkenness, his dad was already there and thankfully at home still. He didn't have many friends to cheer for him as he walked across the stage. It was a little disheartening if he were being honest.
So when most people look at John they at first wouldn’t think Fae, but there are two giveaways, the first being the pointed ears a rather common trait among the Fae, however those are hidden away most of the time behind the second prominent feature, his hair. Now it’s not any strange color, like pink or blue or green. It was just a regular sandy blonde color, but it did trail about seven or eight centimeters below the curve of his arse and was unable to be cut. So like an elf, except for of course, the fact that he stood at a rather short five feet four inches and weighed a meager hundred some odd pounds despite all his musculature. A bone density scan in his youth revealed that his bones were not quite hollow like a flying fae’s might be, but weren’t as dense as a humans, though they made up for that by being incredibly strong.
Sherlock was at the table, looking through the lens of his microscope studying the decomposition of nocnitsa liver when exposed to certain types of fungal matter. Lestrade had messaged after John had already gone up to bed. Sherlock had gotten a text, no more than a four he concluded, but since Sherlock was particularly bored right now he figured he would take what he could get. He bounded up the stairs, not bothering to knock on the door since John would be asleep by now anyway. But imagine his surprise when John sat up as soon as his door was flung open, his eyes glowing violet. When John registered that it was Sherlock his eyes returned to his usual deep blue. Another puzzle to figure out at a later date. Of course, he had known that John was Fae, it was painfully obvious, but he couldn’t figure out what type. He had been trying to since he had first seen him in that lab at St. Barts all those years ago, but still nothing, his scent didn’t give anything away other than that he was a submissive, or as submissive as Captain John H. Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers was ever going to be. He was tempted to just give up and ask John himself but that would be boring.
Angel motioned to sit and he conjured a tea set from the early Qing dynasty, Sherlock was slightly impressed despite himself. “Now,” Angel began, “what can we do for you Sherlock?”
John rolled his eyes again, huffing as the stranger almost seemed to deflate in disappointment, even if just a little. “Uh, here, use mine.”
John sighs in exasperation at himself, wallowing won’t help him right now –though all the looks he’s getting aren’t helping–, he has more important things to think about such as finding a job and new place to live as soon as possible. His army pension only covers so much, and the bedsit was, well it was unacceptable for a number of reasons, the main one being he was liable to go crazy if he stayed there any longer. That or off himself as he had been contemplating with startling frequency as of late.
It had been half a year since Sherlock’s return, and they were on a case, when the proverbial shoe finally, inevitably begins to drop.
Sherlock is staring at him, searching his eyes and face, and John lets him, takes in the appearance of the man in front of him as well. He looks gaunt and pale, his face sunken and his usually beautiful elvish features are sharp and painful to look at now. John glances down noticing just how torn and haggard Sherlock’s clothes are, notes the bloody tie that is wrapped around his right thigh and the scarf wrapped around his left, before looking back up at Sherlock. He has such a tender expression on his face that John really just wants to kiss him.
“I play the violin when I’m thinking and sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.” Curly looks up at John when he asks, “Would that bother you? Potential flat mates should know the worst about each other. ” He gives a fake smile then and it’s so very not charming John almost turns his nose up. John also isn’t sure how he knows what sort of smiles this man has since he’s only just met, but that smile in particular was so forced it was obvious it was fake. Either way he looks over at Mike with a stunned and slightly disbelieving expression on his face.
But no.  There is a soft, warm flicker coming from the kitchen, and the sudden pop of John uncorking a bottle of wine.
It makes something ache deep in Sherlock’s centre, and he has to turn a deaf ear to the voice of his older brother, Mycroft, niggling at the back of his mind.
John’s brows disappear into his fringe, his eyes following Sherlock as he gets to his feet and heads for the door.
The cafe is nothing special, red and dirty white checkered floor, walls a bright, but rather non-nondescript green, but it’s between breakfast and lunch, so it’s not overly crowded, relatively quiet.
Wilkes nods toward the wall behind the desk, and a portrait of a sedate, suited gentleman that has been tagged with bright yellow spray paint.
And somehow John is on top of him, a lovely, steady anchor, a weight, holding him down to earth to keep him from flying off into the dark shadows of his dreams again.
Sherlock sighs in the melodramatic way that is starting to become all too familiar, but he does sit back on his heels, as John sits up, crosses his legs in front of him, and examines the three scarves.
Not blushing, not shy exactly, and Sherlock is glad of that, because he has nothing at all to be ashamed of, but it’s clear he’s not exactly certain how he should proceed.
And he kisses John like it’s the first and last time, until John is breathless, and dizzy, and feels like he is the one who had maybe indulged a little too much.
Sherlock drawls, and delights in the look of shock and slight colour that comes to his brother’s face as Sherlock slides into the seat John’s vacated for him.
Sherlock obediently parts the unfastened placket of his shirt with one finger, allowing John access, and John leans down, presses the cup over his heart, and leans down to listen.
And after everyone has trudged back out into the snow, and the kitchen is quiet again, John sets to washing the dishes in silence.
John’s still reading, but he shifts over when Sherlock appears, pulls back the blankets, and sets his book down.
Came back here to see her, and—it was like nothing had ever come between us—like old times, but—better.
Sherlock states like its a fact, and it is, John supposes, but then everything seems to be an exception when it comes to Sherlock.
He’s so bloody demanding, but it’s just getting John even more keyed up, so he can’t be bothered to care.
The bloke I’m working with, he has a nice place, much nicer than where I was at, and he asked me to move in.”
Sherlock wrinkles up his nose at every bite, but does nearly clean his plate with the exception of the mushrooms.
Sherlock steals the tiniest of glimpses of John beside him, but looks away again, just as quickly when he sees the stricken look on his face.
The necessity had been blindingly clear, like a lorry slamming into him at a 100 km an hour, a warning and wake-up call all at once.
John doesn’t say anything, just glares at her as she pulls a chocolate bar out of his bag and unwraps it with her teeth.
He doesn’t think about John Watson, or his plain, tidy little flat, his impossibly long eyelashes, or his small, strong body.
Sherlock stares, his eyes taking in a million tiny tells, and John lets him, he lets him look even though it’s terrifying as well as exciting to be the centre of all that focus.
He reaches between them and lays his hand over both of John’s, where they’re tucked up by his chest.
Sherlock’s fully attentive now, sitting on the very edge of the sofa, leaning all the way in to the camera.
“Can you look at me?”  John still sounds angry, he realises.  He hates it, tries hard to school his tone for what he wants to say next.  “Just—look at me, okay.”
A few days ago I didn’t even know what ASMR was, but a friend recommended it to me, and it’s really helped.
They lay naked together in the huge bed, in the even bigger room, beneath silky soft sheets, clouds of downy duvet, while the quiet hum of late night traffic outside, and all the small, unfamiliar sounds of a hotel at night, create a background symphony of white noise.
John calls as he strolls back into the kitchen after changing out of his work clothes in the bedroom.
Sherlock snaps with a scowl, and then looks up and catches a glimpse of John leaning louche against the wall, eyebrow raised.
Leaning over, he flips the switch on the wall, and then snorts as the tub starts to fill with small bubbles, and a rainbow wash of colour.
Sherlock must hear it too, because he cocks a brow, the corner of his mouth twitches, as he continues to loose his buttons, painfully slow.
And John can see the slump of his shoulders that he’s trying to hide, and the wetness building in his eyes just before he turns away, the way all the things she did to him, to them, vibrate through his body like a waking nightmare.
When Angelo finally heads back to the kitchen with a wink and another slap to Sherlock’s back, and they are alone again, Sherlock’s foot slides up against John’s under the table, and John smiles and rubs his shoe against Sherlock’s.
Sherlock swallows, and then suddenly lunges for the car door, nearly hitting the car beside them as he spills out and vomits all over the carpark floor.
Sherlock makes his way to the end of the hall, and stops dead at the entrance to the kitchen.  The only light in the room is that on the vent hood above the cooker, and two candles in the middle of the neatly set kitchen table.  It’s homely, warm, and inviting.
John is on his back, Sherlock’s hands trailing down over his ribs, before he knows what’s happened, and when Sherlock presses a kiss to his abdomen, he throws his head back and makes a noise that would be embarrassing if he was with anyone else but Sherlock.
“Just mean that I assume this is for your channel, and I’m not sure the world wants to see us snogging for an hour.”
“I thought it was going to be a bit nerve-racking, and it wasn’t, not really.  Thought it was going to be hot, and it was. Don’t get me wrong, it was, but I didn’t know—I didn’t expect it to make me love you more.”
Finally Sherlock drops his hand, slides his thigh a little higher, the pressure and friction making John’s mouth drop open, his nipples peak, and stars pop in front of his eyes.
And, he suddenly realises, he has no words, none that can properly capture how marvellous John looks—relaxed, and handsome, and flushed with anticipation and joy.
When he peels the shirt from Sherlock’s shoulders, Sherlock hears the breath he sucks in, sudden and rough, like he’s been punched in the gut.
She received a message, checked out early, and let over ten thousand pounds worth of photography equipment ship on ahead of her to Damascus, as there was no time to stop it.
There’s a beam of sun peeking through the curtains, dust motes floating in a swath that cuts the velvet black, and warms Sherlock’s calves where it falls on the bed.
Sherlock shivers against his shoulder, and he reaches down to pull the blanket a little higher and smooth a hand over his damp hair.
Sherlock’s hands are fumbling, almost frantic, blunt nails scratching at this back, like a desperate man, losing his balance, scrambling for purchase, clinging to anything to keep him grounded.
He can hear the quiet chatter of their guests in the room down the hall, but there is no one in sight, and so Sherlock quickly slips next door.
John turns on the radio, flips through the channels for a moment or so, and then turns it off again, when he finds nothing to his liking.
Sherlock tilts his chin to look down at him, and when John looks up to meet his gaze, his eyes are full.
He lets John slide both sandwiches onto his plate, cut them at neat angles, and push a small bowl of salad along side.
It comes out sounding much shorter than he’d intended, and he sees Sherlock’s eyes flick up and then down again.
Sherlock’s eyes take in all of his face, every nuance of expression, they drag down the length of his body, and back up again.
Suddenly, John is anxious.  Sherlock must sense it, because he pulls him closer, presses his lips to John’s forehead, before looking down again, pressing their foreheads together.  “What did you want to say?”  Deep and sure, encouragement breathed over John’s lips.
Or perhaps John will never tell him, and that’s alright, too, Sherlock thinks, as long as he tells someone.
And so Sherlock is able to catch himself, to correct without the usual pang of guilt and irritation.
John has lived through more darkness than most people can dream of, enough that he can recognise the way trauma lies in a body like a ticking time bomb, just waiting for the right trigger to set it off, and it’s clear—Sherlock is coming apart.
John walks over to the table in front of the room’s one window, pulls a chair down off the table top, and plops down into it with a huff.
He sets one down on the table beside Sherlock’s chair, and the other on the table beside the other, and sits.
Sherlock nods and watches, rapt, as John strips down to his shirt and pants, and then crawls in under the covers, too, and pulls in close.
And for the first time John sees just how much it’s meant to Sherlock, how very much he’s wanted it whether he’d been willing or able to admit to it, or not, and it breaks his heart.
He moves around behind Sherlock, and helps him shrug out of it, before taking it to a small closet Sherlock hadn’t noticed in the short corridor to what he assumes to be the loo.
And just like that John feels his eyes bite at the corners, in the middle of a crowded cafe, just because Sherlock has acknowledged that he recognises and appreciates that John notices little things like that.
“I’m sorry,” he finally manages, shoots up from his chair and disappears into his bedroom, closing the door behind him with a soft click.
He’s careful as he approaches, only because he knows it is what John would expect, that he would never forgive him if Sherlock were to give over to panic, rush in, and get himself shot, or worse.  But by the time he gets halfway there, he is left in no doubt, and the blood he can see matted in his blond hair, and the bruises he can see up his forearms make him forget every ounce of resolve.
When John wakes the next morning it’s to Sherlock’s sea glass eyes gazing at him from beneath sleep-heavy lids, a soft smile on his face.
They shouldn’t have had the champagne.  John had been too giddy already.  The nightly, group therapy sessions had been the worst part of the week.  It had taken every ounce of his control to stay in character and keep himself from bursting into a fit of giggles mid-session, as Sherlock affectedly and effectively talked to the sympathetic group about how he and John had been drifting apart since their marriage in Aruba five years prior, how the spark was gone, how the bonds of trust had started to fray and their former intimacy to evaporate.
Told him I wanted this table because it was the one we sat at first night we came in here together, and since I was moving back in, thought it would be nice.
John grins and presses his face into Sherlock’s neck, smearing a messy kiss at the hinge of his jaw.
There’s a slight breeze up in the open, and as the clouds skitter by, their shadows trail over the pastoral patchwork below.
John giggles and Sherlock pulls him closer, even though he’s still leaking Sherlock’s come over them both, and Sherlock can hardly find the strength to do so.
He kicks open the door to Lestrade’s division with the sole of his shoe and heads toward his office, trying to ignore the added buzz of 85 florescent bulbs, the clatter of 35 keyboards, and the constant low-level hum of conversation.
The sleet that had let up earlier is back with a vengeance, and the view from the bedroom’s two small windows is nothing but a dark, angry, rain-washed grey.
Sherlock climbs back onto the bed and sits cross-legged beside him, fiddling with the condom packet.
Sherlock pops up out of bed, spins around like he’s looking for something (clothes maybe?) and then stills again, and stares down at John, spent and naked.
The last few days have been a whirlwind, and he has to admit that he’s managed to get more caught up and more invested than he’d ever planned to.
The question seems to catch John by surprise.  His hand stills, like maybe it’s just hit him, what it is he’s suggesting, what it is they are about to do.  He looks down at Sherlock, forehead damp, eyes full, and nods.
He pulls out the earliest one, feeling a tad guilty, but awash with a curiosity that cannot be quelled.
John reaches down, takes two handfuls of Sherlock’s arse, and uses it for leverage to pull their bodies closer.
They’ve started to find their stride this week, to discover a familiar and pleasant sort of choreography and routine.
And when the ladies excuse themselves off upstairs for the night, John goes into the kitchen to do the dishes in the dim hush of the house, the sound of soft rain falling outside, as it washes away all their Christmas snow, and he smiles when Sherlock comes up behind him, a little drunk, a little soppy, hands everywhere, and begs John to forget the dishes and come to bed.
They’ll be stuck indoors again, for at least a couple of days, with nothing but this awkward space between them.
There is no reason, whatsoever, that that statement should send the shiver it does, prickling over John’s skin.
His finger loses it’s rhythm inside Sherlock’s body, he presses hard, and Sherlock feels his cock leak in response.
When he finally strolls back into Sherlock’s cordoned off cubicle an hour or so later, he is holding an icepack over knuckles wrapped in gauze, and has an exhausted, hungover look about him.
Sherlock starts to lose track of which is his body, and which John’s, which his groans, which John’s sighs, who gasped, who twitched, or thrust, or squeezed.
The room, Sherlock is chagrined to observe, also has two single beds covered in paisley damask bedspreads.
John leans down and stares under the bedside table, and sees a glint of silver nestled amongst the dust bunnies.
He finishes washing the frying pan, sets it on the drying rack, and then dries his hands and heads for the lounge.
He stands looking down at John perched on the end of the bed, shoulder’s slumped, and feels utterly helpless.
His fingers disappear from Sherlock’s head, and then he is stretching out, propping his back against the headboard, and pulling Sherlock into the V of his legs.
All the words have been said, everything the two of them could possibly think of to exorcise has been, and she—she’s had more of a word than she deserves after all the things she’s done.
You knit me together, and there will never be words or actions enough to let you know how grateful I am, or how profoundly I love you.”
It’s been ages since he’s done this, and usually when he does it’s quick, efficient, and coloured with the irritation he feels at having to address it at all.
Sherlock lets his eyes drop in the direction of his lips, hoping John will understand, and when John’s brow knits instead, Sherlock lifts a finger there and hopes.
he can hear the shower starting up in the loo, and he figures that since it’s Sherlock’s day to wash his hair, he will have time to cook them both a proper breakfast.
He instantly regrets it when the fond frustration and concern he thinks he’s observed since first laying eyes on John here in his flat, disappears in an instant, and is replaced, first with something that almost looks like hurt, and then is swiftly followed upon by anger.
John does, and Sherlock starts a rhythm, a slow, steady glide of fingers in and out, awed that John wants it, that John is greedily chasing it, thrusting back against Sherlock’s fingers like it’s still not enough.
John looks at the next question, reaches down and drains the rest of the whiskey in his glass in one, long pull, before beginning.
Sherlock cradles John’s face, lifts his thumb to John’s lips, traces over them, presses gently against the seam, until John takes him in, just the tip, and slides his tongue over the pad of Sherlock’s finger with a sigh of relief through his nose.
Adrenaline-fuelled evenings of frantic rutting against the wall of the hall, not even able to make it up the stairs; slow, wet, lazy frotting in the shower.
She’d left when he was 5, ran off to Cambridge to ‘smoke weed and shack up with bloody poofs!’ according to his dad.
The stiff formality is gone, replaced with the sort of intensity and sincerity that would normally send John running for the hills—the words, the way Sherlock looks at him, eyes locked on his, open, earnest.
A cab slows and pulls up to the kerb, and they both climb in, Sherlock giving the driver instructions to take them to Savini at Criterion.
John smiles, and then presses his forehead to the centre of Sherlock’s chest before huffing softly and looking up again.
She pulls the cat up close to her face, and sucks her thumb for a moment, before dropping her hand again, and nodding her head, bunches bouncing.
“Are we going to keep having this conversation, because I’ll be quite honest, John, it’s starting to get a tad boring.”
Occasionally there are some night time emissions, something he will need to consider now he shares a bed with John, but otherwise he is untroubled.
“Apparently the sight of a relatively attractive man at a playground with a toddler they assume to be his, is too great a temptation to resist.
Well, you were meant to send me that video of different triggers, to test which ones worked for me, remember?
It affords him a chance to study him, to look at the scars that pepper and stripe his back and shoulders.
Sherlock breathes against him, lifts his head, glides his tongue over the full length of John’s cock, root-to-tip, deliciously slow, and John groans like he’s been punched in the gut.
He’d got out of bed, sat some distance away, and spoken Sherlock’s name, loud but calm, until Sherlock had jolted awake, banging his head on the bottom of the bed.
Tell me you accept it, because Sherlock, that is a fucking suffocating weight to live under, let me tell you.”
Some things feel old and familiar, like their bickering over body parts in the crisper, and who will get the milk, and Sherlock infringing on John’s personal space, and John grumping passive-aggressively when Sherlock does something exceptionally
He came here hoping to make amends, hoping for a second chance, hoping that Sherlock would give him a reason to believe they had a chance, and he’s found it.
Sherlock is leaning against the door jamb a glass of water in one hand, a blanket from god knows where, folded over one arm.
John takes it all in, the vest on the floor between them, the sight still wobbling on his chest, and Sherlock standing right on the pools edge.
He gets up, goes into the kitchen, and pours himself another couple of fingers of whiskey, leans back against the wall and thinks.
John rolls his eyes, but comes, sits, dips a biscuit in the tea, sloshes a little over the side of his mug onto the table when he finally takes a sip, hands unsteady, head clouded.
There is a shaft of late afternoon sunlight shining through the flat’s one, square window, and the edge of it is just catching a little patch at the back of John’s head.
“It was the most horrible feeling, John, to be shut out that way, to know without a shadow of a doubt, that something was horribly, painfully wrong, but that you were missing something essential, that the person you cared about most in the world could not tell you, and that you were failing, failing them!
He jumps at the sensation of Sherlock’s hands settling over his shoulders, and then shivers and calms again at Sherlock’s deep, gentle, “Relax…”
I can not do it again, or if it felt good, and you want more, I can give you a few minutes, and then we can just ignore that, okay.
He’d rolled onto his side, rather than lying on his back as he usually did, rolled away from Sherlock, rather than toward, and lain there still and quiet.
Mycroft strolls across the wet tarmac immaculate in one of his signature three-piece suits, umbrella swinging lazily from one hand.
It will be a distraction even if she doesn’t have anything in, she’s always willing to make him some coffee and prattle on as long as he’ll tolerate it.
Sherlock manages it, with a little help, and stands swaying, watching John turn down the covers on one side of the bed, fluff the pillow.
He’s angry that he can’t seem to be brave, and do what he needs to do, wants to do, and he’s terrified, terrified that this whole situation is going to go tits up, and he will lose Sherlock just as they’ve barely begun.
Sherlock tucks his knees up against his chest, crosses his arms over them, and turns away again, resting his head on his knees, staring off at nothing in particular.
Sherlock feels his cheeks heat, and Harry lets out another bark of a laugh, just as the door downstairs slams shut and the sound of John’s footsteps come to a pause at the bottom of the stairs.
The siren of a police car sounds somewhere out on the street, and Sherlock holds his breath, prays it isn’t Lestrade, and then breathes a sigh of relief again when it passes.
Instead he tells Lestrade’s team about John Clay, and is summarily called in when they find his corpse in an abandoned warehouse in Peckham.
By the time he gets back to his flat his head is throbbing, his stomach twisting with hunger, and he desperately needs something, anything to calm him down.
Sherlock isn’t saying anything, but he’s pressing back against John’s body, now, and his hips rock forward as John’s hand closes around him, and starts in with a rhythm of slow, firm pulls.
A time not so long ago, and it is still hard to get used to the way John has changed things, the way he makes Sherlock eager to wake up in the morning, curious to see what the day holds.
It’s not that he isn’t aware of some of the eyes that have flitted to their table and quickly away again, when it became apparent, mostly due to Angelo’s boisterous greeting, that this was a date, rather than two men simply sharing a meal.
Sherlock’s eyes are dark and full.  John just sighs and tosses the items in his hand on the table as he strides over, steps into the V of Sherlock’s legs and pulls him against his chest.  “You’re a bloody idiot.”  He can feel the front of his shirt growing warm and wet.  “How much?”
Once when things were really bad, I—I met up with a bloke, and he did what he’d agreed to do, and then left when I got—weird about it…”
John is out here, somewhere (he hopes), and he has no intention of going back until he’s found, until he’s safe, and sound, and home again.  They were just starting to find their footing again, and they can’t leave it like this. There is so much more to discover, and share. The thought of going on without John by his side twists something tight and sour in the pit of his stomach.
John’s eyes hold his for a moment, and it feels like there is so much he wants to say, but as usual, no words are forthcoming.
John just about drops his phone, fumbles with it for a second, and then pulls it back against his chest.
Sherlock pulls tighter, and John surprises himself with a deep moan as a flood of blood rushes to his cock.
Sherlock doesn’t waste any time, he just crawls back on John, takes his hands and starts to bind his wrists together.
He looks down at the neatly folded pile of John’s cotton pants in his left hand, and the stack of his own silk-cotton blend ones in his right.
Finally the trees start to open up, and sure enough, there in the middle of the quiet woods, is a lake.
Near the end of the day, John announced that he was sick of Bach, sick of ballet, and sick of Sherlock, and stormed off to the shower room. Sherlock’s cock hardened at the sound of the rushing water coming from the far end of the studio, but forced himself to concentrate on finishing the musical phrase. Then he casually walked to the shower room.
A small smile began to break across her face. “I haven’t been to the Yúlè in years. What are we seeing?”
“Don’t try to distract me,” John said. He realized that he was close to snarling, and he didn’t care. “What are you doing? Put that down, immediately.”
Sherlock was suddenly, fiercely jealous of the snowflake. He wanted to sacrifice his uniqueness, everything he was, and transform himself to a more common form, if only for the privilege of melting against John's skin.
“Of course you didn’t,” Janina said. “It didn’t occur to you that you were leaving a mess behind, did you?”
An old man shuffled in, and John noted to himself to ask the man about arthritis and sciatica, no matter what he had actually come in for.
He sat next to Sherlock on the sofa, and adjusted the laptop in front of them so that Sherlock was framed properly in the camera.
“An overdose is quite impossible,” Holmes said. “I do not forget that you are a medical man, but you forget that I am a chemist.”
“Just in the props storage shed,” Bantam said, pointing back towards the amphitheatre. “About ten feet back from the stage, on the stage right side.”
Dancers tend not to be modest about their bodies. Sherlock had spent his entire career wearing little more than a pair of tights in front of thousands of people, not to mention quick changes backstage when he would frequently be stripped down to just his dance belt with the whole crew rushing around him. He felt no alarm with John seeing him fully naked. Despite his nudity, he did not move to cover himself.
He stepped aside to let in the portly, elegantly dressed man. “It’s been far too long,” Yun said, as they kissed on both cheeks. “You’ve redecorated?”
Sherlock peered down at the calluses and blisters that covered his feet. “They’ve always looked like that. All ballet dancers’ feet do.”
“The infantile posturing of world powers has come to a crisis point, and an eastern power has ignored all attempts to negotiate. They have,” Mycroft paused and swallowed, and for some reason this rattled Sherlock even more, “they have launched a nuclear device at America.”
This chapter describes Sherlock dancing a ballet where his character commits suicide. It is simulated using stagecraft, but if this distresses you please feel free to skip this chapter. Plot will start up in earnest next chapter.
“And I could have been killed as well. A matter of moments only, and I would have been amongst the dead. So. One starts to evaluate what one wishes to do with the remaining years ahead, the years that suddenly are a gift.”
parts of a piece. He nearly got caught talking about the route from the flat to the British counsel but quickly covered it up by shouting at Sherlock and storming out of the studio. The guard made him come back into the room.
“Only that you were trouble here, and needed to get to embassy. That we need to get out of Serbia, for the baby. That Pavlović is not our friend.”
They met Gemma in the nave of the church, caring for the few other children who were there: children who sat with their fingers in their mouths, wide eyes looking around for parents who were clearly not there. One child had hollowed out eyes and very little hair, despite his age, and what hair he had was in patches. There was a pile of blocks in front of him but he was ignoring them.
Sometimes Sherlock joins us. Not to have sex, that’s still not his bag, but to watch. It’s not particularly sexy, though – generally he brings a notebook.
As he ran, his side began to hurt. Thinking it was a stitch, he focused on his breathing, but the pain instead of calming, roared into greater life. He put his hand down to his side, and it came away wet.
He lay back in the bed, and John rolled off to lie beside him, nuzzling at his cheek and neck, thrusting gently against his thigh. “Talk to me,” John whispered. “Tell me if it hurts, tell me what you need, when you need it.”
“They are,” Cubitt said heavily. “The one thing she asked of me – the only thing she’s ever asked of me – is that I never ask her about her past. She said it was painful to her, and she wished to leave it well behind her. I was more than happy to oblige.”
An idea borne out of desperation leapt into his mind. He reached into his pocket and found his phone. He switched it on, noting that the battery was at 81% power. He flipped through the gallery until he found a picture of John.
He focused on the first girder, six feet away, perhaps five inches wide. His landing had to be precise. For a moment, he remembered his ballet mistress at the Royal, Ms Bauman, marking a spot on the floor with an X of green tape, and him performing
John looked up at Sherlock, but Sherlock was staring at the wall opposite. John returned to his work and thought for a moment.
John looked up from his book. The cool and damp of a London early December had arrived, and John was glad for the circle of warmth the fire created.
“As are you, in different ways. He as a detective, you as a doctor… and perhaps even as an artist. Each of you have different gifts, and are talented in your own ways. Do you want his praise?”
“That’s right, you’re a barrister,” John breathed. His brain was still trying to get hold of what had happened, trying to make sense of Sherlock’s mouth and lips forming around words that he would never normally use, in a manner he had never used.
“What I don’t understand is why you sent me the proposal. You could have stayed under the radar, hidden from view. Were you taunting me? Seeing if you could fool me again?”
For a second, I consider that if I’d played this differently, I could have fucked John and this wouldn’t have happened. Eventually I would have gotten jealous about Sherlock and dumped John, and they would have just kept going, neither admitting the truth to each other. This could have played out very differently.
The numbers at St. Paul’s swelled to the degree that they were in danger of overcrowding. A decision was made to create a second site, at the Portrait Museum in Trafalgar Square, which had also survived intact. Eileen was chosen to lead this community, and received one of Sherlock’s rare, grateful hugs before she left.
“We’re very proud of our facility here at St. Bartholomew’s,” Stamford continued. “We’ve always tried to keep up with the scientific advances in medicine, for the benefit of our patients and of course our medical college. I know your particular interest is the morgue, but I’ll show you the whole thing, if you’ve the time to spare. We’ve just renovated our operating theatre, and I’m like a new father, wanting to show off!”

“Could the loudness of the sound be explained by the fact that it was two gunshots, at the same time?”
Sherlock scanned the man quickly. Military posture, but older and slightly pudgy. No insignia. So retired or so high ranking that a uniform was not required. Or military police. Or secret police. In short, not a person that Sherlock wanted to be alone with, in a military hospital in Serbia, or anywhere.
Opposite him, another wing of the building created an L-shape, and Sherlock knew that beyond his sight, on the other side of that corner, was the car entrance to the courtyard, with only a low bar stretching across the driveway. On the building opposite was a metal fire escape. Tantalizingly safe, and fifteen feet away from where Sherlock stood.
John thought he could burst with happiness. Had this been any other woman or man, at this stage in the proceedings he would have his partner pressed down on the sofa and starting to get their clothes off. With Sherlock, it wasn’t just that he was a virgin and didn’t even know about the possibility of men loving each other until an hour ago - John knew this man was wasn’t a fragile flower - but this was something different, something extraordinary, and John was more than happy to enjoy the moment as it was.
He wondered if she would swoon, but she said instead, “Well, goodness gracious, go and change, sir, and I’ll clean and repair the trousers. The sooner you get blood out of wool, the less likely to stain.”
Through the cabin window, Sherlock could see headlights racing down the runway towards the plane, but the plane began to taxi away from them, gaining speed. The runway seemed to go on forever, but then he felt the plane tilting upwards, and gravity pressed him into his seat. Looking down, he saw tiny figures coming out of the car to stare at the plane as it flew away. He looked over at Mycroft.
“Come on, Watson! Case!” Holmes pronounced, then whirled around and barrelled back down the stairs. “Our client has barely begun relating the issue, but my sense already is that this will be a fascinating one.”
Sherlock was peering at the tub, then pointed at the water, still running from the tap. “It’s not the pipes, see, the water coming out is clear.” He turned off the tap. “It must be a chemical reaction to the surface of the tub. Fascinating, that is unexpected.”
“You didn’t have to come all the way out, just to wait for me in the waiting room,” Mycroft said as he strapped himself into the helicopter.
knew who I was. I thought she loved me, and I tried to love her, I tried, and then she shot you and-”
Sherlock pulled a set of tweezers from his kit and began to pick through the soil. “There’s a faint smell of dung,” Sherlock muttered. “Not cow or horse or dog though, I’m not sure… Ah!” Carefully he separated something he had found apart from the pile of dirt. “What’s that?”
When Mrs Hudson called, “Time!” John gazed with pride at their creation; when he looked up, Sherlock was instead staring at him with a tiny smile on his face, his eyes sparking with something John had never seen before.
“I thought it was to provide me with new challenges; I certainly don’t get challenged by the cases you bring me,” Sherlock said. “The common factor is the hygienist, not the dentist. The victims were all allergic to syntho-fillings and had the old-fashioned gold instead. Gold has increased in value since the supply on Earth-That-Was was exhausted, and a single filling would have a street value of about fifteen credits – nothing to sneeze at. The hygienist would supply the names and addresses to a gold-seller, or murdered the victims themselves – that’s probably it, they stole anaesthetic from the dentist’s supplies, suffocated them while they were unconscious and removed the teeth post-mortem. Then extract the gold, sell it, and keep the profits.” He stabbed his finger at the screen. “There. That’s the common name, Meisha Crowley. Bring him in.”
The cab pulled up in front of Sherlock’s flat on Baker Street. John looked up at the glossy black door, the iron gates. “Westminster?” he said with a touch of awe.
It had been a rough day for John. The surgery had been crowded and loud, with cases of flu, and colds misinterpreted as the flu. John had to explain over and over that the flu jab wouldn’t work if one already
After a time, the tumult eased, and Rosie was reduced to hiccupping deep breaths. Her voice quivered as she said quietly, “Just wanna see Daddy.”
“I was not gadding about, I was consulting an expert. And I don’t deny that this idiot is the thief, I’m saying that he’s stupid enough that he must have needed help to pull this off.”
John stood and stripped off his clothes, noting that they were a bit dusty. His room was clean, thank you Mrs. Hudson, but it was inevitable to get a bit of dust raised when moving. All the more reason for a wash.
Six months after the bombing of London, Sherlock and John were married on the steps of St. Paul’s, with the aid of an imam who had joined the community. Mycroft carried Rosie, grinning proudly at them while Rosie giggled with happiness. The crowds of sniffling, smiling people around them disappeared from Sherlock’s eyes, and he barely heard the chants of the imam rising up – all he could see was John.
He took a hovertaxi to the rougher quarter of the City, and walked to the Eavesdown Docks. Two of the bodies had been dumped in the Docks area; if Sherlock could find Wiggins or Toby, they may know something about the crime.
“I thought we could frame that picture you did of Watson,” Sherlock said, without raising his eyes from the microscope. “It might go nicely above the fireplace, in that space to the right of the mirror, where the scarab beetles used to be before the fire.”
“Do you think he’s getting a warrant?” John said, his eyes darting to the door again. He meant Lestrade.
John laughed, a bit wetly. Silence stretched out again, but this time it was not full of pain and anger, and swelled with potential.
“Some of her hairs were caught on the side of the window,” Holmes said. “You came to reason with her, ask her to come away with you, but she refused. When reason failed, you tried force.”
John stared at the paper, a little embarrassed to be put on the spot by Holmes. He tried to think as Holmes would, look for details, something that wasn’t right, something –
John swallowed hard. He imagined himself smoothing that hair back, seeing Holmes’ eyes close in bliss. Kissing his hairline, kissing his soft –
The door to the flat opened at 9:00am sharp, and a different large man stepped in. “Your car is here,” he said.
John’s hand releases Sherlock’s sleeve, strokes it smooth. He straightens and squares up his body, as though preparing for war. “Because she’s right – I do love you. I thought you didn’t, and I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. Didn’t ask you.
John sighed impatiently, and pulled out his phone, texting a quick message. Greg saw Sherlock look at his own phone and nod his understanding. Of course, Greg realized, the interrogation room was soundproof.
“Good.” Sherlock laid back again and closed his eyes. “Though there is a second bedroom if you like.”
, John,” he said, lowering his tone so the others wouldn’t hear. “I know you don’t want to do this, and it’s a huge inconvenience for you.”
John put his hands together and clubbed at the man’s ear. It was a direct hit, and the man fumbled his grip. It gave Sherlock enough space to turn in the man’s arms and get his shoulder into his chest, then push him backwards into the wall. The nunchuks fell away from Sherlock’s neck, but the man didn’t let go of them. He stepped back, spinning the weapon in a deadly whirl. Sherlock twisted free but his shoulder fell into the path of the weapon, and John heard the
They called Jerome to tell him they’d found the coin, and two police officers followed their directions to the site where Bantam had buried it. Bantam had already been arrested, taken away without protest or a fight. After the police had secured the scene from the curious eyes of the actors, who had now taken their bows and wanted to investigate what all the noise had been backstage, and after they had given their basic statements, they made their way back to Jerome. Jerome took one look at Sherlock and his face creased with worry.
Like the others in the café, John found himself caught between being frozen in this beautiful moment, and wanting to stride forward and take Sherlock into his arms. He settled for concentrating on staying in his seat, and willing himself not to tear up.
John decided he needed to make up for the extra time kneading, so it was a little shy of an hour later when he tipped his dough out and punched it down, per the instructions. When Sherlock entered the kitchen again, John was already happily kneading again. Sherlock said nothing but turned his full attention again to his bread, having spent the last hour solving a cold case from 1962.
He ran to his bedroom, ignoring the odd looks he was getting from John and Maja. He looked out the window there – another car, another two men. His lip twisting in anger, he checked behind the pictures on the wall, first in his bedroom, then the dining room.
“I was a wreck when I was first back from Afghanistan. I was so lost. Didn’t know what to do with myself. But you knew that, didn’t you? You knew from the moment you laid eyes on me at Bart’s. And then I was running again, and laughing again, and it was all because of you.”

He felt the papery weight of her hands on his shoulders, and without thinking, reached up and patted her hand. “It’s all right,” he repeated. He sat up straighter. “Mrs. Hudson, I want you to have this place. The flat. It’s yours, all right?”
He sat up slowly and carefully, and assessed himself. His head ached still, but not as loudly as before, and he could feel a large bandage on his temple. Sore, particularly his ribs which had clearly cracked in the plane crash; he could still feel the tape binding them. But no outright pain. His muscles were stiff from underuse, a state he was not used to. There was a moment of dizziness, which passed quickly.
They were in one of Mycroft's exclusives clubs, where old money and snobbery lay in the air like a choking fog. It made Sherlock want to scream, run about, knock over tables.
He turned back to the open window and took a deep breath. The window opened into a courtyard of sorts, where the guards parked their cars on the ancient cobblestones of the old city. Four stories down, two guards played a desultory game of chess in a pool of light from a street lamp. The night was dark but clear, and between the nimbus of the street light and the light of the half moon, he could see most of the details of the courtyard.
Sherlock’s jaw worked in frustration with a flush of embarrassment. “Elvis Presley. A Little Less Conversation. My father used to sing it to Mycroft and me when we were arguing about chores.”
I owe a bazillion thanks to so many people: to everyone who read, and who commented, and who kept my spirits up while I wrote; to my marvellous beta team, for making this so much better; to the Fic Writers' Retreat 2017 group who inspire me every day; to the creators of each of these universes; to Mr. Standbygo for his encouragement and visuals of The Baker.
Fast, fast, he had to get it down fast, get it out of his head and onto the paper. The angles of Sherlock’s face, so different from the softness it had earlier that evening – now appearing on the page, gaunt and sharp with starvation and neglect. Greasy hair, unkempt and scraggly beard. Lips cracked and bleeding; his eye socket darkening into a yellow and purple bruise; a rill of blood tracking from his nostrils down his mouth to his chin. John’s hands which had once caused this damage now raced to capture the details of the dream and from the memory. Accuracy was necessary, the minute details shouting their accusations to John. But what John most needed to capture was the look in Sherlock’s eyes: looking up at John, pleading, aching, mourning. But not fear. Not fear, but with something else that John was afraid to name.
Despite being shaky from vomiting, Sherlock now felt somewhat better; he had no idea he had swallowed so much water. He found he was better able to keep up with John, and needed to lean on him less.
John cleared his throat. “Yeah,” he said. “Shaken up, but they didn’t mistreat her or anything. She didn’t – she was being kept in another flat in the building, not a cell, so that’s…”
But John was tapping both with and against the rhythm of the song. He was dancing out the rage in the music and the lyrics with his feet and his whole body. He was using dance to lay his emotions out raw, allowing anger and frustration to take control of his body, from his head to his feet in staccato taps, hard and fast and as angry as machine gun fire.
There was a rush to cool the cakes, make a syrup with the cherry brandy, soak the cakes in it, then carefully stack them with layers of whipped cream and sour cherries. Sherlock glanced over at John, who was busily squeezing the chocolate he had melted onto a piece of parchment paper, creating the outlines of trees. Clearly John was taking the definition of ‘Black Forest’ literally. Sherlock looked back at his own cake, where the cream looked as though it had been applied with a razor, perfectly level, but was otherwise plain.
He took one shaky breath into his lungs, ignoring the stale air and dust he inhaled with it. Another. And another. He forced his mind to shift away from the emotional, away, away
John’s pencil captured the long lines of Sherlock’s arms, his legs, his neck. The outline of the graceful arch of his back, marred by the chaos of the scars.
“Mrs. Hudson lives here too,” Sherlock said. “In the downstairs flat. In fact she owns the building.”
He swayed slightly for the first few measures, then graduated to a more deliberate rocking motion. He stretched, letting his chest swell out, his limbs following more softly; then a withdrawal into himself, squeezing his lungs, his heart.
“It’s impossible, John,” Sherlock snapped. “We have no clue how long we’ll need to be gone for, and what if I need to consult my Grey’s Anatomy?”
She startled, backing away from the door. “Wanna go see Daddy,” she said, and was it possible for a two-year-old to sound defensive?
She still sat happily, a cup of tea in front of her, her chin resting on her hand. For the most part the finished result was all right, but John wasn’t content with how he’d drawn her mouth. That was the one part of her she could not seem to keep still.
“I will wire my brother, and we can take the train to Dover this afternoon, then the boat across the channel to Calais in the morning. I will consult my Bradshaw’s schedule, but I believe there is a train at 2:35pm. Do you agree?”
“I know,” Sherlock said. “You can’t be that tired, you slept for five hours. Now, there’s been a theft-”
Sherlock stared. “That you’re not amazing? Brilliant? Sexy as hell?” John’s blush told him everything. “It’s true, all of it.” He took John’s hand into his, forcing him to look into his eyes. “I saw right from the beginning, the day I arrived at your house, that she was scornful of you, had no respect for you. It took me a while to trust you, but once I did, I could see how amazing you are. It makes me furious that she treated you like that, made you think so little of yourself.”
As soon as John was in reach, Sherlock’s hand gripped at his shoulder and pulled him in close. Their lips met; hard, not gentle. Their hands moved over each other’s body frantically, clawing at backs, shoulders, hips. John’s lips dragged down Sherlock’s jawline and neck, bit at his collarbone hard enough to make him gasp. Sherlock pulled John into the shower’s spray, creating a slick new surface for each other’s skin. He raked his fingers through John’s hair greedily, cradling his face in his hands then dipping in to kiss him ferociously.
Sherlock unsteadily followed John into the front of the ship, into what was clearly the cockpit. There were two chairs, one for the pilot, with a dashboard filled with switches and screens, and the flight controls. He collapsed into the other chair as John slid into the pilot’s chair, already flipping switches and pressing buttons before he had fully taken his seat. Sherlock could feel power leap up in the body of the ship, buzzing through the floor and his bare feet.
Sherlock saw Pavlović speak briefly to the soldier outside the door, then the small window was blocked by the soldier’s head, blocking the sunlight.
John opened his sketchbook to a new page. He wanted to capture this miracle, this amazing thing that had happened – John and Sherlock in bed, together. It would be a gift for Sherlock, when he woke.
During the days, he would let Rosie play in areas that seemed relatively free of broken glass and sharp debris. Rosie happily ran around the space he delineated for her, clearly happy to stretch her legs after so long cooped up.  As Rosie played, he would think.
“Hello, John,” Sherlock said, and his voice was cracked and exhausted. He looked down at the coin. “Oh good. You found it.”
“Don’t act so surprised.” Sherlock lay down on the sofa, his feet propped up on the arm, not caring for the upholstery. “What about the fellow outside? Hm? You think he’s a concierge? Try walking out that door to buy milk and you’ll find out in a hurry what he’s there for. And did you not notice that the car had no handles on the inside? They didn’t want to take the risk of my leaping out into traffic.”
John stood in the middle of the sitting room, watching them go. The exhaustion of the day had abruptly lifted from him and his mind was spinning.
“Exactly. And to bring him here is a simple matter. Ask the-” Holmes briefly glanced at the door where Brigit and Mrs. Perry had gone, then back to Martin. “Ask the stableboy to take a message to the farm belonging to a man named Elridge. I will compose it while he prepares a horse.”
Far from being overwhelmed by the chaos, Sherlock had gleefully participated, playing on the floor with Rosie and her new toys as enthusiastically as if he were a toddler himself. John couldn’t stop gazing with adoration at his daughter, and his lover and best friend.
Rosie was relaxing against him, her little hands no longer grasping at his clothes in a monkey-panic-grip; she was full and safe and that was good. He felt her getting heavy with sleep, and sleep was pulling at him as well.
“You cannot go out!” he found himself roaring. He placed himself firmly in front of the door, looming over her tiny body. “Neither of us can go out! It’s not safe, don’t you understand? We. Cannot. Go. Out.”
Sherlock let the door slide shut, and leaned against the door, letting all the tension out of his body with a gust of breath.
It took all of John’s self-control to prevent himself from doing a double take at Sherlock, but there he was, singing Abba to himself at a crime scene.
“I’m - sure,” John said. There was nothing that could have prepared him for this kind of encounter. He rewound the conversation in his head, and belatedly realized that he may have solved his accommodation problem.
Once more, Greg thanked whatever god it was that helped these two men to figure it all out, and finally love each other. And love brought them joy, which allowed them to laugh.
They kissed, their lips and tongues silently expressing everything they were feeling. Sherlock kissed and licked along John’s neck, thrilling at the feel of John’s racing pulse under his mouth.
“There’s one…” Sherlock said, then cleared his throat. “There’s one that…” He looked at John with that intense look that John knew so well, then sang, “
Moira kept going, and somehow the magic of Harrods was with her, people parting in front of them, no one trying to pull her away from him.
“- Eighty-seven percent likelihood that at some point in his future, he prevented someone significant from being killed. For want of a nail, and so forth. So we need to send you back in order to correct the divergence, which will in turn balance the continuum and slippage will be restored to a more acceptable level.”
“You are,” John conceded. “But there are many variables over which you have no control. Foreign ingredients, for example.”
“Access to subconscious thought is a fascinating theory, though it is fraught with false psychology and-”
John nodded, his lips a thin, pale line. “I started shouting at the screen, I couldn’t help myself. I couldn’t believe… Unfortunately that reminded them that I was there. They picked me up and threw me in a car, and took me to a jail somewhere. I didn’t even notice where they were taking me.”
They shared the same jawline, inherited from their father, but Harry’s was softer than John’s, and without the cleft chin. She hadn’t been blessed with the Watson nose; instead it was more aquiline, like their mother’s. He remembered Harry pushing her fingertips into her cheeks as a teenager, trying to create a dimple like her friend Saoirse’s.
He knew it was dawn because the sky became a little lighter, a higher shade of grey. He kept his eyes fixed on Rosie’s face, on the peace that he saw there. When her eyes blinked open, he smiled at her.
As she entered his frame of vision, he snapped his head up to her. For a moment, he deduced her by habit (small lunch of fruit and cheese, no dinner, blister on right big toe) before bringing himself back to the moment. She caressed his cheek, then turned away. The entire second movement of the piece was filled with the push/pull of passion: the pull of desire and eroticism and temptation, then the push of rejection; emotional manipulation in dance.
It was turning into an elaborate act of diplomatic choreography. The gate was now fully open, and the guards on each side were approaching it slowly and carefully, and Sherlock knew enough diplomacy to know the guards had instructions that their prisoners were to cross at the exact same moment. When they could go no further without stepping across the border, the guards released their charges. Sherlock growled when he saw John’s guard give him a firm push, making him stumble.
Mycroft glanced over at the Director and raised an eyebrow. “He’s still talking about John? After all this time?”

I’m such an idiot but I’m ready to forgive him, as long as forgiveness comes with dinner and a few orgasms after.
“Good Lord,” Penny said. “How did you – wait. Dr. Watson, didn’t Delia say her husband was a banker? And I think she was from - you don’t think-”
In his wildest dreams, John had always imagined himself being nervous, his hands shaking when he and Sherlock would stand before each other like this. But to his surprise, his hands were steady and his voice calm as he reached for his top button on his shirt.
“Wait, I have to tell you. Janina, the woman who was here before, the Director of the National Theatre. She’s had a change of heart. She spoke to the embassy; they know I’m alive, and they know I’m here. We just need to get to the embassy.”
“Oh, I see,” John said, and his voice was strangled with humour and arousal. He started to thrust, small and shallow. “But when you are being fucked by a tap dancer, Sherlock,” and the thrusts became sharper and harder, and Sherlock gasped, “you will find that they are good at hitting,” another hard thrust and John hit Sherlock’s prostate, “very specific spots,” another hit on the prostate and Sherlock saw stars, “over - and - over - again.”
John fiddled with the delicate teacup, the china looking fragile in his calloused hands. “That woman last night – the woman you were helpin’ into a hovercar – she was a client?”
They walked through a set of old stone gates into a park, where the cherry tree blossoms were turning over into fruit. John walked down a path toward a building that was similar in style to the museum – an older building renovated with an addition made of steel and glass. In the atrium between the two sections of the building was a high-ceilinged hallway with a café, and a few people scattered about, some with instruments beside them.
Sherlock grinned as he flipped John to his back, pinning him down. “I’d like to start now, if I may.”
Sherlock felt a smile burst with relief across his face, stretching his face wide. “Mustn’t have that,” he said, and stepped in closer to John.
Sherlock looked down at the tea tray in surprise. He’d instinctively begun his usual tea ceremony. He shrugged. “Habit. Or do you want something stronger?”
He took his bows to the rapturous applause of the audience. The stage manager brought a huge bouquet of flowers to Janina. She subtly looked at the card, and smiled rapturously at him. He smiled back, and brought her downstage to take another bow.
John stood and crossed to Juliet, kneeling next to her. “You must have been terribly frightened,” he said softly.
[The music shifts, and they begin a new combo, slightly faster. A sheen of sweat can be seen on their foreheads.]
John sat at the kitchen table, eyeing the litter of petri dishes and their colourful contents with some suspicion. “Sherlock, are you-”
Sherlock woke slowly, to bright sunlight arcing across his face. He blinked and swallowed, his throat dry as sand; presumably an after effect of the sedative he had been given. He was lying on his side, one leg folded nearly perpendicular to the other, his bottom arm stretched out to its full length. Recovery position. At least someone cared that he didn’t choke on his own vomit while unconscious.
, John. It is an art form evolved during the seventeenth century, reaching its prime in the eighteenth, therefore it is appropriate to be danced to the music from its era.”
As Sherlock stirred vigorously at the dough in a saucepan on the stove, John used the mixer to create a rich thick cream for the filling. “Half chocolate, half lime, we said?”
“Oh God,” John says. He pulls away, and the blanket slides off his shoulders. He begins to pat his pockets, up and down the sides of his body.
“It’s something to do with the negotiations,” Mrs. Hudson said calmly. “If they know you’re up and about already, your brother loses some leverage, or some such thing.”
There was a bit of noise and confusion for a few minutes, as several men came into the room and attempted to lift the heavy body of the squire with as much dignity as possible. Martin had taken charge of the proceedings, and so John was the only one who noticed Holmes cross over to the window Cubitt had been facing and examining it carefully.
Mycroft patted her knee. “Don’t cry, Euros,” he said. “He’s quite happy, happier than he’s ever been.”
Back upstairs, to the kitchen. A nearly full box of wooden matches. Several candles which John had bought after a blackout, and never used. A can opener. A knife.
John bounced a little on the bed. “It’s still a bed, and a nice mattress at that. And look, it’s huge. It won’t be like that little cot you ended up with when we had that case in Edinburgh, remember?”
They all shook hands, and John and Holmes went down to the street. Holmes stood at the kerbside and waved at a hansom cab. They were silent until the cab door was shut and they were underway.
They received word from Mrs. Hudson that she was safe, in Kent with her sister. As happy as they were to hear this, they were relieved that she had decided to stay permanently - it would be better for her health. John began work with Rajjit to figure out a way to arrange a visit, but petrol was still limited.
John flushed at the notion that his enthrallment with the objects around him had been observed, but then he reminded himself that he was standing with the most observant man he’d ever met.
He raised his fists. He had a longer reach, even though they were the same height, but the other man outweighed him by at least fifteen kilos. There was the cosh to look out for as well. He circled, looking for an opening, while trying to get his back to the alley entrance; he could land a few solid punches and then make his escape. He darted in and connected a good right hook into the man’s solar plexus, and darted back – straight into a wall of muscle and bone.
It was a brilliant idea, and resulted in scores of baggies piling up at Sherlock’s side in the lab he had somehow commandeered for himself. John took himself off dirt-collecting duty, and reassigned himself to sorting the evidence and developing a coding system that connected each bag to its place on the map. He also designated himself as ‘official coffee fetcher’ and ‘stuffer of food into Sherlock’s mouth every once in a while’.
“There’s ten men behind us now,” Pavlović snarled. “I can give them the word and they’ll get you in the car, have no doubt.”
John looked at the picture of Rosie, of Mrs. Hudson, of Sherlock, and then of the model, and saw that Mrs. Roshni was right.
He could hear a giggle that could only be John’s, a sound that he generally had only heard when John had a couple of pints inside him. The giggles were uncontrolled, spilling over into the corridor.
Unperturbed, Pavlović continued, looking at his tablet again. “It’s always important to check the manifest after an accident like that. It makes it easier to identify the dead.”
Underlying it all was the source of this breakthrough. Sherlock had had teachers throughout his life, of course - teachers who had pushed him, bullied him, forced him to explore the limits of his body. But John, a man he had known just over a week, had challenged his mind, helped him to achieve new heights in dance. This, too, required more thought.
“- And then my plane crashed, which wasn’t fun either, I’d like to remind you. It was terrifying. Now I’m trapped in a city that I really don’t want to be in. I have no money, no passport, no way to contact my manager, who must be worried sick. She may even have been told I’m dead, for all I know. I have to give a performance I did not agree to, that I wasn’t given much of a choice about. But if that’s what it takes to get me out of here, I will. But you’ll understand if I don’t feel like dancing at the moment.”
“Feng is on a six month field study of the silk industry in 19th century China; Charles is cleaning up the last of the threads in WWII Suffolk, Amanda is in Myanmar observing the 2029 revolution, and Teerha is on paternity leave. I’m desperate, John, please.”
John wordlessly extended his hand, and Sherlock’s hands were shaking as much as John’s as he carefully coated John’s fingers with the cool and slippery lube. “I love your hands,” Sherlock said. “I love you. Please. Get me ready for you.”
As he and Rosie walked back to their shelter, Sherlock thought about the encounter and the offer from the woman. Perhaps he was being overly cautious by staying away from others, and perhaps there was greater strength in a group. A group might also have a greater chance of being found by whatever aid services might be coming. Resources could be pooled. Care of Rosie could be shared. Who knows, there might even be other children for her to play with.
John was frowning. “You’re dancing something you’ve already danced.  You showed me that choreography the other day – you said you danced it two years ago.”
“Scrape like that could get infected,” he said as he re-entered the sitting room. He stopped short at the sight of John standing, frozen, in the centre of the room. “What’s wrong?”
“All right?” John said softly to Sherlock. Sherlock nodded, and looked at Maja. She was still jammed in the corner, looking terrified. Part of him felt badly for her – none of this was her fault at all.
“We’re here, Holmes,” John said. Holmes did not respond, and John’s heart fell at the thought of this brilliant man blaming himself for the murder of his client.
He nodded, dressed, and moved into the sitting room part of the suite. Ruefully, he realized that although they had been at the hotel for nearly three weeks, they had barely used it. There was a door between the sitting room and the bedroom; John pulled it most of the way shut. His laptop was sitting open on the table from the time when he had been looking up a list of all the parks in Toronto, and had abandoned it in despair.
[In unison, John and Sherlock tap their right feet, rotating on their heels, toes tapping on the beat, front to side, front to side. Six beats, then a shuffle and they switch to their left feet.]
“Thanks,” John said. He could feel his face redden; it was still difficult for him to receive praise.
For two days, Holmes smoked constantly. Pipe smoke filled the flat. Mrs. Hudson waved her arms about, then opened the windows wide.
“Choreograph something of your own. Or improvise. It would be getting a bit of your own back, in a small way.”
I try to throw my courage from the knot in my stomach up into my head, and on the way past my hands it makes me knock at the door. Of course I was expecting to see John or Sherlock, so I’m a bit taken aback when the door’s opened by an older lady, who peers out at me with great curiosity. Did I get the wrong address after all?
John said as Sherlock knelt to pick the lock. Sherlock focused on the lock as John blocked Sherlock from view with his body, keeping watch down the hall. “
Sherlock reached for the buttons of John’s waistcoat, but John stopped his hands. “Not yet,” he said, even though his heart was beating double time and he wanted to strip Sherlock down
They returned home hours later, elated and exhausted. John had a perfunctory shower to get the smell of the alley off him, but was in bed and asleep before Sherlock had finished his turn in the loo.
Jim shook his head, his face serious and sad. “I heard of the bombing. Shocking. So many lives lost.”
Sherlock smiled back. “Of course. But I’m one of the very few that can. Not even my colleague Tjinn could manage it,” he nodded at her. “I’m surprised they’re calling for dancers; I can only think of three or four who know it, and none of them are-”
John held up a hand. “I’m not a guard, and this is our home, not a prison. I see no bars. You’re free as a bird.”
Holmes immediately began to study the papers, laying them all out on the desk and staring at them, his eyes leaping from page to page. The minutes stretched out.
Jim rolled his eyes. “Come on now. I don’t feel like performing for the vidders, we’ll go inside and-”
“So.” John’s eyes brightened. “I’ve been humpin’ so much work this week I ain’t seen any news. Have they found the bomber? Once they figured out it wasn’t me, of course. Have you been working on the case?”
Sherlock cursed to himself. If he was bleeding that badly, it would be painfully simple for her to track him. He took his jacket off and balled it against his side, grateful for the dark material of his shirt..
He tried to calculate the odds of John’s survival, then shook his head, sick welling up from his gut. If he went on with this line of thinking, his mind would turn into a wailing, gibbering child. John was either alive, or wasn’t. More than likely he wasn’t. At this point, and into the future – whatever that future may hold – he had to focus on survival, for himself and for Rosie. He thought of the vow he had made, so long ago, on such a different day. Well. He had failed John several times over; he had certainly failed Mary. He would not fail Rosie, now that it was truly important.
A late nineties silk affair, by the look of it, but still much nicer than the plastic one they’d seen in town.
And Sherlock hopes he understands, hopes he can see the sincerity, the commitment to building something new, something better than they had had before Sherlock had died, and John had grieved, and the world had fallen apart around them.
John catches the tease in his voice and huffs, but he’s fully hard now, and all with Sherlock barely touching him.
Sherlock takes up the lube, dispenses a little over the fingers of his right hand, and then reaches around with his left, and slips his fingers down, and in.  John is warm, and already slick with sweat. He can feel it trickling from the base of his spine down the length of his crack. He finds the end of the plug, and nudges it lightly.  John’s mouth pops open with a small gasp, and Sherlock watches rapt, as his cock fills a little more. He’s nearly half hard again already.
And what I found there was any email account filled with assignments that required marking, as well as an open paper, which had last been annotated at eleven o’clock on the night in question.
She looks like one of the mothers he sees pushing her kids on the swings at the park all the time, but the kind that usually earns a second glance because there’s something in her eyes that is in direct contrast to all that.
He breaks their kiss, because he wants to see, wants to see everything there is to see the first time John takes him in hand.
He knows he should stop, should definitely stop, but nothing has felt this good in a long time—such a long time.
John hisses at the sharp stab of pain in his thigh, as he follows in Sherlock’s wake down the small footpath through the woods.
He thinks about cases, and conversations, and risks they took, times they tread too close to the line, tipped over, how it almost destroyed them, how he never wants to walk that path again.
No real beach out here, I don’t think, but Brighton’s not far, and I think there’s a sandy beach in Seaford, maybe.”
John clicks randomly, listening to the intro to each one, relaxing just to the sound of Sherlock’s voice.
It’s so quiet Sherlock isn’t even sure if he’s really heard it, but he takes one final step closer, and dips down to press his lips gently to the nape of John’s neck.  John’s ragged breathing hitches, but he arches his back, and presses against Sherlock’s body, and lets out a small strangled sound when he feels the state Sherlock is in.
John just shakes his head and sets the bag of popcorn in his lap, before fishing out a handful and popping some kernels into his mouth.
John winks, and then skates a few circles around him, before forging on ahead and skating backwards again, which seems to impress Sherlock to no end.”
The smell of her sweaty curls, and the weight of her sleep-lax body against his side, grounds and calms him in a way he hasn’t felt in days.
Sherlock makes a feeble attempt, but eventually drags himself far enough off that John can roll over to stare up at the ceiling, effectively smearing his own come all over his hip and back.
I’ve bumped the Chapter total up from 12 - 20, on this fic because I’m realising that it's going to take longer to develop.
- I have to admit that I prefer this artist's earlier work.  He sort of changed the whole feel of his channel about a year ago, revealed his face, started doing more talking and roleplay vids, which aren't my cup of tea.  But his earlier videos are excellent, and very relaxing.  They usually involve tactile and/or auditory triggers, sometimes in isolation, and sometimes coupled with soft whispering in French or English.
John’s forehead comes to rest against his, John’s nose brushes against his, and his breath whispers over Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock stares at his reflection in the mottled window, and lowers the instrument from under his chin.
John’s eyes snap to his, and Sherlock shakes his head at the ludicrousness of it all.  “Which I didn’t know until a few days ago. Apparently he was working for Mycroft, as well.  But no one is quite clear on why he’s developed this sudden obsession.
He can feel the fine mesh of fine scar tissue, and he can feel the sweat beginning to pool in the low places, the way Sherlock is trembling slightly, even as his kiss deepens, and he rocks down to meet John’s upward thrusts.
John’s face is flushed bright scarlet, and Sherlock thinks that there is something more than love and lust glittering there.  His eyes look full.
John is clearly out of his depth socially, but he’s here anyway, and Sherlock knows, without a doubt, that there is no level of discomfort that could ever motivate John to go.
And when Sherlock just blinks up at him in curiosity, John just grins, and shakes his head, and then reaches down to grab Sherlock by the hips and slide him where he wants him.
It’s raining, and cold, and he knows what Mrs. Hudson would say if she were awake at such an hour to see him.
John’s fingers trace lightly over the scars on Sherlock’s back, and Sherlock thrills at the sensation of John’s spine beneath his fingers, vertebrae strung like pearls down the long curve of it, nothing but a thin layer of skin between Sherlock’s fingertips and John’s sinew, bone, nerves.
Just because he wants a thing, looks at John, and wants to rend the flesh from anyone who would dare to harm him, wants to be a safe place (
It’s been nearly a year since they came back together, since Sherlock invited him home and they started feeling out a life together again.
They are leaving the door open for him to end it, which means that whatever information they think he has, it is not that essential to them.
John’s nose nudges gently at his, and then his lips press to Sherlock’s, warm, and dry, and infinitely tender, and Sherlock feels a heavy sort of calm settle over him at the caress, like his limbs have gone to jelly and his flesh to liquid.
But he’s reached the point of no return, the point where he’s going to become utterly monstrous if can’t have some peace and quiet.
His cheeks flare as he lifts a hand to pinch at his nipples and snakes the other around from beneath him to give his cock a couple of long pulls.
Sherlock grins and steps out onto the ice, circling the rink with a grace and ease that comes as no surprise, his coat sailing out behind him, scarf fluttering over one shoulder.
Sherlock lifts a hand and subconsciously rubs his chest, just over his heart, in exactly the spot where Mary’s bullet almost took him away for good.
This is the hard part, always the more difficult thing—afterwards, when the lust is waning, and the endorphins have cleared.
Sherlock’s hand glides over the surface of the fleece, and John lets his free hand mirror it, slides his hand down over his chest, over his abdomen, strokes the inside of his thighs.
And Sherlock does what he always does in those moments, he spoons in behind John, pulls him against his chest, and buries his nose in his hair, breathes warm breath against his scalp, presses a hand over John’s heart, and let’s John hold on tight until he feels the tension drain from his body, again.
John gets up off the bed, and moves to the wardrobe, and all of their clothes which Sherlock suddenly realised John unpacked when they arrived, hung up side by side.
He reaches back, and grabs Sherlock’s wrist, leans slightly away, and pulls those long, slick fingers between their bodies, and down to his cock.
Some of the tension seems to leech from John’s body at that, and Sherlock feels a wave of relief wash over him.
He now has a microphone on a stand hovering over one of the desk chairs which he’s pulled into the middle of the room in front of the hearth.
John feels Sherlock’s breath hitch, hold, release warm and damp into his hair, and he tightens his grip around his waist.
Filling it out, not with the dramatic swoop of a coat and a rattled off string of attention-getting deductions, but with the solid rock of his presence, with the confident set of his shoulders, and the look in his eye that defies disobedience.
Sherlock nods, and they hobble across the snow to the water’s edge, and set off across the ice, hand-in-hand.
John wants to be angry, but really he’s brought all this on himself with his unrelenting and utterly ridiculous jealousy.
There are places in the world where marriages are still arranged, and people fall into lifelong unions with people they’ve never even met before the day of their nuptials.
He desperately tries to telegraph the truth with his eyes, wills Sherlock to see, but he’s panicking.
“Your father may have something to say about that at 11:00 in the morning, but I admit, I would very much like some myself.
Back then it had been clear it was part performance, but this—this is raw instinct, this is vulnerable.
He’s certainly known it since the moment James Moriarty grinned up at him maniacally and threatened John Watson’s life.
He feels like he’s falling, toppling headlong into some sweet and heady oblivion, and he wants to let go, he does, but god it’s all happening so fast, and he needs, something…
Greg would occasionally force a visit, just to be sure he was still alive, hadn’t done himself harm, but he had been lost, utterly lost in all that time, and so Mrs. Hudson had been completely shocked, a few days prior, when he had turned up at the flat and explained everything to her.
Sherlock walks across the room, sits, and John sees a flash of familiar, velvet brocade wallpaper behind him before he lays down, curls an arm under his head, and sighs.
Sherlock’s face does a myriad of things John can’t interpret, but finally settles into something fond and slightly amused.
He gets up, he strips quickly and efficiently, and he is beautiful, Sherlock thinks, with muscular thighs, and a perfectly formed arse, and a cock that is thick and heavy, nestled in a thatch of sparse, blond curls.
John gets to his feet, and they switch spots, but some of the atmosphere of ease and comfort has shifted.
It’s his own fault, all of it, everything his fault—always, and what right has he to cry about any of it.
“At least, I’m not the one secretly dying their hair at three in the morning, and then attempting to hide the evidence.”
Sherlock keeps his eyes closed a moment more, relishing in the way his name sounds filling John’s mouth.
John’s known it for awhile, but not wanted to say, because, truthfully, he had no idea what would happen next.
John stares down at his hands, and starts to pick at a hangnail on the side of his thumb.  “Well, and—what about Irene?”
John chuckles, and rubs a finger over Sherlock’s perineum until he finds just the spot he’s looking for.
Sherlock nods, holds his hand as still as possible, lets John set the pace, just as he’d said he wanted to.  He strokes his hand up John’s thigh again, and then lets the back of his knuckles graze against John’s cock, and John tightens around his fingers, draws him deeper still.
“You’re not angry at me.  Not this time. Well—maybe a little.  But mostly, mostly you’re angry at yourself.  Why? For falling behind? For not being there in time.  For not taking Wilkes down fast enough?” Sherlock waves a dismissive hand.  “It doesn’t really matter.”
Sherlock nods, and John slides a hand inside, presses his palm firm, and warm against Sherlock’s trembling abdomen, thrills at the sensation Sherlock’s cock brushing against his the back of his hand.
He kisses him until Sherlock isn’t conscious of anything but the sensation of John’s lips on his, the heat, and hardness, and softness, and perfect weight of John’s body atop his, and the way John is smiling against his mouth, breathing happiness into Sherlock’s lungs, lighting up his brain, and something deeper still, something Sherlock had thought he’d lost so long ago it almost seems more fantasy than memory.
He stops and rubs the pads of his fingers against his scalp, letting his eyes fall shut, and when he opens them again Sherlock’s hands have dropped away from his mouth, his lips have parted, and his cheeks slightly flushed.
John tears his hand from Sherlock’s and points the torch higher still, as the Duke and his men finally begin to gather around them.
You had no business going out to the bakery with your coat wide open the other day, dashing all about in the cold today.
The curve of John’s bare spine visible above the waistband of his boxers, pale and vulnerable, rises up suddenly and vividly in his mind’s eye and his
The mattress shifts.  He can feel John prop himself up on one elbow, to stare down at him, though he can barely see a thing.  “I’m not angry.  I’m—curious.”
We can go straight from here to mine, or if you would like to go home and change into something more comfortable first, that’s fine too.”
John sucks in a gasp, and then unfurls all at once, visibly confused about where he is, lashing out.
“You just recognised the sounds of a hospital during a two second pause in conversation over a mobile phone.
John who is staring up at him like a besotted school boy, like Sherlock has hung the moon and stars.
And Sherlock’s fingers are scrambling up John’s ribs, around his back, pulling him down into his arms until he can breathe again.
This seems enough to sober John for a moment.  He stares down at the coverlet, picks up a photo of the desert, beige, unending.  “Tell me how it will be.”
Though it probably goes without saying, professional cuddlers are just that--professionals.  They do not regularly go around falling in love with their clients or eventually having sex with them, but this is fan fiction after all, and so you can guess where this is headed. ;)
Tears back the covers, lies down, and moans with relief when he closes his warm, now slick hand around himself again.
Sherlock is kissing him again, in that same slow, tender, almost reverent way he’s swiftly settled into.
And then he’s leaving, not even taking the time to shrug into his coat before he walks out the door to the back garden.
And he needs John in him again, without question, this very instant, and so he takes him into his mouth again, deeper this time, now that he’s got a feel for how John fits, lets the head of John’s cock slide along the top of his palette, nudge at the back of his throat, and then slide further still.
The flat is quiet, save for the hum of traffic outside, and the occasional clink of microscope slides or clank of a scalpel against a surgical tray, coming from the kitchen.
He wants to trace these lines over his skin, and write words over his heart, and breath words into that hair, behind that ear, down the long, pale column of his throat.
here’s a table in front of him, with a black tablecloth and a fur-covered pillow on it, and behind him some velvet brocade wallpaper, and what looks like a leather sofa.
He’s had a decent number of partners, he knows what it’s like to be looked at through a cloud of lust, but this is different.
John braces himself for the impact of muscle and bone, but instead is met with a slap of icy cold air, and a twisting nausea that forms instantly in his gut.
John cups his phone in his hands, and leans over against the window, forming a sort of cocoon with his body.
Sherlock’s fingers twitch at the sudden sensation, and John’s breath catches, his whole body clenching around Sherlock, pulling his fingers deeper, hand tightening around Sherlock’s cock, and for one bright, overwhelming moment, Sherlock thinks he might come, but then it passes, and John trembles above him, chest heaving and pink, nipples peaked, hair plastered to his forehead.
There is a cold supper in the fridge, and a takeaway menu for the nearest village’s only Thai restaurant.
John watches Sherlocks pupils zip back and forth, following the trail of each and every possibility his brain has just supplied, abandoning some immediately, as foolish,
John grins.  He rolls over and watches as Sherlock’s eyes move beneath his closed lids.  His hair is a riot, his cheeks flushed and warm with sleep, mouth lax like a wilted bow.  “That right?  I thought for sure it was that Sanders woman.”
Sherlock sniffs the air delicately without detecting even the slightest whiff of perfume.  There is only the scent of John, the dinner he’s prepared, and the fruity tang of the white wine he is currently pouring into two glasses.
Someone is nattering away about a lost Vermeer painting being found, and John’s attention drifts to the shelves behind the counter.
If it had been through the cottage’s ventilation system, Mrs. Roundhay would have been killed as well.
He and John are eating a dinner of John’s excellent shepherd’s pie, and a nice cabernet when John brings it up.  “Been thinking about going back to London. Wondered what you thought about that?” John says around a mouthful of potato.
Sherlock sucks in a breath of bracing air to steady himself, and then nods and gets to his feet, climbs back under the covers, shivering violently, even as John gets up and shrugs into a jumper before going about building a fire in the hearth across the room.
John sounds like a child at Christmas, eager for Sherlock to show off for him, to wrap it all up and deliver it with a flourish.
John is, rather, protective, and hasn’t he always been, Sherlock thinks, remembering the early days, and John’s well-founded fears about the press.
There’s something of the doctor in John’s look—calm, steady, but beneath it Sherlock can see the soldier too, something fierce and lethal.
A rustling in the woods behind him yanks Sherlock out of his head and slams him violently back into his skin.
Nearly fifty and a right wanker, who’s still too embarrassed to buy condoms with his boyfriend, and sometimes he hates himself so much he just wants to…
John’s hands leave his hips slide up his back, and Sherlock sways forward, his knees suddenly feeling weak, mouth watering.
John can feel himself relaxing, forgetting whatever it was that had him tied up in knots a minute earlier.
It ends up being a long week that ends with the case being solved—a comic book company had been staging the superhero sightings, using Chris Melas’ as a pawn to market their next comic book series.
“Sir William’s office – the bank’s former Chairman. The room’s been left here like a sort of memorial. Someone broke in late last night.”
John looks over at Rosie pressing her ear to one particularly large box and thinks about the fact that her cot-sleeping days are probably over.
He glances over at John, who looks caught out, and like he wants to go down that path every bit as much as Sherlock wants to go down the one John had just proposed.
As soon as they reach 221b, John finds himself slammed against the living room wall and snogged within an inch of his life by one very eager, borderline desperate, ballet dancer. Distantly, he notices the champagne bottle slip from his hand’s grasp and onto the carpeted floor with a low ‘thunk’, but right now, he couldn’t care less, expensive champagne be damned, even if it doesn’t remain intact.
“I won’t be if you keep doing that. I swear to God, Sherlock, if you don’t fuck me before I come - “
He did just that. More lube, another finger, stretching him, preparing him. John spread his legs, leaned his weight against the wall to accommodate more of him. If had it his way, preparation would be quick, perfunctory, a means to an end. But Sherlock was nothing if not a perfectionist, rocking his fingers slowly in and out of him, patiently waiting for John’s body to adjust, then adding another, and searching, searching -
John obeys, and immediately Sherlock’s mouth meets his, frantic and eager so that John can do nothing but melt into it. One hand squeezes John’s arse, drawing him in close, while the other fumbles with his jogging bottoms and underwear to pull out his erection. His hands then go down to the back of John’s thighs and he lifts him off the ground, the shock of it making John give out a small yelp and giggle. His legs bracket Sherlock’s waist of their own accord, his arms locked tightly around his neck.
“I suppose I shall. Speaking of which…” Sherlock bounds out of his chair, almost with a leap, and retrieves from the other corner of the dressing room a bottle of champagne, cold and coated with condensation from the ice bucket. “Courtesy of Mycroft, as an apology for missing the final performance.”
“Oh, hush, you. You were perfect and you know it.” Sherlock smiles and his cheeks turn pink, even with the absence of blusher. “Everyone loved it. You heard the audience.”
“In a little bit, maybe. I quite like it like this.” John can understand why. There’s a vulnerability in being the only one without clothes, a display of trust and submission that makes him shiver with anticipation (though that could be the flat’s dodgy heating). “Besides, seeing as I did such a good performance tonight, don’t I deserve to have things my way, just this once?”
He gasps as the first finger enters him, stretching him for the first time in far too long. Sherlock kisses the back of his neck. “Slower?” How Sherlock could speak so calmly, touch him with such tenderness and caution while still being so worked up, John had no idea.
By the time the lights come up again for the final bows, the applause is deafening. As Sherlock runs up to the front of the stage, no one is as loud or enthusiastic as John, who whistles and claps until his hands are sore. Sherlock bows, and as he does so, catches John’s eye and winks. Just for him. God, John adores him.
It’s the sort of relaxed, enjoyable evening they haven’t shared in awhile, and John is grateful he'd found the courage to ask.
Their little excursion proves fruitless and Sherlock is in a foul mood by the time he and John get back into the car at the sixth village of the day.
Thanks, All, for your patience.  This is rather short, but a transitional chapter, we're ramping up to the climax and toward the end now.  Enjoy!
It was something else, those ‘adult things’ that Mycroft had occasionally sneered at, and which Mummy and Dad refused to discuss.
“No.”  All heads turn his way.  Sherlock shakes his head.  “No. That’s too easy. It’s what he would want us to think.  He’s got to be somewhere else.”
“And I want you to know that I don’t regret a minute, not a single thing we’ve said, not a single thing that’s happened between us.
Sherlock moves to sit up but John pushes him back down against the frozen lawn with a gentle but firm hand.
I’m sorry, I just—you mean the world to me, this means the world to me, and I don’t want you to think that I’m just using you for…”
He flicks it on, and John blinks up at him, hands held up as though still trying to ward off whatever horrors had been haunting his dreams.
John just stares down at him, and shakes his head, before going to slosh milk in one cup of tea, and toss sugar into the other.
John starts the water running, pours in a cup of bath salts and a couple of capfuls of bubble bath, and then goes into the bedroom, gathers up his fleece dressing gown from the chair in the corner, and goes back into the loo to drape it over Sherlock’s shoulders.
John does, until he feels Sherlock start to got to jelly beside him, and then he pulls back a little, and rubs his hand up and down Sherlock’s arm, in firm, even strokes.
When the woman leaves again, John takes a sip of water from his glass, and then leans back in his chair, licks his lips and clears his throat.
You know his father said he never had any friends at school, solitary pursuits, and then the trouble with the drugs after the accident.
John’s fingers fumble at his flies, find their way inside his pants, and Sherlock rocks up into his touch, and lifts his leg a little at the same time, instant added pressure against John’s cock, as he ruts against him.
His breath smells mildly of Sherlock’s arse, which should be off putting, but oddly, is anything but.
Sherlock doesn’t move, and when the man leans over the desk as though he might be thinking of physically removing them, John stands up and leans in, putting himself ever so slightly between Sherlock and Holdernesse.
Some of the comments on his videos are rather nice, but others are the typical dross you see in most comment sections on the internet.
He had imagined an expanding, thrumming lust between them, like the night in the kitchen, John pushing him against the wall, maybe, pressing his hand between them, maybe.
And Sherlock is making the loveliest sounds, a soft sort of panting, keening, whine as John ruts against him rough, and hungry, lets it build, and build, and build until his orgasm rips through him, and he comes so hard it tears a bark of profanity from his lips, and then a string of long, guttural moans, as he seems to come, and come, and come.
It’s a flood, quiet and contained, but unquellable, and John, John being John, must sense it, because he draws closer, presses his forehead to the top of Sherlock’s spine, and stays.
John strides across the room to the window, parts the curtains with one hand, to stare out over the lawn, and then turns, picks up his overnight bag, and begins to unpack.
Curious that a mere dream could produce such a reaction in his body, ashamed that he’d soiled the sheets and would have to do laundry, which would raise questions he’d rather not discuss with Mrs. Hudson of all people!
Sherlock hesitates, eyes taking in every inch of John’s body where it lies tucked tightly beneath the hospital blanket.
Their respective YouTube channels languish for awhile, to the point that people start getting angry in the comments.
Propped against the teapot is a piece of paper torn hastily from the notepad he keeps on the desk in the lounge, and folded in half twice.
He takes hold of his shirt, carefully prises it from beneath his waistband, and makes short order the last two buttons.
