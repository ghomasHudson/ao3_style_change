“No legal papers or certificates?”
“When?” I pressed.
I was distracted by the mayhem I had knowingly caused and jumped when a hand slid into mine. Holmes appeared at my side with a murmur of, “Run,” and so we did. We gamboled pell-mell through side streets and mews that my companion navigated with ease. She slowed when the sounds of commotion were far beyond and took an abrupt turn to emerge onto a thoroughfare. She met my gaze, the both of us heaving for breath with windswept grins, and laughed brighter than the stars.
“Yes, if you have nothing better to do.” She knew, of course, that I hadn’t. A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road. My hands were clasped, for fear of shaking, and giving away to my brilliant companion just how eager and fearful I was.
Gregson sputtered, face turning ruddy, “Beg pardon?”
As grateful as if the guillotine had cracked, I rushed up to do as she bade. I dressed in clean, bright white, and took care brushing and pinning up my mousy mess. My skirts seemed buoyant as I fluttered down the stairs, and found Holmes. While she was dressed, there were minuscule imperfections, and I found myself reaching hand outstretched to adjust her collar. I stayed my hand, chagrined, and turned away.
I thought of my lounging and reading in the sitting room while she sat conducting experiments and remarked, “Is my company so desirous to you?”
“Good. Come, Watson.” Striding past the royal, Holmes led our strange procession to the street, and gave directions to the King’s brougham. We clambered in to the grandest carriage I’ve ever seen in my life. The ride was awkward, myself and Holmes sat beside one another under the gaze of the Bohemian, yet made up for this fact by being short.
With a snap of her head she looked toward the door. A knock must have sounded, as she passed out of sight to it. I curled my fingers around the pipe rocket. Minutes ticked by, and I could not make out more than shifts in the light. Then, when I began to worry, Holmes familiar silhouette appeared in the window. She was without her top hat, and her hair was similarly loose, but even with her back to me I knew her. I observed her chin waggle, her shoulders shake, her hands gesticulate, though none of these were my signal. A shadow, first indistinct, took form as Irene drew close to my friend. Her hand alighted like a bird upon her collar.
She waved her hand through the thick fog about her face. “It is not some miraculous feat. You usually tarry longer when the newborn is female, your fingers wrinkle with its bathing, and you linger with the mother, no doubt assuring her the child will be every bit as capable as the anticipated boy. When the child is male, you neaten your hair and overall appearance before announcing to the father and assorted relatives; but the joy you feel at a healthy wriggling girl is enough to make you forget yourself until after its needs have been seen to. Ergo, loose hairpins, wrinkled fingertips, and that little slip of ribbon peeking from your bag inform me that you have just heralded another young girl into this world.”
With a wink of her charcoal lined eye, Irene Adler sang, “He comes beneath my window nightly, I see his form, and I rejoice. While countless stars are shining brightly, I hear the tones of his dear voice. Then we exchange fond words and glances, and fondly speak our hopes and fear. Defying time and his mischances, we tinge with gold the coming year.” As she went into the vocal flourish, Irene plucked at her sleeve, which snapped off the bodice of the shirt as though awaiting her signal. To much applause, she removed the other sleeve, standing before the crowd unabashed in a neatly ripped shirt and trousers.
This was unsatisfactory, and she knew it. Changing the subject, Holmes began regaling me with other entertainment she had witnessed in a similar vein. She described a case in which a female bodybuilder had been the primary suspect, when the culprit had instead been revealed as a mousy accountant. I was only half listening, and so when a voice muttered in my ear, “Goodnight,” I startled and whirled round.
“Then your return to London,” I surmised aloud, “Was precipitated by the death of Ronald Adair. The news reached you abroad and you recognized his name, Moran’s, I mean.”
I countered with her beloved logic, “The hospital breeds rats exclusively for experimentation. Go forth and find your proof there.”
—a bargain every one of them. With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf. It looks untidy, does it not, ma’am?”
“So I have heard.”
We were still not touching, yet I was burning up, the fire licking at my skin from all sides. Hoarsely I said, “No.”
“To do nothing whatever. Make your way into the stable yet at a vantage to view that open window.” She pointed to one two stories up with a linen curtain swaying gently. “A whelp of fourteen boasted of its clear line to her changing screen.”
“No,” I answered, for I’d been around it all my life.
I had no inkling of whom she could refer, yet I bid her let him enter. To my astonishment, it was none other than the strange old book collector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a mop of white hair, and at least a dozen of his precious volumes wedged under his right arm.
I huffed, “I am still in the dark.”
, “To conclusively prove that these are the poisoned pills in question is the crux of the case!”
“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.” He cleared his throat with a rumble. “Madame Holmes, it is your reputation of discretion that brought me to you. I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”
“You see, but you do not observe,” She answered, with a playful smirk that belied her words, “The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”
With a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?” I gazed with some reverence at the royal in our sitting room, who was in fact utterly ordinary. He seemed no more or less a man than anyone we might have met. “But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”
“Yes, Watson,” She declared in a feather soft, rich timbre, “It may very well be.”
“A woman in the chemical laboratory up in the hospital. She was bemoaning to all and sundry how a woman is not expected to live on her own, yet she should not like to pass up these nice rooms she’d come across.”
“But why?” I turned my incredulous gaze to the faint outline of my companion. “Why should you have need of a wax bust of my face?”
and a long, silvery tinkle of broken glass.
“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.”
With sudden vigor she pushed out of the armchair and began to pace the well-trod path along the carpet.
“Mm, yes,” She moved to the hanging slipper containing tobacco, and lit her favored clay pipe. “Most of the time it’s through talk, as I’m the most incurably lazy devil. When the urge strikes I have been known to go out and put in some legwork, as it were. Certainly, one cannot rely upon Inspector Lestrade to gather all relevant data.”
“Then we shall consider the matter settled!” She clapped me on the shoulder with more force than any man would. Every mannerism seemed a conflicting picture of androgyny, which I gathered was her aim.
“Well then, about that chasm,” She drawled, releasing her lungful; I had never felt kinder regard for tobacco. “I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that I never was in it.”
“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”
He took his leave and Ms. Holmes grasped my hand as a man would. “A pleasure,” She said cordially, “You’ve been to Afghanistan, I perceive.”
My Sherlock, my miraculous Ms. Holmes, embraced me with an ardor I had scarcely imagined. She savored me like a fine cognac and drew me to her body as she had unceasingly drawn me to her soul. I was adrift on the thrill of a chase through dark London alleys, the ecstasy of an expertly bowed aria on a much loved Stradivarius, and the mutual passion of shared revelation all at once. Every stumble in our journey, every lingering tragedy, was made worthwhile in her deep abiding kisses.
“I am, sir,” I acknowledged, gesturing at Mrs. Hudson, “May I offer you a cup of tea?”
I was resting fitfully on the settee when Ms. Holmes returned with a slam of the door and flair of her coattails. “Do you recall the words of Darwin on music?” She asked without pause in divesting her coat. A glance at the clock told me it was later than the concert alone would have taken her. “He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.”
I could scarcely hear, and yet I felt my lips form the shape, “What?”
The location she led me to that evening was not Covent or St. James or any other classical venue, but a common music hall. I could not hide my surprise, yet as she commanded a path through the crowd to the edge of the stage, I ruefully revised my thinking. My friend wore a man’s waistcoat and black tails, why should she avoid a place where crossdressing was the main entertainment. She had no qualms about visiting vulgar or disreputable places in pursuit of knowledge. This, I believed, would be no different.
All at once, her pacing was abandoned, and I found Holmes a hand’s-breadth away from my face. Although we were not touching in any way, I was boxed in by her leaning on the armrests. Her breath rested sticky and smoky upon my mouth. I could discern flecks of silver and blue within her pale eyes.
“Let me see—what are my other shortcomings? I get in the dumps at times, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It’s just as well we ought to know the worst of one another before we aim to live together.”
“I hope you preserved all precautions, Mrs. Hudson?” Holmes was saying as I entered. My survey of the room revealed our longtime housekeeper, beaming proudly, and the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening’s adventures. It was a wax-coloured model of myself, so lovingly rendered that it was a perfect facsimile. Save, of course, for the blatant exit wound right through my left eye.
but mere injury and distance.
“At last, I was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery, which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities.”
“I found the list you crumpled up,” She began with a twitch, “‘Her limits’? Hardly representative, my dear Watson. You can do better than that.”
“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.” Seventeen steps, I resolved to remember, so that I might check her work and be sure she was not merely boasting to play a trick upon me. Invigorated by her point, Holmes reached to the table and tossed me a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open. “Since you are interested in these little problems, perhaps you may try your hand at this. It came at last post, read it.”
“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well played violin is a treat for the gods—a badly-played one—”
“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. A cabinet size plate is too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.”
“A pair, by the sound,” said Holmes, with a low whistle. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.”
Something in this statement moved her. Holmes brought her frighteningly astute gaze to rake over me.
It was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Ms. Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence she dispatched a long telegram. To whom, I did not know, though she’d announced our intention to interview the first officer on the scene. We then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade.
“You don’t mind running a chance of arrest?”
“This photograph.”
Through my tangled locks I did not catch her expression as she declared, “So it is that I find myself in my old armchair in my own old room, my old friend Watson in the other chair.”
“You got out quick from Maiwand, thank heavens.” His braggadocio remained evident as he looked down upon me with false sympathy. “Terrible business that, I'm fairly sure it was the stress of the thing that drove your husband into the fever. He had a faithful service, you know, even while we weren’t certain if you’d be joining him.”
“But your client—”
I was so flabbergasted, I proceeded to gape helplessly as she crossed the room. She scowled at the overcoat she’d carelessly dropped, muttering curses at the Inspector that he surely didn’t deserve. At last she’d donned her own outerwear, scooped up the offending article, and fled the flat, all while I stared dumbly on.
Finally, looking up through her lashes, she murmured, “Yes, I would do that too.”
I confessed, “I am full of curiosity. I should much prefer to hear now.”
“Holmes,” I sighed, “Please, I will burn with curiosity if you do not tell me all.”
“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?”
I swallowed. “You play the part impeccably. The stage lost a valuable asset when you devoted yourself to crime.” As I by now expected, Ms. Holmes appeared touched by my praise.
Holmes flicked her wrist as if to call it a trifle. “As I said, this Park Lane Mystery must be resolved, and I’ve devised a method for doing so that shall lay to rest all these loose ends. It shall be a hard and dangerous night, made better, I hope, by your company.”
“I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous,” Ms. Holmes announced. “No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done.” Modesty, I was finding, was another of Ms. Holmes’ shortcomings. “And what does it amount to?” She shook a telegram, from where I had not noticed. “Banal ‘puzzlers’, some bungling villany so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official ought to see through it.”
“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, sinking down in her armchair and closing her eyes.
“I have come this far with you, Ms. Holmes.”
“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. It’s a simple matter applying to ordinary life a few precepts of observation and deduction. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”
“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none.”
“Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile. Might I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show yourself, and then to look up at your rooms—the starting point of so many of our little adventures. We will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you.”
“And for present expenses?”
“None.”
The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.
“You had my note?” He asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. “You had been told I would call.” He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
“And how did you find out?”
“I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.
With an air of humoring me, Sherlock took up her position in her favored armchair across from mine, reaching automatically for the cigarette case. Her delicate fingers struck the match, and the room filled with light. It was as if the months of absence were but a moment now past.
“Did you discover what you needed?” I gently eased the conversation forward.
“And his age?”
I alone know the absolute truth of her demise, and should such a day come that I may release these papers, I would rather the events be fresh in my mind.
“How shocking then,” Holmes cooly retorted, “That there’s been another murder, not one hour ago.”
“There was not a doubt Colonel Moran had done it. He had played cards with the lad, Moran undoubtedly played foul and Adair threatened to expose him, he followed him home from the club, and shot him through the open window. The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose. It was unequivocal: I could come home.”
Three o’clock, seventeen minutes past, ante meridiem; that was when I heard the slightest creak from the downstairs. Holmes must have entered the building with utmost care to be so silent. Torn between the conflicting urge to run downstairs and to cower in bed, I remained paralyzed, hardly daring to breathe. The whisper of her bedroom door closing sounded blissful, like church bells, when I had feared her gone forever.
It was clear that I had made a good choice of flatmate, for Ms. Holmes was not difficult to room with. Her habits were regular: it was rare for her to be up after ten at night, and she had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes she retreated to the hospital labs, though she set up more and more chemical experiments in her room at Baker Street. Others she would disappear on long walks in various states of dress. Nothing could exceed her energy when the working fit was upon her; but now and again a reaction would seize her, and for days on end she would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in her eyes, I might have thought her under some spell or influence.
“I shall never do that,” I vowed. “You have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world. It would be remarkable from anyone, yet it seems doubly so knowing the obstacles facing our sex.”
. Ms. Adler took a deep bow followed by a curtsey done with an imaginary hem. She strode from the stage, for all the world as though fully dressed, as an assistant used a broom to gather the remains of her costume.
I released a long, sorrowful sigh. “Yes, you had me make certain of that. I spread word to all I could, everyone whose lives you improved, and displayed the condolence wreaths in the window. That was your aim, wasn’t it?”
Cooly, professionally, she replied, “Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?”
“I was sure that I might rely on you.”
“Don’t,” My flatmate shook her head, tension in those little tendons, “Watson, let’s neither of us say anything more tonight.” I watched, frozen, as she took a halting step back, then strode off for her room. I listened as she moved, jostling, noises I couldn’t interpret, that my dread insisted were of her packing a suitcase to depart for good. My legs shook, and I could not say what kept me standing upright, when my soul had seemed to melt through the floor to Hell itself.
“I am to remain neutral, to get in the stable, to watch for you, and at the signal to throw this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to await you at the corner of the street.”
I drained my brandy, and wandered away to procure a bottle of wine. I cared not of the year as I poured large helpings for the both of us. Mine, I started on, while Holmes looked on.
“I’m not kind in the least. You’ve noticed as much.” At her prompting, I conceded the point. “Shall we compare our observations, then?” She proposed.
“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes, with a gesture to the settee. “This is my friend and colleague, Mrs. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?”
I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. While I could not always understand how she made such leaps of logic, I attempted in my small way to emulate her processes.
As he sank to the level of this opening, a slat of light from the street illuminated his eyes. They shone like stars, with a manic glee and malevolence, before he peered along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder, and for an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud
“I’m sorry,” I interjected, “This has been your show of restraint?”
I had initially surmised Ms. Holmes as friendless as myself, and yet she seemed to be visited at all hours by any manner of people. When such a person would arrive, looking desperate and eager, Ms. Holmes would usher me out of the sitting room with countless apologies. I would wait in my rooms while the visitor and my flatmate conversed below. I admit, I would have been suspicious, were it not for the short length of time and the composure Ms. Holmes retained when she called me back down, with ever more apologies.
“I owe you many apologies, my dear Watson, but it was all important that it should be thought I was dead. Several times during the last three years I have taken up my pen to write to you, but always I set it down, lest your affectionate regard for me tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret.”
While I mitigated my grief by distancing myself from the criminal tribulations of London, there was no escaping the tragedy of Ronald Adair. The scandal and mystery of the deed stimulated all of proper society. For myself, although talk of crime left a sour note upon my tongue, there was a singular detail that drew me into the matter: that is the involvement of Colonel Sebastian Moran.
“And you,” I surveyed his stocky musculature and healthy glow, “Made it home without the detour to hospital.”
“Incorrect,” said Holmes, grabbing a cup and downing it swiftly. “Had you observed rather than supposed, you could have deduced as much.”
“Imitated.”
“I am a coward,” I confessed, “And I understand my cowardice pained you. For that I can only apologize and attempt to explain.”
“Ah, Colonel!” said Holmes, arranging her rumpled collar, “
In truth, it hadn’t, not in the manner she implied. The distorted countenance of the deceased had been startling, and yet, I had witnessed mutilations of all kinds on the battlefield, and that was not what clouded my mind. I believe it was simple insecurity. For here was a fine specimen of womanhood, enthused with her work, and to whom no man could hold a candle. As for myself, I had nothing to offer Ms. Holmes in the way of intellect, nor a man as a spouse. The invitation into my friend's world left me more adrift than ever.
“Then why make it in the first place?”
“Where, indeed?”
The fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my companion; with his savage eyes and bristling moustache he resembled no less a tiger himself.
I noted my friend frown. “Where is the occupant?”
“I confess that you had one small surprise for me,” said Holmes. “I did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window. I had imagined you as operating from the street, where my friend Lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you. With that exception, all has gone as I expected.”
“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he said.
Dropping my gaze, she tapped her nails upon the cigarette case in question. I had scooped it up from Reichenbach’s soil, my last memento, and trembling fingers had discovered the folded pages within. Upon my bereaved return to 221B, I could not think of a thing to do with it except return it to its customary place beside her chair.
“Finish your story,” I bade her, so she did.
“Your colleague will inform you of the details,” Ms. Holmes waved him away, “Watson, my dear, I must test the lethality of these pills.”
I heard Ms. Holmes clear her throat. “I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. I do hope you get some rest, my dear Mrs. Watson.”
“I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?”
“Yes, yes, I’m alright, I’m better than alright.” I pulled back enough to look her in the face while still keeping a tight grasp on her arms. As I’d surmised, in addition to her thinness, there was a white tinge to her patrician face which told me that her life recently had not been a healthy one. “Though perhaps the same cannot be said of you, dear friend. Please, sit down and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm.”
My night passed fitfully so that when I observed the dawn light creeping over the horizon, I took myself downstairs. Odd it was indeed to see the sitting room at the unusual hour, and I fled to the kitchens. While I lacked Mrs. Hudson’s skill, I could brew a dark, rancid batch of tea, and this I drank over the sink. I returned upstairs to the desolate flat. In this new bout of waiting, I near chewed my nails to the bone.
“As you say.”
“Then I am yours.”
“No, no, not at all, you’re very kind.” At the refusal, the housekeeper dismissed herself. “I merely chanced to see you enter this house, and thought I ought to apologize for my gruff manner. There was no harm meant, and I am much obliged to you, Mrs. Watson, for picking up my books.”
“Wouldn't he? Moran may act untouchable, but the suspicion weighs heavy on his shoulders as the last to see Adair alive. It would take very little to turn the investigators preliminary questions into an outright overturning of his comfortable retirement. The full scrutiny of the law Moran knows he cannot withstand.”
“You come at a crisis, Watson,” said Holmes, without looking up at my entrance. “If this paper remains blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a man’s life.” At that dire pronouncement, she dipped it into the test-tube, and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crimson.
“By no means."
It was no less than I’d prepared to do, and so I agreed.
“Precisely so!” She whirled around toward her chemistry equipment, yet was arrested by the sight of our visitor. “Inspector Gregson, how fortuitous. I believe you and Lestrade have some comparing of notes to do.” Ms. Holmes had so enraptured me, that I realized with a start that behind her trailed the other Inspector, sans coat.
“No one,” Holmes lazily declared, unmoved from her reclined position by his flurry of movement, “Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”
“No,” I confessed, “Though I wondered how you knew so much. Did Stamford tell you? Or another acquaintance?”
“Dunno, ma’am,” The maid answered. “This ‘un showed up on the list, rooms for cleaning, that is, ma’am.”
“To be allowed at your side once more,” She directed at my stockinged toes, like one swearing to Her Majesty, “Is all I dreamt of for three years. I regret more than I can express through words having left you, and to have left you in the dark, and should you find it in your boundless capability for kindness to let me back, to 221B, to you, I—”
“I’m not the one wasting His Majesty’s time hoping my flatmate will retire to bed so I might sneak out alone.”
Throwing my novel to the floor, I leapt up. “I very well agree!”
“No sign of it?”
“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Watson, and give us your best attention.” Obediently I did as I was told, wondering as ever at her insistence.
“And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, as the constabulary presumed? Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber’s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative.
I had a few minutes after Holmes departed to prepare myself. Concealing my gloves in the same handbag holding the smoke rocket, I made a show of rubbing my hands. A young ostler noticed my act, and solicitously suggested I step into the inn. I replied that I was only on my own for a moment, and could I merely shelter in the stable? Not wishing to refuse a lady of 30 of unknown standing, the boy allowed it, and quickly left me to my own devices. The interior of the stable was warm with the animals’ heat and smelled strongly of fodder. I felt out of place, but not more so than I had in the music hall.
“Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will be on account of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be in spite of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they will have followers. ‘
“There is the writing.”
I pressed my hand to my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked, “The more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men—if there were two men—into an empty house? What has become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.”
Holmes’ mouth curled into a sneer, as though I were a policeman she’d found contaminating a crime scene or a thickheaded witness. Certainly she had never directed that scorn at myself. It stung like salt.
“But he begs you to help him.”
“What is it?” Asked Holmes, alert as a hound to my distraction. I surveyed the street, the faint London bustle, and could spot no familiar figures.
the both of us flushed and giddy. Propping herself up on her elbow, Sherlock drawled, as she ran her touch down my neck, “Now, my dearest Watson, does anything remain for me to explain?”
“May I?” I asked, reaching for the paper. Upon a moment’s study of my outstretched hand, Ms. Holmes lazily acquiesced. I read the account, from an Inspector Gregson, of an American man murdered in an empty house, possessing all his valuables, with no clear wounds to account for the nearby blood and his deceased status. “My God,” I swore, “This is terrible. Surely there is no time to waste. Shall I call you a cab?”
Oh Watson, your powers of perception are unrivaled. Who else could look upon such evidence and form so erroneous a conclusion? You are lucky, my love, that I can read you better than the inverse.
It was perhaps an hour later, after much musing and servicing of the revolver, that I’d collected my thoughts to know what must be done.
“Naturally, my dear.”
“Nonsense, dear. Stay where you are. This promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”
“Your ‘knowledge’ of his character, this came from witnessing his cruelty firsthand, isn’t that right?” A shudder crept through me, eliciting a strange tightening around Holmes’ eyes. “Oh my dear, I wish it were not necessary to recount this.”
Sappho
“You make too much of a trifle,” said I. Although this man was physically unimposing, I was cautious of his interest, and very aware that we were alone. The cabinet concealing my revolver was a pace at my back, a comfortable anchor. “May I ask how you knew who I was?”
“Wait a moment,” said she in worry. “Are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things? I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance.” She’d never apologized for her dramatics before, and I laughed through the tears spilling from my eyes. If this was some phantasmagoria, I would treasure every second of it.
“How else you would you classify your encounter in the lobby of the Bagatelle club?”
“You never were in it?” This, at last, was the crack in my joy. Gone were the half-formed dreams of an addled Holmes residing in some Bernese hospice, separated not by that grim veil, nor
“How did you know it was Afghanistan?” I asked in astonishment. I was quite aware of my burnt complexion and thinness, though Stamford had seen fit to omit it.
She held a human skull that looked far too real and addressed it. “Because you did not love your husband.”
When I would return to the flat, eager to bathe, I so often found myself heaving for breath from some concoction gone wrong. In my frequent absence Holmes alternated between a fierce dive into her chemical experiments and the drowsiness of cocaine. I should so much rather prefer the former, and my disapproval was noted, yet I contented myself that she did not mix her passions.
“Why, a person’s height, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When one writes on a wall, their instinct leads them to write about the level of their own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”
I gave Mrs. Hudson explicit notice of my whereabouts before calling a cab to the Bagatelle club. In the entry room, I requested of the steward the presence of Colonel Moran, and waited, observing what glimpses I could gather. Given that one of their members had only recently been brutally murdered, they were in markedly good spirits.
“You never offered condolences,” I noted to my companion, “And yet you knew enough to use my predicament to your advantage.”
In what condition would she return, I wondered, if she was to at all. Would she reek of exotic perfume? Would her cheeks and shirt collar be smudged with rouge? Would I catch a small bruise upon some exposed flesh? No, these were signs reserved for kissing, I knew not what effect… I hesitate to write the word as much as I did think it then…
“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” She remarked, tugging off her black leather gloves. “As a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned.”
“Excuse me, Jane dear,” ventured Mrs. Hudson, and I dragged my focus from the fireplace, “There’s an elderly man wishing to speak with you. Should I show him in?”
Holmes retorted, “Truly, Your Majesty. I am well aware, you hired me not only for my pristine reputation, but to claim plausible deniability should I bungle the matter. No one would believe the word of a woman, let alone the epithets your people could pile upon me, isn’t that right?” The King sputtered, and I coughed into my hand, thinking unkindly of him. “There is no reason you should deny it, I accept these risks as a cost of doing business. I tell you this now to assure you: no one shall look at you twice. Using your generous funds, I have employed the workers inside for the day, and impressed upon them the virtue of discretion.”
“Naturally. Three undetected murders in one year, truly, Lestrade?” Holmes chided out of habit, and as the inspector’s jovial demeanor dropped, she uncharacteristically seemed to note her lack of tact. “But you handled the Molesey Mystery with less than your usual—that’s to say, you handled it fairly well.”
“Neither overmuch,” Holmes remarked, scribbling upon her telegraph pad, “A mere confirmation. I shall be with you in an instant, Watson.” I seated myself in my favoured armchair, and poured myself a finger of brandy. Alcohol had become my sin, as Holmes had hers.
His voice thickened with implication, “She’s never shared company with a man, ma’am. Not one for a husband. If she were truly a man, not the farce she plays at, I'd be well within my rights to toss her in the gaol for hard labor.” He shook his head. “You're a respectable lady, ma’am. You needn't throw your lot in with her.”
“I biffed him under the chin and slipped through his grip,” said Holmes, reducing the encounter to a few insubstantial words. “With a horrible scream, he kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands. But for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he went. With my face over the brink I saw him fall for a long way. Then he struck a rock, bounced off, and splashed into the water.”
She was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied her immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. There was something in her masterly grasp of a situation, and her keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study her system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which she disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to her invariable success that the very possibility of her failing had ceased to enter into my head.
“The right track!” He barked jovially. “My lady, we have the man under lock and key. Just wait until Holmes gets back, I’ll have her sweating bullets at my tale.”
Smiling that enigmatic smile, Holmes said faintly, “Grit in the instrument.”
“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.”
above all the talents you possess, and
“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”
“She will not sell.”
She did not mean to wound me, I’m certain, but wound me she did. Had I not been a discrete and steadfast partner in her investigations? Did she think me so prone to hysterics, like the ladies she abhorred? So certain she must have been of my injudicious nature to risk my loss of friendship. I stood on shaking legs and glided to the window, intending to distract myself with the pedestrians below. “Waston,” I heard her entreat, though I ignored her, looking through my reflection to the ordinary people below. Surely they were not living through so riotous an upheaval of everything they believed true.
“Inspector Gregson,” I drew a long breath, “You're right. It's not your place.” The Inspector shifted, and we allowed silence to draw over us both.
“My private note-paper.”
Revulsion, yes, I grasped onto the notion. It was my friend turning to debauchery that ailed my heart. That for all her intellectual superiority she would sink to the tactics of a Casanova to make off with her prize in the night.
“One April night when home returning, I saw him first,” The man sung in a crystal clear, dolce tenor, “Our glances met. His looks with fond affection burning, this beating heart can ne’er forget. And when he spoke in accent tender, with grace beyond the reach of art...”
“It must be recovered.”
“You have but to name it.”
She chose that instant to withdraw a set of complicated chemical equipment from another box. “No, not by trade,” She said, with a tone that told me she was being deliberately counter-intuitive, “Though I gather knowledge of all sorts. One never knows what might be useful.” It was a brush off, and one that I accepted, and we continued unpacking and reordering the flat to our satisfaction late into the night.
Baker Street was a welcome balm to my unsettled nerves. Holmes had beaten me there, and I heard her buoyant tones conversing with Mrs. Hudson as I climbed the stairs to the study.
“The papers name you as one of the last to see Ronald Adair before he was shot dead. I wished to know more of what transpired beforehand.”
His affable countenance didn’t falter. “As charming as catching up with you has been, I’m afraid I’m needed in the club. Shall I call upon you some evening, we could take supper or the fresh air?”
So accustomed was I to her invariable success that the very possibility of her failing had ceased to enter into my head.
She took down a heavy brown volume from her shelves. For many years she had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning names, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which she could not at once furnish information. How she decided which peoples or places were worthy of documentation was unknown to me.
I would not argue with her in French, so I quieted. At last Ms. Holmes appeared, and I gawked. She looked… Like many women I had noticed among the company of soldiers. She wore a broad feathered hat in a shade of mauve that matched her gown, the hem of which sloped behind her so that it exposed the front of her calves in their tattered stockings. Her waist was cinched tight to give her ample curves where heretofore I’d seen none. Her cheeks were overly rouged, so much so it gave her the appearance of a lifelong drinker in addition to one with heavy handed makeup. She tottered when she strut forward, her eyes sharp as ever upon me.
“The instant that the Professor disappeared, before he had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall, it struck me what an extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed in my way. I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death. There were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader. They were all most dangerous men, one or other would certainly get me. On the other hand, if all the world was convinced that I was dead they would take liberties, these men, they would lay themselves open, and sooner or later I could destroy them. Then it would be time for me to announce that I was still in the land of the living.
“Ha, then if she’s half the detective she thinks she is, she’ll find out what we’ve done and give it up. If it isn’t too much trouble, ma’am, I’d rather like to stay and inform her when she gets back.”
“My own seal.”
The rooms at 221B Baker Street consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. It was also accompanied with a housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, who showed us in and took in our curious differences in appearance.
“That
It was some time later that I had the opportunity to remark upon the incident. We were settling our belongings in, Holmes having quite a lot more earthly possessions than I.
“Why did you not attempt to take it?”
“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
It was a later hour, with London well and truly awake and after Mrs. Hudson had delivered a much needed fresh pot, when my flatmate burst from her chambers. In her dressing gown and with her hair loosely plaited, and that manic gleam infusing her, it might have been any other morning. The incongruity of it spun my head.
Holmes poured herself a second cup, and drank it as she had the first. Smacking her lips, she looked down her nose at me. “The opportunity did not arise. We shall instead lead His Majesty to the Inn and retrieve his desire before him. Dress, Watson, and we shall end this nasty business.”
“Is that the ‘services to one of the royal houses of Europe’ you performed?” I asked.
“Damn your supposed point,” She swore. “Remind me, in your list of my numerous defects, did you name me selfish?” I shook my head. “You ought to have, as I’m devilishly selfish. You cannot give me a delightful glimpse of what could be and then rip it away.”
I was taking a light stroll, one of the cheapest attractions London has to offer, when someone tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, a former associate of my brother’s at Bart’s. I was overjoyed to see a friendly face, and yet schooled myself into propriety. He expressed condolences as was appropriate and offered to take me to lunch, which I accepted. I recounted my adventures to him in a rough sketch, finishing as always with my deepest sadness at my late husband’s passing.
“And how are you to look for it?”
H.T. Wharton translation
“My dear woman, what does it matter to me? Supposing I unravel the whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.”
“You have all the subterfuge of those infants you drag out screaming,” Holmes spat, her brows drawn so they touched above her hawkish beak.
“We have tried and failed.”
“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw towards that straw-pile what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?”
I too was in my thin nightgown, but I was too relieved not to be met with last night’s rancor to take offense. “He is coming here?” The pieces came together abrupt. I mustered a smile. “You are to present him with the photograph, of course, how… wonderful.”
“I repeat, state your name.”
“This in mind, I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me. A few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some indication of a ledge. It was not a pleasant business, Watson. The fall roared beneath me. A mistake would have been fatal. More than once, as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I thought that I was gone. But I struggled upwards, and at last I reached the ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I could lie unseen in the most perfect comfort.
So incensed from the short meeting was I that I failed to avoid colliding with an elderly man. In doing so I knocked down several books which he was carrying, and hastened to make apologizes. As I picked them up I observed the title of one of them,
“Get on with it, then,” I teased her, “However did you come to this deduction?”
Holmes threw back her head and let out one of her barking laughs. It ruffled the King, like a large horned owl, yet brought a furtive smile to my face.
“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”
“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?”
“Holmes!” I cried. “Is it really you? After three dreadful years? Can it indeed be that you are alive?”
I summarized for our client’s benefit, “Holmes means to say she has bribed the staff. Your reputation is quite safe.”
“Pardon dearest lover, if in vain I strove, for indeed I’d rather die than lose your love,” Irene sang, letting her voice rise to its highest octave, and for that instant it was not a comical farce or bawdy show, but a truly heartfelt entreaty that caught every breath in the house. “This confession bringing blushes to my cheek, sweeter than all singing is to hear him speak!”
So it was I rose from stoking the fire on stiff and creaking knees, to lay my aimless fingers upon the mantle. The picture frames, rather than preserving sketches or photographs of kin, held newspaper clippings of notable cases. Despite our housekeepers best efforts, my nails caught on droplets of candle wax from ample late nights. The damned skull grimaced up at me, one companion I ought to have divested myself of.
It was a weary Holmes that trudged into the sitting room later that night. Already I had positioned myself at the fireplace, and she paused at the mantle to fill her clay pipe before sinking into the opposite armchair.
“You are certain you do not wish to accompany me? There is always more value in two pairs of keen eyes. You might sit in a nearby shop while I stake my place.”
“Could you be mistaken?” I ventured in as kind a tone I could. “I truly doubt the Colonel would waste the bother on me.”
“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey—such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”
Ms. Holmes smiled, a rare occurrence I was finding, approving and impressed at my efforts. “You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” She said. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel.” There was a lull, filled with the common London rabble and the bouncing of the cab, in which Ms. Holmes reached over and gave my forearm a brief squeeze. “I’m not going to tell you much more of the case, my dear Mrs. Watson. You know a conjurer gets no credit once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”
“All told,” Holmes sniffed, quarter-turning away from me when I did not respond, “You are more her type than myself. It has been so long since I last played the ingénue. Let me see, how would you do it...” She tapped her lips with exaggerated revelation. Clasping her hands to her breast, and adopting a high pitch that nonetheless evoked my cadence, Holmes simpered, “‘Lick you where, dearest one? Good God and Heavens above, whatever for?’”
Ms. Holmes shot me so wounded a look, I nearly did relent. At last, gripping Lestrade’s overcoat tighter, she turned with a flair. “Very well. Lestrade, Gregson, I shall meet you at St. Bart’s, where all will be illuminated.” The Inspectors dithered a moment too long, and she strode forward, planting a hand to each of their shoulders, and all but shoved them to the door. “I must attire myself appropriately, and if either of you deduce the true nature of the crime in that time, I shall campaign for your knighthood hereafter.”
“There’s no room for a mistake,” She answered. “The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse’s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning—I have Gregson’s word for that—it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.”
“Ought I to be pleased or disappointed?” I inquired, uncertain which case this experiment referred to.
I persisted. “Should she be in need of a person to go halves in a flat, I don't see her eccentricities to be a barrier, so long as she’s a woman of reason.”
“I will get her to show me.”
“Was there a secret marriage?”
“Holmes, please!” I exclaimed aghast. Those violinist's fingers grasped reverently at my hem. She bowed her head, brushing faintly below my knee. “Whatever are you doing?”
“Nonsense, I shall find a dog.”
Throwing all sensibility to the wind, I threw my arms around her shoulders in a passionate embrace. Her body, always lithe and now skin and bone, melted into mine through the frock coat of that ghastly disguise.
“Oh yes, me and the other women who dared disobey convention.” In spite of her somewhat grim statement, her eyes twinkled as she settled herself in the opposing armchair, puffing like a steamboat on her pipe.
“I’m left in the dark,” I confessed, wistfully, “As usual.”
She took a few mullish puffs before answering. “Oh yes. The pills were identified as poison—well,” She contradicted herself, “One poison, the other harmless, so as to tempt the victims into a fatal game of chance.”
“Yes.” She clasped my shoulders, a quick, bracing touch, and murmured, “Good luck.”
“Then, as to money?”
When my late husband and I advanced to Candahar with the sepoys and their elephant battery, I became familiar with Rifled Muzzle Loaders and large artillery. It was not until I was in the thick of the three hour duel above the dunes of Maiwand that I witnessed their awesome power. The shells rained like hail and the concussive blasts rattled me to my bones. I stitched and burned and pressed my own skirt into the wounds those explosives caused.
I heard her long, slow, exhale from across the room. “No, you are correct.”
My mind was consumed with Holmes’ attitude; at the outset this had seemed an ordinary case, and yet her fascination at Ms. Adler’s performance disturbed me. Her wide eyes fixed upon the stage intruded in my thoughts. Had she been anyone else in the world, I would have called her infatuated. But this was impossible; Sherlock Holmes did not fall prey to the softer emotions, she was not led by lust, she would not allow this debility to interfere in her work. She was on a case, I insisted to myself, and this passion she exhibited was no different to that she felt at discovering bootprints or gunpowder at the scene of a crime.
, Watson.” Her lips formed a pout of disappointment, comical on her face.
“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”
“Yes, Ms. Holmes,” the constable exclaimed with pleasure, and a lamp at last banished the shadows. Inspector Lestrade looked much the same as the last time he had called upon me, save for his self-satisfied beam. “I took the job myself. It’s good to see you back in London.”
The King stared in amazement. “Irene’s photograph!” He exclaimed. “Certainly, if you wish it.”
My flatmate turned in her chair at last, giving me her customary sweeping glance. “A girl, was it?” She pronounced, rising to fill her pipe from the hanging slipper.
Perhaps I had finally reached my emotional limit, because I watched numbly as Sherlock drew back and gently rested her fingertips to her wet lips. Her oft-piercing gaze seemed feathered around the edges. Though I could muster no fear, I was dumb as I awaited her response.
“You can’t come.”
I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. As my eyes fell upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. The blind was down and a strong light was burning in the room. The shadow of a woman, seated in a chair within, was thrown in hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. I put a hand to my own cheek, the loose wisps of my hair, the shell of my ear.
Mr. Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “She’s hardly a lady as most would classify. A decent enough woman, rather eccentric, has some queer ideas about the state of society. You may not fancy her as a long term companion.”
“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” she remarked, “I should be better able to advise you.”
“The reigning family of Holland,” Holmes told me. Her manner was bored, projecting that the matter was of no consequence. Yet I had been observing my friend for several years now. I could read in her infrequent looks to my direction, never landing upon my face, that there was more she was concealing from me. “A simple task, though delicate, that was concluded primarily through correspondence. This endeavor, on the contrary, shall require a fair bit of legwork!” This deft change of topic brought her gaze to mine, the zeal in her eye quite legitimate. “If you will be good enough to accompany me to the theater tomorrow, say five o’clock? I believe we might get started.”
“You agree?” I may have imagined the slightest brush, like a drop of spring rain, upon the back of my wrist.
“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”
Quite flabbergasted, I recounted what I knew from my brother’s purloined texts, that it was the main clotting agent of the blood. Ms. Holmes was alight with the thrill of discovery, a discovery, she enthused, which would revolutionize criminology and lead to far more conclusive results. I followed along as best I could, and she must have appreciated that.
“That you, Lestrade?” said Holmes into the now incongruously noisy blackness.
“Ah ah,” Holmes placed a finger on my lips, a method that would not silence me if she employed it overmuch, “You underestimate yourself again. You are a woman with an amicable relationship to Scotland Yard, of good standing in the community, and your word would matter considerably against a hot-headed pig like him. If you did have testimony of his ignoble character, tales of savagery in India, perhaps,” I startled, and Holmes swiftly concluded, “Then Moran has very much cause to kill you indeed.”
“Then you did not know her before?” At my silence, he went on, “Forgive me, for it isn't my place, but you may want to reconsider. Holmes is… peculiar. Surely you've noticed her odd manner of dress?” I nodded stiffly. “That's only the beginning. She's a brazen menace, and if the law were on my side, I'd have her locked away for good.”
“Excellent,” Holmes exclaimed in her endearing way, “You carried the thing out very well. Did you observe where the bullet went?”
“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.”
