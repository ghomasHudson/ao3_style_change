“Mycroft deserves it,” Sherlock growled.
“Come on Sherlock,” John grumbled shaking the dragon slightly. A low growl was his only response but he got up, sliding into his dragon form as he exited the tent, tail dragging behind him. The sun was already high in the sky as they shambled towards their shared tent and Sherlock collapsed into his nest of blankets with a thud. John climbed into his own cot, pulling the familiar blankets around him and passing out.
“Please sit,” Bowen insisted with a smile. “I know you're still healing.”Sherlock entered as John was easing down in to a chair, stretching his leg out in front of him. The dragon grazed his shoulder questioningly and John gave him a tight smile to let him know he was all right.
When John woke again the sky outside the cave was dark and a fire was burning nearby, warming the small space. Sherlock was in his human form lounging against the rock wall, thankfully wearing clothes again. His blue eyes were watching John carefully, yet he remained completely relaxed. John sat up slowly, glad to see that the dizziness was gone and scooted closer to the fire where a plate of food was waiting for him.
“Sherlock what is that?” Mycroft demanded from the cave entrance, gesturing at the egg with his umbrella and making John giggle again.
“That was incredible, how'd you know all that?” John stammered.
John woke before the dragon, warm against his belly, the fire just coals. He got up enough to stir up the fire and throw a couple logs on, then settled back against the dragon comfortably. Sherlock let out a long huff of air, tail tightening around the egg and one large paw scratching lazily. John smiled despite their circumstances, never would he have thought that this is where he'd end up in a few short months. He finally got to his feet thinking of all the things that needed done, first trading stones out for the egg, being careful not to step on the twitching tail. He gathered up all the meat that had dried while they slept, putting most of it in his makeshift basket and pocketing a few pieces for himself. He laid out more strips to dry on the stones then a change of clothes and headed out to the river. It was warm out and looked to be around 4 in the afternoon as he stripped out of his dirty jacket and fatigues and slipped down in to the frigid water. He found a pool where the water wasn't moving as quickly that went up to his waist and scrubbed at his arms and chest until he was pink and clean once more. He dunked his head quickly, scrubbing at his curls until they felt less gritty then looked up and realized he had a visitor. Sherlock had woken up and was laying on the river bank watching him, head cocked curiously.
Getting in to some good action sequences. Thanks for sticking around
“Peeping tom,” John muttered, sticking his tongue out at the dragon. He finished cleaning up then climbed out of the river, smirking at Sherlock's widening eyes. He dried off quickly, shrugging in to a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, the shirt clinging slightly to his damp skin. The dragon's tail was smacking the ground lightly, a small stream of smoke coming from his nostrils as he got up, wings raising slightly. “What are you...” he started then gasped as he was tackled to the ground.
“What are you planning?” Sherlock snarled suddenly, eyes narrowing when Zane turned to glare at him.
“What is that thing doing in my house?!” she demanded, pointing accusingly at Sherlock who smacked his tail against the floor in agitation.
They flew for hours, until the sun was rising, before Sherlock started to descend. John was surprisingly comfortable still. Riding without the saddle did have some benefits. He found a cave near a waterfall and landed by the river, letting John slide off as he drank. The soldier wandered around, examining their surroundings and nodded with satisfaction, jumping a bit when Sherlock bumped his head under John's arm. The sun was rising beautifully over the tree tops and John stood there for a while, just watching it, the dragon pressed against his side.
“Yes, Daddy. I’ll be good.”
I don’t want to be
dragon,” he intoned, sounding very wise indeed, “Is the first one.”
Daddy goes on jabbing his big cock up and up and up into Locky’s slippery hole, and he makes loud grunts each time.
“Because I only want to be sweet to you, my darling boy. You are so precious, and so sweet, and I would never do anything to hurt you or scare you. You’re the most special boy and your Daddy loves you.” He lifted Sherlock’s hand to his mouth and kissed the back of it. “Daddy loves you so much, sweetheart, I can’t even find the words for it. That’s why we kiss and touch each other and make each other feel good, right, sweetheart? To show how much we love each other. You’re always safe with me. You can always say no and I’ll stop anything you don’t like.”
“I’m not like him.”
“I was just thinking,” Sherlock picked up his earlier thread. “It’s unfair you’re still carrying the burden he gave you; maybe you could give it up to me a bit. I can carry some of it for you.”
—” His voice broke and he was sobbing, his eyes hot and stabbing with tears, nose filling, clutching hard to Sherlock’s hip. “
, and starts to sigh out the breath. He goes heavy and limp onto his daddy’s chest, and the cold slimy feeling pushes
Sherlock’s voice was croaky, thick with sleepiness and something else that John’s deep gut reacted to. “Yes. Feels good.”
Sherlock’s eyes drifted down and away, greedily soaking up the praise, but bashful about how much it pleased him.
Sherlock shifted his leg, making space for John to tickle the tip of his middle finger in a quick, gentle flutter over the tight wrinkle of Sherlock’s hole. Sherlock pulled in a thick breath—deep but not sharp—his every movement, every sound, muffled as if he were close to sleep, all the edges buffed away to softness. John kept tickling him between the cheeks, and Sherlock let out quiet, low moans in time with the gentle undulations of his hips. His prick swelled and dripped in John’s mouth, and John drew away, trailing saliva between his lip and Sherlock’s foreskin.
“It's not your fault,” he reassured, he leaned his head forward, resting it against Sherlock's broad muzzle. The dragon started shrinking, pulling John into his arms gingerly, wings wrapping around the two of them. He shifted behind the soldier, drawing him into his lap and cradling him gently. John immediately relaxed against him, nuzzling his face into Sherlock's neck. He quickly fell asleep in the warmth of Sherlock's hold, breathing evening out finally.
“Ready to get strapped in?” he asked the dragon who got to his feet and stepped closer. Sherlock moved into John's personal space, staring intently down at him.
Sherlock made his way back to the mouth of the cave, sliding into his dragon form and taking off back toward the clearing to gather their things.
“What's going on with Mycroft?” John asked softly, squeezing Sherlock's fingers to get his attention.
“Sherlock you weren't bonded with anyone, you were becoming hostile,” Mycroft explained probably for the hundredth time, pinching the bridge of his nose. Sherlock didn't say anything more, just adjusted John's head so his face wasn't smashed in to the blanket, fingers ghosting through the blonde curls.
“You’re very welcome. I told you I was going to spoil you.” Sherlock held Goggie up against his neck, just under his chin. “And now you get to choose what else you might like,” John prompted, “to make you feel good.”
Sherlock’s hips began to roll gently as John tickled fingertips over his bottom, holding only the head of his cock in the cradle of his lower lip, letting saliva gather in his mouth as Sherlock pushed in slightly with each movement of his pelvis. He let go a series of soft, sleepy sounds that John found comforting; his boy was safe and cradled in the pleasure John was giving. Tracing fingers down the cleft of Sherlock’s arse, not sinking in, only gliding along, John eventually came to the juncture of buttock and thigh, then around beneath the plump mound, and down the thigh, tracing the valley beside the quadriceps muscle, then up again to grip the plump bottom just firmly enough to guide Sherlock’s hips closer to his waiting, willing mouth. John rolled a wet swipe around the crown then lowered his tongue so Sherlock could fuck deeper into his mouth—just the one thrust, and he stayed, as John’s tongue swirled soft and wet around his oozing cock.
Since then, it had been life as usual—no case on, Sherlock in the kitchen with the beakers and test tubes and Bunsen burner; John doing some consulting for a surgeon he knew, about an injury that resembled one John had frequently repaired during the war—and they hadn’t talked about it again. Sherlock had assured John he was fine and they’d vaguely agreed they might reassure themselves all was well, the next time they took up their Daddy and boy roles. But that was the total of the discussion, and they’d set it aside. They both knew it was there, but neither had an urgent need to look at it until he was—or more to the point, John was—ready.
Daddy looked impressed. “He’s posh, then.”
“Daddy, you’re being silly.”
John shook his head, not wanting to admit that Sherlock’s suggestion sounded like an immense relief. An urge to say aloud, or even act on, the dark things he’d been feeling—was still feeling, still thinking, couldn’t seem to shake—was frightening. He didn’t like what it might mean about him and who he was, even in some small way, deep down.
“I wish I could have wrapped it like a proper present,” John told him, “But I was in such a rush to get back here to you, I didn’t want to waste a minute.” He handed over the carrier bag and Sherlock settled it in his lap.
“You were
I have written other Daddy/Locky stories (none as harrowing as this), which are orphaned works but which you can find by searching the username HideInPlainSight.
“Do you like your presents so far?” John asked.
“You know you can say anything,” John assured him, and kissed softly just beside his swollen, spit-damp nipple, there on the pleasantly brown-pink ring of skin surrounding it. “You can use dirty words if you want to. Grown-up words. I don’t mind.”
Locky thinks this over. He loves the toy box but right now he only wants his Daddy. He wants more of Daddy’s touches—right now his finger is drawing little loopy designs all over Locky’s thigh and it tickles, but in the best way. When Locky pays attention to it, he goes all goosefleshy and gets a shiver that shakes him all through, which makes Daddy do that little laugh again, with his nice smile. “Tickles, does it?” Daddy asks, and switches to a brushing touch with the flat of his whole hand.
“Will that make you feel good? You know Daddy only wants you to feel good.”
Sherlock half-smiled and he squeezed John’s hand. “Some would say our game makes us sick perverts, regardless. It’s only because they don’t live in our heads. It doesn’t feel that way to me.”
“Oh, yes!” Sherlock said quickly, around the candy in his mouth.
“I love
Sherlock was quiet, and had been for hours, the only sounds from the kitchen the soft clink of the glass pipettes tapping the lips of the test tubes, and now and then the scratching of his pencil on a pad of lined paper he kept nearby. Once he even used the rubber, which was a revelation to John—that Sherlock could make a mistake so grave it needed rubbing out. John thought whatever it was must be the fault of the chemicals and reagents and catalysts; human error, in Sherlock’s case, seemed exceedingly unlikely. The soft clink and scrape, Sherlock’s occasional loud exhale, provided a comforting background soundtrack as John sat in his armchair with the morning papers, combing the inner sections for anything that looked interesting enough to share with Sherlock.
“Whatever you need,” Sherlock said simply, and John was reassured.
Sherlock nodded and closed his eyes, heat flushing his cheeks pink.
“I’m not,” John hiccupped, struggling to get the words out, “I’m not
“Oh, what a nice manners,” Daddy says, and rolls up so they are face to face. His hand slides slow all the way down Locky’s back from his shoulder, to his waist, and then over the curve of his bum, and Daddy lets his hand slip all over Locky’s cheek, gives it little squeezes, then harder ones that pull Locky closer. “Give Daddy a kiss, will you, my good boy?”
“I felt something. . .
“Can I touch it now, Daddy? Please?”
“Did it feel different to you? Just now, I mean.”
“Shh, sweetheart, you’re safe.”
“Hear me out,” Sherlock went on, and laid his hand on top of John’s, wrapping his fingers around to hold John steady. “I never went through that. I’m a grown man, without any of that residue. I’m able to process these things in a different, less. . .charged. . .way. I’m not afraid of the things you might say to me, or the ways you might express it physically.”
“Oh! Oh, Daddy,
“Because that would be fun for you, I know—and for me, too—but I can’t let you do anything that could put us in jail.”
“He touched me and when I said
“Can I go asleep?” Sherlock whispered. His eyes were closed, and every muscle was soft with satisfied exhaustion.
“Oi, bed check, mate,” he said, friendly as could be. The light from the hallway illuminated Sherlock’s pale, wide-eyed face as he lay curled on his side under the covers, his dressing gown a rumpled heap on the floor. “Still awake? It’s well past time for boys to be sleeping.”
John spit into his palm, gave himself a few long, slow, tight strokes, gathering pre-cum on the way back. His voice was hollow with breath. “See that? Is that how you do it?”
“Not anymore,” Sherlock said into John’s shirt, and there was a wet spot gathering there from the bit of saliva escaping the corner of his mouth, around his thumb. “Dirty,” Sherlock spit out, and his shoulders heaved.
“Are you coming out, then?” John asked.
, my sweetheart.
“Without even being told? What a good boy you are.”
“If you like,” John told him, and started again with fingers in his hair, petting down the lean, melted length of him. “Just a nap, though. It’s not bedtime yet.” He kissed Sherlock below his closed eye. The tip of Sherlock’s thumb found its way back between his lips. John reached down for the quilt tucked around Sherlock’s knees and dragged it up, wrapping Sherlock in it, kissing his chin, his cheek, his temple, and petting his hair and his neck and shoulder. In no time, Sherlock’s breathing became shallow and drawn out, his lips falling open around his thumb, and John stroked him for another minute or so until he was certain Sherlock was asleep.
“That one? You don't want him,” the seller snorted. “He's gonna be put out of his misery next week. Trouble that one is.”
“Let me see,” he insisted, holding his hand out expectantly. John handed over his shoddy work, blushing slightly as the dragon bent over his leg to work. Sherlock was gentle with him, lifting and moving his leg carefully. He worked in silence for a while, occasionally muttering to himself as John watched. It didn't take long for the dragon to finish and take a step back with a satisfied chirp.
“I'll pack the bags,” Sherlock finally grumbled, pulling away and yanking on his jumpsuit. John stumbled back, plopping down into his cot and watching in silence as Sherlock gathered the things they'd need. Not knowing what else to do John grabbed his blanket, curling up and facing the wall of the tent. He might as well get an early night if they were heading out in the morning. He was almost fully asleep when a warm body slid into the cot behind him, nose nuzzling between his shoulder blades. He smiled softly and fell into blissful darkness.
“Need ta...save it....” John hissed, pushing the dragon's hand away.
“I don't like those things either,” John whispered. “Stay close and I don't think they'll try and make me use one on you.” Sherlock growled again, but followed John to the next room and stood at John's shoulder as the man sat filling out papers. People and dragons alike were watching him and looking at John and that annoyed Sherlock even further. His wings twitched, stretching and closing in agitation.
degree but John would live. He tried not to sigh in relief and instead ripped the rest of the pants leg open, cutting it off above the wound. He found burn ointment next to a bottle of pain medication and handed both over to John along with some clean bandages. “Will you be all right? The dragon asked, getting to his feet and stretching his wings.
“Let's go,” he urged, pulling on John's hand. The doctor stumbled after the still naked dragon, blushing when they passed the spot where John had been tackled and well....other things. Sherlock lead him quickly back to the cave, finding his shorts and pulling them on and adjusting the stones around the egg. John sat to rotate his drying meat, avoiding looking up at the dragon until he stopped right in front of him. Sherlock finally squatted in front of him, hand reaching out to cup his face and rub through his hair. “I'm sorry if I upset you,” he said softly. John immediately shook his head, grasping at the hand in his hair.
He curled up in his corner when they got back, watching silently as John packed then started fiddling around with some long pieces of wood. He snuffled curiously and John smiled up at him sheepishly.
“Shh,” John whispered, one hand going to his temple and the other pressing over Sherlock's mouth. The dragon glared at him but didn't say anything more, helping the doctor sit up gingerly. “Help me up.”
He slipped through the doors by himself, Sherlock unable to fit and started looking around for a release switch for the glass cover. Growing frustrated he grabbed the microscope off the counter nearby and heaved it above his head, bringing it crashing in to the cover. Glass shattered all around him but surprisingly no alarm went off. As the fog cleared John realized it was an egg and heard Sherlock let out a shrieking moan that had the hair on his arms standing up. John snatched the egg, hurrying back towards the dragon who looked very upset. He was shifting and agitated, eyes glancing around rapidly.
“I don't want to talk about it!” Sherlock snapped, tying the ends of his bandage down a little tighter than necessary and making John wince. “Are you all right now?” he asked, voice softer.
“Or we can just take the dragon with us,” Zane smirked, looking up at Sherlock who's eyes were narrowed dangerously.
“What can I do for you sir?” John asked curiously.
“Finding cover so we can set up camp for the night,” Sherlock said simply, heading toward the tree line. John slowly relaxed, leaning his cheek against the dragon's warm shoulder as he walked. Sherlock finally found a cave and kicked some brush into a pile to lay John on, the pine needles forming a cushioned bed. Sherlock sat up him down gently, hand ghosting over his hair. John let his eyes flutter closed and felt the press of lips against his brow before he let sleep take him.
“Sir, I beg you, you don't want to bother with this one,” the man tried again. John turned and glared at the greaseball.
“We'd be happy to sir.” Bowen got to his feet, straightening his jacket and clapping his hands together.
“I know you're still recovering,” Bowen started, leaning forward with his hands clasped in front of him. “But this is time sensitive and most of it will be mounted work. Are you up for it?”
“I knew you were hurting you stubborn ass,” John scolded with a laugh, putting a small amount on the other shoulder that wasn't as badly burnt. He couldn't do as much as he wanted, they'd have to be careful with their supplies. Sherlock chirruped his thanks, then focused back on their path, John settling in to place.
John balked a little when they rounded the corner and found the general with Lestrade still in human form nuzzled under his arm. John coughed a little and Bowen turned to glance at him with a smile.
“Sherlock no!” John cried out, stepping between them. Sherlock stopped baring his teeth, but continued to growl, trying to peer around John at the elderly woman. John stepped closer, pushing against Sherlock's shoulder. As soon as his hands touched scales, the dragon snapped, pulling away from John's touch. He shambled off behind the couch, glaring back at both the humans as he grumbled and curled up on the floor, only his tail visible from behind his barrier.
“You really care about this doctor,” Mycroft commented, glancing at John half asleep and propped up against their pack and a thick wooly blanket.
Several Months Later
“He goes by Sherlock,” Greasy called from outside the cage and the dragon whipped its head around and let out a hissing snarl in the man's direction.
“I really don't think this will all be necessary,” John argued as the men were suiting up. A large crate was rolled up to an opening of the cage and latched securely in place.
“I can see it,” Sherlock said softly, eyes on his plate. “One of my talents I guess, seeing the truth.”
“How did you know?” John asked.
“Can everyone line up please!” a man yelled out from a small constructed stage. A man in general's garb stepped up to the stage watching them all as they organized themselves.
“Sherlock!” John reprimanded even as he was wincing in pain. “Don't talk to him like that!” The dragon dropped his gaze submissively, wings drooping, and pressed his forehead into John's bicep that wasn't currently being worked on.
“This is stupid,” the dragon snarled, hovering close as he took one step then another.
“This is wrong,” the other was arguing. “They're already powerful, why these experiments?”
“I know, I know,” John chuckled. They were halfway through their meal when Bowen slipped into the seat across from them. John tried to clamber to his feet quickly but Bowen waved his hand, indicating he should sit back down.
“Amazing,” John mumbled.
When John returned to the living room washed and clothed Sherlock was waiting in his half human form and had even managed to cut and tie the t-shirt John had left him to his needs. He looked bored but followed John out of the apartment and even managed to hail a cab when John's tries had failed miserably.
He'd been clattering around noisily in the kitchen for a while when he realized he wasn't the only one in the kitchen any longer. He turned and about dropped his cuppa, mouth dropping in shock. A nude, tall pale man was standing in the doorway, dark curls grazing his forehead. He had two small curved horns nestled in his hair and a scattering of scales across his body. Two large leathery wings were curled almost protectively around his shoulders as he took a look around.
“We have property to recover that was stolen,” Bowen explained. “I'll be going in with you with Lestrade. Zane will stay here. I need you to recover the property while I draw everyone away.”
“That's what I want to talk to you about, but it will wait a moment,” Sherlock snapped, rubbing the towel through John's hair and over his face. “Dry,” he told John firmly, handing him the towel and going back to their pack. He found John's med kit and brought it back with him, settling on the ground behind the doctor. John took the water and pain meds Sherlock handed him without another word, going back to his job of drying off. Mycroft settled himself on a rock with a huff, eyeing the egg with curiosity. Once he'd settled the human back between his legs and had ointment in hand he finally looked up at Mycroft.
“Very nice,” the general complimented. “Large enough for riding, good musculature, strong wings. Shall we fit you for a saddle?” Sherlock snorted, looking back at John who shrugged.
“Are you sure you can do this?” he asked John seriously, hand reaching out to run through John's shaggy hair. John found himself leaning into the hand without realizing it and Sherlock smiled softly, thumb stroking the man's cheek bone.
“Help me please!” he cried, gripping the arrow shaft tighter. John nodded sharply, pulling his hand away and assessing the damage. Sherlock had already moved the bag he needed within reach and he grabbed his supplies quickly. The majority of the arrow shaft he broke off, careful not to jar the wound more. He gathered a wad of cotton and a pressure bandage and looked up at the man's scared eyes.
I thought it was a fitting term of endearment/name for a mate for a dragon, no? also a subtle/not so subtle reference to Smaug
“Thank you again,” John said quietly, trying to break the awkward silence. “For protecting me, for letting me ride, for everything.” Sherlock smacked John upside the head with a wing playfully, nuzzling into John's hair and snorting as the hairs tickled him.
“Sherlock,” John sighed, pressing fingers to his temple. “Let's hear what I'd have to do first. If we're riding the whole time I'll have you to take care of me.”Sherlock smirked at that, chest swelling proudly a moment.
“What happened? I thought we were flying,” John muttered, eyes closing again.
Once he was settled, the blanket under his chin, Sherlock lay down next to him, curled on his side and facing him. He didn't touch John except to wind their fingers together, face carefully blank.
The sun had been up for several hours and was getting close to directly overhead when Sherlock started to descend once more. John peered around curiously as they dropped below the clouds and noticed a small village in the distance.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed. “I put you in a recovery facility, you put yourself there when you attacked an intern.”
“We don't have time for the harness,” Sherlock explained quickly. “You're just going to have to hold on.”
“Your package is safe and right there,” Sherlock grumbled when Bowen still hadn't moved to leave, gesturing at the bag on the cot. “Why don't you take what you came for and go?”
“They were not John,” Sherlock snapped, teeth bared in a snarl. “He took me out of that wretched place you put me in.”
“I will not go back there John!” he growled. “Zane is behind this all, you heard them! I will not go back!” His eyes were shifting gold again and John surged forward, grasping Sherlock's face between his hands.

, and
“Pretty boy. Does it feel good?” he asked softly, and drew enough of Sherlock’s crown back between his lips to gently suck, matching the quiet motion of Sherlock’s hips.
“The case,” Sherlock said simply. “You’ve been out of sorts for days.”
“You’re right, I’ve been out of sorts. And all that we learned about that—” the roll of his hand through the air made it obvious to Sherlock who John was talking about.
“Long as it’s not hurting anyone,” John said. Then after a half-second he added, “And nothing illegal. Were you going to say we should become pirates?”
“How old?” Sherlock asked gently.
Sherlock sniffled loudly. His body was tense from his jaw, down his neck and spine, his legs stiffly arranged where John had put them.
John’s throat thickened with gratitude. He nodded and got up from his chair, feeling so much heavier than usual, and opened his arms. Sherlock moved into John’s space, pressed close and wrapped his sinewy, forever-long arms tight around John’s back, kissed his temple. After a few long, pregnant moments in which neither of them spoke, only held on, they broke apart. This time both of them sat, though Sherlock winced a bit as his backside met the seat of the chair.
“I like it,” Locky says, because even though he doesn’t like it at the moment, he knows he will soon be feeling his daddy’s big cock in his bottom and that feels so good—hurts and feels good all at the same time—and Daddy makes lovely noises and says lovely things when Locky rocks his bum, or slides, or bounces. Only big brave boys can take a big cock inside them, and Locky is very brave and big. Sometimes.
. . .” a delicious, low hum from his darling boy, then an open-mouthed moan as John stopped sucking to circle his tongue around again, flick bittersweet fluid from the slit with the tip of his tongue. “
Sherlock shook his head slowly side to side, but after a moment he said into the muffling fur of the toy, “I want you to kiss me. . . my. . .”
“Did you bring me presents?” He lisped a little around his thumb.
ed. John laughed out loud.
“Kisses, please, Daddy.” His voice was hoarse with something like sleep that probably wasn’t sleep. John raised his face and wet his lips, and in the end it was Sherlock who kissed him, his breath still sugary-sweet from the strawberry candies, and John was pleased at his ferocity, licking his tongue into John’s mouth and making a quiet, high noise in his throat.
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed. “I love him. Ned won’t mind; he’s always wanted company in the back of the wardrobe.”
. .” Daddy gives Locky’s burning-hot bottom a rapid-fire flurry of smacks, loud and heavy, and Locky’s willy goes so thick and hard, and he jizzes over his Daddy’s tongue and lips, moaning and whining and with his arms getting weak and wobbly beneath him. When Locky feels the hot waves draining away, he slumps heavily onto his side on the bed, and he finds his thumb even though he’s breathing so hard he can’t really close his mouth around it to suck.
John opened his lips and sank down on Sherlock’s prick, then sucked as he pulled back. Sherlock let go a tremulous moan, partway between pleasure and distress. John hummed approval and sank down again, mouth full of spit, tongue rolling though there was little room for it to move. He sucked harder on the way back, and Sherlock groaned. As John’s head moved forward again, he relaxed his throat to take Sherlock as deeply as he could manage, and slid his hand down along Sherlock’s buttock until his fingers sank into the cleft, and he squeezed, pulling Sherlock closer, barely tickling the perspiring skin between his arse cheeks with probing fingertips. He sucked hard as he pulled back, rocking his head on his neck, drawing a yelping cry from Sherlock. He pulled off and swallowed a mouthful of gathered saliva.
. . .John.”
,” Sherlock was whiney, desperate, and John kissed him on the other areola then, and flicked his tongue against it, the newly relaxed skin wrinkling up a bit in response.
“Is your little prick hard?” John demanded, and before Sherlock could answer, John was reaching down to take him in hand. “Oh, that’s gorgeous,” John gruffed, tugging roughly down the length of Sherlock’s erection. “You love sucking a big cock. You did it so well. Next time I’ll come right down your throat, will I?”
Sherlock nodded, acquiescing.

“Aren’t you the loveliest, most precious boy,” John said quietly. “Shall I call you handsome? Or pretty?”
“You are
. . .”
. . .” Sherlock hummed, thoughtful. “What if it’s naughty?”
John laid his hand on Sherlock’s cheek, pulled him in for a kiss, then bumped his forehead against Sherlock’s temple, stroked his nose up Sherlock’s cheekbone, and finally kissed him again beside the corner of his closed eye. Against Sherlock’s eyelashes he whispered, “I would never, ever harm you.”
Stopping by the door, he found it was open just a crack, and the room was dark. He listened, and within a moment heard a gusty grunt, muffled by the pillow, then a sucking breath. A beat or two of silence, and another needy noise—
“That one was especially sweet.” John tipped his head. “Have another, if you like.”
John sucked his teeth. “Mine, too. We’re all right. You know how to make it feel good right? You were tugging on it when I came in.”
“You do,” John insisted, digging his mouth and nose in around Sherlock’s ear, the hollow of his neck behind his jaw. “You do like it. And anyway I need you to help me come so I don’t get sick.”
Sherlock’s mouth was dry around a croaky, “Yes.”
! But when daddy says he’s naughty, Locky has to watch out because usually what comes next is that Daddy makes him get the hairbrush and gives him loud, hurting spankings. Locky’s bum is already sore from all the grabbing and pinching; he does not want heavy smacks on top of it.
“I’ll get it,” John told him. “But. I don’t want to leave you in here alone if you need me.”
“Oh, look at you,” he murmured, “Look at you, lovely boy. I am going to be so sweet to you. Are you comfortable? I want you to feel like you could almost go right to sleep, and I’ll take care of you. Settle in, sweetheart, get cozy.”

“An encyclopedia of dragons,” John enthused, and tapped one finger on the cover. “Every dragon there is, from A to Z. Starts with, what, apple dragons and ends with zebra dragons?”
“No nap!” Sherlock insisted, and he set his jaw in an almost-pout.

But even still, John’s mind was racing; he wanted to find a

. . .Daddy. . .” Sherlock moaned quietly, and it went straight to John’s prick. He sucked and stroked through a few more cycles before he released Sherlock’s neck, leaning back to look.
“Don’t be ashamed. You’re a big boy. This is what big boys do together. It’s meant to feel good. Does it?”
Sherlock drew a hard breath in through his nose, and John could feel him consciously relaxing, his jaw softening, turning his head to adjust the angle.
. . .pretty,” Sherlock said around his thumb.
“Penis,” Sherlock spit out quickly.
“Oh, what’s wrong, darling boy?” John soothed, though of course he knew exactly what was wrong, had anticipated his reiteration of their rules might provoke Sherlock to a display of emotion. “Sweetheart, you’re fine, Daddy’s got you.”
—he often sent Sherlock off to sleep by rubbing light circles onto his back, or tracing spiraling tracks across his chest or down his arms.
“Go on and tell me.” John’s voice fell heavy in his own ears. He licked his lips, and they stayed apart.
Sherlock sipped his tea and gazed into the middle distance, thoughtful.
“That was a test?” John demanded. “I almost had a heart attack!”
John was going to go insane. He'd been cooped up in the base for a week working the hospital tent and he was about to scream from boredom. Sherlock followed him around helping where he could but even the dragon was getting tired of the menial tasks. One evening when it had been especially slow Sherlock disappeared for about an hour, coming back when the sky had darkened with a load in his arms. John stared at him quizzically, realizing he had his saddle and harnesses in his arms.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” he asked suddenly, eating another forkful.
“His name's Sherlock,” John offered, standing at attention. “Just got him yesterday sir.” The general shooed the man that had grabbed Sherlock out of the room and circled the two slowly.
“We have to stay off the grid a while longer. Mycroft says the army is still searching. They found my harness at the facility so they're assuming we're dead but they can't declare it for sure until they complete their search.”
“You should rest,” he suggested. “I'm going to finish sorting things out with Mycroft.” John made a face but nodded, letting go of the dragon's hands as he got up.
“He's army issue Mrs. Hudson. I put it off as long as I could, you know I did,” John sighed, shuffling her towards the door. “We'll be out of your hair in no time.” She started sputtering, but John managed to get the door shut and locked before she could get anything else in. “You should probably change and get dressed,” John called to the dragon. “We'll have to get going soon.” Another tail smack was his only response as he headed to take a shower quickly before they had to report to the army base.
“Dr. Watson,” the man greeted, shaking hands firmly. “I'm general Bowen. Found a fiery one I see.” Sherlock snarled under his breath, and John swore his hair stood on end with the electrical charge in the air. “My bad,” the general corrected, smoothing his arm hair down. “A lightning drake then.”
“I have to go check out the area,” he said regretfully, eyes still glancing at John's red swollen lips. “Make sure the coast is clear.” But he leaned forward again, kissing John again a little more forcefully and cradling the doctor's head in one hand. When he pulled away this time gold was circling his pupils, teeth sharp.
“I didn't realize I'd smacked my head on the ground so hard,” he explained, looking up at Sherlock with wide eyes. “It was your brother that attacked me.” Sherlock huffed, scooping his other arm under John's knees and getting to his feet in one swift movement. John started at the sudden movement and threw his arms around Sherlock's neck to hold on. “W-what are you doing?” John stuttered then flushed when he realized Sherlock was still naked.
“Come on Sherlock,” John said gently. “Forget about it.” Sherlock gave the dragon one last glare that made the other visibly shrink before turning and following John, wings unfurling slightly. As soon as they had stepped into the next room a man was beside him and grabbed one of his wings without warning or asking. Sherlock snarled, whipping the appendage away and knocking the man back.
“I can do it,” John grunted stubbornly, letting go of the dragon.
“Get some sleep,” John instructed finally. “We both need it.” Sherlock nodded, eyes already fluttering closed and John yawned before laying down next to the dragon comfortably.
John relaxed as they ascended into the cloud cover, patting Sherlock's neck comfortingly. “We made it,” he murmured, pressing his hand against the warm expanse of shoulder next to his knee. Sherlock grumbled, the vibration passing through John's hand and making him smile. His joy was short lived as a blast of heat slammed into them and white hot pain shot through his leg. He clutched the handle in front of him as Sherlock shrieked and lurched, wings beating the air frantically as he looked around for their attacker. A jet black streak went flying overhead and Sherlock immediately snapped his wings in, diving away from the danger.
“I am a dragon though John as much as that annoys you,” Sherlock snapped, easing John down to the ground again. “We are bigger, stronger, more resilient, and faster than anything a human could be capable of. When you surround yourself by dragons, yes, you will get hurt. Yes you will appear weak. Because in comparison to me, you are. But if you compare yourself to your fellow humans, you are quite extraordinary. I mean for fuck's sake your back is in ribbons and you're trying to refuse pain medication and walk about like nothing is wrong. You're amazing John and for the love of all things shiny will you just lay down and let yourself heal....please.” He brushed the doctor's tears away with the pad of his thumb, leaning forward and kissing his brow gently. John finally nodded and accepted the soft kiss to his lips with a hum of pleasure. “That's my ghivashel,” Sherlock smiled, nuzzling against John's cheek. He helped the doctor lay back down on his belly and proceeded to work ointment in to the expanse of his back, hands gently kneading until John was blinking sleepily and quite relaxed.
“Okay,” John said simply. Sherlock's eyes darted to his, searching, assessing. “This is fine,” John reassured. “I'm fine. We'll do something to stop Zane's mad experiments.” Sherlock smiled softly, nuzzling their tangled hands.
“What's wrong with him?”
“Sherlock!” John pleaded. Wings twitched and finally he stopped, slinking back to John's side and flopping to the floor with a huff.
“Go to sleep John,” Sherlock chuckled.
“He's amazing,” John whispered. “I'll take him.” Greasy, as John was affectionately thinking of him as, groaned and went to fetch paperwork and some unlucky handlers.
“Sir, sir, emergency!” John didn't quite know what happened at first except for suddenly it was quite warm. Sherlock was pressed against him, tail curled protectively and wing curved over him, snarling at the intruder who stood there smirking slightly.
“And I want you to pet me.”
! Locky has to pause for breath, gasping, with tears springing to his eyes, but his daddy strokes a hand softly over the spot where he spanked, and Locky goes back to pushing his willy down Daddy’s hot mouth, it feels so good,
. . .?” Locky makes a sound like he is thinking it over even though he knows what he wants. “Can I whisper it in your ear, Daddy?”
“Come on, let's get this over with,” John reassured.
“You are one tough son of a bitch Watson,” Bowen complimented, reaching out and squeezing John's shoulder in what was meant to be a show of awe and instead had John gasping in pain and Sherlock snarling at the commanding officer. The dragon was wrapped around John protectively, wings curving around the man and glaring at Bowen fiercely enough to make the general step back. Mike tutted John gently about not telling him about the other injury and sent Molly to get fresh water as Sherlock slowly relaxed his hold and helped John pull the shirt over his head.
“And what about us?”
“Oh this should be most interesting,” Mycroft drawled, swinging his umbrella.
The two passed the time together in companionable silence until John's relief arrived, then meandered to the mess tent to grab some dinner. They were stopped several times by people congratulating them still, Sherlock preening at the attention, but still not allowing anyone to touch him. This made John smile softly, it made him feel special that he was the only one allowed to touch the dragon. As he was thinking this, Sherlock pressed into his side, chirruping softly and gestured towards the mess tent.
“Tonight, cover of darkness,” Bowen answered quickly, glancing at the still stoic Zane beside him.
'Moriarty', he snarled to himself. His brief moment of surprise gave Moriarty the chance to flip him off, flinging him into a wide tree. Sherlock snarled, baring his teeth and blasting another lightning blast at Moriarty who leaped out of the way. His wing was obviously badly injured, it was hanging at his side, flapping weakly. Sherlock smirked feigning an attack to Moriarty's left and when the dragon lurched the other direction he blasted a shot right to his chest, knocking the black dragon back. Moriarty hit the ground and lay still, wings angled oddly behind him. Sherlock snorted, slamming his paws on the ground in a display of dominance and let a roar escape him. Animal instincts satisfied he took off back towards John, worried about his human.
The compound was huge and John swallowed nervously as Bowen gestured at him and then slipped off in to the night towards his destination. Sherlock waited several moments before descending towards where they would be picking up their package. His wings were tight against his sides and over John's legs and the doctor could feel how tense the dragon's body was. He rubbed over Sherlock's shoulder gently to reassure him and felt him relax a fraction. They crouched behind a retaining wall and waited, John laying flat across the dragon's back until they heard the boom and crumbling of a wall being blown to bits. Alarms started going off and John could see people running toward the commotion when he peered over the wall. He patted Sherlock's shoulder when the coast seemed clear and the dragon launched up and over the wall, running towards where they'd enter the building. A small puff of one of Sherlock's lightning balls fried the opening mechanism on the door and the dragon shoved it open with a creak, barely squeezing through the door. The halls were dark except for some ominous red emergency lights high on the ceiling. Sherlock's eyes were glowing slightly in the dark as he looked around then took off down the hall. The halls were wide enough for the dragon to move down, but if he had to turn around for any reason it was going to be a struggle John was realizing.
“You know exactly where this property is? How to get to it?” John asked curiously.
John laid out the thin bedroll he'd brought under a large shady tree, smiling at Sherlock as he shifted and curled around him protectively. His huge head lay beside his own and John found himself tracing over the pebbled skin on his cheek. Sherlock purred, nuzzling in to the hand a moment, then flicked the blanket over John with a whip of his tail. John chuckled and wiggled in to a comfier position and tried to get some rest.
When he finally left the cave, he headed immediately in to the trees, not even looking toward the river, to go relieve himself. He took his time and was zipping up his fly when he heard the crunch of a stick behind him. “I suppose you're quite irate with me, serves you right,” John taunted with a smirk, turning and immediately going pale. A dark green dragon was standing there, eyes narrowed and wings slightly raised. His chest and neck were glowing gently like he was ready to attack at any second. “Easy,” John said softly, putting his hands up. He heard Sherlock roar from the river and when the dragon turned it's head he took off in the opposite direction, shoving through vines and brambles and feeling thorns cutting at his arms and legs. “Fuck,” he hissed when one caught him under the eye. He cried out when he was struck from behind, a hundred slices like papercuts through his clothes. He hit the ground hard and curled in to a ball, choking back a sob. The green dragon came up on him, nosing him as if to make sure he was still alive. John groaned, his wounds bleeding sluggishly, then heard the crashing of something else coming towards him.
“Okay! Okay....” he soothed, thumbs grazing over the startled dragon's cheek bones. “We won't go back. What do we do?” Sherlock nuzzled in to John's hand, eyes closing a moment.
“Is that where we're going?” John asked. Sherlock chirruped in what sounded like a positive and angled down into his descent. John leaned back, balancing himself in the saddle as Sherlock bounded across the ground, coming to a stop. John slid from his back, shaking out stiff limbs and heading toward the village. Sherlock stuck close to his side, wings hanging half open as if prepared to take off at any moment. As they drew close 3 men appeared on the road at the entrance, standing with crossed arms. John stopped about 20 feet from the men, Sherlock growling softly beside him.
ghivashel- treasure of treasures
When they arrived at the base they were instructed to report to the warehouse so John headed that way, Sherlock striding beside him in his new harnesses. The dragon's head was high, obviously preening in his shiny new harness. The straps blended into his hide well, the leather bags filled with the supplies they'd need. The only thing that stood out about him was the big red cross across a leather chest piece. When they entered the warehouse there were other men there, dragons with similar red crosses on their chest pieces. He saw his friend Mike Stamford from college and waved hello. A yellow dragon was sitting beside him and looked nervous at their approach.
“Fights orders constantly, fights handlers like the devil, plus that lightning blast of his definitely has some kick.” The dragon bared its fangs in a smirking leer if dragons could do such things, lightning crackling over his scales.
“John!” he heard Sherlock yell as the man came stumbling towards them. The doctor glanced up enough to see his dragon shove at the green one with a snarl, intimidating even in his human form. Mycroft was walking more sedately behind him, still in dragon form and fixed the dragon that had attacked him with a glare. Sherlock knelt down next to him, afraid to touch, eyes half gold with rage. “Let's get you back to the river,” he choked, taking him by the forearms. His back and calves seemed to have gotten the worst of the lacerations, but he cried out as he was pulled to his feet, the cuts stretching and bleeding more. “I know John, I know,” Sherlock was hissing in sympathy. “Do you want me to carry you?” John looked torn, he knew it would hurt, but walking like this would take forever and probably hurt just as much in the long run. He finally nodded and set his jaw as Sherlock bent, scooping behind John's knees and around his back. The doctor cried again when he was lifted, leaning his head heavily against the dragon's chest and gasping for breath.
Sherlock had never flown as hard as he was flying now, wings pulling at air, diving, paws outstretched desperately for John's falling body. 'The stupid dolt' he growled to himself. 'Should've said he couldn't fly.' Sherlock desperately snapped his wings back, pinning them against his body in a rocketing dive. They were about a hundred feet above the ground when his paw caught a hold of John's jacket and he snapped his wings open. An air current caught him, pushing him higher as he scrambled for a better hold on John. He pumped his wings once, twice, then glided toward the nearest clearing. He dropped John gently to the ground, coming to land a little further forward then rushed toward the prone man, changing as he went. He shrugged the harnesses off and turned John over, pressing his ear to his chest fearfully. “Passed out,” he grumbled, cradling John more gingerly against him. “Stupid idiot.” John's eyes fluttered open at the growl and he looked up at Sherlock in confusion.
Sherlock seemed perturbed as they made their way to the tent, grunting and huffing, electricity crackling over his scales. It kept stinging John's hand as he was leaning heavily against the dragon to help support his injured leg.
He finally stepped aside, nuzzling into John gently to see if he was all right. John used his good arm to wrap around Sherlock's neck and be pulled to his feet where he stood with trembling knees for a moment before heading back towards the clearing. Sherlock shrank as they walked, shaking out leathery wings and tucking them neatly against his back. He snatched his discarded pants off the ground nearby, yanked them on and steered John to a tree stump to sit on. John dropped happily to his seat, allowing Sherlock to ease his shirt over his head to better see the wound in his shoulder. It was sore more than anything but there were several puncture marks from the dragons sharp claws. Sherlock went to the medical bag, gathering antibacterial ointment and bandages as John watched him in a daze.
John grumbled again as they made their way down the musty hallway. He wanted nothing to do with this, had tried to get out of it, but the army had insisted. As a doctor he would need something to watch his back, something to protect him when he was kneeling over an injured soldier.
“Is he tame?” the man asked gruffly, gesturing at the dragon. Sherlock snarled in response, baring his teeth.
I finally finished another story I was working on so this is next on the list to finish up. So I'm back on this full time (well, it's my main focus, I do still have to work)
short, but it's something.
“Who was that?” John asked when the dragon was gone. Sherlock sighed, eyes closing as he shrank into his human form and John tossed his jumpsuit to him as he finished. Sherlock took his time pulling the clothing on then ran a hand through his curls.
The sun dropped below the horizon as they swung in to their saddles, John adjusting his splint in to the makeshift rig and nodding at Sherlock's questioning look. They stayed on the ground as they approached, the dragons slinking like snakes through the trees.
“About 4 in the morning,” Sherlock replied without opening his eyes. “We should probably leave soon if you're feeling up to it so we can make up lost time.” John nodded, shoveling the rest of the food in his mouth and getting to his feet to check his balance. He felt a lot better after the rest and food and dug a couple pain pills out to push away the hint of a headache, ignoring the icy eyes watching his every move. He shoved everything back into the bags, securing them closed again and picked up Sherlock's harnesses from nearby.
“Sherlock go!” John yelled, urging the dragon down towards the attack. Sherlock leveled out right above the cloud, scooping air and pushed towards it. The whirlwind of air was dispersing the cloud, making it so they could see what was going on. The enemy soldiers had created a sneak attack and were fighting hand to hand with many of their own team. Sherlock was looking around quickly, assessing, then went into a dive. John's hair stood on end as he felt the electrical build up then Sherlock was shooting an attack, taking enemies down left and right. A sonic boom went sailing past them and hit another enemy and John turned to see Lestrade and Bowen had joined the fray. Lestrade was an air dragon and his sonic booms were knocking people over as he created a more powerful whirlwind around them to push the rest of the dust cloud away. John focused back on what they were doing just as Sherlock slammed into the ground, whipping his tail around and taking out two more men as he shot an attack at another. John slid from his back, hurrying towards an injured comrade as Sherlock stayed close behind him. The man grabbed hold of John's arm as he reached him, his other hand pressed to his side where an arrow was protruding.
“It's been a long time since I've been in this form,” he said in a rich baritone, icy blue eyes finally focusing on John. “Is there more food? I haven't eaten in a very long time either.”
John tried to get some rest, he really did, but he woke frequently, usually from nightmares and his hand sought out the dragon without realizing it. Sherlock was always there, pressing in to his reaching hand and chirping worriedly until John calmed. The dragon hadn't slept at all he realized when they went to relieve Bowen and Lestrade.
“It's fine,” Bowen chuckled, slinging the bag over his shoulder. “I'll get out of your hair, you need rest and pain meds. Get well soon Watson.” John nodded, giving a shoddy salute and turned his attention back to the dragon that was curled against his side pouting.
“I did catch a deer tonight,” he smirked, giving John's nose a quick peck and sitting him back up right. “Don't you worry about me, I'm...”
“This is ridiculous,” he snarled to Bowen, getting to his feet and pacing. “I won't have this mission in the hands of such a soft hearted ninny.”
“Sherlock can you carry him!” John yelled up at the dragon. Sherlock shot another attack, smacked another man away then grunted, turning to help John push the man upright. The man looked scared to touch the huge creature but John urged him up, putting him in the saddle and instructed him to hold on to the handle. Sherlock was already attacking again and urged John away from the middle of the fray, keeping him protectively under his wing. The fighting was dying down as they neared the edge of the battle and John thought he saw Lestrade fly overhead, shooting a few more sonic booms. Another shadow and Lestrade landed in front of them Bowen sliding off and hurrying towards them.
Bowen started pulling out some breakfast for them to split as he started attaching Lestrade's harness, granola bar in his mouth as he worked. He followed John's lead, tossing the things they wouldn't immediately need in the pile and dragging some branches over it all for camouflage.
“What's your name?” he asked gently, hands upright in a sign of peace.
Sorry for the long long delay. Sometimes the words just don't wanna come and I haven't had a good writing mood for a while.
“Enough,” John shrugged, patting Sherlock's neck. “Are you going to bring me the package?” The man glanced through the letter a second, then gestured for the two men behind him. They came forward and John realized that one carried a package roughly the size of a melon. John reached out and wrapped his fingers around the string holding the box closed and pulled his hand back quickly. The men didn't move to leave so John backed away, depositing the package in one of Sherlock's packs and tying it closed securely. He stepped into the stirrup and hoisted himself up as Sherlock started backing up. The dragon growled one last time then with a firm flap they shot into the air, gaining altitude quickly.
“I needed a break,” he explained as he buttoned. “It's been a long time since I've flown this far in one day.”
“Well this is Sherlock,” John said, gesturing at the dragon beside him. “Lightning drake, been together a couple weeks.” Sherlock's hide crackled with electricity proudly, making Molly visibly cringe. Mike whistled in appreciation, taking in the dark dragon.
“I...I have to Sherlock,” John stammered. “I can't tell him no, he's my commander.” Sherlock sighed, pressing his forehead against John's, eyes closing.
“No...no,” he stuttered, looking up at the dragon's sad eyes. “I was...enjoying it.” Sherlock smiled, slinking forward until John was caged in his arms, pressing a slow kiss to the doctor's lips. John moaned in to the kiss, tangling his fingers in dark curls, but Sherlock pulled away, pecking him on the nose gently.
“Thanks,” John mumbled as he started shoveling food into mouth. Sherlock only nodded, eyes closing in contemplation. “What time is it?” he asked after swallowing a mouthful.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I'm tired of being a burden!” John snapped finally, turning to glare at the dragon and loosing his balance. Sherlock caught him gently, looking down in confusion. John's eyes had brimmed with tears and his grip on the dragon's arms was tight. “You're always taking care of me, I'm always getting hurt. You get hurt and you just shake it off and go on being amazing. And don't you 'I'm a dragon' me, god dammit,” he interrupted when Sherlock opened his mouth.
“Wake me at sunrise then,” Bowen yawned, patting John on the shoulder as he walked by. John settled himself on the abandoned rock, smiling when Sherlock joined him in human form.
“Get your dragon under control!” a voice barked from across the room, a man stepped forward, a beaded grey dragon beside him. The dragon bared its teeth at Sherlock in challenge that Sherlock accepted full heartedly, starting to move forward still in his human form.
Sherlock managed to knock them all out, hurrying back towards John and grabbing up the only pack they'd brought and shoving it in to the soldier's arms.
“You need to rest,” Sherlock argued, voice softer this time.
“It's all right Sherlock,” John cooed. “Do you wanna leave this place? Go on an adventure?” The dragon's spiky ears lifted, looking alert and the lightning trickled to a stop. “You have to go in this box, but I promise you no more drugs and no more cage after that. You're going to live with me and we're going to go on an adventure.” Behind him he could hear a few of the men chuckling which had Sherlock glaring in their direction again. Haughtily he got to his feet, wings tucking against his side and tail swaying and moved smoothly into the box waiting for him. He curled up like a great big cat and for all intents and purposes went to sleep. The man with the missing teeth silently shut the big cage door and John turned to see everyone staring at him in disbelief. “Shall we fill out that paperwork then?” he asked, stepping out of the cage and past the handlers.
“You're not eating enough,” John scolded as he brushed his hands off and got to his feet. He searched around for his knife, heading towards the deer. “You're losing too much weight. You look like you did when I found you.” A hand grabbed the back of his jacket and pulled him back, throwing him off balance. Sherlock grinned down at him from his awkward dipped position, a smear of blood across one cheek.
“We'll meet back here at this spot. If I don't show up after 3 hours then you're to return without me with the package,” he commanded sternly. “Do not try and come back for us.” John gulped but nodded, feeling Sherlock press against him in comfort. “Now get some rest,” he urged, peering through the trees at the rising sun. “We'll stay here and at sundown we head in. I'll take the first watch.”
Sherlock's eyes were rimmed with gold as they walked back to camp, his teeth sharp and worrying at his lip. The green dragon with Mycroft hung back pretty far, not wanting to aggravate Sherlock more than he already was. When they reached the river Sherlock sat him down right on the edge of the pool he'd used yesterday, slicing through the back of John's shirt with one sharpened claw. John cringed as it was peeled away, blood had already started to dry, sticking in the cuts. “Come on,” he urged, splashing down in to the water clothes and all. He stepped between John's legs and helped him ease in to the water, letting him squeeze his forearms tightly when the frigid water hit the open wounds. “Turn,” he urged, easing him around and letting him lean against the bank.
“Gauging emotional reactions,” Sherlock shrugged. “Assessing weaknesses. The sort of things government officials like to keep track of.”
So it's been a really long time guys. I've felt terrible for making you wait but I was going through some stuff and stress and the words don't come when you're feeling so low. Anyways! I moved to a new town, I'm living on my own with my dog and I love this town. It's got everything I love. There's a Barnes & Noble in walking distance people!!!! I've been here a few months now, I absolutely adore my new job, and I'm incredibly happy. So I'm getting back in to the writing spirit, I've posted what I have already written and I started writing some more this afternoon. I'm on call this weekend so I'm stuck at home and I have a writing streak blossoming in my brain.
“What happened?” he demanded, moving to stand in front of John and Sherlock.
“Can you ride?”
“That was Mycroft,” Sherlock said softly. “He's my brother.”
“If you have a brother, why were you in the dragon center?”
“We don't have a lot of food with us, this was suppose to be a quick run,” John said softly, laughing when Sherlock rubbed so hard against him he almost fell over. The dragon snuffled at the stuff that John had pulled out, shoving the fire starter towards him then ambled out of the cave and took off. John looked at the fire starter, the egg, then back towards where the dragon had disappeared. “Well okay then.”
“Easy,” John soothed, tucking the egg in to his pack and slinging it across his back. “Let's get out of here first.” Sherlock nodded slightly, crouching so John could climb up then took off towards the way they'd been instructed to leave. As they entered the hall that was suppose to be their escape route they ran in to a group of guards all brandishing swords. Sherlock let out a shriek, lightning crackling over his scales and making John's hair stand up. “Sherlock....” John said uneasily, but the dragon was past reason. A lightning blast sent half the guards flying and Sherlock dove in to the rest of them fervently, tail whipping and jaws snapping. One of their swords hit Sherlock's shoulder incredibly close to John's leg and in a second the guard was dead, hanging limp from the dragon's jaws. “Sherlock!” John cried out. “Let's go!” Ahead of them he could see flames licking the walls and the area was filling with smoke. John hazarded a glance back and could see flames in the direction of the lab too. Sherlock must have noticed the flame because he let out a shriek, knocking the remaining guards over with a swing of his tail and taking off again. John clung as hard as he could, body flat against the dragon's as they sprinted toward the doors that were engulfed in flame. Sherlock roared and John almost was jarred off as the dragon slammed in to the flaming doors, sending them flying open. Sherlock barely slowed, exiting in to the fresh air and wings extending beside John. “Wait...Sherlock!” John cried out, but the dragon launched in to the air and he had to wrap his arms completely around Sherlock's neck to stay on. The dragon got to a decent height and flapped listlessly, looking down at the flaming facility. John sat up a little to look too, worried about Bowen and Lestrade. Sherlock narrowed his eyes at something and John tried to follow his gaze but the dragon turned and headed back toward the rendezvous point.
“A dragon! Yes I'm aware,” John grumbled, cheeks flush as he went back to his task. Sherlock chuckled but grabbed another knife to go help. John skinned while Sherlock gutted, setting aside the liver for himself when John made a face at him. While John went out to bury entrails, Sherlock started dicing up chunks of meat, tossing them in to a small pot they had then on to a clean stone. John came back with a tangle of vines and while Sherlock was cooking chunks of meat he started to weave them together in to a sort of basket. When he ran out of vine he had half of a decent sized basket made and seemed pleased. Next he went and gathered several wide flat stones and set them up along the edge of the fire where they would get warm but not hot then started cutting strips of meat and laying it out on to the rocks.
“Sherlock,” John interrupted, drawing the dragon's gaze back to him. “How are we going to survive out here? The army will search for us.”
“John,” he whimpered, and allowed the doctor to lead him to an empty cot. John quickly gathered supplies and started cleaning the wounds, making Sherlock cry out in pain as he scrubbed. When he was all cleaned and wrapped up he curled up on the cot, whining painfully. John hesitated only a moment before carding a hand through Sherlock's dark curls gently. His fingers traced the shape of horns then wrapped curls around his fingers making the dragon purr in delight.
They'd been flying for hours when John realized they were losing altitude. As they descended from the clouds he noticed the ground below them had become wooded and a misty fog was settled over the tops of the trees. The closer they came to the ground, the muggier it got till John was questioning whether or not he'd be able to remove his jacket without falling off the dragon. Sherlock started a wide circle, descending as if to land and John noticed the small clearing below. When they were about 50 feet above the clearing Sherlock leaned and dove, slamming into the ground and bounding a few paces. John immediately slid from his back, shrugging the jacket off and walking around trying to get his balance back. He felt bow legged from riding for so long and Sherlock chuckled in that chirrupy way of his before shrinking down into his human form. He shook the rest of his harnesses off, digging through one of the bags and pulling out a pair of cargo pants that he yanked on briskly.
