Sherlock scooted closer and John wound his fingers into his soft curls, tugging his head back to lick and nibble at his neck again. Sherlock sucked in his breath, tipping his head to let John scrape his teeth gently under his jaw. “Oh,” he gasped. John brought his face down, brushing his lips lightly over Sherlock’s cheekbones and forehead, down the angle of his jaw and over his ear and back down his neck, biting at his collarbone. Sherlock groaned and twisted his neck around like a flamingo, trying to catch John’s mouth with his own. His hand came up to scrabble at John’s shoulders and John took his wrists and pinned them flat to the bed. Sherlock’s mouth fell open and he looked up at John with his pupils huge and dark in his pale face. He managed a breathless “Oh,” again and then John rolled on top of him, kissing and kissing. Sherlock went yielding and pliant, tipping his head back to let John plunge his tongue into his mouth, tasting the sweet softness of his surrender before pulling back again.
“I recognized the address last night. It was notorious as the home of Peter Ricoletti, who was head of the Malavita. Peter Ricoletti disappeared ten years ago and is presumed dead—the Malavita is apparently being run by his former lieutenant now—but the house appears to still be occupied. When I came back this morning I had a look round and there’s definitely been a fair amount of recent activity at the back entrance, which is certainly interesting.”
It was probably less than an hour before Dr. Sawyer arrived, but it felt to Sherlock like an eternity. The intensity of the desperation was far worse than anything he remembered, worse than coming down, worse even than the heat he’d experienced alone in the convent. The only thing that kept him from battering himself to pieces against the window was that he was too far gone to manage walking.
John touched his unhappy face very gently with the tips of his fingers. “I’m not going anywhere, don’t worry. But of course you have to, so you can do something magnificent when you’re grown. What are you going to do, anyway?”
When he finally got himself under control Sherlock stood, looked at himself in the mirror, sighed, splashed cold water grimly over his eyes, and turned up his coat collar to hide as much of his face as possible. Then he left. He had his head so far down trying to avoid making eye contact with anyone that he walked right into the man coming up to the door, who also had his head down to look at his phone.
Gregson led John back to the cluster of buildings and through a low door into a long, cheerful room, with a fireplace at one end and a stove at the other. A woman and a girl a year or so younger than John sat at a large table, peeling potatoes.
last year after the Brexit thing, figured if Europe was going to fall apart I maybe ought to pay attention, so I saw when you got into it with that guy who turned out to be a serial killer. I was like hey, that’s my boy, back with the crazy. All last night I kept thinking you looked familiar, like I’d seen you before, but I couldn’t remember where, and then when I woke up I just knew. It was those eyes.”
“So then I went round to his flat, and the landlord said…” The young woman trailed off. “Am I boring you, Mr. Holmes?”
Garrison shook his head. “No. No way. They blew off the top of his head; I was right there. I was shot in the chest and passed out, so I don’t know what happened after that or how Kristin got away.”
John made a show of strolling the aisles for a bit, inspecting the meagre offerings, before approaching the shopkeeper.
“I don’t need to, she loves talking about you anyway,” Sherlock pointed out, and went back to his book.
“I’m not that desperate yet...too many times having my mouth washed out by Nanny.” Sherlock held up his spoon for John’s inspection. “What do you think this is? I honestly can’t tell. It doesn’t have any taste at all. Is it cabbage or onion?”
“Here.” John got up, vacating his seat by the computer but leaving the toast. He set his notebook down and explained about the Golden Bean.
“Will there be a reply?” John said, getting to his feet. Truthfully he was glad of the chance to get on a horse and escape for a bit. The dread of waiting for judgment was going to kill him before Lord Sherrinford could.
This time Sherlock returned to himself slowly, not with a jolt as he had before but as though he were rising through heavy water. He became aware of the metal under his hands, the chill air of the basement, his own uninjured living body. He was almost unbearably exhausted. He did not open his eyes.
“Liam’s taking care of that; apparently he’s very particular. We’re to bring the whisky. Don’t worry, I’ve already bought a bottle.”
John handed his phone back and Sherlock took it silently. “Anna said she’d been depressed for years,” he said quietly. “She’d hoped university would be a fresh start, but she was very shy, and she didn’t have a lot of friends.”
determined to flirt with him lately? He responded to the rest of Teddy’s conversational overtures with distracted
When they were both down to their pants John took Sherlock’s hand and tugged him over to the bed. “There’s something I need to say before we go any further.”
that. Sherlock knew better than to try to argue with his mother, so he packed his bags with ill grace and grumped off to Greece.
“I used it before when I was away,” Sherlock said. His back was to John, stirring the beans. “Not this time, I mean, the time before, when I was dead. I didn’t have the app then though. I pretended it was you. I had a recording on that phone from a message you had left once saying, ‘You need to eat’, so I set it up so that the phone would call me, and when I answered your voice would tell me ‘You need to eat’.  I thought it would make you happy, that I remembered to eat. But I never had a chance to tell you in the end.”
“John, I need you to come with me to Texas,” Sherlock said quickly. “There’s a serial killer there and one of the families has hired me and you know I’m sure to offend everyone in Texas if I don’t have you along and then someone will probably shoot me so I need you to come.”
--that John had wanted and longed with every fiber of his being but had pushed it down, never even let himself think of it because it was wrong, it was a sin, it was a terrible thing and Sherlock was so pure, so immaculate, so untouchable and he had let
John sighed and leant back against the cave wall, and looked around the cave. It looked so much bigger without Sherlock in it, and John suddenly felt lonely. He closed his eyes and let his wings curl out around him. He knew he should go back to the safety of his clouds, but he couldn’t bring himself to leave. What if Sherlock came back? Unlikely.
He hated being parted from his Alpha already, and when Sherlock got out for good, John was never letting him leave again.
Realising that it had been five minutes and he’d just been staring at the text, he jolted forward slightly, upright and on his feet, not sure what he was going to do, and then cursed as his leg crumbled underneath him and he fell to the floor. Pressing his head into the floor, he breathed deeply and with trembling arms lifted himself up into a sitting position and positioned his leg into a correct position where it didn’t hurt so much.
John shook his head quickly again, still backing up as his Alpha advanced on him. Then, Sherlock’s gaze flickered over his body, stilling on his neck for a second too long. “What’s this?” Sherlock murmured, reaching out as if to touch his collar, and John bolted without a second thought.
He nodded slightly against Sherlock’s neck. Pulling back from John, Sherlock looked down at him, and then pressed their lips together gently. John pressed eagerly into the kiss, opening his mouth for Sherlock to plunge his tongue inside, which he did.
Sherlock simply held it for a moment before comparing it to John’s wings. His gaze turned to John, eyes sharp. “Why did you lie?” he demanded.
He could feel Sherlock’s hesitation through the bond, and then, hesitantly, Sherlock lifted himself off of John enough so that he could lift his head and roll his shoulders.
Oh. Oh! No, no, no! Sherlock had gone after the killer by himself! What an idiot! Why would he do that? Why not let John know? Whining in anxiousness, John paced for a moment, waited for the dot to settle, zoomed in on it, and dashed out the door. Once he was out in the streets, he darted into an alley way and transformed. He had to pause for a few moments, head whirling as he fought to control himself and his instincts.
John blinked in surprise and looked back at the man, tilting his head and gazing at the man – Mycroft – once more, this time picking out the similarities between his mate and this man. Mycroft was looking back at John in both curiosity and disdain.
Carefully, John slowly rolled over onto his belly, and could smell Sherlock’s sudden interest. Sherlock’s weight lifted slightly, and then Sherlock’s nose snuffled down his back and ended at his tail. At a gentle nudge from Sherlock’s nose, John lifted his tail out of the way.
For the next few days, John rested and recovered. He limped around the flat after his Alpha, who bathed him, brushed him, fed him, played with him. When John’s leg had recovered enough that he stopped limping so much, they left the den for the first time. His Alpha had a large expanse of land, it seemed, with plenty of grass to run in, and lots of trees to hunt in. There were two steps out of the den before John bolted. His legs ate up the grass easily, and it felt so good to be outside again! He could smell so much, but he was on a mission. He heard footsteps behind him, but John knew the human would never catch up. And that was okay.
Finally, John knew he had to tell Sherlock – damn the consequences, he was Falling anyway! – so he took off from his cloud, and took deep breaths to calm himself as he flew to the Holmes’ mansion. He hadn’t been here for a reason for Sherlock to see him for over a thousand years. He had an uncomfortable sensation in his gut the closer he got to the mansion.
“Sherlock Holmes,” the Dom introduced himself, reaching out and taking hold of John’s hand in a firm grip that made his wings shiver. The touch was exceptionally pleasing, even if John didn’t exactly know why.
get a reaction – a small twitch of Sherlock’s hand – and John shushed him soothingly, quickly hurrying to the door and heaving the desk in front of the doors, and then the bedframe.
At a nod from the human that spoke, the rest slowly lowered their weapons. All but two. “That’s not a pet! That’s a wild animal!” One protested, a female with dark hair.
Sherlock gave a snort. “Can’t whatever it is wait?” Sherlock demanded. “What if Mycroft had come in here and seen you? Or my father?!”
John hadn’t wanted to go – he would stick to his promise even if Sherlock hadn’t -, but eventually Mike had wheeled his way into convincing John to go, if only so that he could make sure Mike didn’t do anything stupid.
The ‘something’ turned out to be Sherlock deducing others whilst John giggled and praised Sherlock. From that moment on, they were absolutely inseparable – both in school and out of it – and spent every spare moment together. Mostly, they spent time at Sherlock’s house, as John didn’t want Sherlock to have to suffer meeting the rest of his family, and Sherlock never pushed. No doubt he could hear John’s parents’ shouts even from his house.
“You’ve met werewolves before,” Sherlock said, and John glanced over to the doorway to see Sherlock staring at him with a frown.
Sherlock sprinted forward, placing himself between John and the weapons. His heartrate was faster than John had ever heard it, and he smelt scared.
The officers nodded their heads to show that they understood, and John shut the door behind them. He stood back and watched as they poked through his possessions, wrapping the sheet tighter around himself and burying his nose in it and letting Sherlock’s scent soothe him.
“If the rabbit was for me, then why did you run when I caught up to you?” he was asked and John grinning, making the playful noise he always did when they played and watched his Alpha’s eyes widened as he realised John had been playing.
Again, thank you to everyone and I hope you enjoyed my story! If you like, go check out my other stories as they all tend to run on the same basic principals (top Sherlock and bottom John).
John groaned, and tried anyway, wiggling and squirming until Sherlock woke and released him with a disgruntled huff.
Two days after he’d gotten the call (it had taken him two days because he’d been out in the far outer reaches of London tending to a patient – a
“I don’t know,” John admitted, pressing kisses along Sherlock’s jaw and pressing his belly more into Sherlock’s palm.
John nodded gratefully, though Sherlock looked anything but pleased. Of course, what Alpha wanted their pregnant Omega in prison? Lestrade was being nice, even though he had every reason to deny John his request.
“No! Let me go!” John demanded frantically, struggling, but that just caused Sherlock to growl and tighten his grip.
They bought nursery things, and set up a cot in their bedroom, and turned the upstairs bedroom into a nursery, sure that Mrs Hudson wouldn’t mind. They bought a whole bunch of baby things, though it was mostly Sherlock at the shops sending pictures to John, who would either agree or disagree.
“Good… good boy, John,” Sherlock mumbled, eyes closed and his breathing slowly slowing down to his normal rate.
Sherlock pulled back slightly, shock clear on his face and for a moment his face was vulnerable as he asked softly, “You really think so?”
John could feel the tension easing out of him at the gentle affection, his eyes closing. He felt safe, and secure. This human Alpha would care for him and protect him, John could sense it. And in turn, John would devote himself to his Alpha.
Curious, John sat up and whined questioningly. Sherlock strode over to him with a feral grin on his face, and something shiny in his hands. It was silver, and looked like slender linked chains. There was a round tag hanging off of it that was red and had
Sherlock’s grin just brightened. “I’m not surprised. It’s way outside Angel territory – we’re on the very border of Earth and Hell,” Sherlock told him.
Then, the door opened, and Sherlock appeared, and his eyes locked onto John before he shut the door swiftly and suddenly John was being pressed up against the wall. “What are you doing here?” he hissed, eyes narrowed.
This was familiar, and comforting, and John relaxed further, making a soft noise as Sherlock continued stroking his hair. Finally, Sherlock pulled back and pressed a kiss to John’s forehead and murmured softly, “Sleep,” before tucking John’s head back under his chin.
John hummed in reply, and it wasn’t long after that before Sherlock fell asleep, and John followed soon after.
John woke at dawn with a wet patch underneath his butt, and his cock hard. Whining, John reached down and took hold of himself, his other hand sliding back and slipping two fingers inside of himself, causing him to moan loudly. John’s eyes flew open as his brain put together his symptoms, and he realised that he was in heat.
The Alpha licked at the skin below John’s ear, making John give a small mewl of pleasure, and hummed. “You taste better than you smell. I can imagine your lubrication will taste even better,” Sherlock purred into his ear, and John gasped, a jolt of arousal running through him.
John spent most of his time with Sherlock from then on, and hardly ever went back home. Of course, he had to go back home occasionally, but not very often. As promised, Sherlock took care of him. John would have to go back to his house at dinner time, and would eat the meagre scraps from the fridge, then he’d go to his room, crawl out the window and crawl into Sherlock’s room. Sherlock would always leave his window open for John, but they would close it as soon as John arrived, and then Sherlock would sit John down on the chair and feed him a warm, delicious dinner one mouthful at a time until John was full. Then, they would stay up for a while, talking or doing homework, and then they’d crawl into bed together and fall asleep.
“I don’t know what it was. But it was completely and utterly overpowering and I couldn’t even smell you. All I could smell was that smell. But, it was only in the room. There was a trace of it coming down the stairs, but that was it,” John explained, gently moving his head back and away from the tissues as his nose stopped bleeding.
Sherlock pulled a flower from his pocket. The inside near the pollen was black, and faded to blue, with black outlining each petal. It was gorgeous. Sherlock twirled it in his fingers for a moment before he held it forward towards John. “For your compassion and your addiction to danger,” Sherlock said softly.
to be with Sherlock again, but he didn’t want to risk them getting caught and becoming Fallen. He met Sherlock’s stare and just sat there and lost himself in that intense gaze.
John snorted and rolled his eyes. “Right,” John said with a sigh. Then, he lowered his voice and said softly, “There’s an Omega guard here. I passed him on the way in, and I know for a fact that he smelt our bond.”
Like John, she was average looking. Average height, average weight, pale skin, blue eyes and blonde hair. She could quite easily have blended into any crowd. There was something about her though… Something that was bothering John.
John looked sheepish for a moment, and nodded as Sherlock started to stride off, before the Alpha turned and stared at John for a moment, before saying roughly, “Come watch me,” before he turned back around strode off again.
John followed her trail, keeping to the shadows so he wasn’t seen and it didn’t take him long to catch up to her.
John peered over his shoulder and shifted on foot to touch his upper thigh, still stretching as they talked. He saw the way Sherlock’s face tightened slightly, and then he sighed. “Well, not really. There’s Mrs Hudson, our landlady, but that’s about it,” Sherlock told him, “I don’t really have friends, John. Just you. You’re all that I need.”
John didn’t blink, but he sniffed the air thoroughly. Human, male, recently eaten. John could also smell the slightest hint of concern, but it was almost masked by the strong scent of fascination and curiosity. And yet, there was no smell of weapons of any kind on him. Not a hunter, then. This didn’t make John any more comfortable around him. This was a human, who was not to be trusted. John’s hackles rose as the human kept walking forward, and John made an aborted lunge, snapping his teeth, falling on the defensive as panic started to curl in him.
“You’ll have to kill us first,” Sherlock pointed out, and John could have cursed him. What was he doing?
John woke several hours later to the smell of food. His stomach rumbled, and John yawned and stretched out, humming happily as familiar long arms cuddled him closer. Blinking open his eyes, John lifted his hand and rubbed his eyes to clear them. The soft murmur of voices caught his attention, one being the familiar rumble of his Alpha, but the other was unknown.
“Hush, John, it’s okay. Just me,” Sherlock soothed him, and John hummed softly in agreement, nuzzling into Sherlock’s neck happily before drifting back off to sleep.
Sherlock must have triggered his heat, John thought with a groan, and the courting gifts had helped speed it along. John had had a heat once when he first presented, but that had been fifteen years ago and he hadn’t met an Alpha before Sherlock.
Smiling, John picked up the tray and made his way back over to Sherlock, sitting down so that his hip was pressed against Sherlock’s side. The Alpha curled around him slightly and half-closed his eyes as John began to eat, starving.
“Don’t worry, I’m not going to freak out on you,” John chuckled, reaching up and resting his palm against Sherlock’s cheek. “Are you okay? She didn’t hurt you, did she?”
A week passed, and John began to relax again. Sherlock had left the den quite a while ago, smelling of excitement. John was bored waiting for him, and had napped, dozing on the sofa under the warm sunlight, and woke up when Sherlock burst into the den, positively reeking of possessiveness and joy.
They were still sleeping, sated and happy, when Lestrade called early the next morning. “I’ve got a Russian who was almost killed last night, and the consulate is all over my arse,” he told John when Sherlock refused to wake up. “Please tell me you can get him to come over here.”
Sherlock said with such distress that John gave it up immediately. He pushed Sherlock down on his side and tucked himself up behind him, fitting his face between Sherlock’s sharp shoulder blades. Sherlock might have gained six inches and dropped an octave, but he was no wider across, and still fit easily under John’s arm. Sherlock still smelled of lavender and clean soap, but there was a slight undercurrent now, a musky, male scent.
Finally she smiled. “Well, I’d been adopted by Mr. Spock, of course. He taught me his Vulcan mind-control techniques.”
John nodded. The little girl’s sleeves were rolled up to her elbows and the hem of her dirty dress was wet; she had evidently been doing exactly that. “Do any of the gentlemen ever touch you?”
“Are you going to tell me where we’re going now?” Sherlock asked after several minutes of tense silence.
The man sighed. “All right.” He leaned across the counter and John took the hint and leaned in as well. “I got some stuff for pain. Beta health service doesn’t provide anything anymore, not the good stuff, and what you can get other places ain’t enough for some. It’ll cost, though, I’m not giving samples out of that.”
“Not particularly,” Sherlock said. It was a warm evening in June and the windows were open in his flat on Montague street, the sound of traffic and voices drifting up from outside. “I read chemistry at university.”
They got out. John was left standing on the edge of the pond, wet, bleeding, and trembling with rage. He took several deep, calming breaths before looking around for Lord Sherlock, who was standing behind him knee-deep in the muddy water, wide-eyed with shock.
he was not thinking about that. The taste of blood in his mouth brought a bright flash of memory and Sherlock jerked his bleeding finger away and balled his hands into fists, willing himself to think about the ketamine, about the case.
“--overdo it, I know, but I was introduced to those dreadful ninnies at tea and I knew I would have to take drastic steps. They’re
John's face cracked into a smile as brilliiant as a desert sunrise. "Getting on that plane and coming here...it was the craziest thing I've ever done, I thought I had to be mad to think you could ever..."
“I had a note from Irene,” Sherlock told John on the way home, rattling along in the privacy of their hansom cab. “Sir James has canceled some of his engagements, but only because he’s having so many meetings about the diplomatic crisis. Apparently his Sunday night in is sacrosanct, though. We’re all to meet Saturday to go over the plans.”
Sherlock thought frantically. He tried to scramble to his feet, the back of his coat and trousers soaked through, but slipped on an oily-slick patch and fell again. “We need an ambulance!”
The amusement was gone now; John’s smile was fond, and a little sad. He still showed no sign of anger though. Sherlock had worried that John would view his getting off with multiple strangers as very much
John had been wondering something. “Why did you let Moran handcuff you?” he asked. “Why not knock him out as soon as he came in?”
Sherlock heard his father’s indistinct murmur, the suppressed sound of his mother’s stifled tears. He had never known his mother to cry. Silently, he slipped back upstairs and curled himself on his childhood bed, staring at the blank ceiling, wondering if he would ever feel happy again.
They ended up staying at the Palace for a week. It was an ordeal for John, who alternated between constant terror that he would commit some grievous faux pas and crushing boredom. Sherlock spent a few days feverish and coughing and complaining of his head, but overall he recovered far more quickly than John had dared hope.
Lady Smallwood’s house was impressive—a grand Georgian pile with the famous gardens, probably lovely in a month or so but currently looking rather bare and chilly—but another car was pulling away when they pulled up, which did not improve Sherlock’s bad temper. He’d secretly hoped the tea party had been a pretext for getting Sherlock on his own.
“No, I’m not,” Owen said. “Henry and his men believe that I am assigned as a liaison between the military and outside aid agencies. The truth is that I’m a special investigator.”
“How?” John asked, startled. Sherlock’s initial plan for their escape had hinged on the assistance of Mike’s mother, who had agreed to purchase clothing and provide a night’s shelter. Sadly, the unfortunate woman had died of a fever a month before, and Sherlock was still trying to come up with an alternate plan.
John looked around and said something sharp Sherlock didn’t catch, and there was a lot more arguing and fuss after that, but Sherlock just closed his eyes and held onto John’s hand and decided to let everyone else sort it out.
Abdulleyev nodded once, and the man with the pipe brought it whistling down on Sherlock’s injured arm. It happened so fast Sherlock did not even have time to flinch. He screamed, trying to pull the arm back, but Abulleyev grabbed his wrist and the pipe slammed down again, shattering his elbow. Sherlock doubled over, unable to get enough air even to scream, retching and dry-heaving over the narrow table.
Mrs. Turner had pulled a sheet of printed paper from a drawer and was busily filling it in: name, address, Veilgarden District, date. She handed it to Sherlock and said, “Now mind you bring that back, paper’s dear these days.”
John leaped up, mortified, but Sherlock groaned and grabbed his wrist, trying to tug him behind a large boulder. “Let’s go back here, nobody will see us.”
“Mycroft’s putting them in protective custody,” Sherlock said. He seemed please at Mycroft’s having to do anything.
“The man at the florist was definitely part of the operation at the time I was there,” Sherlock said to Mycroft. “I don’t think we ever met face to face, but I’m certain his dossier was in the files.”
“Do you think Mrs. Hudson would wash these?” Sherlock asked. John swung the torch around. Sherlock had got rid of the skirt and was now trying to wriggle out of the tights, no easy task.
was quite effective on Sarah—“Oh my God, go, I’ll manage”—so he rang back Lestrade who said, “Brilliant. Sherlock’s going to meet us over there; I’ll be in front of the surgery in five minutes to pick you up.”
“I’m scheduled through the end of December, and I’ll still do those Sundays and Christmas, but after that I’m out,” he told Sarah.
Mycroft shrugged. “Among other places. And it has an extremely powerful generator—I imagine Dr. Trevor’s machine uses a great deal of power, and we don’t want to black out the whole neighborhood.”
. He flung the chocolate bar at the window, where he knew it would bounce harmlessly off, but then it slid under the sofa. Sherlock took a deep breath and looked around for something to kick.
“Mr. Rhodes and his wife lost their infant son that year,” Schneider explained to the rest of them. “He had been struggling with guilt and anger and the court agreed to probation, which he scrupulously adhered to, and even attended group counseling classes as part of an anger management program.”
“Thank you,” John said as he led them out. “You’ve been very good, and we won’t forget. God bless you for your kindness.”
Sherlock’s mouth quirked. “Enormous…to about five people in the world, one being myself, and at least two of whom won’t agree with my findings.” Sherlock didn’t sound at all unhappy about this. It was one of his more endearing qualities, that he found his greatest pleasure in the puzzle itself rather than in any acclaim or recognition.
“The police? Why would we want the police? It’s a telegram has to go right away, and I’m to wait for a reply, too.”
Sherlock shut his eyes, ridiculously. A minute later the same voice, more distant now: “He must have..” with the words following too indistinct to understand. “Doubled back up the path”, maybe, or “run off down the beach”. They were moving away.
When John got home, he went straight for Mrs Hudson’s flat, knocking on the door. She invited him in, and once he was settled with a cup of tea and some biscuits, he inquired after his last gift. To his relief, she did have it. After thanking her, John took his leave back to his and Sherlock’s flat and retreated into the bedroom with the small box and envelope.
If Sherlock had been so close that he couldn’t even tell John and had simply taken control like that, John knew he couldn’t protest. After all, he would much rather Sherlock sent him into his Omega instincts than attacked a whole bunch of guards and prisoners because they’d tried to take John.
John had been dozing at the time, but he instantly sat upright at the movement. “Sherlock!” John cried happily, throwing himself at Sherlock wrapping his arms around Sherlock and pressing their lips together.
John spent two days with his skin burning hot, and an aching need that his fingers couldn’t fill. John had no concept of time, he only knew that Mrs Hudson would come up every once in a while and leave bottles of cool water and a wash cloth outside of the bedroom door. When a wave had passed, he would stumble upright and collect them then push the furniture back into place and take a long drink and sometimes wash himself before sleeping and waking up in a wave of heat and his fingers already inside of himself.
Sherlock gave a low bark and shook his head. “Oh well. I’d best call Lestrade to lock the girl up. Can you go back to the flat?” John suggested, then sighed as Sherlock shot him a look. “Fine, alright, you can stay. But then we’re going straight home and fixing you up!”
His phone ringing pulled John out of his sleep. Groaning and grumbling, he sat up and rolled out of bed, finding his phone and blearily looked at the time. It was already one pm, but John was still recovering from his heat. He accepted the call and snapped, “What?”
After eating, John got up and walked about the room, stretching out his muscles so he didn’t get stiff, and because he was bored, whilst Sherlock stayed on the bed, stretched out and watching John lazily.
It was odd, being on the other side of things, John thought with a fond smile as he walked with Sherlock by his side down through the streets of London, in the energy world and watching the egg tucked safely under Sherlock’s chin, watching the baby dragon inside twist and turn to point them in the direction of its Matched.
Sherlock was by his side in seconds, removing John’s hands from his bare belly (he’d stopped wearing clothes a few days ago), and then Sherlock’s large hands were smoothing down his sides and over his baby bump, then lower, turning John onto his side and sniffing at his hole. “Shift, John,” Sherlock commanded after a moment, “It’ll be easier.”
Sherlock’s gaze lifted and fixed on him, pupils blown wide with arousal and wings arched high over his head in a display of pure dominance that sent John’s knees giving out from under him and he ended up kneeling on the floor.
The girl was harder to catch than anticipated, even with her phone number. On the third day, John needed a break. There was nothing he could do here to help, and Sherlock was in a foul mood, rejecting anything John said viciously. But he still refused to let John out of sight.
,” his father spat the word ‘Holmes’ like it was poison, “any more. We’ve been very patient with you, John, but this can’t continue.”
Sherlock pulled out the white pencil John had made for him. “You’re JW,” Sherlock murmured, looking up at John, who gave him a sad smile. “We were best friends,” Sherlock remembered, and John held his breath, waiting. Sherlock’s sharp eyes flashed up at him, hardening. “You left me!” he accused angrily, shoving the pencil back at John. “Why? Why would you do that?”
First of all, Sherlock was around more than he had been before. Not just as in staying in the flat (because
When they were inside, John went into the kitchen to make tea, and Sherlock went over to the couch to think, palms pressed together.
John changed into the clothes that Sherlock had bought for him – avoiding the panties for now – and wore the jeans and one of the shirts and the cream woollen jumper.
John glanced up, and Sherlock smiled down at him in praise, which warmed John from the inside. “Good boy,” Sherlock murmured, and lifted his hands to caress John’s cheeks. Sherlock bent down as John stretched up, and kissed him heatedly until John was limp in his grasp, with eyes closed and whimpering softly.
“End of the bed,” Sherlock instructed in a murmur, and John nodded, curling up on the end of the bed (he hadn’t gotten changed after his bath so he was still nude).
“Sherlock,” John murmured softly, placing his hand over Sherlock’s to comfort him. Then, he addressed the guards and Lestrade, “If you do arrest me, I need to have constant contact with my mate. I’m sure you’ve all heard what happens to Alphas who are denied their mates.”
Turning sideways, John noticed that his belly was rather heavy, and it took both of his hands to cup it fully. The sound of the door downstairs opening and closing and the familiar sound of Sherlock’s footsteps running up the stairs had John panicking and he flung the towel off of him and dived for the bedroom to hopefully try and get dressed before Sherlock could see his naked body in the light of day, and then realised he wouldn’t make it in time and transformed into his wolf form.
Instantly on alert, John tore his gaze from Sherlock and found a brunette staring at him intently. When their gazes met, she grinned at him, and beckoned him closer. She seemed familiar, but he couldn’t place his finger on it. Darting a glance at Sherlock, torn, he didn’t want to leave his spot in case Sherlock got into trouble, but he was curious. Stilling, he took a deep breath. Last time he’d followed his curiosity, he’d ended up losing Sherlock for almost four years.
John shuddered, and shot a dirty look at Mike. “Nothing. He’s just trying to help,” John told Sherlock, fingers gripping onto Sherlock’s arms. John took in a deep breath and told Mike softly, “Mike, this is Sherlock.”
John froze his wiggling as Sherlock snarled in warning, grip tightening around him again and shifting so that Sherlock was lying half on John, a leg and an arm wrapped around him whilst Sherlock’s nose pressed against John’s neck, breathing hot breath onto the sensitive hairs there. John sighed in frustration. There was no way he could wiggle free now. He was well and truly stuck.
Sherlock snorted, burying his face in John’s hair, and the Omega could feel his smile against his scalp. “I could never,” Sherlock told him in a haughty tone, wrapping his arms around John and ensuring that he couldn’t go anywhere.
John sat on the edge of the bed, and Sherlock’s fingers twitched before grasping onto John’s shirt, his body seeming to relax even more. An eye peeked open, and John noted that this eye was glazed over and unfocused (most probable cause was the amount of pain he was in, but a fever was also a possibility), and focused on John for a moment before a wry smile passed over his face and his eye closed once more as he relaxed with a content sigh.
John gave Sherlock a smile and turned to go, then turned back and said as a thought struck him, “I never received your last gift,” he told Sherlock with a slight frown.
“I am,” John acknowledged with a smile, leaning a little closer to her. “You don’t think I’m a little old for you?”
But, John wasn’t the same as the others, he had a closely-guarded secret that set him apart from the rest; he could turn into a human. John hated it, and he did his best to never transform anywhere near his pack. At least once every two moons, John’s body would betray him and he would turn into his hated human form. It was weak and pathetic, no claws or fangs, his eye sight was terrible and worst of all he had no protective fur. Whenever he felt the change tingling at the base of his tail, he would run as far away from the pack whilst still being in their territory, and wait it out until he was able to turn into his wolf form once more. John also discovered that he could understand the human language. He’d overhead hunters one day, and realised with surprise that the noises they were making was a language that he could understand. It because yet another secret.
John smiled suddenly, bright and warm. “Good. Okay then.” He rubbed Sherlock’s hair again. “Try to get some sleep, okay?” He gave his head a final pat and squeezed his stiff shoulder. Sherlock could hear his quick light footsteps going down the stairs, stopping briefly at Mrs. Hudson’s. The front door shut.
John took his hand and led him to the sofa. “Love,” he said and stopped. He cleared his throat. “Sebastian Moran is dead. He was found this morning in his cell. It looks like suicide but…he had to have help. Owen is investigating. He’s thinking it might be Moriarty, sending a message.”
Molly put on the shoes as Sherlock gathered their clothing, rolling it all up in his cloak, and tossed it out onto the dusty landing. Then he closed and locked the door and pushed the shelves back in place. Kate had opened the back door a crack and was peering out. “We’re clear. Let’s go.”
When he was quite young, Housman fell so passionately in love with his (straight) roommate that he failed his exams. He remained devoted to this friend, Moses Jackson, for the rest of his life, rushing publication of his second volume of poetry so that Jackson could read it before his death. He even wrote a poem for Jackson’s wedding (to which he was not invited) that echoes Sherlock’s toast in TSOT, describing himself as the friend who yields “you o’er/To her that hardly loves you more”.
“Now, we’ve only three more classes in the term, so I’m looking forward to seeing your finished projects next week,” Lady Smallwood told them at the end of class. “I’ll be offering this again next term, so I hope to see you all back again. Also, I know many of you will be going away over the Easter holidays, but for those that aren’t: I’ve received permission from the Order to hold a bit of a tea party the Wednesday after Easter. The holiday can get a bit dull if one’s stuck in town.”
Feeling celebratory, Sherlock took himself off to the en suite and cleaned up, putting on his pajamas and dressing gown, and then went to the kitchenette to see about his Christmas dinner. The croissant was hopelessly stale, but he still had two pieces of chicken, and there was whisky and even chocolate in the mini-bar. Good enough. He carried his feast back to the sofa, toasted the Queen, and then collected his phone to check his messages while he ate. Voice mail: one from Mycroft—good God, really?—one from his parents, one from Molly, one from Mrs. Hudson, another from Mycroft. A text from Lestrade wishing him a Merry Christmas and one from Sally Donovan, of all people:
Sherlock could tell by the way her eyes flicked to John’s that the “small affair” idea was new and probably for Sherlock’s benefit, but John didn’t seem to mind. “I wonder if Harry will manage this one?” he said. “She’ll probably show up late and with an awful gift, like Sleeping Beauty.”
John remained leaning against the wall for a minute, eyes closed and body shuddering, one hand still knotted tightly in Sherlock’s hair. He felt Sherlock fumbling as he tucked John away and then his head shifted, back and down, and John opened his eyes to see Sherlock sitting back on his heels and opening his own zipper. There was a sudden crackle of fireworks and the semen splattered on Sherlock’s face sparkled red and blue.
Hobbes let herself in with her key midafternoon and Sherlock heard an indistinguishable buzz of voices—Mrs. Hudson sticking her head out to see what was up, probably—and then Hobbes’ stolid tread up the stairs, humming seguing into outright singing this time. Sherlock gritted his teeth, but the song oddly fit his mood (“Shake it off, shake it off”), so he waited until she reached the flat before he started shouting at her to stop.
“You could have knocked me over with a feather when I came in and saw her on your lap starkers,” John said, still giggling.
“I’ll take you to get tea, but tea and biscuits is not dinner. We’ll go through a drive-through someplace. What do you eat at home, when you’re out and about?”
John climbed down, a little shakily, and the guard unlocked his shackles. It was a relief to be able to rub his wrists. Sherlock had his head down beside him.
Sherlock opened his eyes and Mycroft looked at him steadily. “I know what you aren’t asking, Sherlock. I know what doesn’t fit together for you. And all I can say is…I don’t really know. Love is blind, after all, and parental love is surely the most blind of all. And Eurus was always very, very good at misdirection.”
He had the wind in his face going out, which produced a whole new ache in his arms and shoulders, not entirely unpleasant. When he finally turned back the wind was behind him and the late afternoon sun lit the water gold and for a moment he was flying again, skimming over the water the way he and Redbeard had in his mind long ago, and Sherlock laughed out loud in sheer, unexpected delight.
“Oh, they’ve already been round, searched the house. Housekeeper gave them a bit of a tongue-lashing for wasting time when they should have been out finding our girl.” Kate grinned at them. “They searched your place as well and they’ve left a team to watch it—your housekeeper barely got out in time. She brought your things though.”
“I wouldn’t know,” I reply while adjusting the condenser diaphragm on Molly’s microscope, idly contemplating the idea of stealing one from the half dozen that came in last week to her lab. These are far superior to the one I stole from here last year.
“That’s true, isn’t it?” Another deep sigh before eye contact is established again. That’s better. “But he wasn’t a very nice man.”
The lowest stiches on his back dip into the water every time he leans back so I can rinse his hair, but I don’t mention how he shouldn’t be taking baths so often. Showers would be more of a hassle with his hands, and given the still pristine state of the flat, cleanliness is probably not something he would be willing to part with for now.
The tremor in my left hand is back. Oddly, I’m hoping your brother might actually have some useful insight on that, being the first one who picked up on its origin and all. Mary keeps assuring me she would be happy to have a groom with an ugly cane and a trembling hand at the altar, but if the presence of your brother could scare at least one of those features away temporarily, then I honestly wouldn’t mind having him at the reception.
Three more boxes have been unpacked. Manila envelopes, printed medical journals, more books. Not enough to fill up the remaining shelves, or cover the desk even.
The date of the wedding is getting nearer and nearer, and I still find myself unable to imagine it without you by my side.
. Mike deserves a reward. A cake perhaps – he does seem to like eating. Mycroft can surely give some advice on the matter.
“Doing what?” comes his reply without missing a beat, and he seems so genuinely confused I feel like hitting something. Or someone. Maybe Sherlock, even.
There’s a moment where I freeze, heart skipping a beat, because surely Mike did not tell Greg about… did he?
Mike is a rather direct person, which has been a trait I’ve appreciated in him right up to this moment, but the sheer offense in his voice catches me off guard enough to let that particular argument go for now.
“Where do you live, then?” he asks me once we’re seated next to each other in a different cab, and I think he’s being a bit too direct but his thigh is an agreeable source of warmth against mine, so I hear myself saying “221 Baker Street” before I realize “But I need to take this to Lestrade.”
“Right then,” he takes another step back, body already angled towards the cab. “Take care, Sherlock.”
Eyes, which are pointedly fixed at Mike, unwavering, and the lack of recognition turns my initial excitement into a quick downward spiral. He probably doesn’t even remember me. Why would he? We saw each other for all of five minutes, and while he
“You’re an army doctor,” Sherlock addresses me abruptly, sizing me up in my overalls, and I barely manage a stuttered agreement in the midst of the abject humiliation I suddenly feel over my very existence as my damned leg forces me to transfer more of my weight onto my cane.
Sherlock seems to be unable to tear his gaze away from the happenings around his shoulder, but he starts leaning away from the doctor ever so slightly as he speaks.
– bleed into my words, but it’s too late to take them back now, and Lestrade’s eyes widen in indignation, and his next words are going to be scolding and full of reproach, like I’m a child to be—
The sounds coming from John’s throat are wonderful – I will need to keep him laughing as long as possible.
Sherlock looks defeated. They are announcing his return, his victory over one of the most extensive criminal networks in history, and yet he looks like he’s bracing himself for a public execution instead.
The bedside clock reads only three a.m., and it takes me almost an hour to convince Mary I’m fine and coax her back to sleep before I dare to reach for my phone on the nightstand. Careful not to jostle her I type out a quick message I can’t help but hate myself for just a little, and I wonder if I will ever be able to stop doing that, even knowing he’s not dead anymore.
Several hours later I have sex with Mary for the first time in almost two months, and manage to sleep through the night for the first time since one year, six months and twenty-four days.
We’re going to move in together, save up a bit and possibly buy a house in the suburbs. She wants a cat, two kids and a fireplace, and I want
The transformation is so stark and abrupt it reminds me of watching a caterpillar emerging in fast motion.
“Surgical needles are not part of the standard first aid kit,” I offer when the doctor takes the glass out of my hand, and it takes me a moment to realize I’m right. God. Of
I’m nearly asleep when the response comes, the bed creaking in protest as I reach for my phone in the darkness, squinting as the artificial light of the screen assaults my pupils.
This fact is further supported by his befuddlement when I inquire about possible sightings of the shooter, of whom we know absolutely nothing about if the D.I. is to be believed, and I can’t help but wonder how the man manages to survive in his continuous state of perplexity. It’s quite the feat, really.
“Isn’t that Greg?” I hear Mary’s voice from across the room, and I look up from the book I’m pretending to read just in time to catch her amused expression before my gaze automatically follows hers, landing on the telly. “What on Earth is he wearing?”

“You said Sherlock was very careful not to push you into a meeting when he came back. Do you think—”
“I didn’t tell him you were coming,” the tone doesn’t hold the same edge as his stare does, but the car is joining the evening traffic at a haste before I can process the real meaning behind the words.

, and for a second I’m worried I misjudged John’s mental stability, and dealing with a meltdown every time he shoots someone will be rather bothersome but it’s John, and John is a soldier so of course he doesn’t disappoint.
, which only serves to fuel my rage as I stomp across the room, grab my cane from where it’s perched by the chair and march back to the hallway, all the while making a point of not looking at Sherlock still sitting on the sofa.
John will go on an ordinary date with a no doubt ordinary person, have ordinary sex and return to his ordinary job tomorrow morning, treating ordinary colds and filling in ordinary paperwork for days, weeks, months,
“Mike,” I interrupt before he could go into any sort of detail about his assessment of John’s perceived behavior, because that would be a futile conversation and futile conversations are not to be had. “While I appreciate your… effort,” mostly, “I’d prefer it if you didn’t make plans to…
Mike is staring at me in clear expectation, and it takes me an uncharacteristically long second to realize that the cellist – who starts to look vaguely green in the face – has nothing to do with his insistence on bringing me along to these outings. No.
I consider telling him I’m not here for something as mundane as socializing, but he looks so genuinely happy at my presence that my thoughts grind to a halt for a brief second.
I’m already in bed when the thought occurs to me that it wouldn’t have been, two years ago. It wouldn’t have been awkward at all.
“Do you even play the guitar?” I try to hit a light tone as I set my bag down onto the coffee table, and I sense Sherlock’s eyes return to me – wary of the novelty of small talk, but not protesting.
“And now you have a new one,” I say while doing my best to stare him down, but I’m painfully aware what my eyes must be communicating to someone with his abilities at deduction.
There were memories I didn’t dare revisit until recently, about you. Some more significant than others, like how my pinkie finger dipped into your blood on the pavement that day, making me recoil at the temperature. I remember how I only started to panic – to

“Don’t bother looking for it. He bought a ticket under his own name, British Airways, Moscow. Hurry!”
I refrain from commenting on that as he collects his coat with another apology sent my way, and agree to a ‘proper’ outing another time, even though we did get to watch the entirety of the game before he was called away.
“Yeah,” I force a smile that may be more for my own sake than Sherlock’s, and head for the door with my bag and cane safely tucked under my arm. “Yeah I’m fine, see you on Friday.”
The owner of the hand has a deep voice, warm and melodic, but he wouldn’t be the first to steal scrubs from a hospital and play a doctor in order to get close to—
Sherlock proceeds to analyze the splash marks on the woman’s leg, insists on looking at a suitcase, and when Greg admits they haven’t found one yet he is off, sprinting down the staircase with childish delight, and I just start wondering how on earth I’m going to get back to the bedsit when he stops, looks up from a storey bellow and goes:
my cane as much as I dragged it along without any real purpose, and I find myself anticipating his words, the return of the challenge he seems to have replaced with
Greg studies me for a long minute (people are starting to make a habit of that), then gives an amenable grunt as a response and clasps a hand around my shoulder, giving it a quick squeeze.
“No need. I’m just going to—” I try to slip past the man (short, short man) without finishing the sentence, but the hands on my arms tighten, and I find I can’t break away without a more forceful approach. I don’t feel like that’s warranted though. Not yet.
No, stop. It doesn’t matter. If Greg knows, then… well. He might have a laugh. Behind my back, most likely. Worse things have happened to you, Watson.
“No, they are not,” John’s tone is light, unconcerned as he continues to push plasters and packets of gauzes around in the box. “But in most pubs…” he trails off, then emerges with a semi-transparent blue tube, flashing a victorious grin. His teeth are very straight. “This
“Of course.” I will likely just put more glue onto the roots. Or forget about it. That usually works.
“You didn’t come to the florist,” is the first sentence I hear upon entering Mary’s flat, and the rush of adrenaline is instant when I recognize the potential magnitude of the error I just made.
Greg storms back into the pub less than two minutes after his departure, coat hanging off half his frame with only one arm in the sleeves.
me within an inch of my life, too,” I finish with a laugh again, but for some reason, the suspicious glint in Greg’s gaze only sharpens at that.
“How’s your evening going?” I ask them with a deadpan expression, which earns a brief giggle from John before he smothers it with a pitifully transparent throat clearing. The corners of my mouth lift up.
Mary‘s voice is croaky and a bit nasal as she turns towards me in the darkness of the room, and my breath hitches for a moment when I realize I woke her up.
The only time he pulls his arm away from his brother is for giving a little wave to the audience, prompted by the person still talking no doubt.  His cast is black. Of course it is.
“Ah, your laptop,” he fishes the mentioned item out from under his jacket, handing it over with just the barest trace of a tremor present in his dominant hand – just like in the pub on that first night, before he said
Mike doesn’t seem to be concerned with privacy issues as the requested address lands in my Inbox less than a minute later, no questions, suggestive remarks, or warnings attached. Mike just might be a friend indeed.
“Lestrade!” I storm into the pub with no care for the bodies I have to shove away in order to get to the D.I.’s usual table, catching myself on the back of chairs more than once before I reach my destination. “It’s Hart! The murderer is Mason Hart!”

I can’t help the giggle that escapes me, and I don’t even care that giggling is all I’ve seemed to be doing for the past few hours.
) to my recounting of a murder carried out by a hardware store assistant, who fancied himself a serial killer after watching a few documentaries and googling “how to remove fingerprints from a corpse but forget about the sheet metal screw I drove through her eardrum”.
The man looks at me like he’s surprised to see me, and I swear I can feel my blood pressure crawling higher with each passing second while he’s making me wait, holding my phone like an idiot.
There is no answer, just like there was none when I knocked a minute ago, but I hear a muffled voice coming from the bedroom. The door opens before I could decide how to proceed, and Sherlock walks into the kitchen with a phone by his ear, held there only by the very tips of his fingers around the black cast.
Ella looks at me for a long minute, and I feel guiltily grateful for the sigh that means she is letting me off the hook.
His focus is instantly taken up by typing out a message, fingers moving rapidly over the keyboard, so I grab my wallet and start counting bills, working on bringing my breathing down to an acceptable rate.
John looks disappointed but is quick to masks it with a polite smile, and that slip of composure shouldn’t tell me anything new about the nature of his interest, yet all of a sudden I can feel my pulse accelerate with a rush of adrenaline, which is an entirely unwarranted reaction on my side, because… honestly.
I turn on all the lights in the kitchen as I place the stolen blood sample on the countertop, and I’m just about to gauge the differences between the two microscopes to see whether the idea of stealing a new one has ample merit, when I notice the small blister on my pinky finger. My
I always imagined I’d feel like the luckiest person in the world if I ever got Sherlock back. I imagined I’d cry like a baby for hours, run my hands through his hair, kiss him and hug him and keep touching him absolutely everywhere to make sure he was alive, that he was real, that he was breathing, that he came back
“Sherlock texted me,” he says, holding my cane out for me to take, smiling. “He said you forgot this.”
“Excellent!” he exclaims before opening the door and ushering me inside with a hand splayed at the small of my back, the imprints left by his fingertips burning long after he removes them.
No. No, Mike is not a cruel person… except that he might not perceive it as cruelty, seeing how he doesn’t even seem to realize the ridiculousness of—
In the afternoon, I will go back to 221B, collect all my stuff that’s still there, and possibly help Mrs. Hudson box up the rest so she could rent the place again if she decides so. We will chat about whether Mycroft will want to keep your violin, she’s going to place a request for the story behind the bullet holes in the wall – again, and I may or may not ask her about the yellow circle of paint on the wallpaper, even though I know it will be me who ends up reciting the story behind that too.
“Yes I do,” my protest is immediate and might hold a bit more anger than strictly necessary, but anger is familiar and better than anything I experienced since entering 221B, so I hold onto it with an iron grip because really, who is Sherlock of all people to suggest that I keep carrying that godawful, rotten thing around without having a good enough reason, a genuine
“Well,” she runs her fingers over my arm that’s settled against her waist, and giggles a little at the way I shiver in response. “I could find something to do for this
I turn back to Sherlock but he’s no longer facing me, and my momentary shock is quickly replaced by worry when I see him tearing at his hair in agitation, muttering things like “goldfish” and “passing the time” and “the
I snap out of the mental picture of John standing in the middle of a scarcely lived in bedsit, scowling down at his phone, and I hurry to fish mine out of my pocket, remembering the ringing that accompanied my ride here with Hope, forcing me to put it on silent.
The latter is a doctor, not practicing, financial issues, knows Mike through shared residency. Uncomfortable with the group but couldn’t find a reason to turn the invitation down, unwilling to lie.
My amusement is rather short lived though, because the man next to Greg starts talking, and when the camera zooms out there is one Mycroft Holmes standing to the D.I.’s right and the camera doesn’t stop its movement.
“Actually, do you know what? Ignore me,” I say as an admittedly weak attempt at distraction, but it’s
I know. I spent half the day trying to talk myself out of coming here at all. If it wasn’t for Mary I’d be still at home, preparing dinner with a considerably lower heart rate and infinitely less anxiety – calmer and safer and filled with regrets, no doubt.
The cold is biting into my hands viciously, making the tips of my fingers go numb by the time I flag down a taxi, and it occurs to me that it’s already winter. There are no obtrusive Christmas lights on the streets however, which suggests it’s either the beginning of November or sometime after mid-January. The temperature suggests the latter. So does the memory of Mrs. Hudson bringing up a cake to my kitchen a few weeks ago, with a single candle lit on top.
Mike Stamford’s greetings have gotten gradually more enthusiastic during the time I’ve known him, (which is an oddity in itself, as I typically induce a gradual decline of enthusiasm in people – usually a rather rapid one), but he’s been outdoing himself ever since he decided I needed to be
, how did I miss that – looks me in the eye, straightens his shoulders, and when he next speaks his voice is devoid of the unsure, mousey quality I came to associate with Molly’s utter lack of self-confidence. The slight tremor in his left hand is nowhere to be seen, his deep blue eyes are shining with conviction, and compared to his initial dismay over putting himself on the spot, he suddenly looks like he is entirely too comfortable with the situation. With
“Right,” John says, tone unreadable, then takes a step back with a decisive nod. “Good. You should avoid—“
“I— y-yes. Exactly. God, you’re unbelievable.” John sounds a tad breathless, and in a second… yes, there he goes with the laugh again. There’s a hint of self-deprecation in this one though, if I’m not mistaken. “So you will need to get stiches tomorrow, latest the day after—“
John pauses in his work with the antiseptic cream, but it’s brief, and he still doesn’t sound offended when he next speaks.
“Look mate… Sherlock,” he starts but I cut him off, mostly because I already know all the arguments he’s going to make, and a little because the way he says my name just requires an immediate response. The mere fact that he remembers it does, really.
‘Yes. As you say, with our history, and having read all your stories, I simply assumed. In fact,’ he continued, ‘I wondered how you were getting away with being so – forgive me again – open about it. I assumed that with Holmes’ contacts in the police that perhaps ... a blind eye was being turned, so to speak.’
On this otherwise quiet day, Holmes, with unusual sociability, had accepted an invitation to attend a charity concert hosted by a former client of ours, on the promise that the soloist was a violinist of world class renown, of whom I had not heard, but whose name made Holmes’ eyes light up.
He flashed a quick smile at that, and there was, I fancied, some genuine relief in it. Holmes is not, as I have stated, a cruel man. ‘I am gratified to hear it. Young Harry Anstruther, I hope, and not that dreadful Stokes?’
‘So you believe.’ I say firmly. ‘I say you are reckless and selfish.’ I am beginning to feel an odd tingling under my skin. The light in the room seems brighter. Is this an effect of the drug, or am I imagining it in my hyper-aware state?
‘I have been. When I started. My first day like this one, I threw up repeatedly, and then got roaring drunk. You're doing much better.' He quirked me a comforting half smile. The unbearable tension in my chest eased a fraction. He continued, ‘You need to try and sleep, if you can.'
John freezes. After a moment, he says, in a voice slightly higher pitched than his usual. ‘You’re not. You said so.’
I surged forward and kissed him again, firmer this time. He tasted of brandy and tobacco, with a scent that was intoxicating and uniquely Holmes. I slid a hand beneath his dressing gown, desperate to be closer still to the warmth of his skin. He began to tremble in my arms. I stopped, suddenly anxious.
My hand reached its destination and I stroked along his length. He gave a cry and arched against me. His free hand grasped mine, halting my movement. ‘The sensation,’ he gasped. ‘Oh god, John, it’s too much.’  I rested my hand on his hardening length, and used my free hand to push his hair away where it had fallen across his forehead, lightly kissing his neck. It my wildest dreams I had not imagined him this responsive; it was almost unbearably arousing.
Sherlock says quietly, ‘Since I – went away. Being without you was unbearable. I didn’t realise. Before. I didn’t know what it felt like. And then you were gone. And I knew.’ He stops, bites his lip, then carries on, ‘I was going to say. Something. When I came back. But -’
There was a strange surrealism to our lives for a while. I felt sometimes as if I was living two entirely different, but parallel, lives with two entirely different, but identical, men. In the daytime, all proceeded entirely as usual. I attended my patients, and my club, and followed Holmes on most of his cases. I disciplined myself to look at Holmes no more than usual, to address him no differently than I would have before. I drew a firm line in my head between our days and nights. To do otherwise would court disaster.
Mrs Hudson’s sigh was audible. I continued, ‘Would you care for any refreshment?’ This earned me a disbelieving glare from our landlady.
We cleaned each other and lay quietly in the darkness. There didn’t seem to be any adequate words. His arms were around me. I rested my head on his shoulder and allowed myself to simply enjoy the sensation of having him so close that I could feel his heartbeat, and hear his breath.
‘About a fortnight before ‘e died, the master as was, Mr Milverton, asked Mr Stokes, the footman as was, to ‘ave some repairs sorted. I never knew exactly what, something to do struct- structur- having to do with building, and some plumbing work. The builder was a right sour piece, but the plumber, Mr Escott, well, he was....lovely.’ She blushed a little, and I thought that she looked, in that moment, quite lovely herself.  I reminded myself that this lovely man was a creation of Sherlock Holmes and once again determined to give him a piece of my mind.
I stood frozen, listening to the sound of my breathing. Sounds drifted in from the street outside, people living their normal lives, whilst mine fell apart around me. I fought the impulse to flee Baker Street. Instead, I crossed the room before my courage could fail me and knocked on the closed door.
I walked across London in a daze. I had no destination in mind, but I knew I couldn’t be at Baker Street without saying something irreparable. Eventually my steps began to find a destination. I needed a friend, someone to talk to, who would listen without judgement. After less than an hour of walking, I found myself outside James’ rooms.
‘Don't be.' His chest was still warm against my side, and I hoped desperately he wouldn't rush to move away. In that moment, isolation was more than I could bear. ‘You did well today. Hold on to that. Nothing was your fault. It's a natural reaction to a bad day. It does get easier.' He sighed, his breath hot against my ear.
He didn’t reply, and didn’t move. I began to fear that I had overstepped some invisible boundary.  After what felt like an eternity of silence he whispered, ‘That’s the second time you’ve said -.’ He stopped.
Her smile faded slightly and she said hesitantly. ‘As I said sir, I don’ know what Mr Holmes’ fees are. I haven’t got-‘
‘Then what?’ He was twisting the pipe in his hands, an anxious gesture that reminded me oddly of her.
I felt an irrational anger at the girl before me, who had in a matter of weeks seen as much of Holmes’ heart as I had seen in half a lifetime of friendship
I twisted my hands together in my lap. This would not do. I, a former soldier, was as good as hiding in a park, scared to face my dearest friend. I had no desire to leave Baker Street. In the cold light of morning I knew that as clear as my own name. Whilst I had denied James' assertion that I loved Holmes as more than my closest friend, I knew that my feelings were such that losing him again so soon would be a blow from which I would not soon recover. I could only hope that Holmes would forgive my outburst and that we would continue as before. But I could not know his thoughts without returning, and facing whatever justified remonstrations he would feel necessary. Fixed on my course, I left the bench and turned my steps homeward.
During the first challenging case after our relationship had changed, it became apparent that Holmes barely planned to sleep, let alone engage in any intimacy.  I grew accustomed to retiring to my own bedroom again, aware that any interruptions from Holmes in the night would be to drag me out of my bed and across London, rather than to his room. Returning our relationship to what it had been should not have been painful, but my desire to touch him was like an ache I couldn’t treat. The case ended in triumph, and we took a meal at Simpson’s to celebrate. On our return to Baker Street, he was in upbeat mood, but I was tired and a little despondent, and went to my room, prepared to retire immediately.
‘This is what it’s like.’ I whisper urgently. The room is so, so bright, but I can’t take my eyes from his face.
‘That you,’ he stumbled over the words, and tried again, ‘that you...love me.’  This last was so quiet that even in the silent room I barely caught it.
‘It’s Mrs Anstruther now, sir,’ she said with obvious satisfaction. I stammered my congratulations as she continued, ‘And I’m so glad as I ran into you, I was hopin’ to find you at home.’
Holmes had begun to pace in front of the mantle. After a moment he stopped and again stared into the flames. His voice trembled slightly as he began, and then gained in certainty as he went on. ‘I am a vain and selfish man.' I stared at him in disbelief. ‘All my life I have done as I wished, with no thought for the feelings of others.' I wanted to interrupt, to point out the demonstrable untruth of this statement, but he continued, ‘I have always believed the solution, the ending of a criminal career would justify almost any means. Too late, I fear, I have realised I may be wrong. In pursuing my investigations, I have twice now caused you distress. To do so once may be forgiven, I think, as in my haste to dismiss the softer feelings from my calculations; I had not anticipated the hurt I would cause. To do so twice, however, is entirely unforgiveable.'
To my surprise, the idea did not seem to cause her distress. ‘I think that might be part of it, sir, yes.  She paused and then said quietly. ‘He did like me, you see, a lot, I think, but…. ‘e didn’t love me.’
Reassured, she continued, ‘But ‘e didn’t mind, said ‘arry was a fool to let me go, and he’d be honoured if I would consider walkin’ out with him a couple of evenin’s. Such lovely words ‘e always had.’ She smiled happily as I struggled to reconcile this romantic image with my own knowledge of Holmes, even as she continued, ‘An’ it turned into nearly every evenin’, he was so keen,’ she caught herself, adding seriously, ‘but always a perfect gentleman.’
Dogtags. John’s. From his army days. Except. Not. Because the name after Watson isn’t John. It’s Mary. Followed by her date of birth. And date of death. He frowns. There are three tags on the chain. He lifts them out.
And it's so fucking hopeful and sincere that John feels his heart tighten in his chest. He won’t fuck this up. He won’t lose this, not again. He draws away slightly, enough to look to the floor where the dog tags fell at some point, disregarded by both. He picks them up, removes Sherlock’s, and hands it to him.
Eventually I fell silent. I hoped I had not overstepped any bounds, but as I finished my drink I felt unburdened in my relief.
He nodded, retrieved the blanket from the floor, draped it around my shoulders, and curled back into his chair. ‘I am sorry about your patient.’
I hurried upstairs, divested myself of my clothes, and threw on my nightshirt. As an afterthought I rumpled my bed. I would have to be back in my room before anyone else woke, but even so leaving it untouched seemed like too great a risk. I turned to head back downstairs and suddenly caught myself. What was I doing? I was risking my entire relationship with Holmes and for what? I leaned against the door frame, my breath coming in bursts, suddenly afraid. A small noise from downstairs caught my attention. Holmes. I thought of him, in his room, waiting. Alone. As it seemed he had been his entire life. I went to him.
‘Holmes, don’t worry, I’m here, I’m fine. All is well.’ I take his face in my hands to make sure he is looking at me. My cheeks are wet and the cooling effect is a startling contrast to the heat of my hands against his face.
I turned. He was standing at the door to his room. He had removed his jacket, collar, and cravat, and his top shirt buttons were undone. He looked at me expectantly and said, ‘Experiments, Watson.’
And not only speechless, but positively incoherent. I looked at him in surprise. ‘You were convinced of it.’ It wasn’t a question.
Sherlock is going through the drawers of John’s dresser when he finds them. He knows that John objects to that sort of thing, but really, this time he has a good excuse. He needs a white shirt, and his are all pink. He has a vague memory of Mrs Hudson saying something, as he loaded the machine, about red pants and white shirts but honestly, she talks almost constantly and he can’t be expected to pay attention to all of it. Or any of it. And he’d been occupied at the time with mentally triangulating the exact location in London that the mud in the centrifuge must have come from given the other variables involved, which he had been right about, obviously, so it’s quite acceptable that he ignored her. Only now his whites are pink. And not even a good pink, which might be nice. A sort of hideous splotchily patterned off-pink. And he needs something vaguely acceptable to meet Lestrade and his barely competent colleagues later.
Still without taking his eyes from our joined hands, he said, voice slightly hoarse. ‘Did you mean it, Watson? Anything in your power to give. Anything?’
A quiet Sunday in Baker Street found me reading our paper in front of the fire, the peace of the afternoon only occasionally broken by the sound of carriage wheels and hooves on cobbles, or shouts from the street below. The weather had been cold all week, and I had been in and out to patients for most of it, so I was relishing the opportunity to stay warm and indoors for the duration of the day. Despite having sold my practice, I had a number of private patients who had managed to fall ill at the same time, leaving me shuttling from one to the other during one of the coldest weeks of the year. Holmes had had a case which had required his presence at Scotland Yard for most of the week, and we had barely seen each other. I didn’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed by this turn of events. Our disagreement and reconciliation of the previous week had left a strange atmosphere in our rooms. Our brief interactions as we passed each other in the mornings or evenings had been fond, but excessively courteous and polite in a manner which was slightly disconcerting.
He gripped me harder and breathed, ‘I want to watch you,’ as he leaned over and sucked gently at my nipple.  I came with a shout that he quickly smothered, covering my mouth with his. He kissed me, gently, fervently, with utter thoroughness as I came down, exploring my mouth, my lips, my face, even as I gasped for breath.
As if divining my thoughts, she said immediately, ‘Oh no, sir, he’d never ‘ad no-one, that was clear as day. I said ‘e was a gentleman, sir, an’ he was, but it was more than that.’ She lowered her voice and almost whispered to me, ‘I asked him to kiss me, you see, and ‘e said as.... he didn’t know how.’
‘She wishes us to track down Mr Escott.’ He leaned back on the settee, closing his eyes and pressing a hand to his forehead. ‘I do not believe my deductive skills will be equal to the task.’
I looked at him fondly. This was my Holmes. I was almost overcome in that moment with the desire to kiss him. To claim him as my love, as he had always been my friend.
I could not know that the seeming source of all light in my world existed still, and was planning his return even then. That moment in my consulting room when the grey world turned to shining colour again will stay with me all of my days.
‘I know,’ I said patiently, ‘but there may be no need for you to do so. Mr Holmes was consulted by the police on the matter of Mr Milverton’s death, and it may be that enquiries he has already made will allow us to find your answer.’
‘I cannot.’ Where my left shoulder met his right, I could feel him trembling. As James had done for me all those years before I slipped my free hand around his shoulders. He said,’ I have never-‘ his voice broke. I pulled him closer, at a loss for the right words. His voice was almost inaudible as he said, ‘I am afraid.’
I opened my mouth to protest, but he continued, ‘Understand, Watson, that I did not know.’ He looked at me again then, a plea for clemency, and I had to fight the urge to move closer, to reassure. ‘I thought that with your marriage, you would not feel the loss of a friend so deeply. Had I known the grief I would cause, I would never have-‘ He broke off, worrying at the skin between his eyebrows with his long fingers as if trying to physically erase the lines there. ‘I-‘ he broke off again, and addressed the carpet at my feet. ‘I missed you terribly. You can have no idea how often I wished to see you, to speak to you.’
Then had come his death, and Mary’s, and any thought of regulating my own mind to the proprieties of friendship had vanished. What did it matter then? More than once I had imagined, in the silence of my room, his voice, his hands, his mouth on mine.
Later, he puts the dogtags back in his drawer. It's months before he looks at them again. He’s digging through the drawer, looking for something else, when his eye catches them. There are three again. Frowning, he takes them out. Sherlock’s is back. But his name is no longer alone, and the dates are gone. It simply says:
‘I must catch a cab or I’ll be late. Good evening Watson.’ He barely spared our client a glance. ‘Miss Robson.’ She gaped at him, her hard fought courage temporarily deserting her, and sank quietly into the dining chair behind her.
Still addressing his glass, he said, ‘I’ve read your stories. It’s clear how much you admire him. And he does indeed seem admirable.’ He flicked a glance at me then. ‘But not perhaps the easiest man to live with.’
A month later, I was walking home to Baker Street on a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon. My morning’s patient had been well on the road to recovery; lunch at my club had been genial in the extreme, and my mood was buoyant. I knew Holmes had been out all morning, but he had stated his intention to stay at Baker Street this afternoon, and I hoped I would find him at home.
He still looked taken aback, but said carefully, 'Watson, I've explained. The deception was necessary to-'
He takes a breath. ‘I will try. God, I swear I will try, but promise me you won’t do this again. Watson. Promise me now.’
‘We talked about ‘is business, an’ my family, an about when we was kids, an about the future,’ - I began to wish I had been a fly on the wall for these conversations – ‘An about my place, you know, the master an’ the house. This went on for nearly two weeks, ‘an ‘Arry kept comin’ round, jealous as anythin’ he was, but I wouldn’t hear a word against John.’ I started slightly at my name, forgetting that Holmes had used it for his romantic alias. I realised that I had put my pencil down and was just listening to her narrative, but she seemed not to have noticed.
‘My good lady, there has been a murder!’ Lestrade spluttered. I placed a restraining hand on his arm.
My heart was racing. God, I wanted to, so very much. I moved my fingers against his cheek. ‘I should go to my room.’
I felt my heart give a lurch. I squeezed her shoulder as firmly as I dared. ‘All will be well, Mrs Hudson, please don't concern yourself.' I said this with a confidence I didn't feel, but she smiled at me anyway, releasing my hand. ‘Thank you, Doctor.' She pulled her shawl more firmly around her shoulders. 'Goodnight.'
I frowned. ‘Holmes, you can’t possibly know that, you haven’t even seen her. It’s on the mantelpiece, next to the skull. Behind the knife.’
He glared at me then, looking almost betrayed, and a memory of another recent argument surfaced between us. He dropped his gaze and his shoulders slumped.
I shot him a glance, stung at what could have been a reference to my losses at the card table early in our friendship, but there was no censure in the comment, and Holmes accusing me of being an open book was hardly new. I exhaled slowly, trying to find the right words. He regained his seat, still holding the unlit pipe and watching me.  We sat silence for a few more moments, before he broke it abruptly.
This most un-Holmsian display of sociability took me by surprise and I blurted, ‘No! No, that won’t be necessary, I’m sure. He’s probably not even in town for long.’ This was untrue. Even a quick glance at the letter revealed the address of his rented rooms and his intent to stay in London for the foreseeable future.
‘Shh, love,’ I murmured. ‘Trust me.’ Slowly, he took his hand from mine and fisted the bedsheet as I carefully, gently, stroked him again. He grew achingly hard, and his breath came in gasps, before he rasped ‘John, I can’t, oh god, I can’t let go.’
I looked back at our guest with renewed interest, adopting my gentlest manner, usually reserved for patients of a nervous disposition. ‘Welcome Miss Robson, do sit down.’
I closed my eyes for a second, as duty warred with desire, then; ‘Wait there.’ I said. I took the stairs to my room two at time, and grabbed my bag, pausing only to throw some more items into it. As I reached the hallway again, Mrs Hudson handed me my coat, throwing my scarf around my neck even as I kept moving past her, Freddy in tow. To my surprise, Holmes was in the hallway. He said, ‘I took the liberty of hailing a cab.’ Then quietly, for my ears only, ‘Hurry home.’ My heart leapt in my chest.
‘No!’ I say emphatically. ‘Just the –‘ I wave my hand ‘– effects are different. But this –‘I put my hand over my heart, without releasing his ‘– is the same. I hate it. Please stop. Please.’
After a while James said, ‘Well, I understand your anger. Even by the standards of great men, that behaviour is….eccentric.’
So he had agreed with enthusiasm, only to discover that the promised soloist had been replaced with another violinist, who, to quote my friend, ‘presumably only took up the violin because the penny whistle presented too ferocious a challenge’. He was now dressing for the concert with every appearance of reluctance, and only my intervention had stopped him attending in his favourite grey morning suit rather than one of the excellent dress suits he had for such occasions.
I slammed the letter down on the table. ‘Holmes, stop.' I didn’t want to hear anything else he might deduce.
‘A personage of the lower classes, Doctor. A serving girl, although she has assured me she has means to pay. I wouldn’t usually bring this to your attention, but there have been some other unusual visitors of late.’ She sniffed.
I laughed. ‘I’m afraid you can’t get out of the concert now, old chap. Besides, you’ll only intimidate the poor girl. Now hurry, or you’ll miss the start.’
I summoned a weak smile. ‘Forgive me, my mind wandered for a moment.’ I rallied myself. ‘May I ask then, Miss Robson, if you do not wish to continue the engagement, and you believe Mr Escott did not love you, why you want to find him?’
‘Watson, try to imagine the tonnage of things you cannot conceive of,’ he snapped. It was a deliberate barb and a poor one. I ignored it.
‘It’s concern, it’s affection, it’s –,’ I couldn’t say the word. What if they were wrong? I crossed the room, intending to take him in my arms, to show him my meaning.
‘Alright, Watson.’ He says soothingly, ‘Whatever you like.’ He is kneeling in front of me again, looking into my eyes and away, his gaze flitting over me. He is deducing me, analysing the effect of the drug cocktail I have taken, and I find I like it. I like being the focus of Holmes’ attention. I can feel his gaze on me like sunlight. My clothes feel heavy where his hand moves across them. Only my current sensitivity to touch alerts me to the fact that he is picking my pocket, and I slap his hand away from the key.
After an uncertain start, the newly intimate aspect of our relationship had not, as I feared, damaged our friendship. In fact it seemed to me to be richer for it, knowing as I did a side to Holmes that had been closed to me before. Holmes himself still sometimes struggled with the vulnerability of our night-time activities for his own part, but he applied himself to my pleasure with the intense single minded dedication he brought to his work. I frequently felt like the focus of one of Holmes’ experiments, but the results were far from unpleasant. If I was to be Holmes’ subject for his explorations in intimacy for the rest of my life, then I would happily resign myself to my fate.
John is beginning to feel like this conversation is getting away from him. He says, ‘What if you were what?’
Sherlock’s expression doesn’t noticeably change but he says, ‘Good, John. Excellent.’ Like he’s approving of some clever deduction that John’s just made, and for a second John has to fight the ridiculous urge to laugh.
He was staring at me, and the colour had risen slightly in his cheeks. As I finished speaking he laughed, a little embarrassed, but also, I thought, quietly pleased.
‘I’m sorry.’ I said immediately. ‘I….you are quite right. An old friend from my army days.’ I avoided his gaze, afraid my face would betray my thoughts, my memories of James Paulson. Holmes could not know. ‘He is in newly arrived in London and looking up old acquaintances.’
I nod. ‘I promise. I promise.’ I try to rest my forehead against his, but he pulls away slightly to raise his hand to my face, lifting my chin to examine my pupils again.  His other hand is still clasped against my chest and I find I have no desire to let go.
John stares at the bedspread. It’s a rather hideous shade of pastel purple. With flowers. One of Mrs Hudson's. Even after all this time she still seems to view him as some lost waif who needs to be supplied with life’s essentials. He’d like to refuse more, but the happiness in her face when he accepts stops him doing so too often. This particular item is beyond the pale though, he thinks. Aloud he says, ‘I’m not gay. I’m - a bit bi.’
I held back a smile. Holmes’ last case had required extensive use, not only of the irregulars, whose attendance alone was usually enough to excite our usually imperturbable landlady, but of various boat builders and dock workers whose presence had eventually driven Mrs Hudson to complain loudly and at length to Holmes about the standing and reputation of this household in the eyes of the neighbours, and the difficulties of removing dockside mud from the carpets.
I met with James a number of times in the weeks that followed. To my great relief, he was as intelligent and personable a man as I remembered, and much pleased to have a friend in London with whom he could socialise. Our talk of Afghanistan was general, and brief, and conversation soon turned to mutual acquaintances. I was able to put him in touch with other colleagues now resident in the capital. He expressed his condolences at the death of my wife, and wonder at the return of Holmes. He apologised profusely for not getting in touch sooner, and explained he had been all over the world with his work in the intervening years and communication with home had been fraught with difficulty.
. I hoped the sound of pieces falling together in my brain wasn’t audible in the room. This was worse than I had feared. The poor girl was hoping to engage the services of Sherlock Holmes to find Escott the plumber, an alias of....Sherlock Holmes.
‘Miss Agatha Robson,’ Mrs Hudson announced reprovingly. Her name was vaguely familiar, but I couldn’t for the life of me remember where I’d heard it before.
He stared at me, mouth slightly agape and I realised I was seeing James Paulson speechless for the first and only time in my life. I sipped my brandy as I waited for him to recover.
He stared at me. ‘Eight days?’ I could see him calculating in his head. He reached his conclusion and looked at me in barely concealed panic. ‘Watson, I – ,’ he crossed the room to me, moved as if to embrace me then stopped, uncertain, almost stammering, ‘The case, you see, the case. I didn’t mean to – God, I have neglected you entirely.’ He was gazing anxiously at my face, trying to deduce my response. ‘John. Please forgive me.’
‘Watson! This is a wholly unexpected pleasure.’ He ushered me to a chair in front of the fire, into which I sank gratefully. ‘Can I tempt you?’ He gestured with his own half empty brandy glass.
But I was lost to reason. 'I grieved, Holmes. For years. For you. I was broken.' It was becoming harder to breathe. 'The world was so dark-' I broke off to inhale deeply, trying to gain some control. 'That you could do that to me again, make me believe, even for one night...' I gripped the back of one of the dining chairs and forced my lungs to take in air again. The silence in the room was suffocating.
In my accounting of the cases I shared with my friend, I have occasionally been inexact with dates. This is usually to ensure that no connection with events in the public eye at that time could be made and the anonymity of our clients invaded. In the case of Culverton Smith, however, the reason is simpler. It was only with the remove of time that I could bring myself to write of those events with any degree of equanimity.
Unwilling to upset him further, I murmured, ‘Of course.' I felt a cold hand run down my spine. But if this was to be the end of our friendship, I would face it with all the equanimity I had lacked the previous evening. I drew myself up, and waited.
Mrs Hudson drew herself up and said with icy distain, ‘That is a matter of opinion and I have my instructions.’
He spoke then, still without looking up. ‘No.’ I froze in the action of reaching for his arm. Quickly he reached out, caught my outstretched hand in both of his, and held it tightly. ‘There is nothing to forgive.’
I was finding it difficult to arrange my thoughts into any kind of coherency. My heart was beating too fast and the warmth of the room was making me feel faint.
I started. ‘You will not lose me.’ I drew back slightly. I said, ‘Look at me.’ He kept his head turned away. I said again, gently, ‘Holmes. Look at me.’ He raised his face to mine. He looked more lost and uncertain than I had ever seen him. I held his gaze, ‘You could never lose me. Please believe that.’
She sat up a little straighter. ‘Yes, sir. His name was John Escott, and he was a plumber by trade.’
Sherlock lifts his chin, says, ‘A fellow army man. Not a medic, a soldier. Assigned with you in Afghanistan. Died there. Important to you, since you have his dog tags.’ He stops, as if choosing his next words with care.
‘No,’ I said, not without a little sadness, ‘we couldn’t.’ His head turned to me. I reached up a hand and traced the outline of his angular face with my fingertips.
He said, wonderingly, ‘There was no thought, none. For that moment, there was just….sensation. It was….incredible.’ I smiled with relief, and ran tip of my finger across a line of moisture on his cheek, kissing the path it had taken. As his breath evened, I leaned to the floor to fetch my handkerchief and clean his chest, and as I moved back we both became aware of my hardness against his leg. I made to draw back and he caught me, holding me in place. He said, ‘May I?’
He stomped back into his room. ‘It’s not the start I’m concerned about, it’s the middle and the end. The man couldn’t play a decent cadenza....’ the rest of the statement was lost behind the closing door, and the slamming of what I hoped was a jar of pomade on the surface of his dressing table.
He stared at me intensely, eyes roving over my face. Then he said, ‘You were - intimate - with Dr Paulson.’ The change of topic threw me for a moment, and then I said. ‘Yes. Many years ago in Afghanistan.’
His breathing became laboured and I looked at him in concern. He had turned his face away from me. After a moment the dim light revealed glistening tracks on his cheek. I reached up and traced one wonderingly with my thumb. ‘Sherlock,’ I said, moved almost beyond endurance.
'I'm gratified by your respect for my medical skills. I'm only sorry it doesn't extend to a respect for my feelings. Or any consideration of them at all, in fact.'
‘An’ then that dreadful day, sir, when the house was broken into and poor Mr Milverton, ‘e was murdered, sir, right in ‘is own study, oh, it was terrible.’ She was twisting her skirt in her lap, the memory clearly painful, and I wondered with a stab of guilt if she had been the one to find the body.
She looked at me a little pityingly at that suggestion. ‘Oh, no, sir, that’s not right. He loved, sure as i’m sitting ‘ere, he did. But he loved someone else, someone as ‘e couldn’t ‘ave, an’ it made him so sad, sir.’ She bit her lip.
It feels like forever, and much too short a time, before they come apart. John is in need of oxygen, and stability, and breathes hard, as Sherlock rests his forehead against John’s, running his hands along the sides of John’s face, his neck, his shoulders, and back again, murmuring his name in way that makes John emotional for reasons he can’t quite define. He catches Sherlock’s hands, notices their slight tremble, says, ‘Hey. You okay?’
‘Thank you sir.’ She sniffed. ‘But the thing is sir, well, Mr Escott – John – I never saw ‘im again. Not after the master died. Which is what made me think he must ‘ave fallen in with a bad lot.’
‘Mrs Hudson?’ I queried. Our fine landlady tended to sweep magisterially into our rooms, not hover doubtfully in the doorway.
I frowned. ‘I’m fine.’ The weight of his hand on my arm. I felt a smaller hand in its place. Will she be alright, Doctor? A small trusting face gazing into mine. God, how they had cried, her children. The look of betrayal on the littlest girl’s face. There was nothing I could have done, I had wanted to say. Nothing. I took a breath. ‘I’m fine.’ I repeated quietly.
I had long schooled myself to keep the thought that my affection for Holmes could be more than profound friendship far from my mind. Holmes had made it clear, in many ways, that he had no interest in the softer emotions, and that a physical relationship with the fairer sex would be unwanted and unthinkable. I had always assumed that the same applied to relationships with his own sex. When I had wondered about it at all, I had supposed, given his stated feelings towards the fairer sex, that his affections would run towards his own gender. But since he appeared to have no feelings in that regard towards either sex, the thought had been irrelevant.
I should begin then with a little of my own history. As I have recorded, prior to my first meeting with Holmes, I was attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon, and sent to India. By the time I arrived, the second Afghanistan war had broken out, and I followed my regiment to Kandahar. This was my first experience of the horrors of war. I had thought my training as a doctor and surgeon had prepared me for anything that could be done by violence or disease to the human body. Now I can hardly credit my own naiveté. To learn, in such a visceral way, how much pain and trauma the body could take before breaking, and the meagre limits of my own skills to keep body and soul together, was horrifying.
, Watson. I needed information. How else could I have got it, in the time required?’ He turned on me. ‘And I don’t recall you being quite so squeamish at the time.’
.’ John reaches out and takes the tags from Sherlock’s hand, careful to avoid touching him in any way. He folds them tightly into his own hand so there is not even a telltale glimpse of silver. Sherlock stares at his closed fist like he can still see his name.
My release came on me quickly, and he was not far behind, rutting against my still sensitive organ until he came, stifling his cry against my chest. He cleaned us both, and held me until my shaking stopped and I slept.
‘Holmes,’ I kept my voice down, certain that there was at least one person in the house abed at this hour. ‘Couldn’t you sleep?’ I had left my coat and scarf in the hall, so the warmth of the banked fire was very welcome. I sank into my chair with relief.
James listened in sympathetic silence. I have no idea how long I spoke but he did not interrupt, and barely moved other than to drink. The words rushed out and I found myself recalling my experiences after Reichenbach, being more open with James than I had been with anyone since my wife. And there were confessions I could make to James that I could never have made to my beloved Mary.
He had come back too soon, and in such a mood. I had not planned what to say, and my vague sentences withered before his clear gaze.
‘Work what out, Miss Robson?’ The sooner I could get her to say it, the sooner I could refuse the case and return to the fire and my paper.
‘Goodnight, Mrs Hudson.' I looked after her retreating figure fondly, before mounting the stairs. The door to our sitting room was closed and I'm ashamed to admit I hesitated in front of it for some moments, before seizing the handle and entering the room, closing it again behind me.
On his slim form the space between his hips was almost concave. He held his breath as I caressed the area, moving closer to his stiffening member but not touching. I bent my head to his nipple, kissing and sucking, and he released a long, shuddering breath that was almost a moan.
James stood abruptly, walked back to the desk, poured himself another brandy and downed half of it, before saying, ‘Frankly, I doubt that’s true of anyone, deny it as they might.’ He sighed. ‘Just talk to him, John. I think you may find he is not as opposed to the softer emotions as he would have you believe. And even if he is, I believe you will find yourself the exception.’
Holmes nodded. ‘Good. I did advise Miss Robson away from Mr Stokes, although I could hardly hope she would heed my advice. Young women are exceptionally single minded in such matters. Anstruther is remarkably pig-headed and has an eye for the ladies, but I believe those to be the worst of his faults. Nothing Miss Robson won’t be able to manage.’
He is kneeling before me now, staring into my eyes, checking my pupils as he passes his hand over my forehead. His touch leaves sparks of sensation over my skin and I fight the sudden urge to laugh with glee. I move my head to follow his hand and he looks at me in alarm.
