“Dean,” Cas interrupted, even raising his voice. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. Why would I be mad at you?”
The length of her name also fit to what he remembered from that very first day, the little blurry smudge that had been there before only the C kept present on his arm.
Also, you don't need to tell me how cruel I am with this ending, one of my alphas already did 😂 ... though the other one thinks it's perfect 😂
. He could count three sheets instead of just one. Was she… was Gracie about to let him read one of her letters to her mother? But… why?
There was no thought about even trying to move this back to the bedroom, their clothes were gone within a few fleeting moments, their lips quickly sealing together. And for the next hour or so, neither of them was able to spare a thought of how cold it might actually be.
When he couldn’t help his wince, Dean quickly tried to cover it by clearing his throat. That question hit too close to home and he hoped his voice didn’t sound as pained as he believed it to be when he replied with a simple, “Pass.”
It took a moment before there was a reaction, Cas slowly lifting his head as he looked at Dean, confusion apparent on his features. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
Dean was still trying to find anything for sustenance when two strong arms wound around his middle, Cas resting his chin on his shoulder as if to inspect the fridge with him.
He did not meet Cas during his ride but that didn’t leave the same bitter taste in his mouth that it usually did.
On its own accord, Dean’s mouth found the soft flesh of Cas’ cock and he pressed a kiss there, getting an instant reaction as the length twitched against his lips. Above, Cas moaned again, his arm moving slightly. Keeping his eyes firmly on Cas’ face now, Dean kissed him again, before letting his tongue join his lips. When Cas’ moan turned deeper and more coherent, Dean pressed his tongue harder against the firmness, slowly dragging it over the soft flesh.
Part of him wanted to fall back on his old mechanism of denial, refusal, and excuses. But the bigger part…
For now, he pulled himself back together, leaning back and pulling Cas into his embrace again, just like they had sat before. Finally getting to the real question.
First of all, it was so satisfying to finally write all these little scenes that were only mentioned in Angel Cookies 😇
They talked for well over half an hour until Dean reminded his daughter that Sam would be picking her up soon. Without much fuss, Gracie got up and waved at her aunts. “
“Happy you had fun,” Dean replied, once again putting an arm around her shoulders and holding her close. “Where did you leave Cas?”
Gracie was hugging Cas’ side now, both of them turned back towards the bay and Dean didn’t hesitate any longer. He pressed closer to Cas as well and let his fingers brush against his right hand, tentatively, ready to pull back if Cas did. Maybe he wasn’t ready for Dean’s family to see just yet…
Dean sighed while he put away the Italian herbs, quickly getting back to the red sauce on the stove to stir it. “Yeah, it’s true. Looks like Lulu is sick.”
He had been a teacher for long enough to know that students get distracted sometimes and that sometimes it was best to let them get it out of their system a little. He would certainly not jump down their throats again like last week. After all, he was pretty sure his kids wouldn’t ignore it a second time and the last thing he needed was rumors around the school, spouting shit like, ‘
The thought came back to him later that night while he was staring at the shadowy pattern on the roof above his bed once more. It really had been a while. After Lisa’s death, there’d just never been an opportunity.
“Hey, man, look. Maybe I wasn’t your teacher for long, but it was certainly long enough to know you have a very distinctive style when you write. Your voice certainly has evolved from when you were a teen, but... it’s still there.”
Dean’s mind supplied an image of Cas’ handsome face, his smile, and all of a sudden, Dean was gasping, his orgasm hitting him without any warning.
This time, Dean shrugged his shoulders. “Don’t know. Maybe it’s because of that Cassie debacle but… I can’t help but feel like C is a guy.”
The image disappeared quickly enough, leaving him with mixed feelings. On the one hand, he felt content and happy. On the other, there was a sad feeling inside of him. He was longing for something that might not be within his reach anymore…
“Besides… I’m not only worried for his well-being, you know that. Cas almost didn’t come back home for Christmas - if it weren’t for our father’s grave situation, I’m sure he wouldn’t have. He’ll be gone again after New Year’s and I’m certain the only time Stars Hollow will see him again after that is at our father’s funeral.”
The messages on his arm stopped right after Pride this year and Dean couldn’t help but wonder if it was because he had finally met his soulmate in person. Cassie was… well, she was
“If that were true… what kind of person would that make me?” he finally murmured, admitting to his brother and sister-in-law what he could hardly admit to himself.
“Oh– my god!” Charlie breathed out, Jo only nodding as if in agreement until Charlie turned to her. “Did he just say…?!”
He was sure he wanted to apologize and the more he thought about it, the more he realized he also wanted to know about Cas’ life. He’d wondered about it in the past and he would love to … to have his friend back?
Before Dean could stop her, already suspecting what was coming, Cas encouraged her to go on, giving her his undivided attention.
Looking up, he looked at Andrew and Krissy, the only two of the group currently not busy with collecting money or tending otherwise to customers.
Back at his desk, Dean picked up Max’ cellphone and easily tossed it over, Max catching without a problem. His whole class was staring at their teacher, no one even daring to breathe a word.
Dean stopped in his motions, pen resting a few breaths above his skin. Why was C screaming like that?
“Not really, no,” Cas replied, snuggling into Dean’s chest the moment he turned around. “Keeps you busy for too long and that is just wasted time.”
the right choice of words. Reaching for Cas, Dean right away tried to soothe him. “Okay. Okay, hey, calm down,” he said – but then Cas pushed away his outstretched hands and there was something so clumsy, so uncoordinated about that move, it finally clicked. “Cas, are you drunk?”
. And if this means taking this second chance that’s been given to you… we’re sure she would’ve wanted you to take it.”
Smiling, Dean positioned the pen again and without overthinking, he let his heart speak as he wrote his words to Cas.
Brushing both hands over his face, Dean decided – once again – that this wasn’t helpful. He could try to analyze Cas’ words and actions all he wanted but he would never know the full truth until he actually
This time, Dean had to forcibly bite back any reaction at all. Did Grace… did she really just do what Dean thought she had done? Was she trying to sell Cas as something
“You mean if she knew that she almost wouldn’t exist because Castiel tried to stop her parents’ wedding? I don’t think so –”
“– to do the right thing,” Dean finished the sentence with a little huff of laughter. It felt so liberating and once more, he pulled her in, this hug much more like one of his typical bear hugs for his kid. He had no idea how she had done it, but his heart already felt so much lighter.
Cas deserved for Dean to finally go after him, his own pride and feelings be damned. Cas deserved it – even if it was too little, too late.
But the point was… Dean might not like it, but Cas had gotten himself a good man with this one. He would not jeopardize that even further than he already had.
Looking back to their table, Dean’s heart squeezed painfully as he saw his daughter in tears. Not hesitating another moment, he rushed forward, putting the mugs on the table somewhere along the way. Gracie was in his arms in a heartbeat, shaking like a leaf. “Dad, what’s happening?”
“We have all the time in the world,” Cas promised in his sure voice. “We’ll go one step at a time, okay?”
So Dean used the fortune and went on. He might not ever get the chance again, which was why he had to come clean now - no time like the present, after all.
Dean smiled and then quickly stepped next to the man, turning so he was looking in the same direction. “You’re on the right path. Just follow this route.” He pointed out where to turn left and right and made sure the guy had it memorized, before finally quenching his curiosity. “What’re you so nervous about?”
No one answered; everybody knew him well enough. Knowing that a) he still loved them all and b) they had already won when he got to the point of complaining about them.
Could there have been a more terrible line? After all, Cas hadn’t been running away from him. Not outright, at least. And after Friday…
“For real now?” Dean was the one to interrupt this time. “You really think I need your list again? Of people whose soulmates died and they’re now happy with someone else? Or the people who met their soulmate but had no sexual interest in but realized they’re best friends for life? Because I don’t need that list.
Family time in the Winchester household, Charlie and Jo's weekly call - this time from Paris - and a very intense talk between Gracie and Dean... MERRY CHRISTMAS
“It’s not that!” Cas exclaimed, causing Dean to almost lose it as he held himself back from physically
“Oh, I agree,” Alice said, looking at her husband rather than Dean. “You remember last spring when she visited and we would take her to Lisa’s favorite park? Oh, Dean,” she added, including him again in the conversation. “She was excited, for sure. But… it was like there was a constant shadow there. Something holding her back. I don’t see that now.”
“And... and... I don’t know,” Cas concluded with a huff, still clearly annoyed - probably at his inability to form words right now. Instead of trying again, he grabbed the cookie box again.
“Well, look at that,” he heard Gabe say. “I think someone just took over the spot of ‘favorite uncle’.”
A warm sensation spread around Dean’s heart, making it feel so much lighter. It wasn’t just seeing Gracie being so happy, smiling while Cas opened her present or Cas smiling back at her once he had seen the medallion she had picked for him. Engraved with Francis de Sales, patron of writers. It wasn’t only the fact that, without hesitation, Cas put it around his neck as if it was the most precious gift he’d ever received before he pulled Gracie back in for another hug.
take away his appetite. No way. Shoving a way too full fork into his mouth, he munched on it, finally swallowing it down.
His opinion on oversharing personal matters with one’s students still stood and he certainly didn’t want them to continuously pry into his private life. However, he was not as blindsided by it all as he had been last week. Steeling himself - there was still parts of his heart he was sure he needed to guard, especially with these clever little fiends - he turned around from where he had been writing at the board and loosely chucked the cap of his marker in Claire’s direction, where she was giggling with Ava.
Looking up, Dean was glad to see a badly concealed grin on her lips. At that very moment, it was as if Lisa was sitting right there, teasing him about something he was passionate about - a teasing that was always so full of love, Dean stood no chance at being mad at her. The same spark was in Alice’s eyes now, instantly telling Dean that she was not mad at him - just curious about the situation, and absolutely amused.
“Fuck,” Cas repeated and Dean was sure the man did not catch the slight hitch in Dean’s voice, too preoccupied with what he had just told him.
The grin that spread all over Cas’ face was in equal parts bashful and so, so adorable and Dean could’ve spent hours upon hours just watching him. But when the man leaned against him, snuggling further into his warmth, Dean realized for the first time how inappropriately Cas was dressed for weather like this. The snow had picked up again and it looked like he was wearing nothing more than a thin shirt and some sweatpants underneath his coat.
Dean held his breath whenever it was Grace's turn to dance, trying to take all her stress away from her and suffering himself vicariously. Knowing the routine and mostly his daughter so well, of course he could see all the little bits where she didn’t yet feel safe enough, where she was a bit more clumsy than she would have been before this summer.
, Dean wanted to scream. But his vocal cords were still all jammed up. When Cas went on, Dean was sure he could see a tear make its way down his cheek.
Turning the car around, he stopped shortly to send a text to Sam, telling him he’d be there soon, then he made his way back home; relieved to see that he had gone somewhat in a wide circle and wasn’t too far from the ranch.
What a good thing to have friends to talk to in your life - what a bad thing to have gossiping people in your life as well.
“Ah,” Dean replied, chuckling. “Three questions in one? Well played, Max. But the short answer is: no. Nothing of that bothered me. I had been friends with him for over a decade by then, so I never really saw him as my student. And you should know me well enough by now to know that I’m not a homophobic person. Love is love. If anyone tries to tell you differently, well… don’t listen to them.”
came into sight, Dean strode along the sidewalk, eager to be spending time with Gracie and Cas. He chuckled to himself as some of the moments of the past two days came to mind. Really, if circumstances were different, people might believe them to be a happy little family sitting together at the café every day. Maybe, one day…
It was the one thing he didn’t like about this whole soulmate thing – the fact that there was no real way for him to keep all the words ever written between them. But he wanted to. He wanted to remember so much about what they had exchanged, wanted to be able to look back at these words in fifty years and know it happened.
of being into Cas - only to have Cas hurt by terrible gossip. Then Sunday, he had finally gotten rid of the annoying
“Hello, Dean. I hear Gracie was successful?” she said with a gentle smile, rising up from the couch.
for over a week now, constantly pulling and pushing in every direction. The only constant in this whole damn thing was Cas.
“That wasn’t the question,” he scolded, only pecking Cas’ mouth once more before moving his lips to Cas’ ear. “I asked what you
Should he ride to the mansion and check on Cas? Should he take the same way back? Make sure Cas wasn’t lying in the ditch somewhere?
. The other guy I was talking about. The one that I’ve admired from afar. That I’ve been crushing over for the past few months. That’s
“You’re not old, Dad,” Gracie told him with a smile that turned into giggles as Dean ruffled her hair while he passed her.
If he had thought it was a good idea to say that, Cas’ aunt showed him better. Amara turned around and pinned Dean with a stare that made him swallow. “So?”
That evening, they got a surprise visit from Luke. It wasn’t an unusual occurrence for him to stop by but it was Christmas and Dean couldn’t think of a good reason why the man would want to spend it with them. Dean was also not in the mood to entertain any guests, friends or not.
He still wasn’t sure about it now but there was something to be said about early mornings when reality wasn’t fully awake and a sleepy mind was too tired to overanalyze everything.
Swallowing, Ava nodded, quickly pulling her hand back once he’d let go, the letter inside her jeans’ pocket within a nanosecond.
They had ended up arriving too early after all as the plane had been delayed by a little turbulent weather mid-flight. While they waited, Gracie had talked Dean into a quick trip to a shopping mall in Hartford to buy Christmas presents for Cas. Dean had easily agreed and they turned away from the airport to do some last-minute shopping. It had taken her a long time once they got there, to pick a gift for Cas. She had put a lot of thought into it - as she had with all her gifts. It warmed Dean’s heart to know that he had such a thoughtful and caring daughter.
“Ohhh, and I made a new friend. His name is Cas and he’s Uncle Chuck’s youngest son and lives in New York but he’s home for the holidays and we meet at
All he cared about right now was the feel of Cas’ hand in his, and ensuring that the muffled laughter he could hear from right behind him continued.
“Let’s just say that everybody in this room is family to me and I am grateful you all found it in you to accept my invitation. I know we still have a whole week of December left, but I already want to tell you that it has been one of the greatest times. Having my sister and all my children back home –” Dean could see how Chuck’s eyes wandered around the room, probably gazing at each of his seven children. It seemed his gaze lingered on one of them particularly long but from where Dean stood, he couldn’t see who it was. His money was on Cas though; he
offering him the cookie would mean he would shake it off quickly. If only to humor her. Maybe rip Dean a new one later on, if he
Banning any thoughts of how Dean would love seeing Gracie be that close with a potential future step-parent, he watched Alice finally disentangle herself from Gracie’s tight hug. She turned to smile at him and stepped forward into Dean’s waiting arms to greet him as well.
“And that’s true,” Dean admitted, feeling a bit of embarrassment bubble up inside of him. He pushed it down though. This was Cas, after all. He wouldn’t laugh. “All I know is that I want to be with you and that I’m open to... I don’t know, experimenting in bed, I guess?”
from him - there was something seriously wrong with their relationship and Dean would feel like he had failed as a father.
Letting Sam and Inias be the responsible adults to watch over Gabe and the older kids and the fireworks, Dean stood back, blanket around his shoulders as he held Cas tight to his chest, cocooning him into his warmth.
The smile on Cas’ lips spread wider still. “Good morning. Hope you don’t mind that we let you sleep in. You looked so peaceful.” That soft smile turned a tad wicked and there was a glint in Cas’ eyes that was all too easy to read for Dean. “And maybe a little bit like you needed it.”
Dean could hardly sign quick enough to show how enraged he was. Why on earth? He had confided in his best friends, had trusted them –
The guy Dean was ninety-nine percent sure was Cas’ boyfriend currently stood practically naked right in front of him.
All Cas pressed out was a rushed, “Healing,” then he was kissing Dean again, a fervor burning between them as he pushed away from the door and began backing Dean towards the bed.
Cas stepped into the free space between them, and while he handed Dean his phone, Eileen rubbed Cas’ back in a soothing motion, very clearly relieved as well that he was safe and sound.
Cas still looked somewhere between asleep and awake – or just utterly blissed out – as his lips pulled into the widest smile Dean had ever seen and his lean body stretched like a cat. Once he was done, his eyes focused back on Dean.
Squeezing her tight one last time, Dean ended their cuddling with a kiss to the crown of her head, and then finally moved to get out of his bed.
His boyfriend – and yeah, even four days later, Dean’s heart still jumped simply by thinking of Cas as his boyfriend – was standing at the stove, his attire similar to Dean’s, even wearing one of Dean’s old and faded shirts, making sure the bacon didn’t burn as it sizzled nicely.
It was probably the lack of caffeine in his system but it could have also just been the early morning hour, but Dean needed a moment to grasp the meaning behind Cas’ words. When it hit him, he pressed a kiss to the man’s head as best as he could. “I love how considerate that is of you. But I promise, I wouldn’t ever mind you waking me up in any way you think we both might enjoy.” When Cas moved to look up at him, Dean caught his lips in a sweet kiss, before adding, “You have my full consent for that.”
Sadly, he was proven correct just a moment later. Dean barely poked his shoulder and Cas let out a strangled yelp that ended in a loud curse.
Dean was glad for the little talk they had had but he wasn’t naive enough to believe it had healed Gracie’s aching heart.
“Yeah, well, guess what? So am I. And I’ve also got someone else’s feelings to think about. So excuse me if I just want to leave all of this behind me.”
these feelings, given that they had never met? Sure, they were soulmates, so falling for the other one was the ideal outcome. But Dean had never thought it could happen by simply exchanging words. He certainly had never fallen for one of his friends from just messaging back and forth.
Ever since last year when they promised to stay faithful to each other, their conversations had become even more than they had been before. Dean would almost call it more private, more intimate; but that would mean the years before hadn’t been exactly that. And they had, at least in his mind.
He was thinking about Cas so much that, when he looked up to see a figure entering the bookstore theater, he was sure it was merely a case of wishful thinking. Or maybe he had summoned the man himself, he thought as he blinked. Because slipping into the doors was none other than the man of his most recent dreams, there was no doubt. Dean would recognize that posture, that figure, anywhere.
He also knew she would ask one more thing and Dean had made his decision on this long ago. Of course he would let Gracie name her foal. Seeing his daughter so full of happiness, eyes barely able to stay open, but never leaving the sandy colored filly with the white blaze and almost rusty mane… it simply made Dean happy.
Time for the opening of the Stars Hollow Winter Fair - and a certain first meeting after thirteen years ...
All the time, Dean’s mind was racing. There were so many questions in his head but he had a hard time concentrating on even one.
“Yes and, uh…” Dean swallowed for a second, feeling the heat creep up his neck at that question. Jesus, it had been too long since a reply to his daughter’s innocent question would be anything
The bathroom door down the hallway opened, making Dean stop himself and wait. A second later, another door fell shut, telling him that Gracie was back in her room. Still, he needed to keep this conversation down a notch. The last thing he wanted was for his daughter to know that something had almost prevented her parents’ wedding.
He might not have lost him today, but Dean knew that in just three weeks, Cas would be gone again. Would leave for his life back in New York. The thought made him want to scream, tearing at his heart.
Chuckling, he continued. “Hey, I just mean: if there’s something you would rather talk to Eileen about, or to Jo and Charlie, or even Sammy or Michael… yeah, of course I’m okay with that.”
“I,” Dean began, huffing out a little laugh. He really needed to find the right words, and fast. He let one of his fingers trace a random pattern on the box on the top before he looked back at Cas.
And now, the moment was finally here. And by the way it sounded, his soulmate had been waiting for him, probably writing the same message over and over on their skin, every year on their shared birthday, waiting for Dean to be of age as well; hoping again and again, only to go without a reply.
Dean wanted to roll his eyes because that was so typical for Michael. It made him the madly good lawyer he was and a friend you could tell every damn secret. Sometimes though, Dean really wanted to strangle him for this tendency.
Quite on the contrary. The moment Dean’s back hit his door, Cas was on him, crowding him against the wooden surface, leaving hot kisses all along his jaw and down his neck. The sensation washed over Dean and he gave in, moaning with every touch of those lips.
That was, until Cas stopped in his tracks and looked up. The moonlight caught his face and the sight that greeted Dean made him stop in his tracks, a bare few yards away from him. “You?” he breathed out, the butterflies inside of him soaring.
But he also knew he would never forget the heartbreak in Cas’ eyes. In his voice, his demeanor. He hadn’t said it, but Dean was able to read between the lines. Was able to understand that it also meant that he
“It’s actually a whole little carnival, right here in town,” Charlie interrupted, finally able to break free from Jo’s hold. Jo let her be though since Charlie had visibly calmed down. Enough that no one had to sign for Eileen.
Cas leaned further into Dean’s embrace again, sighing in content as he was seemingly contemplating something. “What about the stakes?” he finally asked. “Becky is right; we never talked about what they would be.”
To his chagrin, Lydia and Emma joined them, but with no desire for any more small talk, Dean made sure they quickly left them as soon as they reached the car. He was certainly in too good a mood to have it now ruined by a woman who was very clearly unable to read quite obvious signs of rejection.
Cas’ eyes went wide and his mouth fell open, but no words came out. He was simply gaping up at him. Taking this as his chance, Dean hastened to explain himself – before Cas would be able to catch up and maybe stop him, telling him that it was too late.
After a few moments of silence, Dean leaned forward and reached for the remote, unmuting the TV. The movie had ended somewhere in the middle of their talk, a new one already playing. Since it was another well-known classic it didn’t take them long to immerse themselves back into the wonderful world that was old Christmas movies.
It was still dark outside and probably way too early, but the dawning light that filtered through the window was enough to see all of Cas; enough to see the way he raised one eyebrow –  he was damn good at that, and it looked so sexy – before he snorted a laugh and practically fell against Dean’s side, snuggling into it as he also turned on his back, his head resting on Dean’s upper arm. “Next time, then,” he promised. “I wouldn’t just do that without your consent.”
It made him feel antsy and out of sorts. Dean Winchester was simply not made for not looking ahead. He was a person that loved structure and being in control – always had to be with a younger brother he’d raised and now taking care of his daughter; not to forget the classrooms of pubescent maniacs. One couldn’t survive in there without a clear plan; without knowing what all could go wrong and be prepared for it anyway.
A sudden idea struck Dean, making him sit up straight. If his earlier assumption was correct – if this confusion, all these weird feelings, if they were only because he wanted to be close to Cas as his friend … well maybe he should fight a bit harder to make that happen. And while he was at it, maybe he could check out how he would react to being close to the man. Show his body and his brain that it had just been temporary confusion.
Nevertheless, there was no way for him to deny her. Not only did he refuse to ignore his daughter, her well-being was the
And when Cas wound his left arm around Gracie’s shoulder, carefully resting his cast there, and whispered back, “I know. I’m sorry. It’s alright now,” Dean knew that it was.
“Alright, little missy. No more sugary cookies for you before bedtime. Ever,” he told her with a loving smile, tucking her in.
Dean certainly wasn’t gleeful when his friends got high points, but not high enough to beat Gracie and Cas. Nope, certainly not the reason he was smiling for the rest of the way around the square.
Stepping out the backdoor, Dean wasn't surprised to find Cas writing in a notepad, papers scattered around him. Gracie had told him that Cas was apparently an editor - but that did not waver his own suspicion in the slightest. The more he found him with all those notes and papers, the more Dean’s suspicion was confirmed.
somewhat different. Even though this was a small area; even though he could see at least fifty familiar faces in one quick sweep who would rush to her aid; even though they were most likely close enough for Dean to keep an eye on her himself if he felt like he needed to.
“Thanks,” he whispered, still deep in thoughts. So deep, in fact, he couldn’t even remember saying goodbye to the girls. He would just text them later.
. He couldn’t just say things like this. Not with such a soft voice, not with so much warmth. God, Dean didn’t know anymore where to put his feelings. Although, there was one other thing he had also been very good at doing.
Harry absentmindedly nodded in agreement while he added, “You’re right. I haven’t seen her this chipper since… well, I want to say, since her accident. But we do not see her that often, so it might have been even before then.”
It was actually Dean that caught the time, making the rest of the judges aware that they should be going. He might have been able to get a minute alone with Eileen while they were walking around the square, inspecting every snowman closely. But the chance of someone catching their hand movements was too high for Dean to be comfortable with.
Dean’s irritation was quickly laced with some frustration and anger as he picked up speed once he was clear of the crowds.
Cas didn’t say anything to that admission, neither in denial nor confirmation. He didn’t need to because they both knew it was true.
- he turned to Cas to explain what they were talking about. “My senior class is planning a trip right before spring break. To get some money, I convinced the principal and Taylor Doose to let the kids set up a table at the Fair, selling Christmas cookies.”
Well, it seemed the only good thing about Cas being taken - or at least not interested in Dean any longer - was that Dean could put a hold on actually confronting his feelings for real. He had acknowledged them, had accepted them. But as long as there was never any hope that this would lead anywhere, he wouldn’t have to confront them any further than that. Wouldn’t have to examine them. Wouldn’t have to think about what they really meant - for him
best.” There, he had said it. And the spark in Cas’ eyes was certainly worth telling part of the truth. But it was also dangerous, so Dean quickly continued. “But compared to, let’s say, Tolkien? Well, you see the difference.”
“Cas?” he asked, never stopping the soft strokes of his fingers over Cas’ back. Chasing some of the snowflakes that had begun to softly fall sometime during their morning sex.
Hey, just because Christmas was over didn’t mean they weren’t allowed to enjoy their favorite sweets, right?
It got him an eye roll from Cas but also a big grin and Dean could tell it amused him. He let his gaze follow the man as he walked over to the oven, getting out the pizzas and putting them both on the plates sitting on the bar counter.
“Hey, Mom,” Gracie whispered as they reached Lisa’s grave, only partially covered in snow since most of it was protected by the branches of a nearby tree.
Because I don't want you to wonder why this chapter is twice as long as its companion in AC. Why there is so much more detail, so much more insight into the character's mind.
“Yes, I do,” Dean stated, leaving no room for argument. Cas had a right to hear this and Dean really hoped that their relationship would be built on trust and understanding from now on. So he was certainly not going to keep this from him. Though that didn’t mean all the right words would magically appear. “Just... be patient with me, please,” he asked.
“Now look at you, looking awesome like that. You should travel more often, it’s doing you some good.”
. Dean skipped his morning ride, having absolutely no desire to be reminded of yesterday’s events - but forgoing the routine that usually cleared his mind, the swirl of emotions inside of him was difficult to ignore and he found it hard to focus. At least it was close enough to the end of the year now that he could get away with letting his students write Christmas poems or interpret Christmas carols instead of going over the actual material. More than likely, it even gave him a few cool-points with his students - who certainly voiced no complaints.
To touch Cas was… indescribable. Dean had imagined it so many times but reality was better than anything he could have possibly dreamed up.
That voice … that voice had definitely changed. It was rough and dark, so totally fitting to this new person standing right in front of him.
He had to take a shaky breath through his mouth, his nose slowly clogging up – and still, he refused to acknowledge the tears in his eyes.
“Well, that was last night,” Cas mumbled as he took Dean’s free hand and began to play with his fingers. “There might be other situations when you aren’t as comfortable with it.”
Sorting his limbs, Dean got out of the blankets and leaned back against the side of his bed, breathing heavily.
“I just can’t eat these damn things without seeing you, standing in that church and… and pitying me.”
Nodding, he took the few steps to their table. “Yeah, well. It’s the weekend, I just wanted to get out of school. Paperwork will still be there on Monday.”
“Maybe it won’t be the best for you to meet him with everybody around. Go to him now. I know you want to talk to him without getting interrupted.”
. The feeling had been good before. Now though… now it had Dean breathless, a moan tumbling from his lips. He vaguely registered that his eyes had fallen shut and his fingers dug into Cas’ waist, desperate for something to hold onto. But all he could really focus on was the warmth pressed against his dick; the feel of it when his hips bucked, seeking more friction; the feeling of another thick cock pressed against his, even with a thin barrier left between them.
Either Sam had no real comeback or he was just so over the topic he simply wanted it to end. He said nothing and just turned back to the soda machine to fix it up.
Dean nodded, unable to fathom what all he had just told them. It was all true, of course. But it had also been buried so deep inside of him, he felt left open and raw now that he had laid it all out.
For Dean, the short moment of comfort from bantering with his oldest friend didn’t last long and he could tell that Michael didn’t fare any better.
The night was clear and dark and perfectly crisp – but no one at the Shurley household noticed the cold. While the younger kids were already asleep, the adults had all come together on the back porch. Full and content after a delectable family dinner, they sat and waited for the clock to tick down to midnight. Easy conversations were flowing amongst them, a calm familiarity and warmth surrounding them. Most couples sat huddled close enough to share a blanket while the fire bowls all around the porch made the whole space rather cozy.
Then it finally was time for the winners to be announced. “This year’s first place won with a huge advance over the second place.” Dean suppressed the eye roll. Yeah, so they had a little bit more points than the second place, but did Taylor really have to overdo it that much? “The prize is a $100 gift certificate for
With one last wink and a cheerful ‘Happy New Year,’ Dean pulled Gracie along, leaving two stunned and gaping women behind as they moved on in their quest to find Cas.
“That’s good,” Alice said, getting Dean’s attention. “I don’t remember much about him, but he seemed like a…
“I guess… if the situation arises? I promise I’ll try – but I won’t go through with it if I notice he’s feeling uncomfortable about it, alright?”
No matter how hard Dean tried to tame the happy hopeful thoughts - they wouldn’t go away. Sighing in defeat and smiling about himself -
And it would stay that way until the first time they touched. The first time their skin connected, the universe (and their molecules) would know they met and all limitations were now null and void.
He had never seen Michael as furious as he had been with Dean. Had never seen Gabriel as serious as in that moment, nor sweet Hannah so livid.
Dean knew that the Shurleys were rather well off. He had also suspected that Cas must be on the richer side, given his fame as an author and the family money. The suspicion was somewhat confirmed when he had given the cab driver the address. The way the guy whistled told him they were off to a fancy part of the city.
Small steps. He wanted to take small steps and he knew that for that there needed to be said some things. They had taken a huge leap this morning, clearing some of their miscommunication - but it was still a long way.
– would hit him as hard or as deep as Cas’ look of utter betrayal had. Nothing would cut so deep as watching him flee.
Dean tried not to be distracted too much by what had happened this morning. Especially not when he met Gracie and Cas later on, joining them once more. Instead, he enjoyed their exchange and the talk about Cas’ book. While they did so, Dean was amazed by how his daughter made sure not to let it slip that she knew about Cas’ secret identity.
“Look, Cas,” he said, barely containing his mood. “This can go exactly two ways: one, you put your damn leg over the horse so I can take you back. Two, I’ll carry you the whole damn way. And don’t think I won’t. I have a kid, I know how to handle stubborn people.” When Cas hesitated, Dean merely added: “Up to you, buddy.”
Instead of a straightforward answer, kisses were peppered all over his shoulder, then his collarbone and up his neck, over his chin until Cas finally reached his mouth, finishing his journey with one longing kiss. When Cas pulled back, Dean was greeted by the widest and most sappiest grin he had ever seen.
there was also the fact that there was still some kind of wall between Cas and him. Apparently, Cas did not hate him… but still, he was keeping Dean at arm’s length. So much so that Dean had to talk him into letting him help! That was
he would go down this road, really go down that path, he would have to admit so many things to himself he simply could
.” The silly thought made him smile even more. Obviously, his mind was still half asleep – otherwise, something so ridiculous would probably never cross it.
Always a welcome part of it all – and still, there had always been that tiny fragment of his mind that felt separate. Now though, for the first time, he finally, and truly,
Moving his head with the last strength he had, Dean pressed a kiss into that unruly hair and then simply lay there, bathing in the afterglow, too drained and – quite frankly – too tired to analyze just how amazing this had been and how exactly he felt after his first time with a man.
have that talk with Michael after all – it might give him a little bit of insight into his own feelings.
When the girls calmed down right away, he quickly realized they’d just been hyped and overexcited. Still, he put on his teacher-voice. “Alright, sorry. Just make sure to calm down a bit, okay? Don’t want to see you two getting hurt.” Yeah, no matter what, he would always be concerned for his students’ well-being.
By her surprised expression, he could tell this had certainly not been the answer she had expected. Which was probably partly his fault. Not that he had ever encouraged her - but he had also never told her ‘No’ in an outright and straightforward manner.
Even though - he still noted with some kind of satisfaction that none of that seemed necessary. Because he trusted Cas.
How could he not? Cas only wore some thin winter sports clothes, no thick jacket or anything. It might be enough when moving and sweating but it certainly wasn’t enough like this. Leaning back, Dean momentarily let go of the reins to zip open his own warm jacket. Stealing himself for the contact - and the emotions this might unleash - Dean pushed it all aside. Concentrating on Cas’ need not to freeze to death.
“Okay? Jesus, Dean,” he said, lightly nipping on Dean’s lower lip. “You just made one of my top five wet dreams come true. It was a bit more than just ‘okay.’”
When their lips touched, it was everything Dean had ever dreamed of. He hadn’t believed in all those movie cliches and TV tropes but it really felt like fireworks were exploding, like the earth broke open and the axes aligned anew. Nothing around them mattered anymore, the closeness of the man now in his arms was the only thing that counted.
“What are you laughing about?” he asked, his voice rough even to his own ears and full of the amusement he was unable to hide.
“Oh, Cas,” he finally breathed out, finding those blue eyes back on him as he leaned down to press a gentle kiss to Cas’ lips. “I’m so sorry. That was probably the worst misunderstanding ever between us.”
Just like that, it seemed his daughter had all but forgotten about their conversation in light of checking on the mare that carried her Christmas present.
“Eileen,” he exclaimed, completely forgetting not to draw attention to them. Too late now, as the other judges turned their way. Thankfully, Eileen must have caught the movement as she was looking up as well.
Dean waited with bated breath, his head spinning as his world seemed to zero in on his arm and the words appearing there.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean replied tentatively, not willing to let go of him just yet, even as Cas had clearly found his footing again.
Cas’ head snapped up right away and funny enough, his hand seemed to jerk in the direction of the laptop’s lid before he stopped himself. What? Was there something he didn’t want Dean to see?
had certainly been an understatement. His foul mood had quickly led to a headache, the constant noise of those pubescent maniacs he had to call his students not making it any better. Neither did their behavior that day. When Andrew didn’t pay attention and doodled in his book rather than answer the question, Dean asked him if he’d prefer answering that question and twenty more at home. When Max played with his phone, Dean simply took it away from him and put it on his own desk – they all knew the rules so when Max complained, Dean sent him a sharp glare. When Scott gave a stupid answer just to be funny, Dean told him that he wasn’t funny at all, nipping the jokes and laughter right in the butt.
“But... I believed in this legend,” Cas still went on, quite obviously not giving a flying fuck anymore about laying his heart bare. “God, did I believe in it. Because it worked for everyone else in my family – my grandparents, my parents, my aunt, my siblings, even my damn cousins –
“Dean, honey,” Alice interrupted his rambling and thank God for that. Who knew what he would have said if he had been allowed to keep going. “That’s not what we’re asking.”
“Ohhh, you ‘made up’?” Charlie repeated with clear innuendo in her voice, getting an elbow in her side from Jo – who was doing a terrible job trying to mask her own grin.
Gracie loved pulling Alice and Harry around the booths, enjoying the little trinkets and gifts they were offering. They had just left the corner of the markets that was as full of food and drinks as it was people, bellies stuffed and thirsts sated, and they continued wandering along the grounds. Dean mostly watched the people who were busy enjoying their Christmas time with loved ones - just like he himself.
Dean swallowed, thinking about it before he wrote more. There was a Pride parade in almost every bigger city all over the country. Hell, Charlie had bucked him for years now to join her in going to the one in Lincoln. All those parades were set at different dates, sure, but there were still too many to really make anything of this information, time- or location-wise.
And speaking of schoolboys… he wasn’t quick enough to steer clear of the group of students that seemed to materialize out of thin air – though, by the looks of it, they had occupied that space for quite a while, their table littered with sweets and soft drinks.
“So should I,” the guy replied, his voice shooting right through Dean. It was dark and rough and Dean really tried to convince himself that the shiver running down his spine only had to do with the cold November air and nothing with the stranger standing in front of him.
Rather, he moved back to Cas’ chest, his kissing-trail soon led him to those perky nipples. He wanted to hear that sinful moan again, so with that thought in mind, he closed his lips around one and sucked, again and again. The noises he elicited from Cas were downright filthy and by now, Dean was so hard the restriction of his jeans became uncomfortable.
Dean knew he was gaping but he couldn’t stop himself. Couldn’t even bring himself to look back down at the papers in his hands. Gracie was quick to keep talking.
Joshua ended the call and Dean had to swallow to press down his nerves and the weird little flip flop his stomach had begun once Joshua started speaking into the phone. Cas was letting him come up. He was willing to see him and from how it had sounded, he hadn’t even hesitated long.
Their gazes locked and they both seemed to search for something – or were simply taking in the other. It was Dean who spoke again first. “I can’t believe it’s you.”
Dean jerked awake so forcefully he got caught up in the sheets, actual falling out of bed and hitting his knee pretty badly.
had a large collection of sex toys, the big drawer nearly overflowing, and despite how experienced Dean was when it came to sex, there were some things in there even he had no idea what they were for. Well then. This would definitely be fun.
Dean kept reminding himself that it was only for a few hours (and one terribly lonely night) and that he would see Cas again soon. But that didn’t make it any easier watching him get into his car and drive away. Hugging his daughter close – whether more for her comfort or his own, it wasn’t quite clear – he steered them back towards the house once they couldn’t see his car anymore.
There was just something about seeing the easy joy on Cas’ face, so carefree, so happy, no trace of hurt or discomfort or even just indifference. And to know that finally,
Dean’s eyes snapped back at her and he caught a satisfied smirk on her lips before he extricated himself from her touch and she quickly schooled her features. But it was enough for him to piece together what had just gone down. Especially when he could make out the laughter from the other side of the street, recognizing some of Cas’ old tormentors.
For a moment, nobody said anything, Jo just looking intently at Charlie, before smirking at last and asking: “What, a whole sentence without a Portuguese word?”
If he didn’t know better, Dean would say Cas was afraid they would hand him a poisonous apple - surely he trusted them more than
The sudden quiet was deafening, but the ten extra minutes were enough for Dean to get it back together. When his next class entered the room, he was ready, all thoughts of Cas shoved deep down, never to interfere again with him being the best version of a teacher he could possibly be.
And then Cas began to move his hips in slow circles and Dean was lost. God, he was so lost in this, he felt like he was drowning with Cas as his only anchor. Soft lips were all over him, pressing hot kisses along his collarbone, his neck, up to his ear. Dean had never known himself to be very vocal in bed but Cas was simply driving him to new heights. He barely even noticed the nibbling on his earlobe, too many sensations threatening to overwhelm him.
And as they sank back into the kiss, they both knew that this was only the beginning of something wonderful.
“Exactly,” Dean said, ignoring Alice's obvious inflection, as he hurried across the street, careful not to slip on the ice still hidden by snow. “I’m almost there as well. You two have a lovely start and don’t forget to call us from time to time.”
Not to be outdone, Miss Patty chortled in joy, “About time, young man! Tell us, who’s the lucky lady?”
About half an hour later, Dean finally got dressed for real and made his way to the stables. Ignoring the little voice in his head that was mocking him for waiting so long with his ride just for one reason, Dean got Cherry ready and soon, he was on his way.
Brushing a stray strand of hair out of her face, Dean hugged his daughter close. “We still have a little over a week with him, Gracie. How about we enjoy that for now and see what happens after?”
And completely weird, seeing how Cas wasn’t some kind of love interest in a cringe-worthy romcom or a terrible telenovela but a long–lost friend.
a big part of his life – but she was also gone now and had been for many years. And Dean was allowed to finally be happy again.
“I think I scared you this morning, didn’t I? That’s why you took that wrong step and fell off the slope.”
Her reply was a very grumpy grumble. Feeling exactly the same, Dean still tried not to show it - if he did, he might also crumble and ask his daughter for Cas’ number after all. Instead, he changed the subject, simply by getting up and throwing Gracie over his shoulder.
He thought about opening his mouth then, thought about actually taking Cas in, of actually weighing his heavy cock on his tongue… but somehow, he couldn’t. This was all still so new to him and aside from the thought of, ‘what if I don’t like it? What would that do to us?’ there was also that little voice wondering, ‘what if I’m bad at it and Cas will regret all this?’ Neither was rational, he knew that. His willingness to give blowjobs wouldn’t determine their whole relationship, of course. But the nagging doubt was still there, so instead of going all in, Dean stuck to carefully exploring Cas’ cock for now, before eventually making his way back up. Kissing all over Cas’ stomach, nipping at each bump of his ribs, sucking in one nipple, leaving small kisses all over his collarbone and neck until he reached Cas’ lips again, where Cas kissed him back eagerly.
Dean had to swallow hard… maybe Cas being C. S. James wouldn’t be the only suspicion confirmed tonight...
There was a long silence between them and Gracie was nibbling on her lower lip. Dean could practically see the gears turning in her head and wondered what his clever girl might come up with. He was unsure if anything could have prepared him for what finally came out of her mouth – because when Gracie spoke again, her words cut deep.
It took his daughter longer this time to reply, but he didn’t push. His girl was a smart one, and he loved when she came up with her own solutions.
And before Dean knew what was happening, Gabriel was pulling his brother aside, away from the Winchesters and back into the semi-circle of the Shurley clan, leaving Dean to wonder if he’d really just been standing next to Cas for minutes on end and all they’d said to each other had been, “Hello, Castiel,” and “Mr. Winchester.”
The sound of his name on Cas’ lips made Dean’s head perk up, a slow smile tucking at his mouth as he found Cas’ deep blue eyes again.
Her comment had Dean sigh deeply, closing his book. He sent one more look over to where he had tried to sneakily stare at Mr. Novak, then his focus was back on his friend.
He hadn’t even had time to think about their almost kiss two days ago – because, yes, he was pretty sure they would have kissed if it hadn’t been for Brady interrupting them – and now he already needed to think about Cas essentially telling him that he used to love him.
When Cas nodded, Dean pulled him even closer, pressed one last kiss on his lips, and then tucked Cas’ head under his chin, just holding him tight; giving them both a moment to let it all sink in and to catch their breath. Giving himself a moment to sort his own thoughts.
Dean closed his eyes, trying to stave off the pain those words brought with them. Not only about the prospect of Cas leaving and possibly never returning. But also about Chuck’s situation. He didn’t admonish his friend for it, they all knew it to be true. They might be together and celebrating and laughing and enjoying Christmas time. But underneath it all, they all knew what would come very soon.
“Gracie, you okay to spend some time at the Fair?” he asked, hoping he hadn’t miscalculated her excitement about the event. “Otherwise I would need to drive you home real quick.”
Cas closed the gap and pressed a sweet peck against his lips, sending those damn butterflies soaring in Dean’s stomach. When he also nodded and whispered, “We do,” they began to fly somersaults.
Reaching up, he let his fingers brush gently along Cas’ cheek, over his lips – which were too kissable not to give in – and down his neck, hooking one finger into Cas’ necklace to pull him down by it. He needed to taste him, needed to be connected with him as much as possible. The moment their lips met again though, Cas started moving and Dean was lost. Lost in the feeling, the sensation, even more lost than he had been before, and the only anchor in his haze was
He’d meant it as a joke, but the moment he saw Cas squinting angrily at him, he knew he must have said something wrong.
How long it took them to begin sobering up, he had no idea, but after a while, their laughter died down to a few chuckles. As the ensuing silence grew, the air between them became charged and from one moment to another, Dean became intensely aware of how close they were.
Dean pulled his hand away and took the flashlight from his mouth, pointing it at Cas’ shoulder. Seeing the disaster, he had to force himself to stay calm so as not to scare Cas. Once he was sure he had his voice under control, he gave Cas the verdict.
“Shut up, Sammy,” Dean threw in quietly before turning back to Cas’ aunt. “Amara, listen, I am really sor–”
And Dean believed him. Believed that Cas would accept this part of him just like he did any other part. Lisa was his past – but Cas was his future. And to know that Cas got it made the weight around his heart lighten even more.
Dean’s lips found Cas’ immediately, pouring every single emotion, every bit of passion and fire into this kiss while his hands seemed unable to keep still. He needed to touch, he needed to feel, he needed…
While Cas didn’t say anything, his grin grew wider, telling Dean all he needed to know. Instead of getting lost in those mesmerizing blue eyes, Dean focused back on the book once he freed it of its wrapping. It was a small paperback, old by the looks of it but very well taken care of. Like something one would find in an old bookshop, an antique store or better yet, in the collection of a booklover. Reading the title Dean had to think for a moment before his eyes went wide.
He wanted so much more and in this very moment, his yearning for C was more desperate than it had ever been.
him look at you. Same as I have watched you look at him. You haven’t ever looked at anyone like that, not that I can remember. You look at him like… like… Captain America looks at Peggy,” – that pulled a surprised huff out of Dean – “or like Han Solo and Princess Leia look at each other, or–”
Swallowing hard, Dean sat up. He had a feeling that yesterday’s peace was over. Grace might have been mopey all day and thus hadn’t brought up the topic – but her tone of voice just now told him today would be different.
Internally, Dean flinched. He had known the recipe was sacred in some ways - he just hadn’t fathomed they would make
every language spoken during their trip around Europe was certainly a boon for his own language skills.
As Cas jerked up and even broke his pencil, Dean hoped he wouldn’t notice his slip. He should have said ‘editing’ or ‘working’, not ‘writing’. But too late for that now. Thankfully, Cas seemed not to notice in his surprise.
Dean had to smile at that right along with everyone else. They all knew Chuck had no problem with finding the right words on the spot.
and it wasn’t even the worst feeling. The worst was feeling like he had hurt Cas again. Like it was Dean’s fault that he had been untrue to the guy in New York. He knew it was stupid, Cas was a grown man, he had definitely been on board, so if that resulted in cheating then that decision was on Cas… but still…
Instantly, the class was buzzing, looking around each other to pinpoint who had the best question for him. Knowing that with him, two questions really meant two questions and that they would not get more, they had to think about what they really wanted to know.
“Dean, darling… you do know you can love more people than one, right? Even at the same time. Of course, it’s not ideal - but we would never judge you for that. And neither did Lisa.”
Charlie,” he replied, settling down and giving the redhead a small smile. “Hey, Jo, how’re you holding up with the crazy woman by your side?”
The town square was bursting at its seams, it seemed. Dean was sure it hadn’t been this full any of the other days but that could just be his imagination. Or the giddiness slowly bubbling under his skin when the full realization sank in that in just a few short minutes, he would practically out himself in front of the whole town. He hadn’t even thought of that when he had texted with Cas this morning to agree on a time and place to meet back up for dinner. The town square had simply seemed to be the easiest solution when Cas had told him he would be here anyway.
There was no way Dean could go home in his current state. He didn’t even know what to feel anymore and he wasn’t ready to think about it. He also wasn’t ready to face his daughter, knowing he would have to explain to her why he hadn’t been able to hold Cas back.
Watching him as they just stood there, waiting for Cas to catch his breath and get his bearings, Dean became painfully aware of their closeness. Painful, because this was certainly not the right time to remember last night and certainly not honorable to become aware of how warm Cas was - pressed against his side, breathing heavy, his familiar scent surrounding them - when all the man needed right now was medical help. Dean hated himself at this moment and he was immensely thankful when Cas finally initiated for them to turn around. He seemed to hesitate for a second as they faced the hill he had fallen down.
Seeing his best friend like that, Dean really wanted to tease – but Gabe’s comment brought him up short.
His effort not to flinch at her choice of words was in vain, but he had high hopes that the girls would wave it off as him being seriously scolded. Besides that, Jo was right. He could cry and kick and pout – in the end, these two always got him to talk. And he should get it over with before Gracie woke up and stumbled into the room.
There was a little commotion in the background of the line, a door closing and then footsteps coming closer. Seemed he had just called in time before Eileen made her way over.
She was already babbling on and only when her hand pulled on his jacket was he able to pull his thoughts away from Cas and down to her, grasping the last few of her words.
Dean flinched, thankful that the room was completely dark. And that with her twelve years, Gracie apparently still didn’t get all the ambiguous jokes. Thank God. “Forget I said that. Shouldn’t you be asleep, young lady?”
He knew he was going in circles - had been for the past few days - and not just in his own head, no; but with Cas as well. Dean’s quest to renew their friendship had the same back and forth quality.
Gasping in surprise, Claire went silent and looked at Dean, ignoring some of the quickly stifled laughter of her classmates. Before he could say anything, she had found her voice again, picked up the cap, and chucked it back at him.
. He gave in to his desires and followed his instincts. This was how a moment later, he found himself kneeling in front of Cas, a little grin playing around his lips as he looked back up, watching as Cas took a moment to catch up on what was happening, and then his eyes slightly widening as he finally did. Dean held his gaze as he first helped him step out of those sweatpants and his woolen socks. He still held it when he slowly leaned in, not daring to miss a moment of Cas’ reactions.
Seeking him out with his eyes, he found him in a heartfelt embrace with daughter, wondering what had just transpired between these two but seeing no way of finding out without prying into their lives too much. So instead, he finished his drink and waited for the start of the next movie they all wanted to watch.
It still sounded unreal to even think about, but the giddy feeling the thought left inside of Dean was undeniable. Maybe Amara was mistaken. Maybe Cas kept his boyfriend a secret from all his siblings
He longed for C – the physical person and to have the opportunity to learn all the identifying details of them, but he also longed for the character behind the person who has given Dean so much strength.
would close on January 31st... but I am SO IN LOVE with all your ideas 😍 and I think I don't want to stop reading what you've got for me, so I have decided to LEAVE IT OPEN 😊
This was it. The moment he’d been wishing for since their first conversation, all of a sudden here. This was it and there he was, his soulmate. Dean was unable to move for a second. Only for a second though, because a heartbeat later, his feet suddenly moved on their own accord, drawing him closer and closer to the figure.
The boy gave him a shy smile, nothing more than a quick tuck on his lips before he made to leave the room.
At first, the proximity was all he could focus on, the movie too familiar for its story to be a real distraction for Dean. The longer they sat like this, though; the longer Cas just casually reached for more popcorn from his bucket, the more normalcy began to set in. His heart was still beating faster but somewhere in the middle of the movie, Dean realized that it was now more of a constant presence. A constant state when Cas was there. It wasn’t just nerves anymore. No…
“Hello, Chuck, it’s nice to see you too,” Eileen replied, probably not noticing the somewhat awkward tenseness in the air.
“Guess it’s best we do it as soon as possible then, rip off the bandaid and all that,” Dean teased back, grinning when Charlie stuck out her tongue at him before offering in all seriousness, “How about you join us for next week’s Sunday dinner? I’m sure Chuck will be thrilled to have you back and hear all about Europe. You’re still set to return Saturday night, right?”
Monday morning started with a double session literature with his own class. After what had happened last week, Dean had promised himself to take extra effort not to let his personal feelings and problems seep into his work life.
Really, how could he argue with her logic? He was still surprised though; why had she felt the need to write her favorite author in the first place? Finally, he began studying the papers again, reading the words his daughter had entrusted him with.
What pulled him out of this dreamlike haze – if only for a short while – was Zar waiting for them when they stumbled out of the elevator. It took Dean a moment to even become aware of the man, too caught up and entangled in Cas and quite frankly a little bit drunk on his carefree laughter. It seemingly died the moment Cas became aware of the other man, leading to Dean doing the same.
done something wrong. That he hadn’t realized their absence right away. But C had just woken from a coma, they certainly had other things to worry about now. So Dean shoved his guilt aside and instead replied with,
Even more amazing, though, was the man next to him. Hair tousled, five o'clock shadow back where it belonged, sharp features soft from sleep… Cas looked like an angel. Really, all that was missing was the morning sun giving him a halo but Dean knew it was too early for the winter’s sun to rise, the sky outside not even gray yet.
Surprisingly, it didn’t take much for Dean to get Gracie to bed that night and he had an inkling that his daughter simply wanted the day to be over. He knew the feeling all too well.
Dean knew his daughter hadn’t resented Lydia because she didn’t want a stepmother or because she had feared Lydia would take her dad away from her. She had resented the woman because she simply hadn’t liked her. But with Cas?
But as he had done so often, Cas ignored him - and the call from his own brother - as he pressed through the crowd. Not another word, not a backward glance.
Looking around, he saw a sole figure pacing along the water’s edge, illuminated by the full moon and the reflection of the light on the lake. Dean stopped for a moment and simply took in the view.
With what little space they had - big girl or not, Cherry still was just a horse and they were two grown men - Dean’s chest was pressed against Cas’ back right away. He had anticipated that, had known it. But the feeling still had his heart racing, the moment almost distracting him. But he couldn’t let that happen so Dean did not hesitate to wind his arms around Cas’ torso to grab the reins to get Cherry going. Even though he wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and inhale this wonderful fragrance that was Cas’ scent.
There was a strand of Cas’ incredibly unruly hair falling onto his face and for the first time, Dean allowed himself to do something his fingers had itched to do so many times before. Tenderly, he brushed the hair away from Cas’ forehead as he began to talk.
Dean closed his eyes and breathed out heavily. “I was trying to push that out of my mind, but yes… yes, that’s of course another thing. Not everyone of us was as lucky as you, meeting their soulmate right before the pandemic hit and social distancing made it practically impossible to find them.”
And with this, the suffering and pining is finally over 🥳 next chapter will be up tomorrow, filled with some much-needed talking... and some much-needed sexy times 😏
It really was that guy again and unbidden, Gabe’s words came back to Dean. A secret lover? And Cas’ didn’t want the man to worry? Wasn’t that a sign that this Zar really
He was glaring at the three older Shurley brothers, thinking quickly. Of course all of them knew why he would be reluctant to see his daughter begin to drive on her own, without him being there to protect her. But… that surely wasn’t a topic for a light-hearted, warm family Christmas. He had no desire to ruin the general atmosphere and there would always be time to talk to them later in earnest.
It was a purple stripe, quickly followed by a blue one, then a green one. By the time the yellow one appeared, Dean remembered to write back.
“I’m so going to enjoy this,” he mumbled against Dean’s lips, but all too soon leaned back a bit again. “But as for your question… I guess ‘boyfriends’ was the term you were looking for.”
As the guy’s face came into the light, Dean grimaced internally. He remembered him as one of the jocks who were assholes to Cas during school. He really could not risk him seeing Cas like this.
The couple looked at each other for two, maybe three seconds – and then started their squealing back up and this time, Dean really did duck his face and cover his ears… along with the deep, deep blush he was sure was spreading across his cheeks as he finally realized what they were hollering about. Sonofabitch, there was no chance for him and Gracie to hear anything about Dublin today. None at all.
It did not have the desired effect. Right away, Cas stopped their kiss and also stopped his hands with his own.
some ways out of town, after all. Gracie even had her own room up here, in case Dean had to travel for a school camp or some related instance and Bobby would look after her for those few nights. Sam and Eileen had a room just for them as well and even kept a few of their things here.
How long they sat like that, Dean couldn’t tell. It was long enough for the water to have slowly cooled around them but Dean couldn’t find it in him to care. And it seemed neither did Cas, who simply held onto him and kept soothing him.
The only thing Dean hadn’t done so far was talk to Cas. Part of him excused it with not wanting to crowd him, giving him the space he had shown time and time again he wanted. The honest truth, however, was that Dean was mostly scared about even approaching Cas. How should he do that? He couldn’t very well have this talk in front of Cas’ whole family. But what could he say to lure him to another room? Cas surely would never follow. Or worse, he
Dean put the pen aside and started up his Baby, his wonderful Chevy Impala, his pride and joy. He had found her in Bobby’s scrapyard and Bobby had allowed him to work on her in his free time. Now she was his, restored and as beautiful as a car could be. She was the reason he had picked the class he was currently heading to, an extra-curricular that would help him a great deal one day.
He was tempted to clasp his hands over his ears at the screeching and squealing that came through the speakers. Instead, he laughed at the joy as he watched Charlie and Jo celebrating, basking in the love and enthusiasm his friends had for him.
The third picture was his favorite of Lisa, smiling right at the camera. It had been taken on their honeymoon, at a beach in Florida. She’d been beaming like the sun the whole time and sometimes Dean thought he was still able to hear her carefree laughter from that day. Looking at the picture still made him smile, even though his heart was heavy, missing her every day.
none, really, except for that short paragraph in 17 that Cas is moping around all day and then goes out and gets drunk with Zar 😅
“Careful there, Cas,” Dean replied with mock threat in his voice, able to suppress his smile to not ruin the effect.
“Okay, so I’ve always been your exception and… what? You just decided you’re into men now?” Cas asked instead of continuing with their kiss and while Dean really wanted to pull him back in, he did the right thing.
He knew he had no right to apologize or ask for forgiveness and he knew he was the last man on earth Cas wanted to be around. Cas really didn’t need to drill it into his head like this – but he did, and he went on.
However, the cold seemed to take its toll on Cas, and Dean was thankful when they made it to the top. Soon enough, he would get Cas where it was warm and where he could get help.
Right away Cas’ eyes went wide and Dean could see his ears grow red. He threw him a cheeky grin and knocked his knee into Cas’ leg. “Calm down,” he said, keeping his voice low. “I’m just ripping you. I really like how you care for her.”
Gracie beamed up at him and picked one of the cookies, calling out for Cas who had drawn closer by now.
“I am–” kiss “– thrilled–” kiss “– ecstatic–” kiss “– happy–” kiss “– blissful–” kiss “– and so damn in love. I love you, Cas. I love you so much.”
by now, so you should know all about my wedding. To add to that, let me also tell you what I told my students back then because it’s still true. I did not - nor will I ever - have a problem with Castiel’s actions. Was it ideal to do it at my wedding? Probably not. But I still think it takes a brave person to be as honest as he was that day and to openly voice his feelings. And I pity those who think it’s okay to make fun of such a person because obviously, they have never felt the same way before.”
It was around the time George Bailey rejected Potter’s offer of becoming his assistant that Dean’s thoughts were interrupted by Cas clearing his throat. He shifted, turning somewhat so he was looking toward Dean. Right away, Cas had his attention… his
An idiot and… apparently ‘the other guy’ now. Without knowing, without ever wanting to, Dean had become a fucking cheater. God, he really was going to throw up.
They never stayed long, never got out of the car. And the moment passed as soon Dean crossed the intersection, leaving it behind.
“You have his number, right?” He waited for Grace to nod before he went on. “I’m sure he would like it if you two kept in contact.” Maybe Cas had played him and maybe Dean had no right to be so sure of the truth in Cas’ fondness in regards to Gracie. But he refused to believe that Cas would be so petty as to ignore his daughter. “He gave you that script for a reason, after all. So don’t hesitate to text him.”
How long he sat there, at the side of the road, he had no idea. It wasn’t until his phone rang with Sam’s ringtone that a flash of clarity broke through the haze in Dean’s mind.
Dean’s eyes were so warm, so soft, and combined with that smile playing around his lips, his gaze spoke of what Cas now knew for sure Dean was about to say. And he wasn’t disappointed.
“Oh, you did not just say that,” Dean replied, pretending to take offense. He knew, after all, that Cas was just teasing - but no one,
The sign itself was pretty simple and obvious: the hand movement for the color blue while Cas’ fingers showed the letter C.
dumb.” His glare did little to stop Jo’s rant. “Have you ever considered he might be embarrassed, or even still harboring feelings for you?”
Still, it was hard. Hard to not reach for him, maybe brush his hand against his arm or shoulder, or push his knee into Cas’ just so that they could touch.
Another of Dean’s fingers slipped inside of him easily and the pleasurable feeling had Cas breaking their kiss and sitting up to try and push them inside him more. Staring down at his soulmate, he could feel their love for each other radiating through the room. He simply couldn’t wait anymore, he needed to feel Dean inside of him.
The second floor existed completely of bedrooms for various family members, friends or guests staying over, in case they couldn’t make it home that night. The ranch
“Oh Dean!” she finally exclaimed, her grip intensifying even more - any further and he was sure she would bruise him. “This is not about Lisa, is it?”
As quickly as he could, Dean crossed over to the man on the ground. He could see him trying to sit up only to yelp in pain, spurring Dean to rush the last few steps and come to a stop right next to Cas, slipping a little on the ice.
Those words had come from his heart and somehow… somehow it felt wrong to take them out now. They belonged with everything else inside the envelope and in a spur of the moment, Dean fished for a pen in his duffle and scribbled Cas’ name on the outside. Now, whatever would happen, he at least had the option to leave it behind.
These same questions wouldn’t leave his head the entire day, repeating themselves over and over again.
Trying to ignore his disappointment of not finding Cas among the group, Dean sat down. Maybe he should count himself lucky. Maybe after what he had admitted last night and then again this morning… maybe it was for the best to still have a breather.
He’d already stepped through the door when a silly thought hit him that he just couldn’t resist. Leaning back around the door, he murmured, “See you in the morning,” before following Gracie back to the foyer.
Dean was so deep in thoughts, he only saw the shadowy movement when it was already too late. Cherry, however, reacted right away, neighing and even rearing up. Not enough to throw him off – Dean was too experienced a rider for that – but it still made his stomach drop for a moment.
But Cas was willing to talk and while he hadn’t said it just now, Dean was finally reassured of Cas’ feelings for him – which was all that was important for now. Because everything else would fall into place and if nothing else, he was sure that they would be alright.
After what felt like an eternity, Joshua finally spoke into the phone. “Hello, Sir. No, I’m afraid your pizza has not yet arrived. But I have a Mr. Dean Winchester down here.”
“He did?” Dean asked in surprise – not because he felt ashamed or embarrassed that Michael knew what his brother and Dean had done. But because he was shocked that Cas would admit to it when he most likely had a boyfriend back in New York.
he say without destroying Gracie’s view of the man she had admired for so long and had now come to love as a close friend; had already begun to look at as someone she could count on in their lives?
And he even seemed excited about Dean opening it, if his request of, “You go first,” once they had exchanged the parcels was anything to go by.
Harry and Alice Braeden would stay for two nights, sleeping in one of the guest rooms in the main house, and then leave for New York on Friday to start a cruise over the holidays. It had been Dean’s Christmas gift to them and a perfect excuse to have Lisa’s parents visit them again so soon after Thanksgiving. Even all these years after Lisa’s death, Dean was still close to her parents and grateful for it. They were the only grandparents Grace had left - at least, by blood. Of course, Grace had a whole lot more than that, but that wasn’t the point.
Smile spreading wider again, filled with that easy happiness he always felt when he saw his students, he stopped to chat for a minute. “Hey, you all. Happy New Year to you too.”
“I absolutely agree. I wouldn’t want to decide anything without her well-being in mind. And making that decision together… that sounds perfect, actually,” Cas admitted, snuggling into Dean’s embrace. “But for now, I guess the easiest would be for me to move back home. It would also mean I’m closer to my dad, so I feel like that’s the best solution for as long… well…
Grace’s confused question actually stung, making Dean realize what kind of picture she must have simply based on their rather cold and rare interaction.
Even though he tried, his chastising stare probably wasn’t as impressive as Dean would’ve hoped for, all too soon breaking into a chuckle when Jo and Charlie grinned at him like two cats who got the cream.
“Hey, Mr. Winchester! Happy New Year,” it quickly echoed around the large group, and on the spot, Dean counted about ten, maybe fifteen of his seniors.
And just like Monday, Gracie was suddenly gone from his side, Dean completely missing his cue to leave as well.
It was racing for another reason entirely and he knew that after last night and after this moment right here, there would be no way for him to deny it any longer.
Unable to stop himself and somewhat for emphasis, Dean rolled his hips, slowly, oh so slowly, their cocks sliding against each other, which coaxed a breathy moan out of both of them. God, never had Dean thought that this feeling could be so… so…
He could see the multitude of emotions flit across Cas’ face in a single heartbeat – sadness, disappointment, fear – but he didn’t leave any of them time to fester, moving his hand to Cas’ back to pull him flush against his chest as his lips caught Cas’.
Swallowing, Dean had an inkling about where this was heading, yet tried to prevent it. “We’ve kept you ladies long enough. Don’t you wanna explore Lisbon? ‘Sides, I should get going. Get Gracie’s breakfast ready.”
If there was anything else to discuss, Dean really hoped it could wait until the morning. Because he was ready to be done talking and he made sure to show Cas just that. Taking the man by surprise, he adjusted his grip and rolled them over, spreading Cas out while he hovered over him.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Cas replied with feeling. “Please tell her I’m alright and of course I’ll wait for her again tomorrow.”
Michael and Sam treated her like family, like their niece. Which was obviously awesome and as they should.
“So, funny story,” he began, not knowing what else he could say. “I just had an amazing night and when I woke up... you were gone.”
Dean shook his head. There was time for that later – and certainly no time anymore to think about Novak. Because.
While Charlie and Gracie babbled on, Dean tried to mull over Jo’s words. What did she say had been her next steps? Starting to explore? Maybe he should do that as well. Or maybe he should ask Sam and Eileen to take Grace tonight so he could get to Hartford. Get to a club and …
Cas closed his eyes for a moment, letting those words sink in fully and settle into every fiber of his being while he nuzzled Dean’s hand. Before he finally opened his eyes again and replied with the words he’d wanted to say for so many years already. “I love you too, Dean.”
There was a long silence between them, Dean’s heart becoming heavier by the minute. Did Cas even realize that by denying, he actually confirmed what Dean had said?
“Sam and Bobby got it covered,” Dean told him, trying to convince himself as much as Cas. “Eileen and Gracie are there as well, and so is Dr. Richardson.” His family got this. They knew what to do, they got it covered.
Coming to his senses, Dean’s hand on Cas’ arm suddenly felt like it was burning, despite the coldness that grew between them. Slowly, he let go of the man, his hand dropping down in defeat, no idea any longer what to do.
He had no idea how many blocks he’d already walked by the time his head finally cleared, leaving him with the realization that he had just stumbled through a minor panic attack. He stopped at a crossroads, leaning his hand against a street sign to steady himself. Back home in Stars Hollow, he knew at least five people would have come rushing to ask if he was okay. But this was New York, so he was safe, he was left alone.
“And you?” Harry asked, his grey eyes fixed on Dean. There was no trace of any kind of malice - which honestly did
“No, Cas, I’m serious,” he promised before Cas could do exactly that. “I understand. I just... I want you to know that I’ll do whatever you wish.” And he would, he truly would. He just needed to hear it from Cas, once and for all. So he finally knew for real. “If you tell me to leave you in peace, I will and you’ll never hear from me again. But if you give me just one hint, just a little one, I’ll fight for you –”
Why? Why did he keep calling him that? Dean couldn’t control his voice and the pain in it, as he asked exactly that question out loud at last.
But in this moment, Dean knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that his students could see right into his soul. He had absolutely no control over his expression.
“Yeah, Cas is fine,” Dean said, his voice growing even softer as he turned around. Catching Cas looking at him, he smiled at the man before speaking to his daughter again. “There were a few misunderstandings and we were both too stupid to talk about it, is all.”
of her very knowing smiles. One that - no matter how annoying it sometimes was - still spread warmth all around his heart, last night’s conversation still so fresh on his mind.
As the time for presents began, it was a given the kids would open theirs first, as any sane adult knew to do. Especially with so many of them in the room.
Moving his head just enough to reach Cas’ neck, he peppered him with light kisses, little nips here and there. He even sucked on that delicious skin, leaving silly little love bites that made him feel immensely proud as he watched them bloom. Possessive even.
“Hey, Max, it’s alright,” Dean interrupted. “Honestly, don’t sweat it. This is not official school business, it’s a fundraiser. And your classmates will understand. They had it handled.” He watched as Max’ shoulders sagged in relief, some of the tension he always seemed to carry leaving him.
Sighing, he let go of his anger, his voice softer. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to blow up on you like that.”
Over the years, it had become a habit for the four of them to take the route into town that would bring them past the intersection that had claimed Lisa’s life, and to pause there for a brief moment. Though the intersection had changed a lot since then - the trees that had once crowded the corners were cut back to make way for a low flowering ground cover and two street lights on opposite corners - it still never failed to affect the family, though no one pointed it out.
Loosening the hug, she kept her hands on his arms, holding him close as she smiled up at him. With a soft caress of his cheek and a gentle pat, she let go of him. Dean returned the smile before greeting Harry with a kind of sideways hug, as Gracie refused to let go of her grandfather.
But he also knew Chuck well enough to know he wouldn’t want that. Wouldn’t want for either of them to think too hard about it or to already mourn him, instead of celebrating the life and the wonderful time they had together. Aside from that, he had also noticed how content Chuck had grown over the past few weeks. Not only regarding the whole situation – Chuck had long made his peace with his impending death and everybody knew that. No, it was more in the ways he seemed to be… refreshed again. Dean would almost say he had a new spring in his step, one that hadn’t been there in a while. It wasn’t hard to guess that being surrounded by his family did wonders to his health and general disposition.
Searching for a way to have his hands free but still enough light, Dean put the end of the little flashlight in his mouth. But as he reached out, Cas flinched away and winced even though he hadn’t touched him yet.
Dean thought about it, chuckling when he had to shake his head over Eileen’s idea. Pressing a quick kiss to her forehead, he opened the door and left the room with a smile.
A small noise came from his left, nothing more than a grunt, someone clearly in pain. It was enough for Dean to zero in on that place. And thank
But Dean had no reply to that and was only able to stare at Cas. Who only shook his head, looking as if he was unable to believe their exchange either - or maybe it was just Dean’s reaction he couldn't understand.
The truck was rumbling along the road. It had felt safer to take this vehicle rather than his Impala and Dean was rather impressed that he had the presence of mind to think this far. If it hadn’t been for his crying daughter in his arms, Dean was sure he would’ve bolted for the door, jumped into the first car available, and rushed after Cas.
It was well past ten o’clock later that night when Dean sent Gracie to bed. He might not have been able to at all - at least without risking a fight - if it hadn’t been for Bobby declaring he was beat as well, breaking up their cozy round. Still, he was sure he would find his daughter reading in bed - or at least her torch shoved under her pillow when he came to kiss her goodnight.
As he expected, what followed was hushed silence. Not one of his students was ready to be confronted. Letting his gaze wander, he noted that hardly any of them were able to keep eye contact. So really, this was either about him or something they thought would get them into trouble. Or maybe they all really did still remember last week too well.
However, right as he got to the point of breaking, Cas’ phone rang. Right away, Cas looked around, obviously searching for it under all the mess of papers spread over the table.
To this day, he wished he hadn’t had to put the friendship on hold when he’d started teaching at Stars Hollow High. But he’d been so young, so unsure. He hadn’t wanted to mess up and let people talk about how he favored one student because he was friends with him in private. It was bad enough everybody was watching the young teacher with hawkeyes, most of the town knowing the womanizer he had been just a few years prior. He still painfully remembered that one town meeting right before the school year had started, when a concerned father had talked about how he feared Dean would flirt with the girls in his class, maybe even hand out better grades for –
Dean huffed out a soft chuckle, amazed at how easily his soulmate was able to read him. Doing as C ordered, he took a deep breath as he watched C write more words.
Hell, if it hadn’t been for the latter, he might’ve even asked Novak out after all, if only to see if he was his C.
right back at you,” Dean said, rolling his eyes. “You do remember I helped you prepare for this trip and learned some vocab in the process, right?”
Holding himself back before he added three little words, Dean put the pen back into his pocket and once again got to work, letting his thoughts stray.
“Really?” Dean replied, puzzled for a moment as he looked at Cas. When the man didn’t say anything, Dean grinned. That certainly explained Grace’s mood change. It also let the warm feeling inside of Dean spread further. Ignoring it, he turned back to his daughter. “Well that’s great. I wouldn’t want you to miss out because of me.”
“Alright, convinced,” Dean replied, finally letting the grin and the happiness take over as he tightened his embrace, pulling Cas closer for another kiss.
“Dean, you thought you had dibs on all the cheerleaders,” Michael reminded him with a fond exasperation in his voice, finally looking at him, if only to give him a meaningful look that had both of them attempting to grin at each other.
“I guess what I’m trying to say is,” Michael continued, his voice calmer now, holding an ounce of pain. “Be careful, Dean. I love you like a brother… but Cas
Not that they knew that Dean wanted to be a mechanic, of course – that would’ve been way too much information, apparently. Not for the first time, Dean had grumbled over the stupid rules. As if he would be the only mechanic in the whole wide world.
realized what was about to happen… even now, all he could feel was the excitement of being with Cas again soon, holding him in his arms and kissing him.
Once back inside and showered, Dean went about his usual morning routine of preparing some tea and tidying the house. Instead of letting his mind wander as he usually would, he made sure it stayed focused on the tasks at hand, keeping his thoughts from straying into unwanted territory. All along, he made sure to steel himself for the upcoming conversation.
job to protect her. Not only from the terrible accident itself but from all that came afterward as well. From the emotions he felt, from his fear for his girl, from his fear about her future. But instead, she had heard him cry at night when he thought she was asleep, had been scared for him, had worried about
Not even when Dean reveled in the discussion that followed the statement. They talked about books and authors and what should be read at school and at what age and really, they could have discussed the wars of the world and Dean would have been just as happy, enjoying Cas’ company and hearing his voice, seeing his smile and just generally being full of joy.
For a moment, he was angry at Patty and Babette. How dare these two gossipers start all this shit all over again? Thanks to them, people -
Talking from experience, Dean knew all too well how it was to have the shelves filled with notebooks that were ‘too nice’ to write in, not wanting to ruin their perfection. It was actually John’s old journal which had given him the idea for this alternative.
Cas was right; after all that had happened the last few days, he hadn’t taken any time to really think about his first time with him beyond the bigger picture. And now his second time. Was it… was it weird? Did he feel strange, sleeping with a man?
“Yes, Cas,” he interrupted. Unable to let Cas be the one to say it outloud, he had to bite the bullet himself. “As in having naughty thoughts about my student, damnit.”
“Oh yeah?” Dean challenged, slowly starting to be pissed off. “Did he tell you he actually has a boyfriend back in New York?”
Letting go of Cas so he could stand up straight, Dean moved his arms so Cas could easily rid him of his shirt as he replied. “Oh, you know. Sold a book or two. Can’t complain.”
He should’ve kept moving the second Emma was gone, but he wasn’t quick enough. Obviously, he also wasn’t paying all that much attention right now or he would have realized
“She’s right,” Charlie went on, her gaze just as serious as Jo’s. “But promise that you’ll call if you need us. No matter the time and no matter if it’s just to talk or to get our advice.”
Dean had to swallow and think for a while before being sure he would be able to talk without his voice giving out.
Dean watched from the kitchen island as his daughter and mother-in-law worked in sync on the next batch of Angel Cookies. He had heard of them over the years, of course - the cookies were a legend within the Shurley clan after all. But for some reason, he had never tried them until last Sunday. They were awesome and the recipe a well-kept secret of the family. So much so, that Dean had been surprised when Michael had actually given it to him. He had only sent that text message to his friend to appease his daughter, internally already grinning about how Michael would have to withstand her puppy eyes the next time they saw each other after telling them no. Not even for a second had he thought Michael would just hand him the family’s treasure. No matter how close they were.
With a wide grin, Cas rolled them back around and quickly took care of Dean’s jeans, pulling them off of him as fast as humanly possible. Crawling back up and over his body, Dean could see the glint in Cas’ eyes as he studied Dean’s face. For what, Dean didn’t know – and in the next second, he also didn’t care anymore because
“– but it doesn’t matter,” Dean hastened on. He needed to get this out, needed these words to finally be spoken and for Cas to finally hear them. “It doesn’t say what I really came here to tell you.”
Dean was so caught up in Cas’ smile and their friendly banter, the new arrival in the diner went unnoticed until someone stepped right next to him and he heard Lydia’s greeting.
, really. To the night they had, to the things they’d shared. But also to the fact that he was still holding Cas’ arms, the man not pulling away from him.
And for all the words he could have possibly said, they stuck in his throat. Even if he’d had any idea at all what to say... his vocal chords seemed clamped together, his brain was momentarily out of order. He was frozen in place unable to react, unable to even
“Deal,” Cas replied right away, even sticking out his hand for Dean to shake. “We’ll talk about the stakes tomorrow.”
And when Cas replied with a heartfelt, “Absolutely,” and took his hand to pull him along, Dean knew it would all be alright. There were still so many things to discuss, so many things to clear up between them; he still didn’t know why Cas had run away, still didn’t know if Cas wanted a future with him or what any of this would ultimately lead to.
His boxer shorts were pulled away and soon after, naked skin touched naked skin, making Dean almost choke on his moan. Dean felt a shiver run through Cas’ entire body but he was almost positive it wasn’t from the cold. Though he couldn’t quite be sure of anything right now. His mind was foggy and there were so many sensations all at once and then there was a hand on his cock. On both of theirs and
Smiling nervously, Dean brushed a hand over his neck. “Course not. May the best snowman win, and all that.”
While he ate, there was a quiet calm over them. Gracie was still working on her homework, as it seemed, and Cas was apparently working on his book. Dean was just happily munching away on his pie, until Cas looked back at him, a mischievous smile playing around his lips.
His daughter’s reply wasn’t much more than a mumble, but Dean knew her well enough to grasp the answer. Pulling her even closer, he pressed a kiss to her hair, before whispering again. “You will do great, Pumpkin. You fought so hard to be back here and I am so,
“Heeey,” Dean greeted back into his laptop, Gracie next to him sounding just as excited as she waved at Charlie and Jo. “How is it going for you?”
It was the simple truth and at this time of night, alone in his office, knowing that no one would ever see this doodle, Dean felt safe to put his feelings on paper. It felt good, almost liberating. Maybe it was a first step in healing his broken heart.
They tumbled into Cas’ house and barely made it to the couch, their clothes coming off in a weird mix of hastily discarding them and reverently unwrapping the gift that was the other’s skin. With every touch, their connection deepened; with every kiss, every sigh, every moan, the bond between them grew. It was so intense, Cas was surprised when at some point, Dean had reached for his cheek, brushing away tears he hadn’t even realized he had shed. Tears of emotion too intense to keep bottled up.
For the umpteenth time, he considered getting in the car and searching for him. But really, what good would it do? All it would do was put himself in danger and he couldn’t do that to Gracie.
Reining in his emotions, Dean turned back towards his family - only to find Alice’s eyes on him, her smile soft, her eyes mischievous. Sometimes, she reminded him of Lisa so much it hurt. Harry and Gracie were further down, looking at some trinkets he was sure his daughter was about to talk her grandpa into buying her.
“Charlie’s not wrong, you know,” Jo said into the screen, still holding Charlie back from babbling on. “We should totally all come here one day. Gracie, you would
“Cas, hey,” Dean whispered softly, resting his hand on Cas’ cheek to cradle his head. “Take a breath.” As he did, Dean pressed a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth before leaning back again to give Cas space to think. “Now start over. What is it you want to ask?”
Cas’ harsh breathing filled the room, the man sprawled on his bed, looking divine and utterly blissed out. Grinning, Dean kissed a path up his body – avoiding the mess on Cas’ stomach – taking some extra time when he reached his neck, and finally caught his lips in a lazy kiss.
They were still kissing and Dean really did get lost in it this time until Cas broke the kiss and repositioned himself so he was sitting on top of him. Still needing more contact, Dean rested his hands on Cas’ thighs, not doing anything but to softly brush his thumbs along the skin. Transfixed, he watched as Cas put a liberal amount of lube on his right hand – his good hand – and then reached behind him before Dean could even think to offer some assistance. Despite the cast still on Cas’ left wrist, he seemed to manage just fine.
,” he finally admitted, because there hadn’t been any real talking. “You know, the way it is in dreams. But in that moment, I knew that’s what she said to me. Does that make sense?”
“Don’t call me your buddy, and then try to kiss me the next moment. Do you even know what you’re doing to me?”
When Caesar appeared, Dean ordered himself some pie and coffee. Maybe after his favorite food, the world would look different. He was halfway through devouring the delicious cherry pie when he realized Eileen’s eyes had never left him, still boring into his soul. Not shying away from her gaze, he hoped it would get her off his agenda.
“And I felt guilty at first because I know Lisa would have deserved better, although I did love her.” That would forever be true. Lisa
Dean was sure he had nodded at that; or had reacted in any way, at least. But by the time Dean was able to find his voice again, Luke had been long gone.
To his great shame, he had to admit that he hardly remembered any of what had actually been said. He’d been too far in his own head, too deep into beating himself up. Of course, there had been Sam, taking his side; there had been those who had taken the children aside so they wouldn’t hear the commotion. There had been some yelling and accusations and a lot of, “Why did you do that?”
It only took a few minutes for him to realize that he was not turned on by the guys on the screen. Oh, they certainly looked fit and sexy and if Dean were gay, he would totally be wanking off to them touching each other…
Across the room, Gabriel suddenly seemed to seek some attention. Calling out over the whole room, he asked a question that brought a hush over the group - and Dean was pretty sure he was not just imagining the reaction.
it had been so long since Dean had been with another person. But right away, he was engulfed in all the feelings again. The giddiness, the anticipation, the tingle. The need and the want. The pure sensation of euphoria.
“You scraped your shoulder pretty badly, your shirt is even ripped open.” Checking again, Dean swallowed hard. “And it looks dislocated. I would offer to fix it, but your whole arm seems completely messed up. I’d only hurt you more.”
He had tried to kiss a man who had once loved him, who had once been burned by him… and who was now probably running as far away from him as possible, leaving a new kind of pandemonium in his wake.
There was no way his scattered thoughts could actually be reigned in so he could focus on finding a reply when Cas was driving him crazy like this. His dick was already so hard, twitching and jerking, especially when Cas’ breath ghosted over his already sensitized skin. Trying to at least get his breathing back under control – when had it turned so erratic? – he tightened his grip around Cas.
They soon decided on a compromise, shutting out the real world for just a little longer while Cas’ showed Dean how much he himself loved to give head…
It wasn’t until they were both truly starting to shiver that they finally let go of each other and got out of the jacuzzi. It was getting dark outside, making Dean realize for the first time just how many hours he’d already been in New York. As Cas switched on the lights, Dean moved over to the shower, grinning as Cas quickly joined him.
As she went on, Dean was sure she did not notice the subtle change of atmosphere within the three adults.
Right away, Cas’ eyes were on him, bare of all the cold he usually sent Dean’s way. “It’s okay,” he assured and right away turned back to Gracie. “I … guess I can arrange something, yes.”
When his hand wandered to Cas’ neck to draw him back in, Cas melted against him right away, the kiss no longer interrupted by his chuckles. It might have been cold outside… but it definitely wasn’t too cold for a second round.
explanation, really. His thoughts circled back to when exactly the change in Cas’ mood had happened. It seemed so unreasonable and weird, but-
Since Cas turned his head in Michael’s direction, Dean was unable to see his expression as he replied with, “Just a little something I wrote.” But his words – and the clear grin in his tone of voice – were more than enough for Dean to put two and two together, the audible gasp going around the room all the confirmation he needed.
“Everything!” Cas yelled back, not really helpful. Because, yeah. Yeah, Dean knew he was to blame for all that had gone wrong tonight but… but there was something about Cas… something… “How dare you do that to me?” Cas yelled again, voice fighting against the wind, but Dean could hear him just fine. He could also see him just fine, watching as Cas moved around the car to get closer to him. His gait held nothing of Cas’ usually so sure steps and Dean wondered if it was the heavy snow that made him stumble.
He didn’t need it spelled out to understand what he’d just walked into. Swallowing hard once more, he nodded, taking an uneasy step back. “Alright, well… ehm. Guess I’ll leave you to it then. Sorry for just… crashing in here like that. Guess I should’ve called.”
He mostly stayed back and supervised, letting the kids run the show. It was great seeing how they found their flow, dancing around each other to help customers as if they had always done this. Dean only helped when the rush on the cookies was so big they needed another pair of helping hands. But even when he wasn’t actively helping, he was busy talking to people, explaining what they had planned, pointing them to the big billboard his class had created for this event. Showing in detail everything they wanted to do on their trip to New York and how it would be educational for them.
“This already looks interesting,” Dean said as he picked up the first one at random. Unwrapping it, he was soon greeted by… “A dragon?”  Looking closer, he quickly noticed something about this particular dragon. “Wait… I know this form. Is this… is this from shop class?”
And when Cas looked back up at him, those big blue eyes still watery but also shining with a tenderness he hadn’t seen in them since…
would be aired and though he was closing in on forty, Dean was still looking forward to this movie - old man or not, he still loved an epic heroic story with an important message woven in along with some tear-jerking moments.
Unable to stop himself, he leaned in one last time to steal another kiss from Cas, then he took one of his hands and led him around the corner and to the barn door. They had to really fight against the wind to even get there but Dean pushed through, reminded once more how cold Cas had been. Once inside, Cas let go of his hand but before Dean could panic that he had done something wrong, he saw him rubbing his hands together. He looked stunned by the sudden warm air surrounding them, confirming Dean’s suspicion that he had been completely oblivious to the cold and how he had been freezing.
“We’re always talking about what I want,” Dean found himself murmuring as his desire grew tenfold. His desire to give this man in his arms everything he had ever dreamed of, everything he deserved, everything he could ever want. He let his gaze follow his own fingers as they traced Cas’ kiss-swollen lips before he looked back up into Cas’ eyes. “But what is it
? Feel comfortable, I mean.” Dean’s deepening frown must’ve shown Cas that his question was confusing, because he quickly went on, “With us– no! I mean with
planned on looking it all up. Thought about it, yes, but more like a side note. Like a stray thought of ‘I could actually do that and maybe find them.’
No, but he knew his family well enough to know they would only keep poking and prodding until they got what they wanted. This way he hoped to appease them - give them a bit of insight but then also make sure they knew that there was no prospect of anything coming from it. Maybe, if he added a little, ‘it hurts to think about it, so please leave it be,’ it would even shut them up about that topic for good.
Not when he finally had the man of his dreams, the love of his life kissing him with tender desperation. Not when he was finally getting back that feeling he had dared to dream about the night before Christmas.
Dean knew his heartbreak showed, he knew he was lashing out at others, but he couldn’t change it. He couldn’t stop the worry he felt, the sadness, the heart wrenching pain. It felt as if he lost a part of himself. This was one of the worst things he had ever experienced. He couldn’t just pretend like everything was alright yet.
The broken question of his daughter almost made him lose it. But in the end, it was the deep, deep hurt in Cas’ eyes that broke him. When their gazes locked, he was immediately thrown back thirteen years.
He was kissing the man he had loved without knowing it was love; had been in love with for forever and who had always loved him back and Dean was not sure if his heart was still in his chest, it was beating so wild it seemed to beat throughout his entire body.
He had to shake his head minutely, reminding himself to get away and get to class – shit! He had class!! – before this would get any more awkward.
“Awesome,” Gracie replied with a wide grin. “I got your postcard from Lisbon. Really looks amazing there. Where do you like it more?”
As they got dressed, Cas suddenly looked up, as if just remembering something, and then looked at Dean, wide-eyed. “Dean, there are no direct flights from Hartford to New York.”
But there was no use in prolonging it, no way of getting out of it this time unless he decided to be outright rude to the man. And that might not even stop him because Michael was a determined person.
Without interrupting him, Cas leaned up and kissed the tear away that Dean had tried and failed to blink back. In return, Dean hugged him closer, giving himself a moment to calm down.
Grace didn’t reply right away and as Dean leaned back and caught her gaze again, his heart clenched in pain. Fresh tears filled her eyes.
But apparently, Gracie seemed to like Cas. And, well, Cas didn’t look like he wanted to run away. At least not from Grace. He had even confided in her that he knew her favorite author. They’d … bonded? That was …
A moment later, Cas’ eyes found his again. It was clear as day that Dean’s grin aggravated him even further, as his eyes narrowed at Dean.
“That the feelings you had for Lisa were different from the ones you have – and always had – for Cas.”
By some miracle, they were able to keep it together enough until they were through the sidedoor, the one that led into the alley right next to the bookshop, their laughter breaking free the moment they were outside. It echoed from the walls of the small alley, shaking them both as they tried to catch their breath.
Instinctively, he grabbed Cas’ hand and pulled him up, dragging him with him as they bolted from the theater as fast as they could. More popcorn was thrown after them, a few curse words and grumbles from patrons as well, but Dean didn’t care.
Together, they settled at the kitchen island, and while they all tucked in, Gracie easily took over the conversation, Dean content to simply watch his little family, enjoying the moment with a smile so wide he was sure his cheeks were going to split soon. He didn't care, though.
Damn, he’d been sure he’d been specific enough. As quietly as he could, he whispered: “The thing with Charlie.”
The shower after his workout was much needed and Dean was pleased to find he actually felt a little calmer. Maybe it was mere exhaustion with what little sleep he had last night and all the emotional rollercoasters he had been on lately. But he didn’t really care. He would take it and be glad for the numbness in his mind.
As he moved to lean on his elbows, Cas sat up further, giving him space. Space that Dean neither wanted nor needed so he reached for him, holding him close by the elbow, not letting go, tethering them together. He might be imagining it, but Cas seemed to relax into the touch.
“I am sorry that you think that way,” he spat out. “I can assure you that is not the reason for my friendship with Eileen or Grace.”
As he moved to the car, he heard the festivities at the Christmas fair again. Thinking about it for a second, he remembered the candy stall and their roasted almonds, one of Gracie’s favorites. Making a split decision, he tossed his bag with the used sports clothes into the truck and got his wallet out.
He was finally filled with bliss again, surrounded by happiness and love that he would never let go of. As their eyes met, Dean knew that Cas not only felt the same but was fully on board with those plans. Their hands met on top of the table, fingers intertwining as if they had done this a thousand times before. And maybe that wasn’t the case yet but Dean would make damn sure that soon it would be.
Not questioning it further, Cas turned around in search of Zar, who was apparently busy searching the wings section… there was a freaking wings section? Shaking his head, Cas sighed, and simply resigned himself to his fate. As it seemed, they were going as angels this year.
Dean was thankful they had a close and warm relationship and no issues like some other people might have with their in-laws - apart from the customary “so you’re dating my daughter” speech from Harry all those years ago, Dean’s relationship with them both had always been wonderful. So much so, that he often thought of them as his own parents, even after Lisa’s death.
“Now, that’s as much as I have to say to this. Make your two questions count - but remember, I can always refuse to answer.”
He was. He really, seriously was. He wished that, for once, Cas would relax around him and they could have a normal conversation. Just for once, and not just because of what Dean had finally figured out and admitted to himself.
While his thoughts were still in scrambles and lit on fire, there were only a few clear thoughts Dean could focus on right now.
Where had Cas gone? What was he doing? Was he actually driving? He really shouldn’t be fucking driving. Not in his emotional state!!
Reading the word on his skin was so surreal, Dean stared for a second longer, even after the text had already vanished. Getting his bearings together, he quickly wrote another message.
For the flash of a moment, he thought back to thirteen years ago. Was this how Cas had felt? Had he been hurting like this? If so, then Dean definitely hated himself even more.
“You will,” Dean promised. “He’s moving back to Stars Hollow for the time being so I’m sure there’ll be plenty of opportunities for you to torture him.”
By the eager way Cas kissed him back after that, reaching for Dean’s shirt and pulling him close, Dean took it to mean no further explanation was needed. A moment later though, the kiss got interrupted by Cas’ wide grin.
Huffing a little laugh and pressing one last chaste kiss to the side of Cas’ mouth, Dean stepped back. Cas quickly filled the waiting plate with bacon while Dean prepared them both two mugs of coffee.
Dean reciprocated in kind, squeezing Cas’ hand back. “I know.” Thinking better of it, he pulled Cas into his embrace and pressed a lingering kiss to his temple. “And just to be clear, I’m very much looking forward to also being with you in the real world.”
His little pumpkin looked amazing in her crimson dress, like a true princess, her smile wide, her eyes shining, and –
Taking a deep breath, Dean waved towards Caesar, the chef of the diner, because Luke was nowhere to be seen, before giving his answer.
journey with Lumberjack Cookies will finally come to an end this Sunday... I kinda wanna use a crying emoji but also a laughing one and maybe a somewhat crazed-out one... I'm not sure yet which one it will be on Sunday 😂 guess we'll find out. Until then, take a breath, eat a cookie, and maybe come find me on
That’s as far as he got before the words were suddenly stuck in his throat, all breath leaving him. While he had whispered to Sam, his eyes had wandered back a few rows and had landed on familiar dark and unruly hair, making him stop in his tracks. The moment blue eyes landed on him, time froze.
Only when his daughter stopped was he finally able to rip his gaze from Cas, the sudden despair in his daughter’s voice alarming him. Wide-eyed, she looked at Cas, one of her hands clapped over her mouth – her typical tell when she’d said something she shouldn’t have. Before Dean could even ask what was wrong, she went on, speaking to Cas directly. “I’m so sorry. That was supposed to be a secret.” Her head snapped back up at him, her eyes pleading. “Dad, you can’t tell anyone, I promised Castiel.”
Chuckling, Dean promised that the threat was unnecessary and put his phone away, enjoying the quiet family time. Harry was sitting on the couch, reading various newspapers, and Bobby sat in his favorite recliner, reading some car magazine.
love Lisa and it's a topic of the conversation towards the end. If you don't like it, I understand - but please don't bash on her character or Dean's feelings for her. After all, she was a huge part of his life and she is still Gracie's mom 💚
“Don’t be such a baby, Winchester,” he mumbled to himself, finally selecting a video that looked promising. ‘
“Pumpkin,” he began, interrupting himself to swallow and clear his throat. “Gracie, I… thank you, okay? Thank you. For… for your words, for your trust. For this,” he added and held up her papers again. “But… there- there are things- I mean… sometimes, life doesn’t go as we would wish.”
“And then the whole scenery changed and you and me, we were in some kind of library. And... we were just together, you know? You were sitting at a table and I was leaning next to you and we were talking about books again. And there was a plate of Angel Cookies –” and Dean had known that part would pull a smile from Cas, “– and I don’t even know anymore what we talked about or if we talked at all. I just remember this feeling I had.” Remembering it now sent the same warmth all through Dean and he smiled at Cas as he told him. “I was so content and happy and... I know I was
There certainly were enough guys around him at the moment, and Dean hoped no one would notice his ears burning up as he suddenly looked at them with different eyes.
“Yeah, they are,” Dean agreed, once again brushing her wild hair away from her forehead, leaving a kiss there. “So show me you can be a good girl and get some sleep and you
While his original plan was to study for the rest of the day, that plan soon was erased for something far more important.
“Of course,” he whispered into Cas’ ear, lightly grazing his teeth over the shell of it while answering the question.
Like a horde of hungry wolves, everyone reached for the plates as Amara put them down on the table. Everyone except for Dean and Cas, because Gracie had stepped right up to them, offering her own plate. Disentangling their hands from beneath the blankets, they both took one of the sugary treats and Dean’s heart warmed when he saw a big smile light up Gracie’s whole face even further, her eyes solely on Cas. He watched his daughter watch Cas and Dean could see just how much she was waiting for his approval once more. Instead of eating his own cookie, Dean watched his boyfriend as well.
His warm release coating his stomach…  Cas’ hand still working, the near overstimulation of his spent cock…
Cas stared right back, looking equally shocked and amazed – until a wide grin spread over his entire face. “Hello, Dean.”
The tone was full of warning and sometimes Dean wondered if these two got up to kinky stuff with Jo as a dom. She would make a perfect dom.
“That’s true, yes,” she replied, and Dean felt her arms circling around his left arm as she practically latched onto him, leaning uncomfortably into his space.
For a second, Dean thought about tucking her in – but with a new foal around and Cas’ draft by her side, there was no way she would go to sleep right away. Oh well, it was Christmas after all, and it wasn’t as if he allowed exceptions like this every day. Besides, he was sure once her excitement calmed down she was going to crash hard.
A very Happy Birthday to our dear Dean Winchester 🎉 I thought it was the perfect day to post the next chapter - especially since there will be somewhat of a gift for him in this... or maybe two? I'm not sure, up to your interpretation I guess 😁
, Dean finally stopped his revolving train of thought. No, it simply didn’t make any sense to think about what if’s and maybe’s. Not until he had a chance to talk to Cas. He prayed he would get that chance. Prayed that Cas really didn’t hate or even just resent him. That he had simply been pissed.
Sighing, Dean folded the piece of paper, adding it to the stack with the envelope and the DVD. Not feeling good about just letting it lie around like this – not that anyone would just come into his office, but still – he pulled out one of the bigger envelopes and put everything inside, sealing it shut. The sooner he would forget about this, the better.
Halting for just a moment, Dean nodded. “Of course. As long as you know you always have people around you who are here to help you, I’m happy.”
“Don’t you think that’s more because there wasn’t such a mass of books back then as there is today?”
“It’s no big deal, really,” Dean argued, ignoring Charlie. “I don’t even know what you’re talking about.”
“Yeah. This is more than I ever thought you would admit, so guess I’ll just count it as a good start.”
“I thought after it was my fault you couldn’t watch the end of it on Thursday… you know, me not respecting the classics and all that…”
“Your aunt said something about cookies?” he explained, relieved that his voice sounded normal. “Know where she keeps them? I offered to bring them out.”
They said their goodbyes and Dean was relieved when he could slip his other hand into his pocket as well. Minutes later, he reached the café and sighed when the warmth engulfed him. Giving himself a second to lose the chill, he watched the scene in front of him.
Which was one of the reasons he was able to keep himself from asking for Cas’ number. It would only stir up questions he was not willing to answer tonight.
His hands acted on their own, one sunk into Cas’ hair to gently hold him close, the other gripped his hip as he pushed further into Cas. Dean knew he was caging him in again, but this time, Cas didn’t seem to mind. Not at all. It was all he needed to let the kiss grow deeper and Cas was right there with him, kissing back just as eager. There was heat and hunger between them and Dean didn’t even try to analyze it. He simply took it in, living in this very moment and praying that it would never end.
“You said Lisa’s name in your sleep.” Cas’ voice was so low, nothing more than a feeble whisper. But Dean was close enough to catch it anyway, the words surprising him. And Cas wasn’t even done yet. “Twice, actually, looking so content and blissful. It just... scared me. It brought back all my fears, this fact that you would dream of her when I was by your side.”
“Morning,” he greeted, as he pulled up a chair to the table the judges had gathered around. “How’s everyone doing?”
“I … I don’t know, actually.” Which honestly wasn’t even a lie. He was … confused. Yeah, confused. More than anything.
For that, Gracie earned herself a poke in the shoulder which only made her chuckle. “Ouch. Thanks for the confidence boost, Munchkin. Anyway, I should get going. You okay now?”
During dinner, Cas had actually sat next to him and they had spent the whole course discussing various authors, their good and their bad aspects and Cas had thrown one name at Dean after another. With some, he had to admit Cas was driving a hard bargain - but Dean would always and adamantly stay on his point that Vonnegut beat all of them.
Dean took a moment to compose his reply. Truthfully, he was somewhat blindsided. He had suspected her to want to talk about his feelings for Cas again. But this? It was unexpected and he had no idea what to make of it.
When the trembling slowly subsided, Dean gently let the kiss come to an end, pulling away just far enough for the both of them to breathe again, panting hard as they both gasped for air. Dean was about to ask how Cas felt when the hold around him grew stronger, Cas hugging him impossible closer, practically clinging to him, and Dean was sure he had his answer. Cas’ eyes were closed and he looked so blissfully and thoroughly fucked out… it was a wonderful picture that Dean wanted to see over and over again.
Eileen got up the moment she saw him, brushing a hand over Grace’s hair and pressing a kiss to her forehead. As she passed him by the door, she hugged him close, just like Sam had. In contrast to his brother though, she cupped his face in one of her small hands after pulling back, looking up at him with sincere eyes.
And it really was. The leather-bound notebook was Gracie’s favorite teal-color, imprinted with a girl holding a heart-shaped balloon on its cover. Gracie traced it with her fingers before quickly untying the strings that held the journal closed, opening it to the first page.
He could feel Cas tense as he touched his arm but that didn’t stop Dean from pulling so he could slowly turn the man around.
Instantly, relief washed over him. Before he could reply, however, he heard the crunching of snow under shoes, the shadowy figure quickly moving away from him.
There were so many questions, questions Dean didn’t have answers for. Did Cas still hate him? Did he have a partner back home? Did he maybe still like Dean? Did
Despite the many helping hands, it still took some time to put all the dishes in the sink or directly in the dishwasher, to wrap up all the leftovers and store them, and to wipe clean the tables so the dining room was left in a semi-orderly state.
Basking in the feeling of the moment, Dean began to softly sway them while he thought this through. When Gabe already called out that it was close, Dean was struck by an idea, the smile forming on his lips inevitable. “I know, how about this,” he murmured into Cas’ ear. “You’re not allowed to leave Stars Hollow until you find a better author than Vonnegut. No running away from me ever again.”
With the way the rest of the day had gone; Dean was now hoping for the best. Cas hadn’t avoided eye contact and one might even say they had shared a laugh or two. All the more reason for Dean not to turn into stalker mode right now.
Calming his beating heart, Dean turned the second popcorn bucket towards Cas, hoping that the invitation was clear enough. Cas seemed hesitant at first - not a good sign, right? - but took a handful after all. Dean couldn’t be sure but the man seemed to relax and enjoy the movie and therefore, Dean did the same.
“Open the other,” Gracie told him and Dean quickly complied, bringing to light a second dragon, this one painted in different shades of blue. “They are bookends,” she explained excitedly while Dean was still unable to take his eyes off the artfully crafted dragons in his hand. Now that he knew what they were meant to be, it made sense they were heavier than they looked. “And while they will take care of your books, they’ll also have somewhere to live in peace.”
Instantly, Cas’ arm flew away from his eyes, hands digging into the bedding while his eyes were wide open, staring straight at Dean – who couldn’t help but try to throw him a mischievous smile and even a wink as he hollowed his cheeks, slowly dragging his lips up and down.
“Whoa, whoa, calm down, Cherry,” he soothed her, patting her neck once he had her under control again. “What’s wrong baby?”
Dean knew he was the last student for their first shift, but before he could join the rest behind the table to sell cookies, he pulled the boy aside.
– now that’s a lot of pies and sweets, Gabriel,” Taylor added, turning back to Gabe and just like the rest, Dean couldn’t keep in his laughter at seeing his friend pouting. “And the winning snowman is … The Lumberjack Snowman from Gracie Winchester and Castiel James.”
“Yeah well… doesn’t really matter anymore, now does it?” Dean replied, trying to push away his bitterness and knowing he didn’t succeed.
“Come on guys,” he finally added with a sigh. “I’m not gonna bite your heads off. I apologized for last week, haven’t I?” When some of them nodded, he went on. “Well? Shouldn’t we be back to being open with each other? Fess up. What’s gotten into you today?”
Yeah, it was a dumb thing to say, as he could clearly see that Gracie was working on some homework and Cas was typing away on his laptop – but hey, no one ever said he was original with his jokes.
The moment he let go, Cas turned around and moved back into the kitchen. As if on autopilot, Dean called out to Bart that he was alright before he followed Cas. It was probably stupid, but he simply couldn’t stay away from the man right at this moment.
Thankfully, the rest of the morning did not leave much time for Dean to ponder about Cas. Once he got dressed, he started to whip up some pancakes and as if they had been summoned by it, Sam and Eileen showed up, followed shortly after by a still sleepy Grace. Without a word, she moved to her room and only came back when Dean called out that her pancakes were getting cold. She had changed into her fluffiest pajamas and Dean saw no reason to tell her to put on real clothes. It was the holidays, after all.
Folding the letter without reading even one word, he handed the piece of paper back to Ava. Hesitantly, she reached for it, looking back at him when he didn’t let go right away. “Next time, at least be a bit more subtle.”
The feeling in Dean’s chest after this fight with his friends, the two women he saw as his little sisters, was terrible. He hated fighting with them in the first place but doing it while they were thousands of miles away from him and their conversations so rare, it hurt even more.
Just like a week ago, he knew it should be different; knew he had fallen asleep with Cas in his arms, and yet – there was no trace of him now.
God, in hindsight, it made so much sense to Dean; it made sense that Cas would accuse him of that. He had been a fool – but he also hadn’t known how else to handle it.
; a huge step in his eyes. Monday had Cas smiling at him freely - only to be hurt so badly in an accident the next day that despite Cas’ insistence to the contrary, Dean still felt at fault. He had scared the man or just distracted him - either way; Dean was the reason Cas had tumbled down that hill.
“Welcome, all my friends of Stars Hollow,” the voice of Taylor Doose boomed through the microphone, interrupting Dean’s thoughts and making him wince before he turned his focus back towards the stage. “On this fine Friday evening, we’re opening this year’s Stars Hollow Winter Fair. I know it’s a bit earlier than previous years, but you’ll see that it will do the town good to have this here for the whole of December!”
“Right,” he said in her direction, before saluting his students. They seemed to have caught onto… well, whatever it was that was going on, and they gave him questioning looks. “You all have a great start to the New Year. See you in a few days.”
Cas took Dean’s other hand in his, squeezing a liberal amount of lube onto both of their hands before guiding Dean’s to his back; closing his eyes as the first finger sank into him. The bottle dropped from his hand as he leaned down again, pressing his ass into the touch as Dean caught his lips again with his own, kissing him as if he was the first sip of water after a walk through the desert.
“Yes!” Gracie exclaimed, pointing to the pile she had already opened before turning back to look at him.
Instead of mulling over it, Dean quickly racked his brain, trying to remember what it was Kirk was showing tonight at the theater… and if he wasn’t mistaken,
Shaking of all his emotions and shoving them deep, deep down. Dean took a shaky breath and made his way back to the fundraiser. He was so fucking numb - but he had to behave. Had to be there for his students. For his daughter, who looked at him expectantly and for whom he was able to plaster a smile on his face. Reassuring her that Cas simply didn’t feel well and needed to get home.
Jo’s eyes grew wide just five seconds later, her gaze instantly fixed on Dean. He looked back stoically, willing her not to say anything while Gracie was still here. Thankfully, his friend got the message, turning her attention back to Gracie.
General agreement all around the room was his answer, the loudest coming from the kids’ table, and before Dean could even react, Cas was out of his seat and grabbed the dishes closest to him to carry them towards the kitchen. Watching his retreating back, Dean pulled himself together quickly, no desire at all to let this small set-back dampen his mood. Or worse yet, the whole day.
Dean wasn’t quite sure if his glare was still playful or maybe a tad real - seriously, no one was allowed to say anything against the classics - yet Cas’ cheeky grin never wavered and after a moment, Dean couldn’t help it anymore. His façade broke and the grin spread wide.
It was still dark when Dean drifted to reality, his senses slowly waking up. First, he could smell the wonderful fragrance he had come to associate with happiness and feeling warm and content. It wasn’t just the smell that gave him those feels now. As his mind woke up further, he sensed the body next to him and the warmth of a soft bed.
“Dean, I assure you: it won’t sound stupid. It was a dream and it seems important to you, so it’s alright,” he reassured him, pressing a kiss to his shoulder. “And like I said, you don’t have to tell me.”
“Wait, what?” Cas spoke up, but Dean was happy to see Luke ignoring him, listening to Dean’s request. Which led to Cas trying to argue with Dean instead: “Mr. Winchester, that’s not –”
It felt like forever until the man finally seemed to have enough of catching up with Dean, leaving with a vague, ‘see you around,’ and Dean was finally able to breathe normally again. Eager to get back to Cas - and maybe even to what they were about to do - he turned back around.
,” she told him with a wide smile, getting up on her legs and bouncing on her bed before jumping into his arms again, her arms winding around his neck as he quickly caught her so she wouldn’t hurt herself. “And I know you’re proud that I inherited your cheekiness.”
And yeah, sure. Since Cas already offered, Dean certainly wasn’t going to move from this warm, fluffy bed. Especially not when it smelled of Cas and sex.
It was enough to keep Dean’s mind more than occupied. It was a wonder he was even able to teach, but luckily his students didn’t seem to notice his distraction.
With a single click of his tongue, Cherry was moving and Dean left all his troubled thoughts on the ranch as he let her fly through the winter wonderland.
He turned Cherry around to head toward the city, pleased when Cas finally did as he had told him and grabbed on to Cherry’s mane.
Sure that he could have drifted off just like this, with Cas spread out over him and hugged close, it was the rumble of soft laughter that pulled him back to reality.
They were silent again as their gazes wandered over the ranch, up to the horizon. Somewhere in that direction lay New York. Somewhere over the horizon, Cas was back home, probably settling back into his normal life.
Sometimes, it was a really bad thing to have friends that knew one so well. Sighing, Dean looked over his shoulder in the direction of the hallway. It was still quiet, no sign of his daughter. Should he really do this?
This time, it was Dean who could reply only with a nod. He wanted to comment, wanted to push, wanted to say something. Instead, he pushed himself off the doorframe and walked over to the railing, looking out over the garden. It was beautiful - he had always loved the Shurley estate - but today, he was unable to really focus on it.
Watching his daughter, Dean couldn’t tame the proud feeling rising in his chest. With a smile, he pulled her into a one-armed side-hug. “I’ve raised you right.”
He hadn’t even realized how completely silent it had gone all around them, but he didn’t care. He was furious and the only reason he hadn’t already exploded was his daughter pressed against him. But it didn’t keep him from snapping at the women.
Rushing over to his discarded coat and digging around frantically, he pulled out his phone at last, answering right away and putting it to his ear.
There was no reply from Grace, just a click and then the dial tone. Dean didn’t hesitate, discarding the phone and hugging Cas close again as he leaned back in, his lips hungrily seeking out the soft skin of Cas’ neck once more. How long they stood like this, he couldn’t tell, but Cas’ breathing became heavier by the minute and it only egged Dean on. He shamelessly pressed his ever-growing erection against Cas, reveling in the knowledge that he was obviously driving him insane in the best way possible.
To his surprise, Cas shook his head and clarified, “Hard to believe I’m one of these fortunate people.”
Dean had to squint a little to catch all of the small scribbles on his forearm, almost missing when the lights turned green again. He had to chuckle at the rambling that was so atypical for C – unless his soulmate was drunk. Seriously, those times were always hilarious. But usually, C liked to write straight to the point. Seemed they were really nervous about this interview.
Once more, he cleared his throat, before finally forcing it out. “How did it start? For you, I mean.”
When Cas nodded silently, Dean got himself a chair and put it at the front side of the small table, facing the window. This was it. This was the chance he’d wanted. And he wasn’t solely talking about the “being close to Cas in general”-part. Because this table was way too small and –
Just like always, the cold early morning air was able to calm his thoughts. Maybe he should start sleeping outside for the duration of Cas' stay. Within minutes, Dean was leaving the ranch behind him and on his way towards the lake, one of his favorite areas. He usually tried to take another route during winter or at least while it was still dark. There were some tricky parts on this path, like the lake on one side, and for a short while also a slope that he had no desire to tumble down. Today though, he needed the scenery of his favorite path. Not that he could see all that much in the dark but that was neither here nor there. It was the old familiarity that he craved and here, he didn't feel like his thoughts were running a mile a minute. He was finally able to keep his mind occupied otherwise.
When Cas showed first signs of wakefulness, Dean grew bolder. He let his hand wander further down, pushing away the blankets in the process. Cas’ ass was a sight to behold and as Dean gently squeezed one of his perfect globes, a sleepy moan left Cas. Without fully waking, the man moved, turning around. One arm landed over his eyes as if to keep reality out for a while longer.
Wordlessly, Gracie crawled into his lap and Dean cuddled her close, hugging her as the video call continued. While their friends kept gushing about Paris, Dean could actually see it.
Dean had to agree with Eileen when she looked Cas in the eyes and nodded in understanding. “It fits you,” she stated, making Dean wish Cas would look back at him so he could see those blue eyes once more.
In hindsight, Dean couldn’t tell how he had managed to get home in time to get ready for dinner. His thoughts had circled around this one little instance. Had Cas only called him by his first name so he would let him go? Or was the ice finally broken? God, he would hate it so much if after this he would have to hear
“No, Michael, stop. Okay? Just… stop,” he begged his friend. “I never wanted this to come between us, so please… just…”
Smiling at his brother’s comment, Dean stopped the teasing. “I know. But it’s actually not necessary. She … uh … she already found someone.”
Dean was about to make a mocking reply when someone bumped right into him, knocking him against Michael.
It didn’t take much coaxing for Cas to collapse onto him, head buried in the crook of Dean’s neck, hot breath ghosting over Dean’s skin while they both tried to get their breathing under control.
After a while, he was finally ready to open his eyes, a dopey smile spreading over his lips as he blinked the sleep away and stretched in the luxurious linen. Cas’ bed was amazing.
Second, the discussion with the pizza wasn't ever planned originally... but thanks to the comments from some of my lovely readers, I was educated about the sacredness of true New York Pizza 😅 so I hope this little tidbit made up for my faux-pas. It also turned out to be a wonderful catalyst for that part of their conversation, so thank you for that 😘
Starting today, look forward to a daily update for the rest of the year, each taking us back to Stars Hollow and Dean, Cas, and Gracie. We'll start off with the next three chapters of our tale... then take a momentary jump into their happy future with five fluffy (and sometimes sexy) timestamps - each of them fulfilling one of the prompts given by you, my dear readers 💖
his shirt and touched his skin that Dean came back to his senses, even if just a little bit. Because Cas’ hands were icy cold and Dean couldn’t stop the natural reflex to jerk away from them.
“Of course not.” Suddenly, Cas grinned at Gracie and even winked, completely confusing Dean when he told her, “You’re still a kid after all.”
He had to ask. He simply had to because his tired brain – that part that was still cuddled up in a warm bed with the love of his life – simply refused to make the obvious connection.
He got on his path towards the lake just on time, a smile stealing itself on his lips at the prospect of meeting Cas. Not that he would be able to see him. Or really talk to him. Or that Cas would suddenly like him again.
As well as the slight nod towards Cas as Michael gently pushed him inside before closing the door behind him.
Lifting Gracie, he held her in his arms – not an easy task with how tall she’d gotten, but he still managed, especially because she was clinging to him like a koala bear.
Remembering the conversation with Cas hurt so much, but there was one thing he let himself focus on.
Once again, he forgot how well they knew him and after a silent breakfast, Eileen took Gracie’s hand and let her lead them to the stables while Sam practically pushed Dean out the door.
It wasn’t really the argument, it was more the way Taylor said these things when he really wanted something. He had a way of making the other person feel guilty if they didn’t immediately jumped in and agreed to everything. Thankfully, Dean was usually immune to this.
His lover made a noise to show he had heard him but otherwise didn’t bother to move his head from where it rested on Dean’s chest.
Careful not to get too close to the shitty parked car next to him, Dean made sure to push all thoughts of Cas aside. Tonight was a night to celebrate Gracie being back on her feet – quite literally. He would have to face his old friend soon enough, so no reason to ruin this night with all the weird thoughts Cas’ presence had put into his mind.
That was a novelty if he had ever seen one, but hey. He certainly wasn’t one to look a gift horse in the mouth, right? So instead of questioning his luck about Gracie being distracted, he fully enjoyed the extended family time.
Kissing her head, Dean pulled her a tad closer. “Apology accepted, then. And it looks like you found a good replacement.”
Getting up, Dean made his way to the kitchen to get himself a glass of water. For a while, he just stood there, sipped the water, and watched his reflection in the dark window. The tiredness in his bones was heavy, but his mind was too awake to get back to sleep. Dean hated this state.
- to bring a stop to this right away. Because his own feelings about the whole situation were still very much too raw and he feared that any conversation about the topic would bring them back up.
Not when there were moments in which Dean found those mesmerizing eyes on himself, unguarded for just the shortest of heartbeats, gazing at him as if Dean was still the only one for him.
“It was the most boring book ever. I feel like that hobbit walked through the woods for over a hundred pages. But the books from C. S. James? I can’t put those down!” she concluded with a sweet smirk. “So, definitely no question about who the better author is.”
All that kept visible of his name was the first letter and even though Dean had known this would happen, he was still a little disappointed by it.
That got a real smile out of the boy. “No problem, Mr. Winchester. Guess sometimes even adults don’t have their shit together, right?”
Instead, they enjoyed two short, turbulent weeks; until one late evening, Dean couldn’t take it anymore. This nagging inside of him wouldn’t stop. The voice that told him that something was wrong. That while Cassie was amazing, really, she simply wasn’t the one for him.
Dean tried his best to clean his boots before stepping onto the carpet but even then, it felt wrong to step foot on it. Swallowing, he nodded to the young guy opening the door for him and then stepped inside, looking around.
. Dean would never say it out loud, but the fact that his little girl still wanted to watch these kids’ movies made him extremely happy. At two,
Cas’ question barely reached him but Dean still shook his head ‘no’. He had already closed his eyes and simply enjoyed the moment – only vaguely remembering that maybe, he should be fully honest here.
“It’s the cookies, okay!” Cas suddenly yelled and with one swift move, he ripped his arm away from Dean’s hold, even taking a step back to put some space between them.
Briefly turning towards Grace, Taylor looked like he meant it when he said, “I’m really sorry about this. But –” Dean was sure he knew what was coming when Taylor focused back on him with an apologetic, yet firm expression. “Within the teachers of Stars Hollow, you’re next on the list. It would have been your turn next year anyway.”
Luke nodded and as he stood in the open door, he seemed to carefully think about his next words before he spoke them. “Look, Dean. I don’t know what caused him to leave all of a sudden. And it’s certainly not my business. But I’m not the only one who has seen the impact that man had on Grace. Or on you, to be honest. I haven’t seen either of you so carefree, not like you’ve been these past few days, in a long while. So whatever it is or was, I really hope you’ll figure it out. For all of you.”
Dean could feel the tension leaving his bones somewhat, now that he started to get full sentences again. The handwriting was still a bit shaky but he imagined that C was simply still weak. Yawning loudly, he pulled himself up into a sitting position, leaning over his arm to continue writing.
In the end, they ordered some burgers and fries, creating a picnic of sorts on the floor of Cas’ living room just because. And any attempts of Cas’ to explain to Dean the reason why New York burgers were so much better than any other burgers was soon interrupted by Dean pushing him back to the floor, covering his body in kisses until Cas had lost all concentration or coherent thought.
Shaking his head, Dean got himself out of this bizarre moment. Why would it matter if Cas had seen him or not or if he’d chosen to ignore him? It didn’t.
. Dean decided to get some popcorn for all of them, not even letting himself be deterred from the long line. The movie had already started once he joined his friends again, handing one full bucket of popcorn to Gabriel and kept the other while sitting down next to Cas. Why his daughter had decided to switch places, he had no idea but he would certainly seize the opportunity.
“Yeah,” he agreed, finally putting into words what he feared the most. “But you’re here right now and I’m not risking you running away. Not again, Cas. Not ever again.”
Nodding to himself, he pushed away from the railing and took the few steps towards the door. But within these mere few yards, Dean made a decision. His hand already on the door to slide it open, he stopped and sighed. He would give himself one last try.
Having been a teacher for over thirteen years now, Dean had become a pretty good actor in front of his classroom. It was necessary to survive in the wilderness that was working with twenty plus kids every hour of a school day. Keeping a neutral face, keeping a
“What is happening with me, Lis?” he whispered, trying to find an answer to this confusing situation. “Why can’t I stop thinking about him? Why do I dream about him?”
The dream itself was still hazy and Dean would need to sit down and really think to recall it all. But that part he knew for sure. Lisa had looked like an angel, serene and at peace. And that was all he had ever hoped she would be now. Thinking of that, the muscles of his cheeks flickered just a bit. Certainly, that could count as a smile?
“Good morning indeed,” Dean mumbled back, stretching his arms out before resting his head on one of them and catching Cas’ gaze. Yes, this was exactly how he wanted to wake up every morning from now on, for the rest of his life. With Cas kissing him awake, eyes sparkling, hair tousled, still covered in the love bites Dean left all over his body the previous night. And a promise that this morning was going to start just as the night had ended. “Don’t stop on my account,” he told Cas with a lascivious grin.
They could probably have picked a better time to start their journey, but it was what it was. And Cas didn’t seem phased by it at all, so Dean didn’t let himself overthink it as he simply shrugged his shoulders. “She loves you. She wanted for me to make this right so…”
There was no reply from Grace, which was her way to give in when she didn’t like it. With a heavy heart, Dean looked back at Taylor and nodded. “Alright, you win. Count me in.”
Despite his initial plans to ignore them, it didn’t take long for him to notice that this was a different kind of tension. A different kind of giggles and whispers and tittering. Call him paranoid, but he was sure most of his students were eyeing him in a way that did not bode well. Not condescending, thank God, but somehow... curious, maybe? Amused? Intrigued?
“Definitely, yes. To both. So let’s continue like that, shall we?” His eyes were staring right at Dean’s as he asked, “Dean, what is this for you?”
Getting up, Dean put the phone into his jeans pocket and went back inside, quietly closing the door just in case Grace was already asleep. Seeing the faint glow of light from under her door, however, told him that it wasn’t the case. Grinning, he took off his boots and hung up his jacket before tiptoeing over to the hallway and to Gracie’s room, not bothering with any light. He listened for a moment, before suddenly opening the door.
If that wasn’t enough already, she also beamed at him when he introduced himself as Dean – the kind of happiness that told him without words that her soulmate’s name also started with a D.
But he had forbidden them to be saddened by it, never one to grieve and instead celebrate the life he had. Therefore, they had all stoved away their feelings about the looming death and instead made sure to fulfill his last wish of a perfect Christmas time together.
,” Dean explained, taking a deep breath before he spoke his rehearsed words. “I just got Cas’ friendship back – at least I think so. I’m certainly not gonna jeopardize that by opening old wounds. He’s moved on, he’s happy in New York-“
One after another, the students showed up and handed over their cookies, some of them staying for the first shift, others moving along to spend some time at
“I swear, I didn’t give away any names, not even an address. But, Daddy, I couldn’t have known he was an old friend of yours and just happened to show up here a few weeks later, right? I’m really sorry, it was- it was an accident or something like that. Please don’t be mad.”
“Alright,” he told her, already moving over to his closet to get some fresh clothes out. “Lemme get dressed, then I’ll figure out how to bribe one of your uncles into telling me where their brother lives.”
Gracie’s yell was loud enough to make Dean’s ear bleed - he was sure it would, one of these days - and some heads turn to look in their direction but really, no one minded. It surely wasn’t the only time such yells of joy had been heard in the arrival hall of the airport in Hartford. Gracie was in her Grandpa Harry’s arms within seconds of him clearing the line, leaning over to hug her Grandma Alice as well. Meanwhile, Dean stood back, watching the scene with a wide smile on his face.
Once again, Dean was at a loss for words. Thankfully, it seemed his answer wasn’t needed as Amara stepped closer and handed him a folded paper.
“Cas? As in… Castiel Shurley?” Alice asked, leaning forward in her seat next to Gracie, probably to catch Dean’s answer.
And now here he was, a stranger eliciting such a reaction from him. Awakening feelings he hadn’t thought possible.
Complying to Cas’ wish, Dean soon let go of him, both stepping out of their shoes before Dean reached for Cas’ tie, never breaking eye contact, never taming his grin as he walked backwards and further into the house; down the hallway and right up to his bedroom; pulling Cas along the whole way, never once under the impression that Cas needed much coaxing.
, and was pretty sure Michael wouldn’t see a single cent of that money. When the men came to the stage, he shook their hands, clapping Michael on the shoulder.
“You sure?” Dean asked, balancing the weirdly shaped and heavy gift in his hands as he waited for her confirmation.
Dean winced again. “Yeah,” he cleared his throat, “Yeah, first time in thirteen years. You know, because of Chuck and… and all that.”
“Fine,” Dean relented on a fake suffering sigh. “We’re more than good, we… we’re… yeah. We’re perfect.”
“No? Maybe? Honestly, I don’t care either way, I just finally want to find them. I know you and Jo already liked each other while writing, but… with C and me? I think it’s already more than just liking.”
“I mean, I’m old enough that I could’ve been your teacher… oh, wait a second,” he quipped, pretending to just remember a very important fact.
“I also never had any trouble drawing the line between friendship and just being a teacher with any of my other students. But with you… God, Cas, I had to force myself to call you
His ears were ringing and he was sure, so damn sure, that he had misheard. Why would Cas say that? Why–
With that, he put his glass down on a side table and made his way over to the kitchen. He had heard many stories about these cookies over the years, had heard the legends and how they were a family secret and tasted like heaven. So to say he was slightly intrigued was an understatement.
The short-lived peace was broken when they heard Sam’s car pull into the driveway. Dean took his time getting dressed. If he was sure about one thing, it was that he didn’t want to have this conversation with Eileen in his pajamas and it was a wonderful excuse to avoid it just a little longer.
Apparently, there had been a lot of doubts right from the beginning. Neither of them brought up the idea to put things to the test – namely, writing another message on their skin while watching each other. It simply wasn’t talked about, both of their arms staying blank.
