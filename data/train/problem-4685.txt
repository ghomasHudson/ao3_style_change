Dean looked at his scorecard finally. Yep, it did have five categories, Color, Aroma, Consistency, Taste, and Aftertaste. Great. This was like school. He sighed and made a note at the top reading ‘1 thru 10’.
Charlie placed napkins, tiny bowls with numbers, and scorecards next to each one.
“Cross myself? I only cross other people as a matter of habit.”
Dean didn’t want to be that guy tonight, but when Scott returned with several beers Dean took two and began to double fist them.
But the third time Dean mumbled out a ‘mm hmm’ in response to Sam going on and on about his classes or charity or something, he cleared his throat. “Look, Dean…”
His stomach fell so hard he almost choked. Well. Good for them. That’s what Dean wanted, wasn’t it?
He stood at the edge of the crowd uncertainly, wondering if the priest was here to call down brimstone and fire. Charlie’s voice sounded in the back of his head, ‘
Dean tilted his soda back and coughed, forgetting the watery dregs were all that was left. He could feel his leg jiggling nervously under the table, trying to remember what he had said about 'Mark' who was 'new' at the garage. “Yeah, who knew he’d be so needy? I mean, it’s not hard to stop blowing out headers is it?”
“Hey, I could remove those bits instead.” He poked at the angel’s side with the blade. “You should show me some respect.”
No, they hadn’t met each other after years and years of friendship, you crocodile. “Oh, uhh, they’ve met a few times. I think they think of each other like brother and sister though.”
“Hey, isn’t this your boyfriend?”
Jo blushed a bit and poked around her roast beef sandwich oozing with cheese and onions. “Good, good. I’ve been working a lot lately though, so hardly any fun time for me.”
To the far left were three men he did not recognize. One listened eagerly the whole time, a fresh-faced teenager. The other two were mature, late twenties or early thirties perhaps. One of the men had wavy hair to his shoulder, and the other had light brown hair cropped to about an inch or two.
As if drawn, his gaze went down to the Father watching him. He was late twenties at best, couldn't be any older than Dean himself. His dark hair looked rumpled as if someone had a great old time running their fingers through it.
He grinned back at his brother and took another huge bite. Should catch up to Cas at least, if nothing else to show he wasn’t a complete pansy.
like Dead Poet’s Society.”
The other man had a strange expression, one he usually didn’t see directed at him. “That does make sense. That makes total sense. I mean I liked your sermon, I really did. But that was real in a different way, you know?”
“Did you like it?”
“Drama queen.” Donnie left the back room as well to hang out in the party scene. Fine. Dean wanted to be alone anyway. Alone with his two beers, his silent phone, and his last scraps of dignity.
“I’m sorry about Sam.” Dean slid into the chair across from Cas and tried to figure out a good way to console the guy. Maybe he did or didn’t make a move, but wasn’t Sam interested? Why else did he keep inviting the other guy out? No, Sam admitted he liked him.
“I didn’t mean I was the one being hurt, sorry,” Dean murmured, lifting Castiel’s hand and wetting the palm with his tongue. “Next time, Cas, should I confess this?”
Cas lifted an eyebrow as he watched him take another long swig.
Oh no. He’d forgotten that for a guy in the same band as him, Benny had the shittiest taste in music ever. And sense of humour.
“That's it baby, talk cop to me. So hot.”
Shaking his head, he went jogging up the sidewalk when the sound of boyish yells broke the air. He stopped, looking one way and the other, then breaking into a run to his left.
A young man walked by just then, tall and clean cut with a friendly smile. He wasn’t wearing an uniform, but he had pressed pants. Pressed pants! “Sam, breakfast is in the kitchens.”
Dean held up a hand when Cas tried to hand it back. “Nope, the first person has to drink below the label. See, the neck is short, you’ll be fine.”
Messy black hair and that familiar white hoodie. Shame burned in his stomach as he devoured him with his eyes. It was safe, nobody was looking his way. The other guys were wearing white jackets and...and Sam was standing right next to Cas, laughing with his huge paw on the hoodied arm.
When they arrived at a nice set of dorms Dean was tapping his feet and drumming on his knees, the music was just turned down so low.
“Oh?” Dean had no idea where this was going and usually he could read people well.
Sam pulls out an epic ‘
“Dean certainly never has a problem showing interest.” Sam interjected dryly. “He just throws a wink and a grin their way and it’s done. I’ve never seen anyone love attention the way he does.”
Crowley nodded and looked around the large park and all the activity going on. “For future reference, it takes about two weeks to authorize a permit for the park.” He looked back at Dean with a strange smile.
Castiel licked his lips, glancing at the thin barrier between them.
He hadn’t realized how repetitive this all had become. Not to mention the number of people coming into confession had dwindled significantly from when he attended church as a boy. He wasn’t the only Father that had noticed there were no longer lines outside the booths.
He wasn’t joking.
“Amongst other types.”
“Oh.” Her mouth scrunched up before it smoothed in a smile. “That’s nice. Do you like it?”
Dean made a sound in the back of his throat, vibrating through his lips. “I didn’t expect to see anyone else like me when we came here. And it’s okay if you don’t forgive me yet. You will.”
She stuck out her bottom lip slightly. “All right. Thanks for all the help so far. We tried our best to get the place up and running.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The wound was still there, but old and crusty, the scab flicking off as it healed before his eyes.
He stuck to his fake childhood for the case, he was born in Morrison, Colorado and travelled with his father who was a travelling Minister. Dean took up the mantle when his father passed away.
“Yes.” He did wonder now. The other man didn’t sound unintelligent or defiant, but rather curious and thoughtful. Like this was all a puzzle that was a bit funny and challenging.
Because it was too
“I don’t think that’ll be a problem.” The guy, ‘Jeremiah’, laughed. “Good to know though.”
The closer it got to nine o’clock the less frequent Benny took smoke breaks and Dean slowed down on beer. He rarely overdid it, just enough to relax and be the growly vocal backup to Benny’s surprisingly rugged baritone.
Castiel took a total of three bites of the hamburger before steeling himself. He must speak candidly with Dean, but he also had to choose his words carefully.
“You guys did a great job.” He wasn’t lying when he said it. For the most part everything else was done well, the patched up spots were barely noticeable and the walls was painted and furniture was polished. He figured they couldn’t afford to hire someone with more technical skills at the time, no shame in that.
“Pastor Paxton!” She stopped at the curb, waiting for him to come around before shaking his hand with a firm grip. “Or should I call you that? I know you said you’re informal and we’ll be working together a lot, so.”
Dean washed his face and dried it, picking up the phone for the four steps it took to get to the bed. He was in a motel at the tail end of their last case, a hunt for college girl who ran away with a cult. To him this wasn’t much different, except it involved a kid.
“I thought you didn’t get out much.”
All he knew for sure was that Cas’ mouth was on his. His lips were softer than he thought a guy’s might be, a hint of barely-there stubble against his chin, the scent of honey and bite of alcohol filling his senses.
See, Cas was being honest at least. Dean nodded knowingly.
Good to know Dean was the only one thinking highly inappropriate things. He was feeling like such a damn cad right now. Sam could never know. Dean would be good, he’d toast their goddamn wedding and never breathe a word of it. “Yep.”
She paused, but her smile came back full force as she peeked in his car. “I think it’s amazing you were working down in Las Vegas, I think I mentioned that. Did you bring much? I’ll show you where you’ll be staying.”
“That’s deep. Okay, I take the Lord’s name in vain several times a week. Is that a good start?” The words rolled so easily off his tongue, as if this was a simple recitation the rules of a game.
He passed it to Cas after he sat down next to him.
It was nerve wracking. Evening fell and the ceremony was super long and super boring. Oh he clapped wildly for Cas, paying no mind to anyone else.
“You too, Priest.” He even gave a jaunty wave before turning around and leaving yet another establishment that wasn’t exactly welcoming.
“Did I do anything wrong?”
Dean sighed.
The dove white Welcome sign hung by two wooden posts with no civilization in sight yet, reading Welcome to Lebanon! Center of the United States!
Tucking his phone back in his pocket, he left the bathroom to hang out with Sam for a bit. Maybe they could play video games or shoot the breeze, whatever. Yeah, had to remember what was important.
“Absolution is to wipe away your sins in the eyes of God in accordance with your repentance. If you are truly sorry, forgiveness comes from the Sacrament I bestow and not myself.”
Castiel felt his hand being lowered. He did nothing as his wet palm stroked the rough folds of jeans, the zipper scraping lightly between his fingers. It felt nearly as hot as inside Dean’s mouth, but this, this made Dean groan.
But she wasn’t in her mother’s house to enjoy herself. She had to look for the will, as fruitless as it seemed. Grace and Lisa were tearing each other apart.
“Oh you’re good.” Crowley stood up to his paltry height and wandered closer, but not too close. “A real professional liar. So rare in this one streetlight town.”
Dean examined the chisel in his hand as he chipped out some old caulk. “I don’t remember now.”
“You know.” Bradford said, a lot closer than he was a moment ago. Dean turned and eyed the three feet between them.
He lugged his beat up laptop into the first place likely to have wifi, a Patt's Burgers, with hot fries and a spotty connection. He checked out the emails detailing it his name, Dean Paxton, brief history, and the details of the case.
“Hey, can’t he just travel forward in time and see the winner?” Dean joked as he tapped the last name. “Save us a lot of burnt tongues.”
“Hey bro, how many numbers did you score yesterday?” Gabe asked Cas, but his smirk was all for Dean.
“Handle’s too hot because you own cast iron pans.”
By the time Dean drove home, the sky was full of angry black clouds and rumbling ominously. It looked ready to dump some Old Testament hellfire down on the tiny town. He got inside and checked his sills and doorsteps. No more disturbances.
Dean’s gaze travelled to the round collar around the man’s neck with its white band. Oh. Oh. He felt frozen in place, between a wizened senior behind him and the frankly gorgeous man in front of him.
“We’re having a chili cook-off. Can I sign either of you up for the contest? I bet you two can cook up a fantastic meal.” He smiled at the two of them. Though he was invited in, neither seemed to remember to move back.
Dean looked at Sam...who was staring at his phone. He kicked him, frowning at his brother once they locked eyes. Dean flitted his eyes toward Cas pointedly.
Dean moved the top of his middle finger into his mouth, scalding the skin with a hard suck. “I’ve taken several lives in the past year.”
A smile twitched at the corner of Cas’ mouth as he watched the children, eyes softening. “I want to help people become whole. I want to help them heal.”
“Thank you ladies. Looking forward to seeing you there.”
And that’s when the plan was born.
Castiel didn’t usually get first-timers. He had only been at Archangel St. Raphael’s church for the past two years and, on average, spent three sessions a week in the confession booth.
Dean completely ignored his phone the next day. He was busy piecing over what the hell happened the last few days. First he arrived. Sam talks to a strange guy. Guy arrives at show, Sam says he invited him. They go to lunch the next day, Cas shows up in an obvious not-coincidence.
“Not for you. Come on in.” Dean could handle this.
“Cassie?” he barked, looking harder at the group he was unwittingly stalking.
Dean thought he would gave him the same courtesy. “Then I guess you won’t mind informing people. Oh, and you might want to preach a little less about brimstone and a little more about not treating other people like shit. I’ve noticed some of your congregation haven’t quite grasped that.”
The interior was open and spotless. The kitchen boasted handsome countertops and the couch had the soft sheen of leather that was well cared for. Not one item was extraneous.
broken up with him. That hurt a guy where it counted, she was going to have to want this.
“Nope, not here to attend. Can you pass this on to him?” He held out the flyer and kept the receipts.
While he did a few more curious neighbors to open their door, they usually fell into two categories. Some asked him questions about himself and the Sunday service, and others asked him about himself and the contest. It was easy to tell which were being polite and which had an interest.
“Dean, are you going to be able to finish that?” Sam snorted as he eyed the burger he still had left.
That was like two weeks after they broke up. Dean simmered and stewed, foot bouncing as he crossed his ankle over his thigh.
While Dean was stewing in the juices of his own too-big smile to show he didn’t care, Sam ordered a chicken sandwich without bread or mayo, and a side of celery and carrots they used for the wings.
“Okaaay.” He kept typing away though, clicking a couple of times on his mouse. “Cassie has an account on here.”
This was it. This is how a man became a man, and possibly got arrested too. Dean pushed past the kid, who squawked, and walked in a straight path. The people in white parted for him, some less than willingly, until Dean was in front of Cas and Cas was in front of him.
“Might’ve said something. Why?” Dean adopted a casual pose that was similar to Benny’s partially angled away stance. It helped put people at ease.
“Hmm. He should’ve gotten Dovie’s recipe. I could’ve asked her last night.”
“So it’s probably not hers.” She probably plowed the whole team. Uncharitable thought, but Sam was already clicking through the rest. She had pictures of old classic cars, from old and dented to shiny and remodeled. “Her dad messes with old cars..” Dean muttered. It was how they met. She didn’t know a battery from an engine herself.
Dean bet there were a lot of females of many ages in the pulpit that weren't thinking of God when they looked at him. “I’ll grab a voltage tester and then pick up more light bulbs for you.” He finally looked back at Edith, flashing her one of his best smiles. If part of the other church’s popularity was their incredibly good-looking priest, well, Dean was good looking too. He knew it, it was part of the reason he was so good at his job.
He hung up and headed out to Baby. He had to clean out the trash from travel before peeling out of the sleepy street. Luckily he had an impeccable sense of direction and got there without much trouble. Plus whoever laid down the pavement was uncreative and it would be impossible to get lost.
Father Novak tilted his head while observing him, long lashes framing his blue eyes that girls would kill for.
It was a large parish for a relatively middling-sized town on the outskirts of the city. It was just as much community as worship that kept the seats filled.
“It’s nice to meet you…?” She held out a hand.
Dean immediately frowned, he did no such thing! And when the door opened he raised an arm protectively over his chest until he could see if it was that transparent. Luckily it was just Sam and Blue Eyes.
“Great. Why don’t I take up smoking and shooting up too? I’ll blow my cover in a hot minute.”
Dean gets a taste of pain, and of fire. Each burn in their own special way.
Exactly at eight Sam began to openly check his watch. “I should get going soon.” Damnit, he was going to ruin all of Dean’s plans. Plan-ruiner! Obviously moving his egg’s from Sam-being-bold to Cas-making-a-move was great, but not if Sam just up and left.
Dean checked his phone again once the conversation moved on to whether proper attire would be khakis or charcoal grey trousers for live music. Not Sammy, he wasn’t some country club prep. Admittedly though, he was dressed nicer than Dean, who wore scuffed jeans and his green flannel shirt.
The angel hardly reacted through the brutal motions that thudded against his chest. “I came to bring you out of Hell.”
“No, I don’t mind sharing a bottle with you,” he said a bit stiffly, looking all around before peering at Dean out the corner of his eye. That was new. “You mentioned, um, being straightforward?”
A horrifying thought struck him as he carried out the trash full of burnt and cracked aluminum.
Charlie squeaked and ran off without another word. There were titters and laughter around, and she returned immediately and plunked down three bottles. “I wasn’t sure what kind you might like, or any, are you okay?”
“What, you’re going to go out there with Grabby McGrabbyhands? I will kick his ass if I have to.”
He searched for a plastic bag and threw the pipes in them. He could hear the excited patter of her feet behind him like an excited puppy.
The thick irony that their mother had lost her will. The woman was never not in control.
Sam swore he was sure this was the right place, tracking credit cards and video footage all pointed to this being his last and final stop. It was tiny and isolated, no surveillance to hack into, and one sheriff and two deputies. Dean had to admit if he were hiding out he’d pick here too.
Dean rolled his eyes good-naturedly, he bet Sam covertly invited him while he was complaining sooo much. Couldn’t blame him, Dean was trying to get a peek at his ‘object of interest’ deep-throating food too.
“Because you’re not a savage, that’s why."
Pink-cheeked, the rough hewn man waved a man. “No, not that.” He chuckled, the brevity seeming to help. “I mean, why did you become a Minister then? The two aren’t a widely accepted combination.”
Dean rarely had his space invaded by another man who wasn’t looking for a fight, so he scanned the other man’s expression closely. No, those eyes were guileless and his mouth soft and relaxed. Whew, okay, well. “I’m Dean Paxton. Good to meet you.” He almost said Father, but that felt as strange on his tongue as calling him Daddy.
He stepped back as if a shock sparked where they touched. It was the first time Cas used his name, and it made him feel...strange. “Stop that,” he growled, roughly grabbing Cas’s lower lip and raking his nails down.
It was plucked from his hands, and he stared as Cas whirled it around his shoulders and pushed his arms through the sleeves.
“Just wanted to make sure you’re cool with it. Not everyone is.”
The rush of cool air blowing through the house felt great. It was way better than the crap air conditioning in her apartment. That tiny place was like the maw of a hellhound; terrifyingly hot and most likely dangerous.
Castiel shook his head with concern, the first sign of emotion he showed. “We’re wasting time. I can’t take you against your will.”
There would be no paradise for them.
“What?”
“God’s word is higher than Michael’s, Cas. He’s who you have to listen to.”
Cas sighed and turned his car off, taking his coffee with him as he opened the door, stepping out into the heat and humidity of the early morning.
Once upon a time, Cas did envision himself as a priest. Those daydreams happened when he had spaced out during mass, listening to the older priest at St. Paul’s drone on and on and on and imagining himself doing a better job. Father Joshua Laurence at the same church, younger then, encouraged Cas’s pursuits honestly.
“Don’t finish until I can get my hands on you,” Dean said, looking down.
What he liked doing the most was taking a trout he caught the day before and shoving it in the bear’s head, letting it sit out in the warm room for hours, sometimes days, until someone noticed. Lee hated it, but on those days, elected to work at the bar out in the dining room.
“Yes, yes, no, and yes,” Dean answered.
“I interrupted I’m sorry,” Dean said, slipping back into a more serious expression.
“I said ‘get over here’,” Cas said louder, eyes still closed but reaching back behind him, his ring catching Dean’s bedside light, pulling back the sheets. Dean grinned and obeyed, sliding out of his flannels, kicking them to the side.
Dean and Cas concluded that, at least for the time being, to make sure they weren’t outside when he’d usually slip by for a walk. Thankfully, they learned quickly from Gerry at the roadhouse that Reynolds usually takes a walk around five in the morning, and it’s only on days when he has a rough time getting out of bed he’d walk by any later.
They had wound up at Glen Elder several other times, sometimes to sooth whatever nightmares had held onto them tight the night before, sometimes just wanting to have some time to themselves, others to have more significant conversations, to work through issues and bust through walls that couldn’t be shoved under the rug anymore, all in order to make whatever it was they had work.
“I’ve been thinking—“
That night, Dean kept all the lights on. He kept thinking about those men out in the open, completely exposed and uncaring whoever saw them.
The two continued to talk as Benny felt the earth move away from him, their voices growing faint, distant.
Castiel shrugged and sighed heavily. Dean could tell they were nearing the end of this part of the conversation. “I’m not sure when. It didn’t happen overnight but when you invest this much time and energy into something, it’s not easy to just walk away.”
“I guess I’ll just have to do your job for you then,” Cas said, turning back to Sergeant Mills. He grabbed his keys off the bedside table and didn’t look back on her or Dean as he left the room.
“My—which friend?” Cas asked. He knew Michael knew, he just had to hear him say it—
“I don’t want you scared and unhappy around me. You and I both know those are no lives to live,” Cas started, struggling to find the adequate words that reflected how badly he needed Dean to understand. “I don’t know how I can reassure you, other than you have my word that I would never turn out like Michael, or Lucas, or Gabriel, or my father. I wish I could fast forward in time and show you, but since I can’t, you’ll have to have some faith in me. You’ll have to trust me. If you can’t, then—”
“I don’t think I can go in there, I’m sorry.”
Joshua was silent for another moment.
“Okay, okay,” Dean gasped at the look, Cas' eyes dark, expectant, “Okay…”
Dean spent most of the morning trying to figure how he’d go about things, still without a plan, and wondered if he would just wing it when his phone rang.
As he came to the intersection, he decided to head back home to try and dig out his old phone to see if it would work. If he had to go straight to the cabin, then he had some extra time in terms of their timeline for the night.
“I can’t even begin to describe how much,” Dean answered.
“But I’m also a big supporter of the notion that some people are worth waiting for,” Joshua said, still watching Cas who now just hit the dirt absentmindedly. Cas couldn’t wait—that was the problem.
“I’m sorry,” was all Dean could think of. And he was. Not just that Reynolds lost his partner, but the fact that the old man seemingly lived his life with this sadness tugged at Dean’s heartstrings. He wondered how much Reynolds was able to express that grief to anyone throughout his life.
“I don’t think you know how to be quiet,” he said casually before walking through the door.
“Simple,” Cas corrected with a smile.
“Can’t smell or taste things like I used to, I guess.”
No, he didn’t know what he was doing. Absolutely no clue.
“Yes, I would like to attend, and thank you for offering the invitation,” Castiel clarified as they rounded the last aisle along the wall. “I have to make sure nothing is happening that night on my end, but if I can’t—”
Cas wasn’t completely asleep, only dozing or staring at the ceiling while his eyes weren’t closed. He didn’t want to look at the person next to him because he knew once he did, the dream would shatter and he’d wind up waking up in his own bedroom.
It was the confidence that Cas had gained over the years that was always the biggest turn-on for Dean, and right then, as Cas moved so easily in their semi-public place, Dean decided that he’d want to do this again.
“I’ve only been seeing her for a month!” Cas yelled back, “And what if she says no?”
Dean laughed as he stood as well, ready to get to bed.
The slow and steady breathing up against Dean stopped as the small actions disturbed Cas, waking him up. Dean heard a drawn-out yawn behind him as Cas shifted as well, arm lifting off of Dean and up into the air before coming back down. Cas placed a hand on Dean’s back, no longer protected by the warmth.
Dean stopped floating, putting both feet on the pool floor.
“Looks too old to be your kid, or that other guy’s.”
“You’ve been working on a farm since you were a kid with your granddad and dad and yet at your age, still can’t fix a tractor?”
“You think I have something in my pocket?” he asked, unable to stop looking at the ring box, wanting Cas to just
“Why?” Cas asked. He knew why; it was going to be a repeat of that Christmas all those years ago, but he wanted to hear Michael say it to his face this time.
“I just don’t understand why he cares so much,” Cas mulled out loud, not really expecting an answer.
Castiel sighed again, exuding a tremendous amount of melancholy. It was a little awkward. Dean knew Castiel for all of an hour and already had deep sympathy for the guy. He knew what it was like to feel that depressed. Not in the way that caused Castiel his low, but Dean could tell the feeling was the same.
Michael cleared his throat and grabbed a briefcase waiting for him on his desk.
Dean wondered if he needled hard enough, the vein on Michael’s temple would bust.
They finished their ice cream as the conversation dissolved into Star Wars again, having put on a movie marathon earlier in the afternoon while everyone enjoyed their Christmas presents, particularly Jack who got a pretty intricate replica of Luke’s green lightsaber. Cas sat and listened as Jack and Dean laughed, engaging in a heavy debate on whether Han Solo was, in fact, a Jedi before moving off to talk about one of the follow up TV shows.
Not that he cared that much.
Frowning in confusion, she looked back at the phone, and Cas, for the first time in twelve hours, felt like he could breathe.
his anxiety threw at him, thinking about earlier in the week when he pulled Cas into the tv den.
Trying to stave off the feeling of dread Cas felt coming, he continued to scroll through the photos Dean sent him. Cas paused on one of him soaking wet with a life vest on, glaring at the camera, holding up a middle finger.
That’s when the panic, and some jealousy, settled in again. There were questions Dean couldn’t place proper words to but knew they were there. They stood on the outskirts of his mind, waiting to attack, and Dean didn’t know what to do about it—except hit send on the photo and the video, needing that distraction.
“The books were out of place. And I saw you outside the window at the mall.”
Hannah’s house wasn’t nearly as large as Cas’s but he still missed the bathroom twice before finally finding the door. But before he could open it, he heard his name.
Two steps inside the house and Michael looked up and saw him.
It pleased Dean to hear that Cas sounded a little shaky and almost breathless, like what little resolve he did have left was beginning to crumble.
“What?” Dean asked as he went to remove the jacket.
He wanted to complain as Cas dropped his hands and leaned back on the bench against the wall, but Dean instead had to focus on his now slightly shaking hands trying to undo the buttons. Cas didn’t help. Just watched, eyes trained on each and every button Dean focused on. Dean thought about drawing it out; Cas had indicated he didn’t want it over and done with within a minute, but they also couldn’t spend the whole afternoon in there.
Half asleep, he felt the mattress move as Cas turned over and lifted himself up on one elbow to take a sip of water. Cas had been restless for over an hour, but Dean hadn’t moved, waiting to see if it was just discomfort or if it truly was a night terror.
He settled down from his amusement and spoke softly, still picking at his thumb.
Cas nodded and gave Dean’s hand a small squeeze.
The worst thing about it was that Cas couldn’t give those emotions a name. He didn’t know what to call them. But every time he heard Dean gasp, whisper how good it felt, try to catch the whine in his throat, it pulled Cas further and further into their world, completely forgetting about everyone and everything, else.
Waiting around for some kind of activity spiked Castiel’s annoyance. Not moving, not doing any kind of action made him restless.
“No it’s not. But it doesn’t matter,” Dean explained, trying to keep his tone even. He didn’t want a lecture about needing a wife at home to cook food or anything. “A partner is a partner and I’m lucky and grateful, I have one.”
“Good?” He asked, watching Cas’s face in the window reflection. The answer every time either one of them asked remained unchanged, but they still asked—it was a comforting habit to know they did.
“Cas—”
He wasn’t alone in his mission as he practically dragged Benny with him, promising a few rounds of drinks afterward. And Lee would be there, earning some extra money as a for-rent bartender so at least there would be one friendly face.
“Maybe you should just try on that last jacket now,” Cas murmured, sounding a little breathless himself.
The windows stood perpendicular to each other in the corner where the tub nestled into—low enough for Dean to see outside, but mostly just the top half of trees and the gray, murky sky. Birds still insisted on making noise despite the lack of cheerful weather. Their tunes lulled Dean into a shallow nap, closing his eyes while the warmth spread deep into him.
The music from the festival continued on as they came down together, Dean laying on Cas’s right instead of his left like usual.
Though, in his desire to delay the talk until they got back home, Cas feared a frosty rest of the morning.
Dean smiled to himself when he thought about it, turning away from the rest of the room. In the grocery store, Castiel wasn’t as formal in dress, but still had a light, short-sleeved white button-down on and chinos. It was a summer look, but far from something that looked easy-breezy, and more like someone who definitely laid their clothes out the night before.
“Home.”
He had claimed the night before that there were still several items on his list for Sam and Eileen, which immediately triggered Dean’s “bullshit” meter. In other years, Cas had gotten his shopping done before Thanksgiving, bragging about it whenever Dean had mentioned he still needed to figure things out a week before Christmas.
“Yeah—yeah just give me a sec,” Dean said, keeping his eyes closed. He shifted his hips a little, trying to relax, and Cas squeezed his eyes shut, trying to take short, shallow breaths.
that kiss earlier today?” Dean asked, smiling because he already knew the answer.
Castiel couldn’t look up from the ground, didn’t want to look at the group several hundred yards away, about to charge. The fear from Dean jumped into Castiel and he couldn’t shake it.
Cas hesitated, knowing Dean didn’t like to hear about Hannah—but that was the whole reason why he came.
Cas’S hands shook a little as he glanced up at Dean.
That broke the dam. It unleashed everything that had been barely hanging by a thread to begin with.
“Cas,” Dean said after a moment of silence. “Cas look at me.”
Dean had to eventually excuse himself from Lee’s story about crashing into the mayor of a neighboring city, a story he’d heard thousands of times, in order to start the food.
No one screamed, no one made a single sound. Castiel suffered in silence as they held him, and burned him into much-needed submission.
“No, I’m just going to go find Jack, it’s after five,” Cas whispered.
They still had a long way to go, but the eagerness, determination, and love, only ever grew day by day, month by month, year by year.
“I’ll make up for it tomorrow night,” he promised as he sat at the edge of the seat, rolling down the window slightly. Dean noted his disappointed tone as well.
They continued down the aisles together all the way to the check out line, chatting about town things especially given Castiel was never around. For Dean, it felt like a whole new world opened up to him. A friendly Charleston, a Charleston that didn’t despise him, a Charleston that wasn’t out to ruin his life. Dean’s world flipped with this one person but it was exciting to see something that changed things up.
Cas jumped slightly as cold paint on the brush hit his cheek.
Which was the whole point, he supposed.
As Cas finished up, he felt a light tap on his head indicating Dean was done.
“Did we get the same ones?”
Dean turned back to him, frowning in confusion. Cas looked nervous and bizarre, just standing in the middle of people’s walking paths, staring at Dean.
Dean sighed again and pushed the napkin and drink away.
Dean laughed and looked down at his hand, “Well, compared to the rock on Eileen’s hand I can see his point.”
Benny left a hefty tip for the waitress and she smiled, giving him a little wave which put some pep in Benny’s step.
Dean’s brain boiled it down even further as he stared at his ceiling an hour after Cas left:
Dean, wanting a distraction, reached for one of the last chips on the plate, but Castiel went for it at the same causing their hands to bump into each other. They both instantly withdrew and Dean smiled, trying to push away the increasing awkwardness.
But they didn’t.
Dean gestured to the plate,
Also to hopefully find something edible because he hated the food out at the party, and Michael conveniently forgot Cas was allergic to shellfish.
Men and women ablaze in glitter, sequins, and rainbows walked around him. Many, if not all, were all smiling and laughing. Some pulled children, equally decorated in rainbows and sequins, along in plastic wagons adorned with various flags. Cas didn’t even know there were so many flags — he only knew the rainbow one and the tri-color one Dean usually painted on his face for the day. Theoretically, he knew of more, just due to their friends, but he never really saw other flags in his day-to-day.
He also almost said it when he was beginning to doze off in front of the TV, bored with daytime soaps already. Cas had gotten up to close the door, keeping the noise out, and came back to give Dean a light kiss on his neck, cheek, and then his mouth. Dean
A small, stifled whine escaped from him as he leaned into the wall, needing the support, up as the wave crashed over him. Cas let go of Dean’s hip and wound an arm around his front as he moved a fraction inward, pressing more against Dean, hips moving in minute circles as he turned his head back from the mirror and pressed his mouth against the jacket—Dean felt, rather than heard, a muffled groan and a sharp inhale.
“Good.”
“Hey, can you come over here?” Dean asked, waving a hand. He didn’t really need help, but he figured it’d make Reynolds feel like he was useful for something. Plus — the man was ninety-four. He had to learn how to fix a tractor before he died.
“I told you when I was going to do all that with Eileen,” Sam shot back.
“I had another date with Hannah this afternoon,” Cas mumbled, picking at a spot on the styrofoam.
Dean’s leg began to bounce and Cas reached over and placed a hand on his knee to get him to stop.
The messages were no longer those of casual conversation or pictures of food or whatever thing Dean was doing at that time. He instead decided to relive their night together in graphic, unrelenting detail which did nothing to help Cas stave off those corresponding images in his head.
“Alright, let’s get down to brass tax here,” Zachariah said after he and Michael dappled in some light talk for a few minutes.
“That sounds ominous,” Dean said quietly, keeping his eyes on Cas for his reaction.
It’d be another long drive back, but Cas could care less about sleep at that point.
Cas glanced around them as they turned onto Copley. They weren’t going to be able to afford to spend a few nights in Boston proper anyway but Dean knew that a lot of families, trying to save as much college money as they could, sucked up all the rooms on the outskirts of the city.
One of the things that he was taught constantly by kind teachers was that money wasn’t everything. It was a funny kind of lesson to teach a group of boys who came from wealthy families, but Cas took it to heart.
He blocked the rational voice out—just wanting to get out of his claustrophobic car and do
Castiel reached behind him and pulled out his phone, “We should probably exchange numbers just in case.”
“I have a kid, and a couple pseudo ones as well.”
He had looked back at the house before he got into the car. It sat in the shadows of the trees, lights off, empty and alone.
9:10 p.m.
The man whipped his arm back up and pointed the gun at Dean. He tried acting fast but the gunman had half a second advantage. As Dean began to turn away, the gun fired.
Michael didn’t attack Dean when he left the bar.
Dean cleared his throat and turned back to the parade, waving at little kids decked out in neon and tossing candy into the crowd. Cas offered a small wave as well and was rewarded with a few packets of Sweet Tarts.
Joshua shrugged and went back to digging, “There’s nothing, realistically, stopping you from not doing it. And your mission right now is to show this young man just how much you love him and want to be with him so he understands it’s not as much of a scary jump as he thinks.”
But no one is on your side, and no one is listening. No one appears before you.
“Is it time to get out?” Dean asked as Cas slid off the float.
Dean was first to pull away and slide away from Cas. He still wanted to play games as he walked backward to keep Cas in his sights. Pushing open the door to his room, Dean leaned against the door jamb with a playful smile.
Once outside, Dean didn’t look back, didn’t go into the party to find Benny, and instead went straight to the truck, trying to call Benny to say it was time to go. After five tries, and as Dean got to the truck, Benny finally picked up.
Dean kept his smile, “It sounds like you already know where you want to go.”
The satisfaction as he placed the nail gun on the workbench overrode any discomfort in his back. Cas could have helped, but knowing them, they wouldn’t get very far. They’d get distracted by talking paint colors, where certain things would be placed once it was done, or just get distracted by each other and spend the rest of the day inside. Better to get it all done so they could spend the whole day bending each other over and not have any guilt over ignored tasks.
Something shifted.
Dean smiled and they started to walk toward the escalator.
Things looked different on the ground versus how Cas originally came into the area — and at night, with his eyesight now nothing special, things did look exceptionally foreign — but he still knew where to go.
Heading to Kansas City as part of his job three years prior, taking that chance and going to a bar and, meeting Dean had changed some aspects of his fear, but Cas still refrained from being an active participant in the LGBT community.
“I’m not—I’m not putting the cart before the horse on this one,” Michael explained, “Once I get the go-ahead, I’m leaving.”
“Not even your friends—your brother?”
Heart pounding in his ears, Cas closed his eyes to gather himself.
He continued down the long narrow hallway, scrolling through his phone. The noise of what little amount of people were left died down as Benny opened the door to the parking lot.
“What about you?” Cas asked.
It was the fact that Cas anticipated them still being together in seven months' time. The brochure, the trip, all told Dean that Cas wasn’t having second thoughts about their relationship under the surface and that he really did have no doubts of them continuing forward. The burden of having to exist in the time they do with the restrictions on them, did nothing to dampen Cas’s enthusiasm for their relationship. Deep down, Dean knew that already, but seeing it visible, tangible in his hands, was something else entirely.
Cas didn’t hesitate this time, also pulling the t-shirt off, laying it next to Dean’s, and headed over to him on the bed.
“Dean—”
“Have you and Dean—“
He didn’t take solace in the fact he was only coming back to God because he had a problem that needed solving, but it was just something he had to accept.
The radio had stopped working as soon as they passed Hartford and into Springfield, but the Christmas music had been a pleasant distraction from his nerves while it lasted.
“What can I help you with, Cas?” Joshua asked, removing his cassock and hanging it up next to his desk.
Cas hung up first, and Dean stood there with the phone to his ear for a few more moments before everything settled into place.
“Yes.”
“Well, I can’t name that one Paradise Hills if I already named that other one Paradise Hills,” Cas explained, keeping his voice light. The same butterflies that struck him Sunday night had returned.
“So—are you gonna be around here or—?” Dean asked, trying to remember what Catholic churches were around.
“They didn’t talk about me much here, I guess.”
Eventually, unable to stop it, Dean heard himself toe the line of “too personal”. He generalized his father’s death, and his brother going off to school, not divulging either name.
He didn’t even want to
Cas shook his head, pulling up another rock. Joshua leaned over and stilled his hands.
die.”
“Your belt snapped and you’re leaking oil.”
The place was ugly. Dean knew he was biased in his opinion, but the place was
“Get up,” the voice ordered.
“There was a house I saw in a picture once, someone from school showed me. He lived on the northern coast of Maine. He showed me a picture of the beach, but up further north, there was this rocky cliff—there was a house up there. I’m not saying it’s going to be there, or that I know where it is, but—“
But once the person intended to hear those words leaves, the reasons seem superficial and easy to move past. You’re angry at yourself for not having the wherewithal to push past those small barriers and say what should have been said.
Dean took a deep breath while still on his bed and took out his phone, thinking for a moment before he scrolled down a few messages and opened the text chat for Benny.
It was a victory for them both.
“Who’s—” he started but Cas waved his hand as Ave Maria came up next.
“You’re not screwing this up for me, kid. Watch yourself.”
“No lights?” Dean asked as he finished the last of the tinsel in his hand, glancing down into the box.
“Yes it does, thank you.”
Cas jumped as his phone buzzed against the seat belt buckle. He reached over and read the message—
Until that moment, he didn’t give much thought as to why.
“Will you marry me?”
“A concert doesn’t start for another two hours,” Cas said, looking at the schedule. He felt rather than saw Dean stand up a little straighter next to him.
“I ain’t payin’ you.”
Cas turned around, frowning.
As Dean moved to grab his pants, he stopped, looking at Cas and then over to the jacket.
They came back down together with Dean mouthing Cas’s shoulder again, both of them getting their breathing back in order.
Dean, unable to stop himself from doing so, stood on the back of his shopping car at the grocery store, racing down the empty aisle ahead of him.
If he took whatever Michael had come to throw at him, then hopefully whatever was up Michael’s ass would pass, and Dean could get the fuck out of there.
“Yes. But the first time we met, he didn’t know who I was and I didn’t know about any of this so I couldn’t—”
“Well, if I do something you don’t like just tell me.”
“When did you realize it?”
Cas ran a hand up the jacket along Dean’s back, over his shoulders, and down his arms. Dean watched, mesmerized as the sequins flipped from the iridescent black to a silver.
“Hello Benny, this is Cas. Just wondering if you have heard from Dean recently? I’ve been trying to contact him tonight with no luck. You can call me back at this number at any time. Thank you,” he said in a rush, ending awkward.
“Uh—about seven. Why?”
Anger flared in Dean as he looked down at the old phone, seeing the time. He swore, realizing if Cas had left earlier, he would best Dean by at least an hour and get to the cabin first, not see Dean, and probably panic.
Cas went over to the back of the truck, right in front of Dean but not looking at him, and slipped free from his shirt. Folding it, while still avoiding eye contact, Cas placed it in a side pocket opposite Dean’s things.
“Why? I don’t—”
“I guess I’m always just nervous I’m gonna wind up like that. He drank himself to death over it all.”
But it was a terrifying shift, one that unseated much of what Dean had been led to believe and learn throughout the course of his life thus far.
Dean nodded, “Yeah, figured you’d want to get ready before going out there and everything.”
“I know that face,” Benny said. “You have to stop letting your past get in the way of your future.”
“What’s what —?”
“Your phone was in your back pocket when you said you had to go get it,” Cas said, a smile still on his face.
and it’s still strange sometimes to say that I was just
, but that feeling came back. That fear thing.”
looking at me even after he closed the door—he was watching me through the bow window when I left.”
By morning, adrenaline buzzed through Dean like a constant electric current.
Truth was, Dean knew he shouldn’t have gone there either.
And that was true. Cas couldn’t deny that. If he went off of the standard definition of faith, Cas took a chance on Dean from the first day and each and every time they met after. He had faith when they had first started talking, ignoring the warnings from his brother—he had faith at the bonfire when they both divulged their secrets to each other despite only knowing each other for a few days. Cas had faith when they went to Kansas City when they went out to the field, and the previous night when he had faith Dean cared about Cas just as much as Cas cared for him. They had faith in each other—at least Cas hoped Dean had faith in him.
And just like that, he entered into the world he long thought out of his reach.
It was on the way home Lee suggested going to Club Paradise if Dean was focusing too much on one guy.
“Cas, look at me.”
They both continued on with the investigation in silence with the occasional observation. The answer about the photo album wasn’t exactly a lie, because Dean
To try and capture the sense of excitement and ease of that again, he opted for playing with Cas at that party. Sexting wasn’t a new concept for Dean, but sending photos, and videos, were.
The entryway led to an open door, which allowed access into a modest-sized kitchen with various house plants inside and a skylight on the high ceiling.  The lighting felt cold with concrete and stainless steel countertops and appliances, and lack of any personal objects to indicate anyone utilized the room.
This is Cas asking him a question.
Jack smiled and went back to his ice cream, “Cas told me to ask you if you’re happy since it’s a question you have to answer.”
not someone like that.
They met once again, Dean surging forward, but the kiss remaining slow and teasing rather than fast and desperate. Cas wound his arms around Dean, staving off the impulse to just throw him down onto the couch and get between his legs.
It was easy to forget they were in public, sequestered away but still in public. The scene mirrored so many other times this happened, except at home, in their bedroom or that one time, the war room—always hypnotic, always a complete turn on despite the minuteness of the motions.
Michael sighed and rubbed his face in agitation, “This is me telling you how you can do your part in this family and help. I know you never liked us that much, but that’s just how it goes.”
As quick as he could, Dean threw open the door, almost hit his head as he folded into the front seat, and slammed the door. He locked the doors as he held his breath. He didn’t want to look outside the window, afraid of what he’d find.
He didn’t give Zachariah or Michael a chance to talk him out of it before he turned and ran up the stairs.
“No means upsetting Michael, getting cut off from any resources I may need to keep going in life, basically never being able to see anyone I care about again and being on my own with no help. It’s not like I have a functional degree,” Cas turned to Dean with a sad smile.
It only took a short time later for Dean and Sam to fracture completely with Dean unable to look past all that had happened. Castiel chose to view it as Dean not only being thrown aside by someone so close to him, family but also that the problem had now become so insurmountable. Dean and Sam now had the knowledge that their existence was only to be vehicles for annihilation, pitted against each other in the worst way.
just to see what it looked like, careful to delete before sending anything else.
Cas’s fear, the panic, finally spoken into words brought tears with them. He used the back of his hand to wipe them away, keen to not cry in front of Joshua.
But Dean also knew the other truth, the other side to that coin, the thing that made the questions lurking around his head perk up.
Dean reached the offshoot hallway that led to the restrooms and sure enough, a line had formed for both men and women. He walked down the hall, staring at the men’s line.
He’d never had another man in bed before, was still new to all of that, but he had seen videos. He didn’t watch a lot of them, but sometimes, it was all he could do. The aftermath usually led to more shame, but it was an indulgence he gave himself every so often.
“Probably something with education. I always had amazing teachers growing up.”
Cas, not wanting to move at all, sighed and lifted his head, turning to the left.
Dean really was an attractive man.
He was being used as a weapon against Dean as well.
Cas had never seen someone look as sick as Michael did when the knowledge came to light.
One new thing at a time.
He pressed down, moving at a leisurely pace. Cas and Dean were flying blind in this department, but if that was the kind of reaction Cas could draw out, then maybe it wouldn’t be too difficult to navigate.
Dean’s face fell, and Cas wondered if he had completely forgotten about the expected proposal.
“Can we just talk?”
“I like you,” he answered, voice a little hoarse. That was the truth—Hannah was very nice. She was a nice young woman. But Cas paused, wondering how honest he should be. Hannah expected requited feelings, a sense of love and caring—something Cas only felt for someone else.
“So it’s a look, don’t touch situation?”
But he too felt the exhaustion, energy all but spent in the afternoon sun and now in bed. His limbs grew heavy and he crawled over to the left side of the bed as Dean moved to make room for him.
It was hard enough voicing things to Dean face to face, let alone having to explain to everyone else.
Dean glanced at Cas before nodding, focusing back on the ring box. All the words he had wanted to say for months lined up in his mouth, ready to come out in a rush.
And slid in once more, faster than the other times.
Cas glanced at him, before looking down at his lap, picking at his hands with a frown deepening itself.
Dean bit his lip from laughing out loud and instead let it turn into a smile, “Not a problem at all.”
Dean didn’t want to go after all.
“Really?”
… Cas wanted him so bad.
“How would I know if it was real or not?”
To distract himself, Cas bent his head down again and peppered kisses along Dean’s jaw and on the sensitive spot just under his ear. He heard Dean’s attempt at regulating his breathing and tried to match every kiss to every inhale and exhale, both of them working on the same, slow rhythm—anything to get them to calm down.
Dean didn’t know if it was because Castiel was a Charleston who didn’t seem, at least on the surface, like the others, or the fact that he was Charleston who was Dean’s age and seemed to be easy to talk to and sounded like he had a pretty rich history, more interesting than Dean’s or any of his friends’. Along with stories of his family that Dean would love to file away as blackmail.
A car, an ugly beige Bently that Cas had seen many times in the last month, had pulled into Mr. Johnson’s driveway, turning its headlights off. The faint light from the woman’s house next door provided little illumination, but they could still make out the slight contours of the man’s face as he walked by, stuffing something into his suit jacket.
, Cas told himself as he accepted his first drink of the afternoon.
The barn itself was an empty shell, clearly not used in a while. The door had been unlocked and when he and Dean investigated to make sure no one had been squatting in there, they only saw a couple of old, abandoned tractors, a workbench, and old, worn-out graffiti.
That was
The man took another small step forward and a second light from the porch across the way turned on, beaming even more light into Dean’s eyes and obscuring the man’s face.
He lifted his hand and rested it on the back of Dean’s head, drawing him in for another quick kiss.
Benny looked disgusted.
The night before, pressed against Dean in bed, Cas’s sense of unease as he remained distracted from his anxiety and reassured everything would be alright.
But as he reached for his phone, he saw a few text messages from Dean who said he had taken a trip to a lake house a little west of town.
They continued to sit in silence with Dean fidgeting, shifting here and there, moving closer and closer to Cas, who stayed still, amused.
Cas’s hand went back into his coat pocket, and Dean could
“I never really got him to listen to me, I just didn’t listen to him.”
He let go of Cas and instead gripped Cas’s hips, stilling them and readjusting himself.
It sounded lame as Cas said it, unable to fully articulate why he did it, or why he liked it, only just that in a finals week or when he had been feeling particularly homesick for a home he never actually wanted to return to, he’d take one of the telescopes and bring it to the roof. In relaying that story to Gabriel, Cas had been gifted one.
When Dean’s hands finally slid down Cas’s back and gripped the swell of his ass, digging his fingers in slightly and flexing, Cas choked off a gasp against Dean’s neck. Dean smirked as Cas brought his head up, deposited a quick kiss, and moved off of him entirely, leaving a pocket of cooling water in his wake.
“Don’t wish ill on someone like that,” Lee mumbled, taking a pack of beer out of the final paper bag and folding it up.
Moving back once more, Cas knew Dean was close. Legs tensing, hand on Cas’s head shaking a little — Cas concentrated on that sensitive spot that would finish the job, the quick switch to get Dean off fast.
Ignoring the remaining aches his body threw out, Dean moved and snatched the bottle next to him. He shifted onto his knees as well behind Cas. Before he popped the cap, Dean leaned forward and placed a gentle kiss on Cas’s shoulder, smiling at the visible goosebumps that followed and the scent of cinnamon and some other spice from the soap.
And no doubt Michael would try to find them.
He thought it would have happened with Lucas when scandal after scandal came to light when he ran for Mayor, but they somehow managed to make that an isolated incident.
Looking uncomfortable, Dean lapsed into silence. Cas didn’t ask any more additional details, not wanting Dean to have to talk about it more.
They spent the following ten minutes pointing out random bright stars in the sky and naming them various things. One was named after Dean’s favorite movie star (“A star named Patrick Swazye is pretty cool, you have to admit”) and Cas named another after the street where he first crashed his bicycle (“Not too far from your house actually, over on Maple.”). Another one named for a really nice sandwich Dean had when he had first gone to Kansas City and Cas announced that the one right next to it would be named after his favorite hotel.
Dean let Cas’s hand go, settling back to where he was, grinning.
He started with what the local historians knew, about the Charlestons and the Winchesters both settling on the same land way back in the day, how both helped build the town up. Gabriel went on to say that when the split happened, it was when the Charlestons made business connections in Kansas City to bring more money into the town, but the Winchesters had built nearly every building that was still standing from that time. There had been debates ever since on whose town it really was in the sense of status and pride.
“It’s just — I don’t feel connected to Pride,” Cas explained, watching the birds sit on the branch outside their living room window, “I don’t… I don’t know why I need to do all of that to celebrate my life. Being with you and just existing is enough for me.”
He glanced to his right, seeing Michael with the visage of the man Castiel had originally been tasked with saving. Michael, no doubt feeling like he was being watched, turned, and caught Castiel’s stare.
“Pretty?”
Cas maneuvered Dean, pulling his hips away from the wall, causing Dean to bend over more—and so the mirror caught all the action. His breath left Dean as he watched Cas, without any hesitation, press right back into him, as if they had no interruption at all.
It advertised itself as a gay club, male-only, drag performances on Sunday and Wednesday nights. Cas picked it because it was the first on the list that had a rating higher than three stars. He called an Uber to take him to Kansas City 45 minutes away and he was going to experience something
“Not really—you?”
Cas nodded before realizing Gabriel couldn’t see him.
Dean clearly was enjoying his day—and Cas didn’t want to be a bother with calling Dean and ranting to him about his issues, especially since his tone shifted, even over texts, whenever he brought up Michael.
A house.
They took bets on the ride home on who would notice first.
Cas didn’t look in the review mirror until he knew the barn was safely out of sight.
Going to get a tray of cookies? Now’s the time. Placing another gift under the tree? Now. Final guests arrive mid-morning? Surely
Someone, something in Hell already knew they were coming and had Dean so well guarded, it would have taken much more force to break through the wall.
Sam gave him
Dean almost tripped on his way back out and Cas helped steady him. Before Dean could open his mouth, Cas cut him off.
“Topple y’all off the throne?” Dean provided, going off of conversations he’s overheard while working in the Gray’s backyard, with Zachariah screaming into his phone about a business deal.
“Glad Eric finally went home,” Dean mumbled, happy to see no cars in the parking lot. Closed for Christmas. Company rule.
“Michael?”
Was that one thing you had been holding close to you worth it?
“Okay—do you know where they are?”
Nothing in that held any value to him.
After seeing the three photos waiting for him and Dean’s ominous text that followed, Cas finally excused himself to the bathroom.
A few more minutes of silence went by and Dean was almost finished.
Reynolds wasn’t the meanest man Dean and Cas had ever come across in their life, but he certainly wasn’t pleasant. He had been walking a dog that looked downright prehistoric in the bright summer sun. They had just gotten the small farmhouse down the road from him and were unloading the car.
The question still remained if Dean was only interested in Cas because he was the only one available if Dean wanted to travel down this avenue.
The man turned into the light from the woman’s house in panic, finally showing his entire face.
“Can I ask you about Jessica?”
Dean tried not to look that much, but Christ, it was hard.
On his deathbed, his dad had asked him to stay, to keep their legacy going somehow, not letting old grudges die hard. Dean almost didn’t agree, but his father had looked so lost in the last few years of his life—and it
A pause as Dean heard Cas shift on the floor.
Unloved.
After a moment, Dean turned his head back, both eyes now open.
Someone shouted in the background in glee and another woman was laughing. They slowly got fainter until Cas heard birds chirping instead.
To combat the intrusive thoughts, Cas closed his eyes again—he pretended they weren’t in Dean’s room, in his house, in Worthington. Instead, they were in their own home, their own room, somewhere maybe on the east coast, looking at an entire day with nothing to do but stay in bed.
Cas shrugged and wiggled his fingers, Dean tightening his legs around Cas in response.
Benny wanted to close his eyes and rest for a minute, just a minute, just until the aching went away–
Hospitals were places of death.
It took a moment for Dean to snap to, digging out his phone and texting Sam if he was up or available. A pang of guilt hit him when he saw the last time they had texted was on Sam’s birthday months ago.
. “Which makes this more frustrating. I’ve never—this hasn’t happened to me before. And I had hoped that ever since we started whatever it was we had, that the thought had crossed Dean’s mind on— I’ve never been in a relationship, but isn’t that one of only two choices? A future or a breakup?”
“I know—but still.” Cas wished he had the proper words.
Not a word was spoken about any rings or proposals for the rest of the night—
“What?” Cas asked, going to do the same with his.
“Thinking about what?” Cas asked before depositing another kiss on the back of Dean’s neck as his hand began to travel down Dean’s side, fingers skating along too-sensitive skin. Dean couldn’t stop his back from arching slightly, trying both to get more and less of the touch.
He hit the brakes in the middle of the road, full stop.
Before he could get far Cas heard Dean move as well and felt a cold hand on his shoulder.
Cas sighed, ripping out more weeds, his mind spinning and twisting every which way with Joshua’s words.
“I wanted to apologize for how I acted yesterday.”
Cas sighed as he put his wallet back into his pocket as dread quickly replaced bliss.
Steadily, Dean picked up the pace, pulling Cas along with him with every minute movement of his hips. Tension filled Cas, threatening to snap every time Dean moaned in his ear, soft and sweet when Cas would move with him.
Cas suddenly stopped, fingers still inside but not moving.
He walked out of the barn with a yawn, wondering if he needed a nap as well.
“I have to tell you something,” Cas confessed, looking back up at Dean who remained still and quiet.
“I needed a switch-up instead of reading all night,” Cas replied.
Not that the bunker would stop being home as well—Dean made a mental note early on to emphasize that should he ever muster up the balls to bring the idea up—but a different kind of home. It had felt like since Christmas, since that night at Glen Elder park where they laughed over their rings, since the following day where they told their friends where their future plans were taking them—that they’ve officially entered the next phase, whatever that phase was, of their life.
“It is, but everything else out there tastes like—I don’t know,” he said, unscrewing the jelly jar. “But it’s bad. Peanut butter and jelly has never disappointed me.”
“No,” Cas had nearly shouted as adrenaline caused him to shoot up from his chair, almost knocking it over. “I’m done with this conversation.”
Cas sighed, staring at the ground. He could relate to that.
Daniel got to Dean first, and Castiel let him. He didn’t care all that much, only that they got the man and left Hell as soon as they could before they suffered any more losses. Many were already injured, or dead—far more than Castiel had expected.
“You go first,” he said, excitement growing on his face. The excitement caused Dean to smile, despite his nerves, and he nodded his head, unwrapping the neatly assembled package.
Cas knew the conversation would only lead to more frustrations and anger. He didn’t want to elaborate anymore. He just wanted to sit there quietly until maybe Dean got sick of him and kicked him out of the pool.
“But why—“
Anything. Even if it was just to punch a tree.
Cas’s voice brought Dean back out of his thoughts and he realized he had been staring at Cas’s hands in his lap.
, Dean had asked himself as he pulled into his driveway that afternoon.
“It’s not the same. They do it wrong up there.”
That did it.
“Last night, it was a present,” Cas explained, holding out his hand as Jack shifted over to look at it more closely.
Dean smirked, “I’ve never been to Mass, so—paint the picture for me.”
Which made his actions pretty fucking stupid.
Michael pointed a finger, narrowing his eyes, “I will lock you in here and only let you out to meet Hannah if I have to. Stay away from him. Their whole family is trouble.”
Dean felt a shiver run through him as he swung around, asking for a refill. Cas stayed completely still.
“Oh—oh no, wait,” Dean said, faking concern while looking over at their clothes, “I took a different jacket today—I don’t know if I have the stuff with me.”
“That doesn’t help,” Dean eventually answered. “He’s still from that family—and you know them, you know what they did. I’ve known Cas for such a short amount of time–”
“About four hundred and fifty thousand,” Cas said, scrolling through his phone to find Joshua’s number. He looked up when Dean said nothing to find him stunned. “What?”
Discomfort settled in as Cas parked. He was about to witness a world that had always been there for him to embrace and explore but remained out of reach.
“Then I’m naming that one,” Cas said before lifting himself up and pointing to another one that looked almost purple, close by to Dean’s star.
They spoke at the same time, forever on the same page, and Dean should have figured it would have happened. It’s not actually that they were on the same page, but more like the same paragraph, or sentence—the same words. With how the evening had progressed, with how the last several years of their life had progressed, it was only fitting they’d ask the same question at the same time holding the same rings inscribed with the same words and date.
Dean smiled as he walked through the doorway, greeted by a mostly decorated, though unlit, Christmas tree.
Exhaustion from the mental strain of the day began to set in, and all Dean wanted to do was fall asleep.
Cas turned, but did not see pity—Joshua looked determined.
Michael smirked but the smile did not reach his eyes, making him look as soulless as Dean believed him to be. He stepped forward and pointed the knife in Dean’s face, only inches away from the bridge of his nose.
“Yessir, we. That’s Cas,” Dean nodded his head in Cas’s direction. Cas didn’t smile or wave or greet himself, instead choosing to stand on the front step to the porch, staring at the old man.
There was more that Cas had to say. Dean could feel the tension from where he sat.
“Thank you for the invitation. It’s good to try new things, and I do like cookouts.”
Dean had to talk to someone, anyone.
“That—that doesn’t make sense,” Cas said slowly. Hearing it as one of those pesky
Thankfully, there was some park lighting a few yards away that didn’t make the place completely dark, but Dean knew that neither one of them would sleep well that night.
“Paradise Hills?”
Dean remembered Cas’s face in that kitchen as they sorted through their immediate plans that night, how much unrestrained happiness he exuded, the hope and the exhilaration—
Dean remembered and didn’t like to dwell on that night much. For months after it happened, Dean had to force himself not to pick up the phone and ask why Sam didn’t bother asking if Dean had wanted to leave as well.
What about you, you leaving too?
“If you’re gonna leave a mark, make it lower this time,” he warned, remembering the frozen terror of Monday as Zachariah hauled him into the tv den.
But as soon as he let his guard down, a darker, more sinister thought invaded.
It was worse, but not for the reasons Cas had thought.
He didn’t try to figure out what to say to her—but her recount of the vague timeline discounted a theory he had on what happened.
Dean looked as well and sure enough, two color wheels sat in the corner with their plugs wrapped around them.
He started with his sexual orientation realization in college since most of his current problems stemmed from that. Joshua listened, nodding along and sometimes patting Cas’s hand when he had to pause to collect himself, especially when he got to the part he realized he couldn’t continue on his path to priesthood.
They were going to do this.
Stupid, reckless, idiotic—but a better idea.
“I have a confession,” he said, sounding like he should be guilty of something but the hungry expression on his face gave that play away.
The actual marriage part, a wedding, however big or small that would be, was so far off that Cas hadn’t even a chance to dwell on what it would actually
9:20 p.m.
“Hey—sorry, I didn’t know if you were already asleep,” Dean said quietly.
The musical had been fine, not memorable, but fine. There, Cas felt that it was his turn to ask her if she wanted to go out to dinner that same night, following the show. She agreed.
Castiel nodded and pursed his lips, “Yeah, I got the small history lesson that night and it doesn’t make much sense to me. Michael couldn’t really give me an accurate explanation and it all seemed too complicated.”
Cas attempted a smile but it was a weak one, “I think I’m going to go home.”
Dean shook his head, “I’m not looking for permission. I’m telling you.”
They both lifted themselves up from their chairs and walked around the fire toward the gate. The backyard spotlight turned on, temporarily blinding Dean. When he blinked the spots out of his eyes, he watched as Cas went ahead of him to pass through the gate. His shoulders were hunched and he walked as if he had the weight of the world he knew on his shoulders.
Michael sighed and Cas heard him get up from the chair, walking over. Tensing, he focused on placing the books neatly inside the bag instead of looking over.
Jack paused, looking at it while he thought.
“We don’t have to go in if you don’t want to,” Dean offered again, now sounding worried.
At that point, even the cicadas and birds silenced themselves.
Dean trailed off, finally reaching the end of the road on manageable words and thoughts. He knew Cas understood, because of course he did, and of course Dean understood Cas. Once they had gotten onto the same page years ago, they never left.
Dean couldn’t help but smile as he watched a grown-ass man gently place a PB&J sandwich in place and use the knife to cut it diagonally. Compared to the scenery outside, it was absurd.
They moved together slowly, lazy, with no harsh thrusts, cursing, or desperation of the night before. Dean kept his eyes closed but grabbed Cas’s hand and pulled it over to hold against his chest. The peaceful nature of the morning contrasted with how fast Dean’s heart raced under Cas’s palm.
Dean yawned behind his hand and cranked the radio louder, passing by a third church as he ticked his speed up, but only just.
happy. The small shift of paranoia earlier had eased itself off as they moved through the day with the people they loved and Cas had visibly seen Dean relax. Sitting next to him, Cas didn’t feel the tension that oftentimes came with the brief shots of that old kind of fear that’d haunt them.
It was an interesting image played out before him and Dean didn’t expect Cas to wear the hat which was bought last minute at the hotel’s gift shop. But he did.
Cas shook his head, “No, I wanted to tell you first.”
