“Dean,” Castiel looked more contrite than Dean had ever seen him. “What you must understand is that Heaven is not what you hunters make it out to be. It’s not unity, it’s politics.” Cas sighed, tiredly. “It wasn’t always like this, though. When God first created the earth, the humans, it was his pride and he wanted every angel to love them just as much as he did. But for thousands of years, we have been left to fend for ourselves, and some angels feel it’s time to question the original orders. You see, angels aren’t without flaw. Some of us might be willing to continue our father's mission but others, they are out to seek power for themselves.” Castiel paused, looking as if trying to decipher Dean’s reaction. “Heaven is divided Dean, but there are still some of us who would fight for you, who would die to protect our Father’s greatest creation.” His right hand had traveled to lay on top of his heart, in what Dean could only interpret as this physical demonstration of earnestness.
“How do you know all this?” Maybe he was pushing his luck, but Curt didn’t seem all that uncomfortable. So Dean smiled encouragingly, a smile he knew made him look less threatening - it had worked in his favor before.
“This smells familiar, somehow,” he kept going, and Dean just nodded along, waiting for him to remember what it could be.
“I’ve just been around a long time. A guy tends to pick up some information along the way, and because I don’t bother with hunting I have a lot of spare time.” Curt looked up with a grin, and Dean could only be baffled by how easy this guy was to get answers out of.
“The constellations, they’re sets of stars, that resemble some design. There are millions of them, and they all have a name” Castiel explained innocently.
“What? Aren’t you hungry?” His dad stared at his puzzled expression and grimaced as if he was doing the most obvious thing in the world. As if this is what they did. As if he was the type of parent to come home, make dinner, and sit and actually eat with his kids.
Thank you for reading chapter 8, as always I hope you enjoyed! Please leave your thoughts in the comments, I love reading them. A huge shoutout to the most amazing beta I could ask for, aka Fred, my amazing friend and talented writer! And again check out wantstoflyafraidtofall on Tumblr for more of their amazing art. I also wanted to add that this chapter has a little nod to a fanfic I wrote years ago! It’s called The stairs sail to the moon, just in case you ever came across that unknown little story and thought you recognized something :)
“What will you be doing?” Gadreel ventured as if the line that separated him from Metatron was still thin enough to speak out of turn. Metatron did not seem to agree.
Castiel was waiting for him by the door, and Dean found himself wondering what the angel was thinking. He wasn’t sure yet if he wanted Castiel to have noticed it or not.
“Metatron” Dean interrupted, “he’s the angel responsible for all of this. We’ve been getting played from the get-go, falling right into his every move.”
The angel looked at him through the iron bars. He glared at him, the intensity making Dean feel like a child again.
There was no other reason an angel would get close to him in the first place. Dean had wondered over and over again why Castiel had chosen him, of all the humans, to manifest himself, and now he knew - this was why. He’d been played and the thought of his father’s
“Sorry, you’re not really my type.” Dean managed to get the cap open and with a swing of his arm, he splashed the demon with holy water.
“Errands for Bobby? Yeah, I’ve been told, and while Bobby seems to confirm your story, I don’t buy it for a second.”
Dean laughed at implications Rufus couldn’t even begin to grasp. “Yeah, right. If only Sam and Jo weren’t lazy fucks, who asked me to get them their guns when I came to get mine.”
But when he looked up he could see that Castiel was smiling again, actually smiling at something that Dean said. And his heart did another one of those involuntary flutters as he decided that he liked it when the angel smiled.
Once again thank you so much for reading this chapter and sticking with this story. Please let me know your thoughts on this chapter, I honestly love reading your comments, they highlight my days.  And don't worry, the next chapters will have some more action going on!
“We’re not sure yet, but it doesn’t bode well for your kind. We believe that someone is feeding false information to your city. Whoever it is, they must be stopped.”
“Oh really?” Gabriel started, obviously about to drop the ‘all bad things I hope’. He was getting predictable after some thousands of years.
“I guess I didn’t want you to forget what happened.” The angel’s fingers brushed over the scar once more, his face cautious. Dean’s heart skipped a beat, which he could easily attribute to the events of the day and how his heart must’ve just been giving out, a small arrhythmia, he was sure, caused by stress, it had to be the cause because if it was anything else, it would’ve been due to what Cas was saying, and that scared him just a little too much to even think. "of course, if you wanted to, I could heal it completely". There it was again.
Cas looked down at their hands, and then his gaze turned back up at him, his mouth opening and closing. It was almost imperceptible, and Dean would have missed it completely had he not been staring at those lips all this time. He waited for Cas to say what he wanted to, he waited until the moment passed and Dean realized he wouldn’t share whatever was on his mind.
It was the first time that Michael had spoken with any type of emotion. And for a moment, Dean looked at him and he couldn’t see all of this, not a celestial being, just a man, shackled to a chair, looking like he’s seen better days, and he thought of Cas. How he was this entity far beyond his comprehension, who just presented himself to him in a human form. He let the idea of Castiel being the one sitting there, tied and hurt, travel through his mind, and he couldn’t stand for it.
as he began to punch, sloppy and carelessly, the bag started hitting him in the arms, his knees giving in a little -
“Yes?” The angel replied, softly, his brow furrowed in confusion, he looked so lost, and before Dean even acknowledged the misunderstanding he found himself so charmed by the puzzled look on Castiel’s face.
“Then I’d like that,” Castiel gave him a smile, but Dean could see it didn’t reach his eyes. He wondered for a moment if he had fucked up completely, and the guilt struck him once again.
“Are you boys all okay over here?” She asked with the phrase  ‘please tip me well’ smitten all over her face.
Castiel managed the bags in his arms as he tried to open the door to the cabin. There had been a longer line than he had expected at the burger joint, he hoped Dean hadn’t already eaten. It had been easy to blend in with the locals from the town, they didn’t even look twice as he passed them to get to the burger joint. Of course, he was still wearing a mix of the clothes Dean had given him and the ones he had acquired himself from a small thrift store - dark jeans, a black shirt, and a grey worn-out flannel-. He had felt pleased when Dean told him to keep his clothes, but they no longer carried the scent of pinewood and leather, no longer smelled like Dean.
“Yeah, I can see that,” Dean said grinning widely. “Did you recreate the North Pole while you were at it?”
“What do I have to gain, telling you this, just to stay here in this putrid cell?” He spat in disgust, eyeing his surroundings. “I am an archangel of the Lord, I have created entire religions, I have sunk entire civilizations and here I sit in my own filth.”
“Workin’ late, huh?” He said, as casually as he could muster. Rufus jerked his neck back to find the voice speaking.
“So you're suggesting we become their slaves?” an angel by the name of Gadreel asked, disgust clearly visible on his face. More angels at the table began to express their discontentment mutually.
He had no idea what would go down tonight, if the angels and hunters would manage to peacefully work things out or if it would turn ugly real quick, and what if Cas would be there? The way he’d been called out so late at night, and how he left in such a hurry, gave Dean a really tight feeling in his gut, like a hand gripping him from the inside.
“You want me to bust you out?” Dean seethed, distrust clear in his voice now. “You seriously expected you’d give me all this talk and I’d buy every word, and happily help your ass out of Alcatraz?” He took a step back, creating more distance between himself and the prisoner, he’d
Relief washed over him and for the second time, he found it impossible to stop himself from pulling the angel close. He sat up and wrapped his arms around Cas, granted it was somewhat of an awkward angle but he couldn’t give a fuck about the pulling ache in his back right now.
“You’re stressing me out, dude,” Sam told him when Dean slid inside the car, gesturing to Sam to do the same. The inside of baby was the perfect place to tell him, this car had held most of his secrets anyway.
To his surprise, Castiel burst out in laughter, a genuine and warm sound that made Dean weak all over again, and he wished he could make Cas laugh like that a thousand times more. God, he was so smitten it was actually disgusting, or it would be, if it wasn’t so damn wonderful. Sam could definitely never hear about this.
“Wow, I mean I’m just confused. Sam Winchester will stop asking questions, wonders never cease to exist,” Dean grinned.
“I don’t understand your reaction.” The angel finally got out and left it at that, until Dean squinted at him, clearly not following. “I thought you despised my kind, I thought you would be at least somewhat pleased at the news, but you seem upset, you even carry guilt for a crime that is not your own.”
“Yeah, really mature,” Sam snatched the beer bottle away from Dean. “And that was my beer,” he smiled sarcastically.
“Look, I do need your help, but I need you here, Sam.” Dean tried again, it wasn’t exactly true, but he was not about to have Sam tag along in a possible suicide mission. When Sam sighed, defeated, Dean took it as an acceptance. “I need you to cover for me with the missing weapons,” and, hell, if Sam was in it, might as well use his skills. “and I need you to figure out how to bust the archangel out without setting off every alarm in the city on me.”
The chair Metatron invited him to sit, had once been the spot where he’d stayed so late with Michael discussing matters of utter importance.
When the shock of all the running and zapping had passed, when the adrenaline had started to fail him, Dean had sat down on the front porch, his legs almost singing in relief. Then, he’d shot Sam a text asking him to come meet him.
The entire garrison of angels had gathered together at the round marble table that was used only once every few thousands of years. The entirety of heaven seemed to hold their breath, figuratively speaking of course, as the last angel to join sat down in his chair.
Nevertheless, he said, “I have planted a seed and it needs watering,” a sly smile accompanied the words, and if Gadreel and Uriel understood what he’d meant, they made no note of it.
“Don’t forget to take a satellite phone,” Sam added, to the already long list of advice, “and call me when you get there, keep updating us.”
“Mornin’ sunshine,” Dean caught them mid-air, burning his fingers the longer he held them, scanning quickly for a plate to put them on.
“I have to tell Bobby, and my mom, and-” Jo continued, there was finally a small hint of panic in her voice, “-probably your dad.”
“Please talk to me,” the words were barely a whisper. From the moment Dean had told him what happened, they had shifted closer together on the couch, their legs were only inches away from touching. Dean was pretty sure Cas was actually able to hear his heart beating this time. And when Cas answered, in the same low voice, it was like the conversation was meant only for them.
The cold breeze made the hair in the back of his neck stand as Dean thought about Jo’s words. He tried to recall the way Cas would look at him, but he could come to no such conclusion.
“We have been patient, given you the chance to release your prisoner, once you’ve realized we mean not to harm you.” A female angel spoke, and the calmness in her voice was unsettling to the hunters.
“Fuck, alright. Let me talk to Cas and I’ll meet you at Bobby’s in an hour. Have Jo send me the picture, by the way.”
"Jo's already met him," Dean spoke up in a poor defense. "Plus I thought this was time-sensitive, wasn’t it?” Dean threw his words back at him, “gotta move, kid. Plus, he’s busy, I’m not sure when he’ll get here.” His mind drifted to Cas, if he was okay, how the gathering of Gabriel’s army was going. If they were fine following him, if they didn’t angry mob him for leaving Gabriel to die.
The next morning he woke, feeling well-rested, for a change, and in a great mood. Prancing downstairs, he decided to grab a quick bite and leave before John woke up, just to check in on Cas.
“So the prey would be the so-called righteous man, and the predator would be this false God, right?” Castiel couldn’t fight the smile that wanted to form on his lips, he knew he was right, but he liked it when Dean proved him right.
Entranced in these thoughts, and under the cover of darkness and solitude, Dean played with the idea that maybe, just maybe, Castiel was messing with him, more than just physically. But that thought was fucked up beyond measure, it would mean denying every truth he knew about angels.
“Sometimes yes, though not all of us have had the occasion.” The angel’s eyes darted to look anywhere but at Dean.
The entire bathroom was filled to the brim with bubbles. The white tile floor was practically covered in water that had overflowed, and the condensation stuck to Dean’s skin, as the seconds passed. He breathed in the warm air and his eyes met Cas’. There they were - a  pair of bright blue eyes staring at him from the white, bubbly, mountain of foam. Castiel looked so lost in the middle of it that Dean couldn’t help but burst into laughter.
John Winchester looked as if he was gonna explode any second, but then his demeanor changed as he looked towards Curt. “Right, well next time come to me. My son doesn’t have any knowledge about these things, and he shouldn’t get any ideas in his head,” John shot his son a look that said ‘
There were three of them, they looked at him with wolflike grins and Dean felt adrenaline rush through his veins. Where had they come from and worse, how did they know he was here? But these questions didn’t matter right now, because now would be the time to fight for his life. He tightened the grip on his gun.
“Hey, dad,” Dean said. He walked into the armory where John, as Dean had predicted, was hunched over his weapons.
Dean cleared his throat, on the list of things that were not appropriate this was way up there with watching porn at a funeral. After that, he tried hard to focus on anything other than Castiel’s lips or the way his eyes squeezed shut every few bites.
“Dean, you’re clearly going through a post-break-up funk,” Sam came closer and leaned on the arm of the chair across from him.
, he actually hadn’t really thought about his nightmare at all today. “No, I think it’s alright, as long as you’re here,” he hadn’t meant to say this last part out loud,  it just slipped from his mouth, the dark felt like liquor in his brain, his inhibitions dropping almost completely. He cursed it for making his words fall out so easily.
While the dinner had certainly taken his mind off things, the (one too many) beers he had provided him with fabricated courage. He had to talk to Castiel again, he needed to know the truth. Dean had about enough of guessing. The strange angel sighting near the city, the unexplainable healing, the mysterious light that haunted his dreams (okay so maybe he did remember his dream). He had to know more, and he had to know
Dean nervously tapped the coffee mug with his fingers. The last thing he wanted was more mention of angels,
“Yeah, I think you’d be the last person an angel would want to be around,” Sam’s banter hit him a little too close to home, and he felt a pang in his chest. He knew his brother was joking, but this was actually something he’d thought over and over again - that he wasn’t worthy of being around an angel, except, every time he was, that feeling disappeared completely, only to creep away again in the night, leaving him to question why this was happening to him, of all people.
This time, though, much like getting Dean food from the place he enjoyed, this was planned. He was guiding them to the lake where they had sat and watched the stars.
Dean quickened his pace, half walking, half jogging. He knew she would ask a million questions and he couldn’t answer any of them.
Dean was surprised to find the information had already spread through so many people even Steve whatshisname knew about it. However, he was even more surprised to find Sam just nodding in agreement, lips pursed and his brow furrowed.
Dean got dressed and made his way downstairs. He could hear Sam and Bobby talking from the kitchen, the smell of coffee filled his nose.
“Dean-” the hunter paused for a moment as if hesitant to disclose his last name, completely unaware of the fact that Gabriel was already privy to it. Castiel hoped his brother wouldn’t say as much, if Dean felt safer in the shade of anonymity, then so be it. “-just Dean”
“Well, great to know that’s all cleared up,” Dean forced a smile. “I’ll see you around, Cas,” and without so much as a reply, the ruffle of feathers let him know he was gone. He rolled his eyes as he tried to push down how much he hated when Cas disappeared like this.
“I’m just saying, I don’t trust the guy,” Bobby’s voice rose out of the noise of glasses clicking, and silverware cutting and scratching plates. “Comes out of nowhere, and suddenly he’s the friggin expert? Smells fishy to me,” he downed his beer over Ellen’s protesting.
Castiel seemed to shut his eyes for a second as if gathering the patience to deal with him, and that notion was like a punch in Dean’s gut.
Dean had seen this question coming a mile away, he had just hoped he could distract Sam long enough not to talk about it. Not to mention that Sam had to take things even further -
“If only it were that easy,” Dean sighed, it probably wasn’t that easy to egg Heaven. He felt grateful for his younger brother’s feeble attempt at making him feel better, but he didn’t think it was working. This wasn’t a post-break-up funk as Sam had called it, this wasn’t a break-up at all. Maybe that’s why it felt so awful, because whatever this was, it was over before it even started.
Amy, the waitress, was leaning against the counter, absentmindedly playing with her hair. Dean coughed to get her attention.
That's when he noticed it, a small puddle of water had formed just outside the bathroom door, seeping through the carpet, giving Dean’s footsteps a soggy sound as he approached the door. “You okay in there?”
he thought, grabbing her wrist gently, and turning her toward him, her back against the door. And when she didn’t flinch or hesitate, he accepted it as
look, he was lucky Dean didn’t just kiss him right then and there, the truth was he was amazing, he was thinking it, and then he was saying it. - Cas had looked so flustered, didn’t speak a word, and even though at the time Dean was just trying to pretend he didn’t say anything, wishing he could take it back not to scare Cas away, eyes on the sky, he could still see him from the corner of his eye, fighting back a smile.
“And I need to be the one to do it” Dean laughed, the seriousness of the matter falling back on the copious amount of alcohol he’d downed at this point “Because you’re an angel and can’t get inside the walls”
from the command center?” Sam’s face was a judging grimace, “right before a war?” he added as if Dean wasn’t aware of the fact.
“You didn’t seem to have any nightmares last night, I wondered if you were still afraid of falling asleep.”
Sam narrowed his eyes, clearly suspicious, “Dean, I feel like we’re backspacing here.” He stopped in his tracks, turning to face Dean, making him stop walking too. “You told me you kissed him, and that you were definitely ‘not together’. And then you go and take a whole vacation together, or whatever. And now you’re telling me nothing happened?” Sam looked about as close to figuring out what was going on as Dean had been feeling for months. “Look if you don’t want to tell me, fine, I’m not going to push you, just don’t bullshit me.”
Dean's elbow rested out of the open window of his precious car, letting the wind hit his face, appreciating the refreshing breeze against his skin. He was driving back into town after the talk, and a million thoughts ran through his mind. The most important of which, finding the mole. Someone inside the city walls was working against them. Couldn’t be an angel, Dean figured, because of the warding - but who the hell could it be, and why? What could a hunter possibly have to gain with this?
“Well good thing we are just after your heart,” As if other werewolves had been waiting on a signal, more of them appeared out of the shadows. There was at least a pack of nine werewolves closing in on him right now.
Before he even reached the room he could sense the feeling of someone looking directly at him. The hairs on the back of Dean’s neck rose up.
“Fine, let’s say I believe you.” Dean could barely grasp he was considering this. “What do you need me for?”
“Dean,” John pinched the bridge of his nose. “You know better than to make ties outside of the wall, it’s never going to work.”
he let himself fall down on the bed finally taking a breath when the godforsaken imagery served its purpose.
Cas stood, leaning against the impala’s trunk. If it were anyone else, Dean would tell him to move the fuck away and grunt something about the paint job he’d just gotten done last summer. But Cas wasn’t anyone else.
“I know humans are prone to comfort each other by touch, so I wondered if this would be a possible way to help with your distress.”
“You know, she wants to engage in sexual intercourse with you,” his expression was blank and his voice that low tone of his, raspy and enunciating every word.
He avoided looking at his eyes, the green eyes that had completely captivated his mind. He wondered what Dean was thinking about at this moment, they hadn’t really said anything since they turned to face each other. His whole body froze when Dean reached out his hand, his fingers lightly brushing against his naked chest before they gently lifted his amulet. He watched as the hunter studied the crystal attentively, his eyes narrowing just a little bit as he turned it over in his fingers. It took everything Castiel had to refrain from reaching out to touch the little crinkles that appeared next to his eyes.
Dean closed his eyes, trying to push aside the memories as he dozed off. In his dream the sky was blue and a soft breeze played with the branches of the trees that surrounded lake Lacua. The lake reflected the blues and greens of the mountains while sun rays created a glimmer over the water.
“No, I haven’t tried those. And I don’t see how food would relate to the contentment in my existence.” Castiel was visibly confused.
After a few dizzying seconds, Dean got a hold of himself and created some distance between him and his assailants, carefully deciding whether he would try to use the demon knife again or would wait for the others to arrive. Dean got a glimpse of one of the demons that was eyeing his movements and noticing his limp before it tried its luck by kicking Dean hard in the upper thigh. A stabbing pain shot through his leg, causing him to fall on his knee while gasping for air.
“As many of you will know, unfortunately, no deal has yet been struck with the humans to release our leader, Michael,” Metatron stated this matter of factly, not a hint of pity or remorse, he didn’t even look bothered by the fact, like Michael was of no importance, just a casualty of the war, as any other, as if he was not talking about their leader, the one they had sworn to follow, the one who had stood with them in the trenches of wars past, and who would lead them into the final one.
In the meantime he reached for his archangel blade, gripping tightly in his fist, ready to fight his way out, if only he stood any chance. By the second, angels appeared at the lake, surrounding him - there was no escaping.
“Okay,” Castiel seemed slightly taken aback by Dean’s request. “Well I remember this place,” the angel’s breath hitched ever so lightly. “This is where I completed my training, every angel in my garrison completed training here, on this exact field.
The headlights of the truck simmered down, and Dean got to his feet when he heard the engine dying. He opened the door to greet Sam, but was immediately taken aback by another presence in the truck.
They ate in complete silence. Dean couldn’t help feeling nervous, he was hoping his dad wouldn’t ask him any questions, like where he’d been when he was away. Iit was one thing to explain to Bobby and Sam he couldn’t tell them everything, they’d respected his judgment, but that definitely wouldn’t fly with his dad. His mind was completely blank of any small talk, he scrambled to think of anything to distract his dad.
“That’s all you got? Usually when there’s bad news people always say, ‘hey wanna hear the good news or the bad news.’ ”
This was an expression Dean could read, it was sadness. And even though Cas didn’t hold him responsible, he still felt the weight of his kind’s actions on his shoulders. He reached for Cas’s hand, his fingers brushed against the angel’s fingers, and Dean hesitated, before resting on top of his, squeezing it gently, trying to find another way to show the angel how bad he felt.
Dean bit his tongue, there were many things he wanted to say and many insults came to mind, but he figured it’d be best if he just didn’t say them out loud. He had imagined this conversation with Michael in his head countless times but never had he thought it would have gone anything like this.
Dean’s words filled the gap between them and before Castiel could process them, the hunter’s gaze was already focused on something else, the smile still there but the edges were softer, his neck bent and head swayed backward, exaggeratedly, to look at the sky.
“We’ve talked about this, Dean. Just, for once, do what I tell you to do, you don’t always need to question every damn order.” And with this last displeased grunt he left, again, as abruptly as he came in.
“Were you really afraid that I was killed at the negotiation?” The mention of the event sent a distress signal throughout his entire body, tensing up. It took a few inhales and as many exhales before he spoke, hushedly again.
“Yeah, I uh- I know.” Dean wasn’t sure he knew, or if he agreed. Maybe he just thought his dad’s ‘best’ was close to a participation trophy at most, and that was being generous.
He and Sam climbed into the Impala before Jo could come up with another reason to tag along. Dean hit the accelerator and turned on the radio while driving them down the familiar road out of the city. The Impala sped past the first of birches that were starting to change into a colorful field against the dark green pines.
“I apologize about the disarray. I was bored. I’m not used to being so long between four walls.” Dean felt his blood cooling inside, as Castiel spoke. Maybe it wasn’t such a big deal, it’s not like he had any secrets in his bag. It was more-so that he was (contrarily to Sam’s beliefs) a neat freak - everything should be exactly as he wanted it to be, which is not to say it had to
The wind blew, coldly, against his coat and the back of his neck, and the smell of pine trees filled his nostrils.
Dean looked back at his brother, who was now fast asleep in the back seat. His long legs looked cramped up against the door and his hair was draped across his face, if it wasn’t for Sam’s near-death experience, Dean would have laughed at the sight.
If he was quick, he could still catch Jo before she left the house, and it was good timing too, Ellen had already probably left to go to the Road House.
Dean felt for his car keys in his pocket. He’d told Sam he’d be there, he had to get going. “Yeah, you do that.”
“He’s the one who arranged for Michael to be captured. He isn’t just an opportunist, he is an actual enemy of Heaven, he orchestrated the capturing of an archangel, and used it to gain power. We’ve been underestimating him.” Cas shook his head, angry. His eyes were wide and blinking furiously, his eyebrows so pulled together that he didn’t know how those eyes didn’t just disappear under them. Cas’s jaw was holding tension, and Dean wondered for a second if he ground his teeth, like him, when he was upset.
Ellen called for the last round and Dean knew if he had any other questions he’d have to decide quickly which one to ask, because it was about to be his last chance, he tried to shake the memory of the closet and think of something to ask.
He trailed the back of her body, letting his fingers get tangled in her hair, pulling it slightly, and let his lips hit hers, his teeth sinking into her bottom lip until she let out a small moan. He took her keys with his free hand, and swiftly found the right one, unlocking the door with ease. She stumbled backward inside, clinging unto him, her arms around his neck. Dean took a look around, trying to find somewhere to do it, and the couch happened to be right ahead. He paused for a moment, to take his shirt off, and went ahead and undid his pants as she got undressed, slowly, eyes on his, seductively. He let his gaze explore her body, pleased with what he saw, his mouth agape.
“Gabriel has been captured on Metatron’s orders,” the anger on Castiel’s face was clear as day. “They figured out he was working against him, they had no right to just take him out of the field. But it’s too late for that, they’ll probably come after me next,-”
The way Cas stared at him burned holes into his entire being, he felt completely naked sitting in this chair, bag of frozen peas in hand, trying his damndest to keep his bottom lip from trembling like it decided to start doing. The longer Cas stared at him, the harder it was to not just wallow in what had just happened. Cas’s silence spoke louder than anything he could say, and Dean’s brain went blank for any witty remarks he could make to lighten the mood, and in reality, he didn’t want to. He was tired of making himself look like an emotionless rock, just so others wouldn’t feel bad.
“You owe me about 50 at this point, kid” the man laughed. Clearly amused at his own joke, and Dean thanked him once again and made his way into the pavilion.
“You think he’s paranoid?” Dean squinted at her over his beer, “Because, I can count in just one hand the number of times he’s been wrong.” He raised his eyebrows.
“I think I can get one. I’m sure his personnel file has a picture, we’ll just get it. I have to go meet Rufus anyway, so I think I can snoop around in there.” Jo assured him.
Dean laughed, “yeah she tried to get the school to call dad, but he wasn’t even around to punish us until days later.”
“You knew?” Dean didn’t know whether to feel relieved or just more conflicted. If Cas already knew and he was still here, with him, that was definitely a good sign, but it could also mean he didn’t have a chance to get mad,
“Now, now, Joshua, why don’t you stop by later. I completely understand your worry and I would hate for us to not see eye to eye. After all, we are on the same side here.”
He gripped himself tight, mimicking the way Cas had held onto his ankle, and a violent shiver went up his spine, pleasure radiating from the tip of his fingers, moving slowly and methodically now, up his entire back and down his legs. He soaped up and kept stroking, abdominal muscles jumping in anticipation, he closed his eyes and his hand was not his anymore, it was Cas’s and it slid up and down his length, Dean let out short and breathless moans that echoed in the bathroom. He licked his lips, hungrily, wanting more, and his mind indulged, images of Cas burned into the back of his eyelids - Cas in his boxers, Cas still sleeping, Cas laughing, Cas’s lips on his and he was back on that night, except this time they’d get further. A sharp moan fell out of his mouth, probably louder than it should be, and he was close,
They continued to follow along the trail, and whenever he glanced at Dean, Castiel knew he had no clue where they were headed - but Castiel did. There was little Castiel did with no intention, he was a strategist, had been for thousands of years, and whatever he did - he planned and theorized in advance, every little detail calculated. - which was something he’d begun losing sight of whenever Dean was around, in his company, Castiel couldn’t plan in advance, he couldn’t predict what the hunter would say or do, and he certainly couldn’t be sure of what would come out of his mouth, even though he tried.
Castiel blushed at the statements, stepping back to create more space between them. And hey, Dean was drunk, and he found the sight of the blushing angel absolutely endearing. He could get lost in Cas’ red cheeks, and maybe he did, because he lost his footing and felt himself stumbling backward – he caught the sides of the angel’s jacket to hold him in place, both hands tugging at his coat and shirt, feeling his heartbeat in his knuckles. “Whoa”
“Huh?” Dean looked over at his brother, startled. “What do you mean? I’m right here, dingus.” He knew he couldn’t keep dodging Sam’s questions, but what would he tell him?
For once Dean was certain that he could read the emotion in Castiel’s eyes, it was sadness. And in that moment he couldn’t feel a single ounce of resentment towards the angel. All he felt was compassion and for some strange reason, he knew that there was a mutual understanding between them. Dean had never excelled in expressing his emotions, and that was an understatement. Yet he knew there was nothing he could say that Castiel wasn’t already able to read on his face. He pursed his lips, swallowing in dry, suddenly very aware of his surroundings, having thought of John, his mind drifted to what his dad would say, or better yet, what he would do to Dean if he even caught a whiff of what was going on. Not that anything was going on, he was just having lunch...
"You have a lovely voice Dean," Castiel had chimed in. Dean turned his head to Castiel, and acknowledged him with a light hum.
It hit Dean why he knew this guy. He was at the bar. He kept looking at Dean throughout his entire shift.
"Absolutely," he patted her arm, "now if you'll excuse me, you're keeping me from my work." He stepped out of the breakroom. She rolled her eyes then followed him out.
"Hey Dean," Pamela had called from over her shoulder. The boy popped up from behind the bar. She tapped her watch and smiled. "It's 9, go on. Get out of here."
Dean sat in the Impala, staring at the midnight sky. He was on a solo hunt. Sam was looking for the Nephilim, Lucifer's kid, Jack. The older hunter sighed heavily as he closed his eyes, he pictured his love. How that died... It was his fault, he pushed him away. Castiel was too good for Dean. The hunter was gone all the time, and the angel was practically invisible to him. The last time Dean saw him was the night he left.
"No, no no no... No, it's fine. It's fine!" He wiped his face and looked up at the dining table. He immediately felt his grief turn to rage. He saw nothing but red. Cas shot up off the ground and almost ran to the table. He grabbed the dishes one by one and threw them onto the hardwood floor. The sound of plates shattering echoed through his apartment.
"What are you talking about, man?" Dean already knew the answer to his own question. He so badly wanted to deny everything that was happening right in front of him. The man was practically begging to be wrong. He hoped with all his might that Cas wasn't going to say what he thought he was going to say. Cas took a few steps closer towards Dean, and he could feel a slight warmth make its way toward him too.
He had, killed Dean before. Not the real Dean. It was training, for this moment. The process was painful yet necessary, Naomi had assured him. But how could he, kill Dean, here and now. He had sculpted Dean from scratch when he pulled him from Hell. In a way, Dean was Castiel's very own creation. He grew to care deeply for him. So killing him... He couldn't.
"Dean," Sam revealed himself from behind the door. "You should get up and start moving around. I think," the younger Winchester saw that his brother had not moved once. " I know what you're thinking about. That's not healthy. I know it hard, but you need to get over him. This is killing you." Dean hummed at the statement.
Castiel had always hoped that, when he finally did share his secret, he'd have a happy ending. That Dean would feel the same and that he could be happy. Happy with no consequences, happy with only more happiness to follow. But it became clear to the angel that he would never get that, so he at least had to tell Dean now so that he knew.
Of all his brothers and sisters, he was, arguably, the one who had mingled the most with humans, always keeping a distance of course,  - he was
“I think this might qualify as the longest day I’ve ever had.” Dean sighed after a long silence, as he took a sip of the beer that swung forgotten by his side loosely held in between two fingers.
“I’m so sorry about that,” a guy Dean knew damn well was none other than Curt Hunter stepped into the office. “I asked him to find me the old rapports on the angel warding. You see I wanted to check if I could possibly update them, having gained some interesting facts since I’ve been gone.”
“You would choose them over your own brothers and sisters? Now tell me, Anna, how isn’t that the highest form of treason, how about we teach you some-”
As he let the hot water rise in the tub, he thought back to all the times he’d done this kind of thing. It felt so foreign to him, meddling in human affairs - if you could even call a bath a human affair, still it was a very human thing to do. Still, Castiel was never one to refuse to try new things, and when Dean had asked him what else he had never tried, this activity immediately popped to mind.
“What I expect from you is not of import, Dean Winchester. It will happen, and I am a patient being.” The calmness in his claim was upsetting, and the hunter crossed his arms as if to raise a barrier of protection between them. “The need to free me lies on your side, as even though I do not wish it, the striking of your people is of little import to me.”
Cas continued, stepping another inch closer, and just like that, he could breathe again. “But I can’t die knowing you love me too.” Cas’s eyes fell to the floor, and Dean thought he looked like he would just break apart now, body slumping down and his frame looking smaller and more fragile than Dean knew it to be. He felt like wrapping his arms around and holding him tight, as if an embrace could fix anything. As if all that was wrong with the world was this distance between them, this cliff of a distance, begging to be crossed, and as if he could do it and the night would fade, and the sun would shine.
“He is-,” Dean felt himself going red. “I don’t have a secret lover,” His fist slamming down next to his plate.
Dean beat him to the punch. “No,” a huge grin from ear to ear, and Castiel saw the pride in Dean, having tricked an archangel with such an infantile joke.
Castiel thought about places where they could meet, and his mind drifted to the beautiful forest where he’d last met Uriel - but of course, it couldn’t be there, - and the way the trees and vegetation provided good coverage. It seemed it had been such a short time ago, and yet at the same time, so much had happened. If he closed his eyes, though, it was easy enough to find himself back there, the sunbeams touching his skin through the tree branches, the smell of wildflowers and rain, -
Dean couldn’t help but notice how Cas was actively trying to avoid catching his eye, a look of caution spread across the angel’s face.
“Uh,” Dean struggled to come up with an answer, great fucking going, Winchester. “Well, I wouldn’t necessarily call it saving him. I just showed up on time to gank the son of a bitch who tried to hurt Sam.”
He ducked at the slap and used the momentum to put all his weight behind his right shoulder and he charged at his dad. John lost his balance, not only because of the force Dean put into it, but also because this was the last thing he was expecting his son to do.
. Luckily, he knew better than to show up unprepared, he fished the lock pick out of his jacket, if there was anything he could do, this was it. He’d been the one to teach Sammy how to do it, and he was yet to find a lock he couldn’t open.  Still keeping an ear out for any footsteps, he crouched down and started on the lock. He opened the small leather case where he kept the tools on the floor next to him, waiting to pick the right one once he’d gotten a good look of the lock - it seemed to be a standard, turn of the century, American lock. Once he got to work, his knees started to ache as it took a lot longer than he’d predicted, and the sweat trickled down his forehead, each second passing making him more anxious someone would catch him.
“Uhm, have you met my mom? Also, I actually grew up a while ago, you just haven’t been paying attention.” Jo laughed and Dean could only nod in agreement, trying not to smile. “And speaking of ice cream,” Jo downright giggled, “what you need, is a palate cleanser, if you really want to get him off your mind.”
Dean looked up to find Castiel crouched down in front of him, he hadn’t realized he was on the ground too. But before he could think about it he threw himself into the angel, needing to make sure this was real, that Cas was really standing there, to feel him in his arms.
before he managed to maneuver his head around the blade, even as it burned his skin as it pressed down with the motion, to find Cas fighting off two other angels.
“Dean you know perfectly well it’s called the Shady Lady, you even introduced me to the lady in question - Andrea, she is very nice.” Castiel gave him a quizzical look. “And no, I’ve been in Heaven, there were matters that needed attending to.”
Heat pooling on the low of his stomach, his skin crawling with craving, taking too much effort just to not let himself wrap his arms around Dean.
“Please, you say that about everyone” Castiel rolled his eyes, still trying to figure out where exactly they were. Water surrounded their long rowboat, a few miles ahead he could see the emerald green water slowly chiseling out a rocky cliff by crashing against it. “Where are we?”
“I might not know him, but I do know you, and I know that this is what you do, Dean. You find something good and let yourself ruin it before it even starts, just so you won’t have to deal with being hurt.” Sam reached out his hand, and instantly this whole thing felt way too personal, and Dean had just had about enough. Enough talking, enough feelings, just
“Yeah, I guess so,” Dean followed his gaze. There were barely any clouds above them and even though it was cold outside the stars were clearly visible in the midnight sky.
Bobby laughed and Dean couldn’t help but join him. They stayed there for hours talking about demons over cheap beers and whiskey. Dean didn’t bring up Michael or the box like he had planned to, he felt bad to ask Bobby. He would just have to ask around somewhere else, maybe The Roadhouse?
“Thank you,” the angel shuffled on his feet and Dean could see the wings disappear again from the corner of his eye, in a rustle that he knew all too well, but was seeing for the first time.
, he practically knew it by heart now, but in this moment, he couldn’t find it in himself to be angry about it, to be worried. He couldn’t give a single damn anymore.
“You spend too much time on that laptop, what are you reading this time? How to get a girl to fall for you in ten easy steps?’
Something inside of him was telling him to wake the hell up. That there was definitely something wrong here, but Dean couldn’t reason with the warmth that was now relaxing his entire body and it didn’t take long before he dozed off.
“I guess there is no need for pleasantries anyway. As much as we would love to simply wipe their city off the map, this plainly goes against the last wishes of our dearest father, hallowed be his name.” Metatron paused for a second, as if the mention of God was too much for him to bear. To all intents and purposes, Father Dearest’s wishes  would always be his endgame.“I would say we have to try and strike a deal with the hunters, find out what they want in return.”
,  and fired it without hesitation. There was no way the statue was able to dodge the rocksalt bullet in time, Dean thought. But the smug smile on his face faltered quickly because whatever was standing in front of him didn't appear to be faced by the bullet one bit.
It was strange how something that he had imagined a few (too many) times, in the lone hours of the night, could somehow still feel so different from what he had imagined it could be. He had never pictured the way Cas’s lips would taste like summer rain and the smell of homemade iced tea on a warm sunny day. He somehow tasted exactly like Cas, in such a specific way Dean couldn’t even put into words, but could never forget now. He had never experienced the way his own lips seemed to tingle with desire, like static and stars and the feel of sand between his toes; and never in a million years he would he have pictured the somersaults his stomach seemed to be making like he was falling from the sky - that weird feeling right before falling asleep - or the way gravity no longer made sense, because his entire body was being pulled towards Cas, and he didn’t even know which way was up anymore.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean smiled encouragingly, hoping it would let Cas know that he was done questioning his intentions. It seemed to work because Castiel reciprocated the smile briefly before concentration took over his face.
“I have an army to command, Dean. They need guidance. This time tomorrow I could be dead, they need to know what to do when that happens.” Cas’s voice remained steady and low, matter of factly, like he wasn’t just speaking of his impending demise. The thought of it made Dean sick to his stomach.
Castiel had been there for the first human civilizations, the greeks, the Romans, the Phoenicians, and the Mayans, and if ever was a time when he felt close to these creatures, it was now. He’d spent some time roaming among them, he’d tried their ways and customs, and he’d liked the way it felt to be among them. With every second he passed on earth, more emotions and feelings seemed to develop. It made it harder to think clearly, like a soldier, again.
He looked over at his brother who gave him the classic Sam face for “I have no idea”. He would definitely have to ask Bobby about this later.
He didn’t get anything but a sort of grunt of agreement. He wondered if Cas was finding this as difficult as he was, after all the angel probably considered him a friend too.
it, and he knew that it was wrong, he knew that he had to fight it with all his strength. This wasn’t how angels were supposed to be.
Dean swallowed the piece of pie on his fork before looking at her very seriously. “About that guy, I was with the other day, could you not mention him to my dad, or your mom, or anyone for that matter?”
Dean decided getting up was probably better for the conversation they were about to have. He went to lean against the wall across from his dad, where he could watch John better. His dad looked tired, there were bags under his eyes and his shirt was filled with multiple stains, his hair was a mess and he was unshaven, judging by the look of it he had been for days.
Dean did his best attempt at looking terribly offended. Cas seemed amused by it. “Do you want me to share the conclusion I was mentioning this morning, or are you going to keep boasting?”
Dean cursed again under his breath, to the empty room. Why would Sam put that damn thought in his mind? He couldn’t shake it off.
Dean felt the blood drain from his face. Next to him, Sam sat up a little straighter on the couch, they both knew what was about to come.
“How about you put down the instruments for a little while, it is getting rather dull,” Michael said to his torturer as he moved his head to get a strand of hair out of his face.
“Yes, that is the general idea. Metatron held a closed quarters meeting with his inner circle, he is hunting down the culprit.” Gabriel’s eyes narrowed. “That is, of course, if you believe it he wasn’t the one to do it.”
“Right,” Dean sighed. “Angel secrets.” Damn angels and their strict policies, maybe next training should be to get the sticks out of their asses. Dean had never quite understood why a lot of their books on angels could only be accessed by higher ranks. It was supposedly dangerous information, did this mean angels would kill anyone who obtained information about them?
“Who you were expecting.” Gabriel interrupted. “Sorry to disappoint Castiel, but one can never be careful enough these days you see.”
Cas looked puzzled as if he didn’t really comprehend what Dean was saying, until he did, and then his expression shifted, becoming harder, his fists clenching and breath heavy -
“Come with me outside.” If he was going to tell Sam anything, it sure as hell wouldn’t be where his dad could hear them if he magically woke up from his bourbon-induced sleep.
Turning to one at a time, he decided the fight was over. “You get to stop being treated like a kid, when you start acting like a man, Samuel.” He then looked at Dean “And you, speak to me like that again, I swear it’ll be the last thing you decide to do. Stop moping around because you don’t get a seat at the table! Use your head, you know why you don't get a seat at the table? Because you’re immature, you’re not cautious, you’d rather chase some tail in town and out us all at risk, than to just stay put and doing what you’re told”
Sam’s voice on the other end of the line sighed in relief. He could hear Bobby shouting something in the back-
Through closed eyes, he could still notice the blue light growing brighter, and Dean couldn’t help but notice how beautiful it was. The light that had haunted his dreams, his memories, and his thoughts for years, it was like a stranger in familiarity. He was no longer afraid of the rush that came over him as the light grew unbearably bright, he was in awe.
This wasn’t a side of Dean Castiel got to see much of, the apprehensive and overcompensating jokes side. It was absolutely entrancing to him. “Of course if he does decide he doesn’t like you and tries to kill you, I’ll try to step in and stop him from doing so.”
Dean was just reflecting on how much he hated running when Sam stepped through the door. His hair was kept out of his face by one of those eighties-looking headbands and Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
” Sam had always talked about being a lawyer, if he wasn’t a hunter, and in that moment Dean could see him, all dressed up and giving final allegations in court. “Plus, we need someone up higher in the ranks, it’s going to be damn useful if anything goes wrong and you just end up stuck in there with an archangel. Or worse, in the vents.”
“It’s not working--” Cas was panting, biting down on his bottom lip as he most likely thought of another solution. Gabriel was still hanging there, unmoving, giving no signs of life. “we have to run, we can’t save him if we’re both dead.” finally something rational coming out of Cas’s mouth.
“However, if I should find out that this is going to be used against me, I will have to take matters into my own hands, and that matter includes not only your little pets, but also you.”
Dean felt his blood run cold as all of the puzzle pieces clicked together, how had he not thought of this before? How had he not noticed that the mole had been right in front of him this whole time, playing him like a puppet. Fuck, this was a new level of stupid, ever for him. Every question Curt had perfectly answered, that time Curt had saved his ass from trouble, the way he pretended to be an angel hunter, when in fact he was an actual angel, Dean felt infinitely stupid. He made sure to add Curt, or whatever his name was, to the growing list of angels he would gladly take out if he would ever get the chance.
“I’m coming with you,” Sam turned his back on him, and ran downstairs, presumably to put some shoes on and get his own gun.
“What did you just say to me, boy?” His eyes squinted and his eyebrows lowered, nostrils flaring. He was giving Dean an out,
“Everything in order, then?” Dean could hear Barnes asking the stranger. The three men were walking toward the exit but stopped before going their separate ways.
“This must be where they’re hiding all the important stuff,” Dean whispered, right above his ear,  his voice full of something that Castiel recognized as sarcasm.
John turned to look directly at Dean, there was no worry in his expression; just anger and determination. Dean supposed he’d know this was coming but a part of him had hoped it wouldn’t.
He’d gone to Bobby’s first, expertly managed to avoid spilling the beans, distracting him with the mention of Cas in the same terms he’d told Sam. Bobby seemed to be satisfied with the reason for Dean’s recent behavior changes, attributing them all to this ‘
Gabriel laughed too, looking at Dean as if he’d found a worthy opponent, and something in Castiel stung, as he watched Gabriel and Dean maintaining eye-contact.
From the corner of his eye, Dean could see that his younger brother was eager to jump in and defend him. Sam wasn’t nearly as obedient as Dean when it came to their father, which had been the cause of many heated arguments between him and John. Dean shot him a warning look, he didn’t want any more fighting tonight than necessary.
He’d been sitting, on the curb by the motel parking lot, for about an hour now, just sulking about the way his night turned out. He felt sorry, he truly did, for the girl, whatever her name was. He couldn’t wrap his brain around what’d happened.
When she got her keys out again, in a huge ring of maybe thousands of keys, it seemed, Dean sighed, exasperated once more.
, but-” he noticed Cas’s look. “That works too,” Dean nodded and quickly went into explaining what Bobby had told him, even though there wasn’t much to go on.
“I mean- everything,” he didn’t really know what he even meant by everything, partly he was just referencing being this close to someone, sharing the parts of themselves that not many other people had seen before, and somewhere the everything linked to being this physically close to someone.
Cas sat on the couch of the cabin. He looked like he’d gotten comfortable. One leg stretched over the couch, and the other one dropped on the floor, he was half sitting, half laying down, an open book, laying on his chest, as if he had been reading it when Dean walked in.
“Dean,” a sudden voice startled him so much he almost gave himself whiplash by how fast he turned around. “what reason could you possibly have for trying to open the
“You’re okay,” Dean managed to say in between relieved breaths. He felt incredibly stupid for being so dramatic, but he was so damn grateful that Cas was okay. He tried to focus on his breathing and as long as he could keep looking at Cas nothing bad could happen to them.
He’d never heard anything quite so powerful, quite so vulnerable. It was enthralling and heartbreaking all at the same time. And if it wasn’t so damn sad, Dean was sure he would be jumping out of his own body with happiness.
It was still the early afternoon, and Dean already felt like he’d been up for a week. It was bound to be a long-ass day. Jo made coffee for them and tossed two frozen pizzas in the oven for lunch. Sam had covered the entire table in blueprints and was making post-it notes to stick over some parts. Dean watched over his shoulder and felt a sort of pride in his brother. Not a whole day had passed since he’d asked him to figure out how to bust Michael out, and the kid had already gotten more done than he had in the past few months.
“Dean…” Cas whispered, turning his head, to look away, and immediately Dean felt the cold absence of Cas’s eyes on him. “What do you want from me?” Cas sounded defeated, and Dean hated it, how he made it sound as if he wasn't the one breaking his goddamn heart.
Dean’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. His jeans were covered in claw marks and blood, his own blood most likely. Though that wasn’t the part that surprised him, with the severe pain he was in just seconds ago Dean expected to see a lot more than dried up blood and torn clothes. But there were only scratches on his legs, well scratches and an inexplicably large and nearly healed wound that he had never seen before. It was as if the werewolf had attacked his legs several days ago instead of hours.
"How about we just make you pay?" John Winchester called from behind the angels, his face smug and his eyes filled with hatred. As if on cue, five more hunters, including John, drew out blades identical to the one Barnes was still holding, its surface now covered in red, and slowly, one by one, all the hunters in the circle followed, blades glistening in the dark.
“Anyway, what do you want to do about our little Don Juan? Since we didn’t find anything useful back at the club.”
Suddenly it wasn’t so cold, as he felt the warmth of Castiel’s body next to his, barely touching. He tried not to look at him.
So instead he took a quick shower and made his way to the old outpost cabins, where he would be far away from prying eyes.
“So you kissed him,” it wasn’t a question, and Dean hated the look of pity on Sam’s face. “Why is that so bad?”
Dean looked up from the couch, the bag of frozen peas pressed against his face, every expression that he tried to form hurt like a motherfucker, and he was sure that right about now he was swelling and looking worse than a day old roadkill squirrel. He hadn’t gone to look in the mirror, or even wash his face, he’d decided that icing it was the priority.
“He will be fine, he just needs to rest.” There was something different about the angel’s voice, it sounded winded.
He tried to keep his eyes closed, and just focus on Cas’s breaths, counting them like sheep. If he just kept listening to his breathing, he could fall asleep fully sure that Cas was alive and well and maybe he wouldn’t dream about those horrible images again.
“Please tell me it’s not about some girl,” John followed his question with this one, disappointment lining his words - but Dean felt a rock lift off his shoulders, his dad had no idea what was actually going on, which meant, this would go over much easier. Still, he needed to find Jo and get ahead of the game.
“Is that what you think of me?” Disbelief dripped from his voice, and he hoped Castiel could hear through those words he was actually saying. “I would
Dean sat on a log, facing the lake. He’d gotten to the place they set up, a little earlier than he’d intended, so it made sense that Castiel was nowhere to be seen.
“And how are we going to do that? You can't just march into town, you’re basically a poster boy for angels.”
When he finally managed to stand upright it took all his strength to evenly distribute the weight on both legs.
“And why would someone of your kind follow me around?” Dean asked angrily. This didn't make any sense, but could it be lying? Dean was still hoping the figure would laugh, and that everything was nothing more but a cruel trick on his mind.
They rolled into the parking lot of a road-side motel. Dean pulled the handbrake, the noise popping the thought bubble he’d been in. He took a look to his right, eyeing the angel in the passenger seat. He was still in the hunter gear Dean had given him the other day. He had his eyes closed, and Dean wondered for a moment if he could be sleeping, but quickly gathered he wasn’t. If there was something Dean could remember from class, it was that angels didn’t need to sleep.
“So I’ve heard,” Curt seemed to consider the offer for a second. “Yes, I think I’ll join you, there isn’t much else to do around here anyway.”
“No that was all, I’ll come back for the files, it can wait till the morning.” Curt smiled, “Dean if you don’t mind dropping me off at my cabin? I’ve had an exhausting day and my feet are killing me.”
Dean furrowed in confusion, waiting for clarification, but before Gabriel could speak, his face lit up like a light bulb. “Michael is an angel, not a man.” Castiel’s chest filled with a sense of pride in this human,
“Yes, I’ll keep checking in here and leave notes inside the Vonnegut book,” Castiel repeated his instructions.
Dean put his hand against the window and peered inside. There clearly hadn’t been anyone at this particular garage in ages. Nearly every single shelf was empty covered in dust, with the exception of a few shelves that carried mechanics tools and spare tires. The place looked overall grubby, and empty beer cans and torn-up magazines littered the floor.
If he just managed to fall back asleep somehow Cas would be next to him again. The heat of his body would make Dean’s skin crawl again, aching to reach out, and he would. He’d trace along the lines of Castiel’s body and watch him get little goosebumps where his fingers touched the skin, which was strangely human, but he wasn’t complaining. He would get to watch the way that Cas’s crystal flickered with blue every time it touched his skin and the way it made his eyes appear even bluer and-
There was little space between them, barely enough for another person to squeeze through, maybe. “What are you thinking about?.” Dean licked his bottom lip leaving a streak of glistening saliva, making it look redder and plumper, and Castiel realized he was staring.
Dean’s hand reached out to touch it, a small smile creeping up on his face at the memory of an 8-year-old Sam giving it to him on Christmas morning all those years ago.
“Militarization?” Was it really that bad? The city was basically a ghost town, sure, but Dean hadn’t seen any military-grade equipment in the streets. Was that what the trucks were carrying? What kind of military gear could even work on angels? He gave it another minute of thinking and reached the more logical conclusion that it was probably food, nonperishables, and such, they were probably expecting a siege around the city, considering angels couldn’t breach the warding.
