Dean did. He took a breath, then another, and then after a moment, he started realizing that a little smut on TV wasn’t anything worth getting upset over. In fact, after another few breaths, while looking Cas in the eye, he seemed to have forgotten what he was upset about at all.
Somewhere in the back of Dean’s mind, he knew he should be questioning all this. But the majority of his brain seemed to have turned to static sometime around the time that Cas had slipped his long fingers into the knot of his tie and tugged on it, his head tipping back to expose his throat. Everything he’d done since then was on autopilot.
“I wonder… how does it taste?” Cas murmured. “Is your mouth salty? Buttery from the popcorn? Is there still a trace of sweet vanilla or cinnamon?” His fingers slid out again, but didn’t return. Instead, he brushed his fingertip along Dean’s lip again.
His mind flashed back to the restaurant. Dean had squirmed in his seat, kinda like Castiel felt he needed to right now, although he was fighting it tooth and nail. And just like that, problem number three fizzled into nothing, because it wasn’t just his age-old, one-sided longing for the man he had rescued from hell. It wasn’t just his vessel reacting. It was Dean and him, and something they
A small gasp escaped Cas as he recalled the sensation, of not just the physical, but the unexpected jolt of power when Dean had obeyed the simple, non-verbal command and stayed absolutely silent for him. The most recalcitrant person to ever walk the Earth, and all it took was a touch for him to be Cas’ for a few blissful moments.
“It’s no wonder you almost died, Dean. You can’t use a taser in a watery environment without significant risk to yourself. The traditional method is-”
“You’re doing so well, Dean.” And just like this the slide over Dean’s cock got easier as more fluid leaked along the shaft. Cas tightened his grip and watched Dean flush crimson, his head resting against the back of the couch, exposing the thick muscles in his neck, chest heaving. So lovely. So beautiful.
rather… shocking.” Dean grinned, waiting for a laugh. Sam scowled at him. Dean didn’t let up. “You really gotta put your
Dean stood up abruptly, collecting the pizza boxes and empties. “I’ll be right back,” he said. He carried the trash to the kitchen, stuffed the leftover pizza into one box and crammed it into the refrigerator, then grabbed two more beers in each hand. He took a breath, reminding himself that his mom was still ‘figuring things out’ or whatever, and plastered on a grin before heading back to the map room.
He wanted so much, so much he was almost shaking with it. He wanted to look at Cas, to touch him, to be touched in return. He wanted to see Cas flushed with pleasure, with happiness. He wanted to see him come, to see him wrecked, to undo that angel composure. He wanted so many things, and he didn’t know how to say it.
Dean nodded. His whole body was flushed, lips swollen, hard cock begging for attention, and truth be told, Cas wanted nothing more than to see Dean come undone. But there was this tiny part that loved the way Dean, for once, did as he was told, so he said, “I’ll use my hand. That’s what you want, yes?”
Cas had had carnal relations with women which had involved significantly more touching, and yet, they paled in comparison. Maybe it was because this was a man? Or maybe...oh, who was he kidding, it was because this was Dean Winchester, and Cas wanted more. More of whatever this was. But how? He couldn’t very well put his finger on Dean’s lips whenever he said something stupid which would admittedly be very frequently, but even Dean wasn’t that dense. He would know something was up. No, this involved careful observation...and subtlety.
“Close, Dean.” Dean closed his mouth around Cas’ finger, and Cas just… pushed it further in. Up to the second knuckle. He held it there for a moment, then slid it almost all the way out before pushing it back again. Dean couldn’t help but to suck on it.
“I’ve always wanted to… to trace the path of your tongue. Learn the shape of your mouth, not just by sight, but by feel, by…” He paused. “Hm. May I?”
“What’s it look like?” He deliberately took his time to remove his trenchcoat and draped it neatly over the back of his chair, giving it an affectionate stroke before he sat back down. He folded his hands in front of him and smiled sweetly, “Swallow, Dean.”
“I’m an angel, Dean. My hands are always perfectly clean and hygienic.” He wrapped his fingers around the handle of his beer mug and took a drink.
“Dean, have I ever told you about how one of my vessels ended up in all four corners of the Akkadian Empire at the same time?”
Dean finally dropped his gaze from Cas’ to his lap, where he unbuckled his belt with shaking fingers, managed somehow to pop the button and slide the zipper down. Cas lifted his hips helpfully, and Dean grabbed everything, pants, boxers, the works, and tugged it down to Cas’ ankles, where it caught on his boots. Cas’ cock sprang up in front of his face, thick and long, and Dean’s mouth watered. But he waited.
There was no way Cas could move right now or Dean would get an eyeful of what all that ice cream eating had done to him, and he wasn’t sure whether their friendship would survive the fallout. So what could he do? Stall! He had to distract Dean somehow.
problem. Dean had been aware he’d felt something a little… other… than friendly towards Castiel for a long time now. Since Purgatory if not even longer. Maybe even the first time he’d seen him, blasting into that barn in a shower of sparks, radiating a kind of otherworldly power that had terrified Dean, but had also sent a thrill of electricity down his spine that had never really gone away, even with everything that had happened between them in the years since.
He ran his tongue along the back of his teeth. Cas’ finger was right there, just there, and he opened his teeth a little, pushed his tongue forward, it was so close, he would find out how Cas
Dean let his lips part a little more, his heart pounding in anticipation. He watched Cas, but Cas’ eyes were on his mouth, his gaze rapt. He slid the tip of his finger into Dean’s mouth, pushed past his teeth, and rested it on his tongue, paused there for a moment, before stroking lightly.
“Well, eh... CHEERS!” Dean practically shouted before his throat working furiously as he drained half the mug in one long draft.
Without taking his eyes off Dean's lips, Cas reached for the salt and handed it over, their fingers brushing together for a brief moment.
“Y-y… okay.” His tongue swiped along his bottom lip again, and Cas followed it with his fingertip. He caught Dean’s lip on the edge of his finger and tugged slightly.
Sam had a fresh stack of books waiting for them in the library, so they spent the afternoon poring over old tomes full of angel lore. Dean was trying to read a faded text of tracking and summoning spells, but he wasn’t having much luck concentrating due to the way Cas sat across from him running his fingers down the text in the book he was looking at.
The static only got louder when Cas stepped in front of him again, the dish in one hand and the spoon in the other. “Open up,” the angel rumbled, and Dean obeyed, his eyes wide, not even questioning how unusual this was, as Cas started spoon feeding him ice cream.
“Awesome,” Dean said softly with a strange facial expression Cas could not decipher because Dean looked everywhere but him all of a sudden, one hand gripping his beer as if his life depended on it while the other hand had not so casually fallen out of view below the table, presumably into Dean’s lap.
“Jody!” Sam yelled, dropping to his knees beside her. He pressed his hands against the wound, uncaring of the pooling blood. Jody’s eyes flicked to Sam’s face and she wanted to be at home with her girls.
The Winchesters refrained from hunting after that, other than the most desperate cases or those within a day’s drive. Castiel remained behind whenever they went, refusing point blank to step outside the bunker. He knew they were afraid to leave him, whether because they thought he’d run out on them and destroy something or because they thought he’d jump in the Mal’ak box as soon as it was finished, regardless of whether they were there or not. Rationally, he knew they stayed close simply because they wanted to spend his last days on this world with him. It was touching and Castiel wanted to take comfort in it, but he couldn't. Another reason to hate the Mark.
Vetala were dangerous, agile. Castiel insisted the brothers move on one house together while he handled the other one.
Her girls. Claire. Jody was mother to her now; it was clear how much Claire loved her, underneath her bluster. And here Castiel was, destroying another iteration of Claire’ family.
The hunts continued. The Winchesters looked more and more run-down, exhaustion pulling at their souls. They started to get sloppy, making mistakes that translated to injuries. Which, in turn, translated to that same anger in Castiel and the abrupt and bloody end of the hunt.
The surfaces in Jack’s room were covered in dust, a sign of how long they’d been away from the bunker. But the bed was neatly made and it was there Castiel went, lying down on his side and curling in tight.
If anything, Dean held tighter. He must be able to see the fight in Castiel’s face, but he didn’t seem the least bit afraid. “I ain’t doing that, Cas.”
The Castiel of now, the one with the Mark, only barely registered that care. He knew it was there, knew that well of compassion ran deep in Sam. But all he could hear was false promises, desperation, and condescension. As if Castiel was some child, some burden, that Sam had deigned to care for.
The drive back to the bunker was silent as a graveyard. Castiel picked quietly at the blood beneath his nails. He only washed it away with a lick of his grace as they pulled into the garage, too ashamed to let the Winchesters see it.
Dean was so goddamn stubborn. Castiel shoved him hard into the truck, sharp enough to push a grunt from Dean. “There is nothing to figure out,” he snapped. “This is it, Dean.” He choked on his next words, but forced himself to say them. “I’m a monster.”
At first, he worked in secret. But the bunker was only so large, and the Winchesters knew every inch of it. It didn’t take long for them to find it.
But it only takes so long to build anything, even something as powerful as the Mal’ak box. The day finally came when Castiel’s work was finished.
Dean snorted too, then suddenly shot Castiel a worried look. “Actually, it is. You sure you got Chuck locked down tight?”
“A failsafe,” Castiel said. Dean stared at him and Castiel was unsurprised to see the spark of betrayal there.
And there were days when both joy and grief seemed far from his mind. On those days, everything seemed an irritant, whether it was Dean handing him a coffee he knew tasted like molecules to Castiel, or Sam making a reference to a TV show he must have known Castiel had never seen. It was the Mark, Castiel knew, creeping through his being like a virus. He did his best not to snap at the Winchesters on those days, the knowledge that they would understand and forgive him for it just another in a long list of petty aggravations. Instead, he’d take himself out to the fields that surrounded the bunker and sit staring angrily at the sky, rubbing the Mark hard in a vain hope of relieving its effects through the pressure. Eventually, the anger would fade and Castiel would return to the bunker and Sam and Dean’s relieved faces.
Castiel moved to the Mal’ak box and climbed awkwardly inside. He laid himself down on his back, staring at the ceiling until the Winchesters’ faces appeared above him. Sam reached in, touched his arm gently. Dean looked at him mutely for a long moment, then leaned over to turn Castiel’s face towards him. He stroked his fingers through his hair, traced a thumb over his eyebrow and down his cheek. Finally, he kissed him, holding his face like something precious.
They’d narrowed down the location of the potential vetala den to two old buildings along the river, squatting within eyesight of each other. It was unclear which one the vetala pack was in, so they’d have to hit both simultaneously, to avoid spooking the monsters and having them escape.
“Dean,” Castiel said again, reaching up to hold Dean’s face. He thumbed the tears away and Dean met his eyes. “I’m so sorry.”
The shape of Castiel’s Mark was a mirror opposite of the one Dean had borne. Instead of blood-red, it was a deep black, like the void itself etched into his skin and echoing through his grace.
He took a deep breath, took one step forward, and was stopped by a hand grabbing his shoulder. Dean pulled him around and stared at him with such devastation he could hardly bear it.
As always, the Mark surged forward at the taste of anger. “Yes, I do,” Castiel snapped, biting back the vitriol of the Mark. Now was not the time, godammit. He wanted to say goodbye properly. “Dean, you’ve seen what I’ve done. I-I have no control.” He stared at Dean; Dean knew all this, intimately. He knew this was for the best, he just wasn’t letting himself see it right now. “I will burn the world before the end.”
When the three of them returned home, Castiel turned toward the Mal’ak box. Neither of the Winchesters interrupted him.
Castiel watched him fondly, the way he was fighting to keep his eyes open, the way his cheek squished against his arm. “It appears so.”
Dean’s face shattered anew. “But I love you,” he said and he sounded as lost as a child, “I love you.” He leaned his forehead against Castiel’s, cupping his cheek in his hand. Then he pressed a soft kiss to Castiel’s lip, brief but still the sweetest thing Castiel had ever tasted.
Castiel sighed, raised his hands to cover Dean’s. “The only way to keep God bound is through the Mark. And the Mark needs a bearer to stay secure.”
But it turned, as everything always did now. He thought about Jack, thought about watching Jack as he read a book in his room and the image shifted. Jack was in his room, but he wasn’t reading. Instead, he was burning his pet snake to ash.
It wasn’t all perfect of course. Sam and Dean both had quiet days when Castiel could see their many griefs pressing on their souls more harshly. Castiel had those days as well, when it seemed all he could do was look around the bunker and see Jack’s absence. He would spend those days in Jack’s former room, going over every memory he had of the boy he’d taken as his own, until he felt strong enough to get up again.
He’d sit himself down with a book at night, curled in the armchair of the Winchesters’ motel room, and only be able to focus on the words on the page for a few short minutes before his mind wandered to the last fight, or the one before that, or one from years ago. He would turn it over from every angle, relive the thrust of the blade in his hand as it punctured flesh, the sight of one of his siblings burning out before his eyes, and the Mark would twist inside him with glee. He would only escape it when Dean startled him from his thoughts by shaking his shoulder, the night having passed without him noticing.
He opened his eyes and the first thing he saw was Dean, staring at him with wide, worried eyes. “Dean.”
Dean’s face twisted. “Then let it burn!” He grabbed Castiel with both hands, fisting the front of his coat tight.
, Castiel thought wryly, as his Father shrank to the smallest of dots and winked out completely with an earth-shattering boom.
He left the war room, silent behind him, and went where he always did when all he could feel was despair.
The moment Sam crushed the spell, God threw his head back with a cry. His eyes started to glow, his limbs started to shake, and beyond that, beyond this small vessel he’d crafted for himself, Castiel could see his trueform–massive and incomprehensible even to him–start to contort. It was drawing back from its edges, an implosion contracting ever nearer to an infinitesimal point in space. Castiel squinted into the growing light, dimly registering Sam and Dean crying out and covering their faces, the shaking of the casino around them, the slot machines toppling over.
Castiel smiled, and found that it came easy for the first time in a long time. “It was my pleasure.”
And Castiel and his rage, flying high in the wake of his kill, disagreed. He watched that boy die and only when the light went out of his eyes did he move further into the den.
What happened was this: Castiel took down a vampire and saw an unexpected movement out of the corner of his eye. He reacted, sweeping his angel blade around in one clear stroke, and stabbed Jody through the chest.
Dean nodded, but Castiel could see it was a gesture of relief, not agreement. Dean had never let anything go without a fight, not his brother, not his car. Castiel used to think he was the one exception to that rule, an implicit signal of how little esteem Dean held him in. But looking at Dean now, the way he let Castiel hold his face with no fear, the pleading and relief in his eyes, the grip he still had on Castiel, he had to wonder if maybe he’d been wrong all these years, to doubt.
"Yes, I think breaking someones nose would have an adverse effective on your hand" Cass stated rolling his eyes.
While the self proclaimed 'ghoul boys' were chatting amongst themselves, Dean thought it would be a good time to dip out and check back in with Sam and Jack back at the bunker.
The room fell silent as the group regained their collective breath after getting roughed up by the Lemp family ghosts.
"You're talking as if I'm Andre the giant! I'm six four it's not that uncommon of a height" Shane argued.
"Dean, I can be helpful! I found the case why won't you let me help" Jack said with hurt in his eyes.
"It's true, you're a very dedicated individual  who can accomplish anything when you put your mind to and you deserve success" The Angel assured him of his sincerity in the current situation.
"Look I know you think I'm just like the other demons but I despite that I actually have a conscious unfortunately, so yeah I emphasise with your messed up life" Shane admitted to them.
"Great! See you two tomorrow over breakfast we can answer any of your pressing questions after I get my five hours. Night you two" Dean waved to Ryan and Shane as he headed up the stairs after swiping the keys to a suite from behind the front desk.
He wasn't going to justify the demons stupid question with an answer, but then he went silent for a moment thinking to himself. He had never really thought about actually having a wedding, let alone a honey moon. This life wasn't the white picket fence and apple pie type, so it had never occurred to him that he could ever have that. He and Cass had basically skipped the whole marriage step and went straight to basically being co-parents to Jack. Maybe they could still do the whole wedding thing? It's never too late really. Or is it?
"Okay I'm not saying you're wrong but, statistically speaking it's gonna be the guy who doesn't show their face on camera right" Sam insisted, totally saying that Dean was wrong but doing it nicely.
"No Dean you're somehow in perfect health, apart from your liver but that's not news to anyone" Cass informed him.
"Ah yes Val Kilmer portrayed them, in the film with the guns and tuberculosis" Cass recalled this particular movie night extremely well because Dean cried (a lot) when Holliday died in the end, a rare sight in the bunker.
"Okay I think you're onto something kid" Dean sighed tired from working the vamps nest case. He didn't think he'd be back in the saddle quite so soon after wrapping the last case up. He wasn't getting any younger that's for sure. All he wanted was to have a shower and go to sleep, but when duty calls he had to answer.
This night just kept getting better and better, Dean thought to himself as the ghost woman shouted abuses at him.
Dean lifted the rug to see their spray paint was gone "So that's what was taking you so long out there" he sighed, realising how much time they wasted spraying sigils when they could have been testing the product in the brewery instead.
"Unless the kid was like I don't know, the antichrist? Then a haunted house would be the perfect place to raise a boy like that hypothetically" Shane suggested, winking at Dean and Cass.
"People lie all the time Castiel, it's how you become president" The demon joked. Cass couldn't argue with his logic, he had a point.
"You know what I mean dude" Ryan asserted. "Ghoul, demon, ghost it's all the same type of weird to me man" He cried out.
"Of course not" Dean said glad he found a way to avoid using the phrase "Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole" and still get to listen to his favourite tunes.
"Okay John Mulaney, dial it back a bit on the snark" Dean tried not to laugh at the Seraph's  unintentional reference to the stand up comedian.
Cass squirmed uncomfortably on the spot "I suppose you could say that yes. If I'm being honest I find it difficult dealing with Shane's kind. It's built into me to dislike demons even if they aren't always bad" Castiel admitted, slightly ashamed to even acknowledge this inherited prejudice.
Shane lingered for a second before sighing in agreement to continue the task at hand, with minimal animosity towards the hunter.
"Well jokes on you Shane I'm still better than you at b-ball despite your abnormally long limbs" The smaller man boasted.
Dean looked at Cass and instantly knew shit was about to hit the fan. Castiel had his game face on and Dean had every right to be worried, even if he didn't know why yet.
"You're right. This is a 'serious' case" Dean did rabbit ears on the word serious. "It's not like this two  idiots had an argument a few minutes ago about whether Stuwart Little was a mouse boy or a mouse man" Dean was getting tired of the ghoul boys antics already.
"You're such a jerk, I was getting real communication from spirts but your skeptical ass can't handle being wrong can you?" Ryan looked done.
"I hate to agree but yeah he's got a point. My brother Sam's the same height as him" Dean told them.
"Don't worry Shane, he'll get over it eventually" Cass covered his mouth with one hand secretively but everyone could still hear him perfectly."When Dean first met me he shot and stabbed me in the chest, but we're fine now" Castiel assured the demon, giving him a reassuring thumbs up.
"Laugh it up Sammy, cause your theory is wrong. The cameraman he's clean" The elder hunter told him.
Just then, the Devils binge watching session was interrupted by the clanking of the heavy metal door of the bunker, signalling the return of Castiel's favourite hunter back home.
"I swear if you hurt him in any way I so help me" Cass threatened them, his voice shaking with anger.
"You sure about that" The hunter gave them a skeptical look. Dean knew a rat when he saw one and Shane was as a YouTube comment he had seen said 'sexy in a rat way". Not that Dean had the hots for him or anything he was spoken for of course, but he saw the rodent-ness the comment spoke of.
"Cass he can't be a demon, there's a devils trap under the rug at the door he would have got stuck" Dean tried to reason with the Angel.
"Yeah out there somewhere" He looked up and around at the dull night sky above them as if searching for a sign of the Devine Mister Shurley "Not that he gives a rats ass about any of us" He murmured angrily.
"Having a pet is a lot of responsibility Jack you understand that right?" Dean really didn't know how much responsibility that entailed since he never had a pet growing up. Holy shit, he realised this was his first family let at forty. Damn he was getting old.
Castiel turned to the very upset looking Ryan "How about we head upstairs to a more relaxing environment?" Castiel suggested to him. "Could I offer you a brown bag to breathe into? I'm told it helps to calm someone down" He gave Ryan a sympathetic smile.
"Um guys does the red light mean the camera is on or off?" Castiel asked staring at the camera bewildered.
Dean had to give it to the guy, he was actually telling the truth. Dean had offed Azazel, Sam Ramiel, Cass Dagon and Gabriel Asmodeus. If Beezelbub turned out to be a problem they had dealt with his kind before. Of course they didn't have the Colt anymore which would have been nice to have right about now.
"Well sorry if I can't look at any of you freaks without thinking of my mom burning up on a ceiling and my entire life falling to shit with her" Dean stormed away his emotions getting the better of him.
"Don't you worry about that" Doc assured the purgatory newcomers. "I know some people who could help you boys out, you might say they are familiar with problems which are out of the ordinary." They smiled at their new hunter and Angel allies.
"Unless you are planning on becoming a male escort Dean, I think all the information given about your skills should remain above board" Castiel concluded the hypothetical conversation about Dean seeking employment in a field with a lesser death rate than hunting things that go bump in the night.
"I swear, if that fucking thing says Beetlejuice I'm leaving" Ryan looked nervously at the little box.
They sussed the place out before entering through a side door with a key they had aquired from the owner of the building, Matt at the burger joint. Sam had got in touch with him back at the bunker. He had made up a fake story and then wired them a handsome sum of money to for use of the location for their own made up paranormal investigation show.
"I'll make sure to put you as my reference then, since you can give them such a glowing review of my capabilities. Both in and out of the bedroom" Dean coughed the last part of the sentence out as he waggled his eyes brows suggestively.
As Ryan flicked on the spirt box, both Shane and Cass winced at the racket it was producing. The noise of the spirt box was annoying enough for humans, but fir Angels and demons that thing was torturous.
The rest of the group forced laughter, to keep Shane's little secret under wraps. Dean became suddenly worried that Ryan might actually be a serial killer then, but he remembered how scared he was in the videos so that couldn't be legit could it? Well if he went Ted Bundy on their asses Dean reckoned he could take him.
"Yeah so does everything, doesn't make it continental does it?" The hunter huffed. "I'm digging this tote bag though. Perfect for my shotgun babe right?" Dean posed with the bag swung over his left shoulder, giving Cass his best blue steel all the while.
"Woah look here, I'm not responsible for other demons actions Dean" Beezelbub argued. "You have every right to be mad I'm not taking that away from you but I didn't do anything to you man so don't take it out on me" He said defensively.
Cass placed his hand above Ryan's injured one and shut his eyes. A bright light emitted and then with that, Ryan's hand felt as good as new.
"Hey, he can't ever be actually mad at you for more than five minutes. I don't have that luxury" Sam admitted.
"What an old married couple, heck and we should know" Dean whispered to Cass as they lagged behind the two ghost hunters to talk privately.
"He means salt and burn, we torched them" Dean explained to the ghost hunter. "They won't be pinning anymore youtubers up against walls now" They assured them.
"Ryan, I was looking out for you man. Do you get how many ghosts and demons are in these locations we go to? They are swarming with things trying to rip you apart. Let me ask you this, have you ever left one of the shoots with so much as a scratch on you? No, and thats because of me looking out for you" Shane argued.
"Right and rolling. We're now in the Elsa Lemp suite which is supposedly the most haunted of the bedrooms in the house. It was originally used as servants quarters, so maybe we might get to communicate with Elsa or the Lemp's staff" Ryan began.
"If anything goes south we'll let you know Sammy" Dean said to his younger brother as he headed out the door with Castiel ready to embark on another case.
Lucifer was watching the bunker's security footage tapes on a VHS machine he had found collecting dust in one of the hundreds of cupboards in the Men of Letters Bunker. Sure he had initially been looking for something more exciting than tapes of his enemies daily life's. Like maybe some of those angelic weapons Cass's next in command Balthazar had stolen during his little civil war against Raphael but hey Devils can't be chosers. Although, out of any place on the country he would have assumed the Men of Letters would have procured a flaming sword or a specially crafted lance at some point but the majority of weapons he came across where just the blades of the countless Angels the Winchesters and their lap dog had taken on during the years. He'd just have to find something else to help him get the upper hand on the Darkness. Anyways it was quite entertaining to watch the tape of Dean beating the ever loving crap out of Castiel when he was all jacked up on the Mark of Cain on repeat. Especially when he knew the Angel in question had no where to go to avoid reliving this painful memory over and over again. Some people are just naturally talent and inflicting pain whether it be physical or psychological was Lucifer's God given talent.
"Would you believe me if I were to tell you I have a rare form of eye jaundice?" The demon asked him.
"Do you mind if we listen to this instead?" Cass asked knowing that of course no objections would be had with playing Dean's favourite band.
"So what now you're Lord of the windows movie maker?" Dean chuckled at his own joke like the dork he was.
Dean breathed heavily "Phew that was a close one. Those demons sure we're funny when they called you Doc cause you look just like Doc Holliday with that moustache" Dean chuckled softly.
"I didn't mean that, I just thought you'd want to keep an eye on Ryan and Shane" Castiel made himself clear.
"Dean" Cass huffs in response, clearly not impressed with the elder Winchesters response to the serious issue at hand.
"No look man I don't think you do get it" Ryan argued as he started to become irate. "Tonight I came in here with my best friend ready to do another shoot and tomorrow I'm gonna be leaving with someone totally new and a bunch of footage I have to say is corrupted so the world doesn't implode" Ryan finished his rant with a deep sigh.
"Yeah family business alright, but no he's too young for all this. My brothers baby sitting tonight. We don't live on the premise, we live a good drive away actually" Dean remembered that tedious eight hour drive from Lebanon. Then it hit him, oh boy. They were gonna have to do it all over again to get back home.
"No rest for the Winchesters" Dean mumbled to himself as he clambered into the drivers seat of baby, but Cass heard him plain as day. How could he not with his impeccable angelic senses?
"The universe really does has a sick sense of humour doesn't it sometimes" Dean murmured to himself.
"Well the cameras fine but the mics have just stopped working all of a sudden. That's odd" Ryan said looking down at the equipment puzzled.
"I'm on it" Sam was already on a web page of leaked information about the new season of the show. "So get this. They're filming new episodes of the show and one of the locations is the Lemp Mansion in St. Louis Missouri. Seems like their filming there tonight. It's not too far, we can drive out there and talk with those guys and warn them that their in danger." Sam
"Um hi? We were told Matt would be meeting us here" the shorter man from the videos, stated confused to be met with Dean and Cass at the door instead.
"Yeah it's not good, but you know what's the only great thing about this fucking nightmare house" Ryan mused.
"We're aware of the so called Lemp family curse, Elsa is the curse why you shot yourself? Could you make a noise maybe? How about you turn off this flashlight" Ryan looked around the room waiting for some sign of ghost.
"I know that it's just..." This whole ordeal had Ryan's head all messed up and his thoughts were practically spinning around inside his cranium. "We can't be the ghoul boys anymore if one of us is actually a ghoul" Ryan pointed out to them.
"I know the feeling buddy, lemme guess" Dean paused to take a swig from his beverage "It's either women, slots or booze, it's always some sort of addiction am I right?" He was speaking for experience.
"Hey, Cass buddy I didn't mean it like that. I'm just saying that there's always something, another case another the world is ending again kinda deal. We can't seem to catch a break, I'd love just one free week. Me, you, Sam and Jack on a beach somewhere drinking out of coconuts is that so much to ask for?" Dean pondered. He couldn't remember the last time they had a weekend to themselves with no case thrown into the mix to ruin their free time.
"The Lemp family's resting place can now be found in beautiful Bellefontaine Cemetery." The hunter read off the web page allowed.
"Yeah I think Henry would be rolling in his grave if he knew what we've done with the place already. Anyway, back to the case. Dean, I think I know who's been pulling all the crap on the show" Sam said.
"Excuse me?" Dean furrowed his brow, which highlighted his newly forming crows feet. The majority of hunters don't live to even see forty so Dean was in the lucky minority somehow, despite the atrocities he had already faced during his existence.
"Generally yes. It's supposed to be a paranormal hotspot, those aren't the most welcoming of locations" Cass remarked, as they walked in step with each other up to the mansions entrance.
"Sure thing, be right back" He shot a finger gun towards to the other host and sauntered off back up the stairs.
"I gotta make a quick call, I'll be right back" Dean nodded to Cass to keep a handle on the situation in his absence, as he headed out of the suite down to a little side room upstairs.
The front door swung open and a tall man wearing a hoodie, a flannel and a jean jacket strolled into the foyer. He reminded Dean of a Russian nesting doll with all those layers. He didn't trust someone with that many layers on. Well apart from Cass, but he wasn't just anyone.
Fuck. He teleported out of the room and Dean yelled after him "You son of a bitch! You can't leave us here to die! Lady I ain't your damn husband for Petes sake" Elsa was really giving her fake husband an earful and the start of a broken jaw for the slaps she was throwing his way.
Fuck it's the Lemp's ghosts, Dean thought to himself. They were unarmed, the rock salt loaded shot-guns were still in the trunk of the impala and they had no iron with them either. In other words, they were screwed.
"Sorry beer baron your brews are good but we need you to move the heck on now" Dean poured salt onto the corpse and pulled a lighter out of his jacket pocket and dropped it onto the body.
He was grateful he always had Sammy's companionship growing up. Castiel never had need for such trivial connections in heaven. The Angels were made to be soildiers not to make friends and it showed. Dean was the first real friend Cass had and he was proud of that. Of course he felt guilty that the dude rebelled for his sake and met his dismise for it more than once but almost ten years on, he was proud to call Cass his best friend. Dean couldn't even imagine what would have happened to him if Castiel had never came into his life. He rather wouldn't think about that really. He'd still be stuck in hell if it weren't for Cass coming to his rescue. He needed Cass more than he'd ever know and he wished he could tell him that but he didn't know where to begin with such a heavy piece of emotional baggage to unload onto him
"You're The John Henry Holliday. The man the myth the legend?" Dean continued ignoring Cass's jab at him because this was just totally insane. Maybe Michael really is pulling a fast one on them he thought and instead of meeting Doctor sexy he's getting to meet Doc Holliday this time. He didn't really care if it was an angelic trick because he was getting to meet one of his favourite people in history.
"Okay that was a rhetorical question, but Cass I'm flattened you've been counting the hours-" The hunters train of thought was cut off as Castiel grabbed him by the lapels of his jacket and kissed him passionately. The hunter took the initiative as he pulled the Angel closer, as they both began to undress frantically to engage in some hopefully uninterrupted special time at long last...
"I knew because our ghostbusters bosses told them that the FBI wrangled their cameraman and yours truly is filling in for him" Dean told Sam.
"Let's get going. We're staying in the Elsa Lemp suite, it's supposed to be the most haunted of the bedrooms" Ryan said anxiously.
"Well isn't it odd how everything was just fine until the Winchesters rock up don't ya think?" The prince of hell scoffed.
"Yeah it was uncanny" Shane confirmed "Cass how bout you say 'February' for us, that's the real Bergara test right there"
"Everything's fine here Sam" The elder Winchester lied through his teeth. "We'll be back home tomorrow afternoon okay?"
"And why would a demon care about my safety? Are you trying to steal my soul or something" Ryan accused him.
"There's something very powerful in this area, but I'm not sure what it is" Cass said as he looked out the window of the impala, like a big sign would appear out of nowhere saying "danger this way".
His eyes met with Deans "Love. None of those things can be found there. I prefer it here. Here with my family" A soft smile snuck onto the Angels face as he told that to Dean.
"I wouldn't go that far... mortality isn't simply just good or bad there's a scale and there's a lot of grey areas involved too. Ryan, Shane choose to be your friend doesn't that account for his character?"
"Sunshine, you mean Jimmy Novak's credit card" Dean teased Castiel with a smirk plastered on his face.
"That truly isn't necessarily" Cass said, looking very uncomfortable from this gesture preformed by the gunslinger slash dentist.
"You're right, I guess our lives are living nightmares" Dean said sadly. "I'm glad he's happy I am, but I hope he gets that a Guinea pig isn't an everyday thing. The bunker is not gonna become a petting zoo. Not over my dead body."
"I'm retired actually, not a prince anymore. Try the demon formerly known as a prince?" Shane corrected Dean's statement.
"Ah that's somehow both comforting and horrifying" Ryan grimaced. "So guys what are we gonna do about the footage that can't see the light of day can it?" Ryan asked sadly. He had finally got the proof of the paranormal he had been searching for but he wouldn't be able to share it with the world.
"They could get hurt Cass or worse dead if we don't give them the whole monsters are real talk" Dean replied.
"Enough! All the princes of hell are dead how is this possible" Castiel interrupted, before Dean lost his cool and tried to beat the demon to a pulp.
"Strange bedfellows you keep Dean, that says a lot about a guy who he surrounds himself by. So for you that's Angels, demons and the actual God himself" Shane loomed over the hunter and Dean dug around in the trunk, making sure he had everything he needed to properly sent the Lemp's spirits to the other side.
"You okay man?" Dean said trying to remain calm even though his heart was pounding heavily in his chest. Castiel wasn't a whimp, he was actually kind of a badass. Anything that made him worried made Dean feel terrified.
Shane looked conflicted. He could save his friends and reveal himself to Ryan or leave the ghosts to have their fun with them and have his identity remain a secret.
"This is a hoot wow he's so alpha isn't he Cass?" Lucifer said to the Angel, halfway through his second bowl of popcorn that day. He didn't need to eat of course he just enjoyed the dramatics of it all.
"Yeah just a few vampires nothing we can't handle" Sam yawned as he plonked into the chair next to Jack exhausted.
Cass stood at the bottom of the stairwell pensively "Remember what I said Ryan. Goodnight Shane, Goodnight Ryan" He bid them farewell.
After some thought Dean confidently answered "On a beach somewhere, in Hawaiian shirts drinking strong booze from a coconut" He smiled thinking about the sun beating down on him and his Angel, not a care in the world. Just taking in the scenery, no apocalypse to avert just them together. Now that would be nice.
"WHAT THE HECK MAN" Shane staggered backwards as blood dripped down his face "I think you broke my nose" He whined as he held his head upwards. "Ahhhhh fuck"
"Guess again" Cass said totally unfazed, as his eyes began to shine as did his hands. "Shut your eyes!" He called to the owner and Dean, so he didn't blind the pair when smiting the demons. The two men followed Castiel's orders and closed their eyes until the bellowing from the dying demons subsided.
"I was aware my likeness had been stolen by Hollywood that's a lawsuit for another day. Besides in my humble opinion he portrayed the man who is a bat much more convincingly than he did with myself, although the he did achieve a great likeness to me. Now you got some explaining to do. Firstly how do you two gentlemen know what revenants are and how did you kill them so easily? Especially you Mister magic hands" Doc pointed towards Cass.
"Nothing, they did nothing now come on you fucking scaredy cat. We've got ghosts to bust" Shane motioned for Ryan to sit down in front of the camera in the front room to film their introduction for the episode.
"The fuck I have. I know what I saw! Dude your eyes were yellow, what is going on around here?" Ryan demanded to know.
"Cass leave the guy alone this has gone too far" Dean began to think the Angel had lost the run of themselves.
"Dean, I don't think we're in purgatory" Castiel uttered worriedly to the flannel-clad man to his side.
"Did I not say I had a problem on my hands fellas... I guess I shouldn't have spoke of the Devil's now should I" The barman smiled weakly at Cass and Dean as he came out from behind the counter, to face the gang of brutes in the middle of the bar. "Is that correct sir?" He said calmly. "Well what if I say that bone will be remaining unpicked, what then huh?" They said squaring up to the stocky man. The largest of the men emitted a freakish guttural noise from his throat in response to the barkeeps unwavering attitude.
"In 1975, the old mansion was purchased by Dick Pointer and his family. Immediately they began to renovate the building, turning it into a restaurant and inn. Workers within the house often told stories of apparitions, strange sounds, vanishing tools, and a feeling of being watched. Frightened by the hauntings, many would leave the job site never to return. The property is said to be haunted by several members of the Lemp family. The area of the property with the most activity is what the staff refers to as, 'The Gates of Hell' in the basement. It is this area of the basement that used to be the entrance to the caves running below the mansion and the brewery" Cass recited the Wikipedia pages entry for the Mansion from memory.
"That should do the trick if there is a demon in the joint. They're bound to end up trapped in one of those" Dean mused to himself.
"It's just a phrase... never mind. I'm going to go turn in too, I'm pooped. If you need me I'll be in my room" He headed up the staircase towards the Elsa Lemp suite, hoping he wouldn't be needed. He was still trying to decide how he felt about his friend not being who he thought they were this whole time. On the one hand he had been provided with definitive proof of the existence of the supernatural, something all people in his line of work would quite literally kill for but it didn't feel like he had imagined it would. It felt sour and sad. His pal wasn't a sardonic skeptic, he was a fucking demon, one of the things that go bump in the night that should scare the pants off of people like Ryan yet he was still the same guy he goofed around with and made a stupid hotdog themed space opera and occasionally looked like Shaggy from Scooby Doo. How can both of those realities exist simultaneously? His head was practically spinning.
"And you're the very picture of a normally functioning man then?" Cass snipped at Dean, whose only reply to this was simply a hurt sounding "dude!".
Team free will then watched a handful of other episodes and concluded that this wasn't any normal bogus supernatural investigation show, this was legit. Things were happening on screen that couldn't be explained away by coincidence or the wind. It was a case. Everywhere these men go something weird happens. Maybe the ghost hunters were being haunted by a wandering spirt attached to a something they took from one of the haunted locations? They didn't know really but they sure as hell were gonna find out what was going on with this unsolved show.
"Baby bro congrats on the matrimony!" Lucifer began to pester Castiel as soon as Dean is out of the room with this new information at his disposal.
"A genteel hotel with Victorian-style suites in a historic mansion, plus a quaint eatery and ghost tours" Castiel read the description of the building from his phone aloud.
"Let's not worry about that right now. Look it's been a long night and we're all tired. So how about we turn in and regroup in the morning to talk about all that went down. Okay?" Dean said to the others.
"Oh finally, I was gonna call a search party for you dude" Ryan sighed as his cohost Shane entered into the hallway, with bags full of filming gear in tow.
"I'm not just a pretty face ya know" Dean winked to them. "Come on let's pick the towns people's brains so we can get home and fix our another apocalyptic mess we're stuck in" The hunter ushered for Castiel to follow them.
"Well yes, but the whole unsolved fans as a whole are called ghouligans. Anyways there's also shitfish but I don't want to bring them into this" Shane murmured, trying not to talk about the shitfish.
"Care to share with the class" Ryan looked over to his co-host who was struggling to stand up with how hard they were laughing.
Anger bubbled in Dean's stomach and rose up through his body, dictating his next actions. "Okay, okay sure I'll sit this one out" Dean went to turn back to where he had got up from and while doing so, he splashed the remaining alcohol in his glass all over the head demons front. While they were distracted Dean drew out his gun with his other hand and shot the soaked hell-spawn square in the chest. "Uh oh, it was an accident" Dean smirked, drunken idiot act totally dropped now as the wounded demon let out his final ear-piercing shouts.
"Dean you let him drive the impala and drink beer, but you're suddenly concerned about the shows he watches" Sam called his brother out on his bullshit.
"Anyway, can't we just enjoy what we've got here for once since the room is so pricey after all" The hunter whistled looking online at the booking fee "We should just pretend to work at haunted hotels more often" He concluded, as he tossing his cell onto the bedside table.
Ryan held out his bottle and urged the others to 'cheers' with him, to which they obliged. "All hail the watcher I guess" He smiled before tasting the product.
"Was that supposed to comfort me? If anything that's actually a lot worse" Ryan felt very uncomfortable and shuffled in place, thinking about all the times he must have faked being asleep during their investigations together.
"Dean 2, Castiel 2, Sam 2, Jack 2. Poor kid doesn't know too many people to name a pet after so I suggested he pick someone from the show, kids addicted to it" Sam told him.
"I'm a dentist by trade not a florist, but it does ring a bit of a bell nevertheless" They replied with a perplexed look due to the forwardness of the trench coated man's question.
"That's a great idea" Shane replied "Maybe if we get Ryan drunk enough he'll stop being such a wuss.
"I wouldn't call civil wars nothing Cass" Dean replied recalling the turmoil that always seems to occur up in the silver city.
Dean swung the impala into the cemetery with the skill of a nascar driver and pulled up to where the Lemp family tomb was situated. He turned the car off and both he and the prince of hell in the passenger side exited the vehicle swiftly.
"Don't 'hello Dean, me" The elder Winchester was clearly drunk as the aroma of cheap beer wafted around him. "Where the fuck were you?" He sounded rightly pissed off.
'Purgatory courthouse', it read clear as day. According to that sign they were in fact in a purgatory, just not the one the were familiar with who would have thought?
"Hey look I get it man, it's been a stressful day for everyone" Shane assured their fellow ghost-hunter.
"I think a few thousand years does matter pal" Shane chuckled, eyes crinkling as he laughed. "Castiel ain't no spring chicken, more of a sugar daddy rooster I'd say" The demon wiggled his eyebrows toward Dean.
Dean and Castiel discuss some domestic matters and other more sausey things in the luxury of the Lavender Suite while Ryan's hope for a good night sleep is interrupted.
Shane frowned at that remark "You're my friend Ryan, why would I let you get hurt? Besides I'm not a crossroads demon I don't give a rats about souls"
"What can I say? I grew attracted to the little guy so I kept tabs on him. He started working for Buzzfeed so I said what the hay, we could be colleagues. Pulls some strings got a job there in the same department as Ryan. Then he started his unsolved show with Brent and I knew I had to hop on that gig! I mean a show about providing the existence of the Supernatural with one of the hosts themselves being a supernatural being? The irony of me saying I'm a skeptic too! It's just a huge joke" Shane chuckled to himself.
As they approached the mansion once again, Dean was relieved he didn't have to continue this conversation any longer.
"That's your problem not mine pal, what's yours is mine su casa mi casa" Lucifer grinned to himself.
They were interrupted by the sound of the Mansion's droning doorbell being rung."That's them now" Dean stated as they made their way to the front entrance.
"Sorry isn't gonna cut it Sunshine. I sat in the restaurant for an hour and the guy at the bar thought I got stood up and gave me a free beer. Well I guess I did  actually get stood up. Getting stood up is bad enough but at that restaurant, we waited weeks for the reservation and now I can't ever go back there man I'm humiliated" Dean huffed, clearly very upset with the Angel.
Dean hung up the phone and with that he was in the clear. He had snuck a little white lie past Sam, yet again. What was the harm in that? Besides he and Cass had everything under control right?
"Hey kid you seem happy" Dean declared glad to see Jack so joyful. He hadn't seen the boy so smiley in a long time.
"The hotdoga. It's a hot dog-saga during the Q and A's for unsolved. I might have watched more episodes while you were gone" He admitted to him.
The tiresome eight hour car journey from Lebanon to St. Louis was speed along by the soundtrack of the impalas radio which Dean had switched on and turned up so it was blaring at full volume.
Castiel was practically fuming "You were supposed to help us defeat the Darkness, not just sit back and watch security footage all day Lucifer" Cass snarled at him.
"How about fake identity, 'Steve' worked for me. I'm sure you could pull it off also considering you pretend to be a US Marshall or a Special Agent every day of the week " Cass assured him.
The squabbling duo look up to the properer of the establishment, a reasonably handsome man with an impressive moustache and melancholic blue eyes donning a large hat.
The four made their way down the long, winding tunnel until the reached the brewery where they were greeted by the complimentary Lemp brand beers.
Ryan sighed "I always thought he was a little weird but he's not demon weird. Actually fuck it makes sense. No sane guy thinks it's a good idea to call a demon a pussy unless they are one".
"Fuck Cass, I didn't think about that" Dean began to scratch as this neck in thought. "How about you whip up a mini miracle instead? Ya know like a stain that looks like Jesus on the wall or something to attract the religious tourists instead of the paranormal ones. It's the least we can do for them after ghostbusting their biggest draw of customers right?" Dean concluded.
"I'm not really sure." Ryan looked a bit lost for words. "They said an FBI agent called them to say he was wanted for questioning. They just said to carry on filming without him because the budget won't allow us to show up another night for a reshoot" he told his co-host.
"Sorry man driver picks the music shotgun shuts his cakehole, thems the rules" Dean smirked to himself.
"1990" The demon responded immediately, knowing everything about his best friend like it was his civic duty.
The boys finally have their brewskies and a long kept secret is revealed that could end the future of the ghoul boy's friendship.
"What can I say I've got long legs. Here how about you take it Cass, I think it's more your style than the camera" Shane held out the microphone to the Angel who snatched it from them abruptly.
"Is this you being pissy because Amara kissed me? Your aunt is a bit of a cougar sure but look I already told you she means nothing to me! It's that stupid mark Cain crap, it's like a goddamn tramp stamp" He threw the suit jacket he had been carrying in his arms onto the chair at the war room table.
Dean scowled. "My partner is more well versed on the ins and outs of the business. I'm just a pretty face at reception, he's the brains of the operation. Isn't that right sweetie" He smiled at the Angel.
He walked back into the Elsa Lemp suite and tapped Castiel on the shoulder. He decided to start with the bad news about bank account first and then follow with the Guinea pig to soften the financial blow with the cuteness factor of the small rodent.
"Don't hold your breath I much prefer this vessel than my last" Cas said as they recalled the amount of annoyance they faced when they sported a female vessel back in 1901. He didn't particularly feel like being in another female visage for the foreseeable future when bras existed. What torturous devices, they were clearly an output of Hell.
"No, for real he's an honest to God Angel. The harp and wings kind" Dean explained to the gunslinger.
The Angel and the Hunter were confused as to who this watcher was. It couldn't be that bad if they had never heard of them right?
"These tunnels sure don't have tall people in mind" Shane grumbled as he hunched his back to walk down as they made their way towards the brewery.
"Come on, We gotta get back to the mansion before Cass and Ryan drink all that sweet beer" Dean turned and headed toward the impala.
"Yeah that's what I was thinking but apparently Agent Young thinks otherwise. Well at least if he is doing some shadey shit we'll have good material for the new season of true crime right" Ryan replied, trying to make light of the situation.
"Several Lemp family member died in this house via sucicide. It's the Lemp family curse" Ryan explained.
Dean and Shane finally returned to the B&B and regrouped with Ryan and Cass in the front of the house.
Cass scanned the snow covered area the had been transported to, looking for a place to gather their bearings. Dean followed him towards a collection of buildings down a main road that seemed to be in the centre of whatever place they were in. As they got closer to the largest building in the street the Angel noticed something interesting written above the landmark.
"Oh right yeah stage name basically, God" Dean clarified for them. "Dudes giving Lady Gaga a run for her money with the guitar and everything! It's really not what I expected from Sunday school" Dean stated.
"Those fucking cheap skates. Wait the FBI wanted to speak with him? Dude's harmless." Shane said to Ryan.
"That it has babe. How long has it been since we had some quality uninterrupted alone time hmm? Dean rubbed his partners arm fondly
"I'm sure he is a very nice fellow indeed but that doesn't account for how he killed those revenants" Doc replied, missing the earnestness of Dean's words.
"No it's not Ryan. He's human, very human with such a small bladder capacity" Cass stopped his train of thought as the bathroom door swung open and Ryan came back out looking very happy with himself.
"What can I say, I learned from the best" He said plonking next to him on the King size bed. "Sure I can whip something up as you say, I'll do that in the morning. This day has been quite eventful hasn't it" He added.
Castiel and Dean had decided to spend the night in the extravagant Lavender suite, on the second floor. They had choose that particular room because of it's private bathroom, king sized bed, and the fact that was the largest of all the suites in the mansion. It had once served as the Lemps' master bedroom and frankly Dean wanted a taste of the high life the beer baron had lived, and well Cass was just complying with his partners slightly odd wishes.
"I thought there was only boogaras and shaniacs" Dean was getting more and more confused by the ins and outs of the whole unsolved universe.
"Maybe he shouldn't be watching this stuff, he's only two after all" Dean said entering full Dad mode.
The barman and other demons seemed stunned, which gave them an advantage yet again, as this allowed for Castiel to get involved in the brawl. The trench-coated seraph sauntered over to the scene of the action and locked eyes with the remaining demons.
"So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye" Shane began to sing, whilst waving at the dead bodies that were alight.
"It's just the subject matter." The Angel stated clearly flustered. "It's rather repetitive don't you think?" It does have some truth to it however" Castiel stated.
"We roughed them up a bit until they spilled the beans. It's all movie magic Sammy sorry to break it to ya" Dean lied.
The boys drove on towards the Lemp Mansion after a food pit stop at a cheap burger joint. Dean scoffed a double cheeseburger faster than you could say "Poughkeepsie" as Cass awkwardly watched the hunter eat. Once Dean had got some well needed cholesterol into his system, the pair got back on the road.
"Aww an angry hubby Cass how sweet, does Samantha know about you two love birds?" He inquired cheekily.
"So you think there's no chance your dick of a brother would have sent us here on purpose you know like payback for the 'hey-assbutting' and for leaving them in the cage for so long?" Dean pressed the Angel for a definite answer.
"Hey guys the karaoke night hasn't started yet it's barely even the afternoon!" He slurred his words as he got closer to the leader of the group.
"Whatever man, you just don't want me to get concrete evidence of the paranormal" Ryan  concluded, without knowing how truthful this statement actually was.
"This week on buzzfeed unsolved we are at the historical Lemp mansion in St. Louis, as part of our ongoing investigation into the question, are ghosts real?" Ryan stated.
"Yeah pretty much except we got no vacuum cleaners on our backs" Dean smirked. "Anyway we should probably actually do some busting and get those spirts out of here"
"Come on we've got work to do. To the brewery" He pointed forward valiantly and raced off down the hall. "The Brewery's in a separate building but it's connected to the house by this tunnel" They explained as they whipped out a flashlight and turned it on. The dark tunnel was illuminated by Ryan's torch light.
"Bad Angels are more common than you'd expect unfortunately" Cass said heavily, remembering Metatron, Naomi and the countless other brothers and sisters that had wronged him and the people he called his real family over the years.
Ryan swung his legs out over the side of the bed and strolled to the door. He hesitated to open it for a moment before he sighed and did so regardless of his instincts telling him not to follow through.
"Well I assumed you kinda cancelled our friendship subscription when you broke my nose" Shane told him.
Neither hunter nor angel aware of what was waiting for them when they finally reached their destination of St. Louis. If they only knew, they would have turned the car right back around as fast as they could.
"It totally does, ya know that one juice?" He said as he pulled the song up on his phone and played the clip for them.
"I didn't say that Shane" The smaller man shuffled awkwardly, not wanting to admit that was exactly the thing he had been thinking to himself. That proved how well Shane knew him and it stung.
"You think I'm a monster" Shane stated, voice slightly shaking despite his best efforts to keep it steady.
"No I'm not talking about urination. Dean there's a very strong demonic presence here that wasn't here earlier" Castiel retorted, as they bickered like the old married couple that they are.
"The spirt box is not crap! It's important ghost hunting gear Shane" Ryan huffed. "Look man I know you don't believe in the supernatural but can you at least try to seem somewhat  interested?" He added with a sharp tone.
As much as he had just teased him, Cass wouldn't enjoy if Dean had a day job as he'd be left in the bunker awaiting his return impatiently with only Sam's mini Ted talks about the difference between one variety of Kale and another and Jack's innocent questions such as "Cass why am I growing a beard under my arms?" He loved both his adoptive son and his longtime friend of course, but time spent with Dean truly made his days so much brighter. Besides it was quite difficult to try and make conversation about green vegetables and the concept of armpit hair for more than a few moments before going a little bit crazy.
"Listen here smartass, you're not driving my car now or ever! Understand?" Dean practically growled at Shane.
Dean was taken aback back the forwardness of the demon prying into the ins and outs of his love life. Not even Sam had the balls to be so intrusive to his private affairs.
"What do you expect them to do Dean?" Cass squeeked as he got redder and redder, the more the ghost restrained him.
"What-no and I solely agreed to let you share my vessel to spare Sam. I certainly didn't consent to you wreaking havoc in my personal affairs Lucifer and it's none of your business frankly" Castiel sneered at the Devil.
"Yeah, turns out I'm outnumbered" Shane told Ryan "besides I have a damn go-pro strapped on me, I think we'll get enough footage of the wind knocking things over"
"Did we just take out this place out of business by getting rid of the spirits Dean? Will that no effect the real owners livelihoods" The Angel asked with a guilty look on his face.
Dean complied with his angel's request and grabbed the container of holy water and splashed it onto Shanes face. Nothing happened, shit he's just a dude.
Since my last update we have been blessed by two new unsolved episodes and they were the shit what a time to be a ghouligan. Also roll on October tenth I miss team free will.
"I know but this is different Cass I know it. Look at all this evidence" Jack typed away at the laptop and pulled up an episode of the show for them to watch.
Just then the doors slammed open all of a sudden. "HOLLIDAY" a stocky man bellows, four more men waking behind him saunter into Shorty's. "I gotta bone to pick with you Doc" the leader of the group of intruders calls out towards the barman.
"Yeah I get that it's a spook fest here, no place to raise a child" Ryan shuddered at the though of living in a haunted house, even a nice big mansion like the Lemp mansion.
If this reads weirdly please note that I was drunk when I wrote it hashtag living that Dean Winchester way of life lately.
"Cass, did I just have a stroke or did he say he was Doc Holliday" Dean grabbed the seraph by the forearm for balance as he felt the colour drain from his be-freckled face.
"Cry me a river pal" Dean rolled his eyes so hard, they might have got stuck in the back of his head if it had been windy in the cemetery.
"He didn't mean it like that Jack, of course you're helpful. Look me and Dean will meet these Ryan and Shane people and tell them how to avoid being gruesomely killed and then come home right away isn't that right Dean?" Castiel shot Dean the "just agree with me" look.
Dean made his way through the winding hallways of the Lemp mansion, towards the front door. This whole thing was far from what the hunter was used to hunts being like. Usually he'd give the whole 'the paranormal is real' talk after some clueless schmuck was almost killed by some monster. The fact that this demon was all buddy-buddy with this guy Ryan and was actually protecting him made Dean very wary of the guy. He must have some shitty reason to do so, right? Nice demons don't exist and that was a fact he was sure of. Dean had found that out the hard way, by trusting one and having it bite him in the ass.He walked out into the yard, towards the impala to see Beezelbub inspecting every inch of the vehicle. Oh great Dean sighed to himself, here we go again.
"Night Ryan. I promise I won't interrupt your beauty sleep again tonight" He assured him, as he left the room and descended down the staircase.
Dean staggered over to when the barman and demons were, as he sloppily slurped from the glass to try get the demons have their guard down. What harm could a drunken mess like him do to those big strong demons right? A lot of harm actually...
"Get in the damn car already, don't make me ask twice!" Dean pinched the top of his nose, annoyed with their shenanigans already. Since when were demons such motorheads anyway he wondered silently.
"Fine you wanna play dirty? Lets go billy!" Shanes real eyes flickered into view, as he banished the spirt from the room by using his demonic powers.
"Hold on a minute, you're one to talk. You hypocrite. You say you don't believe in the supernatural, yet you are a supernatural being" Cass argued with him.
"Touché" Dean nodded. Heck he lies everyday of his life, he sure as hell isn't a federal marshal but he tries to walk the walk when the situation calls for it.
"Well done, I'm impressed. The queen Mary. I was dicking around in the boat trying to freak out some teenagers for the fun of it and then Ryan showed up. Total skeptic said it was all hooey and I knew I had found a perfect target, so I just messed with him a bit" The demon explained.
"Where did you and Ryan meet anyways?" Dean tried making small talk with the demon, to make the ride back to the Lemp house a little more bearable.
"Approximately" Cass added to try break the awkward silence, rubbing the back of his neck tensely as a tinge of embarrassment took hold of them.
"Fairly simple job, you just have to go to where the bodies are and do a bit of torching" He whipped out his cell to find out where the Lemp's were buried.
Dean actually wasn't going to laugh at Ryan's holy water gun. It was actually pretty genius, maybe he should get one himself.
"Like I said I retired. Well I guess it was more of a disownment come to think of it" Shane admitted to them.
"An errand you say?" The owner seemed perplexed by this statement. "Not many folks just waltz into Purgatory on errands, this isn't an errand sort of town you see" They concluded.
"Hey if you can do that" Ryan gestured to his fixed hand "Why didn't you fix Shane's nose?" Ryan asked Cass earnestly.
"I'm sorry of course this must be all very hard to process for you" The Angel felt idiotic for asking Ryan if he was okay. Of course he wasn't, his whole world view had been flipped on its head. He was only adding insult to injury with his poor consoling skills, but he would feel worse if he didn't try and offer Ryan help in this turbulent time.
"The ghost of the very much still alive Lizzo, would not haunt the Lemp Mansion Shane" Ryan rolled his eyes.
"That isn't me anymore, I don't want to dig up old bones" Shane insisted, not wanting to delve into his past.
Ryan didn't notice the little squirmish between the Angel and demon because he was staring down the dark hallway.
Dean pulled Castiel in for a hug and placed a soft kiss on his head. "I'll be fine Cass. You keep Ryan from checking himself into the psych ward okay? We won't be long. Promise" The Angel nodded, reluctantly letting go of Dean's arm and Dean turned and walked out of the tunnel.
"How many living women's bedrooms do you skulk around in at this hour of the night Ryan?" The demon joked.
"Ryan I said I was sorry" Shane began to apologise again when suddenly the four were knocked down to the ground by four figures, flickering in and out of their perception like T.V static.
"I suppose your right" he admitted, it's very hard to disagree with the man you hauled out of hell no matter how hard you wanted to.
"I don't need you, I just wanna give your friend some alone time to process what going on" The hunter explained "You good with that"
"Woah this place is swanky!" Dean exclaimed as he took in the luxury of the room, compared to the usual dives he was used to staying in. "Free tote bag and continental snacks?" He read off the brochure as he walked over to the table next to the gigantic bed, to inspect their free goods. "What makes these peanuts so continental?" Dean looked confusedly at a packet of salted nuts on the table, beside some bottles of orange juice. Nice to know he wouldn't be experiencing the horrors of scurvy soon as he intently to swipe all those bottles before they returned home to the bunker.
Fuck he thought that could have been it what else do these stupid humans do then? "Dean what is wrong, what did I forget?" Lucifer asked the hunter as they began to wonder could he nominate himself for an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Castiel, which was still fooling his human pet so successfully.
"Maybe one of them made a deal with a crossroads demon and their card never got punched after ten years with all the chaos downstairs" Dean motioned under his feet as if just saying the word "hell" would give him bad luck. How much worse luck could he have anyways? He reckoned it was all those mirrors him and Sammy had to break when they dealt with Bloody Mary, all those years ago.
"Hey one camera is plenty down here we just need the one for the intro, how about we just get started already?" Shane said to his co-host.
Just then Lucifer realised the presence of the matching gold bands on the hunter and the Seraph's fingers. Oh this day keeps getting better and better he thought to himself.
"What about him?" Dean replied defensively, ready to argue with the smarmy demon if he insulted his partner in any way.
"And he's an angel?" Ryan asked skeptically. "I'm sorry but yeah I get ghosts and demons, there's evidence on film of that but Angels? I think you guys are joshing me now" Ryan folded his arms defensively.
"Hey beer baron, get off my pal!" Shane shouted at the ghost of William Senior who turned his head and released Ryan from the choke hold he had him pinned in. "Yeah I'm talking to you grandpa!" William Senior lunged for Shane and knocked the iron bar across the room out of his reach.
The hatted owner tried to get Dean to return to his seat at the bar out of harms way, seemingly not realising Dean's natural talent for acting. He had pretended to be straight for how many years so his acting was nearly at the level of Leonardo DiCaprio at this stage of his life in his own humble opinion. "Sir this is between me and this fellow you'd best sit down son and leave my problems to me" They pleaded with him.
"Hey you two doing alright, any trouble from the ghosts since we left" Dean asked with an air of worry in his voice, despite him trying to play it cool in front of the Unsolved duo.
That wording made Castiel beyond terrified for what was to come, and he definitely should have been. If he only knew what ideas Lucifer had brewing in his twisted mind...
"So it's a family business? Didn't you say you had a son, does he work here too?" Ryan asked curiously.
It had only been a few days since Castiel had said the big 'yes' to Lucifer to make the devil spare the Winchesters but for the seraph it had felt more like decades. This stupid selfless sacrifice was tried and true Winchester brand of stupid behaviour and it really signalled that the Angel was truly part of the family now.
"Your not my mother dude, heck I barely even know you" He waved the bottle towards Cass's face, but accidentally slammed his hand into the side of the chair.
"I'm joking" Shane laughed heartily "You should see your face right now its priceless. He's fine, now I promise. I just roughed him up a bit and told him to quit the show and then offered to fill in for him!" The demon smiled.
"Why didn't the Devils trap contain you" Castiel interjected trying not to get into a racially charged fight.
"I'll save you the journey bud" Shane flicked his wrist and the tomb was ajar. "Open sesame" He smiled widely.
And then it just didn't happen. The pair looked around at the unfamiliar surroundings, totally different from where they had fought for the lives every day just a few years ago.
Dean stared at him, taken aback. He was aware it been been quite a while since they had enjoyed a night solely in each other's company, without something cropping up to ruin it. Whether it was a case Sam had just stumbled across or Jack seeking refuge from a particularly scary nightmare something always seemed to ruin their special moments together. Obviously Cass had noticed this also, since he was able to give such accurate information regarding their lack of special time as of late.
"Don't dude. I find out my best friends a demon and I'm supposed to just go 'fine' and move on" Ryan yelled.
Cass hadn't said a word since Ryan arrived and he looked for quite lack of a better word "constipated" to Dean.
"Probably because we're so far underground I guess" Dean shrugged, pretending to know anything about the ins and outs of filming equipment instead of knowing how to gank any kind of monster imaginable.
Ryan let this information simmer for a second before asking the Angel another question."What you said about Dean earlier, you rescued him from hell. Was he a bad guy?" Ryan pondered.
After Dean and Castiel said their goodbyes to Jack and Sam they made their way to the impala. The hunter loaded up the trunk with some extra gear from the bunker just to be safe. You never know what could happen on a hunt, expect the unexpected he always said.
"Doesn't matter what you call the sons of bitches you still can take em out the same way, isn't that right Cass" Dean used this statement to get a read on whether Cass understood his earlier foot kicking signal to which Cass nodded in agreement. (You know I can read your mind right? Cass told Dean to which Dean thought dude that's creepy don't be all up in my fortress of Dean-itude it's bad vibes man! But.. While your up in my business I don't think this guy is talking in metaphors for all its worth.) Cass nodded in agreement with Dean's inner dialogue deduction.
Dean had to come between them to drag Ryan off of him. The guy had a mean left hook for the size of him, but then again look at those biceps. He obviously lifts Dean thought to himself.
The pair sat in silence for a while after that, just enjoying being in each other's company. Maybe it was their so called "profound bond" with each other but both the hunter and the Angel just felt better when the other was at their side.
"Okay some of the ghouligans might have noticed a thing or two" Shane commented. "Smart cookies they are" He added with a sense of pride.
"You're friend here isn't incorrect". The barkeep chuckled. "I am indeed a man down on my luck you might say, but money is the least of my worries. I'm afraid my troubles are more profound than that." They forlornly stared off into the distance.
The new and improved Buzzfeed unsolved crew made their way up the narrow staircase that led to the Elsa Lemp suite.
"Um Cass buddy, what are you doing?" Dean said through gritted teeth, starting to worry that they'll get jailed for assault.
"This would be the perfect time to use the spirt box, if only someone hadn't broken it" Ryan looked at Shane angrily.
"Careful who your calling wussy boy" Shane's height advantage over the hunter made the lanky demon scarier than Dean had anticipated.
"Look pal, I'm here to do my show with my friend. I don't want any trouble" Shane said sounding irritated.
"Oh yes right. Demon Hell right okay, that's gonna take a while to get used to. Oh boy" The ghost hunter was trying his best to keep somewhat composed.
"Me? Oh I'm swell, just peachy" Ryan stated dryly, as he resisted the strong urge to roll his eyes to this statement.
"Right well if you say so and if that flower really is around here we got to track it down stat. We're  on the clock remember? We've for twelve hours before the door closes" Dean prayed they were right. "Maybe we should ask around pry some of  the locals noggins for info huh?" The hunter suggested to Castiel.
"I was thinking that was fast damn dude! Giving Bolt a run for his money huh?" Ryan jokingly hit his  friends shoulder.
"No your not a bad person Ryan you just reacted to a stressful situation in a physical manner, it's a very natural... a very human response. Here let me see" The Angel crouched to get to Ryan's level.
The trio humoured their adopted son as they sat down and watched the odd happenings unfold on screen from the episode entitled "The Demonic Goatman's bridge"
"Spoil sport" Shane huffed as he scooted to the passenger side and Dean took his rightful spot behind the wheel.
"I'm still not happy that Jack used my credit card without permission" Cass responded in annoyance, actively ignoring Dean's ongoing antics in favour of discussing more domestic and pressing matters than how adorable the hunter would have looked carrying a firearm around town in his new tote.
"Goodnight Shane...again" Ryan said tiredly, wishing he could just lay his head to rest so this day could finally be over.
"Dean, Cass this is my annoying co-host Shane" Ryan gestured lazily to the lanky man, still clearly angered with Shane's lack of enthusiasm in ghost hunting.
Sam shrugged. “I don’t know, something. We’ll figure it out, we always do. Just don’t give up, okay, Cas?”
Dean shook his head, his hands coming forward to grip tight in Castiel’s coat. “No, you’re not. Don’t say that.”
The calls kept coming in, from all over the country. The Google alerts that Sam had set up to track signs of monster activity pinged constantly, showing a dramatic increase of restless monsters all over the globe. It was an inexplicable flood and it kept them busy.
Castiel held him there, blade shaking slightly against his throat. “I need to go. I’ll hurt you. I’ll hurt Sam.”
He stared into her surprised face for a long moment, watching the shock and fear in her eyes. She didn’t understand what was happening. The pain was overwhelming. She wanted to be at home with her girls.
Dean slammed his duffle bag down on the war room table, his shoulders tense, his jaw grinding. He was angry, Castiel knew, not at him but at the situation. It didn’t help and the Mark reacted to all anger the same.
Dean’s brows raised. “Alright, just checking.” But he watched Castiel for the rest of the night, eyes drifting to him constantly in the rear view mirror.
“How?” Castiel asked. “This was our plan. The only way we’d ever be free.” He glanced at Sam and Dean, held both their gazes. “There is no fixing this.”
“Listen, Cas, I have lost you too many goddamn times, okay?” he said, voice shaking. “I’m not adding another to the list. There has to be another way.”
Castiel curled up tighter, closed his eyes, imagined Jack in front of him. He was grateful for his exacting memory now; it meant he could picture Jack perfectly, down to the last hair.
It went against everything that should have been possible. Of course, werewolves could have a familial structure–Garth was living proof of that. But these werewolves were wild, feral, with absolutely no control or memory of their actions on full moon nights. Co-existence shouldn’t have been possible, but here they were, slavering for the Winchesters’ blood, all the same.
The bunker was dark, the Winchesters assumedly gone to bed. He had nothing to pack, no possessions to his name besides his blade and the keys to his truck. Quietly, he left Jack’s room and crept down the hall. He refused to look back; he couldn’t risk polluting this one-time refuge anymore than he already had.
At first, it was endearing, a sign of Dean’s silent care for him. He had only to meet Dean’s eyes to know that he was wanted here. Maybe not in the way Castiel ultimately desired, but that didn’t make it meaningless.
As soon as the wound was healed, Castiel shoved himself to his feet and fled. Dean found him outside, leaning heavily on the Impala. He took Castiel by the shoulders and gripped him tight and kept him from flying apart.
It felt like hours later when Castiel came back to himself, hunched over among the dead. He couldn’t tell what parts belonged to the monsters and what belonged to the people he’d meant to save when he’d walked in there.
On a particularly bad day, running out of town after a grueling hunt, Castiel caught Dean staring again in the rear view mirror. The anger exploded out of him without warning.
And Castiel did miss him. He could ignore the ache, sometimes; in some ways, the Mark made that easier. But Jack, the boy he’d sworn to protect before he was even born, the one who was meant to usher in a bright future of peace on Earth, was gone. Castiel had failed him, just like he failed every other thing he cared about.
“Figures, that as soon as we actually get things settled, shit hits the fan,” Dean said, throwing their machetes into the trunk and slamming it shut.
Sam twisted in his seat, meeting Castiel’s eyes. “Dean’s right, Cas. We get some breathing room from these back to back hunts, it’ll buy some time.”
“Damn, I hope those two will be alright,” Dean said, slumping into a seat at the war table. “Sam just got her back, y’know?”
When howling stopped and the beast was so much ash, Castiel looked to Dean. He was staring at Castiel, and the fear Castiel saw there cut through the anger, just a little. But then the next werewolf closed in and the anger swept back in, eclipsing everything else.
