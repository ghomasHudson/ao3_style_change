“Four,” Dean choked out, his voice still strong. Red welts formed along the curves of his back. He was a strong man, and Castiel knew that Dean wouldn’t buckle until blood was drawn.  He drew back the leather strap, and let it fly. The sharp thud of leather against skin vibrated throughout the room, followed now by small moans. Dean was no longer able to hold them back. Castiel was glad, because that meant that Dean was getting close. Castiel swung again, watching the belt bite against skin, and finally seeing blood rise to the surface and drip down his back. Dean always required a blood penitence.
“It was just a few years before his death,” Castiel continued. “His ministry was growing, and he was traveling a lot. He had his followers. The ones that stayed with him… some of them were lovers, and some of them were dear friends.” Dean quirked an eyebrow up at that. “They made up their own little family. He preached love everywhere he went. And he preached grace and generosity. Service one to another.” Castiel ducked his head. “But I digress. We were sitting in a makeshift home he was staying at, talking. He had been working on a piece of wood, a carved figure for one of his friends. I was very taken with his beauty. His soul shone so brightly. He noticed my obvious, uh…. adoration, and he leaned over, his face near my face. I remember I could hardly breathe, even though I don’t really breathe. He smiled so kindly, like it was he who adored me. And then he kissed me. I remember I felt it all the way to my soul. It burned. But in a good way. Much like when I kiss you, Dean.”
Then, as though nothing had changed, he and Sam went on to live a normal life in the bunker, taking cases when they came up. They had a dog Dean named Miracle. Dean even got to go to a pie eating contest. Sam pied him in the face, like the little bitch he was, but the pie he ate was delicious. It was pie. Things went really sideways from there.
“More than ok, Dean,” Cas said through a grin, pulling Dean by the neck, back down to his lips, once again rolling his hips up to Dean’s.
Dean leaned into Cas to give him a quick peck on his forehead. Then he pressed his forehead to Cas’. Cas leaned into Dean, and snuggled his arm again, rubbing his thumb over Dean’s hand. Dean gazed at Cas, eyes closed, still grinning. He’d fallen back to sleep quickly. Dean could feel Cas’ heartbeat on his arm as he listened to him breathe. Dean smiled at that, and closed his eyes, finally calm. He was sound asleep a few minutes later.
Dean still hadn’t told Sam anything Cas said before the Empty took him. Sam still only had a vague understanding of why the Empty even took Cas. He knew there was something his brother wasn’t telling him, but he also knew when it was best to keep his mouth shut, and wait for Dean to bring it up. The thing about Dean and feelings though, meant that there was only a slim chance of Dean not shoving it down so far he never talked about it again. Still, Sam waited.
“Gross? What? I was just trying to help,” Dean objected. “I don’t know why you guys are booing me. I was the victim in the scenario.”
A pajama clad Cas and Dean strolled into the kitchen around noon only to find Jack and Claire drinking coffee and chattering about Krissy. Apparently Jack liked her liked her, and was seeking Claire’s advice on his next steps.
If he stopped to think about it, the dream wasn’t all bad. The dog. The pie. The vamp-mimes. Even the highlight reel of Sam’s life. But the Empty taking Cas? That still scared the Hell out of Dean. Never getting to tell him how he felt, that he was loved? That shook him to his very core. Telling Sammy goodbye while they both ugly cried? Like a knife to the heart. Dying on a rusty nail? What the actual fuck! John fucking Winchester living right next door? Anger rose in his throat and his hands at the thought. Not seeing Cas again in Heaven? That killed Dean the most.
“Jack, you know better than that,” Cas smarted. “But Dean, he does have a point,” he said, tilting his head, and raising his eyebrows.
“How could you think that I can just turn my feelings off and on like that?” Dean asked, incredulously.  “I just kissed you. I told you I love you. I fully intend on fucking you silly here at some point.” Dean grinned at that.
Dean knew all of this logically. Sam was safe. He had Cas, here, beside him. Jack was back at home in the bunker, and Dean had seen him bring everyone back. Amara was watching over everything for now: Heaven, Earth, the universe, parallel universes. But there was something about the Empty taking Cas, it struck a chord in Dean, and continued to trigger these nightmares in him, even months later.
Dean leaned his smile into Cas’ and kissed him softly, velvety lips pressing gently into one another. Dean pulled away unhurriedly, eyes closed and smiling. He languidly serried tender kisses along Cas’ jawline, over his cheek bone, up to his forehead, lingering there as he tangled his fingers in Cas’ hair, holding him close.
“You’re saying releasing my grace would trigger a nuclear meltdown?” Cas, perplexed, scrunched his eyebrows together, and squinted up at the ceiling as Dean licked circles into his Adam’s apple.
He turned over toward Cas, took in his sleepy serenity, and rested his hand over Cas’ heartbeat once again. He listened to his breaths, breathing with him to try and let the damn dream go. It had been getting better in the last few weeks, but Dean couldn’t wait until the dream just stopped all together.
“You know what? It’s never been about you being an angel or a human. It’s only ever been about you being you. You’re my Cas. Not Cas, the angel, or Cas, who changed his name to Steve, and worked at the Gas ‘N’ Sip, although you were pretty cute then.” Dean gave a lopsided smirk, and Cas grinned and blushed. “Don’t you get it by now, Man? I’ll take you any way I can get you. I love you, Cas. You're kinda the love of my life.”
“Getting to know you over these many years together has added another layer, and I started to long for you, not yet realizing that I was in love with you. By the time I had surmised my feelings for you, I didn’t believe you felt the same. It was only after I made the deal with Empty to save Jack, that I really started to wonder if you loved me in return. But not wanting to give you up, I could never tell you the truth. It became an impossible situation,” Cas finished.
“Why didn’t you ever say anything, Man?” Dean asked incredulously, running his fingers through his hair.
Sam ambled over to the coffee maker. He held his hands up to Dean, motioning for him to stop, as he turned away from him, snickering.
“I know, I know, shut my cakehole. But honestly, stop being so sickeningly sweet then,” she retorted.
He kissed Dean hard while he pushed Dean’s shoulders back, and scooted him off his lap. Dean backed up, taking Cas’ mouth with him as he moved into a kneeling position on the bed. He drew Cas up with him and tugged him close, slipping his hands down the back of Cas’ fleece pajama bottoms to cup his ass. As though they were of one mind, Cas’ hands copied the motions of Dean’s, all the while sucking and licking hotly at each other’s mouths.
“I know I would love to watch you do some naked cooking, but I think we would break Sam and Eileen. And I don’t even want to think about the girls or Jack,” Dean chortled as he pinched Cas’ nipple.
“I can’t with you people anymore!” Dean declared, and turned back to soaking the french toast, and crisping the bacon.
“Well, I wanted to wake you up. That was the needy part of me, the selfish part of me. But I guess the stronger part of me looked at you lying there all peaceful, and I wanted to let you stay that way. I still put my hand on you to make sure you were real and breathing. God, I never want to lose you again,” Dean let out a heavy sigh.
Cas was sprawled out in one of the comfy chairs in the library. His trench coat and suit jacket had been neatly arranged over the chair beside him. His sleeves were rolled up over crossed arms, and his feet were propped up on a captain’s chair he’d pulled out from the table. There was a hitch in Dean’s throat when he saw him. Cas’ head slumped over onto his right shoulder. He’d fallen asleep.
The bunker had become a safe place to land for any hunter. They were always welcome to stay as long as they wanted, and to come and go as they pleased, as long as they did a daily check in. Nowadays, the bunker was always a bustling hub. Claire and Alex were frequent visitors. So, were Charlie and Stevie, and Bobby. Donna and Jody visited when they could too. Hell, they even saw Rowena and Ketch every couple of months. She’d done a spell to bring Arthur back from the dead, since he’d already been in Hell anyway, and they’d been happily dating these many months. Krissy had been spending a lot of time with Jack when they were both around. Dean had actually described it to Cas as cute. And Jack...Well, he was just busy being a kid, taking in everything he learned like a sponge.
Dean stared at their childish antics for a moment before shaking his head in disbelief. And then he gave in.
“I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m guessing you made your bed. And I’m not awake yet,” Sam blurted.
“I know. I mean that’s not something a guy forgets easily after seeing The Blob swipe his best friend,” Dean told him sardonically, looking him straight in the eyes.
When he and Sam walked through the door into the bunker with Miracle, the library tables were lit dimly with amber lamps, but no one was at them. He hurried down the stairs, and walked toward the galley kitchen. He started to walk past the nook where he and Cas sat together sometimes, and stopped suddenly.
“But really,” he’d added, “I have to lump you all together as a unit, my family unit, because you are all my one selfish thing. You and Sam are my dads too. All of you took it upon yourselves to help humanity when Chuck vanished, before that even. You took it upon yourselves to raise and protect me. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you.”
When Dean opened his eyes later on in the morning, he was still forehead to forehead with Cas, but Cas was staring back at him.
It was deep into autumn of 2021, when Dean awoke from another nightmare in a cold sweat. He instinctively reached out for Cas to reassure him it was only a dream. Cas was there, peacefully sleeping, taking in soft, quiet breaths that Dean was relieved he could hear. He rested his hand lightly on Cas’ chest just long enough to feel his heart beating before pulling it back. Maybe Dean’s body had been still while he dreamt this time, if his mind was not. Maybe Cas had finally gotten used to Dean’s night thrashing and pained wails, and stayed asleep this time. Dean wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to it.
He pulled his head back to watch the look that came across Cas’ face when he came. So damn gorgeous. So damn hot. And that was enough to make Dean come just then. Cas sensed him tensing. He splayed his hands over Dean’s ass, gripping tightly as Dean raised and thrusted, his body planked over Cas, giving way to a powerful orgasm.
Dean laid there on top of Cas, his nose against the hickey he created on Cas’ neck. Cas closed his eyes, and pressed his cheek into Dean’s sweaty hair, a smile crossing his face. He was thrumming with pleasure. He loved the weight of Dean over him. He loved Dean’s smell. Most of all, he loved how they were chest to chest, and he could feel both of their heartbeats pumping together as though they were one.
“Cas, I’m glad you’re back. I’ll let Dean fill you in on everything. Miracle can hang with me tonight. I’m going to go text Eileen, and crash out.” Sam excused himself, followed by Miracle, who was cheerfully wagging his tail with gusto.
“Dean, it’s ok, you don’t have to explain. Growing old together implies a lifetime commitment- It’s ok if that’s not what you want” Cas offered, looking down, crestfallen.
Dean’s hands were beneath Cas’ t-shirt faster than he could say Zeppelin. He tugged it off, and tossed it to the floor in one fluid motion. Then he bit Cas’ shoulder and left a trail of wet kisses along his collar bone. Cas dug his nails into Dean’s back, making him let out a low squeal, as he thrust into Cas’ stomach.
Cas slipped a hand under Dean’s t-shirt. He kneaded at his pecs, and pinched his nipples. He traced a line from the hills of Dean’s chest through the valleys of his ribs, down to his stomach and over each jutting hip bone. Cas suddenly pulled back from Dean then.
Dean was the first to get Cas’ pants off. He tugged them down over Cas’ hips before bringing his hands back to rub over the smooth ass muscle and down to the backs of Cas’ thighs. Dean stopped kissing him then, looking at him wolfishly. He clutched Cas’ shoulders and drove him back down on the bed. Cas kicked at his pant legs while Dean tugged them off. He stopped to take in all of Cas’ glory; his muscular, tan legs, his hard cock standing toward Heaven, his taut abdomen, his hips jutting sexily, his thick pecs and strong arms, and finally his devastatingly handsome face.
“Are you truly good or are you just saying that to avoid talking about it?” Cas looked him directly in the eyes.
“In the beginning, feelings were new to me. I didn’t know what I was feeling, not really. I certainly didn’t understand it. Later on, I was never sure if you felt the same, and the fear of rejection or alienating you kept me from saying anything. I didn’t want to lose your friendship. After my deal with the Empty- Well, I couldn’t say anything on the off chance that you’d reciprocate. So, I contented myself with just being near you,” Cas explained.
Dean’s eyes went back to Cas once Sam was safely out of the room. Cas stared back with, a wistful grin crossing his face.
“I just want you. But I want to make sure this is what you really want.” Dean lifted his eyebrows, and looked Cas in the eyes. “Is this what you really want?”
Dean kissed him softly at first. When Cas slid his hands around to Dean’s lower back, Dean kissed him harder, with more urgency. He curled his fingers into Cas’ neck, drug them gently through his hair, his tongue exploring Cas’ mouth. Cas tugged him closer, no longer wanting any hint of space between them. He bit and sucked Dean’s bottom lip, wanting to hang off of it forever.
Cas continued to slumber. So, Dean walked carefully over to him, and placed his hand on his shoulder.
“Dean, I want to fuck you,” Cas said in a deep and filthy voice, pressing his tongue hard into Dean’s neck before sucking.
“I wanted to let you sleep. I thought you needed it. Would you like to talk about the dream?” Cas asked quietly.
He heard the toilet flush, and then the water running before Cas opened the door and stumbled back to bed. He climbed in, rolled onto his right side so he was facing Dean before getting himself tucked back in.
Cas stormed over to Dean, who turned away quickly when he saw Cas coming, and smacked him in the ass.
The two stayed in close proximity as they walked. Dean pulled Cas through the doorway of his bedroom, letting go of his wrist once they were inside. Then Dean closed the door behind them.
Sam and Miracle were a few steps behind Dean when they all came across a sleeping Cas. Sam practically bumped into Dean when Dean halted abruptly. Miracle stopped at Dean’s side, and studied Cas curiously before letting out a questioning, "woof." Dean, mouth agape, stared in awe at Cas for a moment before calling out to him.
“I- I think I get that. I’ve never, uh, never been good with my feelings, and you scared the Hell out of me at first, Man. I was, I was in awe of you. You were my savior at the start, then my best friend, then my brother, and uh, by the time I got around to accepting how I felt, I thought, Dude’s an angel, no way does he feel the same, but you did. You- did feel the same. But then you said it...and you died. You died, Cas. To save me. I’m not great with my um, feelings in the first place, but that’s a damn lot to process,” Dean responded.
Cas scooted himself over to Dean, draped himself over Dean’s upper body, and started nuzzling his neck. Dean moaned agreeably.
“My hand was on you, and I could feel your heart beating. So, I left it there and listened to you breathe, and it gave me something to focus on, ya know? Then I started to breathe with you. After that, I laid there remembering the night you came back. I remembered kissing you, and just finally feeling like I was home.” Dean smiled warmly at Cas, and Cas could see the love in those sparkling green eyes.
Cas stirred slowly. When he opened his eyes, they immediately found Dean’s own staring back at him. Cas pulled his feet back from the chair they’d been propped up on.
Sammy and Eileen had been busy. Eileen was about 8 months pregnant, and they were both over the moon with excitement, as was Dean, who secretly loves babies, although this was no secret to Cas.
“Yes, and thankfully you’re no longer a demon. That’s a period of life I’d rather not be reminded of,” Cas remarked.
Cas felt the fiery heat of Dean’s come on his cock as they rocked together gently, chasing every ounce of orgasm they had until their movements became languid before stopping altogether.
“I want you to hold onto it,” Cas said. “It seems strange to plan out a trip to Heaven, as though it’s a vacation, but I want to go there with you when it’s time, and I want you to keep my grace with you until then. We’ll make the rest up as we go.”
Dean had pulled Jack into a hug, kissed the top of his head, and said, “I love you, Kid. Thank you.”
He wrapped his arms around Cas and rolled him over onto his back. Dean straddled him, and sat up to yank his t-shirt off. Cas watched as a flash of blue got swept up with Dean’s shirt, before it dropped down to the middle of his chest, and Dean whipped his t-shirt to the floor. A vial of gleaming blue fluorescence dangled from a black cord around his neck.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I would have given anything for you not to find that out under those circumstances, but it was the only thing I could do to save you.” Cas tilted his head down, and looked up at Dean, a hollow half grin subtly creeping across his face.
Cas, who was standing in front of Dean’s desk, said, “I’d like you to try the thing you’d like to try, but I think we’re also going to have to have a conversation. So, perhaps some sort of compromise, or maybe both options?”
It went without saying that having someone to walk through the big blue world with, meant everything to each of them, although they would never stop saying it. They were each other’s partner in crime, each other’s wing man, each other’s best friend, each other’s brother in arms, each other’s twin flame, each other first love, each other’s soulmate.
“No, I think I’m pretty good. I was listening to you breathe. It helped,” Dean said as he reached out and put his hand on Cas’ chest.
“Fine, take his side,” Dean mumbled, mimicking Cas’ statement. And then, under his breath, “Giving me the head tilt and the eyes.”
Dean’s face became serious as he spoke, “Honestly, no BS. I’m good. I settled myself down for a change. Not that you don’t help. You do. Actually you still did last night too. You were just unconscious.”
Vamps kidnapped a couple of kids after killing their dad, and leaving their mom alive, but without her tongue. The vamps wanted to keep the kids to raise as their own. They wore the kind of creepy clown masks that you’d see in a Rob Zombie movie. Sam and he tracked them down, fought them hard, and knew the kids were safe, when Dean was impaled on a rogue piece of rebar, which was all the more horrible considering Dean felt like he knew his way around a vamp nest better than any monster site.
When Dean finally pulled the Impala into the gravel patch outside of the bunker, it was almost 11 o’clock at night. The sky was clear. The stars were out. Miracle was chomping at the bit to check out his new digs. Both Dean and Sam were exhausted, and Dean’s nerves were shot. He was trying to keep himself calm by reminding himself if Cas wasn’t there, he would go on. But he didn’t want to go on without Cas. Round and round with his emotions he went. Like a bad joke on the side of a cereal box, it was a vicious circle.
“Listen Cas, not for nothing, but I don’t know where I’d be without you,” Dean said reassuringly. “As for the feelings, you can eat ‘em, drink ‘em to death, or shove ‘em down far enough to forget you have ‘em. And if none of those things work, there’s always sex,” Dean said with a wink.
“Hey!” Dean hollered, a smirk on his face. “Who’s being gross in front of the children now?” He chastised.
“Everyone’s picking on me!” Dean told her melodramatically while he signed, trying to gain her sympathy.
They’d talked a little about what they wanted to do with this life, but beyond spending it together, neither of them were particular to doing anything specific. Monster cases still came up, and they still worked them, although they were a lot less now, as Jack had said they would be. It was strange to think that even in the monster and demon worlds, things were more balanced as well. So, sure, there was still bad, but it was more manageable all around.
Since Jack, Sam and he had found a way to deal with Chuck, balance had been restored, and the world put back. Everyone Chuck had snapped out of existence, Jack had resurrected. Jack said he wouldn’t be a hands-on God, but he wasn’t just going to leave Cas in the Empty. It had been Cas who’d been instrumental in instigating Heaven’s redesign, after all. It had been Cas who’d taught Jack about life, about family, about love.
Cas came first in hot pulses, warmth spreading to Dean’s stomach. As he tensed, and curled into Dean, Dean drove his cock down hard against Cas, working him through it, and helping himself along in the process.
“Dean, are you sure you’ll still want me if I’m no longer an angel?” Cas’ voice was low and soft, but still matter of fact. There was an added ache to it. He looked away from Dean shyly.
The dream picked up with a bittersweet music montage set to Running on Empty, and during that, Dean saw images of everyone they’d lost along the way. Jo. Ellen. Bobby. Kevin. Charlie.
“Ok then,” Dean said as he closed the distance between him and Cas. He stood in front of Cas, looked him directly in the eyes, and fixed both of his hands on each of Cas’ cheeks, his thumbs and forefingers framing Cas’ ears. He gazed into the deep blue eyes in front of him for a moment. All at once Cas’ face was pleading, apologetic, and tranquil.
When Cas opened his hand, Dean saw what looked like a piece of clear crystal quartz with a gleaming, neon blue light inside.
Dean laid there with Cas, just being grateful for their lives and their life together. He was grateful for their found family. He was grateful for Sam and Eileen and Baby Winchester. He was grateful he didn’t have to shoulder the burden of everything anymore. Having a bunch of trusted friends and family was so much better than just him and Sam having to depend on only each other for everything. Plus, more people around meant more brains to puzzle stuff out when something big happened. Not that he didn’t love Sammy. He still worried, but that’s when it was nice to have Cas by his side to reign him in and give him perspective.
But that was the thing. He really did love them all. And he could finally say those words to them out loud. Anytime. This family had given him that.
Cas and Dean laid in their bed, naked, and tangled up in each other, sheets and blankets strewn across the floor. Dean was nestled into Cas, his head resting on Cas’ chest, his fingers grazing the fine hairs there. Cas curled an arm around Dean, his fingers entwined in Dean’s chestnut hair. Dean was pressed up tightly against Cas with his leg hooked over Cas’ hips, his toes nuzzled behind Cas’ knee. Dean listened to him breathe, tuning his own breaths to the rhythm of Cas’. He didn’t know when it happened, but at some point, Dean stopped wondering where he began and Cas ended, feeling so close that they were one.
He slapped Cas on the ass playfully and sat up on the side of the bed. Cas hung himself over Dean’s shoulders, and began kissing his neck. Dean smiled sweetly, reaching up to grab Cas’ arm with his hand.
The two of them had come a long way together in twelve years. Thinking back, both men agreed that it was love at first sight, although neither of them knew what to do with their feelings at the time. Things were easier now. Both of them finally letting one another in on their love for each other had triggered a healing process in both of them. The bad parts of their collective past would never disappear, but the good parts of their collective present and their foreseeable future helped to alleviate its pain. They had finally found a place to rest.
God, Cas had been living around Sam for so long now, he’d picked up one of Sam’s more annoying quirks. Dean thought it looked especially cute on Cas though. He met Cas’ eyes and beamed.
“Are you really?” Cas pressed, as he too eased himself up onto his elbow and forearm, now eye to eye with Dean.
Cas shook his head, and took a deep breath. “It’s not that. It’s just that on occasion, this feeling overcomes me, and I can’t believe this is real. We’re real. It never seemed like something I could dare dream about before, and yet, here we are, and I get to touch you whenever I want. I get to have sexual relations with you. I get to tell you I love you. It’s all so overwhelming sometimes, being human.”
Cas bucked wildly beneath Dean and he knew he was close. So, he slipped a hand under Cas’ ass to pull him tighter, as he let his head fall into Cas’ neck. Cas obliged by grabbing both of Dean’s ass cheeks and clamping him down, both of them rocking, and holding on for dear life.
He knew the dream wasn’t like the PTSD visions of Hell he’d had for years after getting out, which were bad enough. The dream was bad in a different way. The two people he cared about most in the world were both dead, and it was like all the personal growth he’d done in the last 15 years didn’t matter. It just got thrown out. And not that he didn't still love Sam more than life itself, but he had reverted back to a toxically codependent relationship with Sam. All the feelings he had for Cas were just frozen with no place to go. Cas never knew how much he was loved. Dean never got to be ok with who he really was. Hell, he never got to realize who he really was.
He let go of Cas, and rocked back onto his knees. Dean’s cock pointed directly at Cas, as he shimmied his pants down his legs, dropping them down to the floor. He arranged his body to match over the length of Cas’. He drew in toward Cas’ mouth to plant a kiss onto his lips. He loved the feel of Cas’ stubble against his own. He thrusted into Cas’ hips. Cas thrashed his hips up to Dean, erect cocks sliding together, back and forth. Cas clutched Dean’s ass and pulled him down harder, crushing their erections together, grinding mercilessly into each other.
“Sometimes, I forget what it must be like for you to be human. I mean, I’ve always been one even when I was a demon. And look, man, for what it’s worth, you’re one of the best damn humans I’ve ever known.” Dean offered.
Dean brightened then before saying, “So, let me get this straight. As usual, we were both a couple of dumb asses.” He beamed and started to chuckle.
“No comments from the four year old!” Dean harped. “And besides that, your Auntie Amara is holding down the fort in Heaven right now, while you- what? Are you about to start dating?”
The vial was a clear quartz crystal with neon blue light inside. It was about the size of his pinky finger. Dean pulled the vial to his lips and kissed it before letting it fall in the cleft between his pecs.
Cas put his hand into his shirt, and felt around for something. Dean watched and waited, as Cas pulled a long black cord away from his chest, from beneath his shirt, his hand clutching something at the end of it. He tilted his head down, and pulled the black cord over it. He held his hand out to Dean.
“Dean, I am God now. I’m hardly a child anymore,” Jack proclaimed, raising his eyebrows as he held his pointer finger into the air.
His first class was Science, which he hated because he just wanted to thank Dean for what he had done. He would have to save his thankfulness for later, in English.
Castiel nodded, sitting up straight and looking at the TV. It was only the news, the same monotonous news reporter from the night they announced Lucifer’s escape, was on.
“Hello Cas!” Dean’s mom exclaimed, before wrapping her arms tightly around the boy in front of him. She settled her hands in front of her chest and signed
“That’s not the point,” their mother snapped in a hushed voice, “I don’t really want to talk about my lunatic of a son, while eating my dinner.”
Dean shrugged, “not really; the conversation itself defaces your whole opinion on religion,” he said, “and I know how much you love religion and how much is has corrupted majority of today’s society into doing idiotic things.”
Mary didn’t seem to against Dean and Sam staying home until Lucifer had been caught. The fact was; she’d been worried about them all day. So, knowing they were home made her feel better – but only a little.
Castiel tried hard not to laugh; he lifted his fist up to his mouth and bit on one of his knuckles, hoping the noise wouldn’t come through.
Gabriel rolled his eyes, “not important, anyway, Lucifer had gone out that night for some party and mother found out, Castiel was supposed to be covering him, saying he was in his room studying or something but when Lucifer found out Castiel had failed, he got a knife from the kitchen when he was drunk stupid and then...” Gabriel mimicked a crude stabbing movement, causing Michael to flinch and glare at his younger brother.
When his mother came home that afternoon she was happy to hear that Castiel had decided to go back to school. Michael had told nothing about the events in which had made Michael force Castiel to stay home for a week, his mother had just assumed that the pressures of a normal school environment were weighing heavily on his shoulders and had never questioned if it was anything else. Castiel didn’t know whether it made it easier or harder, having a mother that just assumed everything and never asked questions because she thought she was right all the time.
“Hello little brother,” Gabriel said, standing in front of Castiel’s locker with a smirk on his face, he turned to look at Dean, “hello cradle snatcher.”
“The other two plates are for Charlie and Adam,” Mary said, serving dinner. It looked excellent, steaming hot and welcoming. The last time Castiel had had a home cooked meal like this was when one of his mother’s executives had been over for dinner. That had been about three months ago. Everything was microwave done now, including some of their family meals. Like on the night he’d found out Lucifer was free.
“That isn’t going to help you, you know?” Gabriel stated, looking amused, “if anything it’s going to put you even more on edge.”
“Yes, yes, you’ll get your pissy pity party,” Lucifer said angrily, “I get it, more publicity because people will feel sorry for you – you’ll be talked about for weeks, you and the tragic murder of your youngest son.”
Castiel tried to ignore all the whisperings and the jokes; that retards must run in the family, but it was hard. Especially whenever he turned a corner, he was still worried that Lucifer would be there, waiting for him, blending in with the crowd of students making their way to class. Lucifer would drag him into a broom closet or a bathroom or abandoned classroom. He would raise a knife, and would finish the job he had started.
Castiel Novak had been five years old when his twelve year old brother had started, playfully, holding a knife to his neck. He’d be asked to do things; do Lucifer’s homework, make his bed, make him a sandwich, get him a juice box.
Dean looked up, the teacher stood at the front of the class, her hands on her hips and her lips pressed together tightly, Dean’s face turned red slightly but he looked up at the teacher confidently and without fear.
Thank you to everyone that has been reading, finally a chapter in which the plot has progressed massively xD
“I don’t know how much time you can take off school,” Mary said, nibbling at her lower lip worriedly, “Dean, Sam, I think you’re safe to go...” she still looked nervous, uncertain about her decision, “he shouldn’t know what you look like. Gabriel and Michael however...”
It was hard getting back to sleep, because scenes from his dreams seemed to print themselves on the back of his eyelids in the impenetrable darkness. He found himself clutching at his pillow a lot, crying silently in the darkness in his room, he kept seeing things; the silhouette of a tall boy or man, moving slowly towards him, he would screw up his eyes and when he couldn’t stand keeping them shut anymore; open them and nothing would be there.
“I don’t understand why you didn’t just unlock the door with your house keys,” Sam muttered with a mouth full of chips, “you scared the crap out of everyone, including Cas, with all your banging on the door.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, “I was about ninety percent sure that he wanted to be inside me because he always looked at me in a weird, sexual type way,” he said, “but like, then a few weeks after I thought I had it all figured out, he had a girlfriend so I guess I read that wrong.”
Castiel doubted his mother would care, but it was good to tell her anyway, otherwise, they would probably get into trouble for not notifying her. This could probably be a great situation for her to get even more publicity.
Here's another chapter for you guys! I'll try and write another one ASAP but here is your fix for now. I spent most of the day working on my photography assignment and then reading The Scorch Trials by James Dashner. However, I finished this chapter last night, so really I could have uploaded it last night. Either way, sorry for the wait.
Michael slowly removed his hand from Gabriel’s mouth, “kitchen?” he asked, whispering back. Michael nodded and they slowly headed toward a door way near the brightly lit kitchen.
Dean hadn’t been around for recess, and that worried Castiel slightly, but he was sure the boy would turn up in English; he never skipped classes and he had already been told by some girl in Dean’s class, Ashley that Dean was at school today. As he headed towards his English class, he eyed the line from the door and found Dean in the middle of it. He walked towards him and stood next to him, ignoring everyone’s conversation around him. He got out a slip of paper and was about to write something, using the palm of his left hand as a table, but Dean put his hand on top of the note, therefore on top of Castiel hand and shook his head, “later,” he whispered, “when we’re in class.”
Castiel nodded with a small frown and picked up another pancake. Once again, it felt like a little pathetic version of teenage rebellion, as he stuffed it into his mouth like Dean had done.
Dinner that night was much less eventful for Castiel than the last one. There was no spilling of gravy all over his clothes, and this time he felt free to take off his scarf. No one stared at his scars, even his mother still did sometimes when they were eating and he had his scarf off. But nobody even gave them a second look, and not in a way that suggested everyone was avoiding looking at him, but in a way that said, ‘we don’t think you’re a freak.’
Castiel had no idea what he had expected the next day; but it definitely wasn’t Dean Winchester sitting down next to him purposefully in every class they shared, which was about three classes. English, History and Math; the other three classes he had were electives and Science.
Castiel was relieved when Dean’s mother wasn’t judgemental about his lack of voice. Sam was upstairs in his room reading, but he’d come down and said ‘hi’ for a few minutes, then went back to bed, coughing as he did so.
Mary was home at five minutes past five, with take out and surprisingly she had enough for everyone, “Charlie gave me a call,” she said, “said that you guys had come over so I grabbed some extra food.”
He heard whispering, he saw hands grabbing at him, felt a knife pressed against his throat, felt his back against the cold tile of a floor, he heard rushing water, he heard evil laughter, maniac even. He saw cold piercing eyes, the colour kept changing between blue and red and black. He felt his stomach drop.
Castiel looked nervously at both Dean and Gabriel, thinking that he was in trouble, before he made his way towards the office. When he entered, it was small, and he didn’t know how the overweight principal made himself fit in here. It was cold, small, but pristine clean. There was a black phone on the desk, cordless. Castiel picked it up slowly, but didn’t know how to alert the other person he was there.
His brother’s apologised for not telling him; and Castiel explained that he already knew and realistically he had no reason to carry on like that; they were just trying to protect him. They ended up hugging him and sitting down with him in the lounge room while he drank his tea.
He walked out the front door, where Michael was sitting in his car, Gabriel sitting next to him in the front seat; they both looked excited, while Castiel was freaking out. He walked towards the car and got into the back seat, throwing his bag in there in front of him before he got in. The car was playing some hippie rock song that Castiel had never heard. Castiel was more into classical music. It helped him breathe.
They rushed into the kitchen, Dean following in behind them, “what the hell is going on?” he asked, starting to sound a little frustrated.
Michael and Gabriel were asleep and it was four in the morning. It was cold, Dean and Castiel were wrapped in their blankets and sitting in beanbags. The TV was on, but the video game was paused, the slight hum of the TV being the only sound that filled the room. Castiel was tired, but he also didn’t want to sleep. But it wasn’t because he was afraid of Lucifer showing up and killing Castiel in his sleep. He was enjoying the time he was spending with Dean.
Dean sat at the edge of the couch, and held Castiel’s hand; he felt the pad of Dean’s thumb rub across the top of his knuckles soothingly. He closed his eyes at the sensation, and lay down on the couch. He could almost go to sleep this way. With everything slowly being taken care of, he could feel himself relax a little. There was a voice in the back of his mind, telling him he should still be cautious, but he blocked it out for the moment.
“So, what’s going on at home that makes you want to leave so desperately?” Dean asked, “This is the second time you’ve been here simply because you can’t stand being home.”
Castiel would rather be poor and have a decent mother than be rich and have a mother who used her children as an accessory.
Castiel frowned, but did as he was told, wiping his cheeks despite the fact that his tears were almost dried up on his face anyway. Before leaving the kitchen, he turned around and caught his mother’s attention before pointing towards the phone and cocking up a brow.
Chuck got out his phone, “I’ll contact them now,” he said, heading into another room, “what school do you boys go to?”
He rushed towards the toilet as quickly as he could, which was surprisingly speedy, but it helped that everybody was in class and that there was no one to swerve his body around.
When Castiel woke up, he could sense people around him before he saw, or even heard them. His vision was blurry and everything around him felt fuzzy. He slowly began to remember everything that had happened. The phone call in the principal’s office, running away from everyone and finding himself at the Winchester house and then fainting at Mary Winchester’s feet and all because of...
Now was probably the best time to tell everyone than any. Half of the people who would protect him the most were in this room, hell; he even had a good feeling about Chuck.
“There’s really no point in making a plan,” Gabriel said with a small snort, “it’s not like he’s some major assassin.”
The captain of the football team, Ashton Moseby, had Castiel pinned against the locker and he was shouting him while repetitively slamming him into the lockers.
Castiel nodded. Curling up even tighter against Dean’s side, to the point where he was practically on top of him.
“I made sure you went to a hospital, rather than a jail,” their mother said softly, “Lucifer, please.”
He remembered the police coming into his hospital room and asking him for a re-telling of the situation, but not being able to talk.
Ever since Gabriel had pointed it out, Castiel was beginning to find himself attracted to Dean. The way he walked, smiled, spoke- he found it attractive, hell, even the way he held a pencil. He was constantly distracted in certain classes because of this; the protruding veins in his hands were sexy for crying out loud.
“I think he should stay here for the night,” Michael said, “so you and Chuck can keep an eye on him – we’ll go get his things.”
Dean looked confused, “but, if you don’t show your total utter faith in the religion, wouldn’t that make her wrong by default?”
She sighed, “really Dean?” Mary asked, sounding defeated, “why can’t you eat like a normal human being?”
“I just saw some pretty heavy looking scars on his neck,” Dean said, “and my opinion of him still hasn’t changed a bit. I’m sure there’s some reason for it and not that he just likes to cut up his own throat from time to time.”
“He said; I’ve only been to my first class; I can’t really give you a detailed analysis on how horrifying this place is yet.”
Dean was cut off when Castiel walked forwards, flung his arms around Dean’s neck and kissed him. Dean’s eyes widened slightly, before they closed on instinct. The warm pressure of another pair of lips against his own was pure Heaven.
“Maybe we should do something nice for her tomorrow morning,” Michael said, “before she goes to work again.”
Dean moved his lips away from his, making Castiel groan with disappointment. Then he felt Dean’s lips move onto his neck, brushing against the scarred skin softly, as if he were afraid of hurting Castiel. Castiel grabbed the back of Dean’s hair, tugging softly, and pushing his own head back, exposing his neck to Dean in a way he’d never done so before.
Mary still looked uncertain, but she grabbed a notepad and began writing down a bunch of numbers, “here are your emergency numbers-.”
When he got to his room, he crawled out the window and climbed down the tree outside, before making his way to Dean’s house.
Dean sighed, a little relieved and grabbed a tea towel from off the bench, “you’re supposed to clear the smoke away from the alarm with a towel – not just wave your hands randomly in the air,” Dean muttered, finally beginning to smell the burnt popcorn as he used the towel to clear the smoke and the smell of smoke away from the alarm. Finally, the alarm shut off and he sighed.
Castiel rolled his eyes as he scrolled through the messages on his phone, before getting out of bed, throwing on any ordinary clothing he could find and telling his brothers that he was going over to Dean’s. They tagged along without even being asked.
“Look, this won’t take long,” Lucifer muttered, “a boy saw me on the way here and he looked awfully suspicious.”
After dinner, Castiel, Michael and Gabriel all volunteered to do the dishes, much to Mary’s amusement. Gabriel and Michael ended up with the job and Dean and Castiel ended up sitting on the lounge room couch, watching the news.
“Dean’s upstairs in his room if you want to talk to him,” Mary said, “If you want, I’ll make you tea or coffee?”
He nodded, his eyes beginning to burn again. He buried his face into Dean’s shoulder. The boy sighed and ran a hand through his hair, making Castiel slowly calm down, “sucks,” he muttered, tiredly, “I’m glad my mother isn’t like that. I mean, she does have two gay children.”
Castiel looked up to see Dean standing in front of him. He’d been so distracted; he hadn’t even noticed the boy walking closer towards him.
“I’ve been to his house before,” Gabriel said, “Dean’s mother won’t judge him at all. No. She won’t call child protective services on you,” Gabriel sighed and covered the phone again, “all she ever gives a shit about,” he muttered to Castiel, who nodded in agreement.
“No need,” Mary said, sitting down to eat while Sam grabbed knives and forks and Dean some plates and bowls for all the Chinese food, “your reward for helping put away the groceries when you didn’t have to.”
, which she seemed to understand, before going upstairs and heading towards Dean’s bedroom door. It was open, and Dean was sitting and listening to music on his stereo.
He nodded and got up, letting his blanket fall to the ground. He wasn’t wearing his regular trench coat – Gabriel noticed it splayed across the back of the couch.
Castiel shrugged and wrote that he was new to the school. Dean nodded and went back to looking towards the front of the class as the teacher began writing things down. Dean looked at James Matthews and rolled his eyes before reaching over and pulling out the guys earphones.
Castiel sighed and began walking towards the car park, looking even more embarrassed than before; like a little kid really. Michael turned towards Dean, looking like a tired man who’s seen a lot of stuff, “thank you for helping my brother,” he said, “I’m sure he appreciates it.”
By one in the morning, Dean knew most of the main phrases when it came to American Sign Language. He just wasn’t fast with his hand movements like Castiel, Gabriel and Michael were. He wondered how long it had taken them all to learn, and their mother- he assumed their mother had learned how to sign as well. She needed to; her son couldn’t talk, so it was only right that she did.
When they got there, Dean opened the door enthusiastically, looking like he was on the verge of death – if you could die from boredom that is.
Castiel didn’t know what to say to that, so when the piece of paper was returned to him, he didn’t write anything more to Dean Winchester.
Castiel sighed noticing the look on Dean’s face. He knew Dean wished his brother would take this seriously, but the thing is, this was the way Gabriel dealt with everything – jokes.
Though, what made it hard was that Dean still tried to talk to him, he would make friendly remarks and talk to him during lunch times and it bothered him, because all he wanted to do was distance himself away from Dean. But Dean just wanted to stay in Castiel’s life.
Dean stood up and walked towards Castiel, holding out a hand to help him up from his seat. Castiel could feel his face burning with embarrassment as he latched onto Dean’s hand and let himself be pulled out of his seat and directed toward the bathroom.
“People don’t do good things to go to Heaven, Mr Winchester,” the teacher said. Castiel felt that if this were a cartoon, steam would be pouring from her ears; her face would be read and puffed out, a human kettle.
?’ right?” she asked, signing the words as she said them. Castiel nodded making Mary smile, “I am good,” she said, signing along as she said the words again, “thank you.”
Michael nodded and followed, “I think I would give her a four,” Michael muttered, “but then again she may surprise me.”
There was a certain amount of friendly warmth he felt in his home that he had never felt in his own – a feeling of actually being a part of a family. He could smell what appeared to be pancakes, something his mother had never cooked him or his brothers – the sugar wasn’t good for them and she couldn’t deal with either hyper or overweight children. He’d had pancakes before – Michael had cooked them once when their mother wasn’t home. He didn’t know whether it was funny or sad that Michael cooking and helping them eat through a gigantic stack of pancakes was one of their few moments of teenager and childhood rebellion.
Later on they picked out a movie; separate bowls of popcorn going around the room, Castiel shared his with Dean who was too engrossed in the movie to really eat all that much of it, so it may as well have been Castiel just eating it all by himself.
Castiel looked down at the half empty plate of spaghetti, which had tasted horrible anyway – his mother’s cooking normally was – but it had been enough to fill his empty stomach. He signed sorry, but his mother sent him to his room for back-chatting. Castiel really wished his mother would learn sign language, hell; Dean had learned more sign language than her.
His mother had never really been a mother, well. She wasn’t born to be the perfect mother. She was mainly overly invested in her business; a publishing branch. Everything else was considered unimportant.
“You should go for a shower,” Mary said, “after you finish dinner. Dean will show you where the bathroom is and you can borrow some of his clothes; you look about the same size.”
When the class had finally settled and the teacher began to talk, Dean writing down everything on the board, Castiel noticed bruises on Dean’s knuckle. He got out his slip of paper again and quickly wrote out the question he was dying to ask and pushed it over to Dean’s desk.
He paused, turning to look at Castiel who was buttoning up the top button on his jeans, Dean sighed and shook his head regretfully, “I shouldn’t have said that. I’m sorry.”
I am amazed by the amount of activity with this fanfiction. It's getting so many hits each chapter and comments and it's amazing and makes me feel really happy because I originally felt this fanfiction was going to be crappy and horrible but you guys seem to love it, so, thank you!
“I can understand,” Castiel said somberly. “I hope this hasn’t changed your mind about me. Or about us.”
“Yes, Dean? What would you like?” Cas asked coyly, pretending not to understand. He wanted Dean like this for as long as possible, pliant and well-behaved. Open and willing. Taking in pleasure and receiving praise. He didn’t want this to end yet.
Cas kissed him sweetly on the lips and then the forehead, thrusting into him and cradling his head in his hands.
“So you said the opposite is true. What’s that? Tell me, oh wise angel of the Lord. I never even considered roleplaying “hot Sunday School teacher” like this with you, Cas.” Dean winked.
Cas leaned up over Dean’s body, between his legs, and opened Dean’s mouth with his own. Cas’ hands cradled Dean’s face, holding him still, while his tongue did what it wanted to. And Dean let him. He moaned into Cas’ mouth, loving the feeling of being taken so completely. Cas plundered and explored Dean’s mouth until Dean needed to come up for a breath. Cas pulled back, biting down on Dean’s lower lip. He sat up a bit, eyes fiery blue and staring straight into Dean’s soul.
“Cas,” Dean whispered, breathing heavily now and barely able to speak. The words punched out of him, and he began to moan. “Cas, is this the rapture?”
“I….. wow.”  Dean was obviously still speechless. And that was ok. Cas knew Dean, and knew that words were not his strong suit. Especially words about feelings. And love.
Dean groaned one last time, and then whimpered, his body shaking, and his arms and shoulders finally slumping, about to give. Cas quickly stood up and said “Lower your arms now, Dean,”, and caught Dean as he released them and fell forward into Cas’ arms. Cas helped him gently to the ground where he held him in his lap. Whomever coined orgasm as the “little death” had the right idea, thought Castiel to himself. Dean was a dead weight in his arms. He let him rest, listening to his heartbeat slow and his breathing calm. Dean burrowed his face into Cas’ neck, the skin warm and smelling  vaguely of cinnamon. Cas rubbed Dean’s back and ran his fingers through his hair. Dean’s back was sticky with blood, but Cas knew it would still be a little while until Dean would feel it. He had time. And sometimes Dean would let him heal him afterwards. Sometimes not, and the choice was always Dean’s. He reached over and grabbed Dean’s flannel shirt, discarded on the floor, and draped it over him. Cas could give him a few minutes to float before he would get too cold.
Dean’s cock was red and swollen and throbbing. Keeping his gaze on Dean’s face, Cas took his cock inside of himself. The heat from Cas’ mouth hit him hard and quick, and the feeling was indescribable. He wanted to hold on like Cas asked him to. He wanted to do this last assignment. He felt Cas’ sinfully satiny tongue wrapping around him, pulling him tighter into the heat of his mouth. Cas swallowed around him and Dean tilted his head back and groaned, trying not to thrust into Cas’ mouth. He could do this.
Dean’s breathing slowed a little bit, his brow smoothing out. His shoulders shuddered with the exertion, and he quieted. He opened his eyes. He knew Castiel wouldn’t give him more than he could take. The trust was complete.
Cas jumps up from the bed, stumbling crookedly, and runs for the bathroom. Dean can hear him retching through the open door.
Dean held his gaze, lust heavy in his eyes. He cocked his head to the side cheekily. “You wanting to get a little freaky with me, Cas? Some knife play perhaps?”
“No, you’re just another brave man with a big heart that I happen to love deeply. AND you’re incredibly beautiful.”
“Paul was obsessed with this idea that divine love was only a thing SOME people could have. He thought it would be best if people could somehow abstain from committing to each other or engaging in sexual relations, because, he said, those things distracted humans from God. So his only conception of love and ecstasy, or rapture, was to ACTUALLY fly up into the sky to be with God, AWAY from Earth altogether. As if God isn’t down here with us, in us. In everything. As if we have to ABANDON each other and our physical bodies to experience true love. Sad really, because the opposite is true.”
Dean looked down and cracked open his beer, taking a long drink and leaning back against the hood of the Impala. After a beat he looked over at the man in the trench coat standing next to him, noticing his silence. Castiel wasn’t looking up at the stars though. He was looking at Dean. Dean held his eyes for a moment, and then began to feel self-conscious and smiled softly, looking back down and taking another drink. Cas finally broke his gaze and also drank from his own bottle.
“You sound just like Paul, going all puritan on me, Dean. We’ve used rope before. Why so squeamish all of a sudden?”
“I say ‘stop’, Cas,” Dean replied, equally as clearly. They had decided to keep instructions as simple as possible… no need to reinvent the wheel. Cas nodded, and then stood back. Dean knew that whatever happened now would continue as Cas wanted it to, until or unless Dean said to stop. He inhaled a big breath of air and then exhaled softly, feeling his muscles relax. He loved the part where he could stop thinking. Where his responsibility ended and he could just float in the simplicity of doing as instructed. He had no need to feel nervous or self-conscious, because he wasn’t in charge of ANYTHING at this point. He had permission, he had space, he had GRACE, to just experience the feelings in his body. How could he possibly mess up if none of the decisions were his to make? His body melted against the post at the same time as it lit up with anticipation.
Dean’s whole body was flushed now, pink and golden and beautiful. He could no longer keep still and his muscles rippled under his skin like water.
“The hopes and fears,” he gasped out. “Of all the years.” He gasped again, clenching his eyes shut, feeling the rush coming, knowing he couldn’t stop it. “Are met in thee.” He gulped one more breath. “Tonight.”
Cas knew that Dean was losing his inhibitions if he was starting to verbalize. Like the eye contact, it didn’t come easy to him. Not with Cas, at least. Not with another man. Not while he was being touched like this. Cas bobbed his head a few times, letting Dean feel the soft, hot suction of his mouth.
Then without another word, he leaned down and licked into Dean’s hole. A groan punched out of Dean, it was so unexpected. He had never let himself be this vulnerable with anyone before. Cas’ tongue was relentless and firm, claiming him. He licked over his hole unceasingly, giving no pause for Dean to catch his breath. He speared him open on his tongue, fucking into him with it. Dean could feel tears on his cheeks, and he didn’t even care. He began to fly.
Finally, Cas stilled. He kept Dean’s cock in his mouth, gently and lovingly, just sucking tenderly but not wanting to tip him over the edge. Closing his eyes, Cas summoned up his grace, placing a finger softly against Dean’s hole, just dipping the tip inside Dean’s body. He concentrated his grace, just a bit, into his lover, sending it to thrum up against all the walls inside of Dean, the walls of his body and the walls he had built up inside of his head. Dean gasped and jerked, feeling the new sensation curling like tendrils of a vine inside of him.
Dean leaves Cas his shirt and underwear, stripping off the tie, and gently moves him around to tuck him in properly, thinking back on the times he did this for Sam when they were young. His dad was never one for sitting with Sam when he was puking or feverish, so Dean had done it, like Dean had done so many things.
“How interesting,” Cas said nonchalantly. “A barn, out in the middle of nowhere, beneath the Christmas Star, on Solstice night. And here WE are.” He spread his arms out wide, as if to encompass the large coincidence of it all.
Dean smirked, his eyes twinkling, and he nodded.  Then he began trying to think of a song. Castiel, that kinky fucker. Christmas star, indeed.
But Dean trusted him. He opened his eyes. Deep green met bright blue. Dean could be brave. He could keep his eyes open. For a little while, at least. Cas took it for the gift that it was. He petted his hands up the inside of Dean’s thighs, lightly brushing one hand over Dean’s cock, caressing him. Dean kept his eyes open. Cas ghosted his hand down over Dean’s balls, continuing down to rub his knuckles against the skin right behind them. Dean’s breath hitched. But he kept his eyes open. Cas continued lightly, maddeningly, caressing him. Dean’s chest was heaving now, the muscles in his arms bunched together under his skin, his whole body rippling in tension.
“Dean!” says Cas, suddenly dipping his head directly over the trash can. “Do NOT say the word pastrami!”
Dean stood finally, glancing over at the figures of Mary and Joseph sitting among the fluffs of cotton in the display.
“Well I didn’t really think it needed to be said, Dean. I DID live in heaven for a long time. Though I actually met Jesus during his time here on Earth as a young man. He was a dear friend to many. And a very giving lover.”
“I’m disgusting, Dean. You don’t have to do that. My mouth tastes like…. “ Unable to think of a worthy comparison, he merely finishes with “vomit”.
They ALMOST got all of their Christmas shopping done before the first flakes fell. ALMOST.  Dean groaned when he saw the fat flakes sifting down to the sidewalk through the department store windows.
"Dean," she complained, folding way too easily for Dean to feel victorious about it. "You creep. What're you two even doing back here? You know my mom's just gonna come over and ask about your feelings, right?"
times. In, I should point out, a purely friendzoned context, but please, between the lines? It reads like a bona fide '50 Shades of Safe-Wording' novel."
Dean plants his palms on the carpet and pushes off the floor, scooting instead to the couch. He can feel his temper flaring, but there's other stuff rolling around in it too.
"Palm it," Charlie demands, with her right hand held high, and who is he to deny a lady? The slap of their ensuing high five rings out loud and mighty.
Cas looks like Dean's leading to a punchline he already knows he won't get, like it's some big joke at his expense. His eyes narrow.
Dean gets hard so fast he feels queasy more than aroused, at least until Cas lifts a hand and runs it through his hair.
Charm comes natural to him, and he uses it now like it's going out of style later. "I don't know. Charlie, is it? See, me and my buddy here were just driving through, figured we'd stop, grab ourselves a bite. What do they drink in Beresford?"
"Yeah, sucks without angel-vision, don't it?" As soon as he says it, Dean wants to un-say it. Cas shrinks away from Dean so instead of being a solid line against him, there's at least three inches of space between them. Cas clams up when it comes to the topic of his lost celestiality. Dean knows that, which pretty much makes him the world's biggest dick for joking around about it.
"Look," Sam says when he comes out of it. He has something in his tone that sets off an immediate bad feeling, which is only solidified when the music cuts from a ballad to something sung by one of those chicks with a dollar sign for a name. Sure enough, Sam hushes his voice. "I get that you and Lisa are having a weird time right now--"
He honest-to-god blushes and says, "Oh," like this is the first time it's crossed his mind they might bad-touch each other again.
Room 201 is also a honeymoon suite, which explains the front desk girl's personality transplant at the end there, but Dean doesn't even care. Joke's on her, now Dean has a microwave.
He looks over at Cas, the sun high in the sky, windows rolled down, both of them content as hell right now, and turns some Led Zeppelin up on the radio.
When he wraps his fingers around it, Cas' fingers chase right after his, wrapping around them too like there ain't a chance in hell he's letting Dean let go. That... is way hotter than it has a right to be. Dean's own dick throbs in response, and in protest of being trapped behind jeans.
It's like she's related to Sam, for fuck's sake. Like the two of them know exactly which buttons to press to send him from zero to done. "Are you gonna help or not?"
The woman opens the door only a little, peeking through the sliver like she's expecting the in-laws or solicitors or something. Dean recognizes her from the picture, and he thinks, briefly, that she's a lot prettier in person than print. When she sees Sam, who is practically oozing of sympathy, recognition hits and she opens up all the way.
Cas swipes his eyes and gets a hold of himself. He straightens back up and moves to collect a couple of blue ribbons off a tack board near the desk by his bed. "I need to pack."
"Yeah, you know what I realized today? I'm not the little brother anymore," Sam brags, like that has anything to do with, you know, anything. "Technically."
Dean's hands tighten around the steering wheel. He can feel the car lurching forward as he gasses it again, only it's unintentional this time.
Sam was in the hospital and the TV perched in the corner of his room was still blurting news alerts of unidentified objects falling from the sky when Dean got that initial phone call. Cas was tricked. Naomi was right, Metatron did a spell, yadda yadda.
Cas, who's amused and ain't even bothering to hide it, gets pointed at as well. "You too," Dean says.
It takes another second, but then Dean gets a hold of himself. He works his arms into his jacket and grabs his keys, then looks around like he's forgetting something.
"It's gone already, if you're worried," and that is Cas talking about his erection. It's fine. They're adults. This doesn't have to be creepy. "It went away on its own, without a--massage," Cas assures him and, nope, nevermind. They're not doing this.
Cas comes in spurts that hit Dean in the chest, his neck, one on his chin when Cas' hips jerk forward, and Dean opens his mouth -- not to catch any (though,
Dean scoffs and stuffs his partially eaten hamburger in front of his face. He chews off a mayo-heavy bite, a glob of it winding up back on his plate, and asks, "Why not?"
"Thanks, man," Sam says, taking his first sip. There is a twinkle in his eyes as his gaze skips from Dean to Cas, back to Dean again, and Dean responds with a glare that demands Sam cool it down while also managing to threaten bodily harm.
Sam's a much more civilized person than he is; instead of calling him out, he tries to stifle as much of his enjoyment as possible, only seeming pleased that Dean's playing so well with others.
Far from placating him, it only serves to dig the hole deeper. "Dean has a habit of presuming to know anything about me or what I might want," Cas bites out, clearly beyond done, and Dean's right there with him.
"Okay," she tells Cas, tells them both. She breathes out, not quite calm, not exactly convinced it's the right choice either, but. Close enough. "Alright, Castiel."
“You realize I'm a multidimensional messenger of God? I don’t have a gender, so whatever hang-ups you have, I assure you are unnecessary.”
He's tempted to take it there now. That's probably his midlife crisis talking, but, swear to god, Cas wanted to go there? He'd legitimately consider it himself. Hell, he's half-hard just thinking about it and all Cas has done is implied he's still got the hots for him. Which is a brand new type of fucked up, even for Dean.
Sitting down across from him at the rickety lone table in the room, Sam takes his time forming his words. "And if you can't?"
Jesus, his life. Why does he care? Sam can think what he wants. Sam's letting his hair grow out because he thinks it looks good, so clearly he's already wired with a heaping dose of wrong opinions.
"Goody for cats. Second guy fits the same bill. Loner-type. No friends. Next door neighbor finds him because the house starts to smell like dead-guy. But the third one. I don't know."
Cas doesn't say anything, just gives him a stony look back. After a second, Dean realizes that's all he's gonna get out of him.
"Sit," Cas tells him. "Eat." He starts pulling out a pair of plates, some silverware. It's all very creepy.
Only, Naomi's face goes soft. Dean's braced for an argument, hell, him and Cas both are, they're literally standing together like they're expecting to be physically pried apart, but that's not what happens. Understanding dawns on Naomi. This, she seems to concede, is a battle already lost.
Distantly he hears the telltale thunk-thunk-thunk-thunk of someone rushing up the stairs, but it takes his bedroom door bursting open for things to register. Awareness hits pretty damn fast after that.
"What?" Dean defends while plunking a couple of extra-salty fries off of his plate and onto Sam's, which currently has nothing on it but green stuff. Rabbit food. God. It earns him a second glare and a woe-poor-looked-after me sigh, but Dean's thoughtfulness goes otherwise ignored.
"Please? I need this! I need to booze freely and flirt with girls. You're my wingman. I need my wingman."
"Probably don't want to let that dry," he tells Cas. Nothing worse than dried out bodily fluids, that's for damn sure.
Dean must read the hope in his eyes, because he grabs his duffel from the floor and pulls out extra of his own. They're given to Cas, and during the exchange, he's told, "While you do that, I'm gonna head back into town and grab our food. That okay?"
"Not like that," Dean insists, and Sam smiles a smile that says 'yeah, maybe not, but you wish' and Cas is staring at Dean like he went around the wrong conversational bend. Dean becomes suddenly aware he's holding one of Cas' socks, and Sam notices at the same time. "Shut up," he defends himself with.
Once Sam shows up, Dean plays it cool. The last thing he wants is for his brother to sniff out his bad mood and start pointing out logic flaws in his plan.
Dean snorts again, embarrassed for no good reason, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. He finds the lighter he'd placed near their stash and gives it an experimental swipe. A small flame erupts, making everything glow suddenly. Sam notices the yellow, orange-ish flicker and hollers his excitement, which makes Dean chuckle before he extinguishes it.
“I brought you here on this magical night, much like the night in the barn when we first met, so I could make you be still. So I could show you how much you mean to me. How much you’ve given me. How much I love you. How worthy you are of love and good things.” It was that last part that had Dean shaking and lowering his arms. Cas wasn’t surprised. He knew that Dean did not see himself as worthy of worship, and that it was the last part of his “speech” that Dean would have the hardest time with.  His commander of angels voice rang out like a gunshot, both quiet and solid at the same time.
Castiel smiled and nodded. “Of course it’s not really a star. It’s a confluence of planets, Jupiter and Saturn.”
“I have found that restraining you, which we started just as “kinky fun” as you put it, helps you to relax. Helps you to just feel what is happening. You worry less about where your hands should go or what you’re supposed to do or how your body is responding. Is that correct?”
“Good boy,” Cas said softly. Dean bit down softly, rapturously, and Cas bit his own lip in response before pulling his thumb from Dean’s mouth.
Dean immediately did as he was told. The piece of rebar wasn’t so far above his head that it was immediately uncomfortable. He had a little give to work with. But it was high enough that his arms stretched all the way up, stretching his shoulders, chest, and stomach beautifully against the post. Dean closed his eyes, and Castiel let him, licking his lips at the sight of his beloved in front of him. He began.
Cas rumbled deep in his throat, his tongue sweeping over Dean’s skin and his lips pulling and sucking. Dean thrust into him and Cas took him down into his throat. Dean would probably stop and wonder at that if he was capable of coherent thought right now. Cas reached up and slipped his fingers between Dean’s ass cheeks, running a finger lightly over his hole, over and over. Dean knew he was close.
Dean stops in front of Cas’ door, wondering if he should intrude or leave the man in peace.  His concern for the newly human angel wins out, and he taps lightly.
“You just gonna leave me hanging here, Cas? After that whole damn oration you gave outside? Help me out a little here, man.” He felt his cheeks flush.
“Well, sometimes,” Dean answers, grabbing a washcloth from under the sink and running it under cool water. “I’ve had my share of worshipping at the feet of the almighty toilet bowl.”
Cas walked over and lightly put his hand on Dean’s arm, letting him know he was there. Dean let his arms down and turned around, looking up into the eyes of his angel. Castiel could see some of the fatigue in his eyes from the beating, but he could also see the endorphins zinging along under his skin. He could see the relief in his shoulders and his chest. He could see the lightness in him.
“You could have stopped me at any time, Dean,” Cas said, and promptly pulled Dean close and kissed him. People continued to pass them on either side as they blocked the sidewalk with their bodies. Dean felt Cas’ lips curve up into a smile.
They had finally come to the car, and Castiel stopped, realizing he had gotten caught up in the telling of the story. Dean cleared his throat, feeling the heat in his face.
Cas broke their kiss to let Dean breathe. He thought that even their combined breath was puffing out blue, but maybe he was just seeing blue all around them now. He couldn’t tell and he didn’t really care. They were lost to each other and whatever it was between them. Inside of them. It steadily built up within them, like the low beat of a drum as one approaches. The pulse of the grace and the pulse of their heartbeats grew louder in his ears. He thrust harder, giving in to his growing desire to do so. Dean started breathing more quickly, pulling against the rope, pulling against Cas, asking to be pushed over with his body.
“So,” Dean said, straightening up, his shoulders more relaxed. They were almost to the parking garage. “Who kissed who first?”
“There’s not…. there’s not a baby in that barn, is there? There’s not sheep and a manger and a donkey and shit? Is there?”
Cas nodded. “Ok, then. When you are ready, turn around and grab the spike above you with your hands.” Cas said it quietly, gently. He knew Dean wanted to succeed, and he wanted Dean to have that too. His hunter was so stubborn and relentless. He never gave up. Cas knew he never would.
“No, I didn’t bring you here tonight so we could have a knife fight. And this dirt floor doesn’t look all that appetizing either. Straw is so abrasive and scratchy.”
For once, in the face of a declaration of love, Dean kept his eyes open and didn’t tell Cas to stop. He was ok. This was ok. This was more than ok.
Cas licked up, sucking each ball into his mouth gently, moving up and suckling at the head of Dean’s cock, before finally taking all of it into his mouth, until Cas’ lips were buried in Dean’s hair. He swallowed around Dean’s length, and Dean’s hips bucked up involuntarily, the ropes holding him securely so that Dean was safe to feel everything. The buzzing pressure mounted deep in his belly. His legs were shaking badly now, and Cas gently pushed Dean’s feet back down onto the bed, all the while sucking Dean down into his mouth, hot and slick and tight.
The crooning did indeed commence as they exited the store and began the walk to the car, bags in hand.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas said, the words said low but with reverence, “Don’t you know? This is a night of miracles. This confluence of heavenly bodies, the Christmas star, appearing on the night of the Solstice, the longest night of the year….. For millennia people have celebrated the return of light on this night. The return of the fertility of the soil. The PROMISE of the return of food and warmth, and…… life. The return of HOPE, Dean.” Dean felt the stroke of Cas’s thumb on his cheek, the other four fingers still holding his chin authoritatively. He started to close his eyes, but Cas shook his chin ever so slightly, letting him know that this was not allowed. Dean opened them again, green staring into blue. “The hope brought by the birth of a tiny baby that would grow to be a man, a righteous man, who liberates his people from oppression. A humble man, a carpenter, born to poor people who have to take refuge in a barn because there is no room for them anywhere else. A man born to this Earth to teach that life is HARD, yes, but you can still be GOOD, to one another, and especially to the most vulnerable among us. That you can still be BRAVE, and do what is right, even though you face death for it.”
Cas laid two fingers against Dean’s forehead and healed his wounds. Dean hummed at the odd sensation of his skin knitting back together so quickly. Cas then helped Dean finish dressing, and they held hands as they exited the barn. The air was bitingly cold after the warmth of the barn and their shared heat. Dean looked up into the sky, and felt dizzy for a minute, grabbing at Cas’ arm to steady himself. He didn’t look down though. The stars were beautiful. They took his breath away. He watched for a moment, and then tilted his head back down, catching Cas gazing at him softly.
And then he let out the roar trapped in his throat, groaning loudly and thrusting one final time DOWN Castiel’s throat and spilling spilling spilling, feeling wave after wave wash over him as he finally came.  It felt like forever. And Cas took it all, keeping Dean in his mouth as Dean lost control and speared into him roughly, feeling his balls slap against Cas’ face, Cas who was still gentle enough to keep his teeth tucked away, to receive whatever Dean had to give him.
Cas hummed, continuing to suck gently on Dean’s cock, sending his grace inside of Dean, rubbing his other hand comfortingly along Dean’s thigh and up onto his stomach, calming him. Helping him to relax and accept the sensation.
Cas moaned beneath him, relishing the words and the feel of the skin on his tongue. Dean held on to the spike above him harder, feeling that feeling deep in his gut, knowing it was coming. He wanted it so bad.
Their breath made puffs of smoke in the air. The air was cold and quiet and heavy in that way that winter air is. They had parked off of a gravel road curving into a field. The black spears of a rail fence in shadow stood out against the horizon. There was no breeze, which was good  because it would have made the cold air intolerable. Though the temps were below freezing, they were mostly comfortable standing in their layers of flannel and coats, letting the alcohol warm their insides as well. The stars glittered sharp and brilliant against the black of the sky. Dean felt a little high, though he doubted he had consumed enough beers for that to be the reason. There was an electric something he felt buzzing just under the surface, between the breathless air, and the bright expanse of stars jeweled by the one giant shining star, and the rail fence, and the looming darkness of the trees nearby. Everything stood out in stark relief, as if cut from glass. He noticed a barn in the distance and smirked briefly, remembering.
Dean huffed out a squawk of bewildered laughter and bent over, holding himself up with his hands on his knees.
“There ya go, Sunshine,” Dean whispers, finally getting Cas in position and the blankets tucked properly around him. “Do you want some 7Up or something?”
Cas leaned in kissed him deeply, opening his mouth right away and taking in Dean’s tongue. One of his hands slipped down to Dean’s throat, holding him forcefully in the way he knew that Dean liked. In the way that made Dean feel desired. Dean melted under the touch, moaning softly. Cas fingered his throat gently with his thumb, before tightening his grip again, careful to do it just right. Just hard enough, just long enough, in just the right spot. Dean’s cock twitched against Castiel.
“And…” Cas suddenly jumped up onto the bed, crawling up Dean’s body to straddle his hips. “I want to make you FLY, Dean.”  Holy shit. Dean gulped. He was so thoroughly fucked.
“It was Thomas who doubted Jesus,” Cas said quietly. “After Jesus was put to the cross, and then rose again. Thomas didn’t have enough faith. He had to actually touch Jesus to be sure it was him. The palms of Jesus’ hands, and then here at his side, where they had pierced the savior with a spear. Thomas had to put his fingers inside of Jesus to believe.” Cas looked up into Dean’s face. “Or so they say.”
Cas leaned down and nuzzled into Dean, rubbing his cheek against the silken skin of Dean’s cock, enjoying the soft slide of it, knowing that his stubble would burn in just the right way. He loved the feel of the hardness of Dean, strong and throbbing, encased in the silky smooth skin that was just starting to slick up.
Cas stood in front of him, looking him up and down. Dean loved this part, when Cas obviously had a whole plan probably marked through and collated and highlighted in his brain, and was just letting Dean stew for a minute, knowing how sweet and exquisitely painful the anticipation was.
“You are beautiful, Dean. Glorious. You bring me so much happiness.” Dean panted and groaned above him, beginning to feel that exquisite pain of wanting and not getting. Cas rolled his balls in his hand gently.  “You are kind, and strong, and brave, and smart,” he continued, unhurried. “You are divine. And delicious.” And with that Castiel swallowed Dean down, taking his cock all the way into his mouth until he could feel it at the back of his throat. He moaned, letting Dean feel the vibrations in his throat. Dean tipped his head back and practically yelled, his hands shaking to hold onto the metal above his head. Cas pulled off and licked one long stripe up the underside of Dean’s cock, savoring the feel and taste along his tongue. He swallowed him again, taking his time and licking along the length of him. He caressed the insides of his thighs with his hands, moving up slowly to touch his balls, his ass cheeks, and finally back behind his balls and his hole. He petted him thoroughly and lovingly, all the while his tongue and lips keeping pace on his cock.
“It means I only do what I am enthusiastic about doing, and I don’t do anything I don’t want to do. It means I use my words, or other agreed upon means of communication. It means that either of us can change our minds or say stop whenever we want to.”
“All of these labels and restrictions don’t come from God. I’ve told you that. He created people to be happy and love each other, no matter what that looks like. Jesus wasn’t a word, really. He was just… Jesus. I guess if you HAD to label him, he would have been called ‘pansexual’.” Castiel made finger quotes in the air.  “He loved many people. And had many different lovers.”
“Jesus was a man, but I was still in awe of him. The grace he had for people…. it was overwhelming. We were friends, but he kissed me first.”
“Do you want help following my instructions, Dean?” Cas asked, as he had the times before when this happened.
“Are you paying attention now, Dean Winchester?” Cas said almost menacingly, openly smirking. Dean’s eyes grew into saucers, feeling suddenly like prey caught in a spider’s web. But he kept his eyes open and his legs up, though his legs were starting to shake at this point. He nodded.
“Well not like Paul described it. There IS rapture to be sure, but Paul was very confused about the whole thing.”
Cas pulled away from the kiss, his hand reaching up to Dean’s face, turning his head to the side roughly. He held his face lovingly but firmly, and dipped a finger into Dean’s mouth. Dean sucked it in eagerly, feeling the luscious sensation of fullness it provided. Holding Dean’s head firmly to the side, knowing Dean liked to be manhandled when in this state of subspace, Cas licked down his throat, nipping and biting as he went. He tasted the salt of Dean’s sweat on his chest, and then grazed over his nipples with his teeth, settling to lick and bite at one, and then the other. Dean suckled harder at his fingers, moaning in contentment. Cas turned his teeth and tongue to the other nipple, letting the fingers of his free hand pinch and play at the other, continuing relentlessly until Dean started bucking against him, trying to get friction against his cock. He was losing control again. Cas lapped harder at his nipple, sucking and biting, his fingers rolling and pinching the other, until he thought Dean might come just from that. Then he finally pulled away, his free hand rubbing Dean’s flushed chest down gently. Dean settled a bit, still sucking at Cas’ finger and whimpering quietly.
“Yet in thy dark streets shineth,” Dean continued. He stopped and groaned, panting hard. His heart raced and his blood burned. He started thrusting into Cas’ mouth. He couldn’t help it. Cas didn’t seem to mind. He just continued at his constant pace, slick and fast, taking Dean in as far as Dean wanted to go. “The everlasting light.” Dean finally finished the line.
Dean pulled back a little bit, to look Cas in the face again. His eyes were just so blue, and his skin crinkled a bit at the sides, as he thought of the amusing apostle Paul and his wacky ideas. Dean wanted to smoosh his face against that face, but he waited patiently for Cas to finish talking.
“Please keep count for as long as you can, Dean,” Cas said, again softly and gently. Dean nodded his head. He set his feet apart and rolled his shoulders.
“His loss,” Dean whispered. He reached down and squeezed Cas gently through his slacks, and then reached around and unlocked the door.
“Ok then. Whadya say we get you out of this coat and your pants and you can crawl under the covers?”
“Dean, we’ve talked about this. All these hangups about sex and bodies and nudity are completely man-made. God created people to live and be happy. He certainly doesn’t care how people show affection for one another.”
“You’re doing so well, my love. You can do it.” He reached out with his wet, pink tongue and sucked at the head of Dean’s cock. Dean bucked into him. “What’s the next line, Dean?” Cas asked quietly and calmly, as if this was just your average weeknight in front of the tv. Dean knew him well enough to hear the strain underneath his voice though. He knew Cas was hard and ready to go too. Dean closed his eyes and concentrated, and Cas closed his mouth around him again, jacking him more roughly now.
“Are you ok?” Dean asked finally, after he had mostly caught his breath. Cas’ heart broke in affection for this sweet man, a regular human asking if an angel of the Lord was ok, right after he had gotten his mortal world rocked, literally.
“You know I will,” Cas answered darkly. Dean shivered deliciously. He felt his cock twitching in his jeans in anticipation. He hoped he had the right idea.
Cas chuckled softly. “You can say it or sing it any way you like, Dean. You just have to hold on through one verse.”
“Can you still feel this, Dean? Feel my hands here?” he asked, making sure Dean wasn’t losing sensation.
Castiel looked at him fully in the face and held the look for a moment, breathlessly. He cocked an eyebrow up at Dean. Dean felt heat suddenly bubble up, low in his belly. Oh shit. He knew that look. Something was about to happen.
Cas began to pull back onto the road. “You, Dean Winchester? Unable to control your roaming hands???? Why I’ve never heard of such a thing!”
The next post over also sported a piece of rebar, probably used to hang something on he thought, but it was much higher, above his head even. Cas saw him looking.
“Is this what humans do? Human friends, that is?” Cas asks in a whisper. Dean can tell he is close to falling asleep.
Serious songs. Dean didn’t want to recite anything he remembered his mom singing at Christmas cuz gross, though luckily he didn’t really remember her singing many songs at Christmas in the short time they had had together, so that was a win. A few silly ones came to mind quickly, but he believed Cas when he said he would spank him, and though that was sometimes fun, it would NOT be fun tonight, so he kept to his instructions. What SERIOUS Christmas songs did he know????? His shoulders ached from the constant stretch of his arms, and his cock felt like it was going to go off like a volcano if he didn’t come soon. He needed to do this.
His hands continued below Dean’s hips, fluttering lightly over his cock but not stopping there, not yet. He caressed the insides of Dean’s thighs, running his fingers over his knees and down to his feet. Every scar, every mark, Castiel loved. He wished for a moment that he had warm water and perfume with which to wash Dean’s feet just as Jesus had, but filed that away for another time.
“My loss,” Cas sighs, bantering back. “Though I’m just a plain ol’ human now. Worshipping a toilet.”
“It’s ok. It just sometimes takes a little adjustment still…. my boyfriend being an angel and all that.”
Cas ran his hands over Dean’s body reverently, as if Dean were a cherished thing. He ran his hands over the slopes of Dean’s face, petting down his cheeks. He leaned in and kissed Dean’s eyelids, his forehead, his mouth again. His hands wandered over Dean’s shoulders and he smoothed the backs of his hands up along the exposed undersides of Dean’s arms. He rubbed his hands lightly over Dean’s chest, relishing the silky slide of his skin there. He fingered his nipples a bit before slipping farther down to caress his stomach and his hips. Dean moaned in pleasure. It was an unrestrained sound, and Castiel felt pleasure upon hearing it. This was what he wanted for Dean.
“Some people believe it WILL happen. They believe that Jesus will one day return to Earth, and that the “true” (Cas OF COURSE did the finger quotes) Christians will magically rise up into the air, to meet Jesus in the sky. Or so says Paul in his letter to the Thessalonians. At least in one translation of that letter.”
Dean’s eyes widened into saucers. He almost broke out of the scene in his astonishment. Almost. But he was too good of a sub, too good of a boy, to do that. He swallowed the expletives that bubbled up to his lips, and nodded obediently.
Dean laughed outright at that. Castiel chuckled with him. They both drank some more and relaxed against the car.
“I want you to recite a hymn. Or a Christmas carol. You have to say at least one verse. Once you finish, you can come.”
“Yeah I guess you got me there, Cas. You and I have been resurrected more than a few times now. Who am I to judge freaking zombies flying up into the sky to meet the son of God? Maybe Paul was right.”
“Come on,” Cas said, gently but firmly helping Dean to his feet. “Let’s get you dressed before it gets too cold in here. Now that our ‘amorous fervor’ has worn off.” Dean huffed a laugh out at that. He could practically hear the finger quotes in Cas’ voice. Cas smiled back. Dean was still shaky on his feet, so Cas supported him while Dean climbed into his jeans and put on his boots.
“That’s just the point. Angels ARE dangerous. But Jesus was different. He had all the divine love from God, AND he was also human. He was a carpenter. He understood what it was like to BE human. To feel pain. To suffer. To be sad. To be in love. To be scared. To be excited. People think the special thing about Jesus was that he was this perfect person or pure person or that he was a virgin. Why would God invent sex for people if he didn’t want them to do it? Why would God create love that can be shared between people of the same gender if he didn’t want them to experience that? It makes no sense. Jesus was special because he was a human being, and because he was filled with love for EVERYONE. He was one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.”
“Look who’s talking!” Cas exclaimed. “I had to read up for a solid week to figure out what you wanted me to do!”
“Just what kind of miracle are we walking into here, Cas?” Dean asked, feeling both excited and apprehensive.
“Take off your clothes, Dean,” Cas said quietly. Dean’s eyes flicked to the open barn door. Cas quickly raised his hand and the door closed, as if it were nothing. Dean began untying his shoes.
“And it was Judas who kissed him,” Castiel continued, his voice quiet but strong. “In the garden of Gethsemane. “ And Castiel leaned forward and kissed Dean on the mouth, gently and sweetly, leaving his lips there for a moment, and then darting his tongue out to taste him. Dean moaned and opened his mouth, letting him in. They kissed languidly for a while, Dean letting Cas lead, content to feel the push and pull of the angel’s tongue, his angel taking him as he pleased. After a few minutes, Cas pulled back and opened his eyes, waiting for Dean to open his. Keeping the direct eye contact, just inches apart, Cas said loudly and clearly, “You are so beautiful.” Dean did not flinch. He held on to the metal above him, and listened to Castiel.
Dean swallowed. He had no words. He felt a tear run down one cheek, and let it fall. It pooled against Castiel’s fingers.
“The things you do for love.” His blue eyes sparkled in the starlight, and Dean squeezed his hand affectionately at his words.
Castiel squared his shoulders, his eyes darkening, and his voice rang out authoritatively. “Grasp the bar above you with your hands, Dean, and do not let go until I tell you.”
“Actually I believe YOU were the first one to mention a baby, Dean. And farm animals.” He clucked his tongue teasingly.
“Come on, Dean. You’re being a ‘grinch’.” Cas gestured finger quotes in the air. “It JUST started. And anyway, it’s pretty,” he said.
“Yeah, well…” Dean shrugged. After a pause, he continued. “So, speaking of….  How…. How was he? It? I mean, the sex. With Jesus.”
“You,” Cas said pointedly, looking at Dean, “are a very good boy.” Dean moaned, enjoying the pressure of Cas’ hand holding him still.
“Well,” Cas answered after a pause. “I just hope there’s room, you now. At the inn. For the two of us. I don’t want to have to stay in a barn or something.”
“Yeah. Some people believe you even leave your clothes behind when you’re raptured. Others believe you leave your whole body behind.”
“It IS a nice body,” Cas answered. “I should know.” He languidly unbuttoned the top button of Dean’s shirt, tracing just one finger under the fabric. Dean shivered at the sensation.
“Sit still,” Dean admonishes. Cas quiets and Dean finishes wiping his face, as if he were wiping the face of a child. Cas waits patiently.
The words came out in a whisper at first, through panted breaths. He gripped the bar above him so tightly his fingers turned white. His legs shook beneath him. Cas wasn’t holding anything back now. He bobbed up and down over Dean’s length incessantly.
Dean had no idea what Cas was leading up to, but he dutifully looked down the two rows of posts spanning up to the ceiling on either side of them. He glanced back at the post directly behind him. A large spiky piece of rebar jutted out from it at chest height.
Finally, he stood in front of his angel without a stitch of clothes on him. He blushed a bit, unable to help it. Cas smiled softly at him, his eyes full of love. The lust had burned back to coals for a moment. A pause.
They had been lying in bed and listening to Zeppelin, but then the playlist switched up and Debbie Harry’s raspy voice filtered through. Dean’s head was propped up on his pillow, and Cas rested his chin on top of Dean’s shoulder, eyes softly closed and arm wrapped around Dean’s chest. It was late at night and they should probably snuggle on down under the sheets properly, but the music was so mellow and the mood so chill that they lingered awake. Dean’s skin gleamed golden under the light of the bedside lamp. Cas’ thumb stroked against it languidly.
Cas ground his hips down onto Dean’s, and Dean groaned without intending to. He couldn’t help it. Cas licked his lips, and then gently took both of Dean’s hands, guiding his arms up above his head. Cas’ chest hovered above Dean’s face as Cas began tying Dean’s wrists together and then to the headboard, but Cas kept his body just out of reach of Dean’s mouth. Dean sighed, both delighted and frustrated. Cas smiled, knowing full well what he was doing. He rolled his hips as he tied the rope, giving them both just enough friction to tease at more. Dean raised his head to try and get at Cas, and then dropped it back again impatiently. Cas cinched the rope tight and Dean groaned, relishing the burn. “Oh hell yeah,” Dean whispered.
“Would you look at that sky? It’s been a while since we’ve been out past the city lights. That case in Detroit lasted longer than I thought it would. I missed the stars.”
“Paul was wrong,” Cas continued calmly, as if nothing had happened. “We don’t need to shed our bodies to experience rapture. We only need to shed our fears and our anxieties. Our earthly inhibitions. We only need to love ourselves enough to let us BE ourselves. To allow ourselves to ask for what we want. To let ourselves be loved for who we are. Say yes if you understand, Dean.”
“Shhhhh….” Cas whispered, placing his finger against Dean’s mouth. He left it there, waiting until Dean opened up to him. Cas slipped his finger inside, resting it solidly against Dean’s tongue in that way that he knew Dean liked. Dean closed his eyes and his lips, suckling at Cas’ fingertip. Dean sighed in pleasure and his hips began to undulate beneath Cas’ body. Cas wasn’t sure that Dean was even aware he was doing that. He could tell that Dean was starting to slip under, into that space that let his brain be quiet and let him be free. The place where Cas could show him what rapture was really like. Dean’s shoulders raised up off of the bed and he pulled against the rope, feeling that he was held now. Secure. He didn’t have to decide if this was ok or not any longer. He could just submit. He could just float. Cas smiled down at his love adoringly, feeling a bursting sensation in his heart at the sight of the blissed out expression on Dean’s face. This was HIS ecstasy, giving this to Dean. He continued to stroke Dean’s tongue with one finger, and curled his thumb under Dean’s chin, moving his face to the side. He could feel Dean’s cock hardening in response to the manhandling of his face and his body. He leaned down and licked a stripe up Dean’s neck, biting softly at the vein that throbbed just beneath the skin. He shimmied back down Dean’s body, licking and biting down his neck and chest, lifting Dean’s chin up roughly with his thumb to expose more skin. The suction in Dean’s mouth was delicious. Castiel shivered, biting at the taut expanse of Dean’s sides and ribs. Cas licked teasingly at a nipple, just barely wetting it, and Dean lifted up as far as he could to chase the sensation. Cas sucked the nipple into his mouth, biting softly and insistently. Dean bent his knees up into the air, trapping Cas solidly between his thighs. They were both rutting against each other now, all heat and rubbing cloth and slick skin. Cas teased at the other nipple, sucking at it tenderly. Dean moaned and bit down softly at the finger in his mouth.
The barn was dry and warm, and glimmered with a faint golden light. The corners and the loft were folded in darkness, but Dean had no sense of danger. The barn was empty and smelled faintly of earth and leather. The ground was covered with dirt and straw. They stopped in the middle of the barn.
Dean nodded again. Castiel beamed, feeling that high he got when he was successful in bringing pleasure to his lover… when he was successful in getting his lover to receive both love and gratification. He felt the rush of accomplishment run through him, and his eyes dilated in his own arousal and ecstasy. This was HIS high.
They arrived at the barn doors, breathless. Well, Dean was breathless. Castiel was calm, though Dean could feel that vibrational thrumming in his hand that Dean was feeling on his skin, like the air before a lightning strike.
They lay quietly for a minute, feeling the heat between them begin to cool, listening to their own breathing and the gradual slowing of their heartbeats.
“What, that you had sex with Jesus? No, not at all. It’s actually a huge compliment. I’m in good company, ya know?”
Their hearts lay close against each other, both slower and steadier now. Dean stirred, nuzzling deeper into the space between Cas’ throat and his shoulder. He breathed in Cas’ smell, obviously relishing it, and then reached out his tongue and licked his skin there, tasting the salty sweetness of it. Cas smiled, hugging him close. How he loved this man. This big, brave man who let him hold him like this, cradled in his arms.
“What was all that stuff they were talking about in the sermon when we got there, with the flying? Was that for real?”
Dean turned to Castiel, waiting for whatever was next. He honestly had NO idea what was going on. There certainly was no re-creation of the nativity in here, for which he felt relieved. One never knew with Cas. Dean remembered that one time Cas had showed up naked and covered in bees. He certainly hoped that bees wouldn’t be involved in whatever was on the menu tonight!
Cas bent down to kiss Dean, rocking into him gently and persistently, pulsing his grace into him, getting high himself off of the contact. He held Dean’s face with his hands, his tongue inside of Dean, his cock inside of Dean, filling him completely with adoration and his desire for him. Words had ceased. There was only their flesh meeting, skin against skin, grace against soul, and the intertwining of the two of them. Cas could tell that Dean was floating high up into subspace where he could only feel the sensations in his body, free to feel safe and loved and cherished. Cas felt himself fly up too, into a slow, steady pulse of energy that reminded him of what it felt like when the universe was created. The expansion of the stars. The first heat. The first light. The breaking open of the Earth’s crust to let the mountains through. The first kiss of the Divine to human. The first violence. The first love.
“You can pick the song. Or I can pick one for you, if you like. But it must be a serious one. I’m not going to blow you to “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas”, Dean. I warn you, you mouth off to me and you get spanked over my knee and put back in the car and that’s the end of it.”
They climbed into the car, Dean going straight to the passenger side. Cas started the car and let it warm for a minute.
Cas looked at him, and his eyes were shining. The adoration glowing out of the familiar bright blue eyes was almost more than Dean could stand. He fought the urge to look down or away. Castiel held the latch to the barn door in one hand, and then reached up with his other hand and held Dean’s chin firmly. It didn’t hurt, but Dean could feel that Cas wouldn’t let him turn his head. The show of strength was both startling and exhilarating. The energy he was feeling all around them jumped up a notch.
They began to walk down the street again, slowly heading to the Impala to get out of the snowfall, which was only increasing.  Cas noticed that Dean was fidgeting, holding back words. He rolled his eyes.
Castiel suddenly smacked Dean across his ass, two slaps in quick succession on each cheek, leaving red handprints. Dean grunted, but said nothing. He pulled at the ropes and bit his lip, enjoying the heat in his body.
And then Castiel, angel of the Lord, FINALLY pushed open the door. Dean glanced up as they walked in, seeing flashes of light as glass shattered above them. Of course, he thought. He smiled and took a second to wipe the moisture from his face. They walked in solemnly, just as Castiel had all those years before. Except this time, Dean’s hand was clasped tightly in his. The sparks of light from the exploding bulbs above echoed the brilliance of the stars they had left behind outside. Dean’s skin felt heated by the hum of energy all around them, but not uncomfortably so. The lightness of their banter at the car and their run through the field was now gone, but not in a bad way. This felt heavier, like the heaviness of thick silk against the skin, or the richness of a renaissance painting. Dean was just concentrating on keeping up at this point, unable to guess what Castiel had planned next, and still feeling slightly drunk from the words Cas had just spoken.
Castiel knew that Dean saw himself as merely his brother’s caretaker, as he had been programmed to from an early age by his father. And by extension of that role, he saw himself as caretaker of the whole world. He saw his only worth in the saving of others. And since he was a man, and not a divine savior like that other humble man long ago who was also put up upon a plank of wood, Dean was not able to save everyone. This inability, or failure in Dean’s eyes, haunted him. He was unable to BELIEVE that he was a good man worthy of love until that voice in his head grew tired and stopped talking. Sometimes Dean drank to quiet the voice. Other times he went to bars and deliberately picked fights, in a not completely conscious endeavor to get the beating he felt he deserved. Sometimes he was careless on hunts, taking injuries that he could have evaded. But Castiel knew that Dean was stubborn, and resilient, and was doing these things to quiet that voice inside of himself so he could keep going. It was his fucked up way of atonement for the sins he thought he had committed, and his mechanism for release and the blessed relief that the ensuing endorphins brought him.  Castiel would rather Dean find release with him then on the filthy floor of a bar, unsure of how far the beating would go before it finally stopped. Dean asked his angel for absolution to quiet the demons in his head, and his angel obliged. Sometimes, if the voices got quiet enough, Dean COULD believe for a little while, that he was good. That he deserved to be loved. Cas needed him to hear the words and believe them.
