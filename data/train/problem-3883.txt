“Good morning, Dean,” Castiel said. His voice was clipped. Nervous. Dean crossed his legs on the bed, and sat straighter, waiting.
He looked back up at her and said, “If your daddy will allow you to have more, I will add it.”
“I came alone.”
He’s been letting the name slide from Dean for so long, that it felt natural to hear his name being uttered by those lips. “Yeah?”
In one night Castiel managed to take out ten percent of the Italian family. In one night, Castiel managed to shake the Italians so much that Lucifer texted him and told him to keep his head up, and be on alert. Specially to keep an eye on his boy.
When Castiel returned home, his hand warmed up by the hand he was holding, he couldn’t help, but feel like his heart was going to burst out of his chest. He was going ahead from the plan. He didn’t wait for more information, he didn’t wait for anything, he just grabbed Dean and they were here now. In a way, he has broken his family’s trust and their safe place from everyone.
Castiel really didn’t like the sound of that. Trying not to shake, he grabbed the envelope off the table and ripped it open. There were at least 3 pictures in there. Of dead people. One of them was an adult lady, with what used to be dirty blonde hair, but now was coated with blood. Her eyes were closed. She had fair skin, but after her killing, there wasn’t any white spot left on her body. Her white dress was covered in dirt. She was laying down on the ground, with her hands on her belly. A white rose underneath her hands.
Hours later, Castiel sat beside Dean’s bed. Lisa had left. Castiel didn’t get yelled at again. Mostly because Sam managed to separate them to the best of his abilities. He didn’t look at Castiel the rest of the time they were in the hospital.
“Anything you want,” Dean said lifting his shoulders up in a half shrug.
Dean continued to stare at him, and after a moment, he looked down and nodded. He stepped away from Castiel and walked off in the direction of Castiel's bedroom. Castiel took a deep and shuddering breath and tried not to think about how awkward and stretched their conversations had become. How bone-tiring it was to hold any sort of conversation with the man he loved. Shaking his head, he walked to his office and clicked the door shut after him.
What were the chances of him meeting the man who has written so many amazing books that the whole world was reading? And were, understandably, obsessed with them. He started reading them first when he was in the army, and the nights were long and dreary, and very hot. His comfort had been reading these books. And now he was sitting, and having a drink with the man who kept him from losing it all.
“Go after her, then. We can take her down in a snap because she ain't clear either.”
“Oh yes, because we always have civilized conversations, don't we?”
Castiel sort of zoned out and he jumped a bit when Dean got into bed, and sidled up towards him again. He was wearing shorts and a wife beater that looked a bit loose on him. He looked good like this, and it gave Castiel more skin to touch.
Dean loosened his grip on them and flushed. “Sorry,” he mumbled. He looked back at Silver who was making aborted moves to get closer.
“I can’t see ho-“
And Dean had to stop himself from physically grabbing the kid by his arms and shaking him to submission and answering to Dean’s questions without further questions. “The girl you were playing with a minute ago. In the sand box? Yeah. She has black hair, green eyes, yea-high. Tell me, where is she?”
“Yeah, we can,” Dean said with a smile on his face, as Lisa walked back out and handed over a small suitcase with the Avengers on them.
“Lora…”
“Ooh... this tastes good.”
“Mr. Novak, I don’t think we should do this,” Dean said, clutching and swatting Castiel’s hands away from him.
Dean was so absorbed with looking at his kid that he didn’t notice the stranger dropping down to sit beside him. He did notice how close the person was sitting to him so he shuffled to the side a bit. He spared that person a glance and noticed that the person in question was a black man, close to Dean’s age by the looks of it. He was wearing casual clothes and he had a cup of coffee in his hand. His eyes were round and big, and they had this indifference, almost coldness to them that didn’t sit well with Dean. Warning signs rang in his head from this man, but he didn’t act on them. He turned around and continued to look at his daughter. Natalie was attempting to build a sand castle in the sand box, with the big boy from before, and they were both failing at it. It was rather adorable to look at.
“Make it happen. I miss having him around.”
“Thank you for telling me this,” Castiel mumbled, his eyes starting to close.
The lights turned green and Dean hit the gas. He didn't dare to glance at his brother at this moment. He was sure that if he did he wouldn't like what he'd see.
The silence and tension in the air were so thick Castiel could have cut through it with a knife.
“No excuses,” Castiel said. Dean's mouth closed with a click. “I'd like it if you were with me for a whole week. You can stay at the mansion with me. You'll have your own bedroom with your own bathroom. No one will bother you, until I say so. You'll have a free pass to go out whenever you want, unless I've explicitly told you to stay there. After the week has passed, and we agreed to continue with this, you’ll move in with me. Questions?”
Dean whimpered and said, “Yeah. I will.”
“Business is booming, I see,” Castiel commented. He walked towards the desk and leaned up against it. He took a sip from his glass and stared at Gabriel.
Dean licked his lips and re-told the whole story for the third time today. He left out the part about his daughter, twigging the story a bit. “I was out today and I was approached by this man. And he was fucking creepy, man. In a way, that I believe if I had more than ten times a shower, I would still feel his presence by my side,” Dean said.
“Just, wait for me here,” Castiel said as he tugged on his suit, and shoulder passed Crowley. “Be ready for anything,” he said over his shoulder as he walked through the doors. The Maître d'hotel was waiting for him as he walked inside. He was a tall, thin man, with just a little too large ears, but he held himself composed.
“I want you to not come,” Castiel said. “I’m going to be gone for the most of the day…” He waited for a moment before he said, slowly. “You will be alone.”
He continued to stare at Dean. After a moment, he moved his hands
Dean rubbed a hand at the back of his neck, a sheepish smile on his face. “Well, it never came up, Bobby,” he said with a tiny bit of whine in his voice.
It has been about 5 days of nonstop raining and cold, and people were thinking that they wouldn’t be able to see the sun anymore for the next couple of month. But today, the weather had other plans, and the sun was out and shining brightly in the sky.
“Why?”
Should I hide? I'm gonna hide.
Dean continued to look at him. There wasn’t anything in his expression that would give Castiel any sort of answer as to how he was feeling about this whole thing. “I know, this isn’t something that you wanted to happen, but…”
of Dean. Because of how he treated Dean. He was a terrible person.
“Sir?” Crowley walked to him, but his body was directed at the office, for Castiel to follow him. “We’ve got something.”
“Oh, sorry. His name’s Gordon. I don’t know last name since he didn’t say it.”
“Julie?” she has always been skeptical about people. She either trusted them, or didn’t at all.
Dean didn’t reply, he just continued to glare at Castiel. Truth was, he didn’t want for Castiel to know what his body was going through. The regret and the shame were starting to get themselves known to him, but he wasn’t going to acknowledge those feelings. “Nothing. I just wanted to let you know, that I’m gonna be leaving soon.”
“Thanks,” Dean said, shifting. “Uh…?”
“Hey,” said the man gruffly, and Castiel's eyes zeroed down on his lips. “I'm sorry. Gabriel said I could wait for you here and I kinda got carried away... Aaaand I'll shut up now.” His cheeks blushed and he looked around and huffed out a breath. Nervous? Possible.
Mr. Novak shook his head and said, “He wants them to think like that, because that way, people wouldn’t fear him that much. They’d think he’s Azazel’s right hand, so he isn’t a direct threat. Obviously they’re wrong.” Mr. Novak snorted and pushed away the maps and bought close one of the many books. It was written in Italian.
Dean chuckled and encouraged her into doing whatever she was doing in the backseat; which as it turned out, was to talk some more about her time at the kindergarten.
“You! You did this! My baby’s dead because of
and that made him feel warm inside, and even worse about himself. How could he be so stupid to leave him like this when he promised not to do that at all?
Dean moved his hands forward and rubbed at his slightly reddened skin. “I do, sir.”
His thoughts stopped abruptly when he felt cold hands on his own, stopping his motions. Dean deeply breathed in and out of his nose, as he struggled to calm down. “Dean?” Mr. Novak’s voice was calm, but Dean could detect a hint of concern in it. “Tell me what’s wrong. You look pale.”
“I’m fine,” Castiel said, his hand twitching at his side.
Dean looked reluctant to do it at first, but then he nodded and released Castiel from his hold. “I’ll be right outside.”
“This life is always dangerous,” he replied, finally looking up at Dean. He was once again struck by how piercing blue this man’s eyes were. Dean could drown in them, if he wanted to.
touch me again. Or I
is that I got almost attacked,” Castiel snapped at Crowley, his heart still hammering away in his chest.
Dean’s shoulders straightened as the words slammed into him, one after the other. Castiel could see the physical pain it was giving him. Dean didn’t even look at him, as he walked out of the bedroom. He didn’t even slam the door shut after him. He closed it in a quiet way, as if there was someone sleeping inside. As if he didn’t want to disturb the quiet fury in the bedroom that he had left behind.
“Can I sit with you?” Castiel asked. He waited for the consent from Dean to sit, but there was nothing but shock on his face. Castiel hesitated, unsure of what to do. So he sat at the bench that was the closest to Dean.
“Tell me the truth. Tell me where they are.”
“When I release you from your handcuffs, I want you to go and shower,” Castiel said. Dean nodded his consent and waited for Castiel’s next words. “And… I want to push your limits today. And I need to you to be vocal with it. If something doesn’t feel right, you have to tell me about it.”
And the one that he lost, personally, had a four-year-old kid. Going into five. Castiel just hoped that he would find them, both of them, soon.
“Yes,” Crowley said. “I’m assuming you already know who I’m talking about?”
“Dean-“
Dean’s face cleared, although, his mouth twitched up into a tired little smile, “I wouldn’t expect anything else from you.” And before Castiel could answer that, whatever even that meant, Dean turned around and walked out of the room. Opening and closing the door after him, with a soft click, the room was silent, safe for Castiel’s heavy breathing.
“Yes, sir.”
“Woah, woah, woah, wait. Hang on,” he said, trying to not let the panic lace his words as he tried to speak through it. “So Alastair is the leader?”
That was the only encouragement Dean needed. He gave Mr. Novak a smile, before he moved forward and took Mr. Novak’s lips into his, slowly kissing him. His hands moved to the front of Mr. Novak’s body, and glided up to the collar of his shirt. He took off black tie without a hitch, and Mr. Novak didn’t stop him. As they continued to kissed, Dean started to unbutton his shirt. He could feel how badly Mr. Novak started to shake, and his kisses were becoming more erratic. He wasn’t relaxed, he didn’t feel like he was into it, and that was putting Dean off. He gave a firm kiss to Mr. Novak before pulling back. He didn’t look down at Mr. Novak’s exposed chest. He only managed to do four buttons, but it was more than he had ever got the chance to see on a regular basis. He kept his eyes up, staring into Mr. Novak’s ice blue ones, as he tried to think of something to make him relax a bit. Because as much as he wanted to do this, he needed for Mr. Novak to take control of their actions.
The traffic was surprisingly light, so it didn’t take them long to get to Charlie’s place. When they were close by, Castiel texted her, telling her they were close by. So when they pulled over, she was already waiting for them on the front steps of her building. She was wearing a blue glittery dress. She had a navy blue coat on that went very well with the dress. It was crispy cold outside. So Castiel got out of the car faster and went close to her, as she descended the stairs. Her hair was up in a messy bun, and she had light make up on. She looked beautiful.
“If you want to put it so bluntly-“
“Wow.”
Castiel Novak sat by the edge of the bed, with his right leg hooked up on the bed, his right arm resting on it. His left hand was resting over his left hand. And he was staring right at Dean.
“Where's the library?”
He was still as beautiful as he had been all those years ago.
Dean turned around and looked at him for a moment, and then he looked back down at the map. Maybe he was right. Maybe he shouldn’t be prying into Mr. Novak’s life. He wasn’t ready to enter into the crime scene, but…
“Because you're a damn good lawyer, and I'm pretty sure that there are people out there, who do come to you for this,” Dean said as he slowly drove out of the parking lot.
“Let’s get out of here, boss,” Balthazar moved to help him, but Castiel shook his head.
She nodded and looked down at her shoes. And then, in a small voice, she asked. “You’re going to find Dean and bring him back, right?”
His head was fogged up by pleasure so much that when he said the number “ten” he didn't even realize it. He didn't realize that it was the end. The vibration stopped and Mr. Novak pulled out the vibrator from inside of him and Dean felt empty.
“You don’t give orders around here, boy,” Castiel said and he flipped them over so he was hovering over Dean. His vision swum again, but he needed to have Dean right now.
“You're gonna be dead, even before he comes here. So it's better if you confess that you stole from us, mate. He might spare your pathetic life,” Balthazar said as he leaned on his knees with his hands, to stare at their victim's face. He had done a great job, with this one. His face was nicely bruised, and bloody, and even if Balthazar squinted, he couldn't make out whose face it had belonged to.
Finally, Mr. Novak stopped by the window. He placed his right hand on the window, and leaned up against it, while the other one went to his pocket. Dean noticed that he was wearing a loose white shirt, and beige khaki pants. He looked good. Casual and simple, and something about that image made Dean’s heart rate pick up. He wanted nothing more than to go close to him and wrap his arms around Mr. Novak’s lean waist, but he held himself back and waited for him to speak.
Castiel gritted his teeth together and looked away. The way that Dean was looking at him was unpleasant. His eyes were blank with fury which was directed at Castiel, he was sure. Castiel didn’t want to drag this out any longer. So he just sighed, and without looking at Dean, turned his chair around and faced the windows. It was blazing hot outside. The sun was high up in the sky, with no clouds around it. Summer was approaching.
But he was associated with the most dangerous person anyone could ever get close to. So he was part of the family. He was as much of a target as Mr. Novak was. Especially how close they were. It wouldn’t be a surprise for Dean if they’d find out about his relation with Mr. Novak and wouldn’t use it against him.
“How can you be sure about this?” Lora demanded, swiveling around in her chair to look at Balthazar more properly. “What if she’s treating him in such way that he won’t even care about her.”
“Dean, are you okay?” he asked in a calm voice.
Eventually, it slowed down into a gentle kiss. Their lips moving together lazily, their hands caressing the places they were holding on to. Castiel pecked Dean’s lips and then moved the kisses up to his nose, his cheeks, his closed eyelids, his forehead, and back down to his lips. In between those kisses he kept apologizing to Dean for how he behaved. Whispered words on his lips, and on his cheek, close to his ear, down to his neck.
“Samandriel,” Crowley said. “He was sent out today, to take a look around on fifth avenue. To make sure that the security wasn't breached. He finished his round, of course, thankfully for us, but not so thankful for him. He was about to get picked up when he was shot on his shoulder. I'm waiting for more details, but I'm sure he is going to be fine.”
He rolled back out. He stood up, fetched the keys from the wall and threw them at Bobby to give the car back. “Lunch break,” he grumbled. On his way out he threw the screwdriver inside his tool box, the sound reverberating through the garage.
…” his name rolled off Alastair’s tongue in a way that Castiel felt uncomfortable in his own skin. “What an interesting name… I have always thought about you, and your name, and how you’re going to grow up. What type of…person you were going to be like.” Castiel stayed silent. He wasn’t going to reply because really, he didn’t want to.
“It’s alright, doll. You’re already helping me out,” Castiel said, squeezing Dean’s hand.
“Calm down? My psycho dom got my brother locked up someplace that no one has any idea where that place is. And you fucking want me to calm the fuck down?” Dean yelled, advancing on him. Castiel heard Charlie squeak, but he was too busy with being backed up against a wall by Dean. His arm was on his chest; his other hand was pushing him back against the wall; his grip was tight on him.
Please leave me your thoughts.
“Dean-“
Suddenly, Castiel dropped to his knees, feeling like a puppet on a string, his threads being cut. He fell forward and he breathed through the panic and anxiety clogging his throat. He breathed through his nose, and out through his mouth. His eyes squeezed shut as he tried to regain control over himself. But he couldn’t.
Gabriel looked up at him, with his eyes wide open, terrified, and his mouth hanging open as he tried to form words, to scream, to make a sound, but Castiel didn’t relent. He clenched his jaw tight, as he looked down at his own brother, at his own
“Good thing I’m not the only one,” Dean said with a chuckle.
“Obviously,” Dean said, not paying attention to the book in front of him. “Of course.”
To be continued...
In a way, this was what was going to happen. Castiel was going to do whatever the fuck Dean was going to tell him to do. Even if Dean would tell him to go off and throw himself off a bridge, Castiel was going to ask
. Castiel wanted nothing more than to close the distance between them, but he didn’t. He stayed rooted on the spot, his hands feeling useless beside his body.
"Yeah."
. But what good are you for him, if you’ll wound up dead? Or worse than dead?”
Dean followed him right up and kissed Castiel with everything he had. Castiel, feeling confused but not displeased, kissed Dean right back with the same enthusiasm. Their kiss was fast, rough, and biting, but it held something underneath it, that Castiel couldn’t name. Dean licked into his lips and Castiel opened up to him quickly; their tongues tangled up together in a synchronized dance. After a moment, Dean pulled back and rested his forehead against Castiel’s. Dean’s hands convulsed around his hips as they breathed in and out, faces close together.
"Uh, this way, please," the doctor led him inside another room where Sam was sitting up on the bed.
“I know how much you love these two combined together, Dean,” he said. “Let’s make you scream, shall we?”
Mr. Novak pulled back and Dean fluttered his eyes open. Novak's lips were red and slick with split, other than that he seemed to be unaffected. Whereas Dean felt like he just ran a marathon, his cheeks were aflame, and his lips burned.
They had been in here for almost an hour, and Natalie was already covered in dirt from head to toe. At some point, she started to play in the sand and she turned her head around to yell out, “Daddy! Look at me!” And Dean had laughed and shook his head at her, waving at her from the bench. And then he started to relax because he started to get less of those weird looks.
“Good boy,” Mr. Novak murmured. His fingers made a feather light way to the back of spine. He leaned in closer and kissed underneath his earlobe once again. This time he licked and sucked, and Dean didn't even have it in mind to let him know about more scars but then Mr. Novak was swiftly making his way into his boxers and cupping his ass, pulling him closer to his covered body. Dean shuddered and stiffened in his arms. Mr. Novak noticed and then he pulled away from his neck to look at Dean.
“I'm sure it was a lovely dinner,” Crowley said in his British accent. “But I assure you, this was more important.”
He watched as a father helped his kid on the swing and started to push him on it. The kid cackled in glee and screeched as his father pushed him higher and higher. The kid’s laugh was a familiar sound to Dean and he gripped the go-to coffee cup in his hand a bit tighter.
“You spoil me, Anna,” he said with a chuckle. He thanked Anna and she left. The two maids stood behind their chairs, couple of feet away. Mr. Novak introduced them as Kayla and Lora. Kayla looked nervous and fidgeted a lot, while Lora looked like she’d been doing this longer than Kayla.
“So, it’s a he?” Jessica piped up and Dean felt his cheeks flame, as he nodded. “You sly dog.”
“Closet case?”
Dean nodded and said, “Okay. Okay. We can do that. I’m going to walk with you to your bathroom, okay?”
“I thought you were. Your face didn’t give away to anything, so I just…”
. Castiel knew that this wasn’t going to be good.
Lucifer's eyes grew colder, if it was possible, and he said in a low voice, “Do not threaten me, brother. Do not drag them into this.” A vein jumped in his temple, and Castiel knew he hit the right mark.
“Yeah,” Dean breathed out. He felt his member stirring and he suppressed another shudder.
Dean hadn’t even thought about his allergy concerning any type of pets. He just wanted to see his daughter’s happy and smiling face all the time. Now, looking at his daughter smiling and safe in his arms, he shook his head and smiled at Jessica for trying to make Natalie agree to go with them. She didn’t even know why Dean was acting like this, didn’t even ask if he needed her help; she didn’t need to though, because she knew that Dean trusted her like his own brother, so she took the situation in her hands and gently stirred it into her way. Even though she had to bargain with Natalie to make her do what they wanted her to do.
He lifted his glass once more to take a sip, but stopped short, when Dean’s eyes landed on him. Dean seemed to freeze, his eyes widening. Nothing seemed to exist for them both as they stared at one another. The noise seemed to disappear for Castiel, people seemed to disappear… Castiel’s eyes were for Dean to stare into. There was no one else in this house, but them. Only them for Castiel. Dean seemed to heave out an air, his shoulders relaxed down, and his chest seemed to deflate from it all. Dean stared at him a bit longer. His eyes moved to stare at her, for only a moment, then he swiftly moved away from Amara, who spared him a glance, and then went back to her conversation. She didn’t seem to have noticed that Castiel was there as well. She didn’t seem to care about where he was going. She has, probably, thought that he was going to go back to her like a well trained dogs did with their owners. She did own Dean. In every sense of the word.
“Yes, daddy. I’m so tall I can touch your shoulder. See?” she placed her hand on Dean’s shoulder and stood up on her tip toes. “See?”
“Are you sure it’s a good idea of me coming along?” Mr. Novak asked, his head tilting to the side.
“This was brought to you. Go in there, take a quick shower, put at least your underwear back on, and come out,” she said briskly, and in a commanding voice. “I need to take care of every wound you got.”
“So, Alastair likes having everyone under his control. He is obsessed with it,” Mr. Novak was saying and it took Dean a second to realize what he said.
The house was enormous from the outside, but words failed Castiel as he tried to take the ballroom in. There were at least five different types of chandeliers, and wall-lights to make the place lighter than usual. Even though the wallpaper was old, it was in a great shape. The flooring was wooden. There were at least hundreds of tables around the room, and some people were sitting in their respectful places for the ceremony to start. Castiel steered Charlie with him to the right direction to get to their table.
Castiel couldn’t look at him any longer. He had to leave. He turned around and walked to the door. He rested his hand on the doorknob, but before he left he looked at Dean over his shoulder and said, “For what it’s worth, I’m truly sorry. I’d give anything,
He brought his gun hand and held it aloft in front of his body, with his free hand. His bruises were throbbing with how much he had been holding himself up and tense because of this whole situation. But he ignored them in favor of getting the kid safely to him. Although, the uneasy feeling was still very much present in him.
He hadn’t realized that he was laying down on the ground. He hadn’t realized that the whiskey was spilling on the floor, being wasted away. He certainly hadn’t realized that he had started to cry. And it wasn’t a silent one. It was a full blown, whole body shuddering with the sobs being ripped out of his chest.
“The cars are waiting for us. Shall we?” Mr. Novak said and Dean blinked back to reality. Mr. Novak helped him up and waited with Dean for his legs to come back to life. Dean wiggled his legs around a bit and looked up at him. He had an apologetic look to him, and asked in a soft voice, “You alright?”
“Nothing is going to happen,” Mr. Novak said as he leaned his forehead against Dean’s. “I promise you, we’ll get there in one piece. And besides,” he added, a small smile gracing his lips. “I’ve a small surprise for you.”
Suddenly there was a hand in his hair and he was being pulled back up a bit. Mr. Novak’s voice was soft and low as he said, “I want to hear you. Do not hold back on it. If you get loud, I swear you’ll have more than one orgasm.”
There was a snap of a twig and Dean sharply looked up at the direction of the forest. He lifted his hands up and grabbed onto Mr. Novak’s bare forearms. “What was that?”
“Nevertheless, it would’ve been a smarter move than this.”
They were in Manhattan, and Dean was in Manhattan. Castiel wondered why
Gabriel finally looked at him with a calculative look in his eyes. Dean stared right back and it seemed something had slipped on his face that Gabriel's eyes cleared in understanding. It seemed like they were on the same page now.
“Great,” she said and started to bustle around trying finish up the cake. Lora danced around her, adding or removing the stuff that Anna wasn't going to use anymore. It was a bit hectic, but they pulled it off as if they'd been doing this for years.
“I made a rule. For them. They weren’t going to let me win. Any round. If I’d get a winning combination, any combination, I was going to shoot them. Not kill them. Just… shoot them somewhere.”
“We are trying to find out who he is getting his stuff from,” Balthazar said, and Castiel blinked at him. He really didn’t know what to say. On one hand he was glad that his men were smart enough to keep an eye out on him, on another hand; Dean Winchester was back to the scene, and he was using.
He noticed how Dean’s shoulder’s tensed a bit, but he turned around, slowly. Castiel’s heart dropped out of his chest as he looked at Dean’s face. He looked…terrible. He was still beautiful to Castiel, but he looked so…worn out. He had bags under his eyes, eyes bloodshot, and he looked paler than usual. He was wearing a red plaid shirt, underneath a navy blue jacket. He had dark gray jeans on with his boots. He looked…
Now, Dean drove down the familiar lane towards the mansion. He stopped his car by the curb and gave his keys to Jared who smiled at him in a greeting and got inside the car, looking excited. Dean smirked, knowing exactly how Jared felt while he was inside the Impala. He walked around the car, opened his trunk and got his bag out. Once he got it, Jared drove his car towards the garage.
Dean turned incredulous eyes at him and raised his eyebrows. “Seriously?”
It didn't bring him the calmness that he searched in his soul, but his heart felt lighter after trying to patch things up as much as he could. Even if a lot of the families wanted nothing more than to see him dead.
He jumped a bit as he felt a cold hand land on his shoulder and stirred him around. Dean still kept his eyes low and didn't dare to look up. Mr. Novak was standing close to him, no regard to personal space whatsoever. Dean's mind was running fast for him to catch even with one thought process, but then his heart short circuited when he felt warm lips on his own.
Dean didn’t want to let them go, but he had to. So he stood up, reluctantly and watched as they all yipped and ran after Borya who whistled at them. He waited until they were all gone before he turned around to walk back inside, only to be bumped up against Mr. Novak’s chest. “Oomf! Sorry, I thought you walked back in.”
"You should leave," Castiel told Lora. "You should leave before something else happens to this place."
The reason for this punishment wasn’t a serious one.
For some reason, an image of Dean passed through his mind's eye, but he dismissed it just as quickly as it came. “Alastair?” he asked, instead. Even though he knew the answer to this.
“Because I, sometimes, would sneak into one of her offices and check the files she had there,” Dean said with a shrug. He seemed to be unbothered by Balthazar’s face. “So I memorized them.”
“Don’t follow me. Don’t try and have a talk with me,” Dean said. He turned to walk away, but he turned back around and said, “Please? Just… please? Leave me be.”
So that’s how Castiel found himself in Dean’s kitchen, with sweats he borrowed from Dean’s wardrobe, trying to figure out where everything was. She sat at the small table that Castiel hadn’t noticed yesterday. She had cookies perched on top of one another as she nibbled on one.
“We’re going dancing,” Dean said as he placed his shot glass on the counter and grabbed Mr. Novak’s hand.
“I know, Sam.”
again tonight.”
She looked livid, her eyes wide open and scared. She also looked panicked. And there was madness in her eyes that Dean had seen way too many times. Dean swallowed and tried to speak, but he couldn’t form word. It was as if his mouth had been sewn shut.
WARNING: the scene that plays out between Castiel/Dean is something that needs to be over watched by your Dom/partner. Please, please, please, do not practice that if your Dom/partner has no control over it. Do not disobey a direct order from your Dom/partner, as it will result to ugliness that no one wants to have in their lives.
“Yes, sir,” Crowley replied with a slight tilt of his head. There wasn’t much to say after that. Crowley left ten minutes later.
This time, Castiel didn’t go for Dean’s dick. This time, he dipped his head down, pushed Dean’s cheeks aside with his hands and attached his mouth to Dean’s hole. The reaction was spontaneous. He gasped out loud, his feet pushing at Castiel’s shoulders, legs falling apart, and his hands scrambling up to grab on to the edge of the desk a lot harder. Castiel smirked and licked at the hole again, and again, until Dean was a shuddering mess. And then Castiel started to suck on the sides, tonguing it, and soon enough he could slide in his tongue. It tasted like skin and… pickles? Probably. He didn’t pay much attention to it, he just wanted to eat Dean out. He started to suck at the rim and when it was covered in split, he started to finger at the opening. He spat on the area, which made it easier to move his fingers in and out of there. He started to lick and try to squeeze his tongue in with his finger. Determined to make Dean covered in split enough to get his dick inside.
Castiel usually spent his time in the greenhouse. He had hired gardeners, of course, to take care of the plants and the trees on the ground. But there is a small corner at the front where Castiel kept his flowers.
When he got closer, he had to literally walk over
Castiel froze, his heart started to hammer away in his chest. He wasn’t sure who Alastair had. But it seemed to be someone important to Castiel for Alastair to bring him in here to confront him about this war. He hadn’t touched his lamb, but after this revelation, he was sure he wasn’t going to eat at all.
Dean turned around and stared at the tree again. He brought the bottle to his lips and took a sip when he felt a nip on his fingers. Dean almost choked on his drink at that. He looked down and frowned at Ray. “What?” Ray looked back up at him, with sad little eyes, and Dean knew that
Castiel jammed the pen inside his eye. Azazel howled in pain, his eyes blooded and his mouth open in a scream. Castiel pulled out his pen and did it again, and again, and again… until there was nothing but gargling coming out the man’s mouth. He didn’t hesitate when he pulled out the pen and jammed it through his ear couple of times, just to be sure that the damages he was receiving was going to leave him twitching.
“What do you think of my offer?” Castiel asked instead. Dean moved his hand back and the moment seemed to be over.
The whispered word was rough against his lips. Mr. Novak rested his forehead against Dean’s and their breaths mingled together as they fought to keep their hearts from beating out of their chests.
“Dean.” Dean stopped and Castiel could see how tense his shoulders were. Castiel swallowed through a dry mouth and said, “I don’t want you to leave.”
The nurse came back to him with a tray. She placed it on the table beside the table and eyed him for a moment. She sighed. “You’re gonna need to shower, you know? We have spare clothes here-“
“Mr. Novak didn’t allow, yet.”
In between his kisses and sucking, he kept repeating Castiel’s name, and Castiel had nothing to say but to apologize to him for this. They hugged each other close for a long time. Dean started to shake after a while, and Castiel moved back to kick off his shoes and get back in bed. He got underneath the blankets and pulled it over them, mainly on Dean; even though Dean wiggled his way close to Castiel. They were lying down on their sides and Dean had his face tucked in under Castiel’s chin. He kept kissing the base of Castiel’s neck and Castiel would tighten his grip on Dean’s body. His hands never stopped moving. One hand was running through Dean’s hair, and the other was rubbing Dean’s back.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asked as soon as Castiel allowed him to have a breather. “What’s happening?”
Castiel dropped his hand from his face and said, “Yeah. I have offered it.” Castiel rubbed a hand over his face again, and whispered. “Fuck.”
“Could be,” Dean replied with a shrug.
Dean hummed and blinked couple of times. Then he reached out with one hand and brushed his thumb in between Castiel’s eyebrows. “You’ll get wrinkles like this, if you won’t stop frowning like that.”
Castiel's jaw clenched. It seemed that the Italians weren't on the same page as Castiel was. They had an agreement, but it seemed to Castiel that rules were being broken left and right. He held the gun in his left hand and cleared his throat.
Castiel sighed again, and finished off his drink. He placed his hand in his pocket, but it was empty. Heart seizing up in his chest, he turned around to find his phone sitting on the bar. He probably placed it there when he was making his drink, and didn’t notice it. He went to it, placed his empty glass on the counter and unlocked his phone.
are still a human being,” Anna said in a hushed voice, urgency lacing her words. “I don’t want to see you get hurt because of this.”
“Here,” he said and helped Dean sit up. Dean winced as the clamp dangled down from his nipple. “Oh, sorry.” Mr. Novak removed the other one and said, “Sorry. I forgot to remove this one.”
“Calm down,” Castiel said. And for some reason, directing all of his care and concentration on Dean’s worry, was helping him to calm down. “I’m fine. It was a small explosive that went off as soon as the call ended.”
“I’m glad to hear that,” Mr. Novak said, and Dean could hear him smiling through the phone.
He walked out of the room, shutting the door after him. Crowley was still waiting for him by the door. He went to open his mouth to speak, but Castiel cut him off. “Look, I know what I’m doing right now is irrational and irresponsible as fuck by me. I know it.”
Their eyes met; Dean’s eyes were wide, and before Castiel could only see worry and confusion, now it held honesty in them, and something more that Castiel couldn’t place his finger on. They stared at each other for a minute more, and then Castiel relaxed back on the bed. The tension that was in his body the minute he walked inside his house, left him in a rush. His body turned into liquid as he placed his head, face down, on Dean’s chest. He breathed in and out, through his nose, trying to calm down his wildly beating hard, but he couldn’t. It was too hard. It was hard to breathe.
Dean spared him a glance, noticing him staring at her, before turning forward again, “Uh, yeah.” He said, clearing his throat.
“Alastair, give me the girl. Now.”
“He shot-He shot a person? Why? Who?”
The syringe was still inside his vein, but he paid it no mind. His thoughts were beginning to cloud over in tandem. And the next thing he knew, there was nothing but a white noise in his ears.
“Dean, it’s fine.”
That was another thing; he had to call her nothing, but mistress. He had done the wrong thing with calling her a “miss”, once or twice, which had given her a reason to give him a punishment so severe that it took him a bit longer to recover from. So he had learned.
His cheeks were still red, but they had an angrier tint to it. Castiel was becoming a pro at seeing the difference between his blushes. It was a disturbing thought, but he didn’t think about it much. Because when Dean walked back to him, he simply grabbed Castiel’s neck and pulled him close to his body and started to kiss him in earnest. Not wanting to change their roles, Castiel quickly got the reins back in his hands and started to kiss Dean back roughly. It seemed that this is what Dean wanted, and Castiel wasn’t going to disappoint. If it meant that Dean was going to have a blissful little smile on his face when they finished, then Castiel was going to do just that.
His heart was beating like mad in his chest. It was hurting to breathe even.
“I’m not angry at you. At all!” Castiel was quick to say, his chest warming up at the gesture. “It was my own fault. And you should
Right in front of him. And he was doing
“Are you seriously asking me that right now?” Castiel grabbed her arm and walked her away from listening ears. He knew that Dean wasn’t close to them to eavesdrop, but he couldn’t be too careful. “He’s damaged.”
, do you wanna come in?”
“Hey, Robert,” he was greeted by the familiar gruff voice of one of his usual customers. Robert looked up and smiled as Dean lifted his hand up for a fist bump. Robert has been working in this park for about 30 years now. He has had way too many customers, and he would never forget the regulars’ faces. Dean had become one of his regulars’ pretty fast. Every time Robert would see the boy, he’d look more tired than before. Today it was no different.
“Hmm,” he hummed and took a sip from his glass. The alcohol burned down his throat in a pleasant way. “Okay. I don't like half-assed answers, so in the future, refrain from answering so.”
was the one that let these men in.”
“I really can’t ask you for this,” Charlie said, looking down at the card in her hands.
“Not a problem,” Castiel replied. He took his pajamas, and walked to the bathroom. He shut the door after him, and locked it for good measure.
Dean swallowed and walked further inside the room. The dealer was a young lady, probably in her early 20’s. She looked up at him, her eyes wide and terrified, her frame was shaking, but her hands were steady. Dean eyed the table and realized that they were playing Black Jack.
“Definitely,” Dean said as he unscrewed the whiskey and poured some for them both. Castiel grabbed him and sniffed.
“Dean!” it was Lora’s excited voice. Dean looked at the front door as she came out of the house and walked down the stairs. She hugged him in a greeting and Dean returned the hug.
Mr. Novak grabbed him by the hips and pulled them together. Their chests brushed up against one another and Dean couldn’t help the groan and the violent shiver that went down his body. He pushed up closer, and wasn’t disappointed when Mr. Novak did the same with him. Dean didn’t dare to let his hands wander, because he didn’t know if he was allowed to touch yet, but his brain stopped working when Mr. Novak turned them around and pushed him until he fell down on the bed. He toyed off his shoes, and bent forward to take off his socks, before he was pushed back down onto the bed by Mr. Novak.
“It’s… It’s my mom,” she said, her eyes closing for a bit, her shoulders shaking from crying. “She’s sick, and she needs money for treatment. And I’m good at hacking, I never get caught. I’ve been hacking a lot of people. I didn’t… I didn’t think that I would get caught. But I was unlucky with you, I guess.”
Leave me your thoughts in the comments~
He turned around to ask Lisa where her tablet was, when he saw her coming back out of the house with a Fuchsia-pink tablet in her hand. Dean eyed it with distaste and Lisa shook her head, with a smile on her face. She said, “Don’t ask. Maybe she’s going through a phase.”
Castiel gave him a deadpan look. He snatched the paper from Crowley’s hand and walked down the stairs, and out through the main doors. There was a car waiting for him with his chauffer waiting by the door. Castiel shook his head and said, “You’re dismissed for the night.”
“She’s doing amazingly well. I’m going to give her about two more hours and then she’s going to be ready to push.”
“But I do want to.”
They were at Sam’s house now. They were nice enough to give him the guest bedroom to sleep in for the week. There wasn’t much in there. Just a bed, nightstand, and a wardrobe. But it was cozy.
Castiel had his head cradled in his hands. For the last five hours he had been staring at the papers that Balthazar had given him about every activity that involved Dean. And… it was a lot. It went all the way back to when they ended it. The files were thick with details about everything. Every hour of every day. Everything he had worn, eaten, and made calls to. The text messages. Even the ones that he had had with Sam were here. Castiel had placed that file far from him. He was not going to break that privacy between the brothers. He didn’t want to know about that.
“You’ve already contacted someone who will give you just that, haven’t you?”
“You’re naked.”
Dean was underneath this old lady’s car, fixing up the clinking sound she kept hearing. One thing led to another, and Dean found himself immersed in her Bug. Fixing this and that. And then he changed her tires. It was starting to rain outside and she needed an oil change. So he brought the car inside the garage and started to work on it some more. He was even tempted to paint her, to make it look all brand new.
Castiel got up and walked to the bar. He poured another glass of whiskey and slowly made his way back to Dean. He placed the glass down on the table, and then took off his suit jacket. He draped it over the arm rest and when he sat, he was closer to Dean this time. He rubbed his hands together and said.
“Woah, wait, don’t you wanna get it looked over or something?” Dean asked grabbing his arm, preventing him from moving further.
Dean who looked as if he saw seeing a ghost; or Castiel covered in blood. Dean who was talking to him, but Castiel couldn’t hear him. Dean who looked
“Hm?” she said, dabbing at a bruise close to his left eye.
“And you call yourself their owner,” Dean teased Mr. Novak who gave him a blank look. Dean had to fight back the urge to stick his tongue out at him.
“I want you.”
“And who's going to be your new client?”
“Well… as I said before I like what I do at my job, because the person that I’m doing it with actually is a considerate person, despite his reputation with the-“Dean waved his hand around –“outside world.”
“It’s alright,” Mr. Novak said, freeing his hands from Dean’s clutches. “Now, hold my hand and follow my lead.”
Mr. Novak, satisfied with this, grabbed Dean’s hand and dragged him out of the kitchen. Dean followed him up the stairs and down the hallway towards their playroom. Once the door was closed behind Dean, Mr. Novak pushed him up against the door and started to kiss Dean roughly. Dean kissed him right back. His hands slid up Mr. Novak’s chest and wrapped around his neck, to pull him closer. Mr. Novak’s hands were wrapped around Dean’s waist as he pulled him closer and closer. Dean could feel how hard Mr. Novak was so he grinded up against him.
“Bathroom is the door next to mine. There’s an oil in a basket under the sink,” Dean said as he laid down on his stomach.
“Oh, she's starting to love me, I think she won't mind,” Dean said with a smile of his own.
“You back to the living world?” Dean said, leaning against the door frame.
“I’m not having a good day today,” she said with a slight shrug. “Good luck, though. To you two.” And then she left the table. So it was only Gun and Castiel left by the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who said anything about killing anyone?” Castiel frowned at him, feeling confused. “I just need it for protection. If things go south.”
“That never sounds good,” Dean said, closing his book and placing it by the bed.
He only moved when the doctor would come in to give him the news.
And again, thank you so much for reading.
“Dean, please.”
“Really?” Dean asked him, incredulously. “
Castiel swallowed as his brain registered what Crowley just said. Dean didn’t know where he was. Dean didn’t know he was meeting up with Alastair. How angry was he going to be with Castiel, was a question that he didn’t have an answer to. But he knew, that if he were to tell Dean about this plan, he was going to try and tell him to not to do it. He was going to talk Castiel out of this, but he didn’t want it. So he wouldn’t know about it, until Castiel would let him know, personally.
“Oh, right. Well, usually fantasy novels,” he said. “I finished writing one recently. I’m waiting for the last email from my editing team soon.”
d, but he left as well. “We move in five, Mr. Novak.”
“Sam…” Castiel recognized Jessica’s voice from the background.
“Yeah, I do. That’s why, my men are out there now, going after Sam. And then they’re going to take him to the hospital, to get him checked.”
Dean looked down at Mr. Novak’s thoughtful face, and pondered about it for a moment; what would he think if Dean told him about his last dom? Or what would he say, or do, if he knew that his last dom was part of the Italian family? That he was the one that left scars all over his body? That he was the one that would torture him as a way of punishment or anything that would cause Dean more harm than anything else? Would he get angry? Would he want to go out there for revenge because of what they’d done to Dean?
“Well?”
Once he was done with the shower, he went to get dressed. He didn’t look at his naked body in the mirror. Like he always did, he avoided it at all costs. Today, especially today, he didn’t need to see the reminders of who he really was. He needed to concentrate and keep his mind clear.
Dean’s body shook from it.
“Good. Let’s go then.”
“What do you mean?”
“He? As in…?”
She took a steadying breath, Castiel noticed, as she tried to compose herself some more. “I… When Bobby died few years ago, and Dean wasn’t around to keep the garage running, I was unemployed.” Hearing his name made Castiel feel a bit lightheaded for a moment. “But I couldn’t find anywhere that would hire me. And I needed the money.”
“Let him go, or you’ll get what you deserve.”
“So…?”
No one was ever going to be Dean. That was something Castiel had learned a long time ago. Maybe from day one, but he has never confirmed those thoughts before. But now, after so many years of not being around Dean, Castiel accepted that fact.
from the bag next, with its leg holster. He secured it on his calf and placed the gun in there. He took out two
He sat there as she applied a gauze here and there. She then started to stitch up his more pressing wounds. She then started on his face, and Castiel could see
“Just a thank you,” Dean breathed out, tilting his head to the side, their noses touching one another.
His hands felt rough and calloused as he twisted his fingers together and placed them over his belly. They weren’t dirty right now, but they felt filthy and Castiel, not for the first time, thought about how anyone ever let him touch them. Let him shake their hands… Even though most of the people he had shaken hands with were on the same line of work as his was.
Gabriel nodded and smiled. “Mhmm… no complaints from me, really.” He paused, and then asked. “How’s your boy toy?”
Castiel didn’t allow him to continue. He moved forward and wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck and pulled him close to him. Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s waist and pulled him close to his body. And Castiel felt like he could finally breathe. He could feel the air that left his body, and on inhale, he could feel how his lungs expanded to accept the air in them. He could feel how Dean’s stubble tickled his jaw, and he could feel how much strength he was putting into the hug, and Castiel was a drowning man, and Dean was his salvation. Dean was the man who he wanted right now to pull him up for air. He could feel it all. And, he was a gone man, once more.
Castiel threw the phone at the nearest trash can he could find and the phone exploded. He ducked and four of his men ducked over him, with their backs to the explosion. Thankfully it wasn’t a big one and there was just some trash scattered all over the place. He was ushered into the nearest car that came for him and it left the scene with a loud roar and a screech of tires.
. – Yeah. Whatever. Bye.”
The place was run by Italians. So it was the only logical reaction for these people to look at him as the wolf in a sheep’s den. Maybe he was… Maybe he was the wolf and the monster they thought he was. Maybe he was the bad bad wolf after their sheep.
“That’s great. What’s your pen-name though? Or do you go with Castiel?”
“Yes.”
Castiel leaned up against the counter and closed his eyes. He took deep steadying breaths in and out of his nose. It was going to be fine. This could go mostly in a wrong way. And it was going to be fine as well. Because he could do it. Or it could go over well. Right? Right.
“Why? I mean, not that I'm complaining, but...”
’ when she did that, and then he bent forward, took her up in his arms and hugged her close to his chest.
They wrapped their arms around each other and Dean had grabbed the back of his head, and curled his fingers in to grab onto his hair. Castiel had let out a sigh from his nose from the feeling and it made him clutch Dean a bit harder.
“Then I’ll trust you,” he said and signed on the appointed places. Dean signed on his places and nodded.
Castiel sighed and tried to walk past him, but couldn't. Dean stepped in front of him and held up a hand to stop him. "What?" Castiel asked, and he tried not to snap. He was feeling tired already.
“Don’t get me wrong, sir, you’ve done well since I have started to work for you,” Balthazar quickly reassured him. “It just feels different now.” Balthazar shrugged and sighed. After a moment of silence, he added, “But… if you have to get him back in your life, because you want and need him, then I will not question it and be right by your side to take on the plan.”
“Oh I know how much they are willing to lay down in their own pool of blood for
And just like that Dean’s nerves skyrocketed again, but he nodded as he sat at one of the armchairs, close to the window. He squeezed his eyes shut and started to breathe in and out, slowly through his nose. He heard Mr. Novak leave, probably to talk to his pilot about something.
“Didn’t you get the memo? I’m the new King of hell. I run this place. You don’t. I win. You lose. It’s simple as that.”
Dean turned his head to Castiel’s neck and started to kiss and sniff him. “Cas… Cas… Cas…”
“What surprise?” Dean was completely engrossed in having Mr. Novak so close to him. The smell of him was incredibly intoxicating and Dean greedily inhaled. If Mr. Novak noticed this, he didn’t say anything.
So here he was wearing a pink, lacy underwear, with probably thousands of dollars worthy of a suit, and looking like a
Dean didn’t know. His body was already moving before he actually formed a plan or anything else, really. He put his boots on and grabbed his jacket from the door. Ray wagged his tail on the couch, looking at him with these eyes that Dean had to go to him and pet him on the head again. Ray sighed and dropped his head back down on the couch, closing his eyes. Dean shook his head and huffed out laugh.
It was too silent here, and he didn’t know what he was going to be greeted with when he’d open the doors. Taking a deep breath, he reached for the door handle. He was just about to turn it down, but he felt a presence behind him. He lifted his hand off the handle, slowly, and then tightened his hold on his gun.
“I’m sorry if this wasn’t something that you were prepared to hear. Especially from me,” Sam said, and he did sound apologetic as he said it.
Castiel opened his eyes just in time to see a big lightening cut through the sky. He pursed his lips, took another deep breath of fresh air through his nose, and then went inside. He dropped the now empty bottle in the bin and walked out of the kitchen.
His phone rang and he literally threw himself at his nightstand to get to it on time. The screen ID said
He couldn’t.
“I can't do without day offs,” Dean said looking down at his hands.
Castiel hooked Charlie’s arm around his, and they both walked down the path that lead to the stairs. Staying at a respectful distance, and keeping a close eye to their surroundings, Alfie was just to his right side. His men were spreading out slowly around the grounds, Castiel noted. This was part of their arrangement for the night. To keep close and alert for sudden intrusions.
“I’m getting food for us here. Something light. You need to gain your strength back,” Castiel said as he finally got his hand on the com.
“Call,” Castiel said.
“You’re not a fuck up, Dean,” came Mr. Novak’s soft, gravel voice. “Just because bad things happened to you, and you made some choices to prevent it from happening more in your life, and just because some of those choices were poor choices, it doesn’t make you a fuck up.” Dean sniffed and he tried to speak again, but he couldn’t; he simply continued to cry. “Can I tell you something? I need you to give me a verbal response to this.”
“It’s a ’67 Chevy Impala. It was pretty beat up when my dad had it. Even though he loved the car, he wasn’t really good at taking care of it,” Dean said, remembering those days vividly. “When I was in high school, he gave up the keys to me and told me to take care of it.”
It took him a few more minutes to grab some more clothes to take with him. Then he grabbed a back bag and started to place his favorite books by Vonnegut in it. He then added his toiletries, socks, and some other essentials. Once he was done with that, he wandered back inside to his walk-in closet and got his box from underneath the shelves. He hoisted it up in his arm and walked to his bed. He placed the box on it and took a moment to gather his thoughts. He wasn't sure if he needed to bring his toys with him, but he was going to take them with him, just in case. He didn't want to open it here. In case he'd get cold feet or something.
“Okay, okay. Let’s go.”
“Dean? Dean where are you?” There was more rustling and a painful cry. Castiel gripped his phone tighter, his eyes growing wider. “Dean!?” he yelled into his phone, his nerves fried over the edges.
“I know. This is supposed to be our first night together and yet, I have a business to attend to,” Mr. Novak said, and he did look apologetic. “I'm hoping I can take care of this as fast as I can and come back home to you.”
“Enough!” she shrieked. Dean snapped his mouth shut with a click. “Get out.”
“Is that a forest?” Dean asked, his eyes watering a bit from the direct sunlight.
There was the familiar clanging when the back door opened and he stiffened with preparation for the pain to start. The familiarity of the shoes that made their way over to him, made him tag on the restrains on his wrists a bit more. The sharp pain from the cuts were distraction enough to keep him grounded.
“She will attack again,” Balthazar said, looking down at the map of the city on the dinner table. It was marked with red and blue marks for their safe houses and hers.
It was a pure torture being here when he had that memory and despite the sourness the memory brought itself with, Castiel missed Dean. Missed having him around, arguing with him, laughing at him, or with him, he simply missed Dean’s presence in his life.
Dean clutched at his chest, falling backward slightly dramatically, and groaned, “You wound me.”
Thirty minutes later, they shook hands, and the deal was done. Castiel left the building with his men, jacket over his elbow. He walked out of the front door and looked around. It had stopped raining and the air was filled with humidity that he liked feeling on his face. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath of fresh air. “I want to walk for a bit,” he said to no one in particular.
you alone. Okay?” Mr. Novak emphasized the word 'leaving' for Dean. It seemed like he knew that Dean felt distressed by it. Dean bit down on his lower lip. He hesitated for just a moment, but then slowly nodded.
because he straightened up, twisted Dean’s arms behind his back. He got both of Dean’s wrists in one of his hands, and with the other one, he bent forward and pushed Dean’s face down on the bed.
“Did I tell you, you look nice today?” Dean asked as they crossed the street.
Dean’s eyes flew open, and he pulled back a bit to look at Mr. Novak. “Has there been any mishaps before?”
“I’m going to dance some more. I need to sweat this food out. You coming?” Dean asked, holding out his hand, even though he knew the answer was going to be a negative one.
“Not a problem,” Castiel said. “I needed a friend with me tonight.”
“Hey,” Dean tried not to bark at the kid, but he couldn’t control his emotions. He was becoming jittery and it was never a good sign. The kid startled at the sudden appearance of an angry parent, his face freezing in terror as he stared up at Dean. “Where’s she?”
“I didn’t know. I was busy with making attack plans for the last few days!”
Dean turned around to look at him. Mr. Novak’s gaze was warm as he looked at Dean, and after a moment of basking himself in the heat of Mr. Novak’s eyes, Dean nodded and said, “If it’s no bother.”
Castiel’s eyes doubled up in sizes and he stared at Dean with his mouth hanging open. “What?”
“Another?” Mr. Novak asked, and after that Dean lost count as to how many they drunk, one after another. Soon, they were woozy from the alcohol and their bodies had gravitated towards each other. Dean could feel him sweating a lot, and try as he might, he couldn’t wipe off the beads of sweat from his face. So he just let himself be. Mr. Novak wasn’t far behind on the sweating.
Mr. Novak closed his eyes, took a deep steadying breath, released it, and nodded. “You’re right. I’m sorry. I’ll do better now. We should head back.” He leaned towards Dean, tugging at his hands to make Dean bent a bit forward. Dean did, and Mr. Novak placed a soft kiss on Dean’s cheek, and Dean closed his eyes, cherishing the warmth of his lips on his cheek.
He could feel Mr. Novak’s intense stare at the back of his neck, and without realizing it, he felt a bit more confident. He didn’t care that he didn’t know anyone there, aside from Anna, but soon he was dancing and laughing with the bridesmaids, and some older ladies who got charmed by him. In between these moments, Dean kept shooting glances to their table, where he noticed Mr. Novak staring at him. His eyes were clear blue, and intense, as he looked at the way Dean danced to the upbeat music.
“Stop yelling, Jesus Christ,” Balthazar hit him on the head again. Dmitry’s screaming turned into a painful moans.
“You don’t have the authority for it.”
“But I do. And I have, so deal with it,” Dean said with a chuckle. Castiel shook his head and smiled at Dean.
“I don’t think this is hurting you much.”
He woke up with a gasp. His whole body shivering. His bedroom was dark; the only lights in the room was the silver of the half-covered moon as it cascaded through the windows. The pitter and platter of the rain could be heard over his ragged breathing. His hand was shaking as he lifted it to wipe at his brow, to take the sweat off a bit. His T shirt was clinging to his frame from it. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed and sat up straight.
Dean thought for a moment, before he shrugged and said, “I can’t really be sure. Because while they do have a schedule, I wasn’t supposed to know it.”
“Dean doesn’t enjoy today’s advanced…stuff,” Mr. Novak interrupted. There was an amused smile on his face, and Dean rolled his eyes, a smile on his own curving up his lips. “You still left the stereo the same, right?”
“Oh.”
“Dean, do you have a safe word? Or do you want to go with the standard guide of the colors?”
The airport was busy though, which gave him moments of anxiety, but it was alright. He was okay.
“I’m being careful Anna.”
Castiel was discreet about where he was currently living with his family. He didn’t go out as much he used to, but at the same time, he wasn’t hiding. His men kept the city up and running, taking care of the family who were depended on him and his protection. He made deals and broke some up. He kept it all down on the low, and it all worked out.
Dean sat there, staring at the screen, trying to make out what he was seeing. He blinked couple of times, as the screen flickered from one scene to another. There was a smoke coming out of a house, and the red banner with big white letters covering it, saying;
“I can’t leave you like this. Not right now,” Dean said again, this time there was a bit more force behind his words.
He turned around from Balthazar and walked to the window, to look outside. The sky was starting to grey again. It was going to rain soon. Biting down on his lower lip, he tried to school his features and his voice as he asked Balthazar to find out more about this situation.
However, it didn’t.
“Why didn’t you go with them?” asked Dean, as they started walking in Dean’s apartment’s direction.
“Oh, Dean… I’m so sorry, I should’ve-”
“He wouldn’t introduce you to us if he wasn’t interested in you in more than one way,” she said softly, her hands squeezing his in a tight grip.
“You’re drunk.”
Castiel dropped his hips down and shuddered as his lower region connected with Dean. He started to rut against Dean’s hips. Somehow Dean managed to get his hand out of Castiel’s grip and he started to push Castiel away. Their lips left each other’s in a wet sound, and Dean rushed to say, “You aren’t even hard, Cas. Just don’t do this now. I’ll stay the night, if you want me to, just don’t do this.”
"Someone probably let them through," Castiel sighed again and shook his head.
“Natalie,” she replied crunching on her cereal.
“Do you know why you’re getting spanked?”
… the person who betrayed him. The person who made the killing happen.
“Yes, sir.”
“Not yet, sir. No. I’ll let you know, sir,” Dean said, his voice breathy.
“No, let me talk,” Dean said, with a shake of his head. His hair was white from the snow. His eyelashes had some snow on them, but they melted away as he blinked, only to be taken by more snow. Castiel swallowed, but nodded. He kept his mouth shut to let Dean speak his mind. He owed him that much… “From the moment I got to know you, or even before that. Probably, I don’t know. But when I started to get to know
“Yeah, okay,” Mr. Novak breathed out, turning his head and placing a soft kiss on his cheek. “On one condition.”
Dean shook his head, his breath tickling Castiel’s skin. “I was just…” Dean pulled back and cupped Castiel’s cheek. “I’ve never seen you with a kid before. I never thought you would be so…”
Dean ended the call and his shoulders dropped a bit. He hung his head forward and raised his hand to wipe at his face. Castiel didn’t know what to do; should he go to Dean, or wait for him to come back? What seemed to be only few minutes, but it felt longer for Castiel, Dean composed himself enough to straighten his back up, and walk back to Castiel.
Dean frowned and quickly shook his head. “No,” the whispered words left his mouth in a breath.
and stood up fully. Dean pried his eyes open and looked at Castiel. His lips were red and wet, his cheeks flaming, his hair a mess from Dean’s fingers, but his eyes were dark, a blue ring around them, full of lust, and piercing as they looked into Dean’s eyes. “Don’t hold back,” Castiel whispered to him, gruffly. His voice had gone lower if it were possible. And Dean shuddered as he heard him speak.
"Not that it's any of your concern," Castiel said. "But, I've been having some health issues recently, and I need to be monitored more by them."
Castiel licked his lips and started down the hallway. His steps were slow, unhurried, since he didn’t know who else was there. The first hallway was empty. He turned to his right, where a door stood ajar. Peeking inside, he saw that it was the kitchen. The stuff members were working on a meal and Castiel wanted to turn to the other side and find another doorway, without having to kill these people, but then he noticed that they weren’t actually working. They all had knives in their hands. They were ready for him.
“I can’t win! I can’t win at anything. I lost the person who meant something for me. In my entire fucking life, I met a man who actually accepted the real fucking me! And now he’s gone and I can’t win anything. Fuck. You left me!” the words were like a slap on Dean’s face. “And I’m coping however way I can!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, Mr. Novak. No,” he said and he took a step back. Castiel traced the movement with his eyes. Dean’s hands were shaking again as he said, “I’m here to keep you company, right? To make you feel better. To make you feel… feel
Castiel felt Dean tense up as the words left his mouth. He didn’t look at Dean this time. He was staring out the window. It was starting to snow, while they sat there in the silence of the room. Castiel didn’t know how long they sat, but it was probably a long time before it started to snow a bit harder, and Dean shifted in his seat and said.
In return, I'll just have to ask for you to be patient with me, as much as you can, please.
Twice…
Really, Sam had no right to be this way. It wasn't like Dean had any other choice. And it wasn't like Sam was going to be able to help him out with the money. Not now, anyway, when he was going to be a father in a 2 months. He had entertained the thought of asking Sam to help him out with this, and he was sure that Sam would go out of his way to be able to provide for them all, but Dean wasn't a sadist like that. He wasn't going to ask Sam for anything. Not after he took care of his divorce papers, pro bono. Even when Dean begged him to allow him to pay some of it, Sam still denied it. “
Soon though, the energy seeped out of him and he rested his forehead against the wall. Breathing heavily, he brought down his fist. He gritted his teeth in frustration. Squeezing his eyes shut he breathed in and out of his nose.
Something low and purring settling in in Castiel’s chest. Making up his mind at the spot, he flipped Dean back onto his back and attacked his lips into a searing kiss. Dean followed him right back. Soon, Castiel was turning Dean back onto his belly, pushing Dean’s legs apart, and working him right open for another amazing night time sex.
An orchid flower in the pot needed his attention today, so he had been working on that for a few hours.
Castiel walked up to the ones that he shot first, writhing in pain and grunting, holding to the parts where they were bleeding from. He pointed his gun at the first person closest to him. “Where’s Alastair?”
The ride back home was silent. Crowley was staring out of the window. It was well past midnight now, and the street lights were casting shadows in the car. Castiel sat, immobile, staring ahead but not seeing anything. He felt numb. Completely numb. All he wanted to do was to go to Dean and just… he just wanted to see Dean.
“Where’s who?” the kid squeaked out, looking absolutely terrified by now.
“I need someone who won't be an ass and will be okay with my limits. I can bend some rules, in time, but for starters, I need it to be on my terms.”
“What I’m doing is called payback, Castiel,” Alastair replied calmly. “You’ve taken my right hand. I couldn’t not do the same to you, could I?”
Castiel grabbed Dean’s phone to look at the message. It read; “
He had shaved that morning, and his skin looked smooth to the touch. Dean had felt how smooth it was underneath his skin, but right now, he wanted to touch his face. This close and under the daylight, Dean could see how tired Mr. Novak actually looked and how old he was. There were laugh lines around his eyes, a permanent wrinkle between his eyebrows. His forehead had worry lines. The gray in his hair was a bit more prominent now, but Dean had never seen such a beautiful man in his life. Probably ever. His lips looked slightly chapped and dry, and Dean fought down the urge to move forward and kiss them, to make them shiny again. He licked his own lips and it seemed that it drew Mr. Novak’s attention to them, because his eyes flicked to them, and then back down at his hands as he worked on his seatbelt.
His fingers left Dean's inside and Dean felt his hole fluttering shut. His eyes were shut and he felt Mr. Novak moving around his back. Soon, his hands were back to his ass and he heard the lube squirting sound. Few seconds later, Dean felt the blunt sharp head of the plug being pushed into his ass. Dean gave a full body shudder and relaxed his muscles. One final push, and it was fully in.
That was the last straw for Castiel.
Castiel was glad he could hear Dean’s voice, and his lips curled up into a small smile. His face muscles ached from it, but he didn’t mind it one bit. If it meant that Dean would stop looking at him like that; with so much concern in his eyes, and worry, he would smile as much as he could.
“Have I told you how much I like hearing you being a mother?” Castiel said, and heard the answering laugh from Anna. It was always great listening to hear her laugh like this. Castiel was really happy for his sister and her family. She did deserve the best, and Emilio was the best person she could’ve married to.
There was another minute of silence, and then, Dean heard Sam release his breath, “Alright. Call me if anything, okay?”
He checked the time and found that he had time to shower before he could leave. So he did just that. He took a bit longer in the shower, making sure he cleaned up thoroughly. He wanted to impress Mr. Novak. It was stupid, really. They didn't even know each other, but he had the urge to make sure that Mr. Novak was satisfied with him. But then, it wasn’t stupid. He needed this job so he could be able to see his daughter.
“Wha-Wait! What the… Sir,” Crowley caught up with him and stepped in front of him. “What do you mean by that?”
He could be good like that.
Castiel wasn’t sure if he was able to breathe properly. There seemed to be something really heavy being stuck on his neck and his chest heaved as he tried to breathe through the pain. Someone called his name, but there was a rushing in his ears, and he couldn’t hear anything. Blindly, he searched for his car, and then he remembered that he didn’t drive here. But close by, he recognized Alfie’s car right away. So he went to it and got inside. Alfie was behind the wheel, and without saying a word, he started the car and drove off.
Dean didn’t answer to him. Instead, he walked away to the back lot where they had thousands of wrecked cars. He liked walking through this side, because it was so relaxing. He heard Bobby following him, but he didn’t stop. He wanted to go to the car that he had his eyes on. It was an old ’69 Ford Mustand that had seen way better days. He was planning on fixing it someday.
“So,” Dean said, trying not to think of Mr. Novak’s hand on his back, rubbing soothing circles. “What’s all this?”
“Boss…” The front door had opened and Balthazar was there with Charlie, standing behind him with her eyes wide and looked both surprised and terrified. “I got Charlie.”
“I know. But you… Remember when you asked me about someone?”
“Of course it is dangerous. Our whole life is dangerous, but we don’t live in fear,” she said. “We don’t care what others think of us, or how we live our lives. He doesn’t care either.”
It was his father’s ring, which he would wear all the time to represent who he was and which family was his. Castiel grabbed the ring and stared at it for a moment, admiring their family crest on it. It was a white gold diamond ring. Their family crest was of angel’s wings. Only the highest members of the family had black wings. The others, and the one that Alice had tattooed on herself, was of white wings.
Dean’s mouth dried at the statement, and after a moment of hesitation, he breathed out and his body released the tension that he didn’t even notice he adopted. He lifted his arms up and hugged Mr. Novak back and he felt the same thing happen to his body. They both took comfort from the embrace.
“I mean; didn’t you offer it to me?”
“Actually, scared of her hurting you.”
There had been a steady income of ideas of what to do and who to contact for these actions to take place. He knew for a fact that the Trans family would be by his side with no hesitation. The Germans were a bit of a problem, since they were more involved in drug dealing. And it was already confirmed that Dean was using… and if he was using then he was definitely getting his stash from them, since they had the best drugs in the city. Castiel had to play his cards right, here. Because he wanted for them to stop selling it to Dean, but then he had to do it carefully so as to not draw too much attention to that form of action. He also needed for the Germans to be by his side in this case, because they were a good asset to have. He’d have to have a meeting with Aaron again.
“What are you trying to say, Dean?”
“J-Just the…
“I don’t care. Holy shit I can touch you.
Mr. Novak pushed away from the kiss but didn’t go too far. “I wanna do something else tonight,” he nipped at Dean’s lower lip, which made him shudder. “Something we haven’t done before.”
Castiel glared at the last message.
Dean let out a sound that he couldn’t quite figure out exactly what it was, because this was the first time Dean was feeling Mr. Novak’s naked body on his. He had also taken off his underwear with his pants and this felt incredibly. This was the first time he was feeling Mr. Novak’s heat. The slight body hair that he had on his legs, and around his navel. He had chest hair which Dean hadn’t felt before. He wanted to reach out and touch every space available, so much, that he couldn’t think of anything else. His whole body was covered in sweat. He was feeling light headed and Mr. Novak was starting to smell so good.
Castiel saw the manager looking anxiously at him from her place by the bar, but she didn’t make a move. It was like she knew what was happening, but she didn’t want to be in the way, it seemed. Castiel noticed her swallowing, and then she looked down at her computer screen.
“I don’t like loud crowds. Friends of groups, yeah. But not the Time’s Square kind.”
The question hang open there, but Dean knew what he meant. If he needed Mr. Novak by his side right now, he’d be here before Dean would be able to end the call. But… talking to him on the phone was starting to relax him in a good way. “No… no, thank you, sir. You talking to me on the phone is helping me relax, actually.”
“I’m sorry. Was he a family member?”
“That must be Silver. He is always so impatient. Never waits for me to call for him.”
He didn’t want to touch something so pure, never touched by the bad in the world before. His hands weren’t clean. He didn’t want to defile this child with his hands. He wasn’t a clean man.
Nobody said anything as they processed this new information about the arrangements; Lora sipped at her tea and looked up at Balthazar from the corner of her eyes. He was pursing his lips, he looked like he was contemplating whether to say anything about this, or not. But he thought better off it, and just frowned.
When they got back to the house, and back to their bedroom, - because, really, Dean wasn’t even using the spare one in the house, - he started to unbutton his shirt with jerky movements. His fingers were shaking, and his heart was still hammering away in his chest. How did one of Alastair’s man sneak inside? And no one noticed him? How did they find Dean? How did they know where he’d be? How-
“Yeah, figured we’ll get here so I can ask if you’d like to come upstairs for a wine. I think I have some left.”
“Hm?”
.)” the man,- Dmitry- was shaking like a leaf as he bubbled away, trying to get to Castiel. But Castiel had had enough of these people thinking they could get away with their shit. “У меня есть семья, сэр. У меня есть дочери. Я нуждаюсь в них, сэр. Я не могу оставить их. Пожалуйста, сэр. Пожалуйста. (
Dean grunted as he lifted his hips up to get to his phone. Ray had picked up his head to look at Dean for causing him distress. “Sorry,” Dean muttered at him. He looked down at the call ID and frowned. It said
“I don’t feel like showering,” Dean was quick to say. Castiel smiled at him and nodded.
He just wanted to get this over with and go back home and take care of this before it would get too out of hand.
“Why did he do that though?”
“Of course not. I wouldn’t offer if it was,” Mr. Novak said as he moved to sit up straighter.
“Hey, Mr. Novak,” he said, and there was little to no accent to his voice. The guy was born and raised in New Jersey, so of course he had no accent. Castiel rolled his eyes at himself.
“I’m worried that you being worried about Dean will not keep your head in the game. You do know we are going to see him, right? And he’ll probably be by her side.”
“Sir… Sir, I need more. Please give me more. I
“If you need my help so much, you better watch that tongue of yours.”
"What health issues?" Dean's frown only deepened.
“We used to call him
Dean didn’t know what he was going to say to Mr. Novak, or how he was going to approach this subject and try to coax Mr. Novak into trusting him enough to share, but knowing that the thing that he feared wasn't being touched on his bare skin, was actually relieving.
He tried to breathe in again and there it was. The image that he never wanted to see in his life. He never wanted to even think that it was going to happen. But there it was. There it fucking was.
So, we are at the end of this long as, and beautiful, journey, people. I loved writing it and I sure as hell loved it when I got to share with the best readers I have had in a long long while. Thank you so much for sticking with me for so long.
“You’ve got to tell me what’s underneath your clothes that you don’t want me to see,” Dean said. His voice forceful and full of urgency. “If you want us to work, you’ve got to let me in. Every way.”
“It is fun. Sometimes it does get frustrating, but in general, I like it.”
Was this some sort of a thing that he was into? Dean could work around that. It would suck, but if that's what he wanted to do, then Dean was going to deal with it. It could be hot, too, right? It could be, sometimes. Did he even sweat?
“On one condition,” Dean whispered back his hands digging even more into Castiel’s ass cheeks.
“I have to cut this meeting short. Accept my apologies.”
It’s true. Castiel had thought about it. He does need a new consigliere, now that Crowley is… Castiel clenched his jaw and he looked up at Balthazar after a moment. Balthazar had always been there whenever Castiel needed him. Even if it was mostly to kill people that wronged Castiel, or pissed him off.
The weather was crazy hot in Spain as they arrived. Castiel adjusted his sunglasses on his face and, patiently, waited for Dean to descend the stairs of the jet. His cheeks were flushed from arousal, his hair was sweaty and was clinging to the sides of his face. Dean kept fanning his shirt on his body, but it didn’t seem like it was helping him. He had a frown on his face and every time he walked Castiel knew exactly why he was wincing. On their way to here, Castiel had used every level on the vibrator to make Dean come. He had bent Dean in different positions, with the vibrating butt plug, still inside. He blew Dean one time and got a mouthful of come. Dean’s taste was something that Castiel wanted to taste for the rest of his life.
Did he feel the same contentment that Dean felt whenever they’d have these moments together? Was he, also, getting comfort just by breathing Dean in? What was going on in his head?
“Nope,” he bit out. “Not at all.”
And I hear about this from Sam? What the fuck Crowley?”
“I don’t…” Castiel sighed through his nose, looking away from Dean. Not knowing what he wanted to say.
“Enough…” Castiel whispered, his hands loose on Dean’s wrists now, but Dean didn’t pull away. He just sat there and stared at Castiel.
“What club?” Dean asked as they took the stairs up to the second floor.
Dean clenched his jaw, feeling like he needed to check everything again, even though he knew that everything was in a perfect condition. “Fine. Okay. Let me just get this screw in right and she can have her car back.”
“I want to see him myself.”
Suddenly, there was a warm hand on his knee and Dean looked to his right. Mr. Novak was looking at him with worry and concern in his eyes, but his face stayed neutral. Dean was so lost in his own thoughts and didn’t even notice that the food on the table had been replaced by dessert and his wine glass had been refilled. He wrestled the dryness in his throat and breathed out through his nose. He hadn’t realized how stressed he was, until he felt the calming presence of his dom’s hand on his knee. He placed his hand over Mr. Novak’s hand and squeezed it tight. Something loosened in his chest when Mr. Novak squeezed his hand right back.
Castiel shook his head and frowned down at the ground. He knew that it wasn’t sane. But he couldn’t do anything about it, now, could he? So he said nothing, and cleared his throat, and changed the subject back to the girls. She answered to his questions of course, trying to sound cheerful as best as she could, but there was something in her voice.
“Cas-“
Dean’s eyes fluttered closed on the praise, his lips parting a small choked off sound leaving his throat. Castiel kissed his cheeks once more, and their car arrived. They were going to head off to Castiel’s house in Barcelona, and then they were going to drive out, just a bit off of the country side to Anna and her fiancé, Emilio’s house.
Once he was done, he slowly moved back. Dean sucked at his spent member as he did so, and once Castiel was all the way out, he slapped Dean, hard, on the cheek. “Ahh…” Dean said, but it wasn’t a painful sound. It was a pleasurable sound.
“Dean, please.”
While he was kissing, and exploring his shoulders and arms, Dean started to move his hips up and down to feel Mr. Novak’s dick alongside his clothed one. The lace was thin and it almost felt like it wasn’t even there. Mr. Novak didn’t disappoint though; he dropped his hips down and started to move against Dean’s dick. He was letting out noises that Dean had never heard before, and Dean wanted to hear them as much as he could. Mr. Novak’s hands wandered down his body and he grabbed the back of Dean’s thigh; he lifted his hips up and onto his ass. Dean clutched Mr. Novak’s shoulders tighter and threw his head back. Mr. Novak took this as an invitation to lick his exposed neck.
This was Dean’s daughter.
“Dean, wait,” Castiel said. He reached out and grabbed at Dean’s shoulder to stop him. The violent way that Dean jumped away from him made something unpleasant sour Castiel’s inside. He stood there, in shock, stock still, as he looked at the pained grimace that went over Dean’s face.
He knew that most of these people were Germans. He didn’t feel threatened by them, though. Since he knew that this deal was something they needed in order to get more clientele. They better know what they were talking about because Castiel had 0 patience right now and his mind was preoccupied by the thoughts of his former lover.
. Which was followed by a screech of her friends.
The phone buzzed in his hand. A message came through followed closely by a picture.
They didn’t say anything. They just walked up the stairs and into their respective bedrooms, where Dean curled up next to his daughter and fell asleep; feeling calm knowing that she was safe with him. He knew that he had to speak with Mr. Novak about his personal life. If these people knew about his daughter, he had to make sure that she was safe. And if it meant exposing her to Mr. Novak and his people, then so be it.
BUT I do hope that you won't stop reading/enjoying the story because of it.
But Castiel’s path up the stairs was a hard one. As soon as someone noticed that it was actually him making his way up the stairs, he was being surrounded by the press. Charlie squeaked and shuffled closer to him, clutching his arm in a tight grip. Castiel’s jaw clenched as his men started to push the reporters away from him so he could enter the house without further interruptions. They kept yelling questions at him, wanting details about how he survived and who had attempted to blow up his house in order to kill him. And who was with him right now, was it a new love interest? Has he suddenly gone straight, without letting them know about it? He didn’t answer to any of these questions. Instead, he quickly made his way up the straight, with Charlie close to him. Once inside, the doors closed behind them with a bang.
He missed having him around. He missed him for the fact that he could easily calm him down right now. But now he was on his own. And he couldn’t calm himself at all. The only way he could do it was to find Dean and put all of this behind them.
It felt amazing. Their bed was steadily getting wet from their sweat, and they haven’t even started to have sex. This was just a foreplay, and as much as Dean wanted to drag this out, he also wanted Mr. Novak’s dick inside him.
“Thank you, sir,” the waiter left their table in such a hurry that Castiel was impressed he didn’t trip.
“Where are they?” Sam Winchester’s voice was panicked in his ear. There were voices in the background that Castiel didn’t recognize. “If you have anything to do with this. If you did anything to them, I swear to you Novak, you won’t come out of this alive.”
, but his head was clouded by the feelings he was experiencing right now.
“Dean,” Castiel started again.
“I don’t know,” Castiel replied. Deep down, he had his doubts; he knew that he had a bad luck. He didn’t know where it came from, but he knew that he had a bad luck. People he cared about always wound up hurt, or worse for wear.
“I don't know the details yet.”
Dean's cheeks heated up at that, but Mr. Novak only smirked at him and made his way out of the bedroom. Dean moved his hand to grope at his dick, but Mr. Novak's cut through the air sharply.
’s cakes.”
“Fuck,” Dean breathed out and he wiggled around on the bed.
“There are things, in my life, that I won’t be able to share with you,” Castiel said, still looking down at their hands. “My soul, and essentially, heart, is yours. It will be on a limited access, but I will share some stuff with you. My body, however, it’s…” he let out a shaky breath and shook his head. “My body is something different. And I don’t want to corrupt you with it. I say my soul is yours,” Castiel explained. “Because I can control the information that I’d want to share with you. My body is something that I can’t control, if you’ll see what I see every day; be it in the mornings or at night.” He took another steadying breath, and said, “So that’s why I need to put up this barrier between us.”
The path that took him back was filled with flower beds on either side of them, and lights that prevented him from stumbling his way around here. He rounded the corner and up the stairs, and into the house. There were some people here as well, having quiet conversations between one another, drinking their expensive alcohols. Dean tipped back his glass and drunk it all. Placing the glass down at the nearest table, Dean took the stairs up to the second floor for the bathroom.
This was possibly the most dangerous act they were doing right now, kissing like this in a public place, but Dean didn’t care. If someone was going to kill them, then he’d die with the man that made him feel things that no one really managed to arouse in him.
),” she whispered. Castiel didn’t reply to her.
“Thank you,” Castiel shook his hand quickly and turned to leave, but Kevin held on to his arm to stop him. Castiel looked at him.
Dean nodded and turned to walk away. He grabbed his T-shirt from the couch, since he had to take it off for her. He slowly put it on, wincing as the fabric grazed his back, but he kept walking. When he was out of there, he quickly made his way through the apartment, and out the front door. The elevator couldn’t come up fast enough for him to get out of here.
“You’re gonna love this,” Dean as he presented it to Mr. Novak’s lips. He grabbed Dean’s hand and bit down into it. His eyes closed and he moaned as the first taste hit him.
She shook her head, her hair bouncing around her frame. “No. I just wanted to sleep with daddy.”
“Fifteen minutes ago,” Crowley said as he opened the door for Castiel.
“This is
The doors slid open into a spacious office that had dimmed down lights. The sofas were in burgundy colors, rich leather that Castiel liked feeling on his skin, whenever he preferred to relax in his undershirt. He preferred to be left alone in here, but there was already someone waiting for him there.
The other side went quiet. Castiel frowned and looked at his phone to see if Sam was still on the line. Once Castiel was sure that he was, he placed the phone back to his ear and heard some muffled voices from Sam’s side. Castiel’s frown deepened as he heard Jessica’s hysterical voice say something, but Castiel couldn’t hear a word of it.
He stored that thought for later. Right now, he was leaning forward, just as Castiel hoisted himself up a bit and leaned over the counter to kiss Dean on the lips. Dean returned the kiss. Surprised, sure. Since he didn’t know it was going to happen so soon and so fast, but he returned the kiss nevertheless. Castiel’s lips looked chapped, but they were soft and plum and Dean lifted his hands to his face and ran his fingers over the light stubble that Castiel had. Dean moved his head to the side and deepened the kiss, while Castiel kept pulling him closer by his shirt. They both moved the glasses to the side, surprisingly without breaking anything, and Dean went over the counter and sat on it, by Castiel’s side. He wrapped his legs around Castiel’s waist and pulled him in closer, without breaking their kiss. Castiel places both of his hands on Dean’s thighs and squeezed them tight and sure.
“Do you really think so?” she asked, looking excited and anxious all at once.
“Lor-“ Castiel frowned, but he was silenced as she said, “Well, I’ll go to bed now. Good night!” She hugged Dean again, and he returned it. And then she went to her bedroom, shutting the door after her. Castiel looked after her, at the closed door, a warm feeling in his chest. Lost in thought, he hadn’t realized that he was being dragged to the doors in the hallway, and Dean was asking him something.
When Castiel woke up the next morning, he spent a few moments in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Quickly, he got up and put on his T-shirt and sweatpants. He turned around to look at Dean, who was still asleep. Castiel swallowed around the lump in his throat, and waited for the regret to set in; the hatred he would surely feel against himself for doing this to Dean…
