“She looks good,” Bruce says as he finishes up the examination on Sarah. He smiles sweetly at the little girl and fishes into his pocket for a lollipop. Her blue eyes widen in surprise and she accepts the piece of candy.
“Hold on.” Steve holds up a hand to silence anymore rambling. “Your Uncle Buck has taken you to train?”
It had been a while since the whole team had come together. Every major holiday and birthday was always celebrated as a family. For so long Peter had wanted his family together, and now he finally had it.
“Twelve hours,” Steve replies and he smiles sheepishly when he catches Tony staring. “The serum helps me heal. I thought I mentioned that.”
“No it is! I swear. He never told you-well, he tried but you didn’t listen. It’s all right here!” Peter quickly removes his backpack and digs through it until he finds the letter. He holds up for his dad to see. “He left this for you.”
Sensing his mate’s urgency, Steve reaches between them to take the alpha’s cock into his hands, stroking the hard flesh and emitting another moan from the man above him. “Does it feel good?” Steve asks, a little unsurely.
The tears are flowing down Tony’s face, and this time he doesn’t bother wiping them away. He has to fight the urge to crash his fist through the screen. He screams in frustration and throws the mug instead.
“Oh then in that case.” Happy has no problem turning over the bags. “It’s about time you get used to carrying someone else’s things. Pretty soon you’re gonna have a diaper bag around your shoulder.”
Steve grumbles some kind of morning greeting and shuffles into the kitchen. Tony side eyes him, watching as he takes the vitamins and then the tea. He comes over and Tony snaps his attention back to his tablet, pretending that his focus was on his work the whole time.
He’s still crying and Morgan has to block out the noise with music and her headphones. She spends the rest of the afternoon in her room, hopeful that her dad will be home soon.
“Honey?” Tony calls out when he enters the bedroom again. Steve has just finished nursing Morgan and he’s in the middle of burping her. She squirms in his lap, clearly not fond of the position he has her in. “You got it?” Tony asks, coming closer to step in and help.
“Screw that guy,” Tony says and Steve peers up at him. “He’s a liar. Whatever he told you was all bullshit. That thing about him blaming you for the pups…” Tony stops himself when he sees how shiny Steve’s eyes have gotten. “Don’t listen to him. You’re free now. He’s gone.”
From where he’s sitting he can still hear the soft music playing in the background and the laughter and voices from the team. He wishes he could be a part of them, but the voice in his head reminds him that he never will be. He chose to walk away from everyone and leave behind the only family he had.
“He’s a good guy,” Tony says and gestures for Peter to follow him to the kitchen where he has an array of takeout waiting for them on the island. “I wasn’t sure what you wanted so I ordered a bit of everything. Plus you’re a growing kid so…”
“He’s beautiful,” Tony says from his spot beside Steve. He leans down to press a kiss to Steve’s head. “I’m so proud of you, honey.”
“Morning,” Peter mumbles out a reply and sits down at the table where his plate of scrambled eggs and toast are waiting for him. Peter picks up at his fork to move the eggs around.
“Hey, it’s okay. And I know you’re happy about her. Do you know why?” Tony asks and when Steve shakes his head, Tony continues, “because you told me. Remember all the times you were excited about her? When we first found out; when you first felt her move; when you first held her. I know you’re happy to have her.”
“I like that he’s like you. He’s smart, funny, caring. He’s ready to put everyone else before himself. He made one mistake. We can’t condemn him for that. Especially when we did the exact same thing.”
“Dammit, Tony,” Steve sighs. He glares at his phone when it refuses to ring. Tony was usually pretty good about picking up. But when he was tied up in a meeting-like he was now-getting him to answer the phone was impossible.
“I like it here. But what about you? You’re just gonna pack up and leave Manhattan?” Steve asks, searching the alpha’s face for any indication that he would be against the idea of moving.
Beside him, a choked sob can be heard and Tony’s head snaps in the direction of his husband. Steve has his head resting against the wall, finally giving Tony a view of his tear streaked face.
Tony rolls his eyes. Of course Steve’s reaction to the dog on their bed would differ from his own. It wasn’t surprising, but it was annoying.
“Yeah,” Tony eventually answers and comes closer, deciding to stay near the edge of the bed to avoid disrupting the little nest Steve has prepared. “Just working. Listen, I want to apologize. I never should’ve let him in.”
With his visibility compromised, he slams into a hard mass, only to discover too late that it was one of the traders. He loses the grip on his shield and it hits the ground. Before Steve can recover it, a fist is colliding with his jaw and sending him back into one of the walls.
The moment Tony is gone and the door is shut, a heavy silence hangs in the air. Steve can feel eyes on him and when he turns, he locks his gaze with Happy’s.
Tony grunts loudly when Steve clenches tightly around him. He increases the movement of his hips, chasing after his own release. He’s so close.
“Honey, I don’t know. Maybe you need to think it over some more,” Tony says and reaches for Steve’s hand. Steve slips his free.
I feel so terrible for Peter. He thought he could trust Tony and have a relationship with him. At least he still has the rest of his family.
The shaky breath that escapes Steve doesn’t go unnoticed, nor does the tears that are beginning to roll down his face. Tony lets out a sigh and reaches for Steve’s hand, only for Steve to move away.
Steve slides the rest of his finger inside and thrusts gently. Tony’s jaw slacks and his head falls between his shoulders. He grunts from the intrusion, and takes a second to remind himself that eventually the pain transitions to pleasure.
“Holy shit. Steve, what the hell-” Tony tries to ask, only to be cut off when Steve lets out a small scream. He’s never seen Steve like this before and it terrifies him. “What happened?”
“I used to think that. And then I lost my best friend and now his son is suffering. I don’t want that for our kids, Sam. Do you know how hard it would be for them if they lost you or me or both of us?”
“This is real right?” Steve asks and he glances at all of his friends. “You’re all really here and I have…” he trails off and his eyes meet Harley’s sleeping face. “I really have him?”
The rest of the night is restless for them both. Steve is getting up every few hours to vomit and Tony is there to take care of him. Eventually Steve catches a break and it’s a little past three by the time he’s drifting off to sleep.
“Pregnancy brain.” Pepper chuckles and she reaches out to gently rub Steve’s shoulder. “You should come back to the party. I’m sure Tony’s missing you.”
“She’s here.” Happy smiles and gently lays the newborn over her father’s chest. She takes her first breath, and the car fills with the sound of her cries. Happy quickly shrugs off his suit jacket to place it over her tiny form.
The lock on the door breaks through the quiet, forcing Tony to lift his head in its direction. He prays they’re not back to inflict more damage. He had been promised death, and if it meant them leaving Steve alone for a while, then Tony would take it.
Peter must be sensing his father’s frustration because it only increases his own. He’s screaming now to the point where his little face is red and contorted in distress. Steve gets up from the chair, deciding to walk around the room with his son. It doesn’t help.
She cried and fussed, refusing to be consoled. Tony pushed through it, reminding himself that it was just the two of them now. Morgan was going to need him more than ever.
He follows the laughter until he’s standing outside Morgan’s room. A majority of her belongings are already packed away and ready to be placed in the moving truck come tomorrow morning. Steve had made sure to keep her favorite toys unpacked and the blanket she curled up in every night.
“You to wake me up with more than just kisses. You can keep going.” Tony brings Steve back for another kiss and then tries pushing his head down, but Steve easily overpowers him and breaks free completely from Tony’s grasp.
Pepper sighs and leans in closer to get another look at the cut and bruises on Tony’s face. “How much did you drink again? Do you even remember anything?”
“But you didn’t have to yell. Oh and then you got mad over the laundry, and the living room being a mess, and the conference call I had to take.”
“I’m going to move her.” Steve is careful when he picks Morgan up, smiling at her when she blinks her eyes open. “Hi, baby girl. I’m home now.”
The party was meant to celebrate their victory. They had saved the world again and to commemorate the win, Tony threw the team and a few guests a party. Tony was used to opening up his tower and hosting these types of events. Though usually the parties he threw were meant to recognize his accomplishments, this one was strictly for the team.
“He’ll be fine.” It’s Tony who answers. He honestly has no idea what kind of issues they’re looking at when it comes to their son, but he wasn't about to worry Steve. They needed to stay calm.
Happy is still in his original place. The annoyed expression on his face has vanished, leaving in its place the stern one he likes to use to make himself look tougher. It was one he used frequently around alphas to show that he was just as, and if not more, tough as they were.
She reminds him of someone very special to him. The hair on her head is something she inherited from him, but it’s also a trait that was passed down from his own mother.
“It’s okay.” Steve carefully reaches out for the little boy and much to his delight, his son doesn’t pull away. “It’s only me. I won’t hurt you.”
Tony hadn’t said where they were going. Steve isn’t sure if he’s supposed to dress nice or if their outing would be more casual. It’s not just the lack of details that’s making Steve nervous. He’s not sure how this works anymore.
“Hey,” Steve’s voice takes on that soothing tone he likes to use when Tony needs calming. Tony can’t ignore it, nor can he pull away when Steve takes his hands. “This is a lot to take in, I know. But it’s exciting. We’re having a baby.”
Peter pauses again, frowning as he tries to come up with a proper response. He knows his father can’t hear him, but he likes to believe that maybe he still does. Maybe his father is looking down on him, still wearing that same smile he always wore whenever Peter talked to him.
“Are you sure you’re not...I mean, you’re crying like Tony did last week when you made him a sandwich and forgot the mustard. Have you tried taking a test?”
“I’m not lying. You’re beautiful, Tony.” Steve smiles and kisses Tony again, then he’s lowering himself until he’s at eye level with Tony’s belly and he places a kiss there too. “You’re so beautiful like this. We should’ve done this a long time ago.”
He pulls off and takes the other nipple into mouth to give it the same treatment. His own cock hardens in response to the noises Steve makes and he keeps sucking to provoke more of those sounds. Steve is writhing underneath him, fighting against the cuffs that Tony knows won’t crack.
“It does. I wish I did more. I wish I listened better. You’re in pain and I...I did nothing. You’re here because of me and...I’ll never forgive myself. If I lost you-” A broken sob escapes Tony and he hangs his head again.
Tony smiles and leans in to give his son another kiss. He remembers when it used to be Steve he was kissing goodnight, but that was all in the past now.
“This is your fault,” he points his finger angrily at the screen. “It’s not just mine and I’m tired of taking it all. Why didn’t you tell me?”
I swear there’s going to be some sexy times for him and Tony. And of course them finding their forever home. I still have a lot planned for them 😊
“Mama, play!” Peter breaks free from Steve’s arms so that he can crawl off the omega and lower himself onto the floor.
“This is what’s right. It’s hard, and believe me I wish I could bring you home right now...but this is going to work. This is going to help you.”
Peter runs into the hall, only to stop when he hears someone call out to him. He ignores the familiar voice and dashes into the bathroom. Before he can hide in one of the stalls, someone is running after him and gripping him tightly by the shoulder, forcefully turning him around.
He doesn’t visit the apartment Steve has run off to for the past few years. He promised he wouldn’t intervene. He at least owes Steve that much.
“I can’t do this.” Tony shakes his head and turns away to hide the sob that threatens to tear from his throat. He takes a moment to gather himself before turning back to face the statue. “Why?” He finally has the courage to confront Steve. It was a shame it was too late. “Why didn’t you fucking tell me? That night at the stupid party…”
This time Steve glances up to meet Tony’s eyes, shooting him a small smile. “We’ll be okay. I think I’m getting the hang of this.”
The blue eyes he’s looked into since as long as he could remember were shut, robbing Peter of another chance to stare into them. The hand that he had been squeezing lies limply off the table.
“Wait.” Tony reaches out to take Steve’s hands. He holds them tightly, forcing Steve to stop wringing them so anxiously. “Wait. I know we’ve been good right now, but that’s now. What about later? What if I-what if we can’t keep this up? I don’t want to hurt you or Pete. I don’t.”
“Hey, kiddo!” Tony greets and goes in for a hug. It’s awkward, but it leaves Peter feeling warm inside nonetheless. He turns toward his friend. “Thanks, Happy.”
“Probably. But we haven’t discussed if we want to know or…” Tony trails off and Steve nods his head. They’ll wait.
The uneasy looks don’t go unnoticed. Sam does his best to ignore them, but it’s difficult when he’s just as nervous about his husband’s behavior.
The hot water against his skin burns, forcing him to grit his teeth and hiss through it. He doesn’t adjust the temperature, instead letting it run along his sore muscles. Steve leans forward, resting his forehead against the tile wall of the shower and hunching his back. His eyes fall shut.
“I doubt that. Listen, tomorrow I’ll pick you up from school and introduce you to more than just Jarvis.”
“Can I come?” Peter asks, jutting out his bottom lip and staring at Steve with his best puppy dog eyes. It works every time.
Tony feels worse. All he had to do was pick up the damn phone and call Steve back. It was as simple as that.
Happy chuckles softly. “Believe me, kid, I know. I’m having to throw them out. Hopefully I won’t have to throw out that boyfriend of yours.”
“Sir?” The tone of FRIDAY’S voice is off. It’s alarming, making his stomach twist into uncomfortable knots.
“T-Tony,” Steve whimpers, a moan slipping past his lips when the alpha grazes his teeth along the mark. Steve’s body shudders and he moans. “Please, alpha.”
Steve scoots closer until he’s pressed up against Tony’s side, and he reaches out to gently brush his fingers along Morgan’s face. For a moment, Tony believes Steve is okay, but his calm demeanor disappears faster than it arrived. He curses all of a sudden and moves away, startling Tony.
They would all rotate during the night and take turns whenever Peter woke up. But despite the extra help Steve had, he was still utterly exhausted. Having a baby was hard.
Steve forces himself to his feet, ignoring the orders from medical staff telling him to take it easy. He turns himself around, relying on the bed to steady himself.
He’s also small. So small in fact Tony fears he might drop him. He’s never held a baby before, let alone one as tiny as Peter. But despite his small form, he fits perfectly in the crook of Tony’s arm. It’s like he’s meant to be there.
“Two years. I guess I thought it couldn’t happen. Even when strange things began to happen...I didn’t want to get my hopes up.”
“What?” Steve glances up from his untouched breakfast. The eggs and bacon weren’t appeasing that morning. His morning sickness was beginning to taper off now that he was closing in on his second trimester, but this morning he felt off. He blames another restless night.
Tony helps more, too. With Steve finally giving him an opportunity to help with feedings, he’s able to relieve Steve for a while. It’s difficult to get up throughout the night, but he ignores the exhaustion and cares for his daughter. He wishes he had done more before, but he was doing it now.
Steve glances down at his daughter and then up to his mate. That’s when he notices the metallic red covering Tony’s right hand.
“No but it confuses the hell out of me. How is he so happy! You should’ve seen the way his face lit up when he saw me.”
Morgan’s cries taper down until they’re nothing more but soft whimpers. Steve is still talking to her as he paces around the room with her cradled in his arms. She never takes her eyes off of his.
“It’s fine,” Bucky assures and stands. Sam eyes him closely and Bucky frowns. “I’m not going to hurt him. He’s right. We’ve all made mistakes.”
The day starts off normal enough. Steve wakes before the sun to get to his morning workout, punches a few bags until he’s broken a sweat, then returns back to the penthouse and sets up coffee for his still sleeping boyfriend. He purposely waits on a shower, hoping Tony would join him and they start the day right.
Steve leans in and Tony follows until their lips are meeting again. Steve rests his hands on Tony’s shoulders, letting them slide down to Tony’s chest and playing with the buttons of his shirt. Tony has to stop him from going any further and Steve pulls back with a frown.
“Tony,” he starts and Tony glances up at him. It’s easy to get lost in his dark eyes. Steve’s lost count of how many times he enjoyed just staring into them. They brought him comfort. They made him feel home.
Yay I’m finally updating this one! Sorry that I got stuck. Endings are hard for me and since this one is close to wrapping up, I panicked and struggled to come up with the next chapter. It’s all coming together now...I think.
Tony inhales sharply and drives off. “I don’t know. I don’t know if I believe in that sort of stuff.”
“So good, baby.” Tony licks his lips clean and releases Steve’s spent cock. He knows his boyfriend will be ready to go in a minute.
The spare bedroom in Steve’s apartment never had much to begin with; only a small desk, a book shelf, and a few painting easels. It was a space he found trouble filling up, having grown up used to living in a home that could only fit essential items.
“What?” Steve turns around from the sink to glance at his husband. “I thought you were going with us?”
Peter is up before the sun. He had never been this way before-if he could sleep in late than he would-but ever since his papa had started allowing him on his morning runs, Peter’s grown accustomed to the early schedule.
“Which reminds me…” Tony sits up straighter and groans from the pain that shoots up his back. “Junior here is pressing on my bladder so…”
“I’m sure he’ll be able to smell it. Just don’t tell him anything. I’ll be fine. I’ve been through these alone before.”
Peter relaxes and he opens his eyes again. He doesn’t voice his complaints and remains silent while Steve gets him ready to head down to the medbay.
But Steve isn’t in any harm. In fact, he’s never looked so at peace. He smiles tiredly when he enters the penthouse and shuffles over to where Tony is feeding their youngest on the sofa.
Steve shoots his husband a sympathetic smile and leans forward in his chair, taking Tony’s hand and giving it a reassuring squeeze. “You’re doing good, Tony. Peter will be here soon and you’ll see how it was worth it, how beautiful.”
Stepping down was the best choice. He would’ve done it a long time ago, but he needed to keep his son safe. Peter was older now, knew how to take care of himself. He still needed his father for some things, but pretty soon Peter would be all grownup and moving on with his life.
Steve doesn’t offer the baby in his arms. It feels selfish to not want to allow his friends to hold his son, but they’d understand why he’d be so hesitant. Harley was never supposed to have happened, and by some miracle he was here and sleeping peacefully in Steve’s arms. Steve never wanted to let him go.
“We just started,” Steve explains and he slides over the file he had been going over. Tony leans forward to take a peek. “A new AIM research facility has appeared on our radar. It’s worth looking into.”
It wasn’t just Peter that was struggling. Tony couldn’t figure out what his next costume should be. He didn’t want a repeat of previous years and he definitely wasn't taking Steve’s suggestion and using his Iron Man suit. He needed something good. Something different.
Tony scans the machines and the wires, feeling slightly overwhelmed by it all. He didn’t want to screw up and his son forced to suffer even more. His frustration must be evident because the beta woman is coming closer and assisting with getting Peter free.
Steve takes Tony’s hands and brings him close again. Tony inhales the sweet scent Steve gives off; it only makes the urge to mate stronger. His alpha side demands he take the omega and make him his.
They don’t speak to each other very much after that. Steve departs immediately to his son’s room to organize and Happy disappears to the living room. Not much needs to be done in Peter’s room since the space was only going to be used temporarily, but Steve can’t help but go through each item and find them a home.
Tony has Jarvis play back the surveillance of him coming home after the party. He’s seen it multiple times already and every time he was left feeling confused and without answers.
His eyes grow watery at the ones he couldn’t save and the one he came close to saving. He remembers all of them; he always will. He can still picture their faces before they were ripped away and never to be seen again. He spent more time with Sarah; it made him feel guilty. He should’ve been able to hold all of them the way he held her.
“Guess you’re tired of being in there, huh?” Steve pokes at his belly, chuckling softly when his daughter responds with a kick.
“Okay…” Peter glances down at his barely touched breakfast. He can almost hear his papa telling him to eat. He hated when food was wasted, probably because he grew up with barely anything. Peter sighs and gathers a bit of egg on his fork.
Clint doesn’t hesitate and he scans his badge, and the door opens, revealing a medium sized room furnished with a single bed and bright lights hanging from the ceiling. Steve instantly notices the three figures huddled on the bed.
“Let him in, J. I’ll go get him,” Tony tells the A.I. then he turns to Steve. “Have a seat. I’ll be back.”
The first thing Tony does is pour himself a glass of scotch. There were emails that still needed to be read and replied to, but he saves them for tomorrow. He was exhausted.
Poor Peter 😔 Don’t worry Ned and his parents will find out soon. I’m still figuring out who the father is but I’m leaning toward one person 🤔 Anyway, I hope you all are enjoying this one 😊
Well, maybe not as well as he thought. His body wasn’t perfect like he used to think. It could still be harmful.
“Just what?” Tony asks, his eyes narrowing in Flash’s direction. “The door was closed. It’s suspicious.”
James nods his head slowly and Steve scoops him up in his arms and carries him over to where the rest of the family are situated. Tony glances up, smiling at his mate and then at his oldest son.
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve moans and thrusts up. Tony takes more of him into his mouth, filling the room with lewd sounds. Steve curses when his cock hits the back of Tony’s throat and tips his head back. He was going to come soon.
“In here!” Steve’s voice rings out. Tony glances up at the stairs and makes his way up, loosening his tie as he ascends.
But none of those things were going to happen. Steve was dead. There would be no marriage and children. There would be no more avenging Earth and all of its occupants. His superhero days were over.
He truly was a monster that deserved to feel the pain he was feeling. He deserved to live with the guilt for the rest of his life. He deserved to have nothing.
Natasha lips curl into a smirk. Tony knows her next response is just going to be like the others before it. She was trying to make him feel guilty. And damn it, it was working.
Steve growls and stalks toward the alpha, crowding him against the bar and gripping him tightly by the front of his suit, slamming his body hard into the wooden surface. The alpha reaches for something on the bar, a small blade, but Steve is faster and grips the alpha’s wrist, twisting until he’s forced to let go and the blade falls to the floor and Steve kicks it to the side.
So when Sam gathers both Peter and Bucky into the living room, he silently prays that their talk goes smoothly. He keeps his fingers intertwined with Bucky’s, squeezing his hand gently to offer assurance. Bucky nods, affirming that he knows to keep cool.
“Steve!” Bucky calls out to his son, only to go ignored. He grumbles in annoyance, more so with the fact that he can’t chase after his son like he used to. The gentle kicks from inside his womb remind him of that.
Steve rips the page from his book and neatly folds the piece of paper, and puts it securely in his belt.
Peter is in a better mood once he’s eaten. After that, the rest of the day is spent playing any game Peter could think of. They run around the apartment, playing their own version of the Avengers-Bucky isn’t even mad when he’s asked to be the villain, but he does make sure to punish his nephew with a round of tickling-then, they’re winding down and watching a movie inside their blanket fort.
“I can’t risk it, Tony, I can’t. I’d never forgive myself if I hurt that little girl. Please. Let me go. Let me get better.”
I swear revenge is coming! I got help for some painful ideas 😈 Pierce deserves to suffer just like Steve, right? It’s only fair 🤷♀️
“Steve, you’re going to be fine. Trust me. You’re going to fit in, and you’ll be a wonderful mother.”
The drying stimulation appears to be working, a pink flush is spreading across the baby’s skin. Tony rubs the towel a little harder over the baby’s body, catching sight of the way his son’s face begins to scrunch up. Then finally, a small whimper can be heard.
“Still sleeping. Being born must be exhausting,” Steve chuckles. It was exhausting for both of them. Steve was ready to shut his eyes and drift off himself.
He understands now what his body is trying to tell him. He’s going into a rut. He can’t remember the last time he’s even had one. Between running a successful company and creating new tech, it made sense that his cycle would be off. And if he did have one, it was always spent locked away in his penthouse. Spending ruts alone was not ideal, but it wasn’t like Tony had a mate to share it with. He was a busy man. He didn’t have time to settle down.
Peter glances at his parents, silently pleading for them to just let Flash go. But it’s obvious they wanted Flash to stay.
Tony runs a hand through his disheveled hair, blowing out a breath of air and turning his head in Steve’s direction. Steve is staring up at the ceiling. It’s difficult to read him, and for a moment Tony wonders if Steve had been thinking the same thing.
He doesn’t bother to tell Steve where he’s going; he can shoot him a text once he gets there. He doesn’t even know if Pepper is available for a drop in visit like this, but he needs someone to talk to. He needs a break from the chaos.
“Let me stop you there. He needs me to back off and let him breathe. I screwed everything up. Honestly I don’t blame him for not wanting to be around me. I practically murdered Steve-” Tony pauses, blowing out a heavy breath. Who knew those words could hurt to say.
Steve chuckles softly and ducks his head down to peck Tony on the lips. He moves quickly to grab the lube and shed his shirt. Tony’s eyes are immediately drawn to his torso. Steve follows his gaze, brows furrowing at the small bump he finds. He doesn’t want to worry himself when it was just a little weight gain.
They both struggle to switch the babies, and after a few failed attempts, Tony lets out a frustrated sigh.
“They’d hurt me. Everyday they would take turns beating me. And if that didn’t work, I’d get locked inside this room…” Steve pauses to take a breath, hating how shaky it comes out. His eyes burn with tears and he has to squeeze them shut.
Steve smiles down at his boyfriend and threads his fingers through Tony’s hair. “I think he likes the name,” Steve says, when he feels a kick from within his womb. Tony feels it too and he nods his head in agreement.
Steve catches movement on his right, growling out a warning when the bigger alpha gets too close. His warning goes ignored. With his focus entirely on the other alpha, Brock rushes toward him. Steve turns just in time and stabs the knife into his shoulder. The alpha cries out and stumbles back, gripping his wounded arm.
“Need help?” A familiar voice reaches Steve’s ears and he snaps his head up. Tony is lingering in the doorway of the bedroom, an amused grin plastered over his face.
Tony hums in response and his eyes flutter shut, the exhaustion taking over. “Yeah. Congrats, honey.”
“And so am I. Cap, I’m done. I’m getting older and honestly this crap is just weighing me down. It’s just a little break.”
Steve is sure the topic of marriage isn’t going to be brought up again...until Bucky calls out to him and asks, “Who’s gonna be your best man?”
There’s no response; it’s worrisome. Tony knocks again, assuming he hadn’t been heard the first time. Then he hears it. The sob is small, almost as if Steve was trying to conceal it. But Tony’s picked up on the sound and he turns the knob.
He holds onto hope that one day he’ll glance in the mirror and be happy with what he finds. It was going to take time and a lot of care before then. And he was grateful he had his mate and children by his side.
Some days his phone alerts him of new messages from his dad, but Peter can’t bring himself to read any of them. He ignores the phone calls too.
The pain’s getting worse, making it impossible to do anything but stay where he is. He’s panicking, suddenly wishing Tony was with him or at least one of his teammates.
“Uncle Sam!” Peter cries out and tries to hug his uncle, only to pull away when Sam groans. “Sorry! I’m so sorry!”
But now, just hours away from meeting his little boy, Tony was doubting himself. He never doubted his abilities as an inventor because it was something he was good at. He didn’t even know if he was capable of being a good father.
“Uh-oh. Hormones again?” Sam grins and comes down the stairs to join his friend. He sits down next to Steve. “What’s going on, man?”
Peter turns his head away and rolls his eyes again. The door opens and Peter sits up a little straighter, his heart ready to burst from his chest.
“Not just any sunglasses,” Tony explains and opens the case. He takes out the pair and hands them to Peter. “Put them on.”
“Hey!” Tony reaches out and wraps red fingers around Peter’s wrist. Peter struggles and screams to be let go, but Tony holds his ground. “Stop! Peter, listen to me!”
“We’ll see okay? Papa needs to get better first. He’s really sad about the baby. Make sure you give him a lot of hugs and kisses. He’s going to need them.”
It only takes a few more hard thrusts until Steve is toppling over the edge, screaming Tony’s name as he comes. Tony fucks him through it, cursing when Steve clenches tightly around him. It’s not long until Tony reaches his own release and comes with Steve’s name rolling off his tongue.
Steve is the first to break the awkwardness that’s surrounded them. He clears his throat and smooths a hand down the front of his shirt. “I...I don’t know what I’m supposed to say after this. Thank you just seems...wrong.”
A fiery pain from between his legs causes him to cry out and he slaps a hand over his mouth, muffling the sound. With his other hand he trails it down between his legs to investigate, finding more of the pup’s head exposed. He keeps his hand there and the other splayed over his mouth to keep any noise he produces discreet.
It’s awkward to be out in public together. Usually, someone was noticing one of them and rushing over to get an autograph or picture. Tony was used to the attention he received whenever he went out, but Steve still struggled.
“Ow!” Tony cries out when Steve slaps him across the back of the head before assisting Flash with the mess.
“Depressing?” Steve cocks his head in confusion. He shakes his head in disbelief. “I don’t understand how it could’ve been. You probably got everything you wanted.”
Peter straightens up from his crouched position to get closer, leaping over the small gap between the two structures to touch the art. He runs his hand over his papa’s face and down to the shield held securely in his papa’s arm. Peter lets his hand linger over the shield, for a moment wondering what it would be like to wield it.
Those three words make Tony’s heart flutter. He’s almost afraid to say them back, but he pushes the fear aside and smiles.
It just wasn’t fair that his papa wouldn’t be there to see any of those things happen. His papa was supposed to be there for his graduation, his first day of college, his college graduation, his wedding, the birth of his future children. His papa was supposed to be there for all of that.
“You can open it later if you want,” Tony says, though he secretly hopes Peter would invite him in and they celebrate like a family.
Peter huffs again and slants in his seat, arms folding over his chest. His eyes drift in the direction of his other uncle, watching as he struggles again and again to get a response. Eventually he gives up.
Bucky flips Sam off before returning to petting his cat. She meows again and rubs herself against his belly, the strange behavior capturing Bucky’s attention. He ignores it, but something tells him he shouldn’t.
“I don’t know what to do. They’re going to make us mate.” Steve’s eyes drift in the direction of the bench, his stomach churning at the thought of having to relive another nightmare.
His body goes lax and his eyes fall shut. He can’t remember the last time he’s felt this at ease. It’s not long until he’s dozing off.
He bangs his fist against the metal door, crying out when the next contraction hits with a vengeance. Anyone standing outside the door would ignore his cries, assuming he was crying out from his punishment.
“I’m happy.” Steve smiles and rubs Dodger’s head, chuckling when Dodger comes closer to rest his head in his lap.
Tony lets out a sigh and rises to his feet. His mind is swarming with thoughts. He can’t stop thinking about Steve’s story and the pain he went through. But the baby currently in Steve’s belly is what Tony can’t fully fathom.
“Shit,” Peter curses when the floor beneath him shakes and he stumbles. There was no way in hell using the walls as his advantage was going to work now; they were crumbling around him.
While Tony finishes dressing Peter, Steve gets a bag packed for him. He stuffs the diaper bag with items he’s sure his son was going to need. A couple hours may not seem like a lot of time, but anything could happen and Steve wanted to be prepared.
He cuddles his son close and kisses the top of his head, purposely letting his lips linger a little longer. Peter purrs softly.
Tony waits for him downstairs, already dressed in a suit Steve had never seen before. Steve’s own suit doesn’t even compare, and for a moment he contemplates changing into something else, but then Tony smiles and his eyes brighten.
Just a heads up this chapter is dark...I feel terrible about writing it and I came really close to deleting it. This story is tagged appropriately but even that doesn’t make me feel better. Here’s another warning. There is a rape scene in this chapter. If you want to skip it please do so. I’ve add the star * to indicate when it starts and when it ends. This was difficult for me to do and now I need to go write something happy and fluffy.
Tony’s brows draw together in confusion. He’s not sure what that has to do with anything. He answers the question anyway. “I guess. I mean my father always gave me hard time about my build but-”
The nausea was finally nearing the end. There were still moments when Tony would feel sick and need to be near the toilet, but it wasn’t as severe as it used to be. The pregnancy was getting easier to handle.
There’s an urge to rush toward him, but Morgan needs attention first and Tony moves to pick her up. He shushes her and rocks her soothingly. It takes a few minutes to get her calm, but eventually her cries are dying down and she grows quiet.
Alexander chuckles. “We need someone like you, Mr. Stark. With your help we could change the world. We just need one thing from you.”
There were still different opinions about their former teammate. Everyone knew where Bucky stood and getting him to sit down and participate in the discussion wasn't simple. But it was something that needed to be done. At least not for them but for their youngest member.
“Maybe he’s not so bad,” Peter says, and with a small laugh adds, “he doesn’t really let you talk though. I was able to get a few words in but he loves talking. He told me to meet him tomorrow so maybe that’s good. I don’t know. I’m nervous and don’t know how to be around him. He’ll love me for me, right?”
“Good.” Steve moves past Tony to get to the fridge. He opens it and pulls out a water bottle. “Glad I was finally able to do one today.”
“Relax. He was safe. I...I got scared okay? I have no idea what I’m doing and he’s just so...so...happy.”
“Good. And I know you probably like the sweatshirt-” Tony starts and Steve’s face heats up. “-but I think I can get you something better. How do you feel about shopping? I’m only asking because the clothes Happy brought are probably ...how do I lightly put this…”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whimpers. He’s calm now, all thanks to Tony. The pups have gone back to bed after Tony’s calmed them down enough. Steve, still unable to sleep after his terrifying nightmare, remains wide awake, too afraid to attempt sleep. He whimpers again and pulls his knees up to his chest, closing himself off.
When Tony comes home after another boring day at SI, he’s surprised to find Steve awake and lounging on the sofa. He’s not even aware that Tony’s walked through the front door. He’s deep in thought as he works in his sketchbook. Tony never thought he’d see Steve pick it up again.
Ned nods. He’s still frowning but luckily doesn’t say anything else. They part ways and Peter immediately heads to the nearest bathroom. He makes sure it’s clear before locking himself in the last stall and vomiting the bit of toast he consumed that morning.
During his first appointment, Steve finds himself alone. He had wanted his friends to tag along with him, but he kept it to himself, wanting to see what it really felt like going to these things alone and if he was capable of doing it. He wasn’t.
“Daddy, what is it?” Sarah asks sweetly. She holds her doll close to her chest, blue eyes bright with excitement.
But like Steve had feared, their quiet moment is ripped away from them the second the door unlocks. Steve tenses in response and whimpers against Tony’s neck, feeling the vibrations under the skin when the alpha growls in warning.
The bump wasn’t very big yet and under clothing it was practically invisible, but Peter knew it was still there. He’s caught himself staring at his reflection longer than usual after showering or getting dressed. Pretty soon he wouldn’t be the only one noticing the bump. It was a terrifying thought.
“It’s good for me.” Tony shrugs and takes another sip from his mug. “Oh come on stop looking at me like that. One cup won’t kill me.”
“Good.” Sam pats Steve on the back. “Now come on. I’m sure Tony is wondering where the hell you are.”
“I didn’t...I didn’t think I could...I wasn’t supposed to.” Steve chokes back a sob. He squeezes his eyes shut when the tears threaten to fall. His attempts at keeping them at bay fail and a few are rolling down his cheek.
“This isn’t labor. It’s-” Steve hisses in pain and throws his head back, breathing deeply as he waits for the cramps to diminish. “-it’s not labor,” he says after composing himself. “It’s false. It has to be.”
“I’m so sorry. I know that’s not what you want to hear but I’m sorry.” Sam reaches into his pocket and hands Peter a folded piece of paper. “He wanted you to have this.”
“Stark’s here,” Clint is the first to notify the group, and everyone turns toward Tony and Peter. Clint smiles and pats Tony on the back. “The missing piece has arrived.”
While she waits, Morgan helps herself to a bowl of cereal and lounges in the living room with cartoons playing on the tv. She felt she was too old to be watching them but she can’t help but giggle from the quirkiness every now and then.
It’s not long before he has Steve moaning his name and writhing in pleasure beneath him. Tony fucks into Steve at a steady pace, pulling more moans and curses from his kiss swollen lips. Steve wraps his legs around Tony’s waist, urging him closer and deeper.
Steve huffs out a small laugh and adjusts himself into a sitting position. “I figured. How long have you been here?”
“I always go. Why do you think I bothered to show up to this thing?” Tony questions. Steve doesn’t miss the way his tone turns bitter.
I promise these two are going to talk and Tony can get Steve some help. The team is going to help and be supportive as well. They're not going to let their friend suffer. I have a question: Do you guys like how everything is shown through Tony's eyes or would you like to see some of Steve's perspective? Let me know. Thank you so much for reading!
A part of Steve wants to punch Tony in the face and slam the door, but the other half argues against that idea, reminding him that he had wanted Tony to come back.
Tony stirs in his sleep, a small moan slipping past his lips when Steve continues to trail his lips along his jaw and down to his neck. Steve smirks against his neck and bites, not too hard, but enough to leave a red mark on the unblemished skin.
“Happy! It’s me, Steve.” Steve cringes at his own words. Of course Happy would know who he is. Another contraction decides to hit at this moment and Steve hisses in pain.
Well Steve is doing better and now he can come out from hiding and live his best life. There's only one chapter left but I do have plans for a sequel. They need to live a happy life and have another pup, remember? ;)
“Right.” Tony frowns and brings his coffee cup up to his lips. “Just like the medication.” Those last few words were supposed to have been mumbled against the coffee mug, but it’s clear by the look on Steve’s face that he had heard.
But he made a promise to his son and he was done breaking promises. Peter wanted nothing more than to have his family together while they celebrated and remembered Steve. Tony owes his son a lot. Going to a party was just part of what Tony owed him.
Tony sighs when he goes ignored and the omega storms up the stairs. A door can be heard slamming shut.
“I’ll walk you out,” Peter says and Tony follows, making sure to give Natasha a little wave on his way out. She doesn’t wave back.
Thor smiles, seeming pleased with that answer. Then he frowns. "Why does it have to be a rainy day?"
He shuts the book and tosses it on the coffee table. Steve frowns, and with a huff, leans forward to retrieve the book.
“Yeah, well the feeling is not mutual,” Tony grumbles, making sure to wipe the slobber away on Steve’s shirt.
Steve locks the door and leans against it, both hands coming up to cover his eyes when the tears begin to fall. He releases a sob, his body shaking with each one. It’s a kick from inside his womb that has him calming down. He glances at his belly, and removes a hand from his face to put it over the spot where Peter was kicking.
Tony stumbles back, forgetting how strong his son can be, but he quickly regains himself and smiles. “Hey, kiddo. Sorry I’m late.”
Steve nods again and he turns his attention to Morgan. She’s still awake and playing with her fingers. He smiles and gets down on one knee to be at her level. He reaches for one of her hands, chuckling when she grasps his finger.
“I don’t think he can,” Bucky frowns and offers a hand to his nephew. He pulls Peter up to his feet and pats him gently on the shoulder. “You okay, punk?”
Steve huffs out a laugh and leans closer until they’re lips are brushing against each others. There’s still a part of him that wonders if Tony was up to the idea of them having sex. Just because his energy levels have increased over the past few weeks didn’t mean that he was willing to do it.
The room is nearly silent, all except for the sounds Steve makes while he labors. Bruce is outside of the room, deciding to give them some privacy but still nearby in case he was needed. Steve has given up on moving and finds comfort in the nest he’s created. The soothing scent of his alpha fills his nose every time he takes a deep breath.
Alexander gives a nonchalant shrug and turns to pour himself another drink. He makes another and offers it to Steve.
The doors open and this time the corridor is empty. Heaving a sigh of relief, Tony pushes forward. He keeps the gun raised ahead of him and ducks behind a corner when muffled voices reach his ears. One peek around the corner shows two more alphas and what appears to be a woman in a white lab coat.
He’s no longer standing in the lab of his dad’s tower, but instead he’s on the Quinjet. Peter glances around the space frantically, unable to believe that he’s really back on the jet. He’s quickly reminded that this was an illusion, just a fragment of his memory. All he had to do to end it was take the glasses off, but he can’t bring himself to do it. He yearns to see his papa again.
Tony is jumping out of bed and scrambling around the room in search of shoes. “What’s their ETA?” He asks as he finds his sneakers. He jumps around awkwardly on one foot to slip the first shoe on.
“Hey!” Tony greets, a smile forming over his face. He makes his way into the kitchen and sets down the drinks and bag on the island. “I got pastries and-” Tony looks over the steaming cups. “Two coffees and a chamomile tea. I don’t know if you drink coffee but with the...yeah...I figured tea was better.”
“Thanks,” Tony frowns. “Honestly, you’re right. I should’ve come back. I screwed up. Is that what you want to hear?”
“Then what the hell is it, Steve?” Tony seethes. Steve sighs. Getting his husband upset was the one thing he was trying to avoid.
“You’re not the only one, big guy.” Tony winks and he sits up, forcing Steve to forget about the foot rub.
Peter is curled up on the sofa, fast asleep and snoring softly. Tony peers up from the designs he’s been making for Peter’s suits. The video has stopped playing now and Jarvis hasn’t made an attempt to play it again. Tony abandons his work to clean up the bit of takeout he ordered for them and then to set up Peter’s room.
Steve continued to resemble himself since that night. He smiled more and on occasion he would laugh at something someone said. He was better with Morgan, too. Tony didn’t witness any stressful moments between them anymore.
Morgan decides it was worth a shot. Maybe he wouldn’t mind if it was her waking him up and not the cries of her younger brother.
They walk toward the door and Tony stops. He can’t bring himself to leave. It’s like Steve can sense his hesitation because he’s pulling him close again and connecting their lips. The kiss is familiar; it’s one they share whenever one of them leaves the other. It’s a goodbye kiss with a promise behind it, a promise of them reuniting again.
Steve sucks in a harsh breath and eases off the bag, letting it swing for a moment until he grows tired of the motion and reaches out to stop it. “There was a little smiley face on it so...you get the idea.”
But now he had a new letter and apparently a son. The kid sort of resembled him, if the eyes and dark hair were anything to go by, but Tony still wanted to find a way that didn't tie him to the kid he just met. He didn’t do well with kids. They had never been something he wanted, mostly due to the fact that he didn’t know how to be a father. He didn’t deny that he could be an asshole. Kids and him didn’t mix.
His last attempt had failed and he had been found in these very woods, but he wasn’t going to fail this time.
Bucky rolls his eyes and gets up from the sofa, stretching and groaning when his back pops. “I don’t know about you idiots but I’m starving.”
Peter giggles happily and stretches his arms out for his daddy. Tony takes Peter into his arms and cuddles him close while he talks about his day. It’s Steve’s turn to stare and smile at the scene in front of them.
Peter’s stomach is still churning after he’s made his way through the front doors of his high school. He keeps his gaze down and his hoodie pulled tight over his head to hide the tears that haven’t stopped falling. No one pays him any mind; he was a loser and for once he’s happy about it.
They’re both so lost in each other that they fail to hear the door open. It’s not until someone clears their throat does Sam notice. He curses and shoves Bucky off, earning a glare from his husband when he hits the floor.
“A letter,” Sam says again before shoveling a fork full of eggs into his mouth. Steve can’t help but grimace at the way his friend eats. Has Sam always been like this? “You’re old-fashioned. Just tell him that way.”
“Yes. I know. I’m going to help you. I’ll do whatever it takes to make you feel like yourself again. I promise.”
“As I was saying,” the Director continues, his tone more than enough of a warning, “I’m not your enemy. I wouldn’t have saved your ass if I was.”
Peter’s up again sometime around two thirty. Steve hears him first and groans when he realizes he’s forced to get out of bed again. He sits up and stretches, giving himself a moment to wake up.
But Tony’s not like them and he wants to make Steve comfortable. Sure he was the one going into a rut, but this moment was about Steve and making it special for him. Tony promised he wouldn’t hurt him anymore. He’d show him love. He’d show him how this moment was supposed to be.
There should be a sense of excitement at the thought of getting to see his child for the first time, but Peter can’t seem to grasp any form of excitement over the doctor's appointment.
“You’re being too hard on yourself, sir,” Jarvis says, the sound of his voice snapping Tony from his thoughts. Tony lets out a sigh and slants in his seat. “Perhaps coming out here was a bad idea.”
He still has the rest of his family and maybe his dad, but it’s hard to say. Their first interaction hadn’t gone the way Peter had been hoping. He thought for sure his dad would have been happy to see him. But it was like his dad didn’t even care.
Tony curses when he takes his eyes off the road and on the large numbers of the car stereo. He hadn’t meant to be late. The meeting ran a little longer than usual, but it was making a stop before home that made him late. It had meant to be a quick stop, but it somehow didn’t turn out that way.
Tony tried again to bring Dodger with him while he worked in the lab, but soon gave up when Dodger whined and curled up with Steve on the couch. It didn’t strike them as odd; Dodger was clingy and they assumed he was just wanting to protect Steve and Peter.
Tony smiles and takes Steve’s hand again, bringing it up to his lips and kissing it. “I’ll pick you up at 6.”
“Write him a letter,” Sam says randomly one morning during breakfast. It was well known that Steve’s method of telling Tony about the baby wasn’t cutting it. His friends probably felt sorry for him or thought he was an idiot. Maybe both. Steve definitely felt stupid for not being able to tell the father of his baby that well...he was going to be a father.
He doesn’t see any of his family while he explores the base, and it brings a sense of relief over him. He wouldn’t risk bumping into them and blowing his cover. That voice is back, this time to point out that he was also at risk of being caught by the wrong side. Peter didn’t want to imagine being captured. He’d just have to make sure he didn’t give the bad guys a chance to catch him.
“I’m not scared, Daddy!” Peter cries and he rushes into the kitchen, throwing himself at Tony and giggling when he’s picked up.
Seeing Tony at his door in the middle of the night was the last thing Steve expected. For months he had been trying to reach out to him, only to be ignored and treated like he didn’t exist, like the night they shared together never happened.
The smell of freshly brewed coffee is the first thing Tony gets a whiff of the moment he waddles-yeah, that’s what he’s doing now and he hates it-toward the kitchen. Steve is preparing breakfast and whistling a happy tune that sounds suspiciously like one of his old records.
Steve is at the stove, his back turned as he finishes up the bacon and French toast. Tony doesn’t take his usual seat at the island where Steve has already set up his plate, and instead he comes up behind the omega and wraps his arms around him.
“Honey, relax,” Tony soothes and places both hands over Steve’s shoulders. “You can do this. I know you can.”
Peter’s vision momentarily blurs and he quickly blinks to rid the tears. He sniffs and says, “I don’t know. I...I don’t want to be here. Can’t we just leave his stuff alone?”
Happy Halloween, everyone! Hope everyone is having a safe and fun holiday! This chapter is pretty long I guess, but it is the birth scene so yay! It fits because I don't know what's scarier than hours of labor haha. Maybe it's just me. I did have a hard labor. Anyway, hope you all enjoy it!
Steve’s eyes flutter open, a soft smile forming over his face. He wraps his arms around Tony’s neck and brings him closer, kissing and sucking on the sensitive skin.
Steve rushes over and takes Morgan into his arms, holding her close to his chest and calming her down. “Shh. I’m here, sweetheart. I’ll never leave you again.”
“Damn,” Tony is the first to say. Even if he wanted to move he doesn’t know if he can. His body is completely drained. And also completely satisfied. “I need to let you do that more often.”
Harley grows bored and turns away to explore the new environment. James, the good, obedient one that he is, stays beside Tony.
“About time you showed up. I was ready to leave,” Tony says in a teasing manner. The beta isn’t amused and he rolls his eyes. “I’m kidding. Lighten up.”
“I’ll talk to them,” Peter says and hugs Tony from the side, a smile forming over his face when Tony wraps an arm around his shoulders and they walk out the exit together. “Thank you for being here. I know you didn’t have to.”
“I’ll go with you!” Peter jumps up from his seat. He cowers when another deathly glare is sent his way.
But Steve was the happiest. He had pictured a little girl but now he saw a little boy with Tony’s eyes and dark, curly hair. He couldn’t wait to meet his son.
“I hope I’m not too old for this,” Peter says as he lays the sketch of him and his papa down near the foot of the monument. He drew them dressed as their alter egos, but instead of saving the city together, they’re at the top of a skyscraper in Brooklyn, watching the sun begin to set. It was a reality Peter had been hoping for one day.
Now that he’s refreshed, it’s tempting to go downstairs and find Tony, but he holds off. They didn’t exactly get off on the right foot, not that Steve was really expecting them to. He had revealed his life story and then some to a man he doesn’t know. It didn’t help that that same man was also the father of his baby.
James moves closer to the group, squeezing through his younger siblings so that he could be close to his daddy.
Before Sam can answer, the door to his room is opening and Bucky is stepping through. He doesn’t look any better than the last time Peter had seen him. He still appears worried, and now angry.
Peter winces just at the thought of having to tell both the father and his parents. He already knows his parents would be upset and disappointed. And Flash...well, he wouldn’t step up. He would probably treat Peter worse than he already does. It was better not to say anything.
“It’s not much,” Tony says lamely when they reach the extra bedroom. “I figured it was better than the couch.”
Well they were trying to enjoy themselves but with Tony's hormones and of course Steve's too haha. These two and their bantering. I will update soon! I think it's time for a baby shower!
Steve glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. “No. I want him to have your name...or I don’t know...both? Stark-Rogers works, right?”
The baby was doing good. His skin no longer had that grayish tone and was now flushed and pink, especially around his cheeks. His hair was light, strands of it peeking out from underneath the hat. He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, but Steve had a feeling they would be matching his own.
“Maybe,” Tony mumbles and brings the glass back up to his lips to take another small sip. “What about you?” He asks and Steve stares at him quizzically. “We were trying to get you pregnant. I don’t see you puking your guts out.”
“I...I guess I’d miss them too. Peter is a lot of fun to hang out with and Harley does give the best hugs. Papa loves to draw with me sometimes and he always gives me a kiss everytime he sees me. And dad...I used to think he was too protective and the nicknames were embarrassing but...but I’d miss it.”
The rest of the group gathers around the grave. Tony wraps an arm around his son, bringing him close. Peter glances around at the team, a smile forming over his face now that he was surrounded by the people he loved.
It’s awkward between them. Neither one of them knew how to start the conversation that was overdue. This talk should’ve happened after their son was born-no, before their son. Ever since they split up their relationship had changed. It was Peter who brought them closer, but more needed to be done. It was their turn now to make things right.
The first time Tony heard the voicemails, Tony had to shut them off and never listen to them again. He had done that a couple of times actually. Hearing Steve’s voice ached. It felt like his heart was being squeezed tightly until it was close to bursting.
Steve nods and opens his mouth to speak, but he’s never given the chance. Pepper is pulling him back into her arms and sobbing. All he can do is hold her.
Tony ignores the question, his mind too occupied on the new idea that’s formed. He had been sitting on the project for a while; his motivation had disappeared since his life turned upside down. But now it was coming back and he had to act quickly.
But now as he steps in front of Steve’s grave, the hurt doesn’t even compare. Tony’s eyes burn with unshed tears and he blinks them back, telling himself to keep it together.
Their relationship was rocky and going to take time to grow and hopefully become stable. Peter wanted his dad in the picture. He wanted his family to be together again. He’s sure his papa would’ve wanted the same thing.
Just like the first time, Tony is careful and attentive to Steve’s needs. He doesn’t hesitate to make sure Steve is comfortable before they begin, and again once they start. He holds Steve close, keeping their bodies pressed together while he moves slowly. He only picks up the pace when Steve asks him to.
“Sir…” Jarvis sounds unsure, almost timid to say anything else. Then he finally finds the courage to say, “I’m sorry.”
Tony watches her leave as he takes another drink. The feelings he had for her were strong, but the ones he had reserved for Steve were stronger. It was always going to be Steve.
Anger flashes across Peter’s face and he storms over to Tony, shoving him back. He follows after him and punches the armor.
Peter groans but fastens the button anyway. He was close to being late and didn’t have time to change again.
When it comes down to discussing Peter and that happiness, the meeting only consists of three people. Sam appreciated the input the team had to offer, but at the end of the day, it wasn’t up to them. The last discussion they had as a whole didn’t result in anything other than bickering.
Her eyes dart down to where he’s holding his middle, then up to his eyes again. She’s gentle when she touches him, but even her soft touch forces him to cry out. Blood spills from the deep cut above his belt and Natasha replaces his hand with her own, not caring if his blood coats her skin.
“Okay. Um...I...I’ve never felt anything like I have with anyone else. He’s caring, sweet, a wonderful mate and father.”
Tony smiles down at Peter’s sleeping face, taking it in every detail. He can see most of his features already, and the dark hair atop his head was no doubt a Stark trait. There was a bit of Steve in Peter’s face, but it was evident that their son was going to take after Tony.
He should have known about the baby. The signs were there and yet he chose to ignore every single one of them, writing it off as stress from work or the break-up. It was his fault.
“Go back to sleep. I got her. Wait-did she eat at all?” Tony asks, sighing when Steve shakes his head. “It’s okay. Maybe you should try pumping in the morning. At least that way I can give her a bottle when you’re resting.”
Steve nods his head, tears still rolling down his face. “They’re all there. He...he never-” A choked sob cuts Steve off.
“I know,” Peter says again and he glances down at his lap, fidgeting with his fingers. “I’m sorry too.”
Steve nods, but he still finds himself reaching for a rattle. The material it’s made out of is soft and colorful, nothing at all like the rattle he had when he was young. He smiles as he brushes his fingers along the plush exterior. It goes in the cart.
The alarm is blaring and an eerie red light flashes around him. Steve pushes through, wracking his brain for the exit. He’s been through these corridors a few times, but it’s his eidetic memory that aids him in his escape.
“I love you, too, Papa.” Peter hugs Steve tightly. He pulls away and gets a good look at his papa’s face, frowning at what he sees. “Why are you so sad?” he asks, reaching out to cup Steve’s cheek.
Steve’s eyes grow shiny with tears. A few escape and Tony wipes them away. He pulls Steve close when a choked sob escapes him.
“Nothing,” Steve says with a shrug of his shoulders. He’s gathering the plates and plastic blue forks while Tony gets the cake prepared. His back is turned but Steve was almost positive Tony was adding candles to one side.
I couldn't resist not posting the next chapter. It's a little on the short side but it's full of bonding time with baby Peter. I hope you all enjoy it and have a wonderful, and relaxing day!
“It’ll be fine,” Steve offers a smile of reassurance and slips one hand free so that he can take Tony’s. “I’ll get better and...and we’ll be okay. We’ll be happy.”
“Did he forget to cut the crust off of Peter’s sandwiches? I left, Bruce. I left everyone. Steve never would’ve done that. I know I’m not perfect, and I know for a fact that I’m still the villain in this story, but I’m trying okay? I’m trying for that kid.”
Steve nods and cuts into the french toast. He takes a bite and hums in delight, then he offers a piece to Tony. “It is good,” he says. “You can cook.”
His breath hitches in this throat at the sight of the small figure. He had already seen the baby on the monitor but now he’s able to look at it even closer. He can clearly make out its tiny head and body. Even its arms and legs were visible.
“They’re his?” Sam asks. Steve doesn’t reply. The pups didn’t belong to that alpha. Steve doesn’t even know what happened to the three strangers that sired his sons and daughter. His lack of response must make Sam assume that the pups do in fact belong to the alpha Steve has mentioned. “Did he...force himself on you?”
Steve is pushed forward and he loses his balance, staggering for a moment until one of the alphas grabs him and leads him in the right direction. The sound of a helicopter reaches his ears and Steve comes to a stop, this time putting up a fight. A throbbing in his head makes itself known and that’s when Steve realizes he’s been hit. He goes limp.
Steve doesn’t respond, and instead he’s spinning around and scooping his son into his arms. He holds Peter close. “I-I love you so much.”
“You’re awake,” Bucky says, his tone showing both relief and bitterness. Peter knows who the bitterness is for, but he knows better than to bring up his dad now.
There’s a small smile on his face when Morgan is in his arms. “Shh. Sweetheart, it’s okay. I’m here,” Steve’s soothing voice has Morgan quieting down. Her eyes open and she peers up at him. Steve smiles down at her. “You’re okay,” Steve soothes, using one hand to gently stroke her face.
The way Steve’s voice takes on a deep, husky tone has Tony giving up on upgrades and setting the tablet aside.
Peter was sure he’d be glad to be back at the compound, but the moment he steps inside, his eyes fill with tears and his legs threaten to give out. If not for his aunt he’d probably be on the floor.
He doesn’t dwell on it right away. He’s exhausted by the time the elevator opens up to his floor, and it takes most of his energy to drag his ass to his bedroom. With a groan, Peter plops down face first onto his bed, his eyes struggling to stay open the second his head meets the pillow.
Tony nods and tears prick his eyes. He takes a deep breath, hating how shaky it sounds. He’s supposed to be the strong alpha, the leader of the pack. His pack needed him now more than ever.
Steve moves away from the door, only managing to take a few steps before he’s doubling over and crying out from another contraction. He pants heavily, tears streaking his face when the pain worsens.
“Sorry,” Tony is the first to say. “Miss Potts, Pepper, she can be...she’s great, honest. I just didn’t expect her to meet you like this.”
Tony smiles and rises to his feet. He leans in and gently kisses Pepper on the cheek. “Thanks, Pep.”
Bucky rolls his eyes and pushes Sam away, only to be pulled back and a gentle kiss placed to his lips. Bucky deepens the kiss and his metal hand wraps around the front of Sam’s shirt, bringing him closer. Alpine meows in annoyance and leaps off Bucky’s lap.
“Pete,” Steve sighs and rubs a hand over his face. Despite having a serum that granted him superhuman abilities, the fatigue still managed to kick his ass. Perhaps he was over exerting himself. If he wasn’t counseling healing omegas then he was caring for his pups. Life was hectic, but it was good and he wouldn’t trade this life for anything.
The first night with Peter since coming home is harder than Steve thought it was going to be. Steve’s thankful he’s not alone to deal with the late-night feedings and fussy tantrums. Bucky, Natasha, and Sam all volunteered to help out. Having the extra set of hands was a life saver.
“You’re just jealous because she loves me more,” Bucky rubs behind Alpine’s ear affectionately, provoking another purr and soft meow.
It hurts when Tony leaves with just Morgan. She’s already asleep once he has her in the car. Tony’s eyes land on the large building, tears threatening to fall at the thought of Steve being in there alone. But this was good for him. This is what had to be done.
The tears keep falling and this time Peter doesn’t try to stop them. The pain was still fresh and too great. He’s not sure if he’ll ever be able to heal from this loss. His father was all he had and then in an instant, he was gone and Peter didn’t know how he was supposed to survive something like that.
“I have no problem with that,” Tony jokes, ignoring the way Steve frowns at him. “But if you want to name him Benjamin then we can.”
Tony waits outside the room, his right leg bouncing nervously and his eyes glued to the door a few feet away from him. He hasn’t been able to tear his gaze away since he was first asked to wait outside. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t hurt that Steve suggested he wait outside of the room. Tony gave Steve the space he wanted, but there was a part of him that wished Steve would have granted him access.
“I’m sure he likes them,” Peter says and his eyes roam over the gifts that have been left behind. “All of them.”
The journal is resting over Steve’s belly as he draws. For once their son isn’t kicking up a storm and allowing Steve to sketch without the baby pushing the journal off when he stretched. Tony watches as Steve works, drawn to the way Steve’s brow furrows slightly or when the tip of his tongue pokes out between his lips.
Peter smirks when he catches the fearful look on Flash’s face. It was about time someone threatened him.
And yet he didn’t even know the whole story. He didn’t know how they met or why. The bit of information Steve did give him wasn’t enough to paint the whole picture. Pieces were still missing from the puzzle.
Steve and Peter moved into Tony’s private quarters while Tony recovered. The room Tony had been working on for Peter was now complete; Steve helped finish it while Tony rested. The last thing he wanted was Tony getting out of bed and hurting himself again.
Tony shakes his head, refusing to listen to the AI’s words. He reaches for another glass, ready to fill it and chug down the alcohol until the world around him fades. But then a familiar voice fills the space and Tony lifts his head, almost regretting it when he’s met with an image of Steve.
Tony doesn’t emerge from his workshop anymore. What used to be a solace for him was now a prison. He spends hours working on suits he knows he’ll never get a chance to use. Iron Man was dead.
It had taken a while for Steve to adjust, but once he did, he smiled for the camera. It was shy and reserved, but it was a smile. The one Tony knew he’d never get enough of.
Peter’s brows furrow and his stomach coils. For a second he wonders if Flash knows, but then he realizes Flash is referring to the party.
“I know. I’m sorry I had been so careless. But you don’t have to worry about me. I’m fine,” Tony assures.
Tony isn’t alone. Dodger is lying near his feet while Tony stocks the wooden dresser with baby clothes. Steve had meant to do that earlier, but with his due date just around the corner, he had been too exhausted to do much of anything.
He hates the cheery atmosphere and the smiles on the staff they pass by. He hates that this was where Steve was going to be for the next few weeks. He hates that this is what their talk led to. It wasn’t fair.
“I think you need to grow into this,” Steve says and gently removes the helmet from Peter's head. “I’ll keep it for now okay?”
“Stop, stop.” Tony drops the bag and rushes to the panicking omega. He rests his hands over Steve’s broad shoulders. “Hey, look at me. He’s not going to find you. I got this under control.”
It was a lie of course. He wasn’t fine. His stomach was acting up again and he was sure the second he saw Flash he’d vomit all over again. Hopefully not on him.
“You look like...well, you know what you look like. I think you’re better off going home. I can manage, Mr. Stark.”
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony pants, his grip on Steve’s hips tightening. “You look so good riding my cock. Does it feel good?”
“J, play it again,” Tony orders the A.I. All morning as he slaves away in his lab, he’s had Jarvis play a new playlist. For once it’s not some classic rock song.
He forgets about the throbbing in his head the second he takes in his surroundings. He’s no longer at the party, nor in the private room he had been escorted to. His mind is fuzzy, struggling to piece together the puzzle. This didn’t make sense. He shouldn’t be here.
“Look!” Peter quickly pulls out the photo, making sure to glance around his shoulder to make sure no one was paying them any mind. No one was. They were losers and easily got lost in the crowd. For once Peter doesn’t care.
“Pete,” Steve says softy, his heart shattering at the sobs his son makes. Peter refuses to look at him, keeping his eyes on his lap. “Pete, look at me.”
He knew Natasha Romanoff already, but still struggled to fully trust her. Clint Barton had his moments and could be a real pain in the ass. Thor, The god of thunder was...well, Tony was still trying to figure that out. The last he knew Thor was just a mythical character. Bruce Banner appeared to be the only guy on the team that spoke Tony’s language, both figuratively and literally. They clicked instantly and Tony didn’t care about Bruce’s mean streak and his tendencies to smash things.
Tony cries out in frustration and is ready to throw his phone into the wall, only to pause mid throw when Pepper bursts through the door. Tony heaves out a sigh and is ready to tell her to give him five fucking minutes, but then he notices the tears in her eyes.
“Asleep too. The check up really upset them. They’re okay...for the most part. The bruises will fade but I don’t think the rest will. Not yet.”
“Okay so maybe this isn’t the simple you wanted but I thought we could have some fun, try something new.”
Peter frowns at those words. “Is it bad? Are you going on another mission?” He gasps suddenly. “Can I come, too! I want to fight bad guys!”
He’s left alone again and the door shuts, locking into place. Steve retreats back to his bed and curls around himself. The tears burn the corners of his eyes and he doesn’t even try to hold them back.
Steve senses them before the door even opens. The sound of the metal door screeching against the floor sends the hairs on Steve’s body standing on end. The sound of heavy boots and the musky alpha scent make him coil up and whimper.
“It is, isn’t it?” Alexander cuts through their moment. He steps closer and stretches out a hand, his fingers wrapping around the back of Steve’s shirt and pulling him back. Tony growls and lurches forward, only to be held back from the chains. “This is his fault. He ran away, disobeyed orders, went against his alpha.”
“Okay…” Tony frowns. “I’m sorry, what exactly are you talking about? I don’t remember us meeting at all.”
“Whoa! Hey I wasn’t ready!” Peter makes sure to take a step back in case another punch came his way. Steve chuckles at his son’s reaction and Peter frowns. “It’s not funny! I wasn’t ready!”
The team was supposed to return in a couple of days. Peter felt confident that he could take care of himself until their return, but it wasn’t being unsupervised that had him so on edge. He needed his family to come back. They were all he had left.
Steve nods his head. There was no point in trying to deny the feelings he still had for Tony. Everyone could clearly see how he felt. Tony saw it too but unlike everyone else, he chose to ignore it. It hurt knowing that Tony was hesitant to reciprocate those feelings, but despite that, Steve couldn’t stop loving Tony. He probably never will.
Steve gently puts Harley down. “You both need to get along. I know it’s hard sometimes but you have to try. Now Pete can you say you’re sorry?”
“That would’ve been stupid,” Tony says, his voice rough. He squeezes Steve’s hand again and shifts, grunting when he tries to sit up. “I’m fine,” he waves Steve off.
“Shh. It is. I love seeing you in my space is what I’m trying to say. I love waking up and finding you here. And pretty soon…” Tony’s hand trails down between them and rests on the growing bump. “She’ll join us.”
“Yep. James did a little bit of reading today; he did good with that. Uh let’s see...oh! Sarah tried using the potty and well...yeah we’re working on it. Harley helped me down in the lab and Petey slept and pooped all day. Nothing too exciting.”
Steve rarely curses like this, meaning it must feel good for him. It’s starting to feel good for Tony, too. The sting is starting to diminish and pleasure is taking over, coursing through him in electrifying sparks. Steve is thrusting faster now, filling the room with a mixture of his pleasured sounds and their hips meeting.
And now he has his death to add to that hurt. Steve was gone and any chance he ever had with him was gone. Tony fucked it all up when he left, and when he refused to listen to what Steve had to say.
Tony swallows hard, eyes transfixed on the light blue ones he gets the privilege to stare into every day. “I want you to do something else now,” he says, earning another chuckle from the blond.
“Natalie Rushman,” the woman introduces herself and offers a perfectly manicured hand for Tony to take.
Moving quietly and cautiously, Tony creeps up behind the two alphas, and once close enough, uses the knife to take down the first alpha. The man screams in pain and flails his arms, trying to reach behind himself for the knife lodged in his neck. Tony shoved him toward the other alpha, catching the second off guard and unable to pull his gun from his holster. Tony shoots him in the chest and he goes down.
“I know, I know. I’m just saying. He’s...he’s a little messed up. Okay, maybe a lot. He’s not perfect, but he’s a good guy. Just don’t hurt him okay? I may be his bodyguard and chauffeur, but I’m his friend first.”
JARVIS sighs and Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. He didn’t need a scolding right now. Lord knows he gets it enough from Pepper.
Tony is hesitant for a moment, then he nods his head. Peter is gently placed over his chest and Tony smiles down at him. Peter whimpers again, clenching his tiny hand before finding Tony’s t-shirt and grasping it.
Peter bites down on his bottom lip. The words are right there on the tip of his tongue. All he had to say was two words. But he couldn’t muster up the courage to do it.
“Next year? Honey, I already had to wait a year before I could even put that ring on your finger. Why do you want to wait?”
“Just hear me out. I’m having a baby in a few weeks and I want to devote all of my time to that little boy. Steve is going to need me more than ever and I don’t see how I can be there for them and run this place. I’d rather step down and let you take over. You’re the best person qualified for the job.”
“Come here, baby,” Steve turns slightly to face his son. Harley smiles brightly and crawls into his mother’s lap. Steve smiles down at him and kisses the top of his head.
“I think-” Tony starts and takes Steve’s hands. “-you’re overthinking. Don’t worry about him or anyone else. Today is about you and our son. Nothing else matters.”
“Fuck, Tony!” Steve cries out from one particular hard thrust, tipping his head back and exposing his throat. Tony wastes no time in marking up the soft flesh.
They end up spending most of the night down in the lab. Tony had told his son a bit about the project, but the rest was a surprise. He wasn’t sure if it would work, but he’s keeping his fingers crossed. They needed to find a way to cope and heal.
The pain passes, giving him a break from the discomfort. Steve makes his way into the bathroom, turning on the shower and letting the water heat up. He strips from his suit, hissing from the aches in his body.
Which is why Tony isn’t going to give up. He was done shutting himself out and wallowing in self pity. He had promised he’d be a good father and there was no way in hell he’d break a promise like that. He’s broken enough; let too many people down. But he was changing his ways.
But the sleep he desperately craves isn’t granted to him and he’s forced awake when he’s roughly kicked in the side. He grunts from the pain and his eyes squeeze shut. He’s kicked again and this time Tony forces his eyes open.
Their hands intertwine and Tony brings Steve close. He gently cups Steve’s face and brushes away the tears that roll down his cheeks. Steve sniffs and tries to turn away, but Tony brings him back.
“That’s just it,” Bucky says and he sniffs. “That’s not Steve. It hasn’t been in months. And I guess I want to know why we didn’t fucking do anything about it.”
Tony sighs sadly and rises to his feet, searching around the room for a tissue. He rushes into the bathroom to retrieve some of the toilet tissue. He returns and hands it to Steve.
Peter drops down to his knees in front of the broken shield. His shoulder slump and he hangs his head, tears streaming down his face as he sobs.
Tony ignores the annoyed look on her face when she steps into the lab. He can’t remember if he had a meeting today or new interns to meet. Even if he did, he didn’t care. None of it mattered.
“It took some time before they brought me another alpha. I had another boy. I named him James after my best friend. He wasn’t the one Alpha wanted and they took him. I didn’t even get to hold him.”
Steve cries out again. His eyes squeeze shut and the grip he has on the bed sheets tightens. He tries to switch positions, remembering how that helped whenever the pain would hit. He’s been through this before, but he doesn’t recall it being this uncomfortable.
“Hello?” Peter answers, his brows furrowed in confusion. He can’t think of a reason for Happy to be calling him. At first he assumes he’s left something behind in the car, then his mind comes up with another reason. What if Happy knew?
“Is this you being nice or your way of keeping me here to help when your son starts crying?” Bruce teases.
The video call ends and Tony leans back in his chair with a heavy sigh. He knows he should go upstairs to be back with his mate and son, but he can’t help but get the itch to work. It’s been months since he’s gotten his hands dirty. Steve and the baby had been his top priority, and though they still are, he missed work sometimes.
The pups are exhausted after their participation in the proposal. Their eyes grew heavy and Peter started to fuss, making the trip back to the house seem impossible. It was Tony who was able to calm their youngest, and soon Peter was in the alpha’s arms and falling asleep on their way back to the house.
“Fuck!” Steve cries out suddenly when that spot inside of him is touched. Tony does it again, this time adding more pressure and rubbing along the bundle of nerves. Steve’s cock twitches and oozes at the tip, creating a trail of precum down the shaft. It’s one of the hottest things Tony has ever seen.
“That’s enough.” A familiar voice cuts through and Steve freezes at the sight of the head alpha. Pierce steps into the room with Rumlow beside him.
“I’m staying with Bucky tonight.” Is all Steve says, then he’s turning away and heading into the bathroom. Tony follows, watching from the doorway as Steve gathers a few items from the room.
“What-” Steve begins to say, brows furrowing at the strange gift. He peers up at his boyfriend for an answer, and this time Tony supplies him one.
“He was abused okay! He came from a screwed up place. All I know is there’s a chance that the pup he’s carrying could be mine, and I can’t just throw him out there when he’s being searched for.”
Steve decides to go ahead and make an appointment with one of SHIELD’s doctors. The staff had been good to him during his previous pregnancies or regular check ups. He trusted them.
Tony sighs sadly and sits back down near Steve, not caring if his jeans are wet and uncomfortable. “Hey,” he says softly. “I won’t hurt you like he did. I’m not that kind of alpha.”
It’s difficult to move out of the city and away from the only life they’ve ever known. Steve had been hesitant at first about leaving the compound and his old life, but then he came around to the idea and started looking forward to the future.
Tony steps deeper into the lab. For the first time, the sight of his husband sends a shiver up Steve’s spine. The closer Tony gets, the further Steve steps back until he’s bumping into Tony’s workbench and trapped between the two.
Tony doesn’t have to travel to New York...at least not for a while. He was able to bribe-more like beg- Pepper into letting him postpone the trip. She was capable of handling the business just a little longer. Tony was already planning on giving her another raise or even signing over the entire company.
The first thing Tony notices about him is the backpack around his shoulder. That answered the school question. The next thing was his red, glistening eyes. Great. He had been crying. Tony wasn’t sure if he could even cheer him up. He couldn’t even cheer his own self up.
Pepper steps in to help, taking the smaller omega so that Steve can retrieve his son. Peter doesn’t even stir from his deep slumber, and remains fast asleep in his car seat.
Tony nods but doesn’t dare push the topic of Steve’s death. Obviously it was too touchy of a subject for Peter to even talk about it. If it was ever brought up he found ways to skirt past it.
“You don’t have to say,” Tony says, sensing his son’s hesitation. “I know he probably hated my guts.”
The tension between them is thick and the silence is uncomfortable; it’s nothing new to them. From the moment they first met each other, it was decided by both parties that any form of a relationship was impossible to create. They had to be civil, though. Part of their job description was working together. It shouldn’t be difficult, and yet they struggled to meet in the middle.
The baby shower wouldn’t be very big either. Pepper, Happy, and Bruce would probably show up. It would just be something small and intimate between them.
James and Harley are curled up together in their bed and Sarah is fast asleep in her crib. She was growing fast every day and pretty soon she would be ready for a toddler bed. Tony adds it to his mental list.
“Yay! I really love him and I want to hold him all the time and I want to play and eat cookies and-”
I finally decided on Flash because I haven’t really read that pairing before and I thought it would be interesting to write about. And now Steve knows!
“Always,” Steve promises and he pulls his son into another hug. “And when I come back we’ll make you that suit okay?”
“Ah yes! It will help your child sleep. One drop of this before bed and he’ll be out like a light,” Thor explains, smiling proudly at his gift.
Steve rereads the words he wrote over and over again, before deciding it was enough and putting the letter away. He doesn’t know why he’s even bothered to write to Tony again when he was supposed to be moving on, but the letter isn’t just for Tony. It’s for Peter too.
“He’s a small grownup. Trust me he’s mature enough. If I can trust him with my life then I trust him with Morgan’s. It’s just for a couple of hours, remember?”
Tony sighs and turns his chair so he can face Pepper. “Honestly I don’t know. They want nothing to do with me and that’s fine. I’m the one who screwed it up.”
Waiting for the results never fails to be a nerve-wracking experience. Steve can’t tear his eyes away from the test sitting on the countertop. His finger finds its way into his mouth and he chews away the nail. His stomach is still doing somersaults, but he knows better than to blame the feeling on a possible baby. He’s done that enough.
“I know! I’m not…” Tony lets out a sigh when Morgan grows fussy again. Natasha holds out her hands and Tony gently passes his daughter to her. Tony sighs again and scrubs a hand over his face. “I know he wouldn’t. But you weren’t there, Nat. He was so...angry. I got scared. I had to protect my baby.”
“Why are you still hung up on that night anyway?” Happy asks and turns his attention back on the road.
Eventually Peter breaks away and wipes at his nose with the sleeve of his hoodie. “Are you going to leave now?”
Tony kisses Steve again then he leaves the room. Steve lingers a little longer than he means to but he needs to make sure his son is safe. One glance in the crib showed his son peacefully sleeping. Steve smiles at the scene and with one hand, reaches out to run his fingers along Peter’s face.
“Don’t get any ideas. You already knocked me up,” Tony teases and begins stripping Steve from his uniform. He starts with the belt, his memory playing back the scene of them struggling with it just this morning. “I don’t know why you have to be so stubborn,” Tony complains as he works on removing the dirty boots. They hit the floor with a thud.
After they serve their food and settle in front of the large tv screen, Happy finds the remote and searches for his favorite show.
The first thing he does after mingling is help himself to the food. He has no shame in loading one of the red paper plates with anything and everything. If anyone were to ask well...fuck them, he’s pregnant. He can eat whatever he wants.
Their eyes meet for a second and Peter quickly looks down to avoid Flash’s gaze. He didn’t know how he was going to tell Flash yet, but this wasn’t the time or the place.
Steve swallows hard before speaking. “My name is Steve Rogers. I was born and raised in Brooklyn. Um…” Steve pauses and frowns, unsure of how to continue. He can’t mention the army, his sacrifice, being frozen for years. He wasn’t ready to reveal who he really was yet.
The storm was beginning to pass, and the clouds were opening up, revealing a bright, blue sky. The waves weren’t crashing over Steve. They weren’t forcing him down. He wasn’t drowning anymore.
It’s well into the evening by the time Steve has his son dressed and ready for bed. He settles them both into the rocking chair and lifts his shirt, then he brings Peter to his chest and helps him latch on. Steve chuckles softly when Peter nurses greedily.
“Yeah.” Steve nods as he follows Tony up the stairs, doing his best not to complain about the lack of air he was receiving.
Natasha grins, her expression reminding Steve of the smiley face on the test. At least hers was more comforting and he didn’t have the urge to throw her in the trash and cover her with tissues.
Peter opens the drawer to his dresser and rummages through it, taking as much as he can and making a pile on his old bed.
The second Peter finds Ned in the hall, his friend is glancing at his sweatshirt, then gasping and looking up at him with wide eyes. It takes Peter a second to realize why his friend was getting so excited. Peter rolls his eyes and turns to get into his locker.
Tony forces his own smile and gestures for them to sit in the nearby chairs beside the reception desk. It’s not the ideal place for a meeting, but Tony wasn’t about to take Alexander up to his private office. There was something about him he didn’t quite like.
Steve shakes his head. His eyes appear shiny and Tony wishes he had a tissue to offer him right about now.
Tony smiles, satisfied with Steve’s reaction. Though little words had been said, all of Steve’s appreciation and thanks was written on his face.
Tony smiles. “We never could. But maybe we can give it another shot. Talking. We gotta talk and work this out, Steve.”
Tony works quickly to tuck himself back into his pants, not caring that his expensive suit is now stained and reeking of their mating.
“Steve?” Tony calls out when he enters the bedroom and finds the room empty. The adjoined bathroom door is shut. The closed door is an obvious indication that Steve wants privacy, but there’s an urge to be near him. Tony can’t shake it.
Tony can’t help but cringe at the new name for himself. He had gotten used to Peter just referring to him as Mr. Stark, but now that they’ve spent the past few minutes getting to know each other, Peter felt comfortable enough to start calling Tony dad.
Bucky screams in anger and lunges at Tony, his metal fist connecting with Tony’s cheek. Tony tries to fight back, issuing punches and kicks of his own, but he’s no match against the super soldier. If only he had his suit.
“It’s going to be fine,” Steve assures and takes his place at the table. He takes a drink from his coffee, unaware that the smell is getting to his son.
“What’s with all the fuss, kiddo?” Tony asks, frowning at his son. Peter whirls around in Steve’s arms at the sound of his daddy, his eyes immediately filling with fresh tears just for Tony.
Tony sets the frame down so that he can pull Steve into his arms. He kisses him gently, lovingly, their lips moving perfectly in sync with each other. Tony pulls away and rests his forehead against Steve’s.
James throws his arms around Steve’s neck, hugging him tightly. Steve hugs his son back, making sure to give him a gentle squeeze.
Steve holds his son close, small sobs escaping him. The little pup only clings to him tighter, finding comfort in the omega.
He’d still have to tell Ned at some point. Ned was his best friend and they always confided in each other. Peter needed to talk to someone. He couldn’t go to his parents because they would flip and probably throw him out. He already felt like a burden.
Her papa is in the kitchen, sitting at the table with an array of papers and envelopes laid out in front of him. Steve lifts his head from one of the files to send a smile his daughter’s way.
The familiar urge to push finally makes itself known and he gives in to his body’s demands, bearing down along with the contraction. He keeps his hand in place, fingers exploring the hard mass of his baby’s head as it slowly inches forward. It’s a struggle to hold the push for the duration he needs to, and he finds himself giving in to the exhaustion and easing off.
Tony is busy preparing snacks for the pups when Steve comes down stairs. Outside he can hear their children running around and playing whatever game their imagination conjured up. He smiles at the sound of their laughter, at their happiness.
He didn’t have a chance to go home and get what he needed for the delivery. As soon as he announced that he was in labor, Fury ordered him out and he was rushed to the medbay. The mission still carried on and he was left to say goodbye to his friends once he was settled in his private room.
“I know. I’ll hire someone. There’s no way in hell I’m going outside of the compound. Can you imagine the headlines? Yikes.”
The date goes better than expected. The restaurant was a nice Italian place with dim lighting, white table clothes, and soft music playing in the background. Tony orders their most expensive wine and Steve ignores it. He’s changed his mind and wants to be a little spoiled.
Steve sniffs and glances down at his lap, hiding the tears from Tony. But Tony knows they’re there and he reaches for Steve’s hand again. This time Steve doesn’t pull away.
Peter makes sure he’s not too close to avoid unwanted attention. The last thing he needed was security to be called because a teenager was seen outside loitering.
The first few presents are harmless:baby clothes, bottles, pacifiers, a diaper bag; things Steve was already expecting. Then came other items like a baby monitor and a bottle warmer and a few large items such as a car seat and stroller. Steve appreciated the monitor but he was positive Jarvis would be alerting them about Peter throughout the night.
Tony kisses back, enjoying the feel of Steve’s soft lips upon his own. A few more gentle kisses like that are shared before Tony is breaking the kiss and resting his forehead on Steve’s again.
Peter curses to himself when he sees his dad lingering in the doorway. He jumps up from his chair, ready to put himself between his father and Flash.
“Put him down and see if he’ll try walking again,” Steve says and sits with his legs crossed and arms open. “Pete, come to Papa.”
Steve sighs. “This would be so much easier if we had done this months ago. If we had been prepared…”
The expression on Steve’s face shifts from the mention of Peter. Nick is pleased. Deep down he knew that the famous Captain wouldn’t be gone forever. There would still need to be more tests run to make sure that Steve Rogers was still the man everyone knew him to be, but those would be conducted later. Right now Nick was relieved to find the Avenger alive again.
“This is my home so...yeah…” Tony gestures around the large space once they step inside. Peter’s eyes are wide again and soaking in as much as he can. “Don’t freak out. It’s not a big deal.”
But then the nurse is bringing the baby over. Steve is instructed to open his hospital gown enough to expose his chest, and then the baby is gently being placed over him. It’s familiar, holding him this way, the only difference is the wires connecting the baby to a nearby monitor.
Tony does try to move away and it’s then he realizes the chains preventing him from moving very far. The shackles bind his wrists and a line of chains link together with the ones around his ankles. The chains are secured into the wall.
“I hope so. You know how he is when I buy him stuff. Are you guys going to help me keep this a surprise?”
He gives himself one last look then shuts off the light and exits the bathroom. He finds Tony in the nursery dressing their son. Tony is already dressed, looking sharp and handsome in one of his suits. Steve suddenly feels underdressed, but before he can turn around and think about changing, Tony is pausing the peekaboo game with Peter to glance up at him.
Peter seems content with that answer. He finishes up the rest of his food, then he’s pushing his plate away and running off toward the living room to pick out a movie. Tony sighs and takes the dirty plate to wash it.
Their fertility problems were because of Steve. He was the reason why they struggled to have a family. It was his issues that prevented them from having their own simple life. Tony had been willing to sacrifice everything to carry their son, but it was evident that he was having regrets.
The hand over his mouth is removed, only to be replaced with the alpha’s lips. Those lips trail lower until they’re hovering over the spot no other alpha was allowed to touch. Steve’s body reacts when a kiss is placed there.
Tony decides to do the same and hang up his suit. The world would go on without him, but his family couldn’t. They were his world. They meant more to him than anything else.
“Whatever you say, bossy pants,” Sam says, then a mischievous look spreads across his face and he pulls Bucky close again. “You know...with Pete out of the house...you and I could…” Sam waggles his eyebrows suggestively.
Someone is touching him, and his eyes shoot open, a few tears escaping now that they’ve been given an opportunity. He turns toward the figure standing beside him, meeting the soft green eyes of his aunt. She wraps her arm around his shoulder, and he clings tightly to her.
Stark Tower, just like the rest of the buildings around it, was already open and ready for a new day. People are entering through the front doors, dressed nicely in their professional attire, but none of them bother to grab Peter’s attention. He only had eyes for one person.
While he waits for Peter to come downstairs, Steve returns to the kitchen to prepare something else that hopefully his son could stomach. Tony is already in the kitchen, drinking his coffee and still ignoring him. Or maybe it was the other way around. Either way, they both weren’t talking to each other.
He glances up from the test, unable to stare at it any longer. The sight he finds is much worse. Steve’s smile is almost identical to the one the smiley face wears. Shit. Maybe Tony was supposed to be happy.
“Pretty boring,” Peter starts to say while he stabs his fork into the chicken. “But Ned did tell me about his new Star Wars Lego set. Oh and I talked to MJ-uh I mean...that’s not important.”
Tony inhales sharply and the grip he has on the steering wheel tightens. He couldn’t imagine going to visit Steve’s grave again. The first time had been torture and he knows the second time wouldn’t be any better. It was easier to try and forget. Move on.
“Hey.” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand and interlocks their fingers. He brings it up to his lips to place a kiss along Steve’s knuckles. “I had fun.”
He couldn’t have a baby now. Not when he was only 17 and still had his whole life ahead of him. There was so much he wanted to do, and wanted to see. He had college to think about, his social life, a job. All of that was gone now.
Morgan agrees, “It was. But I still want you to be Spider-Man and I still want Harley to get attention. I guess I just wanted some for myself.”
“Pete, where’s my-” Steve pauses when his son leaps off the bed and rushes out of the room. Steve sighs, knowing exactly where his missing helmet went.
And Bruce keeps his word. He carefully takes the baby into his arms and makes sure the towel remains around Peter’s tiny form.
“Shh. I know,” Steve soothes. He manages to get a few good burps out of him, then he lays him over his chest and holds his son close. It’s not long before Peter is purring softly. Steve responds with his own purr.
“I know.” Tony nods and takes Steve’s hand, brushing his thumb over the naked finger. “I love you so much, and I’m sorry for hurting you by being an idiot and saying those stupid things. I don’t want us to fight anymore. We need to stick together, right?”
“Of course you do. I’ll try my best to answer whatever you throw at me. Now get out of here and go watch a movie. And not some cheesy, old one.”
Steve chuckles at the sight, and James snaps his head up at him. “It’s okay,” Steve assures. “Daddy is just silly.”
Steve chuckles and ducks his head down to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead. He intertwines their hands and they share a smile.
“Steve,” Tony says, making sure to keep his tone calm. Steve snaps his head up at him, showing off his red and tear-filled eyes. “Honey, let me have her.”
With a huff he asks JARVIS to let him. The AI doesn’t hesitate to let him in and Steve rushes inside the moment the door opens. Tony’s nowhere to be found.
Steve glances down at his son. “Okay,” he murmurs and kisses the top of Peter’s head. “Be gentle. He’s tiny.”
Tony is forced to let her go on and on about pulling himself together and stepping up to be a father. Tony can’t help but roll his eyes at this. He knows that’s exactly what he needs to do and damn it he was trying.
After a while of lingering and chatting with a few other guests, Tony is led away from the party to be introduced to the leader behind all of this.
“It is simple,” Tony defends and steps further into the room to grab the bear. He turns around and holds it out for Steve. “His name is Teddy. Yes it’s not original but he’s adorable so whatever. And he has something for you.”
He can hear her voice in his head, but he tunes it out and reaches for the glass, bringing it up to his lips and taking a large drink. It burns going down.
They are my favorite characters and I will always go down with this ship! I just wanted to write something different.
Peter nods and his uncle leaves the room. With a huff Peter collapses on the bed. Sleep beckons him, but just like previous nights, he knows he won’t be getting any. The nightmares never leave him alone.
Tony shakes his head and gladly takes Peter into his arms. Peter hugs the older alpha close, nosing around Tony’s neck in search of his scent gland. The tears dry up once he’s found it and he purrs softly against Tony’s skin.
Peter had been thrilled when he learned the baby was a boy; he was finally getting the little brother he always wanted, and it was obvious from the smile he wore and the glint in his eye that he was happy. Steve and Tony were, too. Maybe even more so than their son.
“It’s going to be okay. We’ll get through this,” Tony promises and holds Steve close. He leans down to kiss the top of his head.
“Okay.” Peter nods and returns his gaze back to the screen. This time, he can’t take his eyes off it.
“Is that your way of telling me to take a break?” Steve asks his belly, smiling when he gets a kick in response. “Okay. I hear you loud and clear. I guess you can be nameless for one more night.”
Bruce smiles and presses his stethoscope to Steve's chest, listening to steady beatings of his heart. “So far everything looks good. Tony did mention that you heal at an...abnormal rate.”
Sam and Bucky glance up at him and Peter prays they don’t start yelling. He was only a few minutes late after all.
Tony rises to his feet and grabs the throw blanket from the back of the sofa and places it over Peter’s sleeping form. The tv is shut off and a light is left on.
Tony sighs and scrubs a hand over his face. How could he have been so stupid? Of course it would all be a lie. He didn’t know anything about Steve or how they even met. Steve didn’t give him any details and Tony had no recollection of them meeting. None of it made sense.
When Steve pulls away he can feel eyes on him and he glances in Tony’s direction, finding his fiancé staring with a smile on his face.
Tony wrestles with the chains, biting back his own groan of pain when the metal digs painfully into the sensitive skin on his wrists. He needs to touch his mate, he needs to comfort him and assure him that everything was going to be okay. Steve needed him now more than ever.
“Morning, Petey,” Steve greets followed by a yawn. Peter was always the first one up, demanding someone-that someone being Steve-play with him.
Steve had probably felt the same way. Or maybe even worse. Tony had blown him off, blocked him and acted like Steve never meant anything. Steve had needed Tony then just like Tony needs Peter now. This is the kind of torture Tony felt he deserved.
“I’ll let you know when I need another ride. Make sure he’s eating and drinking, and getting plenty of rest.”
Peter sighs again and runs a hand through his hair. Telling Flash was going to be difficult. Probably worse than telling his parents and Ned.
Tony rolls over, a heavy sigh leaving him at the sight of the empty spot beside him. He reaches out and lays a hand over the place Steve normally lies. It’s cold to the touch.
Tony steps away after that, going back to his original spot on the sofa and heaving out a deep sigh. Someone approaches him, and Tony expects it to be Peter or even Bruce, but when it’s Bucky, Tony tenses and sits up straight.
Peter grins and tears off the paper. He opens the box and peers inside, a small gasp leaving his lips at what he finds. He takes out a gold compass.
“This is why you’re not doing events like that anymore. The Stark Expo is one thing but anything else is forbidden. You’re always coming home drunk and sleeping around. Now it’s finally caught up with you.”
It seemed to be working though. At least, Steve would say they were anyway. Tony had to believe him.
He realizes once they’re seated that he may have gone overboard. The white tablecloth and candles were harmless, and the soft music playing through the speakers is nice; but Tony can’t help but feel it was too much too soon.
“There he is!” Tony from the video says cheerfully. Steve enters the frame, unamused with another video.
But he doesn’t want anything to go down. Maybe once upon a time he used to be that guy that partied a little too much, but those days were over. He had a son to think about. Even though his son was already nearing adulthood, Tony was still set on being there for him and providing for his every need. He was very late to that party, but better late than never.
A small grunt reaches his ears and his head snaps up, eyes landing on the limp form across the room. He rushes toward his mate, and drops down beside him.
Weeks pass and still nothing regarding marriage pops up. Steve hadn’t even told their friends that a future wedding was on the horizon. They still asked and prodded for information. Steve didn’t blame them for being so curious.
“Yes?” Steve responds, uneasily waiting. He never did like getting called out when he failed to take care of himself. He can remember an instance when he was backed into a corner and both his husband and Jarvis scolded him for refusing medical treatment.
“Yeah,” Steve replies, doing his best to keep the pain out of his tone. The tightening in his middle starts to fade, relieving him from the intense pressure. “Yeah, I’m good.”
“Sir,” JARVIS’s voice comes through. At the new voice, Steve is jumping in his seat and scanning the room for the source.
“Oh. Yeah. I knew that. He’s just...yeah…” Steve is still panicking. He takes Peter into his arms and tries to calm him while he sits on the edge of the bed. It’s not until the bathroom door opens and Tony emerges does Steve sigh in relief. “Tony, he’s fussy and I can’t...please?”
It’s Steve who stops them from getting any closer. He lays one hand over Tony’s chest to stop him, but feeling Tony again, after so long, he can’t help but let his hand wander around the warm skin. His eyes fall shut, the urge to kiss Tony right now too strong. But he needs to fight the temptation.
“Well this sucks. He’s taking his sweet ass time.” Tony glares down at his belly. “Come on, kiddo. You’re killing daddy here.”
“Don’t.” The warning is said in his ear. Steve’s body breaks out in goosebumps from the feeling of the alpha’s warm breath against his ear. “I’m just curious. I wanna know what makes you so special. Why does Alpha get you all to himself?”
His heart sinks at the sight. He didn’t know the story behind the baby items he had seen earlier and his uncle Sam never did tell him about the child they weren’t having anymore. Peter didn’t want to fear the worst, but judging by his uncle’s reaction, he couldn’t help but think that way.
“Just wanted to get this done.” Tony finishes up filling the top drawer, then he’s giving Steve his undivided attention. “How are you feeling?”
“It’s okay to be scared. I get that now. You’re this brave hero that will stop at nothing to make things right, and I guess I never thought you could break. But it’s okay that you did. It doesn’t make you less brave, or strong; it just means you’re human. We all have those days, and I never ever want you to feel ashamed about them. Just promise me you’ll tell me when it gets too much. I’ll be there.”
Tony winces. He forgot to mention to his husband the change in that plan. “Actually she’s not coming.”
Steve whimpers again and wraps his arms around himself, hugging his body tighter. “I still feel him.”
Peter blows out a deep breath and starts pacing the room, his fingers running through his hair and pulling it, not caring about the pain he inflicts on himself. He can feel Ned’s eyes following him, but he can’t bring himself to look at his friend. It would be easier to say what he has to say without seeing Ned’s face.
“Buck…” Sam sighs when Bucky gets up from the couch and tries to leave the room. Sam’s hand flies out to stop him. “Wait. Sit down.”
I’m updating again...is that really a bad thing? 🤔 I swear I’ll update other stories. This chapter just got finished first 😆
Clint was on the boy side which of course earned him a smack from Natasha. But even that wasn’t enough to convince him otherwise.
“I think that’s a good idea.” The doctor nods her head in agreement. “Steve, let me take a look okay? We can go to the room across the hall.”
“I’ll have your breakfast ready,” Steve says, then he leaves the room and shuts the door behind him.
The fingers in his hair cease their movement and Peter knows. He takes a shaky breath and lifts his head.
Steve doesn’t mean to scoff but the sound comes out before he can even stop it. “Sorry. I just- how? You’re an omega and are successful and can do all these things and-”
“You’ve been awake all along?” Tony tsks and shakes his head. “You’ll never get to sleep again after this and you wasted it on me.”
The rest of the room is filled with what Steve can only assume is state of the art technology. Tony was a genius and an incredible inventor. It made sense that everything in his tower was created to be the best.
But meeting their son was what they were looking forward to the most. For months they’ve been anticipating Peter’s arrival. It was at the point where Steve struggled to hide his excitement. He was finally getting the one thing he’s wanted for so long.
Harley and Sarah are little rays of sunshine. Well, when they want to be. Harley is rambunctious and curious, constantly getting into things he shouldn’t. Tony admires the pup’s observation. He knew the pups were smart, but there was something about Harley that he related to.
The men don’t appear to be leaving any time soon and Peter quietly and carefully crawls away, holding his breath until he’s sure he’s out of earshot. He drops down to the floor and scurries away from the room and deeper into the base.
“No,” Natasha says and everyone turns toward her. “It’s mine. I knew something was wrong and I...I guess I didn’t want to believe that he would do this. It’s not like Steve to-he wouldn’t do this.”
Tony lets out a sigh. He knew the drastic changes to Steve’s body was an adjustment, and maybe he’d understand more if he had been in Steve’s shoes. In his eyes Steve still looked beautiful, probably the most beautiful he’s ever been. But Steve didn’t see it.
“You should write that letter,” Natasha decides to switch the conversation back to the previous topic. “I’m sure Tony will want to know. You already have a bunch of pictures that he’s missing out on.”
Happy grumbles some kind of response and leaves the room, shutting the door behind him. Now that they’re alone, Tony comes closer and takes the chair opposite of Steve.
“Gonna...cum!” Steve cries and he reaches between them for his cock, stroking himself along with Tony’s thrusts. Between the feeling of Tony’s cock rubbing along his walls and the friction of his own hand, it doesn’t take long until Steve is coming undone and spilling over his hand.
“Nah. I needed a break from the city. I can really think here,” Tony replies, leaning forward to resume tinkering away on the right boot of his suit. He probably wouldn’t put it on again, but it distracted him.
He’s not alone this time. Sarah is in his arms and James is walking obediently behind him with Harley’s hand held tightly in his own. Tony smiles at the sight of his little family. They were perfect.
Tony has expected to find his mate lingering outside near the front door but instead Steve was at the cliff that overlooked the ocean. He’s standing near the edge, not too far that Tony feared he’d have to run after him to catch him if he were to lose his footing, but close enough that Tony’s alpha side didn’t approve of his mate being alone and in harm's way.
Yikes it's not looking good. Tony is trying so hard and Steve is just...poor thing is a mess. But at least he's one step closer to getting some help and soon he'll be well on his way to feeling like himself again!
“I get it. We can always talk it over. You know, when the big, mean super soldier isn’t looking for blood.”
“Don’t. It’s not your fault. I don’t blame you. I’d never blame you. I’m sorry you went through all of that. I’m sorry you needed me and I couldn’t be there like I was supposed to. You told me you were drowning and I didn’t pull you up to the surface. I’ll never forgive myself. But I promise I’m here now. I’ll pull you up, and I’ll never let your hand go.”
With two out of the four pups under control, Steve rushes to take his youngest from a very overwhelmed Happy. It only takes a few minutes to get Peter calm.
That thought alone is enough to bring a small, hopeful smile to Steve’s face. He glances down at his belly, laying a hand over the small bump.
Having Bruce around is comforting and Steve finds himself relaxing and enjoying the party. He spends most of his time chatting with Bruce, and eventually joining a conversation that Happy has started. The other beta still came off as unsure when he was around Steve, but the omega didn’t take offense to his attitude. He understood that he was new to Tony’s group and it was going to take time until he was welcomed.
Time seems to be passing agonizingly slow. Tony can’t take sitting down anymore and he moves to pacing, his eyes flickering in the direction of the door every few minutes.
“Okay, okay. Relax. My intentions were not meant to steal that away from you. I know that’s your time to bond. I just wanted to help.”
Steve eyes him closely until Tony has no choice but to give in. With a sigh he says, “Okay. You got me. I need a break. But they were asking for you.”
“Tony?” Comes Bruce’s voice, followed by a knock against the doorframe. Tony glances over his shoulder and gestures with his head for the doctor to enter. “How is he?”
“Come on,” Tony gently pulls Steve to his feet, wincing in sympathy when Steve cries out. “I think you should let JARVIS scan you.”
“I figured you’ve had that before,” Tony says and Peter peers up at him. “I mean, he probably took you to Brooklyn, right?”
It’s an alert from FRIDAY that is jolting Tony awake. The room is darker, one glance out the window showing just how long he’s slept. Tony sits up, groaning softly and digging the heels of his hands in his eyes. It takes a few seconds for him to gather himself, and once he does, he turns toward his right, finding that Steve is no longer in bed with him.
“Good.” Peter seems pleased with that response and he scoots closer until his head is resting on Tony’s shoulder. “I love you, Dad.”
“Feel.” Is all Steve says and he takes Tony’s hand, leading it to the spot where their pup was growing. “Do you feel that?”
Steve’s smile returns and he leans close to peck Tony on the lips. The alpha frowns from the brief contact and brings his mate in for a proper kiss.
Tony groans when his cock brushes against Steve’s thigh. He ruts against the omega, smearing his leaking cock against Steve’s leg, marking him in his musky scent. Tony leans forward, burying his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, shaky breaths slipping past his lips.
Bucky forces a small smile. “I’ll be fine, but thanks anyway. Maybe one day I’ll get another chance.”
“We need to name him,” Tony says from his spot beside Steve. He reaches out to gently run a hand along his son’s back.
“Shh!” Peter hisses and quickly lowers his shirt down to hide the bump. “Ned, no one can know about this.”
Tony growls and kisses Steve again, this time a little rougher than before. Steve moans softly and wraps his arms around Tony’s neck, deepening the kiss.
“Do you know what happened?” Tony asks, taking his eyes off the road for a second to glance over at his nervous son.
A part of him wants to let go and return back to Alpha, but the other half reminds him of what’s in store for both himself and his pup. He can’t let Hydra hurt him anymore. He can’t let them hurt his pup.
“Nope.” She hands Steve a spoon and he takes it without any hesitation. “Ice cream is perfect for breakups.”
Back before Tony and waking up in this new world, Steve never thought he’d get a chance to have a family of his own. His health conditions made it impossible to conceive, and even if he had been able to, he and the baby probably would’ve suffered. It was too risky.
“Pep, what’s wrong?” Tony is out of his seat in seconds, ready to question her and comfort her if he can.
Steve studies the bottle. He didn’t know what Asgardians did for their young, but he wasn’t about to start following their customs. He still struggled enough with this new century.
He regrets the question the minute it leaves his mouth. What possessed him to even ask something like that was beyond him. It’s clear Steve is just as bothered by it, if the look on his face is anything to go by.
Steve lifts his head and shoots Tony a tired smile. His gaze falls to the hard cock between the alpha’s legs, the urge to be fucked becomes overwhelming. Steve spreads his legs wide, inviting the alpha.
Steve smiles and brings Tony back with him toward the bed. The back of his legs hit the edge of the bed and Steve lies back. Tony follows, crawling between his legs and connects their lips again. Steve pushes Tony away so that he can scoot up the bed and situate himself on top of the pillows.
“There you are.” Tony lifts his head when Steve enters the room. “You missed Pete spewing milk everywhere. Kid doesn’t appreciate anything I give him.”
He talks about his old team, The Howling Commandos and the missions they went on. He talks about losing Bucky and his capture.
“Hey, calm down, kid. I’m not saying I know him. You’re right. I don’t know him. I only know the parts the rest of the world knows or what he was brave enough to share. You’re lucky to have seen this...this other side of him. I only knew him as Cap.”
Peter’s face lights up, then a second later, his expression morphes into a frown. “I don’t know. I want to live with you but they…”
The driver gets out to open the door for Steve while a small group of security come over to assist with leading the omega into the tower. Despite knowing they work for his mate, Steve is hesitant to allow them to get so close to his pups. It’s not until a familiar face emerges from the crowd does Steve instantly lower his guard.
Bruce eventually finishes looking over both Steve and the baby, and announces that their son wasn’t on the way. Steve is able to breathe a sigh of relief. It was too soon for his son to be born. But he wasn’t ready to celebrate yet. Something about Bruce was off.
“I’ve been through worse,” Steve replies and glances toward the window again. He has a few questions lined up, but he can’t bring himself to ask them. Maybe it was because he was afraid to know the answers. But there was one he needed answered. “Where are we going?” He asks, turning back to Tony.
“He won’t be running the team. I’ll train him and when he’s ready if he wants to lead the Avengers then he’ll have the experience.”
“I’m not saying anything. It’s not his decision anyway,” Peter says, though a part of him knows Flash should have a say. He pushes that thought aside. He didn’t need Flash involved.
Then Tony asks him to dinner one evening and Steve’s mind is instantly back on the potential proposal. He tells himself to calm down when Tony says to dress nice. Steve makes sure to take extra time getting ready.
“Mr. Stark was our original person of interest,” Agent Coulson answers. “We noticed he had been engaging in activity with Alexander Pierce.”
“Listen,” Tony is the first to say. Steve still can’t bring himself to turn around. “I’m sorry how I left things...us. I just needed to step away and-can you look at me? I know I screwed up but-”
She stops at the last door on the right and Tony steps away, scanning the badge he had stolen off the dead Hydra soldier. The door opens and Tony gestures for the woman to enter first. She does as she’s told, small sobs escaping her every now and again.
“I figured we could reminisce,” Natasha says with a small shrug and flips the album to the first page. She immediately coos at the baby picture of Peter. “Look at you! You were so tiny and cute!”
With permission granted, James rushes over to the table to inspect its contents. Harley follows, mimicking his brother and licking his lips at the sight of the variety of muffins. Sarah puts up a fight in Pepper’s arms, clearly annoyed that she’s not getting a chance to explore. Pepper takes the younger pup over to the table, helping her pick out some apple juice and a blueberry muffin. Steve smiles to himself. Those were Tony’s favorites.
A small smile forms over Steve’s face. Tony’s unsure if the response he gets is enough proof that the omega believed him. All he wanted was for Steve to feel safe and secure around him. Even if they still considered each other strangers.
I’m sorry it’s taken me a while to update this one! Also sorry it’s on the short side. But it’s fluffy so that helps, right?
“Angsty? Hon, he’s a 17 year old. They act this way sometimes. Listen, I’ll be outta here in a few hours and I’ll talk to him.”
“Steve?” Tony rasps, hating how hoarse his voice sounds. He tries to sit up, only to wince and slump back down.
Peter smiles down at the compass before closing it and holding it tight in his hand. Tony wraps an arm around him and pulls him close. He ignores the stares he receives.
The baby whimpers again, capturing his parent’s attention. Steve stares down at him, adjusting the towel when he finds it slid off while he was passing the afterbirth. The whimpers die down and the baby slowly opens his eyes, revealing them for the first time since he was born.
“Shit.” Tony gasps and reaches for his son, sobbing softly once Peter is in his arms and laid on his chest. “H-hey, kiddo. You’re here. You’re finally here.”
Steve shakes his head at the question. His eyes are filling with tears again and he swallows the lump that has formed in his throat. “N-no,” he finally supplies a verbal answer, his voice shaky.
“Fine,” Tony grumbles and snatches up another piece along with a screw. “This is just fighting with me. This shouldn’t be this difficult. I build robots for Christ’s sake!”
“Save it, Rogers.” Tony rips himself free from Steve’s grasp. “It works out right? I’m engaged now. Turns out Pepper was the one. I hope you and Barnes are happy.”
Tony groans and brings Steve closer, thrusting harder and provoking more moans and curses from Steve’s parted lips. He can tell Steve is close and he moves faster, desperate to bring Steve over the edge first.
Steve is better the next time Tony visits. Morgan isn’t with him because she had a meltdown during the morning hours. She’s spending the day with Natasha, something Tony regrets the moment he tells Steve and catches the hurt expression on his husband’s face.
Steve ignores the order and tightens his grip around the beta’s neck, cutting off all air supply. He holds the syringe tightly and aims it for the beta’s neck.
At the sound of his name, Steve spins around, his heart sinking at what he finds. Tony is in the doorway, a bundle held tightly in his arms and a gun pressed to the side of his head. Brock Rumlow is with him, one hand holding Tony’s shoulder tightly and the other the gun digging into Tony’s temple.
The breakfast Tony prepares is nice and Steve accepts it as an apology. Tony refuses to let French toast and bacon be enough and promises that he’ll make this the best Valentine’s Day ever. Steve wishes he wouldn’t.
“No.” The response comes faster than Steve would’ve liked. It shocks Tony if the look on his face is anything to go by. “I mean...I’m not. Come on, Tony, we’ve been through this,” Steve says.
Sure enough the doors open and the beta walks in with more bags of a food. A scowl forms over his face and he comes over to set the bags down on the kitchen counter. Tony rushes into the kitchen to greet him.
Steve stays near Tony’s side the entire time, holding his hand and speaking encouraging words. Tony appreciates the comfort. Lord knows he was going to need it.
“It’s not just that. I wanted all of us to be together. I wanted my dad and now he’s...I messed it up so bad. Or...or he did. He’s so selfish.”
“Yeah,” Peter says quietly. He reaches for the paper his papa had given him and carefully smoothes out any wrinkles. “Don’t forget the spider in the center. He drew it that way.”
The day Steve comes home, Tony’s world lights up again. The darkness was gone and in its place, a vibrant, warm light appeared. The missing piece was finally put in place, completing the picture that had been broken for months.
A small smile forms over Bucky’s lips and he sniffs, his eyes filling with fresh tears. He turns away to hide them, but Peter catches the tear rolling down his face. He can’t imagine the fear and pain his uncle must be in. He had already lost one best friend and couldn’t afford losing another, especially when that friend was his husband, the love of his life.
Though he was coming around and grasping the idea of parenthood, he still had those moments of doubting both himself and his abilities. Nothing was the same since Peter was born. Steve’s life had been turned upside down. He had a new baby to care for and his relationship with Tony appeared more problematic than ever. It was like they had taken one step forward and then twenty back. Any ounce of a relationship they had left was crumbling away.
Peter immediately backpedals. He’s thought about living with his dad full time, but all it’s ever been was just an idea. Peter honestly wasn’t sure if he could move out of the compound and away from his family. There was no denying that his family would let him go. All they wanted was for him to be happy, but Peter couldn’t leave them. They’ve lost so much already.
Two people were missing from the festivities. His absence would always leave a hole. Nothing would be the same without him. All of the major holidays and birthdays would be different. Maybe in a few years the giant hole wouldn’t appear so big anymore. But for now it was huge, ready to swallow Peter up.
There was no point in kicking himself for doing something differently. It wasn’t like they could have prevented Steve from miscarrying. It was one of those things that couldn't be stopped, no matter how hard Tony wishes it was.
Steve smiles softly and pulls Tony close, holding him tightly and enjoying the comfort only he can bring. “It’s going to be fine.”
“Submit!” Steve orders, applying more pressure to the back of the alpha’s head, sharp nails digging into the flesh until the alpha is screaming again. Steve pulls his hand away, not caring that his fingers are red with the alpha’s blood.
“Come on,” he tells himself in the mirror. He’d give anything to hear one of Steve’s famous speeches. He’d give anything to have Steve.
Peter opens his eyes, fresh tears spilling from them and sets them on Bucky’s face. He frowns at the unfamiliar features.
Just thinking about the two people he couldn’t live without puts a smile on his face. They meant everything to him and he couldn’t imagine being in a world that didn’t have them in it. They were the reason he got out of bed every morning. It was Steve who held them all together; he was the glue of their family and without him, they would fall apart.
He felt disgusting in his own skin. Any ounce of confidence he ever had vanished into thin air, almost as if it was never there to begin with. He wondered how his husband could even stand the sight of him.
Steve finds the courage to peek, eyes landing on the two alphas. A third person appears, and much to Steve’s relief, he finds it’s not the head alpha, but another beta from Hydra’s lab. Usually their presence didn’t terrify the omega, but the ones that approached him didn’t usually have a syringe in their hands.
Steve lets out a shaky breath when the tears roll down his face. “I need help. I guess I thought the group and the pills were enough but...they’re not.”
Tony has already forgotten about it and he sits up, lifting his shirt over his head and tossing it on the floor to join Steve’s. Now it’s Steve’s turn to stare, and he can’t help but smile at the sight of Tony’s growing belly. Their son was getting bigger and bigger every day.
“That’s so cool! I mean, kinda. I know he was a jerk but you have to admit having him and Captain America for parents is awesome.”
Steve chokes back a sob when another contraction hits. He’s forced to push again, screaming and cursing through it all. More of the baby comes into view. He was almost done.
Steve growls and grips Alexander tightly by the front of his suit and yanks him up off the floor. “You’re a liar. All you ever told me is lies.”
“Come on, Petey. Bed time.” Steve shifts in his seat, grunting softly when he struggles to get up. Tony rises to his feet and offers Steve his hand.
Tony sighs. “Honey, sooner or later we’ll have to come forward. What about when we send the kids to school-”
Natasha winces. “You still have...three months. You sure you can wait that long? I’d get checked out.”
He doesn’t give it much thought and he quickly sheds the tight t-shirt he had chosen yesterday in exchange for the sweatshirt. It’s a little snug, especially around the middle, but it smells like Tony. It’s perfect.
“I like Peter,” Tony says and Steve peers up at him. “I mean, if you don’t then we can figure out something else and-”
“But this...this is his.” Peter touches the shield. “I’m not the person to wield it. I...I’m not him, Mr. Fury, Sir.”
The pain is gone, almost like it had never been there in the first place. All Steve can focus on is his son.
“He just likes you,” Steve tries to calm his boyfriend, that amused grin still on his face for Tony to see.
“Good.” Tony lies back down and he waves Steve away. “Go take a test. I’m sure you hoarded a bunch.”
“Aw.” Tony pretends to be hurt. “I was really hoping you’d want a fairytale wedding. I know a guy with a horse and carriage.”
Steve glances down at the plate of food, his stomach betraying him and growling at the sight of the perfectly cooked steak and potatoes. He wasn’t fed a meal like this all the time. It was a rare luxury.
He lays Morgan down in her crib and makes sure she’s comfortable before heading to the master bedroom. The door is open, giving Tony a perfect view of Steve. He’s sitting on his side of the bed, back hunched over and hands playing with something Tony can’t quite see. It’s not until he steps further into the room does he realize the object in Steve’s hand is the bottle of pills.
His first pregnancy had been unexpected and unwelcome. But then he got used to carrying new life and the joys it would bring. Hydra never let him have anything else. The pups he bore weren’t his, no matter how much he begged.
“He’s okay. Tony, he’s okay,” Steve assures and takes Tony’s hand to calm him again. “He’s being looked over.”
Steve accepts and allows Tony to lead him to the master bedroom. The bed is large enough to hold them and the scent of Tony that lingers on the sheets is comforting. Tony holds Steve close, absentmindedly rubbing his arm up and down along Steve’s arm.
He should feel safe now that he’s in the air and out of reach from the alpha that’s made his life miserable, but yet he can’t find ease. Being in an extravagant jet was something he’s never experienced. But even that was something he couldn’t find enjoyment in. All he can think about is the last time he’s been this high in the air.
“Hi.” Steve smiles down at his son, his heart bursting with joy. His son was absolutely perfect. He meant everything to him. “Daddy will be home tomorrow okay? It’s just you and me tonight. We’ll be okay, right?”
“Baby steps. I think we can manage that. We don’t have to start over. We just need to take it slow,” Steve says.
“Tony!” Steve cries out when his mate’s eyes flutter. “Tony, don’t do this. We can get out. It’s over.”
Tony struggles to keep the act up. There was only so much he could take until he broke and fucked everything up. He had already made a mess by letting Steve get too attached and too far along. The pain of losing this one was going to be the worst yet.
Peter replies quickly and shoves his phone back into his pocket. He takes it out a second later and opens up the chat, fingers hovering over the keyboard as he contemplates to tell his papa to come get him.
He finishes up and flushes the toilet, then pulls himself up on wobbly legs and moves back toward the sink to rinse his mouth out.
“Isn’t it a little late for ice cream?” Steve raises one questioning brow at her. She only smirks and peels off the lid.
followed by James and Harley yelling can be heard. Steve sighs and with his free hand, runs his fingers through his hair.
Peter gets out and Tony follows after him. They come to a door Tony knows all too well and he has to find the strength to go through it.
“I’m doing my best to be a good dad. I want him to be happy just as much as you do. If he wants to live with me-”
“It was.” Peter helps himself to the pizza and places a couple of slices on the paper plates the restaurant provided. “Disney World was our favorite place. We would go all the time.”
Tony fumbles with his belt, the excitement of getting to properly breed this omega becoming too much. He slides his slacks and underwear down, his cock bobbing free and smacking the omega’s ass. The omega groans, desperately trying to bring himself closer to the alpha’s cock.
I hope you all are doing good and had a good day! This chapter was a little on the short side but I hope you guys don’t mind. Thank you so much for reading!
“We better go. I’m sure the Avengers are freaking out about you being with me,” Tony says and he stands.
Tony grumbles some kind of response and walks away to look at another part of the store. Steve sighs and shakes his head. He couldn’t wait for the mood swings to pass.
“Not much.” Happy sets his empty plate down on the coffee table and leans back in his seat with a sigh. “Just that you’re scared. And hey, I get it. I’d be too if I was in your situation.”
“You were supposed to be mom. And if this kid is stubborn it’s your fault. Stubborn is your middle name,” Tony shoots back.
“Okay, okay.” Sam wraps an arm around Bucky’s shoulder and brings him in close, pressing a kiss to his head. “But it would be cool, right?”
Peter’s eyes fill with tears and he glances down at his feet to hide them. “Sorry,” he murmurs and wipes at his eyes.
“Hey,” Tony says softly and comes closer. He’s tempted to pull Steve into a hug, but he holds back. “It’s alright. You have nothing to apologize for. I get it.”
Steve makes sure the bag for the hospital is packed before Happy arrives. He had spent the past few weeks getting it together in case his daughter decided to come early, and now he was thankful he had been prepared. She wasn’t waiting for anyone, especially her own father.
“Yeah. I got him calm enough,” Natasha says and her eyes flicker in Tony’s direction. “Let’s see how long that lasts.”
“I don’t know!” Steve yells. “He locks me in a room and that’s when the alphas come in. That’s when we mate.”
“Okay well if you need more time than my papa’s birthday party is the best time to come. It’s still a little ways out so it gives you time to think about it, but you should totally come. We always get together and throw him a party,” Peter says, his smile brighter than before.
“I’ll call you back,” Steve says abruptly and hangs up the phone. He lowers himself down onto the closed lid of the toilet, his eyes never leaving the little window of the test.
Steve’s lips are on Tony’s the moment they’re behind closed doors. Tony allows it, welcomes it with open arms and leads Steve down the hall and toward his bedroom. If Steve’s a little rusty, he does a damn good job at not showing it. He kisses Tony with ease, lips moving effortlessly and hands running down Tony’s body.
