“Witnesses?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock jumped to his feet as Lestrade walked into the room.
Moran growled again but the two men ignored him and John left Moran in the bar. He climbed into the back seat of the saloon and was thankful it was empty. It took the car half an hour to make it across London traffic to Baker Street. John didn’t realize it was so late until he saw the empty pavements and the street lights on.
Sherlock smiled and leaned forward to kiss John’s mouth. “You are naked.”
John and Seb finally have a chance to talk but Seb can't tell him the truth.
“So who are you and why did have you as a prisoner?”
“Please don’t feel oblige to tell me that was remarkable or amazing . . . John has expressed that thought in every possible variant to English language.”
you been using? Were you using when we were together?”
An elderly man came out of the house and glared at John and his squad. He started to walk towards them, a pleading sound to his voice. A younger man in pale grey peraahan and stripped tonbaan, the long shirt and baggy trousers worn by Afghan men, came out of the house and grabbed the arm of the older man. The younger man was angry and argued with the elderly man. The older man ignored the younger man waved the soldiers over.
“The facial recognition is at ninety percent. But sir, I don’t think you should go there.” Anthea said looking up at Mycroft.
2017       John was pacing across Sherlock’s living room. He was locked in the penthouse flat. Ryan had left him after kidnapping him. John was furious. He didn’t understand why he was there, nor did he understand the comment about Seb Moran being his boyfriend. Yes, he had spent the day having sex with the man but that didn’t mean they were more than just ‘fuck buddies’. Seb was a great shag and after so many dry years, John was finally enjoying himself, or so he tried to convince himself.
Sherlock remembered the man with the flaming red hair and the sprinkling of freckles across fair skin.
Sherlock took off running. He backtracked himself in hope of reaching the Morstan. He heard the sound of running feet and glanced over his shoulder to see more than two men chasing him. Sherlock sped up and round the last pile of crates. In front of him was John with two men from the Morstan running towards him.
“Rugby?”
He took a step forward and held out his hand, but Sherlock pulled the letter back further from John’s reach.
It was rough horseplay. Full force tackles and running blocks. John’s team got the ball back after a ruck and he was off. John’s speed and experienced kept him from being stopped. He ran from one end of the field to the other – through elbows and kicks. Tackles and shouts. Whooping and laugher. James shouting John’s name the entire time.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at his brother. “Why? What have you done?”
“Get into the car, John.” The voice said.
“H. H. Holmes. An entrepreneur from the 1800’s. He build his own hotel to murder people in.”
“But John beat you to it.” Sherlock interrupted Jim.
~221~
Moran collapsed on the bench against the back wall of the cell. He didn’t answer the brigadier.
John didn’t take another punch. The first one felt good, but John knew it was mistake.
“Look, just put the bottle down.” An officer to Sherlock’s right tried to talk to the intoxicated man.
“Get out of my face.” The man growled.
“He’s been in an accident. He’s going to be okay, but you will need to come down to St. Bart’s A and E. He can’t be discharged unaccompanied.” The man on the phone said.
“That’s not what I’ve heard.” Smith tried to smile but his flabby jowls kept the corners of mouth turned down. “I want to speak to you about a proposition. A new opportunity for you.”
John followed the narrow passages until he found the room he was looking for. He tapped his foot on the vinyl flooring in lieu of having a door to knock on.
“Please, monsieur . . .”
“I wish to speak to you of Sherlock.”
John stood in the middle of the first floor flat of 221 Baker Street. It was a cross between science lab and hoarder’s lair. The furniture was worn but comfortable looking. The books on the shelves varied in subject from toxic plants to ballistics. The room smelled of coffee and tobacco but also of something sweet and warm. Like apple pies baking. Cinnamon and brown sugar. It was a smell that John could get easily used to if he would allow himself.
Several people have commented on how sympathetic Sebastian Moran is in this story. I wanted to show why he became a criminal and how his unrequited love for John has driven him insane. Don't worry, his behavior will begin to become evil by chapter ten.
Sherlock turned and looked at the man sitting at the kitchen table. He could see the man’s shirt was bloody under his open jacket. The blonde’s arm was leaning on the table, his hand resting on top of the 9 mm handgun.
“And if I don’t accommodate you?”
Jim Moriarty slowly turned and looked at the frightened attorney. Jim’s face was emotionless, but his dark eyes were wild with anger.
The March winds were blowing cold up the Thames. Every fireplace in Whitehall was blazing but the fires failed to chase the cold from the rooms. The man sat with a plaid shawl wrapped round his shoulders. He was reading the latest dispatch. He smiled as he looked over the top of the paper at Sir Sebastian Wilkes.
Sherlock lunged forward and captured John’s lips. The words repeating in his head as he tasted John’s mouth.
John stared at the man sleeping in the bed and wondered what other bruises were hidden under the hospital gown. What other atrocities had Victor done to the young man?
“Stop – roommates?” John sat up.
Sherlock turned the computer around for John to see the article.
Just before he reached him, Frankie looked up and saw Sherlock coming. Frankie said something and the other man at the table turned to look at Sherlock. There was something familiar about the man. He had dark hair and pale skin. His eye were very dark, almost black.
Sherlock ducked his head and started to follow Victor. John reached out and grabbed Sherlock’s arm.
John just stared at the man for moment. Sherlock hesitated before taking quick snatching glimpse at John. By the third glance he noticed a smile. He turned to look John straight in the face to see the deep blue eyes smiling as well as the entirety of John’s face. Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
“Not this again.” Sherlock rolled his eyes as he stood up. “John is not going away. He is staying with me. Forever if I’m lucky.”
“I told you, one question. You asked it and I answered it. Now leave.” Irene said turning away from the men and flouncing down on the couch.
John’s eyes shot up and stared at Sherlock. “I wasn’t!” The blush deepened to dark red all the way up John’s ears.
“Privateers, Captain Watson.” Mycroft corrected him.
Mary turned and grabbed John’s elbow, twisting the man to face her.
“Does Holmes know yet his brother is free?”
Sherlock knew the old lady thought of him like a son and would never let him go.
It was morning. The room was warm. The sun tried to pierce the drawn curtains but failed, giving the room a golden hue. The two men laid on top of the covers. Facing each other and naked. Fingertips slid over skin. Touches and soft strokes to assure each other this was real.
“Sherlock.” Greg Lestrade greeted the young omega.
The two men broke out in giggles.
The sun had only been over the horizon for half an hour. It had been a raucous party the night before but now the only sound was the soft snoring of the people in the bed. John Watson’s head was pounding with a hangover. He sat on the edge of the king-size bed, bare chested and unshaven. His shoulders slumped and his hair disheveled. His trouser were pulled up but not yet fastened. He was holding his boot in his hand forcing himself to find the energy to slip it on. The knock on the door didn’t even make him look up.
More gunfire brought John’s attention back to the main road. He leaned around the corner of the building and fired again. Then quickly slipped back before the enemy were able to target him.
“Which one of us do you think is the psychopath and which one is insane?” Sherlock asked coolly.
Greg shifted uncomfortably on his feet. He needed to get back to Scotland Yard and write up his report about the cigarette theft. He couldn’t be standing here dealing with Sherlock’s drug problem. But he didn’t want to leave either.
“But these are all different crimes,” John said as he pointed to one article. “Here’s a murder and there’s a robbery. This one is bank robbery and this one is a jewelry store. How can these all be connect?”
“I lovvve dancing.” John started to spin there on the pavement. He swiveled his hips and started dancing to music no one else heard.
“Good.” John said. He wanted to try and fix his watch but he knew it was too late. The saltwater had ruined it. “Let’s go.”
“Yes, we shall.” Jim’s smile returned.
“Let me work with you. I’ll teach you how to use your height in your favor. You’ve got the eye. That’s the part that can never be taught.”
“Sherlock, you need to carefully consider what I am saying to you. John will be leaving. Regardless of how you feel about it. He will be leaving and you will need to be prepared to be alone again. Don’t make the mistake as last time and take up with the first individual who smiles at you after he leaves. You did that with Victor and it resulted in years of suffering. If I were you, I would discontinue any association with John Watson before you become too attached. Now is the time to break things off, before you have taken that final step. Before you become too emotionally involved.”
“We weren’t a gang. We were member of the same unit in Her Majesty’s Army. I was his commanding officer; he was in my squad.” John’s voice hardened. He was getting angry at the civilian’s insolence.
John step back and realized the room was filling with smoke. The bed was engulfed in flames and the fire had crossed the floor and moved quickly out the door. John could hear sirens and shouts as he coughed.
John leaned around the building and fired too. The enemy returned fire and John and Blackwood took cover again. John could hear shouting and sound of running feet.
“I do. Better maybe than you know yourself. You’re not like them.” Frankie nodded his head towards the door. “You’re better than them. You survived when everyone else around you gave up. You did better than survived, you succeeded.”
Sherlock grabbed his robe and pulled it on. He stood and started to pace around the bedroom without looking at John.
“No, impossible. The only people who know you were at the scene besides myself and my assistant is you, John and the sniper. Every other person connected to the investigation has been kept ignorant of your involvement.” Mycroft stood up and started to pace.
“There were other alphas here last night who couldn’t get anyone to warm their beds and you had two in yours.” James Sholto laughed. “Three Continents Watson strikes again.”
He was slipping his coat on and heading out the door when Sherlock crashed into the flat. He was still wearing the same clothes he had left in three days earlier. He looked like he hadn’t slept the entire time he was gone. His cheeks was hollow and his eyes were sunken in with dark smudges under them. Sherlock’s long fingers twitched as he reached for the knob on the door. His fingernails were stained yellow brown. He stumbled as John leapt forward and wrapped his arms around the man. Holding him as they both slipped to the floor.
“It is irrelevant now. I have been freed from the spell that Victor had me under. Although, now that I look back on it, I’m still confused how I came to be enthralled.”
“Okay, why do you think something is off?” John asked.
“Is it done?” Jim asked.
“Is there a specific reason?”
“No, I told you, I’m not my own person.” Sherlock pushed up on his knees as John’s arms fell away from him.
Sherlock’s own eyes unable to focus as tears swelled and slipped from them. There was just one more step Sherlock needed to take. Carefully he cupped John’s cheek and twisted John’s face up towards his. They looked at each other through tears. Then leaned into each other and kissed. The warm brush of skin to skin. The slight taste of menthol and tea.
“I don’t exactly know. But sailors say it’s a good omen to see it.” John stepped down a few stepped but remained on the stairs.
A man came forward with a leather flogger. A stiff wooden handle with numerous leather strips dangling from it. Some of the leather strips had sharp-edged metal spurs tied to them. This was a weapon that would flay flesh from a man’s body.
“You know that is very disconcerting.” John said, give a weak laugh.
“Broken bottle,” Sherlock said as his hand wandered up John’s body.
“I am afraid that you are not qualified to be a judge . . . detective was it?” Mycroft Holmes said. His umbrella grasped in his hand while two very large men stood in the hallway behind him.
He lowered the lid as the door opened. He saw a man walk in carrying a lit oil lamp. The man held the lamp up as he scanned the room. He went to the small door that led out to the balcony behind the ship. He opened the door and held the lamp out in front of him.
John rolled his shoulders off the wall and twisted himself closer to Sherlock. Without hesitation he leaned in and lightly kissed the omega’s pouty lips. Sherlock’s lips were cool to the touch, and slightly chapped. They were sweet tasting – like brown sugar and cinnamon. Slowly, John pulled back. His eyes fixed on Sherlock’s, waiting to see what the unusual omega would do next.
Without hesitation, John went around the bar and grabbed two squat ‘double old fashion’ glasses. He walked over to Frankie’s table and hopped up onto the dais. He sat down as Frankie held out the bottle and poured John a glass of the amber liquid.
For a moment, John could see the omega wavier. Almost submit. Then he watched as Sherlock regained himself. It was amazing to John. He had never seen an omega able to withstand his dominance before. Sherlock’s expression turned neutral as he held John’s glare. John could tell the omega was thinking. It was almost as if he could see a million calculations taking place behind those variegated eyes.
Greg pulled sheets of paper out of the file folder. He held it where John could read it.
“He must be.” Sherlock said.
“All night?” Sherlock’s whispered question rumbled between them.
John opened his mouth to speak, but then the words were choked off deep in his throat. He couldn’t prove Victor had beat up Wilderbrant. He couldn’t accuse the man of doing it even if he believe deeply he had done so. John hung up the phone. He couldn’t leave a message. He didn’t know what to do. He started to walk. And he kept on walking for the next five hours.
“Who?” Sherlock asked. “Who was it?”
“The exhibit was in the back of the gallery?”
Sherlock knew he had no one else to blame but himself. He knew he had sent John away. It was what John would have wanted. It was what he had done with every other omega he had slept with. John was an alpha. He didn’t feel the same as the omega did. He wasn’t as deeply affected. Or that was what Sherlock told himself.
Standing on the far side of the room was a stranger, leaning on an expensive looking umbrella. He wore a grey three-piece suit and a pale blue tie. He was tall, maybe even taller than Sherlock. His hair was auburn and thinning. There was a superiority attitude about him and he was glaring at Sherlock.
Bill Murry is the name Arthur C. Doyle used in the story "A Study in Scarlett". It was the name he gave the man who saved John's life. The names of Blackwood and Hinde come from the wonderful "Two Two One Bravo Baker" story of Abundantlyqueer.
“Orders to report? But why?”
“You’re being childish, Sherlock. Give me those scissors.” John growled.
Mycroft Holmes hated excuses.
“Spot on. I can’t believe it.” John let go of Sherlock’s shirt.
“You’re not so bad.”
The king sneezed and pulled his shawl tighter. “I doubt it.”
Mycroft sat waiting, wondering if Sherlock would die before he could finally help him. Before he would save him. Mycroft never felt more useless than he did in that moment. More useless than he felt standing next to his parents open grave, not knowing what to do next. More useless than he felt when he saw his nine-year-old brother frightened and alone in a hospital bed.
It took a moment for the simple word to register with Mycroft. “What? No? Sherlock don’t make me . . .”
“Don’t let them scare you, John. I can call you John can’t I? I mean we are in a friendly game.” Mary’s voice was soft and warm.
“Sherlock?”
Magnussen leaned back and laughed again. Sherlock’s normal arrogant expression was replaced with fear. Magnussen let go of Sherlock’s other wrist and the omega quickly pulled on the door handle, but the door didn’t open. Magnussen laughed louder.
“A list of what I had taken . . . just in case. So he would know what to do.” Sherlock continued. “He said he would always be there for me. He would always protect me. He lied.”
“No, it’s fine. It’s not the first time Dimmock has paid me a visit.” Sherlock said as he sighed.
“My hands?! He was the one touching me, not the other way around. And why would I be interested in McMath anyway?”
“Tell me again how you found this?”
John opened it and read through the basic background information before he glanced at the name. A ridiculous fear of meeting someone else from his past moved through him. He gripped his cane and took two steps towards the treatment room. Then he paused and removed the paper with Greg’s mobile number on it. He glanced at it for a moment, then wadded the paper up and binned it.
“Shut it.” John snapped and pulled Sherlock down the hallway.
John pulled a woman from the lap of man sitting at the table. The man started to complain but saw the anger in John’s eyes and sat back down. John gave the woman a deep kiss. She easily wrapped her arms around the blonde’s neck and returned the kiss.
“I’m going to bond.”
“Where did you go?” Dimmit asked.
Moriarty glanced over at the troll. Culverton Smith was panting. His face was flushed and his eyes didn’t appear focused. A delicate gloss of sweat highlighted his broad forehead. He shivered slightly. It was almost as if he had climaxed. Murder was never that important to Moriarty. It was just something he needed to do. Something to tick off the list of things to do, but Culverton Smith seemed to get a physical pleasure from killing another human being.
“No, he’s in hospital under arrest. Now back to the question about you.” Dimmock rushed forward and kicked Sherlock in the stomach. The dark haired man doubled over again.
“There must be some reason why it would be so important to do so. Who ordered it?”
Trudy raised an eyebrow and then shrugged. John looked quickly at the intake notes. He didn’t care about the name of the patient. He concentrated on the symptoms and any lab results that were available.
Guilt pushed into John’s mind. He had told Mycroft he would protect Sherlock. But how was he to know that Sherlock would be used by Moriarty against Mycroft? That his past crimes would prevent his future happiness. Sherlock knew John was a thief. He knew John was a criminal but did he know how much of a villain he really was?
“Thank you, dear. You may leave now.” Mycroft smiled insincerely at the young woman. She turned to leave when Mycroft spoke up. “Make sure that Mathis verifies both shipments and has a complete checked manifest to me before the end of the day.”
“You shouldn’t say such things to me. I find it hard to not . . . want you. In every possible way.”
Sherlock glanced down at his mate. John’s face was stern, but his bright blue eyes were warm with affection. The fingers protruding from John’s bandaged hand lightly brushed against the back of Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock look back up at the nurse and saw the shocked expression on her face. Her mouth was open as if she was frozen in mid tirade.
“Would you be willing to do it again?”
“Were you injured together?” Sherlock asked. He didn’t recognize his own voice. It sounded hollow to his ears.
Holmes quickly dropped the gun and rushed forward to John. Dipping to his knees, he wrestled the explosive vest off the man.
John knew he should be angry. He knew he punch the poncy bastard in the nose. But he couldn’t. He was utterly amazed by Sherlock’s observations and deductions.
Seb growled when he was restricted by John’s shirt from kissing lower. He pulled roughly at the fabric, tearing a button free. It clattered to the floor as John gasped. Seb’s lips closing over one of John’s nipples.
That evening after everything had calm down from the CIA agents whom had attacked Mrs. Hudson had been dealt with, after Lestrade left with the ambulance and the police, John came up to the flat. Sherlock was standing at the window, his violin in his hands. The alpha’s long fingers were testing the strings as he pointedly did not look at his bond mate.
“You honestly think Mycroft will ever let me leave here. No. This is my prison from now on until the ‘thunderclap’ of doom’s day.” Sherlock sulked.
“Then you will listen to me?” John felt the urge to tease the alpha.
“I have waited for this . . . waited to have you for my own . . . as soon as you are well enough to travel we are going to disappear. I’ve been squirreling away money waiting till we could escape.”
“I believe that someone is trying to force Mycroft to influence the king and queen to make mistakes. Mistakes that will cost them their crowns. Maybe even bring James back from exile.”
“I can see why.” Jim said. He stood up and pulled a small automatic from his pocket. He dragged his index finger over the sights on the barrel.
“It appears, John that Moriarty is not done with you yet.” Mycroft said to him over the phone.
“Don’t embarrass yourself, Mycroft. We all know that you don’t do anything yourself. Never dirty your hands. You have people do things for you. And your people can’t get to me.” Then Victor turned towards John. “And Watson is hardly any threat.”
John stood over Sherlock on the stairs. Something that rarely ever happened. In the blue light from St. Elmo’s fire, Sherlock’s features took on the ethereal appearance of Shakespeare’s Ariel. Sharp cheekbones covered by pale skin. Silver eyes and black halo of curls. Plump lips that in the blue light appeared dark red.
“I didn’t push Gregory away. I let him make the decision to leave.” Mycroft said with a forced lightness to the tone of his voice. Sherlock raised an eyebrow questioning his brother silently. “He believed my reputation was unearned. It was the reason he agreed to start a relationship with me. I left some incriminating information out where Gregory would easily see it. The documents he found proved I was involved in criminal activities and that I was using him for information. He became enraged and left me.”
“He was nine years old. He was a child when you became his guardian.” John snapped.
“This ‘ere gun says we don’t care what you be wanting.” The man waved the gun under Sherlock’s nose.
“What?”
Just then John noticed the dark haired man from earlier, run out of the building. He was shouting something about ‘
“He didn’t send me after you.” John said hoping to mitigate the betrayal coming.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and resumed his bored attitude. “You’re being obtuse again, John. Of course with me. In this bed. Here.” He waved his arms over the mattress.
“I was at New Scotland Yard. I was in an interview room waiting for the paperwork to be completed for my release when Gregory Lestrade came in. He told me the police had received a call of a dead body. It was our mother.”
“I’m not investigating the assault on Lenard Wilderbrant. I’m investigating the murder of Victor Trevor.”
Mycroft gazed down on the blonde haired boy with the big sapphire blue eyes. The next words Mycroft was about to say were trapped in his throat. He shook his head thinking maybe he needed to clear his vision. There should be a thin, pale, dark haired male on the couch, not a solid, tan, fair haired boy.
“Witness protection will be difficult but as long as you are with me, I will be fine.” Sherlock said as he leaned forward to kiss John’s neck. “Besides, Lestrade has started sending me cold cases to solve. He thought I would be good at it. So far I’ve been able to unravel three.”
“Where is Captain John Watson?” Moran growled.
He lapped more as Sherlock twisted and moaned wantonly above him. John pushed his tongue into the slick and was reward with Sherlock’s gasp and yelp.
Mycroft Holmes rolled his eyes. He was needed at Whitehall. He couldn’t be wasting his valuable time here arguing with his brother.
The attending took John by the elbow and pulled him away from the bed and out of earshot of the other students.
John looked down at the cut off shirt and the short shorts. “Yes, Frankie Oskar’s idea not mine.”
“A guard would have access to the security system but couldn’t walk into a hospital room without making the patient weary. It was a two man job. And the man doing the actual murder wore cufflinks. That wouldn’t be an orderly. No, it was someone who no one thought of as a threat.”
“Was there anything else with it? A letter? A threat?”
“There is no risk for me.” Sherlock sighed exasperated. “Honestly, one would think you dealt with an addict or something.”
“Why would Sholto be at the Enclave?” asked Dimmit.
“Absolute not. You could be targeted to be used against me. And I would have thought you would show some sign of brotherly concern that I’m a target for a bullet.”
Lady Smallwood held out her hand and Mycroft dutifully took it and shook it gently. He felt the sudden squeeze of Lady Smallwood’s diminutive hand. ‘
“You okay?” John asked into the purple skin.
“But not every citizen is responsible for maintaining the security of her secrets. So many secrets.” Magnussen droned on. Mycroft waited. “Secrets that if her enemies learned about, could easily compromise that safety.”
“You idiot.” John growled. He turned and walked out of the treatment room. His hand gripped the cane so tight his knuckles turned white.
Sherlock thought back to his conversation with Frankie. Jim was a client of Victor. Victor helped Jim ‘hide’ his money. The more pieces slipped into place. Money for drugs. Drugs for money. If Victor had cheated Jim either with drugs or money both would be a motive for murder. And if Jim was sending a message out to others, the beating before the murder would be it.
“Tell me,” John prompted.
John woke up the next morning with his head hurting and the confusion as to where he was. There was music playing in the other room. It must have been a radio on some classical station. The bed was comfortable and the sheets smelled very familiar. John laid there a moment wondering where he was and more importantly, what had happened to his clothes. He only had his boxers on under the covers. He pulled the sheets back and slowly pulled himself to his feet. The world tipped sideways for a moment and he wondered if he was going to be sick. John collapsed back down onto the mattress and waited for the room to quit spinning.
“My brother and his sniffer dogs.” Sherlock said as he stepped closer to John. In the partial light Sherlock couldn’t exactly tell the color of John’s eyes but there were other things he could deduce.
“I do have some other choice things to say to him, but I don’t wish to embarrass you with the vulgar language.”
“Yes,” Blackwood licked his dry lips. He glanced around the empty deck of the sinking ship. “He was a Midshipman on the Maywand.”
Sebastian Moran hated the house. Appledore was a monstrosity. It seemed the house couldn’t decide if it was a greenhouse, a lighthouse or a bunker. All the windows surrounding former soldier made Moran nervous. Too many site lines for a sniper. The curving walls and half buried portions of the building added to the surrealism of the structure. It was disorientating for Moran and made him want to blow the place up.
Sherlock started to pace up the hall away from John’s room. He didn’t want John to overhear them.
Moran felt the tightness in his spine and burning need grow brightly. He rocked his hips up into hand, imagining it was Sherlock. The omega riding his cock. Begging to be claimed again and again.
“Excuse me but you did reserve this room. We received the specific request for theses rooms from your office.” The hotel manager corrected Mycroft.
Today, Moran and his squad were walking through small village near the foothills leading west. The town had been a strong hold for resistance fighters but no combatants had been seen in the area for six months now. Moran and three of his men were walking in lose formation down the main road on the town. Not so much a road as a clear strip between rows of mud brick houses. The other four men in the squad were just outside the collection of houses to the south of Moran. John was with Moran walking about eight feet behind the Colonel.
“Yes it would. He’s a criminal. You said so yourself. You are too intelligent to fall into that trap, Sherlock.” John sat up too. He felt his world was beginning to spin out of control. He was terrified he was about to lose Sherlock. “You say you love me, then you can be honest with me.”
“Sherlock . . .”
Sherlock refused to escort him out. He stood in the center of the room. He glanced up and looked down the hallway at his bedroom’s closed door. For a brief moment, he wondered if it still smelled of John and himself. If anything of their night together remained. Sherlock blinked back his tears as he went to go get ready.
“To see John?”
“It doesn’t matter.”
“Denied,” Bennett said, cutting John off. “You need to be here in case we are called out.”
“What are you going to do to Jim?” Sherlock asked only out of curiosity.
John took his time as he covered Sherlock’s body in petal pink love-bites. Across his chest and down his abdomen. He hesitated over Sherlock’s groin, looking up into Sherlock’s expectant face. A sinister smile came to John’s lips as he sat back. He eased off the bed and grabbed Sherlock’s ankles. Twisting suddenly, he flipped Sherlock over onto his stomach. The omega shouting at the suddenness of being manhandled. John bounced back on to the bed. Caging Sherlock beneath himself. John nipped at the back of Sherlock’s thighs as he massaged the globes of Sherlock’s backside.
Sherlock and John turned to looked at him.
The man’s eyes scanned up and down John bare chest and exposed legs. Even though John had a towel wrapped protectively around his waist, he felt completely naked under that man’s scrutiny.
Doctor Aubrey Humphrey was a lanky tall American with a pronounced Texas accent. He walked with such loose joints, that he looked like he was moments from falling to the ground boneless. His skin was tan and leathery. It seemed being in the sun and the desert was normal for him. His pale blue eyes easily squinted whenever he stepped outside. A trait he learned to guard his eyes from bright sunlight. He talked slow and dragged out his vowels. He like to talk and tell stories about his life back in Texas. But in the operating room, no one moved faster. He was an excellent surgeon.
John leaned forward again for another kiss. More languid and unhurried. Sherlock reached down and lightly stroked over the bulge in John’s breeches. John groaned and plunged his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth.
To Lady Smallwood’s surprise, it wasn’t Mycroft Holmes whom did enter, but Culverton Smith. The small man immediately started apologizing for intruding.
“I’ll put it away if you are honest with me. If I catch you in another lie, it comes back out. And by the way, I got very good with a gun while I was in the army. You should see how good I got.” John smiled.
Magnussen smiled. “Unmolested.”
“Yes, I did. Is that a problem?” John asked. John suddenly wanted to kiss Sherlock again. He watched Sherlock to see if there was any resentment towards the earlier kiss. Sherlock’s silvery blue eyes were clear and sharp.
“No, I didn’t see you walk pass the window or no, you are not checking him out?”
“The ‘smash and rob’ was a diversion. The kids were working with the thief.” Greg said.
“The Woman.” John said.
“How was patrol?” James asked.
The Scotland turned further away as it fired again on the Lone Star. The pirate ship shattered. Planks of wood and canvas flew up into the air as the stricken ship limbed towards Hassel Island to sink in the shallow waters.
“You gave me a job. Did you think I would be a criminal like him?” asked John.
Moriarty laughed. “Well . . . yes he is. We are bonded . . . but that didn’t stop him from wanting you.”
The other man took a deep sigh. He had heard this rant before. If he wasn’t positive he could manipulate James after his return to England, he would have killed the king himself.
“So we start there. We sail to Barbados and you give us the two thousand pounds. We buy supplies for the trip and then sail to England.”
Sherlock sat up and watched as the Vengeance took fire. The white canvas sails were suddenly shredded. The Vengeance fired again. This time the cannon balls hit the side of the Morstan. The lead balls crashed through the side of the ship and into the lower decks.
John Watson woke up with a splitting headache. He was laying on a bed with blonde prostitute beside him. Her naked body plastered next to his. He was sticky and sweaty and certain he was two steps towards the grave.
Suddenly, John had an image of Simon and David standing over dead bodies. John collapsed down onto Sherlock’s body and sighed. “I can just see the headlines now.”
John’s un-bandaged wrist was cuffed to the bedrail. He glowered at it as he yanked on it once. A police officer stood as sentry at the door of John’s hospital room, but the man was unnecessary because Detective Greg Lestrade was standing in the room, glaring at both John and Sherlock.
“I don’t mean to criticize but I believe she can no longer hear you. She’s dead. Has been for the last two minutes.”
“Even if that is true. I still refuse to allow it.” Mycroft said firmly.
“Sorry, Colonel . . . I guess it’s the hormones. I didn’t mean to . . .”
“Can you handle a gun?” Sholto asked as he looked carefully at John.
“Wrong man!” Sherlock growled. “Tourist.”
Sherlock gave a salacious smile and turned back to the bedroom. He reached for his dressing gown, then instead grabbed the sheet from the bed. Wrapping it around himself like a Julian Toga, Sherlock reappeared in the front room with John and Mycroft. An air of superiority around him.
“There are two possibilities. First, it was just a coincident that John is now dating one of Moriarty’s men. But . . .”
“No, James. He shot me and took John. We need to get him back.”
Greg went to the kitchen and opened the cupboard. He pulled two beers down and twisted off their caps. Tossing the caps in the general direction of the bin, he spoke. “Dimmit is sure one of you is guilty. The guess is one of you shot Trevor and the other is alibiing the killer.”
“You look ridiculous in the robe? Have you seen how you look now?” John could feel his groin filling out.
“You lied to me.”
Sherlock saw a shift in John’s eyes. “No.”
“Sherlock, quit being so emotional. It really detracts from your ability to think.” Violet snapped at her son.
“There is a Holmes omega.”
“Yes. Your brother?” John asked.
“I stole it.” Sherlock said turning away from the angry doctor. He stood up and stomped over to another chair and flounced down into it.
“We were exiled there by King James. Mycroft went against him when the king dissolved Parliament. We were not allowed to leave Bridgetown until James fled England and William and Mary recalled Mycroft.”
Sherlock stood under the hot water. He placed his forearm across the tile wall and leaned his face into it. The hot water sprayed across his back and ran in rivulets down his arms and legs. It felt wonderful. The warm moist air smelled of generic soap and the scent of the alphas who lived there. Sherlock could pick out John’s scent over that of the other alpha. It was warm and spicy, almost exotic. Sherlock took a deep breath, savoring the taste of John’s scent. It tingled all the way down his spine.
John stepped closer to the bed and lightly touched the back of Sherlock’s hand. His fingertip smoothing over a large bruise.
“Sherlock, quit being so juvenile and get up from there.”
John stood, he fist balled ready to fight. “I don’t give a shite if you are a cop or not! You can’t fucking be here and do that!”
“Sebastian Moran is the name of the guard?”
“No.” Sherlock stood. “Magnussen was supposed to discredit you, Mycroft. Use the thumb drive to prove you failed to keep government secrets safe.”
“Fuck, what’s up your arse!?” The corporal shouted into the dirt.
John couldn’t help himself, he laughed. “Okay, but really? He is interested in me? I mean, it’s probably just because I was there to help him after he was beat up so badly.”
“Yes . . . you’ll see. I’m being honest with you. We are good together. We don’t have to be playthings for them. I’ll take care of you. I’ll keep you safe.”
Sherlock turned and looked at the Scotland. The fires were out and the men were lowering the long boats into the water.
John pressed his tongue to Sherlock’s lower lip and the younger man opened his mouth. John’s tongue swept in, and licked and caressed Sherlock’s. The younger man moaned and the vibrations traveled through John’s body down to his cock.
She stared at him and then smiled. “I believe you, Mister Holmes.”
Suddenly, Sherlock heard the sound of a ringing bell as the ship tipped to the right. The wooden masts groaned as the wind shifted in the sails. Men started to shout and the sound of running feet could be heard.
Sherlock breathed in the smoke and tried to focus on any physical changes he felt. Wiggins took the pipe back and laid down smoking it. Sherlock laid his head down the pillows and closed his eyes. He couldn’t exactly say he felt different at first. His lungs burned from the smoke and his throat felt raw. Then he noticed a slight tingling to his lips. A lightness to his limbs.
“No, but you can take us to your office and let us have access to the computer. We can look at the evidence logged into the computer system and I will be able to discover who the real criminal is.” Sherlock said.
“And none of that ‘yes, sir, no, sir’ crap out here. And don’t fucking salute me. I don’t want to get shot because some Taliban sniper sees I’m an officer.”
“A through and through. Caliber?”
John grabbed the edge of the table with both fists. His knuckles were turning white with anger.
Sherlock wanted to rush forward and stop the man. He wanted to pulled John into his arms and hold him. Kiss him and never let him leave again. That’s all he wanted to do, but he didn’t move. The game was moving forward and John was too valuable a piece on the board to remove from play just yet.
“I didn’t get to – you know – thank you for saving my life. I was supposed to take care of you and keep you safe but I was told you stopped the Humvee you were in. If you hadn’t then the two vehicles would have been hit. More of us would have died. Then you knew where to direct the fire. It was amazing. You’re amazing.” James could feel his skin warm again.
The car stopped at the light and John pulled the door handle but it was still locked and he was unable to escape.
“Yes. If you wanted dear little Johnny Boy left alive, you would have to shoot yourself in front of your brother.”
Sherlock stared at the photo he had stolen from the file about the armored car robbery. He knew Lestrade could get another copy if he needed to, but he hoped the policeman wouldn’t notice it was missing.
“Upsetting the crew or upsetting you. You’re lonely, John. You need someone.”
“The sharks are already circling. Moriarty had convinced so many people he ran everything, many people think it is up for grabs. I’ve made arrangements. No one will look for me.”
John looked back into the smug expression on the omega’s face. Not two minutes earlier they had witness the murder of Magnussen, and now Sherlock wanted to take on his alpha brother. John felt a wave of admiration for the crazy man hit him. He returned Sherlock’s smile, and hand in hand, the two took off running.
“Tell me what happened to James Sholto? Who shot him?”
James screamed as the first finger was shoved into him. He squeezed his eyes tight. Tears slipped out and clung to his black eyelashes. He clawed at the sheets and tried to wiggle away. Moran held him tight and wouldn’t let him escape. By the time the second finger slid in, the omega’s slick was covering Moran’s fingers and beginning to run down the omega’s thighs. He tried to push up again but Moran slapped James’ arse cheek. The loud crack of hand to skin sounded like a gunshot. Moriarty yelped then moaned seductively. He wiggled his arse as Moran kneeled up and opened the front of trousers.
Sherlock walked out of the bedroom and saw the file Mycroft had given him. The file with Captain John Watson’s name on it. He pouted again. His finger grazed over the top cover. All he had to do was open the file and start to read about the man who was now floating through Sherlock’s subconscious. His thumb and forefinger closed over the corner of the file, ready to lift it when he stopped.
“But John was with me,” demanded Sherlock. “There was no way he could have murdered Sholto.”
Sherlock’s phone pinged again, another message was coming through. He quickly opened the text believing it was from Raz. It wasn’t. It was a photo of John, dressed in his hospital gown. The omega was sitting on a floor somewhere dingy. Moran was cradled in his arms. The thin gown was shifted and John’s thigh and waist were exposed to the camera. Moran was laying his head on the omega’s lap. John’s arms were wrapped around the man’s shoulders. .
Suddenly the radio crackled and a new and different voice is heard.
Mycroft’s eyes bloomed wide. “I don’t see . . .”
Sebastian Moran sat in the flat across from the Chinese woman’s flat. The window was open and the cold air had over taken the room. After years in the desert, Moran considered the cold air a blessing and relished the feel of it.
“Seb? What’s happened?” John whispered as he studied the commander.
Mycroft nodded his head and turned to leave. Sherlock had already be placed in the backseat of his car. The next stop was rehab for the young man. And for Mycroft . . . a bottle of brandy.
“Fuck off.” John growled at the man. “Get out of here before I call the cops.”
“John, face it. You may not think you’re gay, but that doesn’t stop you from lusting after Sherlock.” Mike added.
The ‘Flash Bang’ was loud – concussive loud. The bright flash blinded the four men, and the non-lethal explosion disoriented everyone in standing in the hall. Sherlock was thrown backwards away from Moran. Moran was pushed into a wall. His head hit the wall, adding to his concussion. The other two men were knocked off their feet. Their hands wrapped tightly around their ears as the roar of the ‘bang’ persisted.
John and Sherlock drove away before any of Mycroft’s surveillance team had the opportunity to identify them. When it was over, the members of the elite SAS team weren’t even sure what had happened.
“You are insane.” Sherlock said calmly picking up his coffee cup again. He took another sip, keeping his eyes focused on anything other than Moriarty.
“What? Wait, you went through my stuff?!”
“Neither did James Sholto.” John whispered.
James turned back to John and looked at him suspiciously. “If that’s true, you should be with some sniper unit or the Commandos.”
“James shot me. I doubt he would be willing to trade me for John . . . But . . .” He looked up at Sherlock as his hand slowly moved towards the gun.
“I was just driving by and thought I would offer a ride to an acquaintance.”
“You are going to be my pet soldier . . . Holmes has his . . . I will have mine.”
Sherlock forced himself to not react to the statement. He wanted to scream . . . to lash out, but he couldn’t. Not yet and not at John.
Greg and Mycroft try to separate Sherlock and John.
“Do you have a . . . close relationship with this Wilderbrant?” Sherlock asked.
John’s eyes glanced up to see Sherlock turned threequarters away from him. His naked backside visible to anyone standing in the doorway. John’s eyes traveled down the sinewy back to Sherlock’s narrow waist then his plump and round arse. The man’s legs were long and muscular but not overly so. It was the body of a long-distance runner. Slim, powerful, and lean.
There was a second knock on the door and the again the door was opened by the man dressed in the red and gold coat. He held the door open as Greg Lestrade entered the expensive study.
Sherlock imagined John standing there as water ran down his strong body. Over his arms and legs as it conformed to outlines of his muscles. Sherlock wondered if John would be as tanned on his upper body as his face and hands were. Would there be a stark tan line at his waist? Would his well-muscled backside be pale white? Would it be as round and defined as it looked in the jeans he wore?
John heard the sound of high heels walking across the concrete floors.
“I’ll be back before you know it.” John said. He glanced around the platform and saw other soldiers walking towards the newly arrived train. “It will be fine.”
“I’m sorry . . .”
Then he had to listen to Sherlock’s accusations. He was aware of Sherlock’s piques of anger and childishness, but this was different. He heard the pain in his brother’s voice. Pain that he had caused. It was regrettable but necessary he told himself, but the words and realization of it didn’t remove the burning sensation in his chest.
“This guy needs to be the first to go down.” John said calmly. “Then we need to take the others out simultaneously.”
“Caught Johnny Boy entertaining Tiger. Don’t bother looking for him. I’ll take good care of him.”
When Sherlock realized John was actually hunting Jefferson Hope for his own reasons and for a different victim, it hurt. He refused to focus on the reasons behind that hurt. He refused to acknowledge that the soldier had so quickly breached his emotional walls.
Irene cocked her head to the side and stared at him. “You are not the first man to ever say that to me.”
“No.”
Greg glanced at the doctor.
“Bothered? Don’t you think he would want to know? Don’t you think he would care?” Greg asked.
John stepped back. “Sorry, but I don’t want something that’s just because we are here.”
John, surprised to realize he was still embracing the younger man, let go of him and took a step back. The man dusted himself off then grabbed the suitcase back from John.
“Lestrade.” Greg held out his warrant card for the officer to see. The PC nodded his head and held the crime scene tape up.
“Hey, dinner should be ready in less than ten minutes. Are you okay?” John asked still stirring the risotto. He knew he couldn’t leave it or it would burn.
John realized Sherlock was as nervous as he was. It seemed to give him courage to know they were both on equal footing.
“Does it have to be?”
“I am an omega with singular wants and desires.” Moriarty leaned forward and brushed his lips over Moran’s then quickly pulled back. Moran growled and pulled the smaller man closer to his chest. Moriarty pushed back.
Moran heard the slam of the door opening and closing. The dark haired man step into the empty room. Tall and skinny in a black suit. The light shimmering off the blue pool water illuminated the detective’s face.
“You will sleep in the bed. You need the rest to heal. It is important.” John insisted.
“Liar.” John glowered at the man.
Why was Sherlock so ignorant? He had thought Mycroft was speaking of his virginity. Something he never considered valuable but yet something he had maintained even though many had wanted to claim it. But what John took was something far more valuable and far more enigmatic than what some ludicrously called Sherlock’s innocence. John Watson, soldier and healer, took Sherlock’s heart.
“When your brother came in he was awfully close to death. We gave him the opiate antagonist and his vitals improved rapidly, but he was still quite distraught. Begging to be left alone. He was delusional. He was despondent when he finally came around. Your brother needs help. He is a broken man. I’ve seen the cigarettes burns on his arms. I saw his medical record. He was in an abusive relationship wasn’t he?”
“He’s a good man. He loves me.” John blurted out.
“He’s a criminal, John.” Sherlock said calmly. John glanced back up at the other boy. “He is one of the most dangerous men in all of England.”
“If anyone else found that phone they would have ignored that text. But the murderer would panic.”
“I don’t think so . . . do you?” Irene said watching John as he realized of what he had said for Sherlock to hear.
James was gone and John was in the kitchen washing up the morning dishes when Sherlock came out of the bathroom. John was expecting Sherlock to be dressed in the robe again, but instead he was draped artistically in a bedsheet. His damp curls were coifed into a dark halo around Sherlock’s head. His long neck and graceful sloping shoulder were on display as the fold of the sheet slipped down. Adonis or some other Greek god came to mind as John watched him.
"Sebastian Moran was perfect for me. He gave me what I craved. He was strong and handsome. He was tolerant of my eccentricities. He let me fuck him . . .” Moriarty’s face contorted in anger.
Sherlock simply smirked at John.
“WHAT?!”
“He was my commanding officer in Afghanistan. I was meeting up with a member of Her Majesty’s army.”
Mary knelt at her husband’s feet and helped put his shoes on as numerous advisors and Lords came into the room.
Mycroft glanced away from Sherlock, relieved that his younger brother was not watching him. He didn’t believe he could conceal the lie from him.
“Yes,” John regretted telling the PC. “Victor Trevor. I think he works at some bank in the City.”
Mycroft moved and quickly put on his coat. “I want the name of his attending physicians by the time I get there.”
“Doctor Watson-Holmes.” The man said in a deep public school accent.
“Did you murder my mother?” Mycroft tried to not glare at the man.
“It’s you, isn’t it? You look just like her.” Violet narrowed her eyes at the man. Her voice took on a hardness they hadn’t heard before.
John hesitated and looked at the omega. Sherlock’s eyes shifted from John’s to the gun in his hand. John knew how dangerous Jim Moriarty was.
“On your couch? Or should I expect a dog bed in the kitchen?” John jeered.
~221~
“The hormones . . . the pup?”
“But Sherlock, a phone? I mean, I can’t . . .” John’s eyes were still locked on the phone when he noticed something odd about Sherlock’s wrist.
Sherlock closed the book again and looked at John.
“Do they have to be?”
Greg entered the room first. John glanced over his shoulder as the second police officer followed them in. He stood at the door blocking any possible escape for John. Greg stepped closer to the bed and flopped a file folder down on the crisply made bed. Glossy black and white photos spilled out as well as several type written reports.
“Don’t.”
John’s fingers were slowly stroking through the fine dark hair of his pup. His face was round and William already had the same cupid bow lips as his alpha. John watched as William pouted his lips as he drank hardily.
“What Sherlock?”
John swam as hard as he could. He knew the other man wouldn’t make it to safety before he ran out of strength. He skimmed along the surface as his eyes kept track of the drowning man. When he noticed the man go under and not resurface, John dove under the water.
John brought his hand up and cupped Sherlock’s cheek. His thumb dragged across Sherlock’s eyebrow.
Mycroft’s hand slipped into his pocket. He felt the stiff note card that was given to him with the room key for the Infinity Suite.
“You are to me.” John quickly replied.
“Alright.” Greg wasn’t sure what had happened but he knew better than to push the omega. “Tomorrow morning, first thing, my office.”
Sherlock couldn’t stop the smile that came to his face. He grabbed both sides of John’s face and kissed the man firmly.
“I’m giving you an order.” Sholto shouted.
“Thank you, John. That is very interesting.” Mycroft turned to leave.
John thought about James during those long and lonely months he was in the hospital. He thought about what he would say to James. He wondered if James would be happy to hear from him or angry. There had been no word from his unit. He hadn’t heard from anyone in Sangin. It hurt. John felt so very alone. After one incredibly difficult afternoon when he fell twice because of his weak leg, John realized he would never speak to James again. He knew he wouldn’t marry James when he was healthy and had a future as a soldier. Now that he had neither, he refused to be a burden on the man.
It was all too much for the man. He tossed his mobile on the counter and fled. He knew where he had to go. What he was going to do. Within an hour he had his first hit of heroin. He had money and he knew how to make himself forget.
“Sherlock,” John took Sherlock’s arm then addressed Dimmit. “Look, we don’t know anything about Trevor’s death. Yeah, we didn’t like him. We had good reason not to. Ask Sergeant Greg Lestrade, he was the reporting officer when Trevor assaulted Sherlock.”
“Wales? Not England? How long was I unconscious?”
John blushed slightly. “Well, he is – precious that is. I mean have you ever listened to how to figure things out. How observant he is. It’s remarkable.”
He was still wearing the hospital gown they had changed him into after William was born. William! John quickly looked around the room but his son was not in there with him. He tossed the covers off his legs and tried to stand. His legs quickly gave out underneath him and he crashed to the floor. His head was pounding. He thought he was going to throw up.
“That’s not what I mean. Are you going to talk to him about what happened between the two of you? You were terrified he’d get shot.”
“I know but that is what is in the formula. Powdered sulfur mixed into a black drawing agent. Mike, our ship’s doctor said he’s used all he had.”
John fought and screamed in his dreams but no one came to help him. No one stopped Underwood. Not even when John had pulled the trigger on the gun pointed at the brute. Underwood picked up his sword and ran it through Barr’s body.
“Have you decided what you are going to do next, Colonel?”
“I don’t sell drugs!” John shouted and stood up. “How dare you make such an accusation!”
“Sherlock! You have just under gone major surgery. Stay in bed!” Mycroft growled at his younger brother.
Sherlock has two unexpected visitors.
“I don’t know. Somehow he knows when to show up.”
“I was waiting to see how you would react.” James said as he sat down. He had a plate of toast and jam in hand. A cup of steaming tea was in the other.
The water in the harbor was clear and John could easily see the bottom. It was littered with broken carts and abandoned crates. Jagged debris was spread across the sandy floor. If the drowning man got tangled in that mess, John would never be able to drag him out. He could get caught too and drown with the stranger.
“I should go.” John said.
“That is what I’m asking you? Are you afraid of me?” John turned and looked right into Sherlock’s eyes.
“My spies tell me that he is still searching for his younger brother. He has sent a ship called the Scotland, piloted by on Gregory Lestrade to hunt Sherlock Holmes down.”
“There are a lot of things I should have done. But I doubt we will have to deal with Roylott again. His crew will probably drown him first.”
John saluted, “Captain John Watson.”
Moran picked the picture frame up and looked at the photo. He dragged his finger across the glass and over the image of John holding the sniper rifle. This was his John. This was his omega. Not the man at the pool. He didn’t know who that was. This was the John Watson he did everything for and the other John took him away.
“Will wait.” Mycroft announced. He pulled himself together and walked around the desk. “Captain Lestrade, if you will please.”
“Oh, yes . . . I need to wait.”
“Sherlock, even though Mummy agreed to this . . . experiment, you must acknowledge this is foolish. Cooler heads need to prevail. Mummy is all in favor of omega independence but it is only a phase. Next month it will be something else.” Mycroft said as he rolled his eyes.
“What the bloody hell are you talking about?” John snapped.
“No, but whoever did is who stole the defense secrets.” Sherlock said.
Standing on the pavement under the red awning for ‘Speedie’s Café’ was Detective Inspector Lestrade. He was smoking a cigarette. The file of the armored car robbery still tucked under his arm. The policeman didn’t say anything but it was apparent he had been waiting for John.
“I want to make love to you, John. I want to hold you and watch you come.”
John jumped out of the chair and started to pace. Sherlock watched him. He could see the turmoil John was going through. Sherlock slowly stood up and went to stand in front of John, blocking his pacing.
“Carmichael is a wanker. Always bitch’n he’s been cheated. Never could hold his liquor.” Moran snapped.
Sherlock turned to Mycroft. “Is it over?”
He wrapped his arms around the omega and gave John a nipping kiss under the man’s ear. The small omega leaned into his mate.
Sherlock turned and glanced at the woman then up the wooden staircase. He pulled himself away from John and started to rush up the stairs. Taking them two at a time. John went to follow him, then stopped.
Jim had threatened Sherlock, but had not actually hurt him. Was John Watson’s involvement with Sherlock part of Moriarty’s plan? Was Watson placed in Sherlock’s life to manipulate his brother? Moriarty had teased Sherlock with the idea of joining him in his criminal endeavors. Was that why Watson was there – to convince Sherlock to join Jim Moriarty and himself.
“My daughter has been a usurper for too long. She is a pawn to that frump William. The bloody Dutchman. I want her gone and I want my throne back. I’m the king!”
“John . . .” The man whispered.
“He is harmless. But I was getting tired of the excuses that the other was giving me.” Moriarty nodded his head at the body that was being wrapped up in the sheeting.
Sherlock sighed, dragging his fingers through his hair. “Yes.”
“Well, it is now Mycroft’s turn to know pain.”
~221~
Sherlock crashed through a door and into a darken building. John chased after the omega as he raced up a set of stairs to the roof. The omega ran across the rooftops and over skylights. John doggedly ran behind him. They dodged chimney stacks and antennae. Suddenly, Sherlock leaped over the gap between the buildings. John skidded to a stop and looked down. The drop to the pavement below was more than five stories.
Sherlock glanced away. He didn’t want to see any more. Part of him wanted to walk away. Let John make a fool of himself. John had told him that the doctor never wanted to see him again. John had been cruel when he came to see Sherlock when he had been sick. The warm inviting eyes Sherlock remembered had turned cold and unforgiving. Sherlock knew he should walked away. Leave John to own destruction . . . but he couldn’t.
He held his free arm out to her and wrapped it around her shoulder once she was close enough to him.
“You are mistaken doctor . . .” Sherlock started to say.
John gave Sherlock a quick nod.
“Obviously to seduce my omega brother.”
“Oh, Sherlock . . . what have you done this time?” The grey haired woman worried at a handkerchief in her hand. “Upstairs . . . the police.”
The door closed behind him, cutting off the rest of the conversation.
“MY ALPHA!” Sherlock shouted.
Moran cleared his throat and spat on his hard cock. The omega was already slick in anticipation but there was something primeval in marking the omega internally. He smeared the spittle over the throbbing length and lined himself up. James push back, welcoming the cock into his body. He gave a low seductive groan as Moran pushed into the omega. James clawed at the sheets. His body giving over the alpha’s control.
“Trade? What do I have that he would want to trade for?” John asked, suspicious of the offer.
“You knew the risks of being involved with me.” Sherlock said glancing away from Moriarty.
Mycroft turned around and saw Sherlock standing in the doorway leading to the kitchen. John Watson was standing behind the omega looking over his shoulder. Watson had a scowl on his face.
“We need to figure out what Magnussen has on your brother.” John said without looking up. He realized if he kept looking at Sherlock he would lose track of what needed to be done.
“Kissing you.”
He would wake in the middle of the night having just dreamed of the omega. John’s tan skin, golden brown and smoothed, sliding next to Moran’s. The omega’s soft smile and easy going laugh hanging just on the edge of his dreams. Moran was waking more often with John’s name on his lips and a longing deep in his groin. He wondered if he could convince the small omega to consider moving into his tent. If he could get John to agree to become his and his alone.
“You are up to something.”
“You mean Inspector Dimmit, don’t you?” John asked.
“I don’t know Jim Moriarty. Why would I? How could your ex-boyfriend think I was working with him?”
You all have been very supportive through this story. Thank you. I've found it much harder to write this one and I really don't know why, but your comments have really helped me out. One more chapter to go.
Sherlock watched him for several seconds running a series of ideas through his head. He had numerous suggestions on how John could thank him. Most of them included the two of them being alone in a bedroom. He was about to make a suggestion when John’s mobile rang. The same mobile Sherlock had given him. John pulled it from his pocket and looked confused at the number.
“Because you told him he couldn’t.” Sherlock said. “You told Moriarty, John Watson was off limits.”
John glanced back and forth between Sherlock and Dimmit. “I already spoke to the officers at work. Why are you here?”
2007 Sarowbi, Afghanistan
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked as he gently rubbed his nose against John’s ear. Relishing the omega’s scent now combined with his.
“Very altruistic of you.” Sherlock said.
John was what John seemed.
“Hello you.” John said weakly.
“Where did your partner take Sherlock?” Greg voice was low and threatening.
“I’ve missed you.” Sherlock’s voice was a deep rumble.
“My deductions were correct.” Sherlock said.
“Most efficient.” Mycroft smiled and turned back towards the carriage. “Gentlemen, thank you for your company on my drive home. I will say goodnight and hopefully will see you tomorrow at the palace.”
“Thank you, Sir Henry.” Mycroft waited until the man had turned away. He thinned his lips as he scanned the crowd again.
“So because I made one innocuous comment, you decide to go out and try and kill yourself?” John was beginning to get angry. He knew he shouldn’t but he couldn’t help himself. He had been scared. Sherlock had terrified him and now he was finding out it was over some stupid misunderstanding.
“I wanted to see you again. I thought we should try.” The words faded off as he looked at the sullen expression on John’s face. “I thought that if we could talk . . .”
Greg hesitated as he glanced at the calm and composed alpha sitting in the bed. John look more lethal than he had ever before. The good natured doctor was gone and the intelligent and determined soldier remained.
“It would only be trouble if someone else found out about it.” John whispered. “Or if you made it complicated.”
“Oh!” John grabbed a dish towel and dried his hands. “That must be my orders to report.”
“If I didn’t know it was there I wouldn’t have noticed it. You came out better than me from the firefight.”
James and Sherlock had left John upstairs with Detective Inspector Lestrade. As planned, they rode the lift down one floor then got off. Using the back hallways and the stairs, they slipped passed the police and were leaving through the loading docks. That is when they were stopped by the blond stranger with the watery grey eyes.
“What are you saying? That this Colonel Moran is a good man. That he just made a mistake bonding with Moriarty?” Sherlock jeered at his brother.
Sherlock remained silent. He wanted John to explain what had happened in his own way, even though it was killing him inside to wait. John stared at the man for several seconds before he leaned forward and refilled his glass, taking another sip afterwards.
Sherlock looked down into his son’s sleeping face. He hoped for once his brother was correct.
“You would be my new Moran?” Jim laughed.
“I don’t see any bruising.” Greg said.
“What connection does Trevor and Sholto have?” Greg asked.
John could see the crestfallen look on Sherlock’s face as he said friend while John had only said associate. He hesitated but took another step further into the flat.
“Get two glasses and join me.”
“Preposterous.”
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?” Moran shouted.
“Yes . . . I’ll go to the shops and do the week’s shopping.” Sherlock rushed out of the flat. His steps tapping down the wooden steps.
Sherlock turned away without answering and slipped the violin under his chin. He drew the bow across the strings and played the first ten notes of ‘Auld Lang Syne’. Then he paused, taking a moment before turned and looked at his mate. He started to play one of John’s favorites. ‘Fantasia on a Theme’ by Thomas Tallis.
Sherlock after the fire.
“There are three different size of bruises on Trevor. At least three different alphas raped him. Do a thorough rape kit and you will find that Mycroft’s DNA is nowhere on Victor. Also, the bruises are of different ages. Victor was assaulted over time. Several days. Days in which Mycroft Holmes will have an impeachable alibi. Finally, the person who killed him had small hands. Smaller than Mycroft’s.” Sherlock turned to Lestrade. “Have Mycroft do the drug test. It will prove his innocence.”
He glanced over John’s shoulder and down the hall to the closed bedroom door. He took a deep breath and slowly let it go.
He knew he was running out of time. Mycroft’s surveillance team must have found him by now and when they realized whose flat he was at, Mycroft would swoop in and kidnap Sherlock away.
“You don’t think I’m stupid enough to believe you would actually shoot me. Aren’t I your ‘prize’?”
The young man glanced up at Blackwood. Blackwood could see the fear and doubt in Sherlock’s eyes.
John smiled. “Thank you. Now if I were you, I get to those flames before it’s your ship on fire instead of your canvas.”
There was a knock on the door and both men glanced at it. Sherlock’s hand slipped inside his suit jacket.
Greg glanced back at Sherlock. “That is what I’m going to ask him.”
“The homicide? Yes, Sherlock told me about that.” Victor looked back at Sherlock. The younger man’s expression was blank and emotionless. “It is a shame that no one listened to my darling.”
Moriarty’s response to Moran was the high clear sound of his spoon tapping the sides of the teacup as he stirred the liquid. He didn’t look up at his man. He appeared to have his entire attention immersed by the preparation of the perfect cup of tea.
A dark-haired lieutenant poked their head around the door and looked in. “Yes sir?”
The men of the Appledore left the Morstan and cut the line that held the two ships together. John tried to rise to his feet but the opium that Mike had given him was taking effect. He collapsed down into James’ lap. The last thing John saw as the drug pulled him under was the sun rising over the sea.
“You shouldn’t be out here alone.” John said.
Sherlock looked carefully at the man sitting in front of him. He was shorter than Sherlock but had similar coloring. Dark hair and pale skin. The shape of their heads were also similar. But their eyes were very different. Where Sherlock had silver blue eye coloring and Mycroft pale blue, Jim Moriarty’s eyes were dark brown, almost black. A trait he must have inherited from his mother.
Sherlock was waiting for John by the doors to the morgue. He seemed to be nervous and pacing back and forth. When he saw John walking up, he seemed relieved.
“And Sherlock?” Greg asked still pressing.
“We’re okay,” John whispered as he nudged Sherlock.
John watched the man leave. He picked up the water bucket and carried it over to the washstand. Regretful that Sherlock had left.
John pulled Sherlock close to him and soundly kissed his lips. His tongue swept over the omega’s lips as he hummed. Sherlock opened his mouth and John plunged in. He tasted Sherlock’s sweet brown sugar and the hint of apples. The kiss ended far too soon for John’s liking.
Mycroft opened his mouth as if to say something, but snapped it shut. The door to Sherlock bedroom opened and the omega returned to the room. He had showered and changed clothes. He had packed a small overnight bag that he dropped by the front door.
“Find a deck and come back after you’re off duty.”
“Sherlock, you are ill prepared for the demands of independence. It is simply unwise . . .” Mycroft was cut off by his brother.
“Is Wilkes dead?” Sherlock asked.
“I quit.”
~221~
John and James returned to London after both men had been medically discharged from the military. They found themselves without employment but with some very specific skill sets.
“What do you want?” Sherlock asked bluntly. He tugged slightly on his scarf to loosen it from around his neck. Fear and anxiety were churning through him but Sherlock was not going to let the alpha know that.
Her smile faltered. “I would prefer you not use it.”
John’s fingers ran lightly around the edges of redden skin. “It’ll heal without a scar. Don’t worry. But Stamford has a cream that will take away any discomfort.”
John smiled brightly and Humphrey returned the smile. John had been playing poker most of his life and was very good at it. He rarely left a table as a loser.
Confused, John remained silent as his eyes fixed on Mycroft’s relaxed expression.
“An associate.” Frankie looked away.
Mycroft knew Sherlock would hate him. He didn’t blame him. He had failed Sherlock in the past but he promised himself he would not fail him now. Regardless of how Sherlock felt, he would take care of him. He would protect his brother, even from himself.
“I didn’t wish to hear the ‘Not Gay’ speech again.”
“You’re lying.” James almost shouted.
His secretary paled. “Yes, sir. As you wish.”
Eddy Malik and Sean McMillian walked down the pavement towards the male and female SAS officers on the bench. Eddy and McMillian were arguing about a football match. Both were waving their hands around. Just as they got even with bench, McMillian shoved Eddy backwards. Eddy threw his arms out to catch himself but only grabbed air. He fell into the couple on the bench. Eddy’s cup of coffee flung across the SAS man’s shirt and trousers. The man cursed and leapt to his feet.
“When did this happen?” Moriarty asked his assistant.
Moran wondered if he could get away with killing Jim before the man could harm John.
After Sherlock was discharged from A&E, Greg took him back the young man’s flat on Montague Street. The cluttered flat smelled of cigarette smoke and chemicals. Greg opened the window only for Sherlock to follow behind him and close it.
“You bet’er run, cause if’n I find you down ‘ere I’m gon’a . . .” Frankie’s threat trailed off.
“I told you, I wasn’t gay, Sherlock.”
James Stuart slammed his fist down on the table and dislodged the ash from the plate. The man sitting opposite him frowned as the grey ash now staining his white linen tablecloth.
Sherlock sneered at him as he turned and kissed his mother’s cheek.
“But you saved me. Again. You stopped Moran and helped me get Moriarty. We are safe. We are together.” Whispered Sherlock.
“I am not the Colonel’s lover . . . never have been, never will be!”
McMath, Cullen, Henn and Barr were rowing hard and propelling the small boat closer to the Morstan.
“Yes, sir. What do you need?” He asked. He briefly looked at Moran’s face but before the alpha could speak, the doctor picked up the chart hanging on the wall beside the head of Moran’s bed. He gave it a cursory look then set it back. “I’m not your attending. Do you need me to get Doctor Walters?”
Mycroft heard a deep groaning coming from a darkened room on the second floor. It was a small room with only one occupant. As soon as Mycroft saw the shape of the man, he knew it was Sherlock.
Sherlock had removed his heavy wool coat and his black suit jacket.
“Did the body look odd?” Sherlock asked.
The stolen moments on the Maywand seem so long ago. It was a lifetime ago. A universe away.  Sometimes John wondered if it wasn’t a dream. Some fantasy he had created to soften the memories of life on the ship.
“And finally, we have a new member,” Sholto said, nodding towards John. “Captain John Watson, RAMC.”
“You said . . .”
“No.” Sherlock answered quickly then repeated slowly and calmly. “I’ve never been afraid of you, John. You’ve been the only person in my life I didn’t need to be afraid of.”
“Is there a pertinent reason for us to become acquainted?” Sherlock asked.
John brought his hand up and rested his palm over Sherlock’s heart. “Isn’t that the way it’s supposed to be when two people love each other?”
“Where are you going?” Sherlock asked.
“If you wanted to see me again, you didn’t have to go and get yourself shot!” John growled.
An officer was fighting for his life against a pirate. The pirate was tall. Well over six foot. His hair was streaked with grey but wild and unkept. Heavy muttonchops covered his jawline and connected to a long bushy moustache. The man’s skin was darkly tanned and his hands gnarled with scars.
The next morning, John woke in his own bed, alone. He sat up and reached for his bottle of suppressants. He read over the label and studied the bottle for a moment. Then he opened the drawer of the bed stand and tossed the bottle inside. Closing the drawer, he started to count the days.
“What is your Christian name?”
“Sherlock, it’s time to go. I’ll make sure you are here when he wakes up. But right now, I need to take care of you. You are what is important now.”
John was not in the room. Sherlock turned quickly and rushed out of the room and down the hall. Mycroft came in to see the surprised look on his father’s face.
“John why must you comment on the obvious.” Sherlock said as he crawled across the floor to reach John’s outstretched hand.
“What it was like? Dancing in a gay bar or being mauled on the dance floor?”
Mycroft rushed passed the two men, noting he hadn’t seen them before. But Anthea acknowledged them briefly, before following her boss into his house. The woman’s simple acceptance of the two men put Mycroft at ease. Mycroft had his hands full with Sherlock and couldn’t be bothered with instructing new security personnel.
“I don’t know what you are talking about. What announcement?”
Greg sat down on a chair and rubbed his shin again. “I heard what happened. You do need some help, but it can’t come from me.”
John pushed passed James and head up the short stairs to the wheel deck. He entered the wardroom then walked directly to his cabin. Sherlock followed him without a word. John opened the door and held it for Sherlock to go in first. John followed and closed the door.
“Yeah, that stuff can be a right bitch when you wake up.  Tommy, get the man a drink of water.”
“Yeah,” John hummed as he leaned closer and kissed the corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
John dipped his chin and glared at the younger man. Sherlock caught the look and glanced away, waving his hand.
“The one on the far right is John Blackwood. Next to him is Henn. Then Major Sholto and on the far left is Bill, Bill Murry. He saved my life.” John said as he kept staring at the photograph.
The two men kissed deeply. Letting their tongues caress each other’s. A dance they had become familiar with over the last few months. Mycroft’s hands moved to slid up under the detective’s jacket and over the soft cotton of his shirt. He could feel the muscles under the clothing and his mind reminded what that body looked like without the clothing.
“But Gordon will wonder what happened?” his secretary said.
After months in hospital and the loss of over twenty-five pounds, John was medically discharged. He had lost his career and gained a tremor in his hand and a limp. Alone, unemployed, and friendless.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was walking out into the sunlight when he saw them again, Ryan and the sneering man, Jerry. John glanced up and down the street as the two men approached.
He couldn’t remember much of the night before. The woman was attractive but John didn’t want to linger in her arms. He felt foul. Unwashed. Filthy. He just wanted to get up and get back to his ship. Even if it meant he would have to swim across the harbor to get there.
She frowned and walked away, not refilling his near empty cup. John sighed as he looked down at the remains of his mug. Mike huffed slightly and pour some of his coffee into John’s cup.
Sherlock didn’t answer John. He stood up straight groaning as he did so. He stared at Dimmock wanting an answer.
“I sincerely hope you weren’t expecting an interesting and engaging conversation with her. She not capable of it.”
He took the coffee cup from her hand and took a hesitant swig. The coffee was strong and bitter, but at least it was hot.
Mycroft recognized Lady Smallwood’s handwriting. The note was scented with her perfume. So far the evening had been a complete disaster. The guests at the gala were boring and the conversations insipid. His planned introduction between Sherlock and Sir Henry didn’t happen. And Sherlock had behaved like a child and run off. It had been a miserable evening but maybe things were looking up.
“With me or with Sherlock?” John asked back.
Magnussen stared at the offered gift, but didn’t reach for it. His eyes shifting from the memory stick back to Moriarty’s face.
Mycroft Holmes flicked his handkerchief out then carefully and artistically folded it. Returning the cloth to his sleeve.
“What are you going to do to us?” Lestrade asked.
Mycroft hesitated, then drew his handkerchief out of his pocket with a flare. He carefully laid it over the desiccated appendage before he cautiously picked it up. He turned the hand over and looked at the tips of the fingers.
“You led me to believe that you worked for Moriarty, but that wasn’t true was it Frankie? By the way, what is your real name?”
John was hit with two conflicting emotions. Relief and regret.
James tipped his head back to grant John better access. “Does this mean you’re going to top?” he gasped.
John immediately let go of the alpha and step back. A protective hand went to his abdomen and cupped the small bulge. Moran heard the word. ‘Baby.’ He stared at John’s body, trying to see if he could tell if the omega was pregnant.
“Not without you.”
Sherlock’s attention was fixed on Rampant. He didn’t notice the door open behind the alpha. Suddenly, the alpha screamed. His hold slacken on Sherlock’s neck, but he didn’t let go. Sherlock saw John standing behind the alpha. John’s eyes were cold and hard. His jaw locked and his face emotionless.
“There is nothing that you could say that would interest me.”
“Not going to happen? You don’t want an alpha?”
Victor screamed and told him to get off. The blond was hurting him. Victor turned his head to see Jim sitting in a chair, watching. Jim was smiling as the blond wrapped his fingers around Victor’s neck before entering his body.
“John, I want you.”
“I already told you, Dimmit, John was with me.” Sherlock announced.
Habib Malik, ‘Eddy’, pointed at the mark on the map for the man by the café. “Barton could slip a smoke bomb into his pocket. I’ve got a few in my kit.”
“We met after we escaped the clutches of the nuns. Runaways living on the streets. She became very adept at appearing non-threating, just before she drove the knife through one’s heart. We’ve worked together almost as long as you’ve tried to ruin my life. You have no idea how long I have planned my little revenge against you, Mycroft. It took years to get her into your sphere of power. You thought you had found the perfect assistant. What you didn’t know was I had trained her to be just that. What surprised me was how quickly you yielded everything over to her.”
“I will agree to rescind the conservatorship if you discover who the ‘Spider’ is.” Grinding his teeth as he forced himself to say the words.
There was something behind John’s eyes that Sherlock just couldn’t yet read. Some emotion that seemed to frighten both Sherlock as well as John.
“With your father dead, your brother, Mycroft Holmes, is your pack alpha, is he not?”
“Then what is the cost of that name? How much will you be willing to pay to keep England safe?”
It was late and the bar was just before closing when John heard his name being called.
“Good, then we sail to Port Royal.” Sherlock said.
John twisted just in time to see Victor swinging an empty beer bottle at John’s head. John ducked and the bottle crashed against the wall over John’s head. Glass and beer rained down on John. He stood up and swung his fist. He caught Victor right on the chin and man’s head snapped violently to the side. Wilderbrant kept up screaming and crying. Victor swiped at John with the broken bottle and John had to jump back to avoid being cut, but he was caught in the corner now and had nowhere to escape to. The next swing by Victor would slice John open. He raised his arm to protect his face, but the blow never came. John lowered his arm to see two of the bouncers pull Victor across the floor away from John. Wilderbrant followed them crying out Victor’s name.
He wondered how he could convince there two idiots he was correct and he was trying to help them.
“We aren’t destine for long term meaningful relationships.” Mycroft said. “All lives end . . . all hearts are broken. Caring is not an advantage.”
He staggered to his feet and glanced off into the clearing mists. The Morstan appeared through the haze like a phantom.
“John?”
The heroin made Sherlock’s body feel light and mobile. He leaned back against the bathroom wall. It was warm in the room and he didn’t mind being naked. He stretched his long legs out in front of himself and closed his eyes. He let the opium play with him for a few moments before it overwhelmed him and pulled him down where his mind could finally shut down and be quiet. Just a few blessed moments of silence.
~221~
“I did not! Who said I did!” Frankie shouted.
“Okay, drive to the end of the block.” John ordered.
“He controls drugs, he doesn’t use them. Drug use is too pedestrian for Mycroft. Too beneath him. Also he wants me to join him in his business. Work together and rule England. He can’t afford to have his younger brother vulnerable to manipulation.”
To John’s surprise, not all the poker players were men. Sitting in the chair opposite John was Captain Mary Morstan. She was in charge of the nurses at Bastion. She was a petite woman with straw colored hair and an impish smile. Her cornflower blue eyes twinkled as John sat down.
Sherlock glance over at his brother’s smirk and wanted to punch it off his face.
“People die all the time in hospitals.” Culverton Smith mumbled.
“Thank you, Sherlock. I will have the cameras removed before you return to your flat.”
“He was my friend, Sherlock . . . he gave me a chance when no one else thought I was worth anything. He was my commander and friend and . . . please Sherlock . . . I can’t talk about him anymore.”
Sherlock looked sideways at the shorter man. “I can see where both could cause great physical distress.”
The doctor turned around and paused for a moment as he looked at how ridiculous Sherlock looked wearing his robe. He smiled at the young man. Then he noticed the red mark on the side of Sherlock’s face and he suddenly felt guilty.
“Not exactly. Last time we were in here, Martin said you needed another bartender.”
“John, it’s me. Let me in.” John recognized Seb’s voice through the door.
“Are you sure?” John asked. His phone pressed against the side of his head as he glanced up and down the street looking for the taxi. John saw one and waved his hand.
John pulled back to look into the alpha’s blown eyes. Silver rims around black blown pupils.
John leaned into Sherlock’s body and the older man guided John down the hallway and into the bedroom. John twisted in Sherlock’s embrace and started to push his jeans down as he kicked his trainers off. Sherlock’s warm hands swept over John’s torso. His teeth closed over John’s neck; sucking a bruise into pulse point on John.
Moran spun and saw one of the few items he had taken with him from the army. A photograph he never let leave his possession. He had carried it for months inside his uniform. Later, after he deserted and was set up in Paris, he bought a wooden frame for it. The photo was wrinkled and stained with sweat, but the image was still very clear to see. It was of Moran and John, standing and smiling at the camera. Both men were in their fatigues. John’s shirt was off and he just had on a brown military t-shirt. His muscled upper arms were exposed and tanned. Moran’s left arm was wrapped in a friendly manor around John’s shoulders. His head tipped towards the omega. Their blonde hair bleached by the sun. In John’s arm was the .338 Lapua.
Moriarty tightened his grip. Violet’s hands came up and pulled at Moriarty’s. She scratched him as she gasped for air. Her eyes flew wide in panic.
Moran suddenly leaned back as if he had been punched by some invisible force. “Gone? . . . Is he . . .?”
“If you need anything, John, please let me . . .”
“Dressed like that?” John’s glance moved up and down Sherlock’s appearance. “I saw you walk pass the window and look at Seb. Are you checking him out? Seeing if I’m dating someone you approve of?”
The pain was instant. A searing burning pain right through his left shoulder. His arm went numb and he fell backwards onto Huntley. His helmet flew off his head and rolled down the ravine.
Sherlock turned and looked at Mycroft. “Could someone be blaming me for Magnussen’s death?”
“For this you get to ask a question.” She waved her hand and a servant came in and took the bottle and the crate away.
~221~
“I’m . . .”
“Until I knew you were gone.” Sherlock returned John’s gaze. “You weren’t the only one who was hurting that day. You weren’t the only one who had his heart ripped from his chest.”
The younger Afghan waved his hand and shouted as he blocked John from entering the house. The elder man shouted back. John glanced at Henn.
“Sorry mate, oc . . . occupied. Try the garden.” John’s words were slurring now.
“Here are some boots.” John was looking down at the pair of worn leather boots. He had not knocked on the door. He didn’t realize that Sherlock would be naked.
“I observed.”
“No I’m sure Wilkes took them. I’ll be sure to make him repay me as soon as he gets out of jail. No, you are here for a different reason. If I can’t get high tonight, then maybe I can get laid.”
“Sherlock, I didn’t lie to you.”
“Solving puzzles – mysteries? Cases other detectives can’t solve?” Greg asked.
“Sherlock, I’m not playing . . . you will do what I want, won’t you.” John dragged his teeth playfully along the detective’s jaw.
“Why would you be concerned about witnesses?” Dimmit asked.
“Yes, but my two sons where already quite grown. Sherlock was fifteen and Mycroft . . . well he had already graduated from University and was working.”
John read through another newspaper. He had read one to two papers a day since the night at Roland Kerr Further University, where he had shot a man. He told James that he was checking to see if there were any reports about the armored car robbery, but that wasn’t the only thing John was looking for. The first day after he had shot Jefferson Hope, there had been a newspaper account of the incident. A photograph of Sherlock sitting on the bumper of the ambulance with a lurid headline above it,
“Good job everyone. Let’s get him admitted to ICU and find out if he has any family.” John said as he watched the nurse cover the boy’s torso with a warm blanket.
John thought he saw a twitch at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. A weak attempt to smile. He stepped back and pulled Sherlock’s hospital gown down to look at the bandage over the left shoulder.
Sherlock was running through his head various options to appease John when he realized the other man was muttering and talking under his breath. Sherlock’s excellent hearing picked up a name and a knot released itself within him. Yes, John was upset but not completely with Sherlock.
Moriarty laughed and stepped back towards John and padded him on the cheek.
“I’m sure you’re over qualified to break up fights between drunks.”
The driver turned around and looked at John. The two men stared at each other for a moment then John sighed. “Baker Street.” Then he turned to Sherlock. “I want to speak to your alpha.”
“Fine, I’ll leave and you can fuck yourself.”
“Again, irrelevant.” John said still glaring at the younger man.
Sherlock spun around and saw his mate leaning against the door frame. He put his violin down on the desk and rushed across the small space to John.
“We’ll see about that.” Greg said as he made sure he didn’t rush from the hospital room.
“There is someone who would know that. Someone who would want to hurt me that bad.” Mycroft said.
John was there in the flat even though he was supposed to be working tonight at the dance club.
“Ah, yeah. Sure.” John stood up and together the two walked out of the room. He barely caught Humphrey saying.
John’s eye grew larger. “It’s bloody obvious what I’m insinuating! If you want to be a blood whore, do it on another ship!"
“Apparently, there was a witness. Someone stated they saw John Watson at the Enclave at the same time that James Sholto was murdered.” Mycroft seemed to enjoy giving the two men the bad news.
“What about teaching? You would be a great teacher.” John said following the man.
“Was that your plan all along? To kill us?” Sherlock asked. He unbuttoned his coat and let the heavy wool slide open.
“What is your name?”
“Usually the patient complains about the salve.” John said staring at Sherlock. A slight smirk on his face.
The chlorine in air burned the back of John’s throat. He sat in the chair in the changing room. It was the same room and the same chair he had sat in over a year before. He kept trying to not remember what had happened last time he was here; but the panic kept rising inside him. He could feel the phantom weight of the explosive vest resting on his shoulders. He could smell the pungent smell of semtex explosive. It was all in his head but John was breaking out in cold sweat. The thought of Moriarty slipping another vest onto him was pour adrenaline through John’s body.
John Watson’s friend was dead. They looked down at James Sholto’s body on the gurney. A single bullet hole was just under his right eye. Just above the patch of scarred skin on his cheek. It was a kill shot. James never felt a thing. He was dead before he hit the ground.
“No.” Moran bowed his head down in regret. He never did let John know how he felt. “We were just friends. John never knew.”
“You should have stopped at one. Or even not started. Why couldn’t you drink coke or something like that?”
2017       John was still angry the next day. He couldn’t believe that Mycroft Holmes had the audacity to question him after kidnapping him. He hated Mycroft and blamed him for turning Sherlock against him. He was coming onto shift when Cora called him over to the desk.
Moran’s watery grey eyes watched as Watson’s deep blue eyes lightened and seemed to smile more than his face.
“I need to know what you feel now.” Sherlock continued ignoring John’s jab.
Sherlock slowly stood up and John stepped forward, giving Sherlock an arm to brace on.
The small boy rushed off while the captain continued.
“Colonel . . . Seb, I’m sorry . . . I didn’t know . . . I never . . . I didn’t mean for you to feel that way. We were friends.”
Sherlock blinked and leaned back into John’s body.
“Sir, we lost track of both the younger Mister Holmes and Doctor Watson in Cardiff. We are looking for . . .”
“Would it be easier to see him die?”
“But how?” he whispered.
“Well, I could offer my superior intelligence, but you would be offend if I suggested that I possessed a greater mind that you. No, what I have you need. Physical support.”
“Are you alright?’’ Sherlock asked.
“Then there is nothing to be afraid of in accompanying me home.”
“Demanding?” Greg asked raising a questioning eyebrow.
“Ai’h, all of it.” Wilkes carefully hidden accent slipped through.
‘I see what you mean. She leads him around by his nose.’ CS
“Sherlock, it had been over two years since John was with Moran in Afghanistan. There is no telling what happened to that man in that time.”
“I was seen with the two of you. I was seen getting into this car with you. And it is extremely difficult to get blood out of cloth upholstery.” Sherlock spoke as if he was telling a child why they couldn’t do as they wanted. “Besides . . . John would stop you.”
“I didn’t tell you thank you.”
“You came in here and told me you were going to murder me.”
“Well, that you depend on whether it was Amanda Holden or Simon Cowell.” John teased back.
“But we know that’s not true. I’ve known about you for a long time.” The stranger said as he licked his lips.
The man stepped back and folded his hands in front of himself. He stared ahead of himself, ignoring John’s questions. John stared at him, confused.
“And I’m on a diet.” Mike took another bite of cake.
If only that was true for both of them.
Sherlock got out of the cab. He lifted the blue and white tape and crossed underneath it. A WPC came rushing up to him to stop him when DCI Lestrade walked up.
Mike smiled at the irritated woman. There were several other things she wanted to berate John with but now she couldn’t with a witness present.
The snipper lowered the scope from his eye. He wondered why the blond looked familiar to him. He would have to think about that later. Right now, Jim had told him to keep an eye on the omega’s flat to see if Mycroft Holmes showed up today.
He turned as he heard the kettle click off. The water was boiling in the glass kettle, but John was too exhausted to even think about tea. He shrugged and stepped out the kitchen and towards his bed.
“It was too late by the time he was six. I insisted he be sent away because he was that vicious. He was just like his mother. I could never trust him. I will never apologize for putting my family first unlike my father.” Mycroft hissed back.
“Why not? It is completely logical. You can move in here for as long as you like.”
John rushed to the window and shouted, but Sherlock couldn’t hear him. Sherlock talking to the driver, unaware of John in the opposite building. In Sherlock’s hand, John saw a small vial. Sherlock was holding it up to the light to look at the content. John watched as Sherlock dumped it out into his hand and held it up to his lips. The same lips John had kissed earlier that evening.
Sherlock looked down at his brother in the bed. He felt off balance. Something wasn’t right. His world was eschewed. Sherlock knew the past few weeks had been difficult on Mycroft but it wasn’t until that very moment did he actually register the physical effects the stress had caused his brother. The young omega had never seen his brother look so insubstantial. So weak. Mycroft’s pale skin was sallow now. His lips were chapped and thin. His eyes were sunken and listless. Dark smudges were visible beneath the brown lashes.
Mary blinked her eyes. He thought she was going to get angry. Maybe even start yelling at him. Mary’s eyes scrutinized him closely.
“I want to leave,” Sherlock tried to pull away.
“A group of retired Russian intelligence officers who have turned into alleged assassins for hire.” Sherlock said.
Moran is looking for Sherlock and John.
Sherlock sat up and glared at Mycroft. “Are you going to tell me that I can no longer work with the police? Is that it? Are you sending me back to that abysmal clinic?”
John rolled off of Moran. The small gun was in John’s hand. There was a smear of blood across John’s chest. Sherlock threw himself at the man.
John took the slip of offered paper. “Sure, yeah. That would nice.”
“Both. I knew you were being spied on by Sherlock. He probably knew that very night you took Watson out dancing and made out with him at the club. You didn’t have to debase yourself and sleep with man.”
John has an unpleasant encounter
Moriarty laughed again. “I think you could be useful. I have my fingers in so many pies, I need someone who could help burden the load with me. Help organize little things like armored car robberies. We seem to share similar opinions about certain people.”
“He is not my bodyguard and his presences is welcomed here.” Sherlock said. Magnussen raised a doubtful eyebrow at Sherlock. “Far more welcomed than you are. The wedding is called off.”
“Oh don’t be such a simpleton, of course, how else do you expect me to tolerate the idiots I am surrounded by.” Sherlock waved his hand as if pushing the idea away.
“At least one of us didn’t deceive.” John couldn’t stop accusing.
John swam harder. His own lungs ached for a breath.
“I doubt that, my dear Sherlock. I don’t believe that boring little medical student changed you that much. Remember, I saw you when he wasn’t around. I know what you got up to when you weren’t under his thumb. And I know what I want you to do once you are under my thumb.”
Mycroft entered the reception half an hour after it was supposed to have started. He despised gatherings like this but they were necessity for good diplomacy. He had learned previously that anyone he really wanted to speak to would arrive late and leave early, hence his own arrival thirty minutes late and his planned escape within twenty minutes. He glanced at his watch counting down the minutes until he could leave.
“Sherlock!” “John!” both men spoke simultaneously as they grabbed for each other.
His men pulled John and the stranger to their boat. Across the harbor, men in another long boat were shouting and waving their arms. John grabbed the side of his boat as James and George Blackwood hauled the lifeless stranger on board. John swung his leg over the gunwale and fell on top of the man’s body.
The first room was made up of radios and video equipment with images of the area surrounding the encampment. A large humming swamp cooler weakly blew cool air around the electronics. The crackle of radio transmissions from squads in the fields drowned out the hum of the swamp cooler. The second room was a large room with a paper map of the area pinned to one of the walls. There were rows of benches in the room and an old-fashioned chalkboard for briefings. From there, the warren broke off into smaller and smaller rooms.
“John you shut people out all the time. You keep us at arm’s length.”
Greg smiled knowingly. “Yeah, I did. Strangely enough you and your friend, Major James Sholto were both discharged for medical reasons a few months before we started getting reports of well-organized and executed heists.”
John’s knees were folded and resting against his chest in the small room. He tipped his head back and closed his eyes. He just wanted to go to sleep now and forget about how badly his weekend was going.
Sherlock’s mind immediately registered the inconsistency. If John had willing been with Moran, then the blonde alpha wouldn’t feel guilty about taking John. Moran also didn’t deny he had kidnapped John. He had taken John against his will. John had not been in that bed with Moran willingly. The sudden heat of rage rushed through Sherlock’s blood stream. Moran had forced John to be with him. How far had Moran gone? How much had John endured of the man’s advances?
“Smile, Sherlock.” Mycroft said through gritted teeth. “Remember, this is for charity.”
“MAGNUSSEN! WHY AREN’T YOU RETURNING FIRE?!” Baskerville screamed.
“You will be cooperative? You will accompany me to England and not harm yourself?” Magnussen asked as if he was negotiating a business arrangement.
~221~
The two moved together. Without doubt. Certain of each other’s devotion. A slow and rhythmic dance only accentuated with moans and heavy breathing.
Moran knew he was going to have to find the strange omega and determine why he was resistant to alpha domination. The colonel laid in his cot in the officer’s ward waiting till the young doctor came in for rounds. He wanted to speak to the young man again. When he did come in late the following day, the young man moved from bed to bed, reviewing the charts on the patients.
John moved lower and licked over the man’s exposed nipple. He leaned back and blew softly on it. John watched mesmerized as the skin puckered and wrinkled. He leaned in and lightly bit at the nub. Pulling gently until he heard Sherlock gasp and twist underneath him. The friction of Sherlock’s body against his member was delicious.
“I, unfortunately, was distracted while I searched for you.” Mycroft snapped back at his brother.
“Well, that’s the question. If she didn’t have her phone, who does?” Sherlock leaned forward and smiled.
James laughed softly. He reached up and grabbed Sherlock’s chin and twisted the man’s face up to look at the bruise on Sherlock’s face.
A big bury man who towered over the two young men stood guard at the door. The guard’s face and thick arms were tattooed with swirls and lines drawn in black ink. The tattoo on his face was a symmetrical mask that made the man look demonic.
“To hurt me? Was my association with her the reason for her death?”
John gave a weak laugh and stepped closer to Sherlock. He fought the urge to take the young man in his grasp and ravage him again. John looked into Sherlock’s silver eyes and sighed.
“I told you I didn’t know the man.”
He pushed the gun into his waistband then grabbed his cutlass. Sherlock standing up when John stepped forward.
The accountant took out a notebook from his pocket and started to write down the information. His Waterman fountain pen scratching across the paper.
“A more personal relationship? You really can’t say it can you? You want to have an affair with me.” Elizabeth smiled.
For a moment he was taken back to a flat just off Regent Park. He wondered how many times he had stared into that same face and wondered how he was so lucky to have Sherlock Holmes in his life. He honestly couldn’t say that now, but he was happy Sherlock would be alright.
“You told me he was mine. You promised.” Moran growled.
Memories of a similar conversation floated back into the room. John turned away and collapsed on the grey coach. Sherlock twisted in his chair so he could look at John better.
“Bridgetown, Barbados.”
Comments welcomed and enjoyed.
Frankie glared. “Remember our deal, Jim.”
“Of course I’m sure. He pulled it out of his coat.” John said.
John noticed the sour notes blending into Sherlock’s normal scent. The omega was upset. John felt an instinctual need to comfort the omega but his military training told him to remain distant.
“Time for fun.” John smiled.
Mycroft resigned himself to tell the truth to his family. “Magnussen forced me to agree to the bonding and marriage. I didn’t want to but I had to. I’ve been rushing around trying to figure out a way to stop him. I made sure the plans were no longer of any value to anyone . . .”
Sherlock glared at his flat-mate. The only reason Sherlock was allowed to live in London on his own was because he had assured Mycroft and his mother, that Victor was trustworthy. The real reason Sherlock had agreed to allow Victor to live with him was that Victor was good at giving the appearance of being a respectable omega. He would lie convincingly for Sherlock whenever necessary. He would tell everyone that he and Sherlock spent a quiet evening at home while Sherlock was out roaming the city, solving mysteries.
“No.” Sherlock said softly. “We left him with bodies of Magnussen and the man who started all this.”
Then John dropped his hands and stepped back. He dropped his gaze and stepped back again until he knocked into the table.
“I’m leaving.” Harry swayed dangerously sideways and John caught her.
“I want to speak to my generals now. We must launch a counterattack against James in Ireland. Where are my Irish advisors?! Where is my war cabinet!?” He glanced down at his cold wet feet. “Where’s my bloody shoes!?”
“Tell him he is welcome.” John said.
Greg knelt down beside Sherlock and the dark haired man woke briefly to look up into the detective’s face.
Mycroft simply frowned and looked unimpressed. “Honestly, what choice do I have?”
“What is it?”
John looked down at the unconscious man. Mycroft wouldn’t be answering any questions for a while.
“Reading.”
Colonel Sebastian Moran laid on the gurney looking up at the army doctor. The doctor was smaller than the other men working in the triage. Blonde hair and blue eyes. Skin tanned to a medium golden brown by the Afghan sun. Moran looked at the young blonde Army captain, surprised to see the doctor was an omega.
Moriarty stood in the doorway looking down at Moran and Watson. The two were collapsed on the floor. Moran’s arms wrapped tight around the omega.
“You better tell me the truth if you ever want to see the outside of a prison again.”
“Of course. I am aware of the comings and goings of all the senior members of Scotland Yard.”
“Yeah, if I ‘ad known. If she ‘ad told me. Well, things would have been different for you, John.”
John said nothing.
John smiled softly. “I’m glad, because I meant it too.”
“Who wouldn’t be? Where did you find that . . . cock?”
“We need to evacuate.” Seb said as he pulled Sherlock along. “Neil, Terry with me. The rest of you know what to do. No guns. Start destroying files.”
“I needed to be sure it was safe.” John reached up and placed his palms on either side of Sherlock’s face. “I lost you once, I don’t want to go through that again. Thank God, that Lestrade’s bullet proof vest worked.”
He paused for moment and relished the sight of his omega fucking himself on his length. The alpha was beginning to take complete hold on Sherlock’s mind. He had to fight it. Just for a few more moments. Hold off his rut until he was sure he had bonded with John.
John swung back around the building and leaned up against the dirt wall. His heart was pounding in his chest and he was breathing hard. He closed his eyes for a moment to try and slow everything down. To just get his breathing under control. When he opened his eyes, the younger Afghan was standing in front of him. A large knife in his hand.
“More than sitting around in a circle with idiots and discussing our feelings.” Sherlock sneered.
John’s stomach flipped again.
He thought.
John reached up and grabbed James’ forearm. The same arm he had broken in the IED explosion months before now healed and strong as before.
“It was one time, and the person was indigent. No one was going to claim him.”
He pulled his hands way from his face and looked down at them. They were trembling. A slight shake but with significant ramifications. He was falling apart, because fifteen years ago, he couldn’t hold his frightened brother. He couldn’t let himself cry with the boy. He didn’t let Sherlock grieve and allow himself to grieve with him.
He was just staring at the coffee when there was a knock on the front door. John glanced around to make sure everything appeared reasonably normal before he opened the door. He was expecting Sherlock’s brother or Joey. He saw two men. One was a man wearing a rumbled suit with brown hair going grey and the other was a police constable.
John gave a weak smile. “England? Well, I’m happy for you. You’ll make a good lieutenant colonel. I’ll miss – we’ll all miss you.”
“They loved each other.” Moriarty continued. “They loved each other but you wouldn’t leave it would you. You forced him to leave her.”
“The look you gave me on the firing range – I thought you were going to bend me over right there.”
“John?!”
“Yes, daddy. Tucked in next to my teddy.” John laughed softly.
“We leave.” John growled. He zipped his jacket closed, using more force than necessary.
“The idiot. To be taken alive – and with Van Coons! I want them dead! Kill them before they make York.”
Barr’s booming laughter covered over the deck. Sherlock turned hesitantly and glanced up at the stern castle. John was standing up there leaning over the rail, watching Barr and Holmes. Barr grabbed Sherlock by the scuff of his neck and pulled him to a work crew on deck. The men were on their hands and knees, scrubbing the deck with simple brushes and buckets of water.
There was nothing in the photograph that would be incriminating, but it would put John on the police’s radar. They would start to ask question. If they found John with a gun, then he would be arrested and surely even the idiots at Scotland Yard would find a connection between John and the robbery. Sherlock couldn’t allow that to happen.
Sherlock found himself living with the biggest mystery he’d encountered yet. And the very thought, made Sherlock more desirous of the man. Now that he knew what it felt like to be kiss by John, he wanted to know more. He wanted to know how John’s skin felt under his fingers. How sensitive John would be if Sherlock kissed along his neck. Nipping at the soft skin under his ear. What sounds would John make as Sherlock licked at his collarbone, or dragged his fingernail over the other man’s nipple? Would John be willing to take Sherlock in his mouth? Or would he prefer to be on top? Pushing the young man into the mattress.
John rushed through the halls of St Bart’s Hospital to get to rounds. Pulling his white lab coat on over his street clothes, he slipped in the back of the group students. The attending was discussing cases that had come into the hospital the night before.
Moran felt a twist in his stomach. He hadn’t told Moriarty that he and John had become intimate. The only way the man would have known was if he was spying on them too.
“I’m taking Sherlock home.” John practically growled.
“No . . . it wasn’t like that.” The words rushed out of John’s mouth.
“You’re here.” Sherlock answered.
Sherlock glanced at the boy then started to pull his shirt off. “Whose clothes are these, Billy? They don’t belong to Captain Watson.”
“I need a place to live. You need someone to pay half the rent. I can pay for the flat. And you can continue with your studies without hindrance. It seems to me to be a perfect arrangement.” Sherlock closed the book and finally set all of his attention on John.
John tried to cover his laughter as he ate his sandwich. He glanced sideways at Sherlock. The dark haired boy ate the sandwich in three bites. He grabbed John’s beer and took a deep swig. John finished his sandwich and leaned back against the couch. Sherlock had picked up one of John’s roommate’s textbooks and was thumbing through it.
“There seems to be a big secret you’re not telling me.” Sherlock said.
Two real police constables came running down the driveway to the loading docks. The blond stranger grabbed Sherlock’s wrist and yanked him sideways. He pulled the omega towards a waiting car as the police constables shouted at them to stop. The stranger shoved Sherlock into the backseat and raised the gun again. Sherlock ducked as the man fired. Two more rounds in quick succession. The two officers were dead on the ground as the car drove passed them.
“Yeah. The kid and her mother. They’re gone. One of the young men followed and watched them being murdered. He came back and told the elders. They want us to go. They blame us for this.”
The alpha felt a spike of lust rocket through him at the name. Moran smiled at the young man. “You’ll regret that comment.”
It was same man following him for the next four months. John wondered how long the man was going to keep following him. Finally he decide to take things into his own hands. He disregarded the advice he had received from Lestrade and set his own plan into motion.
Sherlock glanced up as soon as the door opened, then his face scowled at the sight of his brother. He quickly returned his attention back to the newspapers, ignoring his brother’s entrance.
