Dean jumps, his eyes snapping open as his heart leaps into his throat, and he sits up.
"Come, darling," Castiel whispers, helping Dean out of the car with a hand. They're back at the palace now, the flood lights illuminating the way across the courtyard, and Dean stumbles along behind Castiel, drunk on hot chocolate and laughter.
And, fuck, why does he even care?
dress him.
“Okay!”
Castiel nods, his face solemn as he continues, and for some reason, it has Dean's heart sinking to his shoes. "He wanted to speak with me about my inappropriate behaviour with the suitors—with you, in particular—and suggested that I pay more attention to the others so as to make this fair."
—he doesn’t want to wake up. Not even for Castiel.
Hey hey!
He’s not dropping all judgment yet, though—he’ll wait until he tastes it first.
Dean looks over at her, a scowl on his face, only to find a raised eyebrow and a teasing smile. “Not a chance,” he says, a grin working its way across his lips. “Besides, wouldn’t want to lose my spot as the favorite, right? One look at you and I’d be old news.”
Castiel looks at him for a moment, his eyes getting more narrowed as a crease forms between his brows. "They're in the hospital wing, Dean. Did you not know?"
Dean laughs at that, feeling a little bit lighter as he pushes to his feet. "I don't know," he tries, forcing a tired smile. "I'd make beautiful babies for you to dress up."
Castiel rolls his eyes, hands travelling over Dean’s heated skin until he finds his lace-clad hips. The grainy texture of the hot pink material under his palms sends heat rushing through his veins, and by the little shiver in Dean’s hands, it does something to him, too.
“Then,” Dean says, shooting Castiel a wink and a smile that he swears makes his prince blush. “Then we’re getting funnel cake and deep fried chocolate bars.”
Susie looks at him for a moment, her deep brown eyes surveying him before she nods. “I’ll be inside.” Then she’s gone, closing the door behind her with a soft click.
"No!" Dean squawks, lunging for the note cards tossed aside on his bed before Castiel can get ahold of them. "Cas! No!" He laughs, scrambling for the cards and ending up on top of Castiel, who is laid out on his stomach, grasping in vain.
“He’s ex-military—a friend of theirs, I think.” Charlie shrugs, her voice raised to an almost-shout as they step through the door and into the cramped, smoky room.
This took sooo long to write and I don't even know why. Okay, I do, but it shouldn't have. Anyway, again, I don't know if there will be two chapters this week because I'm pretty busy, but we'll see.
Dinner isn’t for a few more hours, but nevertheless, he’s ready.
Castiel reaches for his bedside table, pulling out a little white envelope. Dean knows what it is, of course, and so does Hannah.
Shit, that could've been bad, and it's only just hitting him
“Tell me what you need from me.”
They think he attacked Castiel. They think he
“Mr. Winchester,” he says, reaching forward without touching, and the glint in his eyes confuses Dean for only a moment. “Is that mine?”
“Enough,” Castiel says, authority bleeding into his tone. Dean jerks awake, startled by the force of Castiel’s words and blinks in the dark room.
“Fuck, Suse, why aren’t you there? Why weren’t you with him Sunday?” Guilt floods in fast and hard, consuming him with the trivialities of this whole competition, and how everything is put on hold for
Dean bites back the words
“Nope, not a one,” he says, popping the cherry red candy between his lips. “Try down a ways, there’s another motel about a mile back.” He waves a hand in the direction they just came from, and Dean lets out a groan.
“Why the hell would you think something like that?” he says, turning his glare on her and her skintight sequenced blue dress.
Dean smiles, leaning forward to find Jo at the end of the couch next to the one he, Charlie, and Hannah are sitting on. She catches his eye and beams back, still glowing from her date with the prince.
A sigh falls from his lips, and it just keeps on going as his shoulders sag and all the pent up tension leaves him. Before he even really decides to do it, Dean steps out, his umbrella hanging, closed, by his side, and tips his face to the sky.
“You want my help?”
He nods, his heart sinking at the thought of saying goodbye. He doesn’t mention the threat from Lucifer, and she doesn’t mention the posted guards, but the tension is there in everything not said. Things are happening and neither of them is allowed to say a word.
"Susanna Sampson; I should've guessed. Still his highness's lapdog, are you?" Toni, as Susie called her, smirks, lifting a delicate hand to her lips as she crosses the other arm over her stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
His Highness insists he doesn’t pout, but Dean’s sure he catches a jutted lip, and slips him his dinner roll just to see him smile.
“Come on, boy; we have more suits than time.” Susie's sharp voice breaks through the silence, setting the room back in motion as she pulls the first one from a garment bag and helps him into it.
“What?”
“Nine horses?” Dean asks, standing by the stall across from Cookie’s in front of an affectionate Clydesdale. Castiel glances up, his blue eyes shining even in the dim lighting, and he smiles.
When the horse settles, Dean leans closer, and he’s not sure why he does it, but he whispers in the horse’s ear. “You’ll make beautiful babies, Remmie.”
“So, who’s the fan-favorite?” He looks from Hannah to Jo, both of whom are leaning in, chins on their palms, listening intently to Castiel’s every word. Meg giggles like a schoolgirl and Michael is doing his damndest to sound informed but only manages to sound like a pretentious idiot.
“Oh yeah,” Dean breathes, ideas already running through his head on how to improve.
There’s a blur of movement as Castiel grabs him and Dean yelps as he hits the floor, shock rushing though him as his muscles lock up. He tries to move, but there's a weight on his chest, strong hands holding his arms down, and when he pushes up with his legs, knees squeeze at his hips, holding him tight.
“Cas, you know I’m young, right?” He looks up from his phone, the crinkles around his eyes more pronounced in the low lamplight, and the grey patch in his beard clear to see. By all accounts, Dean Winchester is a beautiful being, but no, he’s not young.
Castiel steps out from behind the trees, panting and sweating, followed by a guard. “You had us worried,” Castiel huffs, but the relief is clear in his smile as he steps closer.

“It’s my birthday,” Dean protests, finally swallowing the mush in his mouth. “I can sleep in if I want, and you’re not allowed to be an ass.”
Dean jerks his head in a nod before catching himself and clearing his throat. “I do.” He flinches as something is placed over his head, coming to rest on one shoulder and under the opposite arm. He looks down, his breath snagging when they catch on the golden sash, made from the finest silk and sapphires.
He's imaging the scene now, in depth and with a little smirk, when a hand closes over his mouth and hauls him back, stumbling and terrified. He trips over his own feet, clawing at the hand on his face, but his back hits the wall before he can do much damage.
,” Castiel yells, right in his father’s face.
“All done, boy,” Susie says as she lays a towel over his head and supports his neck as he sits up. She wraps his hair up in the towel, squishing it around to dry it, but a few drops trickle over his forehead and down the bridge of his nose. “When your hair dries a bit, we'll tailor the suits.” She pats him on the shoulders as she stands, leaving him flustered and regretting his decision to sit beside Castiel.
“Dean,” Castiel says, finally meeting his gaze, his voice infinitely softer now. “Come with me.” Then he turns away, his shoes clicking across the marble floors on his way to the grand staircase. Dean follows, ignoring the way the rainbow lights dance over his shoes.
Did they just leave him off the list, or…?
“It’s my favorite,” Castiel says, cutting him off as he pats the pocket where the pendant is stored. “The most thoughtful gift I’ve ever received.”
"Come with me," he says, a grin on his face that's so mischievous that it can't be Castiel's, but the way Dean's heart skips a beat is the same as always, so he follows Castiel down the winding stairs, exhausted and confused, but too curious to tell him no.
“You know,” Castiel mutters, sinking into his chair, and although they don't have any footage of it—switching instead to lunch where Michael is lecturing the staff on the importance of properly folded linens—Dean knows this is about the exact time Castiel walked in on him in the bathroom.
“Thank you for telling me, Dean,” he says, even softer now, and Dean meets his eyes, looking up from the floor as those baby-blues find his. “There is so much I do not see, and I appreciate your honesty more than you will ever know.”
,” Dean grunts, when he practically gets a lap-full of Crown Prince—okay, not quite, but whatever. “Really?” he says, looking at Castiel’s shadowed face with a dry glare.
dammit, and throws the door open, ready to ream the guy out, and—
Dean peeks around the corner, spotting the cart in question, and turns back to Castiel, nodding. "Yeah, the one by the doors?"
Instead of leaving as Dean expects him to, Castiel just waits there, watching Dean with something almost hesitant in his eyes. "Dean, I think you should ask about the show money." Dean stops, his fingers hovering over the call button as his eyes lift to Castiel's, finding worry and more than a little concern there.
“What?” Dean’s eyes snap up to hers. “No! No, you
“Hey! Look who it is!”
God, those beautiful, too-blue eyes. They’re exhausted—creased with whatever emotion he’s holding back—and so painfully unhappy that Dean swears he’ll do whatever it takes to make it better—
“I thought you would.” With a sharp nod, he turns to Peter and starts giving instructions.
For the first time since that night in January, when his parents tossed his things out on the lawn, and him right behind, he feels hope. He feels

He’s gone.
sad. He can’t show it, though, because it’s his birthday, and all his friends are here, trying to act like they all aren’t thinking the same thing.
Dean’s feet slip out from under him, and there’s about half a second between falling, and realizing he won’t stop when he hits the mud, where his heart sinks and his breath snags in his throat.
"He said it wouldn't matter what I said—that they wouldn't look at it anyway." Dean raises an eyebrow as he waits for an explanation, and Castiel huffs out a tiny laugh.
“We’re playing Scrabble,” Castiel says, like that’s the only thing they could possibly be doing in here. “And eating lunch. There is nothing
Victor arches an eyebrow, watching Dean with keen interest as he flops back on a hay bale beside Caesar, who Dean’s only met once before. “Oh?”
“Did you make that?” Castiel asks, taking a closer look as Sam lowers himself into it, his ripped pyjama pants not quite covering his leg above his cast.
“That why the stable hand laughed?” Dean asks, ducking his head as he rests on hand on his knee and the other on his aching hip. He can't look at Castiel right now, no matter how good he looks with a horse pressed up against him like he's the only person in the world she wants to see.
“Did you tell Cas that?” Sam asks, and Dean’s getting really fucking tired of the tone. “Jerk,” he adds on for good measure, and Dean throws him the finger. Not that he see it, but whatever.
"Dean." Castiel's voice carries from the other end of the hall as Dean pulls the door closed behind him after his interview.
With a deep, building flush, Dean stutters, “I, uh… well, I—”
“That’s not it, is it?” Lucifer mutters, then glances to where Dean’s standing, wringing his hands while chewing on his bottom lip. “Why don’t Dean and I have a little duel after I kick your ass, huh? I won’t go so easy, you know, and the man has too much pride to say no to me. Do you Dean?”
“Okay…” His eyes flick across the lines as he mouths the words. “Would you mind speaking about the events of last Monday? What was that about?”
who's favorite you want to be.”
Dean raises his flute to the others before tossing it back, feeling bubblier than the liquid in his glass.
His nails catch on the old wood, sliding down, down, down until they meet the tiny hole in the frame. Dean slides his lock-picks free with trembling hands, praying to anyone who will listen that he can steady them enough to get the job done.
"Oh my God,
Or maybe it’s just pain, but either way, he’s sick with it, and he wrenches the oven door open for something to look at rather than the smile on Castiel’s face—no matter if his pie is finished or not.

The rest of the drive is filled with laughter and music, drinking and joking, and by the time the car pulls to a stop about an hour from the palace, the music pumping in Dean’s ears isn’t just their own.
mistake, and
“Suse, I need to tell you something,” Dean says, then looks to the rest of the girls, who lean in to hear.
“What can I do for you, Dean?”
The grand ballroom—easily filled with two hundred people—falls into a hush so absolute chills race down Dean’s spine as they wait for the doors to open one more time.
,” Dean moans, feeling every part of him. The stretch hurts a little, sure, but when Castiel shifts his hips, pulling out a fraction of an inch before pushing back in, a shiver zips up his spine.
“Nonsense,” Castiel says, waving Dean off with a gloved hand as he stands. “Bring me to them.”
"And the worst?" He's not even sure he

, he thinks, and she must read his thoughts on his face because she gives him the dirtiest, darkest look he's ever seen.
When he goes on waiting for longer than he thinks it should take for Benny to come back with information, he huffs, annoyance bubbling inside him as he pushes up from the bed and strips out of his suit.
"Morning, Cas," Dean drawls as his stomach flips, butterflies fluttering like mad. Sweet, sugary warmth floods him as he cocks his head to one side, biting his bottom lip and trying not to smile too wide.
That’s got Dean’s fingers freezing on his buttons. He looks up to meet Castiel’s eyes, hope blossoming in his chest when he finds nothing but pure honestly staring back.
"No," Dean says, cutting him off, and Castiel's head pops up as shock fills his eyes.
.” There’s a pause, and Dean’s eyes flick back and forth between the two, who seem to be having a private conversation that no one else is privy to. Dean’s stomach twists when Susie nods and drops his wrist—nothing good can come from this.
The backyard isn’t much to look at, so he doesn’t, ignoring the new stack of tires from the shop and the broken down, rusted out car he’d once hoped to inherit.
“That would be me.”
“Hm,” Castiel hums, eyebrows furrowed. “Would you mind taking off the jacket? I would like to see your range of motion—”
“Come on,” Charlie whispers, bouncing on the balls of her feet as she looks around. “And don’t rip those jeans; they’re actually nice.” Dean shoots her a glare, which she pretends not to see, and lets himself fall the rest of the way, landing with a soft thud on his good side.
“You really should still be in bed, your highness,” Russell says, close enough to Castiel’s ear that the rest of them shouldn’t be able to hear, but Dean’s paying attention—he’s
kind of news.
“She let you one once, I’m sure she’ll let you on again.” He nods for Dean to get on, but Dean hovers around the horse’s side, unsure of what to do. He had help the first time, but he doesn’t dare ask for it from Castiel. Hannah would be fairly useless in boosting him up and Charlie will just make fun of him every day for the rest of the time they're both here.
Fuck it.
“Your highness? Lunch is being served.”
"Oh," Charlie says, frowning but not bothering to argue. "Okay, then. We'll uh... we’ll see you later."
"Stop that," Castiel says, gripping Dean's chin with a force he does expect. Castiel gives him a little shake until he opens his eyes.
“Sit, Cas,” Dean says, fingers brushing his sleeve as Castiel turns into him. Whether consciously or not, Dean doesn’t know, but the smile on Castiel’s lips, soft and sweet, has him realizing he doesn’t really care, either.
The words, clear as day even without touching the paper, chill Dean to the core.
“What?” Dean pops his head up, heat rising in his cheeks. He thinks he did pretty well, but how is he to say if he’s
“Dean, quit harassing my staff,” Castiel says, not quite so serious now, his own rubber mallet in hand.
“What? Uh,” Dean gapes, his eyes roaming over Novak’s broad shoulders and totally lick-able jawline. “No. No, they—no.” He shakes his head, grimacing like the thought is repulsive. “Jo is like a sister to me, Anael doesn’t

Not really, but he lets that slide.

Besides, Benny’s watching him like a vengeful hawk by the rose bushes, and there’s no way he wouldn’t tell Susie on him. He kind of likes this suit, too—the pastel turquoise is nice, and it’s one of the normal ones without the lung-crushing add-on.
The sun filters through the windows, harsh and bright, heating Dean’s face and warming the room until he can’t stand to be under the blankets a second longer.
Dean turns his nose up at them. It's an unconscious reaction, but he regrets it as soon as he looks up and finds a camera trained on his face.

“You’re so good to me,” he says, placing a hand over his heart and completely missing Charlie’s next serve because of it. “Hey,” Dean snaps, tossing the ball back.

“What? No, no,” Sam says, shaking his head so vigorously, his hair sticks out at odd angles. “I’ve got my own chair, see?” He nods at his mashup chair, put together using different parts from broken, battered, and ripped chairs he’s found by the roadside over the years. It’s actually a really comfortable chair, though Dean would never admit it out loud.
“You did
that makes this place less lonely for the prince.
Instead of responding, Castiel slips the fork from Dean's fingers and takes a bite of his perfect peach pie, making sure to get extract filling. Heat bubbles low in his stomach as Castiel makes sure to clean off the tines before handing it back.
Dean’s blush deepens. “He’s… yeah, Mom. I really like him.” Dean nods for good measure, forgetting all about the cameras watching his every move and recording his every word. He changes the subject. “I made some friends, too; I’m not completely alone. Oh! Here,” he snags Charlie’s arm as she walks by, ignoring her disgruntled yelp as he turns back to his mom. “This is Charlie.”
Castiel scowls at him—that famous Novak scowl—and it almost makes Dean smile as he reaches up to push back a wayward strand of hair.
Charlie’s eye-roll, but he doesn’t turn to check as he watches Castiel pluck a flower from the earth and hand it to Kelly. It’s not a blue rose, but a daisy and Dean knows Castiel is just being nice, but it doesn’t stop his stomach from twisting itself into knots at the sight.
His hands clench in the cushion beneath him as he doubles over, trying to stay quiet even though he wants to scream because

“Would I have to?”
“Keep Benny with you at all times; if the people who sent the letter have the ability to bypass security with mail, there is nothing to say they can’t breach the walls of this palace as well…” Dean can practically see Castiel’s mind whirring as he thinks everything through. “I need you to check in a few times a day, as well. With me, preferably, but if you must, it can be with Susie. Actually, it’s probably best if you wear a tracking device, just in case—”
When Dean finally gathers the courage to straighten up—

“Yeah,” Dean says, pulling his hand back as he straightens his jacket and waits for Castiel to give the signal.
. Because stuff like this doesn't happen to him. The Crown Prince doesn't just throw himself at people like Dean—it would be too perfect—and yet, here he is, grinding down on the man's lap, feeling like every part of heaven is falling down around him, soaking him in its glory.
person has come to get his side of the story, and he’s starting to worry that they’re not going to.
Castiel lets out a surprised laugh and shakes his head. “Well, alright. I suppose I can show you how.” He takes a step closer to Dean—only an inch or two apart—and points at the saddle. “You need to grab here, put your foot in the stirrup, and pull yourself up. Like this,” Castiel demonstrates, swinging himself up and over in one smooth motion before sliding off again. “Now, you try.”
“Boy, where are you?”
“Oh, honey you look wonderful!” His mom gushes as he steps into the tiny kitchen where she’s cooking beet soup for the fifth time this week—after twenty-four years, he’s slowly getting used to the smell but his nose still wrinkles when he wraps his arms around her.
Dean’s stomach summersaults, dipping, and diving—threatening his dinner—when the doors crack open and Castiel steps through in a simple black suit with a sapphire tie to match the ten long-stemmed roses on the table waiting to be given out.
Dinner is as lively as ever, but Dean’s not feeling it.
He peels one eye open, scowling at the shadowed face of his prince as he smiles down at him, relief flooding in to drown the panic Dean can see waning in his eyes. “What time is it?” Dean croaks, rolling over and looking around the room for a clock. He rubs both hands over his aching eyes before tossing the blanket aside, untangling it from around his legs.
“You’re the one with cock-sucking lips, baby,” he says, then swipes his tongue over Dean’s cock, letting it catch on the head before dipping into the slip.
, Suse. Please don’t.” He drops the square of cheddar he’d been nibbling on and turns to her more fully.
Dean startles so badly, he drops his bacon, tossing it into the bushes for the bunnies to find. With a pout and a huff, he looks up to find sharp blue eyes watching him from mere feet away.
“Number seven—Meg Masters, for being mean to Dean Winchester, uh…” Her voice lifts at the end, as if in a question, and Dean huffs—did she not prepare this at all? It’s like the first time she’s reading through her cards—
"Morning, Prince Novak.” Dean forces a smile, but it's shaky. All the confusion and anger from the night before swells up again and he has to force it back down so he doesn't burst into an angry rant or collapse in tears.
“I was worried,” Dean says, wandering further into the massive room. “You never miss breakfast, so I thought maybe you weren’t feeling well. I don’t know why I thought visiting was a good idea, but—”
Shit, Dean’s so fucked.
But Dean’s too busy trying not to shiver as Castiel’s breath whispers in his ear, his chest practically right up tight to Dean’s back, and he’s only human, you know—he can only take so much before he melts into a puddle at his prince’s feet.
There’s a collective gasp from everyone in the room as Castiel flinches away, and Meg doesn’t seem to realize her transgression until a royal guard steps between them, glaring at Meg but speaking to the group.
Castiel doesn’t answer. Just shakes his head and looks down at the floor. “Come on,” he says, holding out a hand for Dean to take. “Let’s go meet the children.”
“There you go, Mr. Winchester; all set for breakfast.” Susie smiles, close-lipped and proud, with her hands on her hips as Dean steps off his platform in his expensive leather shoes.
. But the look in her eyes tells him there’s not, and Dean drops down onto the bed beside her, at a loss for words.
Private insurance doesn’t work, and it needs to change.
Then, the doors swing open and the trumpets play as the crowd splits in two, allowing the suitors to enter as they were all taught. Dean is at the back of the line since his name was the last called but, in his nervousness, he forgets to watch what happens with the suitors before him.
A few things:
staring at him.
Also, this one is fairly long, too.
a good guy?” Sam quirks a disbelieving eyebrow at Dean, telling him without words that that’s the biggest load of bull-crap he’s ever heard.
Pain explodes in Dean’s jaw, knocking him to the side a few steps as his hand flies to his face.
Dean turns left down the hall, heading for his room. It’s just about time for his turn anyway, so if he waits there, he shouldn’t miss out.
“Castiel,” Dean returns, a smile on his face as he nods. He watches Castiel as he walks back to his throne and, once again, the crowd parts for him before meeting back in the middle to hide him from view.
He can do this. He
“Oh God, I don’t even know, uh…” Dean looks to the ceiling, to the cherubs painted in soft pastels, and tries to remember what he ate while worrying about his prince. “Bacon. There was definitely bacon. And pancakes I think? I didn’t eat much, honestly.” And now that he thinks of it, he’s fucking hungry.
"Oh, Castiel!" Fuck.
"What would you like us to do, your highness?"
Then he's gone and Dean's left standing there smiling like an idiot at the empty hallway, the prince's handkerchief still twisted around his fingers.
, Dean,” Hannah says, smiling as she rolls her eyes. “Ever heard of it?”
"It feels fake, honestly—like someone made a mistake while counting the votes." Another nervous laugh as he pushes a hand through his hair. Honestly, though? He's not even joking because it all feels like one giant
Castiel finally manages to swallow. “Is that not what you are doing here? Swarming me with your admiration?”

Hannah folds her arms over her chest, her silk dressing gown rippling in the cool night air.

"Could it be a food allergy?" Dean asks, hoping that's the case because his other suspicion is far more sinister.
Instead, he heads back to his room. There’s not much else to do, and his jacket has some mud spots—God forbid Susie sees them—so maybe he’ll raid his closet and play dumb when she grills him about why he changed.
With a heavy sigh, Castiel shakes his head. "No, thank you, Dean," he says. Then, not quite loud enough to be meant for Dean's ears, "I'm in enough trouble as it is."

There's a commotion in the background—blurred, but there's definitely something wrong—and Hannah's smile falters as she looks over her shoulder.
’ that’s different from how he looks at the others, surely. And was that even an apology? Shit, he thinks there was a ‘sorry’ in there somewhere, but it sounded more like a fuck-ton of excuses than anything.
“Get out,” Dean says, hauling Castiel’s door open. Cas just looks at him, wide-eyed and confused, but he doesn’t move, seatbelt still fastened, hands folded in his lap.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean breathes, pulling off for just a second and pushing Castiel’s knees apart until his hips ache and he’s ready to beg for Dean to finish. White hot pleasure rips through him as Dean bobs his head, picking up speed as his hips grind down on Castiel’s face, and he’s so close—right on the edge, looking over into bliss. If Dean would just—

"He ignored you? Just like that?" Dean leans a bit closer, but ducks behind the wall when Castiel glances up, his heart skipping a beat as his breath catches, but he doesn't think he's been spotted. "I can't imagine anyone ignoring a lovely lady such as yourself."
For a moment, Dean's too shocked to answer, and Castiel must take it as a refusal because he drops his head and turns away, muttering an apology under his breath.
"Who styled this travesty?" she mumbles, digging through her bags and not paying attention as Dean combs his hair into a mohawk. "It's embarrassing, honestly—"

Dean throws his door open, not bothering to lock it behind him, and hurries down the empty hallway. He needs a distraction,

Dean opens his mouth to respond—what he plans to say, he's not sure—but they both jump when a shrill, feminine voice reaches them from across the field. Dean whips around, eyes wide and heart racing, but it sinks when he sees her majesty, the queen, losing her shit on Victor.
“Cas.”
Castiel pushes to his feet, face impassive to anyone who looks, but Dean knows better—he can see the hard set to his jaw and the tension in his eyes as he leaves to deal with the mess. Dean turns back to his meal, ignoring the commotion.
The relief that washes over Dean snuffs out his blush and he nods—maybe a bit too emphatically, because Charlie arches an eyebrow and April and Kelly look between he and Castiel like they’re missing something. Michael looks pissed, Meg has a keen, penetrating glare aimed at him, and Hannah and Sarah both just look a little sad.
He does look better, actually, but not so much better that Dean would consider giving him a clean bill of health and setting him free on a date with Hannah.

Just thinking of Castiel gives him the warm and fuzzies, melting his fears in seconds and making him feel more secure than he ever has. What will he do without that man, when he's sent home and never gets to see him again? Or worse, he has to see him with someone else?
“That’s kind of the point, yeah,” Charlie says, snark so thick in her tone, Dean’s surprised she doesn’t choke on it.
He can’t even imagine how this looks to Castiel—Dean’s got blood pouring from his temple, smudged make-up and is covered in neon paint. He’s a mess; the exact opposite of royal decorum, and shame slams into him so hard and fast, he nearly chokes on it. What was he thinking?
“They’re atrocious! Stop moving before I poke your eye out!” Susie moves back in as Dean glares, and she rolls her eyes. “By accident, obviously. They’re your best feature, so sit still.” She grips his chin to make sure he obeys, getting right up in his face while ignoring his pout with steadfast determination.
Again, Castiel laughs as Charlie opens the deck and sinks to the floor, sitting with her legs crossed and her back to the chair as she shuffles.
The crowd of guests don’t pay any attention to him as he moves through them, but the cameras do. There’s at least one on him at all times, and he’s not sure it’s something he’ll ever get used to.
So, he paces.
“I don’t see how this will be easier.”
Dean huffs, scowls, and glares at the back of his head, beyond confused, before Castiel pivots to walk backwards, watching him with a smirk. "I didn't flirt with your aunt—wait," Dean cuts himself off, eyes widening as horror sinks his stomach. His voice chokes off into a strangled whisper. "That was your aunt? Your… the
"She saved my life that day," he whispers, feeling Castiel's attention like a physical presence as a lump forms in his throat. "And I've been trying to repay her every day since."
"That one," Dean says automatically, pointing to one with grey and blue accents. It's subtle and professional—exactly what he’s trying for.
“Let me kiss you,” Dean blurts, and maybe he’d be a little more embarrassed if he wasn’t so drunk. As it stands, he can’t stop staring at Castiel’s lips.
Seems like Susie’s given up on getting him to eat his greens since the plate is more or less piled with anything but. Although, that could be because the meal she brought him is from lunch.
take a nap, let his body rest through this not-cold, but, honestly, he’s kind of hungry, and they’re coming up on dinner, but Castiel makes the rules, so…
"Alright, Crown-Prince-turned-military-officer," Dean says, looking away as Castiel removes his hand. "Just send me home before you kick my ass, huh?" Just the thought has Dean's heart sinking like a stone. He forces a chuckle but it falls flat, and he can't bring himself to look at Castiel, who doesn’t say a word.
“Of course he does,” Dean snaps, swallowing the food in his mouth before continuing, his irritation rising with every passing second. “He’s not heartless; he cares about his people and what they think of him.”
! You've
’ This is what the Crown Prince has ordered, and you are not to argue. Step out of the pants,” she says when she gets them to his ankles, and he does as he’s told. When she looks at him in his ratty underwear, she tsks, and humiliation floods hot and prickling through his veins, but it’s nothing compared to the utter mortification he feels when she tugs them down, exposing him in the middle of the room before telling him to step out of those, too.
“Oh, now I see it—the proposal,” he says, almost to himself, and Castiel could smack him. After a moment, thought, the teasing falls away, and he’s beaming. “Yes, my love, ‘course I’ll marry you.”
And then?
Castiel thinks about it for a moment, bringing his hands to rest on Dean’s hips and ignoring the way his breath hitches. Eventually, his shoulders sag and he nods. “I suppose you’re right,” he murmurs, stepping closer to Dean like he doesn’t even know he’s doing it.
He pours himself some water and spoons some ravioli onto his plate, his stomach already growling at the smell wafting from them—olive oil and parmesan,
“Jesus,” he whispers, only now seeing just how bad he looked. He can hear Benny both behind him and on-screen; right now, he's muttering about what a fucking idiot Dean is, while on-screen, he's yelling.
like he does, and that makes all the difference.
“I’m being charged with assault,” Dean says, throwing it out there like a comment on the weather, hoping Charlie’s reaction will be just as casual.
Benny doesn’t bother repeating himself, grabbing Dean’s cards and tossing them aside, instead, before leading him out of the room.
His head snaps up as his heart leaps into his throat. The voice is far off, but worried, and it sends a trickle of unease down his spine.
“Well, I don’t think I’d make it to any sort of championships, but I’m not too bad, huh?” Dean grins, pushing away from the fence as Castiel quirks an eyebrow. Dean turns away, his focus back on the ball, and this time, when Charlie sends it flying over the net and Dean swings like mad, he manages to hit it square in the middle of his racket. It flies back at Charlie so fast that she misses. For a minute, they're both too shocked to react.
“Guards! Oh, good. These…
Dean frowns, jerking away from the grabby hands. What the hell is he doing? "Can you not?" He bats the man's hands away and wipes the clammy sweat from his face.
Dean makes sure to tuck a hat in his pocket as he wanders down the halls, in no hurry to sweat any more than he already is, but when he steps out the front doors and onto the steps, he’s thankful for the extra layers.
to tell him. It's all too much—too fucking much—and he should trust his prince, same as he sees all that precious trust Castiel has in him. He should believe in the fact that Castiel is a powerful man; that he can protect Dean's family, and keep him safe, too.
what he knows. I broke the rules, according to them, and…and I’ll be—fuck.” He buries his face in his hands, his breaths shuddering out of him as he draws his knees up to his chest.
So many things to learn, and only the Pride-themed Google logo standing in his way. Castiel snaps Dean’s laptop shut. He needs to get one for himself, but—
"How's it going, Lee? Long time, no see." Dean pulls back, slapping his friend’s shoulder before looking him up and down. "You look good."
Dean's face screws up. "Wha—"
"Like I was poisoned," she grumbles, taking a sip from her cup before handing it back. "Who the fuck does that, anyway?"
"One for another time, yes," he says, shooting Dean a wink as they show the attendant their wristbands. Dean's heart does a little flutter, like they're already on the ride, spinning round and round and round, but he just smiles back now, and he doesn't feel sick, and his feet are on solid ground, and Castiel just won't stop
"Hey, babe," Charlie whispers, offering him a small smile as Dean settles onto the cushion. His head still feels like it's filled with sludge, and the ache has moved behind his eyes, but he forces his face into a half-smile. "How're you feeling?"

That is, if the cute, bespectacled librarian with the bedhead and lovely blue eyes stays that long. He’s absorbed in his book, one cheek smooshed in his palm, elbow resting on the desk, with the other propping his book open in front of him.
She waves him off and takes a step back, still smiling, though not as wide—it’s gone soft and fond. “Just don’t go screwing up your makeup again, Mr. Winchester.”
Dean doesn’t get a chance to talk to Castiel when he gets back from his date, and his prince doesn’t come to find him, either. He runs the article through his head over and over, the words burnt into his mind from hours of going over it again and again.
“—I’m shocked you had the nerve to stand there and suggest it—”
“Don’t know,” Charlie says, and picks up her spoon. “We’ll find out after dinner.”
What's this? Another chapter? So soon?
“You’re rarely right.”
“Stop.” He holds up his hands, shaking his head, but Dean’s not fucking finished.
"It's so good to see Castiel again, as well—"

“Yes, boy. You need more suits, now come on.” She tosses him a robe before turning her back to him and marching down the hall.

like that!” His shout echoes through the hall, ricocheting off the stained glass and miles of marble, but he doesn’t break his harsh stare. “You tell him, or I will. That’s the end of it.”
Why couldn’t they just let him go quietly? Is the show really that important that they need to put him through every bit of suffering they can, just to get the viewers? If he had any energy at all, he’d be pissed as all hell, but as it stands, he can’t even summon up the enthusiasm to speak to his friends, who are currently doing their damnedest to cheer him up and make him smile.
Deep and blue and full of too many things to name. God, Dean’s missed him, and even if that look only lasts a second before it’s gone, it’s better than anything he’s had all weekend.

“Honestly? No. The prince might not think he did it on purpose, but he still did it.” Sarah, that’s definitely Sarah. “But, going on a date with Lily? I don’t know, Kels…”

Sitting up, he punches his pillow before falling back with a huff.

“No, Cas. I ate too much food. It’s funny.” It
Dean huffs, dropping back into the seat beside the hospital bed Castiel is propped up in. “For making you skate, dumbass.”
Suitors peel off from the group with their guards one by one until Dean is the only one left walking down the hall. He’s surprised when they reach the end and turn the corner, but when a set of double doors is opened in front of him, he’s anything but disappointed.
“Why haven’t you got…”
“You think?”
Dean’s careful not to drip sauce on the floors as he eats, wiping his mouth, not on his sleeve, but his napkin. You know, like a grownup. He finds himself about halfway up the grand staircase in the entryway, watching the sun filter through the stained-glass windows above the double doors.
Hellooo! It is, in fact, my week off, and here I am working on like four fics, but I HAD to get this chapter written.
“It’s uncomfortable,” Dean whines, but Susie doesn’t fall for it, as he knew she wouldn’t.
"Just get out of here," Mick says, waving at the door. "Can't use any of this crap, anyway."
tied neatly around his best friend’s neck. The crisp, white button down hugs Castiel’s broad shoulders like a glove, tapering down at his waist in a way that has Dean’s hands itching to touch.
“Yeah, a regular fancy-pants,” Sam cuts in, and his dad smacks him on the back of the head.
“Go get showered,” Benny says, lifting a hand to shove him away before thinking better of it and letting his arm fall to his side. “And keep that thing in a sling for a few days—I’ll have one dropped off. You should ice it, too. And heat. Ice, then heat.” Benny looks him over one more time, eyes shrewd. “I’ll send someone up to look at those cuts. They can give you painkillers if you need them.”
“I really shouldn’t tease you like this,” Lydia is saying, egging the crowd on as Dean smiles at his prince. Their time is up—the camera awaits. “Alright, alright,” she says, giving a silent signal with a flick of her wrist. “If we can get his royal highness and our fan-favourite, Dean Winchester, to come on out…”
All around the circle, Dean is met with strained looks that surely match his own. He’s got a knot in his stomach, twisting its way into his heart. He takes another swig of his beer as the temperature in the room kicks up a notch or two.
Castiel looks up at him with startled blue eyes, like he can’t possibly understand why Dean feels the need to apologize. “Whatever for?”
“The hell do you want?” Charlie snaps as she and Hannah get to their feet.
It’s like a bucket of ice water over his head, and a sick knot twists in Dean’s stomach when Castiel turns away. He’s still talking, saying something about taking the pills with food and making sure to keep the sling on for a few days. He says a nurse will check up on him before bed.

Still, he throws in two chips, keeping his face as impassive as he can. “Two,” he says, calling his bet.
“Number nine goes to, and I quote, ‘The one with the pickle up his ass.’” She cringes, but Dean laughs, knowing for damn sure it isn’t him this time as he watches Michael shift in his seat from the corner of his eye. “Michael Haven!”
“‘Course I will!” He turns the corner, once again leaving Dean alone.
Pain swells up like a rising tide, coming in fits and bursts with every blow, but growing steadily in the background. It compounds, building and building and building until blood seeps from deep cuts, warming his icy skin.
Honestly, this is the last thing that should be on his mind, what with the Fan-Favorites interview tonight, and what a colossal shit-show that’s bound to be, but it’s not.
Anyway, have some dramatic, doomsday Dean, and maybe a surprise visitor? Let me know what you think!
He knows it’s here; he saw it this morning while searching for Castiel’s gifted handkerchief, and—
“Yes. Of course, yes.” Dean beams, taking the rose from Castiel, their fingers brushing, as they always do.
When the hall is silent, the echo of footsteps long faded, Kelly pounces, her fingernails digging in and drawing his attention back to her. “What did you tell him, Dean? You didn’t rat me out, did you?”

“How can I choose my favourite? They are all so wonderful in their own way.” What a fucking professional. Honestly, Dean’s over here choking on his heart and Castiel’s as cool as a cucumber. It’s not fair, but Dean’s not about to begrudge him his interview skills.
And Castiel could

The look Castiel gives him shuts him up real fast, but the adorable blush doesn’t go unseen, either, and Dean grins wide and wicked. “I’ll be damned, Cas—you’re a blushing virgin.”

Dean drops to the fountain’s edge, facing the grand balcony as he contemplates just falling back into the tumbling water. He could sink into the shallow pool—it wouldn’t even cover his face… probably—and forget for a while. He could do it, but what’s the point?
“Stand still,” Susie snaps, tugging at the cord zigzagging down his back like she’s trying to squeeze the air from his lungs. He feels like the Pilsbury doughboy, crammed into a too-small tube, seconds away from bursting at the seams.
It isn't until after lunch, when Dean knows he's already inside, that things get a bit interesting.
Castiel ignores him, “But I thought your opinion would be more helpful.” He clears his throat, nerves buzzing like bumblebees in his veins. “The Google says people tend to wear flashy colours to the Pride, or they dress rather… provocatively. I’m not comfortable with that, as you know—”
Castiel just laughs and laughs, keeping a firm grip on his wrists as he trails his fingers up to Dean's armpits, digging in hard just to hear Dean’s pleas.
“Oh, please. Your willy isn’t the first I’ve seen.” She rolls her eyes and takes a seat in the corner, her legs crossed and hair in curlers. Dean’s certain she’s not supposed to be here, and he’s almost positive she snuck away.
“Yes, my darling?” Castiel murmurs, turning to meet Dean’s eyes as the doors close with a resounding
Charlie grins, forgetting her anger entirely, and Dean would be lying if he said she doesn’t scare him a little. “You’re on, pretty boy.”
“Well,” Castiel says, taking the phone from Dean’s hands with a gentle insistence. “
Almost as a collective unit, they turn to face the balcony where all eight members of the royal family will emerge. Both the king and queen, and their six children, ranging in age from twenty-one to seven, with Castiel being the eldest of the brood and, therefore, the heir to the throne.
“Here,” Charlie says, looking from side to side, then back from where they came, before she pushes the handle down on the double doors in front of them and steps inside with Dean on her heels.
, he thinks,
He'd already decided he would, but the way Castiel asks—with so much earnest feeling in every syllable—has tears welling in Dean's eyes and spilling down his cheeks as he sits there, astonished by the fear he sees in his prince.

and let me do my
Castiel’s voice, tinny in the shitty payphone, shaking from the cold, rings in his ears as he and Charlie make their way to the subway among a swell of other paraders.
Then Castiel lets him go, and Dean can’t help but miss the contact. Every time Castiel touches him—even the smallest graze of his fingers—makes it harder and harder to let it go. He doesn’t want to think about having to go home and never see this place again—he doesn’t
After a moment, Castiel sucks in a deep, shuddering breath and reaches out a hand to twine his fingers with Dean's, stealing the air from his lungs when their skin touches. “The other night, my father called for me," Castiel says, squeezing Dean's fingers to catch his attention, and Dean looks up from where his hand is tingling with little shivers of awareness, meeting his eyes.
Castiel’s free hand smooths up Dean’s side, sending tingles along his over-sensitized skin, but he doesn’t protest, pulling his fingers free before Dean feels the blunt head of Castiel’s cock pressing against his prepped hole. Dean tenses almost on instinct.
“Anytime,” the guy says, already turning back to whatever computer game he’s got pulled up. Dean rolls his eyes, not bothering to look back as he pushes through the grimy front door and steps into the even grimier parking lot—which is empty, by the way. Maybe two cars, and he’s sure one of them belongs to shaggy in there. The other is Baby, parked in a dark corner, hidden in shadow.
“I’m the king, boy,” he says, raising an eyebrow and straightening his crown. “I can do what I want.”
“God, Cas,” Dean says, peeking through one eye as he rubs the other and finding his prince in silk pyjamas and a thick, cozy-looking robe. “When you said, ‘until the sun rises again,’ I didn’t think you meant that literally.” If he had, he would’ve told the bastard not to bother.
“Mr. Laffite,” he says, pressing on the device.
Dean huffs as he stumbles into the changing room wall, his foot caught in his pants as he struggles to pull them up. God, who would've thought he'd forget how to dress himself after only four weeks?
Charlie grins as she bounces the ball once more.
.” Michael’s voice is cold and detached—not nearly as full of malice as Meg’s, but Dean would say that’s just because he doesn’t care.
“I’m sorry,” Dean blurts, ashamed of his lack of restraint, but Castiel shakes his head.
"You will do no such thing!" Susie smacks his arm, cutting him off before he can finish his sentence, but there's a hint of a smile on her lips, so mission accomplished.
"I won't do that to my child, Dean," Castiel whispers when his shuddering breaths even out again, so cracked and vulnerable it makes Dean's heart ache. Castiel shakes his head, whipping it back and forth like the very idea of subjecting a child to the same thing he was forced into is the worst thing he could possibly do. "I don't care about tradition, or ancestry, or what's deemed
Dean drags one of the armchairs out of the sitting area to the side of Castiel’s bed, his back to the door so he can take in the rest of the room. “Nice place,” he says, eyeing the high, domed ceilings, wall of arching windows, and the length of the room from end to end. There’s a seating area just in the alcove adjacent from the bed, which sits just inside the door. Further in, the room transforms into a library, a grand piano sitting in the center, with doors shooting off into what Dean assumes are his closets and a bathroom.
To Dean’s relief, most of the ideas are so-so, if not just
“Is that right?” She drops back into her own chair, looking comfy in old jeans and one of his dad’s ratty sweatshirts. “Sounds like your mother raised you right. Please, have a seat.”
He chokes it back, nodding once and giving a half-hearted shrug before hissing when pain lances through his shoulder.
Dean goes without a fight, his fingers clutched in hers, as his other hand holds his shots. It’s a bit awkward with his arm in a sling, but he makes it work. Before long, though, he’s downing those, too, feeling the tingling warmth of strong liquor and sweet bumble berry-orange, his lips stained with the fiery colour.
Dean’s heart clenches and he hopes to God the cameras don’t catch him flinch.
"How was your night, your highness?" April asks from across the table. She flips her hair over her shoulder and smiles, twirling her fork between her fingers.
“Probably not.” Dean shrugs, thinking it’s probably best to talk to Castiel first, if at all, because as it stands, Castiel doesn’t appear to care, and isn’t that the most unnerving part of all of it?
. The marshmallows are long gone, melted into the swirling brown liquid, but Dean can still taste them and a soft moan slips from his lips with the first sip.
“Dean!”
“I fell,” he says, huffing his annoyance. Fuck, can they just get on with it? He’s tired.
"It would be rather amusing," Castiel muses, so close to Dean that he feels his breath on his lips. "Though I'd hate to see you embarrassed."
It only lasts a few seconds—maybe less, but who’s counting?—before Castiel pulls away with a gasp.
,” Castiel cries, back arching, hips canting, and heart racing as everything inside him clenches when Dean’s finger grazes his tight, puckered hole. He’s coming harder than he has in forever, and Dean takes it all.
They’re chatting away, smiling and flushed as their date comes to an end. No one notices Dean there. He thinks about letting them pass by—thinks about sinking into the shadows and letting the whole thing go so he can live without the fear of losing everyone he loves—but the ceremony is in twenty minutes.
pathetic."
He can feel eyes on the back of his head as he leads Castiel up to his parents, who are turned away, and he knows Castiel is watching him as he rests a hand on his mother’s shoulder.
And his God. What would he say?
“A toast!”
Dean scrunches up his nose and drops his hands to his sides before he does something stupid like drag Castiel in for a kiss.
Dean's breath catches in his throat when Castiel pulls him to a stop, his strong fingers gripping Dean's elbow as he pulls him around. He can't look at Castiel, though, and keeps his eyes on the expensive button-down clinging to Castiel's chest and torso.
He can hear it now, through the years and the fears and the tears.
The guards—and Dean’s relatively certain that they
No hello. No smile or wave. Nothing.
, and he’s allowed to make mistakes and get angry, and say things he doesn’t mean.” Dean shoots up from his chair, his head spinning and stomach turning, but too angry to sit still, and now that he’s started, he can’t stop.
It's a pleasure to meet you—
"Well..." He shrugs, an awkward, uncomfortable little grin twitching his lips. "I'm happy to still be here, obviously, but," he pauses, a sigh escaping him as his shoulders sag and he looks at the ceiling. "It was hard seeing Jo get sent home, especially after how excited she was about her date on Wednesday. She didn't expect it at all, and I'm sure I won't, either, when it happens, but..." He shrugs again, the pit in his stomach souring as he imagines how Jo must feel. "I don't blame Cas, obviously—I can't even begin to understand how hard this is for him—but she was completely blindsided, you know?"
“I’ll take that, thank you, Mick.” Duma snatches the pages from Mick’s hands, reading through them quickly before ripping it up. “That footage is inadmissible, and you
“Thanks.” Dean looks them over, noticing a glow to his mother that he hasn’t seen in years, and he swears Sammy’s grown another inch in the last week. His dad just looks proud. “You all look nice,” Dean says, returning the compliment, and he means it. His mom is in a beautiful, soft blue dress, with long, flowing sleeves and a conservative neckline—his dad wears his nice suit, and Sammy is in a newer one of Dean’s old suits. They all look damn good.
Dean takes the save for what it is and turns his back on his friends to step up to the empty rose podium, taking the offered champagne. Dean smiles when Castiel meets his eyes.
"You'd think," Susie agrees, one thin, perfectly plucked eyebrow arching as she looks down her nose at him.
One moment, they’re in the dark, and the next, the church explodes with blinding colour. So vivid and vibrant, it’s almost too much. Rainbows streak the otherwise pale interior, bouncing from mirror to mirror—a splash of red on the marble; green on the cross at the front of the aisle; yellow streaking across Dean’s nose.
There are churches.
"Hm?" Castiel hums, setting his mug aside and grabbing both plates of pie as he raises his eyebrows at Dean. “Apple or cherry?”
Tears come, unbidden, to his eyes and spill down his cheeks as he bangs on the door, beyond terrified, because he fears the worst. He fears that he’ll be charged for the assault of the crown prince—sentenced to prison, or worse. It will affect his family and his freedom, and he’s

“Russell. Good to see you again.” And it is. Dean has an immense amount of respect for Castiel’s personal guard, and it’s always nice to see him around.
Whoever said you can’t be sad on your birthday is an idiot.
And Castiel just

A low growl rumbles from Susie’s chest as she glares at him through the floor-length, golden-edged mirror, but Dean’s having none of it. He’s tired, starving, and he’s been worrying himself sick all day, so he doesn’t have nearly enough patience for this, or her, or anything, really.
palace guards now—look about as chagrined as they ought to, sheepish faces barely turned to the prince, who barks orders on his way back up the stairs.
With a final wave, Dean follows Susie down the hall, not a word spoken, but a thousand things left unsaid.
He’ll ask Castiel to go for a walk.
“Hmm,” she hums, leaning in, too. She places a finger on her lips, pretending to be thinking hard about it. “Oh, definitely him. The one tossing back the mimosas? That guy’s a real trophy.”
“We will
It’s a close call, and he doubles down on his efforts, forcing himself to run through everything he’s learned over the last few weeks. Every combination and trick, taught to him in off-hours and on weekends. He forces them into every move, and he thinks maybe it’s working, maybe he’s getting the upper hand, until Castiel does some next-level fancy-ass footwork and sends Dean sprawling across the grass, his sword flying from his hands, with one solid blow.
Dean looks around, frantic as he tries to find somewhere to hide, but the only option he can find is to retrace his steps to make it look like he hadn't been eavesdropping. He does so, taking about five steps back.
“That means, for the second week in a row, your favourite is Amarellino’s very own, Dean Winchester!” To Dean’s utter horror, a camera turns on him, wide-eyed, pie in his mouth, and arm in a sling. It’s the most unflattering footage they could ever capture, he’s sure, and he watches as his face darkens to a deep, cherry red onscreen.
The crew chuckles and Dean’s embarrassment cranks up a notch, his heart pounding as he settles back on the stool for the next question.
Anyway, happy Wednesday everyone!
But first, coffee. And breakfast, because he’s fucking starving.
Five minutes—ten. The line dwindles, petering off to a few stragglers here and there, until Dean is pretty much alone. Honestly, he’s feeling pretty damn smug right now, and even if the kid took his money and fucked off, just the image of Castiel covered in root beer, shocked as shit and pissed as hell, has his mood lightening.

“What's the matter, Cas?” Dean teases, feeling all light and bubbly when his prince cuts his eyes towards him before glaring back at the screen.
"Oh, Dean," Castiel sighs, leaning in to look at the screen, which is both zoomed way in and oriented upside-down. "Were you clicking at random?"
Dean shivers as the cool air rushes in, his teeth chattering as he struggles to keep his heavy eyes open.

He can’t help the anger that simmers low in his gut for the rest of breakfast, dashing his appetite and ruining his mood as he leaves the dining hall.
matter, but only because I had already pardoned you. Of course, Benny didn't know that at the time." Castiel studies Dean's face for a moment, his deep blue eyes shining by the light streaming in through Dean's windows. He reaches into the breast pocket of his suit, pulling out a monogrammed handkerchief and handing it to Dean.
And in his head, he's screaming,
It’s probably one of the last summer-warm days of the year and the crisp Amarellino breeze ruffles his hair and carries the scent of charbroiled burgers and fresh hotdogs through the air.
“He really is handsome, isn’t he?” Charlie whispers, but Dean doesn’t respond, too caught by just
It's all he can think about for the rest of his phone call, but his mom doesn't seem to notice, prattling on about Sam, and his dad, and the shitty beets in the market, while Dean debates his importance to his prince.
, Dean’s not bitter about it. He’s
Dean doesn’t bother watching the road, keeping his eyes closed. The whole experience is exhausting, and now, with the sun long gone below the horizon and the world fast asleep, Dean wishes he was too.
“How was the interview?”
“Dean, watch—”
, kind of way.
"It's getting late," Russell is saying, glancing at his watch as Castiel hands Dean a steaming mug of hot chocolate. "We should head back to the palace, Your Highness."
“I told them not to. Actually, I’m supposed to be spending time with all of you, but—” He cuts himself off, an uncharacteristic blush rising from the collar of his crisp, white button-down.
It took him a long time to get to this point, but he wears his colours with, well,
Dean nods, turning away from the blinking red light. “I never had a job before this. Well, not really—I worked, but didn’t make near enough money to consider it an actual job.” They make their way to the end of the hall, in no hurry to be anywhere. “What’s your name?”
And it just kind of breaks his heart a little bit, because he’s not special, and he’s not good. But he’ll try to be. For her, and for Castiel, and for everyone who believes in him, he’ll try.
“Damn, Winchester, try not to dazzle them so much, huh?” Charlie says, nudging Dean’s shoulder with her elbow as she laughs.
Let me know what you think!
, Father would say.
“Move,” the man beside Dean says, shoving him forward with a harsh jab. A grunt spills from his lips, along with a trickle of what tastes too much like blood to be anything else.
“You know,” she whispers, batting her lashes at him with a coy smile. “I could just show you.”
"My Guard will be accompanying us," Castiel tells the attendant, who's not really listening. His eyes are wide and astonished, mouth hanging open as he nods.
I don't think there's anything to warn for in this chapter, though I supposed there is some mild, just-for-fun violence in the form of sword fighting, but that's it.
“You—” Benny turns him around, fingers on his other shoulder this time, and searches his face and clothes. “What happened?” His voice is low and serious—scarier than Dean’s ever heard—and Dean swallows back his retort.
“Good luck with that,” Dean says, shovelling scrambled eggs into his mouth as he speaks. “You're more likely to be tackled to the ground than get your lips anywhere near Castiel's.”
concern me."
“Oh my God, Dean, I’m so sorry,” Jo whispers, her hands coming up to cover her face as she fights back a laugh. He doesn’t even see Kelly leave, but then Jo’s gone to, making a break for it and leaving him alone, covered head to toe in flour.
Castiel huffs a sigh, but doesn’t push, and for that, Dean’s grateful. He doesn’t think he can handle that conversation right now—not with every other stressor weighing him down.
“I, uh,” Dean says, startled by the comment, but he supposes he really shouldn't be. He
“What’s goin’ on?” He rubs one eye with his fist, shivering a bit when a cool breeze brushes his bare chest through the open doors.
Without thinking, Dean lets his hand drift across the space between them and wraps his fingers around Castiel's where they rest on his lap. His hands are warm, but Castiel shivers, and after a moment, he squeezes Dean's hand so tight, his joints ache.
"Thank you, I'll be just a moment." The guard nods, stepping away and speaking into his ear-piece as Castiel turns back to him with something a bit more guarded in his eyes. "Try not to get into too much mischief and I will try not to scowl so much." He rises from his chair, as does the rest of the table. "Even if it is what we both do best." Then Castiel turns to the rest of the table and, with the most regal and decidedly
“How do I…?” He waves his hands around, searching for a handle, or
“Hmm,” she hums, nodding. They reach the screening room but stop at the door before stepping inside. “You should let your prince know; I'm sure the little gossips have already gotten to him, but just to be safe.” She steps into the room, leaving him behind to try to catch his breath.
Dean shrugs. “Don’t know. ‘Cause she’ll have to hear about it? And then you will too?” Dean offers him a cheeky grin, wrinkling his nose as he tries not to feel bad about how manipulative that sounds, but if Frank really means
…” Eventually, his hips slow, then still, and Castiel turns his face to one side as Dean’s dick softens. He smiles down at his flushed face, which is already turned up to Castiel, cheek resting on his palm, smooshed and sated. “Fuck, we gotta do that again,” he says, all breathy now, and yeah, they really do.
“I didn’t calculate for the movement,” he whispers, more to himself than to Dean, but his boyfriend crosses the floor anyway, footsteps echoing on the marble, and he’s not smug, exactly—he knows how hard Castiel’s been working on this, and he would never—but more resigned. “Dean, I didn’t—”
, nearly drunk enough for a nasty hangover, and Dean has a knot in his stomach telling him they might be taking advantage of his laidback, relaxed state.
But he doesn’t.
His shoulders sag, feeling the weight of the world settle right back on them as he shoots a longing glance at his bed—the freshly washed bedding, made up and folded down for him to crawl right in—before spinning away and pulling the door open a crack.
Dean pushes the glass french doors open with a shove, feeling the chilled air hit his face. For a moment, he just stands there, soaking in the sound of the rain sinking into the dirt and the way it plinks off the steel roof of the barn in the distance.
“Dean,” Castiel says, his nasally voice far more disapproving than it should be. “You must eat.”
"No, but it means you can take it with you," Castiel offers, his lips turning up in a half-smile as he unhooks it from the cables and closes the top. "You can learn how it works and, of course, if you need any help, I'm only a call away."
With that realization smacking him in the face, panic swells inside him. He swallows hard a few times, squeezing his eyes shut as his heart races and his hands sweat. He can’t do this. This is too much—too big—and he just
It’s only on his walk back to his platform that he realizes the only person without a rose is Hannah.
. Dean’s blood pressure goes through the roof, his stomach turning as the full weight of the implications crashes down on him.
"Hey, is that—"
, Dean?” Castiel asks, turning to his fretting boyfriend, who stands off to one side, hidden in the shadows of the colossal church. He’s looking around at the domed ceilings like they’re bound to topple at any moment.
“It’s alright,” he murmurs, his eyes finding Dean’s for a fraction of a second before he looks away. It has a knot twisting in Dean’s gut though, because Castiel doesn’t look happy to see him. The opposite, actually—he looks annoyed, and more than a little jealous as he turns away without so much as a greeting.
Before Dean can even begin to contemplate the brain-mouth filter, the words, “I can help,” slip off his tongue, and embarrassment floods in the moment they leave his mouth. It dissipates as soon as Castiel beams, though, lighting up the empty library with a radiant glow. “Then… maybe we can get a drink?”
with it. However it'll be.
The halls aren't quite empty yet, but Dean knows they will be soon enough, so he holds out in his room for a few minutes before sneaking into the hall. It's not that he's all that worried about having the crown, but he's not too keen on starting up rumours, either.
the time, Winchester. “Here,” Castiel says, pulling Dean out of his thoughts. “How fast can you shower?”
It's all just so
Besides, he can just blame his red eyes and wet cheeks on the weather, and no one will be the wiser.
Panic surges inside him, forcing him from the shadows without a second thought. He goes for the back door, knowing there’s only one lock and just how to pick it.
, he thinks and pulls out the umbrella. He's sure Susie only left it here because she knows he'd go out anyway—or, expected he would—but either way, she's not wrong.
“Thank you.” Dean tucks the pass into the breast pocket of his jacket, keeping it hidden behind the handkerchief with the monogrammed
But this is their night, he can feel it.
He plops down in a chair, his hair tousled and still a little damp from his shower—there was no way he was showing up to dinner still smelling like fucking
“Do you think he’s being dismissed?” Hannah whispers, her hand covering her mouth as she leans in closer. Her eyes are wide and worried, but she still manages to set precise piles of fruit all around her plate, segregated by type and color.
Fuck it.
“Get it yourself,” Dean snaps, and he doesn’t wait for the guy to turn around, but he hears the muttered
What did he just do?
“Keep your head down, Mr. Winchester. We’re taking you into the palace.” Dean does as he’s told, keeping his chin tucked and his eyes lowered as blinding camera flashes sear his retinas. He blinks away the spots in his vision in time to see the grand, ornate front doors of the palace open to let him in, the gold and gems sparkling in the light of the fading sun as he stumbles up the steps.
Dean can’t even imagine it—the kind of stress and grief he’d feel at losing a parent and immediately having to run a kingdom—and the reason behind the strain Dean's noticed in Castiel is made all too clear. His heart aches for his prince and he seems far more human now—for less indestructible.
“As a result of the lack of coverage, seventy-eight percent of that sixty-six live with healthcare debt.” The hall is silent now, all eyes turned on him, and sure, it makes his heart race and palms sweat, but he has a
Dean stands, frozen in the doorway. He can't move—can hardly breathe. What the fuck is she
When it’s obvious Dean still doesn’t get it, Victor sighs, his head dropping back on his shoulders before he looks at Dean. “The favorite. The one we’re all rooting for. You know, the one we want the Prince to choose.” He searches Dean's eyes, but Dean’s too shocked to answer right away. “Am I getting through?”
,” Charlie says, handing the shots to Dean with a wink and a grin. “Don’t say I never do anything for you.”
“How are you and Prince Novak getting on? What do you think of him so far?” Duma crosses one leg over the other, getting settled in for the next half an hour.
Dean feels a little better after that as TV Castiel hands him a slice of pie and pulls his chair close.
When there’s no one else in front of him, and he’s standing there, facing the king and queen with no idea what to do, his blood freezes, mouth hanging open as his mind goes blank of everything but the fact that he
The words tremble out of him as his heart hammers against his ribcage—he clenches his fists as his vision starts to blur and, God, is it hot in here… why is it so fucking how? He can feel himself losing his temper bit by bit, and he needs to get a hold of it again before he says something he'll regret. All the while, Benny just stands there, waiting for him to get it all out.
“Let’s
“Oh, shut up,” Dean snaps, though the grin turning up his lips belies his annoyance. “I was plenty cool before you came along.”
“You want to bet?” Charlie raises herself up in her seat, getting at eye level with Dean as he turns to face her.
But Castiel is the Crown Prince.
His eyebrows shoot up. “Sure, I’d love some easy money.” He sets down his fork and holds up one hand, ready to tick off on his fingers. “For one, I’m like, three times your size, so if that doesn’t mean an easy win, I don’t know what does.” He ticks off the second finger. “For
“Get out of my way, boy! My other boy needs to
Any hopes he’d had at keeping in touch with anyone afterward are dashed in an instant. Even if he wasn’t getting kicked out—probably very publicly and in handcuffs—he’s sure none of them would give him a call. They haven’t even tried to
“Oh, my little sister, Hael, bought them for me. She knows how I love bees.” His shoulders jerk in the most adorable shrug, and he crosses his arms over his chest as a strand of dark hair falls into his eyes. “I should be going; there's much to do before the viewing, as you can see,” he says, gesturing to his silk pyjamas and robe, and Dean chuckles with a nod. “I just wanted to be the first to tell you, as I promised I would.”
His lunch tray sits mostly untouched beside him and his head still pounds, but now his hands shake and his vision is a little blurry when he opens his eyes.
. It’d just make things worse. They’d worry, and he’d have to explain. Or lie. And really, what’s the point of causing such a stir when there’s probably nothing—
Outside Dean’s door, Benny stands with his hands folded in front of him, waiting. When he catches sight of Castiel’s face, all the blood drains from his ruddy cheeks. “Sir, I—”
The hairs on the back of his neck prickle, standing on end, and in an instant, Dean's on high alert. He scans the long, flowing grass, his heart pounding in his chest, but there's nothing there. Just the dull grey sky where it meets the duller brown grass.
When Dean wakes on Saturday morning, it’s with the sun shining through his bedroom windows and a feeling of calm in his chest. He’s still here, which means Castiel
Chuck ignores him and continues to read. “His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Castiel, has been suffering from a cold, and the medication he was on caused a lapse in judgement, which Dean Winchester used to his advantage, as can be seen in the compromising photos—”
Two sets of arms are around his neck, squeezing tight before he fully steps into the room, but he hugs them back, not caring that every pair of eyes is now on him.
“Dorothy,” Charlie says, leaning against the doorframe with her arms crossed and a pleased grin on her face. “Figured I’d show you, too. Y’know, since we don’t have secrets.”
“What, so you’re telling me you wouldn’t just—” Dean pulls him to a stop, turning so they’re facing each other, hands holding his shirt collar. “If you think someone’s hot, and they think you are too,” Dean jerks him closer, and Castiel’s breath hitches, pleasure arching through him. God, they’re so close. Chest to chest, hips to hips— “You wouldn’t just say ‘shut up and kiss me’ and then just
And Cas… Cas kisses him like he’s a drowning man, and Dean’s made of the lightest, purest air.
“Uh, you too, thanks.” A nervous laugh bubbles up in his chest, escaping past his parted lips and echoing through the room, amplified in every corner. “Sorry, I’m, uh… I’m new at this.” See? He told Castiel he’d screw it up—he
“Sit,” Castiel says, at his side now with one hand on his back and the other pushing him onto the couch. Dean does as he’s told, dropping onto the couch with as much grace as he can muster.
“Will not—” Dean’s protest is cut off by the uneasy gurgle in his stomach, and he has to clamp a hand over his mouth to force down the three-quarters of funnel cake he scarfed down.
Castiel does his best, licking and sucking and moaning, hands digging into Dean’s lace-covered ass, but every part of him is on fire, shaking and quaking and spent, and he’s not sure if he’s giving Dean the attention he needs—
“So, little Dean, being the same resourceful, clever little shit he is today, decides to take his one-man show on the road.” He pauses for dramatic effect, and Charlie—bless her heart—gasps and holds a hand to her chest. “Sir Randal B. Fransisco and General Fiddleworth made quite the killing down in the market.”
of our one-on-one game. Would you pass me the phone?” Castiel says, holding out his hand once more for the phone.
Oh, it’s never the best time.
“Excuse me?”
"For fuck's sake, what does he want now?" Charlie grumbles as she plops down into Hannah's empty seat and slides the barely touched plate of pancakes in front of her, shovelling in bite after bite without a second thought.
Dean's heart melts, warming him to the core as something like adoration pulses through his veins. "Thank you," he whispers, and it's all he can manage to get out as he takes the phone from Castiel's outstretched hand.
He can’t believe it. He
“Yes, it is,” she says, cutting him off and giving him a small, sad smile. “It is about him—I know you better than that, Winchester.”
Dean sighs, lying back in the cushions and closing his eyes. He breathes deep, and finds that the cushions smell even more like honey and sunshine—he turns his face into a pillow, then rolls, burying himself in the comfort of his prince.
She doesn’t give up, though—gathering his laundry and arranging his outfit as he washes his own hair for the first time in a week and a half. It feels good to do something for himself, though it’s not overly distracting, and his mind wanders back to the other suitors.
Dean watches as TV Castiel takes up the flower in his hands, twirling it between gloved fingers as he looks down at the startling sapphire petals. He takes a deep breath, hesitates for a moment, then closes his eyes.
A soft chuckle falls from his lips as a hot rush of embarrassment floods him. He pushes away from Cookie and pats her neck.
"You just going to stand there?"
poisoned, like you guessed, and are now being treated accordingly."
“Either way,” Castiel says with a sigh, stepping closer so their chests press together, not an inch of space between them. “I must go. I’ve promised April a walk in the gardens.”
The Last Supper.
, actually. We learned from old books and notetaking." He shrugs, trying to ignore the way his stomach flips. He knows he's already at a disadvantage here, what with his lack of money and status, but he's sure there's more to this presentation than just something to do, so the fact that he can't even make the damn thing without help isn't promising.
He pulls them out after a few minutes and presses Dean’s knees back to where he had them—wide open, exposing every part of him for Castiel to enjoy. “Keep them here.”
They talked. For the hours after the kissing ended, it’s all they did, laughing and sharing into the wee hours, and yeah, Dean’s fucking
He lowers himself into the corner of the deep blue love-seat, somehow managing to sit closest to Lydia, while Castiel takes the seat next to him, placing himself a respectable distance away, though Dean can still feel the heat of him against his own side.
The room falls silent as the accusations ring out, and Dean’s stomach drops. He’s doing this here? Now? With all the cameras and an audience to witness her humiliation?
“Anael,” Castiel says, stepping forward to shake her hand. “It’s wonderful to see you again, and looking as lovely as ever.”
Then, the cameras are gone, and the fan-favourites broadcast is wrapped up. It all happens so fast it takes Dean a minute to realize Castiel is sitting beside him, close enough that their knees brush.
“But—”
“I kind of want to check it out. You?” Dean jumps, startled by the voice in his ear before he turns his gaze to Charlie with a smile.

"What is it?" Dean asks, tilting his head to the side as Castiel's tears slip free, leaving tracks down his cheeks which he refuses to wipe away. "What's happened that's got you so afraid?"
“Your highness,” the head-guard says, stumbling off his step as surprise and relief wash over his face, followed quickly by unease as Castiel storms down the steps in nothing but his sleep pants and satin robe, flapping where it hangs open. His hair is a wild mess, and even from here, Dean can see the pillow-creases on his cheek, and it’s fucking adorable, even with the ball-shrivelling glare he’s got going on. “You’re okay!”
Dean tries to focus on anything other than Castiel’s smooth, strong hands on his face. He closes his eyes, breathing deeply, but heat still rockets through his veins because Castiel is
Castiel says the last part only to Dean. At least, that’s how it feels since he looks only at him. There’s a pause, then Castiel looks away as he continues to speak.
“You…
“Try not to squeeze your legs so tight; she thinks you’re telling her to go.” Castiel grins up at Dean and a trickle of warmth slithers through him as he unclenches. “Just sit tight. Focus on your balance and hold onto the saddle right there. Maybe I can teach you properly some time.”
Dean looks to Castiel then, sitting in his throne, adjacent to the suitors where they sit along the wall by the double doors they entered through. He's not looking at him, but there's a hint of a smile touching his lips that suggests he wants to.
They’ll be seeing Castiel later, after all.

“Yeah,” Dean says, nodding as he watches Susie pull a
“Ma’am, we’re done—”
He stumbles to his feet, feeling his dinner rolling in his stomach, and hurries for the door before the reporter can do much more than stumble out of his way.
but completely put together.
"You're too innocent for her; too sweet and kind…” He trails off with a smile, his eyes cataloguing every inch of Dean's face. Dean sways closer, drawn to his words and the almost-touch, but he waits. "She is dark, and you…” He shrugs, something almost sad bleeding into his eyes. "You feel like sunshine."
“Your highness,” Benny pants, swallowing hard as he forces the words out. “He's gone. Dean's not in his room—Charlie, either.”
Most of the suitors clap, some cheer and shoot doe-eyed smiles at the door, and others look on serenely. Dean drops his chin.
Dean wakes up more refreshed than he's been in a week. The sun shining through his windows doesn't seer his retinas anymore, and the pounding in his head is all but gone.
The servant speaks into Castiel's ear, so soft Dean can't make out the words she tells him, before Castiel sends her away with a promise to be up shortly.
The night air is crisp and cool, almost bitter without the protection of the high fence enclosing the private oasis, but it clears Dean’s mind and snaps him out of his dazed thoughts of Castiel so close to his bed.
—manages to beg, plead, and even intimidate the club into giving up the video footage from the night before.
Dean flushes, squirming in his seat as heat ripples through him. “Yes, sir,” he mumbles, less as a joke this time and more because he doesn’t know how else to respond to a direct order when he’s not blazing mad.
“Before anyone takes their leave,” Duma says, stepping into the dining room as breakfast starts to wrap up. “I have an announcement. You will all be partaking in etiquette lessons beginning after lunch.”
Castiel takes a deep, shuddering breath before speaking, and in that time, Dean opens his eyes, determined to face this head-on—to be there for Castiel, should he need him.
The car door opens and Castiel pulls away, leaving Dean panting and breathless, shaking and overwhelmed by the whole world and everything in it.
“Yeah,
"It was hard seeing her get sent home, especially after how excited she was about her date on Wednesday. She didn't expect it at all, and I'm sure I won't either when it happens, but..."
Castiel pauses, thinking for a moment before he opens his mouth again. “
“Not important?
silent tears. His heart breaks for her and continues to break with every hitched breath and soft sniffle.
After dinner, Castiel stands and they all fall silent under his steady gaze. He meets each of their eyes in turn, never lingering too long, and Dean gets the sense that this is a practiced move. He smiles a little at the thought.
“Hello?”
Dean actually rolls his eyes, scoffing at her audacity. "You know what?" he says, throwing up his hands as he takes a step back. "I don't owe you anything. I've always thought you were alright—that maybe we could be, I don't know,
“If the viewers are wondering why Dean’s arm is in a sling,” Duma says, eyes bright in the golden glow of the grand entrance. “
confused. He could
Benny examines his shoulder as he talks, rotating it here and there, before, with a sudden, excruciating tug-twist-pop, his shoulder sets back into place.
“‘To Castiel,’” he reads, his fingers gliding over the metallic black. “‘Love, Sarah.’” He stutters the word ‘love’ but other than that, he looks pleased, and Dean leans back in his seat, arms crossed over his chest and a grin on his lips as he watches Castiel’s childlike joy in tearing the wrapping to shreds.
A subtle blush works its way into Castiel's cheeks, but to his credit, he doesn't look away, keeping steady eye-contact as he answers. "It might be," he whispers, the flush darkening as a thrill dances up Dean's spine and shock ripples through him as his eyebrows shoot up.
"Someone needs to put some curtains up," Dean grumbles instead of commenting on the fact that she brought him food. His bottom lip juts out in a pout, and he doesn't meet her gaze, throwing an arm over his eyes, instead, to block out the offending sunlight.
Except… right? Left? He doesn’t remember, but it’s a fifty-fifty shot of getting the right direction either way, right?
“There was this one time when our tutor caught him, and Castiel was so caught up in his flailing that he didn’t notice at first. Our tutor, of course, froze up—what do you say to the Crown Prince in a situation like that? Even if that prince is a tiny, six-year-old boy?”
doesn't need to add
As he waits, Dean wonders what it must be like to be a royal having to apologize to a commoner. Or, to be a royal in general, actually. It’s got to be exhausting, never knowing who to trust, and now that he thinks of it, he can almost understand why she did what she did. She doesn't know him yet—not really—and the fact that she forgets his upbringing so easily further proves that.
, and Dean is so damn bad at it it’s embarrassing. He swats at the ball almost wildly, closing his eyes and hoping he manages to even make contact—at this point, getting it over the net is a hopeless dream.

"The nickname?" Dean asks, so completely thrown off by the question that he actually manages proper question-answering protocol. Well, almost.
Castiel glances at Dean for a moment, then back to the man, who appears to be an advisor of some sort. "Just a moment, Dean. If you’ll wait here…” Then he steps away.
He doesn't nod-off now, though. His mind races with all the goodbyes he’s sure he’ll have to say at the end of the night, and he’s not even sure which one will be the hardest.
Dean jumps, a startled squeak slipping from him as his head snaps up. He finds every set of eyes in the room on him, the low glow of warm light casting shadows across the overgrown vines and tall columns.
He's undressing in a room full of strangers, for fuck's sake.
His shoulder throbs, he’s dizzy as fuck, and he’s got one hell of a blister on his ankle, so he’s in no fucking mood to deal with a lecture.

Dean snaps his mouth shut, guilt flooding him as soon as he sees the defeated exhaustion in her eyes, and the way her shoulders fall. She looks like she’s at the end of her rope, and instead of pushing the issue, Dean steps forward and wraps her in a one-armed hug.
“Damnit, Winchester! Shut up!” Benny slides around the corner, flush-faced and panting. “You’re gonna get me fired.”

“Cas, you can’t—” Dean says, low and panicked as he looks around at the hundreds of onlookers. They all see, and he’ll be tackled, or arrested, or—
"No fair," Dean pouts through panting breaths as he struggles, twisting and writhing, but Castiel's got him, well,
Sunday's are 'beauty day' as Susie calls them, which means hell on earth to anyone who doesn't like hot wax, plucking, hair and face masks, and any other torturous procedure he's forced to endure.
“Nearly,” Castiel breathes, his steps slowing, but every breath bursts from his lips in forceful pants. He drops his hands from his hair, leaving it a wild mess that he doesn’t bother fixing. “I’m sorry.” For the first time, he turns to Dean, eyes meeting, holding in the sunlit room, filled with guilt and fear. “I would completely understand if you want to leave after the insult my father dealt you. The way you have been treated here is deplorable, and entirely my fault. I should have done more—"
“And, for your information, Dean Winchester is
It’s only just before they step inside that Dean realizes the person is none other than the Crown Prince, himself.
He huffs out a harsh breath, fed up and annoyed, and doesn't bother asking her what she's doing here before reaching for the door handle as Castiel calls his name a ways back.
This has got to be him. There’s no way—
Castiel dusts the powder over Dean’s face as he answers. “I’ve been on numerous newscasts throughout my life. I’ve picked up a few things along the way.”
“It's your food; you might as well cook it. Here,” he says, showing Dean to the sink. “Wash your hands, grab an apron, and I’ll have you start the pie.” He points to the aprons hanging in the back corner. “I’m Frank, by the way. Shout if you need anything.”
At this rate, he won’t even get through the first page. He can hardly keep his eyes open as it is, and his head pounds like it’s hosting a fucking marching band. There’s no way anything he says will be coherent, and wow, is the room spinning, or—
The tension melts from Castiel's shoulders, and in an instant, that mischievous grin is back. It looks so goddamn out of place with the royal regalia draped all over him, but so natural at the same time.
bad. So, he steps into the room and makes a beeline for Castiel, who's already watching him from his chair with a tiny little smile.
Castiel huffs, shaking his head, but takes Dean’s hand and gives it a squeeze. “Dean Winchester,” he says, then grins, because this is
. But… but for Cas? Could he do it for Cas?
Dean’s breath hitches, knees wobbling. “Not how it looks from my angle,” he says, and Castiel supposes he does have a point. Instead of saying so, he takes Dean in one hand, stroking him with a firm grip while teasing the head with the tip of his tongue.

“Oh my God!”
“Ah-choo!”
“Uh…”

Benny’s expression doesn’t change, but he does straighten up a bit more as his eyes squint to slits. “Again,

"Ugh," Dean groans, throwing his head back with a dramatic flop. "Whose idea was this, anyway?"
That familiar ache settles in Dean’s chest. He’s been trying to hold it off, pushing it down, down, down with humour and snark and happy memories, but it’s always the same. As soon as he’s here, the spot where they loved each other more often than not, the pain claws its way back up his throat.
Dean’s heart stutters in his chest when he realizes there are only two spots left. He leans forward now, too, dropping Charlie’s hand and resting his chin on his fists as he waits, still shocked that he’s so high up in the first place.
tell him, or
I hope you like this one! Shit's getting real.
Dean watches Castiel like a hawk, keeping his eyes glued to his prince, who keeps his hands folded in front of him and his chin tucked in as he looks at the ground.
"Ten minutes! This is your ten-minute warning!" Mick calls from his spot on a raised platform, clipboard in hand and headset on.
“Truly, it’s fine.”
Mick’s upper lip twitches in a snarl, but he doesn’t argue. Instead, he gets off the stool and marches off around the fountain, speaking into his headset in a rushed whisper. Dean fights back a smirk, but he's sure he doesn't do as well as he'd hoped when he catches Nicholas grinning from behind the camera.
“His highness has an outing tonight,” Mick says, sounding as bored as Dean feels. “One of his charitable organizations requires an on-site visit—”
He doesn't sleep.
"Cas—"
… Could she have tried it and failed? Or
“I don’t take orders from you,” Dean grumbles, and as soon as the words leave his mouth, he knows they’re wrong. Castiel is the
“Will not.”
Dean swallows the lump in his throat, keeping his eyes glued to the screen as the silence stretches on.
She knew she was going home.
But Dean wasn’t lying, and he jumps back on dancing feet with a raised eyebrow and a pleased grin. “All in, then?”
“And—”
The cracks splinter, then shatter as tears fall from her eyes. Dean wraps an arm around her shoulders without even thinking, drawing her in and holding her close.
“Dean!”
“Jesus, the way you fear your stylist like she’s the goddamned devil, herself,” Charlie mutters, lying back and closing her eyes to the sky as if she hasn’t got a care in the world.
, of all people. “I rather like that about you, if I’m being honest.”
“May I sit?”
The stale kitchen air hangs hot and sticky, almost like a wet blanket, weighing him down. The tiny fan propped up in the corner does nothing to ease the stifling room, but the other cooks chatter away as they stir vats of soup, sweat beading on their brows.
“You’d never.”
Immediately following, Charlie's wicked grin flashes at them. "What an idiot," she says, and that's
To Dean's utter astonishment, tears shine in the prince's eyes but he blinks them away as fast as they well. The jokey tone leaves them and Dean's heart aches once more for the young prince, but when he opens his mouth to ask Castiel to stop, he's doesn't get any further than that.
, too—but there isn’t a hope in hell he’ll learn all this shit in a few hours. Frustration boils inside him, mingling with his hurt and anger. He needs to get out of here, and he kind of needs to pee.
Castiel doesn’t reciprocate right away, standing stock still with his arms at his sides, but after a moment, he raises them, sinking into the hug with a sigh as he grips the back of Dean’s jacket in tight fists.
Castiel glances over his shoulder with wide eyes, knees wobbling and mittened fingers clinging to the boards. “What is it?”
"Mr. Winchester! I'm not finished with you!" She appears like a phantom in the doorway, her torture tools held in a box between her hands, and Dean shrinks behind Benny, making sure to duck down so the top of his shower cap doesn't show.
Dean blushes. “Shut up.”
But Dean ignores the dig, and the sideways look, because Mr. Blue Eyes is looking this way, and he’s smiling that smile, and he’s looking right at Dean. Dean, who is blushing and staring and can’t look away no matter how hard he tries. Oh, God, oh no, he’s about to have a big fat crush on a fucking
Sorry to anyone trying to read my other WIP. It's hard to write and not as much fun as this one, so here's another chapter *tosses it and runs away*
"Is there a way to research on here? Add pictures and stuff?"
Sure, it has nothing to do with them, but as soon as they left to work on their tasks, he started in on his own.
"So, what
“Uh, yeah,” he says, flustered as he shakes his head, then nods. “Of course, Cas—it’s our secret.”
Dean’s back straightens, his breath stuttering from his lungs, as he watches Castiel; so regal and unapproachable, but Dean knows better, and his heart swells with pride as Castiel walks with a refined grace across the polished marble, his head held high—his face, calm and impassive.
“No, why are
"I like to believe they are," he whispers, and a far-off, dreamy look takes him over. Dean just watches, seeing both a little boy and a grown man, wishing on stars for a love he might never find. Castiel looks to Dean, then, his eyes saying something Dean could never understand. "And, you, Dean? What will you do if you don't find what you’re looking for in this place?"
“What don’t you understand about
“Huh?” Charlie’s head pops up, her cheeks filled with mashed-potatoes, before smirking. “Oh,
"Go for it," she says, no hint of hesitation and Dean smiles, emotion crawling up his throat as his love for her swells.
“I, uh… I like girls, okay? I’m just here for the extra cash since my parents are cutting me off.” Charlie pulls back, staring up at Dean with wide eyes, waiting for his reaction.
The guilt weighs heavy on his heart, though there's nothing he could've done short of going home, and anyway, how would he know?
“What the ever-loving fuck?” He’s locked in? These things
Dean examines the smooth red flesh, taking it in his hand and feeling for bruises before twisting it from the branch. He sets each apple down with care, wanting to keep them in as good a shape as he can for baking later.
He likes knowing that others see him with Castiel—he loves showing off his prince, and maybe that's shallow, but it's the truth.
Dean looks at Castiel, who is already looking at him, and a soft blush creeps up his neck and into his cheeks.
“Didn’t even have to beg!” Charlie says before Dean can open his mouth. “He’s so much cooler since we got our claws into him.”
“How’s your pie doing?”
“What?” Kelly says, her head snapping around as her relief morphs into annoyance. Wouldn’t she just
"Yeah, for the second one," Dean grumbles, bumping Castiel's shoulder with his own as his bottom lip juts out in a pout.
Dean holds his breath the entire time. He’s certain this much touching breaks all kinds of rules, but he doesn’t dare to say anything—not just because he’s pretty sure the
made by him in his hand. He's dressed in a simple black suit, still no tie, and pleased as punch to be there.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says, crossing his arms over his chest and trying to force a pout, but he doesn’t quite manage as a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth.
The rest of the suitors clap and Charlie rolls her eyes, but Dean frowns—fan-favorites?
Dean forces out a laugh and steps away, his skin crawling just a little. Did that really just happen? No, he’s probably just reading too much into it. There’s no way she’s into him, and there’s
“What do you want?” she snaps, her accent thick, and Dean looks over at her, but she’s still staring into the jewelry box.
"I will go first," Castiel tells him, so close to his ear he can almost feel the words against his skin, "and when the proceedings start, you can follow. They should be preoccupied by then. If you wish, of course."
Instead of breaking like he wants to, he buries the dread under so much bitter, sarcastic bullshit that it's nowhere to be found. He crosses his arms over his chest, forcing back the self-pity with a smirk—the terror with a chuckle.
Dean's heart leaps into his throat as nerves flood him. The crown Castiel put on his head; that's what they're talking about. Fuck, if he's found to have that crown…
Then she looks down at his crotch and
“Without further ado,” Duma says, waving a hand to Castiel, who offers her a smile and plucks up a rose between gloved fingers.
a cheater. To him, it's the worst thing you can do to someone you love, and he won't be accused of it.
what Dean was expecting to find—flirting, sure, and maybe a tiny
“To say the least!” Caesar interrupts, huffing as he takes a swig from his rye and ginger.
Dean pulls it open, flustered and disoriented, but Benny's not there. He scowls, looking up and down the hallway for his guard, but he's alone. He huffs, pulling the door closed behind him before flopping down on his bed with a little bounce.
Dean looks her way, something in her voice catching his attention. She’s got one eyebrow raised, like she knows he’s hiding something.

different button-downs to see how they'll look against his skin-tone—her words, not Dean's.

"Just a shave for now—sit still."
ringing in his ears, Dean takes his hand—warm and strong and every bit familiar. He’s held Castiel’s hand before, but it’s always new—always the best kind of magic dancing through him—and this time is no different as Castiel hauls him to his feet, lightheaded and shaky as he is.
"No—" Dean shouts, cringing away from the barrel of the gun as he wraps his arms around Castiel's head. But in an instant, Benny's gun drops as his face falls from tense panic to relief.
Breakfast Monday morning has Dean in another suit—a
He cringes the whole way through Lily's date with Castiel, though it really isn't anything special, and neither is Meg's, who had the Friday date. Castiel took Lily to the opera which, frankly, looks boring as hell, and he and Meg don't do more than go for a picnic by a lake. Dean stops paying attention when Meg won't shut her mouth long enough for Castiel to string two words together in reply.
thing? Why is everybody calling me that?”
He's so much further out than he thought.
Somehow, Dean doesn’t believe that. With the power of being a prince, how could he
"Pretty until you open that mouth," Susie murmurs under her breath as she knots his shoes and fixes his socks. No tie today—Dean's good with that. "Good thing you're so damn cute."
He doesn't say anything, not wanting to start in with her, too. She must see it on his face, though, and hear it in his silence, because she just ducks her chin with a bitter little smile, and moves to the other side of the room without another word.
It seems he doesn’t really have a choice, though, because the other person turns suddenly, like someone just called them inside and, as they move towards the doors, the light illuminates their body.
beat her. “How’s that for tired?”
So the next time someone tries to push past him, Dean snaps. “Wait your fucking turn, would you?” he shouts, startling the tweenaged boy enough that he stumbles back, almost falling on his ass, but he waits, and so does everyone else, until Castiel takes Dean’s hands and, on shaky legs, gets both feet on the ice.
With renewed resolve, he smiles. “Tell me about it,” he says, but still, a stray thought sneaks in, and once it’s there, it refuses to leave no matter how hard Dean tries to shake it off.
But then the chatter quiets down and Dean turns his eyes to the door.
Dean’s sure dessert is just as good as any other day—he’s
him,” Castiel booms, harsh, and with an edge that belies his fear. Dean’s heart trips in his chest, tumbling over itself as unease bleeds into his sleep-deprived brain.
“Just take it off,” Hannah whispers, shrugging as she cleans her plate. “Or loosen it a bit.”
can’t believe it! That lying, cheating little—
. Again. He’s the favourite
“Dean, can you just say something—”
“Come spar with us!”
Dean tugs at his lapels and steps down, doing as he's told with only a tiny pout. Today's going to be a long day, he can already feel it.
Dean picks up the pace with a little hop, keeping up with Castiel and his guards as they take a winding flight of stairs down to the next floor.
Dean does as he's told, too nervous to do anything, but he's not entirely sure what he did to piss her off. Surely no one's this prickly all the time, right? She searches through the rows and rows of hanging shirts and folded pants, muttering under her breath, and Dean can’t hear what she’s saying, but he doesn’t have time to dwell on that as she turns back around and starts to
Dean scowls at the man, not sure what to expect, really, but his first impression isn't off to a great start and, judging by the way he sneers at the gawking faces, neither is theirs.
“Good evening, Amarellino!” She smiles wide at the camera as the crowd cheers, waving their hands as the bright camera lights reflect in their eyes, showing off their rosy cheeks and happy smiles. “After two weeks of getting to know the suitors, the first of the Fan-Favourites will be calculated. As you should all know, the favorites of the next few weeks will appear on a talk show with none other than the Crown Prince, himself.”
“I’m not soft!”
“Dean?” he whispers, picking up the pace as a bonfire illuminates the way, and chanting. That’s where it’s coming from, and Castiel is running, because there is Dean, standing, trancelike, at the edge of the cliff.
“Sure are,” his dad says, rocking in his chair. “You’re making a killing on that show.”
, and when they step down into the lowered part of the club, Dean’s sees why.
His laughter drops off when her glare turns on him, mouth snapping shut with a click. “No, ma’am.”
“So, not great, then?”
The pit in Dean’s stomach grows larger, carving out his insides in the most painful way.
“You’d look homeless, that’s what.” Dean chuckles as she clips on a pair of gold cufflinks and folds a handkerchief into his breast pocket.
Dean tries to keep calm—he tries to understand her point of view and not be annoyed by the accusation—but what the actual fuck? They walked in on
“What?” Dean asks with the kind of smile that warms his belly.
“What do you mean?” Castiel looks at him with careful interest, a crease between his brows as his glassy eyes search Dean’s face.
“Come,” Castiel says, stepping from the car like nothing happened. When Dean follows, stepping into the clear, sun-shining day, what he finds is not what he expects—like,
"Why are you ignoring me?" The words tumble out before he can think them through, and he can't even say he regrets them once they're out in the open. Sure, it's like tearing his ribs open and giving Castiel a look into the deepest parts of his insecurities, but he's tired of hiding.
They can’t be more than ten here, bright-eyed and best friends. They were attached at the hip back then, never seen without the other.
“Right, his royal highness has much to do,” Anael says, her expression grave, and Castiel gives her a curt nod before turning away. Dean looks between the two of them, a little confused until Anael shoots him a wink.
Dean blinks, startled by the depth of that answer. He’d expected something more along the lines of
“Are you happy?” Castiel asks, totally out of the blue, and Dean’s not quite sure what he means by that. Right now? Sure. In general? Well…
“Anyone have a broom?” He looks around at the red-faced staff, but they just shoo him away. “Seriously, I can clean it up. You don’t need to—”
tomorrow." He cocks his head to the side, his hair falling onto his forehead as the hallway dips and spins.
“The final rose,” Duma says, and it seems far too quick. Dean’s heart stutters and he finds himself almost frantic because he wants more
The lights are dimmed and dulled for the night, long shadows stretching longer hallways, and silence echoing with its own kind of sound. It’s a little creepy, if he’s being honest, but he moves with quiet steps, his bare feet hushed on the marble floor, and his satin sleep pants swishing softly against his prickly legs.
“Kind of cocky, aren’t you?”
Castiel chuckles and brushes past him, and to Dean’s humiliation, he realizes Castiel knows exactly what he does to him—shit, is he really that obvious?
"What is the absolute worst thing that could happen right now?" Castiel asks, like it's in any way helpful. Dean scowls at him, but doesn't answer. "I'm serious, Dean. The worst thing. Indulge me."
Castiel buckles, gasping for breath as Dean steps forward, a shout on his lips as the guards do the same.
He slows to a stroll in the next hallway. This one’s darker, with deep blue curtains drawn over high windows, blocking out the sunlight that peeks through the edges. Dean runs his fingers over the wallpaper, feeling the smooth finish before gliding his hands over the decorative tables set at intervals along the hall.
“Hell-ooo,” Aaron says, giving Dean the once over, and it should make him uncomfortable—it would any other day—but this is Pride Day Dean, baby, and he’s feeling all kinds of good right now. He shoots the man a wink and disappears into the bathroom.
“This is it,” Dean whispers to himself, bouncing on the balls of his feet as he shakes out his hands at his sides. He’s already sweating through his suit, and the restrictive waistcoat isn’t helping him calm down in the least.
"I want you to know that we are taking your suggestions seriously and that this, as Duma said, is not just a way to pass the time." He opens his mouth, then closes it again, looking like he has more that he wants to say, but thinks better of it before nodding at his wife to say her piece.
"Alright," Castiel says, far quieter now—more intimate than instructing—as he leans closer. "I suppose I'm finished here, then." He shifts in his seat, looking like he's not finished at all—like there's so much more he wants to say and do—and Dean wants all of it, and he wants it
The dirt sinks between his toes, cold and wet from the morning drizzle, but when he tips his head back to the sky, there are only a few fluffy, white clouds softening the deep blue sky.
"Uh, good." Mick points to Nicholas, and a second later, the red light blinks on the front of the camera—he's being recorded.
“Oh, Hannah,” Castiel calls after Sarah and Charlie are gone and Dean’s just finishing up with the chairs.
Susie grumbles in his ear about smudged makeup as she touches it up, but Dean doesn’t have it in him to apologize. He had a great time with Castiel, and it’s all he can think about now that he’s back in the lineup with the other suitors.
, Dean thinks, then gets the horrible feeling that that's what he looks like when he looks at his prince.
But it’s April who won’t leave him alone. She keeps ducking down beside his head, whispering in his ear, and every time, he shakes his head
“What’s up?” Dean asks, sitting up and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. He’s still a bit groggy, and his voice is more sleep-roughened than he’d like, but now he’s curious about those folders.
Dean’s heart sinks, his back going ram-rod straight as ice trickles down his spine.
Dean lets his head fall back on a groan, his neck aching from sharing a bed with a couple of pillow-hogs the night before, and really, he just kind of feels like shit all around.
He hears his TV self say “I'm going to my room,” before pushing past Benny, and it's so childish looking back on it, that Dean tosses his head back and laughs at the dramatics of it all.
Dean rolls his eyes, but he doesn't even have it in him to be offended. He just throws up his middle finger in the soldier's direction, all with a grin on his face.
“Alert the guards on patrol, inside the palace and in the grounds. He can’t have gotten far on his own, and if—” Castiel cuts himself off, looking over his shoulder at the other suitors as panic spikes in his tone.
threatening, and like he’s not alone. Like he’s not safe in this room, and there’s someone watching him, and like there’s not a person in the world he can turn to to make this okay.
Dean cuts himself off with a frustrated growl. The hall is silent now, every ear tuned to his rant, but he doesn’t
"You as well," Castiel responds, but he's buried in paperwork once more, and barely notices when Dean slips out of the room.
“Dean, I—” Castiel cuts himself off, his eyes catching on the cut marring Dean’s cheek. “You’re hurt,” he says, stating the obvious, but Dean doesn’t do anything more than blink.
Kelly looks at her cards, then the flop, before glances at Castiel through her lashes. “I’ll raise it to five,” she tells them, silky smooth voice accompanied by a sultry smile.
It’s not long before Dean finds himself waiting in a crowd of hundreds of eligible suitors, and for the first time, he starts to worry that he’s not good enough, smart enough, nice enough,
That’s how they proceed for the next half hour; going through the daily schedule while Castiel makes suggestions, and Dean listens in to the strategic genius that is his prince’s mind. He asks questions that hadn’t even crossed Dean’s mind to ask, and makes comments on the little details that undoubtedly would’ve made his own childhood easier.
, Hannah!” Dean holds the hand not trapped by his sling over his heart, feeling it stutter behind his rib cage. “What the hell?”
“Getting tired, Winchester?” Charlie taunts, her fiery hair escaping the loose knot at the back of her head.
A gloved finger tucks itself under Dean's chin, nudging it up with the lightest pressure, and when he meets Castiel's eyes, there's a reassuring smile on his closed lips that's got Dean's heart calming.
Castiel lets out a weary sigh as he leans back, looking so damn tired that Dean almost feels sorry for him. "I know. Don't worry, I was as upset as you were, which is why I had Benny come to you. I know you two get along."
. “No, we can finish filling your basket; the others are warm and happy for now.” Castiel lifts a gloved hand like he’s about to touch Dean’s cheek, but drops it almost immediately with a sigh. “I hope you don’t mind if I help? I didn’t get the chance to fill my own, and Braeburns are my favorite of the fall harvest.”
look like a leprechaun, Mr. Winchester.” Susie turns to the crew member. “Does Mr. Winchester look like a leprechaun to you?”
“Hey, Suse,” Dean says when she’s halfway through fixing his hair for the ceremony.
Dean swallows hard, forcing back his fear. “You,” he says, so soft and hesitant he’s not sure Castiel can hear him. “I… I have a crush on you. Have since freshman year.” He shrugs, a nervous grin lifting one side of his mouth. God, he hopes he doesn’t look like he’s making light of the whole thing. Because, fuck, this is… it.
“Disgusting devil spawn,” Charlie mutters under her breath, and Dean almost chokes. He has to bring a hand to his mouth to keep the half-chewed egg from shooting across the table as he laughs, and Hannah pats his back until he gets himself under control.
Charlie groans beside him, and April huffs from across the table, already annoyed by Castiel’s absence and making sure
“Sure it is.”
Because the river was Dean’s idea, and the picture, his too. Guilt, as he’s felt every second of every day since, eats him away from the inside out. Castiel is
Dean glances up at the sound of pounding hooves and finds Hannah riding off, her flowing blue dress flapping in the breeze.
“I told you—”

“Please,” he says, cutting Dean off with a pained look. “Please, let us not.”
Dean rolls his eyes but does as he's told. “Still too early,” he mutters, shivering a little. A morning person he is not, but after Susie heard about the charges, she insisted that he looks his best—his most
of them fall victim is more important than his own safety.
“Cas.”
Dean's heart pounds behind his ribcage, his lungs emptied of air as the cameraman rounds the corner, finding Castiel wide-eyed and startled, still in the suit he wore that day, as Benny tries to catch his breath.
in the new style, so what’s to say he won’t, too?
How...? How could he possibly feel like that for
A few hours and more than a few drinks later, Dean finds himself sinking into his barstool as his friends holler at a group of men, arms waving, boobs flashing, smiles as charming as they ever get.
Castiel's eyes stay closed, though, and Dean can't help but watch him. Their hands stay tangled between them, but otherwise, they don't touch. It's such a change from moments before that it's almost jarring, and Dean hates it. He wants to touch every part of Castiel any time he wants. He wants this to be over, once and for all. He wants Castiel all to himself and he wants it now.
“Hmm… poker, perhaps?” He lifts an eyebrow, a single curl of dark hair falling over his forehead, and he just looks so goddamn good, Dean can hardly think straight.
, would be weird, and
“Will too.”
“In deference to—”
He stops, cutting himself off with a deep, burning flush and a knot in his stomach. Fuck, why the hell would he think telling
“Yeah, yeah,” he says, handing Castiel a fresh tissue. “You can punish me when you’re able to stand without getting light-headed.”
He ties the strings, doing them up in a little bow before tucking the ends in his pants. A pleased little smile tilts his lips when he catches sight of himself in all black. He looks good—damn good—and the confidence ringing inside him tells him there’s no way Castiel won’t think so too.
“This may be a little late,” Dean says, popping off and ducking his head to get at Castiel’s balls. “But you’re clean, right?”
And, sure enough, they're only in line for a couple of seconds before Russell is at Castiel's side, whispering in low tones. Well, if nothing else, at least Russell knows enough to recognize the possibility of danger. Another score for him, Dean supposes.
"Did you…" he pauses, clearing his throat as he examines the perfectly browned crust and gooey filling. "Do you even want to do this? To get married now, I mean. Do you want it?"
"It was unprofessional, uncivilized, and extremely rude of me, and for that, I apologize." Dean nods, caught off guard like a deer in the headlights as he waits for the
Megs rolls her eyes, “Whatever,” she says and turns back to her food.
"The amphitheatre," Castiel says after a while, and Dean almost doesn't catch what he means, too distracted by the sharpness of his prince's cheekbones and the way his dark eyelashes curl at the ends, but he just barely remembers that he asked him a question.
“Oh,” Charlie says, dropping the annoyance, and crosses her arms over her chest. “Huh, thought I did.” Then she bobs one shoulder in a half-shrug. “The soldiers are waiting with the car; you need to get dressed.”
“Frank!” Dean booms, holding his hands out to his sides with a wide grin when the head chef steps through the door with the most beautiful cake Dean’s ever seen rolling along on a cart in front of him. “You’re my hero—I mean that.”
She doesn't take the bait though, her ruby-red lips curling at the corners as she flicks her hair over her shoulder. “As if your business is relevant enough to hold my attention. Actually, I won't be surprised when you find yourself dead-last in the fan-favourite selection after that little stunt you pulled.” She shrugs, satisfied with her dig, but before Dean can snark back, Charlie steps in to save him, tailed by Hannah.
He pushes his peas around, hating them more tonight than he normally does, but even with his rumbling stomach, he can’t swallow back a single bite. He tries, of course, but it turns to ash on his tongue, and he finds himself tucking it into his napkin in the most discreet way he can.
“You won’t be able to cheat anymore with the others here, at least,” Dean says, trying to play off his disappointment as they wait for the others to show.
When she's gone, he looks down at her plate of barely-touched pancakes, but he's not feeling it anymore. He hates to see them go to waste, especially since she only took a couple of bites, but… there really isn't anything he can do.
. He has the ridiculous Reedy Pies pizza hat sitting crooked on his head, pizza sauce, or—God, forbid—blood, smeared on his cheek, all over the red and white polo shirt, and cheese in his hair. “Had a horrible night, and I was two minutes late and he threw his pizza at me and now I’m an
Kelly hasn’t said a word, and Dean’s only just realizing his mistake.
“What’s this?” he asks, taking what looks like a tabloid magazine from her hands. Its glossy pages reflect the natural light—it’s brand new; probably today’s—and Dean’s stomach clenches at what she could possibly be showing him.
“Do you have more balloons, Charlie?” Dean calls across the relatively large sitting room Benny was able to get for the party as she strings them up and ties them to a tiny stone to keep them from floating to the ceilings—wouldn’t that just be a disaster.
The boat is stable, at least, and Dean settles into the cushioned seat beside Castiel, hands tangled together with a warmth in his heart he's never felt before.
of metal on priceless china before answering. "Yes," he says, and there's not a hint of hesitation in his voice. "It was my idea, after all."
Who the hell decided they'd all be dressed in the same shade of blue? Sure, it's Amarellino blue but, God is it depressing.
“Then grab one and start tearing, Cas.”
“Is she talking to me or you?” Dean murmurs, glancing over at Castiel, who heaves a heavy sigh and purses his lips before he answers.
He might be mistaken, but he would swear that in that moment, Castiel lets out a breath—like all his worldly troubles have just been solved—and Dean can’t help the bitter resentment curdling inside him.
Dean doesn’t respond as Castiel makes his way down his throat, kissing and licking and sucking bruises into his skin. His fingers dig into the blankets, eyes wide, lips parted as Castiel follows the trail of his lips with his hands. Dean shivers under his touch, a soft, breathy moan falling from his lips.
“Oh, my apologies,” Castiel says and takes a step back, but he stops, his eyes narrowing in concern as he tilts his head to the side, his hand still clutching the door handle. “Is everything alright?”
Dean doesn’t move, standing by his bed, half-turned toward her with a couple of fingers hovering over the slices of bacon he won’t be taking anymore.
Dean chokes on cherry and syrup, slapping a hand over his mouth before it spews all over the table. "Really?" Had they mentioned that before? He can't remember, but even so, it's news to him. Castiel only nods, watching his fork as he cuts his pie up in equal, bite-sized pieces. "Why?"
"Sorry!" she gasps, her dress unravelling from its knot to fall back to her ankles, the bottom hem stained with mud. "Whoever thought… dresses were a… good idea… is
whenever I want; I get one call, and this is it."
weird, then, but Dean decides not to read too much into it. He doesn't think his nickname for the prince is that interesting, but he could be wrong.
“Come visit, would you? If you can?” Dean pulls away just a little, looking into her tearstained face. One of his best friends in the whole world is leaving—how is he supposed to be okay with this?
"This is all of them?" Dean says after a while, holding up the stack and looking to Duma for an answer. He's all but forgotten the camera, though he does take note of the little red light that tells him they're still rolling.
that he'd find her before dinner, and even then, he doubts it warrants that level of anger.
With numb legs and an aching butt, Dean knows he’ll have to get up soon to stretch, but not yet. For now, he just people-watches, wondering how much better they’d do in an interview.
“Hold on a sec, Kelly. I forgot an apron—”
"Stubborn," she snaps, scowling so hard her eyebrows practically meet in the middle, and Dean can't help the bark of laughter that bursts from his lips. Susie jumps and turns her scowl on him. "What? He
He moves both hands to Dean’s ass, kneading and gripping the supple flesh, and closes his eyes as he tugs him closer, swallowing his cock until his nose meets Dean’s balls.
Dean heaves a heavy sigh, still feeling the weight of unease in his chest, but Charlie’s right—there’s nothing he can do—so he follows behind her, determined to make the most of his time here, and the best of his time with Castiel, no matter how little of it he might have left.

"Oh, how the camera
Castiel blinks, his face pinching up in confusion, because after all these years, there’s no reason Castiel can possibly think of as to why Dean would be nervous to go on a walk with him. “I don’t understand,” he says, and then Dean makes it perfectly clear.
“Hi,” Hael Novak murmurs, looking down at Dean with big, too-blue eyes, her hair done up in a half pony-tail, tied with a purple bow to match her dress.
A guy’s guy, who goes out for drinks with the boys, and laughs with ease, and can stare at another man for a solid eight, nine,
Truthfully, he’s been so caught up in obsessing over April’s claims of kissing Castiel, wondering and worrying that they’re true, that the only way he’s able to choke anything down at all, is by stuffing his face as fast as he can.
Dean yawns, rubbing at his tired eyes as he takes sleepy, stumbling steps along the deserted halls.
and heads for his closet.
Castiel doesn’t follow, stuck to the pavement as a fresh tide of
Dean spins back around, eyes locking on Castiel’s, and as Dean says the words, “It pays for itself,” Castiel mouths them right back. “The outcome of a universal healthcare system is a strong, healthy kingdom, with a working lower, middle, and upper class, and a dwindling homelessness crisis that I believe can, and

“Good. Breakfast is being served on the back lawn this morning.” Dean looks up at that, shocked that the Prince would do something so informal. “It’s a beautiful morning so you’ll spend quite a bit of the day outside. Lunch will be served there as well, and it’s very important for you to take this time to try to talk to the Prince as often as possible.”
“I guess so.” Dean’s heart melts as Castiel continues, telling stories of growing up in the most extravagant and renowned place on earth.
“You edit this thing—”
.” A laugh bubbles out of her as she shakes her head.
Castiel's eyebrows jump, and Dean watches with his heart in his throat as they back down with just that
When Dean feels secure in his seat and far enough from that feeling of eyes all over him, he chances a glance over his shoulder, and in the middle of the tall, swaying grass, against the slate grey sky, stands a dark figure.
, the old chevy pickup roars to life, and they’re off. Tires spinning, soft dirt kicking up under the tires, and Castiel grinning that wild, maniac smile Dean loves so much.
Dean tears it down in a flurry, crumpling the letter before tossing it under his bed with his heart in his throat.
purpose. “You know, for trusting me with all this.”
,” Dean says, mostly to himself by the looks of it, but Castiel still glances up over the rim of his reading glasses. “Do you hear me?
“No, he didn’t,” she says, unfolding herself from the wall to take the phone from his hands. She’s all crisp edges and a tight bun, dark eyes watching him with the kind of critical gaze that only comes with a job like hers. She is the picture of restraint, as all good guards should be. “You were cut off.”
“What? No!” He shakes his head, flushing bright red as he waves them off. “No, nothing like that! We

He doesn't dare to glance in Castiel's direction, even though he

“Ain’t that a relief.” Sarcasm drips from his every word as Dean takes a detour, pulling open one of the front doors with a grunt. “Where the fuck are you going?”
“Mr. Winchester,” the voice rumbles, and it’s not the shrill tone Susie always has with his impoliteness. It catches his attention and he scowls into his pillow before flipping onto his back. The doorknob rattles, then opens, and Dean throws an arm over his eyes.
Cookie gives a little jolt forward, and Dean’s heart leaps, but Castiel holds her back with a laugh.
“Cas, how do I…” Dean shifts around on the saddle, trying to slide one way before deciding against it and going back the other way. He looks over at Castiel, who has the tiniest grin on his face as he shakes his head. He steps closer.
So far, Dean thinks he’s doing pretty damn good.
“You think Mr. Prissy-Prince would come out with us if we asked?” Charlie says, leaning into Dean’s side as she sips at the neon orange shot. Dean scowls at the name, but she’s not talking to him and, besides, her eyes sparkle like she said it just for Dean’s reaction.
you, Dean.
“Hmm, Gabriel thinks he’s funny.” He shakes his head, but there’s a fond smile on his lips, showing the love he has for his baby brother. Dean knows the feeling. “Did you know they call me Captain Cassie? Samandriel told them that’s what C.P. stands for.”
Castiel laughs, startling Dean so bad he jumps before shooting a dirty look over his shoulder at the smiling prince.
“Matt, come on!” He shakes her off, then—
With his foot still throbbing, Dean stops in the middle of the room, pushing up on his tippy-toes and craning his neck, searching for Sam’s shaggy head of hair.
Hannah opens her mouth to answer, but before anything comes out of her mouth, Dean turns back around to face Castiel, who sits across from him, minding his own business and eating his breakfast with practiced decorum.
It’s stupid, and dramatic, and not even all that true, but the more he thinks about it, the faster he runs, and the hotter his blood boils until he’s sprinting down a hill, and—
“Look at us!” Charlie shouts when she gets to Dean’s side with Hannah in tow. “Another week, another rose.” She twirls it between two fingers, examining the perfect petals and long, green stem. “Dorothy will love this one.”
So, he ducks his head, grabs the strings in each hand, and
Castiel arches an eyebrow and does the same, though far more delicately. “And then?”
Dean jerks away—what the fuck is she
Cookie lets out a huff. Then another. Another, and she's dancing, ears flat on her head as she looks around, frantic, almost.
. God, they shine like their lit with a billion stars.
Dean spends most of breakfast chatting with Charlie, talking about their families, and where they’re from—they even make plans to convince the guards to let them go horseback riding at some point before either of them is sent home.
Dean pushes himself up from the floor, his arms shaking and his head spinning, but he ignores that—and the smear of cherry pie, too—as he lunges for the door. His fingers scramble over the handle, but it refuses to turn, and he resorts to yanking on it. Panic swells inside him until he can’t even manage steady breaths—they aren’t going to believe him, but he didn’t

Dean's thoughts go to his family in an instant, but Castiel seems to read it on his face before he can voice his fears. "At this time, there is no indication that anyone's families are in danger. At
. Closer—Dean is certain—than would be considered acceptable, but he doesn’t dare to move away. He doesn’t think he can even if he wanted to.
“If you want—”
Still, Dean stops, pulling his phone from his ass-hugging jeans for one last check. He hasn’t heard from Cas all afternoon—not since he called asking about an outfit—and some part of him worries his best friend might not show up at all. The thought sinks like a stone in his stomach, because he’s finding that, even though he knows it’d be good for Castiel to join the community, it’s also good for
“I’m not moping.” He is—he’s never moped so hard in his life, and he knows it—but he tries to smile anyway, just to prove his point.
“Boy!”
“Uh, yes. I’ll have whatever is being served for lunch.” Dean says, then adds, “Please,” because his momma raised him with manners and he feels guilty for yelling at the man.
For a moment, they just watch each other, and Dean doesn’t laugh this time. He wants to, but he doesn’t. “Come on,” he says instead, clapping his hands in front of him. “Get up and keep going.”
and it’s
“No!” Shit, fuck,
"There weren't
“To what?” Castiel murmurs, the bright, late afternoon sun highlighting his hair and turning it a soft brunette. He smiles at her, indulgent in the way he looks at her, and she must take that as an invitation to step closer.
The commotion gets louder the closer they get to the cluster of people at the end of the hall.
“What if he sics the dogs on us?” Another pumpkin, wobbling against the others, bright orange and fucking perfect. Just the thought has his heart leaping, hands shaking, because shit,
Susie works quickly, though, and she seems utterly unconcerned with his nudity as she bends to hold a pair of clean, perfectly white underwear at his feet, telling him to, “Step in!”
“They will wait,” he says, but there’s a strain in his voice as he waves the servant away and Dean can tell his time with his prince is limited. “Tell them I will find them later.”
“Hey, you spilled my fucking drink, asshole!”
," he hisses, flinching away, but Susie drags him back into place.
as Susie calls it—Dean stops her, making sure to look her in the eyes as he speaks, his smile bright and genuine. “Thank you.”
When the door swings open, Dean looks down at his mother, her blonde hair pulled up in a messy bun, and throws his arms around her without a moment’s hesitation. “Hey, Mom,” he says, holding her so tight, the words are nothing more than a muffle whisper, but God, did he miss her.
With a groan-shout that rivals the dramatics of even April, Dean rolls out of bed, stumbling to his feet in nothing but a pair of sleep pants. "I hate you for this.” Dean shoots her a blistering glare. "You know that, right?"
tells Dean he’s not going to like what Castiel has to say.
meant the last time they played, and how he walked out of here with a swollen, black and blue eye. “Sure you will,” he mutters but strips out of his suit jacket anyway as he makes his way to the door. “Just know that if you give me another black eye, I’m telling everyone you punched me.”
No, he… no.
“Are you ready?” Castiel asks, taking his hand like it’s the most natural thing.
“So, you know Meg? Apparently, she’s on the run. Something about a crime in her old country, but if she marries into royalty, all suspicion has to be dropped.” Jo leans back, her cat-caught-the-canary grin widening as Kelly gasps.
Dean crosses the room in nothing but his briefs, a chill working its way down his spine as the low, golden light illuminates his rows and rows of crisp suits. Fuck, he’s never owned so many clothes before—not in all his years combined—but even still, he doesn’t have a damn thing to wear.
Castiel eyes him with possibly the best poker face in the circle, but Dean refuses to look over. He knows he’s crack like a raw egg under an elephant’s toes the moment he does. Still, his heart races as he holds his cards close to his chest.
He could faint just thinking about it.
“Eighty-two percent of homelessness is caused by healthcare debt, costing the kingdom billions each year in shelters, soup kitchens, and aid. On top of that, thirty-nine percent of illnesses result in death because of a lack of treatment. These are
