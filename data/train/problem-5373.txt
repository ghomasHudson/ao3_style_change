“Dean? Is this not the first time you’ve done that?” Dean put his hands in his pockets and look at the floor.
Sam mumbled into his pillow as he rolled out of bed, and made his way to the bathroom.
“When, uh. When a seraph accepts his or her grace it doesn’t affect their personality or values in any way.” Cas noticed how Sam tried to restrain his grimace when he said the word seraph. It turns out Dean isn’t the only one having a hard time with this. Cas turned to face Sam before he continued. “I know this is hard for you both, but Dean is going to have a harder time accepting himself once all this is said and done. He’s still gonna be the same old Dean, remember he’s always been a separate species all his life you just didn’t know it until now.” Sam closed his eyes and took a deep slow breath as Cas finished his last sentence. “Sam, you’ve been brothers all your life, and no matter what you will always be brothers.” Sam bowed his head and let out a breathy laugh as his water line burned with tears.
"Dean this isn't a joke, we-"
"Sam you don't need to be worried, there's nothing to worry about because I'm fine."
"Dean whatever caused Ashley to kill herself is now happening to you." Sam’s worry, stress, and anger buzzed violently in the base of his skull and spread through his head to his temples.
“Hold on,” Sam said putting a hand up to stop Cas from speaking. “If there’s no case then what the hell is happening to Dean?”  Cas simply cocked his head at Sam and stated.
"Good morning your highness, time to get your ass out of bed."
“Dean? Dean!” Sam yelled to get his attention.
“Heya, Cas?” Sam questioned with a smug look on his face. “What ‘cha do-“.
"Yeah, I guess we'll see. Take off your shirt."
“Dean?” Sam said cautiously, almost dangerous.
“Sam the grace Dean has absorbed already can be used almost like a compass that we can use to get to the crypt.” Sam thickly swallowed and watched Dean sleep for a few seconds before answering.
He finished his shower and stopped at the door. He was disgusted he had to use this.
"Yeah check these out," Dean said not looking away from the photos strung up across the east wall. Sam walked over to see beautiful pictures of desert plants and wildlife. They were exquisite, long shots were taking the entire landscape of the desert at both day and night, small snakes and lizards perched on top of rocks, impressive clusters of barrel cacti, and a few of a Swaro cactus about eight feet tall. The most impressive pictures by far were the ones taken in the desert at sunrise and set. Beautiful rays of warm and cool colors gently filling the neon pink sky above the dry cracked clay landscape. They both stood there taking in the pictures. Dean with his arm awkwardly under his suit jacket picking at his back. Sam spoke after a minute of admiring the gorgeous photos.
“So you can see them?”
He was tossing and turning for a good hour after he had gotten into bed. The buzzing settled after Sam fell asleep, to the point where he could barely feel it. Which allowed him to really feel the other force from the first time.  This time it was stronger, pulling and nagging at him to come and find it. He pulled his pillow over his face and growled into it. He flipped over onto his stomach and pressed his face into the lumpy mattress.
“Yeah, whatever,” Dean said putting Baby into gear.
Dean sat on the edge of the cheap motel bed, finishing off what was left of a BLT. Sam had found some vengeful spirit or poltergeist case he wasn't really listening. Not that he could his ears were ringing, not painfully, they were just ringing. It was probably from him blasting music from Oregon all the way to Nevada. Yeah, that's definitely what it was.
"A hunter getting himself killed? Shocking!"
“I am sorry Dean. I wish I could have given you more warning or time, the both of you. To be completely honest part of me is just as scared as the two of you. The only information I had that you two did not was the fact that a Seraph existed and what it was. I am, as you say, ‘making this up as I go’, but I will make sure to the best of my ability that I make these events occur and painlessly as possible,” Cas shared.
“Dean.” That was all Cas could say. He quickly closed the space between him and the human- no, the seraph. He sat next to him on the bed and wrapped his arms around the shaking man next to him.
Dean sat in the middle of the empty booth with his hands folded in his lap making him look small and tired. Dean just sat there fidgeting and shifting, looking at Sam and Cas with wide anxious eyes.
Dean threw done the pencil and ran his hands through his hair as he leaned back in his chair.
Sam had dropped Dean back off at the motel. He didn't put up as much of a fight as he thought he would but he's was glad he had the sense not to come. Sam pulled out the Led Zeppelin cassette and tossed it in the glove compartment. He flicked through a few local channels and then settled on a country/ rock station. He smiled at thinking if the look Dean would give him for listening to it. He was still worried about Dean, and Dean not exactly caring for himself (even when he is healthy) didn't exactly ease his mind much.
"Yeah, that would be too easy, ghost than?"
‘I completely fucking broke down in front of Cas last night.’
"Yeah, we literally have no clue what's going on here."
“Wait Cas, I’m sorry. Are you telling us Dean was born a seraph?” Sam said barely able to wrap his mind around the fact that, Dean his older brother, the man who had hunted supernatural creatures with him had been a supernatural creature all along. Cas glanced at Dean before turning back to Sam and answering.
“Which is?” Dean asked with his eyes still closed. He and Cas exchanged wary looks and Cas spoke again.
Dean slowly woke the next morning. He rolled over and extended his arm, only to have it fall onto nothing.
"You can head on back docs waitin' for ya."
Dean rolled out of bed and walked over to the counter. He found he wasn’t tired what-so-ever. He rolled his shoulders and cracked his neck, trying to work out some of the discomfort. He could feel Sam’s eye on him as he did the movements. Dean poured himself a cup of coffee out of instinct, despite not needing it.
"If it's a tulpa wouldn't we have already heard so town legend or something?"
Dean dropped himself into the diver’s side of the impala and sighed. Two hours in that sleazy bar and came up with absolute jack and a little squat. He wondered if Sam was still asleep. He focused in on Sam, he rolled his eyes up into his skull and leaned his head back as far as it could go. The fog and shifted from fog back to buzzing avian, and he felt Sam curled up under the covers with the laptop in front of him. Dean snapped himself back to his own consciousness and reached in his pocket for the keys. He stopped just before putting the keys in the ignition.
"What the address?"
"Sammy, stop." Dean simply whispered weakly. He didn't want Sam to know, he just wanted to gank this bitch and wait for it all this to be over.
"Dean I told you not to touch it!"
Dean stared at Sam equally bored and confused.
“We done?” Dean asked after a brief moment of silence
It didn't feel like this was something Sam did to him, but the “energy” felt like Sam.
"It's a shame she's dead, her work is amazing"
Shit, Sam.
"Sam listen, no one died bloody in this town. How can I have ghost sickness with no ghost?"
As soon as Dean felt the warning he found himself staring down the barrel of Sam’s gun.
"Hey, Sam everything okay down there?"
The mood in their red plasticly booth was awkward and fragile. He and Cas sat next to each other across from Dean, who looked cold and a bit frightened sitting alone in his own booth. Dean put his hand on the back of his neck and rolled his shoulders a couple of times. He noticed from the look on Dean’s face that they were bothering him.
“Dean, you see something?” Sam said putting his hand on his gun as he realized Dean had stopped walking and started searching.
“Is that- that’s not possible,” Dean said completely dumbfounded.
"Just get me yogurt or mixed fruit or something."
“Alright so, spill,” Dean said, ignoring the slight tremor in his voice.
"Give me that," Sam said snatching the gadget away from him.
“If I’m supposed to be undetectable, how did you know I was a, ya’ know?”
"Was this why you didn't want me to call him?"
"I'm heading to the diner for some breakfast. What do you want"
“Cas, something is wrong with Dean. Apparently, you can see why we called you.” Sam spoke up after what few seconds felt like hours. Cas furrowed his brow and glanced in between each of the brothers.
"Okay, I'm going back to bed don't kill yourself in there."
Cas nodded offering a grimace of a smile.
They found Cas waiting for them outside of the room number he sent them. Dean warily approaches Cas, trying his best to act natural. Cas stood and from where he was leaning on the door and greeted them with a nod.
“Uh, no.”
"Sam this better be of urgent ma-" His eyes widened when he turned and saw Dean
“How?” Sam asked eyeing Dean waiting for answers. “How is this possible? What did you do?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Alright so, how are we going to do this exactly?” Sam piped up.
Sam and Dean walking around Ashley's house. That's- that's it.
“Honestly, Cas, I have no clue,” Dean said through a weak smile.
"That's what it looks like, she has half a package of water in here with about a gallon of gas," Sam said looking into the backseat window, using his hand to shield the sun from his eyes.
"Okay, good. I just want to be sure." Dean felt worry through the vibrations in his skull. Sam was such a mother hen.
Sam nodded and looked to the floor chewing his lower lip.
"I completely agree Dean, but there's nothing the town is only 60 years old, and I've found jack."
Dean woke up to the smell of coffee and the sound of Sam typing away on the computer. He was too busy furiously researching to notice Dean was awake until Dean got up and started moving around.
“Cas . . . “ Cas turned to look at Sam his eyes were pink and swollen around his glassy irises. He took a few moments to look over Dean’s sleeping form before turned his eyes back to Cas. “Is he gonna come out of this still. . .” He swallowed thickly. “Ya know, Dean?” Cas glanced at Dean before pulling the sheet up to his chin and then pulling a chair next to Sam. He began to speak but still didn’t keep his eyes off Dean.
“You managed to pull a small piece of your grace from the atmosphere, so that should mean Micheal’s crypt is in a hundred-mile radius.”
“One of Michael’s crypts must be nearby, that is where the entirety of his grace is stored.”
“Isn’t it so endearing though?” Sam asking mockingly.
Dean stopped.
"Mind off what?"
"What was she doing in the Mojave Desert?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He still did a once-over of the building’s perimeter and parking lot.
He slowly pulled himself back into his body sitting up as he did so. He ran a hand through his hair and checked himself in the rearview mirror before going in. He would never admit it out loud, but every time he did whatever he just did his senses got a little better. And he will never admit that he almost didn't want to get rid of this ability, no matter what was causing it.
“Okay so, is that all you needed to tell me,” Dean asked snapping him and Cas from their thoughts.
He cried out in frustration and kicked the melted tire of the carbecued Volkswagen. As soon as he struck the tire he felt the buzzing send out a large pulse of energy. Large enough that Dean felt it physically leave his body along with some of the anger. There was a split second of silence before whatever wave he just sent out must have struck some panes of glass that were piled against the wall a few feet away from him and shattered it into trillions of small sparkling fragments. The lot unfortunately was not that large. When the glass shattered, it shattered all over Dean and his surroundings. He felt each speck of glass scrap across his face and split each cell from one another. It wasn't any more or less painful, it felt he had a bucket of broken glass thrown in his face. The thing that bothered him was he wasn’t even near the glass. He thought back to when he first came out of hell in the gas station, and Cas’s voice shattered all the windows. Only then did he realize his ears were ringing again. He ran his hands through his hair and pulled at it, growling in frustration.
"Alright chill out Samantha, don't get your panties all in a bunch now."
“So- so Dean will basically by a full-blown angel,” Sam said. Cas noticed how much he was shifting in his chair.
"Yeah, and they put the morgue on the outskirts of it."
"Ashley, she, uh she has. . ."
"Woah, woah, woah Dean are you sure that's a good idea?" Sam said pushing Dean back down with the back of his hand.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“What?”
"Oh, I know you’re not."
"I'm gonna outlive you anyways, wanna talk to the parents or see the body first?"
“Yes, but as I was saying they can’t transfer their wings to a separate plane. So-“
Sam had honestly had never taken Dean as bi, or, pan or whatever. (He also never took him as a ‘super-angel’, but that’s neither here nor there.) He truly didn’t care. He was just upset that Dean had never told him about him and Cas. Sam turned to close the bathroom door not missing the soft kiss Cas placed on Dean’s hairline. He smiled to himself and shook his head as he stepped into the shower.
“So I’ll die.”
“Dean just listen.”
“It was challenging to settle the grace he’s obtained. This helped me to calm it.”
"Dean-" the buzzing gave a small pang of frustration that surprised Dean for a minute he hadn’t expected the connection to stay. He heard Sam sigh over the monitor. "Dean, do you remember how you were scratching at your back in her house?"
His back tensed and caused him to almost completely straighten his back. The shift in his position hushed the talking between the two in the kitchenette, but they resumed talking moments later. He gingerly rolled his shoulders under the duvet, careful not to draw their attention.
“Cas said, well you know how Angels and stuff have ‘true forms’ and all?” Sam watched the blood drain from Dean’s face as a controlled horror swept across his features.
“Right,” Cas agreed, offering a half-hearted smile of reassurance.
“Yeah,” Sam said Dean sighed and put his head on the steering wheel.
"Oh, I didn't know feds cared so much about their old witnesses."
“Like what, Cas,” Dean asked coaxing the angel along.
"Witchcraft?"
He knew exactly what he did, but he's been like this for what? Two? Maybe three days now, and it was already second nature.
“What Sammy?” Dean questioned carefully; truly not having a clue as to what had Sam on edge. Sam gave him a confused accusatory ‘You don’t know what I’m talking about’ look.
‘It followed me.’ He thought.
“Mornin’,” Sam said nonchalantly flicking his eyes over to Dean for a brief moment.
"Nothing that would lead to her death. eighteen years ago they had a woman with mild dyslexia. And family moved here three years ago with a little boy that has autism, he is now six."
"Yeah, but it's not blistering and shit." He said rolling his shoulders, damn his back was starting to itch just talking about it, or maybe it just never stopped.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"What the hell does that have to done with me?"
“Um, no Dean. But I feel it won’t be as drastic as your wings.” Cas said. Dean had been doing good throughout the entire conversation, but he couldn’t help but cringe at the words ‘your wings’.
He's not sure what made him think he could control it, he just felt it. He didn't stress or force the buzzing, he just relaxed it, like a muscle.
"Night, I'll try not to," Dean said trying to keep his voice level.
“No, not really,” Dean responded with a dry laugh. “I mean what the fuck Cas?”
He rolled onto his side and sighed.
"What? What do you mean, what happened?"
“Okay, Cas. What do I need to do?” Dean asked heavily.
“What will he be able to do, when he- ya’ know?”
'Damn, holy water'.
"Oh yeah, that. Um, some glass broke and I must have just cut myself on it."
"Fine, but I wanna go look at the body one more time. And you will stay in the motel while I do so."
"Yeah I'm sure you got a rash through your clothes, and  we put you on thereafter you passed out for seemingly no reason."
"It's just he hasn't answered my prayers, and there's the whole angel-heaven war thing, and I know he's probably busy-"
“When you take your grace, I have not told you everything that is going to happen to you,” Cas said still too ashamed he waited this long to tell Dean.
"I thought you said she had all her organs intact?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dean woke up with a pounding headache from all the crying.
He presented a small silver blade and put it to Dean's forearm. They met eyes for a brief second before Sam pulled the blade across Dean's arm leaving nothing but a thin crimson line in its place.
"She took a Subaru out in the desert?"
Dean balled his hands into tight firsts. He was ready to punch someone, he needed to break something.
"Then I guess we won't have a problem finding clues then will we."
“I gotta stretch my back,” Dean said practically jumping out of the car.
"Not that hungry? Who are you and what have you done with Dean Winchester?"
"Jesus Sam could you stop with the hands, what the hell."
"Dean-" another pang of frustration.
The same skin that just under ten hours ago had cuts with fragments of glass caught in them
Ashley Brennan- White
? Trickster- could be an actual trickster this time around, but we haven't had any signs of a sweet tooth.
"Alright, who are we gonna talk to?"
“Uh-huh, I see.” He said with his expression unchanging.
He closed his eyes and took another deep shaky breath, and turn to leave because with Sam’s anger and his coursing through his neurons he needed to be alone at least physically.
"Uh. . . No, yeah yeah. I'm fine. You- you just sounded worried over the phone, you know?" Shit, they literally lie professionally and he can barely form a full damn sentence.
"Bingo."
“What if I don’t, what if I just want to stay human?” Dean said. Tears already threatening behind Dean’s eyelids. Cas’s face fell. It’s probably hard for Dean to accept this new identity, and being raised in the hunting lifestyle was not helping.
“Seraphs, in order for them to protect the human and the angel race needed to be able to withstand an attack from an archangel,” Cas said hesitantly glancing at Dean. Dean trying his best to seem clueless.
“Okay?” Dean said slowly. Sam gave him a look that said Dean was supposed to know what he was implying. “Sam I-Shit,” Dean said, remembering that he fell asleep in Cas’s arms. He honestly hadn’t expected Cas to stay.
“Dean your life could be on the line here! So can you please get your thumb out of your ass and call Cas!”
"Alright Sammy good work hit the shower I want to go to bed, bitch"
“Dean.” Cas started not exactly knowing how to continue with what he was saying. “You, don’t understand,” Cas said sitting on the foot of the bed next to Dean. He turned his body to face Dean, putting a hand on his shoulder in a vain attempt to provide comfort. He could feel Dean’s grace quivering and trembling inside him like a plucked cello string as Dean became hyper-aware of its presence. He sighed and began again. “Dean you- you were never human to begin with.” He said straight and true. There was no point hiding anything from the green-eyed seraph in front of him. Before he could speak again Sam spoke up.
"Bullshit, you have eaten all day."
None of them really knew what to say. What else was there to say? There was no more information to talk about or discuss. All that was left was action to be taken.
“Yes, when Dean wakes we will need to break this to him as well so we can find Michael's crypt as soon as possible.”
As Sam poured the holy water over Dean's arm the blood and the fresh wound were washed away.
“Dean. what. the hell. Is wrong with you?” Sam coldly grounded out.
“Are we gonna have a problem.”
"Hey-hey Cas." He said. His voice barely up a whisper. He could feel Sam's eyes boring into him from across the room.
'Poor kid' thought Dean. He could feel how tired he was from six miles away. Holy shit, he could feel Sam from six miles away. He could feel him pretty damn strongly too. He thought back to when he was alone in the motel room while Sam was at the morgue. How alive and electric everything was, it was so surreal. It overtook every one of his senses, everything was so pure. He wanted to feel all of it again.
Dean locked the bathroom door behind him and threw his shirt onto the toilet. He turned around and craned his neck so he could see his back in the mirror. Sam was right. There were two red, angry patches on either side of his spine running the length of his entire back.
Sam sat there in silence, watching him mop up the pieces.
"I guess I'm just excited about ganking a witch, to get my mind off- nothin’." Dean cut himself short
“Dean, you two we’re cuddling when I came in.”
"I don't know maybe? You know how weirdly specific witches can get."
"Dean I'm just worried about you. And I know something is wrong, so don't bullshit your way out of it."
"Go take a cold shower I'll get some ice or to put something on it."
His grip tightened on his mug.
“Only my brother is allowed to call me that.” Sam snapped. “And if you have any hope of being left alive he better damn well still be breathing,” Sam said hovering his finger dangerously close to the trigger.
'First with the ringing in my ears, my back fucking itching like crazy, and now I've got whatever the hell this is.'
“I’m never gonna get laid again,” Dean said thinking out loud.
Sam’s temper spiked, in turn spiking Dean’s as well.
Just then Cas flew in landing off to the side of the two brothers.
"No Sam, we can figure this out on our own."
“When was the first time you did this?” Sam said flatly and coldly.
"Of course they did, you find anything in the family history?"
“No problem Dean.”
"Yeah, no it's fine, I'm fine. I'm just gonna grab a shower and clean this up." He said waving his hand at the left side of his face. He grabbed his duffel and claimed the bathroom door behind him.
"What am I gonna do in the motel while you’re at the morgue."
"Dean, your back is red and swollen."
He was taken aback for a second especially because the thought came out of literally nowhere. He didn’t even know what it was, or what its intentions were.
“Yes, Sam?”
"This isn't a good idea"
“Yes, but you can’t tell Cas I told you this. Okay?”
"It's all we got so far. What do you say we check out the house for hex bags after we see the body?"
But then again, none of them really knew what to do, not even Cas. This was sort of dumped on them all of a sudden, and throwing in the older Winchester’s life in the mix gave them no time to think, just to act.
Dean shot up in bed. His head snapped to the kitchenette to see Sam smugly sitting at the small table with a cup of coffee.
"No, I'm not hungry" When Dean said the last two words he realized he hadn't eaten anything since last night, sometime around eight. And he still only ate half his burger, and it was a decent burger he normally finishes it even if it's not that good. He wasn't hungry even in the slightest, he felt like he had just eaten an hour or two ago. What the hell was wrong with him?
Sam opened his mouth to say something but Cas cut him off.
“Grace? Like- like angel, grace?” Cas warmly smiled at him after seeing that he was catching on.
“Shut up. Shut up and shut your stupid face right now.”
“Sam. . .” Just than Cas reappeared. Thank god Dean was on the brink of tears.
Surprise! I'm not dead. I've come up with a sort of schedule that gives me time to write around my classes, so hopefully chapters will start coming out a little faster.
“There is a motel in the next town over called the Cacti Casa. I have already purchased a room for you two.
Dean woke up the next morning with the same ringing in his ears. Maybe all those late-night drives with windows down and music blasting finally caused tinnitus. He's sure Cas can fix it next time he sees him, until then it's soft rock at manageable volume from now on. He begrudgingly rolled and checked the clock '7:54'.
Sam cautiously took one hand off the gun and reached behind him to search the duffle bag on the bed behind him; keeping a careful eye on his brother.
“Sammy, l . . .” Dean weakly started letting the words die-off on his lips. What the hell was he even gonna say to Sam?
“Hello, Dean. Sam,” Cas spoke nodding towards each of them in acknowledgment. “I felt the both of you were awake. I came down so we could begin searching for Dean’s grace as soon as possible.”
This had to be all some bad dream, this just wasn’t real.
“No Dean! I’m telling you the truth, the honest-to-god, straight up truth! The faster you accept that the easier this will all be.”
“You’ve been out for a while.”
“It’s fine let’s go Cas is waiting for us,” Dean said fishing the keys out of his pocket.
He took a sip. Part of him hated the fact he didn’t need it anymore. Coffee, sleep, food, anything that humans need to survive. Humans. His mind replayed. What a human needs to survive, not a seraph.
"Dean we have to talk about this, if it was really a spell of some sort wouldn't everyone who's handled the body is affected and not just you."
"Alright, alright fine," Dean said pulling his shirt over his head. Sam immediately had his hands on him.
'What the hell is happening to me?' He thought to himself.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Dean, seriously. I know something other than Cas and the whole angel war is bothering you and it's obviously affecting your health, so tell me."
When Dean came to he felt stiff, all over. He cracked his eyes open only to be blinded by the ungodly bright lights of the mortuary. He shielded his eyes with his hand and rolled onto his side. When he rolled over a deep aching pain shot through the span of his entire back.
“Okay, I’m just gonna run out and grab a slice. I’ll be back in a few.” Sam said leaving Cas and Dean in silence.
"Fine, I'll have a salad for lunch then."
Monsters:
“I guess we’ll just have to figure it out,” Sam said as Dean leaned back against the leather seat.
"Whatever makes you happy."
"Well, as least she smart about it."
He weakly reached a hand behind him and poked at his back, and the skin turned white under his finger. His skin felt tense and hot under his fingertip. He rolled his shoulders and he could feel his muscle oppose the motion as pushed back against his shoulder blades.
"Wanna go inside see what we can find?"
He sighed and braced his hands on his knees, sitting up straight. He bowed his head closed his eyes.
" 'Bout time"
"Good I think we should still put some ice on it though."
"Dean we don't even know what 'it' is."
"Fine, but I'm not gonna be happy about it."
“Alright.” Sam drew out slowly. “Let’s get to the car.”
He said fingering the cool metal flask in his hand. He unscrewed the top and held his breath as he poured the clear liquid onto his face. It rinsed the glass from his face, but there was no burn.
He reached his hand back and touched the area. It didn't feel any different, it wasn't buzzing or cool like it felt in his head. His skin felt warm and still under his fingertips. He pushed the base of his palms deep into his brain stem and leaned forward till his head was in between his knees. As he moved it felt like his whole reality shifted with him.
"Yup, I'm gonna go get changed into my suit."
He scratched at his shoulder blade. How is he gonna kill a witch if he can't even stand to be around the bodies it leaves behind? He honestly felt bad leaving Sam with the body, probably just because he was afraid Sam would overlook small details. Four eyes find more bruises and nicks than just two, not that Dean would have been much help if he was deaf and unconscious on the floor.
"Dean, you passed out and almost broke your skull open on the floor. Something is going on with you so spill" Sam said handing him a bag of chips and a bottle of water. "Eat."
Dean took a deep breath and rest his elbows on his knees and leaned down knitting his fingers over the back of his neck. He took another breath and relaxed the now fog, which sent out a soft yet large pulse of energy. His energy. His senses once again jumped from ten to twelve as the foggy ozone feeling settled around him. His force brushed along the hot blacktop the impala was sitting on. He could feel the cool water in the barrel cacti that were sitting in the garden in front of the bar.
"Dean we can't just blow over this, and blame it on a witch what happened back there?"
Dean didn’t know if he was being serious or not given their situation, but it didn’t matter right now.
“Cas told me not to tell you. He said he’d tell you tomorrow morning.”
He took a deep breath and honed in on Sam's essence. He felt worried, frustration, concern, fear, and suspicion bloom throughout the back of his skull. He began to worry about his brother, was he worried about the case, was he in danger? He lifted his head up and opened his eyes. As soon as he did the ringing subsided, and the buzzing quieted to a minimum. He picked up his phone and dialed Sam.
He sat up and leaned on the back of the chair bringing his hands to rest on the back of his neck.
“But they’ll be on the sprit plain or wherever Cas’ wings are right?”
“My what Sam?” Dean said opening the driver’s side door.
"I'm not laughing, let's find the and witch kill and 'em. It's probably the only way I'll get better."
“The first night we were here,” Dean said quietly, fast and low. Sam slowly leaned forward. Dean could almost taste the rage dripping off of him.
"Jeez, Sammy why don't you take me out to dinner first."
He was able to quiet the ringing and after it dissipated he ran a hand through his hair and took a deep breath.  A cool night breeze blew through the abandoned lot. The muscles down Dean’s back tensed in response to the breeze blowing over him. 'What the hell is this?' Dean thought to himself as he pulled his jacket tighter around him. He began to walk back to the room and seriously thought about what was happening to him for the first time. It just started. It started in the motel room with the buzzing. Then he took his energy, or the things energy whatever the hell this was and just. He doesn't even know what he did he just did it. He didn't even know what it was, hell he still didn't know what it was. It was still there is was still in him. And it just kept going stronger, tapped into his senses, more than enhancing them. He could feel the molecules moving in everything he passed. Making him a freak. It sickens him knowing that whatever the hell this was, definitely wasn't human. 'This fucking case is unbelievable.' He thought to himself shaking his head.
About ten minutes later Dean felt the buzzing send out a random pulse. A few moments later he heard the impala pull into the parking lot. Sam opened up the door and Dean felt so much worry coming off of Sam he was almost dripping with it. Dean immediately stood.
“No, Sammy,” Dean said resigned. “No fancy magic, just me. I think.”
"Alright fine so get this, this girl, Ashley Brennan, moved into town about four weeks ago. Everyone she talked to for the first week said she was fine, perfectly normal. Then they said as the days went on she seemed to mentally deteriorate. It sounds like it was slow at first then gradually picked up the pace as she started nearing her death. It says her neighbor, Mrs. Jennings became concerned after she didn't see Ashley leave the house for three days. And when she went to check on her she found her lying on the living room floor on a pool of blood with her wrists slit and crossed across her chest like a mummy."
“No, Dean is not a Nephilim but he is a type of angelic species,” Cas said giving the Winchester’s a moment to process the information after realizing they had no idea what was going on.
“Shit,” Dean said looking at the shards of glass that were now scattered all over the floor.
"Leave it, Sammy, I'm really not in the mood."
"Yeah, are you?" Sam said eyeing him. He felt a pang of suspicion, nowhere near as strong as the worry but still there. Alright, so he could use the gift to hide the gift.
“Hm? Oh, nothing. Just a bird.” He dismissed, not liking the all of a sudden feeling of wrongness in the front of his brain.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
They had gone over this with Cas ad nauseam,  that Dean was still Dean and that wouldn’t change. But Sam knew his brother. His brother who had spent his entire life under the illusion he was human was becoming a seraph today, and if he didn’t he would die. And he didn’t know which was worse. He didn’t know what becoming such a powerful angel in such a short span of time would do to his brother.
"That's just ‘cause I was scratching at it." This time he got a pang of anger.
"Dean, I don't know but she has ripped and blistered skin all down her back on both sides of her spine."
This is just an extremely short chapter I wrote because I wanted so more destiel and feels. Chapter 11 is on her way.
About a half-hour later Dean was sitting on the foot of the bed typing away on the laptop when Sam walked in with a five-gallon bag of ice.
He felt Sam start to drift off, the Sam hadn't gotten much sleep since the hunt started. He pulled out his phone and text Sam.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sam and Dean walk into a well-decorated house that gives off a warm homey feel to it. And for the outside of the house looking so old the inside seemed pretty nice. The walls were painted with light warm colors, and the floors and ceiling were made up of solid dark oak that was heavily polished. The furniture matched the floors solid dark oak with a heavy polish. The decor consisted of Native American style vases, blankets, cushions, and a few masks placed on the wall. Among the warm desert-like decor were cameras ranging from old polaroid cameras to the newest Canon models. Behind each of the cameras on the wall were pictures strewed up on a metal wire and held on by clothespins. Dean took a closer look at some of the Polaroids and saw she had written coordinates and a date on each photo, he assumed that was when and where the picture was taken. After a few moments of looking around Sam piped up. "All these Native American artifacts look legit. We could be looking at some kind of curse maybe even a ghost."
“We should be going. Time is of the essence.” Cas interrupted moving to put his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sam didn’t miss it.
"Maybe sweet 'Lil Ashley was being a bitch to their kid, so one or both of the parents hexed away her sanity."
"I'm just worried about Cas."
"So you wanna give it another shot?" Sam said unlocking the drawer, and barley cracking it open. As soon as he unlocked the damn thing Dean’s ears weren't just ringing they were screaming. Dean dropped the bag of chips and covered his ears and dropped to his knees in agony, letting out a grunt as he hit the floor. Dean’s head felt like it was clamped in a vice.
What the hell had he just done?
“Say what Dean that you’re not human? That you’re a seraph?”
“I was correct, you do not have a case in this town,” Cas stated plainly.
“I’m not sure of what he knows what he can do, or how he’s going to react.”
"No, I think the shower really helped." The warm water had just barely relaxed whatever was going on with his back, but it was enough so that when he pushed on it, it had some give.
Dean didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know whether or not to run or hastily explain the events that have been unfolding these past two days or what. His mind was misfiring at a mile a minute; he didn’t even pull his arm back.
“Um it’s, it’s wings.”
His prayer went unheard.
His life has, will be forever changed after this.
“I’m going to go look at Miss Brennan’s body. If my suspicions are correct then you have no case.” Without another word, Cas disappeared with a flutter of wings. Sam turned to Dean and his hands curled into fists at his sides. Dean felt that he was pissed, he looked pissed too.
“Dean, ya gotta eat something you didn’t eat anything for breakfast or at the diner. I can just order a pizza or something.” Sam asked. Dean kept his eyes on the awfully patterned carpet.
"She was a witness in a case a few years back and we're just making sure all the proper paperwork is in order," Dean said, he was over eager to look at the body and kill some witches. He despised witches, fucking hated em'.
Dean flushed a bit, reaching back to scratch his neck.
“Wings?”
“That’s because this isn’t the first time he’s done it. Is it?” Sam said sitting up in his chair. Dean felt how angry and concerned he was. Cas tilted his head and turned back to Dean.
“It’s hard to say, I’ve never seen a seraph’s wings before,” Cas said cocking his head and looking at the empty space behind Dean’s shoulders.
Dean burst through the door with two large take-out bags one, in each hand.
"Damn."
“I, uh, I’m not hungry,” Dean said quietly.
“Yes, Dean was having trouble sleeping anticipating the events that will occur tomorrow. So I aided him.” Cas said. He wasn’t good at reading emotions so he wasn’t sure if Sam brought it or not.
“Dude, what are you talking about.”
“Stronger than an archangel? How?”
"Nada."
“That’s still a lot of land Cas,” Dean said he was looking in between them with his eyes glazed over. He couldn’t even think about what Dean was going through. He could barely comprehend it himself, and it was physically happening to Dean. He also knew how much Dean would try and deny this, but he can’t. Cas hesitated again before speaking.
"Dean, Jesus. What the hell?" Sam said closing and locking Ashley's drawer
“Dean?” Sam asked quietly.
“Sam, I am your brother.” Dean ground out through his tight throat.
“How the hell am I supposed to hunt with wings, how the hell am I supposed to go out in public with wings?”
“It’s fine Sam, I’m not hungry,” Dean said not meeting his brother’s eyes. Sam saw Cas glance up at Dean than to Sam with a solemn look on his face. Cas’ words replayed in Sam’s head. ‘I do not require sustenance. . .’
Sam hesitated for a moment lowering the gun a couple of centimeters. Before his anger reignited and the gun was back in Dean’s face.
The ringing subsided as Sam started scolding him, peachy.
Dean was partly hurt by this, but then again didn’t give Cas much of a reason to stay.
Vamps- all her blood was there
"Your gonna get yourself killed."
“Cas are you joking? You’re telling me we’re on a time limit, and that we need to find something that’s almost impossible to find!” Sam yelled sitting up to the edge of his chair. Cas took a deep breath. This was news to both brothers and they weren’t going to like it tapping into it already.
“What?” Both Winchester brothers asked at the same time. Dean could feel Sam questioning eyes on him.
“Dean?” He said he wanted to prevent Dean from making up his mind. Dean looked up at him. Some part of Dean looked tired and broken. Something that he saw far too often in his older brother. “Dean, I was talking to Cas and there’s a way we can locate your grace.” Dean’s expression didn’t change, so he turned to Cas and nodded for him to continue.
“And are you gonna tell me or just taunt me with it?”
"These are amazing."
“Damn it Sam! For god’s sake, I’m me!” Dean said. “Here,” Dean said giving Sam his bare forearm. “Test me.”
“Yeah fine, just tell me.”
“No Dean!” Sam took a deep breath and ran a hand down his face. “We haven’t told you everything.” Dean turned around to face his brother both equally confused and angry.
Whatever 'this' even was.
“Sammy-.”
"Feds? No offense, but uh why are you investigating a suicide?"
'Sam' he thought he didn't know why but for some reason the buzzing just read Sam.
"Sam listen if I felt like splitting a vein I'd know, so right now we're fine! We don't need to bother him!" Dean was feeling his own frustration as well as  Sam’s in his head, and he really didn’t need Sam arguing with him.
"Okay, sounds a little ghosty I guess."
"I just don't want to mess with it too much, okay?"
“How are you holding up, Dean.” Dean let out a wary chuckle. So this is how he was starting this conversation, Small talk.
“Sam how the hell am supposed to just accept it? I was raised my entire life believing I was human. Turns out it was just a façade, and my entire life, hell my entire existence is a lie!” Sam looked down and put his hands in his pockets Dean had a point.
“Honestly Sam, I know you want to help and support your brother through this process, but I don’t know if there is anything you can do. I myself am not even completely sure how to help in this situation.” Cas responded.
-Victim showed signs of mental deterioration leading up to death; found by a concerned neighbor; found lying in foyer w/ wrists slit; she was the pool of blood she was lying in was in a perfect circle; although her wrist were crossed over her chest her torso and night gown had no blood on it.
The muscles all along his back felt like they were completely seized. He rolled his shoulders forward but it still didn’t help.  He rolled his shoulders back and held them there for a second before rolling them forward nothing helped it. All the movement must have caught Sam and Cas’s attention.
'What kind of mojo was this witch using to leave an effect that strong on a body like that?' Just then he saw Sam coming out of the building.
"She did but I wanna give her a quick once over just to make sure I didn't miss anything."
"Better", he lied
“Dean,” Cas said. He was determined and stern with his words. “I know you can feel it, and by instinct, you know how to use it if you haven’t already.”  He watched chills run down his brother’s spine as a shadow of shame crossed his face.
"How we looking on violent deaths in the area?"
He said as he pulled in out of his bag. He popped it open to find there were no alcohol wipes in there.
"So?" Dean said as Sam stepped into the car
“Sam I one-hundred percent really don’t wanna hear your chick-flick crap right now.”
"It's a fucking witch, it has to be," Dean said to himself as he aggressively dug at his back. Why was his back so damn itchy? He dismissively decided it was dry skin even though it itched like a son of a bitch. He got back to thinking about the case in hand. 'If it hit me so badly then why didn't it affect Sam?' How the hell should he know? He doesn't understand weird witchy shit, besides how to kill one.
"Shit" he sighed leaning back in the bench seat. He really shouldn't do this in the parking lot of a seedy bar, but Sam was being such a mom lately he didn't know when he'd get another chance. Plus it would go away once they ganked whatever the hell is causing this.
"I'm fine"
"Agent Stevens?" Sam said turning completely toward Dean, him and the coroner sharing the same concerned look. Finally, Dean couldn't handle it anymore and passed out "Stevens!" Sam yelled rushing toward Dean to catch him before his head collided with the floor.
“Lunch?”
"Let’s go check the house for hex bags or spell work."
"What? Sam no."
‘Wings’ He thought to himself ‘My brother is going to have wings. That I can touch and see.’ He thought to himself. He put his elbows on the table and rubbed his hands over his face.
“Okay, let’s do this then.” Dean declared getting up and standing in front of Cas. “No, use dilly-dallying right?”
"No, nothing in the supernatural or mental health department. So that means the parents are most likely gonna be a dead end, but it never hurts to check."
He felt energy, his energy, spread out from him and expand in the cheap motel room. He could touch everything in the room with it. He could feel the vibrations for the smallest of molecules, and he could feel every wavelength of light in the room from ultraviolet to infrared.
“But they’ll wherever your wings are, right Cas?” Dean asked still half-hoping Cas would say yes. Cas took a deep breath before speaking.
“And if and butterfly stays in its cocoon for too long it dies.” Dean croaked out in a strained voice that made Cas’s heart shatter at the sound. Cas tightened his grip on Dean's shoulder and looked him directly in the eye.
The buzzing that Dean was beginning to associate as Sam snapped from a sense of confusion to danger real quick.
"Can't hear what Dean? It's a dead body it doesn't make noise."
“I suggest we get going the entire building’s lights have blown out.” Dean sighed and rubbed a hand over his face and went into the bathroom to collect his things as Sam started clearing trash and takeout boxes out of the kitchenette. Cas watched Dean from where he was standing. More importantly, he watched Dean’s soul. His soul was badly damaged already due to the delayed restoration of grace, but the outburst had put even more unnecessary strain on Dean’s soul.
Sam lowered himself down on the kitchen chair, putting his head in his hands and letting out an unsteady breath. His brother was gone, and if his brother does return, he won’t be the same.
“Cas, How the hell am I supposed to do this.” Cas closed his mouth a solemnly took it in for a moment.
“Well, it’s just the way they were created I assume. As I said earlier seraphs were created to protect the angels from Lucifer and whatever he could conjure up. And as you know Lucifer is an archangel. It would be hard for them to protect mankind and angels if Lucifer could smite them where they stand” Sam nodded along, Cas watched his Adam’s apple bob up and down in his throat. Sam’s eyes were red and swollen now. Sam looked over at Dean and then meet his eyes again.
“I dunno, maybe when we got back from the morgue?” Dean answered.
He lulled his head back and closed his eyes. Sam wasn't asleep yet, but he was almost there. He dried off and put on a tee-shirt and loose sweatpants. He turned off the bathroom light, slowly turned the handle, and quietly slipped out of the bathroom. He kept his neck twisted at an awkward angle to keep the left side of his face away from Sam the best he could. He slipped into bed and closed his eyes for the night.
“I’ll try, bitch.”
“No,” Sam said curtly. “One more thing.” He said as he turned back to the same duffle bag and brought out a flask of holy water. The identical match to the one Dean used last night.
"Okay, okay I'm sorry. I'm listening, run it by me one more time and we can both get showers and go to bed"
"Yeah, let's start scanning for EMF see if we can find the object."
"Why not?" Dean said pulling a metal ruler like tool out of his suit jacket. He slid the ruler in between the passenger window and door and jiggled it until it sild left and they heard a 'click'. Dean opened the passenger door with a self-satisfied smirk. "Shall we?"
"I won't bitch"
Dean opened the door with a six-pack of beer in his hand. Sam peeked his fuzzy head out from under the covers to see who came in. Sam was laying on his stomach with the laptop propped up on the pillow, he had open some museum website or something like that. Sam felt like he had only been up for about half an hour before Dean arrived.
"Dean, that’s impossible. Humans can't heal themselves." The way Sam eyed him when he said the second sentence sent chills down his spine. The fact that he used the word ‘human’ made him feel that much more isolated and completely alone. He slowly looked up tears starting to burn his lower lids, he couldn't lose his baby brother. Not Sammy.
Age 23
Dean didn’t resist. He leaned into the touch and curled up against Cas’s chest. As soon as he did he started sobbing. He was finally letting himself feel the events that had unfolded through the past three days. Cas just sat there with him. Cradling him and whispering Enochian comforts into his ear.
“You have two minutes to explain yourself. Then, I blow your brains out.” Sam threatened darkly.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He stripped his shirt and turned to look in the mirror. The swollen parts of his back were still swollen, but now there was a faint red and purple bruising dusted across both sections. He leaned into the cold ceramic sink and ran a hand through his glass flecked hair, wincing when he accidentally pushed a piece of glass further into a cut on his temple. He looked up at himself in the mirror. He looked tired, well he was always tired but this time he looked a little more tired than usual. He rummaged through his duffel for the first-aid kit. A hand wrapped around a worn plastic container.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Alright thank you, Cas.”
“All angels have wings. You will most likely have three pairs. A pair to protect your face. A pair for combat, and a pair to protect the rest of you. The pair that protects your face will be the smallest. The largest pair being the set you would use for battle, and the pair that protects your torso and legs will be somewhere in between.” Cas said finally meeting Dean’s gaze. Now, this was news to Dean. He would not only be stuck with one pair but three fucking pairs of feathers. Three!
“Dean we brought you here to discuss our current ‘situation’” Cas said correctly using air quotes.
"New protocol"
"Dude, bartenders serve alcohol, alcohol makes people drunk. If someone's seen some shit, they'll most likely talk to the bartender."
"Then let's look around some more shall we?"
“When Lucifer first fell, my father created a secondary angel-like species to function as protectors to the angels. To preserve the race. Michaels crypts contain the grace to the entire sub-species.” He watched as Sam tried his best to process the situation and Dean looked like he was on the verge of a stroke. He turned to Dean and gave him a soft look. “Seraphim, that’s what your species is called.” It broke his heart to watch Dean’s world being ripped apart around him. It hurt worse to know that he was the one causing the destruction, but in the long run, it would hopefully be for the best. He licked his lips and spoke up again. “Once a seraph accepts part of its grace must accept all of it.”
“Cas, where do we even begin to look. I didn’t even know Michael had crypts until-“ he waved a hand at Dean and cut himself short. He leaned back in his chair and let out an exasperated breath.
“Cool, Dean you hungry?” Sam asked. It was a seemingly innocent question, but a shadow of shame came over Dean’s face. “Dean?”
"Bartender."
He cringed when he referred to it as a gift, but he couldn’t think of what else to call it. It wasn’t a curse cause, no witch, so it was a “gift”.
"What am I what?" Dean asked. His face pulled in a slight grimace, still scraping the EMF in the same spot.
"Agents O' Conell and Stevens," Sam said both of them flashing their fake badges for the coroner.
‘Manipulate his grace’ Cas had said. He took a deep breath and one more swig of scotch. He felt his eyes roll up and he lulled his head back. He soon became hyperaware of everything in the motel room. He reached out through the bathroom door he could see and feel the vibration of Sam’s soul. He was so light and pure; next to him was Cas, Cas was much grander and regal than Sam’s soul was. Cas’s grace was amazing, it showed all of heaven’s glory through it. He could feel Cas’s grace vibrating along with his, and damn it just felt right. Cas grace extended from his vessel in wisps, touching his surroundings like flame licking wood. He was breathtaking. He reaches out and touched Cas’ grace with his own.
Funny how he enjoyed using it. Hell, almost welcomed it. And not he despised it. Now he saw it as the thing that kept him teetering on the line between human and not human.
“Yeah, Sam,” Dean said brokenly. “It’s me.”
“If you don’t obtain your grace soon I’m afraid you will suffer the same fate as Miss Brennan did,” Cas stated. It sounded flat and grim in the manner he said it.
“Yeah, Sammy?” Dean replied pulling his head out from under the duvet and put his head on the pillow, his back still facing the two men watching him from the kitchen.
Some fucking gift he thought. He probably never would have lost his cool if he didn't feel his anger plus one. He could still feel Sam from the motel room, this time he wasn't even trying. He could feel Sam as strongly as he could when he was standing right in front of him. The same buzzing rage that festered in the base of his skull and stretched to his temples had calmed down to a low vibration. His biceps began to burn, he raised his arms a looked at them. He also started to feel a little winded. He laughed and threw his head back. He laughed out of frustration since he was already pissed at everything. Sam was doing push-ups, Sam was doing fucking push-ups to calm himself down and blow off some steam and Dean could feel every fucking every bit of it. He just wanted to feel alone in his god-damn mind again.
“Well, that’s apparently not true.”
“What?”
'What. The actual. Fucking hell. Is this.'
“What?” Sam said his voice poisonous
“So how big will they be?” Dean asked sheepishly.
"What the hell?" He grunted out.
"I'm not hungry."
“Dean soul in preparing itself to accept his grace, it has already pulled out a thin strand of it from the town’s atmosphere,” Cas said casually as if it were nothing. Dean’s blood ran cold a took a shaky breath before asking.
He pulled his arms in around himself and cuddled into the mattress. He found his mind wandering to him and Cas the night before. He didn’t realize he had a soft smile on his face.
"So, there was nothing that wasn't already in the report. Two slit wrists down the length of the forearm and she bleed out."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dean got dressed while Samantha was doing her hair, Jeans, Flannel, and a utility jacket. 'Winchester chic' he thought to himself. Just then Sam walked out of the bathroom.
-Dean’s P.O.V.-
Dean took a deep breath trying to calm himself, but Sam’s anger just kept feeding his own.
"Good thing I’m not known for my good ideas," Dean said getting back out of the car.
Despite finding nothing, he decided he was gonna take a more complicated way back to the motel.
"Fine" Dean grabbed his shirt and closed the bathroom. As soon as he complied with the already annoyed Sam he felt most of the anger dissipate from the buzzing mass in his skull.
“Yes, I understand Dean. A Seraph’s grace is meant to be whole. The grace you currently possess should be seeking it out. You can use it as a compass that will lead you to the crypt.” Dean closed his eyes and turned his head away as a shudder ran through him.
Okay, did this take twice as long as I said it would take to come out? Maybe. But look, it's not my fault work, school, and college all decided to simultaneously clap my ass cheeks. This chapter is a little shorter than I wanted it to be, but hey content is content. I also wanted to put something out because it has been almost two years since I've updated.  Hopefully, chapter 12 will be posted before the month is out. Though chapter 12 will take a minute because it's gonna be a long one!
He thought.
“Cas said that in order for you to remain ‘undetectable’ all of you must be on the physical plain.”
“Here,” Sam said handing him the case file. Cas took it and flipped through it for a few seconds which dragged on as minutes, piecing together what they had discovered.
“Well, we’ve already established that Dean knows how to tap into his grace, so half the battle is already over. And Sam, I believe it would be easiest if I were to take Dean somewhere remote away from people, so there aren’t too many different energy signatures around.” Cas explained, then turned to Dean. “Is that alright with you Dean?”
"No Dean, we've hunted witches before you know they don't leave evidence."
98 lbs
"Yeah, okay mom," Dean said heavily rolling his. He smirked when the buzzing sent out a pang of annoyance, as Sam hung up the phone.
Sam sighed and rolled his eyes. Dean could have such a thick fucking skull at times, especially when it came to taking care of himself.
"Hey, how's your back?"
"Dean-"
Female
“Uh, yeah. You- you were the first thing I felt that I was able to tell wasn’t me.”
Photographer
As he stepped out of the car he felt wrong again. The same wrong from outside Ashley’s house.
'Damn' he thought 'Time to get to work'. With that, he rolled out of bed and "gracefully" waltzed over to Sam's bed and hit him with a pillow.
"Dean this isn't a joke something has better en  wrong with you ever since we arrived."
"It's nothing."
"No, Dean we don't know what this even is!" Dean stepped back at Sam's sudden outburst. Sam turned his back to him and folded his hands. Dean felt disgust and disappointment pound through the back of his head. "Cas, it’s Sam. Something is seriously wrong with Dean. You need to get down here now, this is important." Dean just hung his head in shame as he sat himself down on the foot of the bed. Not a second later Dean heard a flutter of wings. He looked up to see Cas. First, he looked to Sam probably because he wasn't too happy with being called down. Sam nodded his head at Dean without saying a word.
Dean sighed and flicked the EMF reader off, they had scanned the entire friging house looking for a cursed object and found squat.
“Sam, I- I don’t know-.”
Sam rolled his eyes and went to his duffel, and Dean finished getting ready.
"Well, it's better than we got so far."
"Well damn, guess we got ourselves a little ghost problem then don't we?"
“Dean-“
“Damnit.” Sam cursed as he ran his hands through his hair. “Just come back, Dean. Feathered or not, just come back alive and well. Okay?”
Sam left and shut the door behind him. Cas moved his gaze from the door to Dean, who was still staring at the same spot on the carpet. Deans had a distant look on his face, but Cas could feel the pain contorting and twisting within him. Dean started chewing on his lip when Cas spoke up. “Dean?” Dean looked up with those wide, impossibly green eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He shuttered at the thought that was now a fact.  He leaned against the cool tile. His back itch so badly he wanted to set it on fire. It felt like he had wood splinters digging themselves deep into the muscle of his back. He got up and dug a flask out of his toiletry bag. He gently reached a hand back and touched the skin on his back.
He felt two sensations outside of the small motel room, one he immediately identified as Sam.
“Dean, are. . . are you, you?” Sam asked weakly.
"And they tell why our girl Ashley kept going to and from the desert," Dean said absently scratching at the back of his shoulder with his thumb.
“I mean how is it possible for Dean to even have grace at all, I mean he’s not a Nephilim. Is he?” Sam asked. Both Winchester boys looking at Cas with scared pleading eyes.
"Pop the trunk, you idiot." Sam laughed at the amount of pride on Dean’s face. Dean leaned in and reached over to the driver’s side. Hit a button and the trunk popped open. Sam lifted the trunk, two more gas cans and three more packages of water."Hell looks like she was planning on being out there for a while, look." Sam said gesturing to the surplus in the trunk.
"Killing a witch? Yes, it's a great idea." Sam once again rolled his eyes and gave Dean the iconic little brother bitch face.
“Heya Cas,” Dean said with a slight waver in his voice. Cas turned and opened the motel door, both Winchester’s following him in. Cas sat on the small couch across from the beds and looked to Dean. Dean turned around and faced Cas. The angel had a look of guilt on his face. Dean sat at the foot of his bed and returned Cas’s stare. Sam saw the interaction between the two and excused himself.
“Good” Sam stated as he screwed off the cap.
"I'm worried 'bout him too man," Sam said casually.
Dean still confused by Sam’s behavior and now Sam’s thoughts he was half tempted to glance behind him to see if there was an ‘Intruder’ like Sam’s mind said.
"What the hell Sam?"
"I'm sorry, but twenty minutes ago you were passed out in the mortuary because you were exposed to the body of the girl that lived here."
"Dean, what the hell happened?" He said taking Dean’s jaw in his hand and turned it to the right so that the cuts and glass fragments showed it the light. He had completely forgotten about it.
This was starting now. This was real. The few days leading up to this were just conversations and hypothetical situations. Now he was sitting in a musty motel room, identical to the thousands he’s stayed in before, moments before he begins the process of becoming a type of angel he never knew existed until 24-hours ago.
"About two hours, what the hell happened,  Dean?
He thought about what Cas had said to him before he broke down. They needed to find his grace, the rest it. Because he was- because he wasn’t human.
"Yeah, that is weir- Dean? What the hell are you doing?" Sam asked watching Dean mercilessly scratch at his back.
Sam sat next to Dean in the front seat of the impala. Dean had been completely silent for the whole drive with a brooding look on his face. Sam noticed every fifteen minutes or so Dean would roll his neck or his shoulders, he was clearly sore. They had about twenty minutes left in their drive when Dean pulled Baby over.
“I believe I can give you two tonight to process this, but we must begin first thing tomorrow.” Dean nodded closing his eyes and bringing his hand to his face.
Dean looked at the floor by Sam’s feet trying to decide how to break it to his brother that he was a freak.
"No Sam we're not calling him."
"Dean, aren't you gonna eat your breakfast?"
"What's with the red clay?" Dean said pointing at the tires of the silver Subaru WRX parked in the driveway.
"Well sorry, but I was scratching it right up until you called." Sam rubbed his hand over his face and took a deep breath. Dean felt part of the anger ease back down.
"I'm calling Cas."
"No, I don't"
"Has what Sam?"
“Cas I just learned that my older brother, my immediate blood relative is a completely different species than I am.” Cas could see Sam was on the verge of panicking, most likely from the emotional overload that probably isn’t going to be over when Dean wakes up. Cas watched Dean’s chest rise and fall for a moment before he spoke again. He knew Sam could handle it, and it would go over a lot easier for both boys if they had a task to focus on.
“In order to withstand an attack from an archangel, you would need to be stronger than them,” Cas said still scared to meet Dean’s eyes.
“Cas can you check and see if there is a motel in the last town we pasted? It’s about 30 some miles northeast.” Cas jumped at the unexpected sound.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Here, I help,” Sam said calmly, slowly rising out of his chair.
"Seriously dude?"
“Well, that must have been awkward,” Dean said, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“You are fine Dean, I just wish I could have been of aid. Your first time shifting your consciousness into a different plain must have been disorienting. I’m actually surprised your doing this well.” Dean simply shrugged and looked down at his feet as he kicked the worn carpeting.
“You need to manipulate your grace on your own. I can’t show you how to do that. When you do, you should be able to feel the rest of your grace pulling you towards it.”
“And you had to use your whole body to do that?”. At this point, Cas was panicking. He had no clue if Sam knew or not he just wanted him to stop asking.
“Sorry, Sammy. But hey, I’ll probably still feel you and your support wherever we go. It’s hard to get rid of you.” Dean said, trying to provide solace.
Dean wakes up the next morning. Today he and Cas are going to find his grace.
“I do not require sustenance, but you can order some if you wish.”
"I think you have ghost sickness."
"Nothing."
"Great, thank you."
"I think you need to call Cas."
“When they come in it may take a day or so to get the hang of them, but you should be able to fold them into your back under your skin,” Cas said in a reassuring tone. Dean had never been so fucking relieved in his life. Now that Dean was a lot less stressed he was curious as to what his wings would look like.
“Your face.” The buzzing of Sam’s thoughts began to warn ‘Intruder’. It was subtle; like the little bubbles that form in a pot of water while you’re waiting for it to boil.
"Dean, it looks like the glass friging exploded into your face, and you’re telling me it's nothing."
“Is this a spell, or some sort of enchantment?” Sam asked Dean almost desperately.
“I don’t, I just-. I don’t know. I feel like I’m not me anymore. Like I’m, I don’t know, someone else?” Dean said hesitantly.  “Something else,” Dean said those last words slowly in a low strained voice. Cas could feel the pain rolling off Dean in waves.
As they stepped out of the house Dean sensed something not right. He sensed it that was part of the problem. He just got a feeling of wrong all of a sudden with no idea why. He had what he called his hunter instincts when he could feel someone’s eyes on his back. But this was different. He scanned the area for movement, or anything at all really, anything to explain what he sensed.
“Yes Dean, a from of angelic grace. Congratulations.” Dean ran both his hands through his hair and pushed himself further onto the bed as his mind panicked and spiraled out of control.
“I am not completely sure. As I have said before I have never met a Seraph before, nor have I ever met another angel who has.” Cas admitted furrowing his brow and averting his eyes.
"Ah, well here she is. Nothing special." The coroner opened the small metal compartment and rolled out the body. Now Dean had seen his fair share of dead bodies in his lifetime, hell he even has a body count of his own. But for some reason, Dean couldn't handle it. The body didn't make him sick hell he barely glanced at it, but the second the coroner pulled out her body his head started spinning, his ears started ringing again a painful ringing, and his peripheral vision went blurry. He pressed his palm against his temple and took a step back. The room was spinning faster and he was seeing black dots the ringing in his ears was getting higher and sharper, and damn it was really starting to hurt Dean thought at any second now his head was gonna explode.
“I know, Cas, I get it,” Dean said and Cas fell silent again. After a few moments of silence, Dean spoke up again. “Hey, Cas?”
"Breakfast first, then we see the body."
“Dean, you are and will still be completely yourself. You will just be in a different physical form.” Dean nodded into Cas’ chest and tightened his arms around Cas’ waist. Cas pulled Dean closer in return. He rested his chin on Dean’s head.
"Yeah, but they think we're FBI they aren’t gonna tell us kids tales."
“I mean your species is the most powerful type of angel.” Sam watched Dean physically cringe at the reminder that he’s not human.
"Dean-"
‘Shit’.
He felt a buzzing, a cool almost electric buzzing right at the base of his skull right where his spine met his brain.
“Yeah Cas?” Cas let out a short breath and let his gaze waver for a moment.
"No, I didn't find anything. Although the bartender believes Kevin the guy that lives two streets down is gay."
Tomorrow everything was changing. Even if Dean was only changing physically, it was still going to be extremely hard on him. A few moments later, Deans had tired out into sleep. Cas still didn’t move. Cas looked up when he heard the key being put into the door. Sam walked in and stopped his tracks when he saw the scene in front of him. He was completely still for a couple of seconds before he gave Cas a questioning look. Cas could feel his face immediately flush with color. “Um, hello Sam. . .” Cas said trying to speak around the lump in his throat. Sam raised his eyebrows and nodded.
“Dean, I am sorry. I have not been entirely honest with you.” Cas said not meeting his gaze. ‘Damn straight’ Dean thought to himself but played along anyway.
“So, Dean, I uh, I got back right about, right about when you had fallen asleep.”
"Fine, guess I have to do this myself." He said sucking in a breath and bracing himself harder this time.
"Dean-"
He unblemished skin.
“Which is?”
“Thanks, Cas. We appreciate it.” Sam said awkwardly.
“I couldn’t sleep, so Cas used his grace or whatever to put me to sleep. I had no damn control of what he did after that. He probably thought he was comforting me! Dudes awkward, you know this.”
“No, I would like to think your grace is not that different from an angels or archangels. When you reached out for my grace the other night I was able to recognize it as angelic origin, so going off of what little information we have I would like to say it works similarly. And as you’ve proven the other night as well you already have some idea of how you can use it, so I am confident we will be able to find Micheal’s crypt in time.” Cas said, from the sound of his voice it sounded like he was trying to put this together as they went along.
"Agreed, after we speak with the parents we should hunt down anyone and everyone she's talked to."
“That’s what Cas said.”
"Dean." That was all Cas could say. This was the first time he had ever seen the angel completely speechless. He crossed his arms over his chest and tried to make him look smaller, Cas just stood there completely stunned with eyes wide, if he wasn't scared before Cas' reaction sure as hell did the trick.
"Did you find any leads at the bar?" Sam asked craning his neck to see Dean.
'Dude, you haven't slept much since we started this case. Why don't you get some rest while I'm out?' He felt Sam jump at the sound of the text, it took a couple of seconds before Dean's phone finally buzzed.
"Don't use all the hot water, jerk!"
“Really Dean, then what the hell was that reaction from Cas? And I don’t know if you noticed, but he also heavily implied that you may no longer human.”
'Weird' he thought it felt more like a mass than just swelling. How the fuck can something grow so large and so strong in such a short amount of time. He reached back again and pushed down hard with his index finger.
Sam sighed, rolled his eyes, and turned back to his laptop. He looked exasperated, dean glanced at the clock on the coffee table between the two twin beds '1:48 am' it read in red LED numbers. They pulled into town around half an hour ago found a 24-hour diner for some grub and a cheap motel. Once they walked in Sammy got right to work.
"Sam, what the hell? Is everything okay?"
Holy shit! I haven’t posted in over a month! I’m so sorry you guys! As soon as I got a  schedule set up for my writing the semester and all my classes change. (P.S. I thought the title sounded kinda smutty so I just altered it a little bit.)
“Dean?” Sam asked small and apprehensively. Dean hadn’t heard that voice since Sam was little. It was the voice Sam used to use when he knew they were running out of money and had no idea when or if dad was coming back and he still asked Dean if they were going to turn out okay.
"I'm not sure everything just sort of got too overwhelming, I don't know."
“No, Dean, not like that. It’s- it’s something small.” Dean took a deep breath and physically relaxed.
Ghost- No bloody deaths in the area, EMF, or haunted objects
"Hopefully some answers."
"I say it sounds like a plan."
"Dean c'mon"
“Cas, remember when you were telling us about angels true from?” Cas looked down at his hands and quietly nodded as Sam waited for him to continue.
He said as dove into his unorganized bag once again. He knew he had a flask in here somewhere.
“Dean, why are you so ashamed of yourself?” Cas asked. Dean looked absolutely stunned. Like Cas had all but slapped him with the question.
Sam chuckled and shook his head.
“Dean!” He heard Cas call him which snapped him back into his body. He made a move to stand up and fell over, his back was so stiff and sore. He got up more carefully and unlocked the door. Slipping out the bathroom door and leaning against the wooden door frame. Cas stood there staring at him, his expression both shocked and confused. They stood like that for a second before Cas finally spoke again. “Dean, did you just come in contact with my spectral from?”
“Dean should have all the abilities of a normal angel, though I’m not sure what he will be capable of.”
The last time he remembered Dean truly caring about his well being was before he went to hell and when he came done with ghost sickness. That's also why he wants to take another look at Ashley's remains, he didn't think to flip her over and check her back because he had no reason to. Everything checked out the first time he was there he checked for all the basic monster criteria. He didn't check for ghost sickness.
“Sam I know this is a lot to process right now, but I need you to listen to me. Dean will die just as Miss Brennen did if we don’t locate his grace.” Sam put his elbows on his knees and ran his hands through his hair. He sat like that for a few minutes and meet his watery eyes with Cas’.
“I thought it was whatever we were hunting.”
“Well, you know how archangels are the strongest out of all the angels?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Really Dean? Something is wrong with you. Now I don't know if your sick or depressed or what but your not right. Okay? So just talk to me, Dean, please."
"Come on, there has to something because Ashley's death wasn't exactly all that normal."
“He said he wanted to give you as much time as possible to process everything that’s happening.” Sam cut himself off before he said ‘to you’.
He shifted in his spot as well mimicking Dean’s uncomfortable mood. The entire booth had a tense and awkward tone to it. Cas finally cleared his throat and spoke up.
"I fucking hate witches. You're telling me that you don’t hear that?"
"Yes, now I'm gonna go do some research." Dean gave him a wink a slung his leather jacket over his shoulder.
Dean rested his head on Baby's steering wheel and let out a sigh, then sat up and rubbed his hand against his face. All the while, trying to make sense of the entire scene in the mortuary with Ashley's body.
He scooped them up and threw them in the trash, ringing the towel out in the sink. He sat back at the table across from Sam, who was anxiously rubbing his thigh.
"Sam-"
“At the diner we, we might not have told you everything.”
"Sam we are not calling Cas out of a fucking warzone just to ask him a stupid question, end of discussion!"
Hearing Sam use that voice again scared him for some reason. Maybe it was because he only ever heard that voice before or after things started going to shit.
“Okay, I’m getting in the shower then,” Sam said stepping back. Cas let out a breath he wasn’t aware he was holding as Sam walked into the bathroom.
"For a walk, so I don't shoot you," Dean growled as he slammed the door behind him. The motel they were staying at was just over a hundred meters away from an empty lot. It was probably going to be something before the town was finished, but they must have run out of funding. Now it was just a plot of red clay surrounded by a falling chain link fence and illegally used as a dumping lot by some of the locals. There was old furniture, leftover building supplies, and a car that must have combusted in the Nevada heat. He thought back to how at the bar he was praising whatever was doing this to him, whatever gave him this 'ability'.
"Alright, Sammy, let's hunt us a witch," Dean said opening the diver door and sticking his foot out.
“Sam I didn’t even know what the hell it was! It was just happening completely out of my control! No warning, nothing!” Just then all the lights in their motel room shattered sending sparks everywhere. Sam was left dumbfounded for a moment, and Dean trying to get a handle on the amount of power surging through his veins. In a flutter of wings, Cas was out of the motel room and back in less than a second.
"The dude's busy, from what he tells it sounds like heaven is still in shambles and the angels are still in broken into factions."
“Sam-“
He could feel it his, his grace, stirring inside him. The cool electric vibration spiraling around his soul. He inwardly cringed at the feeling of it.
Dean didn’t even take his hand away from his face as his eyes snapped to Sam’s.
Dean said sheepishly scratching the back of his neck. He could feel his cheeks warm up, 'Son of a bitch' he thought. 'I'm acting like a seventh-grade girl talking about her crush.'
Sam let out an impressed chuckle. So, his brother can in fact sense him. He thought to himself as he typed his reply.
“I don’t believe this is a case.” He said calmly and matter-of-factly handing the file to Sam.
“A-“ Cas stopped himself from saying seraph because each time he said it the Winchester’s looked as if they had both been stabbed. “People like Dean can only pick up pieces of their grace if they are within a 100-mile radius of a crypt.”
"Sam.  . . What are you implying?" He asked shakily, sadness, exhaustion, and denial taking his voice from him. Sam stayed silent and gave him a once over before making up his mind.
“Why the hell not?” Now Dean was angry with him.
“Um, how ‘bout we go grab lunch so we can uh. . . Talk about everything.”
“Does Dean even know he can do that?”
“That might not have been the first time I tried that,” Dean said. Eyes still fixated on the floor. Sam huffed a breath as he leaned back and ran his hands through his hair.
“Hey, I said we’d figure it out,” Sam said with a half-hearted chuckle.
“When?” Sam asked.
After a while, they had moved back on the bed. Cas was against the headboard with Dean still in his arms pressed against his chest, their legs intertwined.
“Cas, how the hell am I supposed to hunt and let alone leave the bunker if I have wings?” Dean said. The panic from earlier flooding back into his system. “Three damn sets of ‘em”
"What?"
His back had swollen out about an inch from what it was this morning. He sighed and took a long pull from his flask. Rolling his shoulders he could feel the hard mass in his back that was causing the swelling. Cas’s words echoed around in his skull. Cas’ plan. What the hell would happen to Dean once they went through with it. Fuck he might as well try this on his own one last time before they watched him do whatever it was he did.
"Not yet maybe, I'm coming back now. Don't touch your back."
"So I'm guessing we can rule out cursed object then," Dean said using the antenna on the EMF reader to scratch along the length of his shoulder blade.
“What? No. No! Stop that. stop that right now! Nothing happened last night because nothing is going on.”
“Yeah.”
“Awesome, so we’re just gonna wait around till I self-destruct then?” Dean said, waiting for Cas to finish his thought.
How would Dean cope with this transition? Would he hate himself for what he is and lock himself in the bunker for eternity? Would he go straight to heaven and make them straighten themselves out? He was stronger than an archangel it’s not like they could resist. Being the martyr that he is would he take his newfound power and go on a killing spree, purging the earth of every creature that goes bump in the night?
“Yes, Dean?”
Almost immediately Dean felt Sam slip into a light sleep, and the buzzing went from a buzzing to almost a fog, or and cool mist.
“No Cas how can you say that. I’m not human. Apparently, I never was, and you just want me to accept that and become a full-blown s-“ Dean cut himself off. Not because he couldn’t remember the name, but because he couldn’t accept it. Cas pulled Dean towards his chest resting Dean’s head on his shoulder. Sam left to get some air. Dean nuzzled his face into the crock of Cas’s neck and began to cry. Cas just sat there rubbing his hand along Dean’s back as silent sobs racked through his body. Cas could feel firm bone and muscle under Dean’s shirt along each side of his spine. He closed his eyes and sighed, he knew what it was and if Dean can’t deal with the current changes happening to him then this wasn’t going to go well either.
"Than what the hell affected me when you brought out the body because it was pretty damn strong and pretty damn witchy."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I don't know clean your plethora of guns, sharpen your knives, research on what the hell we're trying to hunt."
“So Cas how is this going to work. How is Dean supposed to ping his grace?” Sam asked, turning in his chair to face the angel.
“Yeah,” Dean said quietly and hesitantly.
He squeezed all his features and push his hands harder against his head like he was trying to force the sensation out of his spine.
“I, uh, I think I left my phone in the car. Be right back.” He said nodding to Dean as he left. As soon as the door shut Cas started to speak.
"Nothing?"
Dean put his elbows on the table and rubbed his shaking hands together. He could see older brother was on the edge of his breaking point. The only other time he had seen Dean this torn up was when he was twelve hours away from hell, even then he seemed to be handling it a little better. Dean rubbed his thumbs on the bridge of his nose and took a shaky breath.
