“You want to drag a…a siren who has to be at least ten feet long out of a pool? Dean, he probably weighs more than the both of us combined. I don’t know if we will be strong enough,” Sam said skeptically.
“Bye cher.”
Dean shrugged. “I wouldn’t have been very handsome being gray and wrinkly.”
Dean sat back on the bed; his head buried in his hands. “I lied about what happened, Sam. Benny and I didn’t break up because things didn’t work out. And I wasn’t mugged either. It was dad,” he finished on a whisper.
The boy took it and smiled up at Dean. “Thank you. I’m sorry for running into you. Daddy always gets onto me for not looking where I’m going.”
“I won’t know until you tell me,” Eileen replied tersely.
Dean Winchester’s life was shit, no other way around it! He took another sip of beer from the bottle he held in his hand before sitting it down on the brick wall next to the already empty bottle. Dean huddled into the denim jacket he wore as a breeze flowed through the tops of the trees that surrounded him. His green eyes were empty as he gazed at the scenery in front of him, not taking any of it in. His eyes flicked to the statue next to him.
“Hello, Castiel. It’s been a while since I ran into you,” she said as she started throwing clothes into a washing machine.
“Trust me cher, I’ve got plenty of ideas but first I need to get some food in you or else you might not have enough strength,” Benny quipped.
Dean stood to his feet and gave a quick bow. He studied the tear tracks on Cas’ cheeks and the raindrops in his hair. “Cas, you shouldn’t have been out in the rain. You could get sick.”
The unicorn looked at Meg warily, finally answering her question. “I do not know if your magic will come back. It may have been a fleeting accident, and the only time you will experience such a thing. It could also be the first of many times you will harness the power of true magic. Only a person who can see into the future could answer your question, and even a unicorn doesn’t have that ability.”
Cas looked back at Dean, worry in his eyes.
Cas looked at the clock on his nightstand and groaned. It wasn’t even seven yet, and he had gone to bed late the previous night, working on his manuscript. It looked like coffee would be necessary this morning if he planned on making it through the day. Cas focused back on Jack, who was wriggling in his lap with excitement at the prospect of getting his favorite breakfast. Cas suddenly reached out and started tickling his son, causing Jack to burst into laughter. “Here comes the tickle monster!”
Dean had spent that night and every night since at Cas’ house. It had been an easy decision for Dean to move into Cas’ house. He didn’t want to have to uproot Jack a second time, and Cas loved the little pond by his home. Dean also had a lot less stuff to move, and Cas’ house was larger than his own.
Michael nodded once. “If it doesn’t, you can just bring me back and we’ll try again.”
Everybody was shocked when the woman sobbed and pulled Cas into a tight hug. “Thank you! He might not be my flesh and blood but he’s still my son and I don’t know what would have happened if we had lost him.”
“Uh, sure,” Sam said slowly.
The man shook his head. “Hmm, my foot must have slipped.” He glared at the unicorn. “Alright, boy, c’mon. A handsome horse like you will fetch me a pretty penny at the market.”
Dean shot to his feet, “No, I don’t Sam and I can’t. It’s…it’s not right.”
“Dean, what about Jack?” Eileen asked as she squeezed his hand tightly.
“These past weeks without you have been the worst of my life. I’ve been depressed to say the least. My family has forced me to go to work and eat, but nothing held any appeal because you were gone, Cas. I might be home for you, but you’re life for me.”
Dean flipped his brother the bird and took a deep gulp of coffee. “We can’t all rise with the sun bitch.”
Charlie- Another new set of Harry Potter books
Cas dropped his hand and Dean tracked the motion, understanding quickly dawning. Cas’ erection could be seen tenting the skirt that covered his legs.
As Dean drove, his thoughts were all on Cas. He couldn’t believe that Jack had managed to pull the angel from the Empty, and he was now alive and well in Heaven. Dean needed to find Cas and tell him how he felt. Sam got his happy ending, and now it was time for Dean to get his. With his thoughts consumed by Cas, Dean wasn’t paying attention to where he was going. He was surprised to see a familiar barn appear to his left.
“I think it’s charming. I wish I were so bold,” Cas remarked.
Dean snuck his hand between their bodies to grasp both their cocks and started pumping them, their combined precum making it easy for his hand to slide up and down. Cas threw his head back, his eyes closed, and his bottom lip held between his teeth.
Cas rolled his eyes. “Mhm, that’s certainly the reason. Did you really ask Jack if you could propose to me?”
When the sun rose, Cas decided to go fetch breakfast for Dean. He went back to the diner they had visited yesterday. He ordered the Grand Slam breakfast which had all of Dean’s favorites: fried eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and hash browns. He ordered two large black coffees, Dean’s preferred way, and made sure there was lots of syrup, salt, and pepper in the takeout bag.
“He better be, now that you have that angel for your husband,” a gruff voice said from behind them.
Cas tucked his pens and notebook in his apron pocket. “It doesn’t matter, Jo, we just can’t.”
Meg said three soft words, too low for even the unicorn to hear. Before the unicorn’s eyes, the bars vanished, and he was once more in his forest. Tall trees surrounded him, and beneath his cloven hooves was bright green grass. Many of the animals of the forest were there, staring at him with joy in their eyes. The unicorn felt his heart grow light as a feather, and he would have leaped into the night, but he knew it was an illusion. The cold iron bars of his prison still surrounded him. Slowly the scene faded away until only Meg stood in front of him once more.
Before Cas could reply, Dean stood up and said, “Can everyone quiet down for a minute; I have something to say.”
“I know and I was against it, but it was Cas’ idea. He said with her being our mom, he doesn’t want to keep such a big secret from her especially if he’s going to be around for a while.”
Later that night, Dean was walking up the winding staircase to his room. He held one of his poems in his hand, reading it to himself. Dean turned a corner and almost crashed into Cas. Cas was nearly running down the stairs, and when he saw Dean, he let out a strangled cry.
“But if you don’t get the dragon to leave, you’ll be separated from your brother for even longer,” Cas pointed out.
Dean jumped. “Shit, I don’t know how you can move so silently. I swear I’m gonna tie a bell to you one of these days.”
“Dean,” Cas cried. His wings instantly disappeared as he reached for his friend. When Dean looked at him, it was with recognition and despair.
The little girl screamed while Cas just stood there, utterly confused. Dean stopped just short of running into them. He grabbed the mask and pulled it off his head. His hair was spiked up and a few beads of sweat ran down his face. He looked at Cas, his green eyes full of confusion. “You ok baby?”
Ignoring his brother, Sam explained, “When Dean and I were children, we used to have these dreams almost every night about the Red Bull. In them, we were standing at our windows, and we watched the Bull… we watched him-”
“Let them run,” the king growled. “Let them run for in the end; they shall not escape me.”
Michael smirked. “It seems that you’re losing the fight against my father.”
Castiel sighed heavily, bored with what was going on in front of him. “This is going nowhere. Can I go find Dean now?”
“Oh, well, that’s not so horrible. Does it have to be a long kiss?” Cas asked, as innocent as ever.
Jack handed him the phone, and Cas went to his gallery and pulled up the latest picture. His lips curved up as he looked at the family photo they had just taken. “It’s perfect!”
“I know…I uh, I mean, I assumed based off the food that was in your fridge,” Cas said quickly to cover his mistake.
Cas sighed heavily. “I know. This course was a lot harder than I thought and it’s been tough without you.”
*************
Jo nodded her head excitedly. “He’s amazing, Dee. We spent the entire afternoon yesterday getting to know one another, and I’m pretty sure I’m already in love. It’s crazy how well we get along. I was going to call Sam and ask if he would mind me bringing Mason to Christmas dinner. His family lives out of state, and he couldn’t afford to go home for the holidays.”
Dean finally tore his gaze from his brother and let it land on his boyfriend. “I see that, why didn’t you call me?”
“Hey Castiel. You showed back up, that’s awesome. I would have been pissed had I done all this work and you stood me up. C’mon inside,” she stepped to the side and gestured for him to walk through the door.
“It’s one thing I won’t mind getting used to.” Sam checked his watch. “We’ve gotta get going in a few minutes. I’ve got something to give you.” Sam went to his duffel bag and pulled out a small box. He handed it to Dean. “Here’s your something new.”
“Dean, you ok,” Sam asked with a raised eyebrow.
“It’s good. Thank you.”
“Dean, you have steak in the freezer and why in the world would you spend so much money on a couple pieces of meat?”
“You really think that the prophecy is talking about King Winchester and us?” Eileen asked skeptically.
“Well, maybe if she wasn’t so controlling, I wouldn’t have dumped her.” Dean stared at the yard in front of him. Finally, “I don’t know if I could look at another guy without hearing dad’s voice in my head,” he admitted.
“I wish we could be! I want you so bad; I have for years but I never imagined you reciprocated those feelings. I do love you Dean, I just didn’t know you loved me too,” Cas said as he stepped closer.
“Oh, c’mon Cas, she’s fourteen, pretty sure I’m not the only one she’s heard say that word. Now, Jack, yeah, I could understand. He’s only eight and way more sensitive than we could ever hope for Claire to be.” Even though Dean bantered with his husband, he still pulled his wallet out and dropped three dollars in the glass jar sitting on the kitchen counter.
A ripple traipsed through the unicorn’s body as he listened to Meg’s words. His heart had grown heavier with every passing second, and the butterfly’s words suddenly passed through his head. “They passed down the roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close behind them and covered their footprints.” He let out a sorrowful whinny before saying, “The Bull is real, that I know. I guess I will travel to this King Winchester. Meg, I owe you a debt for freeing me. Please tell me a way in which I can repay you.”
“Are you saying what I think you’re saying? Your dad beat your brother because he wasn’t straight,” Gabe questioned, his expression softening.
Sam took in a deep breath and wiped at the corner of his eye. “I’m trying not to think about her because if I do, I can’t do the job. I loved her Dean and if this whole plan doesn’t work… I’m just hoping it does. How are you doing? I know how much Cas meant to you, even if you never said anything.”
“Patience sweetheart,” he reminded Dean.
Castiel had broken protocol when he became Dean’s guardian. He should have either saved Mary or let her die and choose a new charge from a list given to him. He had switched his guardianship from Mary to Dean right there in the burning house. Michael had not been happy and had threatened Castiel with punishment if he stepped out of line again. Maybe that’s why Michael kept visiting Cas, to punish him.
“Well, you have this whole thing planned tomorrow for Cas so why don’t you tell him then. It’d be really romantic,” Sam said goofily going so far as to make kissing noises.
She was broken from her thoughts when Sam asked, “What do we do now? How do we get out of here?”
Dean smiled back and then focused his attention on Michael. “Cas.”
“Bobby told me you walked into the institute after that storm completely unscathed. Just trying to put pieces together. Tell me, how did you manage to get back to shore in those waters?” Alistair asked suspiciously.
“No, I’ve done a piss poor job at explaining! It’s not what you said that’s causing the nightmares; it’s what I didn’t say that’s causing them,” Dean growled.
Naomi asked.
The two boys walked out of class together, Cas drawing as he walked. Dean kept an eye out to make sure Castiel didn’t run into anything, but he didn’t need it. The other student avoided every obstacle with ease. They said their goodbyes as they parted ways, Dean going to science and Cas walking towards the art building.
he wailed as his hole was stretched wider.
“Wait, you’re gonna fly?” Sam asked disbelievingly.
“Yeah, and it’s all because of you, Cas. I don’t know why you decided to choose my sorry ass to help, but thank you,” Dean said sincerely as he stared into the oceans of Cas’ eyes.
Crowley led a small group of peasants from cage to cage, enlightening them as to what each wagon held. The first cage they stopped at contained a large, orange, lizard-like creature with wings for front legs. “Here is a wyvern, similar to a dragon but with two legs instead of four. We caught him terrorizing some poor town, snatching children up and carrying them off to his nest. Keep poking the bars, little boy, and you might lose a hand before you walk out of here. Creatures of night, brought to light.”
“Liar,” Dean shouted. “Why are trying to take all of this away? I thought we were happy together.”
Dean was exceptionally close to Ellen. After he had lost his voice, his parents had been so disappointed with themselves that for a few weeks they could barely be around him. During that time, Ellen had stood in for them. She had been the one to suggest that Dean learn sign language. She would practice every day after school with him and had even helped teach the rest of Dean’s family.
“I know I don’t. At this point in my life, I’ve fucked too much up to be worth saving.” There was no fight in Dean’s words. He truly believed what he was saying.
“Meg, leave the skull,” Castiel said softly. “You got it to talk. Maybe that’s all you need for this riddle you’re trying to solve. If all you’re going to do is argue with it, I’m going to find Dean.”
“Psh no. I also want a couple of slices of your awesome apple pie and a peppermint hot chocolate,” Dean answered.
“Cas wasn’t on a boat; he was in the ocean. He’s not entirely human, Ellen.”
Sam- ??? Maybe a new briefcase; his is looking pretty raggedy
Dean walked up to the new God. “Hey, Son,” he said before pulling Jack into a tight hug.
With the magic swirling inside of her, Meg raised her hands and started speaking. The words could barely be heard over the Bull’s bellowing, but Meg knew what they were and what they meant. She also knew with great clarity that from then on, she would be able to repeat the words and draw on her magic whenever he wanted. She spoke gently, a smile on her face.
He was glad the clothes and bag he had purchased were from the local Goodwill. He knew having brand new clothes would have made Dean suspicious of the story he was trying to fabricate. If he was going to help Dean, he needed to be able to be close to him and he was hoping pity was the way to go.
“Dean, what do you need so many paper lanterns for? Are you throwing some kind of party,” he asked exasperatedly.
“How could he do that? How could he leave me when he was the only family I had left? Bobby and dad had passed away, so it was just me and Sam. Everything I had done had been for him and he just up and left to Stanford without looking back,” Dean ranted.
When he was back on his feet, Cas reached out and held Dean’s face in his hands. He placed a few tender kisses to his lips before smiling and saying, “Hello, Dean,” in a deep, raspy voice.
Dean glanced behind him before looking back at the other man. “Let me go tell my friend where I’m going.”
. Just go inside and I will be in shortly to explain everything.”
“I know, and thank you for sacrificing yourself for me… again. Can you promise not to do that anymore? I… I can’t handle losing you again,” Dean said with a chuckle, trying to hide just how much losing Cas this last time had hurt.
Dean shrugged. “I was a shoot first, ask questions later kind of guy back then. It was pretty hot when you pulled that demon blade out and just dropped it to the ground. Although, all I could think was, ‘Oh shit, this dude just pulled the knife out of his chest as if it was nothing. I’m so fucked.’ I’m really glad you just wanted to talk.”
Dean moved to wrap his arms around Cas’ waist, and Cas leaned into the muscular chest. “Alright. If he gets to be too much, just let me know.”
“Of course, freckles. Let me pick out the one I like the most and then I’ll put the other two back,” Cas replied.
Eileen grabbed Meg’s arm and squeezed tight enough to leave bruises. “Do something, please do something before the Bull takes him like he took all the others.”
Cas chuckled at his boyfriend. “You can have all the cuddles in the world. Nobody would ever be able to tell that you were nervous as you stood up to Alistair. You’ve come a long way Dean in a short time.”
Dean held onto Cas’ hand tightly and his voice was small as he asked, “Cas, is that really you?”
“SAM, DEAN,” Jack shouted. He looked at Chuck, his eyes glowing a deep gold. “NO! You will not hurt them or this world any longer!” He shot a bolt of darkness straight into Chuck’s chest.
Dean barely noticed Meg leaving, his eyes still staring at Cas’ trench coat clad form. He had tears rolling down his eyes, but he made no move to wipe them away. He finally dropped his eyes, not having a clue what to say to the man in front of him. He had just caused Cas unimaginable pain and for what? Dean had chosen to let Cas go through something so horrible because he couldn’t imagine living the rest of his life without him.
Once he was done with his call, he asked Cas if he wanted to go swimming in his pool. Castiel eagerly accepted, and Dean set a world record in changing into a pair of swim trunks. Once they were outside, Cas suddenly got very shy. He stood on the porch and kept looking around, refusing to go any further.
“They’re about the night that I lost- that you were taken by the Empty,” Dean admitted, looking straight ahead.
After a few minutes, Dean pulled his fingers away and slipped out of bed. He picked Jack up and sat him on his shoulders. “Alright, monkey, it’s present time! Buckle your seatbelt and hold on tight!”
Cas nuzzled against Dean’s cheek. “I couldn’t, even if I wanted to,” he admitted. “I told the magician that when I returned to my forest, I wouldn’t be happy here like I was once. My time as a mortal has left me longing for things that no unicorn has ever wanted before. I want companionship. I desire love. I need… I need you. I am lonely, far more than I ever was as a human.”
“It doesn’t matter Cas. Sam would never talk to me. It’s been too long and I’m sure he despises me. I was an absolute dick to him the last time we talked to each other,” Dean replied downtrodden.
Cas rubbed at his eyes tiredly. Getting Dean to make new friends would be a good thing for him. He would need their support when Cas’ grace finally snuffed out. Maybe if Dean and Benny hung out more, Benny could introduce Dean to even more people. Cas wasn’t sure he would be very good at finding more friends for his charge. He picked his book up and started to read some more.
Dean set the jacket and bags on the counter. “I think so. I can cross Jo and Eileen off my shopping list, so that’s a plus.”
Meg looked away. She had been harboring a secret for the entire journey and had hoped to keep it that way. She knew, now, that it was impossible to do so. Meg faced Eileen, a heavy sigh escaping her. “There is a prophecy that was predicted long ago when I was just a baby, and you, Eileen, weren’t even born.”
“Sorry for scaring you. I’ll try and keep it toned down,” Charlie said. She looked back at Dean. “So, is that the only reason you stopped by today?”
Sam reached up to knock on the door, but before he got the chance, it opened wide leaving his hand hanging awkwardly in the empty air.
He decided to continue working on fixing up the kitchen. They had every cabinet freshly painted and all the electrical outlets and appliances were once again working. They had replaced the pantry door and painted the walls. They were supposed to pull up the old flooring and put fresh tile down but with Dean gone, there was no way Cas could do that on his own.
Cas studied the words, only able to understand some:
Jack threw his arms around Dean and hugged him tightly. “I will, I promise. Can we go open presents now?”
“Come, magician, tell me what you know of me,” Chuck insisted as he took a seat.
“So, what are we watching tonight?” Dean signed.
At this point, the waitress brought Dean’s food out to him. Dean asked for another beer and then she left them alone. Cas watched as his companion took a large bite out of his burger before continuing to talk.
By now, the food was able to be pulled from the oven and Cas set the hot pan on the stove before heading off to get Dean. He found the man crumpled on the floor staring at the wall, a look of resignation on his face. Cas hurried to his side.
“Ok, Daddy, five minutes. I’m gonna have Papa time you,” Jack said cheekily.
Chuck’s face contorted into one of rage. “You! You took my sister’s power from me! The little Nephilim that wasn’t even supposed to exist! You were never in my stories and you’ve been a pain in my ass ever since!”
Dean replied to the question and Cas wished they were touching so he knew what was being said.
Dean wiggled his eyebrows, “You plan on tiring me out big boy?”
Castiel had no answer as they all took a seat around the large dinner table. He sat sandwiched between Dean and Sam with Mary and Bobby sitting on the opposite side. It was eerily silent in the kitchen.
As soon as they walked into the bakery, their noses were assaulted with dozens of scents ranging from crisp apple to sweet caramel. Glass cases filled with dozens of sweet treats, including pies, cookies, cupcakes, and more lined the far wall. The walls were covered in hand-painted bakery treats, and there were a few tables scattered about for people to enjoy their confections. Cas was thrilled to see a coffee kiosk in the back corner, and he knew he would be stopping by quite often in the future.
“I’ll be the judge of that,” Ellen replied with a hard edge to her voice.
“But the prophecy said-”
“Dean, you were sixteen! What dad did should have never happened! I mean, Mom and I didn’t care that you guys were dating.” Sam looked away from his brother, his mouth set in a firm line.
Dean grumbled.
Meg stared at the demoness before looking back at the unicorn. “You mustn't be caged when Ammit frees herself. If you are, she will kill you as surely as she will kill Rowena and Crowley.”
Dean held his hands up in mock surrender. “Yes sir, no arguing.”
Cas stepped back and let out a neigh that sounded like bells ringing. “Of course. We don’t need that magician. All the magic we need is within me. I might not be able to make myself anything but what I am, but I can change others. Unicorns have the ability to defy death; of course, we can change a man into one of us.”
“I don’t remember his name, sorry.”
As Jack and Cas walked towards one of the stores, Cas was surprised at the number of people who greeted him and was even more surprised by how many knew his name. He was startled at first, having grown up in a vast city where he often felt alone even though thousands of people surrounded him. Cas felt a warmth growing in his chest, and he decided that he loved living in a small town like Black Creek.
“Who knew you could be the eloquent one,” Cas snipped.
Cas snorted next to him, obviously amused by his boyfriend’s clumsiness.
Cas stroked Dean’s length in time to his thrusts, and Dean broke their kiss to beg, “Please, honeybee, please let me cum.”
“You couldn’t have done that in my realm? You know how much I loathe these humans,” the man snapped.
Dean huffed a breath out before taking a sip of his coffee. “The moose finally has free will, and he uses it to take a jog. Crazy health nut.”
Castiel chuckled in his head causing Dean to stop his onslaught of questions.
Cas whimpered.
“Good lord, not you too! I can see Dean is already teaching you bad habits,” Sam groaned.
The magician smiled and chuckled in relief. “I knew that witch wouldn’t be able to fool a creature such as yourself. Rowena has magic and potent magic at that, but she’s made one too many mistakes. Her time draws closer with each breath she takes. These creatures she boasts, as you’ve realized, aren’t real.”
Cas tilted his head, looking at Dean with confusion. “Why would that bother me?”
She crossed her arms, staring all three men down. “So, you’re going to tell me that a grown man who is unable to speak hasn’t learned sign language or some other way of communicating?”
Meg seemed to realize Dean was bluffing. Instead of saying anything more on the subject, she said, “Alright, so the total is going to be three hundred and fifty-two dollars and forty-three cents.”
He understood spoken words much more than written words.
The older man was silent; his eyes hadn’t left Castiel’s figure, and he was eager to speak to the man. “What reason have you come to see the king?”
Sam shook his head. “I didn’t, but it will be nice to catch up with him as well.”
Dean smiled as he could hear the love filling his fiancé’s voice. “I can’t wait to marry you either. I still can’t believe I’m playing the part of the bride.”
Dean stepped closer until he could lean his forehead against Cas’. “That might be what you are now, but you were human once, Cas. You felt human emotions and did human things. I courted you. I told you my deepest and darkest secrets and shared my fears, hopes, and dreams with you. I sang for you to keep the nightmares at bay. I cooked for you and took you on picnics because I knew how much you loved the open space and the sunlight. We laid in my bed, and I wrapped you in my arms because it made you feel safe and protected. I sacrificed myself for you so that you would have the strength to defeat the Bull. I served you in every way that I could so that I might earn your affection. I know that I did. I know that you love me, even now as a unicorn. Meg may have restored your true form, but she didn’t take your memories from you. Please, Cas, I’ve looked for you for months, don’t turn me away now that I’ve found you.”
“We won’t have to worry about any more orders from Alistair.”
Dean said before standing up and walking to the crank to lower the net into the water. He watched Cas swim into the net and made sure he was fully inside before lifting his boyfriend out of the water. As soon as Cas was safely on deck, Dean was rushing over to get him out the net.
Meg’s eyes widened in surprise. “You can’t come with us! We are on a quest, and we don’t need any additional help!”
She noticed Dean watching them. “C’mon Dean, give me a hug as well.”
“I guess you’re right. I promise I won’t have more than two beers while I’m with him. I’ll let him know and that way he can watch out as well. Are you sure you’re going to be ok all on your own?” Dean asked, voice laden with concern.
Bobby turned to Dean. “Son, what happened? How the hell did Alistair get a hold of Cas?”
“We will give Sam and Eileen’s baby as much attention as possible,” Cas agreed, a small smile on his face.
Dean put his jacket back on before the two of them walked back to the map table. Michael and Jack looked up as they walked back in. “What’s everybody standing around for? We’ve got God to kill,” Dean said.
“That’s awesome! Maybe we really can win this,” Sam said enthusiastically.
“I’m pretty easy to shop for as well. I’m a teacher, so I’ll never say no to school supplies. Like Jack, I love automobiles and collect model cars, especially vintage ones. I can’t wait to show you, Baby. She’s the most gorgeous car you’ll ever see. I also like rock music and have a large collection of vinyl that I play all the time.” Dean fell silent, and a blush crept across his cheeks. “And believe it or not, I love putting puzzles together. The more pieces there are, the happier I am.”
The kid popped up right in front of them. “Just let me know when you’re ready to come back.” He reached out and touched them on their foreheads, instantly transporting them to a secluded cabana on the beach. They dropped their suitcases off in the bedroom and walked onto the porch. They both gasped at the sky, which was a gorgeous array of reds, oranges, and yellows as the sun slowly moved below the horizon.
“We go to work for eight hours a day, Dean. We aren’t together then,” Cas pointed out.
Dean wanted to snarl back and say Jack was right. He wanted to punch the kid for allowing Cas to make such a deal. He wanted to wish Jack had never been born and then they wouldn’t be in this mess in the first place. As he watched Jack fall to the ground and tears pour down his face, Dean knew the kid was just a victim as much as the rest. “No, it’s not,” he said, his voice carrying in the silence.
Cas stepped into Dean’s space, sliding his palm around the back of his boyfriend’s neck, and kneading the tense flesh. His lips stretched in a smile as he said, “I would never drop you beloved. I just want you to experience flying like I do. It’s totally different with wings then it’s on a plane.”
“I had to help a friend come back from his own addiction so yes I have experience with such things.” Cas frowned as he thought about the months it took to heal Gabriel of his addiction to drugs.
“I would like that. Thank you for the offer.”
Dean looked over to see Jack and Cas rocking back and forth, and his heart felt as if it would burst with happiness. For the first time in his life, everything was perfect. His friends and family surrounded him, people he would and had laid his life down for. He had two amazing kids and was finally married to the man he had been in love with for years. If someone had told Dean a decade ago that this is where his life would lead to, he would have laughed in their face. Dean had never imagined anything but his life ending in blood and gore because people like him, hunters, didn’t get a happy ending. This was more than Dean ever hoped for.
“Look, Dean, I wish I could help but you can’t seriously expect me to let you fix your car in my garage without paying,” the man argued back.
“It’s not your fault Jack; he did it to save you. He made sure to keep his promise to Kelly. I’ll see you around kid,” Dean said before turning on his heel and walking out the clearing. A few minutes later, he slid into Baby’s front seat. He turned the key and for the first time in his life, wasn’t comforted by the sound of the engine purring.
he shouted as he orgasmed.
“I love you, Daddy,” Jack said, giving Cas a quick hug before running into the living room.
“I saved Castiel’s mother when she was almost raped by some assholes in a bar when she came on land looking for a mate. She was hurt pretty badly because it was a gang who attacked her, so I brought her to Mary to help take care of her,” Bobby explained.
“Why am I friends with you?” Cas asked, shaking his head at Dean’s ridiculousness.
“There is, I was saving it for last. We’ve pretty much seen all the land animals. They do have a temporary swamp and grasslands exhibit set up with a few more animals to go look at if you want.”
He didn’t stop until he was outside a nondescript brown door. He knocked once in warning before barging in. The angel behind the desk looked up as Castiel came to a halt in front of his large mahogany desk.
Before knocking, Sam looked at his brother. “Do you think that would be wise? We’ve already told Ellen and Jo and the fewer people who know, the better.”
Benny started to speed up his thrusts when suddenly, “WHAT THE FUCK?”
Cas didn’t have to say anything. Dean knew how much Cas hated when he had to travel for business and was forced to stay away from their family. Dean hated it just as much. He would never ask Sam to travel so far away especially with the twins still being so young. It had taken him and Eileen three years to finally get pregnant and he wouldn’t pull Sam away from the joys of fatherhood.
After a few seconds, Cas finally responded. “I am fine. Do you have an idea about a project to do?”
The whole table seemed surprised to hear Dean admit the affection. He blushed under their scrutiny.
“Would you be willing to have a few interns? My high school offers some design and architecture classes and they can earn extra credits if they can find an internship outside of school. The company that used to work with the school went out of business. Maybe you and Sam could fill that spot,” Cas suggested.
“Please, he won’t be a problem,” Charlie said, waving her hand dismissively. “Is there anything I can get you while you and Dean hang out?”
“Alright, if you’re sure about paying the rent then who am I to say no? Be warned though, my place is kind of a mess right now,” Dean warned with a sigh.
“Sorry. It’s just been so long since I got to do stuff like that on Christmas Eve.” Dean paused. “Hell, Sam must have been around thirteen or fourteen. I didn’t realize how much I missed it.”
“I’m good. I must say it is a surprise to meet someone who knows sign language,” the woman signed.
“Yeah Cas it does,” Dean replied with a grin. “So, my favorite topic in Greek mythology is the gods and goddesses. What about you?”
He headed out to meet Sam in the garage. They loaded their stuff up in Baby’s trunk before sliding into the front seat. Dean pulled the tape out of his pocket and pushed it into the tape slot. If Sam noticed what was written on the tape, he didn’t say anything. Dean turned the car on and pulled her out of the garage.
“I wanted to look through your jackets and see if I can’t find a new one for Jo. Her favorite jean jacket is on its last leg,” Dean explained.
Dean flashed a smile in Cas’ direction. “I would enter your dreams and protect you from your nightmares if you would just let me in. I would slay whatever beast that frightens you if only you would dream of me.”
I can’t wait to grow old and gray with you. I look forward to when we’re senile old men who sit on our porch and complain about our aching hips and backs. One day, when our bodies have grown weary of this life, we will leave this earth and travel to an eternal paradise, and I’ll be right there with you. From this day on, our souls will be bound, and I will never leave you alone again. I love you to the stars and beyond.”
“But I remember the taste of it! Just give me a sip, and I will tell you whatever you want to know,” the skull cried out in frustration.
They both nodded.
Cas wrenched himself out of Dean’s arms and flung himself off the back of the boat knowing if they shared one more kiss or one more touch, he would be unable to leave. He let the transformation consume him until he was a siren again. He wanted to swim back up to the water’s surface and give one final farewell to Dean, but he knew he couldn’t. If he did, he would never leave Dean a second time. He forced his tail to propel him forward, away from Dean and towards his clan. He felt his heart shattering into thousands of pieces as he swam.
The Red Bull had stopped and was sniffing at something lying in front of him. He swung his great head side to side, searching for the unicorn that had been there only moments ago. The Bull roared his displeasure at losing his prey before slowly walking back towards the castle, disappearing before he ever reached the black fortress.
Dean hurried to take a shower and get dressed. He managed to drink a couple cups of coffee before racing out the door. He was glad by the time he arrived at the park, the caffeine had kicked in and he finally felt awake. He looked around and spotted Cas sitting by the edge of the water. Even dressed in washed out jeans and a simple t-shirt, Dean thought Cas was stunning. He hurried over and was glad that Cas flashed him a smile as he walked up.
Dean slid his nose against Cas’ and pressed another chaste kiss to the man’s lips.
“It’s alright Dean. How about you fix something for dinner while I get these cleaned up,” he asked with a small smile.
Five minutes later, Dean was in his wetsuit and scuba gear while Cas was completely naked. Cas pecked Dean on the lips before diving into the water, letting his legs turn into a tail. He resurfaced and swam to the back of the boat. Dean slid his mask over his face and double checked all of his gear before stepping off the boat and into the cold water.
Castiel longed for something more. He wanted to be desired and cherished for who he was, not what he had to offer. He knew it was likely a pointless wish though. His song would ensure a mate, but it couldn’t make the person love him. Sirens didn’t have the ability to speak like the humans did and so Cas would never be able to convince a human to fall in love with him. No declarations of affection or endearment would ever pass his lips.
Dean quickly poured coffee, cream, and sugar into the mug and then took a long gulp of the steaming hot liquid. He smiled in contentment as the coffee slid down his throat, the warmth spreading throughout his entire body. He took another sip before grabbing his toast and spreading butter and jelly on it. Dean had his mug in one hand and his plate in the other and walked to the living room. He took a seat in his recliner and turned the TV on for background noise.
Cas grit his teeth. “What do you want, Michael? I’m tired and wish to go to sleep.”
“Let her show us her tricks,” Eileen insisted.
Once the song was done, Mary moved off the floor and took a seat next to John. Dean started to follow but was stopped by Cas. “Hold on; there’s one more special dance.”
Cas trailed gentle fingers down Dean’s sweaty back all the way down to his rim. He ran his finger around Dean’s entrance and pushed the leaking cum back into his hole. He smirked as he felt Dean clench around his fingers.
Sam wasn’t what Cas was expecting either. Sam was a six-foot-two pile of gangly limbs and overenthusiasm. He had tripped in his eagerness to meet Cas and had sent the beer Bobby held in his hands flying. Like Ellen, Sam had wrapped Cas in a bone-crunching hug and then grabbed Dean in a headlock and given his brother a noogie. Afterward, he had picked Jack up, plopped him on his shoulders, and had walked around the house pretending to be a horse. And Cas had thought his own brother a handful. Cas’ biggest complaint about Gabe was his ridiculous love of all things sweet, especially candy.
“If you’re going to ask to work on your own, the answer is no,” she said before Dean could continue.
Cas felt his wings flare in anger. “What does it matter to you, Michael? Why do you care what I’ve done? Ever since I made my choice, you have done nothing but taunt me! If I have disappointed you and disgust you, then why are you so concerned with me?”
Cas rolled his eyes.
“We have our gear already loaded on the boat. Where are we going anyways?” Dean asked as he glowered at the older man.
The smile fell from the magician’s face at the unicorn’s words. “Oh, well, I’m honored you came back for me then.”
“Alright, don’t have to tell me twice. Yeah, I’m almost done with it though and I should have it finished before I go to bed. Did you guys want to do anything tomorrow?”
He walked out the park and headed towards one of the seedier parts of town. He knew exactly where he was going, watching over humanity for thousands of years had its perks. He stopped outside a nondescript building and knocked on the door. He could hear footsteps from inside as he waited for the door to be opened.
Dean felt his heart shatter even more than what it already had. Tears clogged his voice as he whispered, “I’m sorry Cas.” He watched without remorse as Chuck’s eyes widened right before Dean pulled the trigger of the gun.
The first sob broke the dam as Dean’s entire body was wracked with painful spasms as he felt his heart shatter in his chest. His entire life, he had tried to do the right thing. He had done his best to take care of Sam and protect him. He had tried to protect his mom and Bobby and Charlie and Jack and Jody and Donna and the whole damn world! He had never asked for anything in return, never wanted it. He knew he didn’t deserve it because as many good things as he had done, he had done twice as many bad. He had failed Sam, causing his brother to be killed, to be sent to the Cage, to become souless, to be taken over by an angel. It wasn’t just Sam Dean had failed, it was every person Dean had known. Mary, Bobby, Benny, Charlie, Kevin, Ellen, Jo, Rowena, they had all died either for or because of him. He had always known he was a monster just like the monsters he hunted. His entire life he had been filled with rage and anger, choosing to lash out at those he loved instead of letting them help him. Dean didn’t deserve anything, especially someone’s love.
“I told Papa that we have to get him presents for Christmas, and one of them has to be a matching sock monkey hat like ours,” Jack said.
“So, is that how your brother handles everything? Run away and refuse to talk about it,” Gabe said coldly.
“Morning, jerk. I’m surprised you’re up. Figured I was going to have to drag your ass out of bed,” Sam joked as he walked inside the room, his hands laden with take-out bags and coffee cups. He dropped the bags and cups on the table and pulled Dean into a tight hug. “How are you doing, getting cold feet yet?”
Cas made sure to turn his body so that he landed on the ground with the human on top of him. He rested a few minutes, trying to catch his breath before grabbing the man under the arms and hauling him backwards until he could lean him against the cave wall. Castiel was growing concerned as the man’s skin was ice cold to the touch. He needed to warm the man up or else he would be dead within the hour.
Sirens had the ability to move between the land and sea at will. The transition was painful the first few times, but after a half dozen transitions, turning into a human was as easy as breathing. Sirens typically only went to land to find a human male to procreate with before returning to the sea permanently. His kind was feared among the humans for having hypnotizing songs that brought sailors to their doom, but only part of that was true. They did have magical songs, but the purpose wasn’t to lure a human to their death, it was to entice them into their bed. They used their songs to hypnotize their chosen suitor to ensure that there was a successful mating between the pair.
Dean looked at Cas quizzically. “There’s a certain gift I have to open first?”
Thanks to Cas, Dean reunites with an old friend. After realizing he is in love with Cas, Dean plans a special date night for the two of them inspired by one of Cas' favorite movies. Then, a short simple epilogue.
“I just ate a little bit ago, but I would love to accompany you to lunch. It has been awhile since I’ve had the chance to converse with a friend,” Cas said, accepting the offer.
Mary rested her hand against Dean’s cheek and stared at her son. “You’re not my little boy anymore.”
Gilda chuckled, a light and airy sound. “Apparently, you’ve already made Dean happier than he has been in months. She also thinks Jack is the most precious thing in the world and has offered to babysit him whenever you need it.”
Cas did as instructed and gagged as the liquid touched his tongue. He barely managed to not spit it out, swallowing it with a disgusted look on his face. The people around him smiled and chuckled at his antics.
They pulled into the parking lot of the Roadhouse and Dean put Baby in park. He turned to look at Cas and couldn’t help but reach out and stroke his cheek with his thumb. Cas looked at him softly. “I love you baby so freaking much. When I’m working or staying at the business late, just know that I only think of you and Jack and Claire. I promise once the school and the restaurants are done, things should slow back down for a little bit. When we go to Louisiana, I’m gonna meet with Benny for three days. The rest of the time will be spent with my wonderful little family who I love to pieces.”
“Ahh, c’mon, can’t I relax it for just this night?” Dean whined.
Cas’ lips turned up at one corner. “You’re right, but you are one of the most gorgeous sights I’ve ever laid eyes on. The painters of the Renaissance would have died to have a model of your grandeur.”
“Dean, I’m sorry if I freaked you out earlier with the mistletoe. If I had known you were uncomfortable with it, I wouldn’t have insisted on us doing it,” Cas said in a quiet voice.
“And over here is Fenrir, the wolf son of the Norse god Loki. It is said he will kill Odin himself before being killed by one of Odin’s sons,” Crowley’s voice echoed.
The road that he traveled on was long and without end. It was stiff beneath his hooves, and he longed for the feel of his forest beneath his feet. The road passed through villages and towns, pulling him along without rest. His mouth was always dry while his coat and mane were thick with dust. He didn’t know how long he traveled, never needing to track time before. What he did know is that the landscape around him slowly changed. It went from an array of reds, yellows, and oranges to a pristine white. The snow eventually melted, and spring came back to the land, a season he was well acquainted with. But then the lang grew hot and arid before turning orange once more.
Cas dragged his fingers down Dean’s cheek and swiped them against the other man’s mouth. “We’ve changed each other, mostly for the better, it seems.”
Cas chuckled. “I love you to infinity and beyond.”
“I think she loved me in her own way. She actually came back to land after I was born to tell Mary and Bobby about me. When she got to Mary’s house, she saw Mary, John, and baby you from the window. She said I had the same look in my eye when I talked about you that Mary and John had in theirs when they looked at you. We both knew I wouldn’t go with the clan when they left this area just like we both knew I sucked at being a siren. Here on land is where I finally feel at home. Being with you, Dean, is home for me,” Cas said, a gummy smile spreading across his face.
Benny stood to his feet and shook his hand, eying Cas with caution. “Nice to meet you and I hope it was all good things brother.”
Cas grabbed a dishtowel and quickly wiped up the water before it could drip onto the floor. “It’s ok, monkey. Nothing that can’t be cleaned up,” Cas said, ruffling Jack’s hair. He handed Jack the whisk. “Here, mix the batter so that we can get these pancakes on the griddle. I heard a little boy is hungry and really wants these for breakfast.”
“Cas didn’t find me on the beach. He rescued me when I fell overboard,” Dean started to explain.
Dean complimented with a kiss to his boyfriend’s cheek.
Dean gasped as Cas pulled him closer to his body, wrapping his arms around Dean’s back and waist. Dean buried his head in the junction between Cas’ neck and shoulder. He flinched when Cas ran a soft hand through his short hair. “You dumbass,” Cas said, tears evident in his own voice.
Cas had thought living with Dean would be difficult or take some getting used to, but Dean turned out to be the easiest person to live with. Dean was always willing to help with chores around the house, play with Jack so Cas could work on his manuscript, and he even helped out around the bookstore. Dean took over most of the cooking since it was a favorite hobby, and he loved being able to provide for his family. Dean’s biggest fault: his procrastination of doing laundry. Since Dean did the cooking, Cas had willingly agreed to take care of the laundry.
Cas leaned his forehead against Dean’s and looked into the sparkling green eyes he loved so much. He would never doubt Dean’s feelings for him, for Dean’s eyes were a window to his soul, and Cas saw nothing but love swirling in the green depths. “I adore you with all of my heart,” Cas said softly.
“Just answer the question.”
“The transition from angel grace to human soul is tremendous. You know the answer to your question Castiel,” Michael replied.
“You’re welcome Dean. My house is right up here on the right,” he pointed out a medium sized house on the corner.
Cas frowned and then realized something. He stuck two fingers in his mouth and sucked on them until he pulled them away, soaked in his saliva. He held his slick fingers in front of Dean. “We have all the supplies we need. Please Dean,” Cas begged with a puppy dog face.
Cas sighed heavily. “Please Dean, don’t make this harder than what it already is. We both know this isn’t real! You were trapped by a djinn and this world is what your brain made up after being injected with their poison.”
“Cas,” Dean hollered, the volcano erupting inside of him. His cock spewed ropes of semen, coating his stomach and Cas’ hand. His body spasmed, his hole tightening around Cas’ shaft as the orgasm raced through him. His body shuddered a few times before he collapsed against his fiancé’s chest.
“Cool. What’s your something blue?”
Dean gasped.
Dean reached out and gently lifted Cas’ chin. “I think I can remedy that. My name is Dean Winchester. I'm an Aquarius; I enjoy sunsets, long walks in the snow, and cute brunettes with gorgeous blue eyes.”
Dean leaned closer until their foreheads were touching and their lips were centimeters apart. “Say it again. Please, say it again.”
Cas sat his beer down and tilted his head in confusion. “Yes, there’s a queen-sized bed in, uh, his room, but we figured you would prefer your own mattress.”
Dean slowly spun them and said, “I guess it’s a sign from above.”
“I’m ok. I enjoy working at the diner and Dean’s apartment is coming along nicely.” Cas answered.
Cas replied snarkily.
Cas groaned.
“The lasagna should be about done. Cas, have you ever had lasagna before?” Mary asked as she stood up to check on the food.
Dean started to retort but was cut off by a low, “Hello Dean. Hello Sam. What a coincidence to run into you here.”
Cas didn’t sound like he was in pain which Dean was glad for.
In the next moment, he was jerking away, shock apparent in his eyes. “Cas, what the hell man,” he exclaimed.
“I checked the cameras, Alistair. There’s nothing there,” Bobby replied flatly.
With a cry, Castiel fell to the ground. The Bull sprinted past Sam, Eileen, and Meg and came to a halt right before Castiel. He sniffed at the prone body and bellowed, causing rocks to crumble and fall from the ceiling.
“You created a different tail for yourself?” Cas asked in astonishment.
Mary leaned back and cupped her son’s cheek. “Oh sweetheart, we miss you too, but everything worked out in the end. You and Cas are together, and from what Sam said, he has a girlfriend and a dog.”
Meg held her chin in her hand as she thought. She finally let out a heavy sigh before answering, “Truthfully, I have heard so much about the Red Bull that none of it can possibly be true. For every story I’ve heard, there is another one that contradicts it. I heard that the Bull is real, but another story said the Bull is a ghost. One story said the Bull was created by a witch’s spell, while another says King Winchester himself is the Bull. I’ve heard that the Bull has always inhabited this land, and I’ve also heard that the Bull followed Winchester here. Some say the Bull protects the king, and others say that the Bull keeps him prisoner in his own castle. So, you see, I know nothing about the Bull. I’m sorry, my friend.”
Meg jumped back, and even Castiel looked up when the skull let loose a mocking laugh. “Oh, I could speak from before you even cast the first spell, but it was amusing to watch you. You are the most bumbling magician my eye sockets have ever seen.”
Dean stepped back, glaring at the angel. “Why are you saying that? Did I do something wrong? If you’re mad at me, just tell me, don’t make up some ridiculous lie!”
Dean sat back as he stared at the other man disbelievingly. He reached back out and touched the tail,
“What do you mean?” Cas asked, his eyes squinting.
Dean’s mouth gaped open as he gazed at the exquisite beauty in front of him. Cas was wearing the blue lingerie set they had bought at the mall. The silk cami covering his chest and stomach clung to him, just enough material to stretch across his frame. He dragged his eyes down Cas’ body coming to rest at the man’s groin. The panties hugged his hips, his cock stretching the silk to its max.
Mary let out a sob as she pulled him into a tight hug. “I’ve missed you so much! Welcome home, Sweetheart.”
“Alright, thanks. I’ll see you in a few hours,” Jody replied before hanging up.
Dean was leaning away from him, doing his best to keep his eyes averted. His lips were a deep red from biting on them. He reached out and gently pushed Cas’ hand into his lap and pulled his skirt down, covering his cock.
Dean cupped the unicorn’s cheek and whispered, “Cas.”
The king laughed and then spoke in a childlike voice, full of wonder and awe. “There they are! There they are! Try and tell me they are not your people or that you didn’t come to my castle searching for them. Say you stayed in my castle for love, but I know it will be a lie.” He continued to stare at the waves, color seeping into his cheeks and his eyes sparkling. For the first time since arriving, Castiel saw a smile on the king’s face. “They are mine! The Red Bull gathered them from all over the land and drove them toward my castle and into the sea. They belong to me! The sea is their cage, for what better place could hold a unicorn prisoner? The Red Bull guards them night and day, and they dare not defy him. He destroyed their fighting spirit many years ago. Their home is now the sea, and every tide brings them within stepping distance of land, but they don’t dare to leave the water. They are afraid of the Red Bull and thus remain in the ocean waters for me to watch.”
While the two tussled, the unicorn walked to the cage where the chimera lay. The lion looked at the unicorn as it placed its horn to the lock. There was a bright blue glow, and the lock fell to the ground, the cage door swinging open. The lion got to its feet and sluggishly exited the cage. It stared at the unicorn and dipped its head ever so slightly before running into the shadows. The unicorn did the same for the rest of the poor creatures who were locked away. As the beasts stepped from their cages, the enchantments on them slipped away. The ape ran into the bushes, the eagle took to the sky, the snake slithered along the ground, the lizard scurried away, and the wolf bounded into the trees. The unicorn watched them for a second before making his way to the only unlocked cage.
Castiel stepped back, pressure building behind the mark on his forehead. He closed his eyes as a vision flashed behind them. Castiel stood on four legs that ended in cloven hooves. His coat was like rich obsidian, a silky mane tumbled down his neck, and a long, thin horn spiraled from the center of his forehead. The vision disappeared as quickly as it came, but it left Castiel gasping for air.
“Did you know Bobby would be here tonight?” Dean asked.
The unicorn threw his head high up in the air. “A horse! Is that all you take me for? Is that all you see?”
Sam jumped, “Holy shit, you really can talk with your mind. That’s crazy!”
He turned his attention to his beer bottle, picking at the label nervously. He had spent most of the day thinking about what he was going to do about Cas. He liked Cas… a lot and he wasn’t afraid to admit that. He was just afraid of how people would react about it. He knew Sam was right and that his family and friends wouldn’t care but no matter what, John’s voice always echoed in his head.
Cas stood to his feet and stormed out of the apartment. He hoped going on a walk might help to clear his mind. He wandered aimlessly down the street, barely paying attention to where he was going. He wasn’t surprised when his feet led him back to the statue of himself that Mary had carved. He took a seat on the wall and stared at the statue.
He started to walk off, but Meg grabbed his wrist. “You’re not going anywhere. I’m doing this for you! Maybe you are right, though. Getting the skull to speak might be enough.”
He grabbed her hand before she could walk away. “Thank you, Ellen, for always being there for me and Sam.”
“Thanks, Jody, and thanks for officiating. It was great,” Dean replied.
Dean backed up, his head shaking violently. “No, Cas. I won’t let you give that up for me! You’re a siren; you belong in the ocean.”
“You’re all of that for me too,” Dean replied before pulling Cas into another kiss.
Dean looked over his shoulder. “I just want to look nice for Cas, so bite me.”
“It’s ok. If Cas is touching you, he can communicate telepathically. Otherwise, he’s nearly as mute as I am,” Dean explained.
Cas replied with a shrug.
Dean had just stuck some frozen hamburger meat in the microwave to defrost and was pulling a countertop grill out of a cabinet. He looked over his shoulder and his eyes suddenly shone with happiness.
Jack studied the mark carefully. “Daddy said the book is because he loves to read. So that means the pie is for you. Do you love pie, Mr. Dean?”
Dean looked at Cas’ list and was surprised at how many options on the list he checked off. Out of twenty-five topics, Cas checked off twenty-one. The four that he didn’t check were all the ones Dean had checked on his own list. There was only one choice they had in common: Greek Mythology. “Well, it seems we only have one item in common and that’s Greek mythology. Do you want to do that one since we both checked it off?”
Cas shook his head, amazed by how ingenious his son could be. He ruffled Jack’s hair and said, “When did my little boy get so smart? I think that’s a great idea!”
“Well, yeah, he kind of lives here. Our father managed to trap him a long time ago, and he has never left. Do you know of the Bull?” Dean asked.
Eileen grabbed the vegetables and dropped them in the pot. She stirred the mixture, a contemplative look on her face. Finally, she looked at Dean and said. “Well, I think you should stop killing dragons for one. If Castiel hasn’t been impressed with six dragons, I don’t think he will be impressed by them at all. You should try something else, Your Highness.”
Cas chuckled, his teeth showing and his eyes and nose scrunching up. “I’m putting it on; I’m putting it on.”
Dean said, trailing a finger down Cas’ temple until he could cup his cheek.
Dean squeezed Cas’ hand, and they started walking towards the shop. “There’s nothing wrong with that. As a teacher, I love to read and make sure to read to my kiddos every day. They love all the funny voices I do.”
Cas and Jack spent the next few hours strolling from store to store, purchasing gifts for their friends and family. Every check-out clerk found Jack adorable and had no problem wrapping the gift he picked out for Cas before they let his dad pay for it. Cas even managed to get a few presents for Jack without the boy seeing them. When they finally headed back to the car, their arms were laden with bags, and Cas’ wallet was quite a bit lighter.
“Well, yes and no. You see, your Dean is human. If you want to make him a siren like you, then there is nothing I can do. Sirens have magic running through their veins, that’s what gives you your song. I cannot create magic and therefore cannot turn Dean into a siren,” the witch described.
Dean nodded and started walking towards his office. All the events of the last few hours came crashing down around him with every step. When he finally stumbled into Bobby’s office, tears were falling again, and he could barely stand. He sat in a chair before burying his face in his hands.
Cas pushed Dean’s clothes further down until they fell down his legs and pooled at his feet. He then repeated the process with the sweats around his own hips. He smiled as he watched Dean’s eyes zero in on his own erection. Dean reached out and hovered his hand over the flesh.
Dean repeated the question to Ellen and she eagerly agreed. They spent the rest of the afternoon teaching Cas the basics of sign language. By the time the night crew and Sam arrived, Cas knew the entire alphabet, numbers up to twenty, and some basic words. Dean would continue to work with him, and Ellen told them to come back on her next day off.
“Ugh, we don’t have time for this! I’m trying to help you regain your true self, so maybe you would like to help as well,” Meg growled.
Dean turned when he heard shouting to his left. He saw Bobby and Alistair standing by the tank. Bobby had his arms crossed and seemed unimpressed. Alistair’s face was a bright red as he shouted at the older man. Dean walked over and they both looked at him.
Jack finally pulled away, wiping at his eyes. “Now that dinner is done, what do we do now?”
Cas let his book fall closed before looking at Dean. “I’ll be fine. I am a grown adult.”
“It wasn’t really a what but a who that made me break up with Benny.” Dean’s voice was low and soft as he continued to play with the label on his beer. “My dad caught us.”
“You gotta warn somebody next time. I totally didn’t need to see you naked,” the younger Winchester complained.
Meg could see the conviction burning in Dean’s eyes, but she knew that Dean’s feelings towards Castiel didn’t matter. “It’s a nice sentiment, Dean, but it can’t last. I hope to turn him back to his true self so that he might face the Red Bull and free his kind. Once he’s a unicorn again… well, you’ll just be a distant memory.”
Cas’ head tilted and his eyes scrunched up. “Dean, what are you saying?”
“Everything dies,” Cas cried. He leaned his forehead against Dean’s and looked into his eyes. “I want to have a life with you and die when you die. Do not let her turn me back. I don’t want to be a unicorn, to be magical and immortal. I’m human, and I love you.” Cas pressed his lips to Dean’s, pouring all of his emotions into the kiss.
“You said a skull and a clock? Both are located in the main hall, but the skull has never spoken, and that clock rings when it wants. As for wine, I haven’t seen any in this castle all the time I’ve been here.” Eileen knew Charlie was growing bored with her and would soon fall silent. “Answer me one last question. Do you know where the unicorns are?”
“Look around you. Take a look at your fellow legends, and tell me what you see,” the magician said, a smirk on her face.
Sam crossed his arms and frowned at Dean. “You winked at him and started off the entire conversation with a cheesy pick up line. You took your long sleeve shirt off and totally flexed your muscles. You smiled at him like a dozen times. You touched him just as many times on the shoulder and the arm and one time you brushed your knuckles across his cheek. Oh, and I’m pretty sure for half of the conversation you guys were undressing and fucking one another just with your eyes.”
Jack tilted his head. “Every human. What about Cas?”
Cas shifted to scan across the writhing bodies before pointing to a short man with long golden hair in the middle of the floor grinding between a guy and girl. “My brother Gabriel is the short man with the long blonde hair underneath the disco ball. It seems he is enjoying himself without me. I wish I could leave but he’s my ride home.”
“I was, uh, sent to you,” Cas lied.
“Hey, Baby, did you miss me,” Dean said to his classic nineteen sixty-seven Chevy Impala. He turned her on to warm up while he opened the garage door and shoveled quite a bit of snow away from the driveway. Once Dean had a path cleared, he hurried to get in Baby, sighing in contentment at the toasty warmth of the car’s interior. After a few minutes, Dean’s fingers regained their warmth, no longer feeling like frozen popsicles. He backed Baby out of the garage, shut the garage door, and headed to town.
Sam grinned. “If Dean’s life wasn’t at stake, I’d be busting a gut right now because you’re so right. Now go, find him, and bring him back.”
“Oh really? Well, try and go through this,” Alistair said as he pulled a gun out.
Dean’s heart broke at seeing how sad his boyfriend looked. He glared before coming to a decision.
“Alright, you two, quit making out and get to eating. Everybody is dying to see your guys’ first dance,” Sam called, settling next to Dean.
“Why not? Nothing else to do. I’ll take the living room and the bathroom. You fine with the kitchen and bedroom? I don’t really use the spare bedroom except for storage. We will have to clean it up for you to use once we are done with making our lists.” Dean got up and grabbed paper and pen as he talked.
Cas’ hand came to rest atop Dean’s. “Dean, I don’t know what to say.”
Castiel’s shoulders slumped. He didn’t know how to write out all the words he would need for a full explanation. He thought for a few seconds before gesturing for the stick. He tried to explain to the best of his ability what had happened. When he was finished, he pointed to the sand for Dean to read:
Meg quickly grabbed Dean’s size and walked behind the checkout counter. “Alright, I will have to ring your boots up separately from Jo’s to be able to use the discount. Is there any more shopping you have to do, or are you ready to check out?”
“Did you know this?”
“I’m so proud of you, son. It’s good to see you so happy. Can’t say I saw that very often when I was alive,” John said.
It was as if Cas didn’t even hear Dean as he kept on drawing. They sat in silence for a few minutes and when Cas clapped his hands again, Dean barely kept his anger under control. “Did you not hear me? I asked you to stop with the clapping!”
he replied with a sheepish smile.
“Wait until mom meets you. She’ll care for you more than you will ever want.”
Dean couldn’t look up from Cas’ panties where a large wet spot was already darkening the light blue silk.
Sam frowned at his brother. “Dude, how many times do I have to tell you not to talk when you have food in your mouth?” Dean just grabbed another piece and shoved it in his mouth.
The unicorn and Meg turned their heads to watch Eileen walk out of the trees, her clothes ripped in places and a few twigs stuck in her hair. One side of her mouth was curved upward as she walked towards them, her eyes trained on Meg. As soon as Eileen lifted her gaze to the unicorn, she stopped in her tracks. Her eyes filled with fat tears, and her hands trembled as she took a step closer. She stared at the unicorn with a mixture of awe and belligerence.
Right now, he had to agree with his father. “Angels are watching over you,” Dean scoffed as he glared at the statue. “Yeah, well if that’s true, you’re doing a pretty shit job at it buddy. My life is falling apart, and I don’t see you helping.”
She squealed and threw her arms around Dean’s neck. “Dee, that’s awesome! How long have you guys been dating? Why haven’t you brought him around before now?”
As Cas stared at Charlie, he was reminded of an eager puppy who just wanted to lick everything in sight. He relaxed his shoulders and felt the corners of his lips curve up. “It’s alright, I understand. I’m sure my brother will have a similar reaction when I tell him.”
The statue was as silent and uncaring as ever. Dean sat alone for another ten minutes before hauling himself to his feet. He grabbed the empty beer bottles, gave a two-finger salute to the angel, and headed home. Had he looked back, he might have been able to see the shadow of a man that was standing in front of the statue watching as his charge staggered away.
Cas didn’t even jump when the Impala’s engine roared to life. Dean noticed that he seemed to be too caught in his mind. He pulled their joined hands up to rub against his cheek. It brought Cas out of his reprieve.
Cas chose not to answer instead leaning forward to take one of Dean’s nipples in his mouth. Dean moaned as the bud was enveloped in the heat of Cas’ mouth. His hands wrapped in black locks and pulled as Cas sucked tighter. His mouth dropped open in pleasure as Cas switched to the other nipple and laved at it until it was also a tight bud.
Dean felt his boyfriend tense next to him in fear. He backed up and tried to hide behind Dean’s taller frame. Dean glared at the woman in front of him. “Ellen, quit yelling at him. He really wanted to but…”
Sam shook his head, his lips curved in a scowl. “It doesn’t matter. I don’t care if he was our family. He should have never done that to you.”
Dean’s eyes snapped open. “You mean?”
Castiel opened the door. “Yes Dean. Let’s go.”
“Yeah, that’s kind of how it is in a place like this. So, where’s your brother at anyways,” Sam asked over the roar of the crowd.
Dean didn’t reply, instead walking towards the institute, dragging Cas behind him. They used the employee entrance and Dean started walking down a series of hallways that Cas could never hope to memorize. They came to a stop outside of a closed door and Dean knocked on it.
Sam scratched at the back of his neck, refusing to look at his brother. “Um…well, you see…actually…I’m not going to KU. I just got my acceptance letter from Stanford and they are giving me a full ride, everything covered. I won’t have to pay a single cent.”
While Cas waited for the milk to boil, he checked his Facebook, the only type of social media he had. His feed was primarily pictures and videos of cats, bees, and other animals. Cas had thought about getting a cat once he and Jack were better settled in. He knew Jack would love the idea, the avid animal lover he was.
she admitted.
Dean jerked awake at the sudden noise. He fumbled to turn the bedside lamp on but finally managed to smash the button. He blinked at the bright light and had to turn away. His whole body stilled when his eyes landed on the other figure in the room. He could do nothing but stare disbelievingly at the man in front of him. “What the hell are you? Some shapeshifter?”
Meg glanced at the unicorn who was still running from the Bull. “It is not magic that will save a unicorn but a hero. That’s what heroes are for.”
“Every human my father made disappear we can bring back with the snap of our fingers,” Michael confirmed.
“Of course, dad, I promise it won’t happen again,” Dean replied, feeling like a child.
“If someone only appreciated you for your looks, they wouldn’t deserve you baby. You should be with someone who loves your personality and sees your looks as a bonus,” Dean growled.
Dean scooted into the middle of the bed once he was bare and shivered as Cas crawled over him. They kissed some more, their erections sliding against each other and dribbling precum on their bare stomachs. They didn’t feel the need to rush anything, wanting to enjoy the moment to its fullest.
“Merry Christmas, Gabe. Have you already broken into your candy stash? You’re awful cheery for it being so early,” Cas said, standing to his feet and stretching.
“They’re great. At least they’re more comfortable than the suits we used to wear on cases,” Dean said.
Dean reached his hands towards Cas who quickly took it. “I’ve imagined, but I didn’t think it possible. I didn’t think I got to be happy. Now that I have it, I’m not wasting it. Now, make love to me angel.”
Cas smirked. “We just spent the entire day in bed ravishing each other. You can take a break for a few hours to enjoy the party that our friends and family have thrown for us in celebration of being married for five years.”
Mary placed a tender kiss to his forehead. “Night my sweet boy. I love you too. Remember, angels are watching over you.”
“Well, I wouldn’t want their business anyways if that’s what they thought of you. Dean, the people who matter will be the ones who support you and love you. If someone doesn’t support you then they don’t matter. There are gonna be people who won’t like you because you’re.. bi but then again there are people who don’t like you anyways. Like Lisa, she hates you because you broke up with her,” Sam said, trying to lighten the conversation.
Castiel sighed, and it sounded like the wind blowing through the trees. “Maybe, but I’m not sure. I’m very confused right now.”
Benny snorted. “He’ll always be your angel.” With that, Benny walked away.
Dean started choking on his sandwich and grabbed for his beer bottle. He took a long swallow before placing the bottle back on the table. The two men stared at him in confusion.
She nodded, “Ok. That’s all I need then. Be back here at five tomorrow with five hundred and you’ll have a brand-new life waiting for you.”
Meg eyed the brothers’ father suspiciously. Her eyes narrowed as she spoke, “I will tell my reason but only to the king himself. Why would I tell a few sentinels my royal business?”
Dean’s eyes lit up. “That’s it! What if we made a book on the gods and goddesses? You can do the artwork and I could come up with a story? My drawing sucks, but my writing is pretty great.”
When he reached Dean’s cock, he let his mouth hover over the flushed head. His eyes flicked up to Dean. The hunter’s eyes were closed, and his bottom lip was sucked in between his teeth. His hands were formed into tight fists, the bed cover clenched between them. “Look at me sweet one,” Cas ordered.
“I would have respected him. I would have respected the amount of money I could have made off of him,” he said before laughing maniacally.
“It’s absolutely ok to think of me as mom,” she cried as she pulled him in for another hug.
The woman leaned forward so she could make sure Jack could see her. “Nice to meet you, Jack. I’m Eileen. What can I do for you and your Daddy?”
“He and Eileen are going camping for a week so I can eat however I want,” Dean smirked.
They paid for their tickets and walked through the entrance. Dean grabbed a map and headed towards a vacant table so that they could plan their day. Once he had their route prepared, he walked over to Cas who was watching koi fish in a nearby pond.
Cas replied as he grabbed Dean’s hand and pulled him along behind him.
“He said it first, so I said it back to him. It wasn’t anything special. He said it one day after practice when we were at home studying. Dad and mom were at work and you were at a friend’s house,” Dean explained.
“You’re the magician; surely you can make a skull speak,” Cas replied.
“What? What do you mean you know?” Meg demanded. She gestured at Castiel, who still stared straight ahead. “How could you know what he is when he himself can’t even remember? Even before you caught his fancy, he was already forgetting who he was. Now, he has fallen so deep for you that I’m not sure if even the strongest magic could turn him back.”
“Moonshine, look at me,” Dean said in a voice rough from over a decade of being unused. When Cas locked eyes with him, he continued to speak. “How could you possibly think I would be upset with such a gift? You’ve given me my voice back, Cas, and I will never be able to repay you for that. I love you so much, moonshine.”
The king’s eyes pinched together in frustration. As he stared into Castiel’s eyes, he didn’t see his own reflection as he did in his sons’ eyes or any other human’s. Instead, he saw a bright forest full of life. “Why can I not see myself in your eyes? They are full of leaves and streams and animals! They are not empty like every other human’s.”
“Ha,” barked the first rider. “Unicorns! They are just creatures of legend, not of actual flesh and blood.”
Dean reeled back as if slapped. He grabbed at the single chair to keep from falling to his knees. “No. No, that- that’s impossible. We can’t be.” He looked at Sam, begging his brother to tell him it was some cruel joke. Sam’s refusal to answer was answer enough.
“What can I do for you?” Dean mumbled under his breath.
She sighed, “I promise, neither Jo nor I will say anything.”
Dean gently slid off Cas’ lap and fell onto the blankets. “That was fudging awesome,” he said dopily, staring at Cas with a large smile.
The two men headed to their respected rooms with serious thoughts on their minds. Dean couldn’t believe his luck. For the past ten years, if it hadn’t been for bad luck, Dean would have had no luck at all. Now, out of the blue, a stranger in a trench coat had walked into his life and was offering him a silver platter. Cas was willing to help get Dean’s life back on track and he wanted desperately to do so. Cas must be an angel sent from Heaven.
Dean cuddled closer, dropping his head against Cas’ sternum and drawing lazy patterns against the tan skin. “So, have you ever been to one of the stars?”
“Yeah, I am. You’re Dean, right? Cas described you two and he said Sam was extremely tall with long brown hair. You’re tall but unless my brother has gone colorblind, your hair ain’t exactly brown,” the man said good naturedly, a broad smile lighting up his brown eyes.
Ellen was silent, thinking about what she wanted to say. She placed a hand on top of Dean’s getting him to look at her. “Honey, I know you and Benny dated for a while back in high school.”
Cas reached out to touch the back of Mary’s hand.
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean said softly, looping the necklace around his neck. He wrapped his fingers around it and held the pendant for a second before tucking it underneath the collar of his dress shirt.
“That is why I returned.” The unicorn answered although Meg wasn’t sure what he was implying. The unicorn was silent for a moment before adding, “You’re a true magician now. Are you finally happy?”
Meg was most surprised by the disappointment she saw in Eileen’s eyes. Had Eileen thought of her as something more than just some cheap entertainment? Anger and a desperate desire to please the woman suddenly filled Meg. She closed her eyes and reached for her magic deep inside her core. Meg held her hands out and whispered, “Magic, do as you will. Magic, do as you will.”
“Dean, you don’t have to say anything. I made my choice, and you had to save Sam. I didn’t fit into this world as a vampire. Maybe… maybe I can fit into it as a human,” Benny drawled.
Cas stood up straighter as he held his hand out to John. “Hello, Mr. Winchester. It’s nice to be formally introduced.”
“Whatever. Go to California if you want,” Dean said, his voice cold as he walked out the kitchen, shoving past Sam in the process.
He found his brother sitting in the living room. Sam looked up when he heard the footsteps. Before he could say anything, Dean started signing.
Dean continued to stare at the statue as he took another drag from his beer bottle. He glared at the angel who mocked him. Mary had designed him after the angel in her dreams and the statue was finished right after Dean’s first birthday and had stood in the park ever since. His father despised the angel, saying it was a painful reminder of what they had lost. Dean loved it for just the opposite reason. He felt it was the only thing left that allowed him to feel closer to his deceased mother.
A shy smile crossed his face and his eyes travelled to Dean.
Meg shrugged. “I think so, but do humans ever know when they are truly happy? And what about you? Are you happy?”
“What do you mean, like you’re best friends.” Sam replied with a chuckle.
“Yeah, so was my mom. She always used to say angels were watching over me. After she died, if any were, they tucked wing and flew away. My life has been a shit show ever since Cas,” he said, his shoulders slumped, and his hands tucked in his pockets.
He was surprised to see Castiel’s brother, Gabriel, standing in his driveway. He grabbed a rag to wipe his hands dry and then walked over to the man. He hadn’t realized how short the man was last night in the club. He was nearly half a foot shorter than Dean.
Dean reached out and gently grasped Cas’ trembling shoulders. “No more, Cas, no more!” The dream was becoming dark, and Dean no longer wished to know what it was. “Come back to me, Cas, leave that place of shadows and fear.”
The unicorn looked away, disgusted at how easily humans were fooled nowadays. He glanced at the cage to his left and froze. He felt fear travel down his spine and settle deep in his bones, weighing him down like a bag of stones. The creature he stared at was horrifying. The face was green and scaly, dozens of teeth poking out from the long jaws. At the base of the head, a large black mane erupted, covering the creature’s neck and flowing down its shoulders. The front half of the body was covered in short brown fur, and the two front legs ended in paws with sharp claws. The back half of the creature was gray and leathery with large stumps for legs. The beast hardly moved, staring at the unicorn with beady eyes.
“Shut up, bitch. When you become a teacher and have to deal with twenty screaming kids until a week before Christmas, then you can complain. It’s a miracle if I don’t come home and pass out on the couch after work. Little kids are exhausting,” Dean grumbled.
Dean sat there for a few seconds, trying to figure out how many years that would make Cas.
“I can’t control what you think Alistair. I’m just telling you what I know. Now, if you’ll excuse me, my friend and I are going diving. I’ll see you when I come back to work.” There was a finality to his hand movements and facial expression that not even the other man dared to argue with.
“Dean, he’s going to love it,” Sam said softly.
Dean’s shoulders slumped.
“We need to prioritize our shopping. Food is important but there are other important necessities such as toilet paper and shampoo. Why don’t we see how much of that kind of stuff we have and then we will worry about food,” Castiel explained.
Dean shook his head. “He would have eventually. Apparently, everyone but him knew. Dad’s been dead for years and I just recently came back out and pretty much everybody, but dad knew we were dating. They always wondered why you and I broke up and why I’ve only dated women since then.”
“They’re about what you said to me,” Dean said, cutting Cas off. “When… when you said… when you said you loved me.”
“Dean,” Sam said hesitantly. “Where’s Billie?”
Cas rubbed the lube between his fingers, making sure it was warm enough. He circled one lubed finger around Dean’s entrance, smiling as the muscles contracted. “So beautiful and all mine,” Cas whispered as he slid one finger past Dean’s rim.
“Ok buddy, I’m glad I can make touching you enjoyable.” A blush rose on Dean’s cheeks at his words. He pulled away from Cas, stuttering, “I’m so.. sorry. I did.. didn’t mean it like that.”
“Cas, hey, it’s alright. I understand needing to talk to someone. Sam and I have done quite a bit of talking ourselves this morning. I’m sorry for hurting you Cas,” Dean said softly, pain lacing his voice.
“Oh no, Dean would have chewed me out. You’ve got front seat privileges now man.”
“Hello Dean,” Castiel said. “I assure you I’m no shapeshifter. I am human, but I’m still me. Give me a silver blade, holy water, and anything else to help prove that I’m not a monster.”
“For a high school teacher, you have an amazing body,” Dean remarked in awe.
One finger quickly became two which turned into three and before Dean realized it, Benny’s condom covered cock was sliding into him. His nails raked against Benny’s tanned back as his channel was stretched wider than his boyfriend’s three fingers.
Michael chuckled as he walked around and leaned against the desk, crossing his ankles. “It’s not an opinion Castiel, it’s fact. I’ve never seen you so flustered and concerned for one of your charges. Tell me, what about this human is different?”
“You see, your daddy and I had been trying an awfully long time to have a little baby of our own and we were both feeling really sad when we went to sleep one night. After I fell asleep, I was visited by an angel in my dreams.”
Dean tried to say something, but his brain seemed to have short-circuited, and he couldn’t even open his mouth. Dean could feel the heat on his cheeks from his growing embarrassment, and he dropped his gaze, realizing that he was still holding the guy’s hand. His eyes were drawn to the soulmate mark on the man’s wrist. He could only see part of it, but the part he could see was extremely familiar. Without being too suspicious, Dean slid his thumb against the sleeve of the guy’s trench coat, pushing it back and exposing his soulmate mark completely.
Meg pulled her arm from Eileen’s grasp and marched forward. She shouted as loud as she could. “RUN, RUN AWAY NOW!” The unicorn looked at her, and his eyes were empty, devoid of the light that always made them sparkle.
Dean smiled softly as he ran his fingers through Cas' hair.
Dean started signing, but Cas paid no attention to the words as he grabbed both of Dean’s hands in his. He looked at Cas in confusion. “Say my name, Dean,” he insisted.
Jack didn’t have words, so he hugged Dean even tighter. When they pulled apart, Dean wiped the last of the tears from his eyes. “Alright, we gotta get this place cleaned up.”
Dean walked inside, a bell ringing above his head. As expected, the walls were lined with books, and the left side of the store had shelves filled with books running the entire length of the shop. On the right side of the store were tables advertising new arrivals and any specials the store was running. There were a few comfy chairs and beanbags for patrons to sit on and read if they wished in the back corner. Near the front of the store, next to the checkout counter, there were a few racks with bookmarks, pens and pencils, and other small items.
Dean gave a small shake of his head. He went to reach for his keys when he realized one very important fact. Since he was still holding Cas’ hand, the man heard his thoughts.
“Ha, no, we’re not,” a man piped up.
Green eyes popped open and both men reared back at seeing the other. Castiel fell on his butt as he tried to move away from the human. The blonde was plastered to the cave wall, his chest rising and falling rapidly, his eyes blown wide in panic. Cas watched as the man’s gaze flickered all around the cave before finally zeroing in on him.
“I could ask you the same thing Dean. But I already know the answer; you’re here visiting a friend. A very special friend at that,” he chuckled darkly.
Cas braced his hands against Dean’s chest to give him as much leverage as possible as he bounced up and down in Dean’s lap. He pulled up until just the tip of Dean’s cock was still in him and then slammed down, pushing Dean’s cock as far inside his channel as possible. His veins were turning into molten lava and Cas could feel his orgasm approaching.
“Come, you said you had business with the king, and he doesn’t like to be kept waiting,” Dean’s father barked out. The group continued on their way without another word being spoken.
Dean hurried to pull Cas’ chair out for him. Once Cas was sitting, Dean took his seat before lifting the metal lids to show two plates of food sitting beneath them. He grinned at Cas’ laughter at seeing fries and burgers sitting on their plates. “I wanted to be romantic, but I figured burgers would be preferred.”
With strong strokes of his tail, he pulled the human up until both their heads broke water. He watched as the man started taking shallow breaths. He looked for the ship, but it was moving further away, completely oblivious to its lost passenger. Cas thought about what to do and came to a decision. He turned around and started swimming towards the shore.
Meg’s mouth dropped open in disbelief. “But what about the pleasures of the court: the music and the dancing, the parties and the women, the hunts and stories-”
Dean shook his head in disbelief. “Everybody from the Apocalypse world?”
Cas reached out and trailed his fingers through Dean’s short blonde hair before dragging a single finger down his temple, across his cheek, and settling against his lip. Cas knew he would never get the opportunity to hear Dean say that he loved the angel. He didn’t want to miss the opportunity to tell Dean how he felt. He let his mouth hover over Dean’s as he said, “I love you” before softly touching his lips to the hunter’s.
“Hey honey. Been a while since I saw you in here. How are you and that moose of a brother,” she asked as she set a beer in front of him, the lid already popped.
“I can’t exactly say it’s alright, but it was my fault. I shouldn’t have kissed you…”
John moved to stand next to the other man and glanced at the waves below, giving a sharp nod of his head. “The sea is very peaceful.” He looked at Castiel and said, “I remember the first time I saw the sea and the joy it brought me. Now, it is one of the only things I can look at for long periods of time.”
he curled in on himself, trying to bear through the pain.
Kevin had not been lying as it turned out. Cas’ bacon cheeseburger was one of the best things he had ever put in his mouth, and he was sorry to see the last bite disappear. Jack, who ate chicken tenders at least four times a week, even commented on how good the Roadhouse’s were.
“Uh, no, not imposing at all,” Dean said, a blush starting to stain his cheeks.
The malicious God smiled up at the angry hunter. “You going to kill me Dean? That won’t work well in your favor?”
Meg’s shoulders were tight with fury as she said, “You don’t even know where we’re going.”
Dean ran his hand through his hair. He moved until he was standing right in front of Cas. “For being such an asshole this morning. I was pissed at you and I was taking it out on you, too.”
Eileen strode forward and placed her hands on Castiel’s shoulders. “That is because you aren’t in your true form. You said you felt your magic which means it isn’t gone; it’s just locked away. Once you’re in your proper form again, all of your powers, and strength, and majesty will return. I assure you that.” She was tempted to pull Castiel in her arms but was unsure how he would react.
Dean leaned into Cas’ side. “Yeah, they do. I was getting worried that it would never happen for them.”
Dean nearly tripped as he stood to his feet and rushed to his brother. They slammed into each other, wrapping their arms around one another as tightly as possible. Neither cared to wipe away the tears that were streaming down their faces as they held onto each other. Dean had one arm around Sam’s neck and the other around his waist while Sam had thrown an arm across Dean’s shoulders and the other around his upper back. They clung to one another, their faces buried in each other’s shoulders. “I love you, Sammy,” Dean said, his voice shaky and full of tears.
Cas’ legs were the first thing to start changing. They were forced together, and it was like the skin immediately stitched together into one long appendage. The multicolored scales came next, popping over his skin in rapid succession until the siren’s entire lower body was covered. The fins on his tail and back seemed to grow straight from his body until they were fully formed. The last things to appear were the webbing between his fingers and the gills on his neck. The whole transformation took less than a minute.
“Yes, if you talk to her, she will leave that conversation knowing even more curse words than she already does,” Cas grumbled from his seat.
He flinched when he felt Dean’s hand land on his arm.
Cas quickly wrapped his arms around Dean. “My apologies. I’m not used to lots of casual touching. My parents were extremely formal and besides handshakes, we don’t have much skin to skin contact.”
“He said that he had a condition and most of the teachers didn’t want to deal with him because of it. I know Cas isn’t super popular, but I thought that teachers liked all of their students,” Dean said as he rubbed the back of his neck.
“Hey, Cas, I get it. I lost my parents when I was six, and my brother and I were taken in by close family friends. The first time I called Ellen mom and Bobby dad, I had a major breakdown. I was so confused because I missed my parents, and they would always be my parents, but Ellen and Bobby were just as much my parents to me. Things, even bad things, happen for a reason, even if we don’t know what the reason is at that moment. Ellen and Bobby had always wanted kids, and they hadn’t been able to have them, so we were able to be the kids they couldn’t have. Of course, my crazy sister, Jo, was born a year later. I’ll always miss my parents, but I’m glad that I’ve had Bobby and Ellen to fill in,” Dean explained, a tear rolling down his cheek.
The unicorn stared at the woman in front of him, finally taking in her appearance. The magician looked young, but her eyes told another story. They were cold and wary, having seen great horror and known tremendous loss. “Who are you, magician?”
Sensing Cas’ nervousness, Dean pressed a gentle kiss to Cas’ cheek. “He’ll be fine, promise. Charlie would never let anything happen to him.”
Cas cocked his head and asked, “What kissing tradition?”
Now that Dean was past the shock of the surprise guests, he focused his attention on the man at the end of the aisle. Cas was standing in front of a large wooden arbor decorated with flowers, wearing a nearly identical outfit as Dean, except he had a black bow tie and a gray pocket square along with his boutonniere. The smile that graced Cas’ face as he stared at Dean was brighter than a thousand suns. The love shining in his bright blue eyes was unmistakable.
Like Castiel, Dean wasn’t a sparkling white. He was a dark golden color with a light cream-colored mane and beard and was slightly larger than Castiel in both body and height. A long, twisted ivory-colored horn protruded from his forehead, a faint green glow surrounding it. When a stray ray of light pierced the trees, Dean’s coat shone like a polished gemstone. His eyes, which had always been a magnificent green, were now alive with a mysterious forest looming in his gaze.
Dean felt the archangel tense next to him. “I was loyal to you! For millions of years I tried to do the job you assigned me, but you left Father! You abandoned me to go create other worlds, other versions of me! Even though I was loyal and followed all orders, you favored Lucifer! Any loyalty I had to you is gone.”
“Same here baby. Let’s eat dinner first and then I’m all yours.” Dean pulled away, afraid if they kept going dinner would never happen.
Chuck sheathed his dagger and barked out. “Metatron, why don’t you get your lute and sing us a song?”
All of the men cheered and stomped their feet at the captain’s words. Yet, their cheers were drowned out by a single woman’s laughter. Eileen sat on her log, bent double as loud chuckles escaped her mouth. She finally sat up and wiped the tears from her eyes once everyone had fallen silent. When she spoke, her voice was mocking. “The king will pay, but it won’t be to a bunch of fools like you. His castle crumbles more every day, and his kingdom empty of any who wish to serve him. His death will come from a creature none of us has ever seen.”
He placed a tender kiss to Dean’s mouth, the word, “lips,” spoken between them. His hands came up to rest against Dean’s jaw as he deepened the kiss, their tongues rubbing against one another sensually. Cas smiled when he felt Dean’s large hands running through his hair and down his neck, across his shoulders, to finally rest against the smooth skin of his back.
Dean pulled out and pushed back in with long, steady strokes, letting Cas get accustomed to the feeling. Cas’ fingernails were digging into his back and his eyes were closed, his bottom lip held tightly between his teeth.
While he had described his day, Cas had gone back to the stove to check on dinner. He was cooking stir fry and didn’t want it to burn. Dean had followed him, refusing to lose contact with him. They now both stood at the stove, Dean behind Cas with his arms wrapped around him.
Dean forced a smile to his face. “Yeah kid, we did it. Michael’s right, there’s no better choice for a new God.” He pulled the Nephilim into his arms and hugged him tightly. When they broke apart, he kept a hand on Jack’s shoulder. “Jack, I’m not going back with you. I can’t. I need you to find Sam and make sure he’s ok. I know he was pissed that we left him behind but he was too injured to fight this battle. Then I need you to tell Sam I’m proud of him; I’m proud of all of us. Tell him to go find Eileen and have a life together. And you; you go turn Heaven around and put those dickhead angels in their place.” He squeezed Jack’s shoulder before dropping his hand.
“You could have dreamed up any world you wished, and this is what you came up with? You and me?” Cas asked.
“C’mon, Cas, better not keep ‘em waiting,” Dean said, getting to his feet and pulling Cas with him. He kissed Cas once, twice, thrice, just because he could.
“Yeah, thanks for joining me. Where are you going now?”
Finally, Alistair came to a stop. In front of them was a unique furrow in the sand. It was about two feet across at the widest point but quickly tapered down. It looked as if a giant fish had been dragged from the water onto the sand. Dean looked at the sand and saw that a few feet above the single track were ten small holes. He assumed Cas had dug his hands into the sand to pull himself up. Next to these, Dean could see where something else had been dragged in the sand.. It was a large, almost rectangular track and he knew that was where Cas had pulled him onto the beach.
“It’s never too late Dean. You just have to have the courage to take the first step,” Cas encouraged, a small smile on his face.
Cas slowly sped his thrusts up as he felt the fire begin boiling in his stomach. Dean could barely form words at this point, whimpers and moans the only sounds he could make. He was still managing to meet Cas thrust for thrust, but Cas could tell he was growing tired. Cas sped up until he was pounding into Dean causing the mattress to creak and the headboard to bang against the wall.
Dean spun around to face him.
“I’ve got you to thank for that,” Dean said, hovering his lips over Cas’.
“Dean, I don’t even know where to start! I mean, there’s a siren, a real-life siren, sitting in our living room! They’re supposed to be fairytales and yet you two seem pretty comfortable with each other. How long have you known about him?” Sam asked.
Dean blushed as he answered, “About three hours. Got any idea of how we could pass the time?”
Meg and Crowley quit fighting as they watched the unicorn, fear blooming in both of their gazes. The closer the unicorn got to the cage, the darker the night seemed to become. Ammit’s eyes were glowing a dark gold, and the hissing coming from her mouth was crescendoing.
“No thank you, sports aren’t really my thing. I’m going to stay here and read my book. You have fun with Benny, and remember your alcohol limit,” Cas reminded his friend.
Jack nodded his head in understanding. “I tried. I tried to bring him back again, but I couldn’t. I’m sorry Dean.”
“He’s gone Sam. What do we do? What do I do?” Dean asked with despair.
Cas looked around and took notice of things. “Why don’t we make a list of things that need to be fixed up and repaired. We each take a room and we will combine our lists when we are done.”
Dean cupped Cas’ jaw. “You’ll always be my angel. You’ve saved me more times than I can count.”
Meg threw her hands in the air. “How could it not? This land is horrible and haunted by the Red Bull. I’m immortal, you’re Deaf, and the unicorn is now disguised as a man. Who else could it be talking about? I didn’t even think about the prophecy until we met you, and now, now I’m certain we are the ones the seer spoke of. That is why we all must go to the castle and determine the fate of all the unicorns.”
Dean finally slowed the boat until it came to a stop. He spun around and touched his forehead to Cas’. Their eyes locked and they stared at one another. Neither man moved, knowing that when they did, the perfect world they had created would shatter.
Breakfast was a joyous affair. They talked about mundane things, the next case they would be working on or going to visit Jody, Donna, and the girls. Dean wanted to do a full tuneup on Baby while Sam wanted to visit the local bookstore. Cas, now that he was human, wanted to start learning how to cook and knit to pass the time. Eileen agreed that learning how to knit would be fun. Jack would have to return to Heaven in a few days to check up on everything, but he promised not to be gone too long.
Dean grinned when he saw who was working behind the front desk. “Hey, Meg, how are you doing?”
Dean hesitated but finally acquiesced. “Sure,” he said, stepping to the side and letting Cas enter. He headed straight to Dean’s bed and took a seat. Dean shut the door and leaned his head against the cool wood, trying to get his racing emotions under control.
“Yeah, if I wasn’t hiding our relationship from him,” Dean snapped.
“What do you mean, Lucifer?” Chuck asked.
Before a fight could break out, Meg jumped to her feet. “How about I entertain you for the night! I may not be able to sing or play the lute, but I have other talents that can be just as entertaining. I am a magician, and I’m sure my magic isn’t something you see very often.”
Dean shook his head, even if Cas couldn’t see it. “No, he didn’t share that knowledge with me.”
“Please, tell me more of this dream,” Dean implored as he took his seat.
Cas moved to grab the bottle of Astroglide and then returned to his lover. “I love you so much, Dean.”
“Yeah, just hurts like a son of a bitch. The ice isn’t helping all that much.” Dean grimaced as pain shot through his face.
“Geez, Cas, can’t we just have more than pop tarts or a granola bar? Does there always have to be a reason to have a decent breakfast?” Dean snapped as he put three pancakes on his plate.
“So, what did you guys talk about?” She asked with a knowing grin.
Dean’s face broke into a huge smile and a light blush coated his cheeks.
“I’m happy for you guys. From what Cas said about sirens, he needs someone to love him. Cas, I’m not your boyfriend, but if you ever need something, I’m here for you too. You make my brother happy and that means you’re part of the family now.” Sam walked over and pulled him into a tight hug.
Meg rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah. You’re not half bad yourself, Winchester. You tell anybody I said that, and I’ll deny it.”
“Yeah, you and me both,” Meg said, chuckling. “Alright, so there’s that purchase. Now, let me ring your boots up, and you’ll be all set.”
He pulled it out his pocket and was surprised at who was calling. “Cas, hi.”
Cas tilted his head and looked at the prince for a long moment. He shivered as the cold from the stone steps seeped into his bare feet. “Do you really think you can help me?”
Dean’s eyes went wide at his boyfriend’s words.
“Yeah,” Cas replied, smiling. “I’m pretty sure the house you’re talking about is the one Dean used to live in. I can’t believe you’re moving up here. Jack is going to love having his Uncle Gabe so close.”
“Sure as hell did,” Dean replied enthusiastically and with no hesitation.
“That’s what you do…when you’re in love.” Dean’s stomach was in knots as he spoke.
Dean huffed out a breath, rolling his eyes. “Dude, it’s an expression. Anyway, would you care if I made an announcement? Sam seems to think it will ruin the wedding.”
Dean took the last bite of his breakfast and headed back to the kitchen. “Oh, you know, enjoying my morning coffee and some toast… by myself, as always.” Dean knew he was being bitter, but he couldn’t help it.
“Thanks Sam. I’m still not ready to talk to Cas or come out to anybody else but I think I will be able to with time. You matter the most to me and as long as I have your support, I’ll be ok. Just don’t tell anybody else about what happened with dad,” he asked.
There was panicked whinny as the unicorn spun on his feet and fled back up the beach, the Bull right behind him. Sand and water flew up behind their heels as they ran. The Bull was insistent but patient, following the unicorn steadily but never gaining on him.
Dean rolled his eyes before pressing a chaste kiss to Cas’ lips and then pulled away to get dressed. He pulled on a pair of jeans that hugged his legs and ass in all the right ways. He smiled when he caught Cas staring appreciatively. He started to look for a shirt when one was thrust in his face. Cas had picked a dark green Henley out that complimented his eyes. He slipped it on while Cas retrieved some socks and shoes for him. When he was finally dressed, he placed the siren necklace around his neck before grabbing Cas’ hand and heading to the kitchen.
“Don’t let Ellen or Jody hear you say that; they’ll rip you a new one. Relax babe, I’ll talk to her tomorrow about curbing her tongue.” Dean opened the door for Cas to slide in before walking to the other side and climbing in.
Cas assured.
“I’ll never be able to thank you enough Cas. He even wants us to come visit him sometime. He is planning to open his own restaurant and wants Sam and I to come up with an interior design for it. That could be another huge boost for the business.” Cas loved how Dean’s eyes lit up when talking about work.
Cas stepped forward with his hand outstretched. “Castiel Novak. It’s good to meet you Benny, I’ve heard a lot about you.”
Cas flinched at the sound of wood slamming. He knew getting Dean to even consider talking to Sam would be a challenge. As he continued to spread the tarps out, he tried to think of ways to get Dean to reach out.
Cas, who was clad in nothing but a nightshirt, stopped and stared at the prince with large eyes. His gaze was full of fear, and Dean felt sorrow gather in his heart at seeing how distraught Cas looked. He took a step forward and said, “Good evening, Cas. Is everything alright?”
Meg growled and snarled and kicked at the dirt beneath her feet. “No! No, you can’t do this! I am eons old, and I will not be bested by some human.”
Cas stalked forward, a glare on his face. “How could you say that?”
Dean tried to think of some witty remark, but he couldn’t come up with any. The truth was, he liked Cas a lot. He was afraid of what others would think even if he knew the people he cared for wouldn’t judge him. It was one thing to accept others for who they were, it was something else entirely for Dean to accept himself.
Dean held his finger up, silencing Cas. “No arguing with me on this. I refuse to let my soulmate and kid be alone on Christmas. You found me, Cas; you’re stuck with me. We’ll have to do some shopping so I can get Jack some presents and so you can give me some ideas about what you like.”
Cas woke the next morning, still feeling tired. Nightmares had plagued him throughout the night, and he had woken up multiple times. He had bags under his eyes and his hair was sticking up at all angles as he trudged into the kitchen.
Jack, who was standing close enough to hear them, said, “I may have helped a little. Eileen actually couldn’t have kids because she had a lot of scarring from an old wound. I cleared it up, though.”
“Yeah, th.. that sounds good,” Dean stuttered.
Before he could say anything, the door to their apartment slammed open and Dean called out, “Babe, I’m home! I got the pillows and blankets for Sam and I picked up some more lube for us!”
“Everybody is outside. It should be starting in a few minutes. I’ve gotta go check with Jack, and then I’ll be right back.” Sam disappeared, leaving Dean alone.
Dean looked back at the man and thought him the most handsome person he had ever seen. The guy’s cheeks were a bright red, and his eyes sparkled in the fading light while snow fell around them. Dean reached out and grasped one of the strings of the man’s hat, his gaze locking with the other guy’s, and he whispered, “You’re him. You’re my soulmate.” When the man smiled brightly, his lips and eyes scrunching up, Dean knew he was already in love.
Something flickered across the unicorn’s gaze. “I had to say goodbye… to my friends.”
Dean pulled Cas behind him as he grabbed the shopping cart and headed for the closest checkout line. He ignored Alistair’s shouts behind him and squeezed Cas’ hand tighter.
Dean smirked. “Alistair, we are at the edge of an ocean. Who knows how long these tracks have been here? There’s no way to tell how old they are. Not to mention, the freaking storm that was raging that night.”
“I can’t believe you boy. I didn’t raise a faggot for a son! What’s worse, you were letting Benny fuck you! It’s bad enough you were with a guy, but you couldn’t be man enough to at least fuck him,” John shouted, each word a punch in the face to Dean.
Dean clenched his jaw as he stared at the dried up handprint. “He said his true happiness was something he always wanted but couldn’t have. He said he realized that happiness wasn’t in having but in feeling and in saying.” He looked at his brother and said, “Cas said he loved me and I- I… I didn’t get a chance to say it back.”
A few minutes later, they stopped outside of a brightly colored bakery in pink and orange hues. Instead of finding it loud and obnoxious, Cas found it warm and welcoming. Dean leaned over and whispered, “Charlie has no shame, as you can see. When Charlie started designing this place, she told me she wanted the whole town to know she was lesbian and proud of it. Not like anybody in this town cares anyway.”
“Be still,” Meg said sternly. “You needed to be saved, and the magic did just that. You will not be human forever!”
Cas suddenly grimaced and put his hand over his stomach.
Sam nodded his head, wincing. He looked up at his brother. “How did you get here? I never even saw you.”
They took a few minutes to clean the bed of boxes and put fresh sheets on it. Dean told Cas he could set up his toothbrush and other toiletries in the bathroom if he wanted. Cas said he would worry about it tomorrow and wished Dean goodnight. Dean gave a small wave as he locked himself in his own room.
Sadness flickered through Dean’s eyes. “I’ll never be able to make it up to you for choosing me. I know how much you gave up to be human.”
An hour later, Cas had finished his book. He was sitting on the couch, his phone in one hand and the piece of paper Charlie had given him in the other. He was trying to build his courage enough to dial Sam.
Cas pushed off from the counter he was leaning against. He grabbed the countertop griddle from one of the cabinets and plugged it in to preheat, making sure it was far enough away from Jack so the boy couldn’t reach it. He then placed a bowl, a measuring cup, and a whisk on the counter before going to the pantry to get the pancake mix. “Jack, you want any eggs this morning or just pancakes,” Cas asked as he placed the box on the counter.
“It’s just a horse, a black stallion,” the magician muttered.
Forest green eyes widened at his mother’s words, “Tell me momma!”
“You just need to tell yourself that it’s not. I think, maybe, if you told Cas, he would be able to help you,” Sam suggested.
Dean scrubbed at his face, exhaustion suddenly kicking in. “How could I ever let things get so bad Cas? I mean look at this list!” He held it for Cas to see. “It’s an entire page and I’m not even done writing everything down. How can we ever hope to get everything fixed up?”
I could stand here and say some cheesy words about love, about what marriage is built upon, and how you guys need to remember the reasons why you’re getting married, but I’m not.” There were a few chuckles from the crowd at Jody’s words.
“You’re gonna be the best uncle ever,” Sam said.
Without further ado, hope you guys enjoy!
Michael rolled his eyes. “I will never understand your obsession with this car. Even Adam is fond of it.”
Dean murmured.
The man looked at the unicorn with disgust. “It’s a dead horse, mother.” He lifted an eyebrow when he saw the animal take a breath. “Hmm, not dead after all. Why not feed it to the dragon or the manticore?” He chuckled darkly.
Dean flipped his hand over and laid it on top of Cas’. “If I ever meet your parents, I think I’ll punch them. But I get it. I’m pretty sure my dad wouldn’t have approved either. I remember when we were at the zoo once, and he saw a couple of guys kissing. He made some pretty rude remarks, and my mom got onto him about it. I have a feeling me being bi wouldn’t have changed his mind. Now, Bobby and Ellen couldn’t give two shits about who I date, not that I’ve dated a lot of people. I tried a couple of times, but after getting left by a girl because she found her soulmate, I quit dating because I didn’t want the same thing to happen again.”
Meg huffed and waved Sam away. “It’s none of your concern.” She grabbed Castiel’s hand. “Come, we need to go find wine and then get to the main hall.”
“Well, the woman is your aunt, the magician. The bloody hands must mean that she has done you harm in some form. Do you know what she has done? You’ve told me before that she and Eileen have done you harm,” Dean said.
A tall, willowy man walked into the clearing. He wore nothing but green except for the brown boots that covered his feet. He held a large bow in his left hand, and a quiver of arrows was slung over his back. He ignored the men calling to him and walked straight through the clearing before vanishing into the shadows. Soon, others followed in his wake.
As Cas danced with Jack, he glanced at Dean and Claire, and he felt his heart bursting at the seams. For millennia, he had been a mindless angel, doing as he was told and not questioning a thing. That had all changed the moment he laid a hand on Dean in Hell. The hunter had changed Cas in ways he never imagined and made Cas feel and do things no angel ever should. Cas knew Dean felt guilty about him choosing humanity over divine power, but Cas didn’t miss being an angel very much. Every once in a while, he would miss his wings, and phantom pains would leave him gasping for breath, but getting to spend his life with Dean was worth it. With Dean, Cas had something Heaven could never have given him- a family.
Cas shook his head as he reached inside and pulled out three thick comforters. “You were presumptuous, weren’t you?”
“Pshh, doesn’t matter Cas. Sam was about to text Eileen and have her pick him up and I was about to head home myself,” Dean lied without second thought.
Dean stood to his feet and helped Sam to his before pulling his brother into a tight hug. “Let’s go kill this son of a bitch and get that happy ending.”
Dean returned the smile before pulling Cas’ hand up and kissing the back of the knuckles.
“Yes, but there’s a catch. You must give up your grace. I promised the Empty that when you died the next time, Heaven would be your destination.”
Cas looked down as well. His semi-hard cock was easy to outline below the lacy material.
“So am I. Thanks for everything you did, Kevin,” Dean said softly.
Eileen grabbed the bottle from Sam’s hand and held it out to Meg. “Here, this is full of water. We thought maybe you could turn it into wine. You wouldn’t be starting from nothing, at least.”
Castiel knew he needed to strip the man of his soaking clothes. Cas rid him of the wet garments quickly before heading deeper into the cave. He was glad that he had ventured on land so much because with every trip he gathered souvenirs and stored them in this cave. He had quite a few blankets that he had collected and hurried to wrap them around the human. He wished he knew how to start a fire but even if he did, he had no materials to burn.
He removed a few thousand dollars from the safe before closing it. He glanced around the room and saw two different cameras. He used his grace to wipe them clean before flying out the room. He made a few more stops to pick up a few items he would need. By the time he was done, he had a backpack, a couple change of clothes, and a wallet. He had thrown his old clothes away except for the trench coat that he was too fond of to get rid of.
Dean felt a punch to his gut at hearing the despair in Cas’ voice. He scrambled to his feet and took a deep breath before slowly opening the door. Cas was standing on the other side, his lips set in a frown and his eyes shining with something Dean didn’t want to try and identify. “Hey, Cas.”
Charlie was quiet for so long that Eileen feared she wouldn’t say anything else. “They are near and far. They are within reach of the unicorn’s fingertips but almost gone from his memory. They come closer and move farther away in an endless ebb and flow cycle.”
Cas asked eagerly.
“It means I can’t bring him back and neither can Jack… but you can. Help me defeat my father, and I will tell you how,” Michael replied.
Cas, who was drawing something in his notebook, didn’t look up but nodded his head. “Hello Dean. It seems we are. I’m sorry for that. I know that I wasn’t your first choice.”
Meg scowled at the man. “You are more human than unicorn. Hopefully, we do find a way down to the Red Bull; otherwise, unicorns will be lost to this world.” She turned back to the skull. “You’re right, I am a magician, and there are dozens of spells to make something speak.” She stared at the head, her eyes narrowed as she spoke a few words. She reached out and touched the pale bone, muttering a few more words under her breath.
All three men went pale as the words that Bobby said sunk in. Castiel started trembling and Dean wrapped his arm around him and pulled him close into his side. Cas buried his face in the offered shoulder. Sam looked at Mary and Bobby, completely at a loss for words.
“You act all high and mighty, but you’re a researcher too, Dean. How many animals have you studied and taken blood from,” Alistair taunted him.
In the morning light, the wagons of Rowena’s midnight carnival weren’t as menacing, looking like they would fall apart with a good gust of wind. They had been set up in a large circle with Rowena’s carriage in the middle. The draperies from the previous night had been pulled down and replaced with thin black banners, which advertised what creature the cage held captive behind its bars.
“What, no? Of course you do! Dean, you have done so much for this world and for the people you love. You deserve to have someone love you. I found Eileen, so of course you deserve to find someone. Hell, Cas found you a decade ago. Even after everything we’ve all been through, Cas has always been there for you. He’s always loved you Dean, and you deserve that more than any of us,” Sam insisted.
Dean started struggling again, trying to unbalance the chair so that it would fall. He finally wiggled enough to send him and the chair toppling to the ground. He hit his shoulder hard but couldn’t worry about the pain. He used his bound feet to push his body across the concrete. He didn’t have much traction and one push didn’t get him very far, but he kept going. It took forever until he was finally near the edge of the pool.
Dean explained matter of factly.
“So, you’ve let your pride get between the two of you for years,” Cas growled. “You can sit there and say Dean is stubborn and doesn’t want to apologize, but it seems like you’re the same way. At least Dean will admit his faults.”
Dean took a step forward, slowly reaching for one of Cas’ hands and intertwining their fingers. “Hey, it’s ok. You don’t have to apologize for being shy. I’ll be extroverted enough for both of us. My aunt and uncle have said multiple times I would talk to a squirrel if it would talk back to me. I can’t say I haven’t tried a few times. Little buggers have never once said a darn thing back, though.”
Cas quirked his lips up, “Having a place to stay is more important than if that place is a little dirty. I can help you get it cleaned up.”
“I’m already so fucking close and you’ve hardly done anything. I feel like a teenager.” Dean grumbled before he groaned as Cas sucked the head of his cock into his mouth. “Fuck!”
“I’ll be waiting.”
Eileen looked at the clock with a frown. “Do as the skull said and go through the clock.”
“I repeat, what do you want?”
“And Dean said you were the smart one,” Cas growled.
he answered, his cheeks a severe red.
The man looked at Meg, and fire was swimming in the oceans of his eyes. “You should have let the Bull kill me! You should have left me to Ammit! The iron bars of Rowena’s wagon didn’t feel as awful as being trapped in this body does. This body is like lead; every step I take is like lifting the weight of a tree. I can feel this body dying all around me! I am dying! I am a unicorn, and no unicorn is ever supposed to feel the kiss of death so easily as I do now!”
Cas smiled softly at his friend. “Dean, I enjoy spending time with you, don’t doubt that. I think it’s a good idea, though, that we do start spending a little time away from each other. You need more friends than just me.”
Castiel wanted to say more but chose not to. He quickly swam out of the cave and found Spot waiting for him. He looked at the bottles in his hands and decided he needed something to carry them in. He found some kelp and created a simple bag to stow the bottles in. He and Spot then started the long journey home.
Before Cas could speak, they heard footsteps coming down the stairs, and the king’s voice echoed off the stone walls. “I heard Dean singing! Why is he singing?”
A little bit later they arrived at Dean’s shitty apartment. He was embarrassed to show Cas where he lived but like Cas had said, a roof over his head was better than nothing. They climbed up the stairs until coming to Dean’s apartment. Dean stopped when he got to the door, reaching inside his pocket for the keys but paused.
He turned to face Dean as he approached. “The lady over there said we can feed the fish for a dollar. Can we, Dean? I want to feed them so bad,” Cas signed.
“No,” Cas said flatly. “Now sit down and eat your burger and fries. Then you can have an ungodly amount of pie.”
Cas nodded, his lips a thin line. “Please just talk to him and if you are mad with me afterwards, I will understand.” He slid from Dean’s lap and walked off to the living room.
Dean shrugged. “About an hour ago. Benny told me to see how I feel tomorrow and if I’m hurting too badly to take the day off.”
Five and a Half Years Later
The unicorn kept telling himself it was an illusion and that nothing he was feeling was real. He forced his head up and, instead of seeing Maya, saw Rowena, herself, stepping out of the cage. Rowena shook her head, her fiery curls bouncing around her. “I enjoyed that. It’s always nice to see the peasants run away in fear.” She glanced at the unicorn and flashed him a devilish smile.
“What have you done to me?” he cried. He tore at his flawless skin, and blood flowed behind his fingers. “I will die! I will die, here, in this body!” His entire being reeked of fear, except his face. His fingers trembled, and his breathing was ragged, yet his face remained impassive. “You have cursed me, just like the wizard from your story! I told you that the wizard did the unicorn no favor, and you have done me no favor! I would have rather died than be turned into… into this!”
Dean sat on the loveseat and his boyfriend curled into his lap. He didn’t say anything, wrapping his arms tightly around the still shaking siren. He looked at Sam and raised an eyebrow, the universal sign of “What?”
He shivered and shook his head as that thought crossed his mind. Guys were not cute and even if they were, Dean had no business thinking such things.
He looked at Sam and started to say something but was cut off. “Go, Dean. I’ll be ok. Go find him.”
“Why the hell did you not tell me you were thrown into the ocean during that awful storm? I had to listen to Bobby tell me the other night instead of hearing it from you! You could have been killed,” she fumed.
“Please, Meg. You have magic; I know you do! You called Robin Hood when there was no Robin Hood. That was real magic! You have magic; you have all the magic in the world; you just have to be brave enough to search for it,” Eileen begged. She gestured to the unicorn, who was still being driven towards the castle. “It’s not fair! That Bull will drive him towards Winchester, and then the world will lose its very last unicorn! You are his only hope!”
Dean’s face turned red at his brother’s words. “I actually already have both of them.” He pulled his jacket sleeve back on his right wrist and showed Sam a black leather bracelet. “It’s Garth’s. He said he wore it on his wedding day and hoped it would bring Cas and me good luck.”
“Probably him relaxing on the couch with an endless amount of beers, burgers, and pie with Dr. Sexy on rerun,” Cas deadpanned.
Amara stared at the man in front of her in shock before bursting into laughter. She looked at the king and said through her chuckles, “You have brought your doom inside of your castle, and you don’t even know it. It walked through your front door, although it won’t exit that way. One day you will need a master magician to save you, and all you will have is Meg. Farewell, King Winchester, farewell.” The witch disappeared in a cloud of black smoke.
Cas nibbled at the skin between Dean’s neck and shoulder.
Dean’s voice broke as silent sobs wracked his body.
They quickly got Cas out of his clothes and Dean helped him to the back of the boat where Cas was able to slide into the water. He went under and reappeared moments later, his skin already looking refreshed. Dean rushed back to his bag and got dressed in his wetsuit. He dropped the anchor ensuring the boat wouldn’t be able to go anywhere. He grabbed his snorkel before joining Cas in the sea.
While he was changing, Dean signed to the woman, “Thank you for everything. My boyfriend is just starting to find himself and he was really worried about what people would say with his choice in clothing. You helped him in more ways than you know.”
As he walked across the parking lot, no less than five people called out a quick “Hello” to him. Dean smiled and waved back but didn’t stop to talk, wanting to get inside and out of the cold as fast as possible. He walked inside and looked around.
When the conversation moved to other topics, Dean looked to his right to tune into Sam and Eileen’s conversation. “Just tell him, Sam,” Eileen whispered.
Cas caught Dean’s lips in a tender embrace. “That’s a good point. It will be nice to do something that can bring all of our friends and family together. I’m glad you’re willing to indulge me.”
“Better to have loved than never loved at all, Cas. If he knows how you truly feel, maybe after you’re gone, that will give Dean something to hold onto. He’s going to need something when you’re gone, Castiel,” Missouri said softly.
Castiel joked.
Cas’ lips crooked up, “I usually go running every morning and practice yoga at least three times a week. Although, I’ve hardly done either since we started dating.”
Dean stared at the bottom of his empty coffee cup and decided to get his Christmas shopping done instead of moping around the house. He sat the empty mug in the kitchen sink and then headed to his bedroom to get changed. Dean quickly brushed his teeth and changed into jeans, a henley, and a blue flannel shirt. He grabbed his wallet and keys off his bedside table and shoved them in his pockets before heading to his front door. He slid his feet into his boots and laced the shoes up. Dean grabbed his olive green parka, slipping his arms inside and buttoning it up. He wrapped his bright green scarf around his neck and crammed the matching beanie on his head, making sure to cover his ears.
Gathering all the courage he had, Dean walked forward and took a seat next to Cas. “Cas...I don’t care if you’re human or angel. Your worth to me doesn’t come from having some magical mojo. I’m-I’m so sorry that I’ve made you think that.” Dean took a few breaths, trying to get his thoughts in order. “I want you here, Cas, in the bunker… with me, no matter what you are.”
Dean sighed. “Fine.” He looked at Cas. “Just one short kiss, and that’s it.”
Dean scoffed. “They were dreams, Sam, nothing more.”
The sea surrounded the castle from the right and back. The waves continuously smashed against the cliffside, taking pebbles and rocks with them every time. Three sentinels were pacing one of the many tall towers of the castle, allowing them to see for miles in any direction. Right as the sun was setting over the land, they noticed three strangers approaching.
Finally understanding his words, Eileen scoffed even as she reached out and dragged the tips of her fingers down the unicorn’s face. “Where were you twenty years ago, when I was young and new? Where were you ten years ago when I still didn’t know the touch of a man? How dare you come to me now when I am this?” Eileen dropped her hand and whispered, “To see me now, I wish you had never come in the first place.”
Eileen busied herself with cleaning up the dishes, not wanting Castiel to the sorrow on her face. “I am sorry for what Meg and I have done to you; I hope you know that.” She gripped the sink tightly, her head hanging in shame. She turned around to see Castiel staring at her, a harsh frown marring his features.
Dean placed another light kiss to the older man’s hand.
Cas looked up and locked eyes with him. Dean was so lost in their depths, he never processed that Cas was leaning forward until a pair of lips pressed against his own. For a moment, he enjoyed the feel of another pair of lips against his.
Dean rubbed at the back of his neck, refusing to meet Sam’s eyes. “Besides Benny, I’ve never actually told any of the people I dated.”
at all baby.” Dean glanced at his watch to check the time. “Did you want to go home and get cleaned up before we headed to the Roadhouse? We still have about two hours until we need to be there.”
“It’s ok,” Meg said, attempting a small smile. “Taking me with you is payment enough. Don’t worry about it.”
“Well then, I would be glad to take you up on your offer. I might also be able to help with the eviction problem.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You got a broke car and no job as well,” Dean joked, a small smile on his face.
Meg pulled her cloak tighter around her shoulders. She looked at her companions before turning around and facing the dark tunnel. “We have only one choice. I don’t know where this tunnel leads, but hopefully, it is a way out.”
Cas nodded, and they made their way to the kitchen where Dean got a blazing fire going. He pulled up a couple of chairs and had Cas sit in one before wrapping a thick blanket around his shivering body.
When they pulled into Mary’s driveway a little while later, they were surprised to find an old beat up truck parked beside her own vehicle. Dean parked behind Mary’s truck and they all shuffled out the car.
The unicorn tossed his head with a soft whinny. “I’m sorry, magician, but I have not heard of you. I’ve never stepped foot out of my forest before now and therefore couldn’t name a single magician who has walked this Earth.”
That earned him a hard smack to his head. “You idiot boy! You need to tell Mary, or she is going to be even more pissed with you!”
Dean stopped, forcing Cas to stop as well. He turned and looked at Meg, and only the light coming from Castiel allowed her to see the frown on the prince’s face. “I didn’t know what he was exactly before now, but from the first time I laid an eye on him, I knew he was something… different. Something grand and magical and more than I could ever hope to be. So, call him a unicorn or an angel or phoenix or sorcerer. It would not matter to me what he truly was. I love him, and that’s all that matters.”
“Absolutely,” Cas said, nodding his head.
Dean’s gaze had stayed locked on Castiel the entire time his father and the magician had been talking. He watched as the man walked past his companions and headed to the single window. Castiel stared through the glass, watching the waves crashing beneath them. There was a solemn look of longing on his face that Dean desperately wanted to make disappear.
The oldest of the men shook his head. “There are two women but do not be so sure about the one in the cloak.”
Once they were back in the apartment, Castiel was surprised when Dean pulled him into a hug. He had only been hugged a few times in his life by Gabe and it was an odd feeling to say the least.
“Good luck at your meeting, and I will give Jack your love. I love you too,” Cas said, a smile stretching his lips.
“Good. Well, enjoy your book and I’ll see you when I get back. If you need anything, just call me,” Dean said as he headed out the door.
Meg frowned and glanced towards the ocean, even if she couldn’t see it from this position. “Do not fret. I’ve never seen them in the waves either, and I’ve looked dozens of times. But if the king says they are there, then they must be. Don’t worry; now that we know where they are, we will find them.” Cas finally looked up, causing Meg to gasp. “Your face, it is wet. Please tell me that it's from the ocean spray and not from tears. If you’ve become human enough to cry, I don’t know if there is magic strong enough to turn you back.” She helped Castiel to his feet and pulled him along, muttering, “It must be spray. It has to be.”
Castiel sighed, the sound light and airy. “I must face the Bull again before I forget who I truly am. My people may all be dead, and I might have nothing left to save, but I must face him. Even if I go to him in this form, it has to be done, but I don’t know the way to him.”
