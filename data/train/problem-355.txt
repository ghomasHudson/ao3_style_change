“It’ll take too long. If we don’t find anything today, that’s what I’ll do. Come along. Be quick, and don’t make too much noise.”
“Ah, the great Sherlock Holmes,” came his brother’s voice from above, “Full-time consulting detective and part-time sausage roll.”
. There was nobody at the door, so I looked around a little. When I came back, I thought she had just woken up and wandered off. I searched the entire house, but I couldn’t find her. What I did find was a note, telling me to go to the morgue if I wanted to find her, and tell nobody.”
“Those tapes were doctored. The man in them wasn’t Moran, just a lookalike.” Mycroft said, “Switzerland always was one of Moriarty’s - now Moran’s - strongholds. They had a government official slip in the tapes and pass them off as credible. A while ago, he cracked and confessed - of course, he was killed before we could take any further action.”
“Spending the night with Molly. Even I can’t take care of two babies at once. I’ll be in the kitchen if you need anything.” He turned to go.
Sherlock looked back up, disbelieving. His throat was dry and his eyes suspiciously glassy. “But - are you sure about this?”
Sherlock sat down in the office chair and swivelled it around, munching on an apple. It was the first time John had seen him eat voluntarily in a few days.
When John finally got back to the flat after his shift, Sherlock was putting Rosie to sleep. Sherlock had realized that talking to Rosie and taking care of her helped clear his head - but, well, he also just liked the attention she gave him. John’s eyes hovered over the scar on her forehead. “When I find that cabbie, I’m going to kill him.” he said.
“Why not?” Harry asked, surprised. “Oh - right. Your wife died a few months and no one, not even a hot gay detective, can distract you from that. Look, John - there’s no such thing as good and bad timing. Either you love someone or you don’t. Either you’ll fight for them or you won’t. You and Sherlock - and this is coming from someone who hasn’t even seen you two together - you’re soulmates. Take your time, but don’t let this chance slip away.”
Rosie started whimpering, and Sherlock got up to cradle her in his arms. Mycroft could sense that they both felt equally uncomfortable discussing this, but he went on.
“Bloody hell, Sherlock,” he said through gritted teeth, “There’s a foot in the fridge. A human foot.”
Sherlock had expected him to storm out in a temper, not to stay and fight for him. For a moment, his resolve weakened, and he wondered if he could really give up the best thing that had ever happened to him. But then he thought of Rosie, drugged and kidnapped, and John in a hospital room with a scar on his forehead, and swallowed.
“But you have to-” John stopped halfway through his sentence, surprised, “Wait, you’ll do it? You’re just going to...listen to me?”
“Whatever happened to ‘I am not gay?’” Sherlock asked, trying to keep his voice steady, which wasn’t easy with John’s warm hands under his shirt.
“Time is an illusion.” Sherlock said, trailing his fingers up John’s arm and leaning in for another kiss.
“Mom, are the police bothering you again?” he asked. He looked up and seemed to notice Sherlock and John for the first time. His eyes went as round as dinner plates. “You’re Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. I read your blog. Are you working on this case?”
She just sighed. “I’m sick of you, Sherlock. Don’t even try. I’m in love with a version of you which doesn’t exist and never did. I always thought you were this hero, with your deductions and your intellect, but you’re not. Heroes don’t exist, and if they did, you wouldn’t be one.”
From the odd look on Sherlock’s face, John instantly knew that he had crossed some invisible line. Sherlock went into his bedroom and slammed the door, only to return two minutes later with a pillow and a blanket. He avoided John’s eyes as he made his bed on the sofa and folded himself onto it, his back to John.
Sherlock blinked and looked away. “I only need drugs when you’re not around.” he said quietly, but not quiet enough.
“Rosie did. Look! She likes me.” Rosie had spotted Sherlock and was now enthusiastically thrashing about. He smiled, tweaked her nose, and started buttoning his quintessential black coat. John eyed him suspiciously.
thought about it quite extensively - what he’d like to do if he ever wearied of solving crimes. Up until now, John had never been a prominent feature in his plans, because he was married to Mary and living his own life with her. Obviously, things were different now.
John nearly dropped his pin. Fortunately for him, the lock clicked open and they pushed through the door. He switched on the light, and Sherlock’s gaze settled on a chest of drawers.
Sherlock was downstairs, talking to his parents, who had noticed how tired John was and sent him up directly. John wanted to stay awake and ask Sherlock about the Trevors, make sure he was okay, but despite his best efforts, he was slowly drifting off. He’d already started dreaming up indistinct shapes and faces when Sherlock’s voice woke him up.
“Wha- it’s the famous Ferrier necklace! It’s worth thousands!” protested Lestrade. Sherlock just sighed. “Any suspects?”
“Eventually, I moved out of Baker Street. I started going out more, getting in touch with old friends, a few meaningless dates here and there. But nothing ever stuck. No-one ever stayed. They all treated me like I was made of china, but nobody wanted to be around when the china broke. I couldn’t even bring myself to care about them. The only person I really cared about was dead. But then I met Mary.”
Rosie looked at him with her large, woebegone eyes. “Dadda?” she asked. It sometimes surprised John, how very perceptive she could be.
“No.” Rachel bit her lip and twisted her wedding ring. “We were very young when we got married. Barely out of college. It was all sunshine and rainbows for a few years. But then he made a couple of bad investments, lost all his money, and that’s when we first started having problems. He...changed. I won’t go into details, but he started going around with quite a rough crowd, getting dead drunk on a regular basis, that sort of thing.”
John and Sherlock went up the stairs and paused outside the door. They knocked, and a tremulous voice invited them in. It took their eyes a while to adjust to the semi-darkness inside the room, but they could make out a middle-aged man sitting on the bed, wrapped in a blanket. He took a long, shaky drink of water, and raised his eyebrows at them.
“Not easy.” John agreed. “You could just tell him Victor tripped and fell down the well. Actually, Mycroft could easily have told him by now.”
. After months of conversing with Rosie in sounds and gestures, it was another thing entirely to hear her actual voice. They passed her back and forth as she said
John nodded his approval, and Sherlock meekly set down his phone. He’d sulked all night long before he finally managed to convince himself to send the text. He knew it was for the case, but he absolutely hated the idea of going out on a fake date with Irene - especially since John thought he was ‘interested’ in her. As if he could ever have eyes for anyone except John Watson.
He sighed and picked up the newspaper, scouring it for any news about the Yardley Oliver case. Surprisingly, there was none, even in the local papers. If the matter was so hush-hush, how had Irene heard about it?
“Well, Lestrade, I’ve got what I wanted.” Sherlock said. As they left the flat and hailed a cab, he muttered, “I’ve been a fool, an utter fool. I was focusing on James Oliver’s murder, when I should’ve been focusing on the break-in.”
“Crime number three - victim: Rachel Evans. A red 3 painted on the front door. Husband Fred Evans was murdered. A month later, his corpse visits the house, let in by the house help, Mark. Er, where did this lead us?”
John could tell that Sherlock wasn’t going to budge this time. He would probably starve himself till he got some sudden ray of inspiration.
“Are you going to tell me what’s going on?” John asked, putting on his jumper inside-out in his hurry.
They had come back from Sherrinford just in time for dinner, but Sherlock had refused food and just sat around the apartment, lost in thought. Eventually, John had given up on trying to talk to him and gone to sleep. He’d left Sherlock staring at the fireplace, and when he awoke, Sherlock still hadn’t moved. He slid off the couch and sat down on the floor next to him.
“Already?” asked John. He hesitated. “I thought you might want to take some time off. You know...with everything that’s been happening -”
“No, Sherlock.” John said forcefully, “It’s all very well now, but what about when Rosie starts to walk and explore and open cabinets? I don’t want her growing up thinking that it’s perfectly normal to find heads and eyes lying around the house.”
Sherlock slid into the blanket, trying not to sigh with relief as his sore muscles hit the soft mattress. He was glad for the warmth radiating off John as they lay there, John staring up at the ceiling, Sherlock on his side, facing him. He finally broke the silence. “Is it Mary?”
“What? No, I’m fine.” John said, but as he kept glancing at his phone every few seconds, it wasn’t very convincing. “It’s probably nothing. Babies’ stomachs get upset all the time. All part of the process.”
As Sherlock turned the corner, he was surprised to see Lestrade walking by the entrance of Angelo’s.
Sherlock snorted. “As if I’d care about what Sebastian Wilkes thinks. The only way those words could ever hurt me is if they were to come from you.”
Over the years, John had learnt that very few things could shake Sherlock, but this certainly did. Sherlock collapsed in his armchair and leaned back, eyes closed, fingertips joined.
Before John could even nod, Sherlock sauntered in. John rose, alarmed. Sherlock never visited him at work. “What’s wrong? Is Rosie fine? Did the flat blow up again? Is Mrs Hudson - “
John pulled Sherlock down by the collar and stretched up, almost on tiptoe. His lips ghosted past Sherlock’s mouth, the ridge of his nose, his cheekbones, finally coming to rest on his forehead.
“I’ll send you the necessary papers by tonight.” Mycroft was saying, “The helicopter will meet you at the usual place. I really must get going now. A tempting evening of absolute inactivity awaits me.” He nodded at John and headed out, straightening a pile of books as he went.
However, ever since witnessing the twisted Holmes sibling dynamics, he had decided that maybe his sister wasn’t so bad after all. It was hard to undo the rift that had sprung up between them after he left for the war, but he was trying to reach out to her. Now, the two of them could at least share a meal together without bickering.
having a good time. If he was determined to get answers, Irene was equally resolute not to give any. He’d spent the last hour trying to steer their conversation into dangerous waters, but she kept cutting him off with snarky comments. They were halfway through dessert by the time he managed to make any headway.
Sherlock thought. Angelo leaned towards Sherlock and whispered, “Anything you want, anything at all. It’s all on the house, of course.” Sherlock smiled in acknowledgment, and Angelo bustled away to get the menus.
Sherlock just shook his head and rejected the call again. John shrugged and closed his eyes; he had barely drifted off to sleep when
For a while, there was silence on the other end. “Are you serious? You’ve had a proper boyfriend before? Not one of your college flings?”
“So Moran knows that we know he’s alive.” Sherlock said. “This picture - he either actually is in Poland and was unaware of the surveillance camera -”
Sherlock whipped out his magnifying lens and began examining every inch of the living room. “How did she die? Ah, nevermind. Drug overdose. Think there’s still some cocaine lying around?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “No, she wasn’t. Don’t you listen? It’s always been you. Also, Irene and I are both gay.” Before John could protest, he leaned forward and stopped his mouth with a kiss. I’ll get you something for your shoulder.”
For a moment, Sherlock was tempted, but then his phone buzzed in his pocket and he shook his head. Staying off narcotics and drugs was one promise he could keep.
, read the nameplate. Beyond the unkempt garden, yellow tape crisscrossed the front door. A giant red ‘5’ was painted on it in something that looked suspiciously like blood, but on further examination was revealed to be paint. They entered, Sherlock looking about suspiciously, and followed the passageway into a large sitting room. A man sat crying on a plush white sofa, while policemen milled about the room. Lestrade made his way over to Sherlock.
Yes, I know that Sherlock putting his head on John’s shoulder would require quite a bit of contortion, thanks to their height difference. I like to think he was kind of half-lying down and John was sitting straight.
Sherlock paced his room that night, his frustration increasing. Chasing down the person who was orchestrating this drama was turning out to be a lot more difficult than he’d thought. Irene, Mrs Hudson, the help at the Evans’ - none of them had led back to anything. Even the Golem had chosen to die rather than reveal his employer’s name. The only person who had ever inspired such fear was...well, Moriarty.
“Not a problem.” Mycroft said, sitting down on the sofa like he owned the house. “We have all the time in the world. We’ll take your statement till he wakes up.”
“I heard.” Sherlock said demurely. “And I saw you clench your fists and prepare to punch him, but you didn’t. You now only react with violence and anger to a fourth of the situations you did earlier; that’s good progress, John.”
Angelo handed them their menus and left. Sherlock couldn’t help but smile when he noticed that there was no mention of a candle or a date.
“Can’t forget.” John said, reaching out to tie Sherlock’s loose scarf properly. “Not if I tried. It still feels like a miracle.”
“He’s woken up earlier than usual.” she said. “Now, if he’s in a good mood, I’ll let you talk. Otherwise - it’s pointless, come back later. Go wait in the garden, I’ll just wheel him out.”
John pulled away, searching his eyes. “You’ve never said that before. It’s always ‘I’m in love with you’, or - ”
He realized there was nothing to do but wait. No point wailing about it. When he opened his eyes and looked up, Molly was still standing there, eyes trained on his face. This was the most contact they’d had since Eurus’ little game. He’d called her every day and left at least a thousand texts, call me, call me, call me.
Mycroft shot him a nasty look. “Yes, I wanted to remind you about the East London murder. I’ve made arrangements for you to visit the crime scene in -” he checked his watch - “an hour. It’s no use asking me why I’m so persistent about you taking this case, Sherlock, you’ll have to figure it out on your own.” He rose to leave. “Thank you for the tea.”
, and I’ve wanted you for years.” Sherlock said, and there was a hint of desperation in his voice now. “I thought about you, constantly, whether you were with me or not. Even when I didn’t see you for two years, and after you got married - I never stopped loving you.” His voice cracked, and he felt a tear trace its way down his cheek. He wiped it away angrily. “See? Body betrays me.”
Lestrade nodded in understanding. One of his men poked at a patch with his spade, raised his eyebrows and called the others over. Nicholas and Lestrade stepped closer to watch them dig. The stench intensified, and Lestrade was tempted to cover his nose with his shirt. To his horror, he could now see a human hand poking out of the dirt. Slowly, painfully, they unearthed an arm, a torso, a leg, a face, until an entire dead body could be hoisted out of the dirt and laid out on level ground.
John had spent the entire helicopter ride trying not to think about what would happen if it malfunctioned. He didn’t mind crashing into Sherrinford, but what if they fell into the water? He clutched the railing and glanced at the waves, then turned away, trying not to think. It wouldn’t do. It wouldn’t do to think about that; not here, not now, not
It was a wild, tempestuous day, and the wind furiously rattled the windows of 221B Baker Street. Outside, only a few raincoat-clad figures battled through the rain, and even cars were minimal. Sherlock stood by the window and watched the downpour.
“My daughter by my first wife. Brought Charlie up all by myself, I did. Her mother walked out before the poor baby could even sit up.” He held his glass out for a refill. “Charlie was always rather...restless. Once she left for college, she never looked back. I didn’t mind much, to be frank. You give a child wings, don’t be surprised when they start flapping them. She always checked in with me a few times a year. I’m just sorry she never really got to know Susan and James.”
“Forget it.” she said, “You told me it was for a case. I was just another one of your lab rats, then. No big deal.”
“I hope Rosie didn’t give you a hard time. Thank you so much for looking after her for two nights in a row.”
He couldn’t help feeling slightly chafed that Sherlock was taking Irene there. He’d always somehow thought of it as
The voice in his head changed, mirroring the same rough one that had tormented him for months at a time:
“Well, it’s worth a try.” he muttered to himself. He handed her the skull, and she stopped crying almost instantly.
“That, and I’ve basically been pining over him since the day that I met him. So - Clara was your first girlfriend, right? But you two didn’t end well.”
She smiled weakly and hugged him tight again. “Thank you.” she said to Sherlock and John, “Really. I don’t know what I would’ve done if you hadn’t been there.”
“Well, I’m a lousy boyfriend.” he said, then turned on his heel and stalked off to his room. John followed him, determined not to leave without finding out why.
“I was lying awake in this room when I heard a crash downstairs. So I just climbed halfway down the staircase and I - I saw Anna in the living room. I fainted, and when I came to, she was gone, so I called the police.”
John looked at Sherlock then, registering the concern on his face, and everything stabilised a little. A lump rose in his throat. Sherlock was always so
Sometimes, he still had trouble believing that Sherlock was alive. He’d wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, after replaying Sherlock’s jump in his dreams. His barely conscious mind would convince him that Sherlock still lay limp and decaying in that graveyard. He remembered what he had said to Sherlock’s gravestone:
Rosie was sitting on the floor, clutching Sherlock’s skull. Sherlock was trying to snatch his ‘friend’ away, but she wouldn’t let go.
- although I confess, she can’t take full credit for that.” Sherlock opened his mouth to respond, but Mycroft cut him off. “In case you’ve forgotten, she almost killed John Watson.”
There was a long silence. For once, Sherlock was at a complete loss for words. When he finally spoke, he had to keep hard to keep his voice even.
. It was doubly hard because those words had been intended to go with a soft caress of Sherlock’s cheek, a squeeze of his hand, a soft kiss to his temple; not spoken to a cold gravestone. Whenever he had nightmares like this, he invariably ended up in Sherlock’s room, watching him sleep as his heartbeat slowed down. He would keep repeating
“Around 7, which means you need to get cracking.” Sherlock said, suddenly businesslike. “Hang around her house for a while - I saw some hedges which would suit the purpose perfectly - and make sure she leaves. You mustn’t be seen. We can’t afford to arouse her suspicions. When she’s gone, knock on the door and invite yourself in for a little chat.”
He ignored her. “You went to no end of trouble to destroy Charlotte Oliver. You have nightmares about Sherrinford. Something ghastly happened to you there, something so traumatising that you went to great lengths to obliterate every trace of who you were then. Your particular line of work is significant as well; a psychiatric nurse doesn’t just drop everything to become a dominatrix.”
“We already knew that.” Sherlock muttered. “This just confirms it. The question is - who? Sebastian Moran?”
“No, you are. I wish you’d stop harping on about her. Romantic entanglement with the Woman, even if either of us desired it, would ultimately culminate in complete disaster. I don’t love her and I never have. Surely you know me well enough to see that by now.”
“Er, there’s a man at the desk who doesn’t have an appointment, but he keeps insisting that he has to see you - says it’s a matter of life and death. Shall I send him in?”
John laughed, and they broke apart and set about putting Rosie back to sleep. Finally, they sat down next to each other in the semi-darkness, thoroughly exhausted.
She hesitated for a moment, but then sighed resignedly. “Oh, all right. Sit down, boys. First - I need you to promise me that what I tell you won’t leave this room.”
“Okay, okay. But you know the rest. I’ve told you my love story at least a million times. Now it’s your turn. Tell me yours.”
“Hm. He evidently called a priest before calling the police, so I highly doubt he’ll have anything substantial to tell us.”
Lestrade opened the door and led them into the dingy house, filling them in on the details as he did so. “No murder or robbery this time. Just a break-in. Upton’s sister Bertha died a week ago. Last night, he heard noises from the living room, so he came out to check. It turned out to be Bertha. He scrambled to his bedroom, locked the door from the inside and when he came out, she was gone.”
“Yes, and I need to visit her.” Sherlock said, settling into the armchair opposite his brother, “And I need to take John Watson and The Woman with me.”
“She’s safe, but there’s a very slight possibility of motor damage. They won’t let me see her because I’m not immediate family.” Sherlock replied.
Sherlock wondered if John knew how much courage it had taken just to put his head on his shoulder that night. He was still terrified that he might go too far and John would cut himself off, and he couldn’t let that happen. He just
“I believe you.” he said. “My wife and I chased a phantom for far too long. I’ll need to see the bones, but I believe you. I don’t want another funeral.”
him. What’s that thing he calls himself - a ‘consulting detective’? It’s a load of crap he made up because he couldn’t get a job.”
Sherlock is certain he's blushing from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. He's completely horrified. "No one," he mumbles.
Lestrade began to turn back around. "Alright John, my friend here would- are you alright?" He asked as he met John's wide-eyed stare. John stared at him incredulously. This was not the time for him to be kidnapped. Not when he was already to wrecked with every other emotion on the sodding planet.
He can almost see those words sailing toward his heart in slow motion, about to land and crumble his entire world, rework itself and reform around John Watson.
"Um," John had tried to speak, already deciding right then that there was no way he could live with Sherlock Holmes. Because living with Sherlock Holmes would also mean living with a permanent hard-on and that was not something John could do. And he couldn't very well shag his flatmate. That was an unspoken, unwritten rule of all flat-sharing situations.
"Is that what you're wearing?" Paul raises his brows skeptically with a critical eye up and down John's frame. "It's freezing out. And you'll definitely need some shoes."
Pressed so close and yet feeling so very far away, Sherlock blinks into the dark room, hardly daring to move as he breathes silent shaky breaths of his own, attempting to calm his rapidly beating heart as his body begs for more, more touching, more feeling, more
this is thrilling, watching John squirm and moan because of things Sherlock is doing, making such a beautiful boy find pleasure beneath Sherlock's fingertips. God, he wants to make John come. He wants to bring him to orgasm like he's never wanted anything before, wants to watch John arch his back and roll his hips, wants to hear John make such pretty little noises for him, Sherlock wants it so goddamn
"Absolutely not," Greg snaps. "The only thing he's going to want is to be with you. Otherwise he's going to be in an epic sulk for being out of the tournament and I'd prefer not to deal with that John Watson. So you're staying." He hands a key card to Sherlock and grins knowingly. "He has no idea you're here, he thinks he's still bunking with me. Go surprise him."
John is absolutely gone on that silly boy who might be clever but not as clever as he thinks he is considering he honestly believes he fooled John into falling in love with him.
"Okay, John," he nods, stumbling along the sidewalk as his vision wobbles slightly around the edges. He's going to be lucky if he makes it home without getting sick again.
He chances a glance to see Sherlock blow out a silent breath before nodding more to himself than anyone else. "Okay," Sherlock says. "That sounds good."
Not because they were friends. Not because they were roommates. But because he felt sorry for the stupid drunk genius boy who was dumb enough to get wasted at a party when he'd hardly ever had alcohol before.
John rolled his eyes. "Yeah, great deduction, that. Was it the constant hard-on or the grabby snogs that gave me away?"
," John murmurs, brushing his lips over Sherlock's heated cheeks, "thank you for being patient. I'm so sorry I hurt you in the process, I had no idea you... I- wasn't... just thank you, okay? Thank you. Thank you for... wanting me."
John was staring at him in a mix of complete shock and bubbling furry, small fists clenched at his sides, body looking so frail and broken and yet so fiercely stubborn and defiant, drawing himself up to his full height and glaring hard. Sherlock squeezed his own hands into fists within his pockets, the only outward reaction to John's appearance he would allow, and fixed John was with a skeptical eyebrow.
Running a hand through his hair, John stared down at the table, lost in panicked thought that maybe he should in fact have a plan. What
better. Every moment I spend with him is everything, Mycroft. Everything. He's…" John trails off, losing himself in his blinding love for this one man. "He's brilliant in the cockiest way possible and funny without meaning to be and snarky at the best of times." John's lips curve into a small smile. "He's… when he's focused, it's like magic. When he's at the top of his game he's… enchanting. To watch his brain work is one of my favorite things in the world. He's... perfect. To me, he's perfect."
He chases his lover onto the mattress, Sherlock scrambling on hands and knees across the blankets, following John's instructions perfectly and the rugby player can't help grabbing at pale skin, wrapping hands around hips as he climbs in behind Sherlock, legs folded beneath him. His touch seems to send a jolt through the genius boy and Sherlock moans outright, muscles falling slack as he leans back against John's chest, his back slick with sweat, his body trembling.
Mycroft shot him a dirty look. “Let’s address the elephant in the room, shall we? You two - are you a - a
Sherlock got into the cab, gave the driver some directions, and watched Baker Street fade away. Not having John on a case with him felt...odd. “I really am lost without my blogger.” he muttered to himself. When he drew up at the crime scene - a large, imposing bungalow with a neat garden - Lestrade was already waiting for him.
he decided, running up and throwing the door open. Sure enough, there was a cooking pot on the stove, spewing smoke. He quickly put the lid on and turned off the stove, waiting for the flames to die down. Sherlock came out of the bedroom then, looking rather disoriented, holding a marker.
Sherlock carefully picked her up, trying to do it the way John had taught him. She shushed a little then, and John opened his eyes. “Yes, look after her this once, will you, Mary?” he mumbled. Sherlock’s heart gave a painful pang, and then John turned over and went back to sleep.
He internally breathed a sigh of relief. Harry’s calls usually meant bad news. At least she hadn’t relapsed again.
. He prepared himself not to wince in case John accidentally touched one of the scars from Serbia, but he didn’t need to. John was as careful as he was skilled.
Sherlock had always thought that John’s parents lived somewhere out in the country. When they hadn’t been on the guest list for John’s wedding, he assumed there was some unresolved ongoing family conflict and decided against asking John about it. And his father...so
John was about to agree, but something stopped him. He thought of Baker Street, with its comforting smells and homely mess. Of the case files that littered the cabinets and the bullet holes that covered the walls. Of his laptop, open on the littered kitchen table, his blog counter blinking. Of lazy winter afternoons spent drinking tea and arguing. Of the detective standing by the window, playing some mournful melody on his violin, lost in thought.
“Very.” he said, looking up at Sherlock. He was forcibly reminded of their moment at the breakfast table that morning. His apology had been on the tip of his lips, but he knew that once he started, he would never stop. “So, what time are you meeting Irene?”
She took a sip from the cup John had offered and grimaced slightly. “Not as good as mine, but it’ll have to do, I’m afraid. Well, you two certainly have questions. I suppose it’s no use trying to hide anything. Ask away.”
“Well, don’t make it a date, then. Just take her out for a meal on the pretext of, er, returning her cameraphone.”
it, Sherlock. It’ll give you a sense of finality. If you don’t do it, no one else will, and he’ll go to his grave still searching for his son.”
“Are you sure?” John asked, moving over to sit beside him on the couch. “You couldn’t even remember my girlfriends’ names.”
“We can worry about that later.” Sherlock said, striding into the house. The door was open, and they could see Lestrade and Sally Donovan in the living room, overseeing the forensics team. The French window had been smashed in, and the floor was still littered with tiny shards of glass. The small backyard beyond looked like it had recently been dug up - there were mounds of mud and bags of fertilizer everywhere.
John nodded and turned to leave, obviously still troubled by Eurus’ words. Impulsively, Sherlock reached out and squeezed his hand. “Soldiers, remember?”
Sherlock’s eyes seemed to say. Although John still didn’t like the idea of making Sherlock camp on the sofa, he shrugged and nodded. After all, he had full faith in Sherlock’s abilities to look after Rosie, and he really could use a good night’s sleep. The drugged sleep in the hospital hadn’t quite cut it.
John gripped the steering wheel tightly, glancing at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. For some strange reason, he had rejected the car Mycroft had sent for them and decided to borrow Mrs Hudson’s Aston Martin instead. John, too concerned to bother arguing about it, wouldn’t let him drive. So there they were, speeding down a lonely road at three in the night in utter silence.
“Good. I’ll have Lestrade text you the details.” So saying, Mycroft strolled out, but stopped midway and looked over his shoulder, “This wasn’t an accident.”
- a man as smart as Moran would never pick a fight in clear view of a camera, and he would certainly never lose.”
“You just short-circuited my brain, but please continue.” he managed to say, before John pushed him back into the sheets and proceeded to snog him quite thoroughly. He moved his hand down to John’s chest and felt, to his disappointment,
John would gladly have lain there forever, with Sherlock’s breath gently brushing the top of his head, but he was painfully aware of how parched his throat was. He groaned internally when he realized that it was Monday. He couldn’t skip work again, obviously; he liked to save his sick days for when he was very ill, or if he had to solve a case with Sherlock. He reluctantly slid out of bed and made his way to the kitchen, cringing with every step.
John frowned and ruffled Sherlock’s hair. “That’s a little far-fetched. Are you sure you don’t have a concussion?”
“First Irene Adler, now this guy.” John commented. “It’s frankly a little alarming how easy it is to fake identities now.”
“Rosie won’t be better off.” John interrupted. “Mary made enemies, too. Lots of them. This, right here, with both of us - this is the safest my daughter will ever be. She’s not just my daughter, you know - she’s our daughter. She needs you. She needs both her fathers to look after her. We haven’t done a great job recently, but for her sake, I’d be willing to try again.”
Entering Sherlock’s room without him felt like a strange breach of privacy, although there were close to no personal effects in the room (and he slept there every night anyway). He bent down and fished around under the bed -
“Fine. After she shot me, I was in my mind palace, and then I ended up in a padded cell with Moriarty, and I gave up, I let go. Until he said...he said that I was letting you down, that you were in danger. I couldn’t bear the thought, and I fought again, and I suppose that’s when my heart started up.”
"You know," Victor's syrupy voice filtered into his ears, "I hope you've really thought this through."
"I suppose you wanted to be on your way sooner," Sherlock continues, taking the silence for irritation, "I'll send Mycroft a text about it."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. There wouldn't be any calling until he assessed the situation further. He'd been cultivating a network, spending time and money, investing in trust and promises of information. These people were his responsibility now, his to worry about and take care of. The Hospitals couldn't afford to give them proper care anyway even if he did call an ambulance. Not unless strings were pulled or favors made, which Sherlock was currently running short on, although the fact that his big brother had just been promoted to a rather substantial position in the British government could prove to negate his need for favors altogether.
"Enough, alright?" Greg bites back. "I get it. My boyfriend can act like a real dick sometimes. I just wanted to apologize on his behalf and see if you guys wanted to grab drinks at Paul's with me. I feel like I owe you both after that."
"Oh, Sherlock," Mrs. Hudson tuts. "I know she's important to you." She sighs as she pats his shoulder. "But John is right, she needs exercise. And if he can control her, he should be allowed to take her out. No one else can. She trusts him."
The shell of John Watson made his way to classes for the next two days, not hearing a word from the teachers or students around him, barely registering Molly's concerned looks and fidgeting worriedly.
John's body temperature skyrocketed, his bottom lip blazing as though he'd just been burned by the touch of this unspeakably gorgeous human being. He did everything in his power not to lean into the touch on his cheek.
He watches as his roommate stands from his desk and grabs his book bag, muttering about where his Chemistry textbook has gone, ruffling papers and other odd items along his desk, making more noise than either of them has all day.
"Yes," John groaned, lifting his arms up before Sherlock had even begun to tug. Sherlock pulled back to look at John as he pulled his t-shirt up over his head. John stared right back, allowing himself to be watched. Sherlock needed to be certain that this was okay. He needed to see it in John's face. John could understand that.
Sherlock felt, for the first time, a fissure of rage. Eurus had no right to take someone else’s child away like this. John was right; nothing justified cold-blooded murder.
“Stay.” he said simply, then leaned forward to cup John’s face in his hands and kiss him. Something in his chest flitted back to its usual place, and his muscles didn’t feel quite so tight anymore. He paused to close the small pocket of space between their bodies, foreheads close enough for their eyelashes to brush.
“Well - I was attracted to girls back in high school, too, but I thought it was just a phase...or that’s what I forced myself to think. You know how dad was...anyway, in my last year of college, I met Clara, and things just changed. Or maybe things had been the way that they were for a long time and it took meeting Clara for me to accept them. Oh, I’m getting philosophical again. We were just roommates at first, but then I realized that whatever I felt for her was nowhere near platonic. Interesting parallel, isn’t it?”
to stay over." He gives her another glance over before turning his bored gaze back to the boy turning redder and redder before him. "And I assume she also scrubbed your floors going by the state of her knees."
"Lincoln Jones, Link for short," he replied brightly, shaking John's hand. "You seemed like the only other guy who didn't know anyone so far. Thought I'd take the leap and come bother you. Shall we?"
"Well, that was completely disgusting to watch," Irene grumbles next to him, though the hint of humor in her voice steals the bite from her words.
Blinking for a long moment, eyes trained on Sherlock intensely, John's features shift yet again, finding a new kind of warmth to radiate in the genius boy's direction, the corners of his mouth quirking up in a playful grin, his entire demeanor teasing. "Oh, I'm your
Then he grins. "Brilliant," he breathes his usual reaction to Sherlock's deductions and Sherlock blushes his usual deep blush at John's praise.
It's Sherlock's turn to lace his fingers with John's and press just a bit closer. "I'm sorry your first time wasn't perfect," Sherlock murmurs, pressing a kiss to John's cheek. "You deserve to have nothing but the very best."
Pressing his cheek to John's hair, the genius frowns. "I don't need a jacket," he garbles slightly, the smell of blond fringe in his nose giving him a heady, pleasant feeling. "You're warm enough."
Eyes locked, Sherlock pulled the buttons free from their stitched holes, pulling either side down to reveal cream underpants, tied tightly at the front. He wriggled down off the bed and, averting his eyes, pulled the string and tugged undergarments and trousers all down at once to his ankles.
It didn't take long to regret it. Only a day at most, a day spent with his parents who smiled pleasantly at him over meals and brought him on a picnic and patted him on the back about his exceptional grades.
"So..." John starts, then scrubs a hand down his face and laughs a humorless laugh. "So you thought, this entire time, that I was also sleeping with Mary?"
The blond head between his legs immediately complies, brows pinched in concern as he scrambles back up Sherlock's body to his face. "What? Are you okay? I'm so sorry, did I hurt you?"
A vibration against his thigh shocks him out of his subconscious deep-dive and the genius boy opens his eyes, not remembering when he'd closed them in the first place, pulling his mobile free from his pocket and glancing down to find a text message alert glowing back at him. A soft smile sneaks up along his mouth and Sherlock slides open the screen, biting down on his bottom lip as he reads the text and who it's from.
He continues to whisper his pleas and beg John, even when fingers are pulled free from his body, even when John is pouring lube over a hand and running it over his own erection, even when that same hand runs over Sherlock's aching cock laying against his belly, he can't seem to shut himself up, he can't seem to find any contentment with anything that's going on because he needs John inside of him, he needs to be joined with this wonderful
John laughs. "I bet it is for you," he repeats his mantra, eyes twinkling. "Some poor sod out there is pining for you, Sherlock Holmes."
to moving out of the damned town. He didn't want to risk any complications. So he swallowed his secret back up, and got himself a job at the local grocery store to save some money for London.
John scooted closer, needing desperately to touch Sherlock again, to feel his weight and his breath and his hands and his lips. "Sherlock," he whispered, pressing himself to the boy next to him, lining his chest and stomach and hips along the side of Sherlock's body, suddenly terrfied that he wouldn't know how much John still wanted…no -
?" John is gaping and grinning at the same time, turning to beam in Sherlock's direction, his eyes glinting with a hint of excitement. "You're going all out tonight, huh?"
He bit back those words about to tumble out of his mouth, deciding now was not the time to blurt that out, and brought the conversation back to the original topic. "Okay," he said, running his hand through his hair. "She just had her heart broken. I suppose I can understand the outburst then."
"Yes, well," Sherlock declared, looking down at his papers and shuffling them uncomfortably. "Is that all?"
Grabbing his phone, he scans the message from Lestrade and thanks his lucky stars that his unpredictable job keeps him from falling apart every thirty seconds.
"Mm," was John's only response. The room was spinning now, Link's voice sounding very far away as he continued.
Sherlock's legs fold up and around John's back at their own accord, locking him in place. "No no, don't stop," Sherlock begs, holding John in place. "Just... just give me a minute."
Greg raises a brow in frustration, eyes narrowing into a glare as he says, "Myc is going to lose his shit if I tell him about this and don't give him more information than Sherlock is 'Good and fine.' Seriously, is he alright? Nothing happened with Victor, right?"
"Sherlock, my boy!" Mr. Holmes' booming voice breaks the moment and Sherlock turns with a grin up to his father, accepting his kisses and another familiar hug. "My word, have you grown? You look bigger!"
John blinks, and then hastily nods as Mycroft's icy stare takes on a murderous tone when he doesn't immediately respond.
"Hey!" Molly snaps her fingers in his face. "I'm serious, John. Please, just keep it in your pants."
John felt his body stiffen. There was going to be more of these conversations? With an extremely attractive Major who seemed to want to only hand out partial information?
John looked incredulously at Sherlock. "Seriously. What, is he a spy or something?" He asked sarcastically.
She shakes her head against his touch and he grins. He's missed her so much. The anxious knot loosens in his chest as he breathes her in.
A steady thrum of energy has been coursing through him since dinner. A low frequency that's unnoticeable to outsiders, anyone passing by completely unaware of the way his blood seems to pump in time with John Watson's breathing, pulse rising and falling with every move John Watson makes.
Nodding is all Sherlock can manage and before he can think it through or clamp up or reconsider, the tip of a finger is dipping into him, passing the tight muscled ring of his hole, rubbing every nerve ending surrounding his entrance.
Sherlock suppresses a shrug. Losing Anderson wouldn't have been the worst thing in the world. As long as it wasn't his father. Or Mrs. Hudson. Or J-
He stops in the doorway of the kitchen and turns, offering a shy smile. "You play the violin beautifully, by the way."
He has absolutely zero intention of throwing out the note but he doesn't want John to think him some silly, sentimental teen.
Victor shifts as well, following Sherlock's short movement across the couch, making the hairs on the back of Sherlock's neck raise sharply. "Come on," Victor says, fingers brushing gently over the curly-haired boy's shoulder. "You can talk to me."
"And what about you, then?" John ventures, knowing full well the territory he's about to enter and daring to go there anyhow, a bit desperate to know. Because he doesn't know. He suspects, hell he may even have heard a rather telling conversation on that first day he'd entered their shared room, overhearing a spat between Sherlock and his...whatever Mrs. Hudson is to him. But he doesn't know. And he wants to know. So badly.
It had been a pretty simple journey for John, looking back now. During, it had felt like an eternity of uncertainty and fear. He couldn't pinpoint exactly what day or even what year he realized it, it just sort of became clear out of the haze. He vaguely noticed how good one of his mate's looked in tight jeans or a nice fitted shirt, but he figured it was a passing thought. Just because he thought about another guy occasionally didn't make him gay.
"Okay, I think that's all for today," Sherlock called at the front. "If you have questions, please ask someone else, I have no time for you people today. Oh and don't forget about the mixer next weekend. We're required to go and it's sure to be a miserable affair, so be sure to attend, drink copious amounts of cheap alcohol and act like complete morons. You know, the usual."
"Oh, you fuckers," John huffs, and just like that the team bursts into laughter as Mike slaps him on the back and jostles him good-naturedly.
John's eyes found his again, lips pinned in a thin line, swallowing hard. "I saw you once," he murmured, lips twisting slightly.
It seems unlikely but the proof is in these messages, all short and cold and almost irritated, like John is unnecessarily interrupting Sherlock's day, like hearing from his roommate is some sort inconvenience.
Brows pinched in confusion at his own scattered thoughts, Sherlock flops back against his pillow and digs his toes under his blankets, warmth suddenly enveloping his rather chilly body now that he thinks about it, eyelids growing heavy from all the activity of the evening and the heat surrounding him.
Sherlock stares down at his hands, unable to meet John's gaze, feeling stupider than he has in years.
, as John corrected him seriously earlier in the week when Sherlock had made a face. But still. It's close enough to a game. The rugby players will suit up. There will be an opposing team. The ball will be... thrown? Kicked? Sherlock has no idea. And John will beam up at him in the stands, maybe even wave like this is all in good fun, pleased that he'd gotten his roommate out of their dorm and silently appreciative of the support.
"Actually, I believe now is a perfectly suitable time. Your beloved is preoccupied attempting to impress our already smitten mother, and you have nothing else on."
And these were the moments that Sherlock longed to say that forbidden L word. Those three words John had asked him not to say yet as they sat on the steps of his parent's house, requesting he wait just a bit longer until John's emotional state was back in check.
A giant, thousand-ton weight lifts itself from John's chest and he's suddenly feeling light as a feather. "Oh," he breathes, and even to his own ears it sounds like a sigh of relief. "So- so we're both single, then," he nods, attempting to mask his pleasure. "Good. Great."
"Yeah?" he replied almost dreamily, wanting nothing more then to drag Sherlock by the collar out of this office and into his bed.
Sherlock stayed silent. This was John's story to tell. He didn't need to know Sherlock already knew.
Ignoring the question entirely, Sherlock moved on to questions of his own. "Why didn't you tell me? About John? You knew, didn't you?"
A glass filled with clear liquid, jingling slightly from the ice swirling within it, dripping with condensation is thrust into his view from where he's staring down at his notebook and Sherlock glances up with a frown. "Oh. I said I didn't want anything."
But this, this moment right now, this is why Sherlock had made it his mission to get John here for Christmas.
What this person doesn't know is that Sherlock's heart belongs to the rugby captain he spends only inches from in Chemistry class and at the library with every day.
Sherlock could only nod, finding that he had no words. Not in this perfect moment with this perfect boy. He wanted to run his fingers through his blonde hair, almost shaggy now from lack of haircuts and kiss him until they both couldn't breathe. He eyed him for a long moment, just taking in the sight of him waking up, and imagined what it would be like to wake up in the morning with John, cuddled up in bed, exchanging soft touches and slow kisses. He wondered what John would be like during morning sex. Would he be quiet and sweet and loving? Would he be fast and loud and efficient? What would he be like during regular night sex? What would he be like while Sherlock sucked him off? What would he-
Sherlock tosses his head back again as he moans, gripping John's hands like a lifeline. He doesn't respond verbally, only backs himself up harder, riding against John's movements like some professional clubber and John has to grit his teeth to keep from coming right there in his jeans.
The room sat clean, far cleaner than it had ever been since John and Sherlock had moved in. John's things sat untouched, shoes still lined under his bed, cardigan still slung over his desk chair, bed still made with a slight wrinkle from where he'd flung his bag earlier.
Oh god, and Sherlock had relaxed into him, finally limbs finally loosening and twining tightly around John's shorter frame like a vine, pulling him in, pulling him close and John could have stayed like that forever. He could kiss Sherlock Holmes
But he's friendly enough and can hold a conversation. A bit rubbish at school work but can have a good time at a party. And, bonus, Sherlock has absolutely
"Mm, you like that?" John says with another thrust. "You're such a good boy, Sherlock. Such a good boy, taking it so good for me."
Almost wraps his arms around John's fit waist. Almost presses his front to John's back, sealing them tightly. Almost nuzzles his face into John's neck, kissing behind his ear to make him sigh and smile.
Sherlock's mouth. With difficulty, brow furrowed, John attempted to listen, blinking rapidly, only realizing three sentences later he'd been so focused on focusing he hadn't heard a word Sherlock had said. He rattled his skull, silently berating himself to pay attention, suppressing the irritated growl his throat was begging to make.
shitty for it and for how he's been and he wants this practice to be over as soon as possible so he can go and see Sherlock and start being a real friend and not some pathetic sod going all starry-eyed every time he looks at him.
Sherlock sighs. "Please," he says. That always seems to work with other people. The word please. Lestrade looks so startled, Sherlock says it again. "Please."
"It was a good lecture," Paul mumbles indignantly before falling into laughter with the rest of the team. "Okay, you know what, fuck all of you, alright?"
"Well it's pretty clear that's exactly how you feel," Sherlock grumbled, falling heavily back against his chair.
Huffing out a soft laugh of his own, John shrugs, feeling the knot in his chest loosen slightly, feeling a bit better that he isn't alone. "I have no idea," he grumbles to the ceiling of the bus and Greg sighs beside him.
"You may have a concussion," John says, eyeing Sherlock's movements. "But I don't think anything's broken. You're moving pretty well for someone who's been unconscious for two minutes."
He closed his eyes for a moment; trying to breath past the irrational irritation he felt with essentially everyone he laid eyes on. It was no one's fault that his mind was begging to swallow him up into self-pity. Mike was only trying to help get his mind off what had happened.
The sound of the door handle turning and the click of the light switching off catches Sherlock's attention as he listens to John make his way across the dark room. There's a soft
"Oh fuck, John," Sherlock murmured, head lolling up to watch his cock disappear between John's pink, glistening lips, the sight unbearably erotic. "
"First for what?" Mike garbles, appearing from around the corner and stumbling his way into the small, tight-knit group, though his eyes have lost that dazed look, clearly having sobered just slightly since the last time Sherlock had seen him.
They'd spent the entire time on Sherlock's many experiments around his house including but limited to mold growth on a decaying carcass of a bird in the backyard, and the observation of maggot eating habits.
John was startled momentarily, then nodded his head vigorously, remembering that that was his anthem tonight. "Yes! Cheers to that!"
Truth is, he'd planned to sneak to every single one of John's games that he feasibly could just to get an eyeful of that gorgeous bloke in that number 3 jersey. Though he won't be telling
"John," Sherlock whispers, plucking the small hand lens up with his fingers delicately, not wanting to dirty up the glass or, god forbid drop it, turning it back and forth in the light. Oh yes, this will do. This will do just fine. "It's perfect," he speaks to the lens, flicking it up to find, to his delight, that there are two levels of magnification.
"John," Sherlock breathed and John's eyes snapped to those icy blue irises that crinkled at the edges when he laughed and narrowed when he was irritated and haunted John's bloody dreams and were now staring, lids widening around them, barely blinking.
"He probably just got lost or something," Sherlock shrugs as though this weren't the most exciting thing that has ever happened to him.
He swept up and down the alley, sweat beading his forehead, edging closer and closer to hysteria as the darkness stayed still and empty. If John wasn't back here that meant he may be somewhere Sherlock couldn't get to him...locked away inside someone's house, defenses down, inhibitions all but turned off.
"Yes yes," Sherlock flips his hand dismissively, "now you've met him, are you happy? Can you be on your way?"
Which makes John feel a bit off-kilter as a slow spread of discomfort rides along under his skin, waiting for his mind to catch up with what is so blatantly obvious, the facts falling into a row like a lineup, ticking themselves off as they appear in John's mind's eye.
on refusing to turn, refusing to let John see what a complete mess he is, refusing to look at John, refusing to allow this entire situation to become real. His throat feels like it could close at any moment, shut itself tight and suffocate him, short and quick and Sherlock would welcome death with open arms.
"No!" John says, eyes wide. "No, but...I don't know, I know this is what you want and maybe if we try I could just-"
"You," Sherlock groans into his mouth as John pries it open. "I want more then...I want it all with you. I... I want to be yours."
Although now, right at this moment, it may have done John some good to have an elder nearby. To stop him from staring. To stop him from doing something he'd regret.
"Don't worry," John grumbles from behind him, still standing at the boot of the cab, "I'll get the bags."
"Fine, fine," Sherlock mumbled, strolling toward the back of the building, apparently happy to leave John standing alone.
They lay silently, both catching their breath, sated bodies calming from the roughest fuck they'd had yet. John's arms are wrapped around Sherlock's chest, heat radiating off his skin, but Sherlock can't be arsed to care. He's already drenched in several different fluids. More heat won't hurt.
to Sherlock. Doesn't Irene see that? Doesn't she understand how rare a thing that is? Besides, she wasn't at the party. She doesn't know anything about it.
Sherlock smirks, his legs shaking slightly beneath him and he leans back, planting his palms on either side of John's shoulders, taking some of his weight off of his thighs. He thanks his rigorous ballet practices for the strength in his legs. Who knew it would be such great training for sex?
And just like that, the voices fade to nothing but a dull, garbled roar behind a closed door, shutting out the rest of Greg's sentence and the thought process Sherlock was attempting to make about the conversation at hand.
Sherlock is panting heavily against the tree, eyes still closed, face flushed all the way down his neck and disappearing into his sweatshirt, hands still on John's hips, body tilting forward, reaching for John again.
"Um, hi," John said hesitantly as he took in the sight before him. Sherlock was bundled in a long black coat and a deep green scarf, in the process of pulling on leather gloves. Obviously, he wasn't staying. John's stomach did a somersault. "Sorry, I was just..." That's all he could get out before he realized he couldn't think of an excuse for being there. It had become so natural between them, he didn't know he'd have to make things up to come by anymore.
Some strange feeling welled up inside him, and it took him a moment to realize what it was. Sympathy. Something he normally never felt for clients, but this...this was about his own sister.
? There isn’t any need. It was a long time ago. It took me a while to come to terms with it, but eventually, I got tired of being scared. It was time to face my fears. I had to leave Sherrinford, though. The things I’ve seen...” She closed her eyes and shuddered slightly. “Once you go there, you never really leave. I left on the pretext of a family emergency and never went back. For years, I lived in fear of them finding me. Fortunately, I met Moriarty, and he provided against it.”
From the small smile on his mother’s face, he knew that she approved, and whatever little bit of self-doubt he’d fostered dissolved.
“Yes, of course.” He shoved his phone back inside and followed her into the street, waving his thanks to Angelo. They stepped out into the cold London air.
When he got it, he had thought about showing it to John, but something held him back. What if Mary was wrong and he ended up making a fool of himself? He’d hidden it under the bed because he knew John thought him too clever to choose such an obvious hiding place - or maybe he subconsciously wanted him to find it.
He stopped himself at the last minute and flung it across the room instead. It hit the wall and bounced off, upsetting one of Rosie’s block towers. He heard the screen break with a satisfying
“What’s in those?” he asked curiously, pointing to the heavy backpacks Sherlock had been toting around.
Noel grinned, his words tumbling over each other in his excitement. “Sherlock Holmes in my room - wow. I’ve always thought of a thousand things I’d ask you if we ever met, but honestly, right now, I can only think of one. So you don’t actually wear the hat?”
Right then. He could handle that. No problem. He finished his eggs and tea, snapped his laptop shut and wandered back to his bedroom, feeling prepared, a little anxious but ready to go. He glanced at the clock. 7:30AM. Might as well get a move on.
But the boy stops himself, hand half-outstretched before retracting it, pulling away from Sherlock, pulling away from what they have. Pulling away once and for all.
"Fucking hell," John groans, consumed with the gorgeous body against his, touching like he's never touched before, groping and grinding like mad,
It aches to even think his name, to even hear those four letters ring in his head and before he can talk himself out of it, before he can overthink it, before he can realize how useless it will be, Sherlock's hand is diving into his pocket and retrieving his mobile, swiping it open and tapping to find the contact he needs even as his vision swims. He stabs the Call button and raises the phone to his ear, waiting only a short moment before the line clicks over and a familiar voice comes on.
"Oh Christ, I missed you," John whispers against Sherlock's lips, not moving away for a second, slick bodies still roaming against each other steadily, exploring the newness of being completely naked in one another's presence, wet skin on wet skin building a rumbling heat between them, growing and crackling the air with promises of more. Deft fingertips crawl up Sherlock's spine one vertebrae at a time with massaging little circles, swirling Sherlock's warming insides all up like fallen leaves on a windy autumn day, and goose pimples bubble up along his frame in utter delight at the touch. He pulls John's face impossibly closer, twirling their tongues together heatedly, kisses taking on an edge they hadn't held before, lips trading filthy promises back and forth between waiting mouths.
He stays very still, replaying the events in his head and still can't quite understand. He thought he'd done pretty well, judging by Sherlock's reaction and quick release.
It doesn't stop the happy little bubble forming in his chest. "No, it's not," he argues half-heartedly, turning back to his desk.
He caught a blonde head jumping out of a black car and his insides went cold. He scowled at the car as it passed him, unable to see inside the tinted windows but knowing his brother was staring right back smugly. He rushed to John.
As their breathing evens, somehow John finds himself holding them both up instead of collapsing onto Sherlock’s back. John is murmuring praise after praise upon Sherlock until he gently slips out of him and turns him around to kiss him slowly and deeply before moving to the sink and quickly cleaning himself off and then returning to Sherlock’s side and washing him up and redressing him while planting soft kisses everywhere. Smiling because as usual this was perfect and he can’t believe no one’s banged on the door yet demanding them to hurry up.
Sherlock growled, flicking his gaze up to meet John's and running the silver ball of his tongue ring over the slit of John's cock. John sucked in a sharp intake of breath, and Sherlock took him back in his mouth, hallowing his cheeks and sucking enthusiastically, taking him all the way to the hilt. John tightened his grip as he flooded Sherlock's mouth, unable to stop the small thrusts of his hips as he came hard.
Eventually, a doctor came in and cleared his throat. Sherlock rose to leave, but the doctor smiled at him. “It’s alright, you can stay here while I examine your boyfriend."
The knowledge that Sherlock shared his murderous feelings for the cabbie warmed John’s heart. “If someone wanted to kill me, there are easier ways to do it.” he said, “What was it really about, then?”
“Doesn’t she look like Irene Adler?” John asked, breaking eye contact. “I mean, she’s chubbier, has blonde hair, but if you look closely, it’s the same woman. Also, Oliver told me that he had a daughter named Charlotte. Her mother walked out when she was a baby, and Charlotte rarely came home after college. Kept in touch with him, though.”
They sat in silence for a while, John’s eyes tracing the familiar constellations, and he decided he’d have to bring Rosie here someday. His view was blocked when Sherlock turned to sit cross-legged in front of him, looking rather hesitant.
“Yes, but that had nothing to do with her being my first girlfriend. Look, if you’re anxious that you and Sherlock Holmes won’t work out because he’s the first boy you’ve ever dated, don’t be. Clara and I - we got married too young. Our relationship was the normal, cliche puppy love - romantic dates, mundane everyday problems, etcetera, etcetera. You and Sherlock, on the other hand -”
“- and I took it out on you. No, it’s not okay, not even remotely. Don’t you see? I hurt you. Not just because I hit you, but because I shut you out when you were just trying to help. You ended up in a
The cab had barely drawn up at the gate to St. Bart’s, but Sherlock was already out of the car. He practically flew up the driveway and through the doors, down to the reception area, where he prepared himself to push his way to the front of the line. However, he didn’t need to, for Molly Hooper was already waiting for him. She looked tired and drawn, and as soon as she saw him, her face clouded over.
“Yes, but it doesn’t matter, I’m gay.” He spotted something on the street, got up abruptly and pulled John with him, hurriedly putting some money on the table as he went. “That’s our signal. Let’s go.”
As Irene drove away, he scrambled out of the hedge, trying to straighten his clothes and shake the leaves out of his hair. He strolled up to the main door and rang the doorbell, and a red-eyed Mr Oliver opened it. In the living room behind him, John could see a bottle and a half-empty glass resting on the table.
“I can’t not fret. There’s still so much that we don’t know. What about the colours? Why do they keep alternating between red and yellow? I doubt it’s for aesthetic value.”
But the moment had passed, so Sherlock cast around for an excuse. “Help.” he finally said, “You’ll need to coach me about what to do on this date thing.”
“I’ve only killed one.” John retorted. He grabbed some food from the kitchen/chemistry lab and settled into the armchair opposite Sherlock. “Any ideas about this new case, then?”
Sherlock had spent the last three days delving deep into the Adams siblings’ background, but he couldn’t find much information. There was definitely nothing to link them with Yardley Oliver and his family. The only similarity between the crimes was the fact that both Bertha and Susan had died recently, so that their death was still fresh in their families’ minds. He had tried to think of a motive to explain the break-in, but there was none. Nothing had been stolen, nobody murdered, no lasting harm done - except to Upton’s psychology. He would have to assume terrorizing him to be the prime motive, then.
The doors of the elevator softly clicked open, and as they stepped out into the solitary cell, Sherlock quickly checked that the glass was still in place. It was a habit he’d picked up since his first meeting with Eurus. Irene’s face was as impassive as ever, but her lack of expression and the fact that she was staring fixedly at a point somewhere above Eurus spoke volumes. Her composure was cracking.
“I’m very sorry, Mr Trevor.” he said. “But it’s the truth. If it would help you, we could hold a proper funeral. Mycroft will bear the full cost.”
“I’ve got you, John.” Sherlock whispered, “Keep a tight grip on Noel. We’re going to get out of the water, just keep swimming.”
He unlocked his door and peeked out. The kitchen was empty, the flat oppressively silent, and he was forcibly reminded of John’s wedding and the loneliness it had entailed.
That night, John woke up sweating and breathing hard. He’d seen it happen again - Sherlock’s body whooshing through the air and smashing on the pavement, spread-eagled and broken.
“Who knows about Redbeard?” Mycroft asked him. “And I want the full list; don’t limit it to your adversaries.”
“Yea, remember that time when an American attacked you and Sherlock threw him out of the window?” John added, “I was right
They were both so engrossed that they didn’t notice the door opening - Mrs Hudson came in and awwed, closely followed by Mycroft. He cleared his throat, causing them to spring apart.
“Y O U A R E - wow, we don’t even have to rearrange this - ” John said, “You are - what? What are we?”
