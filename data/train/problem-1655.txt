“Consider it considered,” Holmes answered, face a ripple of slow puzzlement as he watched his brother depart. “That was most peculiar,” he said after Mycroft had left and they were alone again, and Watson nodded slowly.
He didn’t think, he just moved, a kaleidoscopic blur of corybantic energy that carried him up the steps and into the room where Holmes sat in a cane-backed wheelchair, broken and bloody and moments away from true death. Newman’s hands were on his shoulders, already pushing him forward and Watson’s vision went red.
Holmes took a fortifying breath, labeled those particular memories as irrelevant and shunted them aside; now was not the time. He stepped over to the bed and raised the lamp, examining Watson’s features under the soft yellow glow.
"Well, I might ask that you be more discreet in your disposal next time, should circumstance force your hand again."
Holmes watched him carefully. Presently he said, “Your presence in my mind brought a certain amount of clarity I had been lacking. I was suddenly struck with how different we were, how strange it felt to encounter the presence of another where I had only ever felt myself. And suddenly I felt certain that I
"Perhaps," he said softly. Then he kissed Holmes again on his ear, licking along the ridges and pulling the lobe into his mouth. Holmes' knees went weak and he grabbed onto Watson's jacket in an effort to keep his feet, but Watson held him up with one arm as though he weighed nothing more than a babe.
The letter opener on Montressor's table had been sharpened to a fine point; punched into the carotid artery by a man of Mister Montressor's build, it would puncture the skin easily enough, and so Kramer died a painful death, bleeding out in a dingy alleyway while Montressor traded away his soul in pursuit of a zealot's justice. But the frame did not work because Watson was not a suspect; the police had not yet found any connection between him and the two dead men. They didn't even know they were supposed to be looking for one. Why then had Montressor not come forward with an anonymous tip, pointing them in the doctor's direction?
“Back to this, are we?” Holmes said, and Watson had the feeling there was a story in those words, an old one that spanned many years...the kind of story shared between brothers.
"Don't- there is no apology. Come here." It was as articulate as he could be under the circumstances.
"What were you doing before you were shot?" Holmes asked idly, and Watson sensed a deeper meaning behind his words, some distant point at which he was driving, but he could not see it.
Watson referred to his notes once more. “Nearly empty; a half-digested pastry, that’s all, though remains of his breakfast were found in the small intestine.”
"'For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life'," the vicar quoted, looking down at Holmes. "You cannot deny that you are a man of many sins; I know it well."
“I wanted to keep an eye on things,” Watson answered cryptically, wiping his blood stained hands on a rag.
"Organism I think is the most accurate term. It is not a disease; too much about your biology has changed. A disease that produced such profound differences in you would have killed you as well. Infection again is the wrong word. Infection destroys. Infection kills, or is killed. You however have neither rid yourself of affliction nor succumbed to it. You instead have achieved symbiosis with it; I would wager not everyone does."
"Only a fool doesn't believe in the inherent sin of man. What makes you think you are heaven-bound?"
"I am not the one who holds him under a thrall!" Mycroft retorted. "He can ignore my words, and frequently does. He
“Have you not always cautioned me against twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts?”
"Oh Holmes," Watson said, and he sounded as though his heart would break. He held him close and kissed him again. "I don't
“I’ve nothing against the medical profession; doctors are a necessary feature of any civilization. However, I-” his voice faltered slightly.
Watson felt it necessary in interject at this point. “Not if Holmes was responding to my unconscious desires, rather than my verbal ones.”
"I hope this is morphine," he said, as he brought it over, squinting down at it and Holmes craned his neck for a better view, felt a sharp twinge in his chest as he moved.
Watson was still blinking at him dumbly when Holmes gave a sudden hiss, face contorting in pain and Watson reached for him without thinking. Of course he did. He had done nothing but reach for Holmes since the two of them first met. It was entrenched now, an automatic response.
The man turned and opened the door wordlessly, eyeing Watson with open mistrust. Holmes hesitated, recalling the uncomfortable restriction of the Diogenes’ protective wards. If Mycroft wished to betray him, all he had to do was ward the front door. Watson would be unable to defend himself, and Holmes unable to come to his aid.
"Yes," Lestrade nodded, giving Holmes a sideways look. "It's the body. We can't figure out how on earth it got there. We haven't even managed to get it
Mycroft gave him a disapproving look. “Your preoccupation with the doctor has slowed your mind, brother. The answer is obvious.”
"The poor doctor must have been terrified. He quit just last night, you know. Must have been planning to get out of the city."
In the inner room, Sturgerson looked up from the sheaf of papers he’d been reading through as Mycroft lumbered in from the foyer.
"He was drinking blood?" Holmes asked, watching with mild serenity as Montressor raved. "When was this?"
Mycroft remained unmoved. “No vampire has any love for its own kind outside its clan, and precious little within it. They kill each other nearly as often as they kill mortals and it is the only reason the Earth is not overrun with them. Those who live to an advanced age do so through cunning, brute force, and the size of their clans. Even within clans themselves, there is constant competition for status and favor. Whose clan does this “doctor” belong to?”
“I do not think so. You say vampires treat their thralls as food and tools, if such is the case then we can conclude our own situation to be unique.”
"Damn" he swore under his breath, tossing some coins at a convenient cabbie and making for Watson's surgery in all haste.
If James Moriarty was indeed the enemy who waited outside London, things were far more dangerous than any of them had realized.
“So that is why you deigned to visit me in the hospital yourself,” Holmes mused. “And yet, you trusted me then. Ah- of course. The carriage; much like this room, you had it warded against thralls. Very clever.”
Holmes then examined the neck, hands and feet, a crease forming between his brows. He checked the bottom of the man’s shoes, found something of interest and pressed it to his tongue before turning his head and spitting.
Watson was at something of a loss. But it was Holmes, so no great upset there. “But- no. No, I remember. I said, ‘best not risk it’. That- that could be misconstrued-”
Holmes could do nothing but comply, his chest rising and falling as his breath settled into to a rhythm that was not his own.  It happened impossibly quick, the space between one blink and the next. Watson’s lips were suddenly against his neck, and there was a moment’s hesitation before his teeth broke through flesh. Holmes gasped, a sharp inhale of breath and it most definitely hurt...but the pain was not entirely unpleasant. There was something erotic to the blending of pleasure and pain, almost sexual in it's effect and his body responded accordingly, heart rate jumping, blood starting to pump through the wound in his neck that much faster.
"Quite, though less than it was initially. I can tolerate twilight and the early morning, but even if it were less painful, the urge to sleep is more than enough motivation to keep me away from the day."
"A number of small observations. For example, he does not attend Sunday Mass, and he misquotes his scriptures." At Watson's questioning look Holmes tilted his head back and recited, "'But if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.' John. 1:7; Newman got it wrong."
His brother snorted. "If you were it would be no less than you deserve for putting yourself in such a predicament. Servitude to a vampire...and willingly done, if you are to be believed. Which - I think it safe to say, brother mine - you most certainly are
“Very well,” said Holmes, “Though I question the integrity of the experiment." But after a moment the library shifted again, and this time it did not stop, whirling about like a dervish and Watson smiled appreciatively.
. They had barely known each other a month but already Watson was beginning to recognize the detective’s distinctive brand of frenetic chaos.
sporting with him, even if his comments were genuine. Watson pressed his lips together, unused to being the subject of ridicule, but let the detective have his fun. It was no more than he deserved, anyway.
, he thought dizzily. The apex predator, the ultimate beast of prey. It wouldn't waste energy on the hunt, wouldn't expend itself in pursuit and physical submission. It would Compel its prey to offer itself willingly; to hold still while it drained the life away. He let his eyes fall shut, head lolling to the side as he panted. He could feel the blood leaving his body but couldn’t find it within himself to care overmuch. His mind quieted, raging rivers of thought turning slow and red.
"Coercion is not 'willing'," Holmes replied scathingly. "Hurt a man enough, he will beg for death. But no one tortured into a thing does so voluntarily."
Watson sighed. "No, it's alright. If we must do this, I would prefer clarity as well." He put the paper down, shifting slightly because he now had nothing else to say, and no further reason to stall. Holmes was as resolute now has he had been before, and it was nothing more than wishful thinking on Watson’s part that had led him to hope otherwise.
“What can you tell me of him?” Holmes asked, and the man hiked an eyebrow at the boldness of the question, Holmes’ lack of concern for propriety or guile.
Holmes screamed too, feeling the vampires pain as it withered and died as surely as he had felt its hunger while it lived. But the connection was purely a mental thing, and he was free of it once the pathetic creature was gone.
That night Holmes slipped away again, and in the morning Mr. Blevins was absent from his post. The money in his room remained untouched in an old tin, but his new coat was missing- it would be found later that day in an alley not far from the church, grey wool marred with a streak of blood. But of the man himself, there was no sign.
“He was sent to the parish to investigate the death of Nelson Langley,” Mycroft explained, “and had he lived, I believe he would have uncovered the truth.”
“What good can you possibly do right now?” he heard himself ask, words sounding far more accusatory than he’d intended and he wasn’t certain which one of them he was talking to.
Her lips pressed inward and she gave a small nod. He had the impression she was not a woman used to hearing those words.
There was light below, and a low moaning sound, and Newman’s voice echoing up the stairwell, “-giveth thy blood, and he shall be cleansed.”
"I am hardly willing to turn you loose upon the world again. No, I mean to keep an eye on you, at least until this mess you've caused is sorted to my satisfaction. You are also a player in whatever darkness has enveloped the church, and I need you nearby least your part proves pivotal. Newman was less than honest about you, and I intend to discover why. I have my own theories, but I require more facts of the matter. In that vein, a man who can read the thoughts of others may prove invaluable."
"Holmes," said an exasperated and much harangued Inspector Lestrade, talking already before the door was full open. "Sorry to bother you so early, but I -" he stopped as he took in Holmes' haggard appearance, voice dropping to a whisper. "Good Lord! Are you alright?"
Lucy Montressor greeted him with a warm smile. "Mr. Holmes!" she said pleasantly. "How nice to see you again. I'm afraid James isn't home just yet."
After a brief stretch of silence they neared the end of the street, and Holmes asked the pivotal question. "And was it your husband who convinced Langley to pursue the doctor?"
The vicar left and Holmes applied himself the task of cleaning his plate, displaying an appetite that was rarely present in his day-to-day life. After that he did very little, content to doze by the fire, the very picture of a penniless degenerate who was only grateful to have a full belly and a warm place to sleep.
He cursed and flung the pen away. He was still thinking about Sherlock Holmes. Thinking about the way the detective would be smirking at him right now, supercilious smile tucked into the corner of his mouth, hands in his pockets as he watched Watson make an immortal fool out of himself.
He knew he should hate this feeling, knowing his mind was not his own, that this infatuation was born of something other than himself and yet, he did not. Though he also accepted that as the thrall faded, he would likely begin to feel differently.
"I know with absolute certainty that he is," the vicar said, voice steady with conviction. "And I know that he still lives, inasmuch as these creatures can be considered alive."
”I’m in need of a someone to split the rent and was hoping he could go halves with me on the rooms. What do you
Holmes gave a mirthless smirk, a twisting feeling of pain in his chest. His heart hurt. “And you? Do you have similar mental abilities?”
It was late evening by the time his brother arrived. Mycroft Holmes was a tall, ponderous gentleman with thick features and an obviously surfeit appetite. But despite their differences in size, the similarities were striking if one looked below the surface, past the layers of idleness and fat. Mycroft Holmes had the same nose as his brother, the same mouth and chin...and the same eyes; every inch as piercing and calculating as the detectives’ own.
“I know more now than I did five minutes ago. Your role in government, the one you created for yourself. I have always known you did more than audit books and dispense wisdom. Nor is this a mere gentleman’s club for misanthropic recluses. You safeguard London’s borders from vampiric threats, and this place is your sanctum sanctorum. That is why the spoken word is forbidden, is it not? What better way to avoid falling victim to a vampire's Order than to disallow speech? How many of the men here are vampire hunters by night?”
"It is a common weakness among the less fortunate," Holmes agreed. "But if he were headed to the bottle, he would have taken money as well."
Watson shuddered again. What Holmes said actually did make a fair bit of sense, in a fashion. But that did not mean he was comfortable with the idea. "I still don't like the thought of a 'thing' being inside me..."
"I know," he said with regret, kissing Watson's cold fingers, "I know, though I wish it were otherwise."
It was only a small amount, just enough to prevent infection, to make the pain bearable. He had to be careful; too much blood and he risked invoking a thrall and Holmes would probably not forgive him. No, he could not
me." It was said too hurriedly, with too much vehemence but there was nothing for it now. Watson had long ago ceased to think of himself as anything other than Holmes' friend and ally, and it didn't sit well with him that Mycroft might feel otherwise.
Diogenes,” Holmes said aloud, confirming what until now had only been speculation. The man’s interest in the occult, his knowledge of wards and spells and the sudden appearance of the burgundy waistcoated man all pointed to the fact the Montressor – most likely unwittingly – had killed a member of Mycroft’s inner circle.  He wondered how many other such agents he was going to meet with...probably quite a few, if he were to continue keeping company with a vampire.
"He certainly is. As for the sire's crest I mentioned before; with two snakes, entwined around a castle. Do you know of it?"
"Just around the corner, eh? Qu'elle coincidence.” He turned and arrowed toward the bedroom, talking as he went. “And a church you say? When was the body discovered?"
He was roused by a sharp slap across the face, and when his vision cleared Newman sat crouched over him like a gargoyle, mouth twisted into a permanent sneer.
Holmes cocked an eyebrow, for that was no answer at all. "Forgive me, Mister-" he let the sentence hang, waiting.
"I should expect such dishonesty from you," Lestrade growled, skin flushing deep crimson. "Go on, get out of here."
"Yes or no!?" Holmes barked. "Would it be possible for him to approach you unnoticed if you were feeding?"
Holmes squinted down at the birds. They were well fed, but the coop itself was in shabby condition and in sore need of a proper cleaning. The parrot fared little better; its cage was relatively clean of droppings but the creature itself had gone bald in places, the surrounding area covered in brightly colored feathers.
Holmes sniffed again, scratched his cheek and placed a strong embargo on all thoughts of Watson's eyes or the color blue. Then he began to talk. "That he is a local man is beyond doubt. He is dressed in typical city fashion and his hat comes from a shop near Hanover Square; note the haberdasher's initials on the inside brim. Then there's the stub of an underground ticket in his jacket pocket but no train schedule, we can surmise then that he knew his way around - only locals dare the trains without a syllabus.
Lies! I told him everything. He is a man of God. Surely a man of God would know how to banish evil..."
Watson refused to be rebuffed. He’d had time to think before coming over and he knew his own mind. He wanted to be of use to Holmes, and
Holmes sighed, scowling down at the bit of paper in something like offense.  He was forced to concede that however perfect a predator Watson may be, he was utter shit as a detective. The doctor had managed to tell him precisely nothing about Kramer he did not already know.
Her eyes took on a conspiratorial quality and she looked quickly around before leaning in, a hand cupped to the side of her mouth. "Ever since the old shop hand
"I am sorry I am not Stamford," Watson said quietly. "And that I have caused you so much trouble; more than you deserve. Please, let me do what little I can for you."
"Tending birds," he replied, then got to the point. "Tell me about the particulars of your confrontation with Father Newman. Where and when did it take place? What was said?
"I don't think filling the attacker's mind with endless information on a subject is a good idea if they are probing for something you do not wish to share..."
"The... easiest way to do this will be for you to drink from me; the amount of blood needed to cure all your wounds is extensive, and trying to drip it into your injuries would be needlessly messy."
“Fascinating,” Holmes murmured, and laced their fingers together, marveling at how quickly he had become accustomed to the doctor’s cold touch; how welcome he now found it. He closed his eyes and attempted to sense Watson in the same way, to look for him with something other than his eyes.
"And to think this is reportedly the finest hospital in London. All the more reason to spirit me away to Baker Street.”
"Sorry," he said shortly before snapping the wood in two, hefting one splintered, jagged end in his hand and plunging it into the tortured vampire's heart. It howled in agony, the walls shaking with the power of its screams as its skin smoked and crackled, turned black and then, finally, disintegrated into ash.
Conclusion: Watson was experiencing something akin to hibernation and while the dark presence that animated his dead flesh slumbered, he was but a hair’s breadth from true death.
The straps would not tear no matter how he pulled at them. “I can’t- the leather won’t budge,” he admitted at last. “It must be something to do with the writing on them. A protective spell of some sort. I can’t touch the silver either, I’m sorry.”
"Right, very helpful," Lestrade bit out. "I'll be sure to have our men wasting their time in billiard halls."
Watson actually looked quite flattered by that, an almost boyish smile lighting his face, something soft and genuine and Holmes could finally see traces of the man Watson had once been beneath the predator's skin. "Thank you," he said, seeming deeply gratified.
Holmes moved past all of that, unconcerned. He finally found what he was looking for in a passage written some four months previous. Here the handwriting became suddenly and violently distressed, words an inky smear where the author’s hand had passed through them, marring the page.  Beside him Watson leaned forward, and together they carefully deciphered the tortured writing.
It was not the reaction he had hoped for, though he knew well enough it was the only one to expect. He waited a moment, watching Holmes write then trudged doggedly forward, wanting to unburden himself, confess while Holmes was still his own man, capable of feelings and actions that were more than an extension of Watson's desires. "You probably don't remember, but you asked me to stay, that night in the hospital."
with you inside your skin. Were we to take a purely theological point of view we would call it possession, but I do not see why it must be attributed to an affliction of the soul. It is clearly a physical thing."
"I do hope you have removed any personal artifacts you wish to be spared from the flames," he said without preamble.
He man looked at him again, eyes and voice steady. “I believe you ought to be damn careful who you talk to, if you’re going to be following Kramer’s trail.”
“Vicar says the doors were locked tight as a drum last night,” Lestrade said, puffing over again. He looked around at the crowd still milling about and nodded toward the corpse. "Shall we get him to the morgue now?"
Holmes' shoulders twitched out a shrug. "I do not know. But there is little practical difference in having no chance and taking none."
Newman raised his arm, a shillelagh of knotted blackthorn in his hand. “For the blood of the covenant is poured out for the forgiveness of sin,” he began, but that was quite enough of that.
"It is not close to, but as you wish a list of things I would not do, eating pears must be on it somewhere. I see no reason to invite unpleasantness by being vague."
“But did you really suspect nothing?” he asked curiously. It seemed unlikely Stamford could have kept up a similar charade with Holmes of all people. Certainly not while living with the man.
"I'll go get you some water now,” Watson said hastily, strange twisting feeling in his stomach. He stood and slipped away, busied his hands with filling a cup from the kitchen downstairs. From Holmes' condition Watson surmised he’d likely had neither food nor water the whole of the day.
He trailed his fingers down Holmes' face and Holmes melted against his hand with a sigh that sent shivers down Watson’s spine. Gliding his thumb over Holmes' bottom lip he could feel his damp breath, still hot and just this side of quickened. Holmes was so alive, so enticing and the scent of their joined blood thrumming through his veins was sweeter than honey...but he didn’t want to
Through the accumulation of days he became a figure of both curiosity and derision at the library, patrons stealing glances from the corner of their eye, others openly staring as he poured over texts from around the world written in half a dozen languages. Fortunately Holmes had never found the pursuit of knowledge to be an embarrassment, however unseemly, impolitic or outright dangerous it might be and thus was wholly unconcerned with other’s opinions on the matter.
“Your lies, Mister Holmes. You entered my church under false pretense, took advantage of my hospitality...and yet all that might be forgiven. But you are a man much burdened by evil, and the devil's touch, are you not? The sin of deception is a particularly dark stain upon the soul, for how can Christ’s love reach a deceitful heart?”
The man seemed only mildly surprised. “Investigating - I see. You’re a detective?” he asked, running a cursory eye over him. “Don’t look like a Yard man.”
"And tell them what?" Holmes breathed though his nose for a moment before continuing, "Lestrade knows I was working a case involving the church. The vicar and Newman both vanish, and I appear at a hospital as you see me. And there will still be...no evidence...of their crimes."
"'The secrets we keep tell more than the truths we speak?'" Watson quoted with a smile, but good humor seemed lost on the detective tonight, his face shrouded in shadow and his countenance grim. Holmes was only half listening to him anyway, his attention focused elsewhere - on the case and the church and the problems before him.
If Nock had a skill, it was that he had learned how to be silent. How to creep up on an unsuspecting man (or woman) and not be heard until it was much too late. It was a skill that had both saved his own life and ended others, and he had gotten so good at it that it had earned him a small reputation among the other criminals in the dilapidated corner of London he called home. ("The only 'nock you'll never hear", is how the joke went.)
But Holmes dismissed that with a flick of his fingers. "By train a man is no more than a day’s ride from anywhere in the Isle," he pointed out. After a brief stretch of silence he sighed and shifted on the settee. "I must speak with Mycroft," he said, and Watson blinked in surprise.
Holmes would be able to find almost every drop, if given enough time. Most other men would be nonfunctional lunatics under the weight of such a mind. Holmes was a functional one.
Lestrade blanched, nose wrinkling in disgust. "Good Lord. What monster could do that to his own son!?"
Holmes stared at him expectantly until Lestrade moved off to find someone to ask. Then he rifled quickly through the man’s pockets, finding exactly what he expected to. On the whole, it was almost criminally cliché.
Holmes didn't look up from his assortment of beakers as he answered. “Because he will have no choice. He is moved by either compulsion or necessity and either way, his hand will soon be forced; it has been too long. When he strikes again, we shall know of it and hopefully intercept him before he can complete his dark mission."
Watson glanced over a sheaf of paper on the table next to him, reading aloud. “Single contusion to the back of the skull, consistent with a sudden fall. Small abrasions on the hands and forearms, and bruises on the knees and shins.”
"Tell me, Mister Holmes, do you believe in the supernatural?" The question was asked with all due respect, but the doctor’s tone made it plain what answer he expected.
Mycroft frowned but held his opinions to himself; Holmes already knew them anyway. “You still must eat,” he badgered, and Holmes obliged him, taking dutiful bites as Mycroft watched him with a penetrating gaze.
“Good evening,” he said easily, pulling the man's stomach out and setting it aside. "You must be Mr. Holmes.” A faint smile teased the doctor’s lips as he added, “Inspector Lestrade has warned me about you.”
The doctor pursed his lips. "We can talk of it, but until your wounds heal over I am reluctant to agree, unless you hire a doctor of your own."
“They are readying their clan for war,” Holmes surmised, then louder, “The vampire kept in Saint Cyprian’s clergy house was insane; that might go a way to explaining the epidemic of madness that suddenly gripped the church.” Montressor, Langley, the Vicar...all of them feeling the subtle corrupting influence of a vampire driven mad with hunger.
“A predicament,” Holmes repeated, and though he appeared outwardly calm, Watson could feel his heightened emotion, the intensity with which he focused on Mycroft’s words. “And what is the nature of this...predicament?”
“Be that as it may, I know now, and have involved myself much as you feared. The question before you now is will you stand beside me, or in my way?”
"I do not wish you to put yourself at risk either. But if we do not go, he has made it clear he will consider it an act of war. Had we more time I would advise you to make yourself scarce a week or two until the thrall fades; should I plead my case to him in my rational mind he would better listen. But we cannot say what will happen between now and then."
Holmes smiled, well ahead of the doctor. "I have already taken such into consideration, It will not be difficult to fake a convalescence."
Holmes made an inscrutable noise in the back of his throat. "You do look pale,” he remarked. “Please, tell me everything to do with the business.”
The vicar was unmoved. "We can play this game if you like, though it will hardly spare you from His judgment. 'Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you'. We both know there are those among us who drink the blood of men, don’t we, Detective.” He leaned in close. “Where is the Doctor?"
"Very well. Then tell me firstly who precisely is in pursuit of you, and when you became aware of it."
A sound like snapping finger bones and Watson blinked, feeling something wet coat his fingers and he thought with detached confusion
, "If you won’t share your theories about motive, do you care to share the plan regarding said interception?"
"Just over a week," Newman said in his strange monotone voice. "Here - we can speak to the vicar on our way, he will be grateful to hear someone is looking into Blevins' disappearance."
Holmes sat there, blank-eyed and jaw working soundlessly and for a  moment he looked terribly young. “He was only trying to protect me.”
They tarried until the very last moment, until dawn was a pale sliver of grey over the horizon and Watson’s eyes grew heavy with impending sleep.
Holmes' smile was a forgery, smooth and transparent. "Allow me to elucidate then. Nelson Langley made his living chiefly as a hired gun; a bounty hunter and - on occasion - a mercenary. Not entirely a legal profession, and certainly one that might incur a good deal of 'enmity'."
Mycroft spared him a staid half-glance. “It is gratifying to know your brains still work, if properly agitated.”
"And how do you suppose he will attempt to dispatch you?" Everything about the doctor rubbed him the wrong way, from his obvious madness to his insufferable belief Holmes owed him something.
"I am ready," Holmes said, which was all well and good because Watson certainly wasn’t. But keeping Holmes alive was important, and surely any invading vampire
And then Newman simply wasn’t there anymore. Holmes heard a loud and sickening crack that registered in the back of his mind as a skull shattering on stone, but that didn’t mean anything to him. All that mattered was the demon’s voice in his head, screaming for his blood.
"Over a month ago," Montressor said, pacing his sitting room, wringing his hands. "Two months...who can say? I have waited, kept my Lucy under watch this whole time, not allowed her out at night - you must do these things! To stop them from changing!"
But for the first time in days he wasn't in pain, and that was a good thing. Eventually, he even managed to fall asleep.
"As his confessor," Holmes interjected, "Deighton would have had a great deal of influence over Montressor. The man was not of sound mind, and who would know that better than his own priest? Likewise Deighton would know what to say to agitate his madness to the tipping point."
Surprisingly, that made him laugh out loud and for a moment he looked very human indeed. "Very well," he said with a nod, "It's Watson- Doctor John Watson. And yes, I do hold a valid medical license."
"W-whether I am bound for heaven or hell...is not for you to decide, nor by your hand will my course be reversed. “
Holmes smiled to himself, glad that Lestrade had gathered those particular threads together on his own, as that made Holmes' job all the easier. “Oh, is there now?”
“You need a surgeon,” he argued, “And you cannot be found here at the scene of such a bloody crime. I can take you to a hospital and return to dispose of the bodies; it won’t take more than an hour or two, and I’ve the whole night before me.”
"Indeed, though it may run further than even sadism. I do not know. There is much about this business that has me curious."
beat,” Holmes commented, “though too slowly to sustain a human; certainly not quick enough to facilitate the movement of blood through your limbs. Does piercing your heart cause true death?"
"I'm flattered. Should you wish to be truly grateful you will fetch me those papers so that I might have something to do of an evening while I convalesce."
“I don’t know why I bother to be surprised anymore,” Watson sighed, “though the last part is no mystery. You already know I do not kill when I feed.”
Holmes tossed him a sideways glance full of sharp, conniving angles that made Watson think Holmes knew exactly what he was thinking. "Understood. But if their intent were to kill me, I should think quite poorly of the sire’s intellect.” He read Watson’s questioning look and explained, “They’ve every reason to believe me to be your thrall, and that makes me the only person known to them who would have knowledge of your whereabouts. If they cannot find you, I become their only link to doing so. I will be of no use to them dead.”
"Are you proposing vampirism is a disease such as that?" Watson said, deeply affronted. "I assure you, I am perfectly in control of my faculties."
“Of course I do. Doctor Jackson is dead and he must stay that way. Two other men have just died and there must be an explanation. I am injured and there must be an explanation for that as well. In none of these explanations is there room for you. Ergo, if you do not wish the torching of your house and practice to have been in vain, you will follow my instructions precisely.”
He braced his hands on the slick tiles and hauled himself up the last few feet onto the roof, leaving the ladder behind. Below him the firemen bellowed in dismay, cursing him for a madman while the crowd gasped in horrified delight. They might yet see a man fall to his death this morning, how thrilling!
The lights were on in the surgery once again, and the good doctor opened the door just as Holmes reached the top step. Holmes thought to himself
"Hmmm," Holmes replied dismissively, brushing Gregson aside and peering up at the corpse. "What is being done to retrieve it?"
to be at home, at least not to a casual observer. But there was never anything casual about Mycroft’s observations. He looked keenly at his brother. "You are keeping your cases close to home these days."
Jackson smiled slightly. "This is more like what I expected. Very well, I shall prove it to you then. What piece of evidence would you find most convincing? The temperature and texture of my skin, perhaps?" He pulled off his gloves and held out a thin, white hand.
Unfortunately, his Will was Holmes’ now, and though he could not read Watson’s mind, he could sense his feelings through the blood that ran in his veins and he responded to it as any thrall might. It didn’t matter that Watson hadn’t said anything, had given no verbal command. Holmes could feel his desire and that was enough.
“Comfort?" Holmes mocked, his mouth warping around the word. "That I was hoodwinked and lied to by the two men I trusted above all others?”
“Can you usually tell what people are thinking?” he asked, but it was a foolish question and he knew it. Watson had been given to understand that for all his awkwardness at forming emotional connections, Holmes was a keen observer of human nature, and a shrewd judge of character.
"I will," he promised, "As long as I can." He pulled Holmes down to the settee again, his body cold against Holmes’ own. "You are the most wondrous man," he muttered into Holmes' hair.
Watson looked about himself with keen interest. Here was stored Holmes’ great wealth of knowledge, every piece of data he could grasp and retain cataloged, cross-referenced and stowed carefully away. He could feel Holmes urging him on, inviting him to explore, and so Watson thought ‘vampires’. It took but a moment and then the library shifted, the shelves folding inward and moving apart like a child’s kaleidoscope, until he was facing a new bookshelf that had not been there before. Watson had not moved at all, rather the library had rearranged itself around him, and now presented him with all the information Holmes had acquired on the subject of vampires, both fact and fiction, and each tome helpfully labelled as such.
"Because he is a murderer. There was a fire at Cavendish square tonight; I have just come from there." And if those two sentences were not technically related, they were still true.
Holmes didn’t need to see anything else, he knew how the scene would play out. His wife would be relieved to have him home, Montressor’s disorientation would soon turn to panic as she informed him that Holmes had been there looking for him and he would attempt to flee again, but this time Holmes would be ready for him.
“Give him time to reflect and repent,” he said, and Newman cast him a dark look, but dropped his arm.
He turned the body to its front, pulled the man’s collar aside. Just above the collarbone two ragged holes stood out against the bone white column of his neck, the shirt beneath dyed half red. Like Langley, the man had been drained, but the blood that might have been drunk instead painted the walls and ground.
The room was choked with memory, and until yesterday Holmes had not set foot within for many months. First because he could not bear to, and then because he saw no benefit in doing so. He was attempting to move on. Surrounding himself with the mementos of his dead lover seemed counterproductive, and in this room were all things that reminded him of Stamford, not least of all the man’s bed, which was now occupied by someone - something - else.
“Has he now,” Holmes replied in a slow drawl, the ice in his voice thick enough to chill a corpse of its own. The intervening days had done little to improve Holmes' opinion of the doctor. He still didn't trust the man - creature - whatever he was, didn’t like whatever game Watson was playing, and had no interest in becoming his latest pawn. Fascinating as the mysteries surrounding the doctor's existence were, the man himself got under Holmes skin in an acutely unpleasant way.
“Ah, but what a glorious death,” Holmes teased, but then sobered himself for Watson’s sake. “Do not fear; I will not let him harm you, nor give him more reason to wish it than he already has.”
"It is a form of mental domination," Watson warned, still trying to talk him out of it, "you may not like how it feels..."
That was doubtlessly true. It was a terrible scandal, and the inspector would have been harried ceaselessly by his superiors over the matter. “Then we must start with the man who was kept prisoner in the room upstairs.”
"No - she must rest, she must not be exposed to the night air! She will be drawn to him!" he said frantically, swaying towards madness once more.
“We have been aware of their increased activity around London for several weeks. A galère -- a large gathering of vampires -- is congregating outside the city; open war seems imminent.” He fixed his eyes firmly upon Watson, “It seems very convenient, then, that my own brother would happen to become entralled at such a time,” he glanced back at Holmes, “and to such an intense degree.”
"Ah, excellent," he sighed, letting his head fall and his eyes shut, and as if by some miracle of translocation the next time he became aware Lestrade was there.
"This will be... very similar to the other experience," he added. He stood and grabbed the armchair, moving it to the settee as though it weighed less than a pillow. He sat again and licked his lips nervously.
"The world is in motion,” Holmes answered, “I do not see how any man can be a part of it and not also move. How are you getting on?”
one of our parishioners was causing a bit of trouble among the congregation. There were, I believe, allegations made of adultery between this man and another's wife."
Watson did not let himself ruminate over those first words too deeply. "Have you been in the hospital before, for such severe injuries?" He doubted it; he would surely have heard of such a disaster from Stamford.
"You won't believe me," Jackson said with amused certainty, but continued anyway. "I am not technically alive."
Holmes approached the doorman – a dark-haired fellow by the name of Sturgerson – in a rented wheelchair pushed by one of his older boys, Georgie.
Holmes waved the comment aside. He was here for a reason. “I also assume his corpse was a message for your enemies. The clergy, perhaps? A man who wears worn out boots through the rain wears them because he has no alternative- he certainly couldn't afford such an expensive crucifix, nor a pouch full of silver bullets. Taken together with the contents of his pockets- wooden stake, bible, garlic - it is clear he was sponsored by someone of both faith and means. That’s why the church roof, isn’t it? And the cross between his teeth. You were sending them a message.”
The dead man’s name was Nelson Langley, a former sergeant in her majesty’s army. Whilst overseas he had suffered from a nervous breakdown that affected his mind and was summarily discharged, having been deemed unfit for service.
"The vicar, apparently. As for his reasons...to answer that, we must foray into the realm of speculation. But were we able to examine the boy I believe we would discover he suffered from some horrific mental or physical abnormality that necessitated he be kept apart from society...or perhaps he simply inherited his father’s madness. Either way, Deighton seemed to think his son could be cured through the power of faith and human sacrifice- he certainly went on a great deal about the purification of blood during my stay. I suspect his twisted mind sought to 'cure' the child’s ailment through the blood of others. How he planned to go about this, I do not know." It was a lengthy speech, and more than he had said in two days. It left him feeling tired and that annoyed him.
Father Deighton nodded. "If you are willing to work hard and put your faith in God, I believe I can help you." He then laid a plate of bread and a cup of tea in front of Holmes. "Eat, while I go attend to my duties. When I return, we shall speak some more."
"I believe he is lying," Mycroft answered, "but there is enough doubt that I am willing to proceed with a certain amount of caution.  I have sent out for information from other societies such as ours; they exist in one form or another in nearly every country in the world. I am taking no risk with regards to you. We will solve this mystery together and free you."
“No defensive wounds,” Holmes observed, bending down to peer at one long, white arm, “he was either caught by surprise, or - more likely - knew his attacker. What were the contents of his stomach?”
Behind him Newman stumbled in, still hunched over and hobbling. Dimly Holmes saw him raise the shillelagh but Deighton stopped him with a withered hand on his arm.
Watson considered his answer carefully, his fingers gentle on the side of Holmes face. “I cannot answer that now. Ask me again once the thrall fades.”
“Then you are in as much danger as ever. I think I am glad, now, that you are staying here.” Watson bit his lip as he spoke, an endearingly human trait. Holmes wondered if he would find it so endearing were he not so enthralled. Probably not.
The sun was a slow moving beast that crept it's way over the city and Holmes was on the verge of distraction by the time it set, his concentration in tatters, the doctor claiming dominion over his every thought. His attention pulled time and time again to the window and the darkness beyond it; the man who lay waiting there. Holmes could sense him in a distant way;
Holmes was in no mood for this at all, even less so than usual. "I am not a show pony,” he snipped crisply, “and I will not stand uselessly about for the sake of onlookers when a crime has been committed; that is what you have officers for." He turned on his heel and nodded to Lestrade. "Do feel free to contact me when you have something for me to
"Shh, it's alright now," Watson said soothingly, rushing back to Holmes' side. He got a careful grip on the man and lifted him into his arms.
"You have a habit of taking," Lestrade grumbled, accepting the receipt with grudging acknowledgement. "Did the hat maker tell you anything helpful?"
After they had been left alone again Watson sighed, ran a hand through his hair, and sat down. Then he took Holmes’ hand, and dared the world to say anything about it.
"It is now," Holmes replied, and it was part of the reason he did not want the thrall to fade. Because on the other side there was only pain, and memories to cripple a man.
"That is what I need a detective for," the man said, spreading his hands. "I am certain, but my instinct is not enough. I need proof, and so I have come to you."
Holmes sighed. "Mister Montressor, you are raving. Please calm yourself and then tell me your story, beginning to end; leave no detail out. And-" he looked around, "might I suggest I come inside, where there are fewer ears?"
“He was trying to keep his thoughts from me,” Watson said, feeling that an explanation was in order, “though I had warned him against doing anything like this.”
"Nothing is unimportant," Holmes told him, "and there is nothing I can do for any potential client who refuses to be honest with me." There were many things he could add to this. He could explain himself, lay out his reasoning like clothes on a washing line. He could tell the doctor why his secrecy was both detrimental and unwelcome, and reveal the myriad ways his brief story did not add up with Holmes' observations. But he did not. He had stated the crux of the matter; everything else was minutia. If Jackson wanted to value his secrets over his life, that was his own choice. Holmes did not like dealing with dishonest people anyway.
"I do," Holmes said, not bothering to address the second question. "I have been questioning the vagrants who live within sight of the church. The pattern is gruesome but predictable. With Blevins gone, Newman will be looking for new blood."
“It’s all right,” Watson said softly, sensing the direction of his thoughts. He pulled off his bracers and shoes and lay down beside him, mattress dipping under his weight.
“Kramer, eh?” the inspector asked, glancing at the haberdasher's receipt Holmes had produced from his pocket like a hat trick. He gave the detective an unfriendly look, “You might have waited for a proper warrant,” he scolded. “You can’t just take things, you know.”
"That is true," the vicar said thoughtfully. "Well, I suppose you had best have a look around." He turned to Newman. "Please show the detective to the shed. We must do all we can to help."
"No, they are not," Watson agreed. "Do you have anything you can take for your relief? I might have something in my bag-"
A brief inquiry of the marginally competent officers at Scotland Yard informed him that the dead man had yet to be identified and it was comforting to know the new world order had at least shown no effect on the acumen of London’s constabulary. Holmes found Lestrade in his cramped and paper strewn office, pouring over whatever mundane bureaucracy it was that kept the wheels of justice turning a snail’s pace.
At some point the pain returned, sharp and relentless and Holmes would not recall yelling for morphine but that is certainly what happened. He was tended to, another dose of quiet, mind-numbing euphoria unclenching his teeth and easing the grimace from his face, leaving him in a state of stupefied, almost infantile bliss. He slept straight through the morning, not rousing until sometime after noon.
"You've found her,” she replied, looking none too happy with the fact.  “What of it? He still owes rent; I don't care if he's dead.”
"I imply nothing; I say it plainly. You have them frightened, doctor, and they are being cautious. We can use that."
“You murdered him before he could confess to anything. Makes his damnation rather your fault doesn't it?”
Holmes hummed in not-quite agreement. “My present state, yes. As to that point, you must remove my bandages.”
Holmes made a sound something between a laugh and a groan. "Too many questions that account neither for my current state nor the pile of ash. I will...survive the night, I assume?"
And now finally, Holmes had all the information he required. “I will look into it, when I've the time,” Holmes promised. “Good day, gentlemen.” It was not lost on him that if Newman indeed knew Watson was a vampire, his intentions amounted to little more than sending Holmes straight to his death...and there would be one less detective in London sniffing around the church and asking questions about missing men.
"All right now," Watson instructed, "close your eyes and then feel for me. Think in the direction of my voice and focus your mind towards mine."
"I was concerned for your well being," he said defensively. "What have you discovered at the church?"
Watson blinked. Holmes certainly seemed to think he had explained himself, but Watson couldn't decipher the answer. "And that... means what?" he prompted.
But his best laid plans had not taken into account a body weakened for want of blood, and the morning passed with him slumped in his reading chair in a heavy doze. By the time he woke properly it was half ten, and he cursed aloud as he dove for his makeup kit in a mad scramble. To sleep half the morning away while on a case in which time was of the essence was insupportable, and he berated himself soundly as he made his way through the borough to Montressor’s shop on Dorsett street.
Holmes pursed his lips. Perhaps it happened with immortality that one became less concerned with living as the years stretched on. It certainly seemed true that one became less helpful. Why had he agreed to this case again? Ah yes, because Stamford would have asked it of him.
“Hmmm,” Holmes noted, mouth shriveled and pursed in thought. “What else do you know of vampiric society?”
"I'm sorry - I know I said I'd wait till dawn, but I couldn't, I was watching you, I needed..." he took a half-step into the room.
Watson looked disquieted, shifting about in his chair like a schoolboy. "To know anything more specific I would have to delve deeper into your mind - but it is very invasive."
“You should have told me,” he chastised, frowning slightly. They could have come together...Watson would have been more than a match for all three of them. It never would have come this, Holmes laying half dead on the floor, bleeding and broken.
But had taken him some time – and a brief detour through the city’s lesser areas – to find a suitably corrupt soul to provide him with sustenance. (He didn’t kill when he fed regardless, but without his practice he was relegated to surviving on the blood of the unwary, and it sat better with him that the donor be a person of dubious morality.)
“I like to think it was because I had asked him not to reveal my secret to anyone, and if the two of us had ever met, you certainly would have known something was amiss.  In all fairness, he never revealed the true nature of your relationship to me, either.”
"You should sit down," he said, his voice a low, purring growl, eyes burning into Holmes’ own, searing like fire. The words were more than a suggestion, they were an Order, impossible to resist.
"Of course," Holmes finally replied with flawless diplomacy, giving a slight bow of his own. "Until tomorrow night."
," he ground out, voice carrying the familiar, gravel-toned inflections of an Order. It was meant for Mycroft but Holmes responded to it anyway. Not the Order itself, not the base command but rather the emotion it was born from.
tfw you're doing editing and realize you forgot to mention Holmes nicking the pack of matches from Montressor's shop so you have to go back and add the line in because it's a small but important detail.
"You will be there to stop her, should your wife try to run away," Holmes reminded him. "As will I. I swear to you, no harm will befall her."
Watson considered. "The vicar’s sermons had been growing rather bizarre,” he admitted. “He had long been focused on proselytizing- but now I think of it, he preached a good deal about ‘purity of the blood’ towards the end there, before I left. Given Deighton’s sudden fixation on blood and purity, it seems reasonable that Newman is – or was – a member of some obscure sect of Christianity, one that took the idea of the blood of Christ a bit too literally perhaps. If he befriended Deighton and slowly converted the man to his way of thinking, he might be trying to save these men’s souls through some obscure ritual. It would explain why the unfortunate are being targeted, those with vices they perceive as wicked.”
It was a long hour before anything happened, minutes passing like single grains of sand through an hourglass as he lay on the floor in a pain-fogged haze. The room dipped and swooped around him, time fading in and out with his awareness and then dimly he heard a woman’s scream, and garbled voices echoing up from the floor below, distant and alarmed. Faraway footsteps thundered about the house, growing steadily nearer and finally a curate poked his head around the corner with a gasp.
“I have heard that thrall can affect men differently. Anything from slavish devotion to grudging obedience, though it often falls to the former. However, I have never heard of a vampire being similarly affected. Perhaps it is because I was drawn to you even before we shared blood.”
"It is the only one I know of," he replied cautiously, "but again, I know very little. As we age our blood becomes more potent and that is reflected in all things, including the fortitude of our thralls."
At this point Mycroft broke in, tone ponderous as ever but Holmes, who knew him as well as any man alive, could hear the subtle traces of agitation. His brother’s mind was fast at work, however untroubled his outward appearance. “The chief evidence is the crest itself; no one outside the Ó Muircheartaigh clan would have reason to use it, and James Moriarty was the last of his line.”
Holmes dismissed all that as beneath his notice. "Pah, you threatened me, is all. I have been threatened many times in my life, and by men with more intent behind their words than you. If it helps, you were not particularly convincing."
He eventually returned home because there was nowhere else to go. Mrs. Hudson was preparing an early supper when he came in, clothes damp from the drizzling rain. She poked her head out of the kitchen and yelled up the stairs at him as he passed by.
, and then Holmes would be obliged to hate his brother. He didn’t hate Mycroft and didn’t want to, but he couldn’t bear the thought of two weeks away from Watson either... "Let him visit me. Each night, here in the parlor. Let us see each other; under observation if need be. Grant me that, and I will stay."
Watson did, mastering himself enough to push Holmes gently away, hands lingering on his shoulders before letting them drop. “It’s all right,” Watson told him, then turned to Mycroft. “I have no desire to feed from him,” he said. “To share blood, yes. But he is not...he is not
It was very late; closer to dawn than sunset. The place Holmes next intended to visit would be closed for the night and thus it was back to Baker Street and those lonely rooms he perfunctorily referred to as 'home' but which had not felt as such for many months. Tomorrow he would pick up the threads of the investigation again.
“That is why he always knew so much,” he said simply, and Holmes gave a slow nod. He had fallen silent at the conclusion of the story and had yet to speak. But he didn’t need to speak to be understood. Watson’s hand on his shoulder was a conduit through which Holmes’ emotions flowed, and he wondered if Holmes would consider that a violation of his privacy and dropped his hand, feeling guilty. He wondered if it was one of those things he should have put on the list...
"Have you spoken to the diocesans? The bishop would know where the vicar was placed before coming to London. It will be somewhere to start."
The presence of Watson’s mind pressing against his became apparent at once, like a mental shadow, but one with mass and weight. He experienced a strange feeling of buzzing lightheadedness, a minor charge like static across his brain. Something dark and cold and not his own slithered around within his mental landscape and Holmes was reminded rather unpleasantly of tentacles.
Watson smiled sadly, and Holmes wanted to kiss away the crease of worry that formed between his brows. “Of course you do not, because
Mycroft was even more perceptive than himself, even better at putting pieces together and thus that short few sentences would tell him infinitely more than it would tell anyone else.
“I shall always fear for you, brother,” Mycroft said blandly in what was, for him, a display of high emotion. "You've a martyr's soul and a masochist's heart. Do not think it has gone unnoticed that your 'improvement' comes only after you've allowed yourself to be nearly beaten to death."
This was a trouble he was most keen they avoid. On that point he would happily avoid it himself, were not a man’s life hanging in the balance. But the fact that the unfortunate soul had been taken in so quickly could mean nothing good. Holmes would have to act with equal celerity.
Mycroft’s face never wavered as he replied, “The doctor could offer such assistance. The thrall may prevent you from opposing any direct order of his, but it will also aid in such training as this. It will be much easier on your psyche to have one you trust instruct you, even if the trust is of an illusory nature.”
Holmes squinted about at the other beggars, then gave a hunched-over shrug and struggled to his feet, dirty crutch shoved tight under one arm. He started to hobble forward, following the reverend but was stopped by a stoop-shouldered mendicant in ratted clothes, wisps of soft white hair floating about his face like feather down.
A secret smile of indeterminable origin played around the edge of Holmes mouth. "Refuse to help? No, but he might not choose to help in the way I wish."
"Father!" it screamed, the voice a deep, rasping snarl. It's eyes burned like hell fire, tormented and desperate.
Holmes inhaled, eyes narrowing slightly. "You have cost me a day's worth of investigation. I had told you I would keep in contact."
If Holmes noticed the impassioned tone he did not comment on it. "My nights and days were dangerous enough before we met. I do not think he will look on my present circumstance as having been improved by our acquaintance."
thing to say that Watson couldn’t help laughing, but then Holmes looked up at him and added with childlike sincerity, “I am yours.”
Thus he was caught completely off guard when the toff turned and smiled at him very wide. "Ah, my dear fellow," he said in pleasant tone that sent ice down the back of Nock’s spine, "I wouldn't do that if I were you."
A triumphant gleam lit up the detective's eyes, and Watson recognized it as a predator closing in for the kill. "And what is the greater danger; being at your mercy, or at theirs?"
Sometime later Lestrade walked in, looking unusually pensive. "I'm glad you're awake," he said, and did indeed sound relieved.
“No,” he replied, voice brooking no argument. “If you can master yourself enough to feed without killing, then do so. Drink until you are at least sensible enough to follow basic instructions. There is work to be done tonight and you will be of no use if the only thing you can focus upon is blood.”
Mycroft knew of the existence of thralls. Knew of them so intimately that he had this room - the only place in the whole of the Diogenes that non-members were allowed - warded against them, for that is unquestionably what had happened. If he knew of thralls, then he also knew of vampires, and his knowledge likely far surpassed Holmes’ own; a fact which would make his task both easier and harder.
He held Watson's eyes with a gaze sharp as carpet tack. "And I ask again: what would you have me do? You already know who is after you; how am I to act upon that information?"
from Holmes. If he drank any of that precious blood it would only be to strengthen their connection, to join them together more completely.
, they will come for you. And if they cannot find you, then they will come for me. Me and whatever information about you I have."
But then again, what was Holmes if not passionate? So far as Watson had observed, he did nothing by halves. Whatever held his attention held it completely, whether it was crime or science or the violin, and he pursued each interest with a single-minded obsessiveness that bordered on zealotry.
Seeing Mycroft's thoughts bent in another direction, Holmes relaxed slightly. But only slightly. “It was not consciously done,” he said, and Mycroft rumbled at him.
Watson started slightly at the knowledge that Holmes had at least guessed he’d spent the night beneath the earth. But why should he be surprised, knowing what he did of the man’s abilities? "I thought you'd insisted I stay here.”
"One of the services I offer as a doctor is bloodletting," Watson said in way of an explanation. "I don't need to pick out a random human from the crowd; they come to me."
Watson blinked, taking a moment to work his way around Holmes' logic. "I- I don't know. But not if the thrall is a reflection of my feelings towards
Finally, a callow-faced youth barely out of childhood stepped gingerly into the gaping maw of the alley, lamp held before him like a paltry shield.
"Do not be tiresome. We have been over this, you know there is not. That is why - much as I would rather not - I must wait for him to strike again. The proof must be absolute, and going to Lestrade ahead of time will do nothing save tip him off."
"You had already been identified," Holmes reminded him. "Newman would have sent word of you as soon as Montressor's suspicions came to light. Who knows how many agents have been prowling the city in search of you? Things were going to come to a head whether you'd killed Langley or not, regardless of where you deposited his corpse."
"If he is a monster, he is a human one. It has been a month; has your wife expressed any interest in returning, or tried to sneak away?"
Montressor hung his head, face flushing with shame. "No I - I ran. I hid...but I went back for her! God as my witness, Mister Holmes, I went back for her!"
“Of course, sir. Thank you, sir,” the officer said distractedly, setting off down the hall in a daze. Watson smirked quietly to himself as the constable disappeared around the corner, then slipped into the room.
“Newman frequently headed north on the pretense of missionary work. The last time was just before I left the church’s employ. He was gone three days, and when he returned he was a changed man. More focused, more zealous in his crusade for blood. It was in fact his interest in Blevins that caused me to put an end to that particular charade. He was absent on similar work the night Langley died.”
Holmes had encountered many bodies in his line of work. After the first time seeing a man with his limbs stiffened in rigor mortis, the light utterly extinguished from his eyes, one never again made the mistake of confusing a living body for a dead one. The most lauded actor in England could not replicate the vacant, glass-eyed stare of a body severed from its soul.
"I know," he said, voice heavy with regret. "until tonight? You will come again." Plan or no plan, Holmes could not bear to have Watson away so long.
At the heart of it, of course, was the doctor himself. John Watson, an impossible thing. A creature that science and reason told him
Holmes allowed himself a moment of anger. Damn it...damn Montressor and damn Watson too. How many laws was he compelled to break in order to keep Watson's secret? If the police found Montressor
Watson watched him go, and then, overcome with exhaustion from the rising sun, swiftly made his way to his sleeping place, secured the door from the inside, and went to bed.
He pondered for a moment the wisdom of their having joined forces: Holmes was a man who could, with very little effort, make life extremely difficult for Watson if he so chose. He could discover his lair, reveal him to the Yard, set dozens of hunters against him...or pierce him through the heart with the business end of a well-sharpened stake.
“How could I not know?” he whispered. He, who knew so much, who could read a man’s history from the callouses on his hands, the mud on his shoes. How could he not know something so profound about his closest of companions? About his very lover? It made no sense, and yet Mycroft told the truth, that was evident enough.
"You are lucky Lestrade's men are on watch,” Holmes slurred at him, coming awake, “they would miss an elephant if it passed them in the street."
“What else could I do?” Watson asked  helplessly, still trying not to look at him and Holmes was reminded of a drowning man struggling for air. “I have sins enough; I did not want more innocent blood on my hands.”
“However,” he continued, “I am not currently without a case, am I? I am in fact in the middle of what I may safely say is the most fascinating, important and dangerous case of my career, and perhaps in the history of modern London. And yet, I can
Holmes did not have long to wait. Three and a half minutes later the cabbie returned, and a constable leapt down from the cab even before it rattled to a full stop, running to Holmes's side.
The first thing of course was to stanch the bleeding. The bullet hit far enough to the side it had not struck any arteries, and was doing a tolerable job of helping to slow the flow of blood itself but there was enough of him on the floor already. He would need every drop, if he was going to survive this.
Conclusion: It was Watson, or it was a creature of similar strength and wall scaling ability, which left no prints and no scent, and who took a keen interest in his affairs.
"And is this any better a drug than cocaine or opium? All control a man's will and drive him to eventual madness."
"Quite," he bit out, word sharp and broken off at the end, and Watson didn't need mental powers to catch the bitterness that infused it.
"New blood," Watson muttered to himself, scoffing. "But what is he killing them for? What is he getting out of it save a- a demented thrill?" He glanced at Holmes from the corner of his eye. "You should sit down."
Holmes got to work. The doves were a simple affair, requiring little more than transferring them to a crate and covering it with sackcloth to simulate darkness. After that he cleaned the coop and put down a layer of sawdust and fresh grass and soon the birds were back inside, cooing contentedly and pecking about. The parrot however was another matter, and Holmes came away from the ordeal with several scratches and a new adversary.
"Just at dawn," Lestrade called back. He pulled out a battered notebook, flipping through the pages with one thick finger. "By one of the curates. They noticed something dark on the roof in the wee hours of the morning. Couldn't make it out in the fog, and by the time it’d burned off enough to tell what she was lookin’ at half the street had noticed too. Been quite a spectacle; we're having a damn hard time keeping people away."
"Thank you for doing this," she said to him quietly as they walked. "But surely easing my husband's fear is not part of being a detective?"
"Of course," Mycroft answered, and for a moment sounded nearly genuine. It was a moment that passed between them unremarked upon, like so many others.  "Now, onto the business of your recent streak of carelessness... I once again request that you take more care with yourself, brother."
His concentration was in tatters, thoughts scattered like seed and more than once he caught himself on the verge of dozing off. Ridiculous, dangerous and lazy. What the hell was wrong with him? He had a case that was swiftly moving to a pivotal point. He had slept for hours the night before, and again that morning. He had no excuse to be drifting off while at watch. Lives were at stake.
Holmes screamed too, a painful, rasping wail that made Watson wince in sympathy and then he was gone, head slumping forward as consciousness fled.
"Good Lord..."  The inspector muttered as he glanced around at the carnage, looking faintly ill. "What happened here!?"
Watson looked away at that, stared into the fire, popping embers reflecting in his eyes like starlight on a river. "There are things that one does, especially soon after the change, that are often regrettable," he said softly. "Unless proper guidance is given, it can be quite...destructive."
Ah. “I-” he searched, and found he had no good answer. What could he say in his defense? That he had forgotten? That he hadn’t thought it a necessary detail? That Holmes was too- too
"I don't quite understand," Watson said. "I believe vampires properly tutored by their sires have a great wealth of knowledge I lack, and access to resources I have not."
Holmes peered at him with a dissecting gaze. “What are you up to, brother? It is quite unlike you to facilitate any cooperation between Watson and myself.”
She took a shaky step towards him, shaking her head in disbelief with her hands clenched into fists at her sides.
. He had never had a thrall before, and the few vampires he'd conversed with on the subject had led him to understand it was not a particularly momentous act on his end; it was the human’s mind which was influenced, not the Master’s. As such, he had not expected to feel any different in his regard for the mad detective.
It was Holmes' turn to smile, though it was an empty thing, devoid of mirth. "Not so much as you might think. If you knew our friend so well as you claim then you know how well he could keep a secret. I know it too; he kept many of mine. You speak as though he and I were nothing more than colleagues." Holmes stepped up to Jackson again and pulled a chain from around his neck; at the end was a simple silver band, engraved with ivy leaves.
"Not anymore," he replied shortly, and the silence that followed weighted on them both. "Perhaps someone on your end, or are you also out of trusted associates?"
Holmes' face tightened, and Watson felt uncommonly like a school boy who had disappointed a favored teacher. "A good many things.
And none of that filled Watson with either confidence or reassurance. “Once the sire reads your thoughts he will know better,” Watson countered. “Your life might not mean as much as you believe; it would be the work of minutes to rip the truth from your mind. Possibly less.”
“Why? What do they care for human society?” he pressed, urgent undertone in the words, dissecting gaze resting full upon Watson and he tensed under the scrutiny.
"I was reflecting on how much consternation you must be causing other vampires by your mere existence."
"You must eat, or your blood will not return," Watson chastised. "I'll make you something - where do you keep your food?"
But it was done now and he emerged from the underbelly of the city like Orpheus ascending the stair, letting himself be pulled along by the distant thrum in the back of his mind; a steady rhythm that guided him through the restless city, pulsing in time to the beating of a heart that was now far dearer to him than his own.
"I've no intention of it, old boy," Holmes replied with a shadow of his usual imperious smile, and Watson thought with a sudden pang,
“Only if you kill them. A man under the command of a thrall will not stop. Not until he accomplishes his goal, or the thrall fades.”
“No,” Watson admitted, “but I feel as though I bear a certain amount of responsibility for all that has happened since. Though at least in this particular instance, I was not the source of your danger.”
Just before sundown he disappeared into one of his boltholes - a rented room on the top floor of a weather beaten pub - and emerged a changed man; no longer a limping beggar but a salt-and-peppered haired sailor with a scar over one cheek. He sent word via his Irregulars to Watson, requesting the doctor meet him there.
"A doctor, Doctor Jackson. I believe he runs an evening clinic somewhere near Cavendish. In any case, I confronted him about the rumors, and soon after he left of his own accord - that was some few weeks before Langley died. He made no confession before he went, nor farewells, and that might - to some - be taken as evidence of his guilt. It is
It was a rather ordinary sort of gentleman’s club. Not the highest class and certainly not the lowest. A solid, respectable sort of place filled with solid, respectable men of the working class who lost their money to one another at well-used snooker tables amid the familiar scents of cigar smoke and brandy.
Father Newman leaned his head back slightly, appearing deep in thought. "Sherlock Holmes...I remember now, I've seen your name in the paper."
A long while later he woke in a hospital bed, strong medicinal scent sharp in his nose. The pain was dulled to a distant, discordant echo and the world held a crystalline, dreamlike quality that bespoke of heavy morphine. His wounds had been treated and wrapped, broken bones splinted and hidden beneath strips of white plaster. His leg was elevated against several pillows, and his arm lay nestled in a sling across his chest.
“Consider it at any rate,” Mycroft said. “As the doctor is here, we might as well make use of him. Such an experiment might yield valuable information as to the mental capabilities of vampires and their thralls which can be used to further our cause, and I know of no-one reckless and foolhardy enough to willingly replicate your circumstances, brother mine.”
"Were you the only one she gave immortal death to on the battlefield?" Holmes was invested now; avid, calculating, examining everything Watson gave him with keen focus.
Holmes stiffened, feeling like a steel glove wrapping around his heart and he thought he would very much like to hit the man. "I do not believe there is much left for us to discuss." He turned purposefully away, and his hands did not clench at his sides because he was a remarkably gifted actor.
was supposed to have been the mad one. "If the doctor is as dangerous as you believe, then surely bringing him to justice would be the logical route." Holmes said reasonably.
“You think I am unaware? Depend upon it, Doctor, no one knows my brother’s mind better than myself, nor the difficulties it causes him.”
The problem was, this thing was bigger than either himself or Watson. Or Mycroft, for that matter. They needed an alliance, and in order for that to happen
Watson sagged into him, weak-boned and heavy. He lifted his arm and licked the wound closed on his wrist, his other hand finding its way to Holmes’ head, fingers curling into his thick hair and Holmes made no move to prevent Watson touching him at all.
“And what does that tell you?" he asked impatiently, "I need answers, Holmes. My constables are acting like a barn full of horses when there's smoke."
It was gone the next instant, Watson’s hand snatched away as though Holmes' skin were made of pure silver. The doctor inhaled sharply, looking down at him in something like awe.
"He had to be somewhere I could keep a close eye on him, and the arrangement is a temporary one." He winced as Carruthers deposited him a chair and set a footstool beneath his injured leg.
They pulled the body down as carefully as could be managed and laid it on a stretcher. Lestrade ordered everyone away then, giving Holmes a chance to conclude his examination without having to cling perilously to a rooftop.
"You're up early," Mrs. Hudson said, looking him over with a critical eye, thin face pinched into a frown. "Or did you not sleep at all?"
Watson left Holmes to his odd experiments and morose thoughts, shutting the door quietly behind him as he slipped out into the cold dark of pre-dawn.
An explosion of pain, dazzling and white, hot as starbursts. Then darkness swirled around his mind, creeping in at the edge of his vision as the seconds ticked by, his body thrumming in agony. Everything went dim, distorted and there was the coppery taste of blood in his mouth. By the time he regained his senses the dead man had been removed, and Holmes chained to the wall in his place.
Holmes was having an infuriatingly hard time keeping the man on point. "What did you do then? Did you confront the doctor?"
"You will join me in the library after breakfast,” he said shortly, not bothering to offer any of the usual such pleasantries of “How are you feeling” or “I hope you slept well” etc., etc., all quite tedious. Mycroft had answered all those questions for himself with that brief look.
They backed out of the chamber. "We will talk in a while," the vicar told him, and then the heavy stone door was pushed into place with a hollow, scraping sound that stole the light from the room until he was left in utter darkness. The man chained to the wall wheezed, a tale-tell rattle in his lungs.
, no one else...and with those thoughts came others, chief among them the understanding that he belonged to Holmes as well.
The cellar appeared in all respects an ordinary space, filled with the customary items such as coal, firewood and extra provisions. Holmes grabbed up a convenient candle from the stack at the bottom of the stair and set it alight, sending thick shadows shifting over the cold stone walls.
"You are as observant as he said you were," he said thoughtfully, as though speaking to himself. He blinked and addressed Holmes properly. "Yes, there is a specific reason this man was hired. I do not think revealing that reason is particularly relevant to your mission."
His eyes wandered to an oft-handled tome with the title written in Latin. He took it down and it separated in his hands, age and wear having rendered the spine soft and useless. Within were a number of cramped notations, bits of paper covered all over in Kramer’s spidering handwriting and a calling card printed on starch white paper, newer than the others.
"I was ill," she answered simply. "I fell last summer and the sickness would not leave me, so James decided the best course would be to get it out of my blood. It does seem to have worked, I feel much recovered these days."
“We will do what we have always done,” Mycroft intoned, “what our coven has done for ages past. Do not think, Doctor, that London’s safety is reliant upon you.”
“I do not think I could even hope to fight a vampire so old,” Watson said, listening with widened eyes as Holmes told him all he had learned about “James Moriarty”.
Mycroft’s eyes widened in alarm and his hand slammed hard against the foyer desk, upsetting the ink well and covering the desk top in a wash of black.
"Torture is a heavy word. They are lead through the valley of pain to confession; what they choose after is their own will.”
“Well, their rector was insane, and like attracts like after all. As to that point, he may have had something to do with Jackson’s death as well.”
"Any human loses patience when hungry or tired," he replied, hands curled into a fist at his sides. Holmes was sporting with him, he had to be. Watson was not some- some
Holmes managed a pained chuckle. "If you can find your answers in my silence, there's no need to ask the questions. Might as well kill me now, save us both some trouble."
Holmes harrumphed at him as he left and didn’t sleep that night, which was unfortunate. Instead he spent a good deal of time thinking about the past, which was also unfortunate. Such morose thoughts tended to have a damaging effect on his psyche.
"He was protecting me from that fiend!" she hissed. "I'm glad he's dead, it's the only good thing to come from all of this!"
He nodded. “That’s it exactly, judging by the clothes. There- wasn't much else left. They’d been buried unwrapped; worms had got at ‘em.” He swallowed, took off his hat and threaded the brim through his fingers. “Anyway, made a thorough search of the house and found that room down in the cellar, blood still on the floor...” he looked up at Holmes as his voice trailed off. “Seems the vicar and his friend were engaged in some very unchristian-like behavior.” The staid understatement made Holmes snort in soft laughter as Lestrade continued.  “Obvious enough what he was doin’. What’s not understood is
"I will," Watson promised, his heart swearing the oath as fervently as a knight on bended knee. "I won't let harm befall you."
“Nothing conclusive,” he replied, and knew now where the conversation was headed, the point Mycroft was driving at, and the disbelief began slowly to turn to something like anger. Like hurt. “But the doctor certainly possesses such abilities, thus their reality is beyond question.”
"Why else would the sire have stooped to espionage? You said yourself your kind prefers outright warfare when settling disputes among themselves, and you are the Prince of London, Watson, whether you intended it or not. You have held the city for fifty years by right of blood and conquest and your claim stands. But rather than issue a formal challenge, or attack the city directly this one lurks in the shadows, blackmailing priests to join his network of spies and sending out thralls to scour the streets in search of you."
“Did you find anything of interest among the vicar's things?" Holmes asked, and Watson blinked at the sudden change of topic.
As with many of the old Irish families, the end of the Ó Muircheartaigh line was a tragic one. Though their clan had thrived for many generations there by the river, the English and Norman invasions and the subsequent centuries of British rule had seen the once mighty family dwindle in both number and influence, until only a handful remained. The surname itself was not uncommon in Ireland – having derived from several similar names of various spellings over the long years – but the last direct descendant of the Ó Muircheartaigh’s whose crest bore the castle and serpent had been Séamus Moriarty (anglicized, James) a man who had lived more than 300 years previous. He disappeared one night on a hunting trip and the body never recovered. A few days later the rest of his party went home in boxes, their own bodies mutilated and drained of blood.
"I don't know," Watson admitted with a helpless shrug, "It does not seem to be anything like what I have heard, I can say that much."
"Likely by finding my resting place and stabbing me.” He cocked his head, regarding Holmes at an angle. “You don't believe I am what I say I am," he said. "I could prove it all to you, quite easily too."
The doctor's mouth curved into a smile, and Holmes found himself studying the strange lack of creases on the vampire's face, the way his skin lay perfectly smooth, no laugh lines or wrinkles, no gravity pulling the skin inevitably downward. It was as though he'd been carved from marble, hard and pale and pure.
"Easy, Brother." Newman steadied the old priest, then turned towards Holmes. "I must ask that you refrain from upsetting Father Deighton. Mister Langley's death was terrible enough, and he has already been questioned extensively-"
Mycroft snorted and glowered, shifting about in his chair. "If the human is lucky. More often than not, it is expected that they will eventually consent to become a vampire, rather than be claimed by mortal death. For the death of one bond by necessity means the death of the other."
Apologies for the delay. New job has borked the writing schedule for one half of the editing team and the other is busy moving to a new place solo.
Holmes could do little but glare up at the man and clutch at his now useless leg. Impressive as his self-control was, no one shrugged off a bullet wound.
"I am certain you will manage," he replied as carelessly as if Watson had been commenting on the weather.
Watson was late. Not that there had been any specified time for his arrival at the Diogenes, but he didn’t like being away from Holmes longer than necessary. Consequently, that meant he’d been obliged to feed, because within the walls of the Diogenes blood sharing was forbidden and Watson found it difficult enough to abstain without also being hungry.
Watson did not technically require air but he huffed anyway; it made him feel better. He was beginning to see how easily Holmes could talk him round in circles. He decided to change the subject. "Is this what you do most evenings? Experiment?"
But after all Holmes was a man of reason down to his core and he did not allow opinion to cloud his judgement. Thus whatever his personal feelings toward Watson, he did believe Langley had been killed in self defense, and he believed too Watson was being framed for murder. It did not take a great deal of acumen to understand that his energies were best spent pursuing the killers, rather than squabbling with a vampire. That the pursuit would doubtlessly bring him into contact with the doctor at regular intervals was not a thing that could be helped; he was going to need Watson, whether he liked it or not.
Well, that was somewhat disturbing but nothing Holmes did not expect from these creatures. He read for most of the day, about thrall, and then vampires in general, while Carruthers furnished him with food and drink, most of which went untouched. It was around supper time when Mycroft returned.
He looked up with heavy-lidded eyes and found the doctor staring down at him with open affection. Watson reached down to stroke his face and Holmes leaned into the touch, feelings of warmth, comfort and possession flowing between them. He could not remember ever being so in love...
“Did you fear it?" Holmes asked, sounding only distantly interested. Then, "I might ask what you are doing masquerading as a coroner for the Yard.”
Lestrade shook his head, hands locking behind his back. “It’s a dark business. Your request and the scene itself were enough to secure a warrant to dig up the graves around the church, though we didn’t know what we were lookin’ for.”
“You must bring it out in me,” Holmes replied glibly, undeterred as clever fingers snaked their way around his back for a surprise attack. Watson parried, grabbing ahold of his wrists.
"Will they now." Another small, odd smile crossed Watson's face. He examined the items carefully. “Occult, from the look of them.”
"Yes," he breathed, sinking against Watson, his body cold and hard and startlingly real. "I loved Stamford; I do still. But I did not feel for him what I feel for you."
Holmes had him stripped of both jacket and waistcoat in moments. "You give yourself too much credit. If all the thrall did was reflect your emotions onto me, should I
Well, that put things into a certain perspective. "Ne'er met a man who wasn't afeared 'o somethin’."
“Possibly, though I fear such a maneuver risks fugue; a condition that may be the very opposite of helpful.”
Watson tried again. “Do you prefer to be distracted at times like these, or does staring at the fire better suit your mood?"
There was a long silence, then the door opened once more, a single, wide eye glaring out at him. "That man,” Montressor began, voice skating on the edge of low hysteria, “claims to be a doctor only to work his evil on innocent women! My wife! Poisoned by him! Enthralled, hypnotized!"
Newman glided up beside them smooth as a serpent in the Garden. "I will say the man had a problem with drinking," he reported in a low voice. "It was an old vice, and the cause of his banishment from the clergy house. Perhaps he simply succumbed to the devils drink once more."
"I have already told you the truth!" Montressor shouted, ready to work himself into another fit of anger.
That made Watson laugh all the more, and it felt good. "You're alive, and you will recover. But I should like to examine your wounds; hopefully the doctors here haven’t butchered you too badly."
Holmes nodded absently, his eyes still on the wall. He wondered if there had been a better way, something he should have done differently...the pain on Mrs. Montressor's face gnawed at him, even though her husband
"I suppose not. Do you really think he can help?" He tried to imagine how Mycroft - another mortal, with all the same weaknesses - might offer true assistance.
Chapter 25 is the official end of book one, and the first chapter of book two has been posted. This small addendum will hopefully clear up any confusion anyone has. If not, go ahead and shoot us an ask.
“The only danger to me at present is one of boredom,” Holmes replied, sardonic curl to his voice. “I cannot investigate from an arm chair.”
"Indeed," Lestrade agreed. "I'll send a constable 'round to the address once we identify the relatives." He stared at Holmes for a long moment, face pulled into a faint scowl. "Anything else?"
"But you have not been entirely forthcoming either," Holmes countered, and if he noticed the change in the atmosphere he did not comment on it. "A man who is distraught enough to seek out a detective in the middle of the night because he fears for his life is not simply following instinct. You are a man with a few enemies at least, you have admitted to that plainly enough and there may be many reasons one of them would have you followed; to presume murder you draw either on past experience or paranoia-" his eyes glanced over the stranger, head to toe "-and you are not a paranoid man," he finished definitely. "You have a reason to believe this man wants you dead, and it is that reason you are withholding from me.”
"I will not be ordered about," he replied archly, even though he had intended to bathe anyway. The last week or so had left him smelling a bit ripe even by his somewhat lax standards.
For various reasons, Watson attempted to steer the conversation elsewhere. "Will you stay till dawn?" he asked again, sitting down in the opposite chair. "You have done much for me, let me watch over you this once."
“Indeed, despite the fact I was at their mercy and had no knowledge of the letters at all, Newman tried to burn them anyway. If there were information within them that could be used to discover both Moriarty’s identity and whereabouts – such as the crest – Newman would certainly have been under orders to destroy them. My coming even as close as I did to their discovery likely triggered whatever command he had been given in regards to their disposal, and he acted upon it. If we were meant to find them, they would not have been in the fireplace.”
"Of course!" Holmes emerged from the bedroom in his usual fashion of haphazard dress, waistcoat askew and cuffs undone. Lestrade looked him over once more and seemed about to speak but Holmes gave him no chance, sweeping out of the room with far more vigor than he felt.
, Watson. Technology, innovation and automation. We stand on the brink of a new age; civilization is in the midst of an industrial revolution with England at its core...and at the core of England is London. What vampire playing this great game of civilization would forgo the opportunity to capture this city for themselves? What city in all of Europe poses such strategic value? There is Paris, but it is known for its artists and lovers more than its industry, and I do not think I would be wrong in assuming it's claim is already well laid by some clan or another. But here? There is no claim, and no clan. There is only
But Holmes didn't trust his brother an inch. Not with this. "Not here. I know you have what you believe to be my best interests at heart, and I know how you feel about him. Bear me no ill will when I tell you I do not trust you in this. A vampire in the foyer of the Diogenes is a heart waiting for a silver bullet."
It was the wrong thing to say. Watson was out of the chair in an instant, a snarl on his lips and already halfway across the room before Holmes' eyes could perceive it. He stopped himself with obvious difficulty, turning from Holmes to face the wall with his hands pressed to his head in distress. Whatever warmth had been in the room seeped away, leaving in it's wake that same deathless chill Holmes remembered from their first meeting...when his life had hung in the balance of Watson's uncertain temper. He took a step back, his muscles tensed in preparation to either fight or flee. He was not the sort of man to retreat but neither was he a fool; he had seen the murder lust of a ravenous vampire in the doctor's eyes before the man managed to wrangle his darker half under control.
Watson seemed to think about this, and after a moment's contemplation his face cleared in understanding. "I did, now you mention it. A young lady- Mrs. Lucy Montressor. She stopped coming one day quite suddenly, no notice. Of course, these things happen and I have plenty of clients, so I didn't think much of it at the time. But she wasn't at Mass that week, either. Before I had a chance to hear any news of her Newman accosted me, and then I had bigger problems to concern myself with."
“Vampires are the purview of the Prince,” Holmes corrected, lighting his pipe with a long inhale and shaking out the match. “Particularly those who hunt within his territory without leave. They must be feeling emboldened. This is likely a trap to draw him out.”
Holmes gave a long suffering sigh. "I will stay an hour if you will stop badgering me," he grumped in reply.
It was as though someone had set off fireworks inside his brain, a brilliant display of dizzying color and he was pushed out of the quiet space of the library, swept away as Holmes opened the floodgates and both their minds became awash in sensory data, sight and smell and sound all blending together in a cacophonic roar.  As the tidal wave rolled over him, Watson broke and retreated from Holmes’ mind, back into his own.
"A mother rabbit after giving birth immediately leaves the nest, visiting for only a few minutes a day thereafter to feed her young. This is to minimize the chance of the burrow being found by any predator who may be tracking her. It would seem cruel by human standards, but rabbits are not humans. Neither are vampires."
“Ah, Sherlock,” he said heavily, draining the glass, “foolish boy, God save you. You may have truly outdone yourself this time.”
From somewhere above he heard the door to the garret room open, and then Watson materialized at his side like an apparition, feet so swift and silent on the stairs Holmes hadn't heard him descend.
The vicar gave him another sad smile. "My history is not your concern. You will understand both my sin and my repentance soon enough." He stepped aside for Newman, who came forward with a rough cudgel, shorter and thicker than his shillelagh. When Deighton looked at him again his face was filled with madness and sorrow. “My judgement shall come someday, and He will not be merciful. But first, there is someone I must save." Then Newman hit Holmes in the head with the club and everything went dark.
"Holmes," the inspector said, stepping carefully into the room, a white handkerchief pressed against his face to ward off the smell of blood and death.
to follow me inside. If I have not returned before nightfall, hurry to Baker Street and find Doctor Watson. Tell him where I have gone, and that I require his immediate assistance.”
Holmes had to cover a snort. Far from being offended on Watson’s behalf, Holmes felt a slight flair of triumph. For derogatory as his brother’s remarks might be, the larger point remained; Mycroft was beginning to come around.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” he demanded, a thin layer of hoarfrost coating the words. Stamford was not there, and so Mycroft bore the brunt of Holmes' turmoil. Perhaps that was unfair, but things were as they were.
Watson smiled, unsurprised. "Technically you haven’t got a physician, I'm not sure they'll like that."
Eventually there was another carriage outside, and Holmes recognized Lestrade’s footsteps coming up.
“Ask him about Kramer,” one of the other men interrupted, and a dark murmur of agreement wound its way around the room.
Watson slipped off the chair and onto the settee, wanting to get as close to Holmes as possible. He stroked his hair, possessive thoughts filling his mind, sharper and more insistent than they had been before... Holmes was
Saint Cyprian was small parish church of red brick with a deeply sloping roof set high above the street. Despite the hour a crowd had already gathered, necks craned to catch a glimpse of the body that could be seen crumpled against the grey slabbed roofing tiles. Out in the street harried looking officers bustled to and fro, futilely trying to disperse the curious onlookers.
Holmes had been expecting a question of this nature, and gave an indolent shrug. "Most me life, I s'pose," he began, scratching at his nose. " ‘Twas a family sin, if ye follow. Didn’t get bad till I crushed me leg, an then drink was all as helped the pain. Didn’t help nothin' else though. After I lost me Annie, I swore I'd ne'er touch another drop. Got meself proper work; I done her proud. But then masser went off ta Normandy, and I didn’t have work no more. Not till the vicar took me in."
Watson chuckled, noting the skepticism. "I will say scaling walls feels easier than it should be, even accounting for my increased strength."
"A moment, brother," Holmes answered, and tipped his head to Watson's shoulder. "I am going to miss you terribly," he mumbled.
“I know him better than anyone else. Even so, there are times when the inner workings of his mind remain a mystery. But he has certainly seen something useful in you, and for that we should be thankful. It will go a long way towards preserving your life.”
Holmes watched the inspector as he went back to his examination of the room, the twisted metal bed frame with its leather straps and silver cuffs, the trail of crimson footsteps Watson had left in a careful path to the door.  He remained silent, letting the inspector draw his own, almost certainly erroneous conclusions.
Newman was silent for a long while, seeming to consider the avenues before him. Finally he spoke, voice low. “I needn’t tell you how very serious this is. Were it up to me, I would have you dismissed from the clergy house in disgrace.”
"Well then," he said, still struggling to define the feeling that had taken root inside him, "I suppose we should look to the city's defenses. You're the strategist, what do you propose?"
He shrugged. "That depends on how much blood is taken. Usually I take only a few mouthfuls at a time, and thus must feed every few days. In Langley's case, I drank quite a bit more; his blood sustained me for several weeks."
"No! Of course not-" Watson fumbled; nothing about this meeting was going as expected. He had thought Holmes - if not exactly happy to see him - might at least be
Holmes harrumphed at him, quarrelsome twist to his mouth. "Hardly. Otherwise you would not have been chosen. I wager there were a few older than yourself that you handily dispatched; you would not have gotten such a formidable reputation otherwise." Holmes' pinned him down with a glance, "And it is obvious you have one."
Holmes interrupted them both. "Whether it is my will or not, I will allow no harm to come to him. You will have to either kill me or incapacitate me first."
Lestrade rolled his hat about on his head, clearly debating the pros and cons of letting England’s foremost detective smash his head open on the cobblestones. Finally he acquiesced with a shrug of his burly shoulders. “Well, it’s your own neck after all.”
“You are alone, excellent. We must talk.” He did not wait for an answer. "We were right in that the person who sent Langley after you and the person who killed Kramer were one in the same. However, it was not the church, not directly. I believe with near certainty that it was Mister Montressor, the husband of your former patient.”
He had left Watson’s practice in the quiet hour before sunrise, arriving at Saint Cyperian’s in the steel grey light of pre-dawn. His Irregulars, that rag-tag group of street urchins he employed time to time as errand runners had been keeping watch on the church day and night, but they had nothing noteworthy to report. No beggard had yet replaced Mister Blevins as the intended target and so Holmes was obliged to wait; he could not go to the Yard with nothing more than his word that something nefarious was happening. Even if he were believed, it would take more than a sick parrot and a room scrubbed clean of blood to secure a warrant. The church wielded too much power and influence and the homeless, not nearly enough. Thus if he was to catch Newman it must be (quite literally) red-handed.
to say I was unsurprised to receive a telegram from the Yard telling me of your injury. I was only surprised that it had taken so long to occur.”
Mycroft’s eyes narrowed sharply. “I have never lied to you, brother. There are many things we do not discuss between ourselves. You do not ask me about my work, and I do not ask after your personal affairs. I never requested information about Stamford and you never divulged it. Furthermore, it was his expressed wish that he have no further contact with the Diogenes after he left, and I honored it. Thus, what he did and how much he told you of himself was his decision alone. It was not my place to share his secrets any more than it was his place to share mine...or yours.”
"I have taken great care to ensure that we have not been seen together so far, nor have I mentioned your name - there's a point, by the way. You'll be wanting a new alias; I am aware the public at large does not know you as Watson." He accepted the tea and drank deeply, his thirst evident.
Watson pondered all that. "I thought about the reasons I was chosen for many years," he admitted. "I thought it a curse at first; cursed to kill when I'd been a doctor in life. But eventually I learned how to let people live while getting what I needed, and I was able to set myself up as a doctor,  and obtain blood without either thrall or murder. The question always remained, though."
"There." He straightened his back and looked at Holmes. "I'll see you at Baker Street, if you return tonight. If not, tomorrow."
Watson nodded slowly. “I don't relish the idea of putting myself at risk. However, he likely has far more information about vampires than I do, and may be able to help in other ways as well. Besides, I wish to prove to him that you are not "just a thrall" to me. You are not disposable."
Watson stayed until dawn, until the very last moment possible and when he retreated into the dark space of the garret room for the day, the memory of Holmes' hand on his sleeve was like a spear of light in his chest that chased away the shadows.
Holmes stumped away after Newman, following him out the side door by the kitchen and across the small church grounds. At the end of the green lawn stood a sturdy cottage of grey stone. Modest in terms of the clergy, but comfortable.
Holmes looked no less nettled as he took a seat on the bench beside him. "Is that all? It is a plausible story. Men who harbor suspicions of unfaithfulness do not always let those suspicions overwhelm to the point of violence - or confrontation where violence is a possible outcome."
“Had Newman been the one to attack me, I would have. I had thought to frighten him off. At the time I believed him to be one man working alone; I did not know he was a thrall.”
"Yes, always just here," she affirmed. "I’d lay on the bed in his clinic room with this arm hanging free. He would give me a little chloroform for the pain, and to relax me. Then he would cut and let the bad blood drain away. I always swooned- I thought it was my delicate constitution."
“Shh, it is all right,” Holmes soothed, “I am here to help.” He knelt to examine the rings and found them securely locked but that was solved easily enough; Newman undoubtedly had the keys upon his person.
late chapter is late. Both editors got distracted by other shiny fandoms (The Witcher and Umbrella Academy, respectively).
“Fascinating,” he murmured, and pressed his ear to Watson's too-still chest, but no air stirred the lungs. He waited, marking the time. It took a full five minutes for that vampiric heart to produce a slow, solitary thump.
Mycroft entered the room and stared hard at his brother, no sign that either affection or worry for the younger Holmes had ever touched his heart.
Watson fortified himself a bit and did not answer Holmes in words, instead radiating a brief feeling of reassurance. Now he knew what to expect, it was not so difficult. Watson was a vampire and a hundred years in the world and thus Holmes’ mind was not as strong as his when it came to sheer power, in the same way a trickle of water was no match for a stone. But when Holmes brought the full weight of his mind to bear the experience was less a trickling brook and more akin to being bashed by the relentless waves of a perpetually turbulent ocean. He could certainly endure it, but it wasn’t a terribly pleasant sensation.
Watson went back to work, finished his report, started another. Dissected bodies with professional indifference, cold hands sorting through intestines like rummaging through file drawers. He weighed organs, split open stomachs, examined bullet holes...and thought too much about Sherlock Holmes.
But Watson knew nothing of his intentions, and only laughed. “It is hardly of importance now. I am not so attached to material goods as most mortals. In any case, it achieved the goal. The world thinks me dead.”
Newman smirked, noting the momentary surprise. “Perhaps you are not so indispensable as you believed.”
"It was overwhelming almost immediately," Watson confessed, shaking his head incredulously. "And my mind is stronger than it was when I was mortal. I cannot fathom living with such a maelstrom."
“I don’t know why you never bothered to learn it,” Mycroft replied. “It is one of the easier European languages to master.”
Watson snorted at the cryptic phrasing. "I wonder what way he would have in mind. One that does not involve you?"
"It’s abhorrent. So, this boy - a man now, by the size of his footprints - escaped? He's dangerous, Holmes. Any idea where we can find him?"
“What?” he said stupidly, blinking like an idiot. How was it Holmes had the ability to muddle him so easily, even broken as he was?
True to his word, Holmes kept tertiary contact with Watson, though he had not yet received any news of the doctor's former patient.
Watson sucked at his lip for a moment before answering. "It is not like human hunger, Holmes. It is not a gradually growing thing that can be ignored for a time. The blood we drink sustains us completely...until the moment it does not. After that, the decline is both swift and merciless. We
Sturgerson looked like he wanted to argue, but didn’t. The elder Holmes gave him a quick, searching look and seemed to soften very slightly. He then continued in a gentler tone, “In any case, it is best not to encourage them. It may be that the problem solves itself in another week.”
"We are well prepared and protected. We have wards and guards; no vampire can penetrate these walls.” He paused, and for a moment Holmes thought Mycroft might go so far as to try and reach for him. But his hands stayed by his sides, and he said only, “Try to sleep now, brother."
But Holmes did not recruit unobservant children, and Georgie turned quickly to look at him, a question in his eyes. "Mr. Holmes? Are you alrih' sir?"
"I know Father Newman came to Saint Cyprian's church a little over three months ago. I know shortly after that, the unfortunates in the area began disappearing with greater frequency. I know those destitutes who make their home around the church refuse to step foot in the place, hence why Blevins - a stranger to the area - was singled out. I know a channel was recently cut into the stone floor of the secret room in the cellar, and iron rings fastened to the wall. The maid leaves before dusk, the parrot is kept in the shed, and there are no visitors to the clergy house after nightfall. And finally, I know Father Newman took entirely too keen of an interest in
Holmes sighed, setting his hand to his temple, feeling the bandages that covered the stitches which held his head together. "I would have done things far differently if I had known. But, it is pointless to dwell on it now. We must look to the future. The sire will know his protege is dead; he will come looking for answers. Perhaps not himself- it is likely he will send someone. Either way, he will know the story in the papers is false. There was only one witness to the whole affair, and that is me. You are not safe here. Certainly not during the day. Not if he sends a thrall."
"Well, it remains to be seen if the reverend has your exceptional olfactory glands but even if he did, as you've pointed out; I have washed since he last knew me."
"Don't go near him, boy!" Mycroft shouted, spinning Georgie around and placing him behind him before turning to glare at Holmes. "You
Watson nodded and set to work, wrapping up the mess in the leftover sheet, ashes crumbling into a shapeless mass at the center. He tied it in a knot and set it aside. “We can take it with us when we leave. What next?"
But all too soon Watson was setting them down in an alleyway adjacent to the Diogenes and Holmes spared a moment to crush himself against the doctor’s cold body, seeking his lips. “Do be careful,” he whispered.  He could not bear to lose anyone else. Not again.
Mycroft’s eyes narrowed. “Let us examine the facts, then. He has fed recently, has he not? His complexion is close to human; only a vampire newly sated would look so flushed. This morning a corpse is pulled from the Thames, drained of blood and dead before it hit the water. Your doctor took a detour through Bethnal-Green two nights ago; if you did not observe the evidence of such yourself, I would call you a simpleton. The body,” he said flatly, "was found in the shallows of Limehouse dock.”
Holmes nodded. "Thank you," he said, tossing her a coin and she caught it, looking at it in confusion.
"For the moment, it is to wait. To move against Newman the evidence must be irrefutable, else the church will step in to shield him."
He glanced down to find the pen in his hand crushed to a twisted mélange of metal and ink, black morass dripping down, pooling on the desk and creeping towards his medical journals like the piceous tendrils of some monstrous deep-sea creature. It reminded him of ichor, of blood. It reminded him he had forgotten to feed this week...
Holmes' patience had long worn thin and was now verging on nonexistent. He turned again, movement too quick to be born of anything but the deepest anger. "If you have something you would like to tell me, I suggest you do away with the theatrics and do so."
Newman guided him to the back area of the church, the same small kitchen Father Deighton had brought him to when he thought his name was Blevins and there too was the vicar, pouring over a small, black leathered bible with a golden crucifix engraved on the cover.
Watson fidgeted like a schoolboy. “Nothing, I-I simply...I don’t really do this sort of thing, beyond the necessity of feeding.”
Holmes called upon his talents as an actor and gave her a reassuring smile. "Stay here, wait for my word. Either someone is after your husband or your husband is after someone. Either way, I wish you to be safe." The fear in her face made him curse Watson anew.
Watson nodded, taking his leave and Holmes watched until the very last moment, until he was through the window and gone, silent as he slipped over the rooftops while dawn brightened the sky.
Other things however seemed to hold a kernel of truth: aversion to light and silver, unnatural strength, the need to drink blood. He suspected driving a wooden stake through one’s heart
"I am aware of it," Holmes answered, darkly knowing. "Whoever the sire is, he is incredibly clever- and patient. We must ask ourselves if the sudden rash of men out for your blood once the vicar learned of your existence was entirely coincidental. Knowing what we do now, it is likely it was not. For years now there has been only one vampire in London; a rouge element without clan or status, and every immortal player of the Great Game knew it. But they did not know who you were. Your anonymity has been your greatest weapon; it is now gone. There is little chance Newman did not send word of you. You have been identified, doctor. The game is afoot."
A simple room, a barren room and even now his mind worked to a minimal degree. He understood it was not a room at all but a cage, a prison and the prisoner lay tied to a stout metal bed, lashed by thick leather bonds inscribed with strange symbols and ending in a pair of silver cuffs closed tight around two bone white wrists.
But tonight he had a prize in his sights. A toff gent in a fine suit that had clearly taken a wrong turn and become lost, and who had about him the air of someone unused to the brutal realities of life. Someone who had never had to watch their back, or wonder where their next meal was coming from. Nock hated him on principle, and the only reason he hadn’t yet attacked was that animal instinct – honed by a violent life on the London streets and the only real intelligence he possessed – that inexplicably told him to be cautious.
"Shh," Watson said, trying to soothe, trying not to feel the clench in his heart as Holmes cried out for Stamford. "It's alright, you're alright, you're safe..."
"I had never encountered a vampire, yet here you are." Holmes rejoined, removing his hat and running a careless hand through his hair. "An open mind is vital in the pursuit of science, Watson. Closed eyes observe nothing."
Watson hummed thoughtfully. "It is an interesting plan. However, you will not be of much use tonight." The kettle whistled and Watson took it off the fire, filling the teapot and releasing a heavy herbal scent to waft through the room. Watson prepared a cup, handing it over with a congenial smile. "Drink this," he instructed, "it's a mixture of my own creation. The ingredients all bolster the production of blood and warm the body. You'll need two full cups to replenish what was lost, though even then you will be weak for some time yet. You are welcome to rest here for the night."
be rash enough to murder a man and leave his body floating in the open canal where it would most certainly be discovered, and at the very time he is attempting to ingratiate himself to the Diogenes? To what purpose?"
Fortunately, Watson had at least included the address of the billiards hall which was the focus of his fruitless inquiry, and thus spared Holmes the trouble of tracking it down.
“Whatever his strategy,” Mycroft said, “he is almost certainly ready to set it in motion. The body pulled from the Thames is his opening gambit; he will likely wait to see how we respond.”
"I trust no one," Montressor hissed, but a moment later held something out to him; it was a crucifix of fine silver, similar to the one Langley had worn. "Take this," he said, thrusting it through the crack in the door. Holmes reached out and wrapped his hand around it firmly, keeping his eyes locked on Montressor's. The man relaxed the slightest bit and opened the door wide enough for Holmes to slip inside, the deadbolt clicking into place behind him. Before him was a small but comfortable sitting room, fire blazing in the hearth.
“It chronicles the history of the Irish clans back to the days of Richard Strongbow,” Mycroft told him.  “Included within are copies of any heraldic crests that could be identified, both legitimate and otherwise.”
The morning after Father Newman returned from his forced sabbatical he came to visit Holmes in his shed, the later only just having woken and readying himself to feed the birds. The priest asked after his health in a stiff manner, and Holmes responded by rote. Newman then lingered by the door, regarding Holmes in an odd silence, the shadows on his face filled with secrets. Finally he spoke, words seeming to be pried from his chest by a crowbar.
The elder Holmes was looking at him in faint disappointment. “Think, Sherlock. Use those besotted wits our ancestors gave you and look at the thing logically.”
"It was the day before his death. He had come to me for confession." Deighton gave Holmes an appraising look. "I am sure you know I can share nothing of what he told me in confidence. "
Holmes paused in the hallway, took a breath. “Because fire is one of the very few things that can kill a vampire, and Doctor Jackson must die. An empty warehouse would be too suspicious.”
"My usual clothes," he said with amusement, wondering where Holmes was going with such odd questioning. "A grey suit."
The morning dawned cold and sharp, frost leaving fingerprint whorls on the window panes as it passed through the city, pushed forward on an icy autumn wind, the world turning cold and grey beneath a hard October sky.
Sturgerson hurried over and peered at Holmes intently. “It does appear to be fugue,” he agreed. “Let me fetch the elder Mister Holmes, he has a better understanding of the condition than myself-”
But there was little to be gained from standing uselessly about mooning over the past, and even less by clinging to such childish feelings as jealousy over a man who a fortnight ago hadn't even known he existed. He had a job to do, a murderer to catch, and, perhaps, a detective to keep an eye on. He had meant what he'd said the last time they spoke; he would not allow harm to come to Sherlock Holmes.
Watson sighed quietly, retreating back up the steps and recalling with new understanding all the times Stamford had lamented both Holmes' impossible sleeping schedule and the impossibility of persuading him to alter it. Secretly, Watson had thought his friend likely to be exaggerating.
Holmes did, pulling away from the immediate problem to consider parliament, the library, and England as a whole...
Holmes picked up a tin and gave it a light shake; it rattled with the unmistakable sound of coinage. "His wages for the week I assume...curious he would leave it behind, don't you think?
"And we know for certain now they are coming here, likely in force. I wonder if this mysterious sire will appear himself, or rely solely upon his thralls? He surely has other vampires at his disposal, other fledglings he can call upon."
“Not a great deal, and there we are at a disadvantage. At the moment our mysterious friend knows far more about us than we do about him. However, if we can identify this crest, we shall know a good deal more.”
“I cannot go to a hospital,” Holmes continued in that same reasonable tone that made Watson want to wallop some sense into him, “unless you have a suitable answer for how I ended up there when I can neither stand nor crawl."
"I did not know that the effect ranged beyond immediate memory, but if so that makes my work much easier."
Mycroft snorted. "We shall see about that. Sit,” he directed, claiming the middle chair for himself and thus ensuring Holmes and Watson would be separated. Watson glanced at him with faint trepidation, then took the chair on the left. Holmes shared the look, his concern bordering on worry because he did not underestimate his brother. Many people did, judging the elder Holmes on his girth and idleness and seeming lack of ambition.
Holmes’ brows reached for his hairline. “Since when have you ever cared for the progression of science?”
The conversation lulled, and the silence between them was not as easy a thing as it had been in times past. Holmes was keenly aware that Mycroft did not trust him, and that his insistence that he stay at the Diogenes was done as much to keep a watchful eye on him as it was to protect him from external forces.
"Until now your danger has been from your own kind. Now the night will be as dangerous as the day. He
Holmes dragged himself off the man, though there was hardly anywhere to go. Propped up against the wall the pain finally overran his senses, and he dropped into a fugue.
As he left Holmes reflected on the fact that he had probably felt like a greater villain sometime in the past.
On the whole, he adapted to this sharp turn in his world-view with almost philosophical aplomb. After all, science itself was continuously challenging man to redraw the boundaries of his knowledge in an ever-expanding attempt to understand the fundamental principium of the universe. If this was a somewhat extreme example, it was essentially no different. Should he reject the facts in front of him simply because they did not align with his preconceived notions of the world? Of course not. The rational thing, the
!" he hissed. "'Why' is still a matter of investigation. And I cannot say for certain that she is, only that it is a possibility which must be examined. I find myself...hobbled, in this matter." He looked at Watson meaningfully. "I need your assistance, old boy. I cannot bring the Yard into it; to do so would run a great risk of exposing you, and we both know how that ends. But I cannot be as many places as I am needed."
is a predator; that we are self-aware does not negate this. Likewise, you are now a predator of men. You would not be very effective if you were not
that much; he had been in the man’s head not two hours ago. Besides, were he to turn his senses in that direction, he would still be able to feel Holmes' desire shimmering around him like a heat mirage. Holmes still thought he loved Watson and still wanted him and both those feelings were a product of thrall, ergo it was not yet gone. In any case, it had not even been a full week since the thrall began; not nearly long enough for it to fade.
“It was incredibly stupid,” Watson said again, and handed Holmes another glass of brandy. They had been discussing Holmes’ decision to willfully fugue. Or rather, Watson had been discussing it, in great long paragraphs that accentuated just how foolish he thought Holmes had been, interspersed with the occasional question as to what flavor of idiocy could have possibly driven him to disregard Watson’s warning.
“Do you think we should tell them?” He asked, holding the papers up. Mycroft glanced at them and his mouth formed a craggy frown that cut across his face like a chasm, dark thunderheads forming on the horizon.
It was like shaking hands with a corpse (and corpses were a subject Holmes had some experience with). The skin was marble smooth, strangely hard, and very cold. Jackson wrapped his hand around Holmes' and there was no give to the muscle, no pliancy to his skin.  Holmes had the thought that Jackson could break his hand with extraordinary ease if he wished to.
Father Deighton let out a slow breath and stepped aside. Newman appeared behind him, club in hand and unlike the vicar, there was no reticence to his character. He was a man who obviously enjoyed his work.
Watson found a vein, slid the needle home and there was another pinprick in his arm, one more hole in the collection of old friends that had born witness to so many of his darkest moods.
"I would explain, but you would hardly trust my words." He was taking in this revelation in stages, readjusting all he thought he knew of his brother and his life. (It seemed the world had him readjusting his thoughts quite a lot, lately.)
Watson was definitely not expecting that. The worry ratcheted up a notch. “Stamford? What on Earth has he to do with this business?”
"There is a question in all of this, though," Watson said. "How am I to feed? I'll no longer have a practice."
Holmes found himself approving of that answer. "And are you as my client willing to do as I ask, or must I maneuver around your natural inclination for immortal pigheadedness?"
Holmes could only shake his head, and repress a shudder. "Who was it that twisted that mind of yours so spectacularly? I wager you were not always so callous."
Holmes sighed. Under normal circumstances mysterious strangers knocking at Baker Street in the dead of night were Mrs. Hudson's purview but she was visiting a sister and so Holmes was obliged to deal with it himself, which he did by opening the upstairs window and shouting down,
and warmth spread through his body as he felt Watson shudder and sigh in the chair next to him. The warmth quickly turned to desire and he found himself reluctant to stop as a drunken feeling of uninhibitedness washed over him. The world softened and shone like a morphine high and he could feel Watson's Will singing in his veins, taking hold of his mind but it was akin to a gentle embrace rather than an iron grip and he sank into it, unafraid.
Holmes put rather long odds against that but saw no benefit in sharing such an opinion, however correct it was likely to be. "Is there a way to send a secure message to you? If you are under observation, I will not make a habit of calling."
Holmes forced his own features into a mocking smile. "What an interesting brand of Christianity you've been practicing," he remarked, throat dry as dust and voice scraping. The impertinence earned him nothing but another slap.
He got hit again, this time on his injured leg and he cried out, pain blooming sharp and hot as a poker. He twisted against the iron shackles, nerves afire, grinding his teeth together and forcing himself to breathe through the pain as sweat beaded on his forehead.
That was nothing more than what he’d expected to hear. “Tell me then, what did you find when you searched the clergy house?"
say that would mean anything much to him at all? They were hardly friends. More grudging acquaintances, bound together for a time through happenstance and the shared loyalty to a dead man.
"You did not merely thrall my brother," Mycroft replied, “for thrall seeks to impose the will of the vampire over that of its victim. It erases autonomy and choice, and is both temporary and deliberate. Bonding is quite a different occurrence, involving the fusing of two wills into one; the connection of one soul to another, were we to take a theological perspective. It is
"Watch them," he said flatly. “If that creature tries to feed from my brother, kill it.” He left, and Sturgerson pulled out a small revolver no doubt loaded with silver bullets, setting it well within Watson’s line of sight and easily within reach, should it be required. Sturgerson was perhaps more willing than other slayers to give the benefit of doubt in Watson’s favor, but he was still Diogenes, and he would still not hesitate to shoot Watson through the heart if he deemed it necessary.
"In this area? That is concerning if true," the vicar said. "Aside from the church itself, the homeless do not often gather in this neighborhood. We do what we can for them, but..." his voice trailed off.
"Take off your jacket," he Ordered smoothly, sliding his hand through Holmes' hair. "And unbutton your shirt."
Lestrade looked doubtful but kept his opinions to himself, turning the conversation down other paths. "In any case, in light of new evidence there's some speculation as to how this business might have tied into the murder of Nelson Langley.”
Th priest was unmoved, hand and gun still steady. “None; I am a man of my word. I offer them work and shelter, and a chance to save themselves from sin. I provide all of these things, in due time.”
"You won't like this," he said apologetically before ripping off the trouser leg around Holmes' injured knee. It had been shattered to a pulp, bone sticking out through the flesh and Watson's face contorted in anger and sympathy before he bit into his wrist and let a few drops of blood fall into the wound, then repeated the process with Holmes' arm and head and thigh, anywhere the damage seemed particularly severe.
He was an utter lunatic. Among the patrons of Saint Cyprian’s he was known as an impulsive and anxious man, easily disturbed, with the singular habit of cornering unwary parishioners and regaling them with horrific stories of his time in the war. It was no secret the man was of unsound mind and requested a private meeting of confession with the vicar nearly every day.
Holmes’ gave an indecipherable hum. Next to him, Lestrade looked increasingly put-upon, the small man shifting weight from foot to foot in agitation.
“When there is no work,” he heard himself continue, “I suffer from ennui; it is a most unbearable condition and I become unbearable under its weight. Stamford knew when I could be cajoled out of such moods and when I could not; I suspect he was a frequent visitor of yours during those darker times. When I have work, it makes me unbearable in an entirely different fashion. I give no thought to food or rest. Indeed, I give little thought to anything save the problem in front of me, the puzzle that requires solving. It gives me a focus; a match in the mineshaft so to speak and I can do nothing but follow it to its eventual end. There is a small space between times, at the conclusion of a successful case and before the boredom catches me that I think I might be a reasonable person to be around, but such moments are few and far between. And now...now I am suffering from the worst of both worlds.”
William Stamford had been dead for six months, and Holmes blamed himself every single day. He hardly needed a ghoul coming to his door to remind him.
He would endure any physical punishment over the slow death of ennui and Mycroft, keenly aware of this fact, had offered a solution. At least for awhile.
Newman face was a darkened mirror that reflected nothing. "I've forgotten," he said boldly, and the corner of Holmes' mouth twisted up.
Mycroft looked at his brother sadly for a moment, but it was quickly covered by cold steel. "Then you will not be surprised when I say I do not wish you to meet with him."
A crease appeared between Watson’s brow, and he frowned. “Stand. Up,” he said again, putting more of his Will into the command, making it an Order.
He arrived at Holmes’ flat the next evening, coming down from the roof and landing on the thin ledge of windowsill as securely as any man stood on solid ground. Holmes had left the widow unlocked and Watson let himself in, finding the detective deep in whatever chemical experiment had caught his attention some hours ago.
“And you think the vicar was behind them,” Holmes finished, Lestrade's face telling him that was exactly what he thought. Well, that was all right. Let Lestrade tie it up however he liked,  so long as Watson was safe.
Holmes said nothing, still waiting, dissecting the doctor with his eyes and obviously finding him lacking.
Holmes was nothing if not perceptive. Watson was paler even than usual, skin so white the few veins that still had blood in them stood out sharply, his eyes a dark indigo shaded with malice, desperation and hunger.
"It is all quite biblical," Newman assured him, "supported by scripture. God loves the sacrificial lamb."
It was late afternoon by the time Montressor returned, furtive look on his broad features as he stepped quickly out of a brougham cab and threw himself inside the shop, door banging shut behind him. A moment later he was pushing the young girl out the door, a look of surprise on her face as the sign in the window flipped from open to closed.
"I have uncovered many truths in the course of my work that have remained hidden for the greater good," Holmes responded, the words thick with irony.
"They won't need to get that close to kill you!" Watson snapped, at least understanding something of Stamford's oft lamented vexation with the detective. It was all well and good to know Holmes' cavalier attitude toward his own well-being was fueled by an almost preternatural desire for justice and a desperate need for mental stimulation, but that didn't stop Watson from wanting to throttle him for it.
"I love you too," he answered softly, almost desperately. "I do, I swear it. Don't let your brother fool you into thinking anything different."
And suddenly Watson understood Holmes’ reticence, his somber mood. Stamford hadn’t just hidden the truth from him; he had kept him deliberately blind to it. That would not sit well for a man like Holmes.
Watson gave him a look that held a hundred exasperated questions within it but did as instructed, which was fortunate because Holmes didn't have time to argue with him. If he was to 'kill' Doctor Jackson and keep the fire from spreading through the neighborhood, he had to time things perfectly.
Watson inhaled, something akin to a chill running down his spine as he acknowledged the truth of Holmes’ words. It now seemed the height of coincidence that Stamford would just
"Were you present when the police made their inspection?" He asked the woman, stepping over to examine the bookshelf.
"Yes. I told you, I wish to keep an eye on you. I can afford no more bloodless corpses turning up on rooftops; I am out of tricks."
"I am aware of it. Save that I would attempt to intervene on his behalf, and possibly be injured myself."
"Not yet. Had I known your intentions before I would have advised against it, but you are here now. Leaving abruptly in the midst of this case would do nothing but cast more eyes your direction."
"Thank you for your patience, Father. I can now say I am more certain than ever that Mister Blevins met with an unfortunate end. This is a good church, your employees are satisfied, your wages fair. You gave Mister Blevins food and shelter, and from all appearances he was grateful for the work. Why would such a man disappear into the night, leaving both money and coat behind, with no word to anyone? Something is not right."
Holmes face was serene, and gave nothing away. "Unfortunately I do not know what questions the police have asked," he replied. "I am not affiliated with them on that particular case and thus am not privy to the details of their work. But as I am here and the murder has yet to be solved, I saw no harm in asking. Idle questions often open doors to the most surprising places."
"I'm not entirely certain," Holmes replied, splintered glass feeling in his throat every time he drew breath. "I was somewhat...impaired, during the excitement." His head lolled to the side and he winced, pain very real despite Watson's earlier attentions.
Holmes laughed at him. "Whatever my sins, they are between myself and whatever God may exist. If there is such a being, you forsook him the moment you decided to murder people in his name. If there is not, there is certainly no point in 'confessing' anything to you."
need to breathe, but he swore Watson was sustaining him, breathing for him. Watson was the air in his lungs and the blood in his veins.
The gentleman took an antique watch from his pocket and glanced at it, hastening his steps as he moved toward better, lighter streets and Nock was not about to let such pickings get away; the watch alone would afford him liquor and women for weeks. He pulled out his weapon - a Sheffield knife he'd taken off the body of a man he'd once killed in a bar fight - and slinked like a hungry dog out of the tar-black shadows of the alley.
Watson pondered how Holmes considered his natural state to be overworked and overwhelmed with data like some kind of machine. He was a marvel - not just to look at, but to hear those racing surface thoughts.
"Not for my face, only the lack of injury. It will not do much good against our enemies, I fear. I helped you and therefore it is likely they already believe me to have been under your thrall; it is no great stretch to assume you would heal me as well. But for the rest of the world, Sherlock Holmes must remain an invalid."
"But I would only be able to go in the evening, it would be improper for a bachelor to call upon a lady at such an hour," Watson protested, strangely conscientious of the rigors of English society, those wholly mortal customs.
sit down. Not until he felt like it, which he certainly did not. "On the surface, it would appear he is attempting to save their souls, though I am not certain that is the case," he replied, ignoring Watson's attempts to nanny him.
He looked about, pondering if there were any reason at all to stay awake and was moderately surprised to find himself in a private room rather than one of the crowded medical wards crammed wall-to-wall with beds and dying men.
Holmes’ chest was heaving, and he stared at Watson with eyes fogged by desire. “Yes...Master,” he breathed, because nowhere on the list did Holmes tell Watson not to let him use the title. Such a thing wouldn’t have occurred to either of them. It was a shock of cold water on Watson’s fevered mind and he pulled back, flinching as if the word had been a physical blow against his skin. Something about it felt
He pulled the cravat from his neck and fashioned a crude tourniquet, wrapping it tightly around his thigh and applying pressure to the wound with his jacket. The smell of blood filled his nose, the whole room heavy with it.
"The things I do for you," he muttered to Stamford under his breath as he tied the helpless man up. He then secured him in the storage room, made certain both bonds and gag were secure and locked up with Montressor's key before sneaking out the back, stealing a packet of matches on the way out. In the alley behind the store he tore off his disguise and stuffed it into the bottom of a rubbish bin, then headed up the stairs to the flat above, knocking urgently on the door.
Mycroft sighed heavily. "Irresponsible," he intoned as they approached the front door. Mycroft’s personal carriage waited street-side for them, and his trusted valet, Carruthers, stepped down to help Holmes up into the clarence.
"I had long feared for Mister Langley's well-being. As I said, he was a troubled man. But I had no reason to assume he would be murdered. I will not lie and say he bought joy and happiness to all who knew him, but nor can I believe he was capable of incurring the sort of enmity that would have cost him his life."
Holmes smiled slightly. “Very good, Doctor. What better excuse than that he was being pursued by an all-to-real evil? Your stunt at the church would have such men as these on high alert- they would know something unholy stalked the streets of London." To his credit, Watson at least had the decency to look chagrined.
She nodded. "Oh Mister Holmes! Please, please find him!" Then she shrank back inside, locking the door behind herself and closing up the shutters.
“Fight him!” Watson shouted, though of course his words would mean nothing to Holmes right now, not while under the influence of an Order. Watson grabbed the back of his chair and spun him around, pushed him away.
“I don’t see the harm, and after all, it is something to do.  Besides, as Mycroft says, we may learn something of value.”
,” Watson replied after a quiet moment of his own. “Stamford was the only person I had trusted in a hundred years.”
Watson froze, overcome perhaps by more than just the verbal bite of Holmes' words, but the emotional impact of them as well - all of the pain and ache inside Holmes, the void in his heart that was broken and empty.
"Save their souls? By murdering them? He sounds like a sadist with a fancy excuse for inflicting pain."
"Indeed. Who can say what either of us shall feel a week from now? But regardless, it has been a gift. Kiss me again."
Watson felt his interest pique. Stamford had spoken to him once or twice of these fugue states, to beg his opinion as a medical man. But of course all his information came second hand, and Watson had been unable to give him much practical advice. He had hinted that he might have better luck were he able to speak to Holmes himself, but Stamford assured him of the impossibility of such an interview, as Holmes was reluctant enough to speak of his fugues even with Stamford, and he would certainly not confide in a stranger. (That, at least, had been true enough, though of course Stamford had other reasons for keeping himself and Holmes away from each other. It was certain that had they ever met, Holmes keen skills of observation would have immediately made Watson an object of interest and Holmes would not have rested until he had learned the truth.)
... it is unbearable." He shifted, shoulders hunched up like a twisted thing, Quasimodo in his bell tower. He drew a long breath on his pipe, watching Watson through a grey curl of smoke. The doctor still didn’t understand.
"I don't, but it is obvious you do. Should such a belief lead you to criminal or dangerous actions which put either yourself or those around you in peril, it would be my moral obligation to stand in your way. Any confidence you believe we have would be null."
"You would be surprised at the damage an incompetent doctor can do," he snipped, carefully unwinding the bandages around Holmes’ shoulder and knee, prodding gently at the wounds. Fortunately the blood Watson provided had caused both injuries to begin healing at a preternatural rate, and free from all signs of infection. Though the shoulder had been stitched closed the knee was still an open wound, but inside bones were mending faster than they should, and exposed flesh granulating. All-in-all, good signs that Holmes would heal in due course.
“We’ve no reason to suspect anyone but the vicar and Newman. No one else was allowed inside the clergy house aside from the maid, and she weren't permitted upstairs." He shook his head, rubbing at his face. Lestrade was a practical man but he was also devout; this case had rattled him rather more than he cared to admit. "A vicar, murdering half a dozen people, and for what reason? To "save" their souls? It's depraved. And his own son a prisoner!"
“Weren’t you?” Holmes asked, words pointed enough to cut and Watson felt the floor drop away from under him.
“Whatever she knows you can likely get from Montressor himself. The man is mad," Holmes said truthfully enough. "I doubt you will have much trouble getting a confession of one sort or another from him.”
He nodded gravely. “From the silver cuffs left on the bed. The leather had been carved with binding runes; such spells are used to hold evil creatures. When the police report stated that the bodies recovered from the church yard were drained of blood, we knew it must be a vampire, and likely the same one that killed Nelson Langley a month ago.” His eyes narrowed sharply. “I was uncertain how much you truly knew of the business.”
"What - what should I do, then? I want no more bloodshed, Montressor is only trying to protect his wife."
For all that, Watson let go after only a small drink and watched in fascination as Holmes’ neck healed itself in front of his eyes, the vampiric blood that now suffused his body doing its duty and knitting mortal flesh together. So long as the thrall was maintained, he would heal far more quickly than a normal man.
Holmes glanced at him, sucked in a breath with a slow hiss. "Were that my intention I would not have agreed to help you in the first place. My mind is far from made up about you, but its verdict will hinge entirely upon your own actions. I do not know what crimes you have committed in the past, though I can tell easily enough they burden you. That burden alone proves you have not left your humanity entirely behind. That, and Stamford's opinion of you give me reason enough to trust you. For now."
"The police already came by a few days ago," the woman told him. "Not sure what you're expecting to find."
Holmes observed her openly and without shame, concluding she must be a great beauty by the standards of the day - if one were inclined to notice such things.
Deighton backed fearfully away, one hand up in a futile attempt at defense, the other making the sign of the cross over his body. But there was no God in this place and had not been for a very long time. Watson grabbed him almost as an afterthought, flinging him against the wall with shocking strength. The impact caved the back of the vicar’s head in and he slid down the wall in a crumpled heap of bones, a red streak of gore trailing behind him.
Montressor eventually roused from his nightmare, waking in slow confusion at finding himself in the alley behind his shop. He stumbled to his feet, movements graceless and uncertain as he slowly made his way around the corner and up the narrow steps to his flat.
"No?” Jackson asked, a dangerous timbre to the word. “Why not? By your own definition I am alive in some way or another, and a man plans to murder me. Is it not justice to aid in his capture?"
