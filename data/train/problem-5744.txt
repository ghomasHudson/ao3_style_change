The sun had yet to come up fully when Toni awake from her nightmare. It was just breaking through the distant clouds, signaling how early it was. There was still a chill in the air from the night sky and a morning frost lined the grass. "S-Steve," she choked out, mindlessly reaching for him. However, to her displeasure, his side of the bed was empty and
Though the pain lessened, she still felt like she was on fire, still felt like her skin was melting, but with Aldrich in front of her, the pain was at the back of her mind as he served as a good distraction. And her anger was strong. "You're something else," Toni muttered out, feeling her heart flip as she struggled with the whirling emotions in her head. She also tried to ignore the itch under the skin, not that she would be able to scratch it being tied to the bed. And she felt like she was itching everywhere.
With that, Steve laid down next to her, as he removed the clothes that he could with the squid wrapped around him, refusing to let go. Feeling at home, he fell asleep missing the two pair of eyes watching them.
Pierce pulled back his arm and put the picture back in his pocket. "Scrub him. Double the voltage. I want it deep and through. I don't want him to remember anything."
"I want to know," he said as he chased after her. She remained a few feet in front of him, and it wasn't because she was faster than he. He could catch her at any second, but the chase was fun. "You have to tell me."
Sharon reached for phone and sat it on the counter in front of her. "Or maybe, the question I should ask: Do you know what love is?" There was a softness in her voice, and even if the question hit Toni line a ton of bricks, there was no judgement in her voice. "Have you ever been in love before, Toni?"
Loki finally reached her, standing inches from her, as he stared down at her. "You'll find breaking one of my deals is harder than it seems."
Before seeing her that raw, he had all the intention of killing her, which would have angered his handler though he didn't care. Sure, killing a target that he wasn't permitted to would put him in the chair, and the Asset would do anything to avoid the chair, but he would do anything to rid himself of this disease, which was what these emotions were. They were a disease, but after disarming her security system somewhat—not completely as she would notice—and going in to kill her, the Asset froze on sight of her. His body didn't listen to his commands and refused to move, which was something he could and would never understand. He still couldn't understand why she made him feel like this.
Toni's face lit up as she crossed Bruce. "Finally, someone who speaks English," she cheered as she patted the scientist on the shoulder.
"Not everything is about you, Howard," Peggy said, glancing between the two before she stepped to Toni. It was clear that she had seen his pain as well. "In the beginning, Toni, I wasn't your fan and I didn't trust you," Peggy stated, changing the subject. "I was ready to write you off, and I was annoyed when Phillips didn't, but now, I see that I was mistake. I'm sorry for how I treated you."
"I'm not going to sleep with you," she snapped, taking a step to him. She briefly wondered how he thought she was pretty, looking like she did. She was covered in sweat and mud, her clothes were filthy, and her hair was a mess.
Toni's eyes widened as she took in the woman in front of her. "Sharon?" she uttered as her heart started to come down, returning to normal levels. "Sharon Carter." With the woman in front of her, Barnes became almost a distance memory. Questions started to form in her head.
"You didn't want to talk about it and I can see that. I don't know what it is, but I know it can't be good." Barnes took a deep breath. "And I know Steve. He wouldn't have dropped it if you didn't tell him something." He ran his hand through his hair. "He can be so annoying sometimes. Sometimes, I just want to…" He drifted off.
Toni, who had no interest of making this easy, stuck her arm outs and took a few steps toward Peggy as if to allow her to handcuff her. Peggy eyed her, clearly not buying how easy Toni stuck her arms out, but she still proceeded to handcuff her. Toni winked as Peggy slapped the handcuff down on her left hand, but when she tried to do the same with the right, Toni yanked back her left arm startling Peggy, who stumbled forward. Using this for her advantage, she swung at Peggy's face.
a voice inside of her head said. Barnes mentioned that Rogers spent days looking for her; he had to pissed, but he needed to get over it. "I don't need to rest." She hobbled toward Rogers. "You worry too much."
Back to the point, Toni had grown out of the world domination phase many years ago—too much work-, though some like Hawkass might think otherwise. Although…Maybe, it was Barton, who had the dream to take over the world and he was taking it on her. Projecting on her. It was
That was why Toni could never join the military or any government agency; she couldn't blindly follow orders or remain silent when she had something to say. It was a wonder that she worked so well with the Avengers…well it depended on who was asked. Captain America might disagree with that, as they were always fighting over something.
Up close, Steve could hear Tony Stark’s breathing—the weight of it, the labored intensity of it.  He wanted to rip the metal off his skin, but Natasha insisted, over and over, “It’s tied right in.  Either he takes it off—”
them, and now—”  Tony struggled to his feet, ignoring the deep burn in his back, surprised when a gentle push at his back kept him from toppling sideways.  He rested a hand on Marker’s head, steadying himself.  “Now you have to ask, is one dragon worth it?”
Steve said, “I was here first,” and saw a brief flash of mingled annoyance and glee in Tony’s expression, before he shook his head and took off for second base.
Hey, champs! 🐼❤️ Hope you like this one! Your support warms my heart, and it is truly a joy to write for you.
Had it happened in isolation, Tony Stark would not have survived.  Humans had never survived for long in isolation; from the dawn of time, they had dragged their brethren uphill, against mortal odds, until their mortal wounds closed over, leaving recorded scars behind.  A human fossil record recounted these sobering tales of joint survival.  Tony could bitterly add his own survival story to the scientific ledger as proof that humans could endure anything, so long as that endurance did not occur in terrible isolation.
An impalpable layer of ice clung to Steve Rogers’ skin, but even it felt more removable than the armor Iron Man wore, breathed, walked in, inhabited.
and ten thousand other things Steve learned after the thing-they-did-not-talk-about).  Rico sniffed at Tony’s right arm.  Steve introduced politely, “His name’s Rico.”
“Your definition of exciting doesn’t concern me enough,” Tony retorted.  He made himself blink, then reached into a pocket and held up a small coconut delightedly.  “Hey, Stovok.”
Then Thor chucked a Gorn at them, sending all three to the sand.  Tony wheezed from the bottom of the pile, “Thanks, buddy,” and escaped.  The entangled Gorn bonked each other on the head a few times with closed fists, then remembered their actual target and stood, claws up.
“Shouldn’t be too hard,” Steve drawled, following him out of the observatory.  “Since it didn’t happen.”
“You don’t know that.”  Tony stubbed out the cigarette, closed it up in a tin case, then nodded over his shoulder.
Hill left.  Steve waited a full five seconds after her footsteps had retreated from the door before turning slowly to Natasha.
“Hell of a test run,” he rasped.  He ached suddenly for Pepper.  He longed for better days.  He was hungry.  And cold.  And lonely, surrounded by friends.  “Where’s—”  He could not say the word.  He dared not form it.  It was all a dream.  A hell-dream.  Another painful giggle, more air than sound, escaped him.
Rolling his eyes, Steve swiped the lollipop from him before he could unwrap it.  Tony frowned at him.
Thor had the decency to wait until Tony had arrived at third base.  “Swing for the fences,” Tony advised him.
As if Steve was holding him down.  Steve leaned back, halting briefly at the slice of pain that cut deep into his own torso, a gift from the Chitauri.  Then he said, “Let’s get you up.”
His soul ached.  It was not merely his heart or his chest or some bodily organ; but something much deeper, much more resounding.  It physically hurt; he wondered, idly and not fearfully, if the ache would kill him.
Marker ignored Hogan completely, staring right at Tony.  He had not changed—dragons grew explosively early on, then exponentially for the remainder of their extraordinarily long lives—but Tony had.  Tony had changed a lot, limping towards his dragon, feeling like strangers, again.
Tony awoke, braced against Marker’s huge, slow-moving belly.  He could hear Marker’s heart beating deep inside his chest, guarded by two sets of ribs and a nearly impenetrable scaly armor.  The strongest swords ever made could not pierce those bones.  Dragon killers preferred to go for the head.
“Don’t do too nice a job, I want a memento,” Tony instructed, pulling his arm away before Dr. Banner could spray the wound down, erase the memory.
Tony gave him a look.  “This is my favorite shirt,” Tony said, reaching down to tug on the white button-down.
With grim resolve, Steve followed.  He could already hear the animals out back, making strange close-mouthed calls, like cows lowing but softer.  He imagined the red-aproned butcher with a knife, berated his growling stomach for reasserting its interests, and prepared himself for the worst.  He had never shied from going to the butcher’s shop—on the rare occasion when he could
“Perfect,” Tony said.  “Mendenhall or Denali, we check out the ice or die by HACE, it’s your choice, buddy.”
“I don’t think it’s the Ba’ku,” Romanova interjected.  “I think it’s the planet.”  She thumbed the sky.  “I’d like to know what’s in those ‘ice crystals.’  And how a Class M planet can survive in a nova cloud.”
Shaking his head, Tony said, “This is the high ground.”  He gestured around.  “Shouldn’t we keep it?”  He thumbed the huge volcano at his back, maybe ten kilometers on foot.  “Or we could—”
.”  Furiously, he retracted the Pop-Tarts.  Thor retracted his own flask, still smiling, at peace with himself.  Then, to rub it in, Thor uncapped the flask—even from across the table, Steve could smell the surprisingly warm aroma emitting from it, like a fire crackling in the hearth—and lifted it to his lips.
Still dripping, Steve glared at Bruce, who looked almost wonderstruck, and Tony, who was holding a perfect poker face.  “I ain’t sorry,” Steve said firmly.  “I’m not gonna apologize.”  He could hear Clint refilling the bucket.  “And that’s final.”
“Capable,” Anij agreed calmly, “but we have chosen a different path.  We stick to ourselves.  It suits us.”
Tony and Romanova were on their feet, but Stovok had already splashed into the water, grasping the Hirogen’s flailing arm, heaving him forward.  Thor resurfaced, sputtering and clawing.  Stovok walked backwards, holding onto the Hirogen’s arm until Thor growled and shoved him ferociously aside.  “How
“There’s truly a lot you don’t know about me,” Tony sniffed.  Then, in a purposeful undertone, Tony added, “You ever have a brother?”
Steve looked at her for a long moment.  “I don’t know,” he said at last, deciding there was no world that he could begin to pry the mind of Tony Stark successfully.  All he could do was speak his own truth, and it was: “But I kinda wanna find out.”
was supposed to follow, he might be better off sticking with what he knew: tan trousers and non-threatening button-ups.  His own baseball cap felt just as silly as Tony’s sunglasses looked, but at least it almost matched the leather jacket that Natasha had convinced him to wear.
He turned to leave.  Thor grasped him by the shoulders, reminding him that he was a warrior, fearless in the face of the Chitauri and surely fearless in the face of such monsters, but it was not the monsters troubling him, it was the water, the water, the dappled light on the floor signaling they were in deep.
.  Tony zeroed in on the movement, watching with a mixture of curiosity and terror as Steve emerged from an impossibly narrow chasm.  “That—how,” he said faintly.
“Here’s your bear,” Bruce piped in, nearly dwarfed by the large, carnival-style, sadly-singed teddy bear, passing it off to Thor, who embraced it and him in a single arm.
Rico slept every night next in their bed, right to Tony, and Steve, for some reason, slept easier for it.
Sitting in a lone apartment with an entire box of pizza, Clint Barton watched the livestream and said aloud, “Grody.”  Then he switched to his own stream and acknowledged, “Yeah, I think they’re done.  Somebody snipe that, I want ‘Fuck Kevin’ on a t-shirt.”
“Me first,” Tony insisted, and then, propelled by the delirious volcanic fumes or pure relief, flung both arms around Stovok’s neck, squeezing hard.  The Vulcan tolerated it better than most—most would have simply chucked him over one shoulder into the mired abyss, maybe two hundred meters below—but Tony could feel the echo of colorful emotions, red exhaustion, blue curiosity, a hint of green that seemed intrinsic with longing,
“Gimme, gimme,” Clint insisted, swiping a ticket from Steve’s hand and looping the string around his neck.  “Bye!” he added, taking off.
He was not an item on Steve’s to do list, a project to be finished, a fascinating specimen to ogle over or a terrible man to be derided for his bad decisions.
“Come on up,” Tony invited, hooking an arm over the side of the truck and looking down at Steve expectantly.  Steve held his ground, glaring up at Tony.  Tony said, “Don’t be such a wet blanket.”
?” Steve repeated, unable to deny a certain—well, very quiet but very earnest wistfulness.  “You can’t be talking about the dinosaur.”
He would literally never live this one down, he thought mournfully, imagining all the future social gatherings full of laughter and shared drinks and constant reminders that he was less manly than Barton.
at the last second.  Stovok’s face twisted, a frown furrowing his brow, turning down his mouth.  “Never mind.”
Under settling shine of real moonlight, Tony floated above the Earth in his armor, astride his mighty dragon.
Steve frowned.  “A sparkler?” he repeated.  “Yeah, I’ve seen ‘em.  Get a lighter, get. . . .”  He snapped his fingers lazily, indicating the semi-urgent need for compliance.  Clint semi-urgently complied, leading Lucky inside the house and returning with a lighter.  “There, now we’re talkin’,” Steve murmured appreciatively.  “Let’s see some sparklers.”
Steve fished out some slimy fruit slices and tossed them down.  The hogs immediately hoovered them up.  “This is exactly how I thought my evening would go,” he said, “when you said we’d see some flowers.”  He scooped up some more apple slices before the hogs could settle on his pant legs, again tossing them to the dirt.
“First the Nibirans, now the Ba’ku.”  Shaking his head, Tony said, “You’re gonna get a big head.  I can feel it.”
There were all kinds of cars.  Big cars, small cars.  Cars in red, white, and blue—black, orange, and
, hey,” Steve warned, pinning Clint more firmly behind his arm as the two began scuffling in earnest.  “Pipe down or I will pull over.”
, he begged, as the monster on the other side of the door knocked again, purposefully gently.  It knew he was here, he thought, repressing a sob.  He had no hope of escaping detection for long, but the agony of being found rippled throughout him, making his skin prickle with spiders.  He just wanted to be safe.  Safe from those claws, the greedy ones, the helpful ones, the ones that wanted at his heart, no matter what.  If he let down his guard, he knew that they would use it to their advantage.
Steve awoke, his face smushed into the fabric of a carnival bear’s fur, his arm slightly stiff from being crimped in one position for so long.  Thor had finally, mercifully, abandoned the guitar, and the room, leaving a pseudo-silence over the space.  Steve blinked once peaceably, enjoying the quiet, then tensed, because if it was quiet then that meant something had happened.
Equal parts disturbed and comforted by the offer, he looked up as Tony returned, still grimacing and holding a hand to his head.  “No ice,” he said dismally.  “You’d think, for this kind of price point—anyway.  Take a walk with me?” he asked.
“I know what it is,” Tony grumbled.  Then he peeled a cookie dough ball off the tray and sighed euphorically, “Come to
Clint leaped right over the seat median, declaring cheerfully, “I’ll have you know, I was a champion car surfer.”
He stepped across the grassy meadow, taking it all in.  He declined to report back to the ship, offer an
He wasted no time, the third time around: he lunged and grabbed Iron Man, pinned his arms to his sides.  He felt the human underneath, felt the suit strain briefly against him, like it might throw him off.
Pain ricocheted up his spine, and he gritted his jaw to keep it inside.  He could not move, paralyzed with pain, even as Marker clawed out of the water, shook off—energetically scattering thousands of small, pointy shed—and finally ducked his head, nudging at Tony anxiously.  Tony made himself lift a hand to push back, but he was not capable of moving Marker anywhere, so the dragon stayed where he was.  “Stop it,” he whispered, barely able to speak.  “Go away.”
“Well, that one was almost usable,” Steve congratulated, sitting in a director’s chair, holding a jar of chocolate chip cookies in his lap.  “Could you try lifting your voice a little at the end?  You sound like you’re at a funeral, Tony.”
He stepped forward, and Steve grabbed him by the back of the shirt.  Snow had her head up, those very lethal horns and soulless black eyes aimed in the same direction.  Tony felt nothing.
Tony looked down at the half-Vulcan, half-Terran on his floor.  Erase the pointed ears, and he looked human.  But his tone was all Vulcan as he said, “It was a contact my people did not reciprocate.  But my mother . . . she welcomed the convergence.”
“Suit yourself.”  Clint stuck a piece in his own mouth, pocketing the rest.  “I haven’t been on a road trip in years.”
Tony folded his arms across his chest, looking genuinely disgruntled.  Then he said: “Wait a sec.  You’re here.  So—Purgatory.  Right?  There’s no way you’re going to Hell.”
Shaking his head, Tony lifted a hand to clasp the side of his head.  He had a headache.  He wanted to lie down.
in a Hydra prison cell, hallucinating a life after the War.  At least the hallucination provided complementary toothbrushes, he thought magnanimously.  He itched for a canteen to fill but settled for gulping down a few extra mouthfuls from the tap, torn between unquenchable delight at the fresh water and visceral dread that he was overusing a very finite supply.  Even he could not drink salt water.
Leaning her head back, she focused on freeing her hands from the ropes, though it took only a few seconds to realize that she wouldn't be able to break free of her restrains. It didn't mean she wouldn't look for a way out, because there had to be a way. She refused to believe that there was none. If she gave up, she wouldn't be a Stark.
"I don't know if I would consider you a god," she replied, bitterly. She remembered her stalker saying Loki's name before she passed out, but she had no idea why or how he was involved. What was his end game? Did this have to do with the promise he wanted her to make? Why did he want her to make a mystery promise? What could she possible give him that he wanted? The only thing she could think of was Odin's throne, but there was no way for her to give him that, even if she wanted to. What else could he want? What did he want besides ruling the world? Plus, he told her what he wanted wasn't a crime, so how could she help him? Toni had no idea.
Natasha took a deep breath. "Even if he does trick us, there isn't much he can do. Thor is keeping a close eye on him."
Toni didn't understand why she was even having this conversion. Why did she even care about his friendship? She didn't need his friendship, which served as a distraction. "Thank you for saving me from that ass." She paused as she studied the expression on his face. "But I don't need your explanation or your apology. You don't
She took a step into the alley and froze. Her nightmare returned, almost forcing her to her knees, as she could only see a hand around her neck, choking her. It was getting hard to breathe and she thought she was going to faint. "It's just an alley," she told herself as she tried to relax herself. She focused on the voices and not the images in her mind. "Just listen."
Shocked, Steve looked at Toni, who kept stuffing her face. It was weird to see her like this when a few hours ago she was shaking in his arms. He knew she hid behind a mask that she spent years putting up, but it hurt to see her hid. He hated that she felt the need to do so. He had the urge to reach for her, but he knew better. He had to let her come to him.
After a few seconds of silence, she took a deep breath as she looked between Peggy and Howard. Her tears had stopped and she did feel better after the talk with her father, but she knew she had a long day ahead of her. "So let's stop sitting here and get me home," she said, trying to put on a smile.
poster he was pointing too. She had seen that movie a hundred times; it had been one of her favorites growing up. "You want to see a romantic movie?" she asked. Most men would run from a lovely dovely movie. "It's a good movie. I had seen it quite a few times, but I'm not sure you will like it."
She winked in pain as he pulled her to her feet. With her Jello legs, she didn't think that she would be able to stand, but Schmidt's painful grip kept her on her feet. "What would you like to show me?" she asked as she felt her legs shake.
"I'll probably fall sleep on your chest, and I promise I won't drool," she admitted, softly. She didn't know why, but she wasn't dreading the idea of sleeping in his arms. It would probably be the only way she would be able to sleep.
"You don't want to do something else?" she asked. She was so up to playing wingman. "We can always go out."
"I see, but if you don't mind, I need to see Phillips," she said, having no interest in talking to Jones or anyone. It was too much work to be a smartass when she was a wreck on the inside.
"…You just found out that you're my father and you're already saying that? After everything? I know I pissed you off more times than not," she said, staring at him.
Natasha was always good at hiding her emotions, though she had been letting them out more often. It was nice to have a small window into her soul, but it was shut firmly right now. "SHIELD."
Toni had to keep telling herself that everything was okay, because she was under the belief that if you said it enough, it was true. It became true, and she needed that to be true, though she wasn't sure why she was feeling like this. Feeling like something was going to happen. Happy was going to be fine. The President was going to be fine. Rhodey was safe. Steve was by her side; she should be on cloud nine, but something was off. She was feeling odd, feeling like a stranger. No, she wasn't feeling like a victim, not saying she didn't still feel Aldrich Killian's disgusting hands. No, it just that she felt like she was in auto pilot mood, like someone else was driving.
"We're already putting together the best men," Phillips answered as he stepped to the side to allow Toni a better view. He eyed her as if she was able to fall over.
Rollins glanced at her, ready to lash out again; but he never got the chance. With adrenal rushing though her, she lunged forward and took hold of the steering wheel, and using everything that she had, she jerked it toward her. Rollins tried to push her off, but Toni was on a mission. Not willing to give him the upper hand, she headed butted him—though that probably hurt her more than him, but it worked. It stung him enough for her to get the upper hand. Her jaw locking, she tightened her grip and yanked one more time with everything that she had. Her arms may be screaming as Rollin tried to get her off, which included a few good hits, but she wasn't giving up.
She was still wearing the white dress and sweater but she had added jeans and some kind of black shirt to her outfit. The jeans were an interesting touch as Barnes hadn't seen a woman wear jeans before, granted he hadn't seen many dames wear pants either. "So you decided to sleep here?" he asked as he took a seat next to her on the cold ground.
Hearing someone walk in, he turned to the door and gave a weak smile to Banner. "How's it going, Banner?" Steve asked, turning and resting his arm on the back of the couch.
Everything started to spin as she felt sick. Toni knew that Peggy didn't hate or blame her for what happen to Steve, but Toni still did, and to hear her say that, it was too much. "Peg, you don't have to," She said slowly.
me.”  Grimly, he added, “You can take this throne or you can leave it.  But you can’t make me go with you.”
The worst thing he could do was come up on Tony’s blind side, but he had no choice, with the hallway as narrow as it was.  “Over here, pal,” he added again, as Tony refused to turn his head, to look.  Sighing, Steve set the plate down, slid it on the floor until it just barely touched Tony’s left hand, and explained, “Sandwich.”
Steve opted not to rise to the jibe, instead giving him space.  He followed along from one exhibit to the next, as quiet as a schoolboy, until they reached the monkeys.  Then he brightened, looking around for a peanut dispensary.  Probably sold them in a fancy shop now, he mused, glancing around the monkey cage, surprised at the lack of peanut shells littering the floor.  “You guys clean up the shells nice,” he observed.
Steve could not answer that honestly.  The Vision went on, “Yet it feels . . . comforting.  Ancestral, perhaps.  I do not have a blood family.  It is difficult for me to . . . articulate, the idea of family.”
knew how long.  He should never have sent Steve away, even if he had nothing on hand to treat an arterial bleed.  He
“The world wants you back,” Rhodes admitted, three days before Christmas.  “It probably even needs you.”
“It’s all right,” Steve assured, allowing himself to be temporarily decommissioned.  They would not kill Ginger.  He would kill whoever even
Looking around the space—some kind of infirmary, yet with more tools than the average mechanic’s shop—Steve spotted a blanket in the corner.  “Be right back,” he said, shifting.
“But you could,” Sojef said.  Tony whirled sharply.  Even Anij looked aghast, staring at Sojef.  The other members of Starfleet could not have sat more at attention as Sojef disclosed, “The metaphasic radiation is found in the ice crystals.  All you would have to do is harvest it.”
.  “You’re crazy.  Out of your head.  He needs to be kept away.  Locked up,” Tony told Natasha, who stepped closer.  He tensed automatically, expecting her to do something terrible—stab him in the neck, stab him in the back—but she just brushed the hair off his forehead and gave him a kiss.  He blinked up at her, bewildered.  “Uh.”
At that, she flopped down, resting her chin on his thigh.  He ached with affection, resting a tentative hand on her back.
Then the Hulk grumbled loudly and Tony and Steve both looked up in time to see him stand and lumber over to Thor, who was attempting to shake more water out of the hose.  “You got a couple dollars?” Tony asked, exactly like he had ten minutes prior.
To his relief, the clerk—perhaps leaning more on the Captain America awe than the good Samaritan kindness alone—stated, “I can help you out, no problem.”
“Override code,” Natasha began, rattling off a series of numbers and letters that seemed convoluted, and irrelevant, as Iron Man breathed raspily against Steve’s chest.
look.  Steve vowed to write a nice letter to the desk, thanking them for their concern, but everything was fine, really, just—
“Need a lift?” Steve asked, as Bruce looked up at the wooden framework thoughtfully.  Bruce startled, then stammered something resembling,
Steve turned when he heard the car door pop open, surprised to see Tony looking briefly unsure, then his usual insouciant self.  “Thought you’d expired,” Steve told him.
“Look, we’re going to brutally murder a potentially peaceful alien in the name of bloodlust, how can you possibly condone this?”
While accruing vast swaths of wealth was somewhat frowned upon, Tony managed to get by on good will, proliferating his technology and solving problems across the galaxy.  He enjoyed few things more than spending time on the experimental vessels, messing around with the warp drive until he was on the brink of breakthrough or cataclysm.
Stovok’s expression returned to that delightfully unimpressed expression, even as he said, “Trust me,” and rested his fingertips against the side of Tony’s face.
.  It did not matter that the garage was capable of keeping even heavy artillery out; it would not keep two adult dragons
“Fair Lady,” Thor greeted, his voice the only force on Earth, Steve suspected, capable of dousing confrontational fires across interspecies.  “Care to adventure with us?”
?”  He sat next to Steve.  He looked at little green-tinted Thallium, who blinked back at him innocently.  “Very thin ice, dear heart.”
“We appreciate your efforts,” Sojef said, glancing away as Stovok stood patiently, embraced around the middle by a handful of children.  “We may not be able to return your Vulcan,” he jested.
Sitting on a bench, still holding Ginger, Steve admitted, “This might be the stupidest thing I’ve ever done.”
The fissure ahead was empty.  Seeing it made him dizzy, dreading the task ahead.  The others were out of sight.
Anger gave him unexpected strength, enough to rally, to crawl out of the crawl space and cross the distance.  He unlocked the door audibly.  And then, with a fury belying desperation, he gripped the handle itself, preventing it from being turned as the monster on the other side tried to open it.
“Aw, nuts,” Ice Cream Man said, as rainbow-colored sprinkles covered the floor.  “I was hoping that wouldn’t happen.  Let me get some more.”
.)  To call it a parasite—its metal claws anchored in his blood red bone, its cold metal flesh leeching the heat off his endothermic body—was to articulate the give-take of the matter.  He fed it, cleaned it, and protected it from external intrusions; in return, it protected him from the flock of shrapnel pieces lurking inside his own body.
Reeling from the impact, Steve pushed a hand against his right eye, more startled than hurt.  Clint took off like a shot.  Steve lost nearly three seconds confirming that he was not hurt before giving chase.  Clint was halfway across the pitch—Clint was fifteen feet from base and closing fast but—Steve caught him by the back of the shirt with six feet to spare.
He had just finished swiping the slate clean when he heard footsteps nearby.  Steve reacted accordingly: he scrambled up the nearest pine tree.
After three more repetitions, Tony rallied: he stood up and unplugged the vacuum.  Without waiting to see if Steve would try to twist
Standing nearby with Gerald’s and Sweetie’s leads in hand, Tony said, “. . . You jumped in the Niagara
“That’s why he’s my first favorite,” Tony admitted, tangling a hand in his Christmas sweater, right over the reactor.  “He came looking for me.”
,” Tony grunted, spinning back to the console.  “You’re not here.  You can’t make a report.”  He took the wheel and sped up for the hell of it, pushing the sub-warp capacities of the ship.  “And I’m not talkin’ to you.”
Two floors up, the elevator stopped to let a cart-bearing hotel worker on board.  She did not board.  After a long moment, Steve tapped the correct floor once more.  “It’s all right.  I got it,” Steve assured.  The woman blinked at them in bewilderment, standing by her cart.  “Have a good night,” Steve added.
“We’re their family,” Steve went on, ignoring the bait.  “We’re all they have.  Dragons don’t form groups.”
He breathed.  Thinly.  Desperately.  His heart beat so fast each breath was sub-par, bordering on anoxia.  He hated that he could be rendered mute by his own body, paralyzed with pain, but there was simply nothing he could say, no way to answer,
An unrelenting white fog descended over the peaks, spreading a fine ghostly mist over the trail.  Fearless, Secret trotted down the graveled footpath, clad in his own coat, which amused Steve endlessly.  “He’s Irish, but he can still catch a cold,” their guide explained.
She looked at him, black eyes so hard to read and still so full of a candlelight soul, watching him.
According to a placard near the water, more than five thousand intrepid and unsuspecting souls had taken the plunge over the river’s edge.  Of them, just sixteen had survived.
“You will not hurt a beautiful animal to satisfy your own curiosity,” Steve insisted in an undertone.
“Go—”  Struggling to back up at all with the string of Nibirans behind him, Tony said, “We need Bruce, we are
“She believed in higher things,” Stovok said at last.  “In . . . life.  Persevering.”  He looked back at the ceiling, lost in thought.
Tony made an ambivalent noise.  Then, rallying, he grabbed Steve by the arm and give him a propelling shove in the right direction.  “That’s just because you haven’t seen what I have planned,” he dismissed, planting both hands on the back of Steve’s shoulders and pushing him ahead.
Steve thought about it.  He was closer to the base and had the ball in hand.  But he knew without twitching a muscle that Thor would win.
Tony said, “Well, that was exhausting,” and maintained his vigil near third base.  Bruce stood in the outfield, as far from the action as the fencing would allow, still shaking slightly from his close encounter with Thor.
.  Almost shaking with pent-up energy, Tony said carefully, “We come in peace,” and multiple hands patted him on the shoulders.  “Huh.  You know that one—
Whistling like he had not heard the question, Tony flipped open the wallet and began thumbing a stack of bills.
.  Steve didn’t know.  He kept stroking for a while, feeling the weight of the half-man, half-monster in his lap.
And suppose he did, he thought, shivering with dread.  What actions they would take!  Drag him out, beat his body back to life, breaking as many ribs as they had to to restart his heart before shoving tubes into his chest and arms, pumping the life force back into him,
Instead of relaxing at the prospect, Steve bristled.  “Don’t you think that’s a little unnecessary?”
“I wish to see,” Thor pronounced.  Steve put a restraining hand on his shoulder.  As a testament to their friendship, and not Steve’s strength alone, Thor waited.
while Clint attempted to pry the newspaper out of his hands.  Steve kept one hand on the wheel and the other across the two seats, keeping Clint from entering the arena.  “You know, Bruce is setting a fine example,” Steve acknowledged.  Bruce huddled deeper in his corner.  “Be like Bruce,” Steve insisted, pushing Clint back.
“He’s scared, Steve.”  Steve cut her a sharp look.  Natasha just looked out at the city, the lines of her face familiar, her blonde hair divorcing her from the work partner he knew.  “Aren’t we all?” she added, absolving Tony of guilt.
A knock came on the door.  It was soft enough Tony almost dreamed it, but he could not ignore it.  With a grumbling sigh, he stood up and stepped very carefully around Stovok, whose breathing did not change.
“Gentle-ladies?” Steve repeated, lowering the shield out of sheer confusion.  Tony squeezed his arm conciliatorily, then slipped out of reach.
They fed and watered the strangers in their midst, which was more than Steve had come to expect from the future.  Sure, the city had always been a hard place to make friends, but it still surprised him that people could be decent to each other, without provocation or incentive.  Perhaps he had simply come to expect the opposite: the dog-eat-dog world of growing up in New York City, ravaged by Prohibition, by the Depression, by the second Great War.
,” Tony said, shocking him fast enough Steve did not see the pen, only the prickling sensation in his hand as he shook it off.  Tony pushed on.
Looking sunburnt and sore, “Brucey” stared at him, then shook his head, grumbled a Vulcan curse, and nearly fell off the lip of the crater cresting it.  Tony grabbed him by his soaked tunic to arrest him, but Bruce hardly uttered a word of gratitude.  The Nibirans shuffled with almost improbable efficiency to make room for the newcomer, and Tony patted Bruce vehemently on the back.  “Knew you had it in you,” he said.
when he was that close—no, Bruce, with scarcely a smile in Tony's direction, unfolded his sleeping bag on the floor, lied down, and joined his family in rest.  Tony didn’t know where Thor was, but it seemed all right that he was away, that someone was on watch.
For some strange reason, accepting orders to “subdue members of a violent alien race, preferably without remorse” made more sense to Steve Rogers than futuristic airports.
“Vættr*,” Thor corrected.  “It has . . . a complex translation.  I should need many hours to convey it,” he added apologetically.  “It is . . . like ‘soul.’”
Coleman nodded to himself, then leaned down to stroke the other bloodhound’s back once.  “My father, when he was a boy, he met you, in Bristol.  Passing through.  You shook his hand and told him he’d live t’ see the end of the war.  Always used to say, he’d meet you again, someday, and prove it.”  Coleman thrust out a hand.  Steve straightened, clasped it.  “Thank you.  He would’ve liked to see you again.”
The music resumed.  Tony growled, reaching into a pocket, pulling out a small metal device.  He jimmied it into the lock, then forced the door open.  “How
his response, his cooperation—but it was the cold, hard truth, beating under his mutilated breastbone.
Once upon a time, in a dark damp cesspool of a cave in Afghanistan, three untrained men and one doctor under great duress performed a shotgun surgery which would transform a talented, tenacious, healthy thirty-seven-year-old into a walking lesson in human hubris, the consequences of whose actions would ripple from time zero all the way to the present moment, where the subject can be found arguing with the Secretary of World Security Council: "
Tony grunted a negative.  “OK,” Steve said, relieved to hear him, no matter how curt.  Rico grumbled to himself in a catlike manner.  Steve laid a reassuring hand on the cat’s back (
“Live alone, die alone,” Tony thought, skin crawling at the memory of the Nightmare in the skies, taking him out without remorse.  “Tough life.”
Steve closed the distance between them.  “Tony, I’m sorry,” he said.  Tony kept walking, but Steve insisted, “We weren’t there for you and you got hurt.”
“They sent out the fake transmission,” Admiral Fury said.  “We only found out after intercepting a Romulan contact complaining about potential interference.  It took . . . a few days, to decode.  You can thank Lieutenant Romanova for the assistance.”
“Not even slightly,” Iron Man confirmed, as Lucky leaped into the air after him.  “Down.  Down, boy.”
, Tony thought, turning around, gazing outward, fixating on the scene, the swarm of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, scouring his
“You come here or you get lost,” Steve ground out, tired, sore, probable nearly as miserable of dealing with him as he was of dealing with Steve.
There was an almost German tint to their language, a familiarity that evoked a world almost seventy years old.  It threatened to pull Steve out of the moment, to transpose Howard Stark in his son’s place, but even the way Tony stood was differently, less patient but somehow more congenial.  Howard always seemed like a man who could stand for hours if the need arose, but Tony
They were halfway to the car when Steve picked up on the distressed quality of Tony’s breathing.  “You okay?” he asked, not raising any alarms yet.
Wheezing for breath, Iron Man stared at him, mask so close but utterly unreadable, near enough that he could brain Steve on the table and that would be it, that would be
Clint looked between the bait and his own hand a few times.  At last, Tony sighed, reaching forward to reclaim the bait.
To his surprise, Tony pressed against him, in the briefest and most indecisive of hugs, more inconsequential lean than true embrace.  “Keep it together,” Tony recommended, but Steve could not express how grand the idea was, that the future had gotten
Some spent their lives trying to orchestrate a match.  Others took the opposite approach, burned or bitter or simply better motivated—they became dragon-killers, ridding terrorized landscapes of the ultimate predator and selling their hides for rich margins on the black market.
“I am surprised they are not attacking us,” Stovok observed, still standing near the pilot’s chair but watching closely as a Gorn appeared in the open bay doors, looked around the interior, and then stomped back over to Thor, joining the others.
“Tony,” Steve scolded, returning to his seat as Tony used a knife to carve off a small piece of cake from his slice.  “Be nice.”
Thor hummed, an ominous sound, like he was considering calling lightning down to strike them all down.  Steve would not have put it past him, although it would’a made one hell of an obituary:
He heard the very distinct chatter of Happy and Tony conversing, but none of their words made sense to him.  It was like they were speaking in Greek.  He huffed in a breath.  What was he doing?  What was he doing, hurting these people?
.  Within those nightmarish black eyes, Tony saw a soul like his own, looking back at him, a window into his own ambition.
.  It would negate the good intentions, prove that the whole show of it—winning him over, keeping him safe, expressing kindness and sympathy—was little more than an endeavor to keep not him but his heroic heart alive.  As long as it could produce new red blood cells from which the serum could be harvested—
If she didn't regret the whole thing, she would've been bragging about how she invented Time Travel. "Look at this face," She said, reaching up to cup/grab Steve's face. Before he knew what she was doing, she pushed the corner of his lips up into a forced smile.
The CEO gave him a nasty look before she turned to Toni. Her fists were balled at her side, and she was shaking. "Toni," she sneered out.
She waved him off, but she knew he wouldn't be happy without an explanation. "I'm fine. I…just thought I saw someone I knew so I bolted out of the dinner, but I was wrong. I guess my memory is still fuzzy," she lied.
your boyfriend or his. I'm your landlord. Nothing else, so just leave me the hell alone." He pauses for a second as anger builds inside of him. He knows he shouldn't blame Barnes or Rogers for this as they have done nothing wrong (Besides making him lo- Nope not love-for making him like them), but it hurts. It hurts to see them so happy. "Go bug your boyfriend. You two are so goddamn annoying. Makes me sick."
However, as he listed to Toni and Bruce go on, he found himself worrying less about the hole he was digging. Though it was true that he didn't trust Fury, he disliked how her total disrespect for those around her and was annoyed that Banner was going along with this. Maybe, it was just him, but why she couldn't just followed orders?
They were dropped off two mile from the hydra base as any closer, they would have been spotted. Normally, they would have dropped straight on the base, but they had to be sneaky about this one. They needed to get to the computers before they were destroyed. If Hydra were to spot them, they wouldn't get the chance, and they couldn't have that.
"I know." He really wished she had called him, but he knew why she didn't: her insecurities. She was always worried she was more of a burden than anything else. He placed a soft kissed to the top of her head, as he softly rocked her gently in his arms. Her shaking had finally calmed and she was all but stilled in his arms while he held her. However, Steve didn't liked this side of Toni, as a silent genius was never a good sign. "Talk to me," he said, swaying back and forth.
relationship. He was the first guy who had ever made her feel like she was worth something besides a roll in the sack. She had 'relationships' or what some call one-night stands. She had whatever she had with Ezekiel and Tiberius—that one Howard hated with everything he had. Man, if eyes could kill. Her father was oddly overprotected over her, but he really didn't like Tiberius. Maybe, seeing his future time traveling daughter did that to a man? Looking back, he had a point. Anyhow, she could contest that she never had a real relationship, and maybe, she couldn't say those the words because she didn't know if
"Yes," he said without giving any explanation. "And I'm sorry about the asshole earlier. I'll talk to him about it."
I was trying a think of a nickname for Barnes for Toni to give him, but I can't really think of one. The nicknames for Phillips, Peggy, Rogers, or Schmidt aren't all that special, but I can't think of one for him. Any of ideas?
Natasha nodded as she pushed off the wall. She didn't say much at first, only staring at the stilled genius in Steve's arms. Toni was gone to the world at the moment, but it was transparent that her sleep was anything but peaceful. She was covered in sweat and was shivering. "She'll be wearing a mask in the morning. Are you ready for that fight?" she asked.
Toni was totally exhausted from the rounds in the bed and shower, but she could admit that she was completely and thoroughly pleased. Now, she wanted to take a nap, but her stomach was growling at her, demanding food. Hearing her stomach—laughing at her-, Steve was at the stove, as he tried to save his burnt—now cold—pancakes, but there was no saving them. They didn't even seem appealing anymore. Her vote was to toss them in the trash, but Steve shook his head at that, stating that someone in some foreign country would die for them. With narrowing eyes, Toni pandered how old this man really was, but she was going to let him have this for now.
Steve stepped a, placing a kiss to the top of his head. "You know you're breathtaking at any time, right? I can't help but smile when I look at you."
"I know," he replied. He wanted to get her back into bed, but hearing her, it might not be the best idea. "Why don't you call off today and we do something. Just the two of us. Get a Christmas Tree or something."
"So I guess, they're just getting bacon," she said to herself as she plated the meat. Shaking her head, she turned to the sink and turned the water on.
Toni jumped to her feet and stepped toward the hooligan. "Do you know who I am?" she demanded, her voice cold. She wasn't sure if it was because of the ass in front of her or her throbbing shoulder. The sudden movement flexed her muscles uncomfortably. For a second, she wished she hadn't asked Romanoff to train her, but if it wasn't for the kick ass moves that the assassin had shown her, Toni would've regretted the training with the Black Widow.
Taking a deep breath, she took a step down the stairs leading into Howard Stark's lab. She planned to check on her device, once she figured out how to get one of those cores away from her father. He probably wouldn't let her near the cores, but she would convince him.
At this point, Toni didn't care if she spilled the beans; she just wanted her to shut up. "The future."
I Hope you enjoyed this chapter. This chapter was hard for me, because I wanted to show how Toni's nightmares had been getting to her, but at the same time, I didn't want her to be weak. I am not sure if I passed that in this time.
"The Colonel doesn't want you to be alone. And Carter and Rogers are worried about you…for good reason," Howard stated, kneeing in front of her. "You did
"I don't know about that, Gabe," Dugan stated, leaning on his cane. "And I think Toni and I can agree on that. You were chasing the women away."
Steve kept telling it was all in his head as there was no reason why Loki would be eyeing Toni. Seriously, why was he staring at her like that? Did Toni have what Loki wanted? If so, what was it? Was it technology? That couldn't be it with that intent stare. It looked like he wanted
The Hologram of Killian's brain disappeared as he stepped off the glass table. "Toni. Toni. You know you can't think like that," he said as he waved a finger at her. "You have a wonderful brain that is capable of anything, so why don't you put it to use." There was a smile on his face as he stepped to her, crowding into her personal space. "Oh, I love that brain of yours; you need to think more with it and less with that ego of yours."
"Stupid," Tony utters as he gets to his numbed feet. He has been in the lab for so long that he forgets the last time he has been upstairs. He does know that he needs bath, if he's to judge from the smell coming off him. "I need to get out," he says, stepping away from his work. He needs to get his mind off Rogers, Barnes and his food, and get out. He needs a night out with some woman. A man would be a painful reminder of what he can never have.
"Rogers, stop," she yelled. Her hands were shaking, as her head fall. "What do you think's going on here?"
She didn't get to sob and moan for long as Aldrich suddenly popped out of the intense fire like a phoenix. Besides for his burning, smoking clothes, he looked prefect—his skin smoothed-, as he walked toward her with a hungry look in his eyes. It was like he had walked off a photo shoot with that stupid fake blond hair. It danced in the air from the breeze. The only thing that broke that illusion was his clothes, which were falling off him. Though almost naked, it didn't stop or distract the man… Maybe it was because there wasn't a fucken scratch on him. Maybe, he was proud of his body. It was prefect. There was a remark on the tip of tongue for what she thought of him, but the look in his eye stopped her.
Her mind drifted to what she would do if she was stuck in the past. She couldn't work in that hardware store forever or she would go crazy, but what else could she do? She could try to get a job at Stark Industries and outsmart her father at every turn just to piss him off, but that wouldn't be a good idea. Plus, she couldn't really stand him and she didn't want to see him every day. If she did, the cops would probably be called daily.
He took a deep breath. "There was this guy who was mouthing off. I told him to shut it and he didn't like that."
"I didn't ask if you can fly it. I asked if you intend to go out," Steve restated, annoyed. His lack of sleep was getting to him and he was allowing his anger to grow.
He didn't have a name, and if he did, he didn't know it, but his name wasn't important. He wasn't important. No one cared if he was injured or killed, unless it affected the mission. He was a nobody to the world and only important if he finished his missions, his assignments. If he failed, he was punished and punished severely. If he spoke without permission, he was punished. If he didn't obey, he was punished. If he wasn't quick enough, he was punished. He was just a tool, an asset to his handlers, and he accepted this.
The very idea of working with her father annoyed the hell out of her. How could she work with someone like him? He couldn't see pass his big ego, but then again, there were
"Toni," he called again, and this time, he grabbed a hold of her shoulders and shook. "You aren't there. You're here with me in the lab. You're safe," He said it slowly.
"Easy. Steve and I are friends," Toni responded as she put her hands up in defense. Her mind flashed to a few of the future Rogers and her conversions; there were times that she thought he was going to snap on her. To get him that angry wasn't easy, but yet, it was normal for her. "Trust me, Steve and I are not compatible at all. We would so kill each other." She let out a chuckle. "His head would explode. He would not be able to handle all of this." She popped out her chest and motioned to her body.
"I need some air," she said, closing the box and slipping it into her pocket. She all but ran away from Phillips who let her leave without saying a word.
He glanced down at the stilled Genius in his arms for a long second before he looked up again. "Collect whatever you can find and take it back to the tower," Steve ordered, transforming into Captain America. His tone changed.
she told herself. It wouldn't do any good to snap on Peggy as that was what the Sassy Agent wanted, and she wouldn't give that to her. "Besides insulting me, is there a reason why you interrupted my training?"
"What do you want?" She asked as she stared at him, daring him to say something. She was ready to pounce on whatever he said. "…I need to get back to the device," she replied with a sigh.
Calming down, Clint moved to the side. "Good, because you two are too sweet to be like that," he said, letting out a puking sound. "Like too sweet. I might get tooth ache."
Phillips, who was sitting across from her, eyed her; he was trying to read her. "I still have my doubts, but-"
The End for now! I hope the wait wasn't too bad... The next chapter may or may not take awhile. Depends on whether I am dead from all of the Civil War clips. that movie is so going to kill us.
Howard watched for a second before answering. "That's the rarest metal on earth. What you're holding there is all we've got."
she told herself. She hated that he was right yet again. "I doubt I'm the only one who doesn't like you."
Toni turned, giving Steve a look, before she glanced back toward the box. The evil box was an advantage size, and it was filled to the top. There were different shades of green and red popping out. "With that junk?"
Barnes narrowed his eyes and the shape started to morph into his best friend. What was he doing here? "Steve."
Bruce let out a sigh as he glanced between Toni and Steve. He gave her a look, and when she didn't respond, he turned to the door. "Alright, I'll be down the hall if you need me," he said as left, leaving the two of them alone.
. I'll kill you myself. Burn you alive, if you catch my drift." She was pointing toward Toni's wrist, making it hard to look anywhere else. "Do understand?!"
Iron Man did not respond, inhaling shortly before exhaling metallically, a strangely human sound inside the mask.  There really was a person in there, Steve thought, struggling to imagine how anyone could
.”  He nearly killed himself on the Roomba, jetting across the room.  He made the tackle from the back of the couch, grabbing Steve’s good arm and insisting, “Bad touch.
She truly thought about it for a moment, because she was truly sick of his time, and Barnes' death was weighting on her. It made her wonder if there was anything else worse in life than that. What could she give him that was worse than that? She had no idea, but there was a part of her mind that was screaming at her, telling her that she would be an idiot to take his deal. And she was going to listen to that part of her.
Toni could see the shock in his eyes. "No, no," she denied, unsure of what to really say. "Did I say Stark?" she asked. "I meant Sark." She tried to laugh it off.
Steve eyed her red left ankle for a moment before he looked up at her. Not to his surprise, she was still watching him, but she hadn't said a word. Still on his knees, he straightened himself up and reached for her hoodie, which was still dripping wet. His hands went to her side, prompting her to lift up her arms, and not a second later, she lifted up her arms to allow him put the hoodie up and over her head.
Next on this supposed team was the god—well, the not-really-god who was more alien than a deity. Toni didn't know what she thought of Thor, the man she barely had two lone conversions with. They rarely talked besides what was necessary, though she wasn't sure who fault that was: his or hers. Maybe, her meaningless flirting was too much for him? Maybe, it was her ego? Toni wasn't sure, but she wasn't going to push it. He was off somewhere, doing something, and Toni had no idea of where or what, not that she really cared to find out. If Thor wanted her or anyone else to know, he would tell her, and she wasn't going to bug him for it.
"And SHIELD will let you? Don't they own your hot ass?" she asked, as she grinned. "Fury goes 'Rogers jump,' and you go 'how high.'" She enjoyed teasing him. "And then there's the Mandarin. I would think SHIELD would want you on that."
Toni thought back to the many nights in the apartment, back to the time when Steve was a shrimp. She was an idiot, talking to him about things. Opening up to him. Breaking her damn rules, and now look where she was, she was attached. "Yea, but during those times, we weren't at war, Rogers," she stated.
Toni looked up, giving Sharon a 'are you stupid' glare. "Yes." There was no doubt she cared for this man.
had happened. "What's wrong? Is there something wrong with Toni?!" he asked, his concern leaking through.
"Enough," she stated. "I can take care of myself. In case you didn't hear, I punched him in the face for touching me already." She took a deep breath. "Besides, I have no honor to protect. That ship sailed a while ago. Many men ago." She wasn't sure if that was something people admitted in this time, but judging from his face, it wasn't. Maybe, she shouldn't have told him and she was regretting it as she eyed his bright red face.
Steve smiled at her as he reached down to all of the wet clothes, gathering them. He could see her eyeing his every movement, and he could feel her fear as he stepped to the bathroom. He could tell she didn't want him to leave, which he didn't planned in doing. He wanted to stay, which was what he was going to do. His chest may be beating rapidly in his head, but he wasn't going anywhere.
"Miss Stark, the others had inquired about your location," JARVIS replied with instead. "I think it would be wise to go back to the Tower."
"So why hasn't Hydra killed her yet?" Rumlow asked, giving him a look. "And what about the Captain? Is it the same?"
"It's called a uniform," the women responded as if Toni was an idiot. She poked her with the needle.
Toni turned to him, suddenly remembering Madame Hydra. "There's this female Commander. She knows something!" She knew it might be foolish to tell him as that woman did know things, but she had to find her. "We must find her."
With her eye twitching, there were a few things that went flying through Toni's head, and each were nasty comments that she struggled to keep down. These comments were the type of comments that would start WW3, and she didn't need that. In fact, she could see Steve at the back of her mind, giving her the Cap's look. "I see I wasn't the only one you took from," she snapped, barely keep the insults in her head. "And here you are, nth years later in a dungeon. I'm surprised I haven't see any whips."
"I'll be up later. Now, can you leave me alone?" he asks, as he pushes the plate away from him. He knows how broken his voice sounds, but he hopes that Steve doesn't call him on it. He hopes that he just leaves. He wants to be alone. Steve gives him a look before he pushes himself up onto his feet and turns to leave. There's a hesitation in his step as he moves to the door, but he does not stop as he leaves. His shoulders are small.
Steve reached his hands out to catch Dugan if he were to fall. It struck him how old Dugan was as he looked like he was going to fall over at any second. He didn't know how he could handle the fact that all of his friends and allies were either dead or close to death like Dugan. He couldn't watch them die. "Yes."
Banner glanced at Steve before looking back to Toni. "He got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier," he said.
"Let me go!" she hollered as she found herself in the arms of the good Captain. "Let me go right now, Rogers." She was kicking, refusing to remain still. "I don't need you! I don't want you!"
"I have ways to kill you without anyone knowing. I just don't want to waste them." Toni waved the wrench at him.
He needs to get out of here. Maybe, he can go and see Pepper in Malibu. Maybe, he can get those two out of his mind once he has someone else in his mind.
"No, worse," he stated. Toni opened her mouth as if to protest, but he cut her off. "Let's go. We have things to. We're heading out."
"Good," Dugan stated. "Why are you here, Steve?" He was eyeing Steve, belief still in his eyes. "I'm know it isn't to catch up, though I would like that. You can pretend to be my grandson and help me with these ladies."
"You-" she started, thinking about everything she had done. With Barnes' death, she had even more blood on her already stained hands. There was more death on her hands than anyone else's and that included the soldier holding her. She had done some things; she had been selfish.
"Stark, what did you expect?" she asked, still feeling weird at addressing someone else with her last name even if it was his last name first.
Rhodes takes a deep breath as he puts a firm hand on both of Tony's shoulders. "You can't hide in here forever, Tones," he says, softly. "I don't know what happened between the three of you, but you can't live in your misery. So get your ass out of that chair, and get upstairs or else." Tony opens his mouth to respond, but before he can, Rhodey adds, "And yes, I will cuddle with you."
She didn't answer right away, only cuddling closer to Steve if that was possible. Even with his super strength, it was a struggle not to fall into bed with her, not that he didn't want to do. "I told JARVIS to take me home."
He put on the biggest smile that Toni had even seen. "It is, and my daughter invented it. Is there nothing a Stark can do?" he said, joyfully. There was in an excitement in his voice that tired her just by listening to it. "Do you know how incredible that is, Toni?"
She jumped at Howard's voice as she forgot for a second that he was there. "Why would I go after him?" she asked.
Pressing her hand against the reactor, she took a deep breath. She couldn't stare at her naked self forever, but she didn't have any interesting in facing the world. Why couldn't she stay in the locker room? Shaking her head, she knew she couldn't and it would be stupid to think about it. Trying to force herself to a happier place, she turned to the uniforms that Salty had given her. With the towel wrapped around her tightly, she unfolded the uniform and laid them in front of her. She groaned at the hideous standard undergarments that the military provided. How could anyone feel any kind of sexy in this uniform? Toni sighed because she was being foolish as sex had no part in war.
"I had been doing that for years." She shook her head, as she took a deep breath. Closing her eyes, she pictured her father, who was always yelling at her for doing something wrong.
Toni, still unable to open her eyes, started to drift, even though she was interested in seeing who he was speaking to. It was a losing battle, as she felt the world disappear around her for seconds at a time.
"You were like this before he died," he said pushing her patience. Why couldn't he just let this go? Why couldn't he understand she didn't want to talk?
"He is not winning. I am simply buying my time," he said, crossing back to Toni and grabbing her face. He held her face tight, bruising her cheeks, as he forced her to look at him. "He can attempt to destroy this base, but he will only meet his end. Maybe, once I kill him in front of you, you will submit to me."
Stovok simply lied down on the floor next to his bed, looking up at the ceiling with him, scanning the blue map.  “Stovok?” Tony prompted, after a sufficient period of silence had passed, whereby Stovok could absorb every iota of data on screen.
Steve, sketching on the couch, looked up at him.  Blue-tinted Actinium slept beside him, chin resting on Steve’s leg.  “He stole my spot,” Tony complained, indicating the hatchling.
“As if I’m capable,” Tony dismissed, looking out the windshield as the Hulk made an impatient roaring sound, sitting on the tarmac and gesturing at himself with two big hands.  Thor turned the hose on him obligingly, and Hulk made a more agreeable rumble.  Tony asked pointedly, “We’re not telling Fury about this, right?”
“I just like it here,” Steve said neutrally, walking along at a polite pace, footsteps crunching over gravel, rock, like he had nothing better to do than keep up with Tony’s inevitably glacial stumble-walk.  It infuriated Tony, in some heckling way.
“A lollipop?” Thor repeated uncomprehendingly.  “I do not under—”  He paused to watch Clint pedal across the tarmac, yelping loudly:
Then Sojef laughed, a braying, huge, unexpected thing.  The others soon joined in, but Thor overpowered them, too, laughing buoyantly.  “Another!” he cheered, and the others joined in.
“Well, I reckon we can get at least sixty pounds offa this one,” Clint announced, patting another alpaca on the side.  The alpaca whinnied, a
Even Tony could not expect to hold up to centuries of damnation, as evidenced by his unceremonious removal of the enfeebled former King known as Kevin, now a pile of skeleton bones artfully arranged near the foot of his throne.  A helpful reminder to rebel-scum what would happen to them if they challenged their new
I'm hoping to keep installments short and digestible so I can dedicate more time to my first loves. Knowing me, that means chapter 3 should be around 10,000 words.
.  Tony had the irrational urge to wrap his arms around him, protect the peacekeeper inside that grim gray uniform who had signed up for Starfleet to do
Steve had tried, in the early days, to allay Tony’s suffering, to comfort him during his most tormented moments.  But the bitter truth was, Steve was merely a participant in Tony’s life, capable only of bearing witness, not acting with divine mercy.  He could not accelerate the healing process, and Tony did not want him to bear witness.
Reaching out with metal glove, mirroring Marker’s pose, Tony almost let his metal fingers touch the very edge of Marker’s wingtip.
“Loud and clear,” was all Hill said, her voice still so perfectly dry, like she was not afraid of him, at all.  That only put his hackles up—how could she not be afraid, she had seen the footage, not just of New York but surely of his escape, she was Fury’s righthand, she knew what he could do, he could rip people
.  Tony was perfectly justified chucking an egg at the back of his head when his back was turned, rooting around for a mixer.
Tony held up a thumbs-up.  Clint grinned, saluted sloppily, and stepped back around in front of the car, holding up both arms and shouting, “Hey, big guy!  Big guy!”  Thor swung around, hose in hand, and doused him.
“And where are you from?” Sojef asked.  “What have you encountered in your journey among the stars?”
As Clint pulled out his new trinkets and knickknacks and gadgets and gizmos, Steve found himself wondering what Thor and Tony were up to, planning their very own expedition.
In a good mood, he opened the box—and discovered a blueberry muffin.  He broke off a piece and offered it to Bruce, who stared at him for a moment like he had just invented fire, then took the piece of muffin with a shy nod and ate it.
Third and last, Juneau was truly remote: there was no way in or out but by air or sea.  Just mountains framing every edge, like something out of a storybook.
Stovok inclined his Vulcanic head—pointed ears, flat expression, but unusually soft brows, like his supposedly half-human parentage—and allowed, “I can neither confirm nor deny.”
“Yes, it is,” Tony said.  He still sounded distracted, but his hand smoothed Steve’s hair down rhythmically.
With a very soft grunt, Steve released his own arm.  Tony went to work quickly rebinding it.  “Pain in my ass, you know that?” he muttered, tightening it up.  Steve immediately tried to undo it, and Tony caught his hand.  “
Steve led the way.  Like most nights, they were curled up around Snow in a pile.  Barium and Ferrum were off to one side, black and silver, but the others were all in a pile.  Tony swayed with emotion.
“You’re welcome,” Steve replied.  “You should be grateful I waited to return the Stones, or we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”
Gravemarker stood up, shaking off his coat harshly.  He seemed a stranger, so removed that Tony wondered if it was not a feral dragon, slipping into his life and pretending to be the dragon he knew.  Tony had seen the feral dragons, the way they handled themselves, the way they attacked their own kin—Gravemarker was not like them.  Gravemarker put up with him, all of him, the exasperating and mean and forgetful, the kind and doting and optimistic.
“I am adept at the healing arts,” Thor professed, Clint clinging to him with all four limbs.  “Why do you inquire?”
Clint raced after him at a dead sprint, ball held in outstretched arm.  Then Thor decided to strike, lunging for Clint and sending him on a panicked abort-the-mission trajectory.
“I’ve heard worse lies,” Natasha said.  He looked at her, her green eyes searching his own.  Then she offered him the keys.  “If you aren’t back in an hour, they’ll assume the worst,” she said.
Finally, at 2340 hours—less than thirty minutes until zero-hundred—Steve sat before a crackling fire and asked lazily, “What’s with the pack of cigarettes, huh?”
Killian's smile was as large as his face. "No, I'm a visionary. But…I do own a maniac, and he takes the stage tonight." He counters. "And I like loyalty in my employees."
"Oh, they don't know?" Fury replied as if he had something smelly under his breath. He could out stink eye anyone.
Director Fury was pissed. He was always pissed, but at this point, he was royally pissed, and everyone knew it. Anyone who had any common sense stayed as far away from him as possible, and that was hard since they were in a base flying in the air. One of his SHIELD bases had been broken into and they had no idea who or how. The security system had to have been hacked, because there was no record of any unauthorized entry, and there had been one. None of his techs had been able to figure out how, and that really pissed him off. No one stole from him and got away with it.
Steve didn't know what to say to that. How could that be true? Was it something to do with the Serum? He didn't know, but it all too much for him to take. He closed his eyes as he tried to block out the world around him. It had to be true, right? That was only one thing that could explain what was going on around him.
get along, though that didn't mean she didn't like to get her hands dirty. She was just nothing without her tech, which Clint was going to work on with in the future. Sure, Natasha was training hand to hand combat, but Clint was going step in, as this was
Taking a deep breath, Salty crossed back to the table. "Do you know what this is?" he asked as he pointed to an area on the map.
What did she have to lose? Nothing, really. If she did nothing, she would be screwed. Besides, it wasn't like she had to fight this man, not that she didn't want to hit him a few times in the face. She just needed to get her phone, and once she put some distance between them, she would call the Iron Man suit. After that, she would be goldening. But how did she do that? Okay, she had an idea, but could she do it? She could possibly kill them both or at least break something in the process.
This was why when JARVIS alerted Pepper to Toni's sudden appearance in the Tower, Pepper dropped everything and rushed out the door. She barely had time to tell her secretary to cancel her all of meetings before bolting out of Stark Industries. As most of the world thought Toni was sunbathing on a beach, no one was knew that Toni was missing. No one knew why Pepper was excited to see Toni. No one knew her worries. No one had known why Pepper was acting like this.
Toni closed her eyes as she took a few steps away from them. "Barnes," she uttered as she hid her face in her hands. She didn't want to them to see her like this.
Steve took a deep breath. "I know." Even if he was be able to work up the nerve to speak with a beautiful dame, he didn't know what to say or how to act. He was also wasn't the type of man that attracted woman. "But you make it sound like she's using me." He knew it was possible but he didn't want to think about it.
Barnes stepped between them. "You know you two are ridicules," he stated. "You didn't need to fight with each other."
After making sure they were alone, he spoke, "Stark, relax." He paused. "I take your relationship with your father was shitty?"
She closed her eyes and melted into him, refusing to go. She focused on his heart beat, counting each beat that she could hear. He was the only thing in her world at the moment. The only thing. She had no idea what she would do without him.
Laying on her side, Toni tied to push herself up, but her arms could not support her. Pain shoot through her left arm, making her wonder if it was broken. "Ja.." she tried to call out. Her voice died in throat.
"What…plan...to…do?" This time it was a different voice who was speaking, and like the last one, Toni didn't recognized this voice. However, she wasn't sure if this was just a trick that her mind was playing on her.
That stuck Toni as odd. She didn't expect that from Peggy, but she didn't say anything. She just followed her back to their tent. It wasn't until they arrived that Toni spoke, "So was there a reason why you walked me back?" Not waiting for a response, she crossed to her messy cot and sat down.
She didn't know what to make of his tone, but he was correct. She sounded like a frog. "You aren't a shrimp a-anymore," she muttered, making out his large form. He was Captain America again-which meant he was an asshole again.
The glowing man didn't reply immediately, as he kept walking to her. He waited a few seconds as he smiled down at the genius. "Oh, Toni. It seemed like everyone wants you, not just my boss."
And geez, everyone thought Toni was beyong cruel in the last chapter. I must say there was part of me that didn't think she was cruel enough, and was tempted to make her more cruel to him.  I guess it is good that I did not.
Without a care to his own life, he flies into the crumbing building, reading life signs in the building. He has made a deal with himself that no one else will die on his watch, even if he dies in the process. They're civilians, and they do not deserve any of this it. They don't deserve to die, and he'll make sure they don't get hurt no matter what, which is probably why Tony doesn't recall much after entering the deteriorating, collapsing building. Only a second pass before everything goes black.
She suppressed the groan in throat as she eyed the IV. She couldn't believe she had let herself to degrade to this point, but she also hated that she had fainted in front of Howard. What must he think of her? "I need to get out of here," she replied, turning to her father. She couldn't believe how weak she'd been – despite years of going by with little sleep since her parent's deaths, she had never passed out, so why had her body chosen to do so now, in front of Howard?
