Dean came in a rush, semen shooting out of the tip of his cock like gunfire while Cas pounded into him. The continuous stimulation, both inside him and out, made his orgasm last a few nice long seconds. All Dean could really do while it happened was seize up and repeat Cas's name like a mantra over and over in hushed whimpers.
Castiel gulped at Dean's playful threat, admiring his suggestive green eyes and wet smirk. The angel eagerly looked forward to doing naughty things with his husband when they arrived at home. With a hopeful nod, Castiel slid back into his trench coat in preparation for the long journey ahead.
“I sort of… died,” Jude admitted, making Gabe’s heart flip in his chest, “We were together in the Empty, and he helped me get back.”
Michael bowed his head and smiled back before wrapping both arms around Adam and flying away. Both of them disappeared with a rustle of wings and a slight draft, leaving everyone else standing in the same room that another miracle was performed in. Again, no one seemed to know what to say. Until Lucifer swaggered forward that is.
Though Dean was speaking straight from the heart, Cas’s expression remained skeptical and saddened. But Dean had to make him believe it. It was the most honest thing in the world.
Dickie immediately barked and wagged his tail, eagerly agreeing with Gabriel's suggestion. He obviously needed a break from the kids and their constant need to put him in embarrassing situations. Gabe chuckled and patted his dog's back.
Jude sighed and nodded his head, looking more like Dean than Castiel could have imagined. The angel reached down to run his fingers through his child's hair a few times – just to give him a little more comfort – before slowly getting up. Castiel was only able to take two steps before Jude called for him again.
“Fine,” Gabe eventually huffed, “I didn't come here to fight with you... I just wanted to tell you that... Raphael is dead.”
“F – Forgive me,” the king whispered, his voice breaking. “That was inappropriate… I just… I had to know what it felt like…”
A smile flashed on Dean's face. It seemed like Jude was just as anxious to have Cas back as Dean was. Once the toddler's hair was clean, Dean carefully climbed to his feet and stepped over to grab a towel from the counter.
“I was supposed to call the cake place in Lebanon and get Charlie’s cake scheduled for pick up tomorrow, but I totally forgot,” Ollie answered, hanging his head in his hands, “Ugh, I’m a terrible father. Who forgets their kid’s first birthday like that?”
Jessica's high voice pulled Clarence out of his deep thoughts. He looked over to see Jess handing Jude the bowl of healing mixture and gauze she had been using.
“'Cause that's our home, Daddy,” she insisted, pressing her tiny index finger against the window, “That's where we're gonna live.”
Dean wasn't exactly sure why Gabriel wanted to visit his brothers in Hell. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that he was forced to spend some time in a cage of his own. Maybe he felt sorry for them or something. All Dean knew for certain was that Gabriel was set on going, and that Sam was determined to go with him. Usually, Dean would have been dead against letting his little brother going to Hell and getting close to Lucifer without him there to protect him. But with Jude back home and in need of comfort, Dean didn't have much of a choice but to let them go alone. Sammy was a big boy; perfectly capable of handling himself. And he knew Gabe would guard Sam with his life. Still, Dean felt uneasy about it.
in his stare; a type of 'deer in headlights' look that almost gave Jude a chill. Not only did Clarence know this stranger, but it seemed like he was downright horrified to see him...
,” Sam pointed out, feeling terrified, “How the hell are we going to explain it to our little girl without traumatizing her? What if we mess up, Gabe? What if we tell her the wrong way and she ends up having nightmares about penises? Oh God, I can't handle penis nightmares!”
. So scared that you won't need me or want me anymore. That you'll take your heart away from me and give it to someone else. But I
Jude didn’t wake up to answer, but Clare knew what it would be. Jude was self-sacrificial because he thought he was Superman. His family was his life, and he would do anything to keep them safe. But that didn’t make it okay for him to jump in front of Death’s scythe. Clare would have preferred to die by Lucifer’s hand than to ever witness his husband and unborn children in the same position. As he stared down at Jude’s closed eyes and the line of dark blood under his freckled nose, Clare could feel his own heart pounding with rage and fear.
Gabriel took a step back from the counter and gestured forward to give Sam a clear view – of a plastic uterus and several pictures of embryos on the counter next to the giant notebook. It looked like Gabriel was getting ready to give a presentation on the reproductive system, and the thought made Sam realize -
“Papa and I have some stuff to do today, so you'll have to stay here with Jude and your uncles for a while, okay?” Sam explained.
She and Daddy shared a secret wink – the kind that was just for the two of them – before kissing her cheek and standing back up. Papa stepped closer again to take Jess's hand and gently pull her toward the table behind them.
“Yeah, we are. My mate is in heat and I’m gonna bang him until he’s satisfied,” Clare smirked, thrusting his hips with Jude’s tugging motions, “You about ready to sit on this thing or what?”
Jude paused to turn and give Clare a reassuring look before following his cousin to the mess they made. Clarence stood next to Oliver and watched the angels shift the hulking cars around like they were made of plastic rather than compressed metal. Clarence didn't realize that his fingers were tapping nervously against his jeans until he looked down and saw them moving. God, he wanted the warlock dead so bad. He wanted it to be over, once and for all.
laws of aviation? I mean, you're a grown man with wings. You can fly," Dean reasoned, his green eyes observing Cas. He was straight, but–
exactly was he supposed to say this? Before he could continue, Cas was beside him, hand on his shoulder. Dean swallowed again, turning to look at the angel. He set his jaw, grinding his teeth. It pained him. The want was so great, and yet Dean couldn't do anything about it. He shouldn't. He
"Sadness should not be a factor in producing tears," Castiel argued. "There is no scientific nor logical explanation for why intense emotions cause these 'tears'." He looked at Dean. "What do you do when someone has this problem, Dean?"
(He'd asked all of those before, but never explicitly. God forbid if Dean Winchester ever bared himself for anyone, right?) Instead, he said: "You know, the hens still need you."
to be fixed. He didn't want to be mended together and turned whole just to please others. Scars were there for a reason; he wanted someone who loved him despite of them, or because of them – or both.
When Dean gingerly set a hand on Cas's shoulder, he finally reacted. "Dean," he said hoarsely. He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out, just a pathetic sob.
Dean's brow twitched. "Yeah, well, so did I. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do when in Purgatory, Cas. It's hell."
"Cas, I can't– I can't," Dean said bluntly, hoping that Cas would catch his meaning. "Not– not yet."
Castiel closed his eyes, his wing protectively shielding Dean from whatever might want to hurt him. "Okay." He squeezed his hand.
Dean didn't get it. He glanced at the plants, then at Cas, then back at the plants again. "Watching what?" he inquired.
Dean spoke before he could stop himself. "Forever," he said. "Please." It was a question, an invitation, a prayer.
Castiel turned his head so that his side profile was against the sun, and– God, Dean was done for. "'Oh' what?" Something about his voice told Dean that he knew what, but wanted to hear Dean say it.
When Dean walked out onto the porch, Cas was mumbling (singing?) in Enochian. He was a little farther down, so Dean just stayed, watching. It almost looked like... He frowned, squinting. Castiel's wings were iridescent – every feather had a rainbow sheen. Despite their ongoing 'argument', Dean smiled, and– oh.
was a mystery, and Dean wasn't sure if he was ready to try to solve him just yet. What he wanted to say was:
. Dean knew that this was just Castiel's vessel, but the angel had inhabited it for so long that it was really just Castiel now. Castiel, the angel, the hunter, the friend; Dean's Castiel. "Hey."
As Dean walked across the farm, a wasp came to bother him. They usually made hives in the farmhouse, and he did his best to avoid them, but sometimes they came and were – well, wasps. He swatted it away, but it came back as quickly ad it had come, so he ran. He exorcised demons and killed monsters, and yet he ran away from a wasp.
Dean shook his head. He was supposed to be feeding the cow, not mourning his mother. There weren't that many animals at the farm, just a cow and her calf, two sheep, five or so hens and a single horse. He petted Mary's head (he wasn't good with names, and the cow was just as kind and calm as his mother had been). "Good girl," he told her. Mary licked his face. Dean sputtered. "No," he said, brows furrowed. "We
"Hey, Cas," Dean called. The angel acknowledged him with a mere nod. It wasn't strictly an invitation, but nevertheless, Dean crouched down beside him. "You were supposed to take care of the hens," he reminded him, but he wasn't actually angry. With Castiel, he never really was.
"It's okay," Castiel whispered, gently rubbing the back of Dean's calloused hand. "I'm not in a hurry," he said. "I can stay as long as you like, if only you let me."
Castiel nodded, but he didn't take his eyes off of Dean. "It is." A silence fell over them, and Dean knew what was coming next. "Dean," began Cas, "you do know we're going to have to talk." Dean nodded. "I am not alone with this, am I?" Dean closed his eyes.
The lady blinked at Jude a few more times, making the heat rise quicker on his cheeks, before answering Sam's question.
Jude's heart nearly melted inside his ribcage. Ugh, that was so sweet. Today, Clarence was the best poet in the world. With his smile still intact, Clarence walked back over to Jude's open arms and met him with a kiss. This one tasted different than the first. It had a lot more heat – and a lot more tongue. The bonfire in Jude's chest, which always burned for Clarence, was slowly spreading to the rest of his body. This was it. Jude had been waiting for this since the moment he said yes...
The forceful end of Lucifer’s celestial shout echoed through the air as he stood glaring inches away from God’s face. They were both silent now, only staring at each other through an invisible curtain. God was on his side and Lucifer was on his own. That was how it had always been and would always be. Lucifer would
Thankfully, Bobby picked up a new conversation with Meg – something about how Crowley could be a real pain in the ass sometimes – as Jude opened the door at his back and led his fiance out into the hall. Even when they were finally alone in the empty corridor, Clare still couldn't get the smile off his face. He spun around to face Jude with a look of sheer delight.
One of Papa's hands slipped inside his jacket pocket – and returned with a piece of paper between his fingers. He held out the rectangular paper to Jessie, who instantly snatched it away to read the printed words on the front.
Gabriel was suddenly walking toward Sam, taking soft and slow steps. Dean could see the heartache in his golden eyes and it kind of surprised him. He didn't know that the trickster was capable of feeling sorry for someone else, but it was obvious that Gabriel
An genuine smile beamed from Jude's face when he held up his new shorts to look at them. Dean and Cas seemed just as confused as Sam was by Gabe's random shopping spree. Wanting answers, Sam stepped forward and put his hands on his hips.
Dean remembered the incident clearly. At the Thompson's house, Cas's arm was nailed to the wall with that damn angel blade and Dean was on the verge of freaking out. But then Jude was able to power up and pull the blade out almost effortlessly. And whenever Jude's eyes lit up, so did Dean's necklace. And his own, too. Jude's Superman necklace shined just as bright. But why?
At first, Clare had his back to Jude and kept playing; gingerly plucking the strings as if he was caressing the guitar instead of playing it. It gave Jude a chance to realize that the guy was wearing a suit. An
The two of them each gave a chuckle and shared a look of complete understanding. Jude thought it was so nice to talk to someone who could relate to exactly what he was going through. Jessie reached out both of her arms and wrapped Jude into a tight hug.
“I... I think that Jude and Jessica would enjoy having a large meal with their family... No matter where it takes place,” Cas answered carefully.
“You lied,” Clare immediately pointed out, finally regaining his voice to accuse the man in the room with him, “That's not Death's curse. It's yours.”
“Papa taught me a trick once,” she explained, keeping her eyes on Clarence, “He said that angel grace is easy to find if you have some of your own. They can link up with each other, if you send grace out; kinda like an electric boomerang.”
Dean could feel two small forms slowly pressing flat against his chest while he lay sleeping on his side. He was groggy and halfway unconscious, so he didn't really know what was pushing on his torso. But the movement was starting to irritate him. Who was doing that? Was Cas trying to roll him over? Was Sam trying to wake him up? Dean eventually opened his eyes to see who was responsible for forcing him awake – and saw two short little legs stretched toward his chest.
Cas’s jaw shifted back and forth, as if he was chewing on his reply. He seemed unwilling to answer at first, but finally gave in.
!” Sam nearly yelled, yanking the book out of the kid's hand, “Crowley is only twenty yards away! Along with Clarence and everyone else! You can't just summon a warlock this close to them!”
“I know you've got fire in there somewhere, Jude!” Clare nearly shouted, “I've always known it was there! You just have to
Though Dean was most definitely leading the way, all four of them were suddenly dashing back into the parking lot. A few feet away, the Impala was still sitting in the space Dean had parked in – only, it wasn't the same way he had left it.
Cas was a millennia old being who had seen civilizations rise and fall, some by his own hands but he felt like a fledgling angel again looking into the hazel green eyes of Dean Winchester. He knew Ash was right and Dean deserved to know but the fact was scared of rejection from the only human being that he had ever truly romantically loved. Now that Cas had learned more about human emotion and love through Ash, he felt better about the whole prospect of professing his feelings for Dean.
Over the next two months everything for Ashby was amazing, except for one thing, Cas began to be more and more distant, shutting her off from him more and more often. At first she really didn’t think about it but as the weeks went on she noticed that he would be shut off for hours at a time. They still spent a few hours a week in the cabin her and Cas, Cas and Dean also spent time there, while Ash would help them have their time alone. Cas still seemed like he wanted to be with her as much as he always did but when she would start to discuss the wedding, Cas would become distracted and insist that they return to her body and let her rest.
Ash and Cas were both really glad to hear from him, and to know that the whole hunting party was ok. When Dean told them it would probably be another two or so days before he and Sam would get home, they took it well but he could tell they were disappointed. Hell, he was disappointed! The thing was that Cas was a hunter too and understood how it goes on a hunt. Ash had learned a lot in the almost year she had been with Cas and the Winchesters and was a good soldier about it as well. That broke Dean’s heart to think about, Ash being yet another Winchester solider against the ever rising tide of the supernatural but he was so glad to have her. She had brought Cas back to him, she had brought herself to him and for that he was forever grateful, forever changed.
Cas was also insistent that the wedding take place on the land that the cabin between the worlds had been based on. Ash had told them that if we were going to do it there, it would have to be in the fall when the hills and mountains would look like they were on fire. She had always loved this area but it was especially beautiful at this time of year.
“I understand that, you two have been manipulated, mutilated, killed, resurrected and lied to more than should ever have been allowed, but I am not here to deceive you. I am here to be reunited with my Family. I found this new vessel and she found me, she willingly gave herself so that I could be in human form once again. I am not as you say “screwing” with you about any of this.” was Cas’s reply.
Cas opens up brilliant blue eyes that hold a warmth that comes from deep within, she reaches up her hand and touches the cheek of the man bent over her. Giving a look of pure joy that makes her eyes twinkle like blue diamonds, without even thinking about it Dean leans in to the soft touch. “Oh, you must be Dean,” she drops her hand from Dean’s stubbly face and continues, “What did you do to Castiel?  That boy has been trying to find you for months, he’s here but really angry and hurt.” Her clear, soft voice is very different from the one that comes out of the vessel when Cas is “at the wheel”, the accent a little thicker, the voice a little more lilting. Even though it is so different, Dean doesn’t know why but the sound of it makes him feel that same jolt of peace, comfort and love that he did after listening to Cas’s message on his old phone. The same feeling he has always had with Cas.
Dean expected Clarence to get upset at Crowley's blunt comments, but the kid just glared a hole through the demon's face. Bobby huffed an audible breath before shoving passed his negative husband.
The noise of running footsteps coming toward the kitchen paused the couple's heated conversation. Both of them looked toward the doorway to see their grown son stop and look inside. There was a sense of dread and fear on Jude's face as he glanced between his parents.
Dean had to practically pull himself free from the angel's grasp to walk away. Emotions were trying to get the best of him but Dean really wanted to focus on the things he needed to do. Sam and Gabriel were in the middle of their own passionate goodbye when Dean tugged Sam on the arm and gestured toward the door. Geez, why was everybody getting so damn emotional? It wasn't that big of a deal. They were just leaving for a few hours to get Bobby.
The angel stepped to face Dean again and his large blue eyes rolled all over the man's torso. Dean's heart was already pounding, flooding his body with adrenaline and lust. Cas leaned forward a tiny bit, just enough to position his lips less than an inch from Dean's. They were sharing the same hot breath then, eying each others' faces in close range. Shit, Dean wished Cas would just smother him with that angelic tongue...
“Please, brother,” Cas continued, “Tell me how I can satisfy Dean's lust for dominance without hurting him. My actions caused him physical pain today. And I do not wish to harm him - ”
It wasn’t a question. It was an order. And surprisingly, Dean’s boyfriend seemed to do exactly as he was told. The storage quarters vanished, replaced with the chamber containing the shimmery portal that Dean remembered from their trip to Earth. The flight was so quick that it made him momentarily dizzy. He didn’t realize they were there until Cas’s arm disappeared from his back and he heard metal clanking together.
The sound of Lucifer's merciless taunt cut into Castiel's heart like a butcher's knife. The seraph was momentarily frozen in grief and fear a few feet from the devil, eyes beginning to glisten on their own. No. Jude was not dead. He couldn't be dead. Jude was Castiel's baby; his son, his purpose for living. And he had to be alive.
. The demon boy must have rushed across the room because the headphones he had been wearing were tossed on the floor. His face was pale, eyes were huge, and thin arms were cradling Jude against his chest like a huge football. Jude could feel his own eyes widening as they blinked at each other in shock. Clarence broke his fall. Clarence actually got up, ran across the room, and held both arms out to catch Jude before he hit the floor. And now they were both too stunned to say anything.
Lucifer lowered the shaft of the scythe into both of his palms and twisted his fingers around it as he glared out toward the horizon in the distance. If he couldn’t kill God, those Winchesters were the next best thing. His quarrel had never been with them, but after that stupid nephilim made him look like a fool, Lucifer had to prove his power. He had to regain his edge; make everyone think twice about crossing him. Let the universe know that he wouldn’t allow himself to be stepped on anymore. He wasn’t some dog that could be thrown in a cage. He was fury incarnate. The embodiment of wrath. There was no better way to start his reign of terror than with those Winchesters.
"Dean," Castiel said from the table, his wings nervously flapping as he clutched onto his lukewarm tea. Blackcurrant black tea. Dean didn't understand why the guy liked it so much. Coffee was much more Dean's thing. It helped when you had to pull an all-nighter or when you had to actually stay awake and alive during the day. And it was bitter, a flavor Dean had gotten used to and started to love (or at the very least like).
Castiel wiped at the corners of his eyes, staring intently on the drop of liquid on his fingertip. "I believe this is what you call a tear," he stated, all cool and doctor-like. Dean nodded. "Why are my eyes... leaking them?"
"You're the only person I've referred to, albeit metaphorically, as a church. I have been waiting to tell you that." Dean thought he saw a flicker of pride on Castiel's face, amidst all the guilt and sadness. "It is my own poem." Dean arched his eyebrows. His face was flushed, and he knew he was being very transparent about it. Cas placed a hand on his forehead. "Do you have a fever, Dean? You feel warm."
"I've heard that some people like to receive hugs when they're feeling upset. It unleashes positive, happiness-boosting chemicals in our bodies." Castiel blinked once, twice. "Do you mind if we try it?"
Dean swatted his hand away. "Personal space, remember?" He shook his head. "We were talking about Purgatory," he said, desperate to change the subject. Castiel fell eerily silent. Dean just
The angel just clenched his jaw. "I know," he responded, then left the building. Dean groaned. He had to fix this. Whatever
The work was done fast (too fast) because there were two of them and five hens, which really amounted to nothing. But Dean wanted to stay. Luckily, Cas gave him an excuse to do just that. "Can I pick one up?" he asked quietly, like he didn't want to scare them off; his voice was barely above a whisper. Dean nodded, so Cas scooped one up in his arms. It was black like Castiel's wings. "Does she have a name?" he asked.
Dean stared. "What about, hm, Angelus?" he suggested, but the hen was not the angel he was thinking about. "Because her feathers are, um. The same color as your wings."
Dean was so stunned and horrified by what the blonde kid on his doorstep said, that he almost didn't notice the guy slipping passed him. Dean's sight stayed fixed on the moving person, but the hunter's mind was elsewhere; racing with questions. Clarence? Meg? No. Hell no. That guy couldn't be Meg's kid. Demons couldn't have kids, could they? There was no way that grungy, rude, arrogant dick could be Meg's kid! Who was he really? And how did he know where the bunker was?!
“Death?” he repeated, shaking his head, “How the hell are we supposed to get Death to break a curse?”
” Jessica suddenly shouted, before gulping and dialing it back, “I – I mean, um, I do want to have lunch with you! And it's totally fine if your mom is there! In fact, Dad and Papa might want -”
“Sure,” Jess agreed, turning her eyes back to Oliver’s handsome face, “I’ll, um, see you when you get back inside.”
“Cas would never hurt Jude on purpose. It’s just the birth, you know? It’s supposed to be painful,” Mom mentioned.
The sharp acidity of Oliver's tone seemed to cut his dad to the bone. The man just stood there behind the counter with a look of awe painted on his pale face. Honestly, Oliver couldn't stand looking at him anymore. It was just to damn enraging.
Jess's heart started thumping again when she met her own eyes in the mirror. Wow, this was really it. She was actually wearing her wedding dress! She had seen it in some of her dreams, but she never thought that it would be this beautiful; so lovely and joy-provoking. Jessica felt like she would burst into a fit of giggles at any moment. Even though her blonde hair was kind of messy and she wasn't wearing make-up, Jess still felt like a runway model. Because her wedding dress made her feel like the most beautiful angel in the world...
As Jude watched his fiance chew up a bite of pie, he sensed a change in their conversation. Clare's smile slowly slipped away and he was blinking hard at Jude; staring him down with hollow eyes and sharp facial features. The pie he was holding lowered further and further down until it fell out of his hands and tumbled onto the floor. Jude blinked down at the cherry mess before looking back up to his gargoyle-like fiance. Why did Clare drop his pie? And why was he looking at Jude like that?
Jude glanced back to Clarence's face and could tell that the guy was genuinely curious. It was actually really nice to see Clarence hopeful and happy for once. Though it made Jude feel bad about the answer he had to give.
“Maybe one day,” he answered, giving her a little smile, “but now, it's time for bed. Right, Papa Cas?”
Meg probably knew Dean was under that hood. She saved Dean because she knew he meant a lot to Cas. Meg was loyal to the king. So loyal that she even gave her life for him…
Before Jess could explain to Ollie how much she missed him too, the old man's voice echoed from the back again. Jessica nearly groaned out loud when she heard it. Ugh. Why couldn't he leave Ollie alone for five minutes?!
was the good stuff? What, no Bob Segar? No Foreigner, Kansas, or Rolling Stones? Not even the Beatles? Maybe Dean needed to reinstate that strike...
The smile on Jude's face faltered a bit. Stay for dinner? He never planned to actually fly to Bobby's house, let alone stay for dinner. But that persuasive, pleading look on Clare's face – piercing eyes, lifted brows, pouted lips – made him want to stay for as long as possible.
The two of them were able to stare at each other for only a moment before the waiter arrived. Of course, it seemed like he didn't speak much English, but he understood when Oliver said 'salad' and 'wine.' The waiter took the menus and returned a second later to fill their glasses with the sweetly fermented drink. Once he left for the second time, Oliver took his wine glass and raised it up.
“Total surprise,” Oliver added, “Jess just did the yellow grace thing and – yeah. Pretty much what happened to you and Dean, it sounds like.”
Jessica had to cover her mouth to muffle the gasp she inhaled. What?! Lucifer wanted to take Grandpa Chuck's place or something?! The guy was absolutely crazy! They would never let anything like that happen! Even as Jess thought this, she could tell that Michael was mulling it over in his mind. The archangel was actually considering Lucifer's condition.
“Hmm… I’ve been trying to think of names that go with Gibson, because they’re twins,” Jude explained.
“Yeah. It turned him human so that he and Jude could try for a baby. And it didn’t work. It made the poor kid sick,” Bobby recalled.
Dickie sat down next to Cas on the floor to watch him with curious eyes. Once he had the angel blade in his hand, Castiel paused to look down at the top of his own glowing stomach. Fear and anxiety were inching their way back into his heart, reminding him that he could very well end up killing both himself and his unborn child if he did not do this correctly. One small slip and they would both be dead. Feeling a new stir of emotion, Castiel briefly looked up toward the ceiling, pining for courage and clarity.
“Dad and the others trapped the warlock. He's down there, in the basement,” Jude finally began, gesturing toward the staircase nearby.
“Are you sure you're gonna be alright driving all the way home tonight, Bobby? South Dakota is a long trip.”
person she loved.  (I hope it came across that way in the story, too.) Also, the inspiration for the drag queen karaoke bar came from two sources. One, was because of Richard Speight Jr. at Friday Night Karaoke jams at the SPN conventions. (He is great, especially when he's dressed up as a character.) And the second came from a movie I watched on Netflix this week, called “Dumplin'.” (If you haven't seen that movie, I strongly recommend it to you, I laughed and cried all the way through. It's amazing.) ;D Another note, the Spanish line that Jane says to Rowena at the bar translates as: “Yes! Let's Sing!” (Once again, I used Google translator. I hope it is correct. Lol) ;) I really hope you guys enjoyed this week's chapter, especially with all of clueless Castiel's lines. ;D Next week's chapter will be out soon!
“H – He proposed?” Ollie muttered, unaware that he was missing the dog bowl as he poured it, “Like... like a 'marriage' proposal?”
Jude swallowed a large gulp and shrugged a little bit. He sort of knew what Daddy and uncle Sam did. They carried weapons around and beat up bad guys, just like Batman and Thor. But sometimes they wore really nice suits like business people wore on TV. Jude thought that those were their 'alter ego' costumes; the ones they had to wear so that no one knew they were superheroes. Did superheroes have job titles?
While Bobby embraced the kids, Dean caught sight of the dogs on the floor. The three hell hounds found their father's basket, but Dickie obviously had no intention of sharing the goodies inside. The Jack Russell gave his canine sons a tiny growl before grabbing the basket handle in his mouth and dashing away with it. Peter, Willy, and Humphrey all chased their dad out of the room with wagging tails, seeming determined to steal his stuff.
Rowena, Bobby, and Clarence all turned to give the demon king a few harsh stares. As rude as his comment was, Crowley only cocked an eyebrow back at them.
Castiel looked back at the strange contraption on the floor and finally understood their reactions. The way the farmer was handling the stick – shoving it down inside the small opening, over and over – was reminiscent of sexual intercourse. Cas was unable to move his eyes now. The bright blue orbs were glued to the stick moving up and down, penetrating the tiny hole. Arousal was flickering in Castiel's lower stomach and growing to accommodate his pelvis. Suddenly, twenty-four hours seemed like a lifetime. His vessel was fully aware that it had been denied intercourse for incredibly too long...
“Jeanette taught me how to paint them,” he said, voice much lighter, “She was one of the women I grew up with... She was painting something on a canvas one day, and I think I stole one of her brushes and started copying her by painting on the walls,” he chuckled a bit, “She didn't scold me, though. She actually knelt down on the floor with me and started brushing flowers on the brick. I don't know how long we spent down there. It was almost like a mural by the time we were done... Man, I wish you could have seen it, Jaybird. You would have loved it...”
Gabriel grabbed Sam's arm and disappeared while the man was in mid sentence, cutting off the rest of his rant by transporting them to a new place. By the roaming crowds, travel bags and suitcases, terminals, seats, and the sound of loud jets taking off, Sam assumed that his husband had popped them to the airport. The blonde archangel spun in circles for a second, searching the area with terror and worry before leaning over to tap on a nearby vending machine. A bottle of water fell out of the bottom and Gabe picked it him.
The angel knew that the dog didn't understand was he was saying, but it felt good to voice his thoughts. Dickie simply grabbed his moose and trotted off with it in his mouth, probably taking it somewhere to hide it from his owner. Castiel watched him go as he carefully climbed back to his feet and patted his left pocket. The small stuffed honey bee was in there, delicately hidden inside his coat for safe keeping. Behind Cas, everyone was still talking about various aspects of the pregnancy and the angel rejoined the conversation just in time to hear Dean ask a very important question.
Bobby growled as he shook the pastry from his body and furiously wiped the pink icing from his face. He turned to point a stern finger at Dean.
Dean glanced down at the glass of milk on the table and felt amused. A late night glass of milk was basically the PG version of grabbing a cold beer to drink your thoughts away. It looked like Jude needed more than just a shot of dairy right now.
Castiel and Jude both turned to look toward the sound of Dean's voice. The man – now dressed in a pair of pajama pants – had walked out of the bathroom just in time to hear the last piece of Cas's statement. The angel smiled warmly at his husband as the man drew nearer.
It was an industrial sized kitchen, equipped with vintage refrigerators, stoves, and cook wear. A stainless steel island was positioned in the center of the room with pots and pans hanging over it from a ceiling rack. A small wooden table with rounded seats sat off to the right side, with a white sink and bulletin board on the wall next to it. Dean's eyes wandered over the entire space, taking it all in. He could totally see himself sneaking in here at two in the morning for a slice of pie, or cooking up breakfast for the kids on the weekend. It was a cozy kitchen; a warm and welcoming place where everyone could eat and be happy.
Luckily, Crowley and Rowena entered the room and provided a slight distraction for both Dean and Castiel. Rowena looked woeful, staring apologetically at Cas with both of her hands braced on her chest. Crowley, on the other hand, seemed eager for answers. He came in with his hands in the pockets of his suit pants and brown eyes fixed studiously on the angel sitting in the chair.
Dean didn’t fully understand the concept of feeling lonely until he was in the king’s quarters by himself.
Dean completely turned toward the kitchen table to give his little brother a full look of total bewilderment. Middle of the first trimester? What the hell? Since when did Sam know so much about pregnancy? Under Dean's look of confusion, Sam shrugged his shoulders and reached for his laptop on the table.
Ms. Jane was driving her big silver car with Jessie in the passenger seat beside her. For the first time since Jessie could remember, it was just the two of them. No daddies or papas or uncles or boys. Today was a girl's day. Ms. Jane glanced down at Jess and smiled a big lovely smile.
“See?” Crowley cooed, “You have magic wings that can carry you. All you have to do is flap them and they'll take you anywhere you want to go.”
The dog barked once at Gabriel before dashing back out the door. Castiel was surprised to see such calmness in Gabriel's composure. The archangel didn't appear hostile in the least as he closed the door and gestured toward the front of the car.
After sharing another look, Jude's parents began to step forward, carefully tugging him along. Jude's eyes instantly dropped to the floor and tried to give himself a mental pep talk as they moved. '
Dean studied the angel, noticing that his breath seemed labored and he was slumping toward the wall. He looked tired all of the sudden. Why?
Yeah. This chapter dealt with a lot of serious topics, but hopefully it's all within the realm of possibility when it comes to Supernatural. I think a lot of us would benefit from behaving as innocently as children who always tell the truth. Sometimes it's better to speak up and say, “Hey, this is how I'm feeling, please help,” rather than bottling it up inside. (That is what I hope happens with Dean on the show before it's too late, to be honest.) And yes, ever since *that* fanfic came out, Elvis Presley's “Can't Help Falling in Love” has been the unofficial Destiel anthem in my heart as well. (You guys know exactly what I'm talking about. Lol) ;D Whether you are happy or not about Meg's return into this story, I think we can all agree that no one should ever question their existence on this Earth – And if
While Jessie hugged her dad, she felt a tiny paw tap on her leg. Dickie was whining and looking at her with big brown eyes. Aw, he was just as worried and afraid as everybody else. To keep him calm, Jessie let go of Dad to pick up Dickie and hold him. And when he was close enough, Dickie licked her cheek and snuggled into her arms, making himself at home.
Cas glared at Dean for a few more seconds, holding fistfuls of Dean’s shirt and jacket, before he whimpered and buried his face into Dean’s shoulder. Dean instantly wrapped both arms around Cas at the weird angle, trying his best to comfort him. Cas’s behavior suddenly made sense. The reason Cas kept Dean locked away wasn’t because he didn’t trust Dean or his skills, but because he couldn’t stomach the thought of losing him again. Dean’s death in this universe had a catastrophic impact on Cas’s entire being, and now that Dean was back again, Cas was going to do everything in his power to save him…
“And when we have parties, all of the neighborhood kids come over. Because you bounce on the trampoline with them, and do giant cannonballs in the pool,” Jess went on with another giggle, “I've seen you ride bikes, do finger paintings, wrestle, dance, dress up as Santa Claus... Ollie, you have nothing to worry about. Our kids are going to have the best dad in the world.”
“Want some lunch, Cas?” Dean asked, subconsciously trying to change the subject as he spotted an empty booth, “Burger? Jar of honey? Anything?”
“Uh,” uncle Gabe gulped, glancing back at uncle Sam in fear, “It rained for a few minutes in the parking lot.”
“Well, yeah,” he shrugged, “I thought it might give Clarence something to do and stall for some time so that you could -”
“Not this time, Gabe,” he breathed, reaching up to run his thumb across the archangel's moist bottom lip, “but if you do a good job with Cas and help Bobby with this portal, I swear I'll pound your tight ass so hard you won't be able to walk for days.”
Sam gulped when he glanced down to take in the magnitude of lust in Gabe's honey eyes. Just looking at him made Sam feel horny in return. Of course, the hand down the back of his pants didn't help either. Before Sam could even lean down for a kiss though, Dean groaned out loud with disgust.
“No. Lucifer will surely find her again,” Michael answered, “We need to put her somewhere she will be safe.”
Oliver's head raised a tiny bit. Dickie had finally settled down and was now laying in the kid's lap, quietly listening to the calmer conversation. And Ollie's hand rested on the dog's back as he looked to Dean.
Jessica and Ollie both looked toward her parents, seeing Papa's eyes widen in shock. Obviously, he didn't realize that he had answered for Jessica until just now. Next to him, Dad shook his head and rolled his eyes.
“I mean it,” Eddie gently pressed, “Go have fun while you're young... Just call me every once and a while, okay? I – I'm still your old man.”
Though her body was still hurting a little, Jess felt herself giggling. All of the raw pain she just went through was well worth it to be able to have this moment. Inside her arms, Charlie made gurgly noises and blinked up at her with wet eyes.
Jude almost turned Clare's entire bedroom upside down looking for the shiny ring – pulling out drawers, tossing stray clothes around, digging through every last crease of bed sheets – but he couldn't find it. An absolute storm of anxiety swirled in his chest as he eventually backed up against the door and looked around with tears in his eyes. No, no, no, Jude couldn't lose that ring! Clare had gotten down on one knee and gave it to him!
The sight of the empty potion bottle made Rowena's delicate eyebrows lift. Her arms unwound and fell to her sides before she reached out to snatch the glass container from Meg.
“Well, duh. I'm not leaving my hubby behind,” Gabe winked, finishing off his candy with a huge chomp, “What are we gonna do with the rabbit?”
After the last syllable was out, Michael turned and started walking away before anyone could protest. Jessie glanced back at the boys and Jude could tell that she wasn't convinced. It seemed like Michael's bargain wasn't as honest as he made it out to be. Was he seriously trying to trick the devil? That probably wasn't going to work out too well for anyone...
“He's playing with you. That's his specialty. Trust me, Sam, I know,” Gabriel explained, forcing Sam to march along with him, “Tune out his bullshit and come on.”
Everyone turned to look at the silent giant in the room. Gabe hoped that since Sam had a hard time with becoming a dad a long time ago that he could shed some light on the situation for Oliver. Sam was still pretty pale, but a touch of color had returned to his cheeks. His big eyes drifted from Gabe and Oliver back to Jessica, where he looked from her shiny shirt back to her lovely face. And then something happened that Gabriel didn't expect... Sam actually
'! Sam and Gabriel toppled out of the bathtub and landed in a heap on the bathroom floor, both wet, naked, and brandishing shiny erections. Sam scrambled to sit up and observe his archangel, worried that he had accidentally hurt him.
Jude gulped. Clearly, Clare had no idea that Jude could see his true form. Should Jude tell the guy that he was looking at his demonic soul? While Jude struggled to come up with an answer, there was a knock on Jude's bedroom door. Clare's ashy hand raised reassuringly toward Jude.
“Fine,” Crowley huffed, reaching out to pat Bobby's shoulder, “Darling, will you be alright with the teenagers while take my mother to hell and back?”
“I wanted to talk to Jude and Jess about some things. And bake stuff with them. You know, spend some quality time with my grandchildren while they're still young,” he shrugged.
In the back of his mind, Castiel knew that hitting the side of the building with his fists would not help him break through the wards. But that didn't stop him from copying his brother anyway. The two angels were delivering powerful blows to the brick wall, using their grace to rocket swift punches repeatedly to the same spot. Castiel couldn't deny that this act was animalistic – pounding mindlessly against a wall was beastly in every way. But there was always a small chance that this could possibly work. There was no other way inside the building; no entrance they could step foot through, no window they could infiltrate. As strange as it seemed, Castiel and Gabriel were attempting to create their own entrance through means of primal anger and fear.
Dean said the last part slowly so that he could keep his tears in. Sam would have done so much more than Dean if he was there. But he wasn’t there. This was Hell. Pure Hell… Dean gave the archangel’s hand a squeeze.
“What're you dipshits lookin' at?” he mumbled, darting quickly out of the room, “Don't you got somethin' better to do besides loiter in my house? Go save some people and hunt some things or somethin.' Geez.”
Dean blinked hard a few times, trying to keep the sudden abundance of moisture in his eyes. Damn. Cas was such a loving poetic bastard...
“Yeah, probably,” Dean agreed, reaching down into the plastic bag in his hand, “It's kind of a good thing Jude's not here yet, right? It'll make this a surprise.”
When Papa was done passing out shirts, he handed a special one to Jessica and nodded toward the bathroom.
Gabe wanted to ask his super-hot husband who he was talking to, but before he could even sit up to look around, a loud snap echoed from nearby – and a rush of memories came flooding back to Gabriel’s mind.
“Oh, Jude, I remember the first time you met me and my Calabaza at the playground,” the Hispanic lady hummed, “Such a small thing you were!”
Jessica blinked up at her papa with large eyes, soaking in his every word and action. Sam stayed silent as Gabriel went on, waiting to see exactly how the archangel would explain this topic.
The man reluctantly raised his head to look toward the direction the sound was coming from. For a brief moment, Dean was paranoid enough to think that Gabriel had been spying on them and wanted to ruin their moment by calling just to piss him off. But after listening to the phone ring again, Dean was convinced that it had to be Sam or Bobby. Because if Gabriel really wanted to ruin a moment, he would have done something a lot more drastic than a simple phone call.
Though he was confused, Jude gulped and sat down. The position of the chair put everyone else at Jude's back while he faced the lone chair a few feet in front of him, which Clare quickly took. It wasn't until Clare picked up his black guitar, positioned in in his lap, and reached up to adjust the microphone stand in front of him that Jude realized – Clare was about to play a song. After giving the mic a few taps, Clare scooted forward in his chair to talk into it.
The kitchen settled into an uncomfortable silence after Bobby's absence. Sam and Gabriel were fidgeting by the doorway. And Dean was pacing angrily back and forth in front of the refrigerator like a caged lion waiting for its next meal. Castiel desperately wished that he could end Dean's discomfort. But how?
Cas spared a quick kiss to Dean's open mouth and the man could practically taste the seriousness in it.
Jessica only had time to blink her eyes shut before their lip slowly collided. Ollie's mouth was warm and moist, housing the faint taste of candy apples. Jess's heart was beating so hard that she thought it might beat out of her chest, just like Jude said. They were
Despite getting up early to practice his vows, repeating them out loud at his wedding, harnessing his nerves long enough to play his song for Jude, and then rushing to the infirmary just in time to meet his new niece, Clarence was a lot less tired than he thought he would be. Cleaning up the reception tables in the garage felt less like a chore and more like fun, since the music was still playing. Jude, on the other hand, kept yawning the whole time he stacked chairs and folded table cloths. The poor guy was trying his best to help, but Clare could tell the day had exhausted Jude's nerves.
“Good,” Dean agreed, his hot breath brushing against the rim of Cas's ear, “You distract me all the time, Cas. Gotta return the favor.”
Though they were no longer kissing, Dean and the king’s hands were still tangled together. Strangely, Dean didn’t want to let go. He held on for dear life, as if he was strapped into a roller coaster he couldn’t get off of. But he couldn’t bring himself to look at Cas’s eyes, either. He knew that they were full of pain and confusion and he wasn’t brave enough to witness it… In saving the heart of one Cas, Dean had ruined the other…
"It's alright, Dad. He's going to find out about us anyway," Jessie explained carefully, reaching up to pat Sammy's shoulder.
The Winchesters glanced at each other and Dean could see the embarrassment and discomfort in Sam's face. Sam was deliberately hesitating, probably worried that Dean was going to say something against Sam and Gabriel sleeping in the same bed. But, after a long-ass day of personal reflections and talking shit out, Dean didn't mind it anymore. Who was he to stop his little brother from getting into bed with the trickster? If Sam wanted to do it, then Dean wasn't going to stand in his way. The older brother gave the younger a shrug, signaling his indifference. The tiny smile that lit up Sam's face made Dean feel kind of proud. Hmm. Maybe he
It took a long time for Jude to find a comfortable position to sit in. The bars on the floor of the cage were really hard under him and he kept crossing his legs so his butt wouldn't fall asleep. Plus, the room was pretty cold and it made him cross his arms tight. Uncle Gabe seemed to find it more comfortable, though. Or he just didn't care. He was propped up in one corner with his legs stretched out, but his shoulders were slumped and he looked worried; even more than he did when that Naomi lady was there a second ago.
Dean looked the archangel in the eye while he was talking, trying to make sure Gabriel could see his seriousness. Dean cared for Bobby just as much, if not more, than anyone else did. And he wasn't about to let his father-figure down, especially after all of the kindness he had given Dean lately. To the man's surprise, Gabriel's eyes seemed to soften a little. The archangel glanced around the room – eying Bobby, Dean and Cas's joined hands, and Sam's puppy-eyes – before meeting Dean's stare again.
There are some more sad parts in this chapter. I’m so sorry for the feels, but happier times are coming. I promise! XD Thank you, and enjoy!
It only took Clarence less than fifteen minutes to get his things together. The astoundingly short amount of time left Jude mentally scrambling to cope with his eminent departure. Before Jude knew it, the whole family was standing in the garage with Clarence and giving him their goodbyes. Uncle Bobby, Crowley, and Rowena stood by Bobby's truck and waited with smiles, watching their 'newly adopted' son say goodbye to all the Winchesters. Clarence started with uncle Sam and uncle Gabe, and Jude's heart hammered faster as he made his way down the line toward him.
“You alright, Barbie?” Clare asked, his tone low and hard, as if he was ready to hurt anyone who had made her cry.
Sam's grin slowly faded away as his eyes traveled back to the pretty rainbow bike in front of him. Dean always hated seeing that sad look on his little brother's face. It was like denying him his own bike all over again. A few seconds of silence ticked by before Sam looked back up at Dean.
, your ass has a perfect curvature. And now that I’ve been around your parents long enough, I can tell you got it from Cas. His is just covered by that trench coat, so it’s hard to see. But I’m grateful he passed it down to you,” Clare chuckled once, reaching up to caress Jude’s warm cheek, “I could talk for hours about how beautiful you are. How much I love your blue eyes, your freckles, your perfect lips, everything. I love how shy you get in public, and how you try to hide behind me in a crowd. I love how sweet and caring you are. You do more for other people than anyone else I’ve ever met, Jay.
“Partially,” Clarence admitted, wiping the blood from his face, “D'you mind giving me a quick magic touch? I've got him on the ropes and I'd like to keep it that way.”
Jude gulped, feeling his own chest tighten in pain. Clarence looked so mad all of the sudden; absolutely furious. What was wrong? Why did he look so angry? Clarence's ground his jaw together for a second before he let go of Jude's hand completely.
Dad's statement seemed to hurt Papa more than anything. His mouth dipped open and he blinked in shock and pain. When his blue eyes fell back on Jude, Jude couldn't help but lower his head again in shame. Poor Papa. He still didn't like the thought of Jude being an adult.
Jessica barged into her uncle Bobby's house and ran back into the study as fast as she could. Her loud and sudden appearance caused every eye in the room to look toward her, even uncle Crowley's from the couch.
With shaky legs, Dean quietly shuffled closer to his son's bed. After seeing Jude in that awful nightmare, Dean felt the need to hold his child. Maybe cuddling with Jude would help his anxiety go away. Not wanting to wake him, Dean carefully lowered himself beside Jude's sleeping form, easing onto the bed as gently as possible. Luckily, the little guy didn't move at all. His tiny chest simply rose and fell with his calm breathing and his eyes stay closed. Once Dean was as close as he could get, he leaned over to press a small kiss to the side of Jude's warm temple and wrapped an arm around his entire little body. Man, he was so small. Dean rested his cheek against the top of Jude's head afterward and closed his own eyes, taking a deep breath of his child's sweet scent.
“Hey, moose-cakes, have you seen that neck tie I picked out for Jude and Clare's wedding?” Gabe asked.
Inside their shared bedroom, Dean had walked over to stand at the dresser. His head was bowed and he was leaning forward with both hands resting on the wood, as if a very heavy weight was on his shoulders. Castiel paused at the foot of their bed to search for words. What could he possibly say to make Dean feel better? Did Dean truly think that Castiel was associated with Meg in a romantic way, because of the things she said earlier? No. Meg may have felt that way for Cas, but Cas could never have reciprocated those feelings. Dean was the only being in the entire universe – of
As Jessica stared at the boy she loved with all of her heart, seeing the distress and anxiety all over his face as he walked around and tried to calm his mother, she began to wonder if their relationship was the cause of all his problems. Would things be better for Ollie if he didn't know the Winchesters? Would he be safer if he wasn't in Jessie's life? If they weren't together, Ollie would probably still be with his mother, where he belonged. Jane and Ollie could wait out the Darkness together, in their beautiful home, safe and sound. Instead, they were torn apart and worried about each other. All because Jessie wanted to keep him with her. And that didn't seem very fair...
“I still say we have it a few days early,” Bobby mumbled as he swished his coffee around in his mug, “Sounds like Jessie'll be havin' that baby pretty close to Friday, and we don't want it to interrupt the wedding.”
The archangel's hand came down firmly on Dean's shoulder – and they were suddenly standing somewhere else. The sweet smell of candy apples and fresh funnel cakes were heavy in the air, now. And the sound of merry-go-round music was close by. Dean blinked around at his new location, trying to get a grip. People were passing by, loud games were being played, cotton candy was being eaten, rides were being ridden... They were at the carnival, alright. Dean coughed and shook his head in an attempt to rid his head of the painful thoughts haunting him.
“Oh, my death isn't the only one coming,” Lucifer purred, allowing his scarlet grace to twinkle in his eyes as he glanced among his company, “We're all dead. You know it too, Mike. Now that it has nephilim grace, Darkness is going to plow through us like a wrecking ball.”
Oh no. A bad feeling? Was she getting sick? Should Jude tell her daddies that she wasn't feeling good? Just as Jude turned around to get a hold of uncle Sammy and uncle Gabe, Daddy walked up to the table.
“I know,” she mumbled back, holding on to his waist as they walked down the hall, “I just miss them.”
Clare's throat quivered with a gulp, but he pressed on, sliding so far into Jude that it caused another moan to erupt from the angel's open mouth. Shit! He was so
Dean's jaw was dangling from his mouth, gaping down at his brother in total shock. Castiel could feel the tension growing between them as they stared each other down. Oh, no. Was one of Cas's fears coming to premonition? Were the Winchesters being driven apart? Castiel tried to tug on Dean's hand again in an attempt to pull him from the angered trance he was stuck in, but it was no use. A fight was about to break out whether Cas wanted it or not. The angel could feel it.
Castiel drowned out Dean's mumbled speech by slowly capturing his mouth with a powerful, meaningful kiss. The angel wanted to sooth his husband's troubled mind with a calming gesture. There was no need for Dean to say any of those things. Castiel already knew of his appreciation and love, even without him ever saying a word. Their actions spoke louder, which is why Castiel decided to announce his understanding with a kiss.
“Oh yeah. Your momma's in good hands, Red,” Gabe said, ruffling Oliver's wild orange hair, “Now. Let's fix your dad.”
“I apologize on behalf of my witless mother,” the demon spat, tossing her another glare, “She may be a witch, but she lacks decent charm of any kind.”
Soon, the two of them were just in their underwear on Clarence's bed. Jude couldn't help but look up and down the length of Clarence's body to admire all the creamy skin and flexing muscles. Clarence's body was so beautiful; so lean, tall, and well-formed. Jude's hands traced as much of it as they could, even up Clare's spine and the long, deep scar across the back of his shoulders. But as they embraced, Jude noticed that Clare's movements were very calculated. He didn't seem very eager to be touched. And for that very reason, Jude didn't let his hands stray too far south. He only kept them on Clare's warm, exposed skin.
Dickie’s back leg must have been broken because he yelped when Papa touched it. With some of his grace, Papa healed the poor dog, making his pitiful whimpers quiet down. Jessica exhaled the breath she had been holding and briefly closed her eyes. Now, she didn’t have to feel guilty about forgetting the family pets… At least, that’s what she thought. Until she turned around.
. A piece of her messy golden hair was shining in a beam of morning sunshine and the sight made Sam wonder – where was Gabe? Sam was pretty sure he had left the archangel in bed with their daughter, but he was gone now.
Jessica picked her head up from Gabe's shoulder and nodded. One little mention of anything pertaining to the word 'play' and Jess was ready to go. Mrs. Watson gave her a fresh smile before turning to open a set of doors to her left. The Winchesters followed the headmistress back outside into a courtyard that housed very modern playground equipment. As soon as she saw other kids playing there, Jessica started to push against Gabe's hold.
“I know, Jessie,” Papa cooed, squeezing her hands tight, “And you will. You and Jude are like two peas in a pod. You were always close, even before you were born.”
Dean nearly leaped out of the sheets at the unexpected sound. Light from the hallway flooded the room and, as usual, his first instinct was get to the pistol hidden in the top drawer of his bedside table. But before he could even reach for it, he caught sight of Jude and Jessica rushing in to storm the bed. The little kids were both wearing smiles and giggling as they ran and climbed up on Dean and Cas's mattress in their pajamas.
“Hey, Rowena,” Clare smiled, turning to face the wall, “I'm at the bunker, and I need your help putting together a bachelorette party at the last minute.”
When Clare finally blinked his eyes open, he saw Jude's face hovering over him. He was kneeling on the ground with his hands clinched into fists, ready to punch Clarence in the face again – but he wasn't moving. He was just kneeling there with a scowl and a shaking fist. It wasn't until the black eyes glared toward Jude's balled hands that Clare realized... It was
Oliver nearly jumped out of his skin. He gasped and jerked his hand up, which accidentally caused him to spill dog food everywhere. Jessie giggled and covered her mouth. Oh no! She didn't mean to scare him that badly!
“They seem to be progressing well,” Pop said, “Your twins are healthy, Jude. And… I believe I detect a bit of new grace.”
“Come on,” Sam said, taking Gabe's arm and carting him forward as the archangel worked, “We're gonna start with the plane from Indiana.”
The angel gulped under Dean's intense stare. When it came to Dean's affections, Sam was of his own caliber; set apart from everyone else. Castiel knew that Sam would always be the most important person in Dean's life, no matter the circumstances. But to hear, straight from the man's mouth, that Dean thought just as highly of
Almost as soon as Papa's grace was out in the open, Dickie hopped down off of Adam's bed – where he had been napping – and raced over to jump up and down at Jess's feet. He was whining loudly and barking, as if he recognized the sight of Papa's grace too. Jessie bent down to pick up Dickie and hug him in her arms. Aww, poor little guy. He probably missed Papa too.
“In a spell just like this,” she answered, looking down at the devils trap on the ground, “The bastard caught me in the middle of a crossroads deal. And moved me to some kind of house... I remember the smell. Like flowers. He shot me full of heroin or something and... I don't remember much after that. Just an endless loop of sleep and no sleep. Not being able to move. Screaming. Begging... I was out for most of it... There were other demons too. Being used like me.”
“Seriously?!” Gabriel huffed, “Ew, this place is like Fear Factor on steroids! We've gotta get home!”
Dean, Cas, and Jude all looked to the entrance of the kitchen, where Gabriel wandered in with Sam, Jessica, and Dickie. The four of them looked around the kitchen in wonder, admiring all the furniture and cook wear.
“Remember to be like Batman, Daddy,” he almost whispered, holding both sides of Dean's face with his little hands.
“I... I don't know,” she squeaked, her arms shivering, “I was older... and it was all dark... I couldn't see anything... I asked for Daddy and Papa and you... but nobody could hear me...”
Gabriel didn't breathe a word. He actually wanted to hear how things went wrong from Heaven's point of view; the side he stopped looking from long ago. At the mention of Cas and Dean's names, Gabriel could feel Jude's small hand tightening around his arm with concern.
hearing Clarence say all of these things. The worst part was that none of it was true! Clarence wasn't trapped in a circle. He was free to be whoever he wanted to be! Jude pulled back just enough to take Clare's tear-stained face in his hands.
Castiel carefully rolled his head to the side, attempting to steal a peek at Dean without disturbing him. After what seemed like many hours and
Jude gulped, feeling so proud. It was so nice of Ollie's mom to get him something like this, even without ever knowing what his parents' real job was. After gently stashing the jacket back into the bag, Jude wrapped Ms. Jane into a giant hug.
Nothing seemed to happen. Jude timidly glanced around the park, silently scanning for curly dark hair, blue eyes, and a beard. But the only adults were those playing with their children. The lack of response drove Jude to grit his teeth again. His grace flared a little, creating small electric sparks between his fingers.
“Peaches? Really?” Gabe repeated, sounding confused, “Okay, if that's what you want. Let there be peaches!”
“Holy shit, Sammy, it’s really him. He’s here,” he heard Dean’s excited voice say before his face reappeared in Castiel’s vision. “Hey, Cas. It’s me. It’s Dean. C’mon, man, sit up.”
