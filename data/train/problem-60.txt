He must have been walking for ages. He had planned on getting a cab, but apparently he needed to walk. In fact, he had walked all the way to an intersection at Baker Street.
And so it begins. And it would be awkward, and there would be pain, but the sum of it all would be good. No, not good. It would be bloody
John shook himself from his rigid posture, becoming aware of the time, “Right, well… I’ve got to get to the clinic. It was nice to meet you, Curt,” - hand extended.
He unclasped his hands from behind his back. He was disconcerted to note that his palms were sweaty, and he had to work at keeping his breathing even. He approached John, and John stared not at Sherlock’s face but at Sherlock’s left hand.
John could not breathe.
“No, no. Of course, you’re right. Where are we going to eat, then?”
? You mean… you…
Sherlock Holmes spared not a second thought for the reunion ahead. He did not wonder how seeing Curt Wild would affect him. Why would seeing his First and only sexual partner affect him in the slightest? Nonsense. And so, he was woefully unprepared for the moment he stepped into the living room of 221B and came face to face with his former lover.
Her survival instinct kicked in.
John was laughing so hard, tears popped from the corners of his eyes. He clutched at his stomach.
Dr. Lennon looked up from the microscope. She was rarely disturbed in the lab. Something important must have come through. Perhaps a response to her grant request!
John hesitated at that, “Vacated? You mean the man died, don’t you?”
Just as the cab had pulled up, John had finally settled on simmering anger, a familiar and comfortable feeling for him. His default state any time his world upended.
Sherlock climbed the stairs and came to stand in the doorway at the top of the landing, ethereal eyes settling on John who was sitting on the coffee table. Sherlock’s dark hair was damp, slicked back out of his face. He had a duffel bag slung over his shoulder. It had been too warm a night for the Belstaff.
Their first kiss was not like any other kiss John had experienced at all.
John frowned, no longer looking at the man. He glared hard into his empty tumbler, beginning to seethe a bit.
Sherlock was out of the cab as soon as he could manage, leaving John to pay. But this time, John did not feel irritated. Something bad had happened, something personal.
There, that was easier. Anger was easier.
No, he didn’t know why Arthur would have committed suicide. He hadn’t known him personally. Not really.
With watery eyes, John stared at the phone only a moment before placing it on top of the fire. He pulled his hand away, feeling his skin burn a little from the heat. He watched the phone melt. He grabbed the poker from its stand and encouraged the progress of the phone’s destruction.
“Wrong,” Sherlock said.
“’Scuse me,” Curt muttered.
John had been unsettled by his flatmate’s random, nocturnal disappearances. He became concerned by it, the frequency of it and the refusal of Sherlock to supply a satisfactory explanation. It had been going on for almost two months now, even alongside cases.
He must have dozed off. Something woke him. The ice in the tumbler had melted. He had fallen asleep in the chair, glass sitting on his knee. John set the glass aside, and the electronic tittering sound that had woken him repeated in the stillness. The fire had banked down to a few, orange tongues of flame in a bed of scarlet embers.
He was on his knees in the bathroom again, dry heaving into the toilet.
“Can’t you, I dunno, just deduce it?”
******
“You… were hurt,” Sherlock swallowed the emotion that threatened to crumple his composure.
Sherlock stopped, spun, paced back within view of Mycroft who was sitting in the car, safe from the cold. His brother was leaning forward on his umbrella, hands folded over the wooden curve of its handle.
It was like there had been a pressure inside his head that had filled up with anger and nonsense. And with the touch of Sherlock’s lips, the pressure suddenly gave way, dissipated and John felt lightheaded.
Mycroft’s shrug reminded John of Sherlock. It was elegant, and it could mean anything or nothing, “It is not a position for those unaccustomed to… certain hazards.”
She performed her one-handed pour routine despite John’s muttered refusal, “No. No, thank you. -- Oh, well. Thanks.”
When John’s eyes met his, Sherlock’s thought process began to blink on and off, as if defaulting to archaic computer code, 1s and 0s.
He all but marched into the parlor, ready to… he did not know what. He spun to face John, only to find his friend asleep, barely upright on a drooping wrist. Sherlock took in a breath, and sat back down in his chair. He stared at John openly now, studied him. John’s mouth hung open a little, and he would probably drool before too much longer if his head didn’t nod him awake before then.
Now, as it was, Sherlock had no reason to leave. He wished that he could hide himself and John away from prying eyes.
“The what?” John blinked. The change of topic was too sudden. His mind was still a bit disconnected from the kiss.
“Sherlock, you’re dripping,” John pointed out.
In that cursory glance, John saw that his flatmate was on the far side of the table, his back to the entryway.
He stared at the small cardboard box sitting on the desk in the living room. Inside was a trash bag. In the trash bag was the smashed violin. He hadn’t had the heart to throw it away.
“Hmph,” he grunted in wonder at the realization, pocketing his phone as the cab made its meandering way to the clinic.
John stared at his phone a moment before the nurse came to notify him of his next patient.
“Yes, well,” he began, catching his breath, “The plan was to meet Lestrade here with the suspect, and I planned on doing it myself, but…” and he gestured to me as if that answered the point, “Feel better?” Sherlock asked with a horribly intimate smirk barely concealed behind his default mask of indifference.
Finally, their feet still gliding in tiny movements together, John said, “I’ll take it.”
I dare not look at his face. His stupid, beautiful face. Beautiful?
“You don’t mean rehab.” Sherlock put his own hands in the pockets of his crisply starched, black trousers. He wore his suit like armor, “You’ve met someone.”
The rest of the afternoon passed in companionable conversation and many, many cups of tea. Some leaves had traveled a long way, indeed. Sherlock spoke freely, and John did, too. They talked about all of the countries Sherlock had run through, flown through, driven through and a few places not even on a map.
His hand shook, and he sat down hard on the floor.
“Love you… so... fucking… much,” he declared as he punished that sweetness between Sherlock’s legs. He could see now, Sherlock’s erection bouncing in time with the thrusts. He saw Sherlock’s right arm flung above his head, hand braced against the headboard, counteracting the force of John’s passionate assault. Sherlock’s dark head of curls was limp on the pillow, and the tendrils stuck to his ears and face with perspiration.
Maybe Sherlock would like that, John thought.
Mrs. Hudson spoke softly, “Mycroft… well, John he’s paid for everything.”
John found himself leaning in a little, too, but resisted the urge to whisper. He stared at Jack.
John raised his eyebrows in rueful surprise, “Oh, you do?”
John visibly steadied himself, and he let Sherlock read whatever was written so plainly on his face.
“Thanks for dinner,” Curt’s smile softened.
Sherlock peeked up through his lashes, hearing the warmth in John’s voice. He met the doctor’s navy blue eyes, glittering with affection.
Sherlock’s ears perked at John's tremulous respirations, the shells of cartilage pinking along with his cheeks and throat. He let his hands hang elegantly at his sides, closing his eyes and cataloguing the feel of John Watson’s careful ministrations. He hadn’t let John see the scars, the evidence of his torturous escapades, until now.
The former army doctor stepped backward, back into the frame of the open door.
John berated himself a bit over the relief he felt at seeing Curt Wild disappear into the dark.
I went to blow the steam from my coffee, and turned to face the interior of the deli. Sherlock’s gaze moved from the street to me, his nose still pink from the cold, his hair a touch wild from the chase. He had left the scarf untied around his neck. I dare not look there. His long neck! I wanted to lick it. The smell of the coffee made my stomach tighten. At least, I think it was the coffee.
, John thought to himself.
He narrowed his eyes, “What of the claim?”
Other than the physical heat, there was no excitement and there was no sexual feeling, per se.
John huffed, crossed his arms as he half-turned to Sherlock with an incredulous look on his expressive face, “Of course you were.”
“But?” Sherlock put his hands in his pockets, glancing now to the bodies.
And there she was at the back of the store, arranging a row of expensive looking floral arrangements on the service counter. She was dressed flatteringly in black and yellow. She complimented the sparse decorations that adorned the main display area. It looked like someone had rented out the place. He saw now, in the window, a sign that said the shop could indeed be reserved for special occasions.
“She’s gone!” Lestrade exclaimed.
“Deserve better?” Sherlock mimicked in response. He made an “ugh” sound and declared, “Boring.” -- with a wave of his hand. Sherlock went to find the jar that held John’s favorite tea blend.
“Where’d they send you?”
Curious and daring, Curt flicked his talented tongue across the slit, and gave a small suckle to the bulbous tip.
Jack finished off his beer with a satisfied smack of his lips and a thunk of the beer bottle on the counter top. He turned fully to John now, right side of his body leaning against the bar, “So, what’d you do in the army?”
“I have no idea what’s gotten into him,” Sherlock said in a rush, looking away and around, anywhere but Curt.
They were tears of Relief, Trust and Need.
It did not take long for Dr. Jacqui Lennon to perform her tests.
Before John could put his phone away, it rang. Not good.
A kind voice interrupted his introspection, “Here. Some water for you.”
“Love you, too,” he whispered, tamping down the emotion that welled beneath the utterance of these words. Come back to me, he thought shamelessly, though did not say aloud. He had already said enough.
There was a voice, strangely familiar, in the background of the call. John strained to hear it, perhaps identify it. It was a male voice, distant.
Others dove to the ground and covered their heads.
The flinted steel in Mycroft’s eyes seemed to succumb to something very close to emotion. Regret, perhaps?
John growled to himself.
“A man’s voice you recognized?”
, but something unnerved him. He found himself thinking of a scene from one of his favorite action movies,
A thoughtful energy suddenly took the place of his anger.
John looked up, accepting the cup with a surge of regret, “I’m sorry. Thank you.”
He realized a bit late that his jaw had dropped, and he promptly swallowed it closed. A hard bulb of terror and thrill stuck in the cricoid rings of his trachea. There grew a gravid expanse of possibility between himself and his best friend.
John hadn’t cared how he’d done it, faked his death right in front of him. John hadn’t asked where he’d gone or for any details of his Work. None of that apparently mattered to John. John had only cared about one thing, the Betrayal.
John smiled as if seeing right through the act, “Is he fit?”
Jack sipped at his beer, watching John closely, “Never worth it.”
“You know I did. Games do not become you. And I need no thanks.”
“How would I know?” Sherlock grumped, though he didn’t seem mad at John. He still held his hand as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
It was a pleasant smell, a productive smell. John cleared his throat.
He glowered and strode purposefully away from the car, toward the shuttle that would take him to the train station. The car followed.
“Well, I do,” Sherlock seemed, in that instant, to be utterly sure of himself.
Sherlock shrugged, raised his chin back from his chest as if to deny the jittery feeling blossoming in his gut. He turned partially away from John to hide his reaction. He stared at the empty hearth, “It all comes down to muscle control, really. Of course, technique, discipline, and spatial awareness play a big role in execution. But, really, I just love it.”
Well, maybe it was warm. Or hot, rather.
The space was dim, and derelict. On each side, he could just make out a handful of unmarked doors, adorned only with rusted latches. There were no knobs on the doors, no means of access. And the dust! Dust was eloquent, alright, and here in this lost, non-descript corridor, there were undisturbed swaths of it.
Sherlock stared at John’s naked toes. They wiggled every now and then during their conversation. When they did, Sherlock assessed John’s expression to see any kind of correlation. The conversation had been steadily thinning, silences protracting at a comfortable rate until now. There was something so very unguarded about John at that moment. Sherlock could not find a memory of John ever being so relaxed, and certainly had never experienced the full weight of this particular expression.
I turned to face him with a half-hearted quip but the smartarse remark died on my lips as I saw Sherlock, topless and slightly damp from the shower. He wore low-slung pajama pants, the comfy ones that seemed to be made of threadbare cotton. The pajama bottoms were so low that the angles of his pelvis were exposed.
As long as it was in her, she could not Step.
Sherlock was motionless save for his breathing.
Curt watched the exchange in silence.
John came to stand within Sherlock’s personal space, head cocked slightly to the side. He looked up from Sherlock’s exposed clavicle, up the naked throat where John saw Sherlock swallow hard, those full, pink lips, and then the dazzling silver green of Sherlock’s wary eyes.
As for Sherlock, he stood two steps away in the common area of the flat. The glow of the hearth, the kitchen and the lamp by the couch gilded him in eerie light, ethereal. His long fingers fluttered expertly over the buttons of his shirt, dislodging the round disks from their slits.
John was suddenly very interested. There had been rumors, and he thought a letter had been declassified some years ago. He never read it, too busy running about London with his maniac flatmate. He did not want to think about Sherlock at all.
“If you must,” Sherlock said in a longsuffering way, as if he bore some great burden because of John’s curtesy of others.
“I have better things to do than to cater to your paranoia. The fact that your grip on reality is precarious at best? Well, that warrants its own considerations, does it not?”
Curt’s calloused fingers wrapped around the detective's spit-slicked length, and gave a single, twisting stroke before tucking Sherlock back into his black trousers.
Curt was talking. Sherlock had missed some of it. As he surfaced, his awareness caught the tail end of a sentence.
“Look no further, John,” Sherlock intoned, a spooky look filling his eyes. They seemed to be lit from within. Sherlock held the violin straight out to him, as if offering it for inspection. He cocked his head to the side, willing John to look closer at the beloved instrument.
Curt glanced to John, and then back to Sherlock. Without a word, he stepped away and then around the table.
John shook his head slowly, wiping at the marveling expression that must have showed on his face, “You were the man I bumped into.”
Remembered images of the dance he had witnessed emboldened him. The surreal experience now informed his choice to go forward with an experiment of his own. Sherlock had basically said that he had performed the dance for him, for John. John’s utter disbelief and shock was rapidly being replaced with a heady awareness of Sherlock’s elusive sexuality being directed at him. Of all people, Sherlock had chosen John. Wonder of wonders!
“It’s a fake?” he asked in a voice that was hushed and full of an emotion he had yet to understand.
“Cheers, John!” Jack saluted with his beer, and John saluted half-heartedly with his whiskey.
John had many first kisses. Some better than others, of course, but they all shared similar qualities. Warm. Sexual. Thrilling.
“Who was?” John was snapped back into the moment by Lestrade’s statement.
When Sherlock felt a reciprocating caress of foot, he debated whether or not to even acknowledge it. For a while, they sat in near silence. The crackle and pop of the fire highlighted their newborn intimacy.  Languidly and with heavily lidded eyes, Sherlock finally raised his head and met John’s gaze. It was dark and dreamy, like a man secure in the thought that he had everything he could ever need and then some.
“Sherlock,” John called.
John groaned softly, placing his palms to his temples, “What happened?”
They took seats in the living area, and Curt filled Sherlock in on the investigation that Arthur had led into the disappearance of Brian Slade, that he had been the one to make the connections with Tommy Stone. Sherlock rolled his eyes and supplied an indolent remark. Of course Sherlock had known who Brian Slade had become! The mystery had rated a three, at best.
He trusted John to take care of him. Utterly.
He was waiting on a file he had requested a few days prior. The file would contain every available piece of data on a dead journalist, Arthur Stuart. Stuart had committed suicide two weeks ago.
Curt kind of froze at that. He seemed to be seeing something Sherlock could not. Curt gave a single, sharp nod.
John thought about going to the gym. He’d already been that morning, and after almost five months of daily training, John found himself in better shape than he had been while serving in the army. Pent up sexual frustration did that to a man like Three Continents Watson.
Still no response.
Lestrade pushed the pillow off of his head, and propped himself up on his elbows, belly down on the large bed. He watched Mycroft for his reaction.
It was a little over a week later that John packed his things for moving. He had to leave Baker Street. He had not hallucinated again. The fear that he would see the apparition was laced with the sad desire for its return. The experience had changed something for John, had forced him to acknowledge how much Sherlock’s loss had really affected him. That acceptance had been paramount to climbing his way out of the abyss.
Sherlock shook his head once as if to deny this statement, as if to discharge himself from the moment.
Sherlock seemed to be staring right into him, unsettlingly still and intense.
“You were in bad shape,” Anderson supplied.
Sherlock growled softly in response to his own question, seemingly unaware of what he was doing. He minutely ground his hips into Curt. Sherlock’s lips parted as he felt increasingly out of breath, images and sensations flooded him beyond his control. He tilted his head back at the alien pleasure, at the memory of it all.
John’s text alert sounded, breaking the spell. Speak of the devil.
John frowned, felt his throat go tight.
Curt took the doctor’s hand in his, giving a short nod in farewell, “Yeah, same here.”
Sherlock turned to him, his arm still outstretched to hail a cab. He saw the coat shoved at him, nodded and put it on.
“Another game?” John queried, trying for cold but knowing he came across as bitter and angry.
Curt then told Sherlock of his meeting with Arthur at a bar some years ago.
John knew it was a ridiculous scenario, but they lived a ridiculous life.
“Nope,” he heard himself say. He clutched at the sides of his head. Note in one hand, violin shard in the other, “No, don’t do this.”
It was only then that John looked at the taller man, attention moving instantly to Sherlock’s long back, hash marked with scars. John felt a powerful emotion wash through him, and he began to shake a little. He stepped closer to his friend, the mad man who had captivated his imagination, his life, and for pity’s sake, the wildling before him had claimed John’s heart as well.
These memories were intrusive, and unwelcome! He pushed it away with an aggravated grumble. He needed a shower. And he needed to get dressed. Curt would be here by noon.
“I remember everything,” Sherlock said in a low voice, his platinum-green eyes taking in every detail of his former lover’s face, flashbacks superimposing themselves over the reality of the moment.
In that moment, the entire street was blanketed in complete, white fury.
John stared for a second before recovering, “Sherlock’s not here. I don’t really know, um…”
Mrs. Hudson rejoined them after putting the kettle on, “It’s been, what? Oh, dear! Six years now?”
I smiled fleetingly in wonder. He looked down at my hand, and then into my eyes. His pupils widened even as I watched, his jaw clenched. He was definitely turned on, but he was also… scared?
Sherlock frowned, arched a brow, but did as he was told.
John pressed on despite the interruption, not able to look directly at Sherlock just yet, “It was while you were gone, while you were… you know, dead.”
Sherlock had been holding some strange, fleshy looking thing in the pincers of stainless steel tongs. The thing was indeed beginning to ooze and drip.
Sherlock considered, took a breath, looked around them, registering the scene that encapsulated them.
He’d never been in a long term relationship, hadn’t understood really what drove a man to unending monogamy. That is, until now. John didn’t want to see anyone in his bed but the world’s only consulting detective. His thoughts skirted the details of what that meant. He had vague notions of what he’d like, mostly conjured up, broken images of his pale friend all sweaty and gasping. Other than that, he tried not to think of it.
Lestrade glared at Sherlock, then at me, then back to Sherlock, “First case in weeks, you couldn’t have taken it a bit easy.”
Shockingly enough, the need for reassurance seemed to be a mutual phenomenon. Last night proved as much to John. His eyes unfocused on the present reality of the cab ride as he recalled the look on Sherlock’s face from the night before.
Sherlock stood stock still, staring at one of the two dead bodies before him.
“See what, EXACTLY?!”
Curt filled his lungs before deep throating, once, twice, and humming with the pleasure that coursed through him. He sucked hard, unrelenting, moaning through it all. The vibration of the hum coupled with the tightness of Curt's accomodating esophagus forced Sherlock to put most of his weight on the table, leaning against it heavily. The table creaked. His legs were jelly, his cock was molten Need.
John and Lestrade followed.
Curt felt a bit awkward standing there in the unfamiliar living room.
For an answer, Sherlock arched his brows and then gestured silently with both hands to his entire, recumbent form. The gesture said,
“Yeah,” Lestrade’s surprise grew, painted obvious on his face.
John’s eyes rounded like saucers when he saw the blonde musician rise into view. His straight, bleached blonde hair was a mess. His lips were wet and swollen. His chin was shiny with spittle and… and…
*********************************
Problem: Results of experiments, inconclusive.
But there were some things best left unsaid.
Sherlock had a mouthful of food, and swallowed it hurriedly.
John then looked to Sherlock, considered a second, and then looked right at Curt, “Did you clean it?”
Truth be told, Sherlock’s body heat next to him had been a kind of honest, unfiltered reassurance he simply could not deny himself. He hadn’t the strength to resist. He waited for the discomfort or embarrassment to rise within him over this realization, but it never came. In its stead, a sad kind of quiet wonder burgeoned, some alien sense of gravidity.
And a whole, weird life seemed to stretch before them in his mind.
, he thought fiercely but did not say.
Sherlock was staring at the front of the hotel. He seemed to speak as if from a great distance, “You will find that the woman, the shooter, was the former manager of Tommy Stone. I believe Tommy Stone may have suffered a similar fate as… Curt Wild.”
The detective inspector jogged to the other uniformed police, issuing orders to search for Hoija.
“May I?” she asked as she approached, and he realized that he was still clinging to the box.
“Well, just for the season, recording that album, and I’d moved in with Jack... Jack Fairy,” he added for John’s benefit.
Distraction: John had not yet replied.
Sherlock’s surprised inhalation was enough to draw a smile from John.
He could imagine the stunned look on John’s face at this unprecedented text. He stifled a smile.
Point of consideration: John was fairly obvious when addressing Sherlock’s shortcomings.
He was standing alone in silence, staring into a small, neglected hallway, somewhere in the bowels of his palace, near memories of food, sleep, adolescence and childhood.
The quasi-lit audience section flashed with blue light three times before going absolutely black. Only the exit signs could be seen.
Sherlock stood and stretched, joints popping. He yawned and mussed his hair with his hands. It felt good to scratch his scalp. It happened to be a sensitive spot for him. A memory of Curt’s hands fisted in his curls made him give pause.
“Did we…?” John had to ask. He had to know.
John looked defiant and aggressive.
When Sherlock had texted him his arrival time, he had been flabbergasted. Of course, his ETA wouldn’t have been accurate.
Sherlock looked at it, the corners of his mouth turning up very slightly. He placed his hand in John’s firm, warm grasp. They both watched the hands fold together, and then matched each other’s gazes with tender affection and unabashed, primal curiosity.
“Thank you very much for your time, Dr. Lennon.”
John covered his mouth and the phone with his other hand, staring at Sherlock’s chair, “Right.”
Even as a virgin, Sherlock had been freakishly adept, and had only improved with practice.
John reached out a hand and touched the back of his fingers to Sherlock’s mouth.
John stepped up beside Sherlock, speaking in low tones to Hoija, “Look, I know you were close to Curt, but the woman deserved a trial.”
Mrs. Hudson hadn’t noticed the absence of Sherlock’s violin. John had hidden the evidence in his closet, and had only taken it out today. He still wasn’t sure what to do with it. He felt like he was hiding the body of a murder victim, which was silly, but he couldn’t help the lead feeling of guilt in is gut.
Sherlock looked down at his own hands as he placed thumbs and forefingers at the fastening of his trousers. Pop went the button, followed unceremoniously by the slip of the fly, allowing the corners of the black trousers to feather open.
It was Anderson!
The medics were busy checking on panicked bystanders, the police even more so, trying to regain control of the crime scene.
John sat up straight. He had been prepared for just about anything but that. “But we weren’t involved in Vietnam.”
He had not an ounce of fat on him, but he had thickened up a bit. It seemed he had actually been eating more lately. It looked good on him, less bone, more healthy. And for once, I could acknowledge to myself that my admiration of his physique was not purely clinical or aesthetic. It was because it was Sherlock.
“Hoo-hoo,” called Ms. Hudson as she popped into the flat, carrying two gift bags, one in each hand, “Oh, dear.”
“I will spend my life making this up to you,” Sherlock vowed in meaningful tones.
How much time passed, John could not be sure. He sat in an antique chair, soft with fine upholstery and studded with rare detail. John’s hands covered his face as he leaned forward, elbows on his knees.
The veteran stared meaningfully, “That’s the official story.”
The remnants of Sherlock’s baritone voice, the exhalations from his lover with each pronounced intrusion, spun John’s straining grip on reality.
Sherlock put his hands behind his back as if he didn’t know what to do with them.
, John repeated in his head, and he may have said it aloud a few times, too. The hairs all over his body stood on end. The van had not exploded, not like it would have in the movies. It just sat there and smoldered.
“Sherlock,” John gasped in a hushed voice as he dashed up the stairs in a matter of three seconds. He whirled around the banister and climbed until the bright, happy rectangle of the parlor’s open door came into view. The music stopped.
“John… I do, too… love you… love this. Only you…”
Sherlock’s phone chimed. He pulled it out, and stared at the screen.
“Was she an assassin or something? Or MI6?” John asked, more concerned for his friend than for the mystery.
"I couldn't sleep," the forensics flunky (as Sherlock had once called him) answered in a less than pretentious tone. He actually sounded... quite subdued, "You going home alone?"
“You knew I was there,” John stated flatly.
Sherlock felt like he was on the edge of a cliff, looking over, experiencing that strange pull-push vertigo that had him rocking back on his heels.
Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath, and froze. The sound of his own heartbeat had him dizzy and catatonic.
There was an ambulance with its lights on, too, with the rear doors shut. Police in rain coats kept the meager group of onlookers back. Even a monsoon couldn’t tamp the morbid curiosity of humankind.
A text came from Curt, saying he was at the flat and catching up with “Hudders”.
“It’s like old times.”
But sometimes… sometimes they caught each other staring, their eyes locked across the room, across the cab, or across a corpse. It was then that the Great Unnamable Thing would pulse between them like an electrical artery, fleetingly exposed, insistent and painful. Distracting. Frustrating.
John looked up, touched a lapel of Sherlock’s dressing gown, and peered into Sherlock’s gaze with such a force of will as to secure every iota of Sherlock's considerable attention, “You will just live, okay? Just be Sherlock Holmes, the best and wisest man I have ever known. That is all you will do, and with me there, too, damnit.”
Such characteristic honesty pleased Sherlock to no end, and he relished how wide John’s eyes went when he deftly maneuvered the tailored shirt from his shoulders and let the fine fabric drop to the carpet behind him. There poised a shirtless Sherlock Holmes, his mercurial eyes sparkling with amusement at John’s rapid, shallow respirations.
As for John and Sherlock, the Mystery of the Great Unnamable Thing had been solved. They became a cohesive unit once more. An ease returned between them that had been missing since the Reichenbach fall.
He sat low in his red chair, hand curled loosely around an empty tea cup perched on his thigh. He put his other elbow on the arm of chair, and propped his head in his palm. His bare ankles were crossed, legs extended before him.
Curt looked back, annoyingly at ease. The American slurped the second half of a noodle into his mouth.
For some reason, John felt there was a lot more that Mycroft was not telling him. But that wasn’t anything new. John cocked his head the side, realization hitting him with full force, and disbelief blossoming on his face, “You’re serious.”
“Where are we?” John asked again.
John frowned and pushed his lips to Sherlock’s forehead, a hand wrapping around the back of Sherlock’s neck as if to hold him in place.
“You’ve known. You must have known,” Sherlock insisted.
I spied the exposed part of his neck, remembered the warmth of it. I saw the pulse there, and it mesmerized me. I stared at it. I absently noticed my breathing go shallow.
Holy hell! Sherlock had all but admitted it to him just now.
“I’ll take care of him,” John said, “Thanks. And good luck.”
John turned on his heel, and strode away, shoulders hunched. He was filled to the brim with an energy that seemed to crackle about him. He had to move or he would explode with it.
Sherlock did not move.
When Mycroft had detailed John’s hallucinations to him, he could hardly believe it. It meant something to Sherlock, that losing Sherlock had been so very… disruptive for John. Sherlock closed his eyes and bowed his head. He was out of his depth. The impulse to hide alarmed him, and he answered it by straightening his spine, straightening his dressing gown and squaring his jaw. He would address this right now.
“What… are you doing, John?” his words came out sounding absurdly breathless. This lack of vocal control aggravated Sherlock. That, coupled with the line of heat radiating off of John in their close proximity, made Sherlock’s blush deepen.
John understood, fully. Sherlock had danced because he could not otherwise communicate any of this. Sherlock had presented himself for John’s benefit, had exposed his request the only way he knew how. It was a simple request:
Sherlock stopped.
“As in… romantically, just so we’re clear,” Sherlock rushed to amend his declaration in the building silence.
John did his level best to keep his thoughts hidden.
Anderson stared.
The other body was a petite woman, caucasian. A gun lay near her on the ground. She, too, was face up. Her eyes were closed, though, and her mouth was open wide as if she had died while screaming. It seemed the back of her head was missing, as if it had been bashed into the pavement.
John thought that perhaps this time Jack was talking to Julie. He clutched his phone in his hand, and at the extended silence, John grunted noncommittally.
John thought it’d been a bomb. Most people had, but it had just been a lightning bolt striking close.
Curt witnessed Sherlock’s normally aloof orbs ignite with carnal promise.
Sherlock’s face remained impassive. He could now meet Curt’s steel gray eyes.
“Sorry. What?”
“Surgeon,” John answered. He did not want to stew over his reasons for being here, and was glad for the change in subject. He glanced at Jack as he said it.
“Oh!” Sherlock’s hands dropped to his sides as if his strings had been cut.
“’S whatever you want,” John murmured.
John would take off of work as soon as there was a lull. He’d been lucky that it was a slow day. He couldn’t really justify leaving early if it had been busy. Sherlock was a grown man, after all.
Sherlock stood alone, unmoving in their small kitchen.
He was going to puke. He practically fell out of bed in his haste, tripping over shoes and linens on his way to the toilet. He didn’t have time to shut the door. He collapsed to his knees just in time, head buried in the porcelain throne as his stomach betrayed him.
John knew Sherlock well, and this new development… the dance… seemed to slot the last piece of the Sherlock puzzle into place. For once, John knew precisely what he wanted and that he could possibly, actually get it.
Time had actually been kind to the rock star, even if he hadn’t been kind to himself. He had aged well, possibly more handsome than he had ever been in youth. A sense of hard won self-possession was on display where an angst-ridden restlessness had once been.
“Oh, he had help,” Sherlock added as he disappeared into the kitchen. I carefully crept further into the mess.
The images of that potentiality played unbidden across his mind’s eye.
He took a large, calming gulp of the cold water. He swallowed the trembling with it.
John acquiesced and held Sherlock’s hands then, squeezing them as a sweeping sense of tragedy disturbed his euphoria. John felt like he was going to choke, or sink through the floor and into the earth. Or both.
“I can’t pretend,” Sherlock said, and the words scorched me.
“Guilt?! You have a damned funny way of showing it.”
Anderson’s nervous, reedy voice was already grating on John’s raw nerves. The Yarder was fully dressed, standing now in front of the sofa. A long, black trench coat was laid over the arm of the sofa.
His erection was freed, after a tug of his pants let the length of it pop out, tapping Curt on the nose. Curt grinned fleetingly. The smile dissolved as he smelled Sherlock’s sweat and pre-cum, an earthy aroma coupled with the expensive soaps Sherlock used.
“John! Save me!” Sherlock crowed.
“Oh, I nearly forgot!” he finally declared, and was bounding up the stairs.
He blinked and breathed, and the pale, striking face of his friend superimposed itself over reality.
for him. Like,
It was in that quivering second that the end of an arrow seemed to sprout from under her rib cage, the arrowhead buried deep between her lungs, nicking the apex of her heart. She stared down at the black and bluish feathers at the end of the arrow’s aluminum shaft.
Slowly, he allowed a smile, and bumped Mycroft’s shoulder with his own, “Does that mean we get to double date?”
Through all of this, Sherlock was quiet and still, accepting. His eyes were closed, his respirations even and controlled until, finally, with a suspended breath between them, their lips met.
“Julie!” Jack called, apparently to the bartender. She looked up with blank eyes, “Another glass of liquid courage for my friend!”
“It is a reproduction, a high quality reproduction, but a reproduction nonetheless…” she informed, trying to gauge his reaction.
“Alright,” John responded, “I’ll let him know.”
Why was John so very nervous?
Curt turned to give the cab a signal. The black car pulled away into traffic.
“Will you not finish what you started?” Sherlock pursued in an imperious voice kept hushed by the uncertainty racing through his nervous system. His blood still boiled, shirtless John in his mind was crowding his reasoning.
“Alright,” John answered, sweeping his thumb across Sherlock’s lower lip.
He answered her simply that he would assure its place with the rightful owner.
John laughed his arse off while Sherlock suffered the wrath of his powerful mind.
Very close.
John’s breath seemed to leave him, and he felt the anger rise anew within him.
He had moved out of 221B, of course. John could not have withstood these past months living among Sherlock’s things. Plus, if he had stayed, it would have looked too much like he was waiting for Sherlock to return from the dead.
“It’s our future, Deb!” the older woman all but squealed. Dr. Lennon held up the green pendant to the light, and whispered through a super-sized grin, “It’s... Everything.”
“Yeah.”
He felt strange, like a panic attack was upon him. Reality careened around him, the memory of Shaun wrenched away. Flickers and flashes of Sherlock played like a parody of a primary school flip book. This was wrong.
John was further surprised to see the same, overjoyed expression blossom on Curt’s face as he exclaimed, “Hudders!?”
Mycroft seemed to go utterly still, as if his life-force had vacated for the moment. John held his breath.
There hung between them a gravid sense of possibility and a terrible, debilitating heat.
Some people screamed and ran.
Sherlock was at a loss on how to Deal with the Great Unnamable Thing. He could not seem to stop himself, though. He continued to surreptitiously watch John, as if the good doctor may wind up being only an apparition of Sherlock’s making, as if Sherlock were still bound in ropes somewhere far away, dreaming of his own, private Shangri-La where John Watson was forever ensconced at his side.
Sherlock pushed on nonetheless, “But, John, tell me you love me.”
In a quiet span of mere seconds, with their gazes latched together, they came to a strange understanding.
Curt’s smiles came easily to him these days, and he smiled now at John’s probing, “No, she’s a friend.”
What was happening?! John seemed content to wait, the line of heat building between them. Sherlock felt he was sweating beneath his clothes even as a shiver travelled through him.
“Parkour?!” Lestrade exclaimed, almost laughing.
John could hear his blood go whoosh-whoosh in his ears.
Sherlock buried his face in the bend of his arm, on the edge of the bed, and fought the urge to scream.
I had to look away.
“So, what are you trying to tell me…
Sherlock distanced himself to stand near the end of John’s bed.
“Arthur Stuart,” he blurted, his voice loud in the silence. His quicksilver orbs did not alight again upon Curt. Instead, he divested himself of his coat and scarf with appropriate speed, none too hasty as to be sloppy and none too slowly as to be forced. Natural. Right.
After the news broke, Tommy Stone had all but disappeared from the pubic eye. In fact, no one really knew where the rock star was anymore. Curt surmised that he was probably in hiding, perhaps plotting some new identity with his rabid sycophant of a manager in order to take over the world yet again.
John shook his head once, “Okay, it’s gettin’ a bit scary now.”
Mrs. Hudson was at the top of the stairs. He rushed to the hall, catching her just as she headed into the parlor.
“How long?” I asked.
John brushed his pinky across Sherlock’s limp hand, skin moist and wrinkled from being wet for so long. He wrapped his hand firmly around Sherlock’s, giving the unresponsive hand a squeeze.
This text was a bit off. He re-read and mulled it over. Finally, John recognized the discrepancy. This was Sherlock’s way of addressing Feelings.
Curt started to stand, forcing Sherlock to release his hold on his hair. He remained close when he stood.
Sherlock’s abdominals contracted sharply at the abrupt heat and suction, all thought obliterated as if a bomb had gone off in his mind palace.
“You could have picked this stuff up on your own,” John complained, holding the two, white sacks of food in two white-knuckled fists.
John swallowed. His legs felt like jelly. While keeping an eye on Sherlock, he shifted to sit on the coffee table in front of the sofa.
Sherlock was already headed for the coat tree by the door.
John reached to make the handshake work, “John.”
Only a case would bring Sherlock here, John told himself. As fond as Sherlock was of certain live music and theater, John just could not reconcile Sherlock’s personal interest in a staged review of scantily clad, multi-cultural performers.
Curt moaned as he nearly came on the spot. Breath play had been his favorite kink with Sherlock. He wanted more, much more. All of it. Now.
John’s perception of time snapped into hyper-focus, and the following seconds seemed to run like molasses.
There was a bump of teeth and artless kissing before John forced them a few centimeters apart, “No one hears about this, yeah?”
Unfortunately, John’s experience as a doctor made him painfully aware of the trauma that would have been required to make these marks so violent and large, even after all this time to heal. John leaned forward and placed a small kiss on one scar before he even recognized the impulse to do it. The act startled him more than it did Sherlock.
“I love you,” I blurted, staring at his nipples. His nipples? I tried to meet his eyes, but succeeded only briefly before staring down at my feet.
Through the trips to the kitchen, and the loo, and to get a blanket, they had somehow ended up close enough that their bodies were in constant contact. John had found the warmth and peace of the flat comforting, a comfort he was coming to Crave.
And he most certainly knew what he didn’t want.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow, but did not remark on John’s odd behavior, “Your landlady informed me of your departure.”
John’s blood was still up, making his skin feel tight and hot. He turned back to Sherlock’s chair. Sherlock, of course, was not there. John looked back to Mycroft as if he, too, would vanish. He was still there.
His worry increased when his friend did not immediately respond. He was used to being ignored, but why was Sherlock breathing so hard and covered in sweat?
"AND... And you know what?! Mrs. Hudson... is gone... TO HER SISTER'S!" John kicked the door of the gift shop repeatedly. A light came on upstairs.
It took John a moment or two to realize his text alert had chimed again.
Curt must mean Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock must have deleted the nickname. He texted back that he would join them shortly.
“You like it,” Greg pointed out with a smirk, making his own deduction, finding himself sinking into his lover’s dark gaze. Mycroft’s inner world was so painfully open now, bared for Greg alone. A precious gift, Greg knew, this intimacy, this vulnerability.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth flickered upward, and he met his landlady’s concerned eyes, “Send the workers in, if you would, please.”
True enough, too, was that he had not considered the possibility that this could all be a ruse. Why not? That answer was a simple one. He knew Curt Wild. John thought they had just done drugs together. John didn’t know how close the two men had really been.
like old times,” John corrected, though his doubt skittered across his mind, “Not sure what I’m doing with all of this… you know, new…” And there his vocabulary failed him.
“Sherlock?” came a voice that jarred the detective so soundly that he nearly staggered in place.

John’s memory began to melt together, solidifying into something that shocked him senseless. He had called Anderson by Sherlock’s name! His skin suddenly burned hot in mortification. Anderson had stroked him off. John had passed out, calling for Sherlock.
“Oh, hell,” I responded smartly, and prepared to tackle the man who was chasing my best friend across London.
John, Sherlock and Lestrade stood, knees and elbows the worse for the wear.
Detective Inspector Lestrade rounded the corner just then. Mycroft caught sight of him, watching him probably closer than strictly necessary.
There were four people in the bar now, including John. It was, after all, early afternoon on a week day. There was an old man on a tall, straight-backed chair, cane propped against the stool to his right. There was a barrel-shaped man asleep in a corner booth, close to the restrooms and the digital juke box.
“That was John leaving, wasn’t it?” Curt asked instead.
Sherlock straightened from his careful assortment of…
John dared not breathe too hard.
*********************************
“Fine. Terrific. I wasn’t sulking,” I replied with a sniff and a convenient look away at the supine perpetrator. I could not deny the megrims had lifted from my heart, and now I felt weirdly welcomed, if a little awkward. I chanced a glance at my friend’s now smug face. He regarded me with a warmth that made my ears burn and my mind flip-flop. The police cruiser and unmarked car pulled up to the kerb at Speedy’s, rescuing me from the rapid and unexpected shift of emotion within me. What the bloody hell?
John had no idea how Sherlock had done it, the deduction. He felt out of his depth. He looked right up at the building, saw curtains blowing out of a room on an upper story. The sixth floor? John’s jaw dropped a bit at that. He shot a befuddled gaze at the woman he now knew as Hoija.
He reached out to smooth John’s hair because that’s what people do on these occasions, right? He still held John’s hand. It flexed sporadically in his grasp.
“Absolute garbage, really the most uninspiring stuff.”
In the parlor, there were a few small pieces John had missed. One disembodied tuning peg lay on the floor, hidden by a pile of magazines. Next to it lay a folded note that had been waiting inside the body of the violin. On the paper, in a black, spidery script, it said:
John reached out to let his palm hover over the scars. Sherlock sensed the movement, stilled, waited.
“I found your note.”
Sherlock scooted his feet closer to John’s until his pinky toe grazed the soft skin of John’s foot. He looked back up to John’s eyes, making sure they were still closed. They were.
“Replace me?”
Mycroft looked Sherlock over, approving of his healthy weight gain. He decidedly did not verbalize this observation. He retrieved his own phone, and proceeded to see to his more mundane affairs. He would allow Sherlock his privacy, for the moment.
John’s body still shook with silent laughter, “So sorry, love.”
She shook her head and tutted at the mess. She was peppered with snow about her shoulders. It was just starting to melt. I looked around for Sherlock but he had disappeared for the moment. I looked back at the elephant, and stared.
First, it had been the Great Unnamable Thing. Then, Curt Wild’s return had stirred in him all kinds of detestable sentiment. The onslaught was taking its toll on his willingness to be remotely civilized. He even resented the idea of getting dressed if John happened to be around.
My lips still tingled from the kisses.
Curt's mouth still watered despite their predicament at being caught. A large part of him resented the idea of stopping. Sherlock, after all, had made no indication that he had wanted Curt to stop.
I licked my lips before placing both my hands at his flanks, sliding them down and around his lower back. I pulled us together, from navel to thigh.
“Of course I do. I am going to make us tea. I brought some from Kyrgyzstan. I have been wanting to try it.”
“Ooh,” Sherlock pivoted and marched back into the recesses of the kitchen.
Long ago, in another life, the soon-to-be great detective had deduced Curt’s need to be dominated and had wielded the information with spectacular aplomb.
Sherlock’s eyes followed him out. He snapped himself back to reality when Curt spoke again.
And his hair was dark with loose waves, still damp from the shower he’d had not an hour ago.
John cleared his throat, and asked with forced neutrality, “So, when did you get in?”
Sherlock opened his eyes abruptly and faced Curt with such speed that the blonde jumped back and hit the counter behind him.
“Yes,” John hissed. He took a deep breath and stared at that haughty face, hated it. Hate would not get him answers, though. He let go of his rage with his exhalation. He unfurled his hands with great effort, "We need to talk... please.”
to be tested.
Sherlock seemed to weigh John’s words. He had not considered Curt’s potential emotional vulnerability. He had to be pretty damned affected.
Sherlock stood before the burning hearth in the flat at 221B Baker Street. He was dressed in proper clothes for the first time in weeks, a look of fierce determination had taken over his angular features as he watched the flames.
Anderson amended, “Not exactly.”
Sherlock was staring at Curt’s covered body, appearing spell bound, as if the percussion and proximity of the electrical discharge had reset his circuits to skinless grief.
“He was my first,” Sherlock confessed, stripped of pretense, raw with the Need.
Despite the mute discomfiture, their need to remain in eachother’s lives was as strong as ever. Much to John’s chagrin, their attachment had become almost one of desperation. It was most evident during those times between cases when Sherlock was unoccupied with the Work, when he and John just happened to be at 221B in simultaneous doldrums.
What the hell was happening to him? Was he about to hyperventilate? He started in a quick march, the stretch of the strides felt good. But it wasn’t enough. He broke into a jog, grateful for the lack of people out in the cold. The great gulps of frigid air were put to use as his leg muscles pumped. He ran and ran until, finally, he felt like walking.
Lestrade closed his umbrella with a wet-sounding
John quickly interjected, fork still hung in the air between the plate and his mouth, “Her lab’s nearly an hour away. How long will her tests take?”
“She?” eyebrows bouncing up once and then down, “Indeed.”
Jack laughed mirthlessly. It was a rough sound.
John shrugged even though he knew Mycroft could not see him, “Just that they lived together, did drugs together.”
She huffed in disbelief. He smiled minutely despite himself, turning to her with rare warmth. “When he does, we’ll be ready,” he said as he placed his hands on her arms and squeezed.
“Sherlock, there are men here with a big crate! Say you’ve special ordered… something. What are you doing?!” Mrs. Hudson paused in the living room.
John stood in 221B Baker street, watching the fire grow. He stood before the hearth, trying to parse through his situation.
I braced myself for the very real possibility that this would be our last holiday spent as friends.
He slid his thumb over the pendant inside its little, plastic bag. It was not a seriously engaging mystery, but it was just odd enough to warrant a little effort. He watched London slide by outside of the cab.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice cracked apart, intimately so, in that monosyllabic utterance. I knew how he hated to repeat himself, but he seemed to be unable to say anything else. My name was borne on the air around us, not cold -- but affected, and said almost as a warning. He had not pushed me away, though. That was enough encouragement for me. I must have lost my mind, gone mad in the stress of it all. Fractured senseless by death and loss and need unbound.
For clarity's sake, I am not referring to the Johnlock portion or what happens thereafter in A Learning Curve, but the Shaun/John history arc! The Shaun backstory made soooo much sense for John's character in the BBC show. It provided depth and reason, and explained his entire relationship dynamic with Sherlock.
The floor creaked in the kitchen. John looked up, feeling empty, distant from his body.
He had the door open and we piled in, with me shutting the door and locking it behind us. Sherlock had paused and was very quiet. He seemed to be on high alert, as if something was wrong. I followed suit, alarmed.
[Memory:
“How so?” John queried, watching Sherlock’s lips more and more.
He unlocked the door and let himself in, taking in a breath to call out to Mrs. Hudson. The beautiful spring light made the foyer look enchanted. Golden motes danced in the air.
“Is he all oily or sweaty?” John asked, innocently sucking on the end of a straw.
John was not figuring anything out
Lestrade grunted, “Huh. Got a feeling I just lost a murder suspect.”
John watched him like a hawk, a sense of wonder filled him, and he did not hide the mischevious glint dawning in his eyes. Sherlock sat down, rather prim and proper in the chair next to John.
“Mycroft,” John answered.
John also thought Sherlock would agree.
And now we were going to eat lunch.
Curt shifted on his feet, “Her name’s Hoija. She’s brilliant. You’d dig her. She’s at the hotel.”
Sherlock slipped into a trance of memory, frustration building, “I thought I deleted it. I didn’t. I hid it, all of it, buried it,” – a harsh whisper, then, “Why didn’t I delete this?”
He texted Sherlock as soon as he was in a cab.
John stared at the screen of his phone, brows now knitted together in perplexity.
Mycroft was staring at Lestrade’s mouth now.
John was amazed. He moved his gaze to the bloke two seats down from him. The man’s hat was heavily decorated in army paraphernalia, his face weathered and hanging like battered canvas. His nose and ears were a little overgrown for his pleasant features, the unavoidable effects of gravity on cartilage as everyone ages.
Because in his words, I heard it…
Mycroft seemed to measure Sherlock’s response carefully. He subsequently flicked a hand to Anthea who stepped into view with a small suitcase, proffering it to Sherlock who stared at it suspiciously.
He did it to me, despite myself, made me laugh. The arse.
The first therapy session he’d attended last Wednesday had proven useful. His therapist had asked if living in the flat had become a problem, an emotional “road block”. John considered it. It was definitely like living in a requiem. And so, the decision was made to move out.
Sherlock did not seem to notice. John blinked rapidly. Was this what Sherlock felt when he made a deduction? If so, it was damned amazing.
What a puzzling sort of reunion! Not as expected.
Sherlock was still unresponsive.
“Formerly known as Brian Slade,” Sherlock clarified, “And Curt’s former lover.”
John was silent a moment while the new information registered. After a short stretch of silence, he spoke, “That’s why you haven’t been cashing my checks.”
A short cab ride later, Sherlock found himself staring at the results on a computer screen and at the enigmatic, green stone set in gold. He had known the setting was gold, but the identification of the stone was apparently something beyond his meager grasp of petrography.
Perhaps it never really fit perfectly under that label anyway.
“I’m missing something, though, something obvious.”
“Basically a primal obsession with the erect penis.”
“My laptop
The doctor opened the padded envelope and saw there was something small stuffed inside.
Sherlock’s smile was a surprise, and it was brief. Energy seemed to build around him, charging the air between them, “Good. Now. Tell me about Arthur Stuart.”
John glowered to himself, slowing down. He was lucky he hadn’t knocked them both over. He forced himself to take a deep breath. Sunlight lanced through the trees that grew at regular intervals along the street.
are you smiling?”
“John,” I heard him say my name, oddly unsure. I picked up the cups from the counter and turned to look at him. He locked eyes with me and I licked my lips nervously. It was hard not to stare at his exposed self. I set the tea on the table before me. I forced myself to act natural. Sort of failing at it, too.
He had to leave the room, had to leave John. He all but ran away, down the hall and into his bedroom. He shut the door quietly behind him, breathless.
There, standing on the linoleum with his hands in the pockets of his black trousers, was Sherlock Holmes. He was wearing a crisp, collared shirt, a bit too tight as he liked them. His hair was perfect. His eyes sparkled, and his mouth was crooked as if John had done something amusing. He stood there as if he'd seen the whole thing. Sherlock's lack of reaction was astounding, and unsettling.
“Sorry. What’s that?”
John frowned into the now bright and happy light of the fire of 221B, remembering what had come next with such detail that he shuddered.
“A courier dropped this for you,” the young woman said as she held out the manila package to the doctor.
Someone, the archer presumably, swatted her hand away from the arrow. She apparently had tried to rip the arrow out without conscious effort. Unfortunately for her, she was too weak to try again. She slumped over, cracking her head again on the wrought iron of the fire escape.
They stood in the kitchen, quiet.
“I want to apologize,” John started, standing unsure on the city sidewalk, looking surreptitiously at the Yarder he had avoided for the past several months.
He would not fail, no matter the cost. He’d been searching too long.
“And you? What do you want?” Sherlock asked, his baritone just above a rumble, not daring to assume too much. Not wanting to disturb the quiet.
John’s world stopped and his body seemed to become weightless. He stared openly, mutely.
The bartender was folded in on herself at the bar, large, kohl-rimmed eyes scanning the small cellphone in her hands. It was so dim in the pub that the white-blue glow lit her orangey tanned face. The mass of split ends were highlighted like a halo around her narrow features. Her focus on the phone was absolute.
Mycroft’s text alert chimed, and he rolled onto his side, and reached over to the nightstand. Bleary eyed and uncoordinated with lack of sleep, he retrieved his phone and blinked at it in the quasi darkness afforded him by the blackout drapes over the tall windows.
He stepped in front of Sherlock, keeping their hands locked together. Anyone watching would not have noticed the hand-holding, so close were they.
John walked back over to Sherlock who lifted the crime scene tape for John to duck under.
He now lived in a modest, one-room flat, twenty minutes by tube to Baker Street.
Wonderful COVER ART by JohnsRedPants!
The memories of his return from death, and John’s reaction to it, played freely in his mind. His response was as wry as his smile, “Don’t apologize for giving me what I deserved.”
Sherlock knew their friendship was in Trouble. He knew it because he had spent a lot of time being (fake) dead, alone and missing John more than he could ever articulate. He did not know how to fix it, though. And he wanted to fix it. How to fix it?
?! Nicer doesn’t mean letting some bloke suck you off in our kitchen!”
Sherlock finally looked at the doorway, seeing naught but the luggage Mycroft had brought. He sighed heavily, and folded forward onto the edge of the bed, never letting go of John’s hand.
“Right,” and he took a moment to smile back, just a little, before charging off like the idiot he was.
A subtle squeeze from Sherlock’s hand had Curt’s vision narrowing with overwhelming desire and adrenaline.
And that was it. Normalcy returned like a tide let loose upon a shore, dissolving all evidence of change upon its sandy face. Sherlock, strangely enough, seemed to hide a laugh of disbelief behind a throat clearing of his own. He answered after a small hesitation, as if something occurred to him, “This morning. Why didn’t you go in to see the luthier?”
A paramedic chose that moment to approach, holding a blanket and a medical bag, “Excuse me, do you need treatment, ma’am?”
“221 Baker Street,” he instructed the cabbie, depositing his phone back into his pocket where it bumped against the pendant.
Curt knew something was up. He hadn’t been around Sherlock much when they were sober, but they had lived together and experienced some Shit. Curt trusted his gut instinct more than he trusted anything else in the world. Right now, his instinct said something was about to happen.
Sherlock shook his head once, eyes dragging over to his doctor’s face, “His was an actual suicide.” – a beat – “At least he got the end he wanted.”
The ice water seemed to burn his throat. Oh, shit. It wasn’t the ice water. Tears threatened to mount at the edges of his eyelids. He cleared his throat and looked down into the cup. He almost strangled on the rage.
Person of interest: Retired Professor of geology, author and leading petrographist, Dr. Jacqui Lennon.
I quickly sat the coffee on the floor at the foot of the stair, ready for a fight.
The neon blue lights of the police cars were made to kaleidoscope through the splattering of rain on the cab windows. At the sight of them, John’s stomach turned into lead. The police were parked at the entrance to the hotel. Crime scene tape flapped in the wind.
Did he now see the beauty of the snow?
“Sure. Take your time. I’ll let the doctor know he’s awake,” and with that she left, shutting the door strategically behind her.
Sherlock’s gorgeous mouth was parted, and his head tilted back as John ground his hips in circles now. Sherlock arched nearly off of the mattress, exposing his throat, profiled in shadows. His rectus abdominus muscles flexed, his narrow waist gyrating in time with the doctor’s terrifically dominant onslaught.
“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” John turned fully to him then, arms still folded tightly to his chest. John smiled in wonder despite himself, “Didn’t know humans could move like that.”
Sherlock stood straight and lean before him, the light from the winter sun playing across his face. His skin was flawless. He seemed to be waiting for John to say something or do something interesting. John took a deep breath, the smell of Sherlock filled his nasal passages, the branches of his lungs and the folds of his mind. He closed his eyes, “Miss you.”
He still chose not to reply. He did not want the rock star junkie to stay any longer than strictly necessary. He wanted Curt to leave. ASAP. He decided to get back to 221B as soon as the clinic no longer needed him. Sherlock just should not be alone with that guy. At all. John reflexively made a fist, tension building to a peak within him.
“No, thank you,” Hoija declined without looking. She had eyes only for Sherlock.
The woman in the pajamas was now under the awning, looking cold and resigned. Two uniformed officers stood with her.
“No idea! Don’t wait up,” he scooped up Arthur Stuart’s file, and he was down the stairs and out of the flat like a dark, swirling wind.
John seemed both sleepy and infatuated with Sherlock’s face. He had started a pattern of observation with such unabashed intensity and familiarity that a pink flush began to creep up Sherlock’s throat. John’s tiny smile grew as the seconds ticked by into minutes.
With the last of her energy, she tried to Step in order to save herself, and regenerate, but she found her body just could not do it. Something was interfering with her ability to move to another Intersection. The arrowhead, she realized too late, was the cause. It was made of localized Star Stone.
“He said Sherlock told him to come by.”
John tore his eyes away from the headlines, nothing too interesting there anyway, “About what?”
John stood there in the living room, staring at his flatmate who sat in his black leather chair. At least Curt was seated in the client’s chair and not John’s.
Woaf. My my very first beta and brit picker. She put so much work into this fic, and I have learned so much already. Thank you.
He said this last bit, sensing John close the distance between them. He pivoted artfully to face his best friend and to move away, pulling his hands out of his pockets. He made the maneuver appear casual, fluid, but John noticed his discomfort through it.
The blasphemous confidence of that small expression awoke something feral in John’s gut, and his trepidation gave way to a familiar, desirous aggression.
In the quasi-darkness of the London streets, strange lights and shadows cast by the electric night, John's inebriated brain somehow transformed the narrow form of a running Anderson in his black, flapping trench coat. John felt like he was flying across the pavement, weightless and running on his toes, after the quick, rakish shadow of his best friend in the whole world, one Sherlock Holmes.
I was openly ogling him now, deciding finally to let my desire show in my eyes. He probably had seen it already, but never so openly. Truth be told, I never felt it so wholly until this moment, so close. It was nearly overwhelming, if not for the predatory impulse that began to build within my gut.
As I stood on the sidewalk, victim to this invasive memory, I wondered what to expect, what response, from the man I had walked away from, eschewed for so many weeks.
Sherlock moved his hand from Curt’s mouth to bracket the shorter man’s neck, palpating the bounding pulse in his jugular, the hard swallow of the throat. He traced his thumb along the unshaven jawline as he used his gaze to search Curt’s sparkling blue eyes for answers.
Within moments, the show began. Where could Sherlock be in this enormous place, and what had brought him here? John’s attention narrowed down to the stage. The dancer was male, lit from above, in stark relief, mostly in darkness.
Slowly, a lengthening V-path of skin revealed itself. His movements were not languid, but efficient. His gaze shifted from the task at hand to watch the expression on John Watson’s face morph from confusion, to shock, to terror, finally settling on helpless desire.
“Damnit, Sherlock. You deserve more than that,” John said, his voice lower and rougher than Sherlock had ever heard it. Sherlock opened his eyes, and John continued in a whisper, “And I need more than that.”
John shivered once and hard, realizing he had lost his coat, too. Then it clicked. His wallet was in his coat. And his coat was... "Bloody hell," he cursed through chattering teeth, "What're you doing here?"
Sherlock’s jaw dropped at that, and he blinked.
“Curt refused the pendant,” Sherlock spoke.
John was only now starting to thaw from the cold, buffeting wind that had accompanied his long walk.
“Nightmares,” Sherlock said, and in that one word, John heard something pretty damned scary: naked, intimate understanding. His heart clenched like a fist and throttled like a jackhammer.
“We’re going to go ahead and take off,” John informed him amiably.
Anderson seemed unable to look at him, choosing to stare at his feet instead, “You were pretty insistent… last night…”
“There’s something that I’m missing,” Sherlock declared one bright, Sunday afternoon, not a week after their First Kiss. John was perusing the paper in the living room. Sherlock had walked into the common area from the kitchen, decked out in protective goggles, rubber gloves, and a dressing gown.
John moved closer to Sherlock on the couch.
“I think so,” came the amused but nervous reply and there was no mistaking that voice.
John’s relief at the answer was short-lived as the man looked even more nervous than before.
She nodded a few times, slow, “I’m afraid so.”
“Sherlock, what happened…”
And the call was disconnected.
“I’m sorry I trounced you when you came back,” John said in a whisper, fingers coming to grasp Sherlock’s chin.
Their dynamic hadn’t remotely resembled what most people would call Friendship.
He knew he was losing Control.
“You bastard! Do you have any idea what you’ve done?! I could throttle you right now!”
I hesitated on the pavement outside 221B. I looked up at the windows. How long had I been standing here? Had he already seen me?
Sherlock had been intermittently absent lately, though John did not take it personally. Sherlock needed space sometimes. They both did.
John finally stopped laughing, sliding his hands up and down the fabric of Sherlock’s dressing gown. There were small acid burns here and there in the fabric. John closed his eyes, letting the moment brand itself into his memory banks.
The two of them had rarely been successful at feats of communication, but they had occurred… Before. It had been… oh, sod it. It had been Enough.
“I don’t believe you,” Sherlock responded with certainty.
“Yes. I was informed, and duly chastised,” Sherlock sounded as beligerent as ever. The eerily familiar tone touched a cold place somewhere inside John where no hand could ever go. It was a place he thought too wounded to survive, but there it was, beginning to undergo a momentous thaw.
It was then, feeling his arms tighten around me, tightening my own arms in return, that I noticed my lips were on his neck, just behind the angle of his jaw, just below his ear. Struck by a strange, internal lightning, I turned my face away, placed my forehead on his shoulder. I felt my body shudder, but not from grief.
Sherlock was nearly panting, nostrils flaring, eyes half-lidded, pupils dark and dilated in the midst of this filthy display. Appalling. He deliberately did not catch Curt as the man fell to his knees before him. He only stepped back and allowed him to drop.
“Mycroft, I appreciate what you’ve done, but why are you here?” John faced Mycroft once more, now crossing his arms.
Curt stood from the bed and it squeaked a little. It sounded loud in the silence.
Sherlock batted him away in his Mind Palace, and ordered this new John to get a shirt on right away. It was seriously damaging his ability to function.
The pub was cave-like, ceilings slung low and ribbed with darkly stained wood beams. There was a single window, and that window was small and set in the door through which he had come. John took an automatic tally of the occupants.
Sherlock spoke blithely and with characteristic hubris, “The woman’s name is Hoija, I presume.”
John waited in the kitchen, hearing the bedroom door click shut. He was petrified by some overwhelming emotion. He breathed into the quiet. He thought he heard a bed creak. He spun around on the spot, charged into the hall and down the stairs. He left 221B as if it were on fire. He felt like He were on fire.
Mycroft looked smug, “That is all I ask. Anthea will contact you with the details.”
It was in a Serbian dungeon that Sherlock had let himself weep, once, for John. He had not considered, ever, not for the briefest of moments, how his suicide had affected John. Sherlock had only wept for the ache of missing his companion.
Sherlock’s right hand was in his hair, now tight and motionless. Sherlock used his other hand as a prop, behind him on the table. Sherlock’s knees had gone all funny and weak. Soon, he would have to use the table to keep him on his feet.
Back in Reality, Sherlock issued an order in a placid voice, surprising Curt, “Go to my room.”
Sherlock sank to his knees in front of John, and pulled him close. His long arm wrapped around John in a tight ring, fingers digging into the jacket. Sherlock buried his nose into the hair behind John’s ear, and closed his eyes. John’s tears were silent, and he shook.
Sherlock shivered once and hard under John’s touch. His breath came tremulous between them, a quivering exhalation from flared nostrils.
“I assumed that you wouldn’t leave his side to take care of… things,” Mycroft wafted a manicured finger as if to encompass all of Sherlock, “So here you are…” – Mycroft stared at Sherlock. Sherlock stared back. – “Take the gift Sherlock, if not for your sake, then for John’s. Because he will wake.”
“Your… friend,” and Curt’s gift with his voice came to the fore, velvet and rough at once, “He seems pretty protective of you. You’re lucky to have friends like that.”
After those initial few seconds, John moved his kiss to Sherlock’s temple, breathing in the scent of the other man as if trying to assuage the trembling in his gut.
Curt left him with a handshake and a duck of the head. He darted off for the waiting cab, breath blooming in a white cloud as he slotted himself inside the car. And then he was gone.
“John!” Mrs. Hudson’s voice pierced through the somewhat awkward moment as she approached from her apartment to the entryway. She joined John in the entrance, a cursory gaze shooting past him to land on Curt.
“I hate him,” Sherlock’s declaration was muffled in the silver blonde of John’s hair.
He picked up the pendant with one gloved hand, turning it in the light. The light flashed through the stone. It didn’t look like much, but the quality of light cast from within was rather fetching. It changed the jewel from a dark, green hunk of rock to something exceptional.
He finally succumbed to a truly peaceful slumber not ten minutes later.
The holiday decorations must have been beautiful, but now they were wrecked. The tree was dark, on its side, ornaments flung far like a cascade of discarded fruit. Some were smashed. The garland on the fireplace was still glowing with fairy lights, though askew and sad looking. Three stockings lay crumpled on the ground.
“Did you understand what I just said to you, John?”
I felt his face move to my ear, his cheek against mine.
The pulse at Sherlock’s throat, exposed by the opened collar of his pajama top.
He just looked at me, but his face was softer now than I had seen it in ages. I felt drawn to him at that moment, the inexorable pull, almost like a tether from my chest to his, and my hands and arms felt hungry to be around him.
He still had the key, though, to 221.
Sherlock strode to the kitchen where John now saw a small duffel bag. Sherlock dug into it and pulled out a metal jar.
“Wait. Wait,” John stuttered, uneasy, licking his lips in nervousness and desperation.
John’s chin dropped to his chest and he pinched the bridge of his nose. The tuning peg was sweaty in his hand. He gripped it tightly as he took a deep breath. When he opened his eyes, he saw a folded slip of paper on the floor. Brows furrowed, he bent down and picked it up. A tiny splinter of wood felt out of it.
He had figured out something before Sherlock!
“Get out. Get him out. Where is he?” John barged into the flat, hands at his hips like a gunslinger in a bad western. He didn’t look like a gunslinger, though. He looked like a drowned, frustrated hedgehog. It was endearing, and oddly sexy.
Morning light wrecked into the bedroom through the icy window panes of Sherlock’s old bedroom. The light lanced into John’s brain, hangover at full throttle, creating a deep, gnawing pain that had him grabbing at the bedclothes. A warm body revealed itself under his left hand. He jerked up, and too quickly. The room spun wildly. John took deep, cleansing breaths, slowly blowing the air out through his pursed lips.
Curt’s body and the dead woman’s body were being covered with black tarps. Sherlock turned away from the scene, looking up into the sky. The rain was easing up now, coming down in soft, light pellets.
How presumptuous this guy was being! John didn’t need “liquid courage”. No, that’s not why he was here. What did the stranger know about it? Nothing. Not a damned thing!
John did, but the uniform blouse that appeared did not help matters in the slightest.
Sherlock stood close to John, pressed to him from shoulder to pinky.
John’s anger deflated.
John rolled his eyes, shook his head, and caught sight of something sitting on the counter. The pendant, it seemed to be glowing softly.
I made a noise that I could not readily describe. It was a thoughtless impulse made sonic, and I kissed him there, on his throat, a soft push of lips. My eyes closed, and two tears surprised me as they rolled down my face. They must have been sitting in my eyes. He must have seen them. Horrible thought, that. I did not care. He went rigid when he realized what I had done. Again, I did not care. I kissed him again, on his neck, and my hands leapt from his lapels to his hair.
But John had only closed it, had stayed inside with Sherlock.
“John,” he declared reflexively, dashing to the open door of John's room, sweeping in to a stop, heart pounding. John lay in the bed still, eyes closed, brow crinkled. His hands twitched and sought purchase in the bedclothes.
The words Sherlock whined and whimpered out next sent John over the precipice of human understanding:
He heard a distracted “Hmm?” from the kitchen.
“Where have you been?” John asked with a flat voice, drinking in every detail of his dead friend.
“John,” he said my name again in the protracted silence. And this close, I could feel my spoken name vibrate his chest.
Hoija intoned, hearing her words as if from a distance.
I felt the hairs on my neck stand, and looked to Sherlock just in time to see that he had been watching me. I cleared my throat and rolled up on my toes and then back on my heels, eager for a change in subject.
“Right. Thanks,” he said to himself, leaving his office to attend to the nervous young man in exam room two.
“Well... sentiment, you know…” Sherlock muttered, looking anywhere but at John.
“Really?” John responded, feigning being scandalized. He turned off the sound of the television, as if the subject required his utmost attention. Maybe it did. The whole thing was utterly fascinating.
The woman was in her late forties, and her olive skin betrayed some Mediterranean descent. She looked as if she belonged in the place, black hair swept in waves around her open face. She was tastefully dressed, but managed to look exotic. John would have turned the charm on, once upon a time, but all he felt was a jittery sort of anxiety.
Anderson did not fall back from the punch, but staggered and cupped his nose.
At the sounding of the name, Curt’s face scrunched up in confusion. He did not respond to the declaration. He merely watched Sherlock who seemed to disappear into his own head. Curt’s consternation morphed into one of longsuffering amusement.
“John,” Sherlock all but sighed, “Can you... just... tell me what to do?”
“I would rather skip the obvious, John,” he intoned in that quintessential, curt way of his, and then continued rather simply, “I am here if you… want.”
Like the waves of the ocean, the tide and the power, Sherlock’s desirous attentions were as a force of nature. With one hand at the base of Curt’s neck, the other hand grabbed the short ponytail and pulled, tilting the other man’s head back at a dramatic angle. Sherlock kissed the shorter man’s throat, licked and bit.
John’s eyes went steely and incredulous at once, “Getting myself into dangerous situations? That was all you!”
“Right,” John cut him off, sensing the man was listing these things in perpetuity for a reason.
What would it be like? The Kiss? The sex? Their Life? What was in store for them? Whatever it was, Sherlock thought as he raised John’s hand to his lips, it would be Forever.
John hugged Sherlock close.
“Doctor Watson was just waiting for us here. The suspect ran right into him. It’s not anyone’s fault, really, except maybe Newton but you can’t blame a man for his theories.” At which point, Sherlock produced from his coat a dirty, bundle of canvas. He unwrapped it to reveal a small, stone statue of a squat, naked man who was unreasonably well-endowed. Meaning, it had an enormous erection.
John’s desire built like a fire within him, licking at the walls of his viscera. His mind began to narrow down to a single point. The minutia of Sherlock’s physical form began to make themselves known to him.
John released Sherlock’s neck and dressing gown.
“Okay,” he drawled slowly as if John were being dense, “And why are you telling me this now?”
Sherlock almost knocked over a sugar bowl, but caught it with grace. He took a quick breath in relief, “Yes, my flatmate. My… friend.”
ATTN: I edited and updated the first chapter as of the posting of this new chapter (01/30/17). I had to expand a touch on Mystrade, because sometimes... Johnlock hurts too much.
“What hesitation costs a man.”
Sherlock took a breath, and continued in rapid-fire brilliance, “Brian’s ex was a known drunk and pill user. She drowned in her own vomit. I suspect this deranged sycophant had something to do with their deaths. She’d been careful with them. This was the last of it. I believe Hoija’s presence limited the killer’s options. This may have been planned as a murder-suicide, but Hoija disrupted that plan.”
Sherlock was on his phone, texting at high speed. John remained quiet despite his worry and intense curiosity.
“Sherlock,” I tried to say, and it came out rough, and so full of emotion that I very nearly lost it again. My world was only his arms, that stupid coat, and my hands gripping at its fabric. I had my eyes screwed shut, and I breathed in through my nose and out of my mouth as if I had been through a hell of a fight.
Hell, he knew what he wanted. Maybe not specifically.
There was the sound of a throat clearing from the entry behind him. He swirled. There, standing in their flat, was Mycroft Holmes.
It was the proverbial elephant in the room, a pernicious pachyderm that John was not sure he was even capable of naming. There was a delicate web of absolutely uncomfortable Feeling that had him tied up in knots.
“Bad time?” John’s voice was brisk, cold. His eyes followed Curt like the man had a loaded gun in his hand.
was her last thought before she crumpled to her knees, hands darting out to grab the rail for aide. She still ended up hitting her forehead on the bars. The metal frame of the fire escape clanged with the impact of her drop and her head. Her vision swam.
“Here I just thought you were independently wealthy and feeling sorry for me,” John tried half-heartedly at the joke.
Sherlock had been shorter than usual with him, and seemed even more uncharacteristically flustered than he had the day before. He just seemed Off, aggravated and full to bursting with a palpable energy. Curt thought he would either get shocked or burned if he got too close. It was somewhat worrisome to be around.
Jack had watched, and now was turned back the way he should be.
“Oh, sure. I’m just flattered, is all. Do you really want to have this conversation in front of them?”
“No. Not really,” I replied simply. I had come for penance, and was being offered… pie?
Sherlock suddenly went serious, “Indeed. So why did you not pursue Moira?”
He recalled her petite form, her quick, assessing eyes and her welcoming smile. Moira had been her name! And he would talk of his new position at Redfearn and Ivy, a charitable medical practice that had accepted his application the same day he had submitted it. Something told him she would appreciate the charitable aspect of his new job. Maybe enough to accept a dinner invitation. Maybe more.
“My apologies…” Sherlock spoke, and he quieted, “I am sorry.”
Mycroft stepped further into the flat, casting his glance about. Though he’d had the place bugged to the gills, he would not miss the opportunity to look for himself. Because of his surveillance devices, he knew just about everything that took place in these walls. Thankfully, John had been too preoccupied to do any checks.
Sherlock straightened himself, turning to let his gaze settle on his flatmate, “I do apologize, John. We got… Well... carried away, as it were.”
“We were on a case. You fell from a boat. You hit your head. You’re in the hospital. You were tied to your bed. I am untying you now. You were flailing in your sleep. I just paged the nurse...” Sherlock had launched into his rapid-fire monologue mode, untying John’s wrists and ankles as he did so.
The archer stood, staring at Hoija's unconscious form.
“‘Course, she’s not you. It’s just… different.”
John sucked in a deep breath and held it until his heart hammered and his fingers numbed. He pulled himself out of the memory with physical effort. He turned from the fire and let his attention land on the mobile phone that was perched on the in-table next to his chair.
Jack sighed loudly, his voice raw as if bearing a wound, “Never worth staying mad at someone you care about.”
“Well, that’s a bit rude,” Sherlock supplied in a totally reasonable tone of voice. He put the lid on the kettle.
John sucked in a breath, “There’s a scary thought.”
Sherlock was silent while John wrestled with his sense of propriety as well as the alien need to confess.
“That old?”
Mycroft’s voice was clear and disdainful, “My brother’s extremely inconvenient love for you, Doctor Watson, is something I could not anticipate.”
“Why are we here?” John mewled, sounding strangely petulant.
John had not expected it to sound so serious when said aloud, as if he had just confessed to murder. His voice was barely above a whisper as he studied Sherlock’s face, “I had sex… with a man… a few times.”
John did not touch there, however. He looked up at his friend’s hair. He let his fingertips reach up and brush at the softest curls of black hair that fringed Sherlock’s head like a crown. He then placed his hands on Sherlock’s bare shoulders, feeling the deltoid muscles flex beneath his caress.
He kissed Sherlock, lips shockingly gentle in contrast to the force of the grip he had on Sherlock’s nape.
John stepped to the side and Curt disappeared down the hall and then into Sherlock’s bedroom. He closed the door behind him.
A sweat stripe between his shoulder blades was darkening the fabric of his purple shirt.
“Coffee for me, please,” I responded to the man behind the counter, though I did not even want coffee at the moment. It would be something to hold onto at least, a prop for normalcy in a sea of unknowns.
, it said... how often did you download... oh, and
Spring was in full swing, but today was cold. John strode with a purpose away from Anderson. He felt bad for what he’d done because he knew that Anderson was right.
“I can’t remember if it was yours. What does it matter?” he asked, accompanied by a sigh and a roll of the eyes.
Curt studied John’s face, gaze dark and intense. The doctor was a stranger to him but the rigid expression, the pain in his sapphire eyes was so recognizable that Curt almost hurt to see it. He recognized it because that pain was his own, the pain of Love Betrayed. The anger, too, was something Curt found resonated with him, to the bone.
John’s satisfied smirk at this statement took a moment for Sherlock to register, and then John responded with a snarky: “Apparently not.”
“Can we… can we go home?” John all but whispered the last, as if fading away. The tenor of it scared Sherlock somehow, alarm bells going off in his head.
Was it even a friendship anymore?
Dr. Lennon’s eyes rounded and she gasped, “Oh! Oh, oh! Hot diggity!” She pulled out a small lump from the package.
The phone signal terminated.
, Sherlock.
“No, no protest from me, as long as it means I get to whoop your arse when you come back.”
He tore his gaze from Jack, and downed his second glass of whiskey, “No more for me, thanks,” he said a little too forcefully to no one in particular.
“Good to see you, too,” I gave a half-wave and half-smile for the rebuffed detective’s benefit. I resolved to have a pint with the man, and soon. At least he didn’t make me feel like I was wavering between wanting to punch him and wanting to... what? I looked askance at my friend who directed me closer to the entrance of Speedy’s.
John’s immediate response to that was a small, wicked smile that could set the walls on fire. It certainly did a number to Sherlock, every bit of him.
It had left Sherlock feeling unsteady, and confused.
There was no doubt about it. Sherlock was the masked dancer: lithe, long and perfect. Bewitching. Shocking. John all but ran out of the theater to the sounds of hundreds of people cheering, in awe of his flatmate’s body… and the spectacle of it. Holy hell.
No evidence. No set time except it would be tonight, the next twelve hours. He looked outside the windows of the Baker Street flat. The sun had disappeared behind the London skyline, leaving a powder blue and tangerine glow. John’s viscera shivered with a horrible, life-shattering wonder.
The Sherlock imposter snuffled and groaned quietly, turning in his sleep so that John could see his face.
Sherlock gave a disgusted grunt of disapproval, “I suddenly don’t want to know.”
John bowed his head, breath coming in great draughts. The world swirled. His blood went to his feet.
Sherlock did not immediately answer. He pulled his hands from his pockets and strode up to John, kicking a piece of the violin out of the way. Pieces crunched softly under his shiny, black dress shoes.
He paused for a moment, took a deep breath, “The truth is… I planned on seducing you.”
He cursed into the fire, and felt guilt for the horrible thought. He did not do well with idle time. Idleness swallowed and corroded him as surely as any disease. He would just have to not be idle, then. He would try… for Sherlock. Sherlock had saved him, after all, hadn’t he? The berk.
Curt had never thought he would have had this chance again. He showed his gratitude with wanton furvor, trying to recall the techniques that had been most effective. He softly scraped his lower teeth on the underside of Sherlock's dick, a smooth, careful pressure that had Sherlock whispering a curse.
Hoija had been right.
And it took John too long to realize what… exactly… he was seeing. His feet became unsteady as his world collapsed at the edges. Sherlock.
Sherlock found himself relating to this statement. Conductor of Light, indeed. Mind Palace John left the room.
“Sherlock, I didn’t think you’d come rushing down here,” Lestrade said, his voice was tempered with surprise and sympathy.
John spoke, then, his words resounding through every cell of Sherlock’s being: “Stop thinking, and let me do what I want.”
His long leg was folded under him.
John seemed to be doing the same, as if Sherlock would randomly cease to be, as if life at 221B was an uncertain miracle.
Sherlock was alive, and he would speak with him tonight.
It took John too long to register what Anderson had specifically said, but he did finally see the importance of moving along... as in following Anderson's jogging sillouhette farther down Baker Street and away from grumpy gift shop owners.
The reality, the breadth of it all, was beginning to really sink in. John was disturbed to realize that he resented Sherlock almost as much as he loved him. And that was a whole hell of a lot. His anger was what kept him upright, ready for bear. Tremulous hope, on the other hand, was what kept his heart thudding like a bass line behind his sternum and at the bottom of his throat.
Sherlock looked down from his friend’s distorted reflection in the toaster in order to meet the upturned gaze of a startled Curt Wild.
John stilled, his innards seemed suddenly buoyant as if he were about to freefall on a roller coaster. What had his friend seen in him? What had Sherlock deduced? There were things about himself that John struggled to accept. What the hell was about to be said? He shifted nervously as his anxiety grew.
John closed the distance between him and the front of the grand desk. He dropped his voice to a hushed tone, “He left a note in his violin. I… found it.”
A thought sprouted in John’s mind, “Hang on... you illegally downloaded it?”
Once discarded memories pervaded his mind’s eye, experiments, forays of a very different ilk.
Instead of shaking her hand, he gave a miniature bow and an apologetic smile, “Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.”
Jack Redfearn seemed not to notice, and continued without prompt, “I mean, you know? It could end. Poof. Stray bullet, car just splatters you on the pavement, random heart attack, cancer…”
Her intelligent, dark eyes scanned the pieces. Her fingertips touched and poked for only a few seconds before her gaze lifted to meet his. John could feel himself sweat. He touched his upper lip. The smile at her mouth was gentle.
John made an “mmm” sound behind his smile and just that sound made Sherlock blush deeper. He frowned and stood. He collected his cup of tea and John’s without a word, and hurried into the kitchen.
He shrugged on his jacket, his mood lightening at these thoughts.
The implications of Curt’s position were overwhelming, blurring all of Sherlock’s senses into one. It was all that mattered, forgetting himself and altering reality to encompass just the pleasure. It was not personal or sentimental, this exchange. It was necessary, like a dose of medicine. Like a hit.
The realization that this was happening washed over him like a cool wave and he shivered, frozen in time, in his mind. It wasn’t the sex. It was the raw emotion. It was his own, private Pandora’s box of repressed feeling and memory, shattered open by the words Sherlock had spoken. Fear and sadness overwhelmed him as surely as a riptide.
“Please, John. You can do better than that,” Sherlock’s scoffing tone needled the last vestiges of John’s patience. Sherlock plucked annoyingly at the stringed instrument, a repeated note that grated John’s nerves.
“Thank you for everything,” he spoke, forcing himself to feel nothing. He called on his military bearing, and stuffed the rampaging thoughts to the back of his mind. He stood, and handed the glass back to her. His smile was tight and small.
Hoija looked to Lestrade, and then back to Sherlock. With a strange, lost kind of expression taking over her face, she said, “The truth is rarely pure, and never simple.”
The steely gray of the morning had turned subtly darker and colder, even as noon approached. The promise of a heavy snow pressed close as my gut knotted, once again in strange apprehension.
“Why? So you can warn me off of Curt Wild? I’m sure John was just super concerned,” Sherlock straightened from his stooping posture, “Tedious.”
John was mulling over the implications of what he’d just said, taking in the features of Sherlock’s face. His best friend seemed suddenly so much younger than John ever remembered seeing him.
John’s heart ignited at the sight of Sherlock’s unshed tears.
John slowly approached Sherlock from the side, carefully studying the man’s face. Just when John had begun to wonder how to help his friend, Sherlock turned to John, and looked him right in the eyes.
Could he say that now?
Even now, almost six hours after his confrontation with Mycroft, John was in shock. Numb, and still falling.
It wasn’t a question. John’s mind just was not working very well. The silence of the kitchen was palpable.
“She executed the… murderer,” Sherlock offered, turning his gaze to the mousy-looking dead woman.
“Rude?!” John replied in a tone opposite to Sherlock’s.
Mrs. Hudson approached him and placed a consoling hand at the crook of his arm, “I’m going to turn down the heat, and leave you two alone. Got to pop down for some groceries, too. D’you need anything?”
"Where's your coat?" The taller man asked, slow to catch on. Sherlock would have deduced right away that John had lost it, along with his wallet...
Sherlock took that single step, instantly crowding Curt’s personal space, taking up all the oxygen in the room.
John understood the question. Veterans could recognize eachother pretty much anywhere, even without the military pins and badges, “Afghanistan.”
They shared a thick silence. When Sherlock spoke next, it was an emotionally affected timbre colored with some amusement, “I knew you would follow me eventually.”
“Sherlock,” John proceeded, “What was that you said last week? About Greg’s umbrella?”
“Curt spoke well of you,” Hoija remarked.
“It’s Lennon,” he announced before quickly reading the text, and then standing and speaking in rapid succession, “She can inspect it tonight. She’s at the lab. And... I can make the train if I go now.”
I tilted my head up out of the shelter of his coat, and opened my eyes.
Something in John’s face stopped him.
John’s brows raised at the older man’s question, distracting him from the burn of the whiskey.
, when one of the two heroes had been trapped by a bomb on the toilet.
John waited, and watched. Nothing.
John stood suddenly at that. He could not sit still. He had a need to move. He turned his back on Sherlock, approaching the tall, darkened window and looked out at the street.
“So, what do you want to do?” John asked.
“Oh, John! It looks like you’ve been busy,” Mrs. Hudson stepped into the flat, hands clasped together at her chest.
That was when he smiled. And that was when he crashed into Anderson and they tumbled down onto the sidewalk with no little amount of awkwardness and pain.
Sherlock couldn’t help the blush now, “Perhaps a bit sweaty…” – he cleared his throat, looking down – “Bloody sometimes.”
She moved away from the brick wall, to the black railing of the fire escape, and turned to look at the Great Starlight with its white-yellow brilliance.
Finally, he was able to crack open his eyes. They were crusty with sleep, and he could smell the liquor in his sweat. He must have turned the heat up last night, too hot.
Sherlock nodded, and looked at John with a hard expression, as if wondering if John knew fully what that meant.
“Okay! Here,” she proffered a business card which he took with a cursory glance. Her eyes were bright in their intensity, “Please, please, please give my card to the owner. If they are interested, I would be willing to put them in touch with some people… People who could learn a whole lot from that stone. Oh, and without damaging it!”
John watched the color drain from his best friend’s face, “What? What is it?”
Sherlock paused, considered, shrugged, “Could be anyone. The Prime Minister. Anyone.” Sherlock returned to his selecting the next…
“The difference is, John… The difference is…” Sherlock seemed stuck.
Through the slat of vision that his squinting afforded, he saw the person who shared the bed. A man face-down, dark hair just above the nape of his neck. His cervical vertebra stuck out above the collar of a white t-shirt. For a wicked, torturous instant, his eyes went wide and mouth fell open. He covered a thoughtless whisper behind a sweaty palm that had risen unbidden to his lips, “Sherlock…”
“Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Old. And just… well, very weird!”
“Yes, I am,” Sherlock answered, and the lack of his acerbic wit began to unnerve John. Sherlock looked like he’d aged five years since he’d gone, and John couldn’t be sure from this distance, but he thought he saw some streaks of gray in Sherlock’s hair.
Mrs. Hudson came to stand near him, watching the last vestiges of the deerstalker furl and flash as it was consumed in the fire, “You’ve burned your hat, dear.”
“It’s Lestrade,” was what Sherlock said, looking up with his lips parted and eyes a little wide.
Part of him suspected he’d deserved every bruise his doctor had prescribed and administered.
John was appreciative of the cover of the awning. He was shivering now, and noticed that Lestrade was shivering, too.
“Good to see you,” Curt said with unabashed warmth as he and John’s landlady shared a heartfelt embrace.
Mycroft looked grimmer, older, lowering his chin and his eyes, “It seems despite my efforts, I have failed my brother on all counts.”
“Oh, you stop it. Heavens, look at us hanging about here in the freezing cold. Come in! Come in!”
He slammed his eyes shut, squeezed the lids tight. Nausea turned his stomach. Disbelief stopped his heart.
When Sherlock didn’t say anything after a while, a kind of sad dread tugged at the corners of John’s thought process. John spoke with a deep, reticent finality, eyes still closed, “What is it… Sherlock…? Did I give it all away…” – two, angry, hot tears crept out of the corners of his eyes – “Like this? In a bloody hospital room… in a dream… like a stupid, lovesick idiot… pining after… after someone...”
Stunned by his friend’s uncharacteristically poor use of words, John felt his face go hot in embarrassment, “Well, no. I mean, I didn’t know it at the time. But, yeah… yes. Now. I mean, not NOW, but I get it now.”
She tutted again, and sighed, “Isn’t it ghastly!? I’m surprised it hasn’t given me nightmares. He put it up a few days ago. But he’s been in such a slump that when he snapped out of it, I was just happy to see him moving about again! I didn’t have the heart to question it.”
I participated in a short, farewell hug and she was gone, leaving me holding the purple bag.
John frowned, dropping his hands carefully to his sides, “But… what…why were you…you know… in there?”
I had fucked it all up. When I had needed him the most, I had forced onto Sherlock Holmes the one thing he could not offer. I was such an idiot. No, worse. I had been a shitty friend. He hadn’t deserved it. I hadn’t the right.
“Home,” he agreed, lending a small nod before letting go of Sherlock’s hand, “One sec, yeah?”
Sherlock turned to look at John, lid to the kettle in his hand, “You came back to kick Curt out of our flat?”
“Yes. Fuck me, John,” came Sherlock’s breathless demand, his long, nude body a mixture of shadow, alabaster white, and patches of blushing pink.
John shut his mouth, jaw clenched. He swallowed, squeezed his fists so tightly that they sweated and cramped.
John figured that he must’ve been doing something right if Sherlock’s clavicles and zygomatic arches were less than razor-sharp lately. He’d witnessed Sherlock eat four whole meals just in the past week, plus snacks! Wonder of wonders.
Sherlock was still M.I.A., probably showering. That was when I heard the tea kettle whistling its readiness. Tea sounded fantastic. I walked to the kitchen and set the gift on the table. I commenced to preparing the brew.
Sherlock was already headed for the door. Dr. Lennon followed behind him in her manual wheelchair as he made his way to the laboratory entrance. She had no problem keeping up with his long strides.
Curt’s memories of Sherlock began to fall into place, defining the moment suspended between them. He remembered the eyes being this sharp, and sharper still had been the Brit’s acerbic wit and tongue. When they had shared orbits, it had been a tongue upon which were borne strange and marvelous ideas.
He swept out of the sandwich shop into the curtain of snow that was falling over London. I was a step or so behind, holding tight to my neglected beverage. I waited behind him as he used the key to unlock the door to the flat. The snow settled in his hair and on his shoulders. Our breaths now blossomed white before us.
John was not too surprised at Mycroft’s politeness, but he took note of it, “Sure thing.”
Their voices had gotten quiet, achieving hushed tones in the growing intimacy.
“You can come home with me, to Baker Street, John. You… don’t have to live alone. You don’t have to be alone. Just wake up, please, and we can go where ever you like.”
I could not ignore the change of heart I had experienced, could not simply pick up where Sherlock and I had left off. I had lost too much, and realized too much, and I needed a resolution. I did not know exactly what I wanted from Sherlock, but I had a vague idea… and it wasn’t just the simple friendship that we had enjoyed for so long. I needed more now, for some reason I could not or did not want to understand. It was too much to think about.
John grumbled and replaced the phone in his pocket.
Lightning had struck a news van on the other side of the street.
Sherlock instantly recognized the change in the man’s tone, and lifted his eyes to meet those of his friend. Never had he witnessed such heat and intensity in the sapphire darkness of John Watson’s irises. They were now punctuated by enlarged pupils, polished to brilliance with predatory light.
Sherlock’s tiny smile was sly. It infuriated John.
He was suddenly transported, totally disoriented in the resultant blackness. Instantaneous panic. Was he blind? No. It was a bedroom masked in quasi-darkness. He was blinking rapidly, covered in sweat. Drenched with it, in fact, hot. He was kneeling on a bed, his hard cock fully embedded within a warm, tight orifice bracketed by long, powerful legs to either side of him.
Though I was secretly famished, the idea of food was too much to consider at the moment. I felt unsure, off-kilter, but I would muscle through. Surely. I could do this.
I let my eyes drop from his ice-green gaze, let it flicker down his chest, belly, the cinch at his pants, and then back up to his lips.
Sherlock’s gaze flitted around the room, as if assessing the truth of the statement for himself.
John nodded.
Mycroft continued to speak as if John had not spoken, “But perhaps a position as a field surgeon would be considered, as a gesture of good will. And before you refuse outright, the position was not made for you. The position has recently been vacated, and there is most definitely a need to fill it.”
Curt would always have a fascination with the man because of it. Sherlock had that inexplicable Something that Brian Slade had possessed. Except with Sherlock, there was no rabid self-awareness of it. It remained pure, unadulterated Self, bared for the world to witness. It made most people feel small, uncomfortable. For Curt, it was like staring into a fire. Mesmerizing, inviting, thrilling. Dangerous in its ability to consume.
The flaxen haired man probably would think something was Wrong, that Sherlock had been kidnapped and the text was somehow a ruse. There was no help for it, though. Sherlock must find a way to address and resolve the tension between them or risk permanent damage.
The wiper blades slapped viciously, barely clearing the rain as they drove.
“You wanted to…” Sherlock’s brows knitted together, and a low “hmmm” resonated in his throat, “…to have sex?” -- his voice dropped in tone and volume as disbelief clung to the cogs of his mind – “…with me?”
“They know,” Mycroft stated.
He huffed darkly at that thought.
“You," John breathed, paralyzed with fear and hope, and every weird, unnamed, unrelenting emotion that went along with knowing Sherlock Holmes.
I got the feeling he was trying not to get too exasperated at my remark, as if suppressing a roll of his eyes, “Please, John, this is new to me as well, but I would really like to…” - he gesticulated with a characteristic rolling wave of his hand as he searched for the words - “…get on with it.”
“Good for you!” Jack cheered, raising his beer and grinning, “Go get her!”
“I would like to say it was simply to dismantle Moriarty’s network, but that would be doing you an incredible disservice.”
“What was that language you were speaking?” Sherlock queried, curiosity at its pique, mind whirring so much John thought he could hear it.
He popped back into his room and gathered everything he needed to prepare for Curt’s arrival. Aubergine shirt. His favorite. Why not? He looked damned good in it, he knew. John had very nearly said as much one day, not long ago.
Sherlock declared in a marveling tone of voice: “You had sex with… a man.”
“Dr. Watson, please enlighten me. What do you find so very amusing?”
The Story: John
“You are right to be concerned, Dr. Watson. What do you know of their past association?”
“Wait, I thought you were at your sister’s last night?” John’s brows furrowed, and his voice sounded horribly loud and felt agonizingly visceral.
The doctor decided to offer a piece of his own secret, out of fairness and mercy for Sherlock’s pitifully conflicted expression. John said with some earnest feeling, “I do. Sometimes.”
Sherlock closed his eyes.
John’s eyes darkened, “You were more than just brilliant. Sherlock, you were the most beautiful… sexual… thing I have ever seen.”
His emotions ran the gamut, ranging from anger to terror and back. Interspersed throughout was the rather vivid and fresh memory of Sherlock getting sucked off in the kitchen. He hadn’t seen anything, not really, but it had been enough to set loose his imagination.
Sherlock almost refused out of principle, but the unblinking skepticism and wonder in his friend’s eyes kept his cynicism at bay. It filled him with uncomfortable sentiment.
“John, he’s not here,” Sherlock stood, putting his phone away. He stalked into the kitchen to start a kettle. John obviously needed tea.
I could not answer because Sherlock suddenly placed his gloved hand on my shoulder, and spoke to the detective rather brusquely, “I beg your pardon, detective, but it seems there’s a matter of some urgency that needs a doctor’s attention. John? If you please?” and he guided me away from the detective and the scene before us.
“No,” John insisted with such immediacy that it startled Sherlock.
It was a flip phone. For one call. To be burned in the fire afterwards.
John furrowed his brows and growled in frustration, “Stop,” he commanded.
“Slow down,” John whispered tiredly. Sherlock sat back down in his chair after John was freed. He sat close to John, taking in every detail anew.
He looked around at the mess and, as if on autopilot, walked to the closet in order to retrieve the broom. He swept up the detritus mechanically, making a small pile on the carpet. He hunted for pieces in the chairs, under the tables, picked them up and, soon enough, there was a mound of wood and metal that had once been a priceless instrument. His vision blurred again, and he saw Sherlock’s bloody body on the pavement.
When it was apparent that Sherlock was committed to making tea, Curt moved from the light of the living room into the fluorescent hum and clank-bustle-whoosh of the kitchen. He stopped at the edge of the linoleum, taking in the layout of the place.
Jack stared back.
John cleared his throat and ducked his head a bit, rubbing at his brow as if it would help to find the right words, “He said that you… that you…”
She felt nothing.
to be figuring it out, or was Curt completely hidden behind the table?
Truth be told, Sherlock did not want to ride the shuttle or the train. Some part of him wanted to get into the warm car and be summarily transported back to Baker Street in relative privacy and comfort.
His voice was wobbly but strict. He squeezed his eyes shut.
“Well, then you know,” Jack’s voice was nearly a whisper, the tone low and secretive as he leaned in.
Curt cleared his throat, “Yeah, I met someone. Not like a relationship or anything, but a friend. A good friend, turns out.”
John’s curtesy allowed him to relax in increments until they were ensconced in their respective chairs, a new fire dancing at the hearth, and their feet bare between them. A sense of completeness filled 221B to the brim, spilling out onto the street below and setting the world right again.
Her pity was almost as nauseating as the hangover. Almost. He dare not shake his head, only murmured, “No, thank you, Mrs. Hudson. Very much.”
