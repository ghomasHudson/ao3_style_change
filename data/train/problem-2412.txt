"Yes, I'm familiar," Sherlock said, kissing the crown of his head.
"Then I lower my head and I put my mouth on your cock. And you say-"
"You've been reading the books." She said when she finally did speak.
. I'm not lying, I lost count. I take them when I need them and let's just say I have needed quite a few today."
Damn.
Mycroft shutter blinked but quickly regained what small composure he'd lost.
He pulled into their drive and put the car in park, his hand gripping the steering wheel so tightly it went beyond pain into numbness.
"It was said in a moment of anger."
Hi Sherlock,
"I am not a reflection of you, Sherlock. I am my own person. I exist whether you do or not, in fact, I managed to exist for two straight years without you. Fancy that."
Would he be taken aback by the stubble? By hands, the height, the strength, the broad back, the shoulders, the jaw, everything that was so distinctly male?
"John, look at me." He said and only then did he realize he'd been glancing away. He was regretting demanding they Skype. He really didn't want to see Sherlock's face as he did whatever his version of letting someone down easy was. He really didn't want to be seen either. Glancing at his friends face John felt a very real surge of pain in his heart. Oh God but that face, his face. And everything that came with it. The feeling of his body against his, holding his hand, soft, gentle discussion, the same old loving teasing. God, he loved him. How stupid it had been to deny it all this time.
Sherlock gave the address and then rolled up the glass that divided them from the driver.
“So, your other patients-”
"Then..." He gasped before continuing. "Then after we got back to the flat. The empty flat. No police. No Lestrade. No drugs bust. After Angelo returned your cane. I wanted to flirt with you more. Never would have had the nerve but I wanted to. I wanted to convince you to take the flat. I wanted to go back upstairs and I wanted you to make a move."
Ten minutes later he was sitting there in his chair, his toes flexing against the carpet grabbing it in tufts.
"I'd be content to spend it like this if you like."
"I feel like I'm going to puke." He said swallowing hard."
"What are you doing you?" Sherlock asked after a moment clearly upset at both the truncated argument and being ignored.
It was a rather obvious thought that occurred to him as Sherlock edged forward gently, stretching that tight ring; fingers are far different than a cock. They felt good and they were filling and they helped him get accustomed to the notion of stretching. But fingers were malleable in a way that a hard, hard cock was not. They demanded less, needed less space, less situating, and far fewer of John's pain receptors.
"Are you ok?"
"Because your penchant for imprecision annoys me, John."
"What does that mean?"
John slipped under the remaining clean sheet along with Sherlock and turned toward him quickly to engage him in a kiss.
Neither of us said; 'It doesn't have to be.' Too afraid to, I guess.
Everyone who knew him greeted him with a hearty welcome, congratulations, a bracing hug, a kiss on the cheek and a "Well done!". It felt nice. He didn't need his decision to spend the rest of his life with Sherlock validated. But still...to be embraced like this, it felt nice.
John raised his as well to toast with his husband.
You are one of the strongest, bravest people I know. Far braver than me on my best day.
"Well, my wife was pregnant in late 2014 early 2015 and wasn't really in the mood. There was a lot going on in general so we didn't have sex. Our daughter was born in January and- " he stopped short deciding to leave out the part about the confusing affair and infidelity-wanks. "I was able to masturbate in those early months but after she died...any ability to do that was gone. I started drinking, I got really depressed. That all started in February of 2015."
"I like her too, actually. Was it difficult to...kiss someone you weren't sexually attracted to?"
He saw the shift in his body posture, the way his lips became a straight, flat line. Rosie noticed too as she brought both hands to his cheeks pulling them upward.
"Hi.." He began. "I'm John and I'm an alcoholic."
They shared a parting kiss, leaving the bedroom and heading in their own separate directions.
be...
John studied his friend closer a horrifying thought creeping into his mind.
The second one, newer, but compelling; create a false bottom and get the person into treatment whether they admit they have a problem or not.
"No one can remove "The Charlie Horse", John. It's common knowledge! Look it up!"
"A pleasure."
"I don't really need to write it down." Sherlock huffed. "I'll remember-"
"You said I was vain and I liked attention."
And maybe, just maybe that could be ok?
"I may fall under the category of being too tired," Sherlock said softly.
"Not much time to savor a breakthrough." John joked.
"Ok, well the good news is this. There are meetings both here and on the outside that embrace the secular and I urge you to find them. The second bit of good news is that you're doing well and that's mainly due to your commitment to therapy. But I still need you to give AA an honest try. I think the best way to do that now is through steps eight and nine."
"That's great, Harry, it really is." He smiled and hoped it looked sincere. He was happy for this news but somehow it was hard to feel it.
"Yes, of course, John, please." Reggie beamed. He'd been trying to get him more involved since day one and always liked when John volunteered.
So careful not to wake her they saw Clara tiptoe into the frame. She smiled and waved at them briefly before Harry handed her off and they disappeared to Rosie's bedroom.
"I didn't want to go..." He trailed off.
"What?"
"John?"
"Please stop being so nice to me."
too tired to cry.
John picked up the box which was heavier than he expected and opened the top. He slid out the contents into his hand and was greeted with a small jar. There was no mistaking the contents and even though it was sealed John could still detect the florid scent.
When he felt teeth sink not-so-lightly into the fleshy part of his inner thigh he yelped and looked down to see Sherlock looking back up at him, eyes glinting darkly.
"We're very happy to have you here." She said with a practiced smile.
"Is this guilt about your dead wife?"
"Not what she did. It didn't take long for me to realize I wouldn't be able to stand the monotony of being a GP. Emergency medicine started to appeal to me so I shifted my focus, kept training, got a few jobs, Bachelors of Surgery, trained in Trauma and Orthopedics. When it was time to reapply again for a new position, that was when I got the letter from Duck. I felt like I'd been moving in slow motion. I was good at what I did. I was a good doctor...I hope I still am. But still I was so unsatisfied, so unhappy. I thought the letter came at the best possible time. A saw a chance to enlist in the Army's surgical training program and I took it."
"Very well. I have some ground rules and boundaries of my own. The first was about sharing my bedroom which we've already covered. The second, with your permission, I would like to amend my will to ensure that in the event of my death all that I have goes to you. Number three-"
John felt a stinging behind his eyes, and fell in love a little more. “Yes,” he said. “Yes, I want that too. But promise me, Sherlock, that if you are ever uncomfortable, or if the feeling of vulnerability surpasses your curiosity or pleasure, you will tell me immediately.”
“To her or to – it’s not fair.”
Sherlock found himself unable to take his eyes off John’s costume. “You look amazing.”
He had clearly pulled himself together since Sherlock had first arrived, his clothing immaculate as usual, not a hair out of place, his expression unruffled. The desperate man Sherlock had seen earlier was gone, but Sherlock realized that he would never forget it.
“Oh,” Sherlock says, almost to himself.
“All right then,” Mrs Hudson said. “On your marks, get set,
Sherlock’s eyes followed the tracks until they ended at a ramshackle shed.
“Ginger molasses sounds great. Ta.”
“Yes. I did, though it cut off when you entered the water.” Mycroft’s expression faltered. “I was… distressed to hear the… you put yourself at considerable risk to ensure the evidence against Moriarty was captured. I rather wish you’d mentioned something of your suspicions to me in advance, I could have-”
Wèi = hey, hey you
“I’ve only ever seen amniculusite in museums. How heavy would two million worth be? Could one person act alone, or would he need several people? Would he need equipment? Who would be a potential buyer? How would-”
“I’m an angel, Sh'lock!” she said, twirling around.
“Mr. Holmes, how good to see you again!”
Martin nodded and stepped out, leaving John and Holmes alone in the room.
With every stroke, he tried to push his panic farther down, but it kept surfacing.
“Thanks, but the restaurant shouldn’t get stiffed for his dinner.”
“Rosie,” Sherlock said sharply, holding her more tightly. She was being naughty; why was she being naughty? They might not let them stay if Rosie was naughty. “Behave.”
“Off you go, then. Chuckers.”
“Yes, immediately,” Holmes said. He darted to the bookshelf. “Hurry and pack, Watson. I believe there is a train leaving St. Pancras within the hour. I will check the schedules and then hail a cab to rush us there. We can telegraph Cubitt from the station.”
He was still roiling over the issue as their cakes went into the oven. As he began to whip the heavy cream, wondering if he could sculpt something on the top of the cake with the cream, he saw John breaking up a chocolate bar into a bowl and heading towards the microwave.
“What happened?”
John seemed to remember himself as they were let out of the car, using his cane again but not heavily. Clearly he was as aware of the cameras as Sherlock was.
“Think real hard,
“Precisely. So I dress a certain way.” Sherlock indicated his suit, his bow tie now undone and hanging slack around his neck, and the jacket with tails thrown across the sofa. “I treat her with the courtesy she craves but does not receive from her colleagues. I take her to grand opera, plays – all with romantic, tragic themes.”
Gǒushǐ = shit
“All right – thank – thank you,” he said, glancing upstairs. He could hear the pipes rattling.
“Night night Uncle Mycroft,” she said, and was asleep.
“Very pretty, John,” Sherlock said. “Did they teach you that in the army?”
“-recovering. Significant heartbreak about six months ago. He was married, unwilling to give up-”
“What did you mean when you said, ‘Deduce me’? and – what did he see?”
“No, of course not,” Sherlock said. He laughed softly, which made John look up – Sherlock sounded a bit nostalgic, a bit wistful. “When I was growing up, we had a cook, and I had a nanny who didn’t like the cook. If I wanted to get away, I’d go to the kitchen. She’d give me things to do, keep me out of her hair, and I think to twit Nanny too.”
He barely kept his voice from cracking on the last sentence, but forced himself through the emotion. To his fury, John’s face changed to pity, and suddenly Sherlock couldn’t bear it. He turned away. “I’m going to have a shower.”
“But how did you-”
“I’ve told you time and again to not call during a performance,” he snapped.
[John takes his place next to Sherlock Holmes, arm’s length away from him. Sherlock is wearing sweatpants roughly cut off at mid-shin, and the waistband rolled up several times, and a loose V-neck t-shirt with old sweat stains. John wears khaki pants, a grey crew neck t-shirt and braces. John wears old and well-loved tap shoes; Sherlock wears hard-soled Oxford dress shoes.]
“Understood.” Sherlock disconnected.
He sat next to Sherlock on the sofa, and adjusted the laptop in front of them so that Sherlock was framed properly in the camera.
“You honour me,
“Watson! I’ve got it! Gregson and Lestrade are on their way over. All shall be revealed!”
“It is an oolong,” Sherlock replied with a smile. “It’s real, not synthesized.”
Mrs. Hudson heads downstairs and John locks up. Sherlock has already settled at the kitchen table with some terrifying-looking experiment. “All right love?” John says.
He brought his suitcase down and set it in the sitting room, then went into Sherlock’s room.  Sherlock was dashing around the room, placing items on the bed, putting some things back away.
The song ended, and John leaned over, hands on knees, panting. Sweat rolled off his cheeks and nose and to the floor. Sherlock stepped quietly into the room, not wanting to startle John. At the sound of his step on the hard wood of the studio, John turned to look at him, then straightened.
John stumbled out of the net area and towards the knot of people. He recognized some of them now – Veronica was all in black, her face startlingly painted as a skull; Jen was in a poodle skirt, her hair in a high ponytail. He sidled over to them.
Sherlock shrugged. “They caught me.”
“Well done,” John says, and reaches over to give Sherlock a hug and a kiss.
The sun was starting to set, and Eavesdown was taunting him, getting no closer no matter how hard he swam. If he didn’t reach the docks by nightfall, he wouldn’t be able to position himself; unobtrusive docks were unobtrusive because they were not well lit.
John stopped for a moment, his chest heaving, cock bobbing against his belly. He stroked the palms of his hands down Sherlock’s body, from his collarbones down his stomach, across the sharpness of his hipbones and along the length of his legs.
A group entered the cathedral, hooting with victory and carrying multiple boxes and bags of food. “Well, there’s Eileen, there’s a mercy,” Millie said.
The rest of the day stretched out long before them.
It was also smoky, rocky, and completely uncomfortable.
“If you’ll excuse me, Sherlock, I’m going to see about these mythical strawberries. Shall I bring you back some?”
John’s arm was strong and firm around Sherlock’s waist as he guided him through the labyrinth of the Docks area. Despite the blanket, Sherlock shivered harder. The ground was rough under his bare feet, but John kept propelling him forward.
“He’s just my flatmate.” John said it on reflex, suddenly realizing that he didn’t even think before saying it now. Why? She hadn’t said anything about them being together, as a couple. Why was he still reacting like this?
“Me too.”
, John thought.
he scolded himself
Ran downstairs, dumped the nappies by the door. He glanced at Mrs. Hudson’s door; he had the key to her flat somewhere, and she had the key to 221C somewhere. Too much time; he ran upstairs and threw on his coat while pulling out the lock picking kit that was always in his pocket. In front of the door, with its large padlock, he took a deep breath and let it out, forcing his heart to slow and his hands to steady. Then he inserted the tool into the lock.
Without thinking, John stepped forward, checked his hip into Hope, throwing him off balance. He quickly twisted his leg around Hope’s, shifted, and Hope flipped over John’s hip to land with a crash. John quickly turned the groaning Hope onto his front and kneeled on his back.
Confusion flashed briefly across John’s expressive face, then cleared away, and John grinned back. His eyes danced with recognition of Sherlock’s state of mind, and reflecting it. His hand lifted and, gentle for the first time, traced the shape of Sherlock’s face. Sherlock let his eyes close with pleasure, then flew open again as John took his cock into his other hand.
“I haven’t seen him for-”
,” he sighed. “Get the stero-spray – no, not that one, the blue can – and spray it over the wound, right out to the edges. Then get the aero-bandage and spray a thin layer – shouldn’t need any steri-strips but-”
“Now.” Mrs. Roshni pulled the portrait of Sherlock toward her. “I need to scold you a bit – it’s a bit unfair to the other students, using a professional model when the assignment was to draw someone at home.”
“Swings!” Rosie shouted with glee.
“Look, neither of us want to be here, right?” John’s voice came from the recorder.
“You’ve seen land mines before too.” It wasn’t a question.
that it was making John laugh.
Sherlock turned to see Michael, already in his dormouse costume. “Yes?”
“Mr. Dunworthy-”
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock snorted. “Not my thing, choreography.”
“I need to talk about this,” he said.
“Jesus.” Oh no. Said it out loud.
He dashed across the street, snarling at the pool of light he was forced to cross. Footsteps clattered down the road; Maja had seen him. Gritting his teeth, Sherlock took the jacket away from his side as he ran, wincing as the cool air hit his wound. He ran towards the fountain at the centre of the park, knowing he was leaving droplets of blood behind him. He hoped he had enough of a lead ahead of her.
On je budan = He is awake
He realized that he never asked his contact or Mycroft what was on the chip. Best not to know, he supposed.
“Then last year, the poor old man died, with no relatives alive to comfort him. I mourned the loss of his friendship, but you can imagine my surprise when I learned that I had been named in his will; and not just named, but the sole beneficiary, but with the most extraordinary provision that had ever been heard of. If I were to find three living men with the family name of Garrideb, myself included, then each of us would inherit five million from his estate.”
Sherlock grumbled something that sounded rather like, “What’s the point then,” but rose nonetheless. He moved with his habitual grace, but slowly and with a kind of care that reminded John that he was not yet completely free of pain.
“You’ve checked their dentist?”
“Don’t let me stop you,” John said, giving him the finger.
“Sorry for the conflicting agendas. I just want to go home.”
“Two unmarried gentlemen sharing rooms,” Sherlock finished. “And I am realistic about my relationship with the Yard. While I am happy to help with cases when they are brought to me, there are those who are jealous of my abilities and would not object to my removal from society.” He looked up at John. “I am sorry, John,” he said softly.
“I think it might help, yeah.”
shăgua = dumbass
Lestrade’s mouth twisted into an incomplete smile. “We’re not complete morons, you know. Of course. Different dentists.”
“No, I told you, I’m a consultant. But I need to see their records of the victims.”
After a long time, the shaking dies down into small tremours, and he knows the risk of hypothermia has passed. He feels his brain coming back online, his hind brain releasing control of his spine.  He realizes that his face is tucked into Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock is leaning his cheek on the top of John’s head.
Sherlock lifted his foot and pulled off his ballet shoe. Mycroft winced.
“Someone you don’t see every day,” she said. “I want you to try copying a portrait before trying to capture them in the flesh.” She wiggled her eyebrows with a wide, leering grin. “And I do mean flesh. Life classes are in two weeks.”
“Aye, sir.”
Nothing could have prepared me for the reception of this fic. I wrote it during difficult days of the pandemic, needing to get the story out of my head; I published it thinking that it would be politely received, that people wouldn't want to read about bombs and dark days. And then readers started commenting, reaching out, thanking me - still bewildered by that!
From between his legs he pulled a breather tube, wincing as the tape ripped at the delicate skin, and put the tube in his mouth.
“I have good news, though, Mummy,” Sherlock said, and he was smiling, smiling with joy and happiness that John knew was not just William’s, but all of Sherlock.
“Perhaps, but that’s not my concern at the moment.” Sherlock stopped and looked over at the man, who was putting his gun away into its hip holster. Wiggins would be impossible to find after this, and useless to Sherlock, and Sherlock still needed information. Perhaps this man, who was clearly acquainted with the area and with the kind of people that frequented it, could tell him something. He extended his hand, reframing his face into a more friendly look. “Sherlock Holmes.”
“What an arse,” Michael whispered, and Jen shushed him.
“Do that and you’ll regret it,” John snapped.
Sherlock was peering at the tub, then pointed at the water, still running from the tap. “It’s not the pipes, see, the water coming out is clear.” He turned off the tap. “It must be a chemical reaction to the surface of the tub. Fascinating, that is unexpected.”
, his brain chanted over and over. This was a mistake that not even a first year history student would make. He had fallen in love, and made his feelings known to a contemp, in an era where homosexuality was illegal. Holmes would have every right to turn him in; he could go to jail, and there’s no way Dunworthy would be able to get him out.
Sherlock had done this to John several times over their acquaintance. The first time, John had plunged in and done his best to follow Sherlock’s methodology of observation, to be met with sarcasm from Sherlock. For a while after that John had refused to ‘play the game’, until Sherlock had softened and said that he genuinely appreciated his input, that it helped him sometimes to see something that he hadn’t previously seen. The sarcastic responses had not disappeared completely after that, but John learned to ignore them.
He stepped into the bathroom, stripping off his shirt. He could still smell the sweat on it, the sweat from dancing this morning, from the thing that he loved most in the world. Now dance was tainted for him, something he was forced to do. How long would it take before it was forever ruined for him, until it became something he hated? He threw his shirt into the corner with more force than necessary, and rested his cheek against the cool of the tile. Then he turned on the water, tipping the faucet over to the hottest temperature he could tolerate.
Holmes tilted his head and smiled. “I thought you wanted to see Mr. Garrideb’s collection, Watson?”
He comes back to the lounge, embarrassment all over his face. “I’m so sorry. I have to go.”
It hits me with a swift left hook from my intuition.
“Have it sent to Baker Street tomorrow,” Sherlock said. “We’re going home. Now.”
John snorted in a laugh, but Maja’s face was expressionless as she slid a plate of food in front of him.
“I know,” the Director said softly.
“May I show you something else?” Jim led Sherlock out of the room and back down the hall. “This room is now complete, and I must confess it’s my favourite.” He paused slightly at the door, grinning like a magician about to reveal his trick. “I’m a bit old fashioned, but…”
“Madama Butterfly.”
“How-”
John nodded, and Sherlock saw the same shift to the practical in his eyes. “Good. They have good cameras scanning the area; we’d only need to get within ten feet of the gates for visual recognition.  They’ll likely open them as soon as they see you. Better than standing there and knocking politely and explaining ourselves to the guard.”
“John – this is – oh – this is unlike anything I’ve ever – oh please – may I – may I-”
Dobro jutro = Good morning
Greg smothered his own laughter. He had done a similar trick with his nieces and nephews, and they had laughed as hard as John. He was fairly sure, however, that he had not done it as skillfully as Sherlock had just done.

“Mine too, but they didn’t seem to worry as much about mine. I saw the screens in the lobby. They’re mostly focused on the bed – I think they were hoping for a little show. I should have made more of a fuss when we first arrived, but with Maja gone it’s less believable. Still. There’s a gap on the camera pan of a few inches by the window. What I’ll do is gradually move the camera at night, a little bit at a time, so they won’t notice it moving. When we’re ready, we should be able to hug the walls and get out the window without being seen.”
“No, love. Hasn’t said a thing. Wouldn’t eat until the baby ate, though, bless.”
“You play?” Jim said.
“Such odd cases you’ve had lately, Sherlock.”
There wasn’t enough air, there wasn’t enough oxygen in the room. All Sherlock could smell was curry and his own fear. “Just – just delete it,” he said.
John realized he was stomping around the lab, but he didn’t want to stop and would not stop.
Thank you I guess.
“Is it far?” Gregson asked, eying the valise.
“Aw, that’s good to see,” Gemma said, breaking Sherlock’s reverie. He looked at John, and was surprised that John was not looking at Rosie, but at him, and he was frowning.
John and Sherlock looked at each other and gave a sharp nod, then turned and went into the kitchen. Sherlock slid the pocket door closed and turned to John with the smile that made John’s heart race.
“Ever fucked a dancer before?” Sherlock said.
It was a terrific case. Sherlock investigated the first body, then as he whirled around to move to the second one, John swooped in for his own investigation. Later, in an alley with the murderer trapped in a corner, Sherlock dropped at the precise moment that John aimed his gun, then took advantage of the suspect’s surprise to kick his legs out from under him. John immediately was on the man’s back, pinning him down, just in time for Sherlock to grab John’s dropped gun and hide it in his coat before Lestrade came around the corner.
Something was changing. John wanted it to change.
“The Companion thing. How does it work? I mean,” John looked down into his tea, and Sherlock saw the tips of his ears turn red, “I been to a whorehouse but I suspect it ain’t like that.”
As soon as he was aware of the pain from the bullet, Sherlock’s pace began to falter. Disregarding pain was a large part of his life, and he tried to ignore it, but the pain instead began to zigzag through his nervous system in a way he’d never experienced before.
“Of course. I have progressed somewhat since I played Mouse Number Four.”
“Some. But the important one is… said.”
John huffed a grin. “Once, after a particularly good payoff, I blew a wad of credits at a whorehouse on Genae. I was there for a week. Girl there taught it to me.”
Here's how it is: Sherlock gets gussied up for a shindig, and he and John show Persephone something they haven't seen before - and it ain't strawberries.
“About an hour ago. I didn’t want to stop you or interrupt. Are you thinking, then? Trying to work out the McEwan gang still?”
Sherlock was back with them in a moment, along with his mobile. He handed the cuffs to John, and John fixed the chilly metal around the masked man’s wrists. The man was still struggling, and John shifted his weight to pin him down.
He found himself thinking about the way the fairy lights in the sitting room had shone on John’s face, making his hair and eyelashes glow with silver, dancing in his eyes like tiny flames.
“Safe travels,” said the man, and strolled away as Sherlock tucked the postcard in his own pocket.
“Get a saucepan of water simmering – just a simmer, not a boil. Put the bowl over it and melt it slowly, stirring constantly.”
Jim’s hands gentled but stayed firmly around Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock kept his grip on Jim’s hands, each of them entrapping the other. “All right, Sherlock,” he said. “The curtain is still up – for now. But do tell.”
“So I have three other John Watsons in my neighbourhood who might be pissed at me for having a madman wake them up with a wave?”
Now, if John was a real prick, he would have inflated his own role in the case. As it is, I suspect he’s underplaying it. An arsehole would have talked about himself the whole time. I had a date once, a blind date, who talked about himself nonstop for the entire date while I drank myself stupid and said ‘Uh huh’ occasionally. I considered recording myself and just leaving the tape running and doing a runner.
Bahdri shoved a plastic carrier bag into John’s arms, and stepped up to the comp, immediately clicking at the keys. John opened the bag automatically, and saw his tweed suit folded neatly inside.
“Pardon the interruption to your story,” Holmes said smoothly. “I wanted to be sure that my colleague heard your entire tale. Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Riding Thorpe Manor, North Walsham, Norfolk –  Doctor John Watson. Doctor Watson, Mr. Cubitt.”
“No,” Sherlock said, his voice flat and colourless. “Think I’ll have a shower.”
“True, probably just as many, given the geographical sizes of the two cities.”
Rosie seemed delighted with this new environment. She recognized the park for what it was, despite the damage; she had spent a large portion of her life in this park when visiting Sherlock. Sherlock had a flash memory of him and John and Rosie, only a few weeks earlier, walking through The Hub towards the zoo, John laughing about something, and Sherlock had nearly asked John to move in again, right then and there, but hadn’t. He shook his head and banished the memory.
Sherlock frowned – his worlds were colliding again. He would have preferred to be in what he thought of as his detective clothes; the denim and cotton in plain colours would help him fade away. Now, however, dressed in black tie and tails, he was more prominent, more recognizable. No matter.
[They breathe for a moment, then, from a prone position, Sherlock raises his fist in the air.]

Text dialogue. Italics are John, bold is Sherlock.
“Aged forty-nine. 169 centimeters tall. Hair is sandy blond with some grey; eyes deep blue. Doctor. Formerly a soldier, honourably discharged after being wounded in Afghanistan. My flatmate and colleague since 2010. Widower, one daughter aged 26 months and twelve days. Saved my life multiple times, more times than he himself knows. And three hundred and fifty eight days, nine hours and eighteen minutes ago, just after midnight on New Year’s Eve, he kissed me.  He has brought me happiness that I thought was not an option for me. I have been irrevocably changed by him, and I cannot simply
Sherlock could almost hear John’s broad, happy smile behind him. “Um,” he said, clearing his throat. “Well. Starting to drum up business. Look for courier contacts. Ah – get you some clothes, since you can’t wear that purple robe any more.”
Running footsteps came down the corridor. Sherlock turned his head away from Mrs. Hudson and Maja toward the sound.
beaten out of me.”
Sherlock flattened himself and Maja against the wall. From the corner of his eye he could see John try to draw his body up closer to the rope, to lessen the volume of his body in the air.
“This was not how I was anticipatin’ my evening to go,” John said. “I figured, drink or two, find a cuddle if I was lucky. I see one fella getting the
“Yup. Your turn.”
“Mrs. Hudson lives here too,” Sherlock said. “In the downstairs flat. In fact she owns the building.”
Sherlock slid down John’s body and took his prick into his mouth. John was already half hard, but stiffened immediately inside Sherlock’s mouth. John let out a string of swear words in multiple languages, and Sherlock smiled around his cock. He slid up and down, tortuously slow, enjoying the heft and bulk of John in his mouth.
Trigger warning for personality dissociation (reminder that this is based in science fiction, not medical science)
The General stood, the lines in his face relaxing. Sherlock stayed seated. His head tilted to the side, considering.
John nodded, and he seemed to be accepting Sherlock’s new attitude with that nod. He gestured to the woman. “My wife, Maja.”
“Sherlock?” John said. “Love? What happened? Where’d you go?”
“You know what they want to do?” she said. She was still looking at the television, watching Sherlock dance. “After your performance? They won’t keep you in Serbia. They’ll ship you somewhere else, likely someplace in Russia. Oh yes, there’s still an Iron Curtain of sorts. Performances for the political elite, idiots who wouldn’t know a
“Why?” Sherlock felt a hot ball form in his chest. “How is that your business?”
I bow, grab my coat, and head over to John and Sherlock’s table. John puts on his coat, chuckling, while Sherlock throws some notes on the table. I notice that it’s enough for their meal, and mine, but not Wanker’s. I point at the notes.
John laughed, and they both began to prowl around the rabbit warren of desks and cabinets.
He stands, and turns to John and Sherlock, and visibly pulls himself together. “Gentlemen, I think I should go. I hope you believe me when I say I haven’t heard from my brother in many years, and from what you say, I think I never will again.”
I could do with a good squaring away, then we shake hands at the door and all’s well.
“Shut up,” he said, and put another five pounds into the grinning man’s hand.
“Yes,” John said. “Sherlock-”
“What? He’s in
“Okay,” John said slowly. “How do I do that though? I haven’t the first clue.”
. I was in jail. I just walked in the door. I-”
I suppose what I want everyone to take away from this is - stay hopeful. Protect. Be smart. Find your community. Love.
“Oh, not to worry, I’m friends with all the local crack junkies. We have supper parties sometimes, borrow an egg, that kind of thing.” He laughs, that’s good, laughing is good. “But I will accept the offer, thanks.”
“Quite right,” Holmes said. “You listened to his heart, heard his aneurysm. I doubt he’ll live to see his trial.”
The ride back to the flat was silent, as it usually was. John was staring out the window, his hand gripping the head of his cane. Sherlock glanced at him briefly, wanting desperately to drink in the sight of him for minutes, hours, but forced himself to turn away and look out his own window. They had to be more careful than ever now.
It was impossible, it was wrong for John to be uneasy showing Sherlock his bunk, so Sherlock showed him how all right it was by tumbling them both into it.
“Yes, you are,” Sherlock said, and John’s head snapped back to him, incredulity on his face.
“Eat. It.”
He had known he would be happy to have John back at Baker Street, but his pleasure at Rosie’s presence as well was a surprise. He enjoyed the light feeling in his heart when she smiled or laughed, which became positively dazzling when she directed those expressions at Sherlock. He liked the heft of her weight in his arms when he carried her. And he loved the serious look on her face when he talked to her.
Sherlock knew an evasion when he saw one. “As I said, I started at four. Someone saw promise in me, and my parents got me into the right schools. Got into the Royal Ballet School at ten.”
“And he loves you too,” I say to John. He looks like he’s been hit by a lorry. “He’s afraid of losing you, so he doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t-”
Contemps = used as slang in the Connie Willis books for 'contemporary', or a person living in the era you're visiting.
Her chin lifted in a way that was ghostly familiar; it was clear in that moment whose child she was. “Wanna go see Daddy,” she repeated, and even her tone was like John’s – mulish and with an undertone of pure anger.
He hoped not. He bent over the corpse and, just for now, forced his emotions at bay.
Sherlock saw Pavlović speak briefly to the soldier outside the door, then the small window was blocked by the soldier’s head, blocking the sunlight.
When Mum died, I wondered what would happen with all the love I had for her. Boo offered to take it, but then she died too. Then I tried to love him, and he loved me, but it couldn’t go anywhere. There was so much love bouncing around inside me, lost.
“Well, a bit, yes. But initially I just wanted to kill you.”
Jim’s hand began to rub Sherlock’s belly in hypnotic circles. “Come on, Sherlock. Best Companion on Persephone? Gorgeous and intelligent to boot? Why kill you when I could just make you mine?”
“You had me at ‘aquarium’,” John said. “I love fish and that. I just had to talk himself into coming down.”
John nodded, once. His head dipped, and for a brief moment, he rested his forehead on Sherlock’s bare collarbone.
“Excellent idea,” Sherlock said. “And now – I believe we had just begun an experiment?”
John’s pencil stilled again. He could barely see the page before him, gone blurry in the light of the fire and the impact of Sherlock’s words. Sherlock had bared his body and his mind, made himself vulnerable in every way, all so John would see him. How could he possibly respond to this?
“Don’t act so surprised.” Sherlock lay down on the sofa, his feet propped up on the arm, not caring for the upholstery. “What about the fellow outside? Hm? You think he’s a concierge? Try walking out that door to buy milk and you’ll find out in a hurry what he’s there for. And did you not notice that the car had no handles on the inside? They didn’t want to take the risk of my leaping out into traffic.”
One more chapter - an epilogue of sorts. Will publish New Year's Eve.
Splash splash splash, and a chortle of joy.
He turned to Jen, but she shrugged as well. “No idea. I’ve been here two hours, they pulled me out three days early. Michael was here before me, though.”
In his wildest dreams, John had always imagined himself being nervous, his hands shaking when he and Sherlock would stand before each other like this. But to his surprise, his hands were steady and his voice calm as he reached for his top button on his shirt.
? Just you and me.”
“No wonder the man never leaves his rooms,” John said. “He must be terrified of burglars.”
“Just a pretend tent, in here,” Sherlock replied. “But for now, we’ll play another game. Can you help me find all the red tins in this pile?”
“Good God,” John murmured beside him. He looked up at Sherlock. “Are you – are you hungry?”
“All right now?” John said.
Sherlock was amazed to see the man who had just faced down two brutal thugs twice his size, shudder.
He landed, absorbing the shock through the bend of his legs. Almost immediately he jumped again, straight up, using momentum to spin a complete circle twice before landing. He could hear gasps from the audience. It made him want to smirk, thinking of what was in store for them, that he was only just beginning; but he kept his face framed in lines of the grief and ennui of his character.
Oddly, John was becoming used to the note of disappointment when women learned he had a child. Even more oddly, he wasn’t even offended any more.
Sherlock craned his head around to look at John. “So did you. You were there too. Why aren’t you?”
– Office of the Artistic Director. Janina was sitting behind her desk, going through costume sketches.
“We have acquired a rehearsal studio for your use,” Pavlović said. “A car will take you there tomorrow at nine in the morning. Ah!” he said as the driver came through the door, carrying John and Maja’s suitcases. “There we are, all settled. And Mr. Holmes, we were able to recover your luggage from the plane.”
“Brother mine,” Sherlock said softly.
“All right, Sherlock. Be careful,” Mycroft said, and he sounded exactly how he used to sound when they were boys, when he sent Sherlock off to school, or when Sherlock was going for a walk on the estate.
“Do you need to bandage your leg?” Holmes said. His voice was measured.
His voice had been casual, almost friendly before; disarming. But now, abruptly, it was cold and devoid of empathy. The gun wasn’t even pointed at him but Sherlock felt a rill of fear run down his neck. He watched in fascination as a similar shock passed through his attacker.
And if the group was not to Sherlock’s liking, he could leave again.
“Is that everyone?” Lassiter said imperiously.
“No.”
“Where were you born?”
He swam and swam until he lost all sense of time. His limbs were feeling heavier, and his silken robes were dragging him down. He tried to get out of the robes, but the knotted ties gripped hard and would not loosen. He swam on.
Sherlock stood, and placed the violin under his chin. It was smaller than the violin John had seen him play before, no doubt because it was for a child to play, but that didn’t seem to matter to Sherlock. A few quick plucks of the string determined that the violin was in tune. Sherlock’s posture changed, and John could nearly see the suit jacket disappear and be replaced with black tie and tails.
look after her.”
“Ah, Holmes
Looking down, he saw that he had left a smear of blood on the ground. He leaned over and splashed some of the water around, hoping it would look as though he had gone into the fountain. Then he carefully covered the wound with his jacket again, and went to the south side of the fountain. Another splash of water, and he wiped his bloody hand against the edge. Holding the jacket tightly against his side, he darted west. There was a row of thick hedges lining the area, and he crept in, hiding himself until he was surrounded with greenery.
at me.”
Sherlock Holmes.”
Holmes’ hand moved rapidly, filling in letters, and talking constantly about the logic of solving the code. It reminded John of the crosswords his grandmother had been fond of – though she had done them on her tablet with a letterpen.
He ran full speed after Holmes, wondering what Holmes was thinking, but it was clear that their conversation had triggered something. He pulled up at 221B just as Holmes was opening the door, and they both clattered up the stairs. Mrs. Hudson was in the hallway, holding a tea tray, and nearly dropped it in surprise when they ran past.
"A hundred things a thousand things. It's hard to explain. I feel like I have to make up for everything that I'm not doing for you, everything I can't or haven't done. Or did do. Worries, frustrations with myself, feeling...inadequate, stresses about the day. Anxious. I just feel anxious. You know, that sensation of when you're just about to fall asleep, you're right on the edge and suddenly you jerk back into consciousness? You don't know why it happens but...it's terrifying and you spend the next 20 minutes just trying to calm your heart rate and try again. I used to know the name of it...we talked about it ages ago in med school."
"Is there anything I can do?" Sherlock asked at the same time John defensively blurted; "It's quite real, by the way. Nothing psychosomatic this go round."
"No, I mean are you willing to talk. Are you talking to him?"
He watched, shivering as Sherlock walked away and got into the waiting car. He didn't turn to go back to the facility until the brake lights faded into the darkness.
You are and have always been the most important person in my life. Before Mary and after Mary I wanted something more with you. Something deeper. Something I was too cowardly to ask for despite all the times I promised.
The voice was fast, brittle and dripping with insincerity. Most of the times he'd handled the press he'd been with Sherlock and they were always more interested in the detective. He didn't like playing second fiddle but in those cases, he was fine with Sherlock assuming the limelight. It wasn't something he was after or needed.
He looked at her, saw the sincerity and immediately felt bad.
"Books? As in plural?"
Sherlock blanched and swallowed hard. He threw a quick glance back toward his parent's house and scowled.
When he was a boy, living in that house with his sister and their terrible father there had been this leak in the living room. Right in the corner was this brownish spot. It was coming from one of the pipes that ran to the tub and his father, who wasn't in the least bit handy was forced to "mend" it every now and then. Mending it basically involved banging on the pipe for a bit and then wrapping it with plumbers tape. But of course, the leak always came back. There was no set schedule, no way to predict it. It was just one day you realized that that dry brown spot looked more vibrant because it wasn't dry anymore, it was wet. Really wet. And on top of that, the spot looked bigger. And on top of that, the arm of the chair that sat below the spot was damp because it had been leaking tap-tap-tap right down onto it. And you realized you'd heard the tap-tap-tap for awhile but you'd ignored it. And now you worried just how much unseen damage it had done and how much longer you could have ignored it and whether it's too late and everything you knew is going to cave in on top of you. Or...whether it can be passably patched and jury-rigged and you could go on pretending there was no longer a problem. For awhile, at least.
"Sherlock, no, your brother is not going to call me."
“I never called.The neighbours did every now and then.”
My eyes widened. I couldn't quite believe what he'd said.
"Always here...thinking I don't see you." He slurred.
"I'm not going to deny it," John said wearily. "It would pretty stupid at this point."
John's heart nearly stopped working when he noticed the man sitting casually in his chair in the living room. The man was, of course, Sherlock.
still want to exist."
"Alcoholism...maybe some other things. Maybe depression."
"John..." He said quietly and John felt those eyes roaming over him. They lingered on his face, no doubt making complicated calculations and estimations unimaginable.
Sherlock was silent for a moment. Then another. And another. And another. His head was lowered and he appeared to be concentrating deeply on the game. John was looking only at the crown of his curly head.
John had hoped they'd have ended this first night with two new allies to their still new, still fresh relationship.
They'd given him his phone and he'd immediately gone to the Daily Mail to have his worst fears confirmed.
"Want me to stop?"
I think this entire charade is bullshit but here we are, I was asked to write a letter to you so I will.
And then his body was flush with mine, I could feel his thighs pressed against me and I opened my eyes, forgetting they been closed this entire time.
"I got to Baker Street, she was, of course, ok, thank God and then I realized you'd played me for a fool again."
"I changed my mind, Sherlock, make me come."
Perhaps he shouldn't have followed him. But by the time this thought caught up to John he had crept to the bathroom door and was listening quietly.
"Of course you don't Sherlock, you've always had it. People who have money never think it's that important. For god sakes, you had an ancestral seat." He said letting the plate clatter in the sink. "Don't think I missed that little fact about Musgrave Hall. You do realize that not everyone in the world has an
history, a fairly recent Section on his records, a stint in rehab and losing his job only hours ago because of a failed drug test that would most certainly be it. He'd lose his license. He would no longer be a doctor. And whether he was absolutely in love with practicing medicine or not he realized, in that moment, being a doctor did mean something to him. It actually meant quite a lot.
"Well. Easily. I believe you have the wrong idea about my parents, John. It's not your fault, everyone does. Just because they appear to have mastered the social norms, the joviality of human interaction, its natural give and take, does not mean it came or comes naturally to them. Mycroft and I...and likely even Eurus, we
"Speaking of work, I thought today was your day off?"
"And we didn't-"
"And you're not a slave to this?"
"The dishes will never get done this way." He murmured.
"Exclusive sounds expensive. I couldn't afford a place like that even if I wanted to go. Which I don't." He said.
"Well, she was right to."
"Just a lot of nonsense. I've mostly been deleting."
"You know, Greg might have a point. If we're going to be doing that we might want to start closing the door. You know, having clients knock. No need to scandalize." John said.
"For awhile...nothing. I...felt directionless. I didn't have an appetite, I couldn't sleep. A part of me hoped he might still show up, change his mind, take me with him. I discreetly asked around about him but nobody had heard anything. I think I was the only person he'd bothered to offer a goodbye to. That mattered I guess."
"Work. I've been out of the country recently working and it helps to keep me right." He sighed as if debating on whether or not to add something else and John looked at him with interest. "Occasionally I have dropped by to see Ella. Usually when I've been having nightmares."
He clamped his mouth shut and looked away. But this time it wasn't out of embarrassment, rather shame.
"You're enjoying this." He seethed.
Sherlock's warm thighs on either side of him, Sherlock's hips tilted up towards him, Sherlock's body beneath his, Sherlock's cock pressed firm and hard between them. It was heavenly.
"Fuck The Location. Are you so posh now? Some regular facility isn't good enough for His Nibs? Check yourself into a residential place and get your shit sorted."
"It's alright dear. I understand."
"I was worried about you, John. Worried and useless. This past year I...I didn't know what to do."
Taking out his laptop, he woke it from sleep and opened an ever-growing document file.
Well, he was effectively caught now. He supposed he could at least make an attempt at playing it cool.
The former broke away only for a moment to say. "I like my own taste just fine, apparently."
"Oh..oh...God, ohhhh Sherlock...yesssss..."
"That's very merry of you." John said with a laugh before resting one hand in Sherlock's hair and the other on his chest. "Love?"
She was 15 months old. 15 months old and she was lovely and he told Harry so.
Without reservation, I loved my wife. There are only three feelings I have left concerning Mary; love, grief, and guilt."
John could feel Sherlock tense at his side as he too was looking anxiously at the phone.
"It was?" John said happily, hopefully.
The response was so immediate and so sustained for a moment he thought the notices on his phone were broken. Ding after ding after ding after ding that he gathered was alerting him to a reply.
"You've got a crumb just right here." he said pointing to the corner of his mouth before placing a kiss there.
"Well, there wasn't much more I never knew how to follow it up after you came in my mouth in the cab."
"We are?" Sherlock replied skeptically.
"Does it also interrupt your sleep?"
"I am so sorry for everything you went through long before we ever met. And I am so sorry for all the panic and pain I've caused you."
"Yeah, a few." James laughed. "I did see him at a few group meetings though, always in the back. Quiet like, a bit broody looking."
John leaned in and kissed him. It was rather quick as he wasn't certain Sherlock could handle much more. The kiss was returned in kind and then his partner simply embraced him. He felt his body shudder for a moment and again wanted to press on and figure out just what had frightened him so badly. Why had he changed his mind? But he imagined all would be revealed in its own time. Or at least he hoped.
I read your
"You haven't been able to engage in masturbation or intercourse for over a year?"
I am angry because I feel frustrated and trapped here.
"Goodnight, John." Came the voice from within. It already sounded a little far away.
Once it was lit John set the candle down and slowly brought his partner in for a kiss. Thankfully if not surprisingly he came willingly. Their lips touched, the taste a mix of fresh tobacco, smoke, and tears.
"Um...as I expected it to go. It was a chance to tell him to piss off, I suppose."
He was reluctant to pull away but as Sherlock softened in his mouth he also began calling for him.
But John shook his head fervently.
"Yes, yes that is an absolute yes. I don't know how to thank you. I mean, I will pay you of course."
“Can you tell me why?”
"I love you, John." He said before doing as was asked. They kissed softly, breathlessly, desperately. While John didn't hear the lube being opened he did feel the liquid as it was drizzled from the base of his balls to flow between his arse cheeks.
"I was angry. I
"And from that, I'm meant to glean that men are?"
"I'm sorry, who is they?"
He was remarkably clear-headed for a reason he couldn't understand but he wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
"I don't recall telling you I was newly out of the closet," John said.
It felt good to be gathered. He'd been so scattered, such a collection of disparate pieces, like a thousand different puzzles all dumped together in a pile. And he'd been tasked with making sense of the mess made, the mess he'd made. He started to piece himself back together, bits of sky and treeline, the outlines of a self, a person, a life, until finally, he could start to fill in the middle. The meat of it all. The lungs to breathe, the heart to feel, the skin to touch and be touched, the soul to stretch and to grow and to crave the extraordinary. He'd come back to Sherlock, hat in hand, still missing pieces but more of a man than when he left. He'd tried to come back to his life, a fractured creature of misplaced shapes. And he'd broken apart,
It was early yet. There was time. He needed to adjust.
"I wanted to blow things up. Or maybe I just wanted to bring them to a head. I wanted something I couldn't have. I wanted to have my cake and eat it too. I wanted to gorge. I wanted both halves. I was so greedy. Fuck."
"Just one second, we also have for you the Surrender coin. This is something everybody gets once they make a commitment to surrender their lives to working through their addiction and toward their sobriety. We've all been where you are now, Amy, and we're happy you're here. Again, let's give her a hand."
Quietly he peeked in on Sherlock one last time and found him sound asleep. He was all but buried underneath the covers only a few stray, dark curls were visible. Good, that was good, he wanted him to get some rest. John tip-toed over and placed a kiss atop his head.
"I feel depressed as fuck...truthfully."
"Ok, I got it. I said all that and yes, it's true and yes we still didn't. You make it sound like a crime."
"Am I kind in your fantasy?"
Greg nudged past him and John heard the customer service smile in his voice as he addressed the chemist.
"It's not new age, it may be folksy at best but it's still true. You're in charge of this, John, you always have been. Now, what do you want to do?"
"Why do you care?"
John kissed him again, sweetly, softly muffling some of his lovers cries. God, he loved how vocal Sherlock was. At times he even seemed a bit chatty and there was nothing John loved better than a talkative lover.
'Sorry, should we stop? Am I getting you all worked up?" He asked with concern.
"Bedroom."
I love her.
"After Carl Powers died. Not directly after but...I knew I was onto something with his case. I was close. But I couldn't solve it. I couldn't make it work and it infuriated me. But there was something else. I was 13 and it was the first time in my life I could recall being stimulated by something. It was the first time I felt alive. I started scanning local newspapers, then national, then international, looking for cases, unsolved murders, mysterious disappearances. I kept a notebook to log all the information about the cases I could find and discern and those became my great experiments. They captivated me. I didn't think about the people. They didn't mean much to me but I was obsessed with the puzzles their lives presented. Sometimes I would try and call the police stations and tell them of my findings but they never listened. All they ever heard was a child on the other end of the line. One day Mycroft found my notebook. I was so worried he was going to proclaim it a waste of time or tell our parents but instead, he decided it was a good exercise. I so looked up to him that when he asked if he might serve as an adviser and proctor I leaped at the chance. My brother is...smarter than I could ever hope to be. But for God sakes don't tell him I said that. He was helpful in guiding me, in sharpening my methods, my thought processes, my observation and analytical abilities. "Narrow it down." He would say to me. "Narrow it down." Eventually, I did. Eventually, the two of us, both in our spare time, were solving cases all over the world, though no one knew. That was sufficient for more than a few years. But soon Mycroft went into government and no longer had time for me. Plus I was just about to enter Uni and that changed things as well."
be checking the inbox on our honeymoon. He thought he was going to be but has since been set straight on that issue.
John was suddenly taken by the overwhelming need to see Sherlock's cock and he wasn't disappointed. He was leaking precum in long, clear, sticky rivulets. Beaded, streams ran freely from the tip and when one ended another soon followed culminating into a relatively speaking large and growing damp spot on the sheets.
"Enough. I know you're hurting. I know. But he...you...the two of you, you make things so complicated all the time. I'm not sending you to sit with him just because he needs it, even though he does. Even those he's too stupid and stubborn to ask. I'm sending you because you need it. You're drifting away, John. We're standing on the shore and you're just floating farther and farther away."
"Yes, sorry. Was that what you asked me?"
He didn't call it cold turkey. He never let the words even enter his mind because to do so would admit this was something he needed to stop. Instead, it was a break. He could take a break. He was allowed to take a bloody break.
"Yes, well it's different to give advice at The Location which is far afield from Baker Street. Maybe everything she and I planned...won't exactly work here."
“I started off thinking that if I just did the right thing, said the right thing. Made sure the house was clean and dinner was made and the beer was cold and Harry was quiet then things would be alright. I learned that wasn’t true. I adjusted accordingly.”
"Does it count if I've only ever fancied one, sorry, two men?"
Could he really will himself better in these areas? Only time would tell, he supposed.
"I'd like that a lot, actually. I don't have many friends when it really comes down to it."
"Nor do I. John, that was a brilliant deduction."
stopped his train of thought. When John truly looked the flat was surprisingly different. The endless packages of plastic utensils sealed in more plastic are gone. John opened a drawer and saw they had been replaced by silverware. Actual silverware. Heavy as shit and lovely to boot. Sherlock must have gotten them from his mum. The takeaway containers that littered the counter and essentially every free space in the flat were gone. He opened the fridge and freezer to discover them scoured clean. There were actual, proper containers now, stacked neatly on shelves. The sink was empty and gleaming. The table top while still a shade cluttered with his experiments and equipment had clearly been wiped down.
"Yeah on the floor under the towel rack. Got it."
John leaned back against the bedroom wall and took in the view before him. His boyfriend was holding his daughter in his lap with the practiced care of a parent. She was busying herself with the button and buttonhole on the sleeve of his shirt. She looked drowsy, relaxed and content. She was obviously completely used to Sherlock, she trusted him, she knew he wouldn't hurt her or leave her.
Then the four of them.
"Yes, John. Anything you say, John."
Everyone, well everyone who wanted to, was volunteering a story where they recently got angry or lost their temper. In their struggles and stories, John heard himself. It resonated. It got in. And for the first time in a long time, surrounded by a bunch of strangers he began to relax.
"No, not at all." He responded and John let out a short bark of laughter. He wasn't wrong.
"Christ, Hanah, I thought I'd come out of here with more answers than questions but it's not looking that way. I...I don't know if I can face this without you."
"I...I'll just be glad to have you home. I'm lost without my blogger. I'm lost..."
Long story short, it didn't feel a damn thing like this.
As he watched him disappear down the hall, John picked up his bags.
"You're gay?" John asked in disbelief.
"Yeah, oh, sorry."
"Morose, depressed, unfocused, unreachable...untethered. His thinking became scattered, careless. He didn't want to admit it, of course, but I knew he noticed when he casually began mentioning his cases to me."
"Why are you here right now?" He said glancing up to see her standing against the wall by his side.
"I feel that same anger at...at the people who hurt you." He said not quite saying all that he wanted.
I've never told anyone that in my life. Not anyone."
"Did you ever talk to him about it? Duck, I mean." Sherlock asked.
John closed his eyes for a moment, trying to digest what exactly had happened. What was happening. He was willing to hear him out and half hoped and assumed Sherlock might knock on his door, if not chagrined then at least willing to talk and explain. But he didn't knock. He didn't seem as though he were coming at all. The trip had left him uncomfortable, stiff and sweaty. Sighing heavily he again got to his feet and with a change of clothes in hand headed to the shower.
Nothing in recent memory tasted as good as that first shot and he tried not to groan as it smoldered in his mouth and then ignited a fire on the way down his throat. He could pretend. He could chant the mantras. He could carry around the Big Book. But he missed this. By God, he missed how every ritualistic moment of this felt and before the first one was really gone he was pouring himself another one.
When he'd said he wasn't tired unbeknownst to him John had been lying. He didn't realize this until he awakened as Sherlock pulled into the gravel drive of a house.
John, unable to watch turned and faced Molly.
"No, sounds pretty offensive, you know? My feelings for you put me in mind of nuclear disaster second in catastrophic nature only to Fukushima. Not terribly romantic."
"I was going to. When Harry initially told me she wasn't going to show I figured I had more time to ease you into it. I didn't want it to blow up in your face like this."
"Go on." She encouraged.
"John, what is the worst that can happen to people if you don't push people away? If you let them see you, warts and all?"
Sherlock placed a kiss to the warm flesh and then another and another.
His father hit him hard in the back and his knees buckled, slamming into the linoleum floor tiles. He tried to scramble to his feet but a kick sent him over onto his side. He knocked into the stove disturbing the pot full of noodles on top which then fell wetly onto the floor. There was a small space between the stove and the wall and as a child he'd scooted in there many a time. It was just out of his father's reach and he could usually ward him off with kicks to the shin until the sot got tired.
He kept the phone steady but let his head thump back against the wall behind his bed.
"Is it important to you that I believe you, John?"
As he obliged, pistoning hips driving them toward orgasm he watched Sherlock redden, watched the colour spread from his clavicle, up his neck, across his cheeks. He watched his eyes shut and his mouth open. He watched his teeth grit for a moment before he groaned, lips and teeth parting as keened, rocked and clenched around John. As he'd promised him it appeared hard and delicious and so worth the wait. And the only thing better than watching Sherlock come was coming himself and enjoying the little tremors and jolts that still wracked his body as he thrust into him.
He washed the dishes.
"Not so far. You?"
"Indeed. Actually, the almost-boyfriend
." Sherlock said with disbelief.
"I said, as you no doubt clearly heard, does medicine make you happy? I can't recall a time where you ever expressed any joy in your profession. You take joy in our work, that I've seen and could draw a picture of if asked. But I've never seen you refer to your work with anything exceeding a blank expression. So, I say again, do you enjoy being a doctor?"
. This splatter of rough sound hitting asphalt, that scrape as it grinds across your ears and your brain.
"Hmm?" He asked, staring up at the ceiling.
. And it wasn't one-sided either. They both now knew and when he set foot into Baker Street again it would be with that assurance that the last secret between them was revealed.
So would I. Glad it's settled.
"Least I could do." John replied.
"This isn't about faith, mate. There's nothing in our flat. I got rid of it all."
Any debt I owed you is paid in full. And to view a receipt just go to Mary's grave and read her headstone.
Thank you, as always, for reading, reviewing, and reccing. You're all lovely. :)
It was hard to write that sentence but it was better than receiving the spirit-crushing reply of
In-control Sherlock, even in the old days, even in a completely non-sexual way made him feel like he'd touched a live wire. Ok...perhaps it was always a little sexual, but still. And now, hearing him saying that while being so close to his cock and knowing he wouldn't so much as touch it right now was enough to drive him a bit mad. Not thinking about what he'd like to do to him, but what he'd like to have done. But instead of saying all of that or any of that, he'd only let his head thunk back to the pillow and said "Shit."
"No, I don't believe she could."
Taking his time John rose from his seat and walked over to his partner enjoying the wide-eyed, desperate look he was greeted with.
"Why intense?"
"Turtle." She said clearly.
"Poor, Johnny." She said as she hugged him back.
"What? What isn't?"
John knew Sherlock was frustrated, but perhaps more than that he was confused. Likely adding to this was the fact that John was still affectionate. They still touched and hugged and kissed but as for anything sexual, he had effectively retreated.
I reached behind me, grabbing the pillows as he'd asked.
“Are you saying that everyone here isn’t what they seem. That the coked up woman I
"You mean it this time." He said as he pulled his head back and it wasn't a question but a statement. John wasn't sure exactly what he was referring to but he just nodded in agreement.
Thankfully those thoughts only tend to surface at night.
He felt it happen but his disbelieving mind didn't quite register it even after Sherlock arched away from his touch.
"Sherlock, oh God, I'm gonna come. Please don't stop."
"I was. Until I thought about it. And I'm sorry, John, but I'm not your conscience, I'm your tell-tale heart and I won't be here for much longer."
"I love you, John." He whispered nuzzling his face.
But you became this fixture in our lives, in my life.
"Why he wouldn't he be, John?"
I suppose I get his meaning. It's all well and good to say recovery is a continuing process. But it's a whole other thing to mean it and live it. I'm not sure I was doing that the last time. Alright, I know I wasn't.
The door to her office opened and Frank wordlessly stepped in, grabbed the waste bin from his hands and exited.
He could describe it as something that took his mind off the clawing need for a drink. And that was true as well.
He had a toothache in that molar that was always giving him trouble.
"You just need time, and you and I have all the time in the world. Rest, Sherlock. Do the one thing you've never been very good at and rest."
It was different than he expected, sensation wise. Where his hands had decades of expecting curves there was now straight lines. Where he anticipated softness, there was instead the firm and the solid. A chest, muscular but compared to the women he'd been with flat when pressed against his. A hand, large with artistic fingers moved dexterously through his hair.
"Is that-?
"The one with Kevin McCarthy or Donald Sutherland?"
"If there's too much you might not feel me as well."
Watson and come again?" John said with a shake of his head.
"And sadder than usual as well. Haven't you noticed?" She asked him and there was just a bit of accusation in her tone, barely detectable to those unfamiliar with the subtle motherly craftiness of the landlady.
"Yes, but it's the principle of the thing."
"The rumors always said you were having it off with Sherlock, is that true?"
She beamed understanding if not his words then his tone.
Alright, I'm not...I'm going now.
So, with those two texts sent he sat and he waited and he waited and he waited.
His life was tied together like that now. Bundled up with cello tape, wires, strings, ropes, all of it binding him up like a scarecrow. He was stuffed full with the scraps and shreds of his old life. His insides had been scooped out, weighed and discarded. He had been autopsied alongside Mary. She had gone into the ground and he'd been sent on his way. He was an effigy of John Watson. An unconvincing dummy who wasn't fooling anyone, least of all himself.
"Ok." He replied against his better judgment.
But Sherlock cut himself off and instead dashed toward the house, John suspected, to drop off the bag and interrogate his mum.
"You'll hardly know I'm gone. Next time, I want to drizzle honey all over that cock of yours before I put it in my mouth. Then again, I imagine it's just as delicious unadorned." He tossed back easily over his shoulder smiling at the gasp he heard behind him before shutting the door.
bullet that finally got me my entire life."
"It's all yours." He said quietly, shyly and I figured he'd taken some time to think about what had happened.
"I am
"Well, it looks as though family weekend has been extended. The roads are impassable and the flights are grounded. We're snowed in."
"Just a moment. Please, wait just a moment." He said, hurrying toward the bedroom. "Can you follow me?"
“I finished it. The whole thing.”
John was too big a risk.
He felt so ashamed his eyes started to burn with tears.
"That's what I thought. John, I want you to start journaling again."
Instead, he heard his voice, farther away than it should be but rather insistent.
"Massage is just the tactile application of pressure and the manipulation of the anatomy, specifically certain muscle groups with alternating focus and pressure."
"The first time I slept with you, just slept at your side at The Location, I knew I'd never know another nights peace unless I made my permanent place there."
"Not exactly, I just don't really like the way I feel on meds. Well, I imagine I wouldn't like the way I feel on them."
"Good. I'll have some papers for you to sign at the end. But first, I just need some basic information. Employer name?"
"That great and very important."
"You tried to off yourself. Saw it on the news. Not so easy is it?" Another man said.
"I understand."
"John and James, ten more and we could have a full set of Apostles, eh?" James said.
The horror I still feel now as I think of how close I may have come to being too late.
"So he was your deepest relationship at that time. Your only relationship."
John was touched, touched that he saw him in Rosie and touched that he never, ever forgot about Mary. It meant a lot. It meant everything.
He'd lost the narrative thread to sex somewhere along the way, he knew that now. He knew something was missing. God knows that was what they told him in rehab and counseling and groups. Something is missing and you need to get it back. But they can never tell you what it is because it's just uniquely you. Which is as promising as it is insanely frustrating. How did he know what he was searching for when they couldn't tell him and he couldn't remember.
"I honestly don't know. I don't expect this to help me, I don't even know if I want it to help me. But it may help my best friend...my emergency contact...we used to be best friends, at least."
Words were life and words were goodbye and the both kept flowing from her lips. All he wanted to do was stem the tide. Please don't waste them. Please, love, please. Please.
"What's that?"
He berated himself for taking so long to have even thought this.
But on the other hand, wasn't that exactly what he
They both broke into peals of laughter at both the ridiculousness and happiness of the situation. Warm, intimate laughter that only they shared.
"Yes."
He always asked that and John sighed and gave him the standard answer.
"Who LEFT ME TO DROWN in a well next to the bones of your former best friend! Is this at all ringing any bells with you? And I know what you're going to say because I left you wide open for it. What about Mary? What's the difference? Well, let me tell you the difference, everything. Mary and I were in the open. I never went behind your back saying one thing while omitting the truth only to pop up months later to announce; Guess what? I've mended fences with the woman who nearly killed you! Sure hope you're alright with that!"
"To you, perhaps." He said and I said tried to control my frustration. "John," he said with surprising patience. "Gay is a very large umbrella and to my understanding means that you would be open to romantic and/or sexual relationships with men. I'm not particularly interested in whether or not you want to have sex with other men. Perhaps, academically, I'd like to explore the topic at some point, but not now. Right now, all that matters is whether or not you feel affection towards me, are attracted to and would like to have sex with me."
"Oh I know precisely who I'm dealing with and I'll repeat my words from earlier. You love this. You love being the hero. Not much call for it in Afghanistan. At least not as much as you had hoped. We've never talked about that have we, John? Just why you joined the Army. Oh you may be running away from things now but you were running
"The um...I..." Why was this all suddenly so embarrassing. Maybe because every suggestion, every conversation somehow lead back to recover or recovery issues. He hoped this wouldn't be what life was like from now on. "She diagnosed me with PTSD and part of exposure therapy is to..well, expose myself to situations and sounds that cause me stress." Before he could ask more John connected the dots. "The open floor plan of it all, the way the voices all merge together, the clanging of the silverware...that kind of thing."
"Harry, all the books say a clean break. Prolonging the goodbye only agitates the child." Sherlock said gently but firmly pushing her out the door.
John had even made it once because engagement or no engagement he wanted to keep up his talks with Eric. But soon upon returning, the warmth and allure of Sherlock, still wrapped sleeping in their covers drew him back.
"I can assure you this isn't an ambush, John. It will only be attended by a few friends all with the best of intentions. I'd be feeling the same way were it me. But we'll grin and bear it together and know they mean well no matter what they might say."
"Respectfully...no." he said.
"Yeah, I don't mind. Not now, not today." He said settling back in his chair and closed his laptop. "When can we get your ring?"
"John, I cannot do this without you." Sherlock said and the pain and shock in his eyes was more than John could bear to witness.
"Fine, John. Nothing to worry about."
"How so?"
When he was done and had placed the device back in his pocket John took his gloved hand and held it.
"No, put your hands on me. Keep them on me."
"Good."
"Yeah, I can assure you I have no intention of trolling gay bars for dates. I only want you. No one else."
"My leg. It was like, right as the shoulder was starting to heal and I was getting my mobility back, everything was working, everything felt fine I got the news. They wanted me to be assessed before the medical board. I'd been permanently downgraded and they were recommending discharge."
"I want you to think about it after our session today. We're going to come back to it tomorrow. Now, the letter to your dad, how did that go?"
But it's not. It's about your fucking timing.
John looked to Sherlock who appeared just as surprised as he was.
"I wasn't sleeping with Duck and I wasn't sleeping with Sherlock."
So he looked up because it was pretty and because James had asked him to.
It had started to snow a little after he left the pub and he brushed off the thin coating of flakes that were gathered on the grave.
But he also didn't like the idea of Sherlock being so torn. Or worse yet, thinking that he had to stay away from them solely because of him. John wanted him to keep a healthy distance from his parents, that was true. But because Sherlock himself wanted it. Not for fear of upsetting his partner.
"You ok? Want me to stop? I can, John."
Still, even with the cloud cover, there were places where John could look up and see strips of the sky. Black and quiet and full of stars.
"Well, I wasn't going to go over every moment. Every tedious fight."
"Yes! The way you looked on the first day of med school. This thin veneer of I'm-so-sure-of-myself covering up the reality that you were terrified. I liked you straight away. Just like I liked him. I even mentioned you once to him, ages and ages before you came back from Afghanistan but he likely doesn't remember. Told him, I had a friend that put me in mind of him. He replied "I doubt that very much." So of course when I was fortunate enough to bump into you I decided to put you two up together."
He bristled at that. He didn't need taking care of and tending to like a frightened poodle.
His mate wavered for a bit, he wasn’t used to giving up control and certainly not this kind of control. Despite or perhaps because of being ex-Army he naturally balked at orders being given, but this time he grudgingly agreed.
"Do you really know or did you just get me to tell you?" He asked after a pause.
"You remember that?"
He scoffed in reply but she continued unfazed.
"Yeah, that's great. Glad you liked them. So, um, he didn't say where he was going?"
good at it? "Now come back here, I just needed to catch my breath but it's back now."
"My offer still stands. Come back to our home." He said looking at him hopefully.
"We promise, have a lovely evening with Clara, everything is fine here, good night, Harry." He said in a rush and locked the door tightly.
"Mmhmm, I heard all about it at lunch the other day. The bird said that she knew someone who had been here way back when it first opened. It was much harsher back then. And this guy had been accused of smuggling in contraband and then trying to escape. So when the birds friend arrived for his stay they brought out the contraband bloke as an example, completely starkers and just threw him into the snow. She said that her friend said he died right there. I honestly don't know what to fucking believe. I mean, I have pretty exceptional clearance, right, and I had no idea a place like this existed. Who knows, crazier things have happened."
He'd spoken to doctors and psychiatrists and had test upon test both psychological and physical. Eventually, the straps had come off and again he'd presented himself as a normal, semi-functioning man. Or at least he'd tried. He admitted to severe depression. He admitted that he was passively suicidal but that it wasn't serious stressing he hadn't actually taken the pills. Though, that argument was lessened by the note he'd left on the door. He claimed this was a wake-up call and he intended to seek out treatment and he was grateful to still be here. Of course it was a lie but in the end, they couldn't keep him. He was no longer a danger to himself. He was sober-ish. He was free to go. He was alive.
Of course, Mycroft knew. John was aware he'd been tailing him this whole time, he remembered the fight he'd overheard between the brothers. He had been expecting, waiting for this moment. Witing for John's inevitable collapse because that was what people did. They folded like a house of cards and no one knew that better than Mycroft.
Maybe it was the fact that rehab wasn't the sexiest of places. Maybe it was the fact that he had lost weight and had been eating and sleeping like shit. Maybe it was the fact that psychologically and emotionally he'd been hit with bombshell after bombshell both externally and from within over the past three months. Maybe his brain figured getting a hard-on wasn't the most important thing to tend to at the moment.
"John we're two grown men in our 40's and-" Sherlock stopped short as he appeared to be thinking. "Ok, well, actually they might. But we'll just strongly insist on a single one."
"I want to try medication."
"Don't turn paternalistic on me, Sherlock, that's all I fucking ask."
"Yeah?" John asked before tilting his head to kiss him. He concluded the action by sucking on his bottom lip.
Wordlessly John raised the covers in welcome.
"Now, what we're going to do is change positions, ok? This was a bit ambitious on our parts anyway. We're going to go a bit more traditional. So, off you pop." He said giving his arse a light smack. "On your back for me."
"No?" He asked hopefully.
"Mmm, no, not really. Just content. Relaxed and content and absolutely madly in love with you." He replied.
"Initially, I didn't want to run the risk of you hearing me."
"That's why you feel guilty?"
“Absolutely.”
Some privileges he still had to earn but everyone got phone time from day one.
"That's it, come, darling." he whispered in his ear. "Come for me."
Too many dreams, Sherlock. Too many fantasies. Too many times I almost told you. Almost kissed you. Almost...almost...
"John, you are an absolute menace and you have put me through the ringer. And there have been times where I have wanted to throttle you. But I'm going to tell you something I don't know if you've ever heard."
"Yeah, yeah it does," John said idyll stirring his soup. "When I'm not feeling terribly guilty, I feel the same way."
He didn't want to move and Sherlock seemed in no hurry to separate, so they didn't. They just stared at one another, dreamy smiles and afterglow and soft, sweet kisses.
The funny thing is, she shot you and you don't even seem half as furious as I am.
He'd been putting it off as long as possible but he worried his fear had let the situation already edge into rudeness. That wasn't even counting how rude he had been before sending that last email.
"Fuck yes, it is."
"Tell me what you're thinking." He said, his voice excited and commanding.
And if that was Sherlock's reasoning it didn't explain why he'd said it when they were both sober and John told him goodbye at Baker Street.
Parts.
"I've a bit more time." Sherlock said to him and after setting the alarm on his phone, they collapsed into bed and slept in each other's arms for the next 2 hours.
"I strip you out of that scarf and that coat and I feel your hands all over me." I stopped and opened my eyes. "Sherlock, I'm a shit spontaneous storyteller."
"But you don't know for sure. It's my understanding that it was his persuasion of Mycroft that got you in here."
"Let's see if you'll be this grateful in a month's time. You're asking to keep it going with one of the few people you can't bullshit."
"Yeah..." He said having no idea what she meant.
It also helped that they'd been drinking a bit.
Sherlock cleared his throat once and then again.
"Yes. But not unpleasantly so."
"I'll help you make adjustments, John." he said and I felt his fingers brush against my cock through my pants.
"What? How am I killing you?" It hurt to even get the words out.
"And how was your meeting?" He asked.
Sherlock was rifling through his bag looking for something John would have bet didn't exist. But it kept him from having to make eye contact which he really seemed against at the moment.
John looked at Sherlock and they wordlessly agreed to leave their new closeness as something between them.
Shovel in hand, heart pounding he started to head inside.
John almost...
That was, of course, easy to say as memories of opening his eyes and seeing Sherlock's staring back at him faded a little. His lids heavy with sleep, his hair a delightful curly mess, his lips soft, eager, drawing closer. Wanting, needing a kiss even before a good morning.
"Yes."
No one seemed eager to volunteer so John decided to go out on a limb and raise his hand.
After a while John began to feel either he was growing accustomed to the pain or it was lessening. The area, the ever expanding area Sherlock was covering had grown warm and not unpleasantly so.
"Well, it's not as if I'm kissing myself. He's reciprocating."
"Yes, I suppose I did. John, if there's something you'd like to discuss is it possible that it could wait until tomorrow?"
"Yes, Sherlock?"
So, they left him alone, like a humiliated child at a school meeting where the teachers urgently need to speak to the dad about his troubled kid.
"Yeah, I can't exactly afford The Location on my own, can I? And I think the Mycroft Scholarship fund has dried up."
This was met with a chorus of shocked gasps and even a few playful boos.
"He's a recovering alcoholic who hopes to stay that way, you know, the recovering bit. He's tentatively happy. He's scared. He's in love. And he wants to be a good man, a good dad, a good boyfriend, a good doctor and he wants to do it all without ever touching alcohol again. That's who John Watson is."
A pause.
Since The Location was a mystery he wasn't sure how they'd arrived. He hadn't been too surprised when the limo had arrived at an airport. He slept on the plane ride, exhaustion hitting him like a hammer. A respectful tap on his shoulder what felt like five minutes after he closed his eyes let him know they'd arrived.
John and Sherlock shared a surprised look but didn't say anything. Mike Stamford was the last person they expected to be running a long game like some sort of romantic genius.
"I'm not a homophobe." He insisted and it sounded knee-jerk and defensive even to him. He closed his eyes and rubbed at his temples.
"I..guess I've learned that things I thought were dead and buried with my father, especially my feelings about him aren't. I learned that I'm predictable. Maybe not just in my patterns but in the people I choose as well. Huh..." He paused. "That one is just occurring to me now. Um...what else, I suppose I'd say my ideas of depression missed the mark. I think I've been trying to deal with it or not dealing with it since I was a teenager. Maybe it's colored a lot of my life."
"I'll help you as best I can."
"About the sex?"
Once done they both excused themselves, first one then the other to brush, floss and gargle.
A pause.
He grumbled his agreement because of course, she was right.
St. Bridget was no different and as it turned out he
"I'm in love with you." John said in a rush.
that maybe it is sticking and maybe I can do it this time.
"Oh...well, you need help? I can make myself available, take her a bit here and there. You should have said something sooner, John."
"Why don't you just mind your own FUCKING BUSINESS!" He spat as he wheeled around suddenly to confront the fucking do-gooder. Instead of a stranger, he came face to face with not only Greg but Molly as well.
"What happened to you after Duck left?"
"No, I mean what I said. You're still grieving, you're still a recovering alcoholic in the infancy of sobriety, you need to take it slowly."
"Then why do you do it!"
John had been sitting there frozen. He hadn't know Sherlock would choose this moment. He hadn't known he had believed this was the last time he'd been forthcoming. He also didn't know what was worse, the fact that Sherlock was going to reveal what happened after that or he fact that he was going to tell it wrong.
"John..." Sherlock said in reply but it wasn't a question or a statement, rather a dreamy murmur. Pulling back from kissing his lovers flesh John noticed the slight movement of his thighs and hips. Sherlock was rocking back ever so slowly, tentatively asking for more.
He wished some days and especially some nights, that Sherlock had shot him stone dead when Eurus had given him the chance.
Mycroft observed him briefly then clearly feeling he'd been far too candid he quickly rose from his seated position and handed John a card with a number on it. No name, no other information. Just a number. "Soldiers today." He concluded and with that, the elder Holmes swiftly left the hospital room.
"As you wish."
"Yeah, I do. I want that. I want that very badly, Sherlock."
"No."
He asked me how I was doing and I was able to truly report that I felt well. A little run down, a little sad and scared. But clean and honestly feeling the better for it.
By now Sherlock was just shouting after him as John beat a fast exit out of their bedroom. He made a beeline for the sofa and settled himself in for the night.
“Alright, John...I stand corrected. That was, in fact, a lot of fun.”
As the Family weekend drew near the mood of the entire places changed. Everyone seemed more antsy, more upset, touchier, nervous.
"Yeah, yeah, I understand." He nodded. He was bent forward now, one hand on his forehead shielding his eyes while his elbow rested on his knee.
Damn Hanah for being right. For always being right.
"Now you have had me running all over this city while you indulge yourself. Hmm? That ends now. You will get in this car or I swear to God above I will thrash you within an inch of your life."
"That is more zeroes than I thought you'd have."
"Mmmm." John said in reply. "Want to know what we talked about? My therapist and me?"
“You what?” Sherlock asked turning his head as he watched John exit the shower.
The morning of their ceremony he'd glimpsed Sherlock before Sherlock had seen him. His friend had been rather smartly dressed. Far smarter than John in a t-shirt, jeans and trainers. He'd dashed back into his room unseen and changed quickly. He hadn't imagined Sherlock would take it so seriously and he chastised himself that he'd been so thick.
"They say that you know?" James nodded. "Rehab can be this great storm that sweeps everything away."
The three of them.
"You cleaned," John said smiling at him as he leaned against the doorframe.
"What you're taking, ends now. You're going to get some help."
"You lied to Janine about where I was and why. You lied to Lestrade...you know you did."
"That's the thing, on one hand, it was people talking around me, and on the other it was the silence when I'm trying to sleep."
"Too easy.
"Very sweet." He said putting the car in gear. "The cakes not bad either."
He should tell him. He should say; "Christ, Sherlock, that scared the hell out of me...and not long ago I'd run straight for a drink to stop my hand from shaking instead of shoving them in my pockets."
It was strange hearing a retelling of a story he only barely knew, especially when he suddenly and unexpectedly appeared as a character, even if only as a briefly mentioned cameo.
So they sat down and they talked and except for the alcohol and the location of the elephant in the room that was John's wreck of a life, it was normal.
Finally, they managed to tear themselves away from the bedroom and not long after they started their morning kitchen routine, Mrs. Hudson arrived.
"Easy, my love." Clara said. "I'll put you down. One second."
His friend took exactly one step closer.
The package was for him though he didn't recognize it at first. Mostly because he didn't remember placing the order. A gentle shake revealed the relaxing sound of pills rattling in a bottle and he released a soft chuckle.
"Sherlock, I've been shot before."
flat drinking alone."
And like that John Watson was gone.
"No."
"Anyway, I was going through some of his stuff and found out that he'd written a few things for me in case this happened. He wrote something for you but he didn't finish it. I'm going to send it along to you if you'll give me your address. It's not much but I know it was important. Would you like to hear a bit now?"
"Who are you, anyway?"
Sherlock had someone air out the house and stock the refrigerator and the larder prior to their arrival and John offered to make dinner while his partner showered. Once he was done, they traded places and when they were both scrubbed and dry they ate a light dinner outside enjoying the starlight.
He'd gone to the loo to clean up and when he came back out Sherlock was standing in his room looking...sheepish?
John gave a relieved sigh.
"Thank you, love." He said quietly.
The driver protested but I quieted them both.
"What?" He said before rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
He was avoiding actually doing it which was stupid considering the state he'd been in last night.
"No, of course, you hadn't. John, I was playing at being the lower class petty criminal. The life suited me but it wasn't real. My home, my birthright, as my father called it was something that I ran far and wide from."
"You have...wrecked me, John. For years Mycroft told me that caring was not an advantage and I believed him. I believed him because I was frightened. Because I had seen people torn apart. Broken to pieces because of this. Because they open their hearts and their souls and their minds. Love is just...opening up everything, exposing your body like some dumb, domesticated animal. And you don't know if it will be a caress or a stab. You just have to wait. I just have to wait. And I don't..."
"You saw me at my lowest and my worst, my most arsehole and my absolute best self-destructive. And no matter what image of me I put before you, you always remembered the John Watson that I was, that I used to be, that I
"No, there was already a rift by then. She did a 180 with regard to our father...so um...we mutually decided it was best to maintain distance."
"You mentioned that she and Harry were patching things up."
"Because?"
"Ok, enjoy. I'll be in and out and if we don't meet sooner, see you at Hanah's." He whispered close to his ear.
"Oh God, yes, like that." Sherlock replied.
"Seems like you're about to follow me now." She muttered.
Amy offered the group a tired, grateful and shy smile as she accepted the coin. She was about to return to her seat when Reggie stopped her.
"If you like."
"You're right. You're even right about the scripted shit, I did have something sort of prepared."
"You look at me. I look at you and I reach for the zipper on your trousers. I slip my hand inside your trousers, then your pants and I pull out your cock, stroking it like I'm doing now. You sort of let your head drop back against the back of the seat."
"Well, you have it anyway. So, you're going to meetings?"
If he closed his eyes he was back in the church at Mary's funeral. The same church they were married in. He was sat alone in the widower's row, Rosie on his lap, screaming to high heavens. The previous days had been a blur of people gently hugging him, gently touching his arm, his elbow, his shoulder. He had feared the entire process might have been drawn out for days, perhaps even a month given the circumstances of Mary's death but someone, who he suspected to be Mycroft had expedited the process. Her death was registered, after what was likely the hastiest coroner's report on record. It was likely just to save the government from any possible embarrassment and not out of good will, but John was grateful whatever the reason.
"He died."
"No, John. She said not to police your recovery which at this point is non-existent."
"It would be easier if you straddled me." Sherlock said quickly and John felt him tense under his fingertips.
"So, when I asked you what you wanted, how you saw your life I can assume that Rosie is now a part of that in an as yet to be determined way."
"Honey Bee, it's night time. Lie down, my love." Sherlock said softly but all he received in reply was a "Dada. Dada up."
." Was all he could manage charitably. "I'm glad you like it."
"No, no I'm just not ever going to be comfortable talking about copping off with my boyfriend."
"You're feeling attacked? As though this is an assault on your person? Your choices? Maybe you even feel it walks the line of moralizing. And I would agree with you on all points if you hadn't so clearly telegraphed that you feel guilty. Addiction is a hydra, John. It has many heads which can be discouraging. But it only has one body. Forget about the heads, we're going for the body. You have set yourself up again and again and again to be in a position where you could keep at a distance. You said that Mary and Sherlock told you, you made a choice in terms of who you picked, a sociopath and an assassin. And that's true. You picked two people you liked and loved very, very much who you always knew would in some way be partially unavailable to you. They would keep you at a distance and you could do the same. You gambled, you played the odds because deep down you knew these people were hiding behind a mask. And they were, you just picked the wrong masks as the fake ones. And then you found yourself in so, so deep. So deep with people who despite their lies and their subterfuge and even the image they held of themselves, were painfully, wholly honest and open. And it scared the shit out of you. You thought you had an accord with them, an agreement, marry me a little, love me just enough, as the song goes. But they unintentionally tricked you and you were trapped. That's why you sense danger, John. That's why the Red Forest flames. Because your entire life has steered you away from truth and contact and touch and intimacy. You have been running since you were a child. That has to stop."
Sherlock grinned. “Crime scene,” he said.
Slowly, the city began to rebuild.
“I don’t know ballet.”
“Why all this fuss about something as mundane as baking anyway?”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open, and John was standing on the other side of the table.
“I’m glad too. But Sherlock,” John’s voice hitched with a laughing gasp, “I’m still a married man.”
"She's better behaved than you are."
John’s back really quickly and I look up smiling, but it’s not John that’s sat across from me, it’s some posh looking git with hair to die for and a long coat.
“It’s-”
, John. Their brains are just –
Then Sherlock remembered the crates they had passed, full of equipment John had not yet unpacked. He wrenched himself from the bed and ran to them, running his hands through them until he found what he wanted.
Sherlock stopped in the middle of the floor, feeling the dance and the music settle into his bones, and extended his hand. John, still against the wall, hesitated, then politely pushed his way through the assembly towards Sherlock.
“John – I-”
Sherlock wanted to take John’s hand, wanted to hold him, but was unsure of his welcome at this moment. “You asked her at the gate, didn’t you? I couldn’t hear.”
“Yeah. Of course there are guards below the window. I watched the shifts last night. There are a couple of guards that play chess between two and three in the morning. They really get into it, so if we’re quiet we should be all right.”
“Not Westminster, that’s for bloody sure.”
John was lying on the bed, still unconscious, an IV drip in his arm. “He was badly dehydrated,” said the doctor, “and a bit malnourished, and there’s some nasty bruising. Perhaps a cracked rib, but there’s nothing I can do for that. He just needs rest now.”
Jim opened the door to reveal a large room, white and clean. Sherlock could see glass tubing, microscopes, and large scientific equipment, some with the plastic covering still on. He felt his eyes widen despite his efforts to remain blasé.
“It’s beautiful,” Sherlock said, and meant it.
But John’s leg was there, at the correct angle, their calves touching briefly, without hesitation or error.
“This brings us to the showstopper challenge. As you’ve already been notified, this week we would like each of you to create a croquembouche. A croquembouche is a tower of cream filled – stop rolling your eyes, Sherlock, I know you know what it is, this is for the benefit of everyone else – cream filled profiteroles, held together by caramel. You will be judged on taste and creativity in presentation. You have four and a half hours. Any questions?”
In reply, Sherlock moved to the side of the window, the right this time. He began to walk ‘downstairs’, marching down an invisible set of stairs. When he was half way across the window, his face broke with a look of panic and surprise, and he collapsed out of view
“I was-” John said. He paused, and clenched his fist, and smiled in a way that Sherlock knew was not happiness. “I was checking for cameras.”
,” John said. “Once you’ve seen it, you can’t believe you lived proper without it.”
Sherlock inhaled, almost dizzy with his confession, and nearly immediately began to backtrack. “Apologies, John, I spoke out of turn. Overtired, I suppose, coming down from the case. Excuse me, I’ll just-”
“Yes, yes, it’s only transport and you don’t eat on a case, I get that. But this is now day four, genius. In fact it’s been fifty two hours since Lestrade called, yes, I do keep track of such things, and you are dangerously close to hypoglycemia and passing out as a result, which will not help you or the rest of us find this killer. So for two minutes out of the last four days you will eat something.”
At the same time, I don’t want to go back to that time when I was crazy over Mum’s death, over Boo’s death, fucking anything that stopped long enough to say yes. Hell, even Joe from the café was starting to look appealing, and he’s like eighty.
It all hit him at once. John was here, in his bed. After years of pining, which he now knew was mutual, John Watson was the lover of Sherlock Holmes. Surely this was the most momentous thing to have happened in history since the birth they would celebrate tomorrow.
“Lord, where didn’t we go,” John said. The volume of his voice changed, and Sherlock could tell he was wandering around the sitting room. “Kalidasa, Huang Long, Zhu Que… We’d hear about a job, we’d go. Shipping, security, sometimes – well. All sorts of jobs. You play chess?”
“Aren’t you as well?” he says pointedly.
“I wanted to, even if I couldn’t see him. Just to be here.”
“One more test?” Sherlock said.
He resolved to return in the morning, when the light was at its best. He hadn’t really seen the sun since this began, the sky only becoming a lighter gray rather than murky black.
COME TO ME ELSIE
I just shake my head.
Light glints off the gun in John’s hand, off the ring he still wears.
“I can’t – Rosie,” John whispered. “Go. I’ll be here.”
“Oh, I ain’t responding to Mr. Watson. Drawing a gun on someone’s behalf means first names. I’m John to you.”
Sherlock stepped quickly into Jim’s personal space, his lips a breath away from Jim’s. He heard Jim inhale sharply, saw a flush spread across his cheeks.
Greg smiled at the window. He found himself reminiscing about the early days of his relationship with his ex-wife, of laughing themselves sick together. He didn’t miss her, not any more, that was done and dusted, but the laughter – he missed that.
When he finished the song, Sherlock took his hands from his ears, slowly, carefully, cautiously. He looked like he was performing the mental equivalent of building a house of playing cards. Then he made his quick gesture with a sense of finality.
“Nope,” John said, realizing that he sounded more confident than he really ought to. Sherlock elbowed him in the side.
“A grant.” John stared. “A grant to study morgue practices in Victorian England.”
JOHN: [rueful eye roll] Yeah, so to spend the time and to keep him from going around the bend, I challenged him to learn how to tap dance.
SHERLOCK:  I suppose.
John looked at Holmes’ face, and saw bravado, a bit of mischief, and a thin layer of vulnerability underneath it all. “Yes,” he said. He was suddenly calm, and his voice was steady. “Yes, you may kiss me.”
John cracked his eyes open to see Bahdri peering at him. “What is it?” he mumbled.
“With me,” he said.
“Let me summarize,” Ella said, her voice as calm and neutral as ever. “You’re living with Sherlock again, and working with him, on cases.”
“I hope you’ll be happy here,” he said.
Sherlock gesticulated - twice. “I had to file both versions, the German and the English,” he explained.
“All right, John?” Sherlock called.
“What?” Mrs. Hudson sounded positively scandalized.
“Leave immediately after the performance; do not stay for a single glass of champagne. The curtain should fall at approximately 10:32 pm local time. There will be a car just across the road from the stage door at 10:35. Use the usual code phrase. The driver will take you to the airport, to a private jet. Take nothing but your passport; arouse no suspicion.”
The doors at the entrance of the studio opened, and both he and John turned to see. Sherlock thought for one moment that it was their driver come to take them back to the hotel, and wondered where the time had gone.
“Eighty-seven.”
Sherlock was standing just outside the rope, looking over the scene with the calculating, deductive gaze John knew so well. He pushed back the arousal he always felt whenever Sherlock went into deductive mode, and turned his attention to the case instead. He could see the hooks in the bottom of the case, clearly showing where the coin had been sat. He blinked – something wasn’t right.
It was midnight, and for the first time in his life, Sherlock didn’t want to be on a case.
“The park is huge,” Jerome said. “Where should we focus our search?”
I’ve never heard of a flatmate who interrupts dates, or answers texts for someone. You’re not big on boundaries, are you?
“No, John, don’t!”
“He is,” Holmes said.
, he thought. He supposed that by Victorian standards, he would be excellent husband material – single, a doctor. Had he responded inappropriately? Should he have flirted back, or thwarted Brigit more clearly? This was something his etiquette training had not covered.
He leant up and kissed Sherlock gently on the forehead. “Go,” he said softly. “Go, and think about me, Sherlock Holmes.”
“You like chemistry that much?” Sherlock asked. His bishop crossed the board. “Enough to set up a state of the art laboratory in your home?”
“What?”  Sherlock jumped to his feet, a look of deep concern on his face. “John? Are you unwell?”
He swallowed and deliberately put the thought away for later. “I love mince pies, Mrs. Hudson; I cannot wait to try yours.”
“No, I’m fine, John,” Sherlock said. He looked perturbed, but not in pain. “I’ll take care of it when we get home.”
“Popcorn husk,” Jerome said decisively.
“I’m sorry for your troubles,” John said helplessly. There were some times, he thought, when etiquette really was a useful thing in uncomfortable situations.
Sherlock had walked away from the Commissioner and crossed the room without realizing he had stopped mid-sentence. The crowd was focused on the band leader, and no one noticed him pushing through the throng until he reached John.
Sherlock wondered momentarily why he was on the sofa, and then the whole evening came back to him: holding John’s hand, John’s eyelashes in the glitter of fairy lights in the sitting room, the case, John asleep on the sofa. Just as the last image returned, John came and sat on the sofa, his hip pressing against Sherlock’s legs, still tangled under the blanket.
I know that voice. Haven’t heard it in months but I’d know it anywhere.
John is silent, and Sherlock cannot tell at all what he is thinking.
“Of course he fired at you,” John snapped, peeved at the man’s blasé attitude toward killing an innocent man. “You were standing at his window in the middle of the night.”
“Never said you didn’t,” Sherlock said, and was surprised at how quietly it came out.
“She married Mr. Cubitt, not you,” John snapped. The man’s entitlement was deeply nauseating to John; it might have been appropriate for this era, but John’s modern sensibilities balked at it.
He turned back to the bath, pulling off his bathrobe. And froze.
“After James was shot, after I got winged, I told you I had to go to ground for a while. For about six months I didn’t speak to anyone. Not one person. That does strange things to your head, after a while. And I was cut off from all my contacts, they all thought I was dead. I was too deep undercover to wave my hand and say, ‘Hey everyone, I’m here, I’m alive.’ If I tried to leave, there would be at least three countries that would be more than happy to arrest me. I was completely, totally alone.
“Well, that’s great. Now we’re both up here. Did your grand plan include an idea of how to get us both down?”
“Investigatin’? You a copper, or New Alliance?”
In a flash, he remembered standing in the ancient Egyptian gallery at the museum, looking down at the decorated mummy’s coffin, and the haunted look in Sherlock’s eyes as he remembered the beds that the actives slept in, back at the House.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, then grabbed his coat. Before he left, he looked at John, and John stopped breathing with the intensity of it.
“Ah, shut it.” John pulled at the collar of the ill-fitting jacket. “It itches, but I gotta wear it.”
,” John says again. “That was fun for us, but not for you, I think,” he says, looking a little worried.
“Only two. You were third on the list. The theft?”
“Was he a math riddle?”
“It’s all connected,” Sherlock breathed.
“To me, the logic was simple: if you loved someone, and your family were of the same status, you married. Victor’s house was as grand as ours, and I loved him.
“Duh. Now come on, it will be dawn soon. Who’s your contact?”
Mycroft took a breath. “Listen to me very carefully, Sherlock. You need to take this quite seriously.”
he thought
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t think I need the Serbian secret service to kill me,” John panted. “Think you’re going to manage it just fine on your own.”
John looked at Sherlock, saw his sadness and his regret. They had both made an error in judgement, and if they wanted to solve this case, recompense must be made.
The guard turned to Sherlock. “Gospođa Janina Nikolić, Director of the National Theatre.”
,” and he pushed John slightly. “They don’t want me to have allies, so they drive something between us. Make us enemies. They want me to have nowhere to turn.”
“Mycroft.”
Sherlock swallowed, his hands helplessly fluttering, and said, “Yes, John.”
Sherlock said nothing. It was suddenly hard to breathe.
No matter what, Sherlock was already dead. He had been dead for two hundred years.
“Shut up,” John snapped, then he began to laugh. “You don’t understand, do you? You think you failed Rosie, that you failed me? I asked you to babysit her, and you kept her alive during a fucking nuclear bomb. Eileen told me what happens in the part of London you were in. You know why there’s so few children here? I know. I know that kids that lived through the bomb don’t live long after that because…” John swallowed, “I don’t even want to think about what could have happened. But you saved her, and you
“Of course. You know most of my work is.”
“Mmmm. And I would be willing to demonstrate them all to you.”
Sherlock kept walking, resisting Maja’s pull on his shoulders. He fixed his eyes on the Union Jack, at the gates between him and it.
Sherlock held John close, and felt John’s arms tighten around him in answer. He realized that this was the safest he had felt since he had boarded the plane, so long ago.
“- And then my plane crashed, which wasn’t fun either, I’d like to remind you. It was terrifying. Now I’m trapped in a city that I really don’t want to be in. I have no money, no passport, no way to contact my manager, who must be worried sick. She may even have been told I’m dead, for all I know. I have to give a performance I did not agree to, that I wasn’t given much of a choice about. But if that’s what it takes to get me out of here, I will. But you’ll understand if I don’t feel like dancing at the moment.”
Sherlock turns a colour red that I didn’t think was possible with his skin tone. “Yes, thank you John.” He’s clearly trying to ignore the fact that if his face was on top of an ambulance it could stop traffic, and he turns to John, eyebrows raised, expectantly.
There was a long moment of John staring at Sherlock, and Sherlock looking down at the floor. Then Sherlock’s hands went to the buttons on his cuffs. Once started, Sherlock’s hands were steady and certain and unhesitating, stripping away his shirt and draping it over his jacket. John’s eyes were drawn, as they always were, to the small, neat bullet hole scar on his chest.
“John, it took me years to – oh
Huge thanks to my betas, besina and shamelessmash, who helped immensely, emotionally and practically, by alternately challenging me and squeeing at me. Thank you as well to @weneedtotalkaboutsherlock, who did a beautiful cover art for this fic, but I haven't figured out how to attach it yet!
“An extraordinary story indeed,” Holmes said. “Extraordinary… and a falsehood from beginning to end. I have never seen such a collection of lies told in my presence.”
Jim went ghastly pale. “Sherlock-”
“But how could I
He carefully stepped over the mounds of stone, twisted rebar, and rubble and walked around the grounds of England’s centre of political power, looking for any signs of life. All he found was a CCTV camera, misshapen and scratched, its lens shattered.
She came to the door quickly – she had clearly been waiting. “Oh, Sherlock dear, you’re back! He’s all right then?”
“What?! Why didn’t you come get me right away?”
“Someone tried to take her,” he found himself saying. “I got her back.”
“I know,” he said. “You’re right, I’m sorry.”
“So.” Mrs. Hudson turned to him. “You know what you have to do, don’t you?”

for the tea.”
“How is the rope coming along?”
John found it privately amusing that this Garrideb, who was now paying particular attention to the engraving on the coin, had probably not noticed that his American namefellow had probably been apoplectic with rage at the time, given how angry he was when he had arrived at Baker Street. He was glad that he and Holmes were representing Nathan and not John Garrideb; he was finding that he liked the present one more and more.
“Unfortunately, we can’t prove it - yet,” said Dunworthy. “And it will take some serious evidence for Lassiter to believe me over his own tech. And…” Dunworthy’s eyes went a bit soft as he looked at John. “Bahdri told me about you, and we - we decided that you couldn’t wait.”
“Show me.”
Carrying Rosie slowed him down as well, walking even slower to avoid stumbling and dropping her, or worse, falling and taking her down with him. Sometimes he wondered if he should let her down to walk on her own, but walking was still relatively new to her and the chances of her falling were far greater. She showed no inclination to get down anyway, looking around with wide eyes, pointing and saying, “What that?” at every unfamiliar sight – so nearly constantly.
“Human error,” Dunworthy said.
“I understand why you did,” John said at last.
Today's prompt is 'wish'.
“Sherlock Holmes, and John Watson,” Lestrade said. “They’re consultants, we bring them in for special cases such as this.”
On the bright side, Sherlock was correct about the location of the hideout. On the not-so-bright side, the gang was in it when John and Sherlock arrived, and the Yarders were not as close behind as they had thought they would be.
“Impossible,” Sherlock said. “Who would be so stupid to not get away quickly?”
Stamford entered the room, and John felt himself instinctively move into a defensive position, ready to defend Stamford from this bizarre man should the occasion arise.
John startled. “Right. Sorry. I’ll just – I’ll be out here, I suppose,” he said.
“Have you figured out the murderer, then, Holmes?” he said.
“I did. Found I liked it. Liked the runnin’ around, the excitement… living on risk, you know? And savin’ people… nothing like the rush of seein’ someone you thought was gonna die, stand up and walk out of the hospital.”
“We’re ready, John, Mr. Dunworthy,” Bahdri called.
Sherlock opened the door to his flat and ushered John into the sitting room, lighting a lamp before ducking through the curtain that led to the kitchen. He rustled around in the cupboards until he found the medi-kit. He always kept it on hand ever since a client broke a cup and promptly stepped on it barefoot.  He’d had to replace the rug.
“No more Peppa today,” he said to Rosie. He could hear traffic crashes outside, horns honking, people screaming. He forced his voice to stay low and calm. “We’re going downstairs for a bit now.”
“He says it’s fine.” Dunworthy glared at John. “All right, he says it’s at 85%, but another month of physio and muscle enhancers should get it up to capacity.”
“We’ll have to be discreet,” John said, and Sherlock nodded.
“Sort of.”
Sherlock smiled as he ripped up the note into tiny pieces and flushed them down the toilet.
"To a successful party," Sherlock said, raising his glass.
“Please, John,” Sherlock said, quietly. “Please. Just – draw.” He turned his back to John, and held his arms out to his sides.
“Yes, I am her godfather, you remember, I
Sherlock laid his hands over John’s, guiding them down to his knees. “One of the benefits of fucking a ballet dancer, John,” he said, “is that we are very, very flexible.”
Ajde = Come on
Sherlock lay back, letting the branches of the hedge support him, and tried to catch his breath. He wondered how long she would search the south end of the park before retracing her steps. He needed to get moving, but surely he could rest for just a moment.
They fell to their knees and began to dig. It was only a matter of moments before John’s fingernails scratched against something solid and smooth and cool. A few minutes later they were wiping the dirt away from the gold surface of the enormous coin, the Queen’s profile marred with mud.
John’s mouth twisted, and he stepped even closer to Sherlock. “Listen to me,” he hissed. “I swear to God, Sherlock, I will get you out of here. All right? I won’t let it happen, let them keep you as their… pet, their wind-up toy.
Sherlock couldn’t tear his eyes from Rosie. He remembered her playing with the chemistry blocks he had bought her, watching Peppa Pig on telly, just before everything had gone wrong.
“God damn
“John, no-”
Warmth spread through John’s chest, warmth that he hadn’t felt since he’d returned. He cleared his throat, licked his lips, tried to let what they were saying sink in. “Human error?”
There were a couple of little picture books in Rosie’s bag, and he sometimes would read to her, thinking that the distraction would alleviate the boredom for both of them. But the books were frustratingly short, with very little text, and repetitive to the point of agony. Then she would ask him to read it again. When she slept, he found to his irritation that the words of ‘Goodnight Moon’ unwillingly floated through his mind.
“Oh my God,” John whispered.
John’s eyes were soft, and his lips formed a tight, thin line. He stared at the two of them as if drinking them in. Then he mouthed silently, “I love you,” and turned away. The curtains fell shut behind him.
Sherlock could feel his heart racing, but controlled his breathing. “I see. The bomb.”
“Really?”  Mrs. Roshni peered down at the picture again. “I thought, with his poise and those cheekbones that… you sure he’s never posed?”
“And you suggested he bring in Mr. Holmes?”
“No, I - no.”
“You tell Riggs we’re done with him,” John said, turning to Greg. “No more cases for him. We’ll work with you, and Gregson, and Ali, but not Riggs. Ever.”
Mrs. Hudson was squinting at the three of them, and the ambassador was whispering to her. They were still a good twenty feet away, and Sherlock knew they had to confirm his identity before they could open the gate. He had to get closer. Sherlock kept walking.
“I got the proposal,
“Okay,” Sherlock said, though he didn’t really understand what John meant.
The hovercar pulled up in front of the theatre and a footman opened the door. Sherlock stepped out, forcing himself not to blink at the barrage of light from the bank of newsvids, forcing a smile instead. He held out his hand and helped Professor Flynn out of the hovercar.
“Indeed I did, and welcome, Dr. Watson. Come in out of the cold, now, and I’ll show you the rooms.”
Now, Sherlock says, “Yes, yes,” waving us off. “This experiment is at a precarious moment; I’ll see you shortly.”
SHERLOCK: Thank you – five, six, seven, eight…
“Yes, Glasgow,” John said. This was the last hospital in London. One more morgue in London, then he’d plan the trip to Dublin. “It’s been truly-”
Sherlock came up from behind him, and put his arms around his waist. “You’ll be brilliant. I already know you are, I just want everyone else to see.”
job you were speaking of - private security.”
Mycroft pressed his lips together and tilted his head to one of the guards at his side. Two things happened at once: one guard began to open the gate, and a second guard went to the main door of the embassy. He returned, with another guard, with Maja between them. She was handcuffed, and the guards looped their hands through her elbows. She looked angry and sulky, but followed them quietly.
Lestrade sighed, his head falling to his chest. “And he wouldn’t say that… to protect you.”
“I’m sorry?”
“Extraordinary!” Holmes said. He put his palms together, fingertips at his lips, a posture that John knew meant he was thinking. “I would be pleased to be part of such a fascinating story. But, surely, Mr. Garrideb, you would have better luck by placing an advertisement in the papers?”
something, and I can’t-”
“Good God, are you mad? You’re just asking for a food poisoning suit. Listen: prime rib, fingerling roasted potatoes with rosemary, steamed veg, horseradish. Classic, sophisticated. Bring us a sampling, but also get the name and location of the farm where you source your beef.”
Sherlock indulges John in a Watson family tradition.
Then suddenly he was being pulled up again. Something had hold of his robe and was pulling him up.
cào = fuck
Sherlock makes a confession.
“Oh,” Sherlock breathed. “I see. So you cut off my clients, my cases; made it so I had nowhere else to turn.”
John was singing too fast, his pitch was all over the place, but he sang. Sherlock’s face was flushing pink and his breath was shallow as he made his gesture. John waited, waited, afraid he had pushed things too far, risked too much. Then Sherlock said, his voice rough and low, “Go on.”
Sherlock turned his head to look into John’s eyes. “I did. Of course I did.”
John kissed him, softly, almost chastely. “Sit down.”
– an arsehole – the day we met but you just keep proving it!” she shouted.
Finally, the group turned back to John and Sherlock, both trying to look nonchalant. Mrs Hudson had clearly been appointed – or had appointed herself – to be the spokesperson for the group, and cleared her throat.
She was half watching the children on stage, flubbing their lines and staring wide-eyed at the audience, and half watching Sherlock. His focus was clearly on Rosie, and Rosie alone.
“The Ar-tine - is that a local dance?” the Commissioner asked.
“No.”
“I did, sir, the wind was blowing hard into the room and I didn’t want the cold to get into her wound.”
He looked over at John, who appeared to be in a similar state. He was staring up at the ceiling, eyes unfocused, chest heaving.
“Just a mo’,” John muttered, as he tried to readjust himself.
John banged on the door for a useless moment, then rushed to the window.
John shook his head.
“Go slow now, if it’s been a while since you’ve eaten,” the cook said. Sherlock blinked again, and she was handing him a mug with something in it. “We don’t have a lot, but here’s a little tinned milk for Rosie. She needs it, I think.”
Gē ge = brother
SHERLOCK: This move is apparently called paradiddles, which amuses me greatly.
it, it’s just right
“- we thought that the design balanced it out. So the round loaf wins this round. Whose was it?”
Bantam groaned, long and with a slight hitch in his voice. “We needed the money,” he said. “I needed the money. We’re not making enough from ticket sales.”
Evans jerked, and there was a flash and a roar in the room. John smelt the sting of gunpowder, then pain like a sledgehammer slammed into his leg and he fell.
Second, Holmes could take matters into his own hands and beat the shit out of John.
“That one there, that now stands on the sideboard, where I left it.”
After far too long, the last nail clattered to the ground and John threw the lid aside. Sherlock rose up out of the coffin and straight into John’s arms; John held him tight, whispering “Jesus Christ – it’s all right now – holy fuck – you’re okay, you’re okay.”
Sherlock could hear the crowd murmuring, could sense their mixed reactions. On the one hand, they were witnessing a rarely-performed dance being executed with skill. On the other hand, a scandal was unravelling before them – the great Companion Sherlock Holmes, dancing with a hired man. Persephone was not without its class differences, and though most of the elite were too polite to comment upon it, the divide was there. Mycroft was right; there were no doubt whispers running around the room about the rumours regarding Sherlock ‘entertaining’ John, but at this particular moment, Sherlock couldn’t give a damn.
Sherlock slumped farther down in the chair, opening his legs wider. John watched as he loosened his grip, clearly wanting to take his time. There were no more clandestine trip to the loo for sad wanks. When he masturbated he did it without apology and sometimes he requested John's voice in his ear as he did so. He had an equal affinity for both the naughty and the nice. He loved when John talked dirty to him, when he extolled the virtues of his hard cock, when he spoke blatantly about how he wanted to fuck him and be fucked by him. But he was just as excited when his boyfriend spoke tenderly, sweetly, gently about how beautiful he was, how beautiful they were together and how he'd always, always wanted this, even when he didn't know how to express it. He also enjoyed a combination of both, the commands, the demands but always concluded with the sweetest of 'Sweetheart's'.
"What was that?"
"When you died...when I
It's late and I can't sleep and I have to admit to you...that some part of me knew. And I don't mean I put it together because of the chair and the perfume or any other "clues". I mean earlier than that. Some part of me knew that the pieces of Mary Morstan didn't quite fit and I blundered ahead anyway. Does that mean I truly loved...love her...or that I just want to be hurt?
Should he say anything at all?
"No, I'm nearly done. You can unwrap some of the items in those bags."
There was something underneath Sherlock's emphatic sentences that John couldn't quite put his finger on. It bothered him, yes, but he chocked it up to the idea that his partner's nerves were rubbing off on him.
“I worry sometimes
"Since when do you care about money?"
After chores was social hour; everyone either huddling together in groups and disappearing into great clouds of smoke or lining up at the front office to retrieve their cell phones to call home.
"Kill yourself, how did you try to do it? If you don't mind my asking."
With each thrust of his finger, John made sure to continue applying gentle pressure to the tight ring, working to loosen and relax his lover back into enjoying himself. He added more lube, unbothered by the excess dripping down his hand and onto the bed before thrusting in a little further. Sherlock finally let out a breathy sigh that far more in the moment than anticipatory and John smiled.
"I know, I know, Don't stop."
So like everyone else he found himself turning to the internet
"Yes, yes, we'll make do. Please do that again." Sherlock replied almost frantically.
"Fingers." Came the silent reply.
The teenager scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Berk." He said as he entered the room and dropped his bag on the floor.
When John had first told him that Mrs. Hudson could hear them and hear them very well he'd blanched. It had taken quite a lot of coaxing and soothing, gentle teasing to get the normal colour to come back to his face.
"You must think you're dealing with someone else, mate. You know how this goes as well as I do." I said evenly.
Why not see where it leads?
"Oh, she made you this." Harry said handing Sherlock a piece of paper that was scrawled with crayon. "She says it's a mystery map, at least that's what I think she was trying to say. She drew it right after you read her that story."
"Do you think...think we should talk?"
"And you're willing to bet your life on that theory?"
"There's a lot of "if's" that have to be tackled before something like that."
He found himself consumed with "What if..." What if he tried his hand at something more? Something a little more ambitious, and grand? What if he tried expanding the blog? What if he started from the beginning and didn't skip anything this time around? What if he had an actual knack for this? What if he tried? What if?
you thinking then?" He asked testily.
"I just need to crawl in bed. With you, if you'll come." He asked hopefully.
"Not particularly."
"If I know anything about the cycles of the press and human nature, in general, it will. But it will take some time. John, if there's anything I can-"
It was a very pleasant way to be silenced and it did stop his train of thought for a moment.
"Shut up."
I adore it.
He'd started walking. Fast. "Mary" had joined at his side easily keeping pace. But then, she would, wouldn't she?
"Yes, well. These sorts of things happen. I can't say that I blame her. I mean, this and all." He said gesturing to his face.
"I was seeing a therapist and then I stopped because I didn't want to do the work anymore. But, for months and months, she had been recommending that I get on antidepressants as well as anti-anxiety meds. I'd like to try that now. I seem to be prone to panic attacks and I believe I have quantifiable unipolar depression. I believe I've been suffering from both of these for a long time. The anxiety since my late teen years, I suppose and the depression since childhood. I railed against being put on anything to combat it but..." He looked over at Sherlock who was observing him closely. "I think I need to acknowledge that my perceptions of the world,
"Have I given you the impression that I would blame you for your past?" Sherlock asked him.
"Here?" He asked with a touch of dismay that John found both endearing and highly erotic.
"Were you actively dating at the time?"
"I was telling her how I felt after you left. How it just spun me into this depression. How I felt like I was in a hole and I couldn't crawl out of it and barely wanted to. We talked about how you were the most important relationship in my life up to that point."
"What do you mean you're not following?"
"I made some tea." He said from the kitchen.
They ordered a light snack of cheese, crackers, bread and fizzy drinks and just talked, chatted, relaxed. John felt like a free man breathing free air on the verge of something new.
"I'm sorry?" Sherlock asked turning to him.
John glanced at Sherlock who having regained his composure was wearing a small smug smile.
John chuckled and yawned again.
"I wasn't performing," John said a little surprised at Sherlock's response. Then again, he did have a habit of being glib, he supposed. Hanah had said it was both self-protective and performative. But of course, he already knew all of that.
"Oh yes." John said before propping up and reclaiming the jar of honey. He unscrewed the top and dipped a finger inside.
I believed that I had chosen for myself and created the perfect life. One of solitude, reflection, contemplation, dark stimulation via crime solving, intellectual pursuits, serenity, and adventure.
"When...when did you start on heroin?"
"Tell me about what you wrote and what, if anything, you learned."
"And I was wondering if you might like to try prostate massage?"
"What's going on, John?"
"People will, of course, talk." Sherlock said with a knowing smile.
"You already apologized for that, John. I already forgave you, long ago."
"Him." He said hooking a thumb in his friend's direction. "Always there, always adding in his two cents whether I wanted to or not. I thought I had let him go but he was still there. I mean, I know it wasn't him..."
I don't deserve some sort of medal for this, I don't deserve...I don't...she's my daughter. You don't get some sort of prize for loving your daughter. I know...I know I don't..."
"No...I didn't know...I mean I assumed they were all the same."
"Do you hide things from Sherlock?"
"John...did I wake you?" He whispered.
John slipped his tongue into his mouth as they kissed, the action biting off some of Sherlock's little whimpers of pleasure which were becoming all the more frequent. Everything was blissfully warm; their bodies under the blanket, Sherlock's delicious thighs, his tight, tight arse, his lips, his neck, every inch of skin that John touched or kissed. It was all warmth and beauty and bliss and love and perfection and at one point he had to pull his mouth away from his partners as he clenched around him. A shudder and moan tumbled from John's lips as he was thrown off what he figured had been metronome-perfect lovemaking.
Suddenly he felt the weariness, that exhaustion dragging him down towards sleep but as it did, it weakened his defenses.
Love,
Sherlock uncrossed his long legs and stood to his feet.
"John, you are a medical professional. I think you know precisely what I mean. Hallucinations?"
And through it all Sherlock didn't so much as make a sound.
"Hey, I'm fine." He said reaching out and briefly resting his hand on Sherlock's cheek. "But we need to talk."
thing keeping him up.
Rooms. Plural. Well, the moment had come a little sooner than he'd planned. But here they were. And he was excited. He'd only done it once before, sure, but, he liked this part. The part where they reaffirmed what they meant to one another. The part where they claimed each other.
"Is it?" Sherlock asked innocently. "Did you happen to bring the newspaper up with you."
"I thought you wanted him like that. Hard. A Shell. Past caring." John pressed.
His phone buzzed in rapid succession from where he'd left it on the sofa cushion. Walking over he picked it up and saw there were two missed messages.
"I...I can't deal with Harry right now and I don't want Rosie to see me. I mean certainly not like this. I might just lie low that weekend. Keep to myself."
"Umm, yeah, I know where it is. Hang on." He replied and after a few minutes returned with the notebook in hand.
"Well, how will you know I even did it?" He asked with confusion.
"How did that make you feel?"
We started snogging again in bed. The idea of touching him in this fashion which an hour ago would have seemed so impossible to me felt nothing but natural.
"I-" John felt himself flush but before he could speak Sherlock continued.
John was sure he'd heard him wrong.
"No, I didn't mean that. I mean I can smell the sick sweat on you, so yes I'm concerned about that as well. But I meant is your tooth still bothering you?"
“He didn’t react well?”
“I didn’t have many friends, as you can imagine. We lived on a large estate in Sussex, a good distance from the village. I had a nanny but she preferred to avoid work in general and me in particular, so I spent a good amount of my time alone. But there was another family that lived two fields over, and they had a boy about my age.
“Maja,” John said softly. A smile that contained more embarrassment than anything else flicked across his face.
Twenty years slippage. Twenty
Gradually his heart rate returned to normal, and John was calming in his arms as well, with each of them twitching as their orgasms reverberated through their muscles. Hands which so recently scrabbled over skin now stroked gently, feather-light, over sensitized skin. Sherlock leaned down and found John’s lips with his own.
John’s head was practically out of the cab window the whole way home from Heathrow airport.
“Quite right. Which answers our second question of why he wanted Mr. Garrideb out of the house.”
“Well, Doctor, whatever you think is best.”
He should have known it couldn’t be that easy.
They walked in silence up Baker Street through Clarence Gate into the park. John realized that he was still angry. The incandescent fury had dissipated somewhat, but the ghosts of adrenaline were still coursing through his blood. He could feel Holmes observing him, and tried to calm his breathing, but Holmes said nothing until they passed through the gates to the Park and were on the circle.
“Big studio,” Sherlock replied. “Room enough for two dancers.”
“Yeah. Maybe.”
“Nothing definite. But it would be good to see her.”
Sherlock put his phone in his jacket pocket and glanced over at Rosie, still happily watching telly. He glanced at his watch – ten minutes now.
One more chapter after this... a bit of an epilogue.
, thought John,
Still. The kissing and touching and smiles were marvelous. They were enough to keep him from leaving, from going back into the wastelands that he still thought he deserved, but it was not enough to make him feel useful.
“But she sent for me,” Slade said, his voice rising. “I got a note from her, just now, telling me to come.”
“Go brush your teeth, Rosie Posie,” John said from the kitchen.
Sherlock Holmes, self-proclaimed sociopath, watched her cry for thirty seconds before a wide wave of his own grief and guilt welled up.
,’ but knew it was useless.
“Zài-”
“It stands for ‘How the hell did you know Da was a miner’?”
He was only a step away from the open gate now, and Mrs. Hudson’s arms were reaching out to him. He looked back briefly, and saw Pavlović with his fake smile, and Maja with a stony expression. Sherlock paused for a split second, knew instantly what he had to do.
Sherlock’s fingers were already folding the paper back into its original shape of the tiny elephant. His hands were shaking. “So you came and – thank you.”
“He’s having an affair with one of the producers.”
“Can you not keep it down for just a few hours?” John said, stabbing a finger at the stereo. “She’s asleep.”
“And you can lose yourself in a forest,” he answered automatically. “You,” he breathed.
“He got into Rosie’s Christmas candy – overindulged. But I expect the sugar drop will hit him any-”
They reached the top, and John let out a sharp edged sigh. “I’m going to have a shower,” he said, not looking at Sherlock. “Get the smell of the hospital off me.”
He realized that he had been standing in the doorway, staring at the terrible and horrific change that his world had undergone. He looked over at Rosie; her eyes were wide, and there was a tiny wrinkle between her brows, a miniature version of her father’s expressive face.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the voice as he recognized it. He growled to John, “Don’t answer.”
“Are you all right, Watson? Please tell me you’re all right.”
“We should have stopped to ask Mrs. Hudson for some stale bread for the ducks,” John said.
My hand was halfway to his flies but I stop, something’s deeply wrong. He’s pale and just on the verge of shaking, and I have a funny feeling that if I touch his belt buckle things will go very badly.
“Hello John,” Sherlock said softly.
“The fuck?”
After a time, the tumult eased, and Rosie was reduced to hiccupping deep breaths. Her voice quivered as she said quietly, “Just wanna see Daddy.”
The light from the fire flickered against Sherlock’s skin, highlighting the scars that crisscrossed his back. John sucked in a breath. He had had a glimpse of them before, back when he was caring for Sherlock after he was shot. Before he could say anything then, Sherlock had turned away as quickly as he was able and pulled a dressing gown over himself. John’s mind had been too full of grief and anger over Mary to press further.
Sherlock’s mouth was suddenly full of fluid, and he stumbled.  John steadied him but Sherlock altered their course, aiming for another side alley.
John nodded his thanks, then pressed his lips together. “I don’t get much opportunity to dance, at home.”
“The museum’s a few kilometres north of that tower,” Sherlock said. “Right in the heart of the city.”
It was the work of a moment. When the recording was done, Sherlock slumped and turned his attention back to the fire. He heard Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson whispering again by the door.
We get around to introducing ourselves eventually. His name’s John. He’s a doctor, and when I find that out I can hear Claire’s ears pricking up all the way from Finland. I’m chatting while trying to calculate the time difference to Finland, because Claire made me promise to call her before I went on dates. She’s trying to take care of me, still, from afar. I realize with a start that I haven’t called her in a while. Oh well, neither has she called me, so it’s all right.
“Can we – can we-” he gasped.
Sherlock rose out of the water, still laughing. They tripped their way back into the bedroom and collapsed, dripping, onto the fantastically tacky bed with the mirror overhead.
“Have I mentioned that displacement is also referred to as Euclidean motion?”
. We chose that, he and I. But he’s gone now, so...” Her sight turned inwards again, and Sherlock knew she was lost in her memories of this man. “He said to me once that we all die alone. Goodness knows he kept trying to do so! But in the end, he died an old man, in his bed, and I made damn sure he didn’t die alone.”
The moment she saw the playground, however, she ripped her hands from their grasp and ran, the sight of her usual swings and slides covered in thick snow giving them fresh life in her eyes. Soon she was so absorbed in her play with her friends that she paid no more attention to the two men who lingered at the edge of the yard.
Fucking boundaries, Sherlock. Not your business.
“Is Dr. Watson with you? Mrs. Hudson?”
“And for dessert, profiteroles-”
“No…”
They held onto each other, wordless, until the aftershocks released them. Then John held onto Sherlock until his arms went loose and lax, and John knew he was asleep. Even in sleep, Sherlock was smiling faintly, and John knew he was whole.
Sherlock swallowed and swallowed, gentling his mouth around John as he came down. He gave John’s softening cock one final teasing lick, then slid back up John’s body, still smirking.
Sherlock squinted down the little road, and saw the glow of Vlajkovićeva street to their right, saw the National Museum. “There, that way. Don’t worry, I trust them.”
He would take a long bath back at the flat, soak the inevitable soreness out of his muscles, but for now the shower would do. He closed his eyes and tilted his head back, letting the water sluice down his body and wash away his sweat.
Sherlock pressed his palms into the ground, trying to push himself upright, but then decided it would be better to simply to wait for John to return. He was just starting to shiver when John reappeared a moment later, hopping slightly as he jammed his boots on. “Thank God they were still there,” he said. “Sorry I haven’t shoes for you - again, didn’t know you were swimmin’.” Quickly he pulled Sherlock to his feet, unfolded a rough wool blanket and threw it around Sherlock’s shoulders, drawing it up to cover his wet head. “That should keep you a bit warmer, and maybe you won’t stand out quite so much. Now come on.”
One minute.
Rosie was waking.
John sighed. Gambling – the age old problem, the age old motivator. “Better call the police now, Jerome.”
“About time, you lazy arse,” he said.
“No I’m not.” John looked at himself in the mirror, and shook his head again. “I can’t believe I’m about to dance at the Royal. They’re going to laugh me off the stage. They came to see a ballet, and Sherlock bloody Holmes talked me into tap dancing in the middle of it.”
The door to the flat opened at 9:00am sharp, and a different large man stepped in. “Your car is here,” he said.
“No,” John said, the word nearly silent, without breath, at first. He licked his lips and tried again. “No, thank you, Inspector Lestrade. I’m fine.”
“No, sir,” the driver said. “Just Mr. Holmes this morning.”
I lay the guinea pig in his arms, and he freezes for a moment, as if he’s not quite sure whether she’s going to blow up. Then he lifts one hand and starts patting her. God, his hands are enormous, his whole hand is as long as the poor pig. He pats her for a long time, and then he smiles down at her.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock smiled at the door, then picked up his wrap and pulled it on again. Walking as quickly and quietly as he could in his ballet slippers, he made his way to the backstage. He took up a position next to Stephanie, her headset already on. She nodded briefly at him, then returned her attention to the prompt book.
“At home, of course,” Sherlock said absently, turning some of his attention back to the microscope. “Did your minions somehow lose track of me when I haven’t moved at all?”
“You’re more relaxed and happy since they moved back in, you know, dear.”
“What do you mean?”
John forced his attention back to the paper he still held in his hand. “I know nothing of printing presses,” he said. “Nor ink, nor-”
“Case solved?” John said softly.
C meant that the meeting was closed which was basically a necessity for him at this point. Open meetings might be fine in a pinch but the fact that
"Hi, John, it's very good to see you."
He inhaled, exhaled and looked around. God, but he'd missed this place. He'd missed who he was when he was here.
So, that whole back-to-work thing was a bit short lived. I had a row with a patient. They recognized me and they remembered you and they just kept going on and on and on. The next thing I knew I shouting. It's like I can't bear to hear people talk about you. Even though I want to talk about you all the time.
But he didn't finish his sentence because at that moment Sherlock pressed his arse firmly back against him and John was pretty sure he lost the power of both speech and coherent thought.
Relieved at having left "Mary" behind in the park he entered the store and walked right up to the queue for the pharmacist with confidence.
I believe you'd wish me well.
"You're a decorated soldier who saved lives, a successful doctor despite the fact that you don't really enjoy practicing medicine in a controlled setting, I cannot do my work without you and I take it that letter I saw was a rejection reply from one publisher. One. So, you'll send off more then. As for getting sacked, you'll get clean and get a new job, if you want one. Next."
