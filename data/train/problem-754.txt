Sherlock sighed and pushed a few things from his desk. He tugged at his hair and groaned. What was wrong with him? Why did he seem to hate the fact that John had a date? He dropped his head on the desk and rubbed his eyes.
The older man laughed quietly and nodded. “Yeah, I think I can do that for you,” he said. “Meet me here after classes end and we can go together.”
Mr. Jamison sighed, running his fingers through his graying hair. “Sherlock, there’s nothing I can do now,” he said. “I’ll have the police come in for this matter, have them talk with both of the boys and I can possibly kick the other boy out of school. Right now though I can’t do anything about the system. I will bring it up in my next meeting.”
John shook the thoughts from his head as he found himself in front of Sherlock’s door at the end of the day. He took in a deep breath and knocked on the door. He heard the come in and pushed open the door. “Hello Mr. Holmes,” he said.
John smiled and looked up at him. “Thank you for making it so happy,” he murmured, placing a hand over his. He linked their fingers and looked back to the television.
John laughed and nodded. “Sounds like a great plan Mr. Holmes,” he said, buckling back up. “Let’s go where the wind takes us.”
John opened his mouth to say something but Sherlock stood up. “Class is dismissed early,” the teacher said.
A smile spread across Sherlock’s face, a warm feeling filling his chest. He knew that John would be alright.
“He seems to have hit his head too hard,” one of the EMT’s said. “He should be fine, he just needs to rest and he’ll wake up.”
Sherlock watched him for a moment. The teen may have been shivering but he had a huge grin on his face. “Oh fine,” he muttered and started to undress. He folded his clothes neatly and set them next to John’s before running into the water.
He made his way to the stands and found a seat towards the end. There was no need to sit right in the center of everything. He checked the time, happy that the match was almost ready to start. The players were soon out on the field and Sherlock grinned when he saw John.
"Of course," John said sharply. He didn't like his father. He had used him to keep the house running for years and was never there for him when he needed help. So now he was just going to leave him behind.
Sherlock nodded as he rolled up his sleeves. “Follow me,” he said leading him to the auditorium. He pushed open the doors to the back and showed him the set pieces they had to put together. “It should take the rest of the week.”
“It will be freezing,” Sherlock said, watching the boy shiver slightly already. “I can guess you already know this already though.”
John went to the car and sat against the edge of the car. “Right here,” he told him, patting the spot next to him.
John didn’t know that all that was actually wrong with him. He hadn’t been able to take a proper look at himself.  He might as well tell. “I was mugged on the way to school,” he told him. “I think they were people from here too but I’m not too sure. They weren’t wearing a uniform or anything.” He rubbed his knuckles where they were bruised. “I got them back.”
Sherlock moved away from him and looked to the nurse. “He was beaten,” he told him. “He has three bruised ribs, something wrong with his leg, probably bruised as well maybe sprained, a black eye, and a cut lip.”
“What am I supposed to do with this? It’s soaked,” Sherlock said. He wiped down the best he could before getting dressed again. “Car?”
The class all shut their mouths and stared at Sherlock. He smiled and went back to working on getting his things in order. John watched him silently, trying to pinpoint his teacher’s problem. The teen gave up though after Sherlock started teaching the class.
When the final bell rung John made his way towards Sherlock’s room. He paused outside the door, hand going to the doorknob. He bit his lip and raised his hand to knock. There was a soft come in. John opened the door and gave Sherlock a small smile. “Afternoon sir,” he said.
“I can take you right now if you want,” Sherlock said. “I really don’t mind. Plus, if you walk home now you will get home at the same time as if I would drive you home at the normal time. It’s a long walk.”
“Do you need a ride home?” Sherlock asked. He bit his lip, wishing the words didn’t come out. He couldn’t drive students home. “I mean, it might get you home quicker.”
As he pushed open the door he looked around. His breath caught in his throat as he saw the place covered in dust and everything looked…old. Older than just a few months.
The night after graduation was thrilling in so many ways. John spent two hours out with his friends and came home to a romantic dinner and a graduation gift. No, it wasn’t their first time, but Sherlock made it as special as he could.
John could only smile more. “It wouldn’t be good to show a school that I want to get into that I was a bad kid,” he said, “getting into all these fights.”
“I’ll catch up with you,” John told him. He watched Mike leave before going to Sherlock’s desk. “Mr. Holmes, are you alright?”
As Sherlock spoke John tightened further into a ball, wanting to be as close to him as he could be. Everything he was saying was amazing. He wanted it all, but it felt like it would never come.
John smiled at the idea and nodded. "Sounds like a good plan to me," he agreed. He took his hand and pulled him to the door. "Come on then."
John opened his eyes as he hissed and looked over at Sherlock. “That hurt Mr. Holmes,” he whispered, smiling a bit.
John rolled his eyes. “We’ve been friends for a while. Shouldn’t we be on a first name basis by now?” he asked.
He pulled away and gave him a smile, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “Come on, we got breakfast to get to.”
Sherlock glanced around the room. It didn’t look much cleaner but he was sure John wanted to get out of there as much as he did. He let out a small laugh and nodded. “Okay, let’s get going. Surely your father would want you home.”
John sighed, looking down at his feet before he looked at Sherlock. "No, you don't need me. You just don't want to work. Come on Mr. Holmes, I don't want to stick around here anymore."
“Yours,” Sherlock said. He looked at him. “I might have something in my car to warm you up.” He went around and popped the trunk. He grinned and pulled out a blanket. “We can use this to dry off.” He handed it to John. “I don’t want you dying on me.”
“Not just that, taking them out to dinner,” John laughed. A light blush crossed over his cheeks and he was thankful for the food as it came.
"Me," Sherlock finished for him. He sighed, running his fingers through his hair. He needed to think about this rationally. John was an adult. He could do as he pleased. "I understand. I want to leave as well."
The bell rang and Sherlock watched his students leave, some of them wiping drool from their chins. He shook his head, knowing they were going to fail their next test.
Sherlock nodded and bit his lip. He glanced to the house then back to John. He was going to get himself fired. “Would you like to do something with me?”
John nodded slowly and stood up. “Thank you Mr. Holmes,” he said. He wasn’t ready to lose the one thing he was proud of in life. “See you at lunch.” He went off towards the gym.
The quiz went well; for John at least. He was one of three that didn’t fail it, got the second highest grade out of the class to be exact. He was rather proud of himself.
Sherlock nodded and resumed his post at John’s side. He kept his grip light as they walked out of the locker room. “I’ll drive you home,” he told him.
They rushed out to the parking lot to Sherlock’s car and Sherlock unlocked it just as they reached it He pulled open the door and slipped in. “Where do you live?” he asked.
Sherlock stood next to John as they stood at the airport. John’s recruiter was going to meet them in just a few minutes to send John off.
John’s lips were rough, just how they looked. His hair was soft at the back of his neck and Sherlock let his fingers push through them.
Sherlock glanced up at him. “Mr. Watson, when I told you to leave I meant it,” he said. “Go.” He didn’t know why he felt so weird but he didn’t want to hear about that date anymore.
Sherlock wiped at his face as he watched him walking away. “I’ll see you soon,” he called after him.
John smiled, cupping his cheek with a grin of his own. “I think I do,” he said with a grin. He kissed him again, just a quick one. “I’ve wanted it for a while. I’ve thought about it so much.”
John sighed in relief. “That’s good,” he said. “I would love for you to come. Have a fan in the crowd.”
John licked his lips and almost thanked him again but he stopped himself. “Cool,” he said. “I’ll take you up on that offer Mr. Holmes.”
John stopped and help back the soft groan as he turned. “Yes sir?” he asked, giving him a small smile.
“That’s understandable,” Sherlock said. “That happens a lot with people who get mugged, or assaulted in anyway.”
Sherlock smiled as he watched John smiling proudly. “So, Mr. Watson, what do you want for your reward?” he asked.
Sherlock smiled, kissing him again, pressing him back against the sofa. John grinned, running his hands under his shirt and feeling his warm soft skin.
Sherlock couldn’t help but to agree with that but he didn’t voice his thoughts. “Well, let’s get our food,” he said, motioning the waiter over and ordering the noodles and anything else that John wanted.
They made it to Sherlock’s in no time, Sherlock wouldn’t admit that he was speeding at all. Though John knew they were going faster than normal and he couldn’t blame the man. He was sure they were both waiting for a time like this.
He got a cup of coffee and waited for the halls to empty before trying to get back to his room. He didn’t want to end up wearing his drink. He started walking back to his classroom when a boy ran passed him.
Sherlock had their legs locked at the ankle under the table and he was holding his hand tightly. He was watching John as the young man looked over the menu. He could tell that the gears were turning in his head. Way more than they should be.
“It’s….” John trailed off when he saw house. The car came to a stop and he quickly stepped out. “I have to go. Thanks for the ride Mr. Holmes. I’ll see you Monday.”
Sherlock pulled on his jacket and started to head outside. He walked to the field and leaned against the fence. He watched them practice for the last half hour and then waited for John to show up.
Sherlock frowned a bit but didn’t want to show it. “Hey, I know how that is,” he said. He glanced out the window. “How far do you live?”
“Yes, sir,” the young man nodded. “Mrs. Jenkins says it’s been His Lordship’s room since he was boy, just as the room next door has always been Mr. Sherlock’s.”
“Don’t lie to me, Micky,” Dilly uttered with difficulty. “I’ll never feel the sun again. But don’t cry. I’m not unhappy. This world’s too good for the likes of Dilly.”
We continued crossing the fields. “What was I saying? Oh, yes, certain public houses. There is also the Salisbury. It’s quite prominent on St. Martin’s Lane. You know the spot, Watson. We have passed it many times on our way to and from the theatre. Like the Crown, it is a favorite with actors, poets, and artists who have a taste for boys.”
I told the Irishman I was not sorry for the choices I have made and I reiterate that statement. I would not trade these past eight years for any amount of money or any measure of fame or fortune.
James shook his head sadly. “Poor Mr. Charles will have his heart broke if anything happens to Dilly. She may be a Mary-Ann, but I think she’s a gentle soul underneath. I hope Mr. Holmes gets both her and Mick out of the clink soon.”
“Nothing much,” conceded Lestrade. “We have Fisher’ killers in custody and they have confessed and also given up their compatriots. But that doesn’t mean Wiggins doesn’t have his own enemies in the underworld. I have a guard here just to make certain of his safety.”
“No man can predict his future – or his fate,” I said quietly. “No man can ever understand the needs and agonies of another human heart – or its inner afflictions.”
And so we travelled. I revisited the great cities – Paris, Florence, Venice, Rome – but this time seeing them from grand carriages and opulent villas instead of the small pensiones and café s of only a few years before. In France and Italy a wealthy man with a kept boy was nothing unusual. Perhaps they gossiped about us behind our backs, but we were always welcomed, even fawned over. That is what money and power can do – even more so than extreme beauty, it will open any door.
There was a short note on top. “To Mr. Sherlock Holmes – For your enjoyment,” it read. And was signed, “Your very humble and excellent servant. M.” Enclosed were sketches, done on creamy paper of a kind common in Italy.
For years I thanked God that Holmes was an automaton. He seemed from the beginning to be one untouched by common emotion. On occasion I would witness a crack in his steely composure, but those cracks always mended quickly. Holmes was a man who did not need another human soul in order to be complete, but was entirely sovereign in body and mind. I admired such supreme control and strove to be like him.
“I can’t write,” said Dilly. “Can’t write and can’t read. I can’t do anything. I’m nothing, Charlie. Except when I was with you. That was the only time I was alive. But that’ll be over soon.”
“I think you’ll survive,” I replied. “Now we must get the cat into the box. Perhaps if we wrap her up first? Otherwise she’ll claw the deuce out of the both of us.”
“Yes,” she said. “The young man who answers your door in Baker Street. I left my card a number of times in the past week, ever since Dr. Stamford said you were back in London. But then when you did not answer my notes...”
Having listened to Holmes’ playing for many years, that did not surprise me. He could coax the sweetest sounds from a violin that I have ever heard – as well as the most dissonant, when the mood struck him. “What did your grandfather say to that?”
“Yes,” I said. “You rather did.” The mystery of Holmes’ money was now solved. The Earl of Sherringford owned half of London, or so it seemed. He was also a major power in Her Majesty’s government. That’s how he’d gotten his brother into rehab instead of gaol. Another mystery solved.
“Well, it hasn’t,” I said, holding my head at an arrogant angle as the other patrons stared and whispered. Let them look! Let them stare! I no longer gave a damn!
“Yes,” he answered. “Last night’s attack at Baker Street was deadly serious, but this seems more an attempt of chance. The Professor must have put a bounty on my head and Redmond spied me and thought he’s make a try. I was coming out of St. James’ Park – he must have followed me from Whitehall. I was on my way to see Mycroft anyway, so I continued onward.”
“See? It’s working already.” Holmes proceeded up to the first floor and into our chamber, slamming the door behind him.
The Irishman squirmed on the hard seat of the carriage. His back was obviously plaguing him in the damp weather. I knew it was so, for my own leg and shoulder were aching as well.
“Yes,” Holmes agreed. “A minder. That would be intolerable. I didn’t spend the past few months since you left rehab being a good boy and working their blasted program only to be placed in another pseudo-prison once I was officially released.”
We began tentatively, exploring each other’s bodies. We already knew each other as intimately as two friends, two who were as near as brothers, may comprehend one another, but this was a new territory to discover, to explore, to conquer.
I opened my bag and retrieved a small bottle of laudanum and a spoon. “This will allow you to sleep, Charles,” I said, giving him a minor dose. “Let yourself rest for now. Things will look brighter when you awaken.”
May in Sussex burst into glorious bloom and the lovely weather and even lovelier verdant countryside mirrored my blissful mood.
When I awoke it was past noon. Holmes was dressed and sitting in the corner of my tiny room, drinking coffee, smoking his pipe, and reading ‘The Times.’
Holmes and I went behind the curtain and sat by Dilly’s bedside, listening to his labored breathing.
I turned to see Wilde’s friend, Mr. Robbie Ross, at my side. He was a small, neatly-made young gentleman, boyish and bright-eyed.
“It was elementary detection,” he said. “When the murder of William Fisher led us to Soho and Mick Wiggins and Dilly, I knew that Moriarty was connected to it all. I was aware that Mick had been working as a renter for some time. I tried to dissuade him, but he liked the flash life, as he called it. He liked the money and he liked the sex. And he was working on and off at the assignation house in Cleveland Street, which I knew to be connected with Moriarty’s empire. Through Mick and a few of the other boys, including Dilly Mitchell and Thommie McBride, I obtained much intelligence about the Professor’s operations, which I turned over to Lestrade.”
At first I was incredulous. Holmes had never shown a romantic interest in any living creature, let alone such a blatantly manipulative female as Irene Adler. But he was like a stupefied boy, unable to understand the meaning of his burgeoning puberty. In a word, she led Holmes around by his cock and he followed willingly.
I brought it to him. I’d seen Holmes smoke many a pipe in my time with him, but never the like of this contraption. I watched him pour out a measure of strongly sweet-smelling tobacco. He lit it and took a hard pull, sending the sickly-sweet smoke swirling in the air around his head.
He was quite young. He stared at me almost fearfully. Sherringford Hall obviously did not attract many strangers.
“Me?” That was a surprise. “Thinking that you should call me to bind up your wound? Then why didn’t you summon me earlier?”
I felt breathless with anxiety. “Are you suggesting that people believe Holmes and I are... are in some kind of beastly ménage?”
My mind cast back to Mick Wiggins’ words in his prison cell and I felt ice solidify around my heart. “And are you afraid to speak his name, Holmes?”
“What was that all about, James?” I inquired. “Why did you or Holmes not tell me the lady had come to see me?”
“No,” I whispered. For it was true. My brother only seemed to notice me when I was in trouble, and then he simply wished I would go away and leave him in peace. And now I had truly gone away, but how far I could not then imagine.
“I trust you with my life, Watson, and have for as long as I’ve known you. And that trust has never been misplaced.” Holmes tightened his arm around me, as if he feared I would somehow slip away. “But I have already reminded you that your honest face displays every emotion, every fact of your existence. You cannot keep a single thought from your expression. Even Mrs. Hudson and James can read you like a child’s primer, so how would you have been able to deceive Moriarty, who is almost as discerning as I am? Therefore, I could not tell you anything at all for fear the strategy would be revealed to our enemy. Then you went and made that blasted bargain with the deuced man! Was that necessary, my dear boy?”
“And so it is!” she snorted. “They are competing to see which of them can be the first to get his prick into your bumhole, you foolish boy!”
“I doubt she would come out and greet two total strangers. Mick said she was shy. Here, Moggy!” I called. “Here, puss!”
“I swear, John,” said Wilde – Oscar – as we sipped the sherry. “I have the strange sensation that I know you from somewhere, but I cannot recall where we might have met.”
I petted Gladstone, knowing James would see to him. Then I went into my bedroom and set about packing the few possessions I wished to take with me. The rest I would leave here. Holmes could do whatever he wished with them. Perhaps he would seek out a new man to share lodgings, but I doubted it. There were few who would put up with his myriad eccentricities, and he was so much the misanthrope that there were few he could stand in close quarters for very long. He once told me that even at university, where most men make their dearest and longest-lasting friends, he had only one close companion, and even that fellow drifted away after Holmes left his college, typically without feeling the need to take his degree.
“They were,” Holmes replied. “They met in Boston. My father gave a lecture at Harvard and my mother attended.”
Holmes was lying on the bed, on top of the blanket, in his shorts and a plain dark tee shirt. His silk dressing gown was crumpled on the floor. He often lay like that, gazing up at the cracked plaster ceiling, sometimes all night, as if in a daze. I wondered if he somehow slept with his eyes open.
“Yes,” said Holmes. “He will always return – as long as I am alive. And as long as he still wants you.”
The Irishman smiled, pleased with his plan. “I have business in America, in New York and Chicago. New opportunities to seek and new connections to make. I also have my estate in Virginia. It is secluded, but quite beautiful there. The mountains are as blue as your eyes. It will be like a honeymoon.” And then he laughed. “A second honeymoon!”
“You’ll be able to meet the others, John. I know they’ll make you feel welcome,” Fred said to me. But his gimlet eyes were fixed  on Holmes. “Ta for now.”
Holmes paid the driver while I stood on the pavement, regarding the building that had been my home for eight happy and exciting years. Then he came and stood beside me.
“Oh, no!” James exclaimed. “I’d never do that! I was only wondering. Mick says Dilly’s not feeling so well. I brought them both some of Mrs. Hudson’s food early this morning, but they wouldn’t let me see Dilly. They took the basket, though.”
“He will understand why I wish to leave Baker Street,” I said, thinking of Holmes watching me with Thommie in that room in Cleveland Street. The look on his face. “This has been coming for some time. He will not be surprised by my decision. I will tell him that... that... I am going on a long trip. Perhaps to the Continent. To sort things through. He will not endeavour to stop me. And he will not seek me out, as he would if I were simply to vanish. Because if I did that he would never rest until he found me. You know that a mystery is the very air that he breathes.”
I confess that the entire household pampered me to a fare-thee-well, and, although outwardly embarrassed by the fuss, secretly I relished it. Holmes hovered over me like a mother hen, reversing our usual roles, bringing me honey from his hives and treats from his forays to the village and to Chichester. A few times he travelled to London to confer with Lestrade on Scotland Yard’s progress in tracking down Professor Moriarty and the handful of lackeys who had thus far escaped, but he always returned the next day.
I presented myself as the perfect chaperon for the attaché’s wife and daughter on their journey and was happily accepted. The truth is that I fancied myself in love with the daughter. And with his wife. That was the trouble. I found myself courting the girl, while having an affair with the woman. It was most confusing, but also most delightful. The daughter was petite and blonde with a laugh like a babbling brook, while the mother was redhaired and buxom, a lusty female who made me forget my close calls with the gentlemen in Italy, and especially the Irishman.
“Lord, my boy!” she said. “Don’t take on so! I know you receive the attentions of women as your due, so you should expect that men with a taste for boys will also pursue you, but don’t act like a prudish schoolgirl when it happens. It is the way of the world, John. I merely warn you against being preyed upon by scoundrels such as Brigham and Spencer. If you wish to take a male lover, find one worthy of you. With your beauty you could easily catch a prince or, if you wish to remain here in Rome, a Cardinal. But I would suggest you stick to married women. They are less trouble in the long run, although they won’t give you such expensive presents. And their husbands might take a shot at you now and again, but that is the chance you must take for love.”
I was uneasy about such intimacy with a man I had only just met, but I had heard that Wilde had a number of queer ideas. I must also admit that I was not surprised to see him at the Salisbury, for I had heard many rumors about him and his circle of male friends. But I was surprised at how open he was about being at a public house so well-known as a meeting place for gentlemen of a certain proclivity. But I imagine he felt safe because anyone seeing him here would also be a man of that same persuasion and unlikely to point him out.
“Do it quickly, if you must,” I said, gazing down at the muddy roadside where I would die. “Let this make an end to everything.”
“No!” I cried. “Such recourse is beneath you! The world is full of problems to be solved. I see them every day in my medical practice. There is so much we do not know, Holmes. You are a brilliant chemist and a practiced theorist. You turn your mind to the solving crimes, but there are so many other mysteries in this world, certainly enough to fascinate any man for as long as he may live.”
He turned away from me. “Your personal life is your own affair, my dear fellow. I make no judgments upon your actions.”
James sat down on Holmes’ sofa and leaned towards me. “I’ve been having... feelings for someone, Doctor. Someone I met here in London. I haven’t known this person long, but it’s different from anything I’ve ever felt before.”
“I would not know,” he returned. But his face said otherwise. “I am not privileged enough to be a guest of the earl and his mangy brother.”
“And now I’ll do well for you, Doctor,” he said. And with that he put his arms around my neck and, standing on tiptoe, kissed me directly upon the lips.
“But what boy – indeed, what grown man? – can acknowledge such a thing?” Holmes sighed. “My tutor came back for more every night... until my grandfather returned. It didn’t take much to convince the old man to send my tutor packing. I merely said I was tired of Mathematics and he was out the door, protesting loudly. But then he was gone. And no one was ever the wiser.”
“I say, Stanley!” called another voice from the far end of the room. There was the hint of an accent – an Irish accent. But the voice was not the same. It was not low and menacing, but booming and good-natured. “Come and sit with us!”
James put the bowl and glass back on the tray. “I’ll leave the tea in case you get thirsty in the night. Ring if you need anything and I’ll pop right up. Good-night, gentlemen. Pleasant dreams.”
“No,” he replied. “It is another man. You see, I wrote Dilly some letters. I begged her to run away with me. I had money, enough for passage to New York and for us to live comfortably there. I told her it would not matter that she wasn’t really a woman. No one in America would know us, so she could pass as my wife. We would be happy there!”
“Then let me in, for pity’s sake,” I interjected. “Perhaps I can alleviate the poor wretch’s suffering.”
“You have changed, John,” he whispered. “I hardly knew you. I might have passed you on the street, unnoticed.”
A waiter came by with a tray and I took a glass of champagne, downing it too quickly. I must be careful when I drink. I don’t have a good head for spirits, but the desire for them is strong in my blood. It must be the Irish strain in me. Alcohol killed my brother outright and I was told my maternal grandfather succumbed to the demon as well, even though the man was a respected physician who should have known better.
“Thank you for the referral,” I said in all sincerity. “It’s difficult to start up a practice after all these years, but I need to regain a measure of my independence... especially now.”
I went out of the library and started up the stairs, only to find young James dogging my steps. “Sir! I forgot to thank you.”
“That they were. But they were thugs for hire. Such fellows are clumsy and I detest clumsiness. Here. I give you back these.” He took a sheaf of papers from his coat. “It was beyond foolish to rack them up. Pray do not do it again.”
When Sherlock was done with his work he checked the time. It was earlier than usual, like he told John he would. He grabbed his jacket and pulled it on before grabbing his bag. Glancing out the window he saw the rain. He groaned and ran his fingers through his hair.
“Do you have it every day?” Sherlock asked. John shook his head. “Then you can serve a whole detention on the days you don’t have practice and serve half a detention on the days you do.”
John looked at him, his eyes full of sadness. It hurt to know what he was leaving behind but he had made the commitment. It wasn’t like he wasn’t going to come back. “I know you don’t,” he whispered quietly. He leaned towards him and kissed him again, holding it for a moment. It wasn’t going to be the last time but it almost felt like it was. Something in his chest tightened and he pressed harder into the kiss.
Sherlock smiled over at him, shaking his head. He caught the other staring but said nothing. He wasn’t going to make this night awkward.
"You weren't here for everything else," John spat, unable to help himself. He shook his head, trying to laugh it off but it sounded forced. He clenched his teeth together, trying to let out some kind of pent up anger. "You know what, it doesn't matter. You don't have to pretend like you want to be here. I'll have all my stuff out of your place by tomorrow and you'll never have to see me again."
“And when you’re done with your schooling, you’ll move in with me again and the only way I’ll let you leave again is if you have to,” Sherlock whispered, smoothing back his hair. “How does that sound?”
Sherlock stood up and gently rubbed his shoulder. “I’ll be back, John,” he said. “Go to your next class and I’ll talk with you at lunch.”
John chewed on his bottom lip, peeling off the skin with his teeth. “Actually, I should probably walk home,” he said. “It’s not that far.”
John shook his head. “I don’t really hang around them much with them outside of school,” he said with a shrug. “I have a lot of things to do.”
They drove to the restaurant and Sherlock helped John out. “I’m fine,” John assured him. “I can walk on my own now. I’m just a bit shaky.”
John looked to his feet as they walked. He really didn’t want to tell him. “Nothing too bad,” he mumbled, wiping at the blood again.
John looked at Sherlock as they drove off, taking his hand and squeezing it. "Home," he whispered, looking out the window.
Sherlock shrugged. “Don’t really understand the sport,” he said. “I was just waiting for you guys to finish.”
Sherlock wound his arm around his waist and helped him to his feet. “We should get going before everyone tries to leave,” he said. “You did great by the way, before you were tackled.”
John moved his hand a bit and linked their fingers together. “Imagine if anyone we knew showed up,” he murmured. “They would certainly talk.”
Sherlock shook his head. “Don’t worry about it, you’re finishing it now,” he said. “Just hurry up. The quiz is starting right when class starts.”
That's why John was laying on his couch, watching as Sherlock scribbled away at the papers before him. He looked at the time. He had been at it for three hours now. That should have been enough time. John smirked and looked towards the ceiling. He let out an audible sigh, his hand falling to the floor with a thud.
Sherlock let out a relieved sigh, rolling his eyes at the same side. “I don’t think anyone would like to be hit by a man two times their size,” he said. “Other than bad how are you feeling? Feel like you can walk?”
Sherlock kissed him back, humming softly. He pulled back when he saw the recruiter coming towards them. “I guess this is my goodbye,” he whispered.
They walked out of the school together, though they were careful not to be seen getting in the same care. John was just happy to have a place he actually wanted to go home to now.
Sherlock turned back to the office, his face set in a firm look. He marched back into the small room, the other two boys gone. “Sir, with all due respect you are an idiot,” he said.
“Tomorrow,” Sherlock repeated, watching him with a small smile. “Get some sleep. I know you probably have chores to do, but you need your sleep.”
Sherlock smiled and leaned back in his chair. Not all his students were bad. No, John Watson was better than the rest. He somehow raised the bar so high that no one could reach it.
John frowned and looked down at his feet. “It didn’t go so well,” he admitted. They went out and had a great time at dinner. John walked her home even. However when she went to kiss him he backed away from her.
“Hola? Oh, Hello! Yes, I would like to order the Rioja Red wine, please,” Sherlock says to the other end of the call.
"The students won't concentrate either way." Sherlock sass came out, with his I-know it-all-voice. What bothers me about it is how right he always is.
“Yes, everything is more than alright,” I respond, with a little less excitement, controlling myself more. I get down from Sherlock and look at his outfit. He looks brilliant.
Hey. So how was it?.... any fanfic ideas you would like to read? I really enjoyed writing this. My first fanfic, has ben AMAZING and thanks to all of you guys... it's been just perfect. Stay tune or more fanfic.
“Sherl...wait don’t fall,” I say parting apart and looking down the steps it takes to enter the jacuzzi. The first step was burning hot, but I kinda like it. Second step was focused on the bobbles popping up my leg. Sherlock made a loud gasp when the water was above his tight. Still glued together, holding each other’s hip close standing in the middle of the warming pool.
“Like it? I can do this and you would lose your mind without me touching it” Sherlock whisper in my ear, licking the right spots.
“John,” Sherlock has enough time to wispher before I brush my lips to his. Morning kisses are always the best, soft but hungry, desperate but sweet.
“I trust you, love. I’ll go anywhere with you.” Sherlock answers. I love the trust we share in general. I'm sure, well, I’ll go with Sherlock anywhere for better or worse. I realize I’m just smiling at Sherlock, in a creepy way. I come back to the world.
“Everything ok?” Sherlock asks me. My happiness is aching to shoot out my limps. So I grab Sherlock’s face, by cupping my hands to his jawline and press my lips on his really hard, enough to make his back arch back, almost falling back. After some long kissing, I need to breathe and I’m sure Sherlock does too. Not wanting to drop him, I hug him tightly and he hugs me back with the same pressure, I practically shout behind him, “I love you so bloody much!”
Sherlock, which has been trying to hide his jealousy for the past two minutes, couldn't control himself any longer and said, "John if you don’t stop being so bloody gorgeous, I'm going to eat you in this plane. And apparently, all the girls on this plane seem to share the same though.” He said, nodding to the girls two seats behind us.
After a couple of laughs, the guy pulled himself together and asked, “You guys are not from here, are you?”
“I was going to propose first,” Sherlock starts whispering, “I had a really anxious day because I wanted everything to be perfect. The simplest thing would trigger an attack that would lead to…” Sherlock stops to take a breath and to let everything sink in, “run away somewhere I could…” Sherlock finishes with a small hanging, in the end, leaving me intrigued to know where he would go if what. But I know this must be hard to explain, so I let him leave me hanging.
“Well, it was you who called him delicious in the first place.” The man, who was now standing up, exposed me. The adrenaline went down in a heartbeat. I have never been more embarrassed by saying what I like. Sherlock looked at me, with the most interesting eyes I have ever seen him put. Before I go into fists with the man on the floor, the two guards behind me grabbed my arms tightly and let to the door. I could use my military knowledge to get out, with the amount of alcohol I had on my bloodstream and the glass bits in my hand, there wasn’t really much I do. The guards took me to the door and threw me to the street like in the movies. For a second, I stayed there, in the ground processing everything I just saw. Sherlock being a stripper for a gay club, does that mean he was gay or bi? The fight with that man, just because he said he was going to have sex with him tonight, does that mean I am jealous?
“You know what, I’m just going to take a bath. But when I come back…we’ll talk.” My voice betrays me, making me sound shaky. I entered the bathroom in a heartbeat, I can hear Sherlock laugh outside. The bathroom is amazing, large, clean and fancy. ‘wow,’ I whisper, looking around to every detail. Closing the door behind me, leaving unlock. ‘just in case’ I think. Knowing Sherlock may be timing my shower, I take my clothes off and enter the bath under ten seconds. The warm water relaxes my muscles and lets my brain relax from the nervousness of proposing. I take no longer than seven minutes, getting a white towel from the hanging bar. I step out of the bathroom, wrapping the towel around my waist. Sherlock is in the balcony staring outside, with his hands in his mind palace position staring into the busy street. Walking towards him at a slow pace, wanting to know what is going on inside that brilliant mind of his. I open the glass doors of the balcony, without him noticing I direct my lips to his cheek, landing a soft, sweet kiss. Sherlock’s hand's brakes form his normal position, moving to wrap them around my face, holding my face in place. Small kisses everywhere along with uncontrollable smiles here and there.
“Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson,” I said. The leader told the man to take the weapon to inspection, then turn to us. “Yes. Thank you… umm, how long are you two staying here in Spain?” He asks. I had to answer, so I look to Sherlock for support, “Not long. We are leaving tomorrow.” Sherlock responds and quickly adds, “John shall we?” Pointing towards the cab we left in the middle of traffic. I nod, but before I leave, I stretch my arm to the leader and he shakes it, with the other he waves a small goodbye with his hand. Then moves it towards Sherlock, he reciprocates the action and quickly turns around walking to the road where our cab is still stuck in traffic. While we walk Sherlock comments, “Wow, Anderson must’ve been around here, for these guys not solving the case.” I laugh at his comment because I know how much he loves making fun of people, “Anywho… moving past this… we need to get to the hotel to get you clean up.” I say, pointing out the big mud stain on his left shoulder.
“Yes dear, they have to be from Spain, because well you see, my husband used to buy me muffins from there and they were delicious.” She exclaims, happily.
“Toplock” Sherlock smiles and pushes me down to the seat around the jacuzzi. His galaxy eyes looking at every inch of me up and down. Placing each leg to my side, locking me between him. Stretching my arms towards him, signaling for him to come closer to me. Sherlock finally sits on my lap and presses our lips together in one fast motion. Then pushes himself up, making both our erections touch and brush against each other. A moan escapes my lips without control and Sherlock does it again and again.
“Yes, yes,” I groans, “Like this.” I braces both hands again his back and begins to slam my hips up and down on my erection. Can’t help the moan and gasps escaping my lips, but Sherlock is making just as much noise. I can already feel my orgasm building when Sherlock starts to thrust up inside me, the sound of our bodies coming together echoing in the bathroom.
“Sherlock! Stop it we’re gonna be late, and I want this to be perfect.” I whine unable to look away from his lips. His eyes roaming all over my body.
Sherlock asks a couple seconds later, “What do you want to watch?” Stretching his arm to the control on his bedstead next to him.
“Did you get all correct?” I ask him when we are already sitting next to each to other, hands tangle together. Referring to the driver’s deduction he had scan compared to the information in front of him.
“Ahh... Sherlock..” I moaned. My view was getting close to perfect, with his messy curls on me. It was almost breathtaking.
“Are you still up for a lap dance?” Sherlock brought it back, I, indeed was, One hundred percent, but I would love it in the bed...while he is riding me.
“Sounds expensive John. How are we going to pay for it? Cause Mycroft is the queen of Britain, not Madrid.” Sherlock’s sarcasm and worry make me laugh and love him more.
"More John... Much more..." Sherlock moans softly, throwing his head back into the mattress; I work my way down and lower on his body. With every kiss, I drop Sherlock becomes hotter and more sensible. I reach his defined abs, I know this labyrinth by heart. The six packs of strong muscle, followed by the other, move up and down dramatically, as I kiss the lines of defiance. Sherlock's hands are another world as they roam around my back, and leaves his marks of conquering. The sweet pain encourages me to continue moving, never stopping. I promise Sherlock I was going to tease him out, but I am not satisfied with what I have done so far. So, as my final tease, I part from his skin and form a small hole with my lips, then I push cool air against his hot skin. I know he loves this, mostly when it's around his erection.
“You had me suicidal and dangerously mad,” I darkly say, looking down at him. Sherlock’s hold so many emotions at once, it makes me want to turn them into pleasure and ecstasy, “You are gonna have to face the consequences. Love.” My deep voiced makes Sherlock's head fall back into the bed with a little cry. I can’t hold myself back a minute longer; so I dive into his neck, locking him between my legs, and with small use of my hands and teeth, I leave a purple “John’s property” sign on his collar bone.
“I’m going to open you up John, for me.” Sherlock warns me while grabbing the bobble of lube he left next to him, “I’m going to drive you mad.” Pouring a good amount of lube on his palm and fingers.
“Yes, it will,” I respond, with the same answer he gave me before. “Go take a bath,” I say, pointing out the dirt on his curls and jacket. Sherlock gets up without a fuss and walks to the bathroom. The next and only sound bouncing off the walls of our room is the sound of the water dripping from inside the bathroom. I’m clean, so I don’t need to take a bath. I take this opportunity to decide what to wear tonight. Opening my wardrobe, I see a couple of shirts and jackets, then I see the one, and the only, suit I  brought with me. It’s the one I bought, the third year I lived with Sherlock, I was going to ask him out to a real dinner date, but due to the series of events that happened that year, the was no way I could go out with a ghost. I took the hanger out of the closet with the suit and laid it down on the bed. Looking down at it I notice how untouched it is; I made a vow to never put this suit on unless its for a date with Sherlock. This would be the second time I put on. The first time I asked Sherlock out was unforgettable, the courage and the nervousness I was experiencing was unbearable, I could’ve fainted, but the response from Sherlock brought me back to life. The “yes” and his smile and his eyes and his lips and his hands and his… everything. It was simply spectacular. Coming back to the present world, I remember that our reserved seats are currently waiting for us. I start to unbutton my shirt and pulling down my pants, placing them in the bed, next to the suit. I take out the hanger from the jacket and separate the shirt from inside it. It’s white, the original, but I don’t really care, as long as it’s Sherlock is the one seeing it. The pants go next, they still fit perfectly and it’s iron, which makes it look stunning. The shoes were the only thing I hadn’t brought with me. But I thank Sherlock for encouraging me to buy something new the first day we arrived. He got himself the expensive suit and I got some shoes that seemed classy but diligent. I seat on the bed, and the water inside the bathroom stops dripping, then the sound of the bathroom curtains sliding open. I continue to put on my shoes; they are the kind one had to slide their foot inside. Sherlock comes out of the bathroom, just as I finish putting on the last shoe. He walks towards the bed and frizzes the second he looks at me. I stare at his right back, wanting to see the expression he puts.
“Did you find your sock?” I ask him, sitting on the bed looking at his perfect arse through the towel.
“Right now, love I need you to relax and go back to sleep,” I answer, ashamed for braking Sherlock’s sleep pattern.
My thought is interrupted by the alarm on my phone that reads, “Commander Meeting.” I look down to it and my eyebrow automatically raises. My brain moves Sherlock's brilliant deductions to a side and focuses on the heating meeting I am going to have in an hour. I take a deep breath and start organizing my desk, picking up the books and papers I need to take home and work on, to put them in my bag. Last night, like Sherlock brilliantly deduced, was horrible. I got into a fight with my general in the army base. And now, I have been reported to my higher commander. As I walk out of my classroom, there are the usual kids playing and talking, I walk past them like a ghost. Outside of the school building, my car is parked in the best spot in the school, because it's safe from athletes students and its close to the main door. It's actually quite a pleasure to see my car. Its electric blue, BMW, the power of thirty horses, and automatic parking. I get on my car and turn it on. My brain is processing all the possible outcomes of this meeting. One: I get fired. Two: I get level down. Three: His sentiment would get the best of him and would let me go. I actually think the second and third option is more possible.
“Hm. Your eye bags are bigger than usual and that coffee is your third this morning.” Sherlock deduces in a heartbeat. ‘GOD does he even breathe?!!!?!?!?!’ I don’t know where to look. But I know what and how he knows. I give him a sharp nod and ask, “How did you reach that conclusion?” It's always enlightening to listen to his thought process.
“Alright, I'm going to continue setting our clothe up,” I respond with the same volume as him. Sherlock slowly disappears into the bathroom, mantling eye contact, inviting me with his eyes. But I decline the loving invitation with a sharp movement standing up and continuing unpacking our stuff. The shower doesn’t take long to start running. A couple of minutes later, our bags are unpacked except the clothes we are going to wear now. The shower keeps running, but I finish setting up. ‘Maybe I could join him,’ I think to myself. I walk towards the unlocked bathroom door; I’m about to open the door when I feel a variation on my pocket. My phone is ringing, I pick up.
“Murder,” Sherlock says behind me. ‘How could he possible know—‘ my thoughts come together, when I turn around to see Sherlock smiling and thinking. This bloody high functioning psychopath.  I roll my eyes.
“John…” Sherlock moans at the thought. He knows what is about to happen to him, which is why he doesn’t complain or continues to distract me from my amazing procedure. He lets out a small cry when I slowly move my hand all the way down to his thigh, ready to make him shiver. I want to make Sherlock cry out and beg and scream and worship my name for the pain he made me go through. Sliding my hand, touching his warm and sensible skin with my fingertips and tentantly move into his inter tight.
“Hey love,” I say softly pulling my face away from him, “Today is our last day here. What do you want to do?” I ask. Sherlock looks up at me, grateful I changed the topic. He thinks for a couple of minutes and responds, “It doesn’t matter love. As long as I am here with you, NOTHING matters.” A small laugh escapes my lips and makes my body shake. I stop slowly and answer paused, “Yes, love. Me too.” There is no more trace of tears or sadness or regret on his face; only love and secureness. Our lips meet one more time.
“What the fuck, John.” I cursed my self under my breath. A small laugh came out of me. This is actually what I needed, some adrenaline working through my veins and the view of someone I like. I slowly and painfully stood up, because my hand and my knees still hurt. As I made my way to the car, I started to wonder… HOW THE FUCK AM I GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS AT SCHOOL TOMORROW?!?!
“Trust me, love, if anyone is nervous, I am the most entitle to do so.” I casually say. Sherlock looks up to me and frowns his face just notch and goes back to that holding smile. The sangria is first to arrive, Dante comes and settles two wine glasses in front of us, he also serves it. He looks at me and gives me a hint of a smile, then leaves.
I open my eyes facing the water room, not the best first view if you ask me. But a soft hand movement takes me back home, for I know its Sherlock. I think a couple of seconds deciding whether I should wake him and enjoy the pool or let him sleep. In between my toughs, I see my jacket on the floor reminding me that today is the fucking day I’m proposing to Sherlock bloody Holmes and we will seal our future together. My hand reaches my phone on the nightstand next to me. 4:30 pm. Not late but really early to get dinner anyway. Reviewing what happened before we fell asleep, I remember that Sherlock wanted to enjoy the pool and the jacuzzi. Excited by the thought, I quickly turn around to face Sherlock. Cupping my hands around Sherlock’s define jawline and rubbing my thumbs on his cheekbones, I whisper, “Sherlock,” he shifts around with a extraordinary stretch that outlines his muscles and body; he swirl face the other way,  a delicious moan escapes his lips, making me fall a little more in love with him. I repeat myself again, “love, pool?” Sherlocks turns to me again and simply smiles, already excited to do so. I lean forward to give him an encouraging kiss like we always do first thing in the mornings. I sit up slowly to stretch my muscles, involuntarily, I make noise much close to a deep moan. After I finished stretching, my nerves send an electric shock to my brain, telling me that someone is hugging me from behind and leaving kisses on the border of the neck and shoulder.
“Open the door and enter the cold room without me.” I dare him. Sherlock looks at me with the why-would-you-do-that eyes. Then drags his whole body to bed next to me.
“Sit.” Sherlock completely pulled away from me and order me to sit in the chain. I followed his commands. I sat on the chair, facing a blank wall I've been wanting to fill in. Sherlock pulled out his phone and a loudspeaker. I let a small smile grow in my face.
“Alright, so first we have to get our boarding pass checked,” I said slowly, unable to hide a worrying voice as we walked to enter the airport’s entrance. “John, I know how to board a plane.” He assures me. “Of course you know, but I need your…. erm… well…” I stumble over my words, holding his hand a bit tighter, wanting  Sherlock to argue against it. He looked at me with a confused look foe half a second. It didn’t take Sherlock Holmes to deduce I was scare of flying, but I tried to keep it in, after all, I was a Captain in the army, I shouldn't be scare of this… anymore at least. After a minute of walking towards the boarding pass machine. Sherlock deduced out loud, “You are scared of flying, aren’t you?” and before I could answer, “Afghanistan or Iraq? Did you get hurt? Who else did? How did it happen? Who’s fault was it?” My mouth slightly open, to answer all his questions. In 30 seconds my mind played the multiple images I’ve been trying to erase for years. Which have actually began to ease out since I moved in with Sherlock. I gain composure and try to form an explication to his questions.
The man indicated that we follow him down a hall and up a back staircase. Above was another room, this one smaller than the theatre below. Chairs were grouped around a raised platform. On the platform was a divan covered with a velvet drapery. A few men were already sitting, most well-dressed older gentlemen. They glanced at us with curiosity, but then looked away. The man collected our money and then left.
“Yes!” said Holmes, leaning forward, his interest sparked once again. “There’s only one man in England who owns one, and only one man, his henchman, who can wield it. I fear I am coming too close to them for comfort and they have decided to eliminate me. But, alas, you were almost taken out instead.”
The Irishman caught me in his arms and held me. “Why did you come here? Did Holmes send you to taunt me? Because I will kill him. Perhaps not tomorrow or next week or even next year, but I will do it. His days are numbered.”
“Young Mr. Griffith is my patient, James. I will look after him to the best of my ability as long as Mr. Holmes and I remain here at Sherringford. I want that unfortunate gentlemen to get well – and he will. Mr. Holmes and I will see to it. Do you understand my meaning?”
I saw a shadow in the doorway and a sonorous voice called out: “Bring him in.” And then the shadow receded.
“Make yourselves at home in my parlour, gents,” said Mick, sweeping his arm to indicate the cramped cell. “Shall I order tea and crumpets? Sorry I don’t got a bench for you to rest your laurels upon, but I got plenty o’ straw you can sit on. And if you feel the need to relieve yourselves, the bucket is in the corner.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t want to crowd you two gentleman,” James asserted. “But I don’t mind sleeping with a cat. I love all animals. Like old Gladstone here.” He knelt and rubbed behind the dog’s ears. “Such a good dog he is, aren’t you, lad?”
“Splendid!” Holmes gave the young man a dig. “James, if you would carry the tray down for Mrs. Hudson?”
“He would not have been so ill-tempered if you had not been using him to test your noxious potions and malodorous elixirs.”
The hansom entered into a dark area of London. The streets were narrower and the houses older and in ill repair. But there was an air of activity – men darting in and out of public houses and other buildings that seemed to have a sinister purpose. But I saw well-dressed gentlemen as well, mingling with the lower orders.
I helped him off with his trousers and eased him back onto the mattress. And then I remembered something else we would need.
“That is something you should never neglect, Johnny Lad,” the Irishman replied. “Because we have unfinished business, you and I.”
Holmes sat up slightly, not at all discomfited by the young footman finding him lying next to me on the bed, his strong arm propping me up. “Good man, my dear James! Is there any word from my brother?”
I found digs just off the Cromwell Road and not far from Dr. Koenig’s clinic. The room was a basic bedsit, with the W.C. on the landing and half a window that overlooked the landlady’s back garden. But I didn’t really care because I spent almost every waking hour at the clinic. In truth, I buried myself in my work, which was exactly what I needed.
“No idea. Perhaps he had a brief Heavy Metal encounter there. Regardless of his choice of geography or his lamentable mixing of metaphors, Mr. Carson and I sadly parted ways.”
I squared my shoulders. “No success without the endeavour. I have my cane and stout boots. And a companion to lend a strong arm in need.”
“Eureka!” cried Oscar Wilde. “I believe you are correct, Robbie. Excuse me, my dear John, but are you aware of a gallery over in Bond Street? It is rather new. It’s called the Glendalough, although how it obtained that twee Hibernian moniker is beyond my understanding.”
It was an invitation to the opening of a new art gallery in Bond Street. Scribbled at the bottom were the words: “You will find something of interest here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”
Holmes pulled a dark French cigarette out of an engraved case and with it a gold-plated lighter. “Are you sure you don’t wish to join me?”
“On and off about a year,” said the lad. “I don’t always go there. I have lodgings in Clerkenwell, but they ain’t suitable to take a gentleman. I have a friend who sometimes lends me his room, but he’s in stir at the moment.” Thommie’s face went solemn. “He’s in trouble for certain.”
The cab ride from Holborn to Cleveland Street was the longest I have ever endured. Or at least it felt that way.
“You have a place where you belong, Watson,” said Holmes. “Which is by my side, my loyal companion and partner in crime-solving. Now go to sleep. In the morning I’ll show you the most fascinating place on the estate – the hives. You’ll find them riveting. And the beekeeper is a most amusing fellow.”
In the entryway I fumbled with my key, but the Irishman seized me with an iron hand and shoved me against the rough plaster wall. I thought he was going to kiss me and I held my breath, expectantly.
“I love you.” I finally manage to say. Reminding myself of the actual purpose of this “vacation” was not to cry about my past, ‘maybe when we come back’ I assure myself.  I raise my face and tiptoe to reach his lips. Just like the first time, sweet, soft and welcoming. “I love you too John. I fall for you a bit more every day.” He says without any pauses. “All of your experiences and difficulties… I want to cure them, to make them go away.” He confessed, “We have all the time in the world, Sherlock, I will let you cure them, every single one of them. And if you let me, I want to cure yours too.” I answered, knowing that when we come back home, not only our scar will be cured, but our biggest desire. I look at my watch, coming back to the present world, and notice we had just an hour before our plane closes its door. Sherlock must’ve noticed it too, he didn’t say anything, we just continued walking deeper into the airport. It took like less than 45 minutes to go through security and get our bags set. We were now at the door of my nightmare, but I wasn’t alone this time.
You did it! you go to the end! Give yourself a pad on the back, because who will read this trashiness.
“Do you want breakfast?” I asked while making tea, determined to feed my skinny, yet beautiful boyfriend. I raised my eyes and see his face on the frame of the wall, looking at me like I should already know the answer. I stop working on the tea, put my hands down on the table letting my head tilt down.
“John.” I heard a voice from being me. The same voice who left me on one knee, holding our future in our hands. I leave the keys on my pocket, everything has disconnected from my body. All that is able to function is my ears and somewhat of my feet. I slowly turn around, one step at the time, ready to face the man I love but the man who killed me. I am half way to face him, I really need to see his but to I also need to kiss him. I stop just inches from meeting his galaxy eyes, My hand senses the touch of the cold metal in my pocket, the keys.
“Ahh..” I moaned and served me as a way to catch new air. Because there wasn’t much air between Sherlock and me, I looked up to refill my lungs. When I do, he instantly took action and started to kiss my neck again.
“I agree, it's stunning,” Sherlock responds somewhere between a dry and emotional voice. There is a man, waiter, at the entrance. Makes sense because if he wasn’t there, we could’ve entered the wrong way and finish up in the kitchen by mistake. He is wearing a white shirt with space green vest and a black bow tie, along with black shoes and pants. The name card in his chest names, Dante.
Jesus Christ! UGH, how I hate him. The meeting started off ok, but as time went on, he started to passively insult me, and not just insult me, us. I and my commander have a little background story. But it's not important. He actually threatens me that he will take my teaching job and my house if I don’t fix what happened last night with the weaponry room. It wasn’t even my fault! It was my partner. He was the idiot who thought that smoking in that goddamed room is ok. My anger spread across my body and out of the sudden everything is hot. I know it is not good to drive angry, but I need to get this anger out somehow. I press in the petal hard and the car leaves wheels mark in the concrete floor. The air from my window blast in my face, which is actually helpful to the heat in me. Where should I go? OH! Where do I normally go to get drinks and pass down this discussion. My favorite bar/ stripper club. “Leopards” My hands' muscles take control and takes me directly to the bar I have been millions of time before. I'm getting closer and from the distance, I can see the light are off and the door is closed.
Sherlock nodded, driving out of the parking lot. He was silent most of the time, focusing on the road. After what seemed like hours Sherlock could feel John staring at him. “Do you need something Mr. Watson?”
John frowned and looked down into his lap. “I didn’t like her as much as I thought I did,” he said. “I mean, she’s nice, pretty, and smart but not someone I really want to date.”
The teen cleared his throat and he looked down. “Thank you for taking me here,” he said. “I really don’t think I would have made it to the kitchen if I went home.”
Sherlock could see that the man was tired, that he wanted to make things better with John. Though it wasn't the right time. Not yet. John needed to find himself, have time away from him. "It's nice to meet you as well," he returned. "John here was an excellent student of mine. He always had his work done and was the top of my class. I do hope you're proud of him."
Sherlock smiled as he watched him. He dropped his head to his chest for a moment, thinking about what was going on. He shook himself from his thoughts and drove away.
Sherlock looked him over. "From the looks of it you are ready for bed," he stated, referring to the boxers John was just lounging in.
Sherlock bit his lip and nodded. “You don’t have to thank me at all,” he assured him. “You’re a good student and you have great potential. I don’t want you falling behind because of something like this.”
The thoughts that were running through his head made his cheeks go red. He quickly pulled away from his teacher’s personal space and looked to the door. “Hey Mike,” he said, quickly getting his wits back to him.
Sherlock smirked, leading him to his car. He unlocked the doors and put his bag in the back before getting in himself. He waited for John to buckle up before he started towards the restaurant. “Your dad didn’t want to spend the night with you?” he asked after a while.
John nodded. “Of course,” he said. “I won’t hold you to anything.” He opened the passenger door and climbed in. He buckled up and settled down in the seat.
“Watson was defending himself,” Sherlock said. “He has no right to get the same punishment as the attackers do.”
Sherlock ruffled his hair and shook his head. “That’s disgusting,” he laughed. He frowned as John’s house came into view. They were closer than he thought. “Well, I guess I’ll see you Monday.”
At the end of the day John made his way back to Sherlock’s classroom, trying not to seem like he’s too excited. He didn’t want to make Sherlock think he just a giddy kid. But he was. He was so excited. This was going to be the best birthday in a while. He could feel it.
Mr. Jamison sighed and looked between the two groups. “Alright, suspension for all three of you,” he said. “John, you’re out of the rugby season for the rest of the year.”
Sherlock turned to him and put out his cigarette. “I was just starting early,” he told him, “thought I come out for a smoke.”
“John, it will be alright,” Sherlock said softly. “I’ll write my first letter in a week. To give you time to get settled.”
The air left his lungs and he just got off the ball to a teammate before he was slammed into the ground. The other player got up and ran after his new victim, leaving John on the ground.
After school though John would spend more time with him than at home. The weekends they would just spend at Sherlock's flat. John would let him do his work for a little while before demanding his attention. It wasn't his fault though. He didn't tell the other that he had signed up for the army, it was done before they got this close. He would be gone in August for training. He didn't want to tell him honestly.
After he collected himself he drove away from the home, thoughts of the teen and what he could be thinking swimming through his head. He wouldn’t sleep well at all.
John licked his lips and looked to Sherlock. “Fine,” he said. “If you want to do that Mr. Holmes, I’ll accept the ride, but this has to be the last one.”
John smiled and looked over at him. “Thank you again,” he laughed. “I don’t think I can really thank you enough for all you are doing for me.”
Sherlock smiled, happy he could make John smile like that. It was a good feeling. “Yes we can,” he said. “We can go out to eat, we can do whatever you want really.”
When the class ended John got up and went straight for the door. He didn’t want to stick around to get yelled at or make anything worse. After yesterday he was sure he ruined everything. John only wished he knew how.
When there was no response Sherlock gave up and went to sit in the living room. This was not how he wanted the night to go. If he could just get into John’s head for a second maybe he would be able to figure out what was wrong and help the other, but John didn’t even want that. Didn’t want his help.
Their dinner was quiet, John talked mostly about his upcoming rugby match, trying to convince Sherlock to go. Sherlock knew he couldn’t say no to the teen but he knew he could have fun with him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, sitting across from him. He shouldn’t have let this happen. He shouldn’t enjoy their time together so much. “I do too,” he hummed softly.
Shaking his head he pushed open the door to the classroom heading straight for the back hoping that the infamous Sherlock Holmes wouldn’t notice him. His teacher had quick eyes and could see almost anything that was going on. That’s why John wasn’t surprised to be stopped by Mr. Holmes just as he reached his seat.
Sherlock nodded. “I was doing it earlier, I can do it now,” he said. “Do you still need a ride today?”
Sherlock followed their path until they disappeared inside the locker rooms. He ran around until he found the door and pushed it open. John was found easily, lying on the bed in the sports exam room.
"Hey," she laughed. She looked at Sherlock. "Wow, it's a small world, Mr. Holmes.  I didn't think I would see you both here."
John quickly left the store and went to go sit in Sherlock's car. He waited for Sherlock to come out. He had to figure out how he was going to deal with this.
Sherlock shook his head. “Your nose is bleeding, you have a black eye, and your lip is split open,” he told him, “it is bad.”
John laughed at that, shaking his head. “No,” he said, rolling his eyes. “It’s my birthday idiot. Thanks for remembering.”
Sherlock let him. His hand went to the back of his head and he stroked his fingers through the short hairs. Suddenly it was no longer about him and all about John. He felt the fear and guilt behind the kiss. He felt the impending loneliness that they both would endure.
What was wrong with him? He never felt this odd in his whole life. He stood up and grabbed his cigarettes. He pulled on his jacket and left the room.
Sherlock watched him go and let out a small sigh of relief. John didn’t hate him as much as he thought he did.
Sherlock let out a small chuckle and nodded. “Yeah, you’re as bad as they get,” he murmured. “No one should let their kids near you.”
Sherlock clenched his jaw shut and he looked back down, a stone settling in his stomach. “Go,” he said, his voice flat.
“Let me drive you the rest of the way,” Sherlock said. “Please, I can’t leave you like this. If you don’t want me to drive you ever again I won’t.”
He led John to a secluded area before setting everything down. "I'm sorry we don't have a blanket," he smiled. "Still never replaced it in my car.
Sherlock watched him, letting out a quiet laugh. He was quite surprised he was asked to go to dinner again. He was excited though.
John shook his head. “I’m sure they’ll remember a lot more than they do now,” he said. “Have faith in your students.”
“Yes sir,” John said. He put his bag on a desk and rolled up his sleeves. As he started straightening out the desks he decided to speak up. “I’m sorry for skipping out on you yesterday, Mr. Holmes,” he mumbled.
Sherlock blushed, shaking his head. He kissed him gently before he started to get their food ready. Today was going to be a good one despite their hiccup.
The next day John went to class earlier then before so he could finish up the reading. He found his regular seat up front and started to skim through the paragraphs. He was startled from his reading by the deep voice of his teacher. “Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said with a smile.
When the bell rang he dismissed the class. He stood up, deciding to go to the teacher room for some coffee. He was going to need it.
Sherlock sighed and slowly sat back down. He scrubbed his eyes and took in a deep breath. What was he thinking? John was a student. He couldn’t be thinking about kissing the boy like that. He put his glasses back on and went back to grading until the bell rang.
Sherlock laughed quietly and shook his head. “You never will,” he said. “Now you better get inside and take that shower, you smell.”
John shifted and turned onto his back. “I think so,” he said, looking down at him with a sleepy look. He reached up and ran his fingers through his hair. “Morning.”
He read over it a few times before the words started to make sense. The town would be there at the end of the week if no one was going to clear out the house.
Sherlock brought himself to school the next few days. Not wanting to really see John, afraid he was going to develop more feelings for him but there was nothing he can do. He couldn’t call out just because he didn’t want to see a student. They had only a few weeks left and he could handle it.
Sherlock licked his lips and glanced down at their hands before looking at his face again. “That’s all they do,” he whispered, leaning in halfway, glancing at John’s lips then to his eyes.
Sherlock let out a puff as John hit him. "Hello there, Mr. Watson," he said with a smile. He had seen them talking, had seen how worked up John was getting. He didn't want him to do anything he may regret. "Congratulations on making it."
He pushed away from the desk, not looking back at Sherlock. “Did you catch the match that was on last night? My da was watching some crap last night.”
Sherlock smiled down at her. "Yes, well it seems Saturday is a shopping day," he said. He put the divider between his and John's things.
Sherlock let out a small laugh, letting his hand fall to his side. “Yes it was,” he said quietly. “Very wow.” He bit his lip, wondering if he could kiss him again. Though John beat him to it.
Sherlock gave John a small smile before he cleared his throat and stood up from his desk. “Alright, books away. We’ll be making things go boom today.”
John nodded. “Yeah, very sore,” he sighed, dropping his back against the seat. “It was much worse this morning. I could barely think straight.”
Sherlock smiled, standing up to meet his gaze.  “You really want to know?” he asked quietly. John nodded, licking his lips. The teacher grinned and leaned just a bit closer for dramatic effect. “You told me,” he whispered.
All of them piled into the principal’s office.  The principal, Mr. Jamison, stared at them all. “Alright, start explaining why you’re all in my office,” he said.
Sherlock nodded and tapped the teen on his shoulder. He knew the boy. “Mr. Banks, you and your friend here are coming with me to the office.”
Sherlock sighed softly, swallowing down his curiosity. “Yes, see you Monday,” he hummed. When the door was shut he let out a low groan and hit his head against the steering wheel.
Sherlock laughed softly as he watched the other run off. He went and grabbed them a few drinks that they both would enjoy. He found a few other things as well. He decided to go find John and stopped when he spotted him, but he wasn't alone. He saw Sarah standing with him and they were talking. Sherlock felt a knot of jealousy in his stomach and wondered if he should interrupt.
Something inside John fell and he had to put a hand to the wall to steady himself. Where was his father? Why would he leave without trying to contact John at all?
John rolled his eyes. “You seemed to be enjoying yourself today,” he hummed. “Did you see the looks I got when you announced I got the best grade?”
The man withdrew his cock and placed the boy on hands and knees. Then he put his mouth to Thommie’s nether regions, avidly licking and tonguing him, as the boy moaned loudly.
“It seems rather quiet tonight,” Holmes observed. His restless eyes were taking in every inch of the premises.
He slipped his arm under my neck and lay his head upon my shoulder – my scarred shoulder. But never had that mangled skin ever craved a touch so much.
That last night, after Final Affirmations, they had a small party for me in the Recreation Area. One of the nurses made a cake and there was Orange Squash and lemonade and it was rather jolly in a way. All the patients in my Group were there, minus Arthur, the Metallica fan, who had ‘graduated’ a few days before. But Betty, who was in long-term, was front and center, as well as Fred and the other counselors.
But it was already happening. Ivan’s hand was stroking my cockstand. His touch was deliberate, but also gentle. Just as he seemed to know instinctively how to relieve my shoulder and my leg, he also knew exactly what my manhood required. Ivan was not a partner in this act, as the enthusiastic and inventive Mick Wiggins had been, but merely an attendant to it. With only a few minutes concentrated indulgence, he brought me to a lusty fruition.
The young footman’s eyes were pleading. But his proximity to my person unsettled me. Although he looked nothing like another young man of my brief acquaintance – Mick Wiggins being slender and dark, while James was tall, blond, and as strapping as a Guardsman – they both roused a physical response I was loath to acknowledge.
“I have every right,” Holmes retorted. “Mr. Wiggins was formerly in my employ. And Mr. Mitchell is connected intimately to my client and his case.”
“No, that wouldn’t be right,” I said. “You must be hungry, James. Why don’t you go down to the kitchen? Mrs. Hudson will find you some supper and a place to sleep tonight.”
“No buts, John. No regrets. ‘If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended, That you have but slumber’d here, While these visions did appear, And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding than a dream.’”
But then a thought came to me. Perhaps if I enlisted her to my cause, she might help me? Might see her way to letting me escape?
Perhaps it was better he believed that. Then he would less likely to search me out. Less likely to ponder what had become of me in future days, or future years.
“But James, Mr. Holmes and I don’t require a valet.” The beginning of a major headache was forming in my temples.
“He’s the proprietor. The place is not a house in the way of, say, Madame Marie’s in Kensington, or Madame Clary’s in St. James, where the girls are resident. It’s more a house of assignation where boys bring gentlemen and are then provided rooms, although Wiggins says Hammond will arrange a boy for a good customer.”
“Two pints of bitter for me and the doctor here,” Wiggins called. “Sit yourself down, Doctor. Make yourself at home.”
“Quigley said to look for the third on the right side, with the faded red door and the broken knocker.” Holmes turned the handle and the door swung open. “It does not take a professional cracksman to enter any of these abodes.”
“I think you boys better go outside and talk over the details,” said Holmes. “We will keep watch by Dilly’s side.”
“If you entered that establishment, you would be shocked to see many of our finest men of letters cavorting there with common grooms, apprentices, and telegraph boys who supplement their incomes assuaging the perverse appetites of avowed sodomites.”
Anstruther shrugged. “As you wish, Watson. I will cover your practice as best I am able. But keep in touch while you are away.”
“That is putting it mildly,” Holmes laughed. “They revile me because I know when they’re lying. In Group you’re supposed to tell the truth, but they rarely do. For instance, when Betty first came here she told a story about her wonderful family and how supportive they were of her recovery. But it was all lies. Her husband left at least a year ago and her children are indifferent to her. She also has a harridan of a mother who screams at her during their weekly phone call and sends her religious tracts that implore her to accept Jesus Christ as her Personal Saviour or else be damned to Hell for her sins. She is in this dismal institution because she has nowhere else to go. And then there is Mr. Blake, the distinguished older gentleman.”
“My feelings for you are of no consequence,” I declared. “This is not about you. This is about Holmes. If this is what I must do to keep him safe, then I will do it.”
