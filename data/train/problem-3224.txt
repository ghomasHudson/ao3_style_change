"Look," he said more quietly, "Cas, he's one of us. He's family." Dean said. Sam nodded, satisfied enough with his brother's answer, although he still didn't fully understand Dean's feelings. But he knew questioning him would cause a fight. Dean threw back the rest of his whiskey. His eyes stirring with thoughts and decisions.
The familiar patter of his Sam's feet approached. Dean quickly dried his face to avoid any odd looks from his brother. Sam yawned and grabbed another whiskey glass as he sauntered in.
"There it is, Cas!" They ran faster now, the walls weakening every moment they were there. A bead of sweat rolled down Dean's sharp brow. They finally made it and dove through the opening, collapsing at Jack's feet. Seeing them, Jack fell back, unable to hold the door open anymore. For a moment, they all stared at each other breathlessly. Then Jack crawled over to hug Cas and Dean in an exhausted embrace. He laughed incoherently, which turned into happy sobs.
"I know Sammy. I'll be careful. Quick in and out trip." He said with the most reassuring smile he could muster. Sam gave his doubting half-smirk. He knew whatever he said wouldn't stop Dean from putting his life on the line.
She looked shocked, "You all never cease to amaze me. You keep fighting even when the odds are against you," She said, deep in thought.
"Hey, Baby," he murmured, running his fingertip across the side of the car. He walked back to the trunk and popped it open to reveal his bountiful collection of weapons. He wasn't sure what would kill The Empty. The lore never specified. So he took a bit of everything. His demon blade and angel blade strapped to his left thigh in a holster, A pocket knife in his back pocket, and a pistol tucked into the back of his jeans, for safe measure. He was about to close the trunk when his eyes caught a glimpse of a bloody bundle of fabric. He unraveled it to reveal the jacket he was wearing the night Cas was killed. Before Cas was taken, he had pushed Dean aside with the bloody hand he'd used to put up the warding against Billie, leaving a bloody handprint. He let out a weary sigh as he traced the stain. It was so weird that the stain he left was a handprint on his shoulder of all places. A few years back, when Castiel had rescued Dean from hell, he had left a scorch mark at the exact same spot on Dean's broad shoulder. Cas had held onto Dean so tight while rescuing him, he'd marked him. Dean smiled, remember Cas' retelling of how he, "gripped him tight and raised him from perdition." He stared at the jacket a few moments more and decided he'd wear it for good luck. It felt like a piece of Cas in some way, and if he'd have to walk into the empty alone, he at least wanted to have a part of someone with him. He didn't even realize Sam was standing in the doorway, smiling at him. "Hey uh…the spell. It's ready." Dean nodded, slamming the trunk and heading off, ready to save his angel.
"Dean, I knew the moment you drew a gun on Sam that you were being controlled by Chuck. He made you so angry, you would have done or said anything. It was his design, for you to be a weapon of destruction, breaking anything in your path even if it hurt you to do or say it."
"Come here, kid." They embraced, something they only did if their lives were on the line. "I love you, Jack," Dean said.
"Cas, hey, can you hear me?" Dean shook the angel's shoulders, but Cas did not budge. He cupped his face in his palms.
Sam pitied his big brother, "I'm so sorry, Dean," Sam said, trying to comfort him. It had been a long time since he'd seen Dean in this bad a shape. Sam shifted uncomfortably, knowing what question he must ask for clarity, "I've gotta ask: Do you…feel the same way, Dean?" Sam asked carefully. Sexuality was a weird topic he couldn't remember ever talking about with Dean before. Dean's eyebrows knitted together in defense.
As if Sam could read his thoughts, he said, "Unless you don't...want to?" He knew Dean always took things that happened with Cas personally; maybe it had something to do with their 'profound bond' Cas always brought up.
"I guess you're right," Dean smiled, "Happy anniversary, angel." Cas grinned toothily at the nickname. Even if Cas wasn't an actual angel anymore, he'd always be Dean's.
Dean knew he was probably right. Jack had just reset the world and become God, after all. "He's being tortured every second he's there. We should at least ask him. Or maybe research. Faster we figure how to open a portal to the empty, faster we can save Cas' feathery ass and bring him home." Sam nodded. Dean looked at Cas' carved name once more.
"One year with Dean Winchester as my boyfriend…a sentence if you told me a decade ago… I'd probably just stab you with my angel blade out of spite." The table broke out in laughter. They looked like a big happy family, and truthfully, they were. Dean and Cas smiled at each other and leaned into a kiss.
Jack contemplated in his mind for a moment before a small grin covered his face, "You deserve this, Castiel; your wish is my command," Jack said. And with a snap, it was done: Castiel was human.
"We should celebrate. We have beers and apple pie in the kitchen. And we could order some pizzas," Sam agreed.
Dean composed himself, "Well, I'm glad you got to see them. I'm glad you got to make amends." He said, "But what I'm trying to tell you, Jack is…What I said, what I've put you through...you don't deserve that, and I'm truly sorry. You mean so much more to me than you will ever know. You're family."
Dean looked at him with reassurance, "We figured, kid… you've done well. We knew you'd be pretty spent. That's why Sammy and I did some research. We think we have a plan." Jack's eyes lit up, ready to hear this plan of theirs.
Sam, sensing his presence, said, "I thought I'd cook us some breakfast. We'll need our strength if we're going to pull this off." Dean nodded as he waltzed over to the stove, eyeing the sizzling bacon in the pan.
The early morning sky eventually turned to a sleepy pink-orange haze above the bunker as the sun rose on the horizon. Sam and Dean polished off the bottle of Jack Daniels before they headed back to their rooms to get what few hours of sleep they could. They had decided that they would summon Jack after they rested up for their confrontation with The Empty. Dean walked idly back to his room and collapsed on his bed. He didn't feel tired, but he knew that he needed to sleep to have enough strength to rescue Cas. He looked at the ceiling of the bunker and day-dreamed about what he'd say to the angel when they were reunited. He was drawing blanks: what could he possibly say that could relate to him how he felt? Thank you? No, that didn't feel right. It's not every day; your best friend sacrifices himself and confesses his feelings for you in one fatal blow. With thoughts tumbling in his mind, he fell into a light bout of sleep. It wasn't until he smelled a wave of bacon that he shot up out of his slumber. When he made it to the kitchen, Sam was at the stove, scrambling eggs and frying bacon. Dean smiled. Sometimes he forgot just how much he and Sam had grown up. Sometimes he failed to remember that they weren't kids anymore, fending for themselves. A sense of pride washed over him as he watched his baby brother cook, even if it was a mundane task. Not only could they slash monsters, but they could also cook, somewhat. And by Dean's standards, he'd say they turned out pretty alright, all things considered.
"Look Meg, Empty, whoever the hell you are, I don't know why you can't get your stupid beauty rest, but I'm here to get Cas, end of discussion."
When Dean didn't answer, she continued, "When the angel had woken me up, I thought surely, surely if he was dead again, I could sleep again. But here I am, awake. I'm supposed to be able to rest now!" She said, getting angrier with every word. "So tell me, Dean, why am I still awake?"
"I love you, Cas. I don't know why it's taken me this long to say it. Maybe a part of me never...allowed myself to feel that way for you. Maybe this is something I've pushed away for so long I don't recognize what love even looks like anymore. But who else do I constantly think about? Who else would I put myself on the line for? Who else do I love the way that I love you?"
They hugged their son back. Eventually, Sam joined them, and they all were hugging and crying into one another on the floor of the bunker.
"I've thought about this a very long time. And I didn't ever think I would ever be able to ask with Chuck in charge of things, given our relationship. But now that you're in charge, I might as well try. I want to be…human." The table went silent.
Sam was shocked. A rush of emotions ran across his face. He couldn't believe it.  Had Castiel always loved Dean? All those times he answered Dean's prayers like it was his priority, their 'profound bond' was all that…love? He looked at Dean, holding back sobs now, and could tell that he was just as shocked by this revelation as he was.
Dean half-smiled fondly, but guilt weighed down his green eyes. "Cas had a plan to lure The Empty to take Billie. To do that, he told me about this deal he made. He…he said that to save Jack back up in heaven a few years back, he made a deal with The Empty… a deal that promised to take him when he was completely and totally happy."
Dean thought about how much he loved his life at this very moment. Everyone at this table, he loved. And they were happy. The world wasn't always in danger, and they were all together. He thought back to a year ago, how lost he was. He thought about that night where he couldn't sleep when he felt guilty and restless. He wasn't happy. Now look how much had changed. He knew tonight, with the world as it should be, his family happy and well, He would be able to find peace easily and rest assured that the man he loved was beside him. He knew he could lay his weary head to rest.
They were completely ignoring the red head at the moment, Dean watched delighted as Cas made his way over to him. Only standing about a foot away. Normally he’d be upset and give his usual lecture about personal space, but right now he didn’t mind the closeness.
Castiel wanted nothing more in this moment than to finally be with Dean the way they both clearly wanted. Dean made him feel safe, wanted. He never pushed too far and maintained a beautiful balance of soft and rough. He was the perfect partner in all aspects, always knew just what Castiel wanted in each moment. It was breathtaking, but more importantly it was easy. He didn’t have to think too much with Dean, but he couldn’t shake that dark feeling. Dick had been that way in the beginning….but then he took too much.
Dean took the chance of sneaking a glance at Sam and found him looking incredibly small and childlike sitting there. It drew Dean back to the days of their childhood.
cup he cut Cas off, he knows he’s a light weight. Gabe seemed to be on the same level as Dean. Both men were feeling it, but it hadn’t gotten quite where they needed to be.
Dean choked between bites.  This was how he’d die, with bread and meat in his lungs. He looked Cas in the eye and winced as his inhibitions began to falter.
“Thank you so much Dean. This is awfully sweet of you, I love it.” He gave Dean his gummiest smile, and he could see the unshed tears in his eyes. Dean’s heart clenched at the sight of him, and he had his own rapid blinking to do so he wouldn’t cry. If this was his reaction to the first gift, Dean was ecstatic thinking about how he’d react to what he would give him tomorrow. Chuck must’ve read Dean’s mind as their eyes met and he gave him a knowing smile and nodded his head.
“Thanks Cas. You look good yourself.” He took his time looking Castiel up and down, not trying to hide his interest at all, much like that first night.
“Well I don’t think we’ve been properly introduced.” She smiled, setting down the burger he’d gotten the last few times he’d been here.
Dean lightly pushed Castiel until he was standing next to him. He loved how protective the younger man was of him, but he was sick of being shielded. His father’s hatred had no foundation, no real reason for it in the first place, and he was fully intent on crumbling it to pieces and blowing it out of his life.
By the third month of them living with Bobby he had been transferred into the local high school. The only thoughts he had walking through the doors that first day was he hoped no one started bullying Johnathan again. He hadn’t heard from the other boy in quite a while and it was messing with him. The thoughts that ran through his mind did nothing to help his weakened mental state. Sam did his best to try to distract Dean when he’d shut down, made every attempt to make him laugh. It helped a little, but that’s only when his brother was around. When alone the darkness threatened his mind and often times he gave in.
He sat at the table with a freshly opened beer in hand and sat with his eyes focused on the table as if it held all the answers he needed. His heart broke to watch his brother in such pain. He was in pain as well as he’d grown to think of Castiel as a friend and a part of the family.
Dean felt good as he woke up that morning. It was the light coming in through the gap between the heavy green curtains of Castiel’s bedroom window that dragged him into the land of the living. Their positions had shifted, but they didn’t drift apart at all through the night. He was facing the window with Cas clinging to his back, the heat of midmorning causing sweat to form between them. Normally he’d balk at the feeling of too much body heat, this time was different in so many ways. For one he hadn’t had sex with or was related to the person he was in bed with. This was the first time he’d ever seriously dated a man. He’d been around the block, sleeping with whoever caught his eye, he never did have much of a preference. To go horizontal with someone and not take their clothes off was a totally new thing for him though.
With all the feel-good energy he got from the room stored close to his heart, he was ready to take care of business. First, he needed to get out of these clothes and freshen up. He felt filthy and without even needing to take a whiff he knew he didn’t smell great. He took a shower, loving how quick the water heated up and how it didn’t go cold after the first 5 minutes. Second, he had to get food. Not having eaten since the afternoon prior his stomach was starting a mutiny. The room came with a mini refrigerator and microwave combo, plus a coffee machine. That was quite exciting for him and opened up possibilities for what he could eat while he stayed here.
Dick cut his sentence short as the door was flung open and 3 blurs rushed into the room. Kevin shook with immediate fear at what was transpiring around him before he grabbed Castiel and moved to the far wall. A tall man with longish hair grabbed one of the goons and pinned him to the wall while hitting him in the stomach repeatedly, a police officer quickly disarmed the other goon and held his gun towards his head. His hands shot up and he dropped to his knees shivering in fear.
He felt the chair being turned around and as he was now face to face with the last person on earth he wanted to see, so he averted his gaze elsewhere. Two of Roman’s goons were in the room, sitting at a ratty looking table playing cards. He felt like he was in a cliché kidnapping scene in some low budget action film. All he wanted was to escape this place and get back to Dean.
Castiel didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what to think. All he knew in that moment was that Dean was probably going to kill Dick Roman and he had no clue how to stop him. He could feel himself shaking as he watched Dick take each blow worse than the last. His arms were up as he tried to shield his face, but that was utterly pointless. Dean put every fiber of his being into each punch and his one intention was to land them all. He could feel Dean’s anger from where he stood across the room, plastered against Kevin’s side. It was horrible to see his man in such a state of rage. He never wanted to see Dean like this ever again.
Anger bubbled up within him at the audacity this man had to not only talk to his father this way, but also to belittle his father’s reasoning to not wanting anything to do with him. He stomped over to the scene, pushing Gabriel and his father back with their smaller statures. Mr. Roman’s face dropped all signs of anger were wiped from his face and a look of surprise replaced it.
Several minutes later and he was faced with Dean in a suit. His gut swell with all the fuzzy feelings possible and something else dark and primal rang through as well. Dean looked incredible in all black. His tie matched his eye and it took a God level amount of self-control not to tug Dean inside and forget all about dinner.
It was cold, way too cold to be out here smoking like he was still in his rebellious teen phase. He relished in the buzz and leaned on the trunk of his car. It was clouding his head as he took another long drag letting the air flow slowly from his lips. He hadn’t even noticed the car that pulled up and parked a couple spaces away from his.
Castiel looked at his phone like it told him he was a billionaire. His father knew he smoked? This weekend was filled with too many firsts and it was only Saturday morning.
Once the bottle was finished Mark handed it back to him and wiggle trying to get off of his lap. He walked over, as best as his could on his little legs, over to his toy box in the corner. He pulled out a small red ball, about the size of his head and held it up walking back over to Castiel.
“You can stay if you want. I’m just grading some papers for my other classes. I may die if I have to read more terrible grammar alone.” He laughed.
“Are you gonna make me one?” Dean didn’t ask because he genuinely wanted one, he was more amused by his father’s antics than anything else.
Dean parked in the faculty lot and hesitantly got out of his car finally. He wracked his brain thinking of things he could possibly do with Cas while he babysat. Would he mind hanging out with Dean and the baby? Dean went into auto-pilot once inside his classroom. He taught as efficiently as he normally did with thoughts of Castiel lingering in the back of his mind. His eyes kept flickering to the clock on the wall praying that time would move faster and he could get to his phone to see if Cas texted him.
Cas: Hello Dean. Sorry I had to leave while you were still sleeping. Charlie wanted to have a study session. I cooked breakfast. Your plate is in the oven along with Sam’s. Have a good day J
“So I need you guys to read the next two chapters. I’ve already sent out the homework questions. They’re due the next time we meet. I want hard copies people. And for the love of God please spell check. You’re dismissed.”
Cas reached for Dean’s hand and once it was in his grasp he held it as if he was hoping Dean wouldn’t go anywhere. He tugged him towards the bed and he crawled back under the sheets with him, all while still holding his hand. He drew Castiel closer until he was laying on his chest. They laid in silence that was comfortable, no expectations for conversation, just enjoying each other’s presence. Dean knew he had a ton of things to do, but he wasn’t pressed to get any of it done in this moment.
“You—are you sure?” Castiel was taken by surprise. He shifts their intertwined position a little so that their eyes meet. “You don’t have too if it makes you uncomfortable.”
Dean hummed in response and Cas continued to lead him to his bedroom. Cas’ bedroom. He barely knew the dude a month and he was already getting to his bedroom. Cas opened the large black wooden door to reveal a room much like Dean’s but 3 times the size. He had a king size bed with black blankets and a million pillows of varying sizes and textures. He had two dressers. One with a tv on top, and his desk rested in the far corner of the room. Cas went to the opposite of the bed farthest away from the door and began to undress. Dean followed suite and he watched Cas…closely. His dick reminded him of its presence and he internally yelled at it to calm the hell down.
Dean then rushed out of the office and fled down the hall. Cas was crumbling on the inside. He just asked Dean the top question he promised himself not to ask. Charlie was a terrible influence on him. Giving him that friendly courage to go after everything he wanted. Supporting all his terrible decisions. But Dean was single . He didn’t have anyone.
Soooooooooooooooo sorry this is hella late. But my computer has been having some issues. Luckily I got that taken care of...for now. But I'm still alive and writing. I hand written the next couple chapters I just gotta type and edit them so updates will be quicker. As always thanks for reading. Please comment. It keeps my blood pumping! xoxo
She was right after all. Dean was mature enough to admit that much. Though he took everyone’s feelings into consideration he’d forgotten how they’d want to be a part of this with him. They loved him just as much as he loved Cas and it was in their right to come along and help Dean make sure his angel came back in one piece. Dean’s life was now a B rated action movie and there wasn’t anything he could do to stop it. Castiel was a stubborn son of a bitch and he assumed his family would be the same. They were all in this with him whether he liked it or not.
They both decided it was high time to go to sleep and not get ahead of themselves. Dean was just getting use to kissing another guy, going any further than that was downright terrifying.
“Well we were just hanging out watching movies and suddenly dad shows up. I thought it was you so I just opened the door. He said he had to tell me something then he noticed Cas and it just spiraled out of control from there. How did Cas even call you?”
“Yeah yeah, I can smell the weed from here. I’ll talk to you later son. Love you.” And with that he hung up.
“I don’t have a mirror in my shower Dean! And it wasn’t shampoo, I was deep conditioning my hair so it just sat on my head while I washed the rest of my body.”
Dean slipped from the room and went into his bedroom. Castiel let out a quiet sigh. He’d have to tell Dean all the things he discussed with Sam and he really wasn’t sure that he wanted to do that. But it would be for the best not to keep secrets between them. He looked at his phone hoping something interesting would pop up that would distract him. What he found was another text from Dick that he would happily ignore.
Sometime later everyone he loved was seated around the table and digging into the food he helped make. His heart swelled at the plethora of happy eating sounds, especially from Cas who hadn’t looked up from his plate since it was sat in front of him. It was bitter sweet that John wasn’t there, on one hand he wished that his Dad would just get his shit together and finally be the solid figure that a parent was supposed to be, but on the other he was glad he wasn’t there throwing around all the drama he came packaged with.
Castiel nodded in response and followed Dean towards the living room. They ended up with Sam and Ruby, holding Mark, chatting happily about all of their careers. This caused Dean to go in a whirlwind of a rant about his students’ lack of basic grammar knowledge, it was funny to listen to, so they laughed. Castiel noticed that even though Dean was down, seeing other’s happy and light caused him to be the same. Sure he could still feel the dark cloud that loomed over his boyfriend’s head, but Dean seemed much better now than he was in the kitchen. It warmed his heart to see that his loved ones had such a positive effect on him.
Missouri herself was a stern, but friendly woman, he also suspected had a great deal of patience. She trained him on everything he needed to know to do his job efficiently. He was grateful for her thoroughness, so it left little room for error on his part. It also made him happy to know that he’d be receiving his paycheck weekly, so he could closely budget himself.
The joint was empty for the most part and with Cas being who he was didn’t talk much just kinda sat there sipping on his water. This gave Dean’s mind too much room to wander. He was happy to be here with the man, but he had no idea if their intentions lined up. Cas must’ve felt Dean staring. He looked up and a small smile pulled at the corners of his mouth.
“If you aren’t ready to tell me that’s fine. We all have our demons.” Cas spoke in between hefty bites of the plate of food. “This is amazing by the way. The best plate of eggs I’ve ever had.”
The giant man—Sam—stepped aside letting him step into the entry way. On the left wall behind the door was a large mirror and a coat rack, a bowl containing varied amounts of keys sat on a little end table. As he stepped further inside, feet gliding under him on the shining wood floors, he was assaulted with the heavy, happy scent of home cooking and family. It was a heavenly smell that wrapped its warm arms around him as he was greeted by Mary and an older man, he assumed was her husband. The smiles on these people’s faces were so open and honest that all the nervous energy that pent up inside him was now melting away. Of course, it was reinstated as he saw Dean walk through the front door.
“So Dean, I know it might not mean much coming from me,” his father began, “But I think I got a way to help your boyfriend.”
“No—I was just told about the two he’s keeping close. The 3 of them are armed, not sure about the others.”
They walked in and were immediately greeted by Jo and her bouncy personality. She hugged them both and whispered something inaudible in Dean’s ear. He couldn’t hear her over the blaring music erupting from the speakers at each corner of the room. He made a mental note to ask her about it later. He scanned the room carefully looking for those striking blue eyes and the messy bedroom hair, instead he spotted Charlie furiously waving him over.
After plating up there food they sat in mainly silence watching a documentary on the Animal Planet and chewing their food. Castiel happily ate and texted Dean trying to offer comfort for the man’s boredom. In mid conversation he received a phone call from an unknown number. Reluctantly he answered and was stunned at how much noise was happening on the other end.
The most beautiful hue of pink rose up on the man’s cheeks, his full lips formed a tight line in embarrassment. “Shut your damned mouth Joanna Beth.”
“I’ll drive you and your car home. Dean you can take Cas right? Just pick me up from Charlie’s house.” Sam shot him a knowing look.
“I don’t do it often if you can’t tell. I only do that when I feel I can trust someone else with that kind of control over me. Now that I know you’re an awesome top I’m down for it whenever you are.”
“While it was sitting right next to you?” Cas looked at the device sitting on the couch. Precisely right next to where Dean had been sitting.
Castiel was now having a mini internal freak out. He’d never been around kids since he was the youngest of his brothers who were all much older than him. He didn’t know the first thing about keeping a child company. He walked to the playpen and looked down on the child who looked up at him with wide wonderous eyes. Immediately a smile spread on his small face and he put his arms up like he was reaching for Castiel.
“Hey now. Sure your mom didn’t raise you to be a liar.” Dean chuckled and shoved the smaller woman playfully.
With the wine bag in hand he took his time making his way over there. He was nervous and could feel the evidence of it in his shaking hands. What was expected of him? Surely these people were quite friendly and talkative if he were going by what he’d experienced from two members of the family. They’d talk and he couldn’t just sit there and listen like he usually did; he’d have to participate like a regular person and that was daunting in itself. His people skills were extremely rusty outside of commonplace politeness. Castiel was a loner, use to the life of solitude. He wasn’t happy about it, but he was certainly use to it, having no one but himself to keep him company.
“Charlie. We need to talk. Can you meet me in the back lot?” Cas talked into the phone keeping his eyes out in case Dean could spot him.
“Dean I was—actually wondering if you um wanted to stay the night?” he could feel the heat on his face and sweat in his clenched hands.
“Yeah it was a riot in there. I tried to go after you, but when all of that broke out I had to break it up. I couldn’t leave Ellen there all by herself. Then Jo came home and it escalated from there.”
“You trying to cop a feel over here?” Dean joked, but his voice sounded much deeper than his usual tone.
“I just want you to know I’m here for you.” Cas buried his face in the crook of Dean’s neck and stayed there.
As he imagined it, he found that he liked that idea the best. Now he just had to bring it up to the other man.
“Sam—you were too young to know this. Dean was even too small to know. Your mom and I,” he paused to let out a heavy sigh, “We didn’t mean for her to get pregnant, different time back then. I married her in her 4th month of the pregnancy. Don’t get me wrong I loved your mother for a long time before she had Dean, but we were both so young back then. Barely knew how to take care of ourselves let alone a newborn baby. But I had a plan and that plan required going to school so I did. For business. Wanted to open my own shop so I could provide for the little family I created. Worked all the way through school and graduated a couple months after you were born.”
“You’ve been so into Dorothy we haven’t had time to sit down and talk.” He took a sip from his hot coffee.
It didn’t sit right with Castiel that Dean had given him that wonderful dinner and bath time for their 6 month anniversary and he hadn’t done anything in return. He spoke about this with Balthazar, which of course the man jumped on the opportunity for them to go shopping together. The possibilities were endless on what Castiel could buy for him, but he couldn’t settle for just one. His friend would hardly be any help since he didn’t know Dean very well. He decided a good course of action would be to text Sam, see if he could offer some guidance. He’d suggested that he got Dean some clothes, that could work.
Castiel picked the Saturday after he moved in. His space was finally coming together. He got his meditation corner set, groceries and small cooked meals in his fridge, decorative pillows on his couch, and even some fresh flowers in a vase on his coffee table. Tonight, was his first night in the apartment, Dean had just left not too long ago. Why he was nervous about sleeping he wasn’t too sure. The man had insisted on helping to clean up after dinner, but he’d shooed him out since he had to work early in the morning. Missouri had given him the Monday off, saying that he needed time to get acquainted with his new living quarters. How she knew that was a custom for him, he didn’t know, but nonetheless it was nice that she was willing to give him time to do so. The plan was to get a full night’s sleep, then first thing in the morning he was to have an intense meditation session, in thanks for the blessings of shelter. Then he was to eat a full breakfast and go commune with nature. A nice walk to the library would suffice. He was overdue for some research, finally find out what that spirit was that visited him. The last time he’d been there he didn’t find much, but he was also heavily distracted by thoughts of a certain sandy-haired man. The only issue was that he couldn’t yet fall asleep. Tea, some reading, even a little relaxing music he was able to play on his phone didn’t help him get any more tired.
Armed with grocery bags of different sizes, and a duffle bag, he waltzed right inside Castiel’s apartment with that confident gait that drew him in like a moth to a flame. He could see the distinct shape of beer bottles through the plastic of one of the bags, but he couldn’t tell what was inside the others.
Forever seeking to please he complied instantly, plowing into the heat of Dean’s flushed body. He felt the tell-tale signs of his impending orgasm. As much as he wanted to stay like this forever he wanted the climax to happen. He’d never experienced such heights as this with any of his past partners.
Shopping? Dean had barely realized it was December until it was brought up. He would have to buy for Bobby and Ellen, they would of course being throwing another family dinner he’d have to attend. He’d have to get Sam something, he already had an idea of what he would get him. He’d have to buy for Mark, he was only 1 ½ so he’d be the easiest to shop for. Then there’s Castiel, what on Earth would he get him?! Dean was silently panicking as he took a sip from his beer and nonchalantly nodding his head. Of course he had no idea what to get the other man, and yes Dean just needed more stress to add to the forever growing pile. He hadn’t even thought about what he wanted. Usually he’d have a shiny neat list written out on some notebook paper that he would give Sam to spread the ideas around. This year he was severely lacking in Holiday organization.
Since Castiel’s arrival it’s been a time for many a new thing for Dean. He’d taken the man on a date ( just one so they should probably go on another), he took a very roundabout way of introducing the man to his family, though much of that credit should go to his mother’s insistent nature. Cas was growing to be important, definitely beyond what the prophecy called for. No one questioned his quickly enlarging attachment to the man, his duty to befriend him was enough and it was finished, but they just let him keep going. There was no stopping Dean, even if they hadn’t approved, this would be the direction they were headed for and at this point only Cas had the power to put a stop to the progress. Missouri always smiled at him with that knowing smirk of hers, Mom thought he was the cutest thing since Sam was a baby, Dad didn’t say much but he seemed to like him just fine, and Sam threatened him for crying out loud. All of this was his mashed up family’s way of giving their blessing.
“Well I’m glad you’re doing something you love. I should’ve known the shop wouldn’t keep you forever.” He smiled.
Hands appeared on his backside as those full set of lips went back to work against his own. He ground down on Dean’s arousal, swirling his hips as the heat between them began to rise. Hands gripping his hips tightly, Dean began to rise off the couch. Instinctively he wrapped his legs and arms tighter around the other man. Castiel knew he was strong, but they were relatively close in size so he never expected the man to be able to lift him like this. With careful steps he carried him to the bedroom, laying him down softly atop the blankets and pillows as if he was a precious thing. He climbed on top of him, hands braced around his cheeks, body flat on top of the other. His kisses took on a softer nature, not as hurried as before. On one arm he propped himself up on his elbow and with the other he trailed down Castiel’s chest.
“Hey, we don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.” He kneeled on the floor in front of his man where he sat on the bed. He took both his hands in his, tangling long, soft fingers with his calloused ones.
A small scuffle could be heard on the floor above him. Guessing Dean was upstairs he went up and followed the noise to a slightly ajar door. Should he just enter? Why wasn’t Dean answering him? His answer came in the sound of a breathy low moan. He should probably make himself known, to the man, but maybe he would look for just a second. Moving slowly he turned his body to look through the couple inches of view. It turned out to be perfect as it was right in line with the bed. Dean’s back was to him, one hand holding the headboard, the other one busy with a dildo in his hand.
“Any activities that you can possibly do with another person?” he cackles and heads around the room turn in their direction.
“Well I get off in a few, if you wanna wait we could head over to that diner by the Inn. Get some dinner. Have you eaten?”
None the wiser the two men raised from their seats, Castiel trailing behind Dean towards the back of the house. Later the man would look back on this moment and remember it as Mary’s thinly veiled attempt at getting the two of them alone. The night was calm here, that’s the first thing he’d noticed as he began living here. It was all hustle and lazy bustle during the day, but once the sun went down, so did everyone else. He was glad for the change of pace this place brought as compared to the other places he’d travelled to. Always cities, where he was just a face in the crowd. He hadn’t settled in a country-like setting since the night he ran for good. Couldn’t take the quiet, and people knowing his name. He didn’t know why he stayed here, could’ve easily stayed the night, and continued on. Here he stood in the backyard of a common mother, and with him was her gorgeous son. He’d spent dinner with these people, probably would be invited back once more. Dean explained all that he planned for his mother’s garden, he spoke with such passion and ease that you would only expose to a friend or a lover. With those grass green eyes, alluring frame, and vibrant sense of being Castiel could easily seeing himself being one or the other.
Dean laughed at the scene playing out in front of him. His giant little brother always tried to sneak his big ass in the kitchen every year in search of some scraps he could steal before dinner was served. Each and every time he was chased out with nothing to show for it. Yet another Christmas tradition that he thoroughly enjoyed.
“Yeah that you would be his ‘undoing’, again his words.” Bobby laughed again due to the obvious confusion on Castiel’s face. “He was worried about liking you and whether you’d want to partake in the taboo of dating your teacher. Either way it worked out for the both of you. What you studying?”
“Any time Cas. But although this leaf water was good I should probably go home and get ready for our date. Shower and all that.” Dean untangled his legs from around his boyfriend and stood up walking towards the door.
“Yeah I thought it would be fun to kick back and just be young for awhile. Do you want me to push you on the swings?”
Dean shot Sam his meanest glare. He loved Bobby and Ellen, but he hadn’t wanted to discuss such a disappointing moment. Sam didn’t buckle under it though, he stood firm knowing he was right in letting them know.
“The one and only. Sorry I just kind of pulled off. It didn’t dawn on me that you were there until I was halfway down the road.”
And there it was. Dropped from a sunny sky was the one question he never wanted to be asked. It was why he didn’t get close to people. It wasn’t that he didn’t have an explanation, he certainly did and a tragic backstory to go along with it. The kicker was, he wanted to be close to Dean, far more than he’s wanted anything in a long time. This man was so full of light, raw, and genuine compassion. He put his whole being into caring about the ones around him, and somehow he deemed Castiel to be a part of that small group of people.
“You shouldn’t have. But what would this entail? I just film you at a random location and that’s it?”
Ken had cleaned himself up and caught Gabriel, who just returned from who know where, in conversation. Dean had gone to the bathroom to do the same. He took the opportunity to hot tail it out of there.
“I’ve been texting that girl I met last night and we have a date set up for tonight. So I have every right to be happy.”
“Yeah and while you’re apologizing you could be fixing this piece of junk you call an air conditioner.”
“Of course. If your mother’s cooking comes anywhere close to yours I’d be an idiot to say no.” he smiled.
Dean ignored his brother’s scrambling around the kitchen for formula and pulled out his phone to text Cas.
“Oh right…sorry I—“ she stammered, “Well what does Dean like? Do you think he’d be into the romantic style of doing things or rough, edgy stuff?”
Now they were in the car, driving in silence, nothing but the sound of the wind ripping through the cracked windows. Castiel shivered a bit at the cold air, but he wouldn’t complain. The mood in the car was so dead it matched the November air, and he didn’t want to ruin the silence, for fear that it would either set Dean off or he would shut down entirely. He certainly would not question the things he had heard tonight. Those were very personal matters that Dean hadn’t told him about, he felt in due time they would have that conversation, but Dean wasn’t ready. For it to just burst out like that, he had no preparation, no mental readying before diving into something like that. Castiel had many questions, but he kept them quiet.
They had breakfast an reminisced about last night. Dean knew how not thrilled he was going into it but was glad that he eventually enjoyed himself. Thankfully the man let him know that while they had events often this was the only one that was mandatory, therefore, the only one he showed to. The topic of the slimy man came up of course, he now learned his name was Alistair.
“The shop’s not the same without you son.” Dean heard the voice of his father and every muscle in his body locked up. If Bobby wasn’t still hugging him he was sure he would’ve fell to the floor like a pile of broken bricks. Bobby let go of him and stood at his side now, offering silent, solid support. Sam rejoined them and stood at Dean’s other side. John stood on the other side of everyone in the doorway of the kitchen.
“You give me way too much credit Cas.” Dean squeezed his arm around Cas’ waist and kissed the top of his head.
“Don’t you dare call me that. And don’t come near me again.” His voice deep and bellowing. He was never more serious about the words that left his mouth then he had been at this moment.
There’s something to be said about Dean being in his apartment. The union blessing/housewarming went much better than he anticipated. He didn’t realize so many people wanted to celebrate him getting his own space. They were essentially celebrating the fact that he was going to stay in Lawrence. It felt ore like an initiation into their family than anything else. Castiel now had more food than he knew what to do with. That’s how he found himself here, watching Dean once again moving around his kitchen like there was nowhere else in the world he’d rather be. Packing some of the foods people brought into Tupperware that would be stored in the freezer for later and others that would be used as lunches for work and dinner. Since they started the furnishing of this place Castiel had enjoyed Dean being her more and more each time. He enjoyed it so much so that though the party was over, he didn’t want the other man to leave. He hadn’t even realized Dean was finished until he started talking.
Gabriel was talking to Dean in the corner. That was all fine and dandy, but the co-star, Ken (because of course that was his name), seemed to latch on to himself and would not stop talking. He was shirtless and bright eyed, clearly excited to shoot with Dean and it was at this point that he reached his peak of uncomfortability.
If Sam were here he’d shoot him bitch face #57 and revel in the fact that he was right. Dean internally rolled his eyes at the thought.
“You zoomed in on my hole Cas?” he sighed. “Did you like how it looked? All that shiny lube, bright blue dildo going in and out of me.”
“Oh Cassie come on don’t be like that. And you Balthazar, I’m surprised at. Treating me like a leper are we?” he slowly took steps towards them.
For the remainder of the night they sat on the living room couch, hand in hand and a nursing a beer in their free ones. Dean was filled with warmth of spending such a beautiful time with all those closest to him. Conversations took place among the adults, while the children loudly played with all their new toys. The heavily spiked eggnog raised the overall volume in the room, but Dean was welcoming of it all. Cas was engrossed in an environmental conversation with Sam, while he playfully joked around with Bobby.
“While being…intimate some things I just can’t bring myself to do. It just takes me back to that night.”
Castiel’s heart swelled at the friendly way his father was acting towards Dean. He’d never been a hard man to be around, but to see him so accepting of Dean was a nice sight to see. The kitchen looked a mess, there was goop on the walls that looked like potato guts, there was grime on the counter where it looked like something was spilled. It looked like his father had went on a food rampage and poor Dean had to hold it all together. He could smell the wonderful scents that flooded the air from whatever was in the oven so it truly couldn’t have been that bad. He walked around to where Dean was explaining to his father how to make sure the collard greens don’t burn and wrapped an arm around his waist.
“So have you…found someone here that you like?” Dean nervously played with the hem of his worn t-shirt. Since the day he first met the guy and they’d began to spend more and more time together, Dean was slowly beginning to see him in another light. First it was the boy’s gestures and mannerisms that would get to him, then it was the lingering touches that sent electricity flowing through his fingers, then it was his eyes that made him weak, and the smile that made him feel warm. At first it was a shock to him, to find another guy attractive, he’d resisted it at first, but he just couldn’t separate himself from his friend. Now he was trying to find out information, as lightly as he could.
“He’s a tough cookie. He’ll make it through this. I’m just happy he has such a caring boyfriend like you Dean.”
“You look stressed.” Dean chuckled at the whole ordeal. “You’ve gotta cut the vegatables with some fruit so they’ll eat it.”
As Dean assumed would happen Cas woke up before him. He opened his eyes and looked at the bare part of the bed and missed the warmth of the body next to him. He heard groaning coming from his bathroom and that drew him out of bed. He found Cas cuddled up with the toilet half conscious. Poor thing was so hungover he didn’t know what to do with himself. Dean got the awesome idea of trying to princess carry Cas back to bed. As he bundled up his limp body and tried to stand he could feel his legs screaming for relief. Cas was way more solid than he thought. But he grinned and bared it and dumped his boyfriends body in bed.
“Bottoming is messy.” He grimaced, no doubt feeling the after effects of letting Castiel come inside him.
He sat there until the tears had all dried up and he just shivered in his wrecked state. That’s when he spotted the bottles of his medication. He’d heard how people could die from taking too many pills, he just wasn’t sure which one would work. Willing all of his limbs to work for him, he reached up and grabbed the handful of bottles, figuring if he took a bunch of each they would do the trick.
“Alright love birds show me the way.” Gabe sighed. “Since you two are getting some I might as well use one of the numbers I got at that place.” He grumbled.
Finally dressed in some gym clothes he sat down to tie his new running shoes on and decided it was a good time to check his phone. Emotions beyond glad overcame him as he glanced at the messages he’d received from Dean. It was a picture of the sunrise, all the beautiful warm hues, and the moon’s lingering image. It looked like a painting on Dean’s fancy smart phone and Castiel immediately saved the image to his own photos. Under it the caption read: Ain’t this a pretty country sunrise? Wish you were here to see it with me. For someone who claimed they weren’t good with words, Dean always managed to say the most genuine things to him. A small smile crept onto his face as he thought of what to say back. Their date was tonight and he was equal parts terrified and excited. His biggest hope was that he didn’t make a fool of himself. It was a small comfort that the man seemed highly understanding of his horrid people skills and lack of pop culture knowledge. With that in mind he replied: Looking forward to seeing the sunset with you tonight.
Castiel knew that it was customary to end a date with a kiss so he leaned into the man’s space to do just that. Those full lips found their way into many of his thoughts since he’d first seen Dean. He wasn’t sure where all this confidence came from, probably the ease that Dean carried himself with was rubbing off on him. As their lips met it took a second for Dean to get on board with the program but when he did it was glorious. His plush lips were warm and slid against his with ease. This was far better than his first kiss. Dean was practiced and not nervous at all. He coaxed his lips open with his tongue and when they met, well that changed everything. A soft, long moan filled the car and it took a moment for Castiel to realize it was his own voice. A heat bloomed within him that he never knew before. Dean must’ve felt it too because his kisses grew deeper and more forceful. It was such an honest, raw sense of bliss. As Dean pulled away, he tried to chase his lips to keep that feeling.
If it wasn’t so dark in there Dean was sure Cas’ penetrating gaze would cause him to blush all shades of red, but for now he was sporting a soft crimson. Cas bent to kiss Dean’s chin and he could feel the smile on his lips.
Rushing to the kitchen, he repeated all the steps that Sam had shown him and heated up the bottle. He fiddled around trying to hold the squirming child still against his hip so that he could test the temperature on his arm. It felt ok and with a shrug he took it to the couch and sat down. Mark laid back on his right arm and laid the rest of his body across Castiel’s lap before reaching for the bottle in his hand. When he popped it into his mouth he held it and drank quickly. Castiel looked down into his big brown eyes and sighed in relief that the boy didn’t cry. Maybe he wasn’t as clueless as he thought he was. Mark was obviously comfortable enough with him that he failed to realize that his father was nowhere around.
“You told the camera before you started that you hadn’t jerked off in two weeks. That was very apparent by the amount that came out of you.”
Yes Gabriel just needed to add his two cents in. Even though it was highly unwanted and Castiel couldn’t even figure out why he was even in his room right now.
Dean quirked up his eyebrows at that. He never pegged Cas as a phone conversation kind of person. He stepped out of the kitchen into the living room and dialed his number. It rang a couple times then the line connected.
He went back and fixed bits and pieces of the video, and he felt Dean subtly shift closer. As the part with the small vibrator played, Castiel was completely aroused. This was a mistake, a terrible mistake. The heat from his laptop was getting to him, and the weight of it did nothing to dampen his arousal. He made a point not to move, any bit of friction and he was done for.
“Well her name is Ruby. She’s a nurse. She’s really into her job but hates her boss. She’s pretty intense but I can tell she has this soft tender side about her and…”
“Well usually I wouldn’t deny hanging out with you, but a couple of Charlie’s friends wanted to study later, and she begged me to come so I had to say yes.”
A sensation he was familiar with, but unaccustomed to waking up to. As his brain caught up to what was happening he looked down to find the pants and boxers he was wearing were around his knees and Dean’s head was between his legs. On a particularly strong amount of suction he had no choice but to moan at, the man finally noticed he was awake.
“So what brings you to Lawrence Castiel?” John took a sip of his whiskey filled glass, fixing Castiel with a serious expression.
Dean. Such a simple name, but tied to this man gave it such powerful weight. It didn’t help with all the bass in the man’s voice as he spoke it. Castiel’s stomach fluttered as Dean motioned for him to sit in the lone chair that stood in front of his desk.
“Enough about me. Who’s this lady you’ve been seeing?” Castiel got up and tossed the half smoked blunt in his ash tray for later.
Dean reached up and ruffled Sam’s long hair like he did when they were kids. He hesitated before answering. Almost taking Sam up on his offer, but his mind flashed back to how Cas had told his own story, not a crack in sight. He needed to see this all the way through.
“Which reminds me I should probably take mine.” Dean reluctantly withdrew himself from Cas remembering the only thing masking his horrid morning breathe was a cup of coffee and a plate of food.
“I don’t know how you do it Cas. Somehow you manage to turn me on, look adorable, and crack me up with the wild things you say.”
Hugging his coat tighter around his body he waited for the bus to come. He didn’t have a particular destination in mind, just knew that they were getting closer and he needed to leave immediately. Wherever this bus’s last stop was, was where he’d get off. The wind whipped around him, telling him it was time to go. He’d seen it in his latest vision, but the weather was further confirmation that he needed to get out of there. He’d tried ignoring it once, and almost met his demise.
He should’ve known Sam would be the only one to treat him so abrasively. His skin was going numb, but all in all it actually felt good. The sweat from the alcohol and overall stress was being washed away. The bottom of the tub was starting to fill and because of body heat it was much warmer than the icicles that were falling from above. The contrasting temperatures were doing his body good. He looked up at his brother to find him with his arms crossed in front of his chest and a disapproving gaze on his face. Dean was in for it now.
Once all clothes were removed, both men gingerly stepped into the oversized tub sitting opposite of one another. Dean handed Castiel a washcloth and began dipping his own into the water, starting with his chest he watched as the man began cleaning himself. They were quiet for the most part, Castiel stuck in his thoughts, so he hadn’t noticed that Dean had moved to his side. He was on hands and knees between his own outstretched thighs, face open and eyes glistening. He went in for a kiss slow and tender their lips slid against one another. Dean slid forward so he was sitting on his heels. Damp, calloused hands slid their way from the backs of his calves up to the tops of his thighs. Bracing his hands on the other man’s shoulders, he leaned forward to continue the kiss. The water was warm but the hands roaming his chest were even hotter. He wasn’t sure if it was the actual temperature of Dean’s skin or if it was the effect his skin left as they made contact. Castiel could feel the usual spatters of arousal began forming down below. It ratcheted upwards quickly as his nipples were pinched by experienced fingers. He’d never tried this on himself and it could be just because it was Dean, but the sensation between pain and pleasure was driving him mad with excitement.
Dean looked up, and when he did he was definitely looking at Castiel now and not the camera. Unconsciously he had moved forward even more, standing right at the edge of the bed. His legs were no longer in the shot now, it was just his furiously moving toy hand and everything above it. His moans were constant now, the man was clearly about to orgasm.
Dean watched Cas leave sad that he couldn’t stay and talk longer. Not that Dean really had anything to say. For Cas being practically a stranger he wanted him around him so badly. Wanting to be closer to his student. Closer than close.
Head thrown back, he mewled, probably from the overstimulation. He wasted no time just like before and began to ride Castiel slowly. Hips swiveled as he rose and turned the opposite direction as he lowered back down. He was gorgeous and phenomenal in his movement.
Castiel felt like a man possessed. He was almost trembling now, the need to move, to get something, was getting to be too much for him. Like a coil pushed down tight, he was bound to spring the second the pressure eased up.
“Dean I can’t—you got me a car!” Dean could hear the tears in his voice. Well I guess he likes it, he thought.
“Usually no one really comes out here. This is our smoking spot. But the more the merrier.” She spoke pulling a blunt and lighter from her coat pocket. She handed Dean his own blunt and flashed that sneaky grin again.
Dean agreed, he could take the straightaway edge to Dean by himself. It would be harder to do the turns so they’d work on that after. He skated away until he was just before the turn and moved to face the other man. His death grip was back, but this time it was the wall. Dean watched as several emotions passed across his face until it was set at sheer determination. His hand loosened until just his fingertips grazed the material and when he got his balance he glided one foot in front of the other and moved forward. He was still quite slow, but his strides were strong. The confidence shown on his face and he grinned. Dean watched in awe, not so much at his skating ability, but at how much he wanted to be by Castiel’s side as he discovered all the things he was capable of. The too bright spotlights spun above their heads, a stark contrast to the darkness of the building. Blues, reds, and greens flashed over Castiel’s face, but nothing was brighter than his eyes in that moment.
He was now tied with his arms at his front and his legs were tied together, plus he was laying down. He was much more comfortable like this, except for the fact that how his mouth was gagged again and his eyes were covered. By the random bumps and interval like stopping he could tell he was in some sort of vehicle. Where in the hell were they taking him??! He tried to ignore the swelling dread within him, and the fact that there wasn’t enough air in here. He couldn’t panic. Not now. He decided to think of Dean and what he would say if he were here right now. Of course he wouldn’t be in this situation if Dean was here, but that wasn’t the point.
“Yeah no I get that. I don’t mind driving you. I could find something else to do while you hangout.”
“What do you think is happening Dean?” Cas couldn’t bring himself to make the first move like he had that night after the club. It was so out of his territory. He’d always been the one to be approached. Never made a decision without being prompted first.
“I understand Dean. I shouldn’t have pushed you to talk about it. I’m not ready to talk about…Dick ,so you shouldn’t feel pressured to talk about your dad.”
Dean was halfway to the car when he realized that he admitted to Cas being his boyfriend. ‘Dammit Dean!’ he cursed to himself. He drove the short distance towards the man’s house to find Charlie’s car not outside. It was pretty late so Cas must’ve sent her home. He wasn’t even sure if that’s what Cas wanted and he could possibly imposing on him. With that whole ex business happening today he probably wasn’t ready for another relationship. And if it’s as messy as Charlie said then was Dean sure he wanted to jump right into that?
After getting dressed in a thin sweater and some worn out jeans, he took a deep breathe before heading out towards the lobby of the Inn. Missouri had instructed that he wear regular clothes because he’d ‘looked like he was gonna take over the world’ in his interview clothes. He was thankful for the relaxed dress clothes, gave him much less to fuss about every day.
“You will change your tone and speak to me with respect.” His voice boomed. “I didn’t raise you to talk to me like that.”
It was raining the day he left. Not a violent rain like this one, just as if the sky was crying. It was cold that night he packed what little belongings he had and fled for the first time. This particular night it was warm and humid, the heat stuck to him just as his damp clothes did. The rain itself was like ice, a complete contrast for the heat of an early summer evening. Thunder like war drums sounded overhead, consistent lightening went off like a flickering light bulb. Today was a miserable day for travel. He’d much rather be in a warm bed with a book in his hand and a warm cup of tea sitting nearby. The choice was no longer his though. The last words of his mother rung in his head as it always did when it was time to leave.
Hot tears welled up in his eyes. He blinked rapidly trying to hold them back. Dick didn’t deserve any more tears from him. His mind flashed back to that terrible night. The forcefulness around him, the helplessness inside him.
“For two?” he questioned. “I think it’s only fair if you take yours off too. Can’t leave me high and dry.”
“You did so good for me Cas.” He said as he lifted on his knees, positioning Cas’ dick and sank down on top of him.
Cas’ eyebrows knitted together in the center of his forehead at this. He sat up fully keeping his dissecting gaze on Dean. Dean mouthed that he was talking to Sam and Cas smiled slightly.
Dean got dressed with a quickness so by the time Cas came over he was already ready. The younger man knocked on the door and when he opened it he was met with a pair of wide, bright eyes. A warmness fell over him at the sight. Cas looked happy which in turn made Dean happy as well. He placed a kiss on those plump smiling lips as he ushered him into the apartment.
“I—um—“ Castiel was burning with embarrassment now, post-orgasmic glow ruined as he was now mortified by his words.
A random patron stumbled behind Cas pushing him into Dean’s side. He practically fell on him. Dean reached out sitting his hand on his back to keep him steady. The thought crossed his mind to remove it once the man was good, but he fought against it, holding Cas close to him now.
“Alright, then maybe we can tone it down and when you’re ready we can take this party somewhere else.” Dean smiled as he retracted his leg.
He spun around too quickly to see the one person he’d hoped he’d never see again. He looked the man in front of him up and down. Anger began to swell within him and threatened to burst out.  He knew the day stared off too well to be true, but couldn’t help being slightly optimistic seeing how the rest of his week had gone just as well.
“How do you like working for Missouri?” John asked, immediately eyeing Dean for approval of the subject change.
He walked away and it felt like time started to flow again. Castiel could barely breathe and he just said hello and shook the man’s hand. How the hell was he supposed to film the scene?! He turned to find Gabriel smirking with his hands on his hips.
Most of the students immediately left the room, giving Dean thanks and wishing him a happy thanksgiving. One student did drag along a bit, Castiel knew him as Kevin. He’d never talked to the individual except for the few times they were paired up in his Biology class. He was nice enough, a little strange but Castiel didn’t dislike him.
Dean wasn’t ready to admit it was a good plan. He didn’t want to give his Dad the satisfaction of hearing Dean say he did a good job. You don’t reward a bad person, or at least that’s how he looked at it.
Tentatively he put his plush lips to the bottle and took a generous sip. Dean chuckled watching the other boy shiver and pucker his lips like he was tasting a lemon for the first time.
“He’s my boyfriend, long story and I’m not going to explain it. Can you contact him and tell him you have me? Also tell him Dick has two people armed with him, and who knows who else he has lurking around the school.”
He began retelling what happened the night before. The plan when he walked in was to start up a nice long conversation, introduce the guy to Jo and Ellen, but he’d frozen up. The face and the voice bested him, and he fled as fast as he possibly could.
The night air hit him as soon as he stepped outside. It was much chillier than it should have been considering how hot it was throughout the day. He ran back in to grab his corduroy jacket to battle against it. Before the end of the workday, Missouri had approached him asking if he could come by her house for a talk after closing. At first, he didn’t think anything of it, but as he was getting ready he realized he was being invited to his boss’ house. She is good friends with Mary and part of the Winchester clan, but it still felt odd going there. It was another quirk that made this town so different from the others. It was a bit of a walk away, and though she did offer him a ride, he’d declined. The night was nice enough, the sky so clear you could actually see the moon and stars. This was the kind of night he’d missed when he lived in large cities. All the air pollution and general chaos of the night life starting up made nights like these impossible. There was something so pure about a cloudless sky. He took comfort in the mostly quiet surroundings. Outside of the Roadhouse and that awful club the next town over there wasn’t much in the way of pubs and clubs.
Shortly following Ellen made the announcement of dinner being served. As they walked over to the table Sam quickly came to Dean’s opposite side and clapped a hand on his shoulder. Cas shrugged off the gesture until he noticed the caged animal look on Dean’s face once again. He followed his trail of vision to find none other than his father coming in through the back door. He had a smile on his face and sat at the end of the table. Sam and Cas ushered Dean over to the side opposing him. Sam sat to his father’s left, Castiel sat in the middle of Sam and Dean keeping Dean boxed between him and Bobby who sat at the other head of the table. Dean was as far away from his father as he possibly could be while still sitting at the table. The silence was palpable, hanging in the air like an invisible fog. If Castiel wasn’t in such a protective mode right now, he’d probably choke on that silence.
That was something to think about. Gabriel’s muddy intentions aside he really did enjoy shooting Dean. The man was made to be beyond the lens. With the right lighting he was a masterpiece to beheld. The sight of all sights when he was in action. He definitely wanted that to happen again and soon, but he had to let his brother stew for a little bit.
“I think we should be studying as we intended to do.” The words came out much more aggressive than they were supposed to be, but it was effective as everyone shut up and put their heads in their books.
The shoot itself wasn’t until the following week, so Gabriel told him he had time to decide. He’d actually said ‘discuss it with your boy’, but he’s already decided he wasn’t doing that. if all else fails he could say no and Bal could step in. if not…
“Saturday. I don’t want to get too heavy. It may scare him off.” Castiel stared down at his drink and half eaten croissant. There were a lot of things he should discuss with Dean, but he knew in his heart of hearts that he just couldn’t. Things between the two barely started and he was already staring off at the cliffs ahead.
Dean merely winked at Cas as he hollowed out his cheeks putting so much pressure on his shaft and he watched in awe as Cas’ orgasm came crashing through him. He screamed Dean’s name and some other obscenities as his body trembled. It was profound how Dean had reduced such a strong and straightforward individual into a shivering mess. His checks were flushed and his head tossed back half buried in the pillows. Dean pulled off and slid up Cas’ body to watch the beautiful state he was in.
He walks off back to his room thinking about what Mary offered him. It’s terrifying to think about it, but his gut is telling him Missouri will want to talk about it Monday and he’ll have no choice but to give her an answer. On one hand having his own space would be amazing. He’s missed cooking and having more than a bed and a bathroom. Mary was right, he’d love to entertain the people in his life, not just Dean but the whole Winchester clan. To return the lovely dinner they gave to him.
“That’s awesome Cas. Go on and get inside you irresistible thing.” He chuckled, playfully pushing Castiel’s shoulder.
When they finished the both of them were hungry and exhausted so Dean ended up ordering two pizzas, and left to get a pack of beer. Castiel himself wasn’t much of an alcohol drinker, but celebrations were in order.
He wasn’t sure if he was permitted to make his own suggestions. That wasn’t specified in the rules Dean had given him, but he didn’t think it was much of a deviation from them. He couldn’t touch, but nowhere was it established that he couldn’t join in the dialogue.
While he was happy that the man asked his permission before really starting something it was a little regrettable that the direction their conversation was going was cut short. The man got up to get another coffee and their talk went to ‘getting to know you’ stuff. Dean didn’t have many people in the way of blood relatives left, just his brother, but he did have many adopted family and they were just as important to him. Castiel talked about his own relatives, the other man was already familiar with Gabriel and Balthazar, but he talked about his sister Anna who was a famous artist overseas. They told silly stories of their younger years involving their siblings. Gabriel was a nightmare to deal with and Bal wasn’t much better. They were tough in different ways, one with his constant pranking and both with their wild partying. Instead of taking Anna who’d actually want to attend these things they always sought him out and forced him into the most uncomfortable situations possible.
“So you the Cas I’ve heard so much about?” a surly man with grizzled features and a ball cap approaches him with a beer to offer and a handshake. “I’m Bobby, Dean’s uncle and his dumbass father’s brother. Nothing like him I can assure you.”
All Sam got in response was a half harrumph and nothing else. Before Castiel could react Bobby announced for everyone to dig in and hands went flying. He’d never seen people dart that quickly towards food. He was lucky he didn’t reach for anything or he’s sure he would draw back a nub. Dean noticed the sight and grabbed Castiel’s plate and began spooning different things onto it. Some of them he wanted and some were mere suggestions because Dean thought he should try them. His plate was handed back to him moderately full.
“Yeah he’s coming. I think that day did the complete opposite of that.” He laughed. “I think he wanted to punch Dad more than I did. You saw the way I had to drag him out of here.”
All of his excitement was brought to a halt as he was greeted by Meg’s dry voice from the counter. Turns out the inn wasn’t her only job then. She sat there with a magazine and at first didn’t look up at him, her eyes scanning whatever she was reading and smacking the ever present gum in her mouth.
Dick tried to shove back, he was brave for that in Kevin’s mind. If he saw Dean in the street and didn’t know him, with that look on his face, he’d run the other way. Despite him though Dean kept his hold on Dick and proceeded to body slam him onto the floor. Kevin’s eyes shot to what else was now happening in the room. A few other officers had now come into the room and the goons were cuffed and being escorted out. Dean was on top of Dick and throwing blow after blow on the man’s face. He looked terrifying, like nothing else in the world was as important as turning the man into a bloodied pulp.
Castiel was getting paranoid now. Sitting in a coffee shop with Charlie was a nice way to spend a Sunday morning. Huddled over a hot cup of caffeine talking about nothing and everything with his best friend was where he wanted to be, besides hanging with Dean. But he couldn’t be with Dean right now since he kicked him out to grade finals and claimed Castiel’s mere presence was way too distracting. He had rolled his eyes at his boyfriend in half annoyance and half amused. He wasn’t trying to be distracting, but Dean was a dramatic weirdo so he just rolled with it. Now he’s sorta listening to Charlie about the issues she’s having with her girlfriend. He feels a little bad about not being completely attentive but he feels like someone is watching him. Every now and again his eyes will look elsewhere hoping to catch someone in the act, but every time he does he sees that everyone surrounding them has their attention placed elsewhere. He wished he could just chalk it up to the slight paranoia that always comes when he’s too high, but they’d barely finished a blunt between the two of them, so that’s out the door. No, someone really is watching him and it’s bothering him entirely too much.
“It certainly is.” He gave Castiel a plain in sight once over before hopping off of the stool. “See ya round Cas.” He waved and sauntered off.
“Bottom or top I’m going to still point out your ridiculous behavior.” He smirked. “Start making breakfast. I’m starving.”
Sam took Dean to Bobby’s because that was the best thing to do for his brother. He knew how much the both of them valued the little family they had left and thought it best for Dean to be surrounded by the people who love him the most. Plus with him taking half of Bobby’s weapon collection he thought he deserved to be filled in on the situation. Sam knew Dean had half a liquor store in his house and the last thing he wanted to do was leave him alone with it. Dean would not turn out like their father if he had some say in it.
He walked to the bathroom on shaky legs and wet a corner of his shower towel and brought it back to Dean. Gingerly he cleaned up his entrance and the back of his thighs before he cleaned himself off. Tossing the towel in the hamper he crawled up the bed facing Dean and wrapping him in his arms.
This chapter is a little short....partly because I really wanted to get something up and because the next chapter is pretty long. Plus I really like the title I came up with for the next chapter *corny, evil chuckle ensues*. No warnings for this one. It's pure gushy fluff. An honest Thanks to every one that's read this fic so far and a extra special thanks to all the comments and kudos. You guys truly warm my cold heart with every word. The next chapter is already written and will be posted in the next day or so. I'm just editing and fixing the timeline. Enjoy xoxo
“So you made out with Green eyes and didn’t think to tell me about it? I’m hurt Castiel.” She fake sniffled and took another sip of her coffee.
“I’m not listening to anymore of this!” and with that he stomped out of the door and was on his way.
The rest of their time together was spent with their lips locked, and arms wrapped around one another. Both of them keeping their hands above the waist, Castiel, because he was clueless, and Dean, because he didn’t want to push too far. It was quite an experience, he could feel arousal course around his veins for the first time in such a long time. He was no stranger to the feeling as a whole, but to this level, it was overwhelming. Dean must be on the same wavelength because he pulled back entirely.
In the kitchen, Castiel and Eileen were flipping burgers and laughing about a joke one of them had told.
He wandered aimlessly through the blackness of the empty. Every now and again, he'd hear a faint scream in the distance and change course to find the screamer. It led him nowhere. He was feeling guilty. He hoped Sam and Jack were holding up alright. In his desperation, he decided to yell.
"Uh-huh..." Sam said, not sure what they had gotten into...and not sure if he wanted to know. He was pretty sure he knew what 'pizza-man' was code for.
Afterwhile, the boys sat around the table, enjoying the last few pieces of pizza and polishing off the beer and pie. Once they got Castiel up to speed on what had happened after he died, he asked, "So Jack…your God?"
Dean looked at Sam with grief-worn eyes and said, "And now he's gone. Because he thought I was worth saving. Because he saw something in me, no one else could! Because something about me was worth loving! And I didn't even say anything back, Sammy! Not even a goodbye. He gave himself to The Empty for me, and I didn't even say a word. Not a damn word!"
"No, no, I do. What I said about you…about you not being family..." Dean's voice caught in his throat; he couldn't believe his past actions. They didn't even feel like him. "I can't ever apologize enough for what I put you through. I was just so angry. About my mom, about Chuck, about the world. You didn't deserve to be the punching bag for what you couldn't control."
"Dean, I was happy to die for you! You saved the world like I knew you would. You have the biggest heart of any human I know. You've given me so much. You taught to be human, how to have compassion. How to love..." Tears started to fall from Cas' eyes, "You asked me in the empty: Did I mean what I said. Of course, I meant it. I didn't know it was possible for someone like me to feel like that. I've spent eons thinking that I was practically invincible. Until I met you. You are my vulnerability, Dean. Since I've met you, you have been my Achille's heel, my blind spot. It took me so long to realize why that was. It took me years to realize that everything, every decision I made, it was for you. It took me years to realize that...I am completely and hopelessly in love with you, Dean Winchester."
Jack smiled slightly, "it's..different. Not bad, but there's a lot of work to be done." He answered. Sam and Dean nodded at him. "Did you..need me?" "Yeah, actually…we were wondering about Cas."  Dean began.
"It's settled." Dean smiled. Sam, Jack, and Cas walked into the kitchen, while Dean called the pizza parlor to make their order: One large cheese, and one large meat-lovers: his favorite. After ordering, he sauntered into the kitchen to see his little family already sipping on beers.
"Hey, no talking crap about the Winchester-surprise, and no, it's burger night," Dean said, laying an arm around Jack's shoulder, both smiling.
"Actually, I was hoping you could tell me about…Cas? We never really had a chance to talk about what happened in all the chaos with Chuck...and I'd like to know how he...went out." Sam said, a tinge of sorrow in his voice; he had lost a friend too, a brother. Dean's face tightened. Of all things to ask, Sam wanted to know about what was torturing him the most?
"Keep on fighting, Jack. I'll is home with Cas soon." Dean said, passing Jack, nearing the portal. Jack nodded but said nothing as to keep all his attention on the empty. Dean walked to the portal and looked back at the boys.
"I've decided. We've gotta go get him. We can't just leave him in the empty, Sammy. It's not right for him to sacrifice himself for me. I can't just…let him die."
Dean gently rapped his knuckles on the door and shoved his hands in his pockets. His breath caught as a grinning Castiel opened the door.
After a silent moment Dean raised his hands to take his helmet off and when he found his eyes, Castiel was taken aback by how soft they were, how they glowed dimly in the street light.
Getting closer and closer to almost 70 miles per hour, his engine revved protests as he made some very tight curves. Around and around the school they went.
Dean stopped short a couple feet away from Castiel and blinked a couple times, he looked around him for maybe a book or sign or anything but he just saw endless ceiling high bookshelves. The silence of the library felt lighter there as Castiel watched him with narrowed eyes.
At the last second, Dean looked into Castiel's eyes. He tried to convey all of his emotions in that simple, one second gaze.
His ears perked at the sound of a motorcycle - loud and annoying and clear - and he felt his whole body flood with warmth, but he couldn't get ahead of himself.
"See you at check out." Castiel smiled wide at him and pivoted to walk away, leaving Dean alone to try to collect himself between the bookshelves of the library.
His hand lightly worm it's way into the bottom of Castiel's hair and he started playing with it as the kiss continued when Castiel moaned softly into Dean's mouth, pulling harder on his jacket, and his entire body vibrated along with it.
Dean clenches his fists on top of his thighs. He’s prepared for the puff of warm breath that escapes Castiel’s nose, skirting across his exposed neck. He’s
When Dean was just about to give up on his stupid plan, Castiel came out from the back and walked towards him, stopping right on the other side of the counter. Dean's breath caught when he smiled wide and said, "Hello. How can I help you?"
Castiel was unsure what to do. He knew he should probably let go of Dean and thank him and walk home and never interact with him again. But Castiel didn't have a single bone in his body that wanted to do that.
Dean would be lying if he didn't say he was a rollercoaster of emotions right now. He was both relieved it was Castiel and that he was still alive and suspicious of the circumstances. Also his heart thudded faster as he processed the extreme proximity of the other male. He also couldn't say he wasn't slightly flustered. Dean concluded Castiel was very close.
Sam shrugged and waved his hand in the air, "Ah, I think he said he was just going, out somewhere. Don't know about hunting. Who knows what Cas gets up to when he does this kinda stuff?" He chuckled dryly, dimples showing, and brushed his hair back.
Dean tensed but seemed to understand, and he steered back to a more secluded street not far away from Castiel's own, but somewhere they couldn't be seen. Castiel wasn't comfortable with the thought of his family catching him with a boy after he snuck out, he preferred to be as discreet as possible.
He looked at the back seat, where two packs of his favorite beer, Sam's salad and a whole apple pie lay. Dean knew it wasn't good for the food, but it was better to get it before than come home empty handed after; and have to explain to Sam why he spent hours out with no proof of a reasonable explanation for it. Dean's memory wasn't the best after meetings with Castiel.
Castiel kissed Dean's forehead, inhaling his intoxicating smell before raising his arm from around his lover and pulling away.
Dean was almost breathless. Here was the most beautiful, intelligent, kind and amazing man he had ever met and they were pressed against each other and he was declaring that he felt something for Dean too? Something so strong, it brought them here to this box, cramped together and having chick-flick moments?
Red and tear streaked. All Dean could see now was how lost and horrible Sam felt about all of this. How utterly tired he was of losing his brother over and over again.
“Dean,” Castiel murmurs, so quiet and hushed, Dean has to convince himself he said something. “I’m going to bite you now.”
As she raised it over her head, Chuck sneered as the motorcycles revved, "Anna baby, wanna get outta here after I win? I'll let you drive my sweet ride..."
Castiel cleared his throat, he didn't expect to be received like this. He was expecting a little more love and gratefulness if he was honest. In any way, Castiel was extremely happy to even be with Dean at this moment.
Their eyes met for the first time that day, mossy green and sky blue colliding in the intensity of unspoken feelings.
Dean left home at 4:15 with a plan. He would arrive at the library and Castiel would be there. Then he would ask for Castiel and when the rest of the workers found him he would say that he lost his library card and he wants to get a new one. He knows the standard procedure for a lost card because when his little brother, Sam, was actually little and not as tall as a moose, Dean would do whatever he could to take him to get some books in the library. Dean understood that someone with his bother's brains should be constantly challenged and never bored so he did what he had to do to keep Sam occupied even after he finished his schoolwork at home.
Dean is almost vibrating with the effort of holding himself still. His hands have left his tight fists to clutch at his jeans. He has his eyes closed, so he feels one of Castiel’s hands move up to so very gently squeeze itself under his armpit and come out the other side to hold his shoulder. He tightens his grip on Dean, and pulls them close, chests touching. Their knees bump together, so Dean acts reflexively, opening his legs, but when Castiel slots a knee in between them, Dean regrets it
Since he had dedicated this race to him, it was only fair he took Dean's side. Castiel just hoped he would be safe.
Dean audibly gulped, "No!! Thanks." He almost ran to the door, then stopped and turned around quickly, "I'll see you around?"
Dean literally took matters into his own hands as he started touching Castiel, who grunted at the stimulation and rutted against Dean.
Dean's mind had wondered off about Castiel's smirking mouth and he blurted, "I need a, uh, book," cringing, he nodded awkwardly.
Castiel frowned as he looked at it and suddenly his face lit up, "I have an idea. Follow me." He started to the left and turned into more shelves of books, going deeper into the library.
He pivoted to the king sized bed and sat down, cringing when the mattress slightly creaked under him. Castiel followed, and sat only inches away next to him. He started talking.
Dean knew how tired Sam was. He knew how angry and unforgiving he would be once they did this. How alone he would be. But the pounding in his head?
Just as he was cleaning the flask to start, Dean briskly walks in. He stops at the door and looks around the room, his eyes eventually settling on Castiel who stands there holding a wet glass flask and paper towel. Smug as ever, Dean smirks at him and walks closer.
Dean nodded, and Castiel seemed satisfied, "Yeah, he's in my 4th period AP Chem class. I actually walk right behind you two until I get there..."
Dean’s hand comes to grasp around Castiel’s wrist. He’s still doozy, so he kisses the inside of his wrist, over his tendon, without thinking much about it.
"SAMMY! I'M HOOOOME!" Dean shouted from the door as he slammed it open, creating an echo in the bunker. Sam shook his head and sighed to himself.
. Barely inches away from his face. He already looks better, blue eyes brighter, eye bags softer, cheeks pink and full again. The effect is immediate, and Dean feels relieved.
Sam nodded, his hair falling a little in his face, "Yeah they're all on a, uh, camping trip. Decided to take a break from hunting for a couple weeks. Can't blame them." He groaned a little as he stood up and put his hands on his hips.
As the crowd gathered excitedly, a skinny redhead with shorts too short for the early spring weather walked to stand in front of Dean and Chuck and their bikes. She held a bright red scarf.
