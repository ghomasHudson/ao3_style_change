The following two weeks continued like that, the pair coming together a little more every night. It was quiet and calm, Sherlock would get a little stroppy over a case now and then because ‘forensics can’t take photographs to save their lives, John’ or something similar.
“Hm? What?” he asked calmly, though John saw his eyes dart around for a moment before focusing on John again.
The next set of dragons dove into the pool and the workers and nestlings, armed with their sponges and brushes, began working on them. From a distance he could see the smaller dragons rolling around in the shallower waters and generally having about as much fun as their larger peers. A couple didn’t seem to be having as much fun, opting to sit just near enough to the water that their carers could dump water on them with buckets.
“You’re fine, honestly they all just want to meet you and talk a bit, every rider and keeper in the Aerie passes under our noses.”
“It was used to murder Carl Powers 24 years ago,” Sherlock said bluntly, typing on his phone finishing the entry ‘traces of Shy Death poison present.’ But he didn’t post it. “John, call Lestrade tell him to have the phone nearby,” Sherlock ordered.
“I was looking for my clothes, by the way, Mycroft I need a locker. You have enough sway to keep me imprisoned here, the least you can do is reliably provide me with clothing,” Sherlock grumped.
“Pluto,” Sherlock rumbled, lowering his voice and watching John shiver a bit. He had started stroking himself a little, just a tease really to get back to full hardness again, and he let go a breathy groan as he circled under the glans with his thumb and forefinger.
John didn’t reply, still gritting his teeth against the nails on his scalp. She rolled her eyes, “Fine, I am Jim, and you are?” Jim extended a black-tipped hand in a beckoning gesture. Her eyes took on an even darker murderous glint when John still didn’t talk to her and the hand in his hair wrenched back even further.
“Don’t think we’re done talking about this though,” John said as Sherlock re-settled with his head resting on John’s shoulder.
“What would the ceremony have been?” he asked, wondering if other riders would be looking down on him for being without it.
“What do you want?” he asked diving right to the heart of the matter. Both John and Lestrade looked to each other, silently confirming that yes indeed they were dealing with some manner of hostage situation.
“Blanket, please,” Sherlock said out loud leaving no room for questions. The paramedic pulled an orangey red shock blanket from a compartment and kindly laid it over the pair of them. John immediately felt better, the soft fabric thick enough to block the light but not completely, leaving him cradled in Sherlock’s embrace under the soft orange glow of their covering.
“Dr Watson, this is your rider speaking. Sig is a good girl and we’ll try to make your take off as smooth as possible. I’ve heard about your problem and would suggest you just sit with your dragon and try to remain calm, take deep breaths, and relax for a nice flight home to London.” The soothing voice came over the radio perfectly clear, and John followed the instructions, taking the receiver with him when he found out the cord would stretch that far. John leaned back against Hyperion’s neck, the bloom of the bond acting as a balm on his already frayed nerves.
“Sally, Sally! I need to make a phone call, can I borrow your mobile?” he asked quickly, “I have a sister, she’d probably like to know what’s happened to me.” Sally pulled out her phone and tossed it to him.
“Told you I’d be back, didn’t I?” John said, looking up at him with a small smile. The adrenaline from earlier was definitely gone and in its place John felt tired and more than a bit sore; his shoulder felt like it had been wrapped in a tangle of thorns, overworked in one seemingly long day. Hyperion leaned down and pressed John gently into the mat with a warm nuzzle, shifting his forearm so that John lay back. A hint of curiosity darted across as Hyperion inhaled, sniffing John in a massive breath, backing off and flicking over him lightly with his tongue.
Claxons were going off in John’s head by now, red warning flags were a thing of the past and John’s level of panic had risen to the point that he was beginning to feel a bit light headed. Bellamy could take off at any second, he didn’t know when, but she could at any moment make the leap. John’s hands clenched into white knuckle fists on his trouser legs, any attempt at looking calm on the outside felt like it was slipping away from him as his head swam a little in the new wave of horror and anticipation. A part of him wanted her to just get it over with already, jump and be done with it, the warring opposite of that was that he just wanted off entirely, abort the whole plan and let him down, try again some other time.
“I’d be lying if I said no,” Sherlock replied, John could feel his voice in his chest where they were pressed together.
John took a couple steps back towards the door he’d come from, the black eye behind the man following him.
He sat up a bit more, out of the blanket cocoon he had rolled himself into against Hyperion’s forearm, and turned to peek over the broad sandy scales. He squinted in the dim morning light only to see a dark figure pulling some sort of a drum on wheels behind them. John quietly slid off Hyperion’s mat, wrapping the orange blanket he still had yet to return to Sherlock around himself, and approached the man who had stopped near the sofa against the wall.
“Molly? Does she know about the other rider?” John asked, brain hopping to the awful Army cliche of cheating husbands and wives.
The sun being completely set by no means stopped the Aerie in its tracks. While the dragons’ hallways were kept fairly dark for the sake of the residents whose pits were attached to them, the rest of the complex was lit similarly to regular streets. Wall-mounted lights made to look like lanterns cast the halls in yellowy white. John passed a few workers still out and about who carried torches dutifully aimed at the ground. While the halls were like streets the smaller corridors seemed more like alleyways, more dim and shadowed, and in the moments when John was alone and all was quiet a small shiver ran up his spine and made him walk a little faster.
“They were fish men, Sherlock! Like us with gills and all, only they looked a little more like fish than we do, with markings,” John repeated as Sherlock tilted his head back against the wall. He had his hand against his face massaging into his eyelids.
John had charged up the stairs ahead of them and was in the kitchen, stripping himself of his clothes now that he was in the confines of his own home and deforming into his natural state, not caring if Lestrade saw. He set about angrily making tea, tendrils and limbs extending off of his primary mass to slam down a full kettle to boil while reaching for the tea bags and mugs.
“We are obstructing traffic,” Sherlock groused. Bellamy was shuffling restlessly too, John noticed, looking towards the hallway that would lead home. He was beginning to suspect something might be going on that he’d missed, John just didn’t know what it would have been that even the normally calm Bellamy might get flustered over.
“Hmm, two months his senior, but yes.” Sherlock drawled looking at her. She looked like she was beginning to fade, like a child who stayed up past their bedtime and struggled to make it just a few more minutes. She so obviously wanted to stay alert and watch over Sherlock, but she seemed to be falling asleep, her head lolling to the side, eyes half-lidded only to pop open wider for a moment and slowly fall back towards closed.
“He might be upstairs in the labs, might want to check there.” She pointed back the way John came. Molly directed him across the hall to the elevator and stairs up to the first floor, where the various labs were set up. The small dragon hospital’s layout being fairly straightforward, with a singular long hall down the length of the building, made it fairly easy to look around. The ground floor consisted of a series of offices in the front followed by exam rooms and further down the hall the building opened up into little padded stalls closer in size to ones seen in a normal barn.
The last thing he remembered before dozing off was Sherlock reaching out across him to tug at the lamp cord and draw them even further into darkness. He resettled and wrapped an arm around John’s waist again, kissing into his hair one more time, and John finally slept.
“Oh don’t mind him dear, he’ll warm up to you again soon enough,” Mrs Hudson said, glancing down at Angus. Angus appeared to be conflicted on whether he should like the petting or not, before deciding not, huffed, and stalked back down the stairs. Mrs Hudson chuckled when he didn’t go all the way down, sitting and peering around the banister up at her. John was sure if he could hear Angus’ thoughts the small dragon would be saying ‘I’ve got my eye on you.’ As it was the squinted eyes and flattened frills were a hand gesture away from conveying the thought.
As John relaxed with a satisfied, happy sigh he realized that Sherlock was still at it, still grinding into his thigh, still panting. The hand on John’s cock had halted but kept a hold of the softening organ as Sherlock continued to thrust, a thin whine escaping his lips. His other arm’s grip shifted and John found his face shoved into the crook of Sherlock’s shoulder and neck. John smiled, brain fuzzy with the lingering effects of orgasm, leave it to Sherlock to need a bit of a hand and not ask for it.
After some consideration, John decided that getting in the car was better than trying to walk in the open hallways; he could put up a fight if they tried anything funny.
“Even if it was her, what would there be for me to do about it when I am stuck as a tuna under glass? If it is her, what would be the point of her coming to observe me? To gloat over her victory? ‘ha ha, I have captured the famous Sherlock Holmes. Now I can watch his fishy arse any day that I want and know that he can do nothing about it.’ I doubt it.” Sherlock cackled, making John snicker at his suddenly witchy voice.
“Not as such, no. Though he has stated that he thinks I am ‘lonely’ and ‘need someone to feed me up a little’, oddly loyal but fairly harmless man though, Angelo,” Sherlock replied, popping open the book of matches and lighting the votive. He began popping open the food that shared the bag with the grappa, and placed the votive in the plastic top half of his salad bowl to catch wax. He set the candle down between them near the wall, the jellyfish above catching a little of the warm orange light.
“No, not at all,” John admitted, looking back towards the carrier pair. The one currently loading up had the two smaller dragon crates, along with some of the small miscellaneous goods. The doors had been shut on the crates and they were being loaded onto the belly of the beast standing over it all. All of the items, now secured and attached to the flight harness covering most of the dragon’s body, were additionally fixed in place by a large net wrapped beneath them. A man in a uniform similar to the others in the carrier’s crew walked towards John as they watched.
“If you’re going to say inane things like that you may as well take to Twitter,” he said, eyes remaining focused on the task at hand, a sudoku cube that had appeared from amongst the detritus collected on the sitting room table.
“I’m the new rider, er, field bond. John Watson,” John said, realizing they hadn’t really been properly introduced and extending a hand to shake on instinct.
“Sherlock, what the hell are you doing here?” John asked, hearing Hyperion snort awake behind him accompanied by a sudden burst of curiosity along the bond.
“And you’ve somehow managed to attract the attention of a person who supplies murderers with their weapons through it.” John felt he should have been more stunned about how much Sherlock didn’t seem to care about that, but after seeing the rider’s oddly flippant attitude concerning other matters of serious nature, he really wasn’t. “Anything else, a name? A calling card? Should I be expecting a ticking package in the post with your name on it?”
Bellamy banked slowly and turned, the ease of which still made John’s heart try to climb into his throat. But there just off the end of her wing was Hyperion, a big tan shape on the grass. John’s eyes locked onto him and Bellamy soared in his direction. She spiraled over Hyperion sweeping in a long never ending turn overhead and John saw it. Hyperion’s wings were open.
“Practice with what?” John nearly stopped in the hallway at that, his mind could easily conjure up what Sherlock meant by that and it didn’t like the thought.
“One more time,” John ordered, straightening up with a length of black rope in one hand and a blindfold in the other.
The moment Sherlock sat down in the back seat he ordered the driver to crank the heat as high as it would go and they were off, heading back towards the Aerie. The car ride was silent. Sherlock kept a large hand resting on the hatchling’s body the entire way, long fingers idly stroking along the ridge of a wing or along its spine now and then. In the quiet John had time to contact Hyperion who was on constant alert on the other end of the bond, John could almost feel him twitching, wanting to get up and go to him but unable to. John continued to stroke along the small head as he communicated with Hyperion
“This is flat 221, arrogant sod tacked the ‘b’ onto the door,” she grumped, stepping up to the unmarked door to the right of 221b and knocking. A strange crowing sort of noise came from the other side, as if someone was strangling a raven. The door opened and out stepped an older woman, shooing away whatever was making the racket beyond. “Mrs Hudson, Dr Watson is here to take his room, John, this is Mrs Hudson, your landlady.”
John hobbled over to the mattress looking up at Hyperion, who had laid himself out on his side. He stretched his free wing outwards, covering John momentarily in a massive semi-translucent tan tent. John felt a massive wave of contentment wash over him; pure bliss and happiness poured across the bond, completely overriding any pain from the walking. The feeling was so strong John could almost feel it travel from the tips of his hair to the soles of his feet like a nice long full body stretch, and it left him feeling as though he was glowing with the joy that suffused him, a warm smile spreading across his face. Hyperion let loose a large sigh, snapping the wing back in, his head loling on the tile as he let all his muscles go lax.
“You should see Bellamy after she’s shed,” said a lovely baritone behind him. John turned to see Sherlock standing above him, long toes gripping the scales of Hyperion’s back effortlessly. John nearly dropped the scale in his hands when he registered where his kneeling position put him, at eye level with Sherlock’s tautly clad groin. John quickly looked away, casting his gaze anywhere but those long thighs. His eyes settled on Bellamy in the distance who had also come to rest, simply floating with a handful of nestlings giving her a scrubbing, though she seemed to need it much less than Hyperion did with his whole team of people surrounding him. Sherlock bent over John and picked the shed scale out of his hands, resting long fingers on his shoulder as he did so. John held his breath in the moment of that touch; he just barely felt Sherlock’s thumb rub over the exit point of his scar before the rider straightened with Hyperion’s scale in hand, examining it.
“I told you to find the phone. You’re the one who decided to run off and get Bellamy, you could have told Lestrade and sent him or Sally just as easily,” he interrupted calmly.
John walked towards the door trying not to look back; if he did he’d never want to leave again. His escort stood near the door waiting for him. Omar was just outside, waiting to accompany them back to the courtyard. John felt worse and worse about leaving the farther he got from the enclosure. The bond felt stronger this time, he could still feel Hyperion, but the dragon was radiating unhappiness and that only made John feel awful. He dragged his feet, following his escorts at a slight distance, feeling more of a pull to go back.
“Sorry,” John mumbled, unclasping one of his fists from his leg, his knuckles aching from being gripped so intensely, and bringing it to cover his face.
John felt relieved that he wasn't the only person ever to see Sherlock being kind; that Sherlock seemed to have a soft spot for the Aerie’s nestlings put a smile on John’s face. Mary’s happy list of treats made John feel hungry, and he noticed the sun beginning to set.
“A dinner date?” John said, quiet as Sherlock, a bit of humor in his voice. Sherlock brought his hands to his face and let out a huff. John decided to take that moment to edge a little closer to Sherlock, shuffling across the blanket and moving the dim lantern out of the way. He came to rest next to him.
“Bell tells me I must apologize,” John heard Sherlock say nearby. “I did not know…” Sherlock almost sounded like a child being made to say sorry by his mother. Bellamy let out a huffy snort above John and carefully let him go, pushing John away and back towards Sherlock with her knuckles, out of her cool shadow. The limp from Hyperion had returned with a vengeance and without his cane, John hobbled forward.
John nodded, giving her a ‘yes please,’ and she left. It was not long before a somewhat familiar face came striding down the hall.
“You’re the one being obtuse now,” John said with a grin in his voice, “act all you want, you know that I know you can feel and express more than one emotion at a time.”
“Doesn’t mean I want the gossip chain to maybe overhear and start the whole he said, she said, did you hear what they said mess?” John replied.
The man grunted and went to stand where she pointed. Jim extended a hand towards Sebbie. “The book, dear,” she said pleasantly, looking up at the taller woman. ‘Sebbie’ popped open the buttons of her long coat and pulled a worn-looking book from inside. From what John could see of it, it didn’t just look worn, it looked old: like some ancient being had crafted the thing from dried leather, bits of sinew, and paper. It looked like it had been dunked in water at least a few times, wrinkled and warped as it was. The thing gave off an unhealthy sounding creak as Moriarty cracked it open in front of her and turned to the man at the water’s edge. The book began to emit an eerie blue glow the moment Jim opened it and it only got brighter the longer the pages stayed parted.
“I said I wanted to have you, you could be shaped like a big red sodding park bench and I’d still want you.” Sherlock wrapped around him and squeezed John back down against himself. “I love you, my John.”
“Sure have, my wife’s a rider. She’s on an assignment to the little Aerie up at Liverpool right now, but yeah, she’s taken me flying with her before.” John felt a shiver run up his spine at the thought of being even less protected during flight, without the box around him. He shrugged out from under Tom’s arm.
John began to write, like his therapist had suggested. It took him some time to figure out how one actually blogs things. In John’s mind an online blog would make it easier for Harry to contact him if she ever wanted to again, as well as his friends should they ever look him up. A post speaking to absolutely no one went up a short time later, John’s index fingers pecking out a first short message.
“You don’t have to stay if you don’t wanna.” John made a lazy attempt to roll over and face Sherlock, but the man had him in his grip and didn’t let him go.
He thought if he rammed himself into something maybe that’d wake him up, like a bomb exploding or a long fall jolted him out before. He tried flicking the tail faster, swimming at a glass panel in the opposite wall, but was intercepted by the dark colored tuna bumping into him. He floated there in the water becoming increasingly aware of his new body, of gills filtering water and the tail flexing, pushing him along.
John had fallen asleep, however, so no more eyesight to share; Hyperion was likely dozing as well. The click of the door and the sound of Sherlock’s feet on the rug as he turned to hang up his coat had woken John who snorted awake with all the subtlety of a chainsaw, causing Sherlock to pause, staring at him. They’d shared a look for a moment, John blinking up at Sherlock from the sofa.
“She’s not German, she was trying to write the name Rachel. I’m going to need you to find out who that is, friends, family.” Sherlock said springing up. “She’s an Aerie worker, not from London though, she traveled here within the last few hours overnight. There’s a piece of a train ticket in her pocket, but not enough to tell where she’s from; judging by the damp under her collar and the dry umbrella in her other pocket she came through rain on the way here, which, going by the weather forecasts, means she’s from Cardiff. Cardiff is the only place that has gotten significant heavy rain with high winds meaning she was unable to use her umbrella and turned her coat collar up to the wind.”
It was a bloodbath; the men who had been on watch had died at their posts, and he saw more of the dead beyond. John heard retaliating gunfire signaling that there were at least a few still alive. He didn’t have much time to think on that though as one enemy soldier rounded the corner, saw John, and shouted an alarm. John ducked behind the doorway where he’d been standing just in time to avoid a spray of bullets. He saw Hyperion stumbling towards him and then, like a tank, the dragon rammed into the crumbling wall. Men screamed as bricks and rubble from the dilapidated building rained down on them. He heard another explosion nearby, the higher-pitched screams of a drake as well as human shouting. He watched as Hyperion scraped his side against the building, using it as a brace as he regained shaky footing. This was no place for a grounded dragon. He would be killed. John couldn’t leave his men, no matter how few survived, he needed to help them.
John approached the counter and saw the same man there from the day before when he’d eaten with Mrs Hudson. “Hello, Mr Angelo.”
“What are these for?” John asked lifting the blankets in his arms. He realized Sherlock was setting up blankets to sleep on the mat next to Bellamy.
Hyperion physically lifted his head, staring down at John who ended up in the water again at the dragon’s sudden bodily shift. John swore that if Hyperion could pout he would be, the bond was a small mess of nearly childlike reactions.
John felt Sherlock rotating him slightly in his grip presenting the paramedic with the bit of skin that bore the small cuts. The nice people took their time dressing the wounds properly, Sherlock holding John a little tighter as the sting of an antiseptic ricocheted around John’s mind like a shot. They applied the strips of Mollisian bandage tape to John’s skin with a modest minimum of contact, which John wished he could thank them for.
“Good lad, you go wait outside, now,” Lestrade said. Once the nestling had left Sherlock approached, but Lestrade stopped him, setting the phone down on the table in between them and switching the speaker on. The sound of sniffling drifted up from the mobile. "Okay, could you repeat what you told me? Are you allowed?” Lestrade asked carefully. There was a long pause from the phone filled with the same sniffling. John recognized that sound as someone trying not to cry, someone who wants to wipe their face but can’t, it was almost never a good thing to hear and it sent a small fearful shiver up his spine at what he was about to hear come from the speaker.
John did as he’d said and stashed the picture of them together as tuna, pressed it in a book and put it away on the shelves in the sitting room. They didn’t need the reminder sitting framed anywhere or anything like that. Sherlock started getting cases coming in again, and John went running after him on those as well.
“Sea flaps, they’re sea flap flaps, flippery flappy fish,” Sherlock laughed, putting his long fingered hands together, crossed at the palms, to make a sort of bird wings flapping motion with them.
The reaction was instantaneous. Sherlock’s whole form leapt away, slinking over the back of his chair and mashing himself up against the window, stretching up the wall to put distance between Mycroft and his appendages. The spot Mycroft had stabbed had changed color slightly, turning from Sherlock’s normal golden yellow to a dull muddy brown. Lestrade watched as Sherlock’s whole form arched away, irritated spines rising high across his body like a cat, hissing and spitting angrily without all the noise.
“What the--?” John sputtered as Bellamy’s head swung away from them. She lay down in front of them, the saddle at the base of her neck presented with a couple footholds on the band for climbing up the short distance to it.
Tom cleaned up what Hyperion missed or couldn’t reach, showing John the cabinet storing cleaning supplies. He took a bucket and washed the blood towards the drain running around the circumference the central sand pit. Then Tom mopped and rinsed the smooth stone again. Just watching made John feel tired, but there were other riders who did this all on their own!
“Fuck you, Sherlock,” John blurted, finally coming to a halt. Sherlock stopped too, a few paces ahead, almost as if they were tethered together by an invisible rope.
Until John’s stomach decided to grumble and John shot upright. “The food! Sherlock we forgot about the food for tonight,” he cried, moving to get up, but Sherlock wrapped an arm around his waist and pulled him back down.
The room went quiet for a moment and John chose that time to make his presence known. He wasn’t quite prepared for the sight in the sitting room. A slightly fat man sat on the couch with an open first aid kit by his side. There was a tall skinny man sitting on the cleared coffee table covered in smears of bright red blood. His curly dark mop of hair was plastered down with it. The fat man was cleaning a cut across a pale swath of the back of his shoulder. Stunningly blue eyes turned to him the moment he stepped around the door, locking onto John as though reading him like a book the moment he laid those icy eyes on him.
“What happened?” he asked groggily looking at John, who was hovering over him just in case Sherlock suffered any ill effects from the chloroform.
“Sherlock?” John mumbled, looking down the long hall in the direction of the flat. The phone vibrated in his hand again prompting him to look as another text popped, “If inconvenient come anyway. SH” As if from far off he was reading John’s mind. Food would have to wait a bit longer; if the urgency of the text was any indicator Sherlock could be in some sort of trouble.
“It's just not the kind of work we do,” Lestrade answered. “Mysteries and the like. Sure, we’ve had to invite them in if we find something illegal in the post--one of the dragons found some vases full of cocaine once, that wasn’t pretty. But we don’t go dropping out of the sky and landing in the streets like you do, Sherlock.” Lestrade turned the conversation back to the detective.
“John, much as I enjoy hearing my name on your lips throughout the day, would you kindly shut up at this moment?” Sherlock replied with a huff, looking up from his curious inspection of the shoe.
“What?” John remembered Lestrade saying that nobody could forget Sherlock’s first case, but the man just said nobody believes him about this one.
“Sherlock?” John called, curious and a tiny bit worried, “you alright Sherlock?” Suddenly John felt embarrassment, a ragged shame filled bubble that was certainly not his own rising like the blush on a human’s face, and briefly John thought by some insane stretch Sherlock was projecting emotion without touching him, but that was impossible. Then John noticed the tiny tendril of yellow slipped out from under the edge of the door to barely touch him.
The tuna next to Sebbie however gave a great heaving flop and flail, strong tail knocking into her, making her fall gracelessly to the floor. Poor Sherlock continued to wriggle, sleek body bowing and writhing on dry land, battering Sebbie in the process until he finally rolled into the water. There was a brief moment of silence as all three of them stared at the tuna darting away into the water, as though, of all the insanity that had happened, that was the strangest bit of the night.
“Anything else, any distinguishing marks at all? You’ve been living with my brother for months now, have you picked up any of his methods?” Mycroft asked, his tone clipped and tinged with an anxiety the man was certainly not willing to show. “No, of course not, small mind, thinking with your dick, you spent more time trying to woo him than to learn anything from him.” Mycroft sneered. Suddenly those cool eyes were similar to Sherlock’s in the way they scanned over him briefly before they turned away.
The sensuous rutting continued like that for long minutes, Sherlock resting his forehead against John’s as their breath began to warm the air between them. John saw those pale blue eyes hooded and watching, watching what was happening between them, the bulges of their clothed erections pushing against one another, the rise and fall of their stomachs and chests as they panted for breath.
“Now, you will be perfectly safe in here with your dragon, nothing extreme is going to happen, no sudden dives or flips or any nonsense like that. you’ll feel some shaking when we first take off, and when we land, but nothing to worry about,” he said calmly and slowly, helping John get seated next to Hyperion. The crewman then walked over to a panel in the wall next to the door,
“What’d they do?” John asked enthralled and genuinely curious. Sherlock was like him, he’d done something the Aerie hadn’t seen happen before, only in his case bonding with Hyperion had been seen as a good thing.
“This’d be painkillers actually. He gets three of these with his food. They should last him the rest of the day so he can get up and move if he wants to.” Tom cut a deep slash in a nearby hunk of meat, pushed the pill into the gash, and pressed the edges closed around it. He put the knife down to heft the chunk out of the cart, leaving a light bloody trail behind. John followed close by.
“Master Omar called, he told us you were a field bond and hadn’t gotten the chance to really sit and bond properly with Hyperion,” Lestrade said conversationally as they watched his people work.
“Shh, working,” Sherlock hissed at him, “do you have a scent? You know what she smells like?” Sherlock asked Bellamy, calmly rubbing her nose with his bare hands, “Think you can find it?” he asked again, giving her a warm smile, “go on then, don’t destroy anything,” Bellamy looked intent on every word that he said, but that last remark John saw her eyes roll and snorted a laughing huff in Sherlock’s face before rising up. She made some distance between them before she took to the air in one great bound, a quick gust of wind traveling down the street with her first wingbeats, John getting to see at a distance what he’d felt and been terrified by before as butterfly-spotted wings opened and caught the midday air and sunlight.
“Yeah, usually the small amounts they can’t taste it, but when we have to up the dosage they tend to do that afterwards,” Tom said, coming up beside John. “But you see, he wouldn’t hurt you ever during a feeding.” He scraped one of his grimy hands down the side of John’s face, trying to help rub off some of the crud from the meat. Unfortunately it was sort of matted into that side of his hair already, along with the sweat of being active for the first time in a while.
John took pity on him eventually, moving over to Sherlock’s side and keeping him oriented properly. The loud noises of children banging on the windows, which had at one point scared John, now seemed to startle Sherlock; he would dart when they happened, only to slow when he figured out what it was.
John felt a little bad for his maliciousness once he saw what the diver was doing. They removed the scarf which was still around Sherlock’s head, then left, scarf in hand, and John went back to Sherlock’s side.
“Yes sir, I was a field medic Captain with the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers,” John replied, spine straightening at Sholto’s tone.
They had been sitting on the sofa one night with Sherlock’s head in John’s lap when John had spoken up.
“I would trust you to do the same for me,” Sherlock replied, hugging tight to John again. The pair’s minds went quiet again, this time both remaining present, no wandering off to past memories. They sat quiet and content bathing in each other’s affection and warm touch, eventually dozing as the sun sank and the yellowy light of sunset colored their bedroom.
“Where is he?” John called back eye’s still staring at the ground below, he couldn’t look away now, he felt like if he did he’d be sick, because the ground rushing by made his head spin.
A bear of a man greeted them with a smile. “Hello! Welcome to Kandahar Aerie. I am Master Omar. What brings you boys down to the airfield today?” He asked, towering over John by well over a foot.
“Call him down,” John said quietly, pressing his cheek to Hyperion’s neck in an effort to draw warm distracting comfort from the contact.
John pushed a little nudge of affection across the bond. “Still want to go outside?” John asked quietly, hoping to distract Hyperion from the thoughts of nightmares.
A faint scraping noise reached his ears through the window at this back and John had to break the staredown to look at the dragon outside. A large black eyeball met him. Damir had gotten up and, trailing coins out of the sand behind him, had decided to crawl up and peek into his rider’s window. The massive black eye up close was frightening against the stark white skin and horns, the iris so dark that it was indiscernible from pupil, giving John a black void to stare into. John startled at the sudden close proximity, edging closer to the table so that he faced both the rider and the white dragon.
“You spent the rest of the day swimming next to me, one would think you were my shadow if you weren’t so brightly colored.” Sherlock chuckled, the deep laugh echoing nicely off the bare walls.
“A little, not usually as bad as this. This one may have been just the weak one of the clutch, who knows,” She left John to the rubdown and started checking the rest over. “This though, I know it looks bad, this is part of White-Eye anatomy. As they age they develop spines and a bit of webbing along here, and here.” She said, pointing to the raised areas starting at the back of the hatchling’s skull and the other at about mid-back down the boney looking tail.
Even with their extremely limited ability to express emotions John could only describe Sherlock as ecstatic. Once he’d finally slowed down and came back to John, Sherlock began rapidly flicking code at him drifting and then turning around almost like he was pacing next to John. John quickly lost track of what exactly Sherlock was trying to tell him though, and he jerked forward to nudge Sherlock in the side, interrupting his ‘pacing’.
They were both bound at the wrists and ankles. “You, over here,” Jim ordered to the shark man still keeping an eye on Sherlock. The brute let Sherlock drop to the floor and gave him a hard punch to the head as a parting gift, rendering Sherlock unconscious as his skull hit the concrete.
John heard Sherlock still struggling with the other man and looked to the restaurant’s employees for help. Ducked behind the counter, both of the women at the registers were staring at them with wide eyes; the cooks in the back also seemed stunned by the sudden outburst.
“I know that, doesn’t mean it isn’t nice to look at,” John replied looking over at Sherlock, who was bundled into his coat, collar turned up, and scarf tied close to his throat standing close to Bellamy’s leg. They had stopped under one of the heaters on their way home at Sherlock’s insistence. John wasn’t arguing only because he could tell Hyperion’s leg was beginning to stiffen and ache in the cold, and he was starting to feel it keenly in his own thigh again.
“You were clearly instructed by Lestrade to wait for the police,” she told him, pointing back out the doorway as though Lestrade were there to give Sherlock a reprimand as well. “I do not care what freakish deductive powers you were exercising! You should have waited to be escorted into this pit by a den mother and police!”
“Yeah,” John agreed, not really sure what had sparked the obvious observation from Sherlock, who was facing the grey night sky and the steady snowfall that was drifting from it. Sherlock breathed deep and let out a large sigh in the form of a cloud from his mouth, looking briefly like the dragons below.
“You put that back!” Sherlock bellowed, as they both reached the top of the stairs. Dimmock and Sally stood in the kitchen going through cabinets while Sherlock berated them from the sitting room.
There was one more rough shake like before, when they were over Bucharest. That one had thrown John into the side of Hyperion’s neck, leaving him in a gasping heap on the padding as he tried to get off his injured shoulder. Hyperion lifted his head briefly to help slowly nudge him back onto his right side then lay back down. It was pitch black outside; they had been flying all day, and there were a few more hours to go. John decided to dim the lights and called up to the crew to talk with one of them for a moment, before nodding off leaned back against Hyperion’s neck.
When they arrived at the flat it was just as they’d left it earlier. It held its usual warm cozy atmosphere with a thin veneer of Christmas decorations, little white strings of lights and garland over the mantelpiece, a santa hat on the skull next to a handful of christmas cards, a tiny tree on the table perched atop gifts that had appeared over the last few days, with Sherlock’s usual level of detritus surrounding it, and a few more lights around the windows and over the kitchen cabinets. All in all warm and comfy and now that they were home in the privacy of the flat with the door locked behind them John looked to Sherlock.
“Just the one,” Sherlock said, peeling open a round nicotine patch and slapping it onto a bared forearm.
Sherlock looked up at him, broken from his studying by John’s attempt at conversation. He pushed the shoe in front of John. “Tell me what you see,” he said, gesturing at the shoe with the utensil in his hand. John looked at him like he’d lost his mind, Sherlock’s was the deductive brain in the room, not his.
“Sure, oh and Sherlock, Dimmock still wants you to fill out the paperwork for him on this whole situation,” he called knowing Sherlock was there with John even though the other rider had so far been for the most part silent. John heard Sherlock give off another grumble.
“Smell something interesting?” John asked, chuckling at the hot forked tongue testing. John realized,
John noticed how she looked at Sherlock in a motherly way, looking up at him like Sherlock was a lost boy who’d finally come home with his only excuse being ‘I was off catching tadpoles and suddenly it was night time,’ but she did finally turn to John.
John thought for the fourth night in a row since he’d begun night shift. It was always in the same place: behind the scenes in the shark tank upkeep area, a long trailing puddle of water down the hall leading out into the aquarium proper. No one was scheduled to be in this late at night and yet it always appeared as though a diver had just flopped out on the floor and failed to do any sort of clean up.
He looked out at the Aerie sprawled beneath them, maybe searching for pinpricks of lights in the darkness of the walls, but could make out nothing, just more and more strings of lights and the normal glow of the lights in the halls. The dragon halls looked like stems spouting off of the central landing field, the dragons’ pits like golden leaves. John just lost himself for a moment tracing the contours of the Aerie with his eyes. Only in the moment did he distantly realize just how high up they were, but oddly it didn’t bother him. A dragon winged its way by the tower on its way into the field, the fluorescent orange markings on it glowing in the dark as it passed the brighter lights near the edges and the sight of a soaring dragon passing did nothing to shake John’s mood, still calm if a bit confused.
“Santa,” Sherlock said, also watching the dragon intently. “His name is Snö, He’s an old Leucistic Nordic and he’s been flying the last delivery flight on Christmas Eve since before I was born.” Sherlock added, as though he needed to clarify just one more time that he didn’t really think this absolute sight of a dragon was actually Saint Nick.
John chuckled. “You’re sober now, mind explaining the kissing?” John asked, grabbing a nearby towel and beginning to scrub Sherlock down as well.
“Drivel,” Sherlock snorted. “This is something Bellamy can do. She hasn’t flown in weeks now; her feedings have been backed off with her inactivity. She is restless,” Sherlock said, as though Bellamy’s restlessness were his own, tapping fingers and overall appearing to nearly be vibrating out of his skin with the urge to get up and walk around but staying put.
John slowly rose, dusting off sand as he went. He dragged the blankets with him, getting them out of the sand grains until he could have them beaten out later. John washed his face in the frigid fountain water. His shoulder felt awful, sore and swollen and stinging when he rotated that arm. His leg was not much better and he ached for his cane, wishing he hadn’t left the blasted thing at the flat. That pain came from Hyperion though, and once John’s face felt clean, he turned to look at his dragon, who was shakily standing and pushing his mat back into place, off the sand. Hyperion seemed to notice John looking and quickly sat back down, a combined thin wave of guilt and discomfort crossing the bond as though John would be upset by his activity.
“I’m sorry Hyperion, I’m okay, nothing wrong, today’s just been a little crazy.” John murmured, rubbing Hyperion’s snout and pushing calm. “You’re okay, shhh, I’m not hurt, I just had a fright earlier,” Hyperion still pushed concern heavily onto John, not moving away and even trying to bring him closer; He reached out and, like Bellamy had done earlier in the day, pulled him in close to his breast in a hugging fashion, only this time it was more for Hyperion’s comfort than John’s.
“Sure, yeah, we can do that. Just let me clean up first,” John replied, feeling a little wobbly but not nearly as much as Sherlock seemed to be. The moment Sherlock let go of his arm Sherlock just sat there on his knees swaying side to side a little bit like he was being pushed and pulled by invisible gentle waves. John figured out just how much the grappa was affecting him as he fumbled with their empty containers, trying to crunch them back into the bags they’d come in.
“Don’t think we’re not going to talk about this later,” John said, nothing but affection in his voice.
“Want me to rut on you with my big human cock?” John said, unable to keep the glee and laughter out of his voice even as the swell of a well endowed penis grew from between his legs prodding insistently at Sherlock below.
“Hyperion.” He turned and grabbed Hyperion’s snout again, seeking the comfort of bond and warm breath. John barely remembered that night; the moments around being shot were hazy; to be given them so clearly by Hyperion was a bit of a shock to say the least. Hyperion pushed John up further onto his nose and carefully lifted him just enough to move him up to rest at the base of his throat his favorite spot near the dragon’s heart. John instantly clutched at the scales with his one good hand as he felt his feet leaving the ground and sat when he was placed where Hyperion wanted him. ‘I forgive you, its alright, I understand,’ a multitude of feelings of comfort rippled across John’s mind as Hyperion turned his head away and reached for the edges of the matt. He returned with the plastic lunch box delicately gripped between his teeth. A picture of a young Victor smiling happy around a mouthful of food flickered across his mind, along with ‘eat’ and a subtle feeling of satiation and happiness. John understood: eating made Victor’s mood better so Hyperion was giving John his lunch.
He let go of the head of his own cock, letting the skin relax back and the head to peak out once more and brought his other hand down to play as well, shuffling a bit to get his pants down around his knees under the duvet. He took himself in hand again, squeezing, milking himself with thumb and forefinger as he brought his other hand to the head rubbing the dampness there around. He let himself thrust through the firm pressure of his fist as he circled the edge of his glans with a teasing finger, pressing the slit, teasing the frenulum. He tugged himself as he thought more about what Sherlock could be doing to himself below. Did he use lube? Did he use toys? How in depth did Sherlock’s masturbation ritual get or was he just like John where he could just use a dry hand and some time? Was he overthinking it?
“Well, hello?” he mumbled, confused, propping himself up against Hyperion’s neck to look at the kids. They were staring at him now; they’d been chattering away right until he moved. John could hear little snippets: whispering. “That’s not Victor,” and “he’s got a new rider, guys.” Finally one voice piped up, a pair of hands appearing at the edge and another head pulling itself up to see him.
“Splash of milk, please. Likes to watch the news? Anything else?” John said with a chuckle, imagining Hyperion hunkered down trying to watch a tiny tv with one eye. The bond gave a fond ripple of acknowledgement at the thought, and John encouraged that positive with a little concentration of calm happiness of his own, ‘see, I’m okay’.
Sherlock stayed close to John all day that day, rubbing up against his sides and being overall as affectionate as a large tuna could be short of trying to spawn with him. John tried not to think about that too much, he wasn’t even sure how that process even worked and, even after months in a fish body, John didn’t feel particularly comfortable figuring out what ejaculating as a fish would even be like. Sherlock could try if he wanted to though, John figured, a little surprised he hadn’t seen Sherlock give it a go over the course of the last few days.
It was as though he’d hit Sherlock’s vocal switch as nearly every thrust seemed to pull more happy noises from Sherlock’s open mouth. John had surprised him with the sudden onslaught, hammering right up into Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock’s hands, which had been braced, one on John’s knee the other on the bed, went to John’s on his waist, long fingers trying to pry John’s away. Sherlock threaded their fingers together and started to rock himself, arse meeting John’s thrusts with a short litany of oh’s.
“John?” Sherlock seemed caught off guard by the sudden physical gesture and John squeezed him a little to emphasize that it was indeed a hug and to please not push him away.
The man at the door smiled and met him at least partway there. He was a tall one, like a leaner, paler, ginger version of Kandahar’s Master Omar. “Hello, Dr Watson. I was told I’d be showing you how to feed Hyperion,” he said, a great grin at the prospect covering his lightly fuzzed face.
“Heavens no!” she said, looking quickly over at Hyperion’s head, where the children were carefully petting him and scratching behind his crown, to see an eye staring hard back at them both, most likely picking up on John’s distress. “No! The dragons don’t eat all the meat we give them sometimes for one reason or another; so there’s perfectly good, clean, beef or pork or whatever for the cooks to use.” Sally picked up her food and began eating too, as John looked at his, letting his stomach settle for a moment before he resumed his meal. Hyperion went back to resting while kids continued to explore him gently.
“Cherie, be good,” Mike said as the little thing flapped tiny wings and lept for John, clinging onto his thigh, and climbing up until John could grab and haul her into the crook of his good arm.
“Yes, who could forget. I know you are doing good with this whole detective business, but you put yourself in situations that are incredibly dangerous, and we end up with incidents like what happened yesterday. As it is its only a miracle nothing has come of that yet in the public sphere. The Aerie is paying for the damages.”
“Jumper,” He had never had to use the safeword before, John was, for the most part, fairly tame when they had played like this before, light bondage, maybe some playful swatting, a little rougher sex maybe, nothing so extreme that Sherlock had ever come close to using the word, but it made John happy, so he had one. John clenched his jaw at the word.
he thought hysterically, trying to get his new body to work and get to the little rock hidey holes at the bottom of the tank. The same tuna who kept nudging him kept forcing him back upwards though, and John didn’t have enough control of his body to resist. Eventually he realized that fish don’t really need clothes exactly, and went back to floating and getting bumped by the one dark tuna as well as the other more mobile fish and sharks who couldn’t give a toss he was there.
So John began unpacking, trying to make it more homey. He packed away his clothes in the dresser, set a few of his books and things on top of it, stuffed the picture of his army mates into the bottom of his sock drawer, and hung up anything else that needed hanging in the closet.
“Wiggins got you this time around, Sherlock,” Jim said, focusing on the other rider even though he’d taken out his mobile to look at while he ate.
Sherlock snorted. “Asking questions like that? Obviously you took the bonus he offered, a little extra money to monitor me, and now you’re fishing for personal details.”
“What does it matter?!” He seemed to realize he’d raised in volume and suddenly quieted again.“What does that matter, why would they talk about it? They don’t experience it, they never form one, they might talk about it and you never know because they are a tiny percentage of the population. Do you go around talking about obscure details from your medical textbooks?”
“Cabs are dull, boring, not even remotely fast, but if you need one, I will pay.” Sherlock said, looking back toward the police cars and tape distractedly. John followed his gaze to the run-down house beyond. He probably would regret the decision he was about to make, considering the first time he’d decided to follow Sherlock had just ended poorly.
“Bellamy has had plenty of exercise today. If she feels she wants more you can do some calisthenics back in her pit or you can make a request for a flight session on another day. I have other things I need to get done beyond babysitting you all afternoon!”
“Every time you get into trouble, you have a fit, you act like you’re sorry, like you finally understand, and then you do this, you turn into a sulking pissy blotling rather than listen to your friends, rather than listen to me your own damn mate!” John let his anger finally go, he’d been keeping it checked since even before the crime scene, since he’d learned where Sherlock even was. “Who fucking loves you!” John spat out, and then there was stunned silence in the flat. Sherlock didn’t talk, just sat there and continued shaking, skin color rapidly nearing the shade of lemon pulp.
Hyperion sighed back at him, but he shakily pushed up onto his feet, painkillers doing their job of dulling the pain well since John only felt the dull throb in his leg and almost nothing in his good shoulder. Hyperion slowly limped after John through the initial stiffness of getting up and followed him in his laps, John limping along ahead of him with his cane, laying on encouragements all the way.
John laughed along with him. “Sea flap flaps, that's ridiculous,” he said, snorting as he looked over at the rays and sure enough there they were flapping along in the water, fins breaking the surface now and then to wave in the air.
“So, how is this going to work? Would it be better if I got him up on his feet or can he stay sitting down?” Tom stopped some distance away from Hyperion and looked at John appraisingly before looking at the impatiently waiting Hyperion.
“I know what is said about me around the Aerie,” and he closed the door, effectively ending the conversation. John stood there mulling over whether he should bother him further before deciding against it and going to get his abandoned tea. He dumped out the cold tea and grabbed a small glass of water to take back upstairs, remembering to take his cane with him.
Before John knew it there was a knock at the door and he heard the light creak of it opening at the far end of the room.
“Yes, that’s what she told me. I’m in no rush, to tell the truth.” John wished he could take those last words back the moment they left his mouth. Tom turned to him. “Oh?”
“No, but heard plenty of stories, saw the old evidence now and again,” John replied, taking calming breaths. Hyperion was swamping the bond with calm feelings, trying to drown out the fear with his presence, and though the sheer concentration of it made John’s temples throb slightly, it was working.
Hyperion’s head lifted immediately the moment John opened the door, a torrent of happiness and relief flooding across the bond. He stayed put and John came to him, crawling onto the mat to rest against Hyperion’s warm arm.
“Good day to fly,” Omar commented. John let go of the leg so that Hyperion could continue to walk. That simple phrase threw John back into the moment, where flying was soon to be a reality. He stared up at the Master with a pleading look.
“No, they don’t usually, once the bond is there though, there is no severing it, and of course there wouldn’t be anyone murdering the son of a rider with a legacy like mummy’s, didn’t matter if he was a trouble child,” Sherlock’s face sneered at the last part, voice becoming mocking.
“And, he made you miss an important meeting with your superior officers,” Lestrade asserted over John’s protests. John went silent for a moment, unsure. He had missed that, the Masters,
John watched the little fin go up and down as Sherlock started folding and unfolding it furiously near him, he was beginning to think his friend had finally lost his mind when he started to see a pattern to the flicks. A dash a pause a couple more dashes here and another pause there.
“The kitchen,” Sherlock said, trying to shuffle past him and block John’s view at the same time, leading him towards the hallway past the refrigerator. “The bathroom.” Sherlock pushed the door open a bit to see a thankfully clean bathroom, all in a minty green and white.
John could hear the small note of hurt that tinged Sherlock’s voice even though his face read annoyance. He stood up. “Yes, fine,” he said with a sigh. “What exactly were you planning to do today, something about exercise?” He said wandering past Sherlock, reaching for his own coat and passing Sherlock’s over as well.
“Maybe talk to them a bit more?” John prompted, wishing Sherlock would just look up and engage with both him and the myriad of people who had suddenly become very focused on the rather bare blog of a wounded army doctor.
“Easy, you don’t want to tear any stitches again,” John reminded calmly, looking to the man, now standing just inside the door, with no food in sight.
They stood quietly facing each other for a little longer, both feeling a little awkward at the sudden emotional burst. And then John lightly cleared his throat.
“I’m alright, Hyperion,” he said, pushing lightly back at Hyperion’s jaw with a bare foot. In that moment John realized how he must look should any outsider come in. A grown man, sitting in his pants, leaned up against a dragon, eating lunch. That thought made him laugh, covering his face as he tried to hold it in. Hyperion had a moment of confusion before he caught onto the humor and happiness the odd situation brought John and he chuckled in his own way, echoing that good feeling back and lightening John’s spirits further.
“Hyperion is in need of a soak,” Sherlock commented, picking at the food Angelo had happily packed up just for him.
“No no, Sherlock, snow,” John repeated, pulling Sherlock’s attention briefly away from the gliding behemoth. Sure enough a large flake had floated down and landed on the blanket between them. Now that John noticed it there were others floating around them as well, it was actually snowing.
The pair lay quiet for a time. John felt Sherlock’s mind regaining clarity and some energy in the wake of their exertions. Sherlock gently rippled against John, scooting infinitesimally closer into the hollow of his mass. John wrapped around him a little more, equally as gentle as he rubbed a broad appendage across Sherlock in a comforting manner.
John asked him, “please, no flying stories just yet.” Hyperion conceded, undoubtedly feeling the miniscule twinges of anxiety the thought of flying instilled in John. The memories were so much clearer for John than they had been the night before, and Hyperion was willing to share so much more: meeting other dragons and their riders more colony members to his young mind. Visiting a wild colony on an assignment for the first time. Being fitted for his harness, and fitted again and again as he grew. Molly’s first visit as his new vet, cowering, hissing. So much for getting up and exploring the nooks and crannies of Hyperion’s home, John thought. He was content and comfortable to lay right where he was and absorb the picture memories.
He watched the four agents go to work, drawing weapons and stalking towards the building in their bulletproof vests and gear. And it was in that moment John realized how woefully unprepared for this whole endeavor he was. As much as he wanted to burst in and carry Sherlock over his shoulder back to the aquarium, it just wasn’t going to happen, not in a button up and jeans and absolutely nothing that could be called a weapon beyond his own fists.
“Not to mention the time it will all take to heal, as it is now it’ll take about a month minimum before I’d be comfortable with him doing anything more than basic stretching exercises,” she added. Lestrade sighed at the news, raking a hand across his hair.
John looked down at the long fingered hand he had squeezed in his own, the body warmth at his back. That secret tamped down part of John’s brain that wanted nothing but to ravish Sherlock supplied that having him pressed up against his back, holding him, and whispering in his ear wasn’t so bad either.
“Actually I would like to see the flat,” John agreed, following Sherlock to stand. While Sherlock’s yawn had been fake, it inspired a real one from him and made John realize just how tired he was after their long night of insanity. The wounds he’d sustained may have been healed in the final transformation but their effects were still felt, lumped in with the sheer exhaustion of staying up all night and well into the morning.
“Was what, dear? Mrs Hudson drew him back to the table where a couple of the occupants were staring at him after his sudden outburst.
“This is a three patch problem,” he snapped tugging the arm away before John had the chance to peel at least a couple of the patches of. “Now, I need you to send a text for me,”
Mike chuckled at him, “She’s a clingy one once she’s on you,” he said coming over and taking her from him. She went willingly into her keeper’s arms. “But no, Sherlock, he’s a little hard to pin down. I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for him, he just shows up. Like an outdoor cat, you don’t see em’ for days at a time then they show up on your back step with a dead rat.”
“Better to be in the water even if this cheap bit of plastic is off. Besides we have gills,” Sherlock said climbing the stairs up to the tank.
Rather than lead them down the massive corridors, where John could see attendants’ heads already turning to look at what was being wheeled in, Molly led them straight through to a smaller two-story building within the barn with more human-sized double doors. The building turned out to be the ward for smaller patients. She took the hatchling to a small, very warm examination room past a handful of offices in the front and their occupants. It was there John lost track of Sherlock, invested as he was in helping Molly make sure the hatchling was alright.
The few days that followed were rough for John. He did keep his promise to Hyperion and visited him for as long as he could every day. It made him feel better when he was in contact with the dragon, but it felt like his heart was being ripped out when he had to leave. With his shoulder, John wasn’t able to stay out all night with Hyperion, but the contact he got did seem to be helping; on the last couple of nights he swore he could faintly feel Hyperion still in his mind all the way out at the hospital.
“Fine we were still human… God I’m just glad it’s all over, never want to set foot in water ever again.” John said, watching as the dazed agents helped each other up and began regaining their bearings, looking for their missing equipment.
John went back to the kitchen, checked their dinner on auto-pilot and then sat down with his own tea.
“Good.” She gave him a small smile back before she swung his attention to John. “Jim, you remember Hyperion, right? Meet his new rider, John Watson, John, Jim Moriarty.”
John had to strain to hear Jim murmur, “and you know I like your battle scars, just adds to your lovely stripes,” they both chuckled at that, Sebbie nuzzling into and kissing Jim’s forehead.
“Dr Watson! Dr Watson, it’s time to leave!” He sounded fairly far off. John hummed; he didn’t want to leave, He would have been perfectly happy to sleep there all grubby with sweat. Hyperion, however, heard the word ‘leave’ and his head darted up sharply, turning in the direction of the voice and removing the wall that was his neck.
John slipped the sling back on once he was sufficiently dried and, reassured that his naked form didn’t bother Hyperion, simply strode back to his duffel bag for clothes. He threw on a pair of pants, with some mild contortion to get them up his legs single-handed, and trousers, he left the rest of him bare, not even bothering with boots or a shirt. Hyperion’s home was nice and warm considering the time of year; the white canvas ceiling held the warmth in nicely. By the time John had dressed, Hyperion had already curled his neck back in around himself. The bond emanated a sort of light sulky feeling and John turned to see Hyperion’s head cocked and staring.
“It’s hurting when he walks. Is there anything I can do for that?” John said, the doctorly part of him concerned about Hyperion’s health; he wanted to help against the pain, but didn’t know how.
